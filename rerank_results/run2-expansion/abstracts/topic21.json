We therefore evaluated the presence of tumor-infiltrating Treg cells in uveal melanomas.;A retrospective search of Mayo Clinic records from 2000 to 2005 was performed to identify cases of eyes enucleated as a consequence of uveal melanoma. Histologic examination included location of the tumor, presence of emissary canal invasion, direct sclera extension, extraocular extension, cell type and predominant cell type, mitotic figures per 40 high-power fields, lymphocytic tumor invasion, necrosis, microvascular pattern, and presence of CD3, CD4, CD25, and Foxp3cells. Factors obtained by chart review were also evaluated, including clinical size and ultrasound thickness of tumor before enucleation, patient age at time of enucleation, systemic evaluation for metastatic disease both before and after enucleation, monosomy 3, and systemic status at last patient visit.;Of 42 enucleated eyes, 17 (40.5 %) were found to have lymphocytic infiltrate and 5 (11.9%) were considered positive for the presence of Treg cells (CD3+CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ or CD3+CD4+CD25-Foxp3+). Thus 29.4% (5 of 17) of those with lymphocytic infiltates had Treg cells, and 4 of the 5 with Treg cells had a large lymphocytic infiltrate (>1400 CD3 cells). When using \"death due to disease\" as the hazard ratio (HR) end point, the HR for presence of CD3 was 5.5 (P = .03) and for clinical size, 1.2 (P = .03). Furthermore, when using \"presence of metastasis\" as the end point, the HR for presence of CD3 was 3.6 (P = .05) and for clinical size, 1.3 (P = .003).;Though T lymphocyte infiltration is a bad prognostic indicator, Treg cells are rarely seen in enucleated choroidal melanoma, so their local effect may be limited in contradistinction to other cancers.",

Local tumor control of uveal melanoma is excellent, yet this malignancy is associated with relatively high mortality secondary to metastasis. Various clinical, histopathological, cytogenetic features and gene expression features help in estimating the prognosis of uveal melanoma. The clinical features associated with poor prognosis in patients with uveal melanoma include older age at presentation, male gender, larger tumor basal diameter and thickness, ciliary body location, diffuse tumor configuration, association with ocular/oculodermal melanocytosis, extraocular tumor extension, and advanced tumor staging by American Joint Committee on Cancer classification. Histopathological features suggestive of poor prognosis include epithelioid cell type, high mitotic activity, higher values of mean diameter of ten largest nucleoli, higher microvascular density, extravascular matrix patterns, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, tumor-infiltrating macrophages, higher expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, and higher expression of human leukocyte antigen Class I and II. Monosomy 3, 1p loss, 6q loss, and 8q and those classified as Class II by gene expression are predictive of poor prognosis of uveal melanoma.

        "Doc_abstract":"Human primary malignant melanoma is often accompanied by a host response of infiltrating lymphocytes suggestive of tumor antigen-induced immunity and correlated in some tumors with prognosis. Whereas metastatic melanoma deposits typically are not inflamed and contain relatively few lymphocytes and dendritic immune cells, immunization with autologous melanoma-cell vaccine may induce a clinical inflammatory response associated with mononuclear-cell infiltration. In this study, we characterize immune responses to dermal and subcutaneous melanoma metastases in dinitrophenyl (DNP)-pre-sensitized patients immunized with DNP-conjugated melanoma cells. Patients so treated develop cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity responses to DNP-conjugated autologous mononuclear cells, and approximately one-half show clinical evidence of inflammation and regression of metastases within 2-4 months. Whereas pre-vaccination biopsies of metastatic melanoma failed to reveal significant infiltration by lymphocytes, biopsies obtained after vaccination and coincident with clinical inflammation were markedly infiltrated preponderantly by T cells with a CD8+ phenotype. Clustering of these cells about individual degenerating melanoma cells in a manner analogous to \"satellitosis\" was a consistent feature of this reaction. Enhanced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR by melanoma cells were invariably associated with zones of T-cell infiltration, whereas diminished or absent expression was observed in relatively unaffected regions of tumors. Numerous HLA-DR+, CD4+, CD1-, Leu-1- dendritic cells were also associated with zones of early T-cell infiltration. These data indicate that clinical inflammation and regression of metastatic melanoma induced by autologous melanoma-cell vaccine involves activated T cells with cytotoxic-suppressor phenotype and dendritic cells putatively capable of local antigen presentation. ICAM-1 upregulation on melanoma cells is a likely mediator of ligand interaction between infiltrating T cells and target cells in this model of antigen-induced host anti-tumor response. Structural alterations identified in this setting (e.g., tumor cell satellitosis) may provide additional insight into identifying features of naturally occurring host immune responses to primary cutaneous melanomas.",

In an attempt to delineate the histologic diagnostic criteria, to classify different categories of lymphocytic infiltrates, previously described by Elder et al. at brisk, nonbrisk, and absent, and to verify their prognostic significance, we reviewed 285 consecutive cases of primary cutaneous melanomas (American Joint Committee on Cancer Stage I and II).;In addition to clinical variables (age, sex, and location of tumor) and the presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in the vertical growth phase, the histopathologic attributes reviewed included mitotic rate, thickness, and regression. The results were derived from independent histopathologic review by two pathologists (C.G.C., M.C.M., Jr.) on separate occasions. A multivariate analysis of survival was performed with the Cox's regression model.;The 5- and 10-year rates for melanoma with a vertical growth phase and a brisk infiltrate were 77% and 55%, respectively. For tumors with a nonbrisk infiltrate, the 5- and 10-year survival rates were 53% and 45%, respectively, and for tumors with absent tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, the 5- and 10-year survival rates were 37% and 27%, respectively. Mitotic index, thickness, and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes were statistically (univariate analysis) significant prognostic factors (P = 0.003, 0.000001, 0.0003, respectively), whereas the presence or absence of regression is not. In the univariate statistical analysis, the sex of patients and site of melanoma also were statistically significant (P = 0.00001 and 0.002 respectively), whereas age (P = 0.98) was not statistically significant. The multivariate analysis of thickness, mitotic rate, and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes showed that thickness and presence tumor infiltrating lymphocytes were significant and independent histologic prognostic factors. With regard to the clinical factors, sex retained its independent prognostic significance. The histologic characteristics of melanoma with vertical growth phase (brisk, nonbrisk, and absent) are exemplified.;We demonstrated that when categories of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes are strictly defined, they indeed have very strong predictive value for primary cutaneous melanomas with a vertical growth phase. This work confirms the work of Clark et al. and fully illustrates the brisk, nonbrisk, and absent categories of infiltration. Finally, a multivariate analysis comparing thickness, mitotic rate and presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes showed that only thickness and presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes are significant and independent positive histologic prognostic factors.",

Here, we observed that melanoma-infiltrating dendritic cells extracted from melanoma without any additional manipulations were able to protect naive mice against a lethal challenge with the tumor. Remarkably, this was achieved with reinjection of 10(5) melanoma-infiltrating dendritic cells, a number that did not exceed the total number of melanoma-infiltrating dendritic cells recovered from one single tumor. Three observations indicate that protection was due to the natural loading of melanoma-infiltrating dendritic cells with tumor antigens. First, the protective effect was not observed with equivalent numbers of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Second, the protection induced was specific for the tumor from which the tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells were isolated. Third, depletion experiments indicate that both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes were required during the effector phase of the antitumor response. Hence, designing strategies aimed at rendering melanoma-infiltrating dendritic cells visible to host T cells may boost spontaneous antitumor immunity.",

Lymphocyte migration from blood into peripheral tissues is mainly regulated by vascular endothelium. However, the blood vessels and mechanisms governing the recruitment of TILs in melanoma tumors remain poorly understood. Here, we show that high endothelial venules (HEVs), specialized blood vessels for lymphocyte extravasation into lymphoid tissues, are frequently found in melanoma tumors and are associated with high levels of lymphocyte infiltration. The analysis of 225 primary melanomas revealed that lymphocytes specifically infiltrated HEV-rich areas of melanoma tumors and that the density of MECA-79+ HEVs was variable among patients and strongly correlated with CD3+, CD8+ and CD20+ TIL densities. Inflammatory (CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11) and lymphoid (CCL21, CCL19 and CXCL13) chemokines as well as TH1 and naïve T-cell genes were overexpressed in melanoma samples with high densities of tumor HEVs. Mature dendritic cells (mDCs) were frequently found around tumor HEVs and densities of HEVs and DC-LAMP+ mDCs within tumor stroma were strongly correlated. DCs which maintain HEVs in lymph nodes, may thus also contribute to the regulation of HEVs in melanomas. Finally, we found significantly higher densities of tumor HEVs in melanomas with tumor regression, low Clark level of invasion and thin Breslow thickness (all p < 0.001). The strong association between tumor HEVs, TILs, mDCs and clinical parameters of melanoma, supports a critical role for HEVs in limiting malignant melanoma development through both naïve and effector T-lymphocyte recruitment and activation.",

To identify the major effector mechanisms mediating the specific anti-tumor immune response, we examined 23 benign and neoplastic melanocytic lesions (3 nevi, 14 primary melanomas, and 3 cutaneous and 3 systemic metastases) by quantitative immunohistology, and correlated these results with the histopathological and clinical subtypes of malignant melanoma. Our analyses indicate that CD3+ T-cell receptor alpha/beta-expressing lymphocytes are the prevailing leukocyte subset in primary as well as secondary malignant melanoma. We further observed that in early lesions (< 0.75 mm) of superficial spreading melanoma the vast majority of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) belong to the CD4+ subset and frequently express CD45RA antigens. In more advanced tumors, the contribution of CD8+ TIL gradually increases, indicating that the quality of the anti-tumor immune response changes during the course of the disease. Finally, we found that a varying percentage of cutaneous TIL express the cutaneous leukocyte antigen which is defined by the monoclonal antibody HECA 452 and preferentially expressed by skin-seeking memory T cells. In contrast, extracutaneous melanoma metastases (liver, brain, ovary) were completely devoid of HECA 452-reactive lymphocytes. These findings suggest that lymphocytes infiltrating cutaneous melanomas belong to a memory/effector T-cell subset functionally associated with the skin.",

When transplanted to the anterior segment of the mouse eye, the mutant melanoma (D5.1G4) underwent spontaneous resolution in 20% of the immunologically intact hosts. Tumor rejection involved extensive necrosis and culminated in phthisis of the tumor-containing eye. Histologic analysis revealed a prominent mononuclear cellular infiltrate in contrast to the parental progressor B16 melanoma. Immunologic analysis of tumor-bearing hosts showed variable cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses but potent delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses directed against the melanoma cells. Fluorescent activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis of tumor-infiltrating cells from ocular tumors revealed a cellular response consisting mainly of CD8+ CTLs and macrophages. Cultured D5.1G4 melanoma cells demonstrated: 1) enhanced expression of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens; 2) increased susceptibility to CTL-mediated killing; and 3) increased susceptibility to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-mediated cytolysis. Therefore, the intraocular D5.1G4 mutant melanoma model provides important insights into the immunology and immunopathology of intraocular tumor rejection.

High-level CD80 and CD86 expression was obtained in the tumor lines using a retroviral vector for gene transfer. Transduced melanoma and controls were cultured with mononuclear cells from HLA-identical sibling donors.;Expression of CD80 and CD86, particularly the former, promoted marked expansion of lymphocytes from HLA-matched sibling donors. Proliferation of up to 300-fold after 4 weeks of culture was observed. Lymphocytes from cultures stimulated with CD80 demonstrated cytotoxicity against recipient-untransfected melanoma (45-75% specific lysis at an E:T ratio of 50:1).

In vitro, melanoma cells stained for LIGHT in the intracellular compartment, with weak or negative cell surface expression. However, LIGHT was expressed on tumor-derived microvesicles released from melanoma cells. In vivo, LIGHT was found in metastatic lesions, and the extent of lymphotoxin beta receptor expression on the stromal cells was significantly associated with a \"brisk\" T-cell infiltrate in the neoplastic tissue. In the lesions with a brisk T-cell infiltrate, stromal cells surrounding the tumor also stained for the T-cell attractant chemokine CCL21. The intratumoral T lymphocytes frequently expressed herpesvirus entry mediator and were characterized by a differentiated phenotype. Coculture of lymphocytes with LIGHT(+) melanoma-derived microvesicles or even with LIGHT(+) melanoma cells in the presence of interleukin-2 costimulated LIGHT-dependent CD3(+)CD8(+) T-cell proliferation. However, lymphocyte coculture with LIGHT(+) microvesicles in the presence of interleukin-2 was also associated with an apoptotic response as documented by increased binding of Annexin V by CD3(+)CD8(+) T cells.

Stress hormones can influence tumor development in different ways and norepinephrine was shown to downregulate antitumor immune responses by favoring the accumulation of immunosuppressive cells, impairing the function of lymphocytes. We assessed the effect of propranolol on antitumor immune response in the MT/Ret mouse model of melanoma. Propranolol treatment delayed primary tumor growth and metastases development in MT/Ret mice. Consistent with our previous observations in human melanoma xenografts, propranolol induces a decrease in cell proliferation and vessel density in the primary tumors and in metastases. In this immunocompetent model, propranolol significantly reduced the infiltration of myeloid cells, particularly neutrophils, in the primary tumor.

A significantly higher amount of several subsets of leukocytes was found in samples with a more progressed tumor stage and survival analysis demonstrated that a higher amount of T lymphocytes and CD16+ cells was associated with a short survival. The amount of FOXP3+ regulatory T lymphocytes did not correlate with survival, nevertheless, it correlated with the amount of total infiltrate. In contrast, analysis of the expression of CD69, a marker for activated lymphocytes, demonstrated that patients with a higher amount of CD69+ lymphocytes had a better survival. In addition, a new parameter for aggressiveness of melanoma, tumor cell plasticity [i.e., the presence of periodic acid Schiff's (PAS) reagent positive loops], also predicted short survival and a trend of a higher amount of tumor infiltrating leukocytes in tumors with PAS positive loops was observed.

We have characterized the expression of the C-type lectin natural killer receptor CD94/NKG2 on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in primary and metastatic melanoma lesions. By immunohistochemistry, 5-10% of the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, both in primary and metastatic lesions, expressed CD94. More than 95% of these CD94+ cells coexpressed CD8 and the percentage of CD94 expression within the CD8+ cell population ranged from 5 to 20% with a higher expression in metastatic lesions. CD94/NKG2 exists both in an inhibitory and an activating form; thus, it was necessary to determine whether the inhibitory CD94/NKG2-A/B, the activating CD94/NKG2-C/E, or both were expressed on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using specific primers for NKG2-A/B and C/E mRNA revealed the presence of NKG2-C/E in all primary and metastatic lesions. In contrast, the inhibitory NKG2-A/B was only present in 50% of primary tumors whereas 80% of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in metastatic lesions expressed these transcripts. In healthy humans, the mean number of inhibitory natural killer receptors is higher than that of activating receptors, but the opposite was true for tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in melanoma. The reversal of the ratio of inhibitory to activating natural killer receptors among tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes suggests a regulated event due to either specific factors within the tumor microenvironment, preferential homing of T cell subsets, or certain stages of T cell activation.",

The degree of such infiltration and cell activation are considered significant prognostic factors reflecting the host's immune response to the tumor; thus, patients with peritumoral infiltration may have a better prognosis and may also achieve a better response to interleukin-2 (IL2) immunotherapy. There is evidence that the expression of cluster designation (CD) 25 antigen (IL2 receptor [IL2R]) is a good marker of activity of T lymphocytes against melanoma cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate in vivo the binding of 99mTc-IL2 to lymphocytes infiltrating cutaneous melanoma and to determine whether such uptake correlates with immunologic and histologic data, thus providing useful prognostic information for IL2 therapy in patients with advanced disease.;Thirty patients with cutaneous lesions suspected of being melanoma were studied. Planar gamma-camera images over known tumor sites were acquired 1 h after the injection of 111-185 MBq of 99mTc-IL2. Tumor uptake of 99mTc-IL2 was measured as a target-to-background (T/B) radioactivity ratio. All patients underwent surgery, and histologic evaluation of the resected lesion was performed. The percentage of different peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD16, CD25) and the percentage of IL2R-positive tumor cells on histologic sections were also measured.;At final histology, 21 lesions were found to be melanoma and 9 were classified as benign. In 15 of 21 (71%) melanomas and 2 of 9 (22%) benign cutaneous lesions, we found uptake of 99mTc-IL2. The calculated T/B ratios correlated significantly with the number of IL2R-positive TILs.;99mTc-IL2 scintigraphy provides a means of in vivo measurement of the extent of tumor infiltration of IL2R-positive cells, thereby providing valuable prognostic information for selection of patients who may benefit from IL2 immunotherapy.",

The identification of specific melanoma antigens was an important step in the development of these new approaches. These treatments are capable of yielding tumor responses that last several years, but the response rate is currently inadequate. The crucial role of the tumor microenvironment has recently been shown: melanoma cells render their immediate environment immunotolerant, undermining the effectiveness of stimulated cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The mechanisms responsible for this state of immune tolerance are a major focus of research. Current therapeutic strategies are based on early adjuvant approaches, destruction of regulatory T cells by lymphodepletion prior to immunotherapy, selection of the melanoma antigens inducing the best cytotoxic T cell responses, and combining cellular therapy with monoclonal antibodies that block molecules inhibiting T lymphocyte activation. Immune therapy for melanoma is thus moving towards adjuvant strategies for early-stage disease and combined treatments for metastatic melanoma. It is also important to identify markers that can be used to predict which patients will respond to a given treatment.",

Seventeen melanoma cell lines and 11 nonmelanoma cell lines were infected with recombinant vaccinia virus containing the HLA-A2.1 gene. Infection by the vaccinia virus resulted in expression of functional HLA-A2 molecules on the cell surface of virtually 100% of infected cells within a 3.5-h period. The results showed that 11 of 17 (65%) naturally HLA-A2- melanoma cell lines were specifically lysed by the HLA-A2-restricted, melanoma-specific TIL after infection with the vaccinia-HLA-A2.1 virus. None of the nine human nonmelanoma cell lines tested (three colon cancer, four breast cancer, or two immortalized non-tumor cell lines) or two murine melanoma cell lines were lysed by the HLA-A2-restricted TIL after vaccinia-HLA-A2.1 infection. Coinfection of the vaccinia virus containing the beta 2-microglobulin gene with the vaccinia-HLA-A2.1 virus increased the surface expression of HLA-A2 and subsequent lysis by melanoma-specific tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. With this new method we could extend previous findings demonstrating that shared melanoma Ag recognized by HLA-A2-restricted tumor infiltrating lymphocytes exist among melanoma cells from different patients regardless of HLA type.

By analyzing the immune response of a metastatic melanoma patient who achieved a long-term response to vaccination, we identified melanoma inhibitor of apoptosis protein (ML-IAP) as a target for immune-mediated tumor destruction. Vaccination stimulated a coordinated cellular and humoral reaction to ML-IAP that was associated with extensive tumor necrosis, whereas lethal disease progression was linked with the loss of ML-IAP expression and the absence of intra-tumoral lymphocyte infiltrates.

Recently, a monoclonal antibody (57B) has become available to examine MAGE protein expression in archival material. In this study, we performed immunohistochemical analysis on 132 melanocytic nevi and 205 melanomas (85 primary cutaneous melanomas and 120 metastatic tumors) to determine the frequency of MAGE expression and to explore a potential correlation with various prognostic parameters. None of the melanocytic nevi and none of the 20 in situ melanomas was immunopositive with the antibody 57B. Immunoreactivity was present in 17 of 65 (26%) primary invasive melanomas of the skin and in 30 of 120 (25%) metastatic tumors. Positive immunostaining did not correlate with tumor stage (P = .66), Breslow thickness (P = .39), Clark level (P = .5), or the histologic type of melanoma (P = .23) but was associated with a brisk infiltrate of lymphocytes involving the vertical growth phase of melanomas (P = .01). Because tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in melanoma are associated with longer survival, our findings suggest a potential prognostic role for MAGE.

These findings led us to investigate apoptosis, and to histochemically analyze involvement of Fas and FasL in the induction of apoptosis, in human malignant melanoma tissues. The percentages of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotin-dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL)-positive melanoma cells and of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive melanoma cells in melanoma tissues (n = 22) were greater than those in melanocytes in uninvolved skin (n = 6) and nevus cells in nevi tissues (n = 9). The infiltrating lymphocytes around melanomas were also TUNEL positive. Immunohistochemistry revealed expression of Fas and FasL in melanoma cells and lymphocytes, whereas no Fas or FasL expression was detected in normal skin melanocytes and nevus cells. There was significant correlation between Fas-positive indices and TUNEL indices in melanoma tissues. Moreover, TUNEL-, Fas-, and FasL-positive indices of melanoma cells from patients with Stage 3 melanomas were significantly lower than those with Stage 2 melanomas. The PCNA index of Stage 1 melanoma was significantly lower than that of the other stages, although the difference of PCNA index was insignificant among Stages 2 to 4. Among Stages 1 to 4, there was no difference in the PCNA, TUNEL-, and Fas-positive indices of lymphocytes, although the FasL-positive index of lymphocytes from Stage 3 melanomas was significantly lower than in that from Stage 2. These data reveal that melanoma cells and infiltrating lymphocytes have the potential to induce their own apoptosis regulated by Fas and FasL in an autocrine and/or paracrine fashion and that the decline of Fas-mediated apoptosis of melanoma cells, rather than the apoptosis of infiltrating lymphocytes, may affect the prognosis of melanoma patients, possibly through the accumulation of more aberrant cells acquiring metastatic activity.",

A phase I clinical trial of this immunization strategy in patients with disseminated melanoma revealed the consistent induction in distant metastases of dense T and B cell infiltrates that effectuated substantial tumor necrosis and fibrosis. To delineate the target antigens of this vaccine-stimulated tumor destruction, we screened a melanoma cDNA expression library with postimmunization sera from a long-term responding patient (K030). High-titer IgG antibodies recognized melanoma inhibitor of apoptosis protein (ML-IAP), a caspase antagonist containing a single baculoviral IAP repeat and a COOH-terminal RING domain. Although K030 harbored antibodies to ML-IAP at the time of study entry, multiple courses of vaccination over 4 years increased antibody titers and elicited isotype switching. Moreover, lymphocyte infiltrates in necrotic metastases included CD4+ and CD8+ T cells specific for ML-IAP, as revealed by proliferation, tetramer, enzyme-linked immunospot, and cytotoxicity analysis. Whereas melanoma cells in densely infiltrated lesions showed strong ML-IAP expression by immunohistochemistry, lethal disease progression was associated with the loss of ML-IAP staining and the absence of lymphocyte infiltrates.

This question was examined further by immunoperoxidase studies on sections from 29 primary and 30 metastatic melanoma with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against different lymphocyte subsets. The results indicated that expression of MHC class II DR* antigens on melanoma cells was associated with increased overall lymphocytic infiltration and that this applied particularly to the CD8+ subset of T cells. The CR3 receptor (CD 11b) was expressed predominantly on T cells and not macrophages but infiltration by CD11b+ cells did not correlate strongly with DR expression on melanoma cells. Dual staining with MAbs to CD8 and CD11b revealed that, whereas most of the CD8+ cells in DR- primary melanoma and DR+ metastatic melanoma were CD11b+, only approximately 50% of the CD8+ cells in DR+ primary melanoma were also CD11b+. Expression of CD11b on T cells was reported to define a suppressor subset of T cells. If the latter is correct the present results suggest that DR expression on primary melanoma is associated with infiltration by the cytotoxic T cell subset, whereas in the absence of DR antigens and in metastases this subset is absent and the predominant subset appears to be CD8+ CD11b+ T cells with suppressor activity.

We found that 150 of the approximately 1200 tumor-associated methylation peaks near transcription start sites (TSSs) were marked by H3K27me3 in melanocytes. DNA methylation in melanoma was specific for distinct H3K27me3 peaks rather than for broadly covered regions. However, numerous H3K27me3 peak-associated TSS regions remained devoid of DNA methylation in tumors. There was no relationship between BRAF mutations and the number of methylation peaks. Gene expression analysis showed upregulated immune response genes in melanomas presumably as a result of lymphocyte infiltration. Down-regulated genes were enriched for melanocyte differentiation factors; e.g., KIT, PAX3 and SOX10 became methylated and downregulated in melanoma. ",

Here, using B16F0 melanoma cells stably expressing CCL21 under the control of cytomegalovirus and ubiquitin promoters, we showed that CCL21-activated immune responses depend on the amount of melanoma-derived chemokine, which, in turn, depends on the strength of the promoter. We showed that ubiquitin promoter-driven expression of CCL21 enabled massive infiltration of tumors with CD4(+)CD25(-), CD8(+) T lymphocytes, and CD11c(+) dendritic cells, and consequent activation of cellular and humoral immune responses sufficient for complete rejection of CCL21-positive melanomas within 3 weeks in all tumor-inoculated mice. Mice that rejected CCL21-positive tumors acquired protective immunity against melanoma, which was transferable to naive mice via splenocytes and central memory T cells. Moreover, melanoma-derived CCL21 facilitated immune-mediated remission of preestablished, distant wild-type melanomas. Overall, these results suggest that elevated levels of tumor-derived CCL21 are required for the activation of strong melanoma-specific immune responses and generation of protective immunologic memory. They also open new perspectives for the development of novel vaccination strategies against melanoma, which use intratumoral delivery of the optimized CCL21-encoding vectors in conjunction with DNA-based vaccines.",

The vitiligo-infiltrating lymphocytes were almost exclusively T lymphocytes, and most were CD8(+). Following in vitro expansion, vitiligo-infiltrating lymphocytes remained predominantly CD8(+) and expressed the cutaneous homing receptor CLA. Furthermore, vitiligo-infiltrating lymphocytes had a clonal or oligoclonal T cell receptor profile, possibly reflecting specific antigenic stimulation. Finally, vitiligo- infiltrating lymphocytes specifically recognized differentiation antigens shared by normal melanocytes and melanoma cells.

This approach elicits significant inflammatory responses in metastatic sites and some objective tumor responses. Post-surgical adjuvant immunotherapy with DNP-modified melanoma vaccine in a setting of micrometastatic disease produces significant survival prolongation in stage III melanoma patients. Histologically, the inflammatory responses of the tumor consist of infiltration by lymphocytes, the majority of which are CD8+, HLA-DR+ T cells. T cells from these lesions tend to have mRNA for interferon gamma. T cell receptor analysis suggests that the tumor-infiltrating T cells are clonally expanded. DNP-modified vaccine also induces T cells in the peripheral blood, which respond to DNP-modified autologous cells in a hapten-specific, MHC-restricted manner. Moreover, a T cell line generated from these lymphocytes responded to only a single HPLC fraction of MHC-associated, DNP-modified tumor peptides. Since inflammatory responses in metastases were not consistently associated with dramatic tumor regression, we considered the possibility of immunosuppression at the tumor site. We found that mRNA for the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10 (IL-10) is expressed in most metastatic melanoma tissues and subsequently demonstrated that IL-10 protein is produced by melanoma cells. Thus the efficacy of DNP vaccine could be further enhanced by inhibition of IL-10 production or binding.

Our study is the first to employ formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue sections in seeking to determine the ex vivo presence of tumor infiltrating leukocytes, including T lymphocytes, in human melanomas. We established the presence of some type of melanoma infiltrating host's immunological effector cells in all 40 observed melanoma cases'. More specifically, we found NK cells, macrophages and granulocytes in 30 out of 30 PMs and 10 out of 10 MMs. These effector cells represented the vast majority (> 80%) of the melanoma infiltrating immunocompetent cells. T lymphocytes were observed in 20 out of 30 PMs and 6 out of 10 MMs, but their numbers represented only between 5% to 10% of the heterogeneous leukocytic infiltrate. B cells were found in 22 out of 30 PMs and 8 out 10 MMs, their numbers representing less than 5%. Presence of cells of the dendritic reticulum, involved in antigen presentation was not determined in any of the observed PMs and MMs. There were more than enough macrophages and neutrophils, cells which are deeply involved in antigen presentation and, as previously mentioned, we found these cells within the melanomas. Thus defective antigen presentation cannot be the reason for the small proportion of T lymphocytes. What is to blame is probably the increased dedifferentiation of the melanoma immunophenotype (IP) to a degree that MHC class I molecules and the antigens complexed with them are lost and therefore there is nothing to be recognized by the T lymphocytes. In view of these results it is our-opinion that following the initial non-specific immune reaction, which may not be tumor specific, the specific immune response of effector T cells takes over. After significant IP changes by the majority of melanoma cells, including the internalization or shedding of MHC class I antigens, these highly specialized cells are no longer effective and the immune system responds by causing the reappearance of NK cells, macrophages and granulocytes. Thus, the relationship between melanoma and the host's immune system is evolutionarily dynamic: changes are readily made by either side when necessitated.",

Several mechanisms may account for this subversion, including the triggering of tolerance to tumor antigens [2, 3], TGF-alpha or IL-10 production, downregulation of MHC molecules, or upregulation of FasL expression [4, 5]. Melanoma cells may in some instances use FasL expression to protect themselves against tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) [4, 5]. Here, we show another, chemokine-dependent mechanism by which melanoma tumor cells shield themselves from immune reactions. Melanoma-inducible CCL5 (RANTES) production by infiltrating CD8 cells activates an apoptotic pathway in TIL involving cytochrome c release into the cytosol and activation of caspase-9 and -3. This process, triggered by CCL5 binding to CCR5, is not mediated by TNFalpha, Fas, or caspase-8. The effect is not unique to CCL5, as other CCR5 ligands such as CCL3 (MIP-1alpha) and CCL4 (MIP-1beta) also trigger TIL cell death, nor is it limited to melanoma cells, as it also operates in activated primary T lymphocytes. The model assigns a role to the CXC chemokine CXCL12 (SDF-1alpha) in this process, as this melanoma cell-produced chemokine upregulates CCL5 production by TIL, initiating TIL cell death.",

In previous series of experiments, the variability of T cell receptors (TCRs) in the lymphocytes infiltrating a regressive tumor lesion was investigated. Results demonstrated that clonal T cell populations, precisely defined through their V-D-J junctional sequences, were amplified in situ. One clone was predominant, expressing the V beta 16 variable gene segment. A specific anti-V beta 16 TCR mAb was generated here to purify and functionally characterize the corresponding cells. A tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte-derived V beta 16+ T cell line was developed using this reagent. These in vitro cultured cells were found to express the in vivo predominant TCR sequence exclusively and to display an HLA-B14-restricted cytotoxic activity against the autologous tumor cells. Immunohistochemical experiments, performed with the anti-V beta 16 mAb, showed that the corresponding CTLs are present in the tumor area, some of them being closely opposed to the melanoma cells. Together, these studies demonstrate the existence of a local adaptive immune response clinically associated to tumor regression, thus strongly supporting the validity of the immunosurveillance concept in certain human tumors.",

Monoclonal antibodies to lymphocyte subpopulations were used to identify and quantitate lymphoid infiltrates in 15 primary melanomas and 8 cutaneous metastases. These were correlated with histological features identified in routine sections. There was a wide variation in the numbers of mononuclear cells associated with both primary and metastatic melanoma. T cells and to a lesser extent macrophages accounted for the majority of the cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells for only 2% of the infiltrates. The Leu 3a (helper) T cell subpopulation predominated in primary tumours, OKT8 positive (suppressor/cytotoxic) cells in metastases. Infiltrates in which OKT8 cells predominated were associated with ulceration, a high mitotic rate and thick primary tumours. The converse applied to Leu 3a infiltrates. Infiltrates with a high proportion of Leu 3a positive cells tended to be associated with Thy-1 positive, DR antigen negative tumours. Thy-1 antigens were predominantly expressed on primary tumours and rarely on metastases whereas the converse applied to expression of the acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA) on melanoma cells. These findings suggest that certain melanoma antigens may be related to the nature of the lymphoid infiltrate associated with melanoma and possibly with the behaviour of the tumour in the host.

        "Doc_abstract":"Adoptive cell transfer therapy using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes for patients with metastatic melanoma has demonstrated significant objective response rates. One major limitation of these current therapies is the frequent inability to isolate tumor-reactive lymphocytes for treatment. Genetic engineering of peripheral blood lymphocytes with retroviral vectors encoding tumor antigen-specific T-cell receptors (TCRs) bypasses this restriction. To evaluate the efficacy of TCR gene therapy, a murine treatment model was developed. A retroviral vector was constructed encoding the pmel-1 TCR genes targeting the B16 melanoma antigen, gp100. Transduction of C57BL/6 lymphocytes resulted in efficient pmel-1 TCR expression. Lymphocytes transduced with this retrovirus specifically recognized gp100-pulsed target cells as measured by interferon-gamma secretion assays. Upon transfer into B16 tumor-bearing mice, the genetically engineered lymphocytes significantly slowed tumor development. The effectiveness of tumor treatment was directly correlated with the number of TCR-engineered T cells administered. These results demonstrated that TCR gene therapy targeting a native tumor antigen significantly delayed the growth of established tumors. When C57BL/6 lymphocytes were added to antigen-reactive pmel-1 T cells, a reduction in the ability of pmel-1 T cell to treat B16 melanomas was seen, suggesting that untransduced cells may be deleterious to TCR gene therapy. This model may be a powerful tool for evaluating future TCR gene transfer-based strategies.",

We have previously shown that RhoA GTPase and its effector ROCK negatively control FasL membrane expression in murine melanoma B16F10 cells. In this study, we found that B16F10 treatment with the ROCK inhibitor H1152 reduced melanoma development in vivo through FasL membrane overexpression. Although H1152 treatment did not reduce tumor growth in vitro, pretreatment of tumor cells with this inhibitor delayed tumor appearance, and slowed tumor growth in C57BL/6 immunocompetent mice. Thanks to the use of mice-bearing mutated Fas receptors (B6/lpr), we found that reduced tumor growth, observed in immunocompetent mice, was linked to FasL overexpression induced by H1152 treatment. Tumor growth analysis in immunosuppressed NUDE and IFN-γ-KO mice highlighted major roles for T lymphocytes and IFN-γ in the H1152-induced tumor growth reduction. Histological analyses of subcutaneous tumors, obtained from untreated versus H1152-treated B16F10 cells, showed that H1152 pretreatment induced a strong intratumoral infiltration of leukocytes. Cytofluorometric analysis showed that among these leukocytes, the number of activated CD8 lymphocytes was increased. Moreover, their antibody-induced depletion highlighted their main responsibility in tumor growth reduction. Subcutaneous tumor growth was also reduced by repeated intravenous injections of a clinical ROCK inhibitor, Fasudil. Finally, H1152-induced ROCK inhibition also reduced pulmonary metastasis implantation independently of T cell-mediated immune response. Altogether, our data suggest that ROCK inhibitors could become interesting pharmacological molecules for melanoma immunotherapy. ",

PBLs grew to levels that could be assessed for functional reactivity 9 of 15 times. In seven of nine cases, CD3+CD8+ CTLs grew from MLTCs that were tumor specific; five were restricted by HLA-A2 and two were restricted by HLA-A24. Four of the tumor-specific CTL lines lysed autologous fresh tumor cells. Tumor-specific CTLs from two of three patients had cytolytic activity identical with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) derived from tumor biopsies removed earlier and grown in high concentrations (6000 IU/ml) of IL-2. Three of the HLA-A2-restricted tumor-specific CTLs were shown to recognize 293 cells transfected with HLA-A2.1 cDNA and the gene encoding the melanoma Ag, MART-1. In addition, these CTLs recognized the T2 cell line pulsed exogenously with the peptide MART-1(27-35), which is the nine-amino acid immunodominant epitope of the MART-1 Ag recognized on melanoma tumor cells by nearly all HLA-A2-restricted TIL. Thus, we have demonstrated the ability to generate tumor-specific CTLs from PBLs that are similar in their reactivity to TIL. This technique obviates the need for autologous tumor tissue and suggests that PBLs contain sufficient CTL precursors for use in generating antitumor CTLs for cellular immunotherapy trials.",

These in vitro activated T cells depend on the growth factor, interleukin (IL)-2, and may undergo apoptosis in vivo when they are transferred. The authors previously reported that the need for an exogenous source of IL-2 could be abrogated in vitro by retrovirally transducing antitumor T lymphocytes with an exogenous IL-2 gene. Here they report that this growth of IL-2 transductants depended on restimulation of the T-cell receptor complex and appeared to be regulated at the transcriptional level of the transduced IL-2 gene. The transduced IL-2 transcript was barely detectable in IL-2-transductants just before they died without restimulation, and they expressed a low level of the CD25 molecule, the alpha chain of the IL-2 trimeric receptor complex. Melanoma-specific tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (either bulk or CD8+ cells alone), when transduced with an IL-2 retroviral vector, could produce IL-2 upon tumor stimulation and proliferated after the destruction of autologous tumor cells in the absence of added IL-2. Control vector-transduced tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes failed to do so under the same conditions. These findings provide a foundation for the development of clinical efforts to adoptively transfer melanoma-specific tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes transduced with an IL-2 retroviral vector for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma to evaluate the fate and therapeutic effect of these IL-2 gene-modified antitumor T lymphocytes in vivo.",

Primary melanoma cell lines were obtained from a series of patients with either eye or skin melanoma. The ability of tumor cells to stimulate T cells in the absence of exogenous growth factors was assessed in mixed-lymphocyte tumor cell cultures in which allogeneic lymphocytes were stimulated with irradiated ocular or skin melanoma cells. Expression of HLA class I and class II on tumor cells, in the presence or absence of IFN-gamma, was determined by flow cytometry. The ability of tumor cells to inhibit T-cell proliferation was determined by adding various concentrations of irradiated tumor cells to standard mixed-lymphocyte cultures. Our results indicate that primary skin melanoma cells induce vigorous proliferation of allo-antigen-specific T cells. By contrast, ocular melanoma cells failed to induce significant T-cell proliferation. The failure of ocular melanoma cells to stimulate lymphocyte proliferation was not due to low levels of either class I or class II on tumor cells since tumor cells treated with IFN-gamma expressed high levels of class I and class II but still failed to induce lymphocyte proliferation. Ocular melanoma cells inhibited lymphocyte proliferation, as shown by experiments in which a small number of tumor cells prevented proliferation of T cells in mixed-lymphocyte cultures. Inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation required cell-to-cell contact, and supernatants from tumor cell cultures did not prevent lymphocyte proliferation. Moreover, the ability of ocular melanoma cells to inhibit T-cell proliferation was lost when tumor cells migrated from the eye and formed hepatic metastases. We conclude that there is a fundamental difference in the immunogenicity of ocular and skin melanoma cells. Ocular melanomas, but not primary skin melanomas, are poorly immunogenic tumors that inhibit T-cell proliferation. Our results imply that the immunogenicity of melanoma cells is altered when they develop within the unique ocular micro-environment.",

Infiltrating neutrophils (CD66b), dendritic cells (CD123+ and DC-LAMP+), T-lymphocytes (CD8) and pSTAT3 melanoma cell expression were studied by immunohistochemistry and evaluated as present or absent. DC-LAMP+ cell infiltration was evaluated as absent/few versus dense. Study endpoints: relapse-free survival, melanoma-specific, and overall survival.;The median observation time was 12.2 years (range, 10.4-14.2 years).

Primary s.c. B16 F10 melanoma growth was augmented by loss of MCP-1 or MIP-1α. Similarly, lung metastasis was enhanced by the deficiency of MCP-1 or MIP-1α. Enhanced tumor outgrowth was associated with decreased percentages of infiltrating CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, and natural killer cells. In the absence of MCP-1 or MIP-1α, melanoma outgrowth was correlated with reduced local expression of interferon-γ, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and transforming growth factor-β. Among these cytokines, reduced expression levels of interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α on leukocytes from the spleen were associated with the development of lung metastasis in chemokine-deficient mice. The local s.c. administration of these four cytokines significantly augmented another chemokine's expression and suppressed primary melanoma growth in mice deficient for MCP-1 or MIP-1α. The s.c. injection of MCP-1 or MIP-1α significantly inhibited the primary tumor growth in wild-type mice.

TIGIT is an inhibitory receptor expressed on T cells, and CD155 is one of the cognate ligands expressed on the tumor cells or antigen-presenting cells. First, we confirmed that CD155 was constitutively expressed on melanoma cells. We then demonstrated that CD155 on melanoma cells suppressed cytokine release from melanoma-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes via interaction with TIGIT. Overexpression of CD155 enhanced and its downregulation attenuated the suppressive effect. This suggested that antimelanoma cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses are controlled not only by an imbalance in CD226 (an activating molecule that binds to CD155) and TIGIT expression on T cells but also by the expression levels of CD155 on melanoma cells. In addition, the co-blockade of TIGIT and PD-1 signals synergistically elicited a response of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes on autologous melanoma cells.

Hu-mAb L72 was developed by transforming peripheral blood lymphocytes from a melanoma patient in vitro with the Epstein-Barr virus, forming a human lymphoblastoid cell line that produces 2-5 micrograms of IgM per ml. This IgM Hu-mAb was shown to react specifically with ganglioside GD2 and have a strong cytotoxic effect on human melanoma cells in the presence of complement. Patients with cutaneous metastatic melanoma were given intralesional injections on a daily or weekly injection schedule. Regression was seen in all tumors except in those of two patients whose tumors were shown to have low antigenicity. Histopathological data showed tumor degeneration, fibrosis, free melanin, and some degree of lymphocyte or macrophage infiltration. One patient with melanoma satellitosis treated with Hu-mAb showed complete regression with no sign of recurrence 20 months after the initial treatment. With the exception of mild erythema, no side effects were observed in any patient.",

We found increased levels of a spliced FKBP5 variant in the PBMCs of 124 patients with melanoma. This variant encodes for an unknown isoform (FKBP51s). We hypothesized that FKBP51s resulted from tumour interaction with immune cells, through PDL-1/PD-1. To address this issue, we performed melanoma/PBMC cocultures. Furthermore, the immunohistochemistry of 76 melanoma specimens served to investigate whether FKBP51s stained tumour infiltrating lymphocytes. Our results showed that PBMCs expressed FKBP51s when cocultured with melanoma. Tumour PDL-1 knockdown or anti-PD-1 reduced FKBP51s expression in cocultured PBMCs. IHC showed a strong FKBP51s signal in tumour infiltrating lymphocytes, and lymphocytes of the invasion front of the tumour, along with melanoma PDL-1 expression. When overexpressed in melanoma, FKBP51s facilitated PDL-1 expression on the cell surface. In conclusion, our study shows that FKBP51s marks the PBMCs of patients with melanoma and is exploited by the tumour to immunomodulate through PDL-1. ",

FAS and FASL were studied in all of the groups using classical labeled streptavidin-biotin immunohistochemical method. Tumor infiltrating lymphocyte status and macrophage number demonstrated by CD68 immunostain were also evaluated in primary melanoma and skin metastases.;FAS positivity was detected in all of the cases. FASL expressions were seen in 60% of the intra-dermal nevus and in all of the other groups. There were significant differences in FASL between nevus and primary melanoma, nevus and skin metastasis, and nevus and lymph node metastasis. There were strong positive correlations between FAS expression and intra-neoplastic macrophage score and between FASL and density of lymphocyte infiltration in skin metastases.;Although FAS and FASL expression is a constant feature of melanotic lesions, its diagnostic importance is very limited because of the different results obtained in the past studies.

Histological examination shows these tumors to be infiltrated with T lymphocytes. We studied the expression of activation markers on those cells and compared them with matched peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and with lymphocytes extracted from metastases before treatment with DNP-conjugated vaccine. The median fraction of cells that were T cells in post-vaccine tumors was 41%, as compared with 9% in pre-treatment tumors, and those T cells were predominantly CD8+ (mean CD8/CD4 ratio = 5.0). A high proportion of both pre- and post-treatment infiltrating T cells expressed HLA-DR (mean +/- SE = 48% +/- 4%), CD69 (56% +/- 7%), and ganglioside GD3 (68% +/- 5%). This distinguished them from matched PBL in which expression of those markers was significantly lower (HLA-DR = 10% +/- 2%; CD69 = 2% +/- 0.4%; GD3 = 49% +/- 4%). These changes were not accompanied by increased cell-surface expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptors, either CD25 or p75, which were expressed by 1%-2% and 12% of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), respectively. The pattern of activation marker expression that we identified appears to be characteristic of tissue T cells with the memory phenotype. The low expression of IL-2 receptors could indicate functional impairment of TIL in situ, perhaps because of inhibitory molecules produced by melanoma cells.",

In addition to such targeted therapies, immunotherapeutic approaches have shown promising results. A combination of these two treatment modalities could potentially result in further improvement of treatment outcome. To preclinically identify efficient treatment combinations and to optimize therapy protocols in terms of sequence and timing, mouse models will be required. We have crossed and characterized the Tyr::CreER(T2);PTEN(F-/-);BRAF(F-V600E/+) inducible melanoma model on a C57BL/6J background. Tumors from this model harbor the BRAF(V600E) mutation and are PTEN-deficient, making them highly suitable for the testing of targeted therapies. Furthermore, we crossed the model onto this specific background for use in immunotherapy studies, because most experiments in this field have been performed in C57BL/6J mice. Selective inhibition of BRAF(V600E) by PLX4720 treatment of melanoma-bearing mice resulted in a strong decrease of tumor outgrowth. Furthermore, the inducible melanomas had immune cell infiltrates similar to those found in human melanoma, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes could be cultured from these tumors.

Although both approaches have shown considerable promise, response rates to these therapies remain suboptimal. We hypothesized that a combinatorial approach to immunotherapy using both CTLA-4 blockade and nonlymphodepletional ACT could offer additive therapeutic benefit. C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with syngeneic B16F10 melanoma tumors transfected to express low levels of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus peptide GP33 (B16GP33), and treated with no immunotherapy, CTLA-4 blockade, ACT, or combination immunotherapy of CTLA-4 blockade with ACT. Combination immunotherapy resulted in optimal control of B16GP33 melanoma tumors. Combination immunotherapy promoted a stronger local immune response reflected by enhanced tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte populations, and a stronger systemic immune responses reflected by more potent tumor antigen-specific T-cell activity in splenocytes. In addition, whereas both CTLA-4 blockade and combination immunotherapy were able to promote long-term immunity against B16GP33 tumors, only combination immunotherapy was capable of promoting immunity against parental B16F10 tumors as well. Our findings suggest that a combinatorial approach using CTLA-4 blockade with nonlymphodepletional ACT may promote additive endogenous and exogenous T-cell activities that enable greater therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of melanoma.

Four predominantly CD8+ and two mixed CD4+, CD8+ population TIL cultures were tested for lysis in short-term 51Cr-release assays against a panel of targets including 29 fresh melanomas, 2 fresh sarcomas, 11 cultured melanoma lines, and 14 nonmelanoma cell lines derived from HLA-typed patients. All six melanoma TILs lysed the autologous melanoma. Two of three TILs from HLA-A2+ patients lysed allogeneic melanomas matched for HLA-A2, giving evidence for shared tumor Ag; one of these TILs also used HLA-B44 as a restriction element. The third HLA-A2+ TIL lysed autologous melanoma but not autologous Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells nor 14 HLA-A2 matched allogeneic melanomas, suggesting the possibility of a unique tumor Ag in this system. The three HLA-A2- TILs each lysed multiple HLA-matched melanomas, using HLA-A24, HLA-A31, and HLA-Cw7 as restriction elements. Blocking of autologous and allogeneic melanoma lysis by TILs with mAb w6/32 (anti-MHC class I) and anti-CD3, as well as cold target inhibition assays, confirmed that specific interaction of the T-cell receptor with MHC class I Ag and the relevant tumor Ag on the target cell surface is required for tumor lysis.

The effectiveness of LHT applied into the tumor of B16F10 melanoma-bearing C57/BL6 mice was compared with anesthetized and non-treated animals. Subpopulations of leukocytes were analyzed using the flow cytometry, and the cytotoxic activity of splenocytes against syngeneic B16F10 melanoma and NK-sensitive YAC-1 tumor cell lines was evaluated in (51)Cr-release assay. Similarly, the in vitro modification of the heat treatment was performed using healthy and melanoma-bearing splenocytes. We found a 40 % increase of activated monocytes (CD11b+CD69+) infiltration into the tumor microenvironment. In the spleen of experimental animals, the numbers of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs-CD3+CD8+) and NK cell (CD49b+NK1.1+) raised by 22 % and 14 %, respectively, while the NK1.1+ monocytes decreases by 37 %. This was accompanied by an enhancement of cytotoxic effector function against B16F10 and YAC-1 targets in both in vivo and in vitro conditions. These results demonstrate that LHT induces better killing of syngeneic melanoma targets. Furthermore, LHT evokes the homing of activated monocytes into the tumor microenvironment and increases the counts of NK cells and CTL in the spleen.",

The expression of melanoma antigens (MAs) was assessed in fresh melanoma FNAB samples and from tumor cell lines derived from these samples using several different approaches. Cytospin preparations of freshly isolated tumor cell explants were analyzed by immunocytochemistry (ICC), while the daughter cell line was analyzed by fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, and semiquantitative and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR, qRT-PCR). As assessed by these methods, the level of MA expression by the original tumor cell explants correlated with the expression in established in vitro cell lines. Molecular analysis of the established cell lines utilizing PCR technology improved the sensitivity of detection of MA expression. Thus FNAB of melanoma is an efficient and effective method of tissue procurement, capable of generating, sequentially and from the same lesion, fresh tumor cells, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), and long-term melanoma cell lines.",

Dead feeder cells disappeared during the last phase of the lymphocyte culture with rIL-2. Interestingly, each time they were expanded under these conditions, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) or lymph-node lymphocytes developed a lytic activity apparently restricted to the autologous melanoma line. Tumor-specific lysis, which was maximum at around the end of T-lymphocyte expansion, ranged between 31-63% lysis at an effector:target (E:T) ratio of 20:1.

The action of interferon (IFN)-alpha, -beta, and -gamma has been extensively examined in melanoma and melanocyte cultures in vitro, and increasing information on the action of other cytokines is now available. All IFNs revealed a dose-dependent antiproliferative effect on melanoma cells with the highest growth inhibition caused by IFN-beta. Proliferation was also inhibited by interleukin (IL) 1-alpha and -beta, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. For IL-4, both growth-stimulatory and -inhibitory properties have been reported. Cellular differentiation in terms of melanin synthesis, formation of dendritelike structures, and antigenic changes was not affected by IFN-alpha or -beta. IFN-gamma, however, induced a more dedifferentiated and biologically more aggressive phenotype of melanoma cells. Histocompatibility antigen (HLA) class I molecules were found upregulated by all IFNs and by TNF-alpha, associated with a marked increase of melanoma cell lysis by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in vitro. HLA class II molecules were de novo expressed or enhanced by IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. The adhesion molecules ICAM-1, LFA-3, and VLA-2 were upregulated by IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-1-beta, whereas melanoma-associated antigens were hardly affected by cytokines. It seems that both antiproliferative and immunomodulatory effects may contribute to the antitumoral activity of cytokines in vivo. In vivo application of cytokines as well as combinations with cytotoxic drugs, therefore, may be promising for future treatment strategies.",

The prognostic significance of regression remains controversial in cutaneous melanoma patients. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical significance of the histological regression status in patients with cutaneous melanoma. A total of 664 patients with a pathologically confirmed cutaneous melanoma were enrolled into this study and were investigated retrospectively. The median age of the patients was 51 years, ranging in age from 16 to 104 years. The majority of them had lesions without regression (n=495; 74.5%) and others had lesions with regression (n=169; 25.5%). Melanoma patients with regression were more frequently males (60.1 vs 51.7%; P=0.038) and had axial localized lesions (67.5 vs 53.7%; P=0.002), superficial spreading histologic subtype (73.2 vs 49.1%; P=0.000), thin Breslow depth (<2 mm) (44.6 vs 33.5%; P=0.01), and the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (74.4 vs 60.0%; P=0.001) than those without regression. However, regression was not significantly associated with age, Clark level, mitotic rate, ulceration, vertical growth phase, neurotropism, lymphovascular invasion, nor association with a pre-existing melanocytic nevus. Similarly, no significant correlations were found between regression and lymph node involvement, recurrence, nor metastasis of disease. Patients with, nodular pathology, advanced Clark invasion level (IV-V), thick Breslow depth (≥2 mm), high mitotic rate (>3/mm), ulceration, vertical growth phase, neurotropism, lymphovascular invasion, lymph node involvement, metastasis, and recurrence of disease, and male patients had poor prognostic variables for both relapse-free survival and overall survival. However, the presence of regression was not associated with relapse-free survival (P=0.093) nor overall survival (P=0.113) similar to other factors such as age, tumor localization, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and association with a pre-existing melanocytic nevus. Similar insignificant P values were also observed in multivariate analyses (P=0.115 and 0.816, respectively).

Patients with metastatic melanoma were treated in four dosing cohorts of ipilimumab (3 or 10 mg/kg) with four doses at 3-week intervals and then every 12 weeks, and bevacizumab (7.5 or 15 mg/kg) every 3 weeks.

In this study, we demonstrated that melanoma cells control anti-melanoma CTL responses via the TIGIT-CD155 interaction in the effector phase. TIGIT is an inhibitory receptor expressed on T cells, and CD155 is one of the cognate ligands expressed on the tumor cells or antigen-presenting cells. First, we confirmed that CD155 was constitutively expressed on melanoma cells. We then demonstrated that CD155 on melanoma cells suppressed cytokine release from melanoma-specific CTLs via interaction with TIGIT. Overexpression of CD155 enhanced, and its downregulation attenuated the suppressive effect. This suggested that anti-melanoma CTL responses are controlled not only by an imbalance in CD226 (an activating molecule binds to CD155) and TIGIT expression on T cells but also by the expression levels of CD155 on melanoma cells. In addition, co-blockade of TIGIT and PD-1 signals synergistically elicited a response of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) on autologous melanoma cells. These results suggest that the CD155-TIGIT interaction should be blocked for enhancement of anti-melanoma immune responses.Journal of Investigative Dermatology accepted article preview online, 12 October 2015. doi:10.1038/jid.2015.404.",

However, the actual benefit by those cellular efforts is questionable. Why can early melanoma lesions actually develop in the face of rapid innate responses, and why is neutrophil- and macrophage-attracting chemokine secretion observed in melanoma? A surprisingly similar choice of chemokine receptors and chemokines are present in both innate immune cells and melanoma. Here we focus on analogies and differences between the two. Melanoma cell clusters show active chemokine signalling, with mostly tumor growth-enhancing and leukocyte-attracting effects. However, infiltrating leukocytes have only weak tumoricidal effects. Therefore, the observed leukocyte infiltration in melanoma might be at least in part an epiphenomenon of neoplastic self-stimulation rather than a full-fledged innate anti-tumor immune response.",

To establish the characteristics of Fas ligand expression during the course of melanoma progression we performed a longitudinal study analyzing primary tumors as well as subsequently evolving metastases. In primary melanoma Fas ligand was expressed in two of 20 lesions; this expression was weak and restricted to few parts of the tumors. The Fas ligand positive primary melanomas were rather thick, i.e., 8.5 and 3.8 mm, versus a median of 2.4 mm of the remaining tumors. In contrast, for metastatic melanoma Fas ligand expression was present in six of 11 cases investigated. The metastases of primary tumors displaying Fas ligand maintained its expression. As Fas ligand positive melanoma cells are capable of inducing apoptosis in susceptible cells, e.g., Fas positive tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, we tested for the presence of apoptotic cells in situ by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling. This analysis revealed that apoptotic cells were present within the Fas ligand positive tumors. The number of apoptotic cells, however, never exceeded 5% of the total cells. Thus, Fas ligand mediated apoptosis does not seem to be a major immune escape mechanism for melanoma but its expression correlates with the stage of melanoma.",

Here we present histochemical evidence that human and murine melanomas are extensively infiltrated by abundant mast cells. Because mast cells contain the natural anticoagulant heparin, the present studies were aimed at defining the role of mast cell heparin in preventing the blood from clotting within B16 melanoma grafts in C57BL/6 J mice. Mice bearing B16 melanoma grafts were treated with non-specific or specific inhibitors of mast cell heparin (protamine or heparinase, respectively). After the drug treatment there was histologic and functional evidence of selective thrombosis of the blood vessels within the protamine and heparinase treated melanoma grafts. A similar, high degree of thrombosis was also observed in B16 tumors grown in transgenic NDST-2 knockout mice bearing a targeted disruption in the gene coding for mast cell heparin synthesis. The tumors grown in the protamine-treated animals were significantly smaller than the tumors from control (untreated mice). By contrast, the tumors treated with heparinase or grown in the NDST-2 knockout mice were significantly larger than the tumors from control (untreated) mice. We conclude that the intrinsic procoagulant properties of malignant melanoma are neutralized in vivo by the anticoagulant properties of endogenous heparin produced by mast cells that naturally infiltrate the tumor.

However, the molecular signals that regulate the dialogue between malignant cells and the inflammatory microenvironment remain poorly understood.

The present study aimed at defining the role of tumor SK1 in the recruitment and differentiation of macrophages in melanoma. Herein, we show that downregulation of SK1 in melanoma cells causes a reduction in the percentage of CD206highMHCIIlow M2 macrophages in favor of an increased proportion of CD206lowMHCIIhigh M1 macrophages into the tumor. This macrophage differentiation orchestrates T lymphocyte recruitment as well as tumor rejection through the expression of Th1 cytokines and chemokines. In vitro experiments indicated that macrophage migration is triggered by the binding of tumor S1P to S1PR1 receptors present on macrophages whereas macrophage differentiation is stimulated by SK1-induced secretion of TGF-β1. Finally, RNA-seq analysis of human melanoma tumors revealed a positive correlation between SK1 and TGF-β1 expression. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that melanoma SK1 plays a key role in the recruitment and phenotypic shift of the tumor macrophages that promote melanoma growth.",

Mutational screening of the tumor revealed a number of driver mutations in oncogenes which enabled melanoma classification into a few molecular subtypes. BRAF is a key component of mitogen-activated kinase pathway; its activating mutation leads to accelerated melanoma cells proliferation, invasion and survival. Somatic mutations in BRAF were reported in various malignancies, including thyroid cancer, colorectal cancer and melanoma. Specific features of BRAF-positive tumors could have clinical implications as mutational alterations may have an impact on the biological behavior of the tumor and prognosis of the disease. In the present study, the frequency of BRAF V600E mutation was evaluated in Russian patients with melanocytic lesions, of which 41.25% were primary melanoma and 60% were melanocytic nevi. Melanoma patients with trunk localization were of younger age in the BRAF-positive group as compared with BRAF-negative patients. Immunohistochemical evaluations of Ki-67 expression, as well as matrix metalloproteinase-2, -9, were found to be equal in BRAF-positive and BRAF-negative tumors. MMP-2/MMP-9 immunoreactivity was observed in stromal and/or melanocytic cells both in melanoma and nevi patients. Besides tumor cells, MMP-9 expression was observed in lymphocytes in 27.2% of BRAF-positive and in 19.1% of BRAF-negative patients. Histopathological prognostic markers (Breslow thickness, mitotic index, ulceration, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes pattern) did not show any differences depending on BRAF V600E mutational status. The frequency of BRAF-positive melanomas in Russian cohort is similar to other Caucasian population rates.

Here, we used the unique features of the genetically engineered Hgf-Cdk4(R24C) mouse model to identify a combination chemoimmunotherapy for melanoma. These mice develop primary cutaneous melanomas which grow progressively and metastasize in the absence of immunogenic foreign proteins such as oncogenes or antigens. Primary and metastatic tumors evade innate and adaptive immune defenses, although they naturally express melanocytic antigens which can be recognized by antigen-specific T cells. We found that primary melanomas continued to grow despite infiltration with adoptively transferred, in vivo-activated, tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells. To promote tumor immune defense, we developed a treatment protocol consisting of four complementary components: (a) chemotherapeutic preconditioning prior to (b) adoptive lymphocyte transfer and (c) viral vaccination followed by (d) adjuvant peritumoral injections of immunostimulatory nucleic acids. Lymphocyte ablation and innate antiviral immune stimulation cooperatively enhanced the expansion and the effector cell differentiation of adoptively transferred lymphocytes. The efficacy of the different treatment approaches converged in the tumor microenvironment and induced a strong cytotoxic inflammatory response enabling preferential recognition and destruction of melanoma cells. This combination chemoimmunotherapy caused complete regression of advanced primary melanomas in the skin and metastases in the lung with minimal autoimmune side effects. Our results in a clinically highly relevant experimental model provide a scientific rationale to evaluate similar strategies which unleash the power of innate and adaptive immune defense in future clinical trials.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Despite their well-documented immunogenicity, malignant melanomas belong to the most aggressive tumor types. A potential explanation for this is the suboptimal activation of tumor infiltrating T cells. In order to boost immune responses against tumors, a variety of treatment modalities have been tested in animal models and in clinical setting. Antigen-nonspecific approaches (e.g., IFN-alpha and IL-2), as well as active specific immunotherapeutical modalities based on the use of autologous or allogeneic tumor cell-save been investigated in clinical trials of melanoma. The identification of melanoma-associated antigens has opened new avenues in antigen-specific immunotherapy. A promising alternative for the delivery of different forms of melanoma antigens is the application of dendritic cells, the most potent antigen presenting cells capable of eliciting efficient T-cell response. Beside active immunotherapy, immune response against melanoma antigens could be increased through the adoptive transfer of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes or antigen specific T-cell clones. The most important conclusion that can be drawn from the results of published immunotherapy studies is that these modalities are able to induce durable complete tumor regressions,mostly with reasonable toxicity; however, generally only in a minority of patients. This points to the importance of appropriate patient selection, with regard to the expression of the targeted antigens and HLA molecules, as well as to the general immunocompetence of the patients. A crucial and still unsolved question is monitoring immune activation during treatment, although there are promising new tools that could prove useful in this respect. The presence of tumor-reactive CTL in the circulation or in the tumors does not guarantee an efficient immune response. It is important to assess if these T cells are in an activated and functional state. Finally, in several single target antigen-based clinical studies a therapy-induced immunoselection of antigen-negative clones, leading to disease progression, was observed. This could be overcome with the use of antigen cocktails or whole tumor approaches. A better understanding of the mechanisms of action of immunotherapeutical modalities may enhance the success rate of these strategies.",

This was investigated in the HLA-A2 system. Four T-cell lines were established by stimulation of lymphocytes with either autologous tumor or an HLA-A2-matched allogeneic melanoma. Allogeneic stimulated CTLs specifically lysed the autologous tumor and demonstrated an identical pattern of HLA-A2 restriction, when compared to the autologous stimulated CTLs. Lysis by the allogeneic stimulated CTLs was blocked by a monoclonal antibody to HLA class I antigens; lysis was also inhibited by both autologous tumor or HLA-A2 allogeneic melanomas when evaluated in cold target competition studies. The allogeneic stimulated CTLs proliferated in response to both autologous tumor and HLA-A2 melanomas, but not in response to HLA-A2 nonmelanomas. By phenotypic analysis these CTLs were CD3+ and predominantly CD8+ cells. We conclude that autologous tumor-specific CTLs can be generated using HLA-A region-matched allogeneic melanomas for stimulation.

The limited clinical success has not been encouraging, although this might be explained by poor TIL specificity and/or high tumor burden. To re-evaluate the effectiveness of adoptive therapy, we analyzed the capacity of tumor-reactive TIL injection in preventing the further development of disease in stage III melanoma patients after complete tumor resection. A phase II/III randomized trial was performed on 88 melanoma patients, who received autologous TIL plus interleukin-2 (IL-2) or IL-2 only. The duration of relapse-free survival was analyzed, taking into account the immunological specificity of injected TIL and the number of metastatic lymph nodes removed before treatment. Kaplan-Meyer analysis revealed that the injection of tumor-reactive TIL was statistically correlated with prolonged relapse-free survival in patients with only one metastatic lymph node. Therefore, improved clinical outcome could be obtained after adoptive therapy by selecting appropriate groups of patients and monitoring the specificity of the injected TIL populations.",

Lymphatic vessel alterations were examined using B16-F10 melanoma cells implanted in syngeneic C57Bl/6 mice, which form tumors metastasizing to draining lymph nodes and subsequently to the lungs. Footpad tumors showed no lymphatic or blood vessel growth; however, the tumor-draining popliteal lymph node featured greatly increased lymphatic sinuses. Lymph node lymphangiogenesis began before melanoma cells reached draining lymph nodes, indicating that primary tumors induce these alterations at a distance. Lymph flow imaging revealed that nanoparticle transit was greatly increased through tumor-draining relative to nondraining lymph nodes. Lymph node lymphatic sinuses and lymph flow were increased in mice implanted with unmarked or with foreign antigen-expressing melanomas, indicating that these effects are not due to foreign antigen expression. However, tumor-derived immune signaling could promote lymph node alterations, as macrophages infiltrated footpad tumors, whereas lymphocytes accumulated in tumor-draining lymph nodes. B lymphocytes are required for lymphangiogenesis and increased lymph flow through tumor-draining lymph nodes, as these alterations were not observed in mice deficient for B cells.

SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 2 (SOX2) is an embryonic stem cell transcription factor that has recently been discovered to be expressed in human melanoma where it is associated with dermal invasion and primary tumor thickness. To assess the potential role of SOX2 expression in melanoma invasion, we examined patient melanomas and humanized melanoma xenografts, and noted preferential SOX2 expression in cells that interfaced and infiltrated dermal stroma. Experimental knockdown (KD) of SOX2 mRNA and protein in A2058 melanoma cells with high constitutive SOX2 expression resulted in 4.5-fold decreased invasiveness in vitro compared with controls (P<0.0001). Conversely, when G361 cells that normally express low SOX2 were transduced to overexpress SOX2 mRNA and protein, a 3.8-fold increase in invasiveness was observed (P=0.0004). Among 84 invasion-related genes, RT-PCR screening revealed that SOX2 KD resulted in striking decrease in matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), an endopeptidase associated with cleavage of the extracellular matrix. Quantitatively, SOX2 KD diminished MMP-3 mRNA by 87.8%. MMP-3 KD in SOX2-expressing A2058 cells served to inhibit invasion, although to a lesser degree than SOX2 KD. Finally, immunostaining of patient and xenograft melanomas revealed coordinate SOX2 and MMP-3 expression in regions of stromal infiltration. These data implicate SOX2 expression in melanoma invasion, and suggest a role for MMP-3 as one potential mediator of this process.",

Patients' lymphocytes, however, were significantly stimulated by allogeneic irradiated lymphocytes and by interleukin 2. To investigate whether the lack of autologous stimulation was restricted to metastatic cells, the immune response of patients with only primary lesions of malignant melanoma was evaluated. It was found that primary melanoma cells were able to induce proliferation in 7 out of 9 (77%) patients, whereas positive cytotoxicity was obtained in 2 out of 4 patients tested. In order to see whether the presence of DR molecules was important for the stimulatory activity, melanoma cells were examined for the expression of DR antigens by indirect immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies. Positive autologous MLTC was found in all of six DR+ primary melanomas, whereas the two DR-tumors were unable to stimulate autologous lymphocytes. An anti-DR but not an anti-DC monoclonal antibody was able to block the proliferation of lymphocytes induced by an autologous primary melanoma. Neither MLTC nor cell-mediated killing was obtained with either DR+ or DR-metastatic melanoma. In 60% of the cases tested, however, DR+ metastatic melanoma cells were able to stimulate allogeneic lymphocytes of normal individuals. Increased expression of DR antigens was induced by in vitro treatment with human gamma-interferon in metastatic tumor cells; this caused an increase in the proliferation of allogeneic but not autologous lymphocytes. These findings indicate that primary but not metastatic DR+ melanoma cells are able to activate the proliferation and cytotoxicity of autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes, suggesting a potential role of DR antigens in regulating tumor-host relationships in melanoma patients.",

Similarly to their CD8(+) counterparts, intra-tumor DP T cells are MHC class-I restricted but differed by a limited lytic activity against autologous melanoma cells. Based on these observations and to further characterize DP T cells, both populations were compared at the transcriptional level. Our results revealed the overexpression of the IL-9 receptor (IL-9R) by DP T cells and prompted us to investigate the impact of IL-9 on their biology. We show that IL-9 favors DP T-cell survival by protecting them from apoptosis and by promoting their proliferation. In addition, IL-9 enhances their ability to produce cytokines and increased their levels of granzyme B/perforin as well as degranulation capacity, leading to a strengthened cytotoxic activity against melanoma cells. Taken together, the IL-9R(high) DP T-cell population could be a new preferential target for IL-9, which could take part in their retention within the melanoma infiltrate while also favoring their anti-tumor activity. More generally, our results extend the pleiotropic effects of IL-9 to IL-9R-expressing intra-tumor T cells, which could further potentiate anti-tumor immune responses. ",

Immunotherapy and recently introduced gene therapy have revolutionized the treatments of patients with metastatic melanoma tumor. Use of biological response modifiers, such as interleukins and interferons, have been found to enhance therapeutic benefits to patients with malignant melanoma. Initial studies with a high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy have proved effective in patients with melanoma tumor, although a variety of systemic toxicities were observed. A low-dose IL-2 continuous infusion has shown a similar response in patients with melanoma tumor, but produced lesser toxicity. The low-dose IL-2 therapy has been studied with an adoptive transfer combined with either autologous lymphokine activated killer cells or autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). IL-2 in combination with chemotherapeutic agents such as flavone acetic acid, dacarbazine, and cyclophosphamide have also been studied in patients with metastatic melanoma. Results have shown a moderate response in patients with metastatic melanoma. TIL therapy, however, has been shown to result in higher objective regression due to potent tumor-specific killing and tumor-specific targeting characters of the TIL. The tumor targeting nature of the TIL creates the possibility of using TIL as a vehicle to deliver gene product specifically to tumor tissue. Safety and toxicity of gene-transduced TIL were addressed by the use of neomycin-resistant, gene-transduced TIL in patients with metastatic melanoma.

The weak immunogenicity of nascent tumors contributes to this failure in host defense. Therapeutic vaccines that enhance dendritic cell presentation of cancer antigens increase specific cellular and humoral responses, thereby effectuating tumor destruction in some cases. The attenuation of T cell activation by cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) further limits the potency of tumor immunity. In murine systems, the administration of antibodies that block CTLA-4 function inhibits the growth of moderately immunogenic tumors and, in combination with cancer vaccines, increases the rejection of poorly immunogenic tumors, albeit with a loss of tolerance to normal differentiation antigens. To gain a preliminary assessment of the biologic activity of antagonizing CTLA-4 function in humans, we infused a CTLA-4 blocking antibody (MDX-CTLA4) into nine previously immunized advanced cancer patients. MDX-CTLA4 stimulated extensive tumor necrosis with lymphocyte and granulocyte infiltrates in three of three metastatic melanoma patients and the reduction or stabilization of CA-125 levels in two of two metastatic ovarian carcinoma patients previously vaccinated with irradiated, autologous granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-secreting tumor cells. MDX-CTLA4 did not elicit tumor necrosis in four of four metastatic melanoma patients previously immunized with defined melanosomal antigens. No serious toxicities directly attributable to the antibody were observed, although five of seven melanoma patients developed T cell reactivity to normal melanocytes.

Eighteen of 35 patients treated with tumor-reactive lymphocyte cultures experienced an objective clinical response (>50% reduction in tumor), including four complete responders. In some patients, tumor regression was accompanied by a large in vivo expansion of the administered antitumor lymphocytes, which persisted in peripheral blood at >70% of total lymphocytes for many months after transfer. The cells capable of mediating tumor regression consisted of heterogeneous lymphocyte populations with high avidity for tumor antigens that were derived from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes cultured for limited times in vitro. The success of this treatment likely results from the ability to infuse large numbers of activated antitumor lymphocytes into an appropriate host homeostatic environment depleted of regulatory T cells. These studies are elucidating the requirements for successful immunotherapy of patients with advanced metastatic disease and are leading to additional clinical trials with gene-modified lymphocytes.",

However, it still remains to be demonstrated whether the capacity of melanoma cells to express CD95L is acquired during the progression. We addressed this question with a case of acral lentiginous melanoma by employing immunostaining using an antibody directed against CD95L as well as by in situ TUNEL staining. H&E-staining of tumor specimens revealed that there were two different growth patterns. The central part of the tumor showed a deeper invasion into the dermis (Breslow thickness >4 -mm). The horizontally growing edge of the tumor proliferated more superficially (Breslow thickness<3-mm). Relatively fewer lymphocytes were observed around the melanoma nests in central areas, which expressed detectable amounts of CD95L. In contrast, more lymphocytes were observed among the melanoma cells in the peripheral lesion, where CD95L was not detected. To evaluate the relevance of the CD95L expression, in situ TUNEL staining was performed. This indicated a significant correlation of lymphocyte apoptosis with CD95L expression on melanoma cells. Together the data suggest that expression of CD95L is turned on depending on the level of melanoma, and that it may tribute to creating immune privileged circumstances by initiating apoptosis of tumor filrating lymphocytes.",

Within 1 hour of incubation, monocytes and lymphocytes were seen attached to approximately 40 per cent of the melanoma cells with marked interdigitation of cellular processes. After 4 hours of incubation, the percentage of tumor cells with attached leukocytes remained the same, but 2 to 9 per cent of the melanoma cells showed interiorized lymphocytes when kept in suspension, 10 to 25 per cent when maintained in culture dishes. Erythrocytes or fixed lymphocytes were not taken up by the melanoma cells nor were living lymphocytes seen in fibroblasts or endothelial cells which served as controls for the neoplastic cell lines. Thus, melanoma cells did not prove to be randomly phagocytic, and the interiorization displayed by lymphocytes--a process called emperipolesis--appears to be selective.

To study this discrepancy, we analyzed CTL reactivity in a melanoma patient (F001) vaccinated with g209-2M peptide, a single residue variant of gp100(209-217). G209/g209-2M-reactive CTL were identified in post- but not prevaccination PBL. Limiting dilution analysis identified one predominant CTL clone (C1-35), with TCR Vbeta6s2, recognizing g209/HLA-A*0201-expressing targets. Additionally, two autologous melanoma lines (F001TU-3 and -4) and 20 separate tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte cultures were generated from a fine needle aspirate of a metastatic lesion progressing after initial response to vaccination. Both F001TU did not express gp100 and were not recognized by C1-35. Loss of gp100 by F001TU correlated with a marked reduction of gp100 expression in the same metastatic lesion compared with prevaccination. Thus, ineffectiveness of C1-35 and tumor progression could be best explained by loss of target Ag expression. Interestingly, 12 of 20 tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte cultures recognized F001TU, but none demonstrated g209/g209-2M reactivity, suggesting a functional dissociation between systemic and local immune response.

Here, we show that a subset of B lymphocytes (termed B-1 population), but not other lymphocytes, has prometastatic effects on melanoma cells in vivo through a direct heterotypic cell-cell interaction. In the classic B16 mouse melanoma model, one mechanism underlying this phenomenon is a specific up-regulation and subsequent homophilic interaction mediated by the cell surface glycoprotein MUC18 (also known as melanoma cell adhesion molecule). Presence of B-1 lymphocytes in a panel of tumor samples from melanoma patients directly correlates with MUC18 expression in melanoma cells, indicating that the same protein interaction exists in humans. These results suggest a new but as yet unrecognized functional role for host B-1 lymphocytes in tumor metastasis and establish a biochemical basis for such observations. Our findings support the counterintuitive central hypothesis in which a primitive layer of the immune system actually contributes to tumor progression and metastasis in a mouse model and in melanoma patients.

Antibody inhibition studies showed that two of these TIL clones were restricted by an HLA-A2 molecule which was identified as A2.1 by gene sequencing. The third CTL clone was not restricted by HLA-A2, but by a B or C HLA antigen. HLA-A2-restricted CTL clones M17-1 and M17-2 lysed 5 and 12 out of 15 HLA-A2+ allogeneic melanomas, respectively. Since they did not lyse autologous Epstein-Barr virus B cells, HLA-A2.1-transfected P815 cells, 13 HLA-A2+ non-melanoma tumor cell lines and 10 HLA-A2- melanomas, these clones appeared specific for melanoma-restricted epitopes presented by the HLA-A2.1 molecule. We then tried to determine why a few HLA-A2+ melanomas were refractory to TIL lysis. By using a combination of flow cytometry analysis, partial cloning and sequencing of their HLA-A2 genes, we show that failure to lyse did not result from low expression or polymorphism of the HLA-A2 molecule, or from deficient expression of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and LFA-3 by these melanomas. Taken together, our data confirm at the clonal level the existence of shared melanoma antigens recognized by TIL in the HLA-A2.1 context.

Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) are thought to play a crucial rôle in tumor immunosurveillance. In malignant melanoma expression and secretion of monocyte-chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) have been demonstrated. MCP-1 serves as an attractant for monocytes and activated T-cells. In this study we addressed the question whether circulating monocytes show altered chemotaxis to MCP-1. Therefore the chemotactic responsiveness of monocytes towards MCP-1 was investigated in patients with primary and metastatic melanoma and compared to patients with basal cell carcinoma and healthy persons. The results show that monocytes from melanoma patients showed a significantly decreased chemotactic migration towards MCP-1 while chemotaxis to the stimulus N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) remained normal. Patients with basal cell carcinoma showed normal monocyte chemotaxis to all stimuli tested. In primary melanoma, there was no relation of the number of TAM or TIL to the decreased chemotaxis of circulating monocytes to MCP-1. From these data it can be concluded that circulating monocytes from patients with primary and metastatic melanoma show a MCP-1-specific decrease in chemotactic migration. This may be due to deactivation or modulation of the MCP-1-receptor expression on these cells.",

However, efficacy of these treatments has been hampered by inhibitory effects exerted on tumor-infiltrating TCs by tumor-intrinsic mediators or by recruitment of immunosuppressive cells. A mouse model of autochthonous melanoma recapitulates some aspects of inflammatory melanoma development in patients. These include a systemic Th2-/Th17-oriented chronic inflammation, recruitment of immunosuppressive myeloid cells and acquisition by tumor-infiltrating TCs of an 'exhausted' phenotype characterized by expression of multiple inhibitory receptors including programmed death-1, also expressed on patients' melanoma-infiltrating TCs. Rather than using extracellular blocking reagents to inhibitory surface molecules on TCs, we sought to dampen negative signaling exerted on them. Adoptively transferred TCs presenting increased cytokine receptor signaling due to expression of an active Stat5 transcription factor were efficient at inducing melanoma regression in the preclinical melanoma model. These transferred TCs thrived and retained expression of effector molecules in the melanoma microenvironment, defining a protocol endowing TCs with the ability to resist melanoma-induced immunosuppression.",

Pathway enrichment using MetaCore (trademark) from GeneGo, a Thompson Reuters company, showed that TIMP2 and CD44 were expressed more frequently within Cluster 2 patients, suggesting a potential association with TILs.

In current practice, most patients with BRAF V600 mutant melanomas will see both modalities. Several in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that combining immunotherapy with MAPK inhibition may have synergistic effects. First, mouse models show that adoptive cell therapy (ACT) can be enhanced by vaccination. Rapid tumor destruction by vemurafenib could provide a vaccine-like stimulus to adoptively transferred T cells. Second, both in mice and in early clinical trials, melanoma metastases treated with MAPK inhibitors seem to display increased T-cell infiltrates. Third, MAPK inhibition upregulates the expression of some melanoma antigens and, therefore, may enhance T-cell recognition of vemurafenib-treated melanomas. Fourth, vemurafenib may sensitize tumor cells to immune destruction. Finally, some investigators have found that an optimal antitumor effect from MAPK inhibition is dependent on an intact host immune response. Currently, the Surgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute has initiated a phase II trial combining the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib with ACT using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in patients with BRAF-mutant tumors to investigate the safety and efficacy of this combination. The proposed mechanisms for synergy between these two modalities can be complex, and their optimal combination may require testing a variety of sequences and schedules.",

Four broad histologic patterns of recurrent nevus were identified and classified into type 1: junctional melanocytic hyperplasia with effacement of the retiform epidermis and associated dermal scar, type 2: compound melanocytic proliferation with effacement of the retiform epidermis and associated dermal scar, type 3: junctional melanocytic hyperplasia with retention of the retiform epidermis, and type 4: compound melanocytic hyperplasia with retention of the retiform epidermis and scar.

Type 3 recurrent nevi resembled primary melanoma with scar/fibrosis. Histologically, the vast majority of recurrent nevi are readily identifiable; however, partial biopsies or cases without prior knowledge of the original biopsy may lead to misdiagnosis.

The aim of this study was to investigate independent prognostic factors for melanoma mortality. We carried out a 10-year cohort study on 4133 melanoma patients from the same geographic area (Lazio) with primary cutaneous melanoma diagnosed between January 1998 and December 2008. The probability of survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods and prognostic factors were evaluated by multivariate analysis (Cox proportional hazards model). The 10-year survival rate for melanoma decreased with increasing Breslow thickness (Pfor trend<0.0001) and with age (Pfor trend<0.0001) whereas survival increased with increasing levels of TILs (Pfor trend=0.0001). The 10-year survival rate for melanoma divided into TILs intensity as scanty, moderate, and marked was 88.0, 92.2, and 97.0%, respectively. In the multivariate Cox model, the presence of high levels of TILs in primary invasive melanomas was associated with a lower risk of melanoma death (hazard ratio 0.32; 95% confidence interval 0.13-0.82) after controlling for sex, age, Breslow thickness, histological type, mitotic rate, and ulceration. After including lymph node status in the multivariate analysis, the protective effect of marked TILs on melanoma mortality remained (hazard ratio 0.37; 95% confidence interval 0.15-0.94).

The highest percentage of HLA-DR-positive tumors was found in the group of melanomas invading the reticular dermis (level IV). The majority of tumors (18/24) that had metastasized within an observation period of 0-32 months were HLA-DR-positive. Regarding the mononuclear cell infiltrate, no correlation between the degree of overall infiltrate and the expression of HLA-DR by the tumor cells was found. The infiltrate within the tumor, however, was more often marked in HLA-DR-positive than in HLA-DR-negative melanomas.",

This clone recognized all melanoma cell lines tested and, to a lower extent, melanocytes, in the context of human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen A2 (HLA-A2), but it did not recognize other tumor cell types. The gene coding for the antigen recognized by this clone was identified by the screening of a melanoma complementary DNA expression library. This antigen is overexpressed in melanomas, compared with other cancer cell lines and healthy tissues, and was thus called melanoma-overexpressed antigen (meloe). Remarkably, the structure of meloe was unusual, with multiple short open reading frames (ORFs). The peptide recognized by the CTL clone was encoded by one of these ORFs, called MELOE-1. Using a specific HLA-A2/peptide tetramer, we showed a correlation between the infusion of TILs containing MELOE-1-specific T cells and relapse prevention in HLA-A2 patients. Indeed, 5 out of 9 patients who did not relapse were infused with TILs that contained MELOE-1-specific T cells, whereas 0 out of the 21 patients who relapsed was infused with such TIL-containing lymphocytes. Overall, our results suggest that this new antigen is involved in immunosurveillance and, thus, represents an attractive target for immunotherapy protocols of melanoma.",

However, the majority of patients receiving BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) manifest disease progression within a year. We have recently shown that melanoma patients treated with BRAFi exhibit an increase in melanoma-associated antigens and in CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in response to therapy. To characterize such a T-cell infiltrate, we analyzed the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of rearranged T-cell receptor (TCR) β chain-coding genes in tumor biopsies obtained before the initiation of BRAFi and 10-14 d later. We observed an increase in the clonality of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in 7 of 8 patients receiving BRAFi, with a statistically significant 21% aggregate increase in clonality. Over 80% of individual T-cell clones detected after initiation of BRAFi treatment were new clones. Interestingly, the comparison of tumor infiltrates with clinical responses revealed that patients who had a high proportion of pre-existing dominant clones after the administration of BRAFi responded better to therapy than patients who had a low proportion of such pre-existing dominant clones following BRAFi.

The efficacy of anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 antibodies, anti-programmed cell death 1 antibodies, and the BRAF(V600E) kinase inhibitor has been proven in metastatic melanoma. At the same time, adoptive cell transfer has significant effects against metastatic melanoma; however, it is difficult to apply on a broad scale because of the problems related to cell preparation. To overcome these problems, we developed immune cell therapy using induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. The benefit of our method is that a large number of cells can be readily obtained. We focused on macrophages for immune cell therapy because macrophage infiltration is frequently observed in solid cancers. In this study, the efficacy of human iPS cell-derived myeloid cell lines (iPS-ML) genetically modified to express type I IFNs against human melanoma cells was examined. The morphology, phagocytic ability, and surface markers of iPS-ML were similar to those of macrophages. The iPS-ML that express type I IFNs (iPS-ML-IFN) showed significant effects in inhibiting the growth of disseminated human melanoma cells in SCID mice. The infiltration of iPS-ML into the tumor nests was confirmed immunohistologically. The iPS-ML-IFNs increased the expression of CD169, a marker of M1 macrophages that can activate antitumor immunity. The iPS-ML-IFNs could infiltrate into tumor tissue and exert anticancer effects in the local tumor tissue. In conclusion, this method will provide a new therapeutic modality for metastatic melanoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Clinical approaches to treat advanced melanoma include immune therapies, whose benefits depend on tumor-reactive T-cell infiltration of metastases. However, most tumors lack significant immune infiltration prior to therapy. Selected chemokines promote T-cell migration into tumors; thus, agents that induce these chemokines in the tumor microenvironment (TME) may improve responses to systemic immune therapy. CXCL10 has been implicated as a critical chemokine supporting T-cell infiltration into the TME. Here, we show that toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists can induce chemokine production directly from melanoma cells when combined with IFNγ treatment. We find that TLR2 and TLR6 are widely expressed on human melanoma cells, and that TLR2/6 agonists (MALP-2 or FSL-1) synergize with interferon-gamma (IFNγ) to induce production of CXCL10 from melanoma cells. Furthermore, melanoma cells and immune cells from surgical specimens also respond to TLR2/6 agonists and IFNγ by upregulating CXCL10 production, compared to treatment with either agent alone. Collectively, these data identify a novel mechanism for inducing CXCL10 production directly from melanoma cells, with TLR2/6 agonists +IFNγ and raise the possibility that intratumoral administration of these agents may improve immune signatures in melanoma and have value in combination with other immune therapies, by supporting T-cell migration into melanoma metastases.

Homing of the transferred T cells to all tumor sites in sufficient numbers is of great importance. Here, we seek to exploit endogenous chemotactic signals in order to manipulate and enhance the directional trafficking of transferred T cells toward melanoma. Chemokine profiling of 15 melanoma cultures shows that CXCL1 and CXCL8 are abundantly expressed and secreted from melanoma cultures. However, the complimentary analysis on 40 melanoma patient-derived tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) proves that the corresponding chemokine receptors are either not expressed (CXCR2) or expressed at low levels (CXCR1). Using the in vitro transwell system, we demonstrate that TIL cells preferentially migrate toward melanoma and that endogenously expressing CXCR1 TIL cells are significantly enriched among the migrating lymphocytes. The role of the chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL8 is demonstrated by partial abrogation of this enrichment with anti-CXCL1 and anti-CXCL8 neutralizing antibodies. The role of the chemokine receptor CXCR1 is validated by the enhanced migration of CXCR1-engineered TIL cells toward melanoma or recombinant CXCL8. Cytotoxicity and IFNγ secretion activity are unaltered by CXCR1 expression profile. Taken together, these results mark CXCR1 as a candidate for genetic manipulations to enhance trafficking of adoptively transferred T cells.

High frequencies of CD8+CCR9+ naive T cells correlated with prolonged OS, while neutralizing the CCR9/CCL25 axis in mice stimulated tumor progression.

These observations have led to over 30 years of research on immunotherapy for melanoma; many of these efforts have failed, with only a few exceptions: interleukin-2 (IL-2) and to a lesser degree interferon-a (IFN-〈). Recently, new developments in immunotherapy have revolutionised this treatment modality. Anti-CTLA4 has received approval from the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of stage IV melanomas based on the improvement in overall survival in phase III trials, and more recently blockade of PD1/PDL1 interactions has shown objective clinical responses in a stage IV melanoma in early-phase clinical trials. In addition, several independent single-institution phase I/II trials using adoptive cell therapy have shown a consistently high response rate, including durable complete remissions in a substantial percentage of treated patients. Now, for the first time, immunotherapy has moved beyond the treatment of melanoma as both CTLA4 and PD1 blockade have been shown to induce objective responses in other tumour types as well. This chapter will discuss the mechanism of action, clinical efficacy and side effects of IL-2, the novel treatments consisting of the immune checkpoint blockade drugs anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1 and adoptive cell therapy.

However, little information exists on the nature of MHC class II-restricted human tumor Ag. In an attempt to develop in vitro systems to characterize such Ag, we examined the ability of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B cells to present melanoma-associated Ag to melanoma-specific CD4+ cells. CD4+ T cells cultured from lymphocytes infiltrating a s.c. melanoma metastasis secreted TNF-alpha and GM-CSF specifically in response to autologous cultured melanoma cells expressing MHC class II molecules. These CD4+ cells also recognized MHC class II-compatible EBV-B cells pulsed with extracts of autologous melanoma cells, but failed to recognize EBV-B cells pulsed with autologous non-transformed cells or a variety of allogeneic tumors or normal cells. B cells pre-fixed with paraformaldehyde were incapable of Ag presentation, suggesting that intracellular processing events were occurring. Antibody-blocking studies defined HLA-DR as the dominant if not exclusive restriction locus in this T-B interaction, and HLA-DR genotyping revealed DRBI*0404 to be the probable restriction element. In a second patient, a CD4+ T-cell clone cultured from a melanoma lesion recognized autologous tumor Ag presented by autologous EBV-B; no corss-reactivity was observed with the other tumor system investigated, nor with autologous CD4+ T cells specific for tetanus toxoid. These findings demonstrate that tumor Ag can be processed and presented by EBV-transformed B cells to MHC class II-restricted tumor-specific CD4+ T cells. They also provide a model system for direct identification of these tumor-derived antigens.",

To develop more effective therapeutic reagents and to further understand the T-cell response to tumors, the diversity of T-cell receptors (TCRs) involved in melanoma antigen recognition has been studied. The TCR variable (V) genes, joining (J) segments, and N diversity regions used by five clonal lines and one highly oligoclonal, melanoma-specific, CD8+ TIL line were examined utilizing PCR amplification with V gene subfamily-specific primers and anchor PCR. The TIL lysed multiple allogeneic melanomas expressing matched surface major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. TCR analysis confirmed the clonal nature of the TIL lines; however, the TCR repertoire was diverse. Even among the three HLA-A2 restricted TIL (TIL 1200, TIL F2-2, and TIL-5), no common V gene usage was found. Comparison of the third complementarity-determining regions of the TCRs from the HLA-A2 restricted TIL revealed no homology. Results presented here identify T-cell clonotypes that recognize epitopes on highly prevalent, shared melanoma tumor-associated antigens presented in the context of HLA-B55, HLA-A1, and HLA-A2.

Clones were derived from peripheral blood lymphocytes or tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes of patients who had received prior immunization with the melanoma-associated antigen, gpl00. In response to its cognate antigen, each clone used for treatment secreted large amounts of interferon-gamma and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, lesser amounts of interleukin (IL)-2 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and little or no IL-4 and IL-10. Clones also demonstrated recognition of human leukocyte antigen-matched melanomas using cytokine secretion and lysis assays. Twelve patients received 2 cycles of cells alone; 11 patients received additional cycles of cells and were randomized between two schedules of IL-2 (125,000 IU/kg subcutaneously daily for 12 days versus 720,000 IU/kg intravenously every 8 h for 4 days). A total of 51 cycles of cells were administered, with an average of 1 x 10(10) cells per cycle. Peripheral blood samples were analyzed for persistence of transferred cells by T-cell receptor-specific polymerase chain reaction. Transferred cells reached a maximum level at 1 h after transfer but rapidly declined to undetectable levels by 2 weeks. One minor response and one mixed response were observed (both in the high-dose IL-2 arm). This report demonstrates the safety and feasibility of cloned T-cell transfer as a therapy for patients with cancer. The lack of clinical effectiveness of this protocol suggests that transfer of different or additional cell types or that modulation of the recipient host environment is required for successful therapy.",

To determine if T-cell-defined melanoma antigens are expressed on other tumors of neuroectodermal origin, four melanoma-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) cultures derived from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) were tested for lysis of a panel of 23 HLA-A2+ neuroectodermal tumor cell lines of various histologies, including retinoblastoma (1), neuroblastoma (8), neuroepithelioma (6), astrocytoma (2), neuroglioma (1), and Ewing's sarcoma (5). Low expression of MHC class I and/or ICAM-1 molecules was found on 22 of 23 neuroectodermal tumor lines, and could be enhanced by treatment with interferon gamma (IFN gamma). Following IFN gamma treatment, three Ewing's sarcoma lines were lysed by at least one melanoma TIL culture, and levels of lysis were comparable to melanoma lysis by these TIL. Lysis could be inhibited by monoclonal antibodies directed against MHC class I molecules and against CD3, indicating specific immune recognition of tumor-associated antigens. None of the other neuroectodermal tumors tested were lysed by TIL, but they could be lysed by non-MHC-restricted lymphokine-activated killer cells. This demonstration of immunological cross-reactivity between melanomas and Ewing's sarcomas, two tumors of distinct histological types with a common embryonic origin, has implications for the developmental nature of these CTL-defined tumor antigens. It also raises the possibility that specific antitumor immunotherapies, such as vaccines, may be reactive against more than one form of cancer.",

Results were expressed as staining index (IRS). Intragenic mutations were studied by PCR-SSCP followed by sequencing, while hypermethylation of the promoter region by CpG methylation assay. In 15% of cases less than 10% of melanoma cells were p16 positive, in 70% of cases less than 50% of cells, while in 7% more than 80% of cells stained for p16 (mean IRS for all cases was 4.87 +/- 2.43). In B type the IRS was 8.5 +/- 0.7, in A + B type 6.0 +/- 2.1 and in the mixed type 4.17 +/- 2.43 (differences statistically significant). In melanomas profoundly infiltrating sclera mean IRS was 4.16, while in those infiltrating optic nerve 3.71 (statistically not significant).

Here, we analyzed the role of IRF-8 in the cross talk between melanoma cells and tumor-infiltrating leukocytes. B16-F10 melanoma cells transplanted into IRF-8-deficient (IRF-8(-/-)) mice grow more rapidly, leading to higher numbers of lung metastasis, with respect to control animals. These events correlated with reduced dendritic cell and T cell infiltration, accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and a chemokine/chemokine receptor expression profile within the tumor microenvironment supporting tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Noticeably, primary tumors developing in IRF-8(-/-) mice displayed a clear-cut inhibition of IRF-8 expression in melanoma cells. Injection of the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine into melanoma-bearing IRF-8(-/-) animals induced intratumoral IRF-8 expression and resulted in the re-establishment of a chemokine/ chemokine receptor pattern favoring leukocyte infiltration and melanoma growth arrest. Importantly, intrinsic IRF-8 expression was progressively down-modulated during melanoma growth in mice and in human metastatic melanoma cells with respect to primary tumors. Lastly, IRF-8 expression in melanoma cells was directly modulated by soluble factors, among which interleukin-27 (IL-27), released by immune cells from tumor-bearing mice. Collectively, these results underscore a key role of IRF-8 in the cross talk between melanoma and immune cells, thus revealing its critical function within the tumor microenvironment in regulating melanoma progression and invasiveness.",

Here, we demonstrate that cytotoxic tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) derived from a melanoma patient (TIL 1200) are directed against gp100. HLA-A2.1+ melanoma cells are lysed by TIL from this patient. In addition, murine double transfectants, expressing both HLA-A2.1 and gp100, are lysed by TIL 1200, whereas transfectants expressing only HLA-A2.1 are not susceptible to lysis. Furthermore, the HLA-A2.1+ melanoma cell line BLM, which lacks gp100 expression and is resistant to lysis, becomes susceptible after transfection of gp100 cDNA. Finally, HLA-A2.1+ normal melanocytes are lysed by TIL 1200.

BRAFi-treated patients showed significant increases in CD4(+), CD8(+), and PD-1(+) lymphocytes from PRE to EDT (P = 0.001, P = 0.001, P = 0.017, respectively), and Combi-treated patients showed similar increases in CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocytes from PRE to EDT (P = 0.017, P = 0.021).;The addition of MEKi to BRAFi did not result in significant reduction in immune infiltration in EDT biopsies. This provides support for conducting trials that combine MAPKi with immune checkpoint inhibitors in the hope of improving complete and durable response rates. PD-L1 expression at PROG on MAPK inhibitors varied according to baseline expression suggesting that combining MAPKi with immunotherapies concurrently may be more effective in patients with PD-L1 expression and TILs in baseline melanoma samples.",

The corresponding clone was isolated in vitro and found to be a CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte with a strong and selective cytolytic activity against the autologous tumor cell line. Here, we demonstrate that this predominant Vbeta16+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte recognizes a peptide encoded by a novel unconventional myosin class I gene. This peptide includes a mutation due to a single nucleotide substitution. The resulting Glu-->Lys replacement at position 911 of the coding sequence is critical to generate the recognized T cell epitope.

The aim of the present study is to analyze the density and topographical distribution of melanoma-associated DCs and their relation with CD3(+), CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes in forty cases of cutaneous human melanoma. In melanocytic tumours different pools of DCs were recognised in the epidermis and in the dermis, particularly in intimate relation with lymphocyte clusters inside the melanocytic proliferation, and more often at the edges of tumours. The number of Langerin-positive DCs showed an inverse correlation with tumour depth (correlation coefficient r= -0.59, P=0.0001) and was significantly lower in thick melanomas compared to thin and intermediate ones (P<0.0005). The density of CD83(+) DCs was significantly lower in thick melanomas compared to thin and intermediate ones (P<0.009). A significant correlation was found between the density of the two DCs subsets (r=0.57, p<0.0001). The number of CD3(+) lymphocytes was inversely correlated to the depth of infiltration (r=-0.596, P<0.0001): melanoma cases with II-III Clark level showed a higher T lymphocyte mean density compared to cases with IV-V Clark level (P<0.0001). T lymphocyte density was significantly lower in thick melanomas compared to thin and intermediate melanomas (P<0.0005). In conclusion, our study indicates a progressive loss of DCs and T lymphocytes in the neoplastic progression of melanomas; further identification of the molecular pathways involved in the functional impairment of these immunitary cells may lead to new immunotherapeutic approaches for melanoma patients that would improve the clinical outcome of the patients.",

Forty-two chemokine, cytokine, angiogenic, and growth factors were measured in the sera of 20 BRAF inhibitor-treated and four combination BRAF and MEK inhibitor-treated metastatic melanoma patients using a multiplex chemokine assay. The changes were correlated with Ki-67 and CD8(+) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in the tumor biopsies taken at the same time points, as well as clinical outcome, including response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Serum levels of IFN-γ, CCL4, and TNF-α were significantly increased, whereas CXCL8 significantly decreased from pretreatment (PRE) to early during treatment (EDT) serum samples. The decrease in serum CXCL8 levels from PRE to EDT significantly correlated with decreases in markers of melanoma proliferation (Ki-67) and increases in cytotoxic tumor-infiltrating T cells in corresponding tumor biopsies. In addition, a greater fold reduction in CXCL8 serum levels from PRE to EDT serum samples was associated with decreased overall survival. These results suggest that BRAF inhibition causes decreased CXCL8 secretion from melanoma cells and induce an immune response against the tumor associated with increased IFN-γ, CCL4, and TNF-α. Further studies are needed to determine if CXCL8 is predictive of response and to confirm the functions of these chemokine and cytokine in BRAF-mutant melanoma under BRAF inhibition. ",

Three common gp100 epitopes have been identified that are recognized in the context of HLA-A2 by TIL from different patients: G9154 (KTWGQYWQV), G9209 (ITDQVPFSV), and G9280 (YLEPGPVTA). Upon stimulation with these peptides, melanoma-reactive CTL could be induced in vitro from PBL of some HLA-A2+ melanoma patients. However, numerous restimulations were required, and specific reactivity could not be generated in many patients. Therefore, to enhance the immunogenicity of gp100 peptides, amino acid substitutions were introduced into G9154, G9209, and G9280 at HLA-A*0201-binding anchor positions, but not at TCR contact residues, to increase peptide class I MHC-binding affinity. Several modified gp100 peptides bound with greater affinity to HLA-A*0201 than unmodified peptides and were recognized by TIL specific for the natural epitopes. These peptides were used to sensitize PBL from HLA-A2+ melanoma patients in vitro using peptide-pulsed autologous PBMC as stimulators. After five weekly restimulations with either the native G9209 or G9280 peptide, melanoma-reactive CTL could only be induced from two of seven patients. However, amino acid substitutions in these peptides enabled the induction of melanoma-reactive CTL from all seven patients. These results suggest that modified gp100 peptides may be more immunogenic than the native epitopes, and may be useful in immunotherapy protocols for patients with melanoma.",

CD4+ T cells did not lyse DR15+ nonmelanoma cell types, including melanocytes or fibroblasts (induced to express HLA-DR by IFN-gamma).

Remarkably, simple infiltration is a prognostic indicator independent of the location of the metastasis (locoregional or distant), as shown by multivariate analysis.

However, what regulates immune cell infiltration of tumors remains to be identified. Stat3 is constitutively activated with high frequency in diverse cancers, promoting tumor cell growth and survival. Blocking Stat3 signaling in tumors in vivo results in tumor growth inhibition that involves killing of nontransfected tumor cells and infiltration of immune effector cells, suggesting that Stat3 activity in tumor cells might affect immune cell recruitment. However, dying tumor cells can also attract immune cells. In this study, we show in isogenic murine melanomas that natural Stat3 activity is associated with tumor growth and reduction of T cell infiltration. Blocking Stat3 signaling in the melanoma cells containing high Stat3 activity results in expression of multiple chemoattractants, leading to increased migration of lymphocytes, NK cells, neutrophils, and macrophages. In addition, blocking Stat3 triggers tumor cells to produce soluble factors capable of activating macrophage production of NO in vitro and in vivo. TNF-alpha and IFN-beta, which are secreted by Stat3-inhibited tumor cells, are able to activate macrophage NO production, whereas neutralizing TNF-alpha in the tumor supernatant from Stat3-blocked tumor cells abrogates nitrite production. Moreover, interrupting Stat3 signaling in tumor cells leads to macrophage-mediated, nitrite-dependent cytostatic activity against nontransduced tumor cells. These results suggest that tumor Stat3 activity affects recruitment of diverse immune effectors and it can be manipulated to activate the effector phase of innate immune responses.",

To study the variability of the immune response in melanoma patients, we derived melanoma cell lines from several HLA-A2+ and HLA-A2- patients. The melanoma cell lines studied were designated FM3, FM6, FM9, FM28, FM37, FM45, FM55p, FM55M1 and FM55M2 and were established from eight metastatic tumors as well as from one primary tumor from a total of seven different patients. On the basis of the ability of tumor cells to induce specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) in mixed lymphocyte/tumor culture with HLA-A2+ melanoma cells, the FM3 cell line was characterized as highly immunogenic. To investigate the expression of different melanoma-associated antigens recognized by CTL on different melanoma cell lines, we selected the cell line FM3 for restimulation and further T cell cloning experiments. The lytic activity of CTL clones with good proliferative activity was examined using a panel of HLA-A2+ and HLA-A2- melanoma cell lines. None of the tested HLA-A2- melanoma cell lines were susceptible to lysis by the CTL clones, whereas allogeneic HLA-A2+ melanoma cell lines were lysed only by a few CTL clones. On the basis of their reactivity with different melanoma cell lines, it was possible to divide the present CTL clones into at least four groups suggesting the recognition of at least four different antigens. Three of these target structures probably are different from already-described HLA-A2-restricted melanoma-associated antigens, because their expression in the different melanoma cell lines do not correlate with the recognition of melanoma cells by these CTL. The results first indicate that poorly immunogenic melanoma cells may express melanoma-associated antigens, and also suggest that, by using CTL clones obtained against different HLA-class-I-matched melanoma cells, it is possible to define such antigens.",

ADAMs have also been shown to be primarily involved in ectodomain cleavage. The aim of the study was to assess the expression and intracellular location of ADAM-10 in 104 primary skin melanomas and 16 metastatic lesions from regional lymph nodes. Also, prognostic significance of ADAM-10 expression in primary tumor cells and metastatic lesion cells was evaluated during 5-year observation. It was revealed that high expression of ADAM-10 positive cells was strictly related with lower intensity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (P = 0.037), which suggests that ADAM-10 regulates immunoresponse in melanoma initiation and progression. No statistically significant correlations were found between ADAM-10 expression in primary tumor cells and nodal metastases and other histopathological parameters analyzed. Decreased immunoreactivity of ADAM-10 in cancer cells from regional lymph nodes was correlated with worse prognosis; however this correlation was statistically nonsignificant (P = 0.065). Review of the literature shows that our study is the first one ever to describe the significance of ADAM-10 expression in correlation with detailed histopathological parameters of the primary tumor and data on long-term survival of cutaneous melanoma patients.

Patient-derived CIK cells efficiently killed autologous metastatic melanoma [up to 71% specific killing (n = 26)]. CIK cells were active in vivo against autologous melanoma, resulting in delayed tumor growth, increased necrotic areas, and lymphocyte infiltration at tumor sites. The metastatic melanoma cultures presented an average of 11.5% ± 2.5% putative mCSCs, which was assessed by Oct4 promoter activity and stemness marker expression (Oct4, ABCG2, ALDH, MITF).

We have recently shown that cytokine release by TIL is another indicator of the specific interaction with autologous tumor. To determine if recognition of shared melanoma Ag can also induce cytokine release, seven melanoma TIL, which lysed autologous tumor, were co-cultured with autologous tumor or with 7-12 HLA-matched or unmatched melanoma stimulators for 6-24 h. Supernatants were collected and assayed by ELISA for the presence of granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-4, and IL-6. Among five of six melanoma TIL for which autologous tumor was available, autologous melanoma cells stimulated specific release of at least one of three cytokines: GM-CSF, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha. Neither IL-4 nor IL-6 secretion by three TIL cultures tested was enhanced upon contact with tumor. For six of seven TIL cultures, HLA-matched allogeneic melanomas also stimulated significant cytokine release; HLA-A1, -A2, -A24, -B8, and -Cw7 were identified as possible restriction elements. The cytokine secretion induced by both autologous and allogeneic HLA-matched melanomas could be blocked by an anti-MHC I antibody.

We have investigated the potential use of BNX mice for studies relating to the biology and immunotherapy of human malignant melanoma. The intravenous injection of fresh single-cell suspensions of human malignant melanomas into mice resulted in widely disseminated disease. Metastatic spread of human melanoma in BNX mice mimicked that observed in patients: eg, there were numerous tumor nodules identified in the subcutaneous tissues as well as in a variety of visceral organs, including spleen, kidneys, thyroid, adrenals, lungs, heart, and brain. BNX mouse lymph nodes were replaced consistently by human malignant melanoma cells. The presence of human tumor cells in these mice was confirmed by histologic analysis and microcytofluorometry analyses using human melanoma-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Moreover, human melanoma cells passaged in BNX mice remained lysable in vitro by specifically cytolytic, autologous human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). The capacity of fresh human malignant melanoma to disseminate widely in BNX mice may prove valuable not only for study of the biology of metastatic spread but also for studies of the immunotherapy of human melanoma using melanoma-specific MAbs and chemotherapeutic agents, as well as human TILs and LAK cells with or without retrovirus-mediated gene transfer modification.",

Large multi-institutional studies have confirmed that when performed by experienced surgeons, it is an accurate, reliable technique for identifying occult regional nodal disease, and that SLN status is the most important prognostic factor in patients with stage I and II melanoma. However, the incidence of occult regional nodal metastasis in patients with thin melanoma (<or= 1.0 mm; approximately 70% of patients with newly diagnosed melanoma) is low, and whether to perform SLN biopsy in these patients remains controversial. Several predictors of SLN metastasis in patients with thin melanoma have been suggested, but none widely accepted. This article reviews current literature on these predictors in patients with thin melanoma. Although the ability to draw conclusions was limited by the size and design of the available studies, the authors tentatively conclude that SLN biopsy can be considered for patients with melanomas 0.75 mm or larger, those with T1b melanomas (i.e., <or= 1.0 mm; Clark level IV/V and/or ulcerated), and those with thin melanomas with an increased tumor mitotic rate (especially >or= 1 mitosis/mm2). Including younger age (e.g., <or= 40 years) in the decision also seems reasonable, particularly if the primary tumor is associated with a high tumor mitotic rate. Tumor regression does not seem to be associated with an increased risk for SLN metastasis. Firm conclusions on the predictive value of vertical growth phase, absence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or male gender were not possible, particularly if used as a sole criterion for offering this procedure. SLN biopsy should be discussed with all patients with newly diagnosed thin melanoma.",

Notably, we found that tumor-specific CD4(+) T-cell responses were dominated by TNF production. TNF reduced CD8(+) T-cell activation in IFNγ-rich environments resembling a tumor site. Conversely, direct CD4(+) T-cell responses had no influence on either the proliferation or viability of melanoma cells. Taken together, our results illustrate a novel immune escape mechanism that can be activated by aberrant expression of MHC class II molecules, which by attracting tumor-specific CD4(+) T cells elicit a local inflammatory response dominated by TNF that, in turn, inhibits cytotoxic CD8(+) T-cell responses",

Demographic characteristics were questioned and noted. Prognostic parametres were evaluated based on sentinel lymph node involvement.;Mean age was 56.7 (4-99) years. While 844 (53.6%) cases were male, 730 (46.4%) cases were female. One thousand four hundred forty-seven (92%) cases were invasive melanoma and 127 (8%) cases were in-situ melanoma. The most common histopathological form was the superficial spreading melanoma (SSM) which was found in 549 patients (37.9%). It was followed by nodular melanoma in 379 (26.2%), acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) in 191 (13.2%) and lentigo maligna melanoma in 132 (9.1%), respectively. On univariate analysis, lymphovascular invasion (p<0.001), tumor thickness (p<0.001), histopathological subtype (p<0.001), Clark level (p=0.001), ulceration (p<0.001), ≥6/mm2 mitosis (p=0.005), satellite formation (p=0.001) and gender (p=0.03) were found to be associated with sentinel lymph node positivity. Regression was associated with sentinel lymph node negativity (p=0.017). According to multivariate analysis, lymphovascular invasion and tumor thickness were significant independent predictive factors of SLN positivity. Patient age, tumor localization, precursor lesions, lymphocytic infiltration and neurotropism were not related with sentinel lymph node involvement.;In this retrospective analysis, it was found that the prevalence of SSM is at a lower rate while the prevalence of ALM is at a higher rate when compared to western countries. According to Breslow index; most of the melanoma lesions' thickness were greater than 2 mm, corresponding Clark IV. Vascular invasion and tumor thickness are the most important factors for sentinel lymph node involvement.",

Cytogenetic analysis was performed on the tumors and heparinized blood samples of three patients with iris melanomas; in one case a primary tumor and its related seedling were examined. On analysis of lymphocytes, two of the patients were found to experience a low level fragility of chromosome 9, in the region of a cutaneous melanoma susceptibility gene. All iris melanoma lesions were karyotyped. Clonal abnormalities of chromosomes 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 15, 17, 18, 19, and Y were found, and in one case a large number of marker chromosomes were observed. No specific chromosomal change was common to the iris melanomas, but two cases had different abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and 18. Variations between the primary tumor and its related seedling were the acquisition of an additional chromosome 15, and a polyploid form of the cell line in the seedling. This study suggests that the most common chromosomal changes of posterior uveal melanomas are less frequent in iris melanomas. Iris melanomas also appear to experience relatively high levels of chromosomal alterations, including the formation of marker chromosomes, which is perhaps reminiscent of cutaneous melanoma.",

Therapeutic blockade of immune-inhibitory receptors in patients with preexisting lymphocytic infiltrates prolongs survival, but new complementary strategies are needed to activate cellular antitumor immunity in immune cell-poor melanomas. Here, we show that primary melanomas in Hgf-Cdk4(R24C) mice, which imitate human immune cell-poor melanomas with a poor outcome, escape IFN-induced immune surveillance and editing. Peritumoral injections of immunostimulatory RNA initiated a cytotoxic inflammatory response in the tumor microenvironment and significantly impaired tumor growth. This critically required the coordinated induction of type I IFN responses by dendritic, myeloid, natural killer, and T cells. Importantly, antibody-mediated blockade of the IFN-induced immune-inhibitory interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1 receptors further prolonged the survival. These results highlight important interconnections between type I IFNs and immune-inhibitory receptors in melanoma pathogenesis, which serve as targets for combination immunotherapies.;Using a genetically engineered mouse melanoma model, we demonstrate that targeted activation of the type I IFN system with immunostimulatory RNA in combination with blockade of immune-inhibitory receptors is a rational strategy to expose immune cell-poor tumors to cellular immune surveillance.",

Heterogeneity of expression of MAA in tumor deposits may affect the natural history or response to therapy of patients with melanoma. In this study, we evaluated the expression of these MAA with a new monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against MART-1 (M2-7C10) and the commercially available HMB45 mAb directed against gp100. Expression was tested in vitro by intracellular fluorescence analysis and in vivo by immunophenotyping of tissue specimens. Nine melanoma cell lines and 25 tissue specimens from metastatic melanoma were analyzed. One cell line did not express MART-1 or gp100. The expression of both antigens was more heterogeneous and significantly reduced (p < 0.01) in melanoma cell lines compared with melanocytes, suggesting progressive loss of expression of MAA by neoplastic cells. None of the nonmelanoma cancer lines tested stained for MART-1 or gp100. Analysis of melanoma lesions by immunohistochemistry showed significant heterogeneity of expression of both MART-1 and gp100 MAA either as a percentage of cells expressing MAA or as intensity of expression. Ten of 25 frozen sections expressed MART-1 in < 50% of the cells. In 6 of 25 lesions, immunoreactivity for MART-1 was totally absent. Fine needle aspiration of metastatic lesions seemed to yield information accurately about amount and heterogeneity of expression of MAA in tumor lesions in vivo. Heterogeneity of expression of MAA may be one of several mechanisms leading to tumor escape from immune recognition, and pretreatment evaluation of tumor lesion for expression of these antigens may help in selecting patients best suited to antigen-specific vaccine therapies.",

Initial reports showed objective response rates with single-agent rIL-2 therapy in the range of 15% to 20% with some durable responses; however, the overall response rates were lower than originally anticipated. In addition, in contrast to animal models, it appears that coadministration of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells, generated ex vivo with rIL-2, does not enhance the response rates achieved with single-agent rIL-2. Despite a multitude of studies with various rIL-2 regimens, with and without coadministration of LAK cells or tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, the optimum dose and treatment schedule for rIL-2-based therapy in metastatic melanoma remains a topic of controversy.

        "Doc_abstract":"Angiogenesis is defined as the formation of new blood capillaries from preexisting vessels. It takes place in physiological and pathological conditions, such as cancer. Tumor angiogenesis depends on the release of angiogenic growth factors by tumor cells and infiltrating inflammatory cells, and from the extracellular matrix following degradation by tumor proteases. Human melanoma progresses through different steps: nevocellular nevi, dysplastic nevi, in situ melanoma, radial growth phase melanoma (Breslow index < or = 0.75 mm), vertical growth phase melanoma (Breslow index > 0.75 mm), and metastatic melanoma. In agreement with progression, it acquires a rich vascular network, whereas an increasing proportion of tumor cells express the laminin receptor, which enables their adhesion to the vascular wall. Hence, both phenomena favour tumour cell extravasation and metastases. Melanocytic cells produce and release Fibroblast Growth Factor-2 (FGF-2), mainly in the steps of dysplastic nevus and melanoma in vertical growth phase. Melanoma cells also secrete the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), in parallel with the switch from the radial to the vertical growth phase and the metastatic phase. It is becoming clear that anti-angiogenic agents will interfere with or block melanoma progression.",

A total of 92 breast cancer biopsies (66 infiltrating lobular and 26 infiltrating ductal carcinomas) were initially tested along with 26 melanomas (positive controls), 23 gastric/colonic adenocarcinomas and 13 neuroendocrine tumors. Forty-four out of 66 lobular breast carcinomas showed positive immunostaining with 225.28S MoAb as well as only 6 out of 26 infiltrating ductal histotype and 12 out of 26 melanomas. Conversely, gastric and colonic adenocarcinomas and neuroendocrine tumors were completely negative. The pattern of positivity in breast carcinomas was associated with malignant cells, rather than with the stroma or histiocytes infiltrating the lesions. Nonspecific cross-reactivity of 225.28S with breast carcinomas was excluded using a similar murine antithyreoglobulin MoAb, which gave negative staining in all biopsies. These results indicated that HMW-MAA or a similar sequence recognized by 225.28S MoAb is often expressed by lobular breast carcinomas but rarely by ductal adenocarcinomas.

This suboptimal activation is classically explained by an inability of tumor cells to provide costimulatory signals. Here we analyzed the responses to synthetic peptides of HLA-A2.1-restricted CTL clones specific for melanoma antigens MART-1 and NA17-A. We showed that peptide concentrations ranging from 1 pM to 10 nM efficiently sensitized the peptide transporter-deficient T2 cells to lysis. T2 cells pulsed with melanoma peptides also induced TIL proliferation and detectable secretion of IL-2, IFN-gamma and GM-CSF, but only for peptide concentrations 10- to 10,000-fold higher than those required for lysis. Hence this suggests that partial triggering of TIL clones by melanoma cells could be due to expression of appropriate MHC-peptide complexes at subthreshold levels. In support of this, we showed that melanoma cells, unable to trigger IL-2 secretion, developed this ability when incubated with the appropriate peptide. These results indicate that the level of antigens expressed on melanoma tumors critically affects TIL activation status and thus, the efficiency of specific immune reactions mediated by these cells.",

Therefore, the precise analysis of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is becoming an important additional pathological biomarker. Analysis of TILs is usually performed semiquantitatively by pathologists on haematoxylin and eosin-stained or immunostained tissue sections. However, automated quantification outperforms semiquantitative approaches, and is becoming the standard. Owing to the presence of melanin pigment, this approach is seriously hampered in melanoma, because the spectrum of melanin lies close to that of commonly used immunohistochemical stains. Aim of this study is to overcome the technical issues due to the presence of melanin for an automated and accurate quantification of TILs in melanoma.;Here, we successfully applied a novel multispectral imaging (MSI) technique to enumerate T cells in human primary melanomas. This microscopy technique combines imaging with spectroscopy to obtain both quantitative expression data and the tissue distributions of different cellular markers. We demonstrate that MSI allows complete and accurate analysis of TILs, successfully avoiding the blurring of images by melanin pigments, in whole tissue slide primary melanoma lesions, which could otherwise not be accurately detected by conventional digital image methodologies.;Our study highlights the potential of MSI for accurate assessment of immune cell infiltrates, including those in notoriously difficult tissues, such as pigmented melanomas.

These tumors are usually defined by an enrichment of cancer stem cells and characterized by the higher expression of chemotherapy-resistant proteins. In this work we develop the first aptamer that targets chemotherapy-resistant tumors expressing MRP1 through a novel combinatorial peptide-cell SELEX. With the use of the MRP1 aptamer we engineer a MRP1-CD28 bivalent aptamer that is able to bind MRP1-expressing tumors and deliver the CD28 costimulatory signal to tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. The bi-specific aptamer is able to enhance costimulation in chemotherapy-resistant tumors. Melanoma-bearing mice systemically treated with MRP1-CD28 bivalent aptamer show reduced growth, thus proving an improved mice survival.Besides, we have designed a technically feasible and translational whole-cell vaccine (Aptvax). Disaggregated cells from tumors can be directly decorated with costimulatory ligand aptamers to generate the vaccine Aptvax.

Blood samples were examined before treatment and repeatedly after surgical removal of the tumor. A microagglutination test induced by poly-L-lysine was used for the detection of sensitized lymphocytes in peripheral blood of melanoma patients. The number of positive results was increasing with the progression of the disease. After incubation with poly-L-lysine the electrophoretic mobility of lymphocytes was changed in melanoma patients. The nucleolar test was used for the study of quantitative and morphological changes of the nucleoli in lymphocytes. Elevated values of the nucleolar coefficient and an increased number of active nucleoli provided evidence on the higher immunological reactivity of melanoma patients. The decline in the number of lymphocytes with ring-shaped nucleoli, signaling immunologic exhaustion, are of prognostic value. Lymphocytes were assayed also for the presence of receptors for sheep erythrocytes (E active and total rosettes) and C3d component of complement (EAC rosettes). The reported findings may be used to advantage in evaluating the immunological reactivity of melanoma patients.",

Coping styles were paradoxically related to major life stress such that history of major stresses was associated with greater confrontation of the melanoma diagnosis, greater will to fight the disease, and less avoidance of its frightening aspects. Experience with fewer major life stresses was associated with a defeatist attitude characterized by an expectation of a poor prognosis and little control over outcomes.

The efficacy of this in vivo transfection was enhanced by concomitant infusion of epinephrine to induce local vasoconstriction. In these conditions, repeated injections of pSEA-TM/PEI complexes elicited a significant response, as evidenced by tumor growth inhibition, without systemic adverse effects. T cell infiltration of the tumors, together with positive lymphocyte proliferation tests, suggested local and systemic immune responses.

The relationship between anti-PD-L1 tumor exposition and anti-tumor effect represents a challenge that has been addressed in this work through the identification of certain biomarkers implicated in the antibody's mechanism of action, using a syngeneic melanoma mouse model. The development of an in-vitro/in-vivo platform has allowed us to investigate the PD-L1 behavior after its blockage with anti-PD-L1 at cellular level and in animals. In-vitro studies showed that the complex PD-L1/anti-PD-L1 was retained mainly at the cell surface. The antibody concentration and time exposure affected directly the recycling or ligand turnover. In-vivo studies showed that anti-PD-L1 was therapeutically active at all stage of the disease, with a rapid onset, a low but durable efficacy and non-relevant toxic effect. This efficacy measured as tumor shrinkage correlated with tumor-specific infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), which increased as antibody tumor concentrations increased. Both, TILS and antibody concentrations followed similar kinetic patterns, justifying the observed anti-PD-L1 rapid onset. Interestingly, peripheral lymphocytes (PBLs) behave as infiltrating lymphocytes, suggesting that these PBLs might be considered as a possible biomarker for antibody activity.",

Since MTB forms a strong complex with melanin, it is an effective carrier for a number of radioisotopes to be addressed to the tumor deposits of any size including individually dispersed melanoma cells. Thus, appropriately radiolabeled MTB can be used for either diagnosis or therapy of the neoplasm. As predicted and found in animal experiments, 211At-MTB is most effective therapeutically. Histopathological investigations showed that the highly pigmented 211At-MTB-treated tumors were characterized initially by perivascular oedema and hydropic degeneration of tumor cells followed by gradual development of extensive areas of coagulative necrosis. The necrotic tumor areas contained microvessels occluded by thrombi and tended to undergo microfocal calcification. Although melanoma-bearing animals successfully treated with 211At-MTB did not reveal any adverse effects of the therapy, detailed toxicological studies were undertaken. No serious macro- or microscopic lesions were observed in normal organs of 211At-MTB treated mice.

Among these, some malignant cancers such as oral melanoma, osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, and mast cell tumor are often recognized as clinical problems because, despite their high frequencies, current treatments for these cancers may not always achieve satisfying outcomes. The absence of effective systemic therapies against these cancers leads researchers to investigate novel therapeutic modalities, including immunotherapy. Programmed death 1 (PD-1) is a costimulatory receptor with immunosuppressive function. When it binds its ligands, PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) or PD-L2, PD-1 on T cells negatively regulates activating signals from the T cell receptor, resulting in the inhibition of the effector function of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Aberrant PD-L1 expression has been reported in many human cancers and is considered an immune escape mechanism for cancers. In clinical trials, anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies induced tumor regression for several malignancies, including advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma. In this study, to assess the potential of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis as a novel therapeutic target for canine cancer immunotherapy, immunohistochemical analysis of PD-L1 expression in various malignant cancers of dogs was performed. Here, we show that dog oral melanoma, osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, mast cell tumor, mammary adenocarcinoma, and prostate adenocarcinoma expressed PD-L1, whereas some other types of cancer did not. In addition, PD-1 was highly expressed on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes obtained from oral melanoma, showing that lymphocytes in this cancer type might have been functionally exhausted. These results strongly encourage the clinical application of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as novel therapeutic agents against these cancers in dogs. ",

Achieving complete remissions by peptide therapy is frequently hampered by metastases evading immune recognition. The tumor microenvironment seems to favor reduced expression of target antigens by melanoma cells. Among candidate factors, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) (10(2) to 10(3) U/ml) suppressed expression of antigens MART-1, TRP-1, and gp100 by M14 melanoma cells as shown by immunohistology and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, reducing MART-1 expression by >65%. Northern blot analysis revealed that reduced expression was regulated at the transcriptional level, demonstrating a 79% reduction in MART-1 transcript abundance after 32 hours of IFN-gamma treatment. To evaluate consequences of IFN-gamma exposure for immune recognition, MART-1-responsive T cells were reacted with pretreated HLA-matched melanoma cells. Cytotoxicity was reduced up to 78% by IFN-gamma pretreatment, and was restored by addition of MART-1 peptide AAGIGILTV for 2 hours. Examination of melanoma lesions by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed up to 188-fold more abundant IFN-gamma transcripts when compared to control skin. Laser capture microdissection and immunohistology localized most IFN-gamma-producing T cells to the tumor stroma. Reduced MART-1 expression was frequently observed in adjacent tumor cells. Consequently, IFN-gamma may enhance inflammatory responses yet hamper effective recognition of melanoma cells.",

Using immunocytochemical techniques on frozen sections, the cellular types and activation status of infiltrating cells within a series of 19 clinically apparent nodal metastases of melanoma were studied. Infiltrating cells were assessed using a semiquantitative grading system. Macrophages (CD68+) and T-lymphocytes (CD3+) (including both CD8+ and probably also CD4+ T-cells) were the predominant cells infiltrating the tumours. B-lymphocytes (CD20+) were generally present in low numbers. CD1a+ putative dendritic cell density and expression of the early lymphocyte activation markers interleukin-2 receptor alpha (IL2Ralpha) and CD69 was low. However, greater evidence of intermediate lymphocyte activation (CD38) was identified. Expression of interleukin-2 (IL2) by tumour-infiltrating cells was not detected. The paucity of staining for IL2 and IL2Ralpha, with greater expression of CD38 by infiltrating cells, suggests that the usual pathways of lymphocyte activation via IL2 were bypassed or impaired within the lymph node metastases. Low numbers of CD1a+ putative dendritic cells may result in reduced effector cell activation. These findings provide evidence to support the hypothesis that antitumour immune responses within clinically involved lymph nodes are reduced in metastatic melanoma. This also has possible implications for micrometastases to the sentinel lymph node.",

As such, they are capable of triggering a primary T cell response. Evidence suggest that DCs can elicit strong antitumor immunity. Melanoma is an aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. In these tumors, there is a reduced density of DCs in the epidermal, intratumoral and peritumoral sites. This seems to share to a defective T-cell response and ultimately to a poor prognosis in these tumors. Since 1975, more than 806 papers appeared in the literature with melanomas and DCs as keywords. However, in spite of these extensive investigations, a lack of side-by-side analysis of these studies has resulted in tentative conclusions that merely offer a first glimpse at the role of DCs in melanoma. To remedy this issue, this review seeks to examine the background information about DCs including their derivation, morphologic features, functional properties, growth characteristics, and differentiation pathways. This review provides insights into DCs status in the skin, and their roles in melanoma. It also sheds light on the possible use of DCs in melanoma therapy.",

The survival rates depend on the tumor thickness and/or the infiltration level.

Five gp100 epitopes (two for TIL620, three for TIL660, one for TIL1143, and two for TIL1200) were recognized by CTL derived from different patients. Five of eight HLA-A2 binding melanoma epitopes (five gp100, one MART-1/Melan-A, two tyrosinase) had intermediate binding affinity to HLA-A2.1.

Furthermore, we report the presence of T cells specific for three cryptic epitopes encoded in intronic sequences, as a result of incomplete splicing, in the circulation of melanoma patients.

To elucidate the role of HLA class II expression in the immunopathogenesis of melanoma, the authors compared HLA class II+ melanoma cells to autologous B cells with respect to their ability to stimulate primary (naïve) histoincompatible lymphocytes and T-cell clones (antigen experienced). Using primary lymphocytes (peripheral blood lymphocytes [PBLs]), melanoma cells were nonstimulatory when compared to autologous B cells. To determine whether this was caused by defective antigen processing, the authors used alloreactive T-cell clones, which require alloantigen presentation by a histocompatible stimulator cell but not costimulation. Melanoma cells stimulated the alloreactive T-cell clones in two of three clones tested, indicating that they processed and presented alloantigen. To determine whether the failure of melanoma cells to stimulate primary lymphocytes was caused by their inability to costimulate the T cells, the authors transduced the melanoma cells with B7.1 and achieved stable expression in more than 95% of the cells. The transduced cells were highly stimulatory, eliciting a 17- to 25-fold increase in proliferation by the peripheral blood lymphocytes compared with controls. Indeed, B7-expressing melanoma cells were more stimulatory than autologous B cells, which elicited an 11- to 15-fold increase compared with controls. These data indicate that melanoma cells fail to stimulate primary lymphocytes because they do not deliver costimulatory signals. Engineering HLA class II+ melanoma cells to express high levels of B7.1 may provide a way to elicit primary T-cell responses to melanoma-associated antigens.",

However, diffuse infiltration into tumor occurs in only 8% of melanoma metastases. Little is known about mechanisms governing T-cell infiltration into human melanoma metastases or about how those mechanisms may be altered therapeutically. We hypothesized that T cells in the MME would be enriched for chemokine receptors CCR4, CCR5, CXCR3 and homing receptors relevant to the tissue site. Viably cryopreserved single cell suspensions from nineteen melanoma metastases representing three metastatic sites (tumor-infiltrated lymph node, skin and small bowel) were evaluated by multiparameter flow cytometry and compared to benign lymph nodes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with Stage IIB-IV melanoma. T cells in the melanoma metastases contained large effector memory populations, high proportions of activated, moderately differentiated cells and few regulatory T cells. Site-specific homing was suggested in bowel, with high expression of CCR9. We neither encounter the anticipated enrichment of integrin α4β7 in bowel, cutaneous leukocyte antigen (CLA) in skin, nor integrin α4β1 or receptor CXCR3 in metastatic sites. Retention integrins αEβ7, α1β1 and α2β1 were significantly elevated in metastases. These data suggest limited tissue site-specific homing to human melanoma metastases, but a significant role for retention integrins in maintaining intratumoral T cells. Our findings also raise the possibility that T-cell homing, infiltration, and retention in melanoma metastases may be increased by increasing expression of ligands for CLA, α4β1 and CXCR3 on intratumoral endothelium.

To better characterize the host immune response, we have classified TIL by their immunoreactivity against lymphoid markers in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. Monoclonal antibodies to leukocyte common antigen (LCA) and TIA-1 (a granule-associated protein of cytotoxic T cells and NK cells) were used to immunostain a series of benign nevi, nontumorigenic radial growth phase, and tumorigenic vertical growth phase melanomas and metastases. Among nine nevi, few LCA+ TIL were found, among which rare cells were positive for TIA-1 (mean, 2.0). Five nontumorigenic radial growth phase melanomas also had few total TIL and rare TIA-1+ TIL (mean, 3.4); the nontumorigenic radial growth phase component of seven tumorigenic vertical growth phase melanomas had higher numbers of TIA-1+ TIL (mean, 11). Twelve cases of tumorigenic vertical growth phase melanoma showed a variable but significantly greater number of both LCA+ TIL and TIA-1+ TIL (mean, 30.6). Nine cases of metastatic melanoma had a wide range of variation in LCA as well as in TIA-1+ TIL (mean, 46). Although the mean total number of TIA-1+ TIL increased from nontumorigenic radial growth phase to tumorigenic vertical growth phase to metastases, TIA-1+ as a percentage of TIL declined across these categories of tumor progression (42%, 31%, and 26%, respectively). Our results show that these attributes of TIA-1+ TIL, both increasing total number but decreasing percentage, appear to be a marker of tumor progression of malignant melanomas. In addition, there was significant variability in the number of TIA-1+ TIL among advanced melanomas, raising the possibility that an assessment of TIA-1+ TIL may prove a useful prognostic tool for the evaluation of primary melanomas.",

Because autologous tumors are generally unavailable, an allogeneic choroidal melanoma cell line, OCM-1, was used as the specific stimulus. Lymphocyte cultures from 27 patients were characterized by cell-surface phenotypes, patterns of reactivity towards cells of the melanocytic origin and T-cell-receptor gene usage. Antimelanoma reactivity was found in cell-sorter-purified CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets. To analyze this reactivity, sorter-purified CD4+ and CD8+ cells from a MLTC were cloned by limiting dilution in the presence of exogenous interleukin-2 and interleukin-4 as well as irradiated OCM-1. Under these conditions, CD4+ T cells did not proliferate, perhaps because of the absence of antigen-presenting cells. However, CD8+ grew vigorously and 29 cytolytic CD8+ T cell clones were isolated. On the basis of their pattern of lysis of OCM-1, a skin melanoma cell line M-7 and its autologous lymphoblastoid cell line LCL-7, the clones were categorized into three groups. Group 1, representing 52% of the clones, lysed all three target cells, and are alloreactive. However, since OCM-1 and M-7 did not share class I antigens, these clones recognized cross-reactive epitope(s) of the histocompatibility locus antigen (HLA) molecule. Group 2, constituting 28% of the clones, lysed both the ocular and skin melanoma cell lines but not LCL-7, and were apparently melanoma-specific. Unlike classical HLA-restricted cytolytic T lymphocytes, these T cells might mediate the lysis of melanoma cells via other ligands or a more degenerate type of HLA restriction. For the latter, the HLA-A2 and -A28 alleles would have to act interchangeably as the restriction element for shared melanoma-associated antigen(s). Group 3, representing only 10% of the T cell clones, was cytotoxic only to OCM-1, but not to M-7 or LCL-7. These clones may recognize antigens unique to ocular melanoma cells. Our data suggest that choroidal melanoma patients can recognize melanoma-associated antigens common to both ocular and cutaneous melanoma cells, and presumbly their autologous tumor. Thus, choroidal melanoma, like its skin counterpart, may be responsive to immunotherapeutic regimens such as active specific or adoptive cellular immunotherapy.",

Differences in the distribution of selected parameters between the two groups were investigated by Fisher's exact test; for each parameter sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Results showed that all parameters, except poor circumscription, seemed to be significantly associated with melanoma (P<0.05). Cytological atypia, dermal lymphocytic infiltrate, asymmetry, dimension >6 mm and absence of maturation showed a high sensitivity (>90%); absence of maturation, mitoses, necrosis, asymmetrical melanin, suprabasal melanocytes and melanin in deep cells showed a high specificity (>90%); irregular-confluent nests and single melanocytes predominating were poorly sensitive and poorly specific.

We investigated the expression of COX-2 in uveal melanoma and related the findings to prognostic factors.;In 40 cases of uveal melanoma, immunostaining for COX-2 was done. COX-2 expression was related to histopathological prognostic markers, such as cell type, the presence of lymphocytic infiltration and vascular closed loops in the tumour, and cytomorphometry results.;COX-2 expression was found in 58% of the cases, and it correlated with markers of poor prognosis, such as epithelioid cell type and the presence of lymphocytic infiltration and vascular closed loops. The uveal melanomas expressing COX-2 had larger nuclei, as determined by cytomorphometry.;Whereas epithelioid tumours carry a worse prognosis than spindle cell tumours, until now it has not been possible to give a strong indication of prognosis in mixed-cell tumours. This study showed that mixed-cell tumours, representing the majority of uveal melanomas, may be further subclassified according to COX-2 expression, which serves as a marker of poor prognosis. The role of COX-2 in uveal melanoma should be further elucidated, and the use of COX-2 inhibitors warrants investigation as adjuvant treatment for this life-threatening malignant disease.",

Adult Balb/C mice recieved 0.1-cm3 doses of BCG prior to intramuscular challenge with 1 x 10-6 S-91 melanoma cells. A 65% reduction in melanoma incidence was noted in BCG-pretreated mice. The possibility of specific protection induced by the BCG against the melanoma exists, since the BCG pretreatment did not protect against challenge with 1 x 10-5 mammary carcinoma cells or 1 x 10-4 MCA fibrosarcoma cells in the same strain of mice. Lack of immunogenicity was not a factor in the inability of the carcinoma and sarcoma to be inhibited by BCG. The strenght of the BCG-induced protection against the S-91 melanoma was demonstrated by significantly decreased tumor incidence following three different log challenge doses of the melanoma. However, reduction of the sarcoma challenge dose to as few as 10-2 cells administered to BCG pretreated mice did not result in decreased tumor incidence. It was further discovered that as few as two doses of 0.1 cm3 of BCG were sufficient to produce a 70% reduction in melanoma incidence compared with the incidence in control animals (P less than .001). Lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity studies paralleled the results of the in vivo experiments. Lymphocytes immune to each of the three tumors showed significant cytotoxicity against their respective tumor target cells (p less than .001), while the only tumor cells that lymphocytes from BCG-pretreated mice showed significant cytotoxicity against were S-91 target cells (p less than .01).

Recently, we have demonstrated that the RNA editing protein, adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-1 (ADAR1) is down-regulated during metastatic transition of melanoma, which enhances melanoma cell proliferation and tumorigenicity. Here we investigate the role of ADAR1 in melanoma immune resistance.Importantly, knockdown of ADAR1 in human melanoma cells induces resistance to tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in a cell contact-dependent mechanism. We show that ADAR1, in an editing-independent manner, regulates the biogenesis of miR-222 at the transcription level and thereby Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM1) expression, which consequently affects melanoma immune resistance. ADAR1 thus has a novel, pivotal, role in cancer immune resistance. Corroborating with these results, the expression of miR-222 in melanoma tissue specimens was significantly higher in patients who had no clinical benefit from treatment with ipilimumab as compared to patients that responded clinically, suggesting that miR-222 could function as a biomarker for the prediction of response to ipilimumab.These results provide not only novel insights on melanoma immune resistance, but also pave the way to the development of innovative personalized tools to enable optimal drug selection and treatment.

Comparison of the BV-expression in regressive versus progressive regions of the same tumor revealed major differences in all cases examined.

In addition, we systematically characterized the responses of a series of TIL products to relevant autologous short term-cultured melanoma cell lines from 12 patients.

After being washed free of inhibitory tumor cells, the TIL again were able to grow in the presence of IL-2, indicating that the inhibition was not caused by irreversible toxicity mediated by the tumor. Addition of excess IL-2 did not reverse the inhibitory effect, but addition of indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase and prostaglandin synthesis, partially blocked the inhibition.

Moreover, in vitro culture steps may introduce major biases. New approaches to identify tumor-specific CTL clones would be helpful. As a means to describe the in situ immune status by T-cell repertoire analysis, we developed the Immunoscope approach, a PCR-based method that allows us to determine the spectra of CDR3 lengths of the TCR chains displayed by complex populations of T cells. We review here some of our data about melanoma. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes of a melanoma patient were analyzed by different means and melanoma-specific T-cell clones were derived. Two categories of tumor-specific CD8+ CTL clones were derived from the infiltrate of a tumor-proximal invaded lymph node. The majority of T-cell clones specifically lyse the autologous tumor cell lines and predominantly recognize the HLA-A2/MART-1(27-35) peptide complex. The in vivo representativity of such CTL was assessed by the immunoscope technology. Among three MART-1-specific clones, none was detectable in situ. The other kind of tumor-specific CD8+ CTL did not lyse autologous melanoma cell lines but lysed the \"fresh\" autologous tumor cells in a MHC class I dependent manner. The immunoscope approach revealed that one of the latter was detectable in situ among tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes although not among PBMC. These data indicate that melanoma-specific lymphocytes that could not have been selected through conventional screening procedures may be important in tumor rejection. Our results suggest that a better characterization of tumor-specific immune responses will be important for the optimization of specific immunotherapy strategies and the long-term follow-up of patients.",

The four major types of malignant melanoma are lentigo maligna melanoma, acral lentiginous melanoma, superficial spreading melanoma, and nodular melanoma. Lentigo maligna melanoma has irregular margins and usually occurs on sunlight-exposed skin in elderly patients. Acral lentiginous melanoma occurs on the hands and feet; it often demonstrates massive invasion when the vertical growth phase occurs. Among Caucasians, superficial spreading melanoma, which affects the trunk and extremities, is the most common malignant melanoma. These lesions are often variegated in color. Nodular melanomas are deeply pigmented and enlarge rapidly. For microstaging of malignant melanoma, determining Clark's level of tumor invasion or Breslow's thickness (from the top of the granular cell layer of the epidermis to the deepest extension of the tumor) is useful for assessment of prognosis. Establishing a definite diagnosis of malignant melanoma is feasible through clinicopathologic correlation. Microscopic measurement of the deepest levels of melanoma involvement in the skin provides a useful indication of the associated prognosis.",

Twenty-six formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded melanocytic lesions were sectioned and analyzed for telomerase RNA with a radioactive in situ hybridization assay. In situ hybridization studies with a probe to the template RNA component of telomerase confirmed that expression was almost exclusively confined to tumor cells and not infiltrating lymphocytes.

In such a setting where numerous parameters appear to influence survival, a multifactorial analysis using Cox's regression model is a valuable statistical model. Using a computerized data base of 394 clinical stage I melanoma patients treated at this institution during the past 20 years, a multifactorial analysis was used to compare the relative prognostic strength of 11 parameters. Two pathological factors (tumor thickness and ulceration) and two clinial factors (initial surgical treatment and anatomic location) were identified as the dominant prognostic variables. Other factors examined simultaneously that did not provide additional predictive influence on survival included the level of invasion, pigmentation, growth pattern, lymphocyte infiltration, pathological state, sex, and age. Melanoma thickness was the most important factor for predicting survival in patients with stage I melanoma (P less than 10(-8). This parameter is easy to measure and provides a quantitative estimate of clinically occult regional and distant metastases. Contrary to other reports using single factor analysis, the type of initial surgical treatment, in fact, did influence survival after other variables were taken into consideration. Thus the multifactorial analysis supports the observation that patients with intermediate thickness melanoma thickness of 1.5 to 3.99 mm had a 78% 8-year survival rate with wide excision of the melanoma and elective node dissection, while none survived more than 8 years if a melanoma of the same thickness was only widely excised.

These include melanocyte specific proteins, such as tyrosinase, TRP1, TRP2, gp100, and MART-1, cancer-testis antigens, and mutated peptides derived from genetic alterations in melanoma cells. Some of the melanoma reactive T cells appear to respond to cryptic or subdominant self epitopes in melanosomal proteins. Modification of those epitopes to increase their immunogenicity by replacement of amino acids at primary anchor residues for peptide/MHC binding, allowed an improvement in immunotherapy for patients with melanoma. Targets for autoreactive T cells against melanocytes in those autoimmune disorders remain to be identified. Isolation of novel target antigens is important for understanding these pathological T cell responses, as well as for developing new diagnostic and treatment methods for these diseases. A variety of techniques, including cDNA expression cloning with T cells, serological analysis of recombinant cDNA expression libraries (SEREX), cDNA subtraction with representational differential analysis (RDA), and serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) are now being applied to identify novel melanoma/melanocyte antigens recognized by T cells and antibodies.",

Malignant melanoma can express several other types of gangliosides in significant quantities, including GM2 and GD2. Melanoma patients can develop an immune response against some of these ganglioside antigens on autologous melanoma cells. The four major gangliosides expressed by human melanoma cells (GM3, GD3, GM2, and GD2) were examined for their immunomodulatory effect on lymph node lymphocytes from melanoma patients. Gangliosides were added exogenously to lymphocytes grown in the presence of IL-2. Preferential interactions of specific melanoma gangliosides on IL-2 stimulation were found. While GM2 and GD2 enhanced the lymphocyte response to IL-2, GM3 and GD3 significantly inhibited this response. GM2 and GD2 differ from GM3 and GD3 by the presence of a terminal N-acetylgalactosamine. Since different gangliosides can up-regulate and down-regulate lymphocyte responses to IL-2, the ganglioside phenotype of melanoma cells may play a major role in determining whether an individual tumor causes immune stimulation or suppression.",

This in vitro study was undertaken to examine the initial events in the cellular immune response that may occur following the administration of the gamma IFN-transduced cell vaccine. Human melanoma tumor cell lines were transduced with a MoMLV-based retroviral vector carrying the human gamma IFN gene. The transduced cells expressed the cytokine gene, secreted biologically active gamma IFN, and exhibited enhanced expression of MHC class I and class II (HLA-DR), and ICAM-1 surface antigens. The gamma IFN-transduced and corresponding parental melanoma cells were used for the induction of short-term lymphocyte cultures. Peripheral blood lymphocytes or lymph node cells from 20 melanoma patients were stimulated for 5 to 15 days with autologous or MHC class I-matched allogeneic parental or gamma IFN-transduced melanoma cells. Seven of the 20 lymphocyte cultures showed substantial increases in lytic activity following stimulation with the transduced melanoma cells in comparison to control lymphocyte cultures stimulated with unmodified parental melanoma. The cytolytic activity stimulated with gamma IFN-modified melanomas was mediated partly by MHC-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes and partly by NK cells. Lymphocyte cultures that displayed increases in cytotoxicity after stimulation with the gamma IFN-transduced melanoma cells also exhibited enhanced expression or induction of one or more of the following lymphokines: IL-4, IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, gamma IFN, and TNF-alpha.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Previous studies show that upon cell contact, various membrane-associated proteins, such as Ras-family proteins, transfer from B to T and NK lymphocytes. Mutations in RAS genes that encode constitutively active, GTP-bound, oncoproteins are rather common in human cancers; for instance, melanoma. Cancer immunoediting has been postulated to contribute to the elimination of malignant melanoma. Thus, we asked whether Ras oncoproteins can transfer from melanoma to T cells, including tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and subsequently induce functional effects in the adopting T cells. To explore this issue, we genetically engineered an HLA-A2(+) melanoma cell line, MEL526, to express GFP or GFP-tagged H-Ras mutants stably. In this study, we show by an in vitro coculture system that GFP-tagged H-Ras, but not GFP, transfers from MEL526 to T cells and localizes to the inner aspect of their plasma membrane. This cell-contact-dependent process was increased by TCR stimulation and did not require strict Ag specificity. Importantly, we found a positive correlation between the levels of the acquired constitutively active H-RasG12V and ERK1/2 phosphorylation within the adopting TILs. We also show a significant increase in IFN-γ production and cytotoxic activity in TILs that acquired H-RasG12V compared to TILs that acquired a different H-Ras mutant. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate a hitherto unknown phenomenon of intercellular transfer of Ras oncoproteins from melanoma to TILs that consequently augments their effector functions.",

In this study, we evaluated 2 new melanoma markers, monoclonal antibodies KBA62 and PNL2 to yet unidentified antigens, using a large panel of metastatic melanomas (n=214), desmoplastic melanomas (n=34), gastrointestinal mucosal melanomas (n=54), benign nevi (n=27), clear cell sarcomas (n=16), and nonmelanocytic tumors (n=1218). Immunoreactivity for KBA62 and PNL2 was found in all pigmented nevi and in 86% and 90% of metastatic melanomas, respectively. Mucosal melanomas showed a similar rate of PNL2 immunoreactivity but somewhat less frequent KBA62 positivity (72%). In addition, KBA62 was found to be a sensitive diagnostic marker for desmoplastic melanoma (28 of 34; 82%), whereas PNL2 was only rarely positive (2 of 34; 6%). KBA62-positive normal tissues included pericytes, vascular and parenchymal smooth muscles, and basal cells of complex epithelia, including myoepithelia, whereas PNL2 labeled only melanocytes and neutrophils.

PNL2 positivity in nonmelanocytic tumors was more restricted but occurred consistently in angiomyolipoma and other perivascular epitheloid cell tumor and in chronic myeloid leukemia tissue infiltrates. KBA62 may assist in the identification of desmoplastic melanomas, but its widespread occurrence in nonmelanomas limits utility. PNL2 is highly specific for melanomas but lacks reactivity with desmoplastic melanomas. It is also an excellent supplementary marker for perivascular epitheloid cell tumor at various sites.",

However, when the most relevant antigens of a tumor remain to be identified, alternative approaches are required. Formation of a dentritoma, a fused DC and tumor cells hybrid, is one strategy. Although initial studies of these hybrid cells are promising, several limitations interfere with its clinical and commercial application.

Since only limited data exist for human brain metastases, we aimed at characterizing tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and expression of immune checkpoints in the respective tumors. Two brain metastases cohorts, a mixed entity cohort (n = 252) and a breast carcinoma validation cohort (n = 96) were analyzed for CD3+, CD8+, FOXP3+, PD-1+ lymphocytes and PD-L1+ tumor cells by immunohistochemistry. Analyses for association with clinico-epidemiological and neuroradiological parameters such as patient survival or tumor size were performed. TILs infiltrated brain metastases in three different patterns (stromal, peritumoral, diffuse). While carcinomas often show a strong stromal infiltration, TILs in melanomas often diffusely infiltrate the tumors. Highest levels of CD3+ and CD8+ lymphocytes were seen in renal cell carcinomas (RCC) and strongest PD-1 levels on RCCs and melanomas. High amounts of TILs, high ratios of PD-1+/CD8+ cells and high levels of PD-L1 were negatively correlated with brain metastases size, indicating that in smaller brain metastases CD8+ immune response might get blocked. PD-L1 expression strongly correlated with TILs and FOXP3 expression. No significant association of patient survival with TILs was observed, while high levels of PD-L1 showed a strong trend towards better survival in melanoma brain metastases (Log-Rank p = 0.0537). In summary, melanomas and RCCs seem to be the most immunogenic entities. Differences in immunotherapeutic response between tumor entities regarding brain metastases might be attributable to this finding and need further investigation in larger patient cohorts. ",

Cultured TIL have been studied in order to unveil characteristics of TIL and the interactions of TIL and melanoma cells. Whether in vitro cultured TIL mirrors the in situ situation has, however, been questioned. In the present study we have taken advantage of T-cell receptor clonotype mapping methodology to conduct a full and detailed analysis of the T-cell clonotypes in melanoma lesions and in corresponding lines of TIL established in vitro. All melanoma lesions and the corresponding TIL cultures comprised high numbers of T-cell clonotypes, typically in the range of 40 to more than 60. The subsequent comparison of T-cell clonotypes present in the original lesions and in the corresponding T-cell lines established in vitro demonstrated that a very limited number of the T-cell clonotypes established in vitro are identical to the T-cell clonotypes expanded in situ. These results demonstrate that in situ T-cell clonotypes in melanoma are not readily expanded in vitro and that the majority of T-cell clonotypes present in cultured TIL are not present in situ.",

We have previously shown that p42/p44 MAP kinase is activated in radial growth melanoma, suggesting that further signaling events are required for vertical growth melanoma. The molecular events that accompany this transformation are not well understood. Akt, a signaling molecule downstream of PI3K, was introduced into the radial growth WM35 melanoma in order to test whether Akt overexpression is sufficient to accomplish this transformation. Overexpression of Akt led to upregulation of VEGF, increased production of superoxide ROS, and the switch to a more pronounced glycolytic metabolism. Subcutaneous implantation of WM35 cells overexpressing Akt led to rapidly growing tumors in vivo, while vector control cells did not form tumors. We demonstrated that Akt was associated with malignant transformation of melanoma through at least 2 mechanisms. First, Akt may stabilize cells with extensive mitochondrial DNA mutation, which can generate ROS. Second, Akt can induce expression of the ROS-generating enzyme NOX4. Akt thus serves as a molecular switch that increases angiogenesis and the generation of superoxide, fostering more aggressive tumor behavior. Targeting Akt and ROS may be of therapeutic importance in treatment of advanced melanoma.",

These Ag-specific CD8(+) cells displayed paradoxically stronger reactivity as revealed by CD107a degranulation and IFN-γ secretion.

Its similarities with human melanoma make spontaneous canine melanoma an excellent model for comparative studies of novel therapies and tumor biology. We report a pilot study of local adenovector CD40L (AdCD40L) immunogene treatment in 19 cases of canine melanoma (14 oral, 4 cutaneous, and 1 conjunctival). Three patients were World Health Organization stage I, 2 were stage II, 10 stage III, and 4 stage IV. One to 6 intratumoral injections of AdCD40L were given every 7 days, followed by cytoreductive surgery in 9 cases and only immunotherapy in 10 cases. Tumor tissue was infiltrated with T and B lymphocytes after treatment, suggesting immune stimulation. The best overall response included 5 complete responses, 8 partial responses, and 4 stable and 2 progressive disease statuses according to the World Health Organization response criteria. Median survival was 160 days (range, 20-1141 d), with 3 dogs still alive at submission. Our results suggest that local AdCD40L therapy is safe and could have beneficial effects in dogs, supporting further treatment development. Clinical translation to human patients is in progress. ",

Syngeneic B16F10 melanoma cells transplanted intracamerally into C57BL/6 mice produced progressively growing intraocular tumors, yet formed only occasional pulmonary metastases. Neither enucleation nor mechanical manipulation of the melanoma-containing eye promoted a significant increase in the incidence of metastases. Likewise, immunologic impairment in the form of natural killer cell deficiency, T-lymphocyte deficiency, or gamma-irradiation-induced lymphopenia failed to produce spontaneous metastases in intraocular melanoma-bearing mice. However, enucleation in consort with immune impairment (T-cell deficiency) produced a sharp increase in the incidence and number of pulmonary metastases in intraocular melanoma-bearing mice. Further studies showed that external pressure to the tumor-containing globe (without enucleation) produced extensive metastases in athymic, nude mice. By contrast, atraumatic enucleation of rapidly frozen eyes prevented metastasis of intraocular melanomas in similar hosts. Collectively, the results indicate that induction of distant metastases in hosts harboring intraocular melanomas requires two simultaneous processes: (1) mechanical manipulation of the melanoma-containing eye, and (2) concomitant impairment of T-cell-dependent immune processes. The data strongly suggest that mechanical manipulation of melanoma-containing eyes produces intravascular showers of melanoma cells that are rejected by T-cell-dependent immune processes in the immunocompetent host. In the absence of these normal T-cell-dependent immune mechanisms, enucleation-induced showers of blood-borne melanoma cells gain a foothold in the lung and form progressive metastases.",

In primary melanomas and metastatic melanomas, we identified muscarinic receptors in solid strands or groups of atypical cells. In all primary malignant melanomas studied we found inhomogeneous distributions of M35-immunoreactivity subdividing the tumors into three different zones. In the tumor center, groups or single cells often showed only little or even no immunofluorescence. In contrast, pericentrally we detected strong immunostaining in the conglomerations of atypical melanocytes. In the peripheral infiltration zone, intensely fluorescent cells in clusters or single, were spreading into the normal tissue, leading to a more patchy staining pattern.

The numbers of macrophages and microvessels increased significantly with increasing depth of tumor and with tumor angiogenesis. Macrophage infiltration thus appeared to provide a useful diagnostic marker for the progression of cutaneous melanoma. We further examined whether human melanoma cells produce angiogenic factors in response to macrophage-derived cytokines, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1alpha). Treatment of melanoma cells with TNFalpha and IL-1alpha in vitro enhanced the production of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) to a lesser degree, in human melanoma cells. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated human monocytes enhanced production of IL-8, VEGF, TNF alpha, as well as IL-1alpha, but not bFGF. Co-culture of human monocytes and human melanoma cells was also found to significantly enhance production of IL-8 and VEGF in the absence and presence of LPS, compared with either monocytes or melanoma cells alone. The production of IL-8 and VEGF from co-cultured melanoma cells and LPS-activated monocytes was blocked when anti-TNF-alpha antibody or anti-IL-1alpha antibody was co-administrated. This is direct evidence that production of the potent angiogenic factors IL-8 and VEGF from melanoma cells is up-regulated through TNFalpha and/or IL-1alpha secreted by activated monocytes/macrophages, influencing both tumor growth and angiogenesis in melanomas.",

Nevertheless, the majority of patients progress either directly upon therapy or after an initial period of tumor control. Recent data have shown that most TIL products that are used for therapy contain only low frequencies of T cells reactive against known melanoma-associated epitopes. Because of this, the development of a technology to create T-cell products that are enriched for reactivity against defined melanoma-associated antigens would seem valuable, both to evaluate the tumoricidal potential of T cells directed against different antigen classes and to potentially increase response rates. Here, we developed and validated a conditional MHC streptamer-based platform for the creation of TIL products with defined antigen reactivities. We have used this platform to successfully enrich both high-frequency (≥1%) and low-frequency (<1%) tumor-specific CD8(+) T-cell populations, and thereby created T-cell products with enhanced tumor recognition potential. Collectively, these data demonstrate that selection of antigen-specific T-cell populations can be used to create defined T-cell products for clinical use. This strategy thus forms a highly flexible platform for the development of antigen-specific cell products for personalized cancer immunotherapy. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"KIT alterations have been identified in melanoma and treatment with imatinib has met with some success. However, the relationship between KIT and melanoma histology remains uncharacterized, and its role in melanoma pathogenesis unknown. We evaluated 70 melanomas from 70 patients seen at a single institution from 1997 to 2008. Cases were analyzed for KIT protein expression relative to histologic variables: subtype, sun damage, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, melanoma in situ, vertical growth phase (VGP), location, and hyperpigmentation. Twenty-eight cases demonstrated 3+ membranous staining. Univariate analysis revealed 5 significant variables: sun damage (inverse, P = 0.015), tumor location (trunk>extremities>head and neck, P = 0.005), subtype (epithelioid>spindle, mixed>desmoplastic, P < 0.001), VGP (inverse, P = 0.024), and hyperpigmentation [22/26 (85% hyperpigmented cases) and 6/44 (14% nonhyperpigmented cases), P < 0.001]. Upon multivariate analysis, only hyperpigmentation and VGP remained statistically significant (P = 0.002, P = 0.019). Mutational analyses for KIT exons 9 and 11, and BRAF were performed on cases with 3+ labeling. Two of 27 of cases contained mutations in KIT exon 11, whereas only 1 case contained a V600E BRAF mutation, suggesting that KIT and BRAF mutations may be redundant events. Although KIT mutations were uncommon overall, pigmentation in conjunction with immunohistochemistry and nodular growth phase raised their frequency to 2 (40%) of 5 cases. We expand the context of KIT aberrations to involve areas other than acral and mucosal sites and demonstrate an inverse relationship between KIT abnormalities and sun damage. There is a strong correlation to hyperpigmentation that overrides factors including sun damage, tumor location, and histologic subtype, which may be used to identify cases with KIT aberrations.",

An association between the presence of at least one closed vascular loop and death from metastases was shown in a matched-pair, case-control study of 40 patients whose eyes were removed for ciliary body or choroidal melanomas.;Two independent observers who were masked to the follow-up of patients examined histologic preparations of 234 eyes removed for ciliary body or choroidal melanomas for the presence of each of the tumor vascular patterns. Statistical analyses included tests for interobserver reliability, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and the fitting of Cox regression models.;The detection of each of the nine vascular patterns is highly reproducible. The Cox model indicates that the presence of vascular networks, defined as at least three back-to-back closed vascular loops, is the feature most strongly associated with death from metastatic melanoma. Other significant factors in the Cox model include (in descending order of importance) largest tumor dimension, mitoses, the parallel with cross-linking vascular pattern, age, the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and male gender.;The presence of vascular networks provides the most significant association with death from metastatic melanoma of all variables tested. The presence of this pattern should be recorded on pathology reports.

In our current study, wild-type mice were inoculated with melanoma cell line B16-F10 (1 × 10(6)/mouse) and treated with the formyl peptide receptor (FPR) agonist WKYMVm or the FPR antagonist WRW(4). Growth of melanoma cell line B16-F10 was significantly inhibited in WKYMVm-treated mice and markedly promoted in WRW(4)-treated mice compared with control. Decreased number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and increased NK cell infiltration in tumor tissues were detected from WKYMVm-treated mice. Next, we showed that depletion of NK cell significantly increased tumor development in B16 tumor-bearing mice compared with the control group, and the suppressed tumor-developing effect of WKYMVm in B16 melanoma was abrogated with NK cell depletion. We also found that WKYMVm stimulates chemotactic migration in NK cells via the FPR family, and this was dependent on extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) activation. Moreover, in our further experiment, we showed that the increased infiltration of NK cell and promoted NK cell chemotaxis in B16 melanoma induced by WKYMVm were both abolished with ERK inhibitor PD98059 administration. In conclusion, the FPR family promoted NK cell migration through ERK activation and inhibited B16 melanoma growth in a murine model. ",

The peak of incidence lies in the fifth and sixth life decade. Five types of the tumor are known: lentigo maligna melanoma, superficial spreading melanoma, nodular melanoma, acrolentiginous melanoma and non-classifiable melanoma. For estimation of prognosis and choice of adequate mode of therapy histopathological examinations with regard to the level of invasion according to Clark and Chung, histomorphometric evaluation of the depth of invasion suggested by Breslow and the pronostic index of Schmoeckel and Braun-Falco are useful. The operative therapy of choice is the extensive tumor excision. In case of extended local invasion radical vulvectomy is indicated, in certain cases combined with inguinal, sometimes even pelvic lymphonodectomy. In inoperable cases radiotherapy may be tried, but success seems to be poor. Polychemotherapy may induce remissions, but hardly a prolongation of survival. New therapy trials are dealing with immunmodulation, mostly using different substances of biological response modifiers. The prognosis of malignant melanoma of the vulva must be considered to be poorer than that of melanomas in other sites of the body, local recurrence is frequent, the five year survival rate being 30-35%. Whether pregnancy does have an effect on melanoma growth is still unknown.

Elegant genetic manipulation of the mouse immune system has proved this tenet. In parallel, progress in understanding human T cell mediated immunity has allowed to document the existence in cancer patients of naturally acquired T cell responses to molecularly defined tumor antigens. Various attributes of cutaneous melanoma tumors, notably their adaptability to in vitro tissue culture conditions, have contributed to convert this tumor in the prototype for studies of human antitumor immune responses. As a consequence, the first human cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL)-defined tumor antigen and numerous others have been identified using lymphocyte material from patients bearing this tumor, detailed analyses of specific T cell responses have been reported and a relatively large number of clinical trials of vaccination have been performed in the last 15 years. Thus, the \"melanoma model\" continues to provide valuable insights to guide the development of clinically effective cancer therapies based on the recruitment of the immune system.

Here, we report that the suppressive activity of Me is a functional characteristic associated with a particular stage of the disease. In fact, we found that none of the 11 primary tumors tested were able to inhibit the proliferative response of Auto-PBL to Allo-PBL or IL-2 at all the doses of tumor cells used. The generation of lymphocytes cytotoxic against Auto-Me or K562 was also not inhibited.

The role of T lymphocytes in tumor immunity has been extensively studied in melanoma, whereas less is known about the importance of B lymphocytes. The effects of plasma cells (PCs), in particular, are still obscure. The aim of this study was to characterize pathological features and clinical outcome of primary cutaneous melanomas associated with PCs. Moreover, we investigated the origins of the melanoma-associated PCs. Finally, we studied the outcome of patients with primary melanomas with PCs. We reviewed 710 melanomas to correlate the presence of PCs with histological prognostic markers. Immunohistochemistry for CD138 and heavy and light chains was performed in primary melanomas (PM) and in loco-regional lymph nodes (LN), both metastatic and not metastatic. In three PM and nine LN with frozen material, VDJ-rearrangement was analyzed by Gene Scan Analysis. Survival analysis was performed on a group of 85 primary melanomas >2 mm in thickness. Forty-one cases (3.7%) showed clusters/sheets of PCs. PC-rich melanomas occurred at an older age and were thicker, more often ulcerated and more mitotically active (P<0.05). PCs were polyclonal and often expressed IgA in addition to IgG. In LN, clusters/sheets of IgA+ PCs were found both in the sinuses and subcapsular areas. Analysis of VDJ-rearrangements showed the IgA to be oligoclonal. Melanomas with clusters/sheets of PCs had a significantly worse survival compared with melanomas without PCs while, interestingly, melanomas with sparse PCs were associated with a better clinical outcome (P=0.002). In conclusion, melanomas with sheets/clusters of PCs are associated with worse prognosis. IgG and IgA are the isotypes predominantly produced by these PCs.

Pathological examination revealed diffuse infiltration of malignant melanoma cells. Nodal metastasis was seen only in the mesenteric node draining from the tumor-bearing intestinal segment. Twelve months after surgery, melanoma recurred in the liver and para-aortic lymph nodes, where a malignancy of the digestive organs frequently metastasizes; however, no extraperitoneal melanoma was found after repeated examinations.

Moreover, new treatment algorithms favor sequential treatment using BRAF inhibitors and newly developed immunotherapies targeting common T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) or programmed cell death 1 (PD-1). In depth molecular analyses have uncovered new mechanisms of treatment resistance and recurrence, which may impact on future treatment decisions. Moreover, next-generation sequencing data have shown that recurrent lesions harbor specific genetic aberrations. At the same time, high throughput sequencing studies of melanoma unraveled a series of new treatment candidates for future treatment approaches such as ERBB4, GRIN2A, GRM3, and RAC1. More recent bioinformatic technologies provided genetic evidence for extensive tumor heterogeneity and tumor clonality of solid tumors, which might also be of relevance for melanoma. However, these technologies have not yet been applied to this tumor. In this review, an overview on the genetic basis of current treatment of melanoma, treatment resistance and recurrences including new treatment perspectives based on recent high-throughput sequencing data is provided. Moreover, future aspects of individualized treatment based on each patient's individual mutational landscape are discussed. ",

The clinical details were recorded including date of transplant, immunosuppressive therapy, interval between transplant and melanoma, site of occurrence, history of sun exposure, type of clinician diagnosing the melanoma, history of other skin malignancies and outcome. From the histopathology we documented various prognostic factors.;Ten patients developed 12 melanomas (one patient had three melanomas) from a population of 1874 transplanted patients. The total number of transplant years was 11 942.2. The incidence of melanoma in our population was 12 per 11 942.2 transplant years, which is approximately 8 times greater than the standardized rate for this region. We found that the mean interval between transplant and melanoma was approximately 11 years (median 8.5). A dermatologist was the diagnosing clinician in at least 67% of cases. Melanomas occurred on the trunk in the majority of cases (58%), followed by the upper limb (25%). All patients apart from one are alive with no recurrence of their melanoma. One patient died as a result of metastatic melanoma. The mean follow-up period following melanoma was 3.7 years. In all patients apart from the patient who died, the melanomas were < 1 mm Breslow thickness. That patient's melanoma was 4.5 mm thick. There was no precursor naevus in eight of the 12 melanomas. In two there was a precursor dysplastic naevus. In the cases in vertical growth phase the tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte response was absent in four cases and nonbrisk in one patient.;In the Oxford transplant population studied melanomas occurred at approximately 8 times the rate in the general population. This is the highest rate reported in the literature. The patients had a better outcome than reported previously. This may be due to detection at a relatively early stage. Renal transplant recipients attend dedicated dermatology clinics in Oxford, which may have contributed to the early diagnosis and good outcome.",

The peripheral blood mononuclear cells of five melanoma patients were sensitized in vitro with synthetic peptides to elicit antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) lines against four gp100 epitopes. These epitope-specific CTL lines were generated following weekly in vitro stimulation with the synthetic decamer G10(476) (V-L-Y-R-Y-G-S-F-S-V) or the nonamers G9(280) (Y-L-E-P-G-P-V-T-A), G9(154) (K-T-W-G-Q-Y-W-Q-V), or G9(209) (I-T-D-Q-V-P-F-S-V) pulsed onto autologous irradiated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These lines grew as long as 4 months in culture in low-dose interleukin 2 (30 IU/ml) and exhibited antigen-specific, MHC class I-restricted lysis of peptide-pulsed T2 cells and HLA-A2+, gp100+ established melanoma cell lines. G10(476)- and G9(280)-specific CTLs demonstrated specific release of granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor and tumor necrosis factor alpha in response to T2 cells pulsed with relevant peptide, as well as to gp100+ melanoma cell lines. These results demonstrate that several peptides derived from the gp100 protein are presented on the surface of melanoma cells and are sufficiently immunogenic to generate, in vitro, potent CTLs capable of cytolysis and the secretion of cytokines.

Lymphoid cells obtained from buffy coats were separated on Ficoll-Paque, cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen, thawed, and cultured for 1-2 weeks in the presence of crude IL-2 (containing phytohemagglutinin) before injection. CLC were tested for sterility, percent E-rosette-forming cells, and cytotoxicity against K562, allogeneic melanoma, and breast cancer cell lines and autologous tumor cells. Enhanced cytotoxicity was expressed by IL-2 CLC, as compared with nonstimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). Arrest of tumor growth (compared with untreated lesions) was observed in eight lesions and partial regression in three lesions. Moreover, complete regression was noted in one large melanoma lesion treated with low-dose irradiation prior to intralesional administration of CLC and in three small intracutaneous melanoma lesions treated with CLC only. Histopathological findings of responding lesions showed infiltration with lymphoid cells and macrophages, with the tumor cells sparsely dispersed. No untoward side effects of CLC injections were observed. The present study points to the feasibility of trials of adoptive immunotherapy in cancer patients as indicated by the following: (a) response of lymphoid cells to IL-2 adequate--although reduced--in patients with metastatic disease, including those after chemo- or radiotherapy; (b) possibility of cryopreservation of PBL and repeated culturing in IL-2 after thawing, with cytotoxic activity unimpaired; (c) demonstrably enhanced cytotoxicity in vitro of IL-2 CLC; (d) demonstrable--although limited--clinical response to in situ treatments with IL-2 CLC; (e) good tolerance of treatment with CLC.",

These cells express the Foxp3 transcription factor, display an activated phenotype, and display a polyclonal TCR Vbeta chain repertoire. They inhibit in vitro the proliferation and cytokine production of infiltrating CD4(+)CD25(-) and CD8(+) T cells (IL-2, IFN-gamma) through a cell-contact-dependent mechanism, thus behaving as T(reg). In some cases, the presence of T(reg) type 1/Th3-like lymphocytes could also be demonstrated. Thus, T(reg) are a major component of the immunosuppressive microenvironment of metastatic melanoma LNs.

This report describes an extremely rare case of metastatic melanoma presenting as an isolated cerebellopontine angle tumor. Clinically and radiographically, the lesion mimicked an acoustic neuroma. The patient had neuro-otological symptoms, including tinnitus, vertigo, sensorineural hearing loss, facial nerve dysfunction, and prominent cerebellar dysfunction. Magnetic resonance images showed a lesion of the internal auditory canal and cerebellopontine angle that was hypointense on T1-weighted images, hyperintense on T2-weighted images, and enhanced after the administration of gadolinium. T2-weighted images showed significant cerebellar edema. Subtotal resection of the tumor through a suboccipital craniotomy palliated the symptoms, but the patient died of tumor progression 6 months later. In contrast to other metastatic tumors of the temporal bone, melanoma initially metastasizes to the internal auditory canal and is characterized by early neurovascular infiltration.

CTLA-4 is expressed on naïve T cells and regulatory T cells. Ipilimumab, an anti-CTLA-4 antibody, shows a distinct durable clinical benefit by inhibiting the immunosuppressive function of CTLA-4. PD-1, which is expressed on activated T cells, inhibits T cell responses against tumor cells. The antibodies against PD-1, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, produce anti-tumor responses in melanoma and other cancers due to T cell reactivation. Furthermore, clinical trials of combination therapies using immune checkpoint blockades with molecularly targeted therapies and other chemotherapeutic agents are being conducted. However, immune checkpoint blockades frequently cause immune-related adverse events.

Careful and precise diagnosis and staging are essential to determine patient's risk and to select appropriate treatments. Fortunately, the recent progress in immunotherapy is very encouraging. In this context, it is important to characterize the intratumoral infiltration of immune cells in each patient, which is however not done routinely due to the lack of standardized methods. In this study, we used Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) imaging combined with multivariate statistical analyses to investigate non-metastatic and metastatic lymph nodes from melanoma patients. Our results show that the different cell types have different infrared spectral features allowing automated identification of these cell types. High recognition rates were obtained using a supervised partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model. Melanoma cells were recognized with 87.1% sensitivity and 85.7% specificity, showing that FTIR spectroscopy has similar detection power as immunohistochemistry. Besides, FTIR imaging could also distinguish lymphocyte subpopulations (B and T cells). Finally, we investigated the changes in lymphocytes due to the presence of metastases. Interestingly, specific features of spectra of lymphocytes present in metastatic or tumor-free lymph nodes could be evidenced by PCA. A PLS-DA model was capable of predicting whether lymphocytes originated from invaded or non-invaded lymph nodes. These data demonstrate that FTIR imaging is capable to distinguish known and also novel biological features in human tissues, with potential practical relevance for histopathological diagnosis and biomarker assessment.

The poor prognosis may be explained by the patients' delay in seeking medical advice, which is stressed by the deep and massive infiltration of the extensive primary lesions as well as by the fact that metastases already were demonstrable in most patients at the first examination. A necessary condition for radical surgical therapy, and therefore an improvement in the very bad prognosis of oral malignant melanomas, is an earlier diagnosis than in the present series.

To determine the microanatomical location and the species of chemokines possibly involved in the intricate control of cell migration and positioning of immune effector cells in primary and metastatic MM lesions, the expression of those chemokines with lymphocyte and/or macrophage chemoattractant properties was analysed by in situ hybridization. GROalpha (growth-related oncogene) and IL-8 (interleukin 8) were expressed at low levels by single melanoma cells, adjacent keratinocytes, and infiltrating leukocytes. In contrast, the lymphocyte-specific chemokine Mig (monokine induced by interferon-gamma) was strongly expressed by mononuclear cells (mainly macrophages) infiltrating the tumour margin in primary MM lesions, whereas expression was less intense in MM metastasis. IP-10 (interferon-gamma inducible protein 10) was expressed in the same loci at lower intensity. Marked infiltration of T cells was exclusively detected in those areas which exhibited strong Mig expression, whereas areas in the vicinity of tumour cells devoid of Mig expression were not infiltrated. In contrast to Mig, expression of MCP-1 (macrophage chemotactic protein-1) was weaker and mainly detected in lesional basal keratinocytes, occasionally at sites of macrophage infiltration, as well as in single melanoma cells. MIP-1alpha (macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha) showed similar, albeit weaker expression compared with MCP-1. Other chemokines relevant for the recruitment of monocytes and lymphocytes, such as RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cells expressed and secreted) and MIP-1beta, were barely detectable. In summary, the chemokine expression profiles support the notion that particularly in heavily infiltrated primary MM lesions, Mig and to a lesser extent IP-10 are important mediators of an IFN-gamma-dependent pathway. Due to their lymphoattractant properties and the known inhibitory effects on the tumour vasculature, both chemokines may be critical for the control of local melanoma tumour growth.",

Clinical trails and in vitro studies have focused on CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell receptor (TCR) alphabeta lymphocytes since these cells directly kill virally infected- and tumor cells after antigen-specific recognition via their TCR alphabeta. However, increasing evidence suggests that induction of sustained immunity against cancer and viral infections depends on the presence of tumor- or virus-specific CD4+ T lymphocytes, which are restricted by MHC class II. Here, we show that these MHC class II-restricted CD4+ T lymphocytes can efficiently be redirected to MHC class I-restricted tumor cells by retroviral introduction of an HLA-A1/MAGE-A1-specific chimeric two-chain TCR ValphaCalphazeta/VbetaCbetazeta (tcTCR/zeta). However, TCR-transduced CD4+ T lymphocytes were only able to specifically bind to HLA-A1/MAGE-A1 complexes and respond to HLA-A1+/MAGE-A1+ melanoma cells when the CD8alpha gene was cointroduced. These CD4+/CD8alpha+/TCR(POS) T lymphocytes produce IFN-gamma, TNFalpha and IL-2 when specifically stimulated via the introduced TCR with immobilized HLA-A1/MAGE-A1 complexes or HLA-A1+/MAGE-A1+ melanoma cells. Furthermore, introduction of the CD8alpha gene into TCR(POS) T lymphocytes rendered these T lymphocytes cytotoxic for HLA-A1+/MAGE-A1+ melanoma cells. These results demonstrate that human CD4+ T lymphocytes when genetically grafted with an HLA-A1/MAGE-A1-specific TCR and CD8alpha are induced to kill and produce cytokines upon specific interaction with the relevant melanoma cells. Hence, CD4+ T lymphocytes, in addition to CD8+ T lymphocytes, may be critical effector cells for adoptive immuno-gene therapy to generate a sustained tumor-specific immune response in cancer patients.",

We previously showed that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) from human melanoma and renal cell carcinoma demonstrate a dramatic decrease in their spontaneous locomotion through three-dimensional collagen gel when compared with peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and lymph node lymphocytes. To determine if this decrease is caused by contact with tumor cells, or mediated through certain diffusible factors, we examined the effects of autologous tumor cells on the locomotion of PBL in a model system where tumor cells were separated from lymphocytes by a 3-mm layer of gelled collagen. After 21-22 h incubation in chamber slides, locomotion distances were assessed in the presence and absence of tumor and normal cells. In the presence of tumor cells, PBL from 14 of 18 patients displayed substantial (466.5 +/- 2.7 microns compared to control 568.9 +/- 10.9 microns, P < 0.001) loss of motility. Inhibition was more prominent in melanoma patients than in renal cell carcinoma patients. Thus the impaired locomotion previously observed in TIL was at least partially due to the presence of tumor. The locomotion of TIL was restored in four of five melanoma patients treated with liposome-encapsulated muramyl-tripeptide-phosphatidylethanolamine (L-MTP-PE). Furthermore, in six of seven examined L-MTP-PE-treated patients, an increase in intrinsic PBL locomotion during the first month of the therapy was observed.

Tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells (TIDCs) play diverse roles in the regulation of tumor regression or growth, but the characteristics that distinguish those effects are obscure. In this study, we investigated the frequency, phenotype, and function of TIDCs over time from early stages of melanoma growth in mice. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the tumors were infiltrated by a significant population of CD11c(+) major histocompatibility complex II(+) DCs, especially at an early stage of tumor growth. The allogeneic stimulatory capacity of TIDCs increased with tumor growth, whereas this capacity of DCs in lymph nodes decreased. TIDCs harvested at an early stage of melanoma (early TIDCs) accelerated tumor growth, but those harvested at a late stage (late TIDCs) delayed tumor progression when they were coinjected with melanoma cells. Furthermore, coinjection of early TIDCs failed to induce full immunocompetent maturation of CD8(+) T cells, with much lower expression of IFN-γ, granzyme B, and perforin within the tumor microenvironment. In conclusion, TIDCs change their characteristics from an immunoinhibitory to an immunostimulatory phenotype over time in association with tumor progression.",

We tested the hypothesis that improved detection and characterization of neural infiltration into peritumoral or intratumoral location and perineural or intraneural involvement could have a prognostic relevance. We studied 128 primary melanoma cases prospectively accrued and followed at New York University using immunohistochemical detection with antihuman neurofilament protein and routine histology with hematoxylin and eosin. Neural infiltration, defined as the presence of tumor cells involving or immediately surrounding nerve foci, was identified and characterized using both detection methods. Neural infiltration rate of detection was enhanced by immunohistochemistry for neurofilament in matched-pair design (47% by immunohistochemistry versus 25% by routine histology). Immunohistochemical detection of neural infiltration was significantly associated with ulceration (P = .021), desmoplastic and acral lentiginous histologic subtype (P = .008), and head/neck/hands/feet tumor location (P = .037). Routinely detected neural infiltration was significantly associated with local recurrence (P = .010). Immunohistochemistry detected more intratumoral neural infiltration cases compared with routine histology (30% versus 3%, respectively). Peritumoral and intratumoral nerve location had no impact on clinical outcomes. Using a multivariate model controlling for stage, neither routinely detected neural infiltration nor enhanced immunohistochemical characterization of neural infiltration was significantly associated with disease-free or overall survival. Our data demonstrate that routinely detected neural infiltration is associated with local recurrence in all histologic subtypes but that improved detection and characterization of neural infiltration with immunohistochemistry in primary melanoma does not add to prognostic relevance.

Efforts to define the cytoarchitecture of the angiogenic response and to ascertain molecular determinants of polarized endothelial migration have been impeded by lack of sensitive and specific immunologic markers for endothelium and vessel wall components. In this study, we utilized monoclonal antibody to platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1), a cell-cell adhesion molecule belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, to determine extent and patterns of angiogenesis in metastatic melanomas before (N = 7) and after (N = 3) induction of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte responses provoked by administration of experimental melanoma vaccine. PECAM-1 proved to be a more reliable marker for angiogenesis than antibodies to von Willebrand Factor. Although both normal and tumor vessels exhibited prominent staining for PECAM-1, different patterns of endothelial reactivity were observed. Formation of new vessels was associated with i) PECAM-1 redistribution from a constitutive circumferential membrane pattern to a pattern restricted to cell-cell junctions; ii) formation of endothelial cords formed by cell-cell interactions; and iii) eventual development of open lumens. Vessels within inflamed (vaccine-treated) and non-inflamed melanomas did not differ with regard to patterns of PECAM-1 expression. Forming vessels of inflamed melanomas failed to express the cytokine-inducible activation marker, E-selectin. Although normal microvessels and reactive vessels of healing wounds demonstrated prominent staining for alpha 6 laminin receptor, vessels within melanomas showed apparently diminished expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Although memory T cells have been presumed to be potentially advantageous for ACT, the kinetics of local and systemic T cell responses after effector and memory ACT have not been compared. B16F10 melanoma cells stably transfected to express very low levels of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) peptide GP33 (B16GP33) were inoculated into syngeneic C57BL/6 mice. Equal numbers of bona fide naïve, effector, or memory phenotype GP33-specific CD8+ T cells were adoptively transferred into mice 1 day after B16GP33 inoculation. The efficacy of ACT immunotherapy was kinetically assessed using serial tumor measurements and flow cytometric analyses of local and systemic CD8+ T cell responses. Control of B16GP33 tumor growth, persistence of adoptively transferred CD8+ cells, intratumoral infiltration of CD8+ T cells, and systemic CD8+ T cell responsiveness to GP33 were strongest after ACT of memory CD8+ T cells. Following surgical tumor resection and melanoma tumor challenge, only mice receiving memory T cell-based ACT immunotherapy exhibited durable tumor-specific immunity.

From these MLTC-responder cells, we derived specific cytolytic T cell (CTL) clones that lysed the autologous melanoma cells and did not lyse K-562 or autologous EBV-B cells. Autologous melanoma clones were found that were resistant to some or all of these CTL clones. The autologous CTL clones recognized at least two different antigens (A, B) on the melanoma cells and three types of melanoma clones could be distinguished (A+B+, A+B-, A-B-). This antigenic heterogeneity of melanoma clones was confirmed by testing the CTL clones in cold target competition and also in antigen-dependent CTL proliferation assays performed with very small numbers of stimulator cells. The data further indicated an instability of the expression of a melanoma-associated antigen in the course of a long culture period. Among the melanoma clones that expressed antigen A, one was found to stimulate the proliferation of anti-A CTL clones much more effectively than the others. This represents a new type of heterogeneity among tumor cells which may be of significance for the elicitation of an autologous anti-tumoral immune response.",

Renewed optimism for the therapeutic potential of immune therapy is currently driven by key advances in tumor immunobiology, including the potential to manipulate and disrupt immune activation checkpoints and tumor defense mechanisms; newer approaches to antigen presentation for immune activation; refinements to procedures for antigen-specific T-cell expansions in vitro and preparative regimens to support their expansion and activity in vivo; gene transfer to alter lymphocyte specificity and function; and the potential for discovery of improved predictive biomarkers to select patients for individual treatments. Proof of concept is provided by durable remissions observed in patients with advanced melanoma enrolled in clinical trials of anti-CTLA-4 and in new studies of adoptively transferred tumor antigen-specific lymphocytes combined with lymphocyte ablation conditioning regimens.

An associated intraepidermal melanocytic proliferation was identified in 85% of the patients (lentigo maligna in 56%). Histologically, the dermal tumors were composed of tapered, nonpigmented spindle cells in peripheral nerve sheath patterns resembling neuromas, schwannomas, neurofibromas, and perineurial proliferations accompanied by variable neurotropism and desmoplasia; desmoplasia was the most notable feature in most tumors. The mean depth of tumor invasion was 4.1 mm (range, 0.32-9.0 mm). Tumors with continuity between the epidermal and dermal components had a significantly thinner depth of invasion and a more extensive intraepidermal melanocytic proliferation than those tumors with a grenz zone between the two components (2.3 mm vs. 4.6 mm, P = 0.015). Mitotic activity ranged from 0/HPF in 10 cases, 1-6/high power field (HPF) in 12 cases, and to greater than 6/HPF in 4 cases. An ulcer was present in 5/27 tumors, regression in 4/27, a microsatellite in 1, and brisk and had nonbrisk tumor infiltrating lymphocytic responses in 2 and 14, respectively. Vimentin was uniformly positive and keratins AE1.3 and Cam 5.2 and Leu-7 were uniformly negative. S100 protein, also uniformly positive, had patchy reactivity in most tumors that expressed EMA (43%). Smooth muscle actin (52%), neuron-specific enolase (42%), and FXIIIa (30%) had patchy positivity. HMB-45 was reactive only in the epidermal and superficial papillary dermal component in 21% of cases. Ultrastructurally, the common features were long, often intertwining cellular processes, intercellular junctions, and discontinuous basal lamina. Melanosomes were not identified. Follow-up data available on 26/28 patients (mean, 36 months; median, 24 months; range, 5-132 months) showed 20 (70%) alive without disease, 2 alive with disease and 3 dead from disease. Seven patients had recurrent local tumor (multiple in four); four had lymph node metastases, and three had visceral metastases. Patients with recurrent disease of any type had significantly thicker tumors (5.4 mm vs. 3.4 mm, P = 0.046) and were more likely to have an ulcerated tumor (P = 0.03). Actuarial 5-year survival for tumors with greater than a 4-mm thickness was 72%, which was greater than that for other types of melanoma with greater than a 4-mm thickness.;Desmoplastic neurotropic melanomas are neuroectodermal tumors that usually arise from an intraepidermal melanocytic proliferation but rarely develop de novo in the dermis. Schwannian and perineurial differentiation may account for the desmoplasia and neurotropism encountered in these neoplasms. Desmoplastic neurotropic melanomas present at a more advanced stage locally and may be associated with a better survival than associated with conventional melanomas of similar depth of invasion.",

Nonetheless, only a few mutated epitopes efficiently presented by human tumors have thus far been identified. We describe here an approach to identify such epitopes. This approach involves: 1) identifying tumors expressing a ras mutation and isolating the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL); 2) transfecting COS cells to induce expression of unknown mutated peptides in the context of a patient's HLA class I molecules; and 3) screening epitope recognition by using TIL from the tumors expressing a ras mutation. By using this approach, there appeared to be a N-ras mutation (a glutamine-to-arginine exchange at residue 61 (Q61R)), detected in a melanoma lesion, which was recognized specifically by the autologous TIL in the HLA-A*0101 context. The ras peptide 55-64(Q61R) was the epitope of these TIL and was regularly presented by Q61R-mutated HLA-A*0101(+) melanoma cell lines. This peptide and its wild-type homolog (55-64(wt)) bound to HLA-A*0101 with similar affinities. However, only the mutated peptide could induce specific CTL expansion from PBL. All the CTL clones specific to the mutated peptide, failed to recognize the wild-type sequence on both COS and melanoma cells. These data thus show that oncogenic protein mutations can create shared tumor-specific CTL epitopes, efficiently presented by tumor cells, and that screening for oncogene-transfected COS cell recognition by TIL (from tumors containing mutations) is a powerful approach for the identification of these epitopes.",

We show that combined administration of IFN-I and DAC significantly inhibits the growth of murine and human melanoma cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Compared to controls, DAC/IFN-I-treated melanoma cells exhibited reduced cell growth, augmented apoptosis, and diminished migration. Moreover, IFN-I and DAC synergized to suppress the growth of 3D-human melanoma spheroids altering tumor architecture.

Despite the remarkable clinical efficacy and established involvement of effector CD8 T cells, the knowledge of the exact peptide-MHC complexes recognized by T cells on the tumor cell surface is limited. Many melanoma-associated T-cell epitopes have been described, but this knowledge remains largely restricted to HLA-A2, and we lack understanding of the T-cell recognition in the context of other HLA molecules. We selected six melanoma-associated antigens (MAGE-A3, NY-ESO-1, gp100, Mart1, tyrosinase and TRP-2) that are frequently recognized in patients with the aim of identifying novel T-cell epitopes restricted to HLA-A1, -A3, -A11 and -B7. Using in silico prediction and in vitro confirmation, we identified 127 MHC ligands and analyzed the T-cell responses against these ligands via the MHC multimer-based enrichment of peripheral blood from 39 melanoma patients and 10 healthy donors. To dissect the T-cell reactivity against this large peptide library, we used combinatorial-encoded MHC multimers and observed the T-cell responses against 17 different peptide-MHC complexes in the patient group and four in the healthy donor group. We confirmed the processing and presentation of HLA-A3-restricted T-cell epitopes from tyrosinase (TQYESGSMDK) and gp100 (LIYRRRLMK) and an HLA-A11-restricted T-cell epitope from gp100 (AVGATKVPR) via the cytolytic T-cell recognition of melanoma cell lines and/or K562 cells expressing the appropriate antigen and HLA molecule.

Combination trials of IL-2 with IL-4 have shown no increase in responsiveness of melanoma or other tumors when compared to IL-2 alone. However, enhanced expansion of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in vitro has been observed with combinations of low-dose IL-2 and IL-4. We have begun a study evaluating the trafficking of such expanded lymphocytes following their adoptive transfer in association with systemic administration of IL-2 and IL-4. We have established several TIL cultures from fresh tumor samples, maintained them in long-term culture, and marked them with the neomycin phosphotransferase gene using the LNL6 retroviral vector. Such TILs appear to demonstrate no notable alterations in phenotype or cytolytic activity when compared to their nontransduced counterparts.

This can be explained by the heterogeneous nature of cutaneous melanoma that expresses various levels of melanoma antigens, peptides and has various genetic profiles among different patients. From an immunological point of view, it is illogic to eliminate the tumor and its specific antigens then apply allogenic type of therapy and expect a tumor response. Therefore, it is more logical is to utilize the tumor site as a source for the tumor-specific antigens. In the meantime, patients with in-transit metastases can give us an excellent opportunity to evaluate the local and systemic effects of intralesional (intratumoral) therapy, and various agents have been utilized with equivocal results. On the other hand, intralesional administration of 2 cytokines seemed to process the tumor antigens and activates thymic-derived lymphocytes (T cells).

Among the treatment options for cancer that have emerged in the past 100 years, cancer vaccine immunotherapy seems to present a promising and relatively safer approach as compared to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The identification of different tumour antigens in the last fifteen years using a variety of techniques, together with the molecular cloning of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)- and tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)-defined tumour antigens allowed more refining of the cancer vaccines that are currently used in different clinical trials. In a proportion of treated patients, some of these vaccines have resulted in partial or complete tumour regression, while they have increased the disease-free survival rate in others. These outcomes are more evident now in patients suffering from melanoma. This review provides an update on melanoma vaccine immunotherapy. Different cancer antigens are reviewed with a detailed description of the melanoma antigens discovered so far. The review also summarises clinical trials and individual clinical cases in which some of the old and current methods to vaccinate against or treat melanoma were used.

One strategy that is likely to enhance the success rate of TCR gene therapy is the use of tumor-reactive TCRs with a higher capacity for tumor cell recognition. We therefore sought to develop standardized procedures for the selection of well-expressed, high-affinity, and safe human TCRs. Here we show that TCR surface expression can be improved by modification of TCR alpha and beta sequences and that such improvement has a marked effect on the in vivo function of TCR gene-modified T cells. From a panel of human, melanoma-reactive TCRs we subsequently selected the TCR with the highest affinity. Furthermore, a generally applicable assay was used to assess the lack of alloreactivity of this TCR against a large series of common human leukocyte antigen alleles.

D-loop region from 20 melanoma cell lines, 12 metastatic melanoma specimens, and corresponding lymphocytes and plasma samples were sequenced using the CEQ 8000 XL Genetic Analysis System (Beckman Coulter). Nine of 20 (45%) melanoma cell lines and 5 of 12 (42%) melanoma specimens contained somatic mutations in the D-loop region of mtDNA. DNA alterations in the polycytosine tract (C-tract) of D-loop were detected in 6 of 20 (30%) cell lines and 2 of 12 (17%) specimens. Two of five paired plasma samples (40%) contained the same mutations as did melanoma specimens. In a comparison of lymphocytes and plasma of melanoma patients, 9 of 44 paired plasma samples (20%) contained at least one mutation compared to corresponding lymphocytes. Somatic mutations in the D-loop region of tumor and paired plasma did not correlate with the clinicopathological characteristics. However, circulating mtDNA alterations were more frequent in advanced disease. Studies indicate that circulating mtDNA mutations in the plasma of melanoma patients can be detected.",

We compared the transcriptome of \"exhausted\" CD8 T cells infiltrating autochthonous melanomas to those of naïve and acutely stimulated CD8 T cells. Despite strong similarities between transcriptional signatures of tumor- and virus-induced exhausted CD8 T cells, notable differences appeared. Among transcriptional regulators, Nr4a2 and Maf were highly overexpressed in tumor-exhausted T cells and significantly upregulated in CD8 T cells from human melanoma metastases. Transduction of murine tumor-specific CD8 T cells to express Maf partially reproduced the transcriptional program associated with tumor-induced exhaustion. Upon adoptive transfer, the transduced cells showed normal homeostasis but failed to accumulate in tumor-bearing hosts and developed defective anti-tumor effector responses. We further identified TGFβ and IL-6 as main inducers of Maf expression in CD8 T cells and showed that Maf-deleted tumor-specific CD8 T cells were much more potent to restrain tumor growth in vivo. Therefore, the melanoma microenvironment contributes to skewing of CD8 T cell differentiation programs, in part by TGFβ/IL-6-mediated induction of Maf. ",

Although surgical margins have decreased in recent years, the current recommendations are mainly based on arbitrary choices, only two of which have been tested in clinical trials.;Our purpose was to use prospective data, measuring the extent of subclinical melanoma extensions, to develop guidelines for predetermined surgical margins for the excision of cutaneous melanoma.;A prospectively collected series of 535 patients with 553 primary cutaneous melanomas was studied. All melanomas were excised by means of the fresh tissue technique of Mohs micrographic surgery with frozen section examination of the margin. The surgical margin needed for excision of melanoma was determined by measuring the invisible extensions of tumor around the melanoma. The minimum surgical margin was 6 mm and the total margin was calculated by adding an additional 3 mm for any melanoma requiring a subsequent stage to remove the tumor completely.;Eighty-three percent of melanomas were successfully excised with a 6 mm margin; 9 mm removed 95% of the melanomas; and a 1.2 cm margin was necessary to remove 97% of all melanomas. Margins to remove melanomas on the head, neck, hands, and feet were wider than those on the trunk and extremities. Margins to remove melanomas that were more than 2 to 3 cm in diameter were wider than for smaller melanomas.;Predetermined surgical margins for excision of melanoma or melanoma in situ by standard surgical techniques should include 1 cm of normal-appearing skin for melanomas on the trunk and proximal extremities that are smaller than 2 cm in diameter, or a 1.5 cm margin for tumors larger than 2 cm in diameter. For melanomas on the head, neck, hands, and feet, a minimum surgical margin of 1.5 cm is recommended or a margin of 2.5 cm for melanomas larger than 3 cm in diameter. Mohs micrographic surgery is a useful alternative to standard surgery when more narrow margins are desired, particularly for melanomas on the head, neck, hands, and feet, or melanomas larger than 2.5 cm in diameter, or for melanomas without distinct clinical margins.",

We evaluated alternative approaches for classifying this covariate when constructing predictive models of patient survival.;The analyses were based on a consecutive series of 1848 primary choroidal and/or ciliary body melanoma patients treated with proton beam irradiation (70 cobalt gray equivalent in 5 fractions) at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory, Boston, Mass, between July 1975 and December 1995. For each patient, the anatomic site of the tumor was classified according to an estimate of the proportion of the tumor base lying anterior to the ora serrata. Using proportional hazards regression, we estimated relative risk ratios and death rates from melanoma metastasis according to the extent of ciliary body involvement. All estimates were adjusted for other established prognostic factors.;Patients were followed up through April 30, 1998; none were lost to follow-up. Of 1848 patients analyzed, 378 died of melanoma metastasis. The median follow-up period among survivors was 9.5 years. Ciliary body origin (>50% of tumor base anterior to the ora serrata) was positively associated with tumor pigmentation (P<.001), tumor height (P<.001), and extrascleral extension of the tumor (P<.001). Compared with tumors involving only the choroid, melanoma-associated death rates increased with the proportion of the tumor base lying within the ciliary body (P =. 006); the multivariate-adjusted relative risk ratio for greater than 75% involvement was 2.30 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-4.23). The covariate-adjusted 5-year death rates for ciliary body origin and choroidal origin were 15.9% (95% CI, 11.3%-21.2%) and 9.8% (95% CI, 8.3%-11.7%), respectively.;Patients with melanomas of presumed ciliary body origin seem to be subject to a higher risk of death resulting from melanoma metastasis.

In this paper we have outlined the suppressor system that best fits the published data. The regulatory system is composed of CD4+ T-lymphocytes which have been activated and programmed to secrete Th2 cytokines. Initially these cells do not secrete cytokines, but subsequently they enter an IL-10 secretory phase as a result of T-T cell interaction. After activation, Th1 programmed T-cells express MHC class II molecules and B7 second signals. When these Th1 T-cells express MHC II molecules containing 'self' polypeptides coupled with faulty B7-H1 second signals they are subject to inactivation by Th2 T-cells. If this system can be inactivated, immunotherapy of melanoma will be more successful. If an antigen can be discovered that stimulates sensitized Th2 T-cells without stimulating Th1 T-cells, this antigen, followed with cyclophosphamide, can be used to destroy the Th2 T-cells in the course of both active and passive immunotherapy. Solubilized MHC II molecules with appropriate 'self' polypeptides should qualify as such an antigen.

The outcome of immune responses is critically influenced by a complex network of interacting cytokines present in the local microenvironment. Analysis of cytokine gene transcription in melanoma lesions exhibiting or lacking a sufficient anti-tumor immune response thus may help to define cytokines or cytokine combinations critical to the development of this immune response. In the present study, we have investigated an extended panel of cytokine and cytokine receptor genes by reverse transcription-PCR and in situ hybridization in regressive and progressive primary human cutaneous melanoma samples. Whereas the presence of a lymphocyte infiltrate in tissue samples was associated with a TH1 cytokine mRNA profile (TNF-alpha, INF-gamma, IL12p35, IL12p40, IL2Rbeta, and IL2Rgamma), clinically and histologically regressive samples exhibited additionally increased transcript levels for GM-CSF, IL2, and IL15. mRNAs of TH2 cytokines IL4 and IL5 were detected only in a minor portion of progressive melanoma samples and regressive melanoma lesions. These results were further supported by comparison of progressive with regressive regions in three melanoma samples. Again, regressive regions contained higher transcript levels for GM-CSF, IL2, and IL15. In comparison to cutaneous metastatic melanoma lesions, regressive melanomas also overexpressed the same cytokine mRNA profile. These results provide evidence for an association of spontaneous regression with increased transcript levels for the cytokine combination GM-CSF, IL2, and IL15 in malignant melanoma. This cytokine combination could be relevant for experimental anti-tumor immune response studies and for immunotherapeutic and gene transfer studies in the treatment of melanoma patients.",

The ability of these cells to produce opioids was studied by Western blots in vitro. Finally, biopsy material from human melanomas was investigated by immunohistochemistry for ß endorphin expression. Injection of B16 melanoma cells, producing endogenous ß endorphin, in the flank of MOR-/- mice revealed a profound reduction in tumor growth, paralleled by a significantly higher infiltration of immune cells into the tumors, when compared to tumor growth after injection of B16 melanoma cells into wild-type mice. Opioids present in B16 cell supernatant significantly reduced the proliferation of normal but not MOR-/- leucocytes. Immunohistochemical analyses of biopsies from human melanoma tissues showed a positive correlation between expression of ß endorphin and tumor progression. Our data provide evidence that μ-opioid peptides may play a major role in cancer progression by modulating immune response. This finding may have implications for the future optimization of immunointerventions for cancer.",

In a strictly autologous system, we fused dendritic cells with melanoma cells, both of which were derived from patients with metastatic malignant melanoma. Hybridomas were positive for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, CD40, CD54, CD83, CD86, and the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-12. Autologous T lymphocytes were co-incubated with hybridomas. After 6 days, in-vitro-primed T lymphocytes revealed a strong proliferation activity and released Th-1-associated, but not Th-2-associated, cytokines. Furthermore they showed effective anti-melanoma activity, resulting in death of 70 +/- 9% of autologous melanoma cells. After depletion of CD4+ cells from the mixed population of primed T lymphocytes, the remaining CD8+ cells were able to kill 63+/-8% of autologous melanoma cells. Following depletion of CD8+ cells, however, the cytotoxic capacity of the remaining T lymphocytes caused death in only 32+/-6% of autologous melanoma cells. Blocking of MHC class I, but not class II, molecules on hybridomas impaired T cell proliferation, secretion of Th-1-associated cytokines, as well as the cytotoxic activity of primed T cells. These findings strongly suggest that hybridomas deliver melanoma-associated antigens via MHC class I molecules to T lymphocytes, resulting in the generation of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes with effective anti-melanoma activity in vitro. The data may serve as a basis for the use of hybridomas in the immunotherapy of malignant melanoma in vivo.",

Besides promising approaches based on T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells have gained more and more attention as anti-melanoma effector cells. NK cell activation is inhibited by HLA class I molecules expressed by target cells, so they preferentially attack tumor cells that express low levels of HLA class I. Partial or complete loss of HLA class I expression is a frequent event during the development of melanoma. In parallel, ligands for activating NK cell receptors become induced upon malignant transformation. Thus, melanoma cells are often efficiently recognized and lysed by NK cells at least in vitro. In vivo, however, melanomas have developed multiple sophisticated strategies to escape from NK cell mediated attack. Several novel approaches aim at harnessing NK cells to treat melanoma patients and to counteract existing tumor escape mechanisms. This review summarizes the most recent advances in the field. ",

The aim of this paper is to update clinical results of 7 years of follow-up after the last treated patient. In the trial conducted between December 1993 and January 1999, patients without any detectable metastases after lymph node excision were randomly assigned to receive either TIL plus interleukin-2 (IL-2) for 2 months, or IL-2 only. The duration of the relapse-free interval was the primary objective. Eighty-eight patients were enrolled in the study. Currently, the last analysis performed in June 2006, after a median follow-up of 114.8 months, did not show change of non-significant extension of the relapse-free interval or overall survival. However, this second analysis strengthens our first hypothesis about the relationship between number of invaded lymph nodes and TIL treatment effectiveness. In the group with only one invaded lymph node, the estimated relapse rate was significantly lower (P (adjusted) = 0.0219) and the overall survival was increased (P (adjusted) = 0.0125) in the TIL+IL-2 arm compared with the IL-2 only arm. No differences between the two arms, either with regard to the duration of disease-free survival (P (adjusted) = 0.38) or overall survival (P (adjusted) = 0.43), were noted in the group with more than one invaded lymph node, whatever the number of invaded lymph nodes. Treatment was compatible with normal daily activity. This study, with a very long follow up (median of almost 10 years), postulates for the first time relationship between TIL efficiency in stage III melanoma (AJCC) and number of invaded lymph nodes, indicating that tumor burden might be a crucial factor in the production of an effective in vitro expansion of T cells specific for autologous tumor antigen, a finding which could be of value in future vaccine development for the treatment of melanoma.",

A 53-year-old male was diagnosed with uveal melanoma with extraescleral extension in his left eye. A year later, the fundus examination revealed a flat, gray-green, pigmented choroidal lesion in the right eye. The ultrasonography showed a mass, almost flat, and all these findings were compatible with a choroidal melanocytic lesion with risk factors for growth. One month later, melanocytic skin lesions appeared on the scalp, as well as small tumors. Three months later, an ultrasonography on B scan showed a growth of the tumor size. The patient developed a progressive deterioration and died. Three possibilities can explain the occurrence of a choroidal pigmented tumor in the contralateral eye: first, bilateral primary choroidal melanomas; second, both choroidal tumors are metastatic in origin from an unknown primary melanoma; and third, the contralateral tumor is a metastatic tumor from the primary choroidal melanoma.

In this study, we have serially monitored mononuclear cells in peripheral blood and tumour biopsies from 13 patients with metastatic malignant melanoma treated under a protocol comprising histamine, IFN-alpha and low-dose IL-2. One complete and 3 partial responses were observed, while 3 patients had stable disease and 6 progressed. A trend towards a gradual increase in the absolute number of circulating CD56+/CD3- NK cells in patients maintaining stable disease during therapy was noted. In tumour tissues, the extent of leukocyte infiltration prior to treatment correlated with tumour response. Additional infiltration by NK cells (CD56+) and monocytes during treatment was seen only in responding patients. Patients with progressive disease exhibited a low density of leukocytes infiltrating tumour tissues at the onset of treatment as compared to the surrounding tissues.

In addition, in stage III melanoma patients, we identified a new subset of mature NK cells in macro-metastatic Lymph nodes (LN). In the present studies, we evaluated the numbers of NK cells infiltrating primary cutaneous melanoma and analyzed immune cell subsets in a series of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN). First, we show that NKp46+ NK cells infiltrate primary cutaneous melanoma. Their numbers were related to age of patients and not to Breslow thickness. Then, a series of patients with tumor-negative or -positive sentinel lymph nodes matched for Breslow thickness of the cutaneous melanoma was constituted. We investigated the distribution of macrophages (CD68), endothelial cells, NK cells, granzyme B positive (GrzB+) cells and CD8+ T cells in the SLN. Negative SLN (SLN-) were characterized by frequent adipose involution and follicular hyperplasia compared to positive SLN (SLN+). High densities of macrophages and endothelial cells (CD34), prominent in SLN+, infiltrate SLN and may reflect a tumor favorable microenvironment. Few but similar numbers of NK and GrzB+ cells were found in SLN- and SLN+: NK cells and GrzB+ cells were not correlated. Numerous CD8+ T cells infiltrated SLN with a trend for higher numbers in SLN-. Moreover, CD8+ T cells and GrzB+ cells correlated in SLN- not in SLN+. We also observed that the numbers of CD8+ T cells negatively correlated with endothelial cells in SLN-.

In this study, we systematically evaluated the composition and organization of immune cells that infiltrated melanoma metastases in human patients. Three histologic patterns of immune cell infiltration were identified, designated immunotypes A, B, and C. Immunotype A was characterized by no immune cell infiltrate. Immunotype B was characterized by infiltration of immune cells limited only to regions proximal to intratumoral blood vessels. Immunotype C was characterized by a diffuse immune cell infiltrate throughout a metastatic tumor. These immunotypes represented 29%, 63%, and 8% of metastases with estimated median survival periods of 15, 23, and 130 months, respectively. Notably, from immunotypes A to C, there were increasing proportions of B cells and decreasing proportions of macrophages. Overall, the predominant immune cells were T cells (53%), B cell lineage cells (33%), and macrophages (13%), with natural killer and mature dendritic cells only rarely present. Whereas higher densities of CD8(+) T cells correlated best with survival, a higher density of CD45(+) leukocytes, T cells, and B cells also correlated with increased survival. Together, our findings reveal striking differences in the immune infiltrate in melanoma metastases in patients, suggesting microenvironmental differences in immune homing receptors and ligands that affect immune cell recruitment. These findings are important, not only by revealing how the immune microenvironment can affect outcomes but also because they reveal characteristics that may help improve individualized therapy for patients with metastatic melanoma.",

As results, the tumor growth was more strongly inhibited by intratumor co-transfection with Mitf-siRNA and IL-12-encoding plasmid DNA than by transfection with either of the molecules alone. The co-transfection induced intratumor infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and hampered neoangiogenesis in the tumor.

Fibroblasts (Fbs) within the tumor stroma are critically involved in promoting tumor growth and angiogenesis through secretion of soluble factors, synthesis of extracellular matrix and direct cell-cell interaction. In this work, we aim to alter the biological activity of stromal Fbs by modulating the Notch1 signaling pathway. We show that Fbs engineered to constitutively activate the Notch1 pathway significantly inhibit melanoma growth and tumor angiogenesis. We determine that the inhibitory effect of 'Notch-engineered' Fbs is mediated by increased secretion of Wnt-induced secreted protein-1 (WISP-1) as the effects of Notch1 activation in Fbs are reversed by shRNA-mediated blockade of WISP-1. When 'Notch-engineered' Fbs are co-grafted with melanoma cells in SCID mice, shRNA-mediated blockade of WISP-1 reverses the tumor-suppressive phenotype of the 'Notch-engineered' Fbs, significantly increases melanoma growth and tumor angiogenesis. Consistent with these findings, supplement of recombinant WISP-1 protein inhibits melanoma cell growth in vitro. In addition, WISP-1 is modestly expressed in melanoma-activated Fbs but highly expressed in inactivated Fbs. Evaluation of human melanoma skin biopsies indicates that expression of WISP-1 is significantly lower in melanoma nests and surrounding areas filled with infiltrated immune cells than in the adjacent dermis unaffected by the melanoma. Overall, our study shows that constitutive activation of the Notch1 pathway confers Fbs with a suppressive phenotype to melanoma growth, partially through WISP-1. Thus, targeting tumor stromal Fbs by activating Notch signaling and/or increasing WISP-1 may represent a novel therapeutic approach to combat melanoma.",

Here, we used the ret transgenic spontaneous murine melanoma model that mimics human melanoma. Skin tumors and metastatic lymph nodes showed increased levels of inflammatory factors such as IL-1β, GM-CSF, and IFN-γ, which correlated with tumor progression. Moreover, Gr1(+)CD11b(+) myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), known to inhibit tumor reactive T cells, were enriched in melanoma lesions and lymphatic organs during tumor progression. MDSC infiltration was associated with a strong TCR ζ-chain down-regulation in all T cells. Coculturing normal splenocytes with tumor-derived MDSC induced a decreased T-cell proliferation and ζ-chain expression, verifying the MDSC immunosuppressive function and suggesting that the tumor inflammatory microenvironment supports MDSC recruitment and immunosuppressive activity. Indeed, upon manipulation of the melanoma microenvironment with the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor sildenafil, we observed reduced levels of numerous inflammatory mediators (e.g., IL-1β, IL-6, VEGF, S100A9) in association with decreased MDSC amounts and immunosuppressive function, indicating an antiinflammatory effect of sildenafil. This led to a partial restoration of ζ-chain expression in T cells and to a significantly increased survival of tumor-bearing mice. CD8 T-cell depletion resulted in an abrogation of sildenafil beneficial outcome, suggesting the involvement of MDSC and CD8 T cells in the observed therapeutic effects.

A key question is defining whether the intratumoral infiltration (ITI) is a differentiating factor between patients with and without tumor responses.;Paired baseline and postdosing tumor biopsy specimens were prospectively collected from 19 patients with metastatic melanoma, including 3 patients with an objective tumor response, receiving the anti-CTLA4 antibody tremelimumab within a clinical trial with primary endpoint of quantitating CD8(+) cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) infiltration in tumors. Samples were analyzed for cell density by automated imaging capture and further characterized for functional lymphocyte properties by assessing the cell activation markers HLA-DR and CD45RO, the cell proliferation marker Ki67, and the regulatory T-cell marker FOXP3.;There was a highly significant increase in ITI by CD8(+) cells in biopsy samples taken after tremelimumab treatment. This included increases between 1-fold and 100-fold changes in 14 of 18 evaluable cases regardless of clinical tumor response or progression. There was no difference between the absolute number, location, or cell density of infiltrating cells between clinical responders and patients with nonresponding lesions that showed acquired intratumoral infiltrates. There were similar levels of expression of T-cell activation markers (CD45RO, HLA-DR) in both groups and no difference in markers for cell replication (Ki67) or the suppressor cell marker FOXP3.;CTLA4 blockade induces frequent increases in ITI by T cells despite which only a minority of patients have objective tumor responses.",

Grossly, the tumors tended to be polypoid with a smooth predominantly intact overlying mucosa. Microscopically a junctional lentiginous growth pattern was characteristic as well as a tendency to expand and fill the submucosa without invading the muscularis. A given tumor invariably was more extensive than grossly suspected and the lateral junctional spread was striking in two of the cases. Primary malignant melanoma should be included in the preoperative differential diagnosis of radiographically unusual esophageal tumors, particularly if the lesion is polypoid. Because of the potentially widespread intramucosal component, surgical treatment of esophageal melanoma required a radical procedure with a far greater margin than for the usual squamous cell carcinoma.

Multiple mechanisms of melanoma-induced immune escape, which are likely to cause the failure of the spontaneous or vaccine-induced immune responses to promote tumor regression in humans, have been elucidated. In addition, a number of negative factors in the tumor microenvironment dampen antitumor immune responses, including cytokines (like transforming growth factor-β or interleukin-10), suppressive cells (regulatory T cells and myelosuppressive dendritic cells), defective antigen presentation by tumor cells (human leukocyte antigen or T antigen expression loss, antigen processing machinery defects), amino acid catabolizing enzymes (indoleamine-2-3 dioxygenase, arginase), and immune inhibitory pathways (like cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4/cluster of differentiation 28, programmed death 1/programmed death 1 ligand 1).

BL6 clones expressing transfected H-2Kb class I molecules were, by contrast, highly immunogenic in immunocompetent mice. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) generated from the H-2Kb+ BL6 lesions (Thy 1.2+, CD8+, CD4-) efficiently lysed H-2Kb+ melanoma (CL8-1 and 2Kb38) and the H-2Kb+ nonrelated 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA)-105 sarcoma, but not the H-2Kb- parental melanoma BL6-8. This strongly suggests that CL8-1, 2Kb38, and MCA-105 express identical or cross-reactive T cell epitopes recognized by CL8-1 TILs in the context of the H-2Kb class I allele. To identify the T cell epitopes, peptides were acid-eluted from various cells, and fractionated by HPLC. Five HPLC fractions (F1mel-F5mel) of 70 tested contained peptides derived from H-2Kb+ CL8-1 melanoma (but not H-2Kb- melanomas) that were capable of conferring susceptibility to CL8-1 TIL lysis on H-2b-expressing target cells (EL4, C1R.Kb), but not on H-2d-expressing P815 target cells. CL8-1 TILs failed to recognize peptides derived from H-2Kb+ nonmelanoma targets such as EL4 or normal B6 splenocytes. Interestingly, CL8-1 TILs appeared to recognize peptide species contained in two HPLC fractions derived from the MCA-105 sarcoma (F1sar and F5sar). Conversely, TILs derived from MCA-105 lesions recognized MCA-105 and CL8-1 tumor cells, as well as F5mel and F5sar peptides presented by EL4 targets.

Orbital exenteration including superior and inferior palpebrae was performed, and the removed tissue was examined by light and electron microscopy. In the temporal bulbar conjunctiva, melanocytes containing abundant fine melanin granules proliferated over almost the whole area of the epithelial layer. Cellular atypia and karyomitosis were not observed. The basement membrane remained intact with no proliferation of melanocytes in the substantia propria. However, in the perivascular area, in addition to the moderately prominent infiltration by lymphocytes and plasma cells, infiltration by melanophages was observed relatively frequently. Based on these findings, it was confirmed that the primary lesion of the bulbar conjunctiva was an acquired melanosis of Stage IB as classified by Zimmerman. The black nodular tumors of the superior palpebral conjunctiva and inferior palpebral skin consisted of melanoma cells showing markedly prominent cellular and nuclear atypia. The nuclei showed indentations in the membrane with electron-lucent karyoplasm, each having one nucleolus. The cytoplasm contained many round or elongated melanosomes in various developmental stages, with sizes of about 0.7 micron. Scattered among melanoma cells were a number of melanophages which had phagocytized many melanosomes at various stages of maturity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Moreover, CD8⁺ TILs from patients exhibited downregulation of the costimulatory molecule CD226, which competes with TIGIT for the same ligand, supporting a TIGIT/CD226 imbalance in metastatic melanoma. TIGIT marked early T cell activation and was further upregulated by T cells upon PD-1 blockade and in dysfunctional PD-1⁺TIM-3⁺ TA-specific CD8⁺ T cells. PD-1⁺TIGIT⁺, PD-1⁻TIGIT⁺, and PD-1⁺TIGIT⁻ CD8⁺ TILs had similar functional capacities ex vivo, suggesting that TIGIT alone, or together with PD-1, is not indicative of T cell dysfunction. However, in the presence of TIGIT ligand-expressing cells, TIGIT and PD-1 blockade additively increased proliferation, cytokine production, and degranulation of both TA-specific CD8⁺ T cells and CD8⁺ TILs. Collectively, our results show that TIGIT and PD-1 regulate the expansion and function of TA-specific CD8⁺ T cells and CD8⁺ TILs in melanoma patients and suggest that dual TIGIT and PD-1 blockade should be further explored to elicit potent antitumor CD8⁺ T cell responses in patients with advanced melanoma.",

As the search for new biomarkers increases, we expect that biomarker analyses will be essential for all clinical trials to better select patient populations for optimal therapy. While individualized therapy that is based on extensive biomarker analyses is an option, we expect in the future genetic and biologic biomarkers will allow grouping of melanomas in such a way that we can predict therapy outcome.

Replacement of either cysteine residue with alpha-amino butyric acid in the gp100 peptide, RLPRIFCSC, enhanced CTL recognition, suggesting that the peptide epitope naturally presented on the tumor cell surface may contain reduced cysteine residues. Oxidation of these cysteines might have occurred during the course of the synthesis or pulsing of the peptide in culture. These modifications may have important implications for the development of efficient peptide-based vaccines.

The small cell melanomas were notable for localization to the scalp, significant thickness, and fatal outcome. The adultlike melanomas resembled typical tumors occurring in adults. The one fatal Spitz-like melanoma was located on the neck of a 14-year-old boy. Two tumors in this group metastasized to regional lymph nodes but have not been associated with further aggressive disease on follow-up despite having been treated with surgical excision only.

Expanded cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) retained in vivo and in vitro functionality, suggesting that melanoma growth did not induce T-cell anergy. The magnitude of suppressed proliferative expansion was proportional to the extent of tumor burden. Melanoma-induced suppression of CTL expansion was correlated with upregulated apoptotic activity and hampered the induction of memory precursor effector cells. Adoptive transfer of resting LCMV antigen-specific T-cells before or after tumor establishment demonstrated that a critical period of in vivo exposure of resting T-cells to growing melanoma was responsible for the induction of suppressed expansion. This suppression was durable; surgical resection of melanoma after in vivo exposure to resting T-cells but before antigenic stimulation did not restore full expansion.;These data suggest that growing melanoma tumors exert a global, antigen-independent influence on resting T-cells that fundamentally reprograms their ability to undergo proliferative expansion in response to subsequent antigenic stimulation.

Purified gangliosides in aqueous solution form micelles and, at high density, form lactones.

We have observed an inverse relationship between IL-6 production of three B16-derived murine melanoma cell lines (NP133, HFH18, and HFH(M)) and the tumorigenicity of these melanoma cells in syngeneic mice. To further test the effect of IL-6 on melanoma growth, a non-IL-6-producing murine B16-derived melanoma cell line (HFH18) was transfected with a murine IL-6 expression vector, resulting in stable transfectants (HFH18/IL-6(+)) that expressed significant amounts of IL-6 mRNA and secreted high levels of bioactive IL-6. Syngeneic C57BL/6 mice inoculated subcutaneously with HFH18/IL-6(+) cells developed tumors that reached a final mean diameter of less than half the size of tumors that developed in mice inoculated with either HFH18 parental or HFH18 cells transfected with the IL-6 cDNA in the non-coding 3'-5' orientation (HFH18/IL-6(-) cells). In addition, mice bearing IL-6-producing HFH18/IL-6(+) tumors survived twice as long as mice bearing HFH18 parental or HFH18/IL-6(-) tumors. The specificity of melanoma growth inhibition by IL-6 was confirmed by the reversal of the slow-growing phenotype of HFH18/IL-6(+) cells by local peritumoral administration of neutralizing alpha-murine IL-6 antibody. IL-6-producing melanoma cells exerted a growth-inhibitory effect on distant parental tumors in a dose-dependent manner. The growth of HFH18/IL-6(+) melanomas was also decreased in nude mice, suggesting that melanoma-derived IL-6 may mediate this anti-tumor effect independently of a normal host B- and T-cell immune response. Thus, melanoma-derived IL-6 exerts a significant inhibitory effect on cutaneous melanoma growth and progression.

Moreover, EGF-induced sprouting of lymphatic but not of blood endothelial cells was abolished using supernatants of M24met EGFkd cells. In addition, M24met EGFkd tumors showed reduced vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) expression levels. Similarly, in human primary melanomas, a direct correlation between EGF/VEGF-C and EGF/Prox-1 expression levels was found.

This effect was also seen when allogeneic CD8+ and CD4+ subpopulations were used as effectors. In these studies, activation of lymphocytes was B7-1-dependent and HLA classes I and II mediated.

In particular, recent studies point toward a disease-progressing role of proangiogenic M2 macrophages in melanomas with monosomy 3. Although most studies implicate a protective effect of PPAR-gamma activation in tumors, PPAR-gamma has also been shown to promote the polarization of M1 macrophages toward the M2 phenotype. The purpose of this investigation was first, to characterize the phenotype of tumor infiltrating macrophages and second, to study PPAR-gamma expression in uveal melanomas with molecular gene expression profile as prognostic predictors for patients' outcome. Twenty specimens from patients with uveal melanoma were analyzed for clinical and histologic tumor characteristics. The molecular RNA profile (class 1 or class 2) was commercially determined. Using immunohistochemical techniques, the specimens were dual labeled for CD68 and CD163. CD68 + CD163- M1 macrophages and CD68 + CD163+ M2 macrophages were analyzed in ten high power fields sparing macrophage-poor areas and a mean value was calculated for each tumor. The tumors were immunostained for von Willebrand factor and the micro vascular density (MVD) was analyzed according to Foss. To assess the proliferative rate of each tumor, Ki67 expression was evaluated in ten high power fields followed by calculation of a mean value. Expression of PPAR-gamma was evaluated using a score from 0 (no staining) to 3 (tumor entirely stained). Statistical analysis and a respective correlation were made between histologic characteristics, molecular profile, type of tumor infiltrating macrophages (M1 vs. M2), MVD, proliferative rate, and PPAR-gamma expression. Our results showed a correlation between the ratio of M2/M1 macrophages and the molecular profile with a ratio of approximately 1 corresponding to molecular class 1 and a ratio of approximately 2 corresponding to molecular class 2 (p = 0.01). The ratio of M2/M1 macrophages was higher in tumors with extraocular extension (p = 0.01). PPAR-gamma was predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm of tumor cells. Its expression showed no association with the molecular RNA profile (p = 0.83). This study confirmed that the ratio of M2/M1 macrophages is another prognostic factor in uveal melanoma. Thus, polarization of macrophages plays an important role for patients' outcome. PPAR-gamma is expressed in uveal melanoma tumor cells and further studies are warranted to determine its role in tumor biology.",

In the present study we investigated whether CTL epitopes are present in anti-id mAb MF-11-30 and activate T cells to recognize HMW-MAA on melanoma cells. One candidate epitope in the mAb MF11-30 VH chain, VH (3-11), was selected based on the presence of HLA-A2 anchor residues and partial homology with the HMW-MAA epitope, HMW-MAA (76-84). Lymphocytes from HLA-A2(+)-immunized patients proliferated to VH (3-11) peptide and to a variant HMW-MAA peptide to a significantly greater extent than autologous lymphocytes stimulated with an irrelevant peptide and lymphocytes from nonimmunized patients.

This study, based on 60 necropsies, documents the similarity of the pathology of the cutaneous malignant melanomas and the organ distribution of metastasis to human melanoma. The invasive cutaneous melanomas have an intraepidermal component analogous to human superficial spreading melanoma. The pathology of the spontaneous regression, characterized by a series of cellular events beginning with a mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate and leading to depigmentation and fibrosis, is likewise similar to cutaneous regression in human melanoma. Just as with human melanoma,metastasis was correlated with deeply invasive cutaneous tumors. Because of both the biologic and histologic similarity of this animal model to human melanoma, the Sinclair miniature swine should serve as an important resource in continuing the study of melanoma.",

After fourteen and fifteen selections in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice sublines B16-B14b and B16-B15b, respectively, were established in culture. These were then assayed in vivo by injection of single tumor cell suspensions into the tail vein (i.v.), left ventricle of the heart (i.c.) or left common carotid artery (i.a.), and the resulting tumors were examined histologically. Injection of subline B16-B14b or B16-B15b resulted in brain meningeal tumor formation in the dura mater and leptomeninges with invasion into underlying brain parenchyma and also some brain ventricular tumors at the sites of i.a. injection. Lung colonization ability remained in the brain-selected sublines, although it was remarkably reduced in i.a. tumor cell-injected animals. The brain meningeal tumors that formed were of three types: intravascular, nodular or infiltrative. Injection of tumor cells i.v. resulted mainly in the establishment of the intravascular type of brain meningeal tumors with eventual perivascular invasion, while injection i.a. or i.c. resulted mostly in nodular or infiltrative type brain meningeal tumors. The B16-B14b brain meningeal tumors formed were small (less than 1 mm in diameter) and usually nonpigmented, while B16-B15b tumors were generally large (up to 7 mm in diameter) and pigmented. Host reactions towards B16-B14b and B16-B15b tumors at meningeal sites differed. The former B16 subline was characterized by extensive fibrosis with some immunocytic cell infiltration in and around the meningeal tumors, while the latter subline did not elicit such host reactions. In contrast, tumors in brain parenchyma failed to evoke observable host reactions, and there was little evidence of immunocyte cell infiltration or glial cell alterations.",

Peripheral blood lymphocytes of a melanoma patient (AV) were activated in an autologous-mixed-lymphocyte tumor culture (AMLTC) and responding cells were cloned using irradiated autologous melanoma cells (AV-Mel) as antigen source, EBV-transformed B-lymphoblasts as feeder cells and recombinant Interleukin 2. T-cell clones were isolated which proliferated in response to autologous tumor cells, but not to autologous B-lymphoblasts (AV-B), and which were cytolytic for AV-Mel cells. In an attempt to identify the antigens recognized, an in vitro test system was used, in which 3H-Thymidine (3H-TdR) incorporation by T lymphocytes was measured in the presence of protein from AV-Mel cells presented by irradiated autologous accessory cells. Antigen-bearing particles of AV-Mel or AV-B cells were prepared by spotting cell lysates onto nitrocellulose (NC) followed by dissolution with DMSO and precipitation with an aqueous buffer. T cells sensitized against autologous melanoma cells were specifically stimulated by NC-bound AV-Mel protein. Stimulation required the presence of AV-B accessory cells, indicating that B-lymphoblasts are able to present tumor antigens. This approach facilitates screening of polypeptide fractions of AV-Mel cells separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting for their capacity to stimulate antigen-dependent T-cells. CD4+ and CD8+ tumor-specific clones appear to recognize different antigens on the tumor cell: proliferation of an antigen-dependent CD8+ clone was stimulated by 240- and 24-kDa protein fractions, while proliferation of 2 antigen-dependent CD4+ clones was observed either with an 84- or with 140- and 55-kDa fractions. Molecular definition of the different antigens of tumor cells recognized by autologous T cells may be a prerequisite in attempts to manipulate T-cell-mediated anti-tumor responses in a controlled way.",

Patients with nodular melanoma and complete follow-up information were included. Lymphatic vessels were immunostained with the LYVE-1 and Podoplanin antibodies, and LVD was evaluated in both intra- and peri-tumoral (LVDpt) areas. Median LVD was 6.3 and 12.5 vessels/mm(2) in intra- and peri-tumoral areas, and coexpression of LYVE-1 and Ki-67/MIB-1 in lymphatic endothelial cells within the tumor was demonstrated, indicating active but low-grade lymphangiogenesis. Increased LVDpt was significantly associated with localization on the extremities (P = 0.005), decreased tumor thickness (P = 0.036), absence of vascular invasion (P = 0.004), brisk lymphocytic infiltration (P = 0.018), low proliferative rate by Ki-67 (P = 0.011), increased bFGF expression in tumor cells (P = 0.01) as well as in endothelial cells (P = 0.008), and decreased tumor cell expression of Ephrin-A1 (P = 0.009).

Many therapies for metastatic melanoma are limited by low response rates, severe toxicities, and/or relatively short response duration. Cancer immunotherapies that act as immune-checkpoint inhibitors to block the localized immune suppression mechanisms utilized by tumors are undergoing development and clinical trials. A clinically relevant immune escape mechanism in melanoma is the activation of the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor on infiltrating T cells. Activating PD-1 triggers an immune checkpoint resulting in inhibition of T cells directed against melanoma antigens and prevents the immune system from combating the melanoma. In Phase I clinical trials, two anti-PD1 therapies, Nivolumab and MK-3475, that block the PD-1 receptor to enable T cell killing have demonstrated objective tumor responses in patients with advanced melanoma. The purpose of this review is to present the available clinical evidence on anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy for the treatment of advanced melanoma. We also discuss limitations associated with anti-PD-1 therapy. The blockade of the PD-1-PD-L1 pathway has shown promising results in clinical trials and has revolutionized melanoma immunotherapy. ",

The possible mechanisms for this change are considered.

Differential expression of 594 immunoregulatory genes was assessed in a subset of primary melanomas in the IMCG and TCGA cohorts using an integrative pathway analysis.;We analyzed 304, 476 (SEER), 1241 (IMCG), and 292 (TCGA) patients. Increasing age at melanoma diagnosis in both the SEER and IMCG cohorts demonstrated a positive correlation with tumor thickness, ulceration, stage, and mortality, however age in the TCGA cohort did not correlate with mortality. Older age was associated with shorter MSS in all three cohorts. When the young age group in both the IMCG and TCGA cohorts was stratified by TIL status, there were no differences in MSS. However, older IMCG patients with brisk TILs and intermediate aged TCGA patients with high lymphocyte scores (3-6) had improved MSS. Gene expression analysis revealed top pathways (T cell trafficking, communication, and differentiation) and top upstream regulators (CD3, CD28, IFNG, and STAT3) that significantly changed with age in 84 IMCG and 43 TCGA primary melanomas.;Older age at time of melanoma diagnosis is associated with shorter MSS, however age's association with clinicopathologic features is dependent upon specific characteristics of the study population. TIL as a read-out of the host immune response may have greater prognostic impact in patients older than age 45. Recognition of age-related factors negatively impacting host immune responses may provide new insights into therapeutic strategies for the elderly.",

Multiple indirect arguments have supported the view that the immune system may control, at least in certain cases, malignant cell growth while direct demonstration is still lacking in the human. In an attempt to address this issue, we have selected a study model, namely spontaneously regressive melanoma. A primary cutaneous lesion was investigated. T cell repertoire analysis showed the in situ amplification of at least two tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TILs) expressing the V beta 13 and V beta 16 variable TCR gene segments respectively. The two clones were precisely characterized by sequence of the TCR beta chain junctional region. Further functional study demonstrated that both lymphocytes displayed a selective cytotoxic activity against autologous tumor cells. The V beta 16+ cells, predominant in vivo, were shown to be closely opposed to the melanoma cells. Together, these studies demonstrated the existence of a local adaptative immune response associated to tumor regression, thus strongly supporting the validity of the immunosurveillance concept. A gastric metastasis which occurred three years after the primary lesion has been studied here. Overexpression of the V beta 13 and V beta 16 TCR segments was no longer detected by direct PCR analysis in situ. Sequencing transcripts from V beta 13+ and V beta 16+ TILs confirmed that the two CTLs, identified in the primary lesions, were not represented with high frequency. The V beta 13+ cell was however shown to be present while the V beta 16+ CTL was not detected. Yet, characterization of a tumor cell line derived from the gastric site indicated that the peptidic antigen(s) which induced the initially successfully immune response was still expressed. The present data illustrate that it has become possible to perform very precise analysis of local immune responses during cancer development. Such an improvement together with the recently initiated molecular characterization of tumor associated peptidic antigens, should provide the basis for improved strategies of cancer immunotherapy.",

To work under such conditions, a poorly tumorigenic human melanoma cell line was transfected with an expression vector encoding MCP-1. We found that M2 macrophages are associated to MCP-1+ tumors, triggering a profuse vascular network. To target the protumoral macrophages recruitment and reverting tumor growth promotion, clodronate-laden liposomes (Clod-Lip) or bindarit were administered to melanoma-bearing mice. Macrophage depletion after Clod-Lip treatment induced development of smaller tumors than in untreated mice. Immunohistochemical analysis with an anti-CD31 antibody revealed scarce vascular structures mainly characterized by narrow vascular lights. Pharmacological inhibition of MCP-1 with bindarit also reduced tumor growth and macrophage recruitment, rendering necrotic tumor masses.

        "Doc_abstract":"The coexistence of tumor progression with a tumor-specific immune response constitutes a major paradox of tumor immunity. During the last decade, the presence of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) recognising melanoma-associated antigens has been unequivocally demonstrated in numerous different in vivo and in vitro models. However, most often these melanoma-specific T lymphocytes do not control tumor growth. Several mechanisms that involve changes in melanoma phenotype and/or in T-cell differentiation and function could explain the inability of the immune response to control melanoma. In the last few years it has been demonstrated that cellular cytotoxicity is the result of a balance between activating signals triggered by the TCR and costimulatory molecules and inhibitory signals triggered by inhibitory receptors expressed by the CTL. Because the final outcome of the immune response against melanoma depends on the balance between activating and inhibitory signals, the expression de novo on melanoma cells of ligands for inhibitory NKRs and the down-regulation of costimulatory molecules may favor the escape of tumor cells from immunosurveillance. In this paper we review how altered expression of molecules required for T-cell costimulation could result in impaired lysis of melanoma. The modulation of antimelanoma T-cell responses by a group of receptors originally described on NK cells (NK-associated receptors) but which are now known also to be expressed on a subset of cytolytic effector cells is reviewed. We hypothesize that the expression of ligands for NKRs on melanoma cells may contribute to T-cell-mediated immune responses against melanoma either enhancing or inhibiting activation and differentiation to effector cells. Blocking inhibitory receptors or increasing activating receptors could result in new strategies to improve T-cell-mediated rejection of melanoma.",

The blocking of CTLA-4 using human monoclonal antibodies, such as Ipilimumab, is currently used to relieve CTLA-4-mediated inhibition of anti-tumor immune response in metastatic melanoma. Herein, we have analyzed CTLA-4 expression and Ipilimumab reactivity on melanoma cell lines and tumor tissues from cutaneous melanoma patients. Then, we investigated whether Ipilimumab can trigger innate immunity in terms of antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α release. Finally, a xenograft murine model was set up to determine in vivo the effects of Ipilimumab and NK cells on melanoma.;CTLA-4 expression and Ipilimumab reactivity were analyzed on 17 melanoma cell lines (14 primary and 3 long-term cell lines) by cytofluorimetry and on 33 melanoma tissues by immunohistochemistry. CTLA-4 transcripts were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. Soluble CTLA-4 and TNF-α were tested by ELISA. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), NK and γδT cells were tested in ADCC assay with Ipilimumab and melanoma cell lines. TNF-α release was analyzed in NK-melanoma cell co-cultures in the presence of ipilimumab. In vivo experiments of xenotransplantation were carried out in NOD/SCID mice. Results were analyzed using unpaired Student's t-test.;All melanoma cell lines expressed mRNA and cytoplasmic CTLA-4 but surface reactivity with Ipilimumab was quite heterogeneous. Accordingly, about 2/3 of melanoma specimens expressed CTLA-4 at different level of intensity.Ipilimumab triggered, via FcγReceptorIIIA (CD16), ex vivo NK cells as well as PBMC, IL-2 activated NK and γδT cells to ADCC of CTLA-4+ melanoma cells. No ADCC was detected upon interaction with CTLA-4- FO-1 melanoma cell line. TNF-α was released upon interaction of NK cells with CTLA-4+ melanoma cell lines. Remarkably, Ipilimumab neither affected proliferation and viability nor triggered ADCC of CTLA-4+ T lymphocytes.

There was almost perfect concordance (kappa = 0.81-1.00) for tumour thickness, ulceration, microsatellites and growth phase; substantial concordance (κ = 0.61-0.80) for Clark level, mitotic rate, completeness of excision and neurotropism; moderate concordance (κ = 0.41-0.60) for vascular invasion, regression, predominant cell type and histological type; and only slight concordance (κ = 0-0.2) for tumour infiltrating lymphocytes. There was a high level of agreement for diagnosis of lesions as melanoma versus benign (97.3%). Overall concordance for pathological tumour staging was substantial (81.9%, κ = 0.79). Lowest concordance was found for stage 1b (91.3%, κ = 0.62).;Overall concordance in clinicopathological stage was high due to consistency of reporting of tumour thickness and ulceration.

In this study, the mechanism involved in, and the specificities of, cytotoxic immune response in this autologous system were examined at population and clonal levels. Resident lymph node lymphocytes were isolated from both involved and uninvolved lymph nodes from the same patient. Resident lymphocytes from both sources regulated the generation of cytotoxic immune response when both types of resident lymph node lymphocytes were further sensitized against the PJ-M cells in IVC and were expanded in interleukin 2 (IL 2). An IL 2-dependent homogeneous lymphocyte line (I-10:1) bearing the phenotype of a helper T cell (T4+) and a T4+ clone (I-10.3) of the I-10:1 line, established by limiting dilution culture, also down-regulated the generation of cytotoxic immune effector cells in the PBL in IVC against the PJ-M targets. The IL 2-dependent T4+ inducer line I-10:1 generated a functionally differentiated T8+ suppressor population(s) that, in turn, could abrogate cytotoxic response in fresh PBL in IVC against PJ-M cells. The inducer line I-10:1 and its subclone I-10.3 suppressed the generation of cytotoxic effector cells in the PBL in IVC selectively against the autologous PJ-M cells. Generation of cytotoxic allo-response in IVC was unaffected by the inducer lines. These results provide further evidence for the involvement of the regulatory network in cytotoxic immune response in an autologous human tumor system, and suggest a potential explanation for cytotoxic unresponsiveness against autologous melanoma cells.",

In this study, we describe a patient with metastatic melanoma who developed inflammatory lesions circumscribing pigmented areas of skin after an infusion of MART-1-specific CD8(+) T cell clones. Analysis of the infiltrating lymphocytes in skin and tumor biopsies using T cell-specific peptide-major histocompatibility complex tetramers demonstrated a localized predominance of MART-1-specific CD8(+) T cells (>28% of all CD8 T cells) that was identical to the infused clones (as confirmed by sequencing of the complementarity-determining region 3). In contrast to skin biopsies obtained from the patient before T cell infusion, postinfusion biopsies demonstrated loss of MART-1 expression, evidence of melanocyte damage, and the complete absence of melanocytes in affected regions of the skin.

Based on 1442 patients with vulvar melanomas the tumors' epidemiology, clinical manifestations, histopathology, molecular genetics, treatment strategies, and prognosis were surveyed. Despite their sun-shielded location and rare incidence, vulvar melanomas were, on average, more dense than melanomas on the body surface and nearly the density of melanomas in chronically sun-exposed skin of the head and neck. Vulvar melanomas differed markedly from cutaneous melanomas, as evidenced by histopathological lesions and molecular genetics. Most melanomas were located on the glabrous skin as opposed to the hairy skin within the vulva and differed significantly in biological properties. The prognosis for the patients was poor, and in the 11 largest studies of surgical strategies, none offered a significant survival advantage. Tumor thickness and ulceration were usually significant predictors of (poor) prognosis in multivariate analyses along with macroscopic amelanosis, angioinvasion or DNA non-diploidy in some reports. Clear-cut biological differences between vulvar and cutaneous melanomas and between melanomas within different vulvar sites provide new paths for extensive research on melanomagenesis and for potential therapies.

T-cell recognition of naturally processed MHC class I-presented peptides, or alternatively synthetic peptides derived from MAGE-1 or MAGE-3, leads to cytokine release as well as to a cytotoxic T-cell response in these antimelanoma-directed polyclonal or clonal effector T-cell populations. Recent reports suggest that the activity of T lymphocytes infiltrating melanoma in vivo appears to be impaired. We report here the characterization of the in vitro (in the presence of 6000 IU interleukin 2) expanded tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) T-cell line PM2-B2 derived from a patient with rapidly progressing and therapy-resistant head and neck melanoma. The TIL cell line PM2-B2 did not lyse, but instead released granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in response to the autologous tumor or HLA-A1-matched allogeneic tumor cell lines. The TIL line PM2-B2 did not kill the MHC class I natural killer/lymphokine-activated killer target cell lines Daudi or K562. The fine specificity of the TIL line PM2-B2 restricted by HLA-A1 was further characterized by evaluating specific granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor release in response to MHC class I-eluted peptides derived from HLA-A1(+) melanoma cell lines. TIL PM2-B2 failed to recognize the recently described HLA-A1-presented peptides derived from the gene products encoded by MAGE-1 or MAGE-3. PCR-based analysis of the freshly harvested tumor from patient PM2-B2 revealed the presence of message for the melanoma-associated gene products MAGE-1 and MAGE-3, but not for tyrosinase or MART-1/MELAN-A. Acid elution and high performance liquid chromatography fractionation of MHC class I-presented peptides from HLA-A1-matched melanoma cell lines 397 or 888 revealed that TIL PM2-B2 recognized at least three distinct peptide epitopes eluting in high performance liquid chromatographic bioactive fractions 5/6, 36, and 51/52. These bioactive peaks appeared to be shared among HLA-A1(+) melanoma cell lines. We suggest, based on this report, that HLA-A1-presented melanoma-derived peptides (other than those previously reported peptides derived from MAGE-1 or MAGE-3) may represent targets for TIL recognition as defined by cytokine release, but not cytotoxicity. Such an immune response differentially defined by cytokine release, but absent cytotoxic functions, may either reflect the impaired cytolytic function of the TIL population or reflect the inherent nature of HLA-A1-presented melanoma T-cell epitopes leading to cytokine release, but not to a cytotoxic T-cell response. Additionally, this report suggests that the individual T-cell immune response to melanoma may be rather complex, involving diverse T-cell effector functions (e.g., cytotoxicity or cytokine release), each of which should be evaluated in studies of antitumor-specific T-cell reactivity.",

Using these culture conditions, we report here the generation of 66 CD4+ and 36 CD8+ TIL clones from five patients with melanoma. Eighty-five percent of the CD4+ TIL clones were not cytolytic (< 30% lysis, E:T 20:1) as determined by antibody-redirected lysis (ARL), whereas all CD8+ clones showed strong ARL activity (> 30% lysis). Clones were further tested for production of IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma after activation for 48 hr by solid-phase anti-CD3. CD8+ clones produced significant amounts of IFN-gamma, little IL-2, and no IL-4. CD4+ clones were classified as Th0, Th1, or Th2, analogous to the classification of T helper cells in the mouse. Sixty-six percent existed as Th0, producing IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma. Only 15% existed as Th1, producing IL-2 and IFN-gamma, and 19% as Th2, producing IL-4 but no IL-2 or IFN-gamma. In all cases, unstimulated clones or clones stimulated with the allogeneic B cell line did not produce detectable amounts of cytokines. Solid-phase anti-CD3 activation was compared to activation with autologous melanoma cells. Five of nine CD8+ clones produced low amounts of IL-2 (< 200 pg/ml/10(6) cells) in response to autologous tumor, but none of the CD8 clones produced IFN-gamma or IL-4. Also, 5/7 Th0 clones from one patient produced similar amounts of IL-2 after stimulation with anti-CD3 or autologous tumor. The other two clones produced only 10% or less of the amount produced in response to anti-CD3. No IL-4 or IFN-gamma could be detected in response to autologous tumor. In contrast, none of the 12 T helper clones from two other patients produced any cytokines after stimulation with autologous tumor cells.

Further expansion of cultured human melanoma tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes with suppression of lymphokine-activated killer activity as well as the modulation of monocyte activity by interleukin 4 suggests that this cytokine may be clinically useful alone or in combination with interleukin 2. Other means of enhancing the activity of interleukin 2-based immunotherapy are suggested by the finding that tumor cell susceptibility to lysis by natural killer cells is depressed following treatment with interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor, but susceptibility to lysis by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes is markedly enhanced.

The extent and nature of surgical procedures depends on the nature of the tumor process, in advanced stages is indicated mutilating surgery--exenteration of the orbit. Exenteration of the orbit due to the extrascleral extension of malignant melanoma of the uvea is very rare, unfortunately, even today in certain cases it is necessary to make such a mutilating surgery.;Case report--65 year old female patient, sent to our Departement in 2008 with the finding of the pigment deposits on the posterior pole of the left eye. Ultrasound study found elevations of up to 3 mm, she was asked to come for further control in three months interval. She did not coma, furthermore she sporadically attended another eye clinic. In 2011 she was treated for secondary glaucoma--cyclocryopexia. Due to pain another surgery--tarzoraphia was indicated. In 2012 she underwent surgery at St. Elisabeth Cancer Institute in Bratislava--Nefrectomia transperitoneally l. dx., excision hepatis. Histological examination in addition to the primary papillary renal carcinoma--mucinous tubular T1 Nx Mx type, found the metastasis of malignant melanoma to the liver and right kidney. She underwent the diagnostic procedure to find the origo of the melanoma. The patient was subsequently admitted to our clinic with blind painfull eye for enucleation. During the surgery the was found retrobulbar tumor ingrowth. Histopatholigical findings confirmed malignant melanoma. Indicated was exenteration of the orbit due to malignant melanoma T4 N0 M2 stage in June 2012. After healing of the cavity she was recommended to design an individual prosthesis. After completing several courses of palliative chemotherapy during a recent review in January 2015 the patient is without recurrence of the melanoma in the orbit;Histological examination confirmed malignant melanoma in stage G2, predominantly epithelioid type, spindle cell type in part B of pips, tumor fills the entire back and part of the anterior chamber, grows through the sclera and optic nerve is completely overgrown by tumor mass and spreads into orbit. The immunophenotype is suggesting a better prognosis (S100+, melanoma+, +HMB45, cyklin D1 3%, 10% of p53, Ki67 3%). Tissue eyelashes were infiltrated by numerous micrometastases. The patient after exenteration of the orbit after 3 months got an individual epithesis. Local orbit cavity is more than 24 months after exenteration without recurrence of melanoma. The patient is still undergoing outpatient chemotherapy and feels good.;The treatment of malignant tumors of the orbit and the eye is difficult, in most cases surgical treatment is indicated, with the additional radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Malignant tumors at an advanced stage should to be solved radically. Exenteration of the orbit leads to produce a large defect in the orbit and this part of the face. Patients in the active age after surgery followed by facial defects after such procedures have disadvantage in work and thie defect leads to serious socio-economic challenges. Patients with individually made prosthesis comprising a refund of the eyeball and the surrounding soft tissues allow active life and full application of the private as well as professional life.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Melanoma is the prototype of a tumor to which many forms of immunotherapy have been applied extensively over the past two decades. Melanoma vaccines (active specific immunotherapy) are designed to modulate the immune system and have subsequent anti-tumor effects with minimal toxicity. Previous attempts to produce melanoma vaccines include immunization with whole tumor cells/cell lysates admixed with nonspecific adjuvants. While these vaccines generate enhanced anti-tumor immunity in a subset of patients, some of whom survive for longer than historical controls, no clinical benefit has so far been demonstrated in a properly controlled phase III study. Genetic modifications of tumor cells to make them express cytokines afford new-generation melanoma vaccines, and generate long-lasting systemic antitumor immunity in animal models. Translation of these preclinical results primarily into melanoma patients with advanced diseases shows the potential to induce systemic antitumor immune responses and in some instances tumor regression with acceptably low toxicity. The efficacy of this novel vaccine approach would be expected to be higher when used in a postsurgical adjuvant setting when the tumor load is small. Other novel vaccine approaches such as dendritic cell-based therapy also hold promise for the treatment of melanoma. The clinical value of all these new approaches will eventually have to be established in prospectively randomized clinical studies.",

The identification of tumor antigens recognized by and able to activate human T-lymphocytes has heightened the enthusiasm for this approach. Melanoma is one of the diseases that has been primarily targeted by vaccine approaches. The identification of peptides and proteins associated with cancer has provided strategies to target specific components of the cancer cell. However, older vaccines utilizing products from whole cells may have a number of advantages. Melacine (Corixa Corp.) is an allogeneic melanoma tumor cell lysate combined with the adjuvant DETOX. Pioneered by Malcolm Mitchell, it has rare but confirmed antitumor activity in metastatic melanoma (5-10%). However, previous analysis of responses in advanced disease and a recent analysis in early-stage adjuvant trials suggest that Melacine may have its greatest benefit in a large subset of melanoma patients who express either the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I antigens A2 and/or HLA-C3.

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues of 100 melanomas, 27 common nevi, and 23 dysplastic nevi were immunostained with antibodies against the 4 erbB receptors. erbB3 and erbB4 showed stronger positivity in nevi than in melanomas, and in common than in dysplastic nevi.

In melanomas, greater thickness was associated with more widespread erbB2 and erbB3 staining in the vertical than in the radial growth phase, and in the dermal than in the epidermal component. Higher mitotic counts were associated with more widespread and intense erbB2 expression in the vertical growth phase than in the radial growth phase and in the dermal than in the epidermal component. Melanomas with more widespread erbB2 staining had heavier lymphocytic infiltrates. erbB1 expression was negligible in all groups. erbB2, erbB3, and erbB4 are expressed in all subtypes of melanocytic lesions, but with quantitative and qualitative differences.

Melanoma is thus a model cancer to test the hypothesis that in vivo MT from cancer patients can be used as immunological probes for immunogenic tumor antigens. MT were obtained by 6-thioguanine (TG) selection of lymphocytes from peripheral blood and tumor tissues, and wild-type T cells (WT) were obtained analogously without TG selection. cDNA sequences of the T cell receptor beta chains (TRB) were used as unambiguous biomarkers of in vivo clonality and as indicators of T cell specificity. Public TRB were identified in MT from the blood and tumor of different melanoma patients. Such public TRB were not found in normal control MT or WT. As an indicator of T cell specificity for melanoma, the >2600 MT and WT TRB, including the public TRB from melanoma patients, were compared to a literature-derived empirical database of >1270 TRB from melanoma-reactive T cells. Various degrees of similarity, ranging from 100% conservation to 3-amino acid motifs (3-mer), were found between both melanoma patient MT and WT TRBs and the empirical database. The frequency of 3-mer and 4-mer TRB matching to the empirical database was significantly higher in MT compared with WT in the tumor (p=0.0285 and p=0.006, respectively). In summary, in vivo MT from melanoma patients contain public TRB as well as T cells with specificity for characterized melanoma antigens. We conclude that in vivo MT merit study as novel probes for uncharacterized immunogenic antigens in melanoma and other malignancies.",

The monoclonal antibodies, four immunoglobulin Gs and two pentameric immunoglobulin Ms, were partially purified to remove mouse immunoglobulin and then conjugated to biotin for immunocytochemical and immunohistochemical studies. With the avidin:biotin:peroxidase complex method to detect and amplify binding by the biotin-conjugated human monoclonal antibodies, we found the six antibodies to be reactive against cytoplasmic determinants in five short-term melanoma cultures and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded melanoma tumors from four patients. The antigenic target of the antibodies identified was not carcinoembryonic antigen. Two antibodies, 2-139-1 and 6-26-3, were studied in more detail. Each stained 25 of 25 specimens of melanomas. Little or no reactivity was detected against fixed sections of normal skin, which included tissues such as epidermis, dermis, monocytes, lymphocytes, and vascular endothelium. More striking was the absence of binding to melanocytes in the basal layer of the skin or to pigmented nevus cells. Both antibodies showed cross-reactivity against other tumors, in particular colonic and prostatic carcinomas. In the normal colon, reactivity was restricted to the surface of the columnar epithelium; no reactivity was detected against normal prostatic epithelium. Reactivity was also not observed against liver and lung. However, the epithelia of the renal tubules, pancreatic ducts, and salivary ducts were all reactive.

Immunomodulatory strategies initiated after progression have recently been reported to be poorly efficient. By characterizing the immunological interactions between T cells and cancer cells in clinical material as well as the influence of the FDA-approved BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib on the immune system, we aimed at unraveling new strategies to expand the efficacy of adoptive T-cell transfer, which represents one of the most promising approaches currently in clinical development for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Here we show that blocking the BRAF-MAPK pathway in BRAF signaling-addicted melanoma cells significantly increases the ability of T cells contained in clinical grade tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes to recognize autologous BRAF(V600) mutant melanoma cell lines in vitro. Antitumor reactivity was improved regardless of the class of antigen recognized by tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells. Microarray data suggests that improved tumor recognition is associated with modified expression of MHC Class I-associated proteins as well as of heat-shock proteins. In conclusion, our preclinical data suggest that an appropriately timed sequential treatment of BRAF(V600) mutant melanoma with vemurafenib and adoptive T-cell transfer might result in synergistic antineoplastic effects owing to an increased immunogenicity of cancer cells.",

Hierarchical clustering analysis supported that melanoma metastases have a phylogenetically determined, rather than a stochastic, pattern of antigen expression that varies by anatomic site. Furthermore, tyrosinase expression was more frequently lost in metastatic sites outside of the brain and was uniquely correlated with both endogenous CD8(+) and CD4(+) T-cell infiltrates.;Site-specific antigen heterogeneity represents a novel attribute for human melanoma metastases that should be considered in future therapy development and when assessing the responsiveness to antigen-specific immunotherapies.",

Melanoma is a highly immunogenic malignancy, and in our previous studies the treatment of metastatic melanoma with TP5 showed encouraging results. In the present study, we evaluated the clinical efficacy and tolerability of high dose intravenous TP5 in 16 patients with melanoma which had metastasized to cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue. All patients were given 1 g intravenous TP5 every second day for 7 weeks and were then evaluated; responders were given a subsequent course of 2 g intravenous TP5 every second day for 5 weeks. Six patients showed a partial response after the first course and were given the second course: one patient achieved a complete response, while the other five remained in partial response at the end of the treatment. The mean duration of response was 7.5 months. No drug side effects were observed. Histopathological and immunohistochemical evaluation of regressing metastatic nodules showed the presence of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, necrosis, sclerosis, intratumoral vascular proliferation and microthrombosis. Immunophenotyping of lymphoid infiltrates demonstrated the prevalence of CD4+ and CD45RO+ T-lymphocytes in one patient.

Primary MM is a diagnostic problem because of the great variety of its clinical features. Asymmetric configuration, irregular border, speckled color(r)diameter of more than 6 mm, and elevation of the surface, suggest suspicion of malignant alteration, but even then misdiagnosis is possible. For the final diagnosis of MM histopathological confirmation is necessary. The method to use is the extensive excisional biopsy of the lesion and its borders [2]. Histopathological diagnosis is based on microscopic findings which include: histogenetic type of MM, tumour thickness according to Breslow, level of invasion according to Clark, presence of ulceration, grade of lymphocyte infiltration, mitote rate, type of cells, presence of melanin in cells [2, 3].;A five-year survival of patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma (MM) was studied according to sex, age and distinct features of the tumour: site, type of initial therapy, stage of the disease, time from the first signs of the disease to diagnosis of MM, histological findings (histogenetic type, Breslow's tumour thickness, Clark's level of invasion, presence of ulceration, degree of lymphocyte infiltration, number of mitoses, type of cells, intensity of pigmentation) and presence of metastases. The retrospective study included 336 patients with cutaneous MM. There were 185 female (55.1%) and 151 male patients (44.9%), aged 14-83 years, mean age 48.8 years, who were treated at the institute of Oncology and Radiology in Belgrade from 1978 to 1990. The mean follow-up was 60 months (1-144 months). Melanoma in situ had 16 (4.1%) patients. Stage I had 45 patients (14.1%), stage II 163 (48.5%), stage III 83 (24.7%) and stage IV 29 (8.6%) patients. Acral location on hands and feet had 40 (11.9%) patients, on head and neck 36 (10.7%), on the trunk 146 (43.5%) and on the extremities (except hands and feet) 114 (33.9%) patients. Nodular melanoma (NM) was the most frequent histogenetic type revealed in 150 (44.6%) patients, superficial spreading melanoma (SSM) in 105 (31.1%) patients, acral melanoma (AM) in 39 (11.5%) and lentigo malignant melanoma (LMM) in 32 (9.4%) patients (Table 1). Five-year survival rate was calculated according to Kaplan-Meier's method and significance of the difference between some categories was tested by Long-Rank's test; the significance less than 0.05 was accepted.;Statistically highly significant differences in a five-year survival (p < 0.01) were related to sex p = 0.0005, age p = 0.0017, tumour site p = 0.0025, initial therapy p = 0.0036, stage of MM p = 0.0000, histological features of the tumour p = 0.0000 and presence of metastases p = 0.0000. A better five-year survival prognosis was found in female patients (64.5%) compared to male patients 44.5%, aged 27-46 years (87.3%) compared to patients younger than 26 years (43.5%); patients with melanoma on the extremities (except hands and feet) had a better five-year survival (66.7%) compared to patients younger than 26 years (43.5%); patients with melanoma on the extremities (except hands and feet) had a better five-year survival (65.7%) compared to patients with melanoma on the trunk or acral melanoma (47.3%).

In the present study, we investigated the feasibility of transducing human tumor cells with genes coding for gamma-interferon (IFN gamma) or alpha-interferon (IFN alpha), which are two other cytokines that can enhance host antitumor immune responses. Tumor cells from 12 melanoma and 2 renal cell carcinoma patients were transduced with retroviral vectors containing the gene for IFN gamma. Northern blot analysis showed IFN gamma transcripts only in the IFN gamma gene-transduced cells. In both IFN gamma-secreting and non-secreting tumor lines, the cell surface expression of HLA class I and class II molecules increased following transduction. However, the magnitude of the increase in HLA expression appeared to be greater in tumor lines secreting IFN gamma. Two melanoma cell lines were successfully transduced with an IFN alpha retroviral vector. Melanoma cells transduced with the IFN alpha gene contained IFN alpha RNA transcripts and secreted large amounts of IFN alpha. In contrast to cells transduced with the IFN gamma gene, the expression of HLA class II molecules was not increased in the IFN alpha gene-transduced cells. Finally, we tested the ability of HLA.DR+ melanoma cells, which had been transduced with the IFN gamma gene, to stimulate specific cytokine release by autologous CD4+ TIL. Specific secretion of cytokine by TIL occurred when the TIL and IFN gamma gene-transduced tumor cells were cultured together but not when TIL were cultured alone or with control nontransduced tumor cells. These results suggest that molecules newly expressed on the transduced cells promoted antigen presentation and T-cell responses against the transduced tumor cells. The insertion of the IFN gamma gene into melanoma cells may be useful either for active immunization against melanoma or for the generation of TIL to be used in adoptive immunotherapy.",

Gene expression analysis divided the UM panel into three classes. Class I presented tumors with a good prognosis and a distinct genomic make up that is characterized by 6p gain. The UM with a bad prognosis were subdivided into class IIa and class IIb. These classes presented similar survival risks but could be distinguished by tumor heterogeneity. Class IIa presented homogeneous tumors while class IIb tumors, on average, contained 30% of non-mutant cells. Tumor heterogeneity coincided with expression of a set of immune genes revealing an extensive immune infiltrate in class IIb tumors. Molecularly, class IIa and IIb presented the same genomic configuration and could only be distinguished by 8q copy number. Moreover, UM establish in the void of the immune privileged eye indicating that in IIb tumors the infiltrate is attracted by the UM. Combined our data show that chromosome 8q contains the locus that causes the immune phentotype of UM. UM thereby provides an unique opportunity to study immune attraction by tumors. ",

Gene transfection approaches have proved more successful. A gene family named MAGE codes for antigens recognized by autologous CTL on a melanoma tumor. These genes are not expressed in normal tissues except for testis. They are expressed in many tumors of several histological types.

Subcutaneous B16 melanoma tumors in C57BL/6 mice were treated with intraperitoneal injections of DTIC followed by the topical application of CpG-ODN over the tumors. This therapeutic approach abrogated the growth of established tumors and significantly enhanced survival. Topical CpG application was more effective than intratumoral CpG. Cell depletion studies indicated that the antitumor effect was dependent on both CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells but not on natural killer (NK) cells. Tumor-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity was generated in treated animals and was highest in topically treated animals. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that DTIC, but not CpG, enhanced tumor cell apoptosis. Further, topical CpG induced an expansion of a B220(+)CD8(+) subset of dendritic cells and a subset of NK1.1(+) CD11c(+) cells within the tumors.

This leads to increased oncogenic properties such as tumor cell invasion, metastatic potential, and resistance to apoptosis. Blockade of the MAPK pathway with highly specific kinase inhibitors induces unprecedented tumor response rates in patients with advanced BRAF(V600) mutant melanoma. Immune checkpoint blockade with monoclonal antibodies targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 and programed death-1/PD-L1 has also demonstrated striking anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced melanoma. Tumor responses are likely limited by multiple additional layers of immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment. There is emerging preclinical and clinical evidence suggesting that MAPK inhibition has a beneficial effect on the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, providing a strong rationale for combined immunotherapy and MAPK pathway inhibition in melanoma. The T cell response has been the main focus in the studies reported to date. Since dendritic cells (DCs) are important in the induction of tumor-specific T cell responses, the impact of MAPK pathway activation in melanoma on DC function is critical for the melanoma directed immune response. BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells modulate DCs through the MAPK pathway because its blockade in melanoma cells can reverse suppression of DC function. As both MEK/BRAF inhibition and immune checkpoint blockade have recently taken center stage in the treatment of melanoma, a deeper understanding of how MAPK pathway inhibition affects the tumor immune response is needed.

On magnetic resonance images (MRI), a well-delineated orbital tumor medio-distal to the eye was detected, respecting the eye-ball and the orbital walls. The aim of navigation-assisted surgery was to excise the progressive tumor while maintaining vision. A modified latero-cranial orbitotomy was used to approach the tumor. Microscopic analysis of the resection specimen revealed a melanoma. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. The diplopia improved rapidly. Two further eye-saving second-look revisions of the tumor site excluded further melanoma infiltrates and revealed melanophages in scar tissue. Intraoperative navigation was used during all procedures. The tumor showed some interesting features concerning its histopathological appearance and magnetic resonance imaging. Detailed histopathological investigations supported the decision for organ-saving surgery. Follow-up MRI and positron emission tomograms up to 14 months later showed neither local tumor recurrence nor distant spread.;In the presented case with the incidental finding of orbital melanoma without invasion of the globe or orbital walls, navigation-assisted surgery supported the eye-saving operating procedures.",

Foxp3 expression has been reported in a variety of solid tumors, including melanoma. In this study, we validated Foxp3 expression in both tumor-infiltrating Tregs and melanoma cells by performing immunohistochemical analysis of human melanoma tissue sections. Further, we assessed Foxp3 expression in melanoma cell lines by performing flow cytometry, confocal microscopic analysis, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and Western blotting. Inhibition of Foxp3 expression in melanoma cells using small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in downregulation of B7-H1 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β expression; in contrast, Foxp3 overexpression resulted in the upregulation of the expression of these proteins. Coculture of Foxp3-expressing melanoma cells with naive CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells resulted in strong inhibition of T-cell proliferation. This antiproliferative effect was partially abrogated by specific inhibition of Foxp3 expression and was effectively enhanced by overexpression of Foxp3. We observed an attenuated antiproliferative effect even when melanoma cells and T cells in the coculture were separated using Transwell inserts. These findings indicated that melanoma cells could have Foxp3-dependent Treg-like suppressive effects on T cells and suggested that the mimicking of Treg function by melanoma cells may represent a possible mechanism of tumor resistance to immune destruction in the melanoma tumor microenvironment.",

Peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated by Ficoll gradient centrifugation (fraction F); subsequently the phagocytic and adherent cells were removed and the supernating cell population (fraction fff) was passaged through IgG anti-IgG columns to obtain a B cell free lymphocyte suspension (fraction fff-c). cells from the 3 lymphocyte fractions and from defibrinated whole blood were simultaneously tested for cytotoxic activity against unsensitized IGR3 target cells (SCMC assay) and IGR3 cells perviously sensitized with a rabbit anti-melanoma IgG (ADCC assay). Dose-response curves were established with all lymphocyte fractions and with whole blood. The following results were obtained. 1. With all lymphocyte fractions tested, ADCC was approximately 15 time higher than SCMC, whereas with whole blood, the difference tended to be less pronounced. 2. Elimination of phagoctic and adherent cells had no significant effect on SCMC and ADCC. 3.

The only difference seen between lymphocyte cytotoxicity of melanoma patients and control persons was a slight, but non-significant depression of SCMC and ADCC in melanoma patients.

Tyrosinase-related protein 2 (TRP-2) is a melanogenic enzyme expressed by both melanocytes and melanomas that is reported to be a candidate melanoma rejection antigen. To study the role of self-reactive CD8+ T cells in tumor immunity and autoimmunity, we generated mice that bear a T-cell receptor transgene (TCR Tg) specific for the TRP-2(180-188) epitope. TRP-2 TCR Tg mice did not spontaneously develop depigmentation despite systemic expression of TRP-2 in the skin. Peripheral T cells from these TCR Tg mice exhibited a naive phenotype and proliferated in response to TRP-2 in vitro. In addition, transfer of in vitro-activated Tg T cells reduced B16 pulmonary tumor burden, but not subcutaneous tumors. We next sought to determine the in vivo responses of the Tg T cells to endogenous and tumor-derived TRP-2. Adoptive transfer of naive TCR Tg T cells into wild-type C57BL/6 mice, in combination with a TRP-2-pulsed dendritic cell vaccine, induced proliferation of the Tg T cells and resulted in migration of the Tg T cells into a subcutaneous B16 melanoma tumor. Although these tumor-infiltrating Tg T cells remained reactive against TRP-2, they did not reduce growth of the primary subcutaneous tumor; similarly, these in vivo-primed effector cells had no significant effect on the growth of pulmonary nodules. These data demonstrate that despite in vivo priming, tumor-infiltrating T cells may fail to reduce tumor burden. Determining the basis for the inability of the tumor microenvironment to sustain effective antitumor responses will be critical for designing newer, more potent antitumor immunotherapies.",

The lesion was consistent with prolapsed uveal tissue through a cataract wound masquerading as a melanoma. Therefore, uveal prolapse should be considered in the differential diagnosis of conjunctival melanoma or extraocular extension of uveal melanoma.",

In this study, the autophagic activity was investigated in a series of 99 uveal melanomas after immunohistochemical staining for the autophagy-associated proteins MAP1LC3A and BECN1, most commonly known as LC3A and Beclin 1, respectively. These were assessed in parallel with the hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1A) and its downstream protein lactate dehydrogenase 5 (composed by five LDHA subunits). Increased autophagic reactivity, detected by MAP1LC3A or BECN1, was associated with intense pigmentation and tumor hypoxia. Uveal melanomas with extensive overexpression of BECN1 or those with underexpression of this protein were associated with the worst prognosis, but the former manifested metastases much earlier than the latter; only 58% of patients with extensive BECN1 overexpression were alive at 4 years, compared with 80% of patients with underexpressed patterns. It is concluded that autophagy is commonly upregulated in uveal melanomas, and may be associated with hypoxia and intense pigmentation.

T lymphocytes play a major role both in tumor immunity and autoimmunity. CD28, Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) and inducible costimulator (ICOS) molecules are important secondary signal molecules in the T lymphocyte activation. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CD28/CTLA4/ICOS gene region were reported to be associated with several autoimmune diseases including, type-1 diabetes, SLE, autoimmune thyroid diseases and celiac disease. In this study, we investigated the association of SNPs in the CD28, CTLA4 and ICOS genes with the risk of melanoma. We also assessed the prognostic effect of the different polymorphisms in melanoma patients. Twenty-four tagging SNPs across the three genes and four additional SNPs were genotyped in a cohort of 763 German melanoma patients and 734 healthy German controls. Influence on prognosis was determined in 587 melanoma cases belonging to stage I or II of the disease. In general, no differences in genotype or allele frequencies were detected between melanoma patients and controls. However, the variant alleles for two polymorphisms in the CD28 gene were differentially distributed in cases and controls. Similarly no association of any polymorphism with prognosis, except for the rs3181098 polymorphism in the CD28 gene, was observed. In addition, individuals with AA genotype for rs11571323 polymorphism in the ICOS gene showed reduced overall survival. However, keeping in view the correction for multiple hypothesis testing our results suggest that the polymorphisms in the CD28, CTLA4 and ICOS genes at least do not modulate risk of melanoma and nor do those influence the disease prognosis in the investigated population.",

We find that Notch3 is specifically upregulated in melanoma-endothelial cell cocultures and is functionally associated with increased Notch signaling in melanoma cells. Furthermore, induced Notch3 signaling in melanoma cell lines leads to enhanced tumor cell migration without associated increases in tumor cell growth. Additionally, Notch3 expression is specifically associated with malignant patient samples and is not evident in benign nevi.

Two clones from a single patient were sequenced and detected in three different tumor sites (skin biopsies), whereas only one of them was also present in peripheral blood. Biopsies from this patient did not show major repertoire changes during in vivo IL-2 treatment. In contrast, in biopsies from a second patient, the expression of all the detected V beta subfamilies was increased and a larger number of clones expanded, probably as a result of therapy. A similar evolution was found among infiltrating T cells cultured in vitro from a third patient for several weeks in the presence of IL-2, where the largely polyclonal repertoire of fresh T cells (from invaded lymph nodes) was dramatically reduced to mainly clonal expansions in all V beta subfamilies detected. The high resolution method used here enables a rapid, comprehensive, qualitative, and semiquantitative description of the T cell repertoire of heterogeneous cell populations.

In recent clinical trials, however, immune responses against melanoma antigens have been elicited without consistent clinical responses, suggesting the need for approaches that potentiate the specific cellular immune response. Since B lymphocytes have been reported to exert a negative effect on the cellular arm of the immune response in certain model systems, the authors compared the protective immunity elicited by melanoma antigens in B cell-deficient microMT mice to that obtained in fully immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice. Immunization with melanoma-associated antigens was accomplished using recombinant adenovirus (Ad) vectors encoding human gp100 (Ad2/gp100) or murine TRP-2 (Ad2/mTRP-2). A single dose of Ad2/gp100 or Ad2/mTRP-2 inhibited the growth of established subcutaneous B16 melanoma tumors in B cell-deficient but not wild-type C57BL/6 mice. The enhanced tumor protection observed in B cell-deficient mice appeared to be associated with potentiation of the magnitude and longevity of the specific cellular immune response. Natural killer (NK) cells were also found to be essential to the protective immune response in microMT mice because NK cell depletion with anti-asialo-GM1 antibody resulted in both the loss of tumor growth suppression and attenuation of the specific cellular immune response. The authors conclude that the protective cell-mediated immunity provoked by Ad-based cancer vaccines is enhanced in the absence of B cells, suggesting that a therapeutic regimen that includes depletion of B lymphocytes may be beneficial to cancer vaccine therapy.",

The fate of the tumor antigens in these cells largely depends on their ability to be processed and phagocytosed by dendritic cells (DCs). Flow cytometric analysis shows that human DCs form conjugates more efficiently with dead uveal melanoma cells, and consequently these are effective stimuli of lymphocyte proliferation. However, only DCs pulsed with apoptotic cells were able to induce proliferation of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and stimulate antigen-specific T cells. This study demonstrates for the first time that DCs derived from melanoma patients process and present antigens derived from both HLA-matched or HLA-mismatched human apoptotic tumor cells stimulating both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

The most frequent toxicities observed with ipilimumab involve the gastrointestinal tract and are attributed to activation of the immune system. Constipation has been reported as a symptom in the clinical trials of anti-CTLA-4 antibody and is mostly low grade. However, it is not traditionally perceived as an immune-mediated toxicity. We report the case of a patient who developed severe refractory constipation during treatment with ipilimumab for metastatic melanoma. Biopsies of the colonic wall revealed prominent inflammatory infiltrates of mononuclear lymphocytes associated with the myenteric nervous system. There was a pathologic complete remission of melanoma. To our knowledge, this is the first clinical report of either inflammatory enteric neuropathy or constipation as an immune-related adverse event from anti-CTLA-4 antibody treatment. We discuss the pathophysiology and suggest careful monitoring of patients for development of this complication from ipilimumab therapy.",

Adoptive cell therapy (ACT), where T cells are manipulated ex vivo and subsequently re-infused in an autologous manner, has been performed using T cells from various sources. Some of the highest clinical response rates for metastatic melanoma have been reported in trials using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). These protocols still have room for improvement and furthermore are currently only performed at a limited number of institutions. The goal of this work was to develop TILs as a therapeutic product at our institution.;TILs from 40 melanoma tissue specimens were expanded and characterized. Under optimized culture conditions, 72% of specimens yielded rapidly proliferating TILs as defined as at least one culture reaching ≥3×10(7) TILs within 4 weeks. Flow cytometric analyses showed that cultures were predominantly CD3+ T cells, with highly variable CD4+:CD8+ T cell ratios. In total, 148 independent bulk TIL cultures were assayed for tumor reactivity. Thirty-four percent (50/148) exhibited tumor reactivity based on IFN-γ production and/or cytotoxic activity. Thirteen percent (19/148) showed specific cytotoxic activity but not IFN-γ production and only 1% (2/148) showed specific IFN-γ production but not cytotoxic activity. Further expansion of TILs using a 14-day \"rapid expansion protocol\" (REP) is required to induce a 500- to 2000-fold expansion of TILs in order to generate sufficient numbers of cells for current ACT protocols. Thirty-eight consecutive test REPs were performed with an average 1865-fold expansion (+/- 1034-fold) after 14 days.;TILs generally expanded efficiently and tumor reactivity could be detected in vitro. These preclinical data from melanoma TILs lay the groundwork for clinical trials of ACT.",

The rationale comes from the knowledge that many patients with melanoma have endogenous immune responses against their tumor cells and clinically meaningful tumor regression can be achieved in a minority of patients using cytokines such as interleukin-2 and adoptive cellular therapy. In the last 5 years there has been a revolution in the clinical management of melanoma in large measure based on the development of antibodies that influence T cell regulatory pathways by overcoming checkpoint inhibition and providing co-stimulation, either of which results in significantly more effective immune-mediated tumor destruction. This review will describe the pre-clinical and clinical application of antagonistic antibodies targeting the T-cell checkpoints cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death 1 (PD-1), and agonistic antibodies targeting the costimulatory pathways OX40 and 4-1BB.

While the role of BRAF(V600E) in tumorigenesis is well established, its involvement in metastasis that is clinically observed in melanoma patients remains a topic of debate. Here, we show that BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells have extensive invasion activity as assayed by the generation of F-actin and cortactin foci that mediate membrane protrusion, and degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Inhibition of BRAF(V600E) blocks melanoma cell invasion. In a BRAF(V600E)-driven murine melanoma model or in patients' tumor biopsies, cortactin foci decrease upon inhibitor treatment. In addition, genome-wide expression analysis shows that a number of invadopodia-related genes are downregulated after BRAF(V600E) inhibition. Mechanistically, BRAF(V600E) induces phosphorylation of cortactin and the exocyst subunit Exo70 through ERK, which regulates actin dynamics and matrix metalloprotease secretion, respectively. Our results provide support for the role of BRAF(V600E) in metastasis and suggest that inhibiting invasion is a potential therapeutic strategy against melanoma. ",

In the present study, we investigated the occurrence, the in vivo relevance, and the underlying mechanisms of cannibalism in human melanoma. As first evidence, we observed that tumor cannibalism was clearly detectable in vivo in metastatic lesions of melanoma and often involved T cells, which could be found in a degraded state within tumor cells. Then, in vitro experiments confirmed that cannibalism of T cells was a property of metastatic melanoma cells but not of primary melanoma cells. In particular, morphologic analyses, including time-lapse cinematography and electron microscopy, revealed a sequence of events, in which metastatic melanoma cells were able to engulf and digest live autologous melanoma-specific CD8(+) T cells. Importantly, this cannibalistic activity significantly increased metastatic melanoma cell survival, particularly under starvation condition, supporting the evidence that tumor cells may use the eating of live lymphocytes as a way to \"feed\" in condition of low nutrient supply. The mechanism underlying cannibalism involved a complex framework, including lysosomal protease cathepsin B activity, caveolae formation, and ezrin cytoskeleton integrity and function. In conclusion, our study shows that human metastatic melanoma cells may eat live T cells, which are instead programmed to kill them, suggesting a novel mechanism of tumor immune escape. Moreover, our data suggest that cannibalism may represent a sort of \"feeding\" activity aimed at sustaining survival and progression of malignant tumor cells in an unfavorable microenvironment.",

In this regard, immunotherapies involving adoptive cell transfer (ACT) of tumor-specific T-cells constitute a promising approach to treat melanoma. However, these cells do not always preexist in the patient or are difficult to isolate and/or expand. Thus, as the specificity of T-lymphocytes is determined by their T-cell receptor (TCR), it is possible to convert peripheral T-cells into cancer specific lymphocytes by transducing them to express a receptor that recognizes a defined tumor epitope. To this end, retroviral vectors can be used to efficiently transduce actively dividing cells such as proliferating T cells, while being relatively safe to the user.

The specific MAbs (436, IND1, and 9.2.27) recognize two different melanoma cell surface antigens (Mr 125,000 glycoprotein melanoma-associated antigen and high molecular weight melanoma-associated antigen) and have equilibrium association constants differing by two orders of magnitude (10(8)-10(10) M-1). SK-MEL-2 tumors were poorly vascularized and were composed of one or several collections of tumor cells with few intratumor blood vessels. In contrast, M21 tumors induced a strong angiogenic response and were organized into multiple small tumor cell nests separated from each other by fine blood vessels. Neither tumor developed extensive connective tissue stroma. In both tumors, hyperpermeable blood vessels were concentrated at the tumor-host interface but some intratumor vessels in M21 tumors were also leaky. Macromolecular tracers extravasated extensively from leaky vessels into tumor stroma but penetrated poorly into tumor parenchyma. All three tumor-specific MAbs stained tumor cell surfaces in a time-dependent fashion such that one-half or more of all tumor cells were stained by 24-48 h. Tumor cell staining was favored by increased density of tumor cell antigens but, at the doses studied, was little affected by differences in affinity among tumor-specific antibodies. The distribution of MAb staining was nonuniform in two respects: (a) peripherally situated tumor cells were more likely to be stained than centrally placed cells, and only in the smallest tumors did MAb reach centrally placed tumor cells; and (b) staining was nonuniform in different parts of the same tumor. The inhomogeneity of tumor cell staining by tumor-specific MAb was attributable to several factors, including: tumor blood vessel number, distribution, perfusion and permeability; distribution of tumor connective tissue stroma; small volume of the parenchymal interstitial space and relatively impaired diffusion of macromolecules in that space (low effective diffusivity of MAb); and interactions between specific MAbs and tumor cells. Of these factors, those associated with the parenchymal compartment apparently were rate limiting, and strategies that enhance parenchymal penetration are likely to improve solid tumor therapy with MAbs.",

Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) plays a pivotal role in integrating growth factor and adhesion-related signaling pathways, facilitating cell spreading and migration. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 and 2, implicated in tumor growth and survival, has also been linked to clinical melanoma progression. We have cloned the MCSP core protein and expressed it in the MCSP-negative melanoma cell line WM1552C. Expression of MCSP enhances integrin-mediated cell spreading, FAK phosphorylation, and activation of ERK1/2. MCSP transfectants exhibit extensive MCSP-rich microspikes on adherent cells, where it also colocalizes with alpha4 integrin. Enhanced activation of FAK and ERK1/2 by MCSP appears to involve independent mechanisms because inhibition of FAK activation had no effect on ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These results indicate that MCSP may facilitate primary melanoma progression by enhancing the activation of key signaling pathways important for tumor invasion and growth.",

By stimulating lymphocytes of melanoma patient MZ2 with a subclone of the tumor cell line of this patient, we obtained a CTL clone that lysed this subclone but did not lyse other subclones of the same melanoma cell line. The sensitive melanoma subclone was found to express a much higher level of tyrosinase than the others, suggesting that the antigen recognized by the CTL might be encoded by tyrosinase. Transfection of a tyrosinase cDNA demonstrated that the CTL clone indeed recognized a tyrosinase product presented by HLA-B*4403. The relevant antigenic peptide corresponds to residues 192-200 of the tyrosinase protein. Lymphoblastoid cells of the B*4402 subtype were not recognized by the CTL following incubation with the peptide. Nevertheless, by stimulating in vitro lymphocytes of a healthy HLA-B*4402 donor with autologous adherent cells pulsed with the same peptide, we obtained a CTL clone which recognized tumor cells expressing tyrosinase and HLA-B*4402.

Both in VGP and in nodal metastases, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) may be present with different patterns. In the evaluation of the primary tumor, these patterns have been defined as brisk, non-brisk, and absent. The histologic slides of regional lymph node metastases, the site of first recurrence in 99 consecutive melanoma patients, were reviewed. Disease-free survival of these cases and whether or not they were treated with rIFN alpha-2A was recorded to identify any relationship among different patterns of TILs, therapy, and prognosis. Of 99 cases, 16 were classified as brisk, 37 as non-brisk, and 46 as absent. At 30 months of follow-up the disease-free survival was 81.3% for brisk cases, 46.8% for non-brisk cases, and 29.3% for absent groups (p = .007). Multivariate analysis confirmed the prognostic value of TILs in predicting disease-free survival in patients with regional node metastases. The difference according to the presence or absence of relapse is particularly evident when comparison is made between treated and untreated patients. In conclusion the evaluation of first-recurrence regional node melanoma metastases for TILs, using the same histopathologic criteria as in VGP of primary melanoma, subdivides the cases in brisk, non-brisk, and absent groups. Also, the presence of these patterns in metastatic node melanoma deposits is correlatable to disease-free survival. Our results further stress the difference of prognosis patients treated with rIFN alpha-2A compared to the untreated group. The TILs evaluation may prove useful in selecting those melanoma stage II patients who will best respond to therapy with biologic response modifiers, because the TILs may be the local immune effector cell targets of rIFN alpha-2A or of other biologic agents.",

Galectin-3 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 31 SCCs, 30 BCCs, and 29 non-tumoral skin samples. Galectin-3 expression was higher in normal epidermis than in non-melanoma skin cancers, except for cytoplasmic immunoreactivity in SCC. Cytoplasmic galectin-3 immunoreactivity was significantly higher than nuclear immunoreactivity in non-melanoma skin cancers. Cytoplasmic galectin-3 immunoreactivity was significantly higher in SCC than in both circumscribed and infiltrative BCCs, but no difference was detected between these two types of BCC. Cytoplasmic galectin-3 immunoreactivity predominated within SCCs (p=0.000), and a positive correlation was detected between tumor size and cytoplasmic immunoreactivity (r=0.385, p=0.043). There was no correlation between galectin-3 staining and tumor differentiation and lymph node metastasis.

Their goal was to predict the biological behaviour of malignant melanoma by the histological picture. The study was designed to establish histological characteristics of superficial spreading melanoma. To prove the malignant biological behaviour, only superficial spreading melanomas with metastases in lymph nodes were analysed. The aim of the study was to see whether the melanoma's biological behaviour could be predicted on the basis of its histological picture. A total of 39 cases of superficially spreading malignant melanoma from the Department of Pathology, University Hospital Center Rebro, Zagreb, were analysed. The sections were taken from 5 different places, fixed in 10% purified formalin, paraffin embedded and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. In some cases the sections were additionally stained with Fontana to prove melanin. The sections were analysed by light microscopy. The following histological characteristics were analysed: 1. poor circumscription of the intraepidermal melanocytes; 2. individual melanocytes extending laterally; 3. number of atypical melanocytes above the basal membrane; 4. marked variation in the size and shape of melanocytic nests; 5. tendency of melanocytic nests towards confluence; 6. presence of melanocytes with nuclear atypia; 7. absence of maturation of melanocytes with descent into the dermis; 8. intradermal necrosis and degeneration of melanocytes; 9. lymphocytic infiltrate; 10. desmoplasia and ulceration.

Because B-1 lymphocytes modulate the activity of different immune cells, we decided to study their influence in the resistance against murine B16F10 melanoma in a CCR5 deprived environment. Adoptive transfer of peritoneal B-1 CCR5(+/+) lymphocytes to CCR5(-/-) animals inhibited the establishment of lung metastasis and melanoma cell growth, in comparison to saline-treated CCR5(-/-) mice. In loco cell analysis demonstrated that the adoptive transfer of B-1 CCR5(+/+) lymphocytes to CCR5 deficient host was associated with a more intense influx of T CD8(+) to tumor site, indicating that the presence of CCR5(+/+) B-1 cells in the tumor environment induces the migration of T CD8 CCR5(-/-) cells to the implantation site. To corroborate this idea, CCR5(-/-) mice were injected with non B-1 peritoneal cells from wild type (WT) mice before B16F10 inoculation. In this regimen, CCR5(-/-) mice were not protected from tumor growth reinforcing the idea that, in host absence of CCR5, B-1 cells are essential to confer tumor resistance. This work indicates that, in the host absence of CCR5, naive B-1 cells may activate CD8T lymphocytes thereby promoting tumor resistance.

The autologous 1913 melanoma cell line expressed a mutated HLA-A11 class I gene product that was recognized by the bulk tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes as well as a dominant T cell clone derived from this line. A second dominant T cell clone, T1D1, did not recognize the mutated HLA-A11 product, but recognized an allogeneic melanoma cell line that shared expression of HLA-A11 with the parental tumor cell line. Screening of an autologous melanoma cDNA library with clone T1D1 T cells in a cell line expressing the mutated HLA-A11 gene product resulted in the isolation of a p14ARF transcript containing a 2-bp deletion in exon 2. The T cell epitope recognized by T1D1, which was encoded within the frameshifted region of the deleted p14ARF transcript, was also generated from frameshifted p14ARF or p16INK4a transcripts that were isolated from two additional melanoma cell lines. The results of monitoring studies indicated that T cell clones reactive with the mutated HLA-A11 gene product and the mutated p14ARF product were highly represented in the peripheral blood of patient 1913 1 wk following adoptive transfer, indicating that they may have played a role in the nearly complete tumor regression that was observed following this treatment.",

We generated CD3+ CTL lines to melanoma by co-culturing peripheral blood lymphocytes with autologous irradiated melanoma cells and repetitive stimulation with high-dose interleukin-4 in a \"cocktail\" culture medium. CTL lines were investigated for their specificity to kill autologous and allogeneic melanoma. Histocompatibility locus antigen (HLA) class I (A, B) molecules are important restrictive recognition antigens for CTL. Although these antigens are highly polymorphic, they can share a similar immunogenic molecular epitope(s) and can be immunologically cross-reactive. The CTL lines generated were found to kill not only autologous melanoma, but also allogeneic melanomas having class I HLA-A antigens shared or \"cross-reactive\" with autologous HLA-A. These CTL lines were poor killers of melanomas bearing non-shared or non-cross-reactive HLA-A. Cold-target inhibition assays demonstrated this CTL cross-reactivity to allogeneic melanoma specificity. Epstein-Barr-virus-transformed autologous and allogeneic B lymphoblastoid cell lines failed to block autologous melanoma killing, indicating that CTL were not recognizing major histocompatibility complex antigens, serum proteins or culture medium products as the primary target antigen. HLA-A2 was the major shared HLA-A antigen recognized by CTL lines on the melanoma lines studied. CTL lines also recognized shared HLA-A11 and A24 on allogeneic melanoma.

The specimens consisted of 129 tissue samples including superficial (Breslow ≤ 1 mm) and deep (Breslow > 4 mm) melanomas and lymph node metastases. The differences in immunostainings were analysed with non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. Associations between immunohistological staining results and clinical parameters were determined with the χ(2) test. Survival between patient groups was compared by the Kaplan-Meier method using log rank test and Cox's regression model was used for multivariate analyses.;The expression of HAS1 and HAS2 was decreased in deep melanomas and metastases compared to superficial melanomas. Decreased immunostaining of HAS2 in melanoma cells was significantly associated with several known unfavourable histopathologic prognostic markers like increased mitotic count, absence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and the nodular subtype. Furthermore, reduced HAS1 and HAS2 immunostaining in the melanoma cells was associated with increased recurrence of melanoma (p = 0.041 and p = 0.006, respectively) and shortened disease- specific survival (p = 0.013 and p = 0.001, respectively).;This study indicates that reduced expression of HAS1 and HAS2 is associated with melanoma progression and suggests that HAS1 and HAS2 have a prognostic significance in cutaneous melanoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Adoptive immunotherapy with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and interleukin (IL)-2 is reasonably effective in the treatment of patients with advanced melanoma. However, theoretically it should be of greater benefit as adjuvant therapy, especially in high-risk stages (resected stages III and IV). In a preliminary study, 25 patients (aged 23-72 years) with stage III-IV melanoma who underwent resection of metachronous metastases were reinfused with TIL cultivated and expanded in vitro with IL-2 from surgically removed metastases. IL-2 (starting dose 12 x 10 IU/m ) was co-administered as a continuous infusion according to West's scheme. A total of 8/22 (36.3%) evaluable patients were disease-free (DF) at a median follow-up of 5 years. DF survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 44% and 37%, respectively, at 2 years, and 52% and 45% at 3 years. The CNS was the only site of disease recurrence in 57% of patients who relapsed. DF patients received a higher median dose of IL-2 than those who progressed (total dose 110 x 10 versus 86 x 10 IU/m, respectively). The progressive reduction in IL-2 dosage allowed all patients to complete treatment without permanent grade 4 toxicity. Analysis of tumor immunosuppression factors in lymphocytes inside the tumor (TCR zeta and epsilon chains, p56, FAS, and FAS-ligand) confirmed that the immunologic potential of TIL, depressed at the time of metastasectomy, was significantly restored after in vitro culture with IL-2. Adoptive immunotherapy with TIL and IL-2 could improve DFS and OS, although further work is required to determine its role in the treatment of patients with high-risk melanoma.",

Fusion hybrids were generated in vitro between weakly metastatic Cloudman S91 mouse melanoma cells and normal mouse or human macrophages. Hybrids were implanted s.c. in the tail and mice were monitored for metastases. Controls included parental S91 cells, autologous S91 x S91 hybrids, and B16F10 melanoma cells. Of 35 hybrids tested, most were more aggressive than the parental melanoma cells, producing metastases sooner and in more mice. A striking characteristic was heterogeneity amongst hybrids, with some lines producing no metastases and others producing metastases in up to 80% of mice. With few exceptions, hybrids with the highest metastatic potential also had the highest basal melanin content whereas those with the lowest metastatic potential were basally amelanotic, as were the parental melanoma cells. A spontaneous in vivo supermelanotic hybrid between an S91 tumor cell and DBA/2J host cell was one of the most metastatic lines. Hybrids with the highest metastatic potential also exhibited markedly higher chemotaxis to fibroblast-conditioned media. Histologically, the metastatic hybrids demonstrated vascular invasion and spread to distant organs similar to that of metastatic melanomas in mice and humans. Thus previous findings of enhanced metastasis in leukocyte x lymphoma hybrids can now be extended to include leukocyte x melanoma hybrids. Whether such hybridization is a natural cause of metastasis in vivo remains to be determined; however the fusion hybrids with genetically-matched parents described herein so closely resembled naturally-occurring metastatic melanoma cells that they could serve as useful new models for studies of this complex and deadly phenomenon.",

The aim of this study was to verify whether this information can be used to isolate and expand such anti-tumor effectors from fresh lymphocyte populations. We found that one to three different TCR beta-chain variable (TCRBV) regions were significantly expanded in 4-wk mixed lymphocyte-tumor cultures (MLTC) from six HLA-A*0201+ melanoma patients, and that the T cells expressing the expanded TCRBV regions were involved in HLA class I-restricted lysis of the tumor. T cell activation by mAbs to MLTC-selected TCRBV region and CD28 resulted in large scale expansion (1-10 x 10(9) cells) of T cell lines, highly enriched for the expression of a single TCRBV region and for CD8+ T cells. The TCRBV-driven selection was equally effective when applied to patients' or healthy donors' lymphocytes, and the T cell lines isolated from melanoma patients exerted HLA class I-restricted lysis of the autologous tumor. MLTC and TCRBV-selected lines recognized allogeneic melanomas sharing HLA-A and -B alleles with the autologous tumor, but only two of the HLA-A2-restricted lines were directed to a known peptide from melanoma-associated Ags. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis indicated a polyclonal composition of both MLTC and TCRBV-selected lines, but expansion of clonotypes with identical CDR3 length was observed only in the MLTC lines. Thus, TCRBV-driven selection can be exploited to obtain large scale expansion of antitumor CTL lines from melanoma patients.",

Eleven tumors (23%) exhibited definite regression in the form of one or more segmental areas (defects) where the invasive component was replaced by mononuclear cell infiltrate and fibrosis. Thirteen other tumors (27%) had diffuse, nonsegmental changes classified as probable regression. Nineteen lesions (40%) lacked regression, although 14 of these contained focal evidence of host response. Five melanomas (17% of lesions less than 0.75 mm thick) were equivocal for regression. There were no recurrences or metastases. The histologic diagnosis of regression in thin melanomas requires subjective judgments, but segmental defects represent a potentially reproducible criterion. Their width can be measured, and the proportion of the melanoma that has undergone regression can be estimated. The preponderance of data from the literature, supported by this study, indicates that regression has no prognostic importance in the vast majority of thin melanomas. There are observations, however, to suggest that in rare cases, regression may negate the prognostic value of microstaging of a thin melanoma.

Metastatic melanomas are resistant to almost all existing adjuvant therapies such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, so detection of metastases remains a challenge, and no biomarkers are currently available to detect primary tumors with the highest risk of metastasis. Results presented in this paper show that Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) imaging of histological sections followed by supervised partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) can accurately (>90%) identify the main cell types commonly found in melanoma tumors. Here we define six cell types: melanoma cells, erythrocytes, connective tissue (includes blood vessel walls, dermis and collagen regions), keratinocytes, lymphocytes and necrotic cells. Interestingly, more than 98% of the melanoma cells are correctly identified. The spectra of the cells identified as melanomas were then further analyzed. First, we compared melanoma cells in primary tumors (from 26 patients) with melanoma cells from metastases (from 25 patients). Neither supervised nor unsupervised analyses revealed any significant difference. Similarly, we found no significant correlation between the infrared spectra of melanoma cells and the number of proliferative cells assessed by Ki67 immunostaining. Finally, we compared the infrared spectra of primary tumors from patients diagnosed at different stages of the disease. Infrared spectroscopy was capable of pointing out differences between primary tumors of patients at stage I or II and patients at stage III or IV, even by unsupervised analysis. We then developed a supervised PLS-DA model capable of predicting whether tumor cells belonged to one of the two aggregated disease stage groups. The model predicted a high rate of true positives (sensitivity of 88.9%) and a good rate of true negatives (specificity of 70.6%) in external validation. These results demonstrate that infrared spectroscopy can be used to help identify melanoma characteristics related to the cells' invasive capability. ",

Immunoliposomes have been previously shown to enhance the selective localization of immunoliposome-entrapped drugs to solid tumors with improvements in the therapeutic index of the drugs. Previously, we reported that the synthetic retinoid fenretinide (HPR) is an inducer of apoptosis in neuroblastoma (NB) cells, sharing the neuroectodermal origin with melanoma cells. HPR is a strong inducer of apoptosis also in melanoma cells, although at doses 10-fold higher than those achievable clinically. Thus, our purpose was to investigate the in vitro potentiation of its cytotoxic effect on melanoma cells in combination with long-circulating GD2-targeted immunoliposomes. GD2 is a disialoganglioside extensively expressed on tumors of neuroectodermal origin, including melanoma. Murine anti-GD2 antibody (Ab) 14.G2a and its human/mouse chimeric variant ch14.18 have been ligated to sterically stabilized liposomes by covalent coupling of Ab to the polyethylene glycol (PEG) terminus. Ab-bearing liposomes showed specific, competitive binding to and uptake by various melanoma cell lines compared with liposomes bearing non-specific isotype-matched Abs or Ab-free liposomes. Cytotoxicity was evaluated after 2 hr treatment, followed by extensive washing and 72 hr incubation. This treatment protocol was designed to minimize non-specific adsorption of liposomes to the cells, while allowing for maximum Ab-mediated binding. When melanoma cells were incubated with 30 microM HPR entrapped in anti-GD2 liposomes, a significant reduction in cellular growth was observed compared to free HPR, entrapped HPR in Ab-free liposomes or empty liposomes. Cytotoxicity was not evident in tumor cell lines of other origins that did not express GD2. Growth of NB cells was also inhibited by immunoliposomes with entrapped HPR.",

This clone could be identified by its use of a unique TCRBV2-nD1n-J1S6 sequence, and could also be detected by single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) as the dominant TCRBV2-expressing clone among CD8+ TILs propagated from both shoulder and abdominal lesions. Using SSCP analysis, we also demonstrated that this clone was dominant in the fresh tumor tissue and in all TILs in which CD8+ were strongly represented, including several separate but parallel cultures. The SSCP pattern for this clone was not apparent among CD4+ TILs or CD8+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The SSCP analysis of the tumor tissue prior to in vitro culture is an indication that the selection for this anti-tumor cytotoxic T cell clone was a reflection of its in vivo accumulation. Thus, we provide evidence that melanomas are immunogenic and able to select for cytotoxic antitumor-specific TIL clones that are expanded in vivo and can circulate to accumulate in different tumor sites.

Using an ELISPOT assay, naturally occurring functional T cells, which recognize the peptide ALLAVGATK (gp100(17-25)) plus two other HLA-A3 restricted peptides, were detected in a tumor-involved lymph node. The ALLAVGATK-reactive T cells were also evaluated by MHC-tetramers staining and were found to be CD8+ CD45RO+ L-selectin(-) CD11a+, suggesting that they are antigen experienced and have a memory phenotype. Unstimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes from the same patient demonstrated no detectable T-cell responses; however, a single stimulation with ALLAVGATK peptide in vitro resulted in a dramatic expansion of peptide-reactive CTLs. This patient, with evidence of tumor-reactive CTLs targeted to several tumor antigens in a tumor-involved lymph node and with evidence of a circulating memory T-cell response, has remained disease-free for 6 years, despite prior bulky nodal metastasis. In contrast, three HLA-A3+ patients with rapidly progressive metastatic melanoma had no detectable T-cell response in tumor-involved nodes or peripheral blood lymphocytes, even after peptide stimulation ex vivo.

Whether cytolytic cells induce HMGB1 release from tumor cells is not known. We developed a highly sensitive method for detecting intracellular HMGB1 in tumor cells, allowing analysis of the type of cell death and in particular, necrosis. We induced melanoma cell death with cytolytic lymphokine-activated killing (LAK) cells, tumor-specific cytolytic T lymphocytes, TRAIL, or granzyme B delivery and assessed intracellular HMGB1 retention or release to investigate the mechanism of HMGB1 release by cytolytic cells. HMGB1 release from melanoma cells (451Lu, WM9) was detected within 4 h and 24 h following incubation with IL-2-activated PBMC (LAK activity). HLA-A2 and MART1 or gp100-specific cytolytic T lymphocytes induced HMGB1 release from HLA-A2-positive and MART1-positive melanoma cells (FEM X) or T2 cell-loaded, gp100-specific peptides. TRAIL treatment, however, induced HMGB1 release, and it is interesting that this extrinsic pathway-mediated cell death was blocked with the pancaspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone. Conversely, granzyme B delivery did not induce HMGB1 release. HMGB1, along with other intracellular factors released from tumor cells induced by cytolysis, may be important components of the disordered tumor microenvironment. This has important implications for the immunotherapy of patients with cancer. Specifically, HMGB1 may promote healing or immune reactivity, depending on the nature of the local inflammatory response and the presence (or absence) of immune effectors.",

DMM has clinical as well as histological features that may be subtle and overlooked, or misdiagnosed as other benign or malignant lesions that would require less aggressive therapy for cure. We have reviewed the preliminary clinical diagnoses and histological features of 18 cases of desmoplastic malignant melanoma, defined as either an inapparent lesion clinically, or a papule or small nodule less than 0.7 cm, which proved histologically to be DMM. Nine of 18 cases (50%) were clinically pigmented. Histologically, early lesions were characterized by superficial tumor fascicles, and random diffuse hypercellularity in the upper dermis identified as elongated hyperchromatic pleomorphic spindle cells with stromal myxoid change. Neuroidal melanocytic structures, invasion of adventitial dermis, islands of inflammation, and epidermal lentiginous melanocytic hyperplasia were often present. The most reliable and characteristic features of an early lesion of DMM are aggregates of lymphocytes, tumor cell cytological atypia, stromal myxoid change, and poor circumscription of the dermal infiltrate. DMM is a disease best treated by complete excision at the time of initial surgery, but is also a lesion easily missed or misdiagnosed in the early stages. Features of early DMM are identified and illustrated to enable early diagnosis and cure of these lesions.",

We report here the cloning of a cDNA that directs the expression of the antigen recognized by these CTL. This cDNA corresponds to the transcript of the tyrosinase gene. The gene was found to be active in all tested melanoma samples and in most melanoma cell lines. Among normal cells, only melanocytes appear to express the gene. The tyrosinase antigen presented by HLA-A2 may therefore constitute a useful target for specific immunotherapy of melanoma.

The large increases in diagnosis of melanoma without commensurate increases in advanced tumors and mortality are not compatible with presumed malignant behavior of thin melanomas. Increased intensity of melanoma surveillance may artificially increase the incidence of melanoma by harvesting histologically \"malignant\" but biologically benign tumors. Little available evidence suggests the presence of an actual increase in the frequency of biologically malignant tumors. Attempts to increase screening intensity for melanoma may result in further increases in diagnosis of melanomas.

A limiting factor in the effectiveness of this treatment is the apoptosis of the transferred cells when Interleukin-2 (IL-2) administration is withdrawn. In an attempt to improve persistence of the transferred lymphocytes, we cotransduced human peripheral blood lymphocytes with retroviruses encoding Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, antiapoptotic genes of the BCL2 family, and the MART-1 melanoma tumor antigen-specific TCR, DMF5. Lymphocytes were cotransduced with 38% to 64% cotransduction efficiency, and exhibited a marked delay in apoptosis after IL-2 withdrawal. Cotransduction with Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL did not affect cytokine secretion or lytic ability of the DMF5-transduced lymphocytes. After 5 days of IL-2 withdrawal, cotransduced lymphocytes produced similar levels of IFN-γ per cell as DMF5-alone transduced lymphocytes in response to tumor cells. Cotransduction did not alter the phenotype of lymphocytes with respect to a panel of T-cell differentiation markers. In a mouse model of melanoma, adoptively transferred T cells transduced with Bcl-2 persisted better in vivo at the site of tumor, 13 and 21 days after adoptive transfer (P=0.0064 and 0.041, respectively), with evidence of enrichment of the Bcl-2-transduced population over time (P<0.0001). Thus, by coexpressing Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL with a tumor-specific TCR, we have engineered a lymphocyte that resists apoptosis owing to IL-2 withdrawal without altering its tumor-specific function or phenotype, and thus may show improved antitumor effectiveness in vivo after cell transfer.",

Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and anti-CD3 antibody stimulation may be responsible for CD44 down-regulation on CD8(+) T-cells during expansion. Furthermore, CD44 down-regulation using small interfering RNA (siRNA) on TILs dramatically reduced interferon-gamma and IL-2 release upon tumor stimulation.

Beyond harboring extensively heterogeneous resistance mechanisms, melanoma regrowth emerging from BRAF inhibitor selection displayed branched evolution marked by altered mutational spectra/signatures and increased fitness.

Nonetheless, methods currently used for ex vivo TIL expansion have not been evaluated for their efficacy to expand TAA-specific T cells. We have addressed this question here, using a culture method in which high TIL growth was induced by a polyclonal T cell stimulus. Intracellular cytokine assays were performed to measure the proportion of T cells responding to autologous tumor cells among the lymphocytes from lymph node biopsies (TIL) of 26 patients with stage III melanoma. The data show that TIL from 18 of these patients contained detectable amounts of tumor-specific T cells before expansion. Although they decreased somewhat in percent abundance during expansion, they were still present afterwards, ranging from 0.3 to 13.8%. Since a median number of 1.7 x 10(10) TIL was obtained from these patients (starting from 3.6 x 10(6) TIL), a total amount of tumor-reactive cytokine-secreting TIL of between 2.8 x 10(6) and 1.12 x 10(9) was obtained in each case from 18 patients. The TIL populations from 8 patients did not contain tumor-reactive T cells: neither before expansion, nor after expansion. Lack of tumor-reactive TIL only occurs for patients bearing several tumor-invaded lymph nodes (40%), but not for those having a single invaded lymph node. Therefore, high numbers of tumor-reactive T cells can be produced, through a polyclonal TIL stimulation, from most early stage III melanoma patients but from only about half of the patients with a more disseminated disease. For this last group, the possibility of getting tumor-reactive TIL can be predicted by checking the presence of these cells before expansion.",

A major limitation of ACT is the inability to generate or expand autologous tumor-reactive TIL in 25-45 % of patients tested. Methods that successfully identify tumors that are not suitable for TIL generation by standard methods would eliminate the costs of fruitless expansion and enable these patients to receive alternate therapy immediately.;Multispectral fluorescent immunohistochemistry with a panel including CD3, CD8, FoxP3, CD163, PD-L1 was used to analyze the tumor microenvironment in 17 patients with melanoma among our 36-patient cohort to predict successful TIL generation. Additionally, we compared tumor fragments and enzymatic digestion of tumor samples for efficiency in generating tumor-reactive TIL.;Tumor-reactive TIL were generated from 21/36 (58 %) of melanomas and for 12/13 (92 %) tumors where both enzymatic and fragment methods were compared. TIL generation was successful in 10/13 enzymatic preparations and in 10/13 fragment cultures; combination of both methods resulted in successful generation of autologous tumor-reactive TIL in 12/13 patients. In 17 patients for whom tissue blocks were available, IHC analysis identified that while the presence of CD8(+) T cells alone was insufficient to predict successful TIL generation, the CD8(+) to FoxP3(+) ratio was predictive with a positive-predictive value (PPV) of 91 % and negative-predictive value (NPV) of 86 %. Incorporation of CD163+ macrophage numbers and CD8:PD-L1 ratio did not improve the PPV. However, the NPV could be improved to 100 % by including the ratio of CD8(+):PD-L1(+) expressing cells.;This is the first study to apply 7-color multispectral immunohistochemistry to analyze the immune environment of tumors from patients with melanoma. Assessment of the data using unsupervised hierarchical clustering identified tumors from which we were unable to generate TIL. If substantiated, this immune profile could be applied to select patients for TIL generation. Additionally, this biomarker profile may also indicate a pre-existing immune response, and serve as a predictive biomarker of patients who will respond to checkpoint blockade. We postulate that expanding the spectrum of inhibitory cells and molecules assessed using this technique could guide combination immunotherapy treatments and improve response rates.",

To this end, mutant hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) deficient (HPRT-) T-cells were used as probes to detect T-cell clonal amplifications and trafficking in vivo in patients with advanced melanoma. Mutant T-cells from peripheral blood were obtained as clonal isolates or in mass cultures in the presence of 6-thioguanine (TG) selection and from tumor-bearing lymph nodes (LNs) or metastatic melanoma tissues by TG-selected mass cultures. Nonmutant (wild-type) cells were obtained from all sites by analogous means, but without TG selection. cDNA sequences of the T-cell receptor (TCR) beta chains (TCR-beta), determined directly (clonal isolates) or following insertion into plasmids (mass cultures), were used as unambiguous biomarkers of in vivo clonality of mature T-cell clones. Clonal amplifications, identified as repetitive TCR-beta V-region, complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3), and J-region gene sequences, were demonstrated at all sites studied, that is, peripheral blood, LNs, and metastatic tumors. Amplifications were significantly enriched among the mutant compared with the wild-type T-cell fractions. Importantly, T-cell trafficking was manifested by identical TCR-beta cDNA sequences, including the hypervariable CDR3 motifs, being found in both blood and tissues in individual patients.

Indeed, the best evidence of immunogenicity of a spontaneously grown human cancer has been found in this model. Yet considerable doubt has lingered on the very issue of tumor immunity in general and on the subject of melanoma immunity as well. To a great extent, the doubt has persisted mostly because of our past inability to define a true tumor antigen. Fortunately, the human melanoma model has given us a remarkable insight into what had been one of the most tenaciously elusive issues in tumor immunology, namely, the structural definition of \"tumor antigens\": the raison d'être for tumor immunology. This review is confined to the areas of structural definition of melanoma antigens and to the topic of cellular immunity to melanoma because most of the recent findings have occurred in these areas. The topic of melanoma immunotherapy and novel opportunities for immunotherapy in this disease is also discussed.",

The intervention consisted of Ru-106 brachytherapy delivering minimum scleral and apex doses of 300 Gy and 80 Gy, respectively, using a 15-mm or 20-mm plaque. For discrete, posterior tumors, the plaque was positioned eccentrically with its posterior edge aligned with the posterior tumor margin. To ensure correct plaque positioning, any overlying extraocular muscles were dis-inserted, and the locations of both tumor and plaque edges were confirmed by transillumination and indentation. The main outcome measures were conservation of vision of 20/40 or better, 20/200 or better, and Counting Fingers or better, according to baseline variables.;The actuarial rate of conservation of 20/40 or better was 55% at 9 years, loss of such vision correlating with posterior tumor extension (p < 0.001), temporal tumor location (p = 0.001), increased tumor height (p = 0.01), and older age (p < 0.01) (Cox multivariate analysis). Similar analyses showed conservation of 20/200 or better in 57% of eyes at 9 years, loss correlating with reduced initial visual acuity (p < 0.001), posterior tumor extension (p < 0.001), and temporal tumor location (p = 0.006). Counting Fingers or better vision was conserved in 83% of patients at 9 years, loss correlating with increased tumor height (p < 0.0001).

However, it is not known whether tumor Ags can drive in vivo a selective accumulation/expansion of Ag-specific, tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TIL). Therefore, to evaluate this possibility, 39 CTL clones isolated from several independent mixed lymphocyte tumor cultures (MLTC) of TIL and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of an HLA-A2+ melanoma patient and selected for T cell receptor (TCR)-dependent, HLA-restricted tumor lysis, were used for analysis of TCR alpha and beta chain structure by the cDNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique with variable gene-specific primers followed by sequencing. Despite absence of oligoclonality in fresh TIL and PBL, as well as in T cells of day 28 MLTC (day of cloning), sequence analysis of TCR alpha and beta chains of TIL clones revealed a dominance of a major category of melanoma-specific, HLA-A2-restricted T cells expressing a V alpha 8.2/J alpha AP511/C alpha and V beta 2.1/D beta 1/J beta 1.1/C beta 1 TCR. The same TCR was also found in 2 out of 14 PBL clones. The other PBL clones employed a V alpha 2.1 gene segment associated with either V beta 13.2, 14, or w22. Clones A81 (V alpha 2.1/J alpha IGRJ alpha 04/C alpha and V beta 14/D beta 1/J beta 1.2/C beta 1) and A21 (V alpha 8.2/J alpha AP511/C alpha and V beta 2.1/D beta 1/J beta 1.1/C beta 1), representative of the two most frequent TCR of PBL and TIL, respectively, expressed different lytic patterns, but both were HLA-A2 restricted and lysed only HLA-A2+ melanomas and normal melanocytes, thus indicating recognition of two distinct HLA-A2-associated and tissue-related Ags. Finally, by the inverse PCR technique, the specific TCR beta chain (V beta 2.1/D beta 1/J beta 1.1/C beta 1) expressed by the dominant TIL clone was found to represent 19 and 18.4% of all V beta 2 sequences expressed in the fresh tumor sample and in the purified TIL, respectively, but < 0.19% of V beta 2+ sequences expressed in PBL.

Primary uveal melanoma can be treated with a variety of therapies that may limit the growth of the primary tumor in the eye and partially preserve vision. However, none of these treatment modalities prevents the development of metastases, which predominantly arise in the liver and universally remain fatal. Novel therapies are being explored for their effectiveness against uveal melanoma metastases and immunotherapy may be a potential option as an alternative or adjunctive treatment, even in the prophylactic setting. Uveal melanoma may be particularly responsive to T-cell-based immunotherapy because it originates in the immune-privileged eye. The localization of the primary tumor in the immune-privileged eye excuses the tumor cells from continuous immunological pressure. This may render primary uveal melanoma more immunogenic than tumor cells from non-privileged sites and allow expression of novel tumor antigens to which the patient's endogenous T cell repertoire is not tolerized. The clinical and genetic differences between cutaneous and uveal melanomas underscore the need for immunotherapy specifically designed for uveal melanoma patients. In this review, the current developments in the field of immunotherapy for uveal melanoma are discussed, with a special emphasis on T-cell-based strategies.",

One hundred fifty-nine patients who relapsed after an initial partial response or complete response to interleukin-2-based immunotherapy formed the study population for this retrospective review. Medical records, physical examination forms, and relevant radiographs were reviewed to determine response, relapse site(s), and response to treatment for relapse.;Relapse after an initial response to interleukin-2-based therapy occurred in 84 (80%) of 105 patients with metastatic melanoma and in 75 (70%) of 107 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Relapse after an initial partial response involved 71 (97%) of 73 patients with metastatic melanoma and 55 (86%) of 64 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The initial site(s) of relapse after a partial response involved a new site(s), old site(s), or both old and new sites with relatively even distribution.

The efficacy of TCR gene therapy targeting MAGE family antigens, however, has not yet been evaluated in vivo. Here, we demonstrate the in vivo antitumor activity in immunodeficient non-obese diabetic/SCID/γc(null) (NOG) mice of human lymphocytes genetically engineered to express TCR specific for the MAGE-A4 antigen. Polyclonal T cells derived from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were transduced with the αβ TCR genes specific for MAGE-A4, then adoptively transferred into NOG mice inoculated with MAGE-A4 expressing human tumor cell lines. The transferred T cells maintained their effector function in vivo, infiltrated into tumors, and inhibited tumor growth in an antigen-specific manner. The combination of adoptive cell therapy with antigen peptide vaccination enhanced antitumor activity, with improved multifunctionality of the transferred cells. These data suggest that TCR gene therapy with MAGE-A4-specific TCR is a promising strategy to treat patients with MAGE-A4-expressing tumors; in addition, the acquisition of multifunctionality in vivo is an important factor to predict the quality of the T-cell response during adoptive therapy with human lymphocytes.",

The aim of this study was to follow and compare histopathologically the process of prevention of melanoma metastases in lungs of treated and immunized mice. Mice were sacrificed on different days after tumor inoculation, their lungs were weighed and the number of metastases was counted. The lungs were then fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Histological examination of tumor inoculated mice on day 10 revealed the existence of microscopic melanoma lesions (0.01-0.012 mm) that increased gradually in number and size and on day 21, most of the metastases were large and spanned entire lobes, from the pleura to the hilum, measuring up to 3.5 mm and coexisting with scattered, small metastases showing the same morphology and pattern of lung involvement. On day 24, the lungs of untreated mice were massively infiltrated by coalescing metastases replacing up to 50% of the lung tissue and measuring up to 7.0 mm. The number of lung metastases and weight was dramatically decreased by a single injection of BAT monoclonal antibody ten days post tumor inoculation. The treated mice clearly had fewer and smaller metastases in different mice at the different days post tumor inoculation. On day 21, there were few small metastases measuring up to 1.6 mm and on day 24 no lung metastases were detected in this group that appeared with a completely normal lung structure. Immunization with peptide A started one day post tumor inoculation and was compared to immunization with control peptide N. Fourteen days post tumor inoculation, mice immunized with peptide A had only 1-2 metastases (0.012-0.076 mm) and on day 24 ranged up to 2 mm compared to control immunized mice where the tumor developed up to 5-7 mm. Foci of lung inflammation in both the untreated, treated or immunized mice were rare, small, and not preferentially associated with the lung metastases. They were composed mainly of small lymphocytes and a few macrophages.

These specific CMC responses to melanoma cells were partially inhibited by autologous serum. Non-T-cells and nonrosetting cells from melanoma patients were not directly cytolytic for melanoma target cells; however these same subpopulations were cytotoxic in the presence of autologous serum, which indicated antibody-dependent cell cytotoxic responses. Non-T-cell subpopulations from normal donors were not cytotoxic when incubated with autologous serum. A third cytotoxic mechanism was demonstrated with complement (C3) receptor-activated lymphocytes. From both melanoma patients and normal donors, cells forming rosettes with erythrocyte-antibody-complement were nonspecifically cytotoxic for lung fibroblasts and melanoma target cells, These responses were independent of antibody, since melanoma serum presumably containing antibody to melanoma target cells neither enhanced nor blocked cytotoxicity mediated by C3 receptor-bearing lymphocytes. The results indicated that lymphoid cell subpopulations from the same melanoma patient could express at least three different lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity mechanisms against melanoma target cells.",

Five of the 13 parameters examined simultaneously were found to independently influence five year survival rates: 1) pathological stage (I vs II, p = 0.0014), 2) lesion ulceration (present vs absent, p = 0.006), 3) surgical treatment (wide excision vs wide excision plus lymphadenectomy, p = 0.024), 4) melanoma thickness (p = 0.032), and 5) location (upper extremity vs lower extremity vs trunk vs head and neck, p = 0.038). Additional factors considered that had either indirect or no influence on survival rates were clinical stage of disease, age, sex, level of invasion, pigmentation, lymphocyte infiltration, growth pattern, and regression. Most of these latter variables derived their prognostic value from correlation with melanoma thickness, except sex which correlated with location (extremity lesions were more frequent on females, trunk lesions on males). This statistical analysis enabled us to derive a mathematical equation for predicting an individual patient's probability of five year survival. Three categories of risk were delineated by measuring tumor thickness (Breslow microstaging) in Stage I patients: 1) thin melanomas (<0.76 mm) were associated with localized disease and a 100% cure rate: 2) intermediate thickness melanomas (0.76-4.00 mm) had an increasing risk (up to 80%) of harboring regional and/or distant metastases and 3) thick melanomas (>/=4.00 mm) had a 80% risk of occult distant metastases at the time of initial presentation. The level of invasion (Clark's microstaging) correlated with survival, but was less predictive than measuring tumor thickness. Within each of Clark's Level II, III and IV groups, there were gradations of thickness with statistically different survival rates. Both microstaging methods (Breslow and Clark) were less predictive factors in patients with lymph node or distant metastases. Clinical trials evaluating alternative surgical treatments or adjunctive therapy modalities for melanoma patients should incorporate these parameters into their assessment, especially in Stage I (localized) disease where tumor thickness and the anatomical site of the primary melanoma are dominant prognostic factors.",

Melanoma vaccines are designed for the purpose of immune modulation and subsequent anti-tumor effects in the process of an active specific immunotherapy. Previous attempts of these vaccines include immunization with whole tumor cells/cell lysates admixed with nonspecific adjuvants. While these vaccines generated enhanced anti-tumor immunity in a subset of patients, some of which showing prolonged survival compared to historical controls, no clinical benefit has so far been demonstrated in a properly controlled phase III study. New-generation melanoma vaccines, which are based on genetic modifications of tumor cells to express cytokines, generated long-lasting systemic anti-tumor immunity in animal models. Translation of these preclinical results primarily into melanoma patients with advanced diseases, shows the potential of these vaccines to induce systemic anti-tumor immune responses and in some instances tumor regression with acceptably low toxicity. Higher efficacy of this novel vaccine approach would be expected when used in a postsurgical adjuvant setting when the tumor load is small. Also other novel vaccine approaches such as dendritic cell-based therapy hold promise for the treatment of melanoma. But the clinical value of all these new approaches has to be analysed in prospectively randomized clinical studies.",

In bulk cultures, IL-2-activated TIL displaying autologous tumor-specific cytotoxicity (CTL-TIL) produced IFN gamma in culture with medium alone, whereas IL-2-activated noncytotoxic TIL did not. Addition of anti-CD3 mAb or autologous tumor cells up-regulated IFN gamma production in IL-2-activated TIL from 10 of 12 or 6 of 12 cases respectively. Those from 4 of 12 cases (2 CTL-TIL and 2 noncytotoxic TIL) produced IL-2 in culture with medium alone. At the clonal level, 5 (4 CD4+ and 1 CD8+) of 7 autologous tumor-specific CTL clones derived from TIL and 3 (2 CD4+ and 1 CD8+) of 7 noncytotoxic TIL clones produced IFN gamma in culture with medium alone, which was up-regulated by adding anti-CD3 mAb. Two IFN gamma-producing CTL clones tested produced IL-2 in 4x-concentrated supernatants from a 3.5-h culture with medium alone. Furthermore, 2 IFN gamma-producing CTL clones tested expressed mRNA for both IFN gamma and IL-2. IL-2 production and its mRNA expression were up- or down-regulated, respectively, by adding anti-CD3 mAb or autologous tumor cells. IL-4 production was not observed in culture either with medium alone or with IL-2 in any of the cells described above. Anti-CD3 mAb was required for IL-4 production in 3 of 12 IL-2-activated TIL, 2 of 6 CTL clones, and none of 5 noncytotoxic TIL clones. In summary, IFN gamma production was characteristic of melanoma TIL.

Pathologists frequently report these tumors in the scar as recurrent or residual melanoma, apparently without considering the possibility that they may be local metastases and manifestations of systemic disease. In this study of 72 cases, we have shown that the morphological features of locally recurrent melanoma, excluding persistent incompletely excised primary melanoma, and cutaneous metastases of melanoma were identical. Because the prevention of local recurrence is the main reason for wide excision of melanoma beyond complete excision of the primary tumor itself, it is essential that pathologists should classify these neoplasms precisely as either persistent incompletely excised primary melanoma or metastatic melanoma.",

We try to find the significance of some immunohistochemical markers (UCHL1, CD4, CD8) in tumoral inflammatory infiltrate and to establish the statistical correlations between molecular markers and tumor grade and stage. The studied parameters were: CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD56+16+ and CD19+. The statistical results were performed with SPSS v. 15.0. We demonstrate that a CD4+ on-going immune response is elicited in the investigated patients.

The reactivity was not melanoma specific because it could be removed by absorption either with pooled platelets, nonmelanoma tumor cells or in two cases, by both. We conclude that the occurrence of specific antimelanoma antibodies against common or shared surface melanoma associated antigens is an uncommon event in melanoma patients not receiving specific active immunotherapy.

Although the NLRC4 inflammasome is known to have a protective role in tumorigenesis, there is an increased appreciation for the inflammasome-independent actions of NLRC4. Here, we utilized a syngeneic subcutaneous murine model of B16F10 melanoma to explore the role of NLRC4 in tumor suppression. We found that NLRC4-deficient mice exhibited enhanced tumor growth that was independent of the inflammasome components ASC and caspase-1. Nlrc4 expression was critical for cytokine and chemokine production in tumor-associated macrophages and was necessary for the generation of protective IFN-γ-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Tumor progression was diminished when WT or caspase-1-deficient, but not NLRC4-deficient, macrophages were coinjected with B16F10 tumor cells in NLRC4-deficient mice. Finally, examination of human primary melanomas revealed the extensive presence of NLRC4+ tumor-associated macrophages. In contrast, there was a paucity of NLRC4+ tumor-associated macrophages observed in human metastatic melanoma, supporting the concept that NLRC4 expression controls tumor growth. These results reveal a critical role for NLRC4 in suppressing tumor growth in an inflammasome-independent manner.",

Cytological examination showed numerous neoplastic cells with melanin deposition. A diagnosis of thoracic metastasis of malignant melanoma was established based on the gross and microscopic appearance of the pleural fluid.

In this study, we investigated the expression of forkhead/winged helix transcription factor 3 (Foxp3) in melanoma-invaded LNs and determined proportion and functionality of Treg cells among TIL extracted from these 10 metastatic melanoma LNs at different steps of their in vitro expansion. We found that metastatic melanoma LNs expressed very heterogeneous levels of Foxp3 and that CD4+CD25(high) Treg cells extracted from these LNs were detectable at each step of the in vitro culture of TIL but decreasing during the culture. In addition, functional assays demonstrated that these CD4+CD25(high) T cells were capable of suppressing autologous CD8+ and CD4+CD25- T cell proliferation. These cells were indeed Treg cells as they expressed Foxp3.

Oral and/or mucosal melanoma has been routinely considered an extremely malignant tumor with a high degree of local invasiveness and high metastatic propensity. Primary tumor size has been found to be extremely prognostic. The World Health Organization staging scheme for dogs with oral melanoma is based on size, with stage I = <2-cm-diameter tumor, stage II = 2- to <4-cm-diameter tumor, stage III = > or = 4cm tumor and/or lymph node metastasis, and stage IV = distant metastasis. Median survival times for dogs with oral melanoma treated with surgery are approximately 17 to 18, 5 to 6, and 3 months with stage I, II, and III disease, respectively. Significant negative prognostic factors include stage, size, evidence of metastasis, and a variety of histologic criteria. Standardized treatments such as surgery, coarse-fractionation radiation therapy, and chemotherapy have afforded minimal to modest stage-dependent clinical benefits and death is usually due to systemic metastasis. Numerous immunotherapeutic strategies have been employed to date with limited clinical efficacy; however, the use of xenogeneic DNA vaccines may represent a leap forward in clinical efficacy. Oral melanoma is a spontaneous syngeneic cancer occurring in outbred, immunocompetent dogs and appears to be a more clinically faithful therapeutic model for human melanoma; further use of canine melanoma as a therapeutic model for human melanoma is strongly encouraged. In addition, the development of an expanded but clinically relevant staging system incorporating the aforementioned prognostic factors is also strongly encouraged.",

In several human cancers, higher numbers of CD20(+) TAB are associated with a favorable prognosis, whereas in human primary melanomas, this association is contentious. In this study, we determined the association of TAB numbers in cutaneous primary melanoma tissue samples and patients' overall survival. The CD20 immunohistochemistry on archival nonmetastasized and metastasized cutaneous primary melanoma tissues from 2 independent patient cohorts was performed. One cohort was used in class comparison for metastasis, the most important prognostic factor for overall survival, and the other cohort for a subsequent survival analysis. Survival association was further validated with RNA data from a third independent cohort. Whole tissue sections were read automatically via quantitative digital imaging and analysis. Survival data were analyzed by Cox proportional hazard modeling. We discovered that cutaneous primary melanomas without metastasis contain significantly more TAB than primary melanomas that had metastasized. At time of first diagnosis, a higher number of TAB is associated with a significantly better overall survival in patients with cutaneous primary melanomas of >1 mm Breslow depth. Also, higher CD20/CD19 tumor mRNA levels are correlated with a significantly better overall survival. Thus, our data support TAB numbers as a prognostic biomarker in cutaneous primary melanoma patients with a tumor of >1 mm Breslow depth.

In this article, we report the presence of MECA 79(+) blood vessels displaying all the phenotypic characteristics of HEVs in most of the 319 human primary solid tumors, including melanomas, breast, ovarian, colon, and lung carcinomas, analyzed. Tumor HEVs were specifically located within lymphocyte-rich areas, and their density within the tumor stroma was a strong predictor of infiltration by CD3(+) and CD8(+) T cells as well as B cells. Large-scale flow cytometric and quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analyses in freshly operated breast tumors revealed that high densities of tumor HEVs correlated with increased naive, central memory and activated effector memory T-cell infiltration and upregulation of genes related to T-helper 1 adaptive immunity and T-cell cytotoxicity. Finally, in a retrospective cohort of 146 invasive breast cancer patients, we found that high densities of tumor HEVs independently conferred a lower risk of relapse and significantly correlated with longer metastasis-free, disease-free, and overall survival rates.

Chimeras produced from these ES cells developed cancer with higher penetrance, shorter latency, and an expanded tumor spectrum when compared with the donor mouse model.

Ideally, tumor selectivity of these oncolytic viruses is already determined during viral cell binding and entry, which has not been reported for melanoma. We engineered an oncolytic measles virus entering melanoma cells through the high molecular weight melanoma-associated antigen (HMWMAA) and proved highly specific infection and spread in melanoma cells. We further enhanced this oncolytic virus by inserting the FCU1 gene encoding the yeast-derived prodrug convertases cytosine deaminase and uracil phosphoribosyltransferase. Combination treatment with armed and retargeted MV-FCU1-αHMWMAA and the prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) led to effective prodrug conversion to 5-fluorouracil, extensive cytotoxicity to melanoma cells, and excessive bystander killing of noninfected cells. Importantly, HMWMAA-retargeted MV showed antitumor activity in a human xenograft mouse model, which was further increased by the FCU1/5-FC prodrug activation system.

Established B16 melanoma in mice was treated with cytotoxic doses of cyclophosphamide in combination with an antibody targeting tyrosinase-related protein 1 (αTRP1), a native melanoma differentiation antigen. We find that Fcγ receptors are required for efficacy, showing that antitumor activity of combination therapy is immune mediated. Rag1(-/-) mice deficient in adaptive immunity are able to clear tumors, and thus innate immunity is sufficient for efficacy. Furthermore, previously treated wild-type mice are not significantly protected against tumor reinduction, as compared with mice inoculated with irradiated B16 alone, consistent with a primarily innate immune mechanism of action of chemo-immunotherapy. In contrast, mice deficient in both classical natural killer (NK) lymphocytes and nonclassical innate lymphocytes (ILC) due to deletion of the IL2 receptor common gamma chain IL2γc(-/-)) are refractory to chemo-immunotherapy. Classical NK lymphocytes are not critical for treatment, as depletion of NK1.1⁺ cells does not impair antitumor effect. Depletion of CD90⁺NK1.1⁻ lymphocytes, however, both diminishes therapeutic benefit and decreases accumulation of macrophages within the tumor. Tumor clearance during combination chemo-immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies against native antigen is mediated by the innate immune system. We highlight a novel potential role for CD90⁺NK1.1⁻ ILCs in chemo-immunotherapy.",

The effector cells should, therefore, not only exert cytotoxic activity but also home to and infiltrate the tumor site. Hence, monitoring of immune modulating therapies should not be restricted to the circulating pool of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) but also include tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), as well as the correlation of these findings to the clinical course. We report here on the longitudinal immunologic workup of a melanoma patient who developed remarkably potent ex vivo detectable antimelanoma cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) responses after vaccinations with autologous peptide-pulsed dendritic cells. Such potent CTL responses to multiple tumor antigens have, to the best of our knowledge, not been described previously in melanoma patients, neither spontaneously nor after any therapy. This patient first experienced a transient response to therapy but finally succumbed to disease progression and died. Progression was associated with the decline of the numbers of tumor-reactive T cells in circulation and at skin metastases in addition to the loss of MHC class I antigens. The immunologic analysis revealed that fully functional tumor-specific T cells were present in the peripheral blood of this patient during the phase of a relatively stable disease, and in situ tetramer staining demonstrated that these cells were also accumulated at cutaneous and visceral tumor sites. Furthermore, comparative clonotype mapping of PBMC and TIL depicted an overlapping TCR repertoire usage among these 2 compartments. Since strong CTL responses as observed in this patient are the goal of cancer vaccination but are so far only rarely observed, the thorough analysis of patients exhibiting either exceptional clinical and/or immunologic responses appears critical to understanding how vaccine therapies work and can be further improved.",

At B-scan and standardized A-scan echography, the mass was shown to be localized to the ciliary body, with characteristics of a malignant melanoma.

The purpose of this study was to investigate expression and targeting of gangliosides on canine melanoma. Using immunohistochemical methods, we analyzed the expression of disialogangliosides GD2 and GD3 on canine oral malignant melanomas with murine Mabs 14.G2a and R24 that recognize GD2 and GD3 disialogangliosides, respectively, on human tumors. We also assessed the ability of Mab 14.G2a (and its mouse-human chimera, ch 14.18) to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro against a canine malignant melanoma cell line with human recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) activated canine peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), or canine neutrophil effector cells. Our data show that Mabs 14.G2a and R24 recognized fresh frozen canine oral melanoma. Mabs 14.G2a or ch 14.18, or IL-2, potentiated lysis of the canine malignant melanoma cell line by canine PBL. The killing effect observed using the combination of either Mab with IL-2 was additive. Mab 14.G2a mediated potent ADCC of canine melanoma by canine neutrophils. These studies indicate that disialogangliosides are expressed on fresh canine melanoma cells. Mabs reactive with these antigens can target and trigger tumor killing by multiple canine effector populations and IL-2 can potentiate these effects by canine lymphocytes. Thus, canine oral malignant melanoma, a spontaneously occurring, metastatic cancer in the dog, may be a relevant animal model to investigate combination immunotherapy using antitumor Mab and IL-2.",

Ulceration of primary melanomas was associated with more proliferative tumors, tumor vessel invasion, and increased microvessel density. Infiltration of tumors with greater number of macrophages and gene expression pathways associated with wound healing and up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines suggests that ulceration is associated with tumor-related inflammation.

PD-1 inhibition on melanoma cells by RNAi, blocking antibodies, or mutagenesis of melanoma-PD-1 signaling motifs suppresses tumor growth in immunocompetent, immunocompromised, and PD-1-deficient tumor graft recipient mice. Conversely, melanoma-specific PD-1 overexpression enhances tumorigenicity, as does engagement of melanoma-PD-1 by its ligand, PD-L1, whereas melanoma-PD-L1 inhibition or knockout of host-PD-L1 attenuate growth of PD-1-positive melanomas. Mechanistically, the melanoma-PD-1 receptor modulates downstream effectors of mTOR signaling.

Recently, chemokines have been extensively related to cellular transformation, tumor growth, homing, and metastasis. CXCL1 and its mouse homologue MIP-2 have been shown to be involved in the process of tumor formation. When chemokines such as CXCL1 and CXCL8 (IL-8) become disregulated so that they are chronically expressed, tissue damage, angiogenesis, and tumorigenesis can follow. This up-regulation of chemokines has been attributed to constitutive activation of NF-kappaB. The constitutive NF-kappaB activation is an emerging hallmark in various types of tumors including breast, colon, pancreatic, ovarian, as well as melanoma. Previous findings from our laboratory and other laboratories have demonstrated the role of endogenous activation of NF-kappaB in association with enhanced metastatic potential of malignant melanoma cells and suggest that targeting NF-kappaB may have potential therapeutic effects in clinical trials. An important step in this direction would be to delineate the important intracellular pathways and upstream kinases involved in up-regulation of NF-kappaB in melanoma cells.

Suppression mediated by sorted ICOShigh and ICOSlow Treg was assessed in CFSE-based suppression assays with autologous CD4+CD25- responder cells (RC). Transwell inserts separating Treg from RC were used to evaluate suppression mechanisms used by Treg. ICOShigh or ICOSlow Treg were coincubated with RC+/-TCR and IL-2 stimulation.

To test the relevance of this hypothesis, we have taken advantage of the fact that spontaneous regression of human primary melanoma is thought to be the result of a successful peptide-specific cellular immune response in vivo. Immunohistochemical staining with anti-LMP2 and anti-LMP7 xenoantibodies showed a significantly higher expression of these immunoproteasome subunits in primary melanoma lesions exhibiting histological signs of tumour regression than in primary melanoma lesions without regression phenomena. In spontaneously regressing melanoma lesions, LMP2 and LMP7 expression was significantly associated with the presence of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes.

However, recent studies have questioned the validity of this approach. Using retroviral vector-producing cells (VPC) as a source for in vivo gene transfer, we evaluated the efficacy of in vivo transduction of malignant cells using three different tumor cell models: B16 murine and IIB-MEL-LES human melanomas and a C6 rat glioblastoma. In vitro studies showed a bystander effect only in C6 cells. In vivo studies showed an inhibition of tumor growth in the two melanoma models when tumor cells were coinjected with VPC-producing retroviral vectors carrying the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene, followed by GCV treatment; however, 100% of mice developed tumors in both models. Under similar experimental conditions, 70% (7 of 10) of syngeneic rats completely rejected stereotactically transferred C6 tumor cells; most of them (5 of 10) showed a prolonged survival. Treating established C6 tumors with VPC-producing retroviral vectors carrying the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene and GCV led to the cure of 33% (4 of 12) of the animals. Rats that rejected tumor growth developed an antitumor immune memory, leading to a rejection of a stereotactic contralateral challenge with parental cells. The immune infiltrate, which showed the presence of T lymphocytes, macrophages, and polymorphonuclear cells at the site of the first injection and mainly T lymphocytes and macrophages at the site of tumor challenge, strengthened the importance of the immune system in achieving complete tumor rejection.",

Some of the spindle cells had bizarre nuclei, whereas other spindle cells resembled normal fibroblasts. Melanin could not be demonstrated in any of the tumors by histochemical techniques. Electron microscopic examination of the spindle cells showed prominence of rough endoplasmic reticulum, which was dilated and filled with flocculent material and occasional collagen fibrils. The same cells contained aggregates of non-membrane-bound melanin granules and pre-melanosomes. Some cells also showed features of myofibroblasts. Immunoperoxidase staining with anti-S100 protein antibody demonstrated positivity of the spindle cells as well as of melanocytes in the basal layer of the epidermis.

        "Doc_abstract":"Cancer immunotherapy based on vaccination with defined tumor antigens has not yet shown strong clinical efficacy, despite promising results in preclinical models. This discrepancy might result from the fact that available preclinical models rely on transplantable tumors, which do not recapitulate the long-term host-tumor interplay that occurs in patients during progressive tumor development and results in tumor tolerance. To create a faithful preclinical model for cancer immunotherapy, we generated a transgenic mouse strain developing autologous melanomas expressing a defined tumor antigen recognized by T cells. We chose the antigen encoded by P1A, a well-characterized murine cancer germ line gene. To transform melanocytes, we aimed at simultaneously activating the Ras pathway and inactivating tumor suppressor Ink4a/Arf, thereby reproducing two genetic events frequently observed in human melanoma. The melanomas are induced by s.c. injection of 4-OH-tamoxifen (OHT). By activating a CreER recombinase expressed from a melanocyte-specific promoter, this treatment induces the loss of the conditional Ink4a/Arf gene in melanocytes. Because the CreER gene itself is also flanked by loxP sites, the activation of CreER also induces the deletion of its own coding sequence and thereby allows melanocyte-specific expression of genes H-ras and P1A, which are located downstream on the same transgene. All melanomas induced in those mice with OHT show activation of the Ras pathway and deletion of gene Ink4a/Arf. In addition, these melanomas express P1A and are recognized by P1A-specific T lymphocytes. This model will allow to characterize the interactions between the immune system and naturally occurring tumors and thereby to optimize immunotherapy approaches targeting a defined tumor antigen.",

        "Doc_abstract":"A major prerequisite for the success of tumor vaccines is their effective uptake by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and transport of these APCs to the draining lymph nodes, where the processed and presented tumor-associated antigens activate tumor-specific naive T cells. We previously suggested that the immunogenicity of autologus tumor vaccines in humans may be augmented by engineering vaccinating tumor cell membranes to express alpha-galactosyl (alpha-gal) epitopes (i.e., Galalpha1,3Galbeta1,4GlcNAc-R). Subsequent in situ binding of natural anti-Gal IgG molecules to these epitopes would result in the formation of immune complexes that target tumor vaccines for uptake by APCs, via the interaction of the Fc portion of anti-Gal with Fcgamma receptors on APCs. This hypothesis was tested in a unique experimental animal model of knockout mice for alpha1,3galactosyltransferase (alpha1,3GT) and the mouse melanoma B16-BL6 (referred to here as BL6). Like humans, these mice lack alpha-gal epitopes and produce anti-GaL BL6 melanoma cels are highly tumorigenic, and like human tumor cells, they lack alpha-gal epitopes. Expression of alpha-gal epitopes on these melanoma cells was achieved by stable transfection with alpha,3GT cDNA. The transfected melanoma cells (termed BL6alphaGT) express approximately 2 x 10(6) alpha-gal epitopes per cell and readily form immune complexes with anti-Gal. Vaccination of the mice with 2 x 10(6) irradiated melanoma cells that express alpha-gal epitopes, followed by challenge with 0.5 x 10(6) live parental melanoma cells, resulted in protection for at least 2 months (i.e, no tumor growth) in one-third of the mice, whereas all mice immunized with irradiated parental melanoma cells developed tumors 21-26 days post-challenge. The proportion of protected mice doubled when the mice were immunized twice with irradiated melanoma cells expressing alpha-gal epitopes and challenged with 0.2 x 10(6) live BL6 cells. Histological studies on the developing tumors in challenged mice that were immunized with melanoma cells expressing alpha-gal epitopes demonstrated extensive infiltration of T lymphocytes and macrophages, whereas no mononuclear cell infiltrates were observed in tumors of mice immunized with parental tumor cells. Overall, these studies imply that immunization of alpha1,3GT knockout mice with BL6 melanoma cells that express alpha-gal epitopes elicits, in a proportion of the population, protective immune response against the same tumor lacking such epitopes. These studies further suggest that similar immunization of cancer patients with autologous tumor vaccines that are engineered to express alpha-gal epitopes may increase the immune response to autologous tumor-associated antigens and, thus, may elicit immune-mediated destruction of metastatic cells expressing these antigens.",

The intrinsic resistance of uveal melanoma to conventional systemic chemotherapy has led researchers to evaluate new approaches. Molecular biology and a better knowledge of cancer cells allowed the development of target therapies: these refer to drugs designed to interact with a specific molecular pathway known to have a critical role in tumor growth or progression. Several drugs, such as bevacizumab, imatinib and MEK-inhibitors, are currently under investigation as single agents or in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs for the treatment of metastatic uveal melanoma.

        "Doc_abstract":"The analysis of gene expression patterns in cancers has improved the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the process of metastatic progression. However, the acquisition of invasive behavior in melanoma is poorly understood. In melanoma, components of the immune system can contribute to tumor progression, and inflammatory cells can influence almost all aspects of cancer progression, including metastasis. Recent studies have attributed an important role to B-1 cells, a subset of B lymphocytes, in melanoma progression. In vitro interactions between B16 melanoma cells and B-1 lymphocytes lead to increased B16 cell metastatic potential, but the molecular changes induced by B-1 lymphocytes on B16 cells have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we used a microarray approach to assess the gene expression profile of B16 melanoma cells following contact with B-1 lymphocytes (B16B1). The microarray analysis identified upregulation in genes involved with metastatic progression, such as ctss, ccl5, cxcl2 and stat3. RT-qPCR confirmed this increase in mRNA expression in B16B1 samples. As previous studies have indicated that the ERK1/2 MAPK cascade is activated in melanoma cells following contact with B-1 lymphocytes, RT-qPCR was performed with RNA from melanoma cells before and after contacting B-1 cells and untreated or treated with ERK phosphorylation inhibitors. The results showed that the expression of stat3, ctss and cxcl2 increased in B16B1 but decreased following ERK1/2 MAPK inhibition. Ccl5 gene expression increased after contacting B-1 cells and was maintained at the same level following inhibitor treatment. Stat3 was verified and validated at the protein level by Western blot analysis. STAT3 expression was also significantly increased in B16B1, suggesting that this pathway can also contribute to the increased metastatic phenotype observed in our model. These results indicated that B-1 cells induce important global gene expression changes in B16 melanoma cells. We also evaluated the relationship of some of the genes identified as differentially expressed and the ERK1/2 MAPK cascade. This work may have important implications for understanding the role of B-1 lymphocytes and the ERK/MAPK cascade in the metastatic process. ",

There has been much less progress in identifying the tumor antigens on murine tumors that are recognized by T cells, and this has restricted the development of preclinical animal models for immunotherapy. The authors previously described a method for generating tumor-reactive T cells from murine tumors (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes) that are CD8+ T cells recognizing autologous tumor and that can inhibit established tumor on adoptive transfer. Here the authors show that the envelope protein of an endogenous murine retrovirus of the AKV family, found in the germline of the C57BL/6 mouse, is recognized by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from two histologically different tumors syngeneic to that mouse strain. Furthermore, the authors identify the specific 9-amino acid peptide from the p15E transmembrane component of this envelope protein that is recognized in the context of major histocompatibility complex Kb, show that it is naturally presented and recognized on several other H-2b tumors, and that cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific for this epitope are therapeutic for these antigen-expressing tumors on adoptive transfer.",

We studied 395 subjects from 16 American CDKN2A families. Major melanoma risk factors were assessed by clinical examination or questionnaire; MC1R was sequenced. Odds ratios were estimated by unconditional and conditional logistic regression models. We examined the distribution of MC1R variants and median ages at melanoma diagnosis in multiple primary melanoma (MPM) and single primary melanoma (SPM) patients. Presence of multiple MC1R variants was significantly associated with melanoma, even after adjustment for major melanoma risk factors. All 40 MPM patients had at least one MC1R variant; 65% of MPM patients versus only 17% of SPM patients had at least two MC1R variants (P < 0.0001). For all 69 melanoma patients combined, as well as the 40 MPM patients, there was a statistically significant decrease in median age at diagnosis as numbers of MC1R variants increased (P = 0.010 and P = 0.008, respectively). In contrast, no significant reduction in age at melanoma diagnosis was observed for SPM patients (P = 0.91).

MITF-M regulates the expression of melanocyte differentiation genes such as MLANA, tyrosinase and gp100, which encode antigens recognized on melanoma cells by autologous cytolytic T lymphocytes.

Elucidating the molecular and genetic changes that take place during the metastatic process has led to a better understanding of why melanoma is so metastatic. Herein, we describe the unique features that distinguish melanoma from other solid tumors and contribute to the malignant phenotype of melanoma cells. For example, although melanoma cells are highly antigenic, they are extremely efficient at evading host immune response. Melanoma cells share numerous cell surface molecules with vascular cells, are highly angiogenic, are mesenchymal in nature, and possess a higher degree of 'stemness' than do other solid tumors. Finally, analysis of melanoma mutations has revealed that the gene expression profile of malignant melanoma is different from that of other cancers. Elucidating these molecular and genetic processes in highly metastatic melanoma can lead to the development of improved treatment and individualized therapy options. ",

Sixty percent of all lymphocytes were recovered in this monocyte-depleted lymphocyte fraction (LF). In contrast, with the corresponding unfractionated lymphocytes (UL) the LF cells were not spontaneously cytotoxic on T24 bladder carcinoma, NKI-1, NKI-7, NKI-8, NKI-10 melanoma, and MC-1 mammary carcinoma cell line cells and target cells derived from two short-term melanona cultures (Me 215 and Me 223). SC of the LF could be restored by reconstitution with autologous monocytes, which were obtained > 80% pure in the same velocity sedimentation procedure. Addition of 4-8% monocytes was sufficient to restore the SC of the LF to the level achieved with the corresponding UL, whereas maximal induction of SC was observed after addition of 8-16% monocytes. Higher numbers of monocytes had suboptimal effects. SC of the LF could also be restored by monocyte culture supernatants. The spontaneous cytotoxic effector cells were characterized as non-E rosette-forming, membrane sIg-negative Fc-receptor-bearing lymphocytes, a proportion of which probably also bear C3-receptors. Since the LF was not spontaneously cytotoxic, in spite of the presence of Fc-receptor bearing lymphocytes, it is concluded that monocyte help, mediated via soluble factors, is required. Evidence is presented that the lack of SC by the LF might be attributable to the failure of these cells to make appropriate contact with the target cells. LF/target cell contact followed by target cell kill occurred after addition of monocytes. Effector/target cell contacts, artificially established by agglutinins, did not result in target cell kill. Thus the effector/target cell contacts observed in the presence of monocytes suggest recognition of particular membraner determinants involved in SC. An identical requirement for monocytes was observed with LF cells from 5 stage 1 and 5 stage 11 melanoma patients tested for SC against both melanoma and non-melanoma target cells. This indicates that either the cytotoxicity against melanoma cells with lymphocytes from melanoma patients is of the same nature as the SC of lymphocytes from healthy donors, or that specific melanoma-associated cellular cytotoxicioty also requires monocyte help.",

Recent studies show that Microphthalmia Transcription Factor (MITF) has high sensitivity (88-100%) and specificity for metastatic melanoma. We are reporting here three cases of high grade tumors that were studied by a comprehensive immunohistochemical panel including cytokeratins, S100, HMB-45, Melan A, Tyrosinase, and MITF. All three tumors were also analyzed for the presence of BRAF mutations. All three metastatic tumors were negative for S100, Melan A, HMB-45 and Tyrosinase but positive for MITF. Subsequent to the diagnoses, previously existing or concurrent primary melanomas were identified in 2 of the 3 cases. Interestingly, S100, Melan A, and HMB-45 were positive in the primary tumors. No BRAF (V600E) mutations were identified in the three metastatic melanomas and CD 117 (c-kit) was positive in one of the cases. In summary, our experience shows that MITF can be a valuable adjunct in the diagnosis of metastatic tumors that are suspicious for melanoma but negative for other melanoma markers. ",

Meanwhile, the expression of β-catenin in HVJ-E treated murine melanoma cells was detected. In addition, HVJ-E was intratumorally injected into the melanoma on C57BL/6 mice, and the immune cells, CTL response and tumor volume were analyzed.;HVJ-E injected into B16F10 melanoma obviously inhibited the growth of the tumor and prolonged the survival time of the tumor-bearing mice. Profiles of cytokines secreted by dendritic cells (DCs) after HVJ-E stimulation showed that the number of cytokines released was significantly higher than that elicited by PBS (1P<0.05). The co-stimulation-related molecules on DCs were comparable to those stimulated by LPS. Immunohistochemical examinations demonstrated the repression of β-catenin in B16F10 melanoma cells after HVJ-E treatment.

Furthermore, the mRNA expression level of β-catenin in the HVJ-E injected tumors was also down-regulated. In addition, B16F10-specific CTLs were induced significantly after HVJ-E was injected into the tumor-bearing mice.;This is the first report to show the effective inhibition of melanoma tumors by HVJ-E alone and the mechanism through which it induces antitumor immune responses and regulates important signal pathways for melanoma invasion.

Natural killer (NK) cells, which were detected by anti-NK1.1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), increased in the peritoneal exudate cells after an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection with syngeneic B16 melanoma cells. Furthermore, a concurrent i.p. injection with OK432 efficiently sustained the locally infiltrating NK cells. The OK432 treatment also sustained the augmented NK and lymphokine-activated killer activities in the peritoneal exudate cells. This treatment also increased the ability of the locally infiltrating NK cells to produce interferon gamma in response to the tumor cells. In addition, the concurrent i.p. injection with OK432 in combination with the tumor cells enhanced the capacity of the spleen cells to turn into anti-(B16 melanoma) cytotoxic T lymphocytes after in vitro restimulation. This augmenting effect of OK432 was dependent on NK cells. Moreover, the concurrent injection with OK432 at the time of anti-tumor vaccination significantly enhanced the protective immunity against B16 melanoma at the rechallenge.

The patient was admitted for abdominal pain and obstipation. Following an overall inspection, the patient was subjected to surgical treatment and a small intestinal tumor was removed. The histopathological examination of the lesion revealed a diffuse neoplastic infiltration involving the entire thickness of the intestinal mucosa. The neoplastic cells exhibited marked atypia, pleomorphism and immunoreactivity to S-100, anti-melanoma antibody (HMB-45) and melanocyte/melanoma tumor antigen (Melan-A). The diagnosis of primary small intestinal melanoma was confirmed. The patient underwent an uneventful postoperative recovery and was administered adjuvant therapy. At the 3-month, 6-month and 1-year follow-up, the patient remained alive, with no signs of tumor metastasis and/or recurrence. In this case, the patient was repetitively assessed by abdominal computed tomography (CT) and plain film, confirming that the obstruction was caused by small intestinal melanoma.

Microscopic examination indicated that tumorous lesions were composed mostly of melanocytes and numerous melanophages and that component cells manifested a remarkable cellular atypia with anisocytosis and anisokarinosis. Pathological examination of lesions corresponding to earlier stages of the tumors disclosed that tumor formation and its related melanogenesis occurred in close topographical association with apocrine sweat glands, but not at the dermal-epidermal junction. Larger nodules of the tumors were often composed of a concentric deposition of cell layers, each being separated by dermal components from the epidermis.

In the present study, the migration of a melanoma patient's CTL toward autologous tumor cells has been studied in a novel three-dimensional organotypic melanoma culture. In this model, CTL migrated toward tumor cells, resulting in tumor cell apoptosis. CTL migration was mediated by the CC chemokine receptor (CCR)4 expressed by the CTL and the CC chemokine ligand (CCL)2 secreted by the tumor cells, as evidenced by blockage of CTL migration by CCL2 or antibodies to CCL2 or CCR4. These results were confirmed in a Transwell migration assay in which the CTL actively migrated toward isolated CCL2 and migration was inhibited by anti-CCR4 antibody. These studies, together with previous studies in mice indicating regression of CCL2-transduced tumor cells, suggest that CCL2 may be useful as an immunotherapeutic agent for cancer patients.",

Its potential role as an antitumor agent has been suggested by its demonstrated activity in a variety of tumor models. The mechanism of antitumor activity has been proposed to be its enhancement of cytotoxic T-cell function. In the current work we demonstrate clear antitumor activity for this cytokine in a nonimmunogenic tumor system. B16 melanoma cells transfected with the human IL-6 complementary DNA demonstrated slower tumor growth in vivo. Tumors that developed from these cells had a prominent stromal matrix, an easily recognized infiltration of inflammatory cells, fewer mitotic figures, and fewer blood vessels. These in vivo findings corresponded with a greater adhesion of the IL-6-transfected B16 cells to stromal matrix proteins (laminin, fibronectin, and vitronectin) and a less prominent vascular response in an intradermal angiogenesis assay. Therefore, we propose that with weakly antigenic tumors, such as B16 melanoma, IL-6 may mediate important antitumor responses by nonspecific proinflammatory mechanisms.",

Previous studies showed that glycoprotein 100 (gp100), tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TRP1), and tyrosinase-related protein 2 (TRP2) are promising immunogens for melanoma immunotherapy. In this study, we administered these three melanoma-associated antigens via lentiviral vectors (termed LV-3Ag) and found that this multi-antigen vaccine strategy markedly increased functional T-cell infiltration into tumors and generated protective and therapeutic antitumor immunity. We also engineered a novel immunotoxin, αFAP-PE38, capable of targeting fibroblast activation protein (FAP)-expressing fibroblasts within the tumor stroma. When combined with αFAP-PE38, LV-3Ag exhibited greatly enhanced antitumor effects on tumor growth in an established B16 melanoma model. The mechanism of action underlying this combination treatment likely modulates the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment and, consequently, activates cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells capable of specifically recognizing and destroying tumor cells. Taken together, these results provide a strong rationale for combining an immunotoxin with cancer vaccines for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer. ",

Because TGFβ1 is a pleiotropic cytokine involved not only in physiologic processes but also in cancer development, we analyzed in A375 human melanoma cells, the effect of TGFβ1 on monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) expression, two known factors responsible for melanoma progression. TGFβ1 increased the expression of MCP-1 and IL-10 in A375 cells, an effect mediated by the cross-talk between Smad, PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/AKT, and BRAF-MAPK (mitogen activated protein kinase) signaling pathways. Supernatants from TGFβ1-treated A375 cells enhanced MCP-1-dependent migration of monocytes, which, in turn, expressed high levels of TGF,β1, bFGF, and VEGF mRNA. Moreover, these supernatants also inhibited functional properties of dendritic cells through IL-10-dependent mechanisms. When using in vitro, the TGFβ1-blocking peptide P144, TGFβ1-dependent Smad3 phosphorylation, and expression of MCP-1 and IL-10 were inhibited. In vivo, treatment of A375 tumor-bearing athymic mice with P144 significantly reduced tumor growth, associated with a lower macrophage infiltrate and decreased intratumor MCP-1 and VEGF levels, as well as angiogenesis. Finally, in C57BL/6 mice with B16-OVA melanoma tumors, when administered with immunotherapy, P144 decreased tumor growth and intratumor IL-10 levels, linked to enhanced activation of dendritic cells and natural killer cells, as well as anti-OVA T-cell responses.

Hence, the aim of the present study was to determine the effects of radiotherapy on the growth of B16F10 melanomas as well as on the tumor and systemic expression of substance P. In vivo exposure of tumor-bearing C5BL/6 mice to ionizing radiation (45 Gy administered in three fractions) arrested tumor growth for three weeks and induced 3-fold increases in survival, as well as decreasing substance P levels in primary tumors and the surrounding skin. Although radiotherapy was applied locally (1 x 1 cm) at the mid-flank region of the animal, it also induced systemic changes in the levels of substance P. Specifically, radiotherapy decreased substance P levels in skin distant from the radiation field as well as in the lungs and adrenals. In order to understand the significance of this effect, B16F10 cells and cells made from metastatic lesions (B16LNAD cells) were treated with substance P. Substance P inhibited the growth of B16F10 and B16LNAD cells and further potentiated the inhibitory effects of radiotherapy. These findings demonstrate for the first time that substance P inhibits melanoma growth, and that radiotherapy-induced decreases in substance P levels may underlie the radio-resistance of melanomas.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The detection of tumor-specific mRNA transcripts in the blood of patients by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR has been used as a very sensitive technique for determining systemically disseminated tumor cells. On the basis of previous expression studies, we aimed to trace melanoma cells in the blood of melanoma patients by RT-PCR of melanoma-inhibitory activity (MIA) mRNA. To detect sensitively MIA transcripts in total RNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we established a sensitive PCR-ELISA system. With this assay, we detected one melanoma cell in 2 ml of blood by a single round of 32 PCR cycles. A total of 295 PBMC samples isolated from 166 patients with melanocytic tumors were tested with the MIA RT-PCR-ELISA: (a) 58 patients (99 samples) with malignant melanomas in stage I; (b) 49 patients (65 samples) with malignant melanomas in stage II; and (c) 47 patients (116 samples) with metastasized melanomas (stages III and IV), with an additional 12 patients (15 samples) with benign melanocytic nevi. Forty-four (26.8%) of 164 samples isolated from patients with melanomas in stages I and II were positive for MIA mRNA; in stages III/IV, 33 (28.4%) of 116 samples of patients, irrespective of clinically evident disease, were positive. Eleven (84.6%) of 13 PBMC samples from patients with metastasized melanoma and clinically evident disease without treatment were MIA mRNA-positive in contrast to only 19 (25.7%) of 74 samples isolated from patients in stage IV with metastasis during chemotherapy. Furthermore, none of the 16 PBMC samples of patients in stage IV without clinically detectable metastases at that time point during chemotherapy was MIA mRNA-positive. Interestingly, of the 44 positive samples (26.8%) isolated from patients with melanomas in stages I and II, 20 were still positive when retested after complete excision of the tumor. Our results reveal that amplification of MIA mRNA from the PBMCs of patients with malignant melanomas by PCR-ELISA provides a useful means to detect tumor cells in the systemic blood circulation. A correlation between positive blood samples and tumor burden in stages III and IV was detected, and, in addition, a significant effect of chemotherapy with respect to the reduction of the number of systemically spread tumor cells was observed. However, MIA amplification seems to be of little value as a surrogate marker for clinical staging or the detection of metastatic disease.",

The antigens identified in mouse model systems appear, with one exception, to represent the products of mutated genes. In contrast, most of the antigens recognized by human tumor-reactive T cells reported to date appear to represent the products of non-mutated genes. Here we report the isolation of a cDNA clone encoding beta-catenin, which was shown to be recognized by the tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) 1290, a HLA-A24 restricted melanoma-specific CTL line from patient 888. The cDNA clone, which was isolated from the autologous melanoma cDNA library, differed by a single base pair from the published beta-catenin sequence, resulting in a change from a serine to a phenylalanine residue at position 37. Normal tissues from this patient did not express the altered sequence, nor did 12 allogeneic melanomas, indicating that this represented a unique mutation in this patient's melanoma. A peptide corresponding to the sequence between amino acids 29 and 37 of the mutant gene product was identified as the T cell epitope recognized by TIL 1290. The observation that HLA-A24 binding peptides contain an aromatic or hydrophobic residue at position 9 suggested that the change at position 37 may have generated a peptide (SYLDSGIHF) which was capable of binding to HLA-A24, and a competitive binding assay confirmed this hypothesis. The beta-catenin protein has been shown previously to be involved in cell adhesion mediated through the cadherin family of cell surface adhesion molecules. The high frequency of mutations found in members of cellular adhesion complexes in a variety of cancers suggests that these molecules may play a role in development of the malignant phenotype.",

One nonresponder demonstrated complete tumor regression within 1 year of treatment. Of four assessable RCC patients, two experienced a minor response (MR) and two showed NR. All TIL cultures showed comparably high cytotoxic activity as determined by antibody-redirected lysis (ARL).

Here, we examined whether the same \"intracerebral immunotherapy\" strategy could be applied to the treatment of metastatic brain tumors.;Mice with both i.c. and s.c. melanomas were injected intratumorally with CNT-CpG into either location. Antitumor responses were assessed by flow cytometry, bioluminescent imaging, and animal survival.;When given s.c., CNT-CpG response was mostly local, and it only modestly inhibited the growth of i.c. melanomas. However, i.c. CNT-CpG abrogated the growth of not only brain but also s.c. tumors. Furthermore, compared with s.c. injections, i.c. CNT-CpG elicited a stronger inflammatory response that resulted in more potent antitumor cytotoxicity and improved in vivo trafficking of effector cells into both i.c. and s.c. tumors. To investigate factors that accounted for these observations, CNT-CpG biodistribution and cellular inflammatory responses were examined in both tumor locations. Intracranial melanomas retained the CNT-CpG particles longer and were infiltrated by Toll-like receptor (TLR-9)-positive microglia. In contrast, myeloid-derived suppressive cells were more abundant in s.c. tumors. Although depletion of these cells before s.c. CNT-CpG therapy enhanced its cytotoxic responses, antitumor responses to brain melanomas were unchanged.;These findings suggest that intracerebral CNT-CpG immunotherapy is more effective than systemic therapy in generating antitumor responses that target both brain and systemic melanomas.",

Current clinical and pathologic categories with the reported genetic abnormalities were related to the latest information on pigment biology. The data extracted were used to develop a conceptual framework on the pathogenesis of melanoma; the generated model was then evaluated and used to suggest potential therapeutic approaches.;(1) Melanoma is not genetically homogeneous, and the existing differences between the pathologic categories, particularly in areas such as type of growth phase (radial vs vertical growth), total vertical dimension, ulceration of primary tumor, and metastatic process, have profound prognostic and therapeutic implications. (2) Chromosomal aberrations and gene mutations are found in sporadic and familial melanomas; among the most important are those affecting the 9p21, which contains the p16 locus, a site known to be critical for normal progression of the cell cycle. Aberrant p16 expression is associated with more aggressive behavior. (3) Melanoma cells possess a remarkable repertoire of biosynthetic capacities represented by the production of hormones, growth factors, and their receptors that may sustain and accelerate tumor development and progression. For example, expression of the tumoral products alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and adrenocorticotropic hormone is regulated in vitro by ultraviolet light, a known carcinogen.

Three CTL lines, clonal or highly oligoclonal in their TCR composition, and two CTL clones were selected for HLA class I-restricted lysis of the autologous tumor and then tested for the recognition of HLA-A3+ and HLA-A3- normal or neoplastic cells of the melanocyte lineage. One CTL recognized a unique HLA-A3.1-restricted Ag expressed only by the autologous tumors, while all the other CTLs defined three HLA-A3.1 epitopes shared by melanomas, but not by melanocytes. Moreover, the epitopes of two CTL lines with different specificity were reconstituted by nonoverlapping fractions of HLA-A3+ melanoma-derived peptides resolved by reverse phase-HPLC, indicating that distinct naturally processed peptides were specifically recognized on melanoma cells in association with HLA-A3.1 molecules.

Most Dutch melanoma families segregate for a unique founder mutation (p16-Leiden), encoding a truncated nonfunctional p16 protein. The highly variable risk for p16-Leiden carriers to develop melanoma suggests a role for other genetic and/or environmental factors. We hypothesized that a 9p21 gene other than CDKN2A may be relevant in the remaining 9p21-linked melanoma families without p16 mutations but may also act as a risk modifier in p16-Leiden carriers. Haplotype analysis for 9p21 was performed using microsatellite markers in six p16-Leiden families originating from a founder population. p16-Leiden carriers in two families shared an unexpectedly large founder haplotype ( approximately 20-cM) around CDKN2A, mostly in proximal direction. Melanoma-positive p16-Leiden carriers from these families showed this extensive proximal haplotype compared with melanoma-negative p16-Leiden carriers from the same families. Additional p16-Leiden families less heavily affected with melanoma showed shorter haplotypes sharing, excluding the region proximally of CDKN2A. The presence of a gene involved in melanoma susceptibility proximal of CDKN2A is corroborated by somatic deletions of 9p in tumors, which frequently do not include CDKN2A but a more proximal chromosomal area instead. Our results provide a candidate region for further gene mapping in p16-negative 9p21-linked melanoma families and guide the search for risk modifiers in melanoma development.",

Cells expressing IFN-alpha were injected into syngeneic C57BL/6 mice and the mice were monitored for tumor development. Secretion of IFN-alpha by B16 melanoma cells completely abrogated their tumorigenicity in syngeneic mice. LFN-alpha-secreting cells also abrogated the tumorigenicity of IFN-gamma-secreting and TNF-alpha-secreting cells when injected in combination whereas cells secreting either IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha grow progressively in mice when injected alone. Moreover, protected animals developed significant immunity against subsequent challenge with parental cells. Injection of parental cells and IFN-alpha-secreting cells together in a mixed tumor transplantation assay resulted in a significant reduction of tumorigenicity of the parental cells. Histopathological studies of the tissues from the injection site of the mice inoculated with a combination of parental and B16.IFN-alpha cells revealed the existence of a massive cellular infiltrate composed of lymphocytes and granulocytes at an early stage (7-11 days). In the later stages (22 days), no recognizable tumor tissue was detected. Injection of irradiated IFN-alpha-secreting cells in the mice carrying an established tumor completely prevented tumor development in 80% of the treated mice when injection was performed on the same side as the tumors. Injection of irradiated IFN-alpha-secreting cells in the contralateral site showed much less effect on the established tumor. Systemic antitumor effects on the established tumor can be enhanced by using a combination of irradiated IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma secreting cells as a vaccinating inoculum.",

ADO inhibition in melanoma murine models limits tumor metastases and restores anti-tumor immune responses. This work investigates the expression and function of ectoenzymes in primary human melanoma cell lines. All of latter cells expressed CD38, CD39, CD73, and CD203a/PC-1, and produced ADO from AMP and NAD(+ )T cell proliferation. Accordingly, phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein, p38 and Stat1 was lower in activated memory cells than in naïve CD4(+) T lymphocytes. Melanoma cells also inhibited proliferation of naïve, memory and -to a lesser extent- of effector CD8(+) T cells. These different inhibitory effects correlated with distinct patterns of expression of the ADO receptor A2a and A2b.

The importance of immunohistochemistry in diagnosis of the primary tumor and in early identification of metastases in lymphatic nodes is enormous; however melanoma phenotype is frequently variable and thus several markers must be employed simultaneously. The purposes of this study are to describe changes of phenotype of malignant melanoma in vitro and in vivo and to investigate whether changes of environmental factors mimicking natural conditions affect the phenotype of melanoma cells and can revert the typical in vitro loss of diagnostic markers. The influence of microenvironment was studied by means of immunocytochemistry on co-cultures of melanoma cells with melanoma-associated fibroblast and/or in conditioned media. The markers typical for melanoma (HMB45, Melan-A, Tyrosinase) were lost in malignant cells isolated from malignant effusion; however, tumor metastases shared identical phenotype with primary tumor (all markers positive). The melanoma cell lines also exerted reduced phenotype in vitro. The only constantly present diagnostic marker observed in our experiment was S100 protein and, in lesser extent, also Nestin. The phenotype loss was reverted under the influence of melanoma-associated fibroblast and/or both types of conditioned media. Loss of some markers of melanoma cell phenotype is not only of diagnostic significance, but it can presumably also contribute to biological behavior of melanoma. The presented study shows how the conditions of cultivation of melanoma cells can influence their phenotype.

The linear-quadratic (LQ) and modified linear quadratic (MLQ) models were used separately to evaluate the therapeutic outcome of a series of single fraction regimens that employed grid therapy to treat both acute and late responding melanomas of varying sizes. The dose prescription point was at the center of the tumor volume. Dose sizes ranging from 1 to 30 Gy at 100% dose line were modeled. Tumors were either touching the skin surface or having their centers at a depth of 3 cm. The equivalent uniform dose (EUD) to the melanoma cells and the therapeutic ratio (TR) were defined by comparing grid therapy with the traditional open debulking field. The clinical outcomes from recent reports were used to verify the authors' model.;Dose profiles at different depths and 3D dose distributions in a series of 3D melanomas treated with grid therapy were obtained. The EUDs and TRs for all sizes of 3D tumors involved at different doses were derived through the LQ and MLQ models, and a practical equation was derived. The EUD was only one fifth of the prescribed dose. The TR was dependent on the prescribed dose and on the LQ parameters of both the interspersed cancer and normal tissue cells. The results from the LQ model were consistent with those of the MLQ model. At 20 Gy, the EUD and TR by the LQ model were 2.8% higher and 1% lower than by the MLQ, while at 10 Gy, the EUD and TR as defined by the LQ model were only 1.4% higher and 0.8% lower, respectively. The dose volume histograms of grid therapy for a 10 cm tumor showed different dosimetric characteristics from those of conventional radiotherapy. A significant portion of the tumor volume received a very large dose in grid therapy, which ensures significant tumor cell killing in these regions. Conversely, some areas received a relatively small dose, thereby sparing interspersed normal cells and increasing radiation tolerance. The radiobiology modeling results indicated that grid therapy could be useful for treating acutely responding melanomas infiltrating radiosensitive normal tissues. The theoretical model predictions were supported by the clinical outcomes.;Grid therapy functions by selectively killing infiltrating tumor cells and concomitantly sparing interspersed normal cells. The TR depends on the radiosensitivity of the cell population, dose, tumor size, and location. Because the volumes of very high dose regions are small, the LQ model can be used safely to predict the clinical outcomes of grid therapy. When treating melanomas with a dose of 15 Gy or higher, single fraction grid therapy is clearly advantageous for sparing interspersed normal cells. The existence of a threshold fraction dose, which was found in the authors' theoretical simulations, was confirmed by clinical observations.",

The differential diagnosis between a melanoma and a nevus is sometimes difficult from a histopathologic point of view and could require ancillary diagnostic tools. Recently, both fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and p16-Ki67-HMB45 combined immunohistochemistry have been proposed as examples of ancillary diagnostic methods to help classify melanocytic tumors as benign or malignant. In this study, we compare FISH and p16-Ki-67-HMB45 immunohistochemistry in a set of melanomas and nevi. A total of 101 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumor samples (44 melanomas and 57 nevi) were analyzed using FISH for chromosomes 6, 8, 9, and 11 and p16-Ki-67-HMB45 immunohistochemistry. Any chromosomal imbalances and/or a p16-Ki-67-HMB45 immunohistochemistry combined score of 4 or higher were considered to reflect a \"favor\" malignant tumor. Using FISH, 42 out of 44 melanomas presented at least 1 chromosomal imbalance, whereas 2 melanomas and all nevi did not. Each melanoma, including 6 challenging tumors, had a p16-Ki-67-HMB45 immunohistochemistry combined score of 4 or higher and every nevus had a score inferior to 4. This reflects an excellent strength of agreement between FISH, immunohistochemistry, and definitive histopathologic diagnosis in our tumor set.

The five-year survival rate is reduced from 80% for non-ulcerated melanomas to 55% in the presence of ulceration for Stage I melanoma patients and from 53 to 12% for Stage II melanoma patients (P less than 0.001). As a group, ulcerated lesions are thicker and more likely to have a nodular growth pattern. However, survival rates were still worse for ulcerated melanomas when matched with nonulcerated lesions for thickness and stage of disease. The width but not the depth of surface ulceration significantly correlated with survival. The median ulcer depth was 0.08 mm (range 0.01-1.2 mm). In those few lesions with ulcer craters more than 0.2 mm in depth, the melanomas were so thick they had the same poor prognosis regardless of whether thickness was measured to the base of the ulcer or to the top of the lesion. The Breslow microstaging method of measuring thickness is therefore a valid prognostic indicator, even for ulcerated lesions. The incidence of ulceration for the entire patient group ranged from 12.5% for melanomas less than 0.76 mm thickness to 72.5% for melanomas greater than 4.0 mm thick (P of correlation = 0.0001); from 12% for Level II invasion to 63% for Level V lesions (P = 0.005); from 23% for superficial spreading growth patterns to 49% for nodular and 74% for polypoid lesions (P = 0.0001); and from 27% for lesions with a heavy lymphocyte infiltration to 60% for minimal or absent host response (P = 0.005). There was no significant correlation with anatomic location, pigmentation of the melanomas, or with the patient's age and sex. Since ulceration appears to have such an important influence on survival rates, this parameter should be considered as a stratification criterion in clinical trials and accounted for when analyzing results of melanoma treatment.",

Melanomas of the eye have the advantage of growing in the special environment of an immune privileged site and it has long been shown, that the special immunosuppressive properties of the intraocular microenvironment are strongly mediated by cytokines, especially transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Here, we sought to investigate the presence of TGF-beta in surgically removed uveal melanoma specimens using immunohistochemical methods to verify possible autocrine mechanisms. Immunocytochemistry for pan-TGF-beta and TGF-beta(2) was performed on 13 melanoma specimens using an alkaline phosphatase labeling procedure. Melanocytic origin of the tumors was confirmed by HMB-45 staining. All tissue samples exhibited positive staining using either pan-TGF-beta or TGF-beta(2) antibody regardless of cell-type, size of the tumor, or tumor location. The intensity of staining did not vary significantly within a given tumor. All tumors stained positive against the HMB-45 antibody. Many cytokines have been found to act on melanoma tumors. The presence of the TGF-beta(2) isoform in all specimens points to progressive tumor-growth as has been shown for melanomas of the skin. Based on our immunohistochemical findings and the immunosuppressive properties of TGF-beta, we suppose that ocular melanomas should be able to create their own immunosuppressive environment even in the uvea, which might be a non-privileged site.",

Splenocyte cytotoxicity assays against B16 melanoma cells [as cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity] and P815 cells [as natural killer (NK) activity] were performed. IL-10 and interferon-γ concentrations were measured. An in vivo subcutaneous B16 melanoma growth model was performed in B6 mice and treated with iPSC-conditioned medium. The lymphocyte subpopulation depletion test was performed to determine effectors against B16 melanoma cells. We found that unstimulated splenocytes had little cytotoxic activity. Without tumor cells, mIL-2 could augment iPSC-conditioned medium-treated CTL and NK activities (P<0.01). With irradiated tumor cells, mIL-2 treatment of splenocytes could not enhance CTL or NK activity, but iPSC-conditioned medium could enhance CTL and NK activity (P<0.001). Irradiated tumor cells induced mice splenocytes to secrete more IL-10, similar to mIL-2 treatment, but not iPSC-conditioned medium treatment. mIL-2 had better efficacy than conditioned medium in inducing splenocyte interferon-γ production. The CTL and NK cell depletion test showed that the immunostimulating effect of iPSC-conditioned medium on splenocytes was through the enhancement of NK cellular activity (P<0.05). The subcutaneous melanoma growth model showed that B16-bearing mice treated with an iPSC-conditioned medium intraperitoneal injection had a decreased tumor growth rate (P<0.01).

Soluble melanoma antigen Ag injected i.p. into the tumor-bearing host can effectively augment melanoma growth in vivo. Two T cell types with the L3T4+ or double-negative/I-J+ phenotype are involved in the suppression of anti-melanoma CTL responses and can easily be generated in the in vitro primary 12 h-culture. Anti-melanoma Ts recognizes the GM3(NeuAc) structure and distinguishes GM3 molecular species. This is because liposomes constructed with GM3(NeuAc) but not with GM3(NeuGc) gangliosides alone can effectively induce the melanoma-specific Ts. It is thus likely that tumor cells can escape from the immunologic surveillance system by stimulating the repertoire of Ts for self-Ag, GM3, which has existed even in the unprimed conditions in order to maintain self-tolerance. These would appear to be the major escape mechanisms.",

In contrast, in 74 American Joint Committee on Cancer stages I-IV melanoma patients, we found that development of lymph node metastases is a key event triggering CD8(+) T-cell-mediated immunity to self-epitopes encoded by melanocyte differentiation antigens. This was shown by the increased peripheral precursor frequency to Melan-A/Mart-1, gp100, and tyrosinase epitopes in stage III and IV compared with stage I and II patients, and by accumulation of functional memory T cells directed to Melan-A/Mart-1(26-35) in tumor-invaded lymph nodes. However, in tumor-invaded lymph nodes of most patients, CD8(+) T cells directed to melanocyte differentiation antigens or to tumor-restricted antigens (MAGE-3 and NY-ESO-1 epitopes), showed a CCR7(+) CD45RA(+) CD27(+) CD28(+) perforin(-) \"precursor\" phenotype. Only in 7 of 23 cases antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells in invaded lymph nodes showed a predominant CCR7(-) CD45RA(-) CD27(+) CD28(-) perforin(+) \"preterminally differentiated\" phenotype. In the latter subset of patients, by immunohistochemistry in lymph node lesions, we found that CD8(+) T lymphocytes intermingling with the neoplastic tissue expressed a CCR7(-) CD45RO(+)/RA(-) phenotype, whereas CD4(+) lymphocytes did not infiltrate the tumor. Furthermore, perforin and granzyme B were expressed on a higher fraction of the CD8(+) cells surrounding the invading tumor compared with the lymphocytes infiltrating the neoplastic tissue. In addition, no evidence for tumor regression was found in such metastatic lesions, as documented by absence of neoplastic cell necrosis or apoptosis. These data indicate that neoplastic cells in the lymph nodes and/or increased tumor burden in metastatic disease activate CD8(+) T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity to self-epitopes. However, the paucity of terminally differentiated CD8(+) T cells at tumor site suggests that immunotherapy strategies may require not only the boosting of tumor immunity, but also effective means to promote CD8(+) T-cell differentiation in the neoplastic tissue.",

A reverse transcription PCR and Southern blot assay to detect beta 1-->4GalNac-T mRNA expression was developed. Beta 1-->4GalNac-T mRNA was detected in all 13 melanoma cell lines tested. Metastatic melanoma of lymph nodes and different organ sites expressed beta 1-->4GalNac-T mRNA at various levels. Detection sensitivity of the reverse transcription PCR assay was 1 ng of total RNA extracted from tumor specimens and approximately 5 melanoma cells in 20 million normal donor peripheral blood lymphocytes. In assessment of blood from 126 melanoma patients, beta 1-->4GalNac-T mRNA was more frequently found in advanced-stage melanomas and in patients showing more aggressive tumor progression.

In several recent studies survival rates of melanoma patients who were pregnant and those who became pregnant after diagnosis were compared to the rates in women without pregnancies. No significant differences were found. In addition, the use of oral contraceptives and menopausal estrogens, which were formerly thought to be related to an elevated risk of developing melanoma, was shown not to affect the risk and natural course of malignant melanoma. In conclusion, the recent results of extensive investigations no longer substantiate recommendations for abortion in pregnant melanoma patients. The use of oral contraceptives and menopausal estrogens is likewise no longer contraindicated in melanoma patients.

Nearly 100% of the radioactivity could be recovered with this harvesting device. The technique allowed the detection of cytolytic activities of lymphocytes after 6 h of incubation. Lymphocytes from patients with primary malignant melanoma showed a significantly higher cytolytic reactivity (P less than 0.001) than normal donors' lymphocytes against three different melanoma cell lines. In a series of parallel experiments on 36 patients and 18 normal donors, this modification of the [3H]proline test was compared with three different assays: the conventional microcytotoxicity test of Takasugi and Klein, the original [3H]proline microcytotoxicity test of Bean et al., and the viability count of tumor cells.",

Reported herein are the tumor doubling times of four primary cutaneous melanomas in which the diagnosis of melanoma had been delayed, and their metastases (3 of 4). The median/mean tumor doubling times for primary melanoma and metastatic melanoma was 94/144 days (range 50-377) and 33/64 days (range 8-212), respectively. By paired t test, metastatic tumor doubling time was significantly faster than primary tumor doubling time (P = 0.01). Extrapolating the growth curves of metastatic melanoma to the point of onset of metastasis revealed that dissemination of tumor cells occurred well before first clinical presentation and symptoms in two cases, and in one case, during the interval between clinical presentation and complete excision of the primary. At the opposite pole, extrapolated growth curves for slow tumor doubling time melanoma demonstrated that long-term follow up (>10 years) is required to determine whether patients have been cured of melanoma or not. Overall, these estimates of melanoma tumor doubling time validate the concept of tumor progression, reinforce the tenet of early detection and curative excision, and can explain the phenomenon of late onset of metastases, respectively.",

This entity is exceedingly rare; only five cases are described in the literature. The patient presented with rapid deterioration of vision within a 2-week period. After an ophthalmological diagnosis of chiasmal syndrome was made, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the head revealed an intra- and suprasellar mass that was elevating and compressing the optic chiasm. Because of the signal heterogeneity of the lesion a hemorrhagic pituitary macroadenoma was assumed; the lesion was transsphenoidally resected. Histological examination of the specimen showed a malignant melanocytic tumor with immunopositivity for S100 protein and HMB-45. Despite extensive staging no other primary melanotic tumor was found. Thus, a primary sellar melanoma was diagnosed. Postoperative MR images demonstrated no residual tumor. For adjuvant therapy the region around the sella turcica received 40.4 Gy stereotactically guided radiation. A 24-month follow-up examination revealed no tumor recurrence. This represents the sixth case of such a lesion reported in the literature, the third case evaluated using MR imaging, and the first case with a progression-free survival of 24 months.

The present study investigated whether interleukin (IL)-18, which can enhance Fas ligand expression, is produced by B16F10 melanoma cells and is involved in immune escape of tumor cells. Immunohistology, reverse transcription-PCR, intracellular fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis, and immunoblotting demonstrated that melanoma cells express IL-18. C57BL/6 splenocytes cultured with culture supernatants of B16F10 melanoma cells enhanced IFN-gamma production, which was blocked by anti-IL-18 antibody, indicating that IL-18 in the culture supernatants is functional. In addition to IL-18, the IL-18 receptor was also detected in B16F10 melanoma cells, suggesting a role of this cytokine in regulating the functions of B16F10 melanoma cells. The functional effect of IL-18 on B16F10 melanoma cells was shown by reduction of Fas ligand expression in cells treated with anti-IL-18 antibody or transfected with IL-18 antisense cDNA. In addition, the same treatments decreased intracellular reactive oxygen intermediate levels in B16F10 melanoma cells, indicating that IL-18 regulates reactive oxygen intermediate production, which is involved in Fas ligand expression. Furthermore, transfection of IL-18 antisense cDNA into melanoma cells increased the susceptibility of tumor cells to natural killer cells in vitro. When IL-18 antisense transfectants were implanted into syngeneic mice, severe reduction of tumor cell growth was observed with concomitant infiltrated natural killer cells in the tumor area. Taken together, these results demonstrate that IL-18 has a critical role as a survival factor for B16F10 melanoma cells.",

Generating tumor-reactive lymphocyte cultures is technically difficult and resource intensive; these limitations have restricted the widespread application of ACT. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) from melanoma contain tumor antigen-reactive cells. The \"standard\" method for producing TIL cultures for clinical administration requires extended in vitro expansion in interleukin-2, then identification of tumor-reactive cells by immunologic assays. We show here that limitations in reagents and methods during screening underrepresent the actual reactivity of TIL cultures. Furthermore, the extended culture times necessitated by the screening assays resulted in telomere shortening and reduced expression of CD27 and CD28 in the TIL cultures, properties that our prior studies showed are correlated with in vivo persistence and clinical response. We have thus developed an alternative \"young\" TIL method that demonstrated superior in vitro attributes compared with standard TIL. This approach uses the entire resected tumor to rapidly expand TIL for administration without in vitro testing for tumor recognition. Our observations suggest that younger TIL can have an undetermined but high level of antigen reactivity, and other advantageous attributes such as long telomeres and high levels of CD27 and CD28. We suggest that minimally cultured, unselected lymphocytes represent an alternative strategy for generating TIL cultures suitable for use in ACT that, if effective in vivo, may facilitate the widespread application of this approach to a broader population of patients with melanoma.",

In this study, we compared the T cell response to the B16F10 melanoma engrafted into CD5-deficient and wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Compared with wild-type mice, CD5 knockout animals displayed delayed tumor growth, associated with tumor infiltration by T cell populations exhibiting a more activated phenotype and enhanced antitumor effector functions. However, control of tumor progression in CD5(-/-) mice was transient due to increased AICD of CD8(+) tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes. Remarkably, in vivo protection of T cells from TCR-mediated apoptosis by an adenovirus engineered to produce soluble Fas resulted in a dramatic reduction in tumor growth.

The preparations exhibited a comparable ultrastructure of empty vesicles of various form and size. The melanoma membrane consisted of at least 15 protein components and the glioma membrane consisted of at least 24 protein components, four of which were absent in the membrane of normal tissue, as revealed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The four tumor-associated polypeptides could be solubilized together with a few other membrane components by the non-ionic detergent Triton-X100 and were used as an antigen source for immunologic characterization of melanoma and glioma membranes. A rabbit antiserum prepared against these solubilized membrane components from melanoma were absorbed with plasma membranes from a variety of normal tissue including erythrocytes, lymphocytes, spleen, liver, lung, kidney, placenta and brain. The absorbed antiserum reacted with the membrane extract of all the 11 melanomas tested so far; in addition it cross-reacted with an identically prepared extract from all the 15 gliomas tested. Membrane extracts from other tumors, such as kidney and mammary carcinoma, were negative in this respect. Furthermore, a rabbit antiserum prepared against Triton extract from glioma membranes yielded after exhaustive absorption an immune precipitate not only with the specimens from the 15 other gliomas but also with those from the 11 melanomas. Electrophoretic analysis of the immune precipitate formed by the immunoglobulin fraction of the absorbed rabbit antiserum and the Triton-X100 extract from melanoma membranes exhibited six polypeptide bands, two of which appear antigen-derived as they were missing in the profile of the immunoglobulin pattern. A comparable electrophoretic pattern was obtained with the immune precipitate of the glioma antigen specimen. The molecular weight of these two polypeptides was estimated on the basis of their electrophoretic mobility to be 55,000 and 10,000 daltons, respectively. The electrophoretic immunologic findings argue for a common membrane component in human melanoma and glioma patients. Using the Triton extract from melanoma membranes as an antigen source, precipitating antibodies could be detected in the immunoglobulin fraction of 16 of the 24 sera from melanoma patients and in that of 15 of the 23 glioma patients by means of counter-current electrophoresis.

The earliest formation of these tumors was associated with higher copy numbers of the transgene; mice of different single-copy lines varied greatly in age of onset and frequency of eye tumors. Coat pigmentation was reduced in almost all lines, to various extents. Primary skin melanomas arose later and less frequently than eye melanomas.

(2) CMC activity of lymphocytes from melanoma patients was generally lower than that of control lymphocytes and decreased further with progression of the disease. (3) CLL lymphocytes were virtually non-toxic for M1 cells, even at high aggressor:target cell ratios.

We show that our clinical scale TIL production process yielded efficient modification of the PD-1 gene locus, with an average modification frequency of 74.8% (n = 3, range 69.9-84.1%) of the alleles in a bulk TIL population, which resulted in a 76% reduction in PD-1 surface-expression. Forty to 48% of PD-1 gene-edited cells had biallelic PD-1 modification. Importantly, the PD-1 gene-edited TIL product showed improved in vitro effector function and a significantly increased polyfunctional cytokine profile (TNFα, GM-CSF, and IFNγ) compared to unmodified TIL in two of the three donors tested. In addition, all donor cells displayed an effector memory phenotype and expanded approximately 500-2,000-fold in vitro. Thus, further study to determine the efficiency and safety of adoptive cell transfer using PD-1 gene-edited TIL for the treatment of metastatic melanoma is warranted. ",

Due to the increasing frequency of melanoma it is crucial to detect early the malignant lesions on the basis of physical examination and noninvasive diagnostic methods (dermatoscopy, videodermatoscopy with total body photography). Histopathological examination is conclusive. In diagnostic imaging of early stage melanoma it is very important to evaluate the regional lymph node. In clinical practice, the cross-sectional imaging modalities including computed tomography (CT), ultrasound and magnetic resonance (MR) are widely used to assess lymph nodes. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is currenly a valuable and reliable diagnostic procedure for precise staging of patients with clinically no cutaneous melanoma. The presence of SLN metastases is the most important negative factor for clinical outcome in melanoma patients. Introduction of RT-PCR allowed to detect individual cancer cells in tested sample of blood or tissue. Surgical treatment is an essential therapeutic modality in patients with melanoma. Treatment of a primary melanoma involves local excision of the tumour with a margin of skin and subcutaneous tissue. The role of systemic therapy is still a matter of clinical trials. Today's systemic therapy modalities include the use of biological agents (e.g. interferon alfa and interleukin 2) and cytotoxic agents. The efficacy of different types of melanoma vaccines (antigenic, cellular, DNA, GMTV) has been analyzed in numerous clinical trials. Results of these trials are still unsatisfactory. Dendritic cells in melanoma therapy will be very important in the future. Dendritic cells are the most efficient stimulators of T lymphocyte response among professional antygen presenting cells (APC) and the only APC capable to prime naive T lymphocytes with the antygen.

In antibody-binding studies using a large range of cultured tumor cells, it was shown that Leo Me13 was relatively specific for melanoma cells. Of more importance, Leo Me13 inhibited conjugate formation between AK cells and melanoma target cells by 60 to 80% and caused an eight- to 10-fold reduction in killing. The MAb did not immunoprecipitate protein from melanoma cells surface-labeled with 125I, and thin-layer chromatography followed by immunoblotting of the separated glycolipids from melanoma cells indicated that the epitope was on acidic glycolipids migrating between GM1 and GD1a; moreover, treatment of melanoma cells with neuraminidase resulted in complete loss of binding of Leo Me13 but not of other anti-melanoma antibodies which did not inhibit AK cell-mediated lysis. Other melanoma-reactive MAb of the same isotype as Leo Me13 did not block killing of melanoma cells, but one documented antibody, R24, an IgG3 with specificity for the ganglioside GD3, was found to inhibit this function.

A number of factors complicate the diagnosis of desmoplastic/spindle cell melanoma, including the variable absence of a lentiginous component, its spindle cell morphology, and its many morphologic mimics, including scars, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, neurofibroma, atypical fibroxanthoma, and spindled carcinoma. The immunohistochemical confirmation of desmoplastic/spindle cell melanoma may also be difficult, because the majority of tumors are negative for specific melanocytic markers such as HMB-45 and Melan-A, despite their usual expression of S-100 protein. Two new and potentially promising melanocytic markers, microphthalmia transcription factor (MiTF) and melanoma cell adhesion molecule (Mel-CAM), have been shown to be sensitive markers of epithelioid melanoma, but have not been tested in desmoplastic/spindle cell melanoma or in other rare melanocytic neuroectodermal tumors such as clear cell sarcoma. We immunostained 79 tumors (20 desmoplastic/spindle cell melanomas, 10 scars, 10 neurofibromas, 12 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, 10 atypical fibroxanthomas, 10 clear cell sarcomas, 3 melanotic schwannomas, and 4 cellular blue nevi) for MiTF and Mel-CAM. MiTF expression was seen in 11 of 20 desmoplastic/spindle cell melanomas, 0 of 10 scars, 2 of 10 neurofibromas, 0 of 12 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, 1 of 10 atypical fibroxanthomas, 7 of 10 clear cell sarcomas, 3 of 3 melanotic schwannomas, and 3 of 4 cellular blue nevi. Mel-CAM expression was present in 14 of 17 desmoplastic/spindle cell melanomas, 0 of 10 scars, 4 of 10 neurofibromas, 3 of 11 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, 0 of 10 atypical fibroxanthomas, 9 of 10 clear cell sarcomas, 3 of 3 melanotic schwannomas, and 0 of 4 cellular blue nevi. MiTF and Mel-CAM were coexpressed in 6 of 17 desmoplastic/spindle cell melanomas and in no other tumor. Regarding desmoplastic/spindle cell melanoma, scar, neurofibroma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, and atypical fibroxanthoma, the sensitivity and specificity of MiTF for desmoplastic/spindle cell melanoma were 55% and 91%, respectively. For this same group of tumors, Mel-CAM had a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 83%. We conclude that the sensitivity and specificity of MiTF for desmoplastic melanoma equals or exceeds that of such markers as HMB-45 or Melan-A, and that MiTF should be part of the initial immunohistochemical panel for the work-up of such cases. Mel-CAM, while very sensitive, is relatively nonspecific, because it is also expressed in a variety of mesenchymal tumors and carcinomas. Mel-CAM is best reserved for cases morphologically suspected to be desmoplastic/ spindle cell melanoma, in which S-100 is positive and MiTF and other melanocytic markers are negative.

VEGF is angiogenic in vivo and it also acts as a vascular permeability factor. VEGF is overexpressed in many skin disorders characterized by angiogenesis and increased vascular permeability. We investigated VEGF expression in 22 primary cutaneous melanomas, 33 melanoma metastases and six naevocellular naevi using immunohistochemistry. VEGF accumulated on the vascular endothelia in the normal dermis, suggesting that a constitutive low level of VEGF expression may regulate skin vessel function under normal physiological conditions. No VEGF was detected in the cells of naevocellular naevi or normal dermis. In contrast, 32% of the primary and 91% of the metastatic melanomas contained melanoma cells staining for VEGF. Expression of VEGF was more frequent in metastases than in primary melanomas (P <0.0001). Tumour-infiltrating inflammatory cells expressed VEGF in all melanomas. A high number of VEGF-expressing inflammatory cells was associated with high VEGF expression in melanoma cells (P = 0.003). Our results suggest that VEGF is up-regulated during the course of melanoma progression and dissemination and that tumour-infiltrating cells expressing VEGF may contribute to the progression of melanoma.",

The effect of histone modifications and their catalysing enzymes over euchromatic promoter DNA methylation in melanoma remains unclear. This study investigated the potential association of p16(INK) (4A) promoter methylation with histone methyltransferase SETDB1 expression in Greek patients with sporadic melanoma and their correlation with clinicopathological characteristics. Promoter methylation was detected by methylation-specific PCR in 100 peripheral blood samples and 58 melanoma tissues from the same patients. Cell proliferation (Ki-67 index), p16(INK) (4A) and SETDB1 expression were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. High-frequency promoter methylation (25.86%) was observed in tissue samples and correlated with increased cell proliferation (P = 0.0514). p16(INK) (4A) promoter methylation was higher in vertical growth-phase (60%) melanomas than in radial (40%, P = 0.063) and those displaying epidermal involvement (P = 0.046). Importantly, p16(INK) (4A) methylation correlated with increased melanoma thickness according to Breslow index (P = 0.0495) and marginally with increased Clark level (I/II vs III/IV/V, P = 0.070). Low (1-30%) p16(INK) (4A) expression was detected at the majority (19 of 54) of melanoma cases (35.19%), being marginally correlated with tumor lymphocytic infiltration (P = 0.078). SETDB1 nuclear immunoreactivity was observed in 47 of 57 (82.46%) cases, whereas 27 of 57 (47.37%) showed cytoplasmic immunoexpression. Cytoplasmic SETDB1 expression correlated with higher frequency of p16(INK) (4A) methylation and p16(INK) (4A) expression (P = 0.033, P = 0.011, respectively). Increased nuclear SETDB1 levels were associated with higher mitotic count (0-5/mm(2) vs >5/mm(2) , P = 0.0869), advanced Clark level (III-V, P = 0.0380), epidermal involvement (P = 0.0331) and the non-chronic sun exposure-associated melanoma type (P = 0.0664).

By sequencing exons and intron borders, 36 SNPs and one indel were identified. Of 10 coding SNPs, three were non-synonymous mutations, likely to affect the protein conformation. A promising variant, located in exon 19 (p.Val870Ala), was genotyped in a MeLiM × Duroc cross, and an association analysis was conducted on several melanoma-related traits. This variant showed a significant association with melanoma development, tumor ulceration and cutaneous invasion.

Most tumors appear as echopoor areas in high-frequency sonography. Until today, a differentiation between skin tumors by means of high-frequency ultrasound is not possible. This is also true concerning the differentiation between the tumor tissue itself and its subtumoral inflammatory infiltration. Therefore, this lack of differentiation leads to the fact that sonometric thicknesses of tumors often exceed the originally measured tumor thickness in histology. By means of three-dimensional reconstruction of serial b-scan images, it is possible to determine each tumor's volume and surface as well as the topographical arrangement of echopoor areas and sonographical structures. Besides high-frequency ultrasound, additional non-invasive techniques like MRI, ultrasound- or laser-doppler, computer-aided image analysis and epiluminescence microscopy are also available for diagnosing malignant melanoma. Epiluminescence microscopy is used today as a standard technique in the diagnosis of malignant melanoma due to the possibility of differential diagnosis.

Histopathological evaluation revealed a multinodular to packeted, poorly demarcated, unencapsulated, infiltrative exophytic melanocytic neoplasm composed of bundles and nests of plump spindloid to polygonal heavily pigmented epithelioid neoplastic cells interspersed with pigment-laden macrophages within a fine fibrovascular stroma. Upon examination after enucleation, neoplastic cells were found to infiltrate into the lateral cornea, sclera and the choroid. This is a unique case of an epibulbar melanoma with choroidal invasion in a foal. Based on the sudden onset and rapid growth as well as the histological evidence of invasion, well-differentiated features, heavy pigmentation, and no apparent mitoses, this neoplasm was considered to be a low-grade malignant melanoma.

The oncolytic activity of CVA21 against in vivo melanoma xenografts, which possess rapid growth rates and more extensive vascular structure than SK-Mel-28 xenografts warrants further investigation. In the present study we evaluated the oncolytic action of CVA21 against rapidly growing melanoma xenografts (ME4405) which exhibit a highly vascular phenotype. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that in vitro cultures of ME4405 cells expressed comparable levels of the CVA21 cellular receptors, ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecules-1) and DAF (decay accelerating factor) to SK-Mel-28 cells. Despite similar levels of CVA21 receptor expression, SK-Mel-28 cells appear to be more susceptible to viral lysis than ME4405 cells, even though the kinetics of virus replication in both lines was comparable. Intratumoral, intraperitoneal or intravenous administration of CVA21 were equally effective in reducing the tumor volume of ME4405 xenografts in immunodeficient mice, and provides further evidence for the use of CVA21 as a novel oncolytic agent against varying phenotypes of malignant melanoma.",

Gab2 is an adaptor protein that potentiates the activation of the Ras-Erk and PI3K-Akt pathways and has recently been implicated in human cancer; however, its role in melanoma has not been explored. In this study, we found that Gab2 was either amplified (approximately 11%) and/or overexpressed (approximately 50%) in melanoma. Gab2 protein expression correlated with clinical melanoma progression, and higher levels of expression were seen in metastatic melanomas compared with primary melanoma and melanocytic nevi. We found that overexpression of Gab2 potentiates, whereas silencing of Gab2 reduces, migration and invasion of melanoma cells. Gab2 mediated the hyperactivation of Akt signaling in the absence of growth factors, whereas inhibition of the PI3K-Akt pathway decreased Gab2-mediated tumor cell migration and invasive potential. Gab2 overexpression resulted in enhanced tumor growth and metastatic potential in vivo. These studies demonstrate a previously undefined role for Gab2 in melanoma tumor progression and metastasis.",

Small choroidal melanoma in the posterior fundus is amenable to treatment options such as enucleation, radiotherapy, laser photocoagulation, and transpupillary thermotherapy or a combination of these methods. Transpupillary thermotherapy is a technique of tumor heating by infrared radiation delivered through the pupil into the tumor. This method causes dramatic tumor necrosis in choroidal melanomas up to 4 mm in thickness. With properly selected small choroidal melanomas, tumor control is approximately 94%. The heat induces cellular damage at the site of treatment with few remote side effects; therefore, complications are generally limited to the site of treatment and include retinal vascular obstruction (23%), retinal traction (20%), retinal neovascularization (6%), and retinal hole with detachment (< 1%). Tumors located temporal to the foveola demonstrate a statistically higher risk for retinal traction than those located in other quadrants. Tumors near the optic disk demonstrate a higher incidence of retinal neovascularization due to heat-induced obstruction of a major retinal vascular arcade. Overall, vision preservation is satisfactory after thermotherapy for choroidal melanoma, with more than 50% of patients maintaining the same or better vision after treatment, depending primarily on tumor location. In summary, small choroidal melanomas can be controlled with transpupillary thermotherapy, especially those near the optic disk and foveola in areas that are otherwise difficult to irradiate.

        "Doc_abstract":"Despite the potent ability of dendritic cells (DCs) to stimulate lymphocyte responses and host immunity, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-derived DCs (GM-DCs) used as antitumor vaccines have demonstrated relatively modest success in cancer immunotherapy. We found that injecting GM-DCs into melanoma tumors in mice, or culturing GM-DCs with melanoma-secreted cytokines or melanoma-conditioned medium, rapidly suppressed DC-intrinsic expression of the gene encoding inhibitor of differentiation 2 (ID2), a transcriptional regulator. Melanoma-associated cytokines repressed Id2 transcription in murine DCs through the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Enforced expression of ID2 in GM-DCs (ID2-GM-DCs) suppressed their production of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Vaccination with ID2-GM-DCs slowed the progression of melanoma tumors and enhanced animal survival, which was associated with an increased abundance of tumor-infiltrating interferon-γ-positive CD4(+) effector and CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells and a decreased number of tumor-infiltrating regulatory CD4(+) T cells. The efficacy of the ID2-GM-DC vaccine was improved by combinatorial treatment with a blocking antibody to programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), a current immunotherapy that overcomes suppressive immune checkpoint signaling. Collectively, our data reveal a previously unrecognized STAT3-mediated immunosuppressive mechanism in DCs and indicate that DC-intrinsic ID2 promotes tumor immunity by modulating tumor-associated CD4(+) T cell responses. Thus, inhibiting STAT3 or overexpressing ID2 selectively in DCs may improve the efficiency of DC vaccines in cancer therapy. ",

In the present studies, we found that mRNA to IL-10 could be demonstrated in 66% of melanoma cell lines by PCR amplification of reverse-transcribed mRNA and in supernatants of the cell lines by ELISA. Release into the supernatants increased approximately 2-fold each day up to 3 days. The MW of 35S-labelled IL-10 secreted by melanoma cells was similar to that reported in previous studies. In the present studies we also examined whether IL-10 may be responsible for some of the immunosuppressive effects of the melanoma cell supernatants observed in previous studies, by testing whether MAbs against IL-10 could reverse the inhibitory effects of these supernatants. Recombinant IL-10 and melanoma supernatants were found to inhibit production of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-2 and mixed lymphocyte reactions but reversal of these effects of melanoma supernatants by MAbs against IL-10 was only seen in the case of TNF-alpha production. These results extend the range of cell types known to produce IL-10 and indicate that malignancy of certain cell types may lead to unregulated production of IL-10 that could have the potential to modulate immune responses against the tumor.",

Melanoma stem cells (MSC) have been implicated in the resistance of this tumor to chemotherapy. Recently we demonstrated in a Phase I clinical trial in patients with metastatic melanoma that radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with 188-Rhenium((188)Re)-6D2 antibody to melanin was a safe and effective modality. Here we investigated the interaction of MSC with RIT as a possible mechanism for RIT efficacy.;Mice bearing A2058 melanoma xenografts were treated with either 1.5 mCi (188)Re-6D2 antibody, saline, unlabeled 6D2 antibody or (188)Re-labeled non-specific IgM.;On Day 28 post-treatment the tumor size in the RIT group was 4-times less than in controls (P<0.001). The tumors were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and FACS for two MSC markers--chemoresistance mediator ABCB5 and H3K4 demethylase JARID1B. There were no significant differences between RIT and control groups in percentage of ABCB5 or JARID1B-positive cells in the tumor population. Our results demonstrate that unlike chemotherapy, which kills tumor cells but leaves behind MSC leading to recurrence, RIT kills MSC at the same rate as the rest of tumor cells.;These results have two main implications for melanoma treatment and possibly other cancers. First, the susceptibility of ABCB5+ and JARID1B+cells to RIT in melanoma might be indicative of their susceptibility to antibody-targeted radiation in other cancers where they are present as well. Second, specifically targeting cancer stem cells with radiolabeled antibodies to ABCB5 or JARID1B might help to completely eradicate cancer stem cells in various cancers.",

The area, thickness, longest diameter, and circumference of the tumor mass were measured on pathological sections, and were correlated with maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of the tumors on FDG-PET/CT.;Abnormally high uptake of FDG was noted in the affected eyes of 5 patients, but not in the eyes of 2 patients. The 5 patients with high uptake showed nodular tumors extruding into the vitreous cavity while the 2 patients with absence of uptake showed diffusely infiltrating tumors in the wide area of the choroid with or without a small mushroom-like protrusion. One patient with diffuse infiltration showed concurrent liver metastases with high uptake on PET/CT while another patient with a nodular tumor developed liver metastases a year later. The tumors with higher SUVmax had a tendency to have a wider area and greater thickness on pathological sections (ρ = 0.775, P = 0.0557, Spearman rank correlation test).;FDG-PET/CT showed correlation of the uptake with tumor sizes but was limited in detecting diffusely infiltrating tumors in the choroid without nodular formation.",

This semiquantitative RT-PCR method could be adapted to analysis of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded histopathological samples of primary tumor material and demonstrated to be reproducible and to be useful for the assessment of V alpha- and V beta-gene family usage in tumor samples. The TIL in primary tumors were observed to preferentially express certain TCR V alpha- and V beta-gene families: V alpha 4, and V beta 8 were highly expressed in several of the primary tumors analyzed using this method. With respect to V alpha 22 and V beta 8, the preferential expression of these V-gene families was demonstrated to be due in situ clonal expansion of T cells by means of cloning and sequencing of the CDR3 regions (V-J or V-D-J, respectively) corresponding to the RT-PCR products from one of the primary tumors. The observed preferential usage of certain TCR V alpha and V beta-genes strongly suggest the in situ clonal expansion of specific populations of T cells in accordance with recent results from others. These clonal T cell populations probably react with certain melanoma-associated peptides presented by specific HLA molecules. The preferential usage of certain V alpha- and V beta-gene families observed in several tumors further supports the involvement of a limited number of shared melanocyte or melanoma-associated peptides. Since the HLA status of the patients is obviously important to interpret these results, some of the patients were typed for HLA-A1 and -A2, the two most well-characterized restriction elements for melanoma-associated antigens, either serologically or by a newly developed RT-PCR method which similarly could by applied directly to the tumor material. In TIL in primary melanomas, a possible correlation was suggested between HLA-A2 and the preferential usage of the TCR V-gene families V alpha 4, V alpha 5, V alpha 22 and V beta 8, whereas the V beta 3-gene family appeared to be expressed together with HLA-A1. The V-gene families which were highly expressed in the primary tumors were generally not, or only very weakly, expressed in the corresponding metastases and vice versa, possibly reflecting a substantial change in the phenotype of the metastatic melanoma target cells. Continued studies of larger patient materials will be necessary to extend and validate these conclusions and of obvious interest for the further analysis of the T cell response in melanoma.",

Our observation that sera from patients who failed to display a delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity reaction to 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) are more inhibitory to mitogen stimulation than sera from patients who react to this contact allergen suggests that DNCB skin testing may identify an immunological defect mediated by circulating humoral factors.",

Multiple patient and treatment characteristics were evaluated for response correlates. In addition, TIL were assayed within 7 days of infusion for characteristics such as doubling time, cell-surface phenotype, autologous tumor lysis in 4-hour chromium-51 release assays, and cytokine secretion following autologous tumor stimulation.;Nine patients experienced complete or partial tumor regressions.

Treatment variables such as the cumulative IL-2 dose and concomitant administration of cyclophosphamide or interferon (IFN)-alpha were not predictive of response, although responders received 33% more TIL. However, statistically significant differences in favor of clinical response were noted for extranodal source of TIL (v lymph node), shorter culture duration (mean, 38 v 47 days), shorter TIL doubling time (2.6 v 3.7 days), greater autologous tumor lysis by TIL (30% v 15%; effector-to-target [E:T], 40:1), and secretion of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) by TIL following autologous tumor stimulation (six of nine responders v eight of 32 nonresponders).;The associations of TIL lysis of autologous tumor and younger TIL age with clinical response observed in this study are supportive of previous reports, and these findings will be useful in designing future clinical trials.

In this study, we investigated whether these processes can be promoted by s.c. administration of low-dose (0.5 microg/kg) recombinant human interleukin-12 (rHuIL-12) to metastatic melanoma patients. A striking burst of HLA-restricted CTL precursors (CTLp) directed to autologous tumor was documented in peripheral blood by a high-efficiency limiting dilution analysis technique within a few days after rHuIL-12 injection. A similar burst in peripheral CTLp frequency was observed even when looking at response to a single tumor-derived peptide, as documented by an increase in Melan-A/Mart-1(27-35)-specific CTLp in two HLA-A*0201+ patients by limiting dilution analysis and by staining peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) with HLA-A*0201-melanoma antigen-A/melanoma antigen recognized by T cells (Melan-A/Mart)-1 tetrameric complexes. The CTLp burst was associated, in PBLs, with enhanced expression of T-cell adhesion/homing receptors CD11a/CD18, CD49d, CD44, and with increased proportion of cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA)-positive T cells. This was matched by a marked increase, in serum, of soluble forms of the endothelial cell adhesion molecules E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecules (VCAM)-1 and intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAM)-1. Infiltration of neoplastic tissue by CDS+ T cells with a memory and cytolytic phenotype was found by immunohistochemistry in eight of eight posttreatment metastatic lesions but not in five of five pretreatment metastatic lesions from three patients. Increased tumor necrosis and/or fibrosis were also found in several posttherapy lesions of two of three patients in comparison with pretherapy metastases. These results provide the first evidence that rHuIL-12 can boost the frequency of circulating antitumor CTLp in tumor patients, enhances expression of ligand receptor pairs contributing to the lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1/ICAM-1, very late antigen-4/VCAM-1, and CLA/E-selectin adhesion pathways, and promotes infiltration of neoplastic lesions by CD8+ memory T cells in a clinical setting.",

All cases showed an increase in the measured maximum tumor thickness when serially sectioned, but neither deep dermal extension of melanoma nor angiolymphatic invasion by tumor were observed. Measured thickness in thin cutaneous melanoma is a function of the number of sections examined. The method of specimen sampling needs to be carefully defined and standardized in studies that attempt to define prognosis on the basis of tumor thickness.

Although this therapy yields high response rates resulting in prolonged survival, the mechanisms involved remain unknown. Here, we investigated whether treatment of tumor-bearing mice with DTIC and DNCB resulted in a specific immune response against the tumor. Subcutaneous (s.c.) tumors and lung metastases were induced in C57BL/6 mice by injecting syngeneic B16-melanoma cells s.c. or into the lateral tail vein, respectively. Mice were treated with intraperitoneal injections of DTIC followed by epifocal application of DNCB. This therapeutic approach significantly reduced the growth of s.c. tumors as well as lung metastases. Our data showed that the effector mechanisms involved are dependent on T cells. No therapeutic effect was observed in immunodeficient RAG-1(-/-) mice, or when the contact sensitizer DNCB was replaced by skin irritants (croton oil or tributyltin). Splenic lymphocytes obtained from treated mice displayed a three-fold higher specific cytolytic activity against B16 cells than in tumor-bearing controls. Both CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells were able to lyse B16 cells. No changes were observed in natural killer (NK) cell activity. Likewise, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) of treated mice showed higher cytolytic activity than that of controls. Analysis of cytokine expression in s.c. tumors revealed increased mRNA levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in treated tumors. Together, these findings demonstrate the ability of DTIC/DNCB treatment to induce an effective T cell-dependent host immune response against a syngeneic tumor.",

The vast majority of evidence to date in support of the concept of tumor dormancy originates from animal studies; however, extensive epidemiologic data from breast cancer strongly suggests that this process does occur in human disease. In this review, we aim to demonstrate that metastatic tumor dormancy does exist in cutaneous melanoma based on evidence from mouse models and clinical observations of late recurrence and occult transmission by organ transplantation. Experimental data underscores the critical role of impaired angiogenesis and immune regulation as major mechanisms for maintenance of tumor dormancy.

Thus, the presence of clonally expanded T cells within neoplastic lesions is an indication of ongoing HLA-restricted T cell-mediated immune responses. Multiple tumors, including renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), are often infiltrated by significant amounts of T cells, the so-called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). In the present study, we analyzed RCC lesions (n = 13) for the presence of expanded T-cell clonotypes using T-cell receptor clonotype mapping. Surprisingly, we found that RCCs comprise relatively low numbers of distinct expanded T-cell clonotypes as compared with melanoma lesions. The numbers of different T-cell clonotypes detected among RCC-infiltrating lymphocytes were in the range of 1-17 (median = 5), and in several patients, the number of clonotypes expanded within tumor lesions resembled that observed among autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Moreover, several of these clonotypes were identical in TILs and PBMCs. Flow cytometry data demonstrated that the general differentiation status of CD8",

Recently published information regarding conservative management has revealed that plaque radiotherapy combined with thermotherapy offers 97% tumor control, similar to charged-particle radiotherapy. Additionally, patient survival after treatment of medium-size melanoma is similar when comparing plaque radiotherapy versus enucleation. Risk factors identifying small choroidal melanoma include patient symptoms, tumor thickness more than 2 mm, presence of associated subretinal fluid, presence of orange pigment on the tumor surface, and location of the tumor margin at the optic disc. These factors assist in early detection of choroidal melanoma.;The management of choroidal melanoma continues to improve with earlier detection of tumors and better treatment methods. Local tumor control is excellent with radiotherapeutic methods. Future studies should investigate control of subclinical metastasis.",

Eighteen of 22 (82%) of patients treated for microscopic residual disease have been free of local recurrence to date. Ten of the 18 are alive and free of disease for up to 44 months following irradiation. Seven of nine (78%) patients treated for gross residual tumor have had no recurrence or progression of tumor in the irradiated volume, five of the nine achieved a complete remission and three are alive and free of disease at ten, 13, and 42 months, respectively. Twenty-three patients with recurrent melanoma were irradiated. Nine achieved a complete remission (39%) of tumor in the irradiated volume and three are alive and free of disease at up to 56 months following irradiation treatment. Three major complications of irradiation have been seen in the 54 patients treated.

This has been suggested by reports of spontaneous responses of metastatic disease with strong immune infiltrates, and supported by recent data correlating clinical response after IFNalpha treatment with development of generalized autoimmunity. Since the identification of melanoma-associated tumor antigens, many groups have performed clinical trials to take advantage of this discovery with melanoma-specific cancer vaccines. These trials, in which multiple antigen delivery strategies have been tested in hundreds of patients, have demonstrated that these vaccines are safe, immunogenic, and yield a low frequency of objective clinical responses. The ability to perform careful immunological monitoring has allowed important insights into the nature of the anti-tumor immunity generated by these vaccinations. While many trials have found that the absolute frequency of T cells specific for a vaccine-encoded antigen are a marker of immunization, it does not correlate with objective clinical response. Induction of broad immunity to multiple tumor antigens, taking advantage of cross-reactive T cells and activation of persistent T cells may be more important. Harnessing additional modes of amplifying immune responses (lymphodepletion, cytokine support, inhibition of negative immune self-regulation) are now being tested and should improve clinical responses from 5% to 10% complete response seen currently.",

Despite the evidence of the role of mast cells in tumor growth and angiogenesis, the potential mechanism remains to be elucidated. Therefore, we investigated the role of mast cell-derived HIF-1α in melanoma growth. Here, we identify that the most positive cells for HIF-1α staining are seen in mast cells of human and animal melanoma tissue. The number of the stromal cell types (fibroblasts, macrophages and endothelial cells) was also increased in melanoma tissues. In activated bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs), expressions of HIF-1α and VEGF were increased. Histamine also induced the expressions of HIF-1α and VEGF in BMMCs. H1 receptor antagonists significantly improved overall survival rates and substantially suppressed tumor growth as well as the infiltration of mast cells and levels of VEGF through the inhibition of HIF-1α expression in B16F10 melanoma-bearing mice. Furthermore, the injection of HIF-1α depleted BMMCs markedly inhibited the growth of tumors and migration of mast cells and increased the survival rate of the mice. These findings emphasize that the growth of melanoma can actually be exacerbated by mast cell-derived HIF-1α. In aggregate, our results reveal a novel role for mast cell-derived HIF-1α in the melanoma microenvironment and have important implications for the design of therapeutic strategies.",

Planar images of the whole body complemented by single-photon emission computed tomography on suspected sites were acquired between 4 and 24 h after an intravenous administration of 185-222 MBq (5-6 mCi) of indium-octeotride. SSTR expression in metastatic tissues was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. In seven patients, sandostatin LAR was used with therapeutic intention. Thirty white patients were tested. All had extensive metastatic disease and the median number of previous treatments was three. SRS was found to be positive in 14 (46%) of the patients, but was not related to sex, type of previous treatments, tumor site, or histological type. In 10 patients, sufficient tumor specimens were available to perform immunohistochemical staining for SSTR. All cases with positive SSTR-2A staining were also positive by SRS. Two of the seven patients who received sandostatin LAR died within a month after receiving the first dose, whereas another two (28.5%) had stable disease for more than 5 months. The median time to progression after starting sandostatin was 2.1 months (range: 0.2-5.5 months). Approximately 50% of the uveal melanoma patients with extensive metastatic disease were positive for SSR, which was consistent with immunohistochemical staining for SSTR-2A.

Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated with antibodies blocking inhibitory immune checkpoints such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) or PD-1/PD-L1. Treatment with ipilimumab, a fully human CTLA-4-specific mAb, showed durable clinical efficacy in metastatic melanoma; its mechanism of action is, however, only partially understood. This is a study of 29 patients with advanced cutaneous melanoma treated with ipilimumab. We analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and matched melanoma metastases from 15 patients responding and 14 not responding to ipilimumab by multicolor flow cytometry, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) assay, and immunohistochemistry. PBMCs and matched tumor biopsies were collected 24 h before (i.e., baseline) and up to 4 wk after ipilimumab. Our findings show, to our knowledge for the first time, that ipilimumab can engage ex vivo FcγRIIIA (CD16)-expressing, nonclassical monocytes resulting in ADCC-mediated lysis of regulatory T cells (Tregs). In contrast, classical CD14(++)CD16(-) monocytes are unable to do so. Moreover, we show that patients responding to ipilimumab display significantly higher baseline peripheral frequencies of nonclassical monocytes compared with nonresponder patients. In the tumor microenvironment, responders have higher CD68(+)/CD163(+) macrophage ratios at baseline and show decreased Treg infiltration after treatment. Together, our results suggest that anti-CTLA-4 therapy may target Tregs in vivo. Larger translational studies are, however, warranted to substantiate this mechanism of action of ipilimumab in patients. ",

There is limited analysis of inactivation of RASSF1A in tumors other than carcinomas. Hypermethylation of two regions of the RASSF1A CpG island was investigated in metastatic cutaneous melanomas using methylation-specific PCR; region 1 is located upstream, and region 2 is located within the first exon (1alpha) of the open reading frame of the RASSF1A transcript. Eleven melanoma cell lines and 44 melanoma tumors were examined. Methylation of RASSF1A CpG island promoter region 1 was detected in 7 (64%) cell lines and 18 (41%) tumors, and methylation of region 2 was detected in 9 (82%) cell lines and 22 (50%) tumors. Overall, RASSF1A gene hypermethylation was detected in 55% of the melanoma tumors. No methylation was detected in normal skin tissues or healthy donor lymphocytes. All cell lines that showed methylation at promoter region 1 were also methylated at promoter region 2. Hypermethylation of both CpG island regions correlated with no expression of the RASSF1A gene. RASSF1A transcripts could be reexpressed in cell lines after treatment with 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Our findings indicate that the RASSF1A gene is turned off in a significant number of melanomas and that CpG promoter region hypermethylation may play a role in the transcriptional inactivation of the RASSF1A gene in malignant melanoma.",

Rarely, patients with melanoma have an underlying lymphoproliferative disease, and melanoma metastases might develop as collision tumours in the sentinel lymph node (SLN). The aim of this study was to measure the incidence and examine the effect of collision tumours on the accuracy of SLND and on the validity of staging in this setting. Between 1998 and 2012, 750 consecutive SLNDs were performed in melanoma patients using the triple technique (lymphoscintigraphy, gamma probe and blue dye). The validity of SLND in collision tumours was analysed. False negativity was reflected by the disease-free survival. The literature was reviewed on collision tumours in melanoma. Collision tumours of melanoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) were found in two SLN and in one RLND (0.4%). Subsequent RLNDs of SLND-positive cases were negative for melanoma. The patient with negative SLND developed relapse after 28 months with an inguinal lymph node metastasis of melanoma; RLND showed collision tumours. The literature review identified 12 cases of collision tumours. CLL was associated with increased melanoma incidence and reduced overall survival. This is, to our knowledge, the first assessment of the clinical value of SLND when collision tumours of melanoma and CLL are found. In this small series of three patients with both malignancies present in the same lymph node basin, lymphocytic infiltration of the CLL did not alter radioisotope uptake into the SLN. No false-negative result was observed. Our data suggest the validity of SLND in collision tumours, but given the rarity of the problem, further studies are necessary to confirm this reliability. ",

One approach is to use transgenic animal models or to implant tumor cells. A variety of tumor types have been used for this purpose: tumor cells, such as Greene melanoma, murine B16 melanoma, and human uveal melanoma cells, may be implanted in the eyes of hamsters, rats, rabbits, and mice, among others. Various inoculation routes, including into the anterior chamber and posterior compartment, and retro-orbitally, have been applied to obtain tumor growth mimicking ocular uveal melanoma.

NOD scid and Il2rg-deficient mice represent the \"gold standard\" host for the generation of PDTXs. Compared to other immunocompromised murine lines, these mice offers several advantages including higher engraftment rate, longer lifespan and improved morphological and molecular preservation of patient-derived neoplasms. Here we describe a spectrum of previously uncharacterized post-transplant disorders affecting 14/116 (12%) NOD.Cg- Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Sug/JicTac (NOG) mice subcutaneously engrafted with patient-derived metastatic melanomas. Affected mice exhibited extensive scaling/crusting dermatitis (13/14) associated with emaciation (13/14) and poor/unsuccessful tumor engraftment (14/14). In this context, the following pathological conditions have been recognized and characterized in details: (i) immunoinflammatory disorders with features of graft versus host disease (14/14); (ii) reactive lymphoid infiltrates effacing xenografted tumors (8/14); (iii) post-transplant B cell lymphomas associated with Epstein-Barr virus reactivation (2/14). We demonstrate that all these entities are driven by co-transplanted human immune cells populating patient-derived tumor samples. Since the exploding interest in the utilization of NOD scid and Il2rg-deficient mice for the establishment of PDTX platforms, it is of uppermost importance to raise the awareness of the limitations associated with this model. The disorders here described adversely impact tumor engraftment rate and animal lifespan, potentially representing a major confounding factor in the context of efficacy and personalized therapy studies. The occurrence of these conditions in the NOG model reflects the ability of this mouse line to promote efficient engraftment of human immune cells. Co-transplanted human lymphoid cells have indeed the potential to colonize the recipient mouse initiating the post-transplant conditions here reported. On the other hand, the evidence of an immune response of human origin against the xenotransplanted melanoma opens intriguing perspectives for the establishment of suitable preclinical models of anti-melanoma immunotherapy.

Targeting Maml1 in melanoma cells efficiently knocks down the downstream transcriptional repressors Hey1 and Hes1, resulting in melanoma cell senescence, cellular differentiation, and increased melanin production. Significantly, higher IFNβ and chemokine gene transcripts have been observed, together with increased STAT1 and decreased STAT3 and NF-κB signaling activities. Although decreased cell proliferation contributes to slower tumor growth in vivo, the depletion of NK and CD8(+) T cells in an shMaml1-B16 tumor carrier mouse leads to more rapid tumor growth than that observed in control shC002-B16 tumors. This result demonstrates that the knockdown of Maml1 transcription and function contributes to increased immune surveillance. The knockdown of Maml1 transcription in the human melanoma cell line M537 also results in senescence, IFNβ upregulation, increased chemokine gene expression, and greater NK and CD8(+) T cell migration in a transwell system.

Its removal and histopathological examination enable us to discover metastases of malignant melanomas long before their possibility of detection by any other method. Since the beginning of 1995, we have performed more than 350 gamma-probe-guided sentinel lymphonodectomies (gamma-SLNE), without any clinical evidence of metastases as determined by lymphoscintigraphy. Using gamma-SLNE, the detection and excision of the SLN succeeded in nearly all patients. The SLNs were fixed in formalin, completely cut into 1-mm thin slices and stained for routine H&E histology and with S-100 and HMB-45. In persons with melanomas thinner than 0.75 mm, we never found micrometastases. However, the SLNs were positive in melanomas from 0.76 to 1.50 mm in about 7% of patients, in melanomas from 1.51 to 4.00 mm in about 21% and in tumors thicker than 4 mm in about 44%. In primary melanomas with satellite or in-transit metastases, the SLNs contained metastases in 75% of patients. Normally, a radical lymph node dissection (RLND) follows, as it is considered to be the necessary consequence following detection of tumor cells. The lymph nodes of the RLNDs contained further metastases in about 30% of patients. The probability of the involvement of lymph nodes other than the SLN correlates with the extension of tumor cells in the SLN. During our 4-year-follow-up, we observed only a single lymph node recurrence in a patient with a negative SLN (false negative rate of about 0.4%). The development of systemic metastasis correlates not only with the Breslow tumor thickness, but also with the extent of the involvement of the melanoma metastasis in the SLN. Summarizing, it can be said that gamma-SLNE has revolutionized melanoma surgery. Based on our data, it is absolutely necessary in the staging of malignant melanoma. In our opinion, the existing classification systems for staging lymph node involvement have to be revised in light of the results of SLNE.",

It was hypothesized that continuous expression of IL-15 within a tumor would recruit cytotoxic effector cells to induce an antitumor immune response and improve treatment efficacy. Weekly intratumoral injections were given to evaluate the effect of treatment on the median survival time of C57BL/6 mice bearing established B16F10 melanomas. Mice that received MYXV-Tred or MYXV-IL15 lived significantly longer than mice given treatment controls. Unexpectedly, the median survival time of MYXV-IL15-treated mice was similar to that of MYXV-treated mice. At 1, 2, and 4 days postinoculation, viral plaque assays detected replicating MYXV-Tred and MYXV-IL15 within treated tumors. At these time points in MYXV-IL15-treated tumors, IL-15 concentration, lymphocyte grades, and cluster of differentiation-3+ cell counts were significantly increased when compared to other treatment groups. However, viral titers, recombinant protein expression, and lymphocyte numbers within the tumors diminished rapidly at 7 days postinoculation. These data indicate that treatment with recombinant MYXV should be repeated at least every 4 days to maintain recombinant protein expression within a murine tumor. Additionally, neutrophilic inflammation was significantly increased in MYXV-Tred- and MYXV-IL15-treated tumors at early time points.

Three (20%) patients with distant metastases at initial presentation had a mean survival of 8 mo; one of these primary melanomas measured 0.8 cm. Of 12 patients undergoing \"curative\" treatments--4 by abdominoperineal resection (APR) and 8 by local excision (LE), the incidence of loco-regional recurrence was similar (2/4 and 5/8). All these 7 patients with loco-regional recurrence developed distant metastases within 3 months. The mean survival was similar between APR and LE in the total group (25 mo vs 20 mo), in the decreased (27 mo vs 24 mo) and in those treated with a curative intent (29 mo vs 22 mo). There was no long-term survivor but four patients remained tumor-free up to 19 mo after APR (n = 1) or LE (n = 3).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Demonstration of patients' T cell responses to BRAF(V600E) would suggest the feasibility of active specific immunotherapy targeting the mutation in these patients. In the present study, BRAF(V600E) peptides with putative binding sites for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2 were used to stimulate T lymphocytes of HLA-A2-positive melanoma patients. Four of five patients with BRAF(V600E)-positive lesions showed lymphoproliferative responses to BRAF(V600E) peptide stimulation. These responses were specific for the mutated epitope and HLA-A2 was restricted in three patients. Lymphocytes from these three patients were cytotoxic against HLA-A2-matched BRAF(V600E)-positive melanoma cells.

Cutaneous melanomas occurred in 164 patients, melanomas of unknown origin in 8, and ocular melanomas in 5. Melanomas constituted 5.2% of posttransplant skin cancers compared with 2.7% in the general population. Unusual features of cutaneous melanomas were that 6 (4%) occurred in children, and 9 (5%) occurred in bone marrow recipients who were treated for leukemia. Forty-four patients (27%) who had cutaneous melanomas also had other skin cancers.

We have investigated the potential contribution of somatic silencing of the p16 gene by DNA methylation in 30 cases of sporadic cutaneous melanoma. The methylation status of the 5' CpG island of p16 was initially determined by Southern analysis and then reevaluated (in a blinded manner) using methylation-specific PCR, methylation-sensitive single nucleotide primer extension, and bisulfite genomic sequencing. All methodologies yielded concordant results, and significant levels of methylation were observed in 3 of the 30 (10%) melanoma DNAs analyzed. Of the three tumors found to be methylated, two were also positive for LOH on 9p21 (where the p16 gene resides), implying that both p16 alleles were inactivated, one via deletion and the other via methylation-associated transcriptional silencing. The association between methylation and transcriptional silencing of p16 was also further supported by inducing p16 expression with a DNA demethylating agent (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) in a melanoma cell line known to harbor a methylated p16 allele. Although methylation-associated gene silencing does not represent a common mechanism for p16 inactivation in sporadic melanoma, our findings provide support that PCR-based techniques, such as methylation-specific PCR and methylation-sensitive single nucleotide primer extension, can be reliably used for the accurate detection and quantitation of aberrant levels of DNA methylation in tumor specimens.",

We therefore asked to what level similarly induced expression of B7 on human melanoma cells would affect the antigen-dependent responses of tumour-specific T cell clones in vitro. Data presented show that B7-1 expression by melanoma lines: (i) significantly induced, or improved, an IL-2-dependent proliferative response of such clones to the antigen; (ii) increased the amount of IL-2 produced by two clones in response to the parental non-transfected tumour cells; and (iii) increased the TNF responses of all the CD4+ clones. However, despite these clear co-stimulatory effects on antigen-induced responses of all T cell clones, which demonstrated an effective interaction of the B7-1 transfected molecule with one or the other of its counter-receptors expressed on T cell clones, B7 co-stimulation did not correct the defect of IL-2 secretion exhibited by many of these clones in response to in vitro antigen presentation by melanoma cells. We further show that defective IL-2 secretion in response to melanoma antigens was not due to a T cell clone refractoriness induced by the culture, since one of these clones could be induced to secrete IL-2 by an antigen-expressing melanoma line, upon increased lymphocyte function associated antigen-3 expression induced by gene transfection. Together these data suggest that defective IL-2 secretion by many tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes clones in response to antigen presentation by melanoma cells in vitro is not exclusively due to the inability of these cells to provide an appropriate co-stimulation through the B7-1 molecule.",

However, variant tumor cells, which do not express MART-1, down-regulate MHC, or become resistant to apoptosis, will escape killing. Cytotoxic lymphocytes kill by two main mechanisms, the perforin/granzyme degranulation pathway and the TNF/Fas/TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand superfamily of apoptosis-inducing ligands. In this study, we examined whether cis-diaminedichloroplatinum (II) cisplatin (CDDP) sensitizes MART-1/HLA A2.1(+) melanoma and melanoma variant tumor cells to non-MHC-restricted, Fas ligand (FasL)-mediated killing by CTL. MART-1(27-35)-specific bulk CTL cultures were generated by pulsing normal PBL with MART-1(27-35) peptide. These CTL cultures specifically kill M202 melanoma cells (MART-1(+), HLA A2.1(+), FasR(-)), and MART-1(27-35) peptide-pulsed T2 cells (FasR(+)), but not M207 melanoma cells (MART-1(+), HLA A2.1(-), FasR(-)), FLU(58-66) peptide-pulsed T2 cells, or DU145 and PC-3 prostate cells (MART-1(-), HLA A2.1(-), FasR(+)). CDDP (0.1-10 microg/ml) sensitized non-MART-1(27-35) peptide-pulsed T2 to the CD8(+) subset of bulk MART-1-specific CTL, and killing was abolished by neutralizing anti-Fas Ab. Furthermore, CDDP up-regulated FasR expression and FasL-mediated killing of M202, and sensitized PC-3 and DU145 to killing by bulk MART-1-specific CTL cultures. These findings demonstrate that drug-mediated sensitization can potentiate FasL-mediated killing by MHC-restricted CTL cell lines, independent of MHC and MART-1 expression on tumor cells. This represents a novel approach for potentially controlling tumor cell variants found in primary heterogeneous melanoma tumor cell populations that would normally escape killing by MART-1-specific immunotherapy.",

On the one hand, advances have been aimed at improving the effectiveness of melanoma vaccines based on a greater understanding of melanoma tumor cell biology. On the other hand, there is increasing evidence that the immune system, our defense against tumors, also inadvertently plays a supportive role in promoting the development and progression of tumors. Hence, two opposing forces 'hanging in the balance' dictate patients' responses to melanoma: tumor cell biology and the status of the immune system. Recent developments in our understanding of both of these aspects have provided new leads and insights for novel ways to improve vaccine design and add to the melanoma vaccine armory. As the focus of immunotherapy shifts its aim towards the tumor microenvironment, we are now developing the ability to program the immune responses raised by vaccination against melanoma. The aim here is to prevent myeloid and regulatory T-cell-mediated immune suppression as well as to counteract tumor-derived factors capable of suppressing immune responses. A redirected strategy for vaccine immunotherapy is proposed based on our greater understanding of tumor immunity. Using a combination therapy of immune-potentiating melanoma vaccines together with adjuvants for overcoming the immunosuppressive forces will allow us to activate protective immunity against melanoma. Other cancer vaccines (i.e. colon or renal) are already offering reasons for hope and expectation that vaccine immunotherapy will also produce successful outcomes for patients with melanoma.",

However, whether melanoma CTC are tumorigenic and cause metastatic progression is currently unknown. Here, we isolate for the first time viable tumorigenic melanoma CTC and demonstrate that this cell population is capable of metastasis formation in human-to-mouse xenotransplantation experiments. The presence of CTC among peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of murine recipients of subcutaneous (s.c.) human melanoma xenografts could be detected based on mRNA expression for human GAPDH and/or ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 5 (ABCB5), a marker of malignant melanoma-initiating cells previously shown to be associated with metastatic disease progression in human patients. ABCB5 expression could also be detected in PBMC preparations from human stage IV melanoma patients but not healthy controls. The detection of melanoma CTC in human-to-mouse s.c. tumor xenotransplantation models correlated significantly with pulmonary metastasis formation. Moreover, prospectively isolated CTC from murine recipients of s.c. melanoma xenografts were capable of primary tumor initiation and caused metastasis formation upon xenotransplantation to secondary murine NOD-scid IL2Rγ(null) recipients. Our results provide initial evidence that melanoma CTC are tumorigenic and demonstrate that CTC are capable of causing metastatic tumor progression.

Nineteen infusions of radiolabeled TIL were given to 18 patients, while five patients received radiolabeled autologous PBL during TIL therapy.

To be successful, this approach depends on the existence of a suppressed immune response against the tumor that can be released by the treatment or alternatively needs to be combined with an immune-enhancing therapy. A tumor-targeted superantigen (TTS) fusion protein utilizes the strong T-cell activating property of bacterial superantigens in concert with the tumor cell binding capacity in antitumor Fab-fragments. Our purpose was to investigate the feasibility of combining anti-CTLA-4 with TTS therapy against the poorly immunogenic B16 mouse melanoma tumor transfected with the human tumor-associated antigen EpCAM recognized by the C215 monoclonal antibody. B16-EpCAM tumors growing in the lung were completely insensitive to anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy. C215Fab-SEA treatment of the B16-EpCAM tumors induced strong infiltration and targeting of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. In parallel, Foxp3(+)CTLA-4(high) regulatory T cells accumulated in the tumors. Combining activation with C215Fab-SEA and anti-CTLA-4 showed greatly enhanced antitumor effects and prolonged long-term survival. In parallel, when the expansion of regulatory T cells was inhibited, the number of specific effector T cells was enhanced and the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity was significantly improved.

We and others have extensively evaluated the PRAME expression in various hematological malignancies and demonstrated high expression of the PRAME gene in subsets of AML, chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma. In addition, we have demonstrated that PRAME was a useful marker for detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients with leukemia, particularly those leukemias in which tumor specific markers are currently unavailable. Since PRAME was first identified as a tumor antigen recognized by T cells, the possibility that PRAME is a leukemia antigen recognized by T cells was evaluated, and it was found that PRAME-positive leukemia cell lines and fresh leukemia cells were susceptible to lysis by the PRAME-specific CTL. Five CTL epitopes associated with either HLA-A*0201 or HLA-A*2402 have recently been identified. It is, therefore, an attractive strategy to apply PRAME specific immunotherapy on patients with PRAME positive leukemia in MRD condition.",

However, tumors of mesenchymal origin such as angiofibroma and collagenoma of the skin have also been associated with the syndrome. This highlights the possibility of an association between MEN 1 and some other types of tumors. Here we report 7 cases of primary malignant melanoma occurring in 7 MEN 1 families, all patients exhibiting classic features of MEN 1. Based on these findings and the previous implication of multiple melanoma tumor suppressor(s) in 11q, including the MEN1 region, we have investigated the involvement of the MEN1 gene in melanoma tumorigenesis. Mutation analysis was performed on a panel of 39 sporadic metastatic melanomas, 13 melanoma cell lines and 20 melanoma families without CDKN2A or CDK4 germline mutations. In addition, 19 sporadic metastatic tumors were screened for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 11q13. LOH was detected in 6 tumors (32%), and in 4 of the tumors the pattern of LOH suggested that the deletion included the MEN1 gene locus. A novel somatic nonsense mutation in exon 7 (Q349X) was identified in 1 sporadic tumor which also showed loss of the wild-type allele. We conclude that the MEN1 gene plays a role in the tumorigenesis of a small subgroup of melanoma.",

Expression of these genes was assayed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry in 23 melanoma tumor specimens and in 25 additional nonmelanoma or nonmalignant specimens. MIA, tyrosinase, and MGSA were expressed in most melanoma specimens. Specificity was highest for MART-1, followed by MIA and tyrosinase. Increasing the number of cycles of amplification from 35 to 40 increased sensitivity but decreased specificity of most markers, though MIA was relatively robust. MIA mRNA was also detected in carcinomas of the colon, ovary, kidney, and head/neck, as well as in normal laryngeal epithelium. Although MIA discriminated melanoma from nonmelanoma at least as well as tyrosinase, no single mRNA marker had accuracy greater than 71%, raising potential concern about application of these particular mRNA markers to the minimal disease setting.

We aimed to detect clinical biomarkers to identify high-risk stage IIIB melanoma patients.;We performed retrospective analysis of stage IIIB melanoma patients who underwent lymph node dissection (LND) in our institution between 2000 and 2015.

The binding of anti-alphaGal Ab to cells expressing alphaGal triggers a complement-mediated hyperacute rejection of target cells. The hyperacute rejection of whole cancer cells, modified to express alphaGal epitopes, could be exploited as a new cancer vaccine to treat human cancers. We tested this hypothesis in alphaGalactosyltransferase knockout (alphaGT KO) mice which, like humans, do not express alphaGal on their cell surfaces and can produce anti-alphaGal Ab. Forty-five percent of mice with preexisting anti-alphaGal Ab rejected alphaGal positive melanoma cells (B16alphaGal). These mice remained tumor-free for more than 90 days. The majority of control mice injected with B16Null, alphaGal negative cells succumbed to melanoma. The rejection of B16alphaGal induced strong long-lasting antitumor immunity against B16Null measured by the expansion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. In addition, mice rejecting B16alphaGal were protected against melanoma since they survived a second rechallenge with B16Null. Protected mice developed antitumor immunity in the absence of autoimmune depigmentation (vitiligo). These results show that rejection of alphaGal positive melanoma cells can efficiently boost the immune response to other tumor associated antigens present in alphaGal negative melanoma cells. This study supports the concept of a novel anticancer vaccine to treat human malignancies.",

In the present study we have used long-term cultures of human melanoma cells and autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes to examine the influence of cytokines with T cell growth activity on the phenotype and cytotoxic and proliferative response of T cells to melanoma. It was found that addition of interleukin-4 (IL-4) inhibited the response of CD8+ T cells and promoted the response of the CD4 subset. IL-2 or IL-7 was effective in increasing melanoma-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity in cultures where CD8 T cells were predominant, whereas IL-4 followed by IL-2 was most effective in cultures where CD4 T cells predominated. IL-10 or IL-12 inhibited proliferation and CTL activity against melanoma in long-term cultures. The effects of IL-12 were reproduced in long-term cultures of T cells stimulated with mAb against CD3 and were shown to depend on prior exposure of T cells to IL-12 before IL-2. As yet unidentified factors, such as co-factor expression on melanoma, appear to be as important as exogenous cytokines in determining the nature of T cell responses to melanoma.

Available treatments can induce objective tumor regression in a small percent of patients, but these responses are not always associated with improved long-term survival. The resistance of melanoma to therapy and its predestined recurrence are related to the genetic heterogeneity and genomic instability of the tumor. For many years these genetic alterations were thought to be linked to the accumulation of random mutations in functionally differentiated cells which transform them into malignant cells that have lost their ability to differentiate and have acquired drug resistance. In the last few years it has been largely demonstrated that melanoma as other solid tumors contains a subpopulation of cells (CSCs) considered the source of the primary tumor mass, of new tumor nodules and responsible for drug resistance and cancer recurrence.
