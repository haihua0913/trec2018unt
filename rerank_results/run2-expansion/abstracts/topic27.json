In this paper we present the phenotype-genotype correlation of 20 unrelated Chinese families with 15 cases of MEN2A and five cases of MEN2B.;Cross-sectional study.;A total of 147 members from the 20 families were included. Among them, 119 family members were from MEN2A pedigrees (including 15 MEN2A probands) and 28 members from MEN2B pedigrees (including five MEN2B probands).;Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leucocytes and was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). DNA analysis for RET mutations in exons 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 16 was performed with specific primers.;Thirty-seven MEN2A and five MEN2B patients were identified as having RET mutations. The incidence of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), pheochromocytoma (PCC) and hyperparathyroidism (HPT) in the 37 MEN2A patients was 91.9, 56.8 and 10.8%, respectively; the onset of MTC in MEN2A patients was earlier than that of PCC and HPT. Five germline mutations, all located at codon 634 of exon11 in the RET proto-oncogene, were detected in all of the 37 MEN2A patients. The highest frequency of the five germline mutations was C634Y (46.7%), followed by C634R (26.7%), C634W (13.3%), C634F (6.7%) and C634S (6.7%). No statistical significance was found between the incidence of PCC and different genotypes of codon 634 in MEN2A patients, whereas the incidence of HPT was closely associated with C634R and C634Y. The gene mutation (M918T) at exon16 of the RET proto-oncogene was present in five MEN2B probands.;RET proto-oncogene mutations were restricted to codon 634 and 918 in Chinese families with MEN2A and MEN2B. In general the genetic characteristics of these patients with MEN2A and MEN2B reflect the general pattern around the world and it remains to be determined with larger studies in China whether Chinese patients have a different genetic pattern of mutations.",

To investigate the spectrum of RET mutations among Japanese patients, we screened the RET gene in 71 patients with thyroid carcinomas. The panel included representatives of 44 families carrying FMTC or MEN2, 22 sporadic medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTCs), and five MTCs without familial information. Mutations in nucleotide sequences encoding one of three specific cysteine residues in the extracellular domain of the RET protein were found in 33 of the 34 MEN2A patients and in five of the six FMTC patients examined. A mutation at codon 918, causing the substitution of threonine for methionine in the tyrosine kinase domain of the protein, was found in germline DNAs of all four patients with MEN2B and in two of the 22 patients with sporadic MTCs; codon 918 was mutated somatically in tumor DNAs from three other sporadic cases. Germline mutations of codon 768, GAG to GAC (Glu to Asp), were detected in one FMTC, in one patient with sporadic MTC, and in one of the patients without familial information. Two somatic mutations, an Asp to Gly substitution at codon 631 and a Cys to Arg substitution at codon 634, had not been reported previously. Of five germline mutations found among the 22 sporadic cases, four were confirmed as de novo mutations since in each case neither parent carried the mutation. As nearly one-fourth of the patients with sporadic MTCs carried germline mutations and 50% of their children are expected to develop MTC and other endocrine tumors, these results indicated the importance of careful clinical surveillance of family members of any patient with MTC.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The RET (rearranged during transfection) protooncogene encodes a single pass transmembrane receptor that is expressed in cells derived from the neural crest and the urogenital tract. As part of a cell-surface complex, RET binds glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) ligands in conjunction with GDNF-family alpha co-receptors (GFRalpha). Ligand-induced activation induces dimerization and tyrosine phosphorylation of the RET receptor with downstream activation of several signal transduction pathways. Activating germline RET mutations play a central role in the development of the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes MEN2A, MEN2B, and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) and also in the development of the congenital abnormality Hirschsprung's disease. Approximately 50% of patients with sporadic MTC have somatic RET mutations, and a significant portion of papillary thyroid carcinomas result from chromosomal inversions or translocations, which activate RET (RET/PTC oncogenes). The RET protooncogene has a significant place in cancer prevention and treatment. Timely thyroidectomy in kindred members who have inherited a mutated RET allele, characteristic of MEN2A, MEN2B, or FMTC, can prevent MTC, the most common cause of death in these syndromes. Also, recently developed molecular therapeutics that target the RET pathway have shown activity in clinical trials of patients with advanced MTC, a disease for which there has been no effective therapy.",

The aim of this study was to characterize the RET mutational spectrum in MEN2 families and apparently sporadic MTC (AS-MTC) cases originating from the central region of Portugal.;We studied a total of 82 individuals (64 affected and 18 family members), comprising five MEN2 families (four MEN2A and one MEN2B), as well as 53 AS-MTC cases. RET germline mutations were screened using PCR-DNA sequencing, SSCP and RFLP. The haplotypes associated with recurrent mutations were determined by fragment analysis of microsatellite markers, and by RFLP, in the case of intragenic polymorphisms.;Frequency of the Cys611Tyr (TGC-TAC) mutation was significantly increased in this region of Portugal, due to the fact that three apparently unrelated MEN2A/FMTC families, out of the five in which mutations were identified, harboured this specific mutation. Haplotype analysis revealed that a common haplotype was shared between two of these three families. We have also characterized a novel RET mutation, Arg886Trp, located in the tyrosine kinase domain, which was found in an AS-MTC case.;There are regional specificities in the relative frequency of RET mutations, which are consistent with a cluster-like distribution of specific disease-causing mutations, as a result of the inheritance of a shared haplotype.

MTC has autosomal dominant inheritance and accounts for 5-10 % of all thyroid cancers. It occurs in hereditary (25 %, hMTC) and sporadic (75 %, sMTC) forms. Gain-of-function mutations in the REarranged during transfection (RET) proto-oncogene have been identified in 98 % of hMTC and 50 % of sMTC. The aim of this investigation was to identify mutation(s) in the much conserved RET exon10 in Iranian MTC patients. We started screening patients with MTC for RET in 2001. This study included 347 individuals (154 with sMTC, 38 with FMTC, 8 with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A [MEN2A], 3 with MEN2B, and 3 with pheochromocytoma; 207 index cases and 140 relatives). Germline mutation screening of RET exon10 was performed with PCR-DNA sequencing. A total of 14 missense mutations (10 mutations in men and 4 in women) were identified in cysteine codons 611, 618, and 620 (exon10) in 11 patients and three first-degree relatives as follows: four C611Y (three with FMTC and one relative), one C618R (FMTC), one C618S (sMTC), one C620G (sMTC), four C620R (one with FMTC and three with sMTC), and three C620F (one with FMTC and two relatives). In the present study, six different mutations were identified in exon10 of RET in 14 patients with sMTC and FMTC that were restricted to codons 611, 618, and 620, but not in codon 609. This data showed a skewed pattern of RET exon10 mutation compared to other populations. No mutation was found for MEN2A, MEN2B, and pheochromocytoma in exon10 in this population. In the most common mutations in exon10, the FMTC and sMTC patients were C611Y and C620R, respectively.",

In these cases, MTC is part of an inherited cancer syndrome that has three distinct forms: MEN2A, MEN2B and familial MTC (FMTC). MEN2A is the most frequent syndrome, followed by FMTC and MEN2B. In 95% of MEN2A families and 85% of FMTC families, the germ-line missense mutations underlying the disease affect one of the five cysteine codons of the extracellular domain of the RET proto-oncogene. The mutated codons are 609, 611, 618 and 620 in exon 10, and 634 in exon 11. The most frequent mutations (80% in MEN2A, and 50% in FMTC) occur in codon 634. In our laboratory, the mutations of the codon 634 was detected by two independent methods: DNA sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism with polymerase chain reaction (PCR-RFLP). We have so far examined 105 persons at risk and found 19 positive cases. A positive genetic diagnosis allows preventive thyroidectomy, with a resultant cause-specific survival similar to that for the general population. In the event of a negative result, the family members of the affected proband are relieved of the physical and emotional consequences of the disease and the follow-up procedures.

Approximately 40 percent of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) typically have either intrachromosomal or extrachromosomal rearrangements that join the promoter and NH(2)-terminal domains of unrelated genes to the COOH-terminal fragment of RET. The RET point mutations associated with MEN2A, MEN2B, or FMTC, or the chromosomal breakpoints and translocations associated with PTC, typically activate the RET receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). RET kinase inhibitors are likely to be beneficial for patients with hereditary MTC, where currently there is no effective chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Recently, the low molecular weight tyrosine kinase inhibitor ZD6474 was found to block the enzymatic activity of RET-derived oncoproteins in cultured cell lines. We have developed a Drosophila model for MEN2A and MEN2B diseases by targeting oncogenic forms of RET to the developing Drosophila eye. Here we show that, when fed orally, ZD6474 suppressed RET-mediated phenotypes within the context of this in vivo model. Importantly, ZD6474 showed high efficacy and very low toxicity. This compound failed to significantly suppress an activated form of another RTK, the Drosophila epidermal growth factor receptor, nor did it suppress the activity of downstream components of the RET/Ras pathway. Our results support the view that targeting chemical kinase inhibitors such as ZD6474 to tissues with oncogenic forms of RET is a useful treatment strategy for RET-dependent carcinomas.",

Several TK inhibitors have been tested in clinical trials, but it is unknown which inhibitor is most effective and whether there is any specificity for particular RET mutations.;We aimed to compare the effect of four TK inhibitors (axitinib, sunitinib, vandetanib, and XL184) on cell proliferation, RET expression and autophosphorylation, and ERK activation in cell lines expressing a MEN2A (MTC-TT), a MEN2B (MZ-CRC-1) mutation, and a RET/PTC (TPC-1) rearrangement.;The three cell lines were cultured and treated with the four TK inhibitors. Effects on cell proliferation and RET and ERK expression and activation were determined.;XL184 and vandetanib most effectively inhibited cell proliferation, RET autophosphorylation in combination with a reduction of RET expression, and ERK phosphorylation in MTC-TT and MZ-CRC-1, respectively. TPC-1 cells showed a decrease in RET autophosphorylation after treatment with XL184, but no effect was observed on ERK activation.;There is indeed specificity for different RET mutations, with XL184 being the most potent inhibitor in MEN2A and PTC and vandetanib the most effective in MEN2B in vitro.

MTC is generally associated with a favorable prognosis when diagnosed during childhood, where it frequently occurs secondary to activating mutations in the RET proto-oncogene and arises from pre-existing C-cell hyperplasia. MEN2A accounts for 90-95% of childhood MTC cases and is most commonly due to mutations in codon 634 of RET. MEN2B is associated with the most aggressive clinical presentation of MTC and is almost always due to the Met918Thr mutation of RET. Surgery is the primary treatment and only chance of cure, although the advent of targeted therapies seems to be improving progression-free survival in advanced cases. Since the discovery of the role of RET in MEN2A, considerable advances in the management of this syndrome have occurred, and most of the children with MEN2A who have undergone early thyroidectomy will now lead full, productive lives. Strong genotype-phenotype correlations have facilitated the development of guidelines for interventions. Contemporary approaches for deciding the appropriate age at which surgery should take place incorporate data from ultrasonography and calcitonin measurements in addition to the results of genotyping.

Both pheochromocytomas and ganglioneuromas originate from neural crest cells. Interestingly, two mouse models of MEN2B exhibit adrenal ganglioneuroma formation. One mouse model develops only ganglioneuromas (but not pheochromocytomas) and expresses only one of the oncogenic RET isoforms.

        "Doc_abstract":"During the last two decades, there has been a marked expansion of our knowledge of both the basic and clinical aspects of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2). There are two clinically distinct types of MEN2 syndrome, termed MEN2A and MEN2B. Within MEN2A, there are four variants: (i) classical MEN2A, represented by the uniform presence of MTC and the less frequent occurrence of pheochromocytoma, or primary hyperparathyroidism, or both; (ii) MEN2A with cutaneous lichen amyloidosis; (iii) MEN2A with Hirschsprung's disease; and (iv) familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC), i.e., families or individuals with only MTC. MEN2B is associated with MTC, pheochromocytoma, and mucosal neuromas. Hereditary MTC is caused by autosomal dominant gain of function mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. Specific RET mutations may suggest a predilection toward a particular phenotype and clinical course with a strong genotype-phenotype correlation. Based upon these genotype-phenotype correlations, RET mutations are now stratified into three risk levels, i.e., highest, high, and moderate risk, based on the penetrance and aggressiveness of the MTC. Children in the highest risk category should undergo thyroidectomy in their first year of life, and perhaps even in their first months of life. Children in the high-risk category should have ultrasound of the neck and calcitonin (CTN) measurement performed prior to thyroidectomy. Thyroidectomy should typically be performed at the age of 5 or earlier, depending on the presence of elevated serum CTN levels. However, heterogeneity in disease expression and progression within these groups varies considerably. To personalize disease management, the decision regarding the age of prophylactic thyroidectomy is no longer based upon genotype alone but is currently driven by additional clinical data, the most important being serum CTN levels; specifically, the decision to perform thyroidectomy should err on the safe side if the CTN level is elevated but below 30 pg/ml, especially in the moderate risk group. Personalized management also includes decisions about the best age to begin biochemical screening for pheochromocytoma and primary hyperparathyroidism. ",

Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), a malignant tumor arising from calcitonin-secreting thyroid C cells, is the cardinal disease feature of this syndrome, and mortality in affected MEN-2 patients is mainly caused by this malignancy. Germ-line mutations of the RET protooncogene, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, are responsible for these three neoplastic-prone disorders. MEN2 mutations convert the RET protooncogene in a dominantly acting oncogene as a consequence of the ligand-independent activation of the tyrosine kinase. The majority of MEN2A and FMTC mutations are located in the extracellular domain and cause the replacement of one of five juxtamembrane cysteines by a different amino acid. To examine whether expression of a MEN2A allele of RET results in transformation of C cells, we have used the transgenic approach. Expression of the RET gene altered by a MEN2A mutation was targeted in C cells by placing the transgene under the control of the calcitonin gene-related peptide/calcitonin promoter. Animals of three independent transgenic mouse lines, which expressed the transgene in the thyroid, displayed overt bilateral C cell hyperplasia as early as 3 weeks of age and subsequently developed multifocal and bilateral MTC. Moreover, these tumors were morphologically and biologically similar to human MTC which afflicts MEN2 individuals. These findings provide evidence that the MEN2A mutant form of RET is oncogenic in parafollicular C cells and suggest that these transgenic mice should prove a valuable animal model for hereditary MTC.",

This study investigated the spectrum of germline RET mutations and clinical features in Chinese hereditary MTC patients. A total of 53 family members from 11 different hereditary MTC families were recruited for detection of RET exon 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, and 16 mutations, in genomic DNA from peripheral blood leucocytes using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct DNA sequencing. Of the 53 participants, eight different germline RET mutations were detected in 37 individuals. These RET mutations were distributed in exons 10, 11, 13, and 16. The most frequent RET mutation was localized at exon 11 codon 634 (67.6 %; 25/37) and the most prevalent mutation was C634R (37.8 %; 14/37). The most frequent phenotype was multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A). The incidences of MTC, pheochromocytoma, and hyperparathyroidism in the MEN2A patients were 100, 36.4 and 18.2 %, respectively. The phenotype of families with Y606C or L790F mutation was categorized as familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. Moreover, one proband was identified with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B and carried a de novo mutation of M918T. Two families with C618S/Y mutation were categorized as unclassified multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. Our results further substantiate that most germline mutations of the RET proto-oncogene were localized at codon 634 in Chinese hereditary MTC patients and carriers. RET mutation at codon 634 was always associated to the phenotype of MEN2A. Screening of RET mutations should be probably limited to exons 10, 11, 13 and 16 initially to be cost-effective in China.",

The new mutations were present in the germ-line DNA of four unrelated patients for whom a family history of MTC had not been documented.

In particular, MEN2A is a more complex and aggressive disease than FMTC, being characterized by pheochromocytomas and parathyroid alterations, in addition to medullary thyroid carcinomas. The mutations associated with MEN2A and FMTC affect one of five cysteine residues mapping in the extracellular domain of the Ret protein. However, recent studies have indicated that MEN2A and FMTC disease phenotypes correlate with the position of mutations in RET. Mutations of Cys-634 are more frequent in families with MEN2A, whereas Cys-620 mutations are very rarely found in MEN2A patients and, in contrast, are frequently found in FMTC patients. We have reported previously that mutations of Cys-634 constitutively activate the RET transforming potential by causing a disulfide bridge-mediated homodimerization. Here, we report that the mutation Cys-620 --> Tyr is able to cause a constitutive dimerization of Ret, with consequent activation of its kinase and transforming activities, to a lower extent than mutation of Cys-634. We suggest that the difference in ability to activate RET shown by mutations associated with FMTC and MEN2A represents the molecular basis of the phenotypic diversity between the two syndromes.",

There are three subtypes, namely, MEN2A (multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A), MEN2B (multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B), and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. The variations in the RET gene play an important role in the MEN2 syndromes. In this work, we have developed a RET oligonucleotide microarray of 67 oligonucleotides to quickly detect RET mutations in MEN2 syndromes. The predominant RET mutations are missense mutations and are restricted to nine codons (codons 609, 611, 618, 620, 630, 634, 768, 804, and 918) in MEN2 syndromes. Missense mutations at codons 609, 611, 618, 620, and 634 have been identified in 98% of MEN2A families and in 85% of familial medullary thyroid carcinoma families. More than 95% of MEN2B patients also had a predominant mutation type at codon 918 (Met-->Thr). RET oligonucleotide microarray can detect RET missense mutations at these nine codons. Theoretically, a total of 55 missense mutation types can occur at eight codons (codons 609, 611, 618, 620, 630, 634, 768, and 804). RET oligonucleotide microarray is designed to detect all of these 55 missense mutation types at these eight codons and one predominant type at codon 918. Fifty-six oligonucleotides were designed for the 56 mutation types at nine codons, and 11 oligonucleotides were designed for the wild types and positive controls. We found RET mutations in all eight of the Korean MEN2A families (a total of 75 members; 27 affected members, 19 gene carriers, and 29 unaffected members) using the developed RET oligonucleotide microarray and an automatic sequencing. Because we found only five mutation types from eight MEN2A families, the international collaborations are required to see whether the RET oligonucleotide microarray may be used as a genetic diagnostic tool. Taken together, the RET oligonucleotide microarray can function as a fast and reliable genetic diagnostic device, which simplifies the process of detecting RET mutations.",

In MEN-associated CCH and small MTC, bcl-2 was strongly expressed, bcl-x was moderately expressed and bax was only weakly expressed. Advanced tumours and LNM did show a more heterogeneous bcl-2 staining accompanied by an increased bax expression and accelerated proliferation. The rate of apoptosis was extremely low in all investigated tumours. P53 was detectable in three patients with rapidly growing and extensively metastasising MTC. No somatic p53 mutations were found. Hereditary MTC with germline RET mutations at codon 918 (MEN2b) and codon 634 revealed a bias towards a higher proliferation activity at a younger age and are more frequently accompanied by LNM. CCH and MTC are characterised with a preponderance of bcl-2 as a factor blocking the programmed cell death. While MTC, in general, is a slowly growing tumour, a minority of tumours do progress rapidly with high proliferation. The factors leading to an accelerated tumour progression do not seem to take their effect via the regulation of apoptosis. Certain alterations of RET are supposed to have a direct or indirect implication on proliferation and, because of this, an effect on the clinical course.",

Using a proteomic-multiplexed analysis of the phosphotyrosine signaling together with antibody-based validation techniques, we identified several candidate molecules for RET (rearranged during transfection) tyrosine kinase receptor carrying mutations responsible for the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A and 2B (MEN2A and MEN2B) syndromes in two human medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) cell lines, TT and MZ-CRC-1, which express the RET-MEN2A and RET-MEN2B oncoproteins, respectively. Signaling elements downstream of these oncoproteins were identified after treating cells with the indolinone tyrosine kinase inhibitor RPI-1 to knock down RET phosphorylation activity. We detected 23 and 18 affinity-purified phosphotyrosine proteins in untreated TT and MZ-CRC-1 cells, respectively, most of which were shared and sensitive to RPI-1 treatment. However, our data clearly point to specific signaling features of the RET-MEN2A and RET-MEN2B oncogenic pathways. Moreover, the detection of high-level expression of minimally phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in both TT and MZ-CRC-1 cells, together with our data on the effects of EGF stimulation on the proteomic profiles and the response to Gefitinib treatment, suggest the relevance of EGFR signaling in these cell lines, especially since analysis of 14 archival MTC specimens revealed EGFR mRNA expression in all samples.

To better understand the role of the activated RET oncogene in neural crest cells, we transfected two adherent human neuroblastoma tumor cell lines with oncogenic MEN2 mutant RET cDNAs.

Both control and MEN2B cells formed tumors at the site of injection in all cases. However, mice injected with MEN2B cells developed lung metastases at a much higher frequency than control mice. Only RET protein derived from MEN2A transfectant cells had increased autokinase activity, whereas MEN2B transfectant cells demonstrated selective activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase, Jun kinase-1 (Jnk1).

To investigate the genetic cause in a Chinese Han family with MEN2A and the genotype-phenotype correlations, nine members belonging to 3 generations of MEN2A family with 5 affected subjects underwent genetic analysis. Standard GTG-banded karyotype analysis and sequencing of the RET and NTRK1 genes were performed to identify the genetic cause of this family.

The phenotype of patients was that of classic MEN2A, characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma and phaeochromocytoma. The clinical features of all cases with RET mutations varied greatly, including onset age of clinical manifestations, severity and comorbidities. Thus, this study not only identified the hereditary nature of the MEN2A in the cases, but also discovered a family member harboring the same p.Cys634Arg mutation, who was unaware of his condition.

Some cases of sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) have also been reported to have mutations in the RET gene. However, two previous reports have given discrepant results on the frequency of the mutations in RET in sporadic MTCs in Japan. To clarify this problem, we analyzed mutations in RET exon 16 in 72 sporadic MTCs by means of the two methods used in the previous studies, direct sequencing and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Mutations in exon 16 were detected in only 2 of 72 cases of sporadic MTC. These results suggest that when a MTC has a mutation in RET exon 16, it is more likely to be a hereditary MTC than a sporadic one in Japan.",

Mutations in the RET protooncogene are known to be the cause of the MEN2A and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) syndromes in the majority of the families. Direct DNA testing allows prophylactic thyroidectomy to be offered to individuals carrying a mutation in the above codons, and in mutation-negative cases it reduces the yearly screening-related burden on family members at risk of the disease. By DNA sequencing and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphisms, 65 MTC probands were examined for mutations in residues 609, 611, 618, 620 of exon 10, and in residues 634, 768, 804 of exons 11, 13, and 14 respectively of the RET protooncogene. In our study, mutations in the above codons were detected in all of the 14 clinically MEN2A and FMTC families. One of these mutations, TGC609 TCC has not been reported previously. Of the 14 probands with the mutation, 25 relatives also had the identified mutation and 18 relatives proved to be non-carriers. Among the 51 probands with clinically sporadic MTC, none was found to carry a mutation in the above positions even if indirect signs of MTC, pheochromocytoma or hyperparathyroidism could be detected in some families. The frequency of the TGC634AGC mutation is unexpectedly high in our samples, which can probably be attributed to a founder effect. We conclude that screening for mutations in these codons is effective in families fulfilling the strict clinical criteria of MEN2A or FMTC.",

The close proximity to the plasma membrane of the affected cysteine residues prompted us to investigate the possible role of the transmembrane (TM) domain of RET (RET-TM) in receptor-receptor interactions underlying dimer formation. Strong self-association of the RET-TM was observed in a biological membrane. Mutagenesis studies indicated the involvement of the evolutionary conserved residues Ser-649 and Ser-653 in RET-TM oligomerization. Unexpectedly, RET-TM interactions were also abrogated in the A639G/A641R double mutant, first identified in a sporadic case of MTC. In agreement with this, no transforming activity could be detected in full-length RET carrying the A639G and A641R mutations, which remained fully responsive to glial cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) stimulation. When introduced in the context of C634R - a cysteine replacement that is prevalent in MEN2A cases - the A639G/A641R mutations significantly reduced dimer formation and transforming activity in this otherwise highly oncogenic RET variant. These data suggest that a strong propensity to self-association in the RET-TM underlies - and may be required for - dimer formation and oncogenic activation of juxtamembrane cysteine mutants of RET, and explains the close proximity to the plasma membrane of cysteine residues implicated in MEN2A and MTC syndromes.",

However, insufficient PTK signaling may be responsible for developmental diseases. Gain of function of the RET receptor PTK is associated with human cancer. At the germline level, point mutations of RET are responsible for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2A, MEN2B, and FMTC). Mutations of extracellular cysteines are found in MEN2A patients, and a Met918Thr mutation is responsible for most MEN2B cases. At the somatic level, gene rearrangements juxtaposing the tyrosine kinase domain of RET to heterologous gene partners are found in papillary carcinomas of the thyroid. These rearrangements generate the chimeric RET/PTC oncogenes. Both MEN2 mutations and PTC gene rearrangements potentiate the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of RET and, ultimately, the RET downstream signaling events. A multidocking site of the C-tail of RET is essential for both mitogenic and survival RET signaling. Such a site is involved in the recruitment of several intracellular molecules, such as the Shc, FRS2, IRS1, Gab1/2, and Enigma. The different activating mutations not only potentiate the enzymatic activity of the RET kinase but also may alter qualitatively RET signaling properties by: (1) altering RET autophosphorylation (in the case of the MEN2B mutation), (2) modifying the subcellular distribution of the active kinase, and (3) providing the active kinase with a scaffold for novel protein-protein interactions (as in the case of RET/PTC oncoproteins). This review describes the molecular mechanisms by which the different genetic alterations cause the conversion of RET into a dominant transforming oncogene.",

Somatic rearrangements of the RET gene generating the chimeric RET/papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) oncogenes are the predominant molecular lesions associated with papillary carcinoma, the most frequent thyroid malignancy in humans. Oncogenic mutations cause constitutive activation of the kinase function of RET, which, in turn, results in the autophosphorylation of RET tyrosine residues critical for signaling. In vitro kinase assays previously revealed six putative RET autophosphorylation sites. The aim of the present study was to assess the phosphorylation of two such residues, tyrosines 1015 and 1062 (Y1015 and Y1062), in the in vivo signaling of RET and RET-derived oncogenes. Using phosphorylated RET-specific antibodies, we demonstrate that both Y1015 and Y1062 are rapidly phosphorylated upon ligand triggering of RET. Moreover, regardless of the nature of the underlying activating mutation, the concomitant phosphorylation of Y1015 and Y1062 is a common feature of the various oncogenic RET products (MEN2A, MEN2B, and PTC). This study shows that Ab-pY1062 is a useful tool with which to detect activated RET in human tumor cells and surgical samples. Finally, the microinjection of Ab-pY1062 antibodies into living cells demonstrates that Ret/PTC1 signaling is required to maintain the mitogenesis of a human carcinoma cell line expressing the Ret/PTC1 oncoprotein.",

The method also permits the exclusion of further screening for family members at very low risk.

Canadine, which is a structural analogue of berberine, showed little interaction with RET G-quadruplex and also had no effect on RET expression in MTC TT cells. The down-regulation of RET with berberine further inhibited the cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest and activation of apoptosis in TT cells, which was confirmed by a 2-fold increase in the caspase-3 activity and the down-regulation of cell-cycle regulatory proteins.;Our data strongly suggest that the G-quadruplex forming region and the stabilization of this structure play a critical role in mediating the repressive effect of berberine on RET transcription.",

MEN2B is a rare syndrome, its phenotype may usually, but not always, be noted by the physician. In the infant none of the MEN2B characteristics are present, except by early gastrointestinal dysfunction caused by intestinal neuromas. When available, genetic analysis confirms the diagnosis and guides pre-operative evaluation and extent of surgery. Here we report four cases of MEN2B in which the late diagnosis had a significant impact in clinical evolution and, potentially, in overall survival.;We report four cases, 2 men and 2 women, with differences in their phenotypes and with a late diagnosis. The first case has a history of severe gastrointestinal obstruction requiring a surgery intervention two days after his birth. The second told had nodules in the oral mucosa and constipation since childhood. The third case referred a history of constipation from birth until 5 months of life. The fourth has had a history of chronic constipation since childhood.;New concepts have emerged since the RET oncogene was identified in 1993 as the responsible gene for hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma. The majority of MEN2B individuals have M918T mutation in the exon 16 of RET, with a few cases having a mutation A883F or the association of V804M with E805K, Y806C or S904C mutations. The consensus classifies the RET mutation in codon 918 as of highest risk and recommends total thyroidectomy and central lymph node dissection until 6 months after birth. A fast and precise diagnosis is essential to reach these goals. The identification of early manifestations such as intestinal ganglioneuromatosis and oral mucosal neuromas should prompt the physician to initiate an investigation for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B.;The diagnosis of MEN2B is very important to allow appropriate investigation of associated diseases and to allow counseling and appropriate screening of relatives for a RET mutation. Even patients with MEN2B, which often have typical physical features, may not be properly recognized and be followed as a sporadic case. Based on this, all suspicious cases of multiple endocrine neoplasia should undergo a molecular genetic test.",

Here, we report increased expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-2 (MKP-2) in carcinomas developed in transgenic mice carrying RET with the MEN2A mutation (RET-MEN2A). The expression of MKP-2 was not only induced by RET-MEN2A or RET-MEN2B mutant proteins but also by the activation of endogenous RET by its ligand, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). MKP-2 expression was also evident in the MKK-f cell line, which was established from a mammary tumor developed in a RET-MEN2A transgenic mouse. Inhibition of MKP-2 attenuated the in vitro and in vivo proliferation of MKK-f cells, which was mediated by the suppression of cyclin B1 expression. Furthermore, we found that MKP-2 is highly expressed in medullary thyroid carcinomas derived from MEN2A patients. These findings suggest that the increased expression of MKP-2 may play a crucial role in oncogenic signaling downstream of mutant RET, leading to deregulation of cell cycle.",

A 48-year-old man presented with cervical lymphadenopathy and was found to have metastatic MTC involving cervical and mediastinal lymph nodes. He underwent thyroidectomy and debulking of metastatic disease. The resected thyroid showed bilateral MTC and a 1-cm PTC.

Both tumors were analyzed for the BRAF (Val600Glu) mutation and the RET/PTC1 translocation. The PTC was positive for the BRAF mutation but negative for RET/PTC1. The MTC was negative for both abnormalities. We conclude that the MTC was caused by the germline RET mutation, while the PTC was caused by a somatic BRAF mutation.

RET gene rearrangements, which lead to the generation of chimeric RET/papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) oncogenes, occur in PTC, whereas RET point mutations occur in familial multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) and sporadic medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTC). We showed previously that the expression of the receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase J (PTPRJ) is suppressed in neoplastically transformed follicular thyroid cells. We now report that PTPRJ coimmunoprecipitates with wild-type RET and with the MEN2A-associated RET(C634R) oncoprotein but not with the RET/PTC1 and RET-MEN2B isoforms. Using mutated forms of PTPRJ and RET-MEN2A, we show that the integrity of the respective catalytic domains is required for the PTPRJ/RET-MEN2A interaction. PTPRJ expression induces dephosphorylation of the RET(C634R) and, probably via an indirect mechanism, RET/PTC1 oncoproteins on two key RET autophosphorylation sites (Tyr1062 and Tyr905). This results in a significant decrease of RET-induced Shc and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation levels. In line with this finding, adoptive PTPRJ expression reduced the oncogenic activity of RET(C634R) in an in vitro focus formation assay of NIH3T3 cells. As expected from the coimmunoprecipitation results, the RET(M918T) oncoprotein, which is associated to MEN2B and sporadic MTC, was resistant to the dephosphorylating activity of PTPRJ. Taken together, these findings identify RET as a novel substrate of PTPRJ and suggest that PTPRJ expression levels may affect tumor phenotype associated with RET/PTC1 and RET(C634R) mutants. On the other hand, resistance to PTPRJ may be part of the mechanism of RET oncogenic conversion secondary to the M918T mutation.",

Cytogenetic analyses of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), a neoplasm which originates from thyrocytes, have revealed that somatic rearrangements of the RET gene are involved in the etiology of a significant proportion of this tumour. Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) which arises from neural-crest derived C-cells is the cardinal disease feature of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2), a dominantly inherited cancer syndrome. Recent studies have provided evidence that germline mutations of the RET gene are the underlying genetic events responsible for MEN 2. This review focuses on the role of RET mutations in the pathogenesis of PTC and MTC and summarizes our present knowledge on the consequences of these alterations on the RET tyrosine kinase function. We further describe a transgenic mouse model for hereditary MTC. Mice carrying a MEN 2A allele of RET under the control of the CGRP/calcitonin promoter develop bilateral and multifocal MTC, morphologically and biologically similar to human MTC.",

ZD6474 (vandetanib) is an ATP-competitive inhibitor of RET, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptors kinases. In this study, we have studied ZD6474 mechanism of action in TT and MZ-CRC-1 human MTC cell lines, carrying cysteine 634 to tryptophan (C634W) and methionine 918 to threonine (M918T) RET mutation respectively. ZD6474 blunted MTC cell proliferation and RET, Shc and p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation. Single receptor knockdown by RNA interference showed that MTC cells depended on RET for proliferation. Adoptive expression of the ZD6474-resistant V804M RET mutant rescued proliferation of TT cells under ZD6474 treatment, showing that RET is a key ZD6474 target in these MTC cells. Upon RET inhibition, adoptive stimulation of EGFR partially rescued TT cell proliferation, MAPK signaling, and expression of cell-cycle-related genes. This suggests that simultaneous inhibition of RET and EGFR by ZD6474 may overcome the risk of MTC cells to escape from RET blockade through compensatory over-activation of EGFR.",

Recently, we have identified somatic inactivating mutations in the cell cycle inhibitor gene P18 in human MTC, which coincided with activating RET mutations, suggesting a role for loss of P18 in combination with oncogenic RET in the multistep process of MTC development. Therefore, we crossed transgenic mice expressing oncogenic RET (RET2B) with mice lacking p18 (and p27, another cell cycle inhibitor) and monitored MTC development. RET2B;p18(+/-) mice and RET2B;p18(-/-) mice developed MTC with a highly increased incidence compared with their corresponding single mutant littermates. In addition, expression of oncogenic RET causes an earlier age of onset and larger MTCs in p18(-/-);p27(+/-) mice. In a subset of MTCs of RET2B;p18(+/-)(;p27(+/-)) mice, p18(Ink4c) expression was completely lost. This loss of p18(Ink4c) expression correlated with higher proliferation rates as well as with larger MTCs, indicating that loss of p18 in combination with oncogenic RET not only increases the risk for MTC development but also enhances MTC progression.

Although RET mutation is likely sufficient to cause C-cell hyperplasia, the precursor lesion to MTC, tumor progression is thought to be due to clonal expansion caused by the accumulation of somatic events. Using the genome-scanning technique comparative genomic hybridization, we identified chromosomal imbalances that occur in MTC including deletions of chromosomes 1p, 3q26.3-q27, 4, 9q13-q22, 13q, and 22q and amplifications of chromosome 19.

We performed genetic analysis by direct RET gene mutation analysis in a Chinese MEN2A family and compared these results with biochemical screening tests and pathological examinations. Twenty-one exons and flanking introns of the RET gene were amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR products were subjected to sequencing directly, or cloned into pGEM-T plasmids and sequenced. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was employed to confirm the mutation on the RET sequence. A novel heterozygous mutation of a 3-bp (GAC) deletion at codon 631 (D631del) of exon 11, resulting in the deletion of an aspartic acid at the locus, was identified in four MEN2A patients and one phenotypically normal family member. The average clinical onset-age of four MEN2A patients was 33.7 years, no cervical lymph node metastasis was found in MEN2A patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma in the family. The study indicated that the novel heterozygous deletion mutation at D631 of RET gene was co-segregated with MEN2A phenotype and promoted the development of MEN2A.

In vitro expression showed that phosphorylation of the crucial tyrosine 905 was much stronger in the p.505_506del RET mutant compared with WT RET, indicating ligand-independent autophosphorylation. Furthermore, the p.505_506del RET mutant induced a strong activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway and the PI3K/AKT pathway. Consequently, the p.505_506del RET mutant cells increased HEK293 colony formation 4-fold compared with WT RET.;The finding of bilateral pheochromocytoma and MTC in our patient was highly suspicious of a RET mutation. Exome sequencing revealed a 6-base-pair deletion in exon 7 of RET, an exon not yet associated with MEN2. Increased ligand-independent phosphorylation of the p.505_506del RET mutant, increased activation of downstream pathways, and stimulation of cell proliferation demonstrated the pathogenic nature of the mutation.

Germline RET mutations are seen virtually in all familial forms of MTC and somatic RET mutations are often detected in sporadic MTC. In sporadic MTCs the RET gene is mutated in codon 918, where a methionine is substituted to a threonine (M918T). In this study 24 MTCs were analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) for chromosomal imbalances. Overall, alterations were detected in approximately 60% of the samples. The most common aberrations were gains on chromosome 19q (29%), 19p (21%), 11c-q12 (12.5%), and 22q (12.5%) and losses on 13q21 (21%) and 3q23-qter (12.5%). Gain of chromosome 11c-q12 was only detected in samples from patients whom died of MTC (p=0.001). These MTCs also harbored the somatic RET M918T mutation and also showed the highest numbers of CGH alterations in the series (p<0.003). Although there was a tendency towards a higher number of CGH imbalances in the tumors with RET M918T mutation, this difference was not significant. The results indicate that MTC is a comparatively genetically stable tumor, and that chromosomal regions 19q, 19p, 13q and 11q may be involved in MTC carcinogenesis.",

Follicular cell-derived tumors represent a wide spectrum of lesions, ranging from benign adenomas through differentiated (follicular and papillary) and undifferentiated (anaplastic) carcinomas, thus providing a good model for finding a correlation between specific genetic lesions and histologic phenotype. Follicular adenomas and carcinomas show frequently the presence of mutations in one of the three ras genes. Papillary carcinomas show frequently a specific gene rearrangement which gives rise to the formation of several types of so-called RET/PTC chimeric genes. This lesions occur in almost 50% of papillary cancers and consist in the juxtaposition of the 3' or tyrosine kinase domain of the RET gene (which codes for a receptor protein not normally expressed in follicular thyroid cells) with the 5' domain of ubiquitously expressed genes, which provide the promoter and dimerization functions, necessary for the constitutive activation of RET/PTC proteins. Anaplastic carcinomas are frequently associated with mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor. Finally, point mutations of the RET gene are found in familial endocrine syndromes (FMTC; MEN2A and MEN2B), a common feature of which is the medullary thyroid carcinoma, a malignant tumor derived from parafollicular C-cells.",

To date, screening for MTC has been performed using the pentagastrin stimulation test, which is a provocative test for calcitonin release. Germline mutations in the RET protooncogene have been identified in families manifesting these syndromes and genetic screening of individuals at risk of one of these syndromes has become integral to their clinical management. The majority of the mutations associated with MEN 2A and FMTC are tightly clustered in a cysteine-rich region of the RET receptor. A single mutation associated with MEN 2B is in the the tyrosine kinase domain of the RET receptor. Somatic mutations have been identified in the tumor tissue of individuals with sporadic MTC and may prove to be helpful markers in discerning the hereditary or sporadic nature of the MTC. There is general agreement that the primary operation for MTC should include total thyroidectomy and central neck lymph node clearance.

The youngest age of onset for MTC in this group was 17 yr (median, 46 yr; range, 17-80 yr), for pheochromocytoma 46 yr (median, 46 yr), and for parathyroid hyperplasia 17 yr (median, 20 yr, range, 17-46 yr). Persistence of MTC was described in 14.3% of patients with available follow-up. Additional findings included corneal nerve thickening in three of 74 patients (4.1%).;This intracellular mutation can initiate the full spectrum of MEN2a, initiates MTC at an early age, and causes recurrence and death if undertreated. We recommend stringent adherence to established guidance in MEN2a in this rare mutation.",

Of these, small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors represent one of the most promising agents for MTC treatment, and clinical trials have shown encouraging results.

We have constructed a 1.5-megabase contig consisting of six genomic yeast artificial chromosome clones which include these loci and define their physical order. A critical crossover event has been identified within the map interval; this event places the MEN2A locus centromeric to D10S102 and defines the orientation of the physical map on the chromosome. The orientation of the contig and order of the markers are centromere-RET-D10S94-D10S102-telomere. In addition, a microsatellite repeat polymorphism with a heterozygosity of 71% at the RET locus and a restriction fragment length polymorphism with a heterozygosity of 42% detected by a lambda clone from the D10S94 locus have been developed for high-resolution genetic linkage mapping and predictive diagnostic testing. These data place three important markers on a contiguous physical map, narrow the MEN2 disease locus interval, and provide a framework for further candidate gene identification efforts.

A variety of recent studies have elucidated the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to neoplastic disease and we now understand that dominant activating germline mutations lead to MEN-2A, MEN-2B, and familial MTC; somatic mutations to sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma; RET rearrangements to papillary thyroid carcinoma; and inactivating alterations to Hirschsprung's disease.

We compared the reliability of biochemical tests with that of DNA analysis in identifying carriers of the MEN2A gene.;Starting in 1975, we screened 300 subjects in four large families with MEN-2A for expression of the disease, using measurements of plasma calcitonin after stimulation with pentagastrin or calcium and urinary excretion of catecholamines and catecholamine metabolites. We tested for carrier status by DNA analysis, including linkage analysis, and more recently by analysis of mutations in the RET gene.;Of 80 MEN2A gene carriers (in 61 of whom carrier status was proved by DNA analysis), 66 had abnormal plasma calcitonin values and medullary thyroid carcinoma. Fourteen young carriers had normal results of plasma calcitonin tests. In 8 of these 14, thyroidectomy revealed small foci of medullary thyroid carcinoma; the remaining 6 have not yet been operated on. Of the other 220 family members, 68 were found by DNA analysis not to carry the MEN2A gene.

Here we show that stable expression of ret mutants (MEN2A and MEN2B alleles) in PC12 cells causes a dramatic conversion from a round to a flat morphology, accompanied by the induction of genes belonging to the early as well as the delayed response to nerve growth factor. However, in the transfected PC12 cells, the continuous expression of neuronal specific genes is not associated with the suppression of cell proliferation. Furthermore, expression of ret mutants renders PC12 cells unresponsive to nerve growth factor-induced inhibition of proliferation. These results suggest that induction of an aberrant pattern of differentiation, accompanied by unresponsiveness to growth-inhibitory physiological signals, may be part of the mechanism of action of activated ret alleles in the pathogenesis of neuroendocrine tumors associated with MEN2 syndromes.",

Furthermore, by RT-PCR, PGP9.5 mRNA was detected only in aspirates from three medullary carcinomas, and not in aspirates from other tumour types.

Rarely, somatic deletions and germline duplications have been described in sporadic MTC and in FMTC. We report the detection and functional studies of a deletion/insertion in exon 11 (c.2646delGinsTTCT) associated with FMTC. This in-frame complex rearrangement leads to an Asn to Lys change (Lys666Asn) and to a Ser insertion. The mutation was found in the proband, who was diagnosed with metastatic MTC at 41 years, and in her son, who presented diffuse C-cells hyperplasia at 4 years of age. The mutation displayed a transforming activity stronger than Ret wild type (Ret-WT) at the focus formation assay and functional analyses after transient and stable transfection revealed an increased autophosphorylation, indicating the constitutive activation of the receptor. The transforming activity may be favoured by an increased stabilization of the fully mature form of the mutant receptor. Dimerization assay demonstrated that the activation mechanism of the complex mutation is not mediated by stable dimer formation. Computational analysis predicted nonconservative alterations in the mutant protein consistent with a possible modification of the conformation of the receptor. In conclusion, the first molecular studies on a complex germline RET mutation lying in the juxtamembrane region of the receptor are reported.

Rearranged during transfection (RET) proto-oncogene plays a crucial role in MTC development. Besides RET, other oncogenes commonly involved in the pathogenesis of human cancers have also been investigated in MTC. The family of human RAS genes includes the highly homologous HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS genes that encode three distinct proteins. Activating mutations in specific hotspots of the RAS genes are found in about 30% of all human cancers. In thyroid neoplasias, RAS gene point mutations, mainly in NRAS, are detected in benign and malignant tumors arising from the follicular epithelium. However, recent reports have also described RAS mutations in MTC, namely in HRAS and KRAS. Overall, the prevalence of RAS mutations in sporadic MTC varies between 0-43.3%, occurring usually in tumors with WT RET and rarely in those harboring a RET mutation, suggesting that activation of these proto-oncogenes represents alternative genetic events in sporadic MTC tumorigenesis. Thus, the assessment of RAS mutation status can be useful to define therapeutic strategies in RET WT MTC. MTC patients with RAS mutations have an intermediate risk for aggressive cancer, between those with RET mutations in exons 15 and 16, which are associated with the worst prognosis, and cases with other RET mutations, which have the most indolent course of the disease.

We have previously shown that approximately 80% of sporadic MTCs had at least one subpopulation with a somatic RET mutation. Uneven distribution of somatic mutation within a single tumor or among metastases from a single individual was notable. In the present study, we sought to correlate RET expression, as demonstrated by RET immunohistochemistry, with mutation status in sporadic MTC for each tumor. Seventy evaluable subpopulations, belonging to 28 unrelated sporadic cases, comprising primary MTC and metastases, were immunostained with two different polyclonal antibodies raised against the C-terminus of RET. The regional presence of codon 918 or 883 seemed to coincide with increased RET immunopositivity in at least 62 of 70 (89%, P < 0.000001) tumor subpopulations. The reasons for this concordance are not entirely clear but could be related to either RNA or protein stability. Preliminary studies have suggested that the presence of somatic codon 918 mutation in MTC has a prognostic significance.

Vandetanib, a VEGF and EGF receptor inhibitor, blocks RET tyrosine kinase activity and is active in adults with hereditary MTC.;We conducted a phase I/II trial of vandetanib for children (5-12 years) and adolescents (13-18 years) with MTC to define a recommended dose and assess antitumor activity. The starting dose was 100 mg/m(2) administered orally, once daily, continuously for 28-day treatment cycles. The dose could be escalated to 150 mg/m(2)/d after two cycles. Radiographic response to vandetanib was quantified using RECIST (v1.0), biomarker response was measured by comparing posttreatment serum calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels to baseline, and a patient-reported outcome was used to assess clinical benefit.;Sixteen patients with locally advanced or metastatic MTC received vandetanib for a median (range) 27 (2-52) cycles. Eleven patients remain on protocol therapy. Diarrhea was the primary dose-limiting toxicity. In subjects with M918T RET germline mutations (n = 15) the confirmed objective partial response rate was 47% (exact 95% confidence intervals, 21%-75%). Biomarker partial response was confirmed for calcitonin in 12 subjects and for CEA in 8 subjects.;Using an innovative trial design and selecting patients based on target gene expression, we conclude that vandetanib 100 mg/m(2)/d is a well-tolerated and highly active new treatment for children and adolescents with MEN2B and locally advanced or metastatic MTC.",

RET oncogenes arise through sporadic and inherited gene mutations and are involved in the etiopathogenesis of medullary thyroid carcinoma, a cancer that responds poorly to conventional chemotherapy. Medullary thyroid carcinoma is a component of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 or MEN2 syndromes.;We investigated the cellular effects of RPI-1, a novel 2-indolinone Ret tyrosine kinase inhibitor on cells that express RET C634 oncogenic mutants common in the MEN2A syndrome: NIH3T3 fibroblasts transfected with RET(C634R) and human medullary thyroid carcinoma TT cells that express endogenous RET(C634W). RPI-1 antiproliferative activity was determined by cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth assays. Expression and phosphorylation of Ret and of proteins involved in downstream signaling pathways were examined by immunoblotting. Antitumor activity of oral RPI-1 treatment was tested by using two dosing levels in nude mice bearing subcutaneous TT xenograft tumors. All statistical tests were two-sided.;The RPI-1 IC50 value for cell proliferation was 3.6 microM (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.8 to 5.4 microM) in NIH3T3 cells expressing the Ret mutant compared with 16 microM (95% CI = 12.3 to 19.7 microM) in non-transfected NIH3T3 cells, and that for colony formation in soft agar was 2.4 microM (95% CI = 0.8 to 4.0 microM) and 26 microM (95% CI = 17 to 35 microM) in RET mutant-transfected and H-RAS-transfected NIH3T3 cells, respectively. In NIH3T3 cells expressing the Ret mutant, Ret protein and tyrosine phosphorylation were undetectable after 24 hours of RPI-1 treatment. In TT cells, RPI-1 inhibited proliferation, Ret tyrosine phosphorylation, Ret protein expression, and the activation of PLCgamma, ERKs and AKT. In mice, oral daily RPI-1 treatment inhibited the tumor growth of TT xenografts by 81% (P<.001 versus control mice) and reduced the plasma levels of the specific biomarker calcitonin (P =.01 versus control mice). Twenty-five percent of RPI-1-treated mice were tumor-free.;Ret oncoproteins represent exploitable targets for therapeutic intervention in MEN2A-associated medullary thyroid carcinoma.

RET oncogenes that have been implicated in the development of thyroid carcinomas are emerging as potential therapeutic targets. In the present study, we investigated the efficacy and the cellular bases of antitumor activity of the indolinone Ret tyrosine kinase inhibitor RPI-1 against large established s.c. TT tumor xenograft, a human medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) harboring oncogenic MEN-2A-type RET mutation. Oral treatment with RPI-1 caused growth arrest or regression in 81% treated tumors. Following treatment suspension, tumor inhibition was maintained (51%, P<0.05, 100 days) and cures were achieved in 2/11 mice. In treated tumors, Ret was tyrosine dephosphorylated. Moreover, compared to control tumors, a significant increase in apoptotic cells (210%, P<0.0001), loss of cellularity (47%, P<0.0001) and reduction of microvessel density (36%, P<0.0005) were detected. In vivo effects of RPI-1 were reflected in activation of BAD, cleavage of caspases, apoptotic DNA fragmentation and inhibition of VEGF production observed in in vitro RPI-1-treated TT cells. These findings thus indicate that RPI-1 antitumor effect on the MTC was characterized by apoptosis induction and angiogenesis inhibition. The results, consistent with a dependence on RET oncogene activation for maintenance and survival of MEN2A-type MTC, provide further preclinical rationale for a pharmacological RET-targeted intervention in thyroid cancer.",

In a significant number of MTCs, however, no such genetic variations can be detected, which implies alternative pathogenic molecular alterations. To assess altered RET mutation-specific gene expression, and to identify yet unknown gene transcripts involved in the tumorigenesis of MTC, we performed an expression analysis by mRNA differential display (RT-DD). Snap-frozen tumor tissues and corresponding normal thyroid tissues of 8 patients suffering from MTC (6 sporadic, 2 hereditary tumors) were included in the study; 5/8 MTCs harbored RET point mutations (codons 618, 634, 918). The RT-DD method was refined by use of fluorescence-labeled arbitrary oligonucleotides, electrophoresis on an automated sequencer, and a novel fragment-recovery technique utilizing a high-performance fluorescence scanner. More than 400 differentially expressed mRNA transcripts--representing upregulated or downregulated genes in the compared tissues--were detected. In all, 28 selected fragments were recovered, cloned, sequenced, and identified. Differential expression of gene transcripts with known association to cell proliferation or tumor progression--such as annexin A2, Rab11a, trefoil proteins, superoxide dismutase (SOD1), mitochondrial displacement loop (D-loop), and G protein subunit gamma11--as well as of the neuroendocrine marker chromogranin was observed. Furthermore, several mRNA transcripts of yet unknown genes displayed mutation-specific upregulation or downregulation in MTC. Illumination of the molecular basis especially of C-cell carcinomas without detectable alterations of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase will be required for the development of therapeutic strategies for advanced tumors that cannot be bridled or cured by surgical interventions alone.",

Non-neoplastic thyroid parenchyma separated the three nodules. Metastasis from PTC was diagnosed in a regional lymph node. Genetic analysis of both tumour components showed a distinctive mutational pattern: in the MTC a Cys634Arg substitution in exon 11 of the RET gene and in the two PTC foci a Val600Glu substitution in exon 15 of the BRAF gene. The other two patients are members of a large multigenerational family affected with familial MTC due to a germline mutation of the RET gene (Ala891Ser). Both patients harboured, besides medullary cancer and C-cell hyperplasia, distinct foci of papillary thyroid cancer, which was positive for Val600Glu BRAF mutation. Review of the literature disclosed 18 similar lesions reported and allowed the identification of different patterns of clinical presentation and biological behaviour. So far, the pathogenesis of these peculiar cases of thyroid malignancy has been completely unknown, but an underlying common genetic drive has been hypothesised.

In this exploratory study, we investigated the expression of eight key TKI target proteins (EGFR, KIT, MET, PDGFRB, VEGF (VEGFA), VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4)) by immunohistochemistry in 103 molecularly characterized MTC samples and identified the associated clinical and molecular features. A number of MTC samples exhibited a high expression of VEGFR2 and VEGFR3, which were overexpressed in 57 and 43% of the MTC samples respectively. VEGFR1, PDGFRB, VEGF, KIT, and MET were present in 34-20% of the cases, while EGFR was highly expressed in only 10% of the MTC samples. Some proteins exhibited large differences in expression between sporadic and familial cases, suggesting that different RET mutations may be associated with the immunohistochemical profiles. MTC samples with the C634 RET mutation exhibited a higher expression of VEGFR3 and KIT than the M918T RET-mutated and non-mutated RET tumor samples (P=0.005 and P=0.007 respectively) and a lower expression of VEGFR1 (P=0.04). Non-mutated RET MTC cases exhibited a lower expression of PDGFRB (P=0.04). Overall, this is the first study, to our knowledge, to show that multiple TKI targets are highly expressed in a subset of MTCs, suggesting that molecular stratification of patients may have the potential to improve TKI therapies for MTC.

In order to determine the prevalence of this mutation among sporadic MTC tumors, we have now analysed 15 cases and five normal controls by PCR-based nonradioactive single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis (PCR-SSCP) and fragment size analysis of exon 11. DNA was extracted from microdissected tumor tissue or normal cells and subjected to nested PCR prior to analysis. A markedly divergent SSCP pattern and a PCR fragment 9 bp shorter than normal were demonstrated in 14 of the 15 MTC tumors. Sequencing revealed the deletion of nine bases encompassing a key cysteine at codon 634, often altered in MEN 2A. Four lymphocyte controls and normal thyroid tissue from one patient failed to show the deletion. Several factors in the DNA sequence environment immediately surrounding the deletions, including an extended inverted repeat, several direct repeats and a so-called symmetric element suggest that the deletional events may be non-random.",

We analysed RET exons 5, 8, 10-16 in fifty-one sporadic MTC, and found somatic mutations in thirty-three (64.7%) tumours. Among the RET-positive cases, exon 16 was the most frequently affected (60.6%). Two novel somatic mutations (Cys630Gly, c.1881del18) were identified. MTC patients were divided into three groups: group 1, with mutations in RET exons 15 and 16; group 2, with other RET mutations; group 3, having no RET mutations. Group 1 had higher prevalence (P=0.0051) and number of lymph node metastases (P=0.0017), and presented more often multifocal tumours (P=0.037) and persistent disease at last control (P=0.0242) than group 2. Detectable serum calcitonin levels at last screening (P=0.0119) and stage IV disease (P=0.0145) were more frequent in group 1, than in the other groups.

Oncogenic activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase encoding RET gene occurs typically by gene rearrangement in papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) and by missense mutation in medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTC). These genetic alterations lead to the expression of deregulated products characterized by ligand-independent activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase of Ret. Such features suggest the possibility of using specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors to block the Ret oncoproteins signaling. The present report summarizes the cellular effects of the arylidene 2-indolinone Ret inhibitor RPI-1 (formerly Cpd1) on the human PTC cell line TPC-1 which spontaneously harbors the RET/PTC1 oncogene. The results provide evidence that RPI-1 is able to inhibit cell growth and to interfere with Ret/ptc1-driven signaling. These findings support a role for Ret oncoproteins as therapeutic targets and the pharmacological interest of RPI-1 as a candidate drug for preclinical evaluation on thyroid tumors expressing RET oncogenes.",

Mutant genotypes are distinguished from the wild-type genotype by an altered amplicon melting curve shape or position.;Samples of 26 unique RET mutations, 4 nonpathogenic polymorphisms, or the wild-type genotype were available for this study. The developed RET mutation-scanning assay differentiated RET sequence variations from the wild-type genotype by altered derivative melting curve shape or position. A blinded study of 80 samples (derived from the 35 mutant, polymorphism, or wild-type samples) demonstrated that 100% of RET sequence variations were differentiated from wild-type samples.

Distant haematogenous spread targets the lungs, liver, bone and brain, and is presumed to be secondary to a lymphatic pathway.

        "Doc_abstract":"Since medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) was first recognized as a distinct tumor in 1959, it became clear that MTC is more difficult to cure than papillary thyroid cancer and has higher rates of recurrence and mortality. MTC represents 5-8% of thyroid cancers. It derives from parafollicular cells of the ultimobranchial body derived from the neural crest. MTC secretes calcitonin and other hormonal peptides and is considered part of the amine precursor uptake and decarboxilation system. MTC may occur either as a hereditary or nonhereditary entity. Hereditary MTC can occur either alone as the familial MTC or as the thyroid manifestation of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2 syndromes (MEN 2A MEN 2B). Activating point mutations of the RET proto-oncogene have demonstrated to be causative of the familial form of medullary thyroid cancer, both isolated familial MTC and associated with MEN 2A and 2B. In the last 10 years, major improvements and new technologies have been proposed and applied in thyroid surgery; among these are molecular diagnosis with genetic screening and mini-invasive video-assisted thyroidectomy. The history of thyroid surgery starts with Billroth, Kocher and Halsted, who developed the technique for thyroidectomy between 1873 and 1910. Prophylactic surgery for patients carrying a positive RET proto-oncogene has proven to be highly effective in curing those likely to experience the development of MTC. Video-assisted procedures with central compartment dissection have proved feasible for patients carrying a positive RET proto-oncogene. This paper reviews relevant medical literature published in the English language on surgery of MTC in well-controlled trials. We discuss the particular ethical and legal issues that thyroid prophylactic surgery raises. Searches were last updated in February 2007.",

To assess the role of RET in the development of MTC and PC, we screened 14 sporadic MTC, two MTC-derived cell lines, and 5 sporatic PC cases of RET mutations by a systematic analysis of the whole coding sequence, including all intron-exon junctions. In only 6 of the 14 sporadic MTC we were able to detect a RET mutation. Apart from the MET918-->Thr mutation in 5 of the MTC cases, we found a 3-bp deletion in exon 11, only present in the tumor, in another case. Analysis of 2 cell lines revealed the Met918-->Thr mutation in 1 and a Cys634-->Trp mutation in the other cell line. A possible somatic nature of these mutations could not be confirmed because in neither case was constitutive DNA available. We conclude that a large proportion of sporadic MTC must be due to mutations in an unidentified gene(s) other than RET. In none of the sporadic PC cases was a RET mutation found. As PC is a frequent complication in families suffering from von Hippel Lindau disease, for which mutations of the VHL gene are responsible, we also screened the 5 sporadic PC cases for VHL mutations. This revealed a Gly164-->Ser mutation in a single specimen. Thus, in PC, a large majority of tumors are due to mutations in an unidentified gene(s) other than RET and VHL.",

Targeting RET, therefore, might be useful in tailoring surveillance of MTC patients. Here we showed that theaflavins, the bioactive components of black tea, successfully induced apoptosis in human MTC cell line, TT, by inversely modulating two molecular pathways: (i) stalling PI3K/Akt/Bad pathway that resulted in mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTP) loss, cytochrome-c release and activation of the executioner caspases-9 and -3, and (ii) upholding p38MAPK/caspase-8/caspase-3 pathway via inhibition of Ras/Raf/ERK. Over-expression of either constitutively active myristoylated-Akt-cDNA (Myr-Akt-cDNA) or dominant-negative-caspase-8-cDNA (Dn-caspase-8-cDNA) partially blocked theaflavin-induced apoptosis, while co-transfection of Myr-Akt-cDNA and Dn-caspase-8-cDNA completely eradicated the effect of theaflavins thereby negating the possibility of existence of other pathways. A search for the upstream signaling revealed that theaflavin-induced disruption of lipid raft caused interference in anchorage of RET in lipid raft that in turn stalled phosphorylation of Ras and PI3Kinase. In such anti-survival cellular micro-environment, pro-apoptotic signals were triggered to culminate into programmed death of MTC cell. These findings not only unveil a hitherto unexplained mechanism underlying theaflavin-induced MTC death, but also validate RET as a promising and potential target for MTC therapy.",

The MTC tumor cells secrete the polypeptide hormone calcitonin, which serves as an excellent tumor marker, useful for defining the presence of disease, preoperatively or following thyroidectomy. The discovery that mutations in the RET proto-oncogene are associated with MEN-II syndromes was highly significant in that it demonstrated a clear correlation between genotype and phenotype; and most importantly it provided a mechanism whereby family members at risk could be identified by direct DNA analysis. Virtually all patients with MEN-IIA, MEN-IIB, and FMTC develop MTC; therefore there is a clear rationale for performing thyroidectomy as soon as a RET mutation has been identified. Because MTC appears to be much more aggressive in patients with MEN-IIB, thyroidectomy is performed during the first year of life in this setting, whereas in patients with MEN-IIA, where the tumor appears to be more indolent, the procedure can be safety delayed until age 5 years. Reoperative neck exploration in patients with evidence of persistent or recurrent MTC has been effective in a significant number of patients, although the success of the operation requires careful patient selection and preoperative assessment. MTC, as expressed in the MEN-II syndromes, is an excellent model to evaluate the usefulness of interventional therapy in patients demonstrated to have a genetic predisposition for cancer.",

Distinct activating RET mutations cause multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A), type 2B (MEN2B), and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). Despite clear correlations between the mutations found in these cancer syndromes and their phenotypes, the molecular mechanisms connecting the mutated receptor to the different disease phenotypes are far from completely understood. Luciferase reporter assays in combination with immunoprecipitations, and Western and immunohistochemistry analyses were done in order to characterize the signaling properties of two FMTC-associated RET mutations, Y791F and S891A, respectively, both affecting the tyrosine kinase domain of the receptor. We show that these RET-FMTC mutants are monomeric receptors which are autophosphorylated and activated independently of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor. Moreover, we show that the dysfunctional signaling properties of these mutants, when compared with wild-type RET, involve constitutive activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3). Furthermore, we show that STAT3 activation is mediated by a signaling pathway involving Src, JAK1, and JAK2, differing from STAT3 activation promoted by RET(C634R) which was previously found to be independent of Src and JAKs. Three-dimensional modeling of the RET catalytic domain suggested that the structural changes promoted by the respective amino acids substitutions lead to a more accessible substrate and ATP-binding monomeric conformation. Finally, immunohistochemical analysis of FMTC tumor samples support the in vitro data, because nuclear localized, Y705-phosphorylated STAT3, as well as a high degree of RET expression at the plasma membrane was observed.",

In this work, we show that targeted deletion of Spry1 causes C-cell hyperplasia, a precancerous lesion preceding MTC, in young adult mice. Expression of Spry1 restrains proliferation of the MTC-derived cell line, TT. Finally, we found that the Spry1 promoter is frequently methylated in MTC and that Spry1 expression is consequently decreased.

We analyzed the allelic frequencies of SNP of the exon 11, 13, 14 and 15 of the RET proto-oncogene in blood samples from 50 sporadic MTC patients, using the polymerase chain reaction methodology followed by DNA sequencing. The observed allelic frequencies were 24% for G691S polymorphism in exon 11, 29% for L769L polymorphism in exon 13, 5% for S836S polymorphism in exon 14, and 26% for S904S polymorphism in exon 15. These frequencies are similar to those reported in other countries. We did not observe any significant association of all four SNP with the age at onset of MTC. Our results indicate a possible association between the presence of lymph node involvement at the time of diagnosis (extent of disease) and L769L or S836S polymorphism. However, it is not possible to draw definitive conclusions that these two polymorphisms play a significant role in clinical behavior of MTC. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of this polymorphism in the clinical behavior of MTC.",

The objectives of this study are to describe the rare M918V RET mutation discovered in 8 MTC kindreds from Brazil lacking the MEN 2B phenotype classically observed in M918T patients and to investigate the presence of a founder effect for this germline mutation. Eight apparently sporadic MTC cases were diagnosed with the germline M918V RET mutation. Subsequently, their relatives underwent clinical and genetic assessment (n = 113), and M918V was found in 42 of them. Until today, 20/50 M918V carriers underwent thyroidectomy and all presented MTC/C-cell hyperplasia; the remainder carriers are on clinical follow-up. None of the M918V carriers presented clinical features of MEN 2B. Their clinical presentation was heterogeneous, and the age at tumor diagnosis ranged from 24 to 59 years. Lymph node metastases were present in 12/20 patients, and presumable distant metastases in 2/20; in contrast, we observed a carrier of up to 87 years of age without evidence of MTC.

The susceptibility gene for MEN 2 is the RET proto-oncogene. Systematic analysis for germline mutations of the RET proto-oncogene was performed in a series of 67 patients with apparently sporadic MTC to determine whether they were true sporadic cases or unsuspected de novo MEN 2 cases.;Sixty-seven unselected patients with sporadic MTC were randomly ascertained from clinic patients from four centres. The diagnosis of MTC was confirmed by histopathology. Germline DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leucocytes or from paraffin-embedded tissue and subsequently used for polymerase chain reaction amplification.;Polymerase chain reaction based RET mutation analysis was performed by direct double-stranded cycle sequencing of exons 10, 11, 13 and 16, within which the majority of MEN2 mutations have been shown to occur.;In this series, there was one proven case of germline mutation in RET codon 620, which previously has been shown to be responsible for MEN 2, thus indicating heritable disease. No germline mutation in codon 918, typical of MEN 2B, was found.;A figure of 1.5% germline mutations in 67 apparently sporadic MTC is lower than the incidence of familial disease reported in previous series involving clinical and biochemical screening. The presence of a germline mutation in the RET proto-oncogene in a patient with MTC indicates heritable disease. The absence of germline RET exon 10, 11, 13 or 16 mutation appears to rule out MEN 2A to a high probability, although the presence of a familial form of MTC other than classical MEN 2A cannot be excluded conclusively.",

Loss of function of RET is associated with congenital megacolon or Hirschsprung's disease, whereas germ-line point mutations causing RET activation are responsible for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2A, MEN2B, and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma) syndromes. Here we show that the expression of a constitutively active RET-MEN2A oncogene promotes survival of rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells upon growth factor withdrawal. Moreover, we show that the RET-MEN2A-mediated survival depends on signals transduced by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. Thus, in PC12 cells, RET-MEN2A associates with the PI3K regulatory subunit p85 and promotes activation of Akt (also referred to as protein kinase B) in a PI3K-dependent fashion; in addition, RET-MEN2A promotes MAPK activation. PI3K recruitment and Akt activation as well as MAPK activation depend on RET-MEN2A tyrosine residue 1062.

To clarify the contradictory findings, we studied the association of certain SNPs considering age, gender, and histopathology in a large Austrian cohort with C-cell hyperplasia (CCH) and MTC.;Genotyping of SNPs located in RET codons 691, 769, 836, and 904 from 199 patients with MTC and CCH (basal calcitonin > 10 pg/mL, pentagastrin stimulated > 100 pg/mL) was performed, and the results were analyzed considering gender, age at diagnosis, and histopathology.;No significant difference of SNP frequencies was found in the study patients versus normal controls. In sMTC and sporadic CCH (sCCH) no significant association of SNP frequency with the age at diagnosis was found.

Often, this is not possible for sporadic MTC; however, genetic testing for hereditary MTC makes this possible if genetic carriers have surgery before C cells undergo malignant transformation. All patients who have MTC should be tested for RET mutations, including putative sporadic cases. The leukocytes of suspected carriers and sporadic MTC cases should be tested for MEN2-associated germ-line mutations by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the appropriate RET gene exons, including 10, 11,13, 14, 15, and 16 (see Table I). When a RET mutation is found, all first-degree relatives must be screened to determine which individuals carry the gene. If these exons are negative, the other 15 should be sequenced because a small risk of hereditary MTC remains if no germ-line mutation is found. The probability that a first-degree relative will inherit an autosomal dominant gene for MTC from an individual who has sporadic MTC in whom no germ-line mutation is found is 0.18% . Patients who have MEN2B or RET codon 883 or 918 mutation should have a total thyroidectomy within the first 6 months of life, preferably within the first month of life. Patients who have 634 mutations, which account for approximately 70% of all MTC mutations, should undergo thyroidectomy by age 5 years. The recommendations for the timing of prophylactic thyroidectomy are not consistent for the less common mutations (see Table 2). There is a balance between performing prophylactic thyroidectomy earlier than at the youngest age at with MTC has been reported to occur for a specific RET mutation (see Fig. 3 and Table 2) and the complications of thyroidectomy, including permanent hypoparathyroidism and laryngeal nerve damage. Preoperative measurement of plasma free metanephrine and neck ultrasonography always should be done if the diagnosis of MTC is known preoperatively. Initial treatment of MTC is total thyroidectomy, regardless of its genetic type or putative sporadic nature, because surgery offers the only chance for a cure. Treatment with 1311 has no place in the management of MTC. Plasma CT measurements provide an accurate estimate of tumor burden and are especially useful in identifying patients who have residual tumor. Pentagastrin- or calcium-stimulated plasma CT testing is useful in identifying CCH or early MTC in carriers of RET mutations that are associated with late onset MTC. Pheochromocytoma may occur before or after MTC and is an important cause of mortality, even in young patients. HPT is an important aspect of MEN2A and requires surgery according to current guidelines for the management of primary HPT. Early thyroidectomy and appropriate management of pheochromocytoma clearly have modified the course of this disease, but more research is necessary in kindreds who have rare MTC mutations. Moreover, new treatments for widespread MTC are necessary because current chemotherapy agents offer little benefit. New drugs that lock the action of tyrosine kinase offer some hope.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a tumor that arises from parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland. MTC can occur sporadically (75%) or as part of inherited cancer syndromes (25%). In most cases, hereditary MTC evolves from preneoplastic C cell hyperplasia (CCH), so early detection of this pathology would evidently be critical. A recent study reports that alterations in succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) D are responsible for familial non-RET CCH. First, we studied SDHD in two families with hereditary non-RET CCH and found no alterations related to the inheritance of this disease. Then, we investigated whether the H50R variant could be a risk factor in the sporadic development of MTC in both Spanish and English patients. We found no evidence that the presence of the H50R is strongly associated with the risk of sporadic MTC, although we did observe an association with age at diagnosis of MTC in Spanish H50R carriers that we did not find in English patients. Finally, we looked for evidence of CCH or any other thyroid disease in a panel of germ-line SDH (B or D) mutation carriers and found none. We conclude that SDHD variants do not constitute a risk factor for developing CCH or sporadic MTC.",

NF-kappaB has been shown to be activated through several signaling pathways that involve growth factor receptors. The aim of the study was to assess the immunohistochemical expression of members of the NF-kappaB family and the putative targets of NF-kappaB in a series of medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTCs), in correlation with RET mutational status. A tissue microarray was constructed from paraffin-embedded blocks of 48 MTCs (13 familial, 35 sporadic) previously evaluated for germ line and somatic RET mutations. Immunohistochemical evaluation included members of the NF-kappaB (p50, p65, p52, c-Rel, RelB) family, as well as putative targets of NF-kappaB such as Flip, Bcl-xL, and cyclin D1. Nuclear immunostaining for members of NF-kappaB was frequent in MTCs (p50, 19%; p65, 68%; p52, 86.6%; c-Rel, 75%; RelB, 36%). MTCs with germ line or somatic RET mutations (29 cases) showed NF-kappaB nuclear translocation (particularly of p65, P = .035) more frequently than MTCs without RET mutations (19 cases). Immunostaining for putative targets of NF-kappaB showed a significant statistical association between p65 and Bcl-xL (P = .024). In addition, Bcl-xL expression was statistically higher in the tumors with exon 16 RET mutation in comparison with those with exon 10 and 11 RET mutations or wild-type RET (P = .002). Moreover, the significance of RETsignaling in NF-kappaB activation was evaluated in the RET-mutated TT cell line. TT cells were infected with lentiviruses carrying short hairpin RNA to knock down RET expression, and NF-kappaB activity was assessed by luciferase reporter assays. Silencing of RET in the TT cell line produced a significant decrease in NF-kappaB activation and reduction in ERK1/2. The results suggest that the NF-kappaB is frequently activated in MTCs. The results also support the hypothesis that RET activation by somatic or germ line mutations may be responsible for NF-kappaB activation in MTCs.",

NVP-AST487, a N,N'-diphenyl urea with an IC(50) of 0.88 mumol/L on RET kinase, inhibited RET autophosphorylation and activation of downstream effectors, and potently inhibited the growth of human thyroid cancer cell lines with activating mutations of RET but not of lines without RET mutations. NVP-AST487 induced a dose-dependent growth inhibition of xenografts of NIH3T3 cells expressing oncogenic RET, and of the MTC cell line TT in nude mice. MTCs secrete calcitonin, a useful indicator of tumor burden. Human plasma calcitonin levels derived from the TT cell xenografts were inhibited shortly after treatment, when tumor volume was still unchanged, indicating that the effects of RET kinase inhibition on calcitonin secretion were temporally dissociated from its tumor-inhibitory properties. Accordingly, NVP-AST487 inhibited calcitonin gene expression in vitro in TT cells, in part, through decreased gene transcription. These data point to a previously unknown physiologic role of RET signaling on calcitonin gene expression. Indeed, the RET ligands persephin and GDNF robustly stimulated calcitonin mRNA, which was blocked by pretreatment with NVP-AST487. Antagonists of RET kinase activity in patients with MTC may result in effects on plasma calcitonin that are either disproportionate or dissociated from the effects on tumor burden, because RET kinase mediates a physiologic pathway controlling calcitonin secretion. The role of traditional tumor biomarkers may need to be reassessed as targeted therapies designed against oncoproteins with key roles in pathogenesis are implemented.",

Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) may have a very benign course while undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma (UTC) belongs to the most aggressive human malignancies. A variety of genes have been identified to be involved in the pathogenesis of thyroid carcinoma. Somatic Ras mutations seem to be an early event and are frequently found in follicular thyroid carcinomas. Somatic rearrangements of RET and TRK are almost exclusively found in PTC and may be found in early stages. Germline RET missense mutations lead to hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). In contrast, the significance of somatic RET mutations in sporadic MTC is unknown. p53 seems to play a crucial role in the dedifferentiation process of thyroid carcinoma. The precise role of PTEN remains to be elucidated. The only clearly identified exogenous factor that may lead to thyroid carcinoma (mainly PTC) is radiation. Of interest, radiation is capable to induce RET rearrangements. In general, early diagnosis is mandatory to enable the chance of cure. Surgery is the treatment of choice. Depending on the tumour type, surgery in combination with either radioiodine, external radiation or chemotherapy often enables the control of local tumour burden. In MTC and UTC, once thyroid cancer is spread to distant organs, efficacious therapeutic agents are almost non-existing. However, our growing knowledge of genes involved in thyroidal oncogenesis may contribute to the development of more effective treatment modalities.

Therefore, the clinical management of patients with sporadic CCH is controversial. To evaluate the malignant potential of sporadic CCHs, pure laser-microdissected C-cell populations of 24 CCH cases, either reactive or associated with nonfamilial MTC, were analyzed for MTC-associated protein neural cell adhesion molecule expression and RET point mutations in exons 10, 11, 15, and 16, by using immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism/heteroduplex electrophoresis/direct sequencing, respectively. No RET mutations were found in any of the 24 CCH cases, whereas M918T mutation was detected in three concomitant MTCs. Neural cell adhesion molecule was immunoreactive in the majority of CCH associated with MTC even in the absence of morphological atypia, but not in reactive forms.

The mutational screening of RET exons 10, 11, 13-16 was performed in a total of 111 subjects, including 45 MTC patients and 49 relatives with known RET mutations and 17 individuals, being at risk of hereditary MTC and carrying unknown RET alleles. Heteroduplex peaks with a distinct and reproducible DHPLC elution profile allowed the detection of both rare and common RET mutations. Overall, the DHPLC-based methodology showed a high level of sensitivity and accuracy, nearing 100%. Furthermore, our protocol showed the ability to identify: 1) all the mutated codons of RET located in the \"hot spots\" domain; 2) the different point mutations occurring in the same codon of RET gene; 3) less frequent or rare mutations; 4) polymorphisms. As such, it can be proposed as a relatively simple and highly accurate method for a rapid genetic testing for members of MTC families.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Objective. Until recently, advanced medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) had few treatment options except surgery. The mTOR inhibitor everolimus has shown encouraging results in neuroendocrine tumors. As part of a prospective phase II study, we analyzed the safety and efficacy of everolimus in advanced MTC. Methods. Seven patients with per RECIST 1.1 documented advanced MTC were included and received everolimus 10 mg daily. The primary objective was determining treatment efficacy. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), toxicity, and pharmacokinetics (PK). Results. Median follow-up duration was 28 weeks (17-147). Five patients (71%) showed SD, of which 4 (57%) showed SD >24 weeks. Median PFS and OS were 33 (95%CI: 8-56) and 30 (95%CI: 15-45) weeks, respectively. Toxicity was predominantly grade 1/2 and included mucositis (43%), fatigue (43%), and hypertriglyceridemia (43%). Four MTCs harbored the somatic RET mutation c.2753T>C, p.Met918Thr. The best clinical response was seen in a MEN2A patient. PK characteristics were consistent with phase I data. One patient exhibited extensive toxicity accompanying elevated everolimus plasma concentrations. Conclusions. This study suggests that everolimus exerts clinically relevant antitumor activity in patients with advanced MTC. Given the high level of clinical benefit and the relatively low toxicity profile, further investigation of everolimus in these patients is warranted. ",

Twenty surgically resected sporadic MTCs, previously analyzed for RET mutations by Sanger sequencing using DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, were investigated for intragenic mutations in 50 cancer-associated genes applying a multigene Ion AmpliSeq next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. Thirteen (65 %) MTCs harbored a RET mutation; 10 were detected at both Sanger and NGS sequencing, while 3 undetected by Sanger were revealed by NGS. One of the 13 RET-mutated cases also showed an F354L germline mutation in STK11. Of the seven RET wild-type MTCs, four cases (57.1 %) harbored a RAS mutation: three in HRAS (all Q61R) and one in KRAS (G12R). The three remaining MTCs (15 %) resulted as wild-type for all the 50 cancer-related genes. Follow-up was available in all but one RET-mutated case. At the end of follow-up, 7 of 12 (58 %) RET-mutated patients had relapsed, while the 4 RAS-mutated MTC patients were disease-free.

In a dose-dependent manner, NFV inhibited cyclin D1 and caused caspase-3 cleavage. NFV decreased the level of RET protein and blocked the activation of RET downstream targets (phosphorylated ERK, phosphorylated AKT, and p70S6K/pS6). NFV induced metabolic stress, activated AMP-activated protein kinase and increased autophagic flux. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy (chloroquine) augmented NFV-inducible cytotoxicity, suggesting that autophagy was protective in NFV-treated cells. NFV led to mitochondrial membrane depolarization and induced both oxidative stress and DNA damage. An antioxidant (n-acetylcysteine) attenuated DNA damage and prevented NFV-inducible apoptosis. HSP90 overexpression was found in 17 of 36 human MTCs and correlated with metastases and RET mutations. LC3B was detected in 20 of 36 human MTCs.;NFV has a wide spectrum of activity against MTC cells, and its cytotoxicity can be augmented by inhibiting autophagy.

Hereditary MTC is divided into three clinical subtypes: multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2A is characterized by MTC, pheochromocytoma and primary hyperparathyroidism. MEN 2B is characterized by aggressive MTC, pheochromocytoma, marfanoid habitus and the presence of distinctive mucosal neuromas on the tongue, lips and subconjunctival areas as well as ganglioneuromatosis of the gastrointestinal tract. The third clinical subtype of inherited MTC, familial MTC, is defined as the presence of MTC in families without evidence of adrenal or parathyroid gland involvement. Hereditary MTC is caused by autosomal dominant gain-of-function mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. The first RET germline mutations were identified in 1993 in patients with MEN 2A and FMTC. Initially a codon 634 (exon 11) mutation was found in approximately 85% of patients with MEN 2A, and germline mutations in FMTC kindreds were more equally distributed throughout the RET proto-onocogene. In about 5% of families in these earlier series, mutations did not reside in exons 10 and 11. We now report a change in the spectrum of mutations detected in the RET proto-oncogene in patients with hereditary MTC from the 'classical' mutation at codon 634 in exon 11 (level 2) to more cases with mutations in the exons 13-15 (level 1) and less aggressive disease.

In the setting of medullary thyroid cancer, germline RET point-mutations are implicated in the pathogenesis of virtually all hereditary forms and somatic point-mutations in nearly half of the sporadic forms. The clinical impact of this finding is that family members at-risk of hereditary MTC may be screened by genetic analysis, to distinguish those carrying or not-carrying the mutation.

The distinction between both is important for future clinical management. We report a family initially described as a familial MTC by pentagastrin stimulation test and clinical outcome, in which we found a 12 bp deletion within the catalytic domain of the protooncogene RET in the index case tumor alone. Linkage study suggests that it is a sporadic MTC. Therefore, in view of these results, in kindred with just one MTC case, borderline pentagastrin test values must be carefully assessed. In addition, this and other mutations can help us to understand some features about domains that play an important role in the normal function of this tyrosine kinase receptor and involved in MTC.",

Exons 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 16 of the RET gene were amplified by PCR and sequenced. Sixty-seven people were found to carry pathogenic, germline mutations in the RET gene. In exon 10, C609F, C609R and C609Y (3 families), C618G, C618F (2 families), and C620G (4 families) mutations were identified. In exon 11, C634R (8 families) and C649L mutations (1 patient) were found. Five families carried Y791F mutation in exon 13. One patient with PTC revealed the presence of a Y791F mutation. In 3 families, exon 14 of the RET gene harbored the following mutations: V804L (1 patient), E819K (1 patient) and R844Q (1 patient). In 1 family, the S891A mutation was identified in exon 15, 3 families were found to carry mutations in exon16, R912P in 1 family and M918T in 2 families. In summary, of the 235 patients affected by MTC, 46 (19.6%) carried pathogenic RET gene mutations, 1 patient with RET mutation had kidney carcinoma, and 1 had PTC. The results show the occurrence of a variety of mutations prevalent in patients with MTC in the population of Central Poland.

This article discusses the current approaches available for the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of patients and their family members with suspected MTC. The disease is predominantly managed surgically and typically requires a total thyroidectomy and lymph node dissection. A review of recent guidelines on the extent and timing of surgical excision is discussed.

However for rare mutations in the RET proto-oncogene there is insufficient evidence to provide guidance as to the risk of medullary thyroid carcinoma. We present a family with the rare RET mutation, D631Y in which the proband initially presented with a pheochromocytoma, and review the available literature pertaining to this mutation. In 83% of index cases, pheochromocytoma was the presenting feature and only 37% of adult germline mutation carriers have developed medullary thyroid carcinoma, none of whom have been reported to have nodal or metastatic disease. Patients with a D631Y RET mutation typically present with pheochromocytoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma appears to occur with a later onset than reported with other RET mutations.

Like RET, NTRK1 is often activated by rearrangements that involve one of at least five other genes in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Because of similarities in involvement of the two tyrosine kinases RET (rearranged during transfection) and NTRK1 in the pathogenesis of PTC, the obvious parallels between RET and NTRK1 and between PTC and medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), NTRK1 seemed to be an excellent candidate gene to play a role in the genesis of MTC. Single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis of 16 exons of NTRK1, from 31 sporadic MTC, revealed variants in five exons (exons 4 and 14-17). Sequence analysis demonstrated one sequence variant each in exons 4, 14, 16, and 17, and four different variants in exon 15. Differential restriction enzyme digestion specific for each variant confirmed the sequencing results. All variants were also present in the corresponding germline DNA. Interestingly, the sequence variants at codon 604 (c1810C>T) and codon 613 (c1838G>T) ofexon 15 always occurred together and might represent linkage disequilibrium. The frequencies of the sequence variants in germline DNA from patients with sporadic MTC did not differ significantly from those in a race-matched control group. Although we did not find any somatic mutations of NTRK1 in sporadic MTC, the single-strand conformational polymorphism conditions reported here, together with the knowledge of the frequency of various sequence variants, may help in future mutation analyses of DNA from other neural and nonneural tissues.",

Nevertheless, not all patients with the progressive MTC respond to these drugs, requiring the development of additional therapeutic modalities that have distinct activity. Previously, we reported that expression of activated Ras or Raf in the human MTC cell lines, TT and MZ-CRC-1, can induce growth arrest and RET downregulation via a leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-mediated autocrine/paracrine loop. In this study, we aimed to evaluate bacterially-produced recombinant human LIF for its efficacy to suppress human MTC xenografts in mice. Here, we report that, consistent with its effects in vitro, locally or systemically administered recombinant LIF effectively suppressed growth of TT and MZ-CRC-1 xenografts in mice. Further, as predicted from its effects in TT and MZ-CRC-1 cell cultures in vitro, recombinant LIF activated the JAK/STAT pathway and downregulated RET and E2F1 expression in tumors in mice. These results suggest that LIF is a potent cytostatic agent for MTC cells, which regulates unique mechanisms that are not targeted by currently available therapeutic agents.",

However, germline mutations may very occasionally occur in other exons, including exon 14 of the RET gene. Interestingly, an increased frequency of a rare germline sequence variant of the RET exon 14, S836S, has been detected in patients with sporadic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), and this variant has been proposed to play a role in the genesis of MTC and, perhaps, FMTC. In this study we report the segregation of a germline V804L mutation and a germline sequence variant S836S in exon 14 of the RET gene in an extended Hungarian FMTC kindred comprising 80 individuals of four generations. Molecular analysis of the RET gene was performed by direct DNA sequencing in 23 family members, of whom 12 had the V804L mutation, three had the V804L mutation and S836S polymorphism in separate alleles, and six had the S836S polymorphism, all in heterozygous forms. Two of the family members had neither mutation nor polymorphism of the RET gene. Three of the family members who had the V804L mutation and one member who could not be tested for mutation were operated for non-metastatic MTC, while one member with MTC who had the V804L mutation refused surgery. In all patients affected with MTC, the disease developed relatively late in life and never caused death. None of the other family members carrying the V804L mutation and/or the S836S polymorphism had clinical or biochemical evidence of MTC. These observations suggest that the co-existence of the V804L mutation and S836S polymorphism in separate alleles does not seem to aggravate the relatively low-risk disease phenotype characteristic in most patients with codon 804 mutations of the RET exon 14.",

Currently therapy is restricted to surgical removal of all neoplastic tissue lacking alternative forms of treatment such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Therefore MTC is a particularly attractive target for gene therapeutic approaches. Many promising gene therapy strategies have been used in various animal models of MTC, showing enhanced antitumoral efficacy, and these will hopefully extend our current standard of care in the future. These approaches can tentatively be subdivided into four groups: (a) Inhibition of oncogenic RET signaling, (b) suicide gene therapy, (c) immunotherapy, and (d) combination of immunotherapy and suicide approaches. To block oncogenic signal transduction dominant-negative RET mutants were delivered into tumor cells and found to possess strong antineoplastic activity, including tumor growth suppression and increased animal survival. Suicide gene therapeutic approaches applied to MTC treatment featured either gene transfer of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase with concomitant application of ganciclovir or delivery of nitric oxide synthase II. Here antitumor effects were attributed to the occurrence of substantial bystander activities. Immunotherapy approaches comprised stimulation of immune response by delivery of interleukin 2 or 12. Finally, treatment with herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase/ganciclovir in combination with interleukin 2 was found to be superior over either treatment alone. This review discusses the various gene therapeutic approaches applied to MTC treatment in detail, gives an overview on the diverse vector systems used to achieve efficient transduction of thyroid cancer cells, and points out the strategies employed to accomplish target cell selective gene expression thereby contributing to enhanced safety of gene therapy for MTC",

Here, we investigate whether the RET variants L769L, S836S, and G691S/S904S influence disease presentation in hereditary or sporadic MTC patients. One hundred and two patients with hereditary MTC and 81 patients with sporadic MTC attending our institution were evaluated. The frequencies of RET polymorphisms in hereditary MTC were as follows: L769L, 17.3%; S836S, 7.95%; and S904S/G691S, 18.2%. No associations were observed between these polymorphisms and pheochromocytoma, hyperparathyroidism, lymph node, or distant metastasis. However, patients harboring the S836S variant were younger than those without this allele (17±8.2 vs 28.6±14.4 years, P=0.01), suggesting that these patients had metastases at a young age. Accordingly, the cumulative frequency of local and/or distant metastases as estimated by Kaplan-Meier curves showed that lymph node and distant metastases occurred earlier in patients harboring the S836S variant (P=0.003 and P=0.026 respectively). The S836S allele frequency was higher in sporadic MTC patients than in controls (10.5 vs 3.1%, P=0.01). Individuals harboring the S836S variant were younger (38.6±13.3 vs 48.5±16.7 years, P=0.02) and showed a higher percentage of lymph node and distant metastases (P=0.02 and P=0.04 respectively). Kaplan-Meier estimates of lymph node and distant metastases yielded distinct curves for patients with or without the S836S allele (P=0.002 and P=0.001 respectively). Additional analyses using a COX regression model showed that the S836S variant was independently associated with metastatic disease (hazard ratio 2.82 (95% confidence interval 1.51-5.26), P=0.001).

A thorough clinico-laboratorial study did not disclose any other mass elsewhere. A left hemithyroidectomy was performed, and the histological examination revealed a neuroendocrine carcinoma resembling a paraganglioma-like MTC displaying unequivocal signs of vascular invasion. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells showed reactivity for chromogranin A, synaptophysin, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), paired box gene 8 (PAX8), cytokeratins (AE1/AE3 and CK8/18), and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and negativity for calcitonin, carcinoembryonic antigen, TTF-2, thyroperoxidase, and thyroglobulin. In situ hybridization showed that the tumor cells lacked expression for calcitonin and thyroglobulin mRNA. Genetic analysis did not disclose any RET mutation. A diagnosis of C-cell-derived primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the thyroid without calcitonin expression was made, and the patient remains free of metastasis or recurrence 18 months after surgery.

Here we show that nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB is activated in RET-associated C-cell carcinoma specimens. TT cells, a human MTC cell line expressing MEN 2A type RET, display transcriptionally active RelA(p65) in the nucleus. NF-kappaB activity in these cells is attributable to constitutive IkappaB kinase (IKK) activity and high turn over of IkappaBalpha. RET harboring the mutations C634R (MEN 2A) or M918T (MEN 2B), in contrast to wild-type RET, activates a NF-kappaB-dependent reporter construct upon transient transfection in HeLa cells. We show that the prototype RET mutation C634R enhances phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha by IKKbeta but not by IKKalpha. RET-induced NF-kappaB and IKKbeta activity requires Ras function but does neither involve the classical mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase nor the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathways. In contrast, RET-induced NF-kappaB activity is dependent on Raf and MEKK1. Inhibition of constitutive NF-kappaB activity results in cell death of TT cells and blocks focus formation induced by oncogenic forms of RET in NIH 3T3 cells. These results suggest that RET-mediated carcinogenesis critically depends on IKK activity and subsequent NF-kappaB activation.",

The use of these multikinase inhibitors are supported by the observed overactivation of the RET oncoprotein in a large subpopulation of MTCs. However, not all patients carry oncogenic alterations of this kinase. Hence, there is still a need for comprehensive molecular characterization of MTC utilizing whole-genome and transcriptome-sequencing methodologies with the aim of identifying targetable mutations.

From a surgical point of view, compartment-oriented lymph node dissection, clearing gross, and occult metastases are important for locoregional tumor control. The discovery of missense germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene and the close genotype-phenotype correlation in hereditary MTC promoted the worldwide breakthrough of prophylactic thyroidectomy. The best approach to hereditary MTC affords the DNA-based/biochemical concept, which is geared at limiting prophylactic surgery to total thyroidectomy at minimal surgical morbidity before the tumor can spread beyond the thyroid capsule.

Several germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene are the source of distinct clinical phenotypes in hereditary MTC including familial MTC (FMTC) and multiple endocrine neoplasia 2A (MEN 2A) and 2B (MEN 2B). The higher the penetrance of the MEN 2 phenotype the earlier the progression of MTC which forms the basis for the currently recommended codon-related concept of prophylactic thyroidectomy. In patients with sporadic MTC, routine calcitonin (CT) measurement in nodular goiter patients has been shown to reduce the frequency of advanced tumor stages. Patients with CT levels over 100 pg/ml after pentagastrin stimulation are recommended for total thyroidectomy. In patients with unexpected sporadic MTC after histological examination, completion thyroidectomy is currently only recommended when CT levels remain elevated. The extent of lymph node dissection in patients with MTC is controversial. However, with respect to lymphonodal micrometastases, systematic compartment-oriented microdissection has been shown to reduce the frequency of lymphonodal recurrence. On the other hand, to avoid unnecessary lymph node dissection, a more individualized concept is required in the future. New chemotherapeutic agents (tyrosine kinase inhibitors), therapeutic nuclids (90Yttrium-labeled octreotide), and chemoembolization of liver metastases are currently the most promising therapeutical concepts in patients with distant metastases.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is an uncommon neoplasm in children that usually is associated with the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome types 2A and 2B and with familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). Recently, germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene have been found in patients with these syndromes. Thus, with direct DNA testing, kindred members with MEN 2A, MEN 2B, or FMTC can be identified before clinical of biochemical evidence of MTC develops. It has been hypothesized that prophylactic thyroidectomy early in childhood, based on a positive genetic test, produces a better clinical outcome than thyroidectomy at the time MTC is diagnosed either clinically or biochemically. In the present report, the Washington University experience with MTC in children with MEN 2A and 2B is reviewed. Sixteen patients with MEN 2A who had thyroidectomy based on the biochemical diagnosis of MTC are compared with 14 children with MEN 2A who underwent prophylactic thyroidectomy based on direct genetic testing. In addition, the clinical results of 11 patients with MEN 2B treated for MTC are reviewed. After 3 years of follow-up there has been no biochemical or clinical evidence of MTC among the 14 children who had prophylactic thyroidectomy. Among the 16 children with MEN 2A who had thyroidectomy because of elevated basal of stimulated calcitonin levels, four (25%) have persistent of recurrent MTC after a mean follow-up period of 7.6 years. Of the 11 patients with MEN 2B who underwent thyroidectomy during childhood, one has died and seven (70%) of the remaining patients have recurrent MTC after a mean follow-up period of 11 years. The authors conclude that a significant number of children with MEN 2A or MEN 2B, who have clinical of biochemical evidence of MTC before thyroidectomy, have persistent or recurrent disease after long-term clinical follow-up. The diagnosis by direct DNA testing in patients with these syndromes allows prophylactic thyroidectomy before the development of extensive local or metastatic MTC.",

The most commonly studied exons in index cases are 8, 10, 11, and 13-16. To address the ATA guidelines regarding the sequencing of the entire coding region of RET, we selected 50 patients with sporadic MTC (sMTC) without mutations in the hot spot regions of RET for extended investigation of exons 1-7, 9, 12, 17, 18, and 19. Twenty-seven of 50 patients presented with one or more features suggesting familial disease. We found only a new RET variant (p.Gly550Glu) in one patient with MTC. Several polymorphisms were observed, and their frequency was histogram scaled by exons and introns. Eight patients were also included for somatic mutation search. We estimated the sequencing cost by stratifying into four investigation approaches: (1) hot spot exons in a new patient, (2) the remaining exons if the hot spots are negative in a patient with suspected familial disease, (3) a relative of a carrier for a known RET mutation, and (4) tumor sequencing. In spite of the increasing number of variants being described in MTC, it appears that there is no direct clinical benefit in extending RET germ line analysis beyond the hot spot regions in sMTC. The cost evaluation in apparent sMTC using a tiered approach may help clinicians make more suitable decisions regarding the benefits of investigating only the hot spots against the entire coding region of RET.",

The disease phenotype associated with this mutation was compared with that of Cys634 mutations in some other large MEN 2A families.;The distinct course of disease in the family described here is similar to that in other FMTC families and MEN 2A families with a Cys618 mutation of the RET gene, but clearly different from that in families with a Cys634 mutation. The frequency of pheochromocytomas and parathyroid disease is clearly lower, whereas cure rates and life expectancy are higher. However, in families with a Cys618 mutation, pheochromocytoma and parathyroid disease do occur.;In FMTC families with cysteine codon mutations of the RET proto-oncogene, screening for other endocrinopathies is mandatory, since these may not be MTC-only families.

In these cancers, RET activates the ERK/MAPK, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and the JAK/STAT3 pathways. Here, we tested the efficacy of a JAK1/2- inhibitor, AZD1480, in the in vitro and in vivo growth of thyroid cancer cell lines expressing oncogenic RET. Thyroid cancer cell lines harboring RET/PTC1 (TPC-1), RET M918T (MZ-CRC1) and RET C634W (TT) alterations, as well as TPC-1 xenografts, were treated with JAK inhibitor, AZD1480. This inhibitor led to growth inhibition and/or apoptosis of the thyroid cancer cell lines in vitro, as well as to tumor regression of TPC-1 xenografts, where it efficiently blocked STAT3 activation in tumor and stromal cells. This inhibition was associated with decreased proliferation, decreased blood vessel density, coupled with increased necrosis. However, AZD1480 repressed the growth of STAT3- deficient TPC-1 cells in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating that its effects in this cell line were independent of STAT3 in the tumor cells. In all cell lines, the JAK inhibitor reduced phospho-Y1062 RET levels, and mTOR effector phospho-S6, while JAK1/2 downregulation by siRNA did not affect cell growth nor RET and S6 activation. In conclusion, AZD1480 effectively blocks proliferation and tumor growth of activated RET- thyroid cancer cell lines, likely through direct RET inhibition in cancer cells as well as by modulation of the microenvironment (e.g. via JAK/phospho-STAT3 inhibition in endothelial cells). Thus, AZD1480 should be considered as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of RET- activated thyroid cancers.",

Two different mutations in codon 790 (TTG-->TTT, TTG-->TTC; Leu790Phe) and one mutation in codon 791 (TAT-->TTT; Tyr791Phe) created a phenylalanine residue.

To determine the frequency of RET mutations in HSCR and correlate genotype with phenotype, we have screened for mutations among 80 HSCR probands representing a wide range of phenotypes and family structures. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of RET's 20 exons for mutations among probands revealed eight putative mutations (10%). Sequence changes, which included missense, frameshift and complex mutations, were detected in both familial and isolated cases, among patients with both long- and short-segment HSCR and in three kindreds with other phenotypes (maternal deafness, talipes and malrotation of the gut, respectively). Two mutations (C609Y and C620R) we identified have previously been associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A), medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and, on rare occasions, HSCR. Thus, while HSCR family members may be at risk for developing neuroendocrine tumors, it follows that identical mutations in RET may be able to participate in the pathogenesis of distinct phenotypes.

Furthermore, the locus that codes for a distinct phenotype, medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) with parathyroid tumors (PTs) and no pheochromocytomas (PHEOs) (referred to as MTC with PTs), in one of the families was closely linked to two markers, D10Z1 and RBP3, with lodscores of 2.86 and 3.54, respectively, at theta = 0.

A phase III trial (ZETA trial) evaluating vandetanib in 331 patients with locally advanced or metastatic MTC showed a significant prolongation of PFS for patients receiving vandetanib compared with placebo. Toxicity surveillance in all studies reported high rates of adverse effects with diarrhea, rash, fatigue and nausea being the most commonly experienced by patients.

The shift toward earlier thyroidectomy has resulted in significantly less medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC)-related morbidity and mortality. However, very young pediatric patients might have a higher morbidity rate compared with older patients. Hardly any literature exists on complications in the very young. A retrospective single-center analysis was performed on the outcomes of MEN2 patients undergoing a prophylactic total thyroidectomy at the age of 17 or younger. Forty-one MEN2A and 3 MEN2B patients with thyroidectomy after January 1993 and at least 6 months of follow-up were included, subdivided in 9 patients younger than 3 years, 15 patients 3 to 6 years, and 20 patients older than 6 years. Postoperative hypocalcemia and other complications were registered. Twelve (27%) patients developed transient hypocalcemia and 9 (20%) patients suffered from permanent hypocalcemia, with a nonsignificant trend toward higher incidence with decreasing age. Three (7%) patients had other complications, of whom 2 were younger than 3 years. For patients younger than 3 years, the average length of stay (LOS) was 6.7 days, versus 1.7 and 3.5 days, respectively, for the older patient groups (P < 0.05). Patients with complications had a longer LOS compared with patients without (5.0 vs 2.0, P < 0.01). None of the patients had clinical signs of recurrent MTC after a mean follow-up of 10.5 years. Prophylactic thyroidectomy in very young children is associated with a higher rate of complications, causing a significant increased LOS. Irrespective age of surgery, MTC did not recur in any patient. In planning optimal timing of surgery, clinicians should take the risk of complications into account.

Single strand conformational variants (SSCVs) in exons 7 and 8 of the RET proto-oncogene were identified in eight MEN 2A and four FMTC families. The variants were observed only in the DNA of individuals who were either affected or who had inherited the MEN2A or FMTC allele as determined by haplotyping experiments. The seven variants identified were sequenced directly. All involved point mutations within codons specifying cysteine residues, resulting in nonconservative amino acid changes. Six of the seven mutations are located in exon 7. A single mutation was found in exon 8. Variants were not detected in four MEN 2B families studied for all exon assays available, nor were they detectable in 16 cases of well documented sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma or pheochromocytoma that were tested for exon 7 variants. Coinheritance of the mutations with disease and the physical and genetic proximity of the RET proto-oncogene provide evidence that RET is responsible for at least two of the three inherited forms of MEN 2.

The clinical course of this disease varies from extremely indolent tumors that can go unchanged for years to an extremely aggressive variant that is associated with a high mortality rate. As many as 75% of all medullary thyroid carcinomas are sporadic, with an average age at presentation reported as 60 years, and the remaining 25% are hereditary with an earlier age of presentation, ranging from 20 to 40 years. Germline RET proto-oncogene mutations are the genetic causes of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 and a strong genotype-phenotype correlation exists, particularly between a specific RET codon mutation and the (a) age-related onset and (b) thyroid tumor progression, from C-cell hyperplasia to medullary thyroid carcinoma and, ultimately, to nodal metastases. RET mutations predispose an individual to the development of medullary thyroid carcinomas and can also influence the individual response to RET protein receptor-targeted therapies. RET codon 609 point mutations are rare genetic events belonging to the intermediate risk category for the onset of medullary thyroid carcinoma. A large genealogy resulting in a less aggressive form of medullary thyroid carcinoma is associated with the high penetrance of pheochromocytoma and has been reported in the literature.

Features of six patients (five men, one female: age range, 39-67 years) with thyroid metastases from a GEP-NET are described. Thyroid metastases were bilateral in all patients and were associated with enlarged neck lymph nodes in five. In four cases, the thyroid tumor was either the first sign of the disease (n = 2) or was an isolated site of recurrence (n = 2). The tumors were well (n = 3) or poorly differentiated (n = 3). Five tumors for which the primary site could be determined corresponded to foregut-derived tumors (3 lungs, 1 thymus and 1 pancreatic NET). One tumor demonstrated calcitonin (CT) production as shown by immunohistochemistry and elevated plasma CT levels. However, the disease history and the clinical features strongly favored a metastasizing GEP-NET. No tumoral RET proto-oncogene mutation was found in this patient. The differential diagnosis between metastatic GEP-NET and MTC is crucial because prognosis, work-up, and treatment differ greatly.",

Not all patients with progressive MTC respond to current therapy inhibiting RET, demanding additional therapeutic strategies. We recently demonstrated that disrupting mitochondrial metabolism using a mitochondria-targeted agent or by depleting a mitochondrial chaperone effectively suppressed human MTC cells in culture and in mouse xenografts by inducing apoptosis and RET downregulation. These observations led us to hypothesize that mitochondria are potential therapeutic targets for MTC. This study further tests this hypothesis using1-ethyl-2-[[3-ethyl-5-(3-methylbenzothiazolin-2-yliden)]-4-oxothiazolidin-2-ylidenemethyl] pyridinium chloride (MKT-077), a water-soluble rhodocyanine dye analogue, which can selectively accumulate in mitochondria.;The effects of MKT-077 on cell proliferation, survival, expression of RET and tumor protein 53 (TP53), and mitochondrial activity were determined in the human MTC lines in culture and in mouse xenografts.;MKT-077 induced cell cycle arrest in TT and MZ-CRC-1. Intriguingly, MKT-077 also induced RET downregulation and strong cell death responses in TT cells, but not in MZ-CRC-1 cells. This discrepancy was mainly due to the difference between the capacities of these cell lines to retain MKT-077 in mitochondria. The cytotoxicity of MKT-077 in TT cells was mainly attributed to oxidative stress while being independent of TP53. MKT-077 also effectively suppressed tumor growth of TT xenografts.;MKT-077 can suppress cell survival of certain MTC subtypes by accumulating in mitochondria and interfering with mitochondrial activity although it can also suppress cell proliferation via other mechanisms. These results consistently support the hypothesis that mitochondrial targeting has therapeutic potential for MTC.",

A total of 340 subjects from 103 families, age 4-86, were registered.

MTC was present in 263 registrants, pheochromocytoma in 54, and hyperparathyroidism in 8 subjects. Of the patients with MTC, 53% were detected when asymptomatic, and among those with pheochromocytoma, 54%. Penetrance for MTC was 4% by age 10, 25% by 25, and 80% by 50.

Of the 13 carriers, seven (mean age: 42.6 years, range: 27-64) presented MTC as the isolated clinical phenotype, with elevated basal serum calcitonin (average: 1077.9 ng/L, range: 504-2,652) and a mean diameter of thyroid nodules of 2.97 cm (range: 1.6-4.3); they underwent a total thyroidectomy with modified bilateral/unilateral neck dissection and/or level VI lymph node dissection. The other 6 carriers did not accept surgery (4 rejected, 2 awaited). These were 2 older patients (63 and 32 years) with elevated calcitonin (1359 and 41.4 ng/L) and multi-centric hypoechoic nodules (1.5 and 0.6 cm) with calcifications in both/left thyroid lobes; and Doppler ultrasound showed normal bilateral thyroids in 4 younger carriers (median age: 8.3 years, range: 4-12) but with increased calcitonin (average: 9.7 ng/L, range: 7.87-12.2) in 3 of them. The phenotype here is consistent with the clinical symptoms reported worldwide. We recommend that screening of hotspot regions of RET should be preferentially carried out, while whole-exon sequencing should be performed when clinical signs fail to reveal hotspot mutations or different phenotype discrepancies. Moreover, we strongly suggest prophylactic thyroidectomy should be performed before age 5 in carriers with p.C618S to prevent the occurrence and metastasis of MTC.",

Over the past 15 years, the application of molecular technologies to the study of these neoplasms has elucidated critical genetic pathways associated with the development of specific thyroid tumor types. In papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), genetic events involve RET and TRK (rearrangements) and BRAF and RAS (mutations), although RAS mutations are uncommon except in the follicular variant of PTC. These genetic alterations, which rarely overlap in the same tumor, result in signaling abnormalities in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. In contrast, genetic alterations in follicular carcinomas include PAX8-PPARgamma translocations and RAS mutations while mutations of CTNNB1 and p53 have been implicated in the development and progression of poorly differentiated and undifferentiated (anaplastic) thyroid carcinomas. Germline mutations of RET are responsible for the development of heritable forms of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) while somatic mutations of this oncogene are found in a significant proportion of sporadic MTCs. The results of these studies not only have provided additional approaches to thyroid tumor classification, but also have stimulated the development of novel approaches to tumor diagnosis and additional parameters for prognostic assessment and potential biologic therapeutic strategies.",

The activating germline point mutations in the RET, which are known to induce oncogenic activation of RET tyrosine kinase, are associated with the development of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and pathogenesis of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2). The polypurine/polypyrimidine tract in the proximal promoter region of the human RET gene (-51 to -33 relative to transcription start site) is essential for basal transcriptional activity of this gene. This tract consists of a guanine-rich sequence containing five runs of at least three contiguous guanines separated by one or more bases, conforming to a general motif capable of forming an intramolecular G-quadruplex. Here, we show that specific G-quadruplex structures formed in the RET promoter region act to repress the transcription of this gene, and transcription of this gene can be controlled by ligand-mediated G-quadruplex stabilization. In this study, NSC194598, a derivative of indeno[1,2,3-de]quinazoline, was found to be a novel G-quadruplex interactive agent that interfered with transcriptional activation of mutated RET gene in human medullary thyroid carcinoma TT cells. This compound significantly reduced endogenous RET protein levels and increased apoptosis in these cells.

Demographics, clinical profiles, details of surgical procedures, and follow-up records were reviewed.;A total of 71 patients with MTC were identified. Mean age of this group was 39.9±14.1 years, and men outnumbered women 1.7:1. Some 84.5% of patients had seemingly sporadic MTC, and 15.5% had familial MTC (MEN2a=14.1%, MEN 2b=1.4%).

Staging showed that 4.8% of patients were stage I, 17.5% stage II, 14.3% stage III, and 63.6% stage IV. Treatment was as follows: 92.6% of patients had total thyroidectomy (primary or secondary); 67.6% central compartment lymph node dissection, 62.3% lateral cervical lymph node dissection, and 7.2% trans-sternal mediastinal lymph node dissection performed.

Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a neuroendocrine tumor developing from the C cells of the thyroid. Mutations in the RET proto-oncogene are involved in the pathogenesis of several forms of MTC. The deregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway seems to contribute to the tumorigenic activity of RET proto-oncogene mutations. Targeting this pathway through specific inhibitors at simple or multiple sites may represent an attractive potential therapeutic approach for patients with advanced MTCs. The aim of this review is to examine the role of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in the development and progression of MTC and the new therapeutic options that target this signaling pathway. ",

We present the clinical data for a family with MEN-2B associated with RET-A883F mutation.;The proband, a 39-year-old woman, had multifocal medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) with cervical lymphadenopathy, but no evidence of distant metastases. She was disease free after surgical resection. She also had bilateral pheochromocytomas and mucosal neuromas leading to the clinical diagnosis of MEN-2B. Genetic testing showed that the woman and her three children (3-5 years old) had the RET-A883F mutation. The children had near-normal calcitonin levels, and none had sonographic evidence of suspicious thyroid nodules or cervical lymphadenopathy.;A family with MEN-2B due to RET-A883F mutation displayed a less aggressive form of MTC than what is usually seen in patients with RET-M918T mutation. RET-A883F mutation could be a lower-risk mutation than previously thought and the current recommendation of prophylactic thyroidectomy in the first year of life may not be warranted.

Then prophylactic or surgical thyroidectomy with modified or level VI lymph node dissection and adrenalectomy were performed for the carriers. The cases were closely followed up. Massively parallel sequencing revealed four missense mutations of RET. We unexpectedly discovered that the proband's daughter with MEN 2A-related MTC presented a novel p.C634Y/V292M/R67H/R982C compound mutation, due to the involvement of p.C634Y in the proband with MEN 2A and p.V292M/R67H/R982C in the proband's husband with FMTC.

This is the first report of differential display using surgical specimens of a primary cancer and its metastases. Total RNA was extracted from tumor tissue of two patients with MTC associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN 2B) and sporadic MTC, respectively. Following reverse transcription (RT), the products were PCR-amplified and separated on a denaturating polyacrylamide gel. RT-PCR products demonstrating differential expression were reamplified and used as probes for Northern blot analysis. Six fragments for which differential expression was confirmed were cloned and sequenced. Resultant sequences were tested for homology to sequences in public data bases, and two novel MTC-derived fragments (MDF-1, MDF-2) were identified. Sensitivity of the method was confirmed by identification of a sequence encoding the calcitonin precursor flanking peptide which is expressed almost exclusively in MTC and normal thyroid C cells. Overexpression of the ribosomal genes S3a and P0 was found in the metastases. Recent reports suggest that components of the translational apparatus act as regulatory mediators of growth, proliferation, and neoplastic change.

MTC is mainly sporadic in nature, but an hereditary pattern [multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2)] is present in 20-30% of cases, transmitted as an autosomal-dominant trait due to germline mutations of the RET proto-oncogene. About 98% of patients with MEN 2 have germline mutations in exons 5, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 or 16 of the RET gene. The primary treatment of both hereditary and sporadic forms of MTC is total thyroidectomy and removal of all neoplastic tissue present in the neck. The therapeutic option for lymph node surgery should be dictated by the results of presurgical evaluation. After total thyroidectomy, measurements of serum calcitonin (CT) and carcinoembryonic antigen are of paramount importance in the postsurgical follow-up of patients with MTC as they reflect the presence of persistent or recurrent disease. Complete remission is demonstrated by undetectable and stimulated serum CT measurement. On the contrary, if serum CT is detectable under basal conditions or becomes detectable after stimulation, the patient is probably not cured, but imaging techniques will not demonstrate any disease until serum CT approaches levels >150 pg/ml. The tumour metastasises early to both paratracheal and lateral cervical lymph nodes. Metastases outside the neck may occur in the liver, lungs, bones and, less frequently, brain and skin. Surgery is the main treatment for local and distant metastases whenever feasible. Systemic chemotherapy with dacarbazine, 5-fluorouracil and doxorubicin (alone or in combination) has shown very limited efficacy, achieving only partial responses in the range of 10-20% and of short duration. Several kinase inhibitors are currently under evaluation and preliminary results are promising. Familial cases must be identified by searching for RET proto-oncogene mutations in the proband and in family members. Carriers of the RET gene are candidates for prophylactic thyroidectomy at different ages depending on the risk associated with the specific RET mutations.",

These genetic syndromes are associated with germline-activating mutations of the RET protooncogene, a cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor, which is believed to modulate specific intracellular signaling pathways involved in the regulation of C cell proliferation and apoptosis. RET-activating mutations involve two important functional areas of the receptor: the cysteine-rich extracellular domain and the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma are more commonly associated with mutations in the cysteine-rich extracellular domain, whereas multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B is exclusively associated with mutations involving the second intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Here, we describe a novel missense mutation of the RET protooncogene that substitutes arginine for proline at codon 912 of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain in a family with medullary thyroid carcinoma.",

By international efforts, we ascertained all available carriers of the RET C634W mutation. Age at diagnosis, penetrance, and clinical complications were analyzed for medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), pheochromocytoma, and hyperparathyroidism (HPT), as well as overall survival. Our series comprises 92 carriers from 20 unrelated families worldwide. Sixty-eight subjects had MTC diagnosed at age 3-72 years (mean 29). Lymph node metastases were observed in 16 subjects aged 20-72 and distant metastases in 4 subjects aged 28-69. Forty-one subjects had pheochromocytoma detected at age 18-67 (mean 36). Amongst the 28 subjects with MTC and pheochromocytoma, six developed pheochromocytoma before MTC. Six subjects had HPT diagnosed at age 26-52 (mean 39). Eighteen subjects died; of the 16 with known causes of death, 8 died of pheochromocytoma and 4 of MTC. Penetrance for MTC is 52% by age 30 and 83% by age 50, for pheochromocytoma penetrance is 20% by age 30 and 67% by age 50, and for HPT penetrance is 3% by age 30 and 21% by age 50.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN-2) is an autosomal dominant syndrome caused by germline activating mutations of the RET proto-oncogene and has been categorized into three distinct clinical forms. MEN-2A is associated with MTC, bilateral pheochromocytoma, and primary hyperparathyroidism. MEN-2B is associated with MTC, bilateral pheochromocytoma, and mucosal neuromas. The rarest clinical form of MEN-2 is familial MTC (FMTC), which is also associated with MTC, but other endocrinopathies are characteristically not present. Each clinical form of MEN-2 results from a specific RET gene mutation, with a strong correlation of phenotype expression with regard to the onset and course of MTC and the presence of other endocrine tumors and a corresponding genotype. Recommendations for screening of RET mutations are necessary as their presence or absence will influence interventional strategies such as the timing of a prophylactic thyroidectomy and extent of surgery. Timing of screenings and development of interventional strategies are extremely important in caring for patients with certain RET mutations as evidence of metastatic MTC has been documented as early as 6 years of age. Interventional strategies should consider the risks of complications of these interventions based on certain characteristics of each individual case such as age of the patient, course of disease in affected family members, and the invasiveness of any proposed surgical procedure.",

Eleven individuals from two unrelated families were found to have the D631Y germline mutation. Among them, medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) was identified in five patients: four of them had MEN 2A and one had familial MTC. They had tumors 2 cm or less in the greatest dimension that were limited to the thyroid, and they had a relatively old age above 30 at the time of diagnosis. Pheochromocytoma was detected in six patients including the four patients who had MEN 2A. All had adrenal tumors greater than 3 cm in the greatest dimension, and four of them had bilateral tumors. Two of six patients suffering with pheochromocytoma had no clinical evidence of MTC at the time of diagnosis. None had any evidence of hyperparathyroidism. This genetic profile might be related to the less vigorous clinical disease behavior and the late onset of MTC.

In addition, bilateral dissection of the cervicolateral compartment should be done in all cases with more than microscopic disease. Plasma calcitonin is an excellent marker for postoperative follow-up. Treatment of persistent/recurrent disease is primarily surgical. Hence, a reoperative cervical lymphadenectomy should be considered in patients with persistently elevated calcitonin levels and no signs of distant metastases.

Of particular interest, phenotype variability regarding the age of onset and clinical presentation of the disease, was observed.;We evaluate whether single SNPs within RET oncogene or haplotype comprising the RET variants (defined by Haploview) could predispose to early development of MTC in this family and influence the clinical manifestation.;Eight SNPs were selected based on their previous association with the clinical course of hereditary or sporadic MTC, in particular promoting an early onset of disease. The variants were initially tested in 77 G533C-carriers and 100 controls using either PCR-direct sequencing or PCR-RFLP. Association between a SNP or haplotype and age at diagnosis or presence of lymph node metastasis was tested in 34 G533C-carries with MTC. Different bioinformatic tools were used to evaluate the potential effects on RNA splicing.;An association was found between IVS1-126G > T and age at diagnosis. The variant [IVS8 +82A > G; 85-86 insC] was associated with the presence of lymph node metastases at diagnosis. In silico analysis suggested that this variant may induce abnormal splicing. This in silico analysis predicted that the [IVS8 +82A > G; 85-86 insC] could alter the splicing by disrupting and/or creating exonic splicing enhancer motifs.;We here identified two RET variants that were associated with phenotype variability in G533C-carriers, which highlights the fact that the modifier effect of a variant might depend on the type of mutation.",

        "Doc_abstract":"A quarter of patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) have germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene indicating MEN2. Therefore genetic testing is recommended for all patients presenting with MTC. Approximately 40% of MTCs have somatic RET mutations. Somatic mutations in the RAS genes are the next most common driver mutations and appear to be mutually exclusive with germline RET mutation. The single most common somatic RAS mutation is HRASQ61R (c.182A>G), reported in 4.6% to 11% of all MTCs. Mutation-specific immunohistochemistry (IHC) initially developed to identify the NRASQ61R mutation in melanoma (clone SP174) has proven highly sensitive and specific. Because the amino acid sequences for the HRAS and NRAS proteins at codon 61 are identical, we postulated that SP174 IHC would also identify the somatic HRASQ61R mutation. IHC with SP174 was performed on a tissue microarray of 68 patients with MTC including 13 (22.8%) with molecularly confirmed MEN2. Seven (10.3%) MTCs demonstrated positive staining. Six of these patients had already undergone germline RET mutation testing as part of clinical care and were all confirmed to be wild type, excluding the diagnosis of MEN2. All SP174 immunohistochemically positive MTCs were proven to have HRASQ61R mutation (and lack KRASQ61R and NRASQ61R) by Sanger sequencing. All MEN2 patients showed negative staining. We conclude that IHC with SP174 is highly specific for the HRASQ61R mutation in MTC. Because current data suggest that this mutation is mutually exclusive with germline RET mutation, IHC may also have a role in triaging formal genetic testing for MEN2.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

However, the reported prevalence of RET/PTC activation in papillary carcinoma was variable, and the clinical relevance of RET/PTC rearrangements in papillary carcinomas is still controversial. To investigate the roles of RET rearrangement in the carcinogenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma, we have studied RET activation and p53 overexpression in various thyroid lesions of the Japanese population by immunohistochemical technique. RET activation and p53 overexpression were studied in 40 papillary carcinomas, 6 poorly differentiated carcinomas, 4 undifferentiated carcinomas, 2 medullary carcinomas, 2 follicular carcinomas and 19 follicular adenomas. RET activation was observed in 12 out of 40 papillary carcinomas, while no immunoreactivity of RET was detected in other lesions. P53 overexpression was observed in only 1 of 40 papillary carcinomas, but in 2 poorly differentiated carcinomas and 4 undifferentiated carcinomas. The prevalence of RET/PTC activation in papillary carcinoma among the Japanese population was higher than in previous reports. Immunohistochemical technique is proved to be a useful tool to detect RFT/PTC activation in thyroid tumors. RET rearrangements are restricted to a well-differentiated papillary carcinoma, suggesting that RET/PTC positive papillary carcinomas do not progress to undifferentiated carcinoma.",

Therefore, it is important for clinicians to distinguish benign from malignant lesions preoperatively because the latter require a total thyroidectomy with or without neck lymph node dissection. A careful work-up and a fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) are mandatory to improve the preoperative diagnosis. High-resolution thyroid ultrasound and real-time elastosonography are adjuvant presurgical tools in selecting patients for surgery, particularly those with indeterminate or non-diagnostic cytology. Elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level in a patient with a thyroid nodule is a new laboratory predictor of thyroid cancer risk. The majority of thyroid carcinomas derive from the follicular cell, whereas medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) derives from calcitonin-producing cells. Patients with MTC are screened for germ-line RET mutations to detect carriers and identify family members for prophylactic or therapeutic thyroidectomy. ",

Leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR) protein is a widely expressed receptor-type protein-tyrosine-phosphatase that is implicated in the regulation of intracellular signaling triggered by both cell adhesion and peptide growth factors. The gene for LAR is localized to human chromosome 1p32, a region frequently deleted in tumors of neuroectodermal origin, including neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, and medullary thyroid carcinoma. On the other hand, the RET gene codes for a transmembrane tyrosine kinase and is responsible for the development of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A and 2B. To explore the potential role of LAR in RET tyrosine kinase activity and RET-induced signal transduction, we cotransfected LAR and RET with a MEN2A or MEN2B mutation (designated RET-MEN2A or RET-MEN2B) into the NIH 3T3 cell line. Here we show that LAR reduces the constitutive tyrosine autophosphorylation and kinase activity of RET-MEN2A but not RET-MEN2B, accompanying a significant decrease of phosphorylation of phospholipase Cgamma, AKT, and ERK1/2. Interestingly, LAR expression significantly decreased the levels of disulfide-linked RET-MEN2A dimerization. Moreover, reduced oncogenic activity of RET-MEN2A by overexpression of LAR was observed both by an in vitro colony formation assay and by in vivo tumorigenicity in scid mice. These results thus suggest that LAR may contribute to deactivation of the RET-MEN2A mutant protein and reduction of its oncogenic activity in vivo.",

Treatment of the RET mutant cell lines TT, TPC-1, and MZ-CRC-1 with AST487, a RET kinase inhibitor, suppressed growth and showed profound and sustained inhibition of mTOR signaling, which was recapitulated by siRNA-mediated RET knockdown. Inhibition of mTOR with INK128, a dual mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinase inhibitor, also resulted in marked growth suppression to levels similar to those seen with RET blockade. Moreover, combined treatment with AST487 and INK128 at low concentrations suppressed growth and induced apoptosis.

A median age of 52 was found. The overall median survival was 6.32 years and the 1- and 5-year overall survival was 88.37 and 62.79 %, respectively, with 10-year survival calculated at 48.63 %. On univariate analysis age, stage and surgical intervention were statistically significant indicators of prognosis. T stage and age remained statistically significant indicators of prognosis on multivariate analysis. Two patients with no history of MEN syndromes or family history of medullary thyroid cancer had RET proto-onocogene mutations.;Our patient cohort was substantially older and presented at an advanced T status than what is commonly seen in the literature.

Twenty healthy individuals and 20 MTC patients with mildly or moderately increased basal CT serum concentrations underwent the pentagastrin and omeprazole tests.;In MTC patients, the pentagastrin test produced a significantly higher increase in serum CT than did omeprazole. After the pentagastrin injection, several patients reported unpleasant side effects, including substantial tightness in 38 of 40 participants. No adverse effects were observed during the omeprazole test. A significant direct correlation was recorded between CT% (ratio of CT peak to basal value x 100) and GT% (ratio of GT peak to basal value x 100) during the omeprazole test in MTC patients (r = 0.73; P <0.001).;In spite of several adverse effects, pentagastrin remains the best provocative test for the diagnosis of MTC.

Approximately 25% of these cases are hereditary due to activating mutations in the REarranged during Transfection (RET) proto-oncogene. The course of MTC is indolent, and survival rates depend on the tumor stage at diagnosis. The present article describes clinical evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of MTC.;The aim of the consensus described herein, which was elaborated by Brazilian experts and sponsored by the Thyroid Department of the Brazilian Society of Endocrinology and Metabolism, was to discuss the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of individuals with MTC in accordance with the latest evidence reported in the literature.;After clinical questions were elaborated, the available literature was initially surveyed for evidence in the MedLine-PubMed database, followed by the Embase and Scientific Electronic Library Online/Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Literature (SciELO/Lilacs) databases. The strength of evidence was assessed according to the Oxford classification of evidence levels, which is based on study design, and the best evidence available for each question was selected.;Eleven questions corresponded to MTC diagnosis, 8 corresponded to its surgical treatment, and 13 corresponded to follow-up, for a total of 32 recommendations. The present article discusses the clinical and molecular diagnosis, initial surgical treatment, and postoperative management of MTC, as well as the therapeutic options for metastatic disease.;MTC should be suspected in individuals who present with thyroid nodules and family histories of MTC, associations with pheochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism, and/or typical phenotypic characteristics such as ganglioneuromatosis and Marfanoid habitus. Fine-needle nodule aspiration, serum calcitonin measurements, and anatomical-pathological examinations are useful for diagnostic confirmation. Surgery represents the only curative therapeutic strategy. The therapeutic options for metastatic disease remain limited and are restricted to disease control. Judicious postoperative assessments that focus on the identification of residual or recurrent disease are of paramount importance when defining the follow-up and later therapeutic management strategies.",

Laboratory studies revealed an elevated 24-h urine-free cortisol (780 micro g/d), epinephrine (66 micro g/d), and calcium (558 mg/d). Baseline serum cortisol was 23.9 micro g/dl and decreased to 12.9 and 4.5 micro g/dl after 2 mg and 8 mg dexamethasone suppression, respectively. Plasma ACTH was 170 pg/ml and decreased to 75 and 24 pg/ml after dexamethasone. Bone density t-score was -4.3 (trochanter).

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed a prominent, homogeneous pituitary; the adrenal MRI scan was not typical for a pheochromocytoma. Serum CRH was less than 6.6 pg/ml. Bilateral adrenalectomy revealed two adjacent right adrenal pheochromocytomas and corrected the elevated urine cortisol (30 micro g/d), epinephrine (0 micro g/d), and calcium (281 mg/d) but not plasma ACTH (125 pg/ml).

        "Doc_abstract":"Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a rare tumor originating from thyroid parafollicular C cells, where, in the inherited form, constitutive activation of the RET protooncogene is responsible for unrestrained cell proliferation. We previously demonstrated that somatostatin (SRIF) reduces cell growth in the human MTC cell line TT, which expresses all SRIF receptor (SSTR) subtypes and responds differently to selective SSTR agonists. The antiproliferative mechanism of SRIF and its analogs in MTC is still unclear. Src homology-2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1), a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP), is activated by somatotropin release-inhibiting factor and reduces mutated RET autophosphorylation in a heterologous system. In this study, we explore the role of PTP activation, in particular of SHP-1, in TT cells, where RET is constitutively activated. In TT cells, SRIF stimulated the PTP activity of SHP-1, which was associated with proliferation inhibition and with reduction in the MAPK pathway activation. Blockade of PTP activity with sodium orthovanadate induced cell proliferation and MAPK phosphorylation and blunted the inhibitory effects of SRIF. Moreover, SHP-1 associates with SSTR2 depending on its activation. By using a MAPK kinase inhibitor, we demonstrated that TT cell growth depends on MAPK pathway activation. Furthermore, in TT cells overexpressing SHP-1, cell proliferation and MAPK signaling were strongly down-regulated, whereas in TT cells transfected with a dominant negative form of SHP-1, cell proliferation and MAPK signaling were markedly induced. Our data demonstrate that SRIF inhibitory effects on TT cell proliferation are mediated, at least in part, by SHP-1, which acts through a MAPK-dependent mechanism.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Thyroid cancers are largely divided into medullary (MTC) and non-medullary (NMTC) cancers , depending on the cell type of origin. Familial non-medullary thyroid cancer (FNMTC) comprises about 5-15% of NMTC and is a heterogeneous group of diseases, including both non-syndromic and syndromic forms. Non-syndromic FNMTC tends to manifest papillary thyroid carcinoma , usually multifocal and bilateral . Several high-penetrance genes for FNMTC have been identified, but they are often confined to a few or single families, and other susceptibility loci appear to play a small part, conferring only small increments in risk. Familial susceptibility is likely to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental influences. The current focus of research in FNMTC is to characterise the susceptibility genes and their role in carcinogenesis. FNMTC can also occur as a part of multitumour genetic syndromes such as familial adenomatous polyposis , Cowden's disease , Werner's syndrome and Carney complex . These tend to present at an early age and are multicentric and bilateral with distinct pathology. The clinical evaluation of these patients is similar to that for most patients with a thyroid nodule. Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) arises from the parafollicular cells of the thyroid which release calcitonin. The familial form of MTC accounts for 20-25% of cases and presents as a part of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) syndromes or as a pure familial MTC (FMTC). They are caused by germline point mutations in the RET oncogene on chromosome 10q11.2. There is a clear genotype-phenotype correlation, and the aggressiveness of FMTC depends on the specific genetic mutation, which should determine the timing of surgery.",

In this study, we report that GDNF/RET signaling up-regulates sphingosine kinase (SPHK) enzyme activity, SPHK1 protein and SPHK1 message in TGW human neuroblastoma cells. Silencing of SPHK1 using siRNA inhibited GDNF-induced neurite formation, GAP43 expression, and cell growth, suggesting the important role of SPHK1 in GDNF signal transduction. Furthermore, NIH3T3 cells transfected with MEN2A type mutated RET but not c-RET demonstrated the up-regulation of SPHK activity, SPHK1 protein and SPHK1 message compared with NIH3T3 cells. The cell growth and anchorage-independent colony formation of MEN2A-NIH3T3 was inhibited with siRNA of SPHK1, while no effect of scramble siRNA was observed. These results suggest the oncogenic role of SPHK1 in MEN2A type tumor. Promoter analysis showed that activator protein 2 and specificity protein 1 binding motif of the 5' promoter region of SPHK1 gene is important for its induction by GDNF.

Usually, the patient presents with a thyroid mass or neck node metastasis along with high levels of calcitonin and preoperative fine needle aspiration biopsy suggestive of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. The role of genetic testing in such individuals, along with testing of other family members, remains somewhat unclear at this stage, especially in patients presenting with familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. Genetic testing with RET proto-oncogene mutational studies is very popular in familial medullary thyroid carcinoma, especially in children, with routine prophylactic thyroidectomy. However, its indications in adults remain unclear at this time.;Recently, a 69-year-old woman presented with a thyroid mass and underwent total thyroidectomy and central compartment dissection. She was found to have medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. The patient had four children, three of whom were found to have a RET mutation similar to their mother's, V804M. In view of the RET mutation, the three children were offered prophylactic thyroidectomy at ages 42, 45, and 47. The patient's son was noted to have extensive C-cell hyperplasia in both lobes of the thyroid. The other two individuals had benign pathology with no evidence of C-cell hyperplasia.;There is no definite consensus of opinion about the need for prophylactic total thyroidectomy in adults with RET mutation. The rarely reported 804 mutation is, however, a predictor of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. One individual in this group had extensive C-cell hyperplasia, suggesting that he would have developed medullary carcinoma of the thyroid in the future. Prophylactic thyroidectomy should be recommended in patients with RET mutation and a family history of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid; however, its role in adult family members needs to be evaluated with larger registry of prophylactic thyroidectomy. Whether these adults with rare 804-mutation could be observed and followed with serial calcitonin, ultrasound, or calcitonin stimulation tests remains to be studied.",

As a consequence, we identified 10 genes induced by both mutant proteins and eight genes repressed by them. The inducible genes include cyclin D1, cathepsins B and L, and cofilin genes that are known to be involved in cell growth, tumor progression, and invasion. In contrast, the repressed genes include type I collagen, lysyl oxidase, annexin I, and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3) genes that have been implicated in tumor suppression. In addition, six RET-MEN2A- and five RET-MEN2B-inducible genes were identified. Among 21 genes induced by RET-MEN2A and/or RET-MEN2B, six genes including cyclin D1, cathepsin B, cofilin, ring finger protein 11 (RNF11), integrin-alpha6, and stanniocalcin 1 (STC1) genes were also induced in TGW human neuroblastoma cells in response to glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor stimulation. Because the STC1 gene was found to be highly induced by both RET-MEN2B and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor stimulation, and the expression of its product was detected in medullary thyroid carcinoma with the MEN2B mutation by immunohistochemistry, this may suggest a possible role for STC1 in the development of MEN 2B phenotype.",

In our recent studies we have analyzed tumor and germline DNA extracted from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded specimens of 45 patients and additional blood samples of 38 possible MEN 2 gene carriers for the presence of RET point mutations in exons 10 and 11 by non-radioactive single strand conformation polymorphism analysis (PCR-SSCP) and for exon 16 by heteroduplex gel electrophoresis. Mutational analysis was performed by fluorescence-based dideoxy terminator cycle sequencing of PCR-products with an automated DNA sequencer. Materials included 19 patients with MEN 2A associated tumors (13 medullary thyroid carcinomas, 6 pheochromocytomas), 3 patients with MEN 2B associated medullary thyroid carcinomas and 23 patients with clinically sporadic tumors (16 medullary thyroid carcinomas, 7 phenochromocytomas).

Only two non-synonymous variants (T278N/exon 4 and D489N/exon 7) were found in two cases. However, these two variants were not uncommon in our elderly population.;We found that all eight MTC patients with a family history or with the other phenotypes of MEN 2 had RET mutations, whereas no significant RET mutation was found in seven patients with isolated MTC without family history and other endocrine diseases. Molecular scanning of the RET gene in MEN 2 and MTC in Taiwanese patients probably should be limited to exons 10, 11 and 16, initially to be cost-effective.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The study of thyroid tumor genetics has great relevance to surgeons and facilitates understanding tumor pathogenesis, prediction of tumor behavior, and management decisions. The genes implicated can be broadly categorized as oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes. The RET oncogene has well established roles in the development of both papillary (PTC) and medullary (MTC) thyroid carcinoma. Genetic screening for germline RET mutations in members of multiple endocrine neoplasia type II (MEN-II) families is now widely performed, and prophylactic thyroidectomy in gene carriers is advisable at an early age. Patients with apparently sporadic MTC can also be screened to rule out familial disease. The demonstration of a RET rearrangement in a patient's PTC may have prognostic significance, but as yet there are no management implications. The thyrotropin receptor (TSH-R) and Gsalpha become oncogenic through point mutation and are associated with the development of toxic thyroid adenomas. The ras oncogene is implicated in the early stages of development of several thyroid tumor types. Tumor-suppressor genes also have a role in thyroid tumor formation. The p53 gene appears to be involved in the process of transformation to the anaplastic phenotype and the PTEN gene in the development of follicular adenomas but not carcinomas. There is still limited evidence for the so called adenoma-carcinoma sequence of the thyroid follicular cell. Loss of heterozygosity studies have enabled identification of tumor-suppressor genes, and their findings suggests differences in the pathogenesis of PTCs compared with follicular cancers. Surgical decision-making will benefit from these basic molecular advances, which rapidly translates into improved patient management.",

The etiology of ectopic PTH gene expression was examined, focusing on GCM2 which has a crucial role in developing parathyroid glands. We observed ectopic expression of the PTH and GCM2 genes in tissues from the tumor and metastatic lymph nodes. However, GCM2 gene expression was also detected in adjacent thyroid tissue and lymphoblasts, in which PTH gene expression was absent. Hypomethylation of the PTH promoter, which is reportedly associated with ectopic production of PTH, was not seen in either the tumor tissue or metastatic lymph nodes. Meanwhile, DNA hypomethylation was seen in a CpG island identified in the GCM2 promoter region, regardless of whether or not the GCM2 gene was expressed. We showed that transcriptional activity of the CpG island sequences cloned into a reporter plasmid was dependent upon DNA methylation. Finally, we present the first report of a PTH-producing MTC. There was no apparent association between ectopic PTH and GCM2 gene expression, despite co-expression of the two genes. Neither genomic rearrangement nor DNA hypomethylation in the PTH gene appeared responsible for ectopic production of PTH. Although DNA hypomethylation may be necessary for the GCM2 gene expression, ectopic expression of GCM2 won't be possible by DNA hypomethylation alone.",

There are several conflicting reports on the influences of RET expression and RET/PTC rearrangements on the clinical outcome of thyroid cancers. Therefore, the wild-type RET gene expression and RET/PTC-1, RET/PTC-2, RET/PTC-3 rearrangements were examined in thyroid carcinomas and other thyroid diseases.;Thirty-six papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs), 8 follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTCs), 4 anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATC), 7 follicular adenomas (FAs), 23 hyperplasias, 6 normal thyroid tissues, and 39 normal portions from each tumor were included in this study. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemical analyses were used to identify the RET gene and RET/PTC rearrangements.;From the RT-PCR analysis, 68.9% of the PTCs, a single case of FTC, and 22.2% of the hyperplasias expressed the RET gene. No RET gene expression was observed in ATCs, FAs, or normal thyroid tissues. One RET/PTC-1 and one RET/PTC-2 rearrangement were detected in the PTCs. No RET/PTC-3 rearrangement was detected in any specimen.

The two methods are agreed in PTC and hyperplastic nodules, but not in FA and FTC.;PTCs among Koreans rarely showed RET/PTC rearrangements, but commonly showed increased RET gene expression.

Germline high penetrance gain-of-function RET mutations cause multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, of which medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and pheochromocytoma are components, whereas loss-of-function mutations cause Hirschprung disease (HSCR). A low-penetrance founder locus, in linkage disequilibrium with a RET ancestral haplotype comprising specific alleles at three intron (IVS) 1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (haplotype 0) and SNP A45A, predisposes to the majority of isolated HSCR. A different low-penetrance locus, in linkage disequilibrium with IVS 1 haplotype 2 and SNP S836S, was associated with a subset of sporadic MTC. We, therefore, sought to determine whether RET might also be a low-penetrance gene for apparently sporadic pheochromocytoma. We analyzed 104 pheochromocytoma cases without germline mutations in RET, VHL, SDHD, and SDHB for their status at A45, S836, three IVS 1 SNPs, and a novel upstream insertion/deletion variant. Pheochromocytoma cases were not associated with either A45A or S836S, but we found that cases were associated with haplotype 0 (P = 0.032). However, unlike HSCR, this pheochromocytoma-associated haplotype 0 was not associated with A45A. Taken together with the strengthening of association with the addition of the 5' insertion/deletion variant data (P = 0.016), our observations suggest the presence of a low-penetrance pheochromocytoma susceptibility locus in a region upstream of the putative loci for HSCR and apparently sporadic MTC.",

The average age at thyroidectomy was 9.8 years (range, 4-29). Tg levels were detectable 1.5 months to 31 years postoperatively in 11 patients (79%), all of whom were <15 years old at thyroidectomy. Median thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was 2.5 mIU/L and 13.4 mIU/L in patients with undetectable and detectable Tg, respectively. Of those with detectable Tg, 5 had cervical ultrasonographic examination: Two showed no residual tissue in the thyroid bed, and 3 showed remnant thyroid tissue.;Tg levels can identify patients with remnant thyroid tissue after prophylactic thyroidectomy. Ultrasonography can determine whether thyroid tissue remains posterolaterally that is at risk of MTC recurrence. Maintaining normal TSH may prevent growth of remaining thyroid follicular cells.",

Complete total thyroidectomy is the treatment of choice for PTC, FTC, and MTC. Radioiodine is routinely recommended in high-risk patients and considered in intermediate risk DTC patients. DTC cancer cells, during tumor progression, may lose the iodide uptake ability, becoming resistant to radioiodine, with a significant worsening of the prognosis. The lack of specific and effective drugs for aggressive and metastatic DTC and MTC leads to additional efforts toward the development of new drugs. Several genetic alterations in different molecular pathways in TC have been shown in the past few decades, associated with TC development and progression. Rearranged during transfection (RET)/PTC gene rearrangements, RET mutations, BRAF mutations, RAS mutations, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 angiogenesis pathways are some of the known pathways determinant in the development of TC. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are small organic compounds inhibiting tyrosine kinases auto-phosphorylation and activation, most of them are multikinase inhibitors. TKIs act on the aforementioned molecular pathways involved in growth, angiogenesis, local, and distant spread of TC. TKIs are emerging as new therapies of aggressive TC, including DTC, MTC, and anaplastic thyroid cancer, being capable of inducing clinical responses and stabilization of disease. Vandetanib and cabozantinib have been approved for the treatment of MTC, while sorafenib and lenvatinib for DTC refractory to radioiodine. These drugs prolong median progression-free survival, but until now no significant increase has been observed on overall survival; side effects are common.

The recent discovery of new germline mutations in RET, SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, VHL, NF1, TMEM127, MAX genes, increased the rate of genetic disease from 10% to 28% in patients with apparently sporadic tumor. RET germline mutations cause multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 syndrome (MEN 2A) characterized by complete penetrance of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), and lower prevalence of Pheo and hyperparathyroidism. We describe the genetic etiology of an apparently sporadic case of monolateral Pheo in a 42-year-old male patient. A new (not previously reported) MEN 2A-associated germline RET mutation located in exon 11 (Glu632Gly, caused by an A>G point mutation at position 1895 of the RET cDNA) was found in the patient but not in his living first-degree relatives. This observation increases the number of possible germline RET mutations. Genotype-phenotype correlation of this new genetic alteration is unknown, but this rare mutation is probably associated with a low risk for MTC (usually the first tumor diagnosed in MEN 2A syndrome) and with the development of Pheo before the onset of MTC. Since we expect MTC to occur in our patient, strict follow-up is mandatory. Our findings emphasize the relevance of genetic testing in patients with Pheo, especially when the clinical presentation (family history, young age at diagnosis, multiple locations, malignant lesions, and bilateralism) is suggestive.

        "Doc_abstract":"Control of cell growth and differentiation occurs via extracellular signals known as growth factors. Growth factors are high affinity ligands for transmembrane receptors belonging to the family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). A number of genetic evidences have implicated RTKs in human diseases including developmental disorders and cancer. For instance, germline missense mutations involving the Ret receptor are found in patients affected by multiple endocrine neoplasia types 2A and 2B (MEN2A and MEN2B) or familial medullary thyroid carcinomas. Somatic mutations in the Kit receptor are found in mastocytomas and in gastrointestinal tumors. Germline and sporadic mutations of the Met receptor have been described in kidney and hepatocellular carcinomas. Overexpression of the HER-2/neu receptor in breast cancer has been associated with tumor progression. The enzymatic activity of RTKs is strictly regulated and is usually inhibited under basal conditions. Receptor activation triggers a biochemical signalling cascade inside the cytoplasm, named signal transduction, which is subverted during the malignant transformation of cells. Signal transduction by RTKs is a multistep process which includes: (i) Ligand binding and receptor dimerization, (ii) receptor phosphorylation on tyrosine residues; (iii) recruitment to the receptor and activation of cytoplasmic signaling molecules that transmit signals to the nucleus. Each of the steps involved in this process can potentially be targeted to block the aberrant properties of tyrosine kinase receptors. By using the MET oncogene as a model this review focuses on the strategies that can be applied to therapeutically target RTKs.",

Thus, MEN1 is characterized by the occurrence of parathyroid, pancreatic islet and anterior pituitary tumors; MEN2 is characterized by the occurrence of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) in association with phaeochromocytoma and parathyroid tumors; MEN3 is characterized by the occurrence of MTC and phaeochromocytoma in association with a marfanoid habitus, mucosal neuromas, medullated corneal fibers and intestinal autonomic ganglion dysfunction, leading to megacolon; and MEN4, which is also referred to as MENX, is characterized by the occurrence of parathyroid and anterior pituitary tumors in possible association with tumors of the adrenals, kidneys, and reproductive organs. This review will focus on the clinical and molecular details of the MEN1 and MEN4 syndromes. The gene causing MEN1 is located on chromosome 11q13, and encodes a 610 amino-acid protein, menin, which has functions in cell division, genome stability, and transcription regulation. Menin, which acts as scaffold protein, may increase or decrease gene expression by epigenetic regulation of gene expression via histone methylation. Thus, menin by forming a subunit of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) complexes that trimethylate histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4), facilitates activation of transcriptional activity in target genes such as cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors; and by interacting with the suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog family protein (SUV39H1) to mediate H3K methylation, thereby silencing transcriptional activity of target genes. MEN1-associated tumors harbor germline and somatic mutations, consistent with Knudson's two-hit hypothesis. Genetic diagnosis to identify individuals with germline MEN1 mutations has facilitated appropriate targeting of clinical, biochemical and radiological screening for this high risk group of patients for whom earlier implementation of treatments can then be considered. MEN4 is caused by heterozygous mutations of CDNK1B which encodes the 196 amino-acid CDK1 p27Kip1, which is activated by H3K4 methylation. ",

In most patients, DNA isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes was tested for RET gene mutations by sequencing and accordingly MTC form was assessed. Genetic testing was performed in the relatives of patients with familial MTC in order to distinguish asymptomatic mutation carriers from noncarriers.;RET gene mutations were identified in 46 patients (22%). The others were found noncarriers and sporadic MTC was diagnosed. MEN 2A/FMTC syndrome (multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A/ familial type of MTC) was diagnosed in 44 patients, MEN 2B syndrome (multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B) in 2 patients. In patients with sporadic and familial MTC, age at diagnosis and multifocal occurrence was analysed, and the results were found to be in accordance with those of other research centres. However, the distribution and frequency of mutations, as well as some clinical data, such as the frequency of pheochromocytoma occurrence as the first manifestation of MEN syndrome, differed from the published data, and further studies are necessary to reveal the reasons of these differences.;DNA testing for RET gene mutations is reliable as a diagnostic tool and therefore it should be performed for screening of all patients with MTC or other diseases of MEN syndrome.",

Among those operated on for detectable basal CT, intrathyroidal tumors were found when CT was below 60 pg/ml, whereas either node metastases or larger tumors were observed when CT was above 60 pg/ml. No correlation among serum CT, age, and type of RET mutation was observed. Thirty GC were still biochemically negative at the annual control.;The time of thyroidectomy in GC with negative CT could be personalized and safely planned when stimulated CT becomes positive, independent of the type of RET mutation and patient's age.

Hereditary MTC is associated with mutations in the RET protooncogene, which encodes for a tyrosine kinase. We postulated that Src tyrosine kinases regulate MTC proliferation. Proliferation of the human MTC cell line, TT, was examined in the presence of a Src-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PP2, or genistein. Cell counts were performed with a Coulter counter or by flow cytometry. DNA synthesis was evaluated by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. A cell death ELISA was used to assess apoptosis. Akt phosphorylation was determined by Western immunoblot. MAPK activity was measured using an immunoprecipitation kinase assay, and MAPK inhibition was achieved with SB202190 (p38 MAPK) and PD098059 (MAPK kinase). Data were analyzed by ANOVA. Compared with controls, PP2 reduced DNA synthesis, abolished Akt phosphorylation, and increased apoptosis. The MAPK kinase inhibitor, PD098059, attenuated DNA synthesis, whereas genistein caused modest declines in cell count and DNA synthesis and minimal changes in apoptosis. We conclude that Src-dependent MTC proliferation occurs via increased DNA synthesis and reduced apoptosis. The latter effect may be mediated by Akt survival signals.

Recent advances in better understanding the pathogenesis and altered signaling pathways-especially in medullary and differentiated thyroid cancers (MTCs and DTCs)-have begun to change this situation substantially. Vandetanib, an orally bioavailable inhibitor of the RET kinase that is constitutively activated in MTC, has now been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in progressive and symptomatic metastatic MTC; it has been shown to delay time to progression relative to placebo in a randomized phase III trial. Further, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGF-R) inhibitory agents including sorafenib, sunitinib, pazopanib, and axitinib that are already approved in the United States for use in advanced renal cell carcinoma have shown high response rates in treating advanced DTCs in multiple phase II trials, and have become commonly used in progressive radioiodine-refractory metastatic DTC. Yet additional agents are now in development, with several including XL184 (cabozantinib) also showing promise in DTC and MTC. In anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), progress has been slower, with the greatest apparent gains resulting more from the application of systemic therapies earlier in the disease course, especially when used in conjunction with initial surgical and radiation therapies.

Somatic RET mutations are also seen in roughly 50% of sporadic medullary thyroid carcinomas. Few studies, however, have evaluated the role of microRNA expression in these tumors. DNA and RNA were extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks of 15 medullary thyroid carcinomas [10 with RET mutations (3 hereditary) and 5 without RET mutations] and 5 non-tumor thyroid glands. miRNA expression of 754 targets was quantitated by real-time PCR using the ABI OpenArray miRNA assay. Three miRNAs showed significant differential expression and were validated in a larger cohort of 59 cases by real-time PCR. Expression of potential downstream targets and upstream regulators was also investigated by real-time PCR. miR-375 and miR-10a were significantly overexpressed, while miR-455 was underexpressed in medullary thyroid carcinomas. Expression of all 3 miRNAs was validated in the larger cohort of cases (miR-375, p=3.3×10(-26); miR-10a, p=5.6×10(-14); miR-455, p=2.4×10(-4)). No significant differences in miRNA expression were found between RET mutation positive and negative tumors nor between sporadic and hereditary tumors. Expression of the potential downstream targets of miR-375, YAP1 (a growth inhibitor) and SLC16a2 (a transporter of thyroid hormone), was down-regulated in the tumors suggesting that miR-375 is a negative regulator of the expression of these genes. Thus, differential expression of miR-375, miR-10a and miR-455 may be important for tumor development and/or reflect C-cell lineage of medullary thyroid carcinoma.

It was not possible to define whether K666E is a de novo or inherited RET variant in the patient, as the family history was negative for MTC, and the carrier status of family members could not be tested. Our results, together with a recent report of co-segregation of the mutation in three MTC families, suggest that K666E is a causative MTC mutation. As we have shown that the same patient allele carries both K666E and G691S variants, the latter known to increase downstream RET signaling, a possible role for the G691S polymorphism has also been investigated. We have demonstrated that, although RET-G691S is not oncogenic per se, it enhances the transforming activity of the RET-K666E mutant, thus suggesting a modifier role for this functional polymorphism.",

To explore genetic profiles of MTCs, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues from MTC patients were assayed on the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel v2. Eighty-four sporadic MTC samples and 36 paired normal thyroid tissues were successfully sequenced. We discovered 101 hotspot mutations in 18 genes in the 84 MTC tissue samples. The most common mutation was in the ret proto-oncogene, which occurred in 47 cases followed by mutations in genes encoding Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (N = 14), serine/threonine kinase 11 (N = 11), v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (N = 6), mutL homolog 1 (N = 4), Kiesten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (N = 3) and MET proto-oncogene (N = 3). We also evaluated anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement by immunohistochemistry and break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Two of 98 screened cases were positive for ALK FISH. To identify the genomic breakpoint and 5' fusion partner of ALK, customized targeted cancer panel sequencing was performed using DNA from tumor samples of the two patients. Glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 (GFPT1)-ALK and echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK fusions were identified. Additional PCR analysis, followed by Sanger sequencing, confirmed the GFPT1-ALK fusion, indicating that the fusion is a result of intra-chromosomal translocation or deletion. Notably, a metastatic MTC case harboring the EML4-ALK fusion showed a dramatic response to an ALK inhibitor, crizotinib. In conclusion, we found several genetic mutations in MTC and are the first to identify ALK fusions in MTC. Our results suggest that the EML4-ALK fusion in MTC may be a potential driver mutation and a valid target of ALK inhibitors. Furthermore, the GFPT1-ALK fusion may be a potential candidate for molecular target therapy. ",

Accordingly, several investigators have advocated prophylactic total thyroidectomy for medullary thyroid carcinoma at an early age in MEN 2 gene carriers identified by DNA analysis. Before applying this strategy in Japan, the biological behavior of each category of tumor in MEN 2 syndrome, and medullary thyroid carcinoma in particular, should be well understood.

Mutations that affect its extracellular domain, stimulate spontaneous homodimerization and elevate the basal tyrosinkinase activity. The codon 634 of the gene is considered a hot-spot site, since it is mutated in 85% of the MEN2A families. Our group developed in 2002 an indirect and costless strategy to detect alterations in this site. We present a family suspected of having MEN2A. We applied our PCR based indirect strategy on the DNA of the index patient and found that there was no mutation in that site. Posterior sequencing of exon 10 and 11 confirmed that the mutation affecting this family was in codon 611. Thus, we developed a new costless family-specific strategy based on mutagenic PCR and enzymatic cuts to diagnose all the family members. A seven-year old boy with this mutation was preventively thyroidectomized.

We analyzed the clinical manifestation and course in 21 patients harboring a de novo RET M918T mutation. Mean age at MEN-2B diagnosis was 14.2 years (range: 1-31 years). All patients had medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). At the time of syndrome diagnosis, oral manifestations (bumpy lips, ganglioneuroma), ocular manifestations (corneal fibers, conjunctivitis sicca), intestinal dysfunctions, musculoskeletal manifestations, and pheochromocytoma were found in 86%, 90%, 74%, 79%, and 19% of the patients, respectively. At the time of follow-up examination, the symptoms were found at higher frequency. Severe intestinal manifestation was predominantly found in patients with prepubertal onset (< or = 12 years) of MTC (n = 4/10) compared with patients with late onset (> 12 years) of MTC (n = 0/11) (40% versus 0%; p = 0.019).

During mean follow-up of 55.8 months (range: 3-161 months), seven patients (33%) died from MTC. In conclusion, whereas most typical MEN-2B symptoms were found to be age-related, severe intestinal manifestation was found to be predominantly expressed in patients with early onset of MTC. Furthermore, in patients with early onset of MTC who could not be biochemically cured, the long-term prognosis was found to be worse than that of non-cured patients with late onset of MTC, suggesting an additional pathological process in the younger subgroup reinforcing the very high transforming in vitro activity of the M918T RET mutation.",

Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor targeting Ret and VEGFR, showed antitumor activity in preclinical studies of MTC.;In this phase II trial of sorafenib in patients with advanced MTC, the primary end point was objective response. Secondary end points included toxicity assessment and response correlation with tumor markers, functional imaging, and RET mutations. Using a two-stage design, 16 or 25 patients were to be enrolled onto arms A (hereditary) and B (sporadic). Patients received sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily.;Of 16 patients treated in arm B, one achieved partial response (PR; 6.3%; 95% CI, 0.2% to 30.2%), 14 had stable disease (SD; 87.5%; 95% CI, 61.7% to 99.5%), and one was nonevaluable. In a post hoc analysis of 10 arm B patients with progressive disease (PD) before study, one patient had PR of 21+ months, four patients had SD >or= 15 months, four patients had SD <or= 6 months, and one patient had clinical PD. Median progression-free survival was 17.9 months. Arm A was prematurely terminated because of slow accrual. Common adverse events (AEs) included diarrhea, hand-foot-skin reaction, rash, and hypertension. Although serious AEs were rare, one death was seen. Tumor markers decreased in the majority of patients, and RET mutations were detected in 10 of 12 sporadic MTCs analyzed.;Sorafenib is reasonably well tolerated, with suggestion of clinical benefit for patients with sporadic MTC.

We previously demonstrated the expression of oncogenic rearranged versions of RET in papillary thyroid carcinomas: tumors derived from thyroid follicular cells. To assess the expression of the normal RET proto-oncogene in follicular cells, we analyzed its expression in a panel of neoplasias originating from thyroid follicular epithelial cells: papillary carcinomas and both follicular adenomas and carcinomas. We also demonstrated the presence of RET normal transcripts in two follicular thyroid carcinoma lymph node metastases. Moreover, we found the presence of the RET/ELE1 transcript, the reciprocal complementary form of the oncogenic fusion transcript ELE1/RET, in a papillary thyroid carcinoma specimen expressing the RET/PTC3 oncogene, thus demonstrating that the RET promoter is active in those cells after rearrangement. Finally, we show that in a papillary carcinoma-derived cell line expressing the proto-RET receptor and the related GFRalpha2 co-receptor, GDNF treatment induced RET tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent signal transduction pathway, indicating that RET could be active in thyroid follicular cells.",

Gain-of-function mutations of RET are associated with human cancer. Gene rearrangements juxtaposing the tyrosine kinase domain to heterologous gene partners have been found in sporadic papillary carcinomas of the thyroid (PTC). These rearrangements generate chimeric RET/PTC oncogenes. In the germline, point mutations of RET are responsible for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2A and 2B) and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). Both MEN 2 mutations and PTC gene rearrangements potentiate the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of RET and, ultimately, activate the RET downstream targets. Loss-of-function mutations of RET cause Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) or colonic aganglionosis. A deeper understanding of the molecular signaling of normal versus abnormal RET activity in cancer will enable the development of potential new treatments for patients with sporadic and inherited thyroid cancer or MEN 2 syndrome.

RET encodes a receptor with tyrosine kinase activity that targets several intracellular signaling cascades, such as RAS-RAF-ERK1/2, PIK3-AKT, and STAT transcription factors. The objective of this study was to assess the function of three germ line RET variants Arg886Trp, Ser649Leu, and Glu511Lys of undetermined pathogenic significance, which were found in three kindreds of isolated AS-MTC. For this purpose, we employed vectors expressing each of the RET variants and measured the number of NIH3T3 transformation foci and soft agar colonies, the degree of activation of known RET intracellular signaling targets (ERK1/2, STAT1, STAT3, and TCF4), and the extent of ERK1/2 inhibition on sorafenib treatment. We found that RET variants Arg886Trp and Glu511Lys have shown increased in vitro transforming potential in a glial-derived neurotrophic factor-dependent manner. In contrast, the Ser649Leu variant did not significantly increased the number of foci and agar colonies relative to wild-type RET (RET-WT). The variants Glu511Lys and Arg886Trp showed 10- and 12.5-fold ERK1/2 activation respectively, that was significantly higher than that observed for RET-WT (fivefold). Increased levels of STAT1 and TCF4 activation were only observed for RET Arg886Trp (2.5- and 3-fold versus 1.2- and 2-fold in RET-WT respectively).

The gold standards for diagnosis are histochemical study of the rectal mucosa and molecular analysis of RET, which in familial cases detects MEN 2B at a preclinical stage so that early total prophylactic thyroidectomy can be performed. In non-familial cases, the diagnosis can be suggested by the presence of GI symptoms, ganglioneuromas, and/or the typical facies. The intestinal innervation pattern, analyzed with the acetylcholinesterase technique, is pathognomonic for MEN 2B. In our protocol a rectal biopsy is, therefore, the first measure.

The disease has three subtypes, which are distinguished by the presence of additional phenotypes. In particular, pheochromocytoma occurs in approximately 50% of patients with the MEN 2A or MEN 2B subtypes, but is not found in patients with the milder disease subtype, familial MTC (FMTC). All subtypes of MEN 2 are caused by activating mutations of the RET (REarranged in Transfection) proto-oncogene. RET encodes a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase, required for development of neuroendocrine cell types and the kidneys. All MEN 2 subtypes are associated with single amino acid substitution mutations that are found in either the extracellular domain or in the kinase domain of RET. There are strong genotype-phenotype correlations in MEN 2 between patient phenotype and the specific residue that is mutated. MEN 2A is primarily associated with substitutions at five extracellular cysteine residues, while 95% of MEN 2B is associated with a single methionine to threonine mutation in the kinase domain (M918T). In FMTC, RET mutations are more broadly distributed, with both extracellular cysteines and intracellular sites implicated. In all cases, MEN 2-RET mutations result in constitutive activation of the receptor, although the mechanism and relative functional effects of the mutations vary. Recent advances in functional characterization and development of molecular models of RET and of various MEN 2-RET mutants are helping us understand tissue-specific differences in oncogenic potential conferred by the different RET mutations.

RESULTS: Sporadic medullary thyroid cancer typically presents as an isolated unilateral mass. Familial tumors tend to be multifocal and bilateral. In patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A, pheochromocytomas and parathyroid hyperplasia also may develop. Care is taken to avoid operating on a patient with occult pheochromocytoma. Total thyroidectomy and central lymph node dissection are the keys for successful surgical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Surgery is the cornerstone of treatment for medullary carcinoma of the thyroid.

Through the Brazilian Genetic Screening Program developed at our institution, we additionally report the combination of these two mutations (p.C634Y/p.Y791F) in the RET gene in four other unrelated families. The overall penetrance of MTC and pheochromocytoma in patients with the p.C634Y/p.Y791F mutations was 79% and 13%, respectively.;Our data emphasises that a comprehensive analysis of the RET gene may reveal multiple germline mutations in MEN 2 patients who exhibit an atypical clinical course of the disease.",

A 67-year-old woman presented a firm thyroid nodule, and preoperative examination revealed medullary thyroid carcinoma with primary hyperparthyoidism and no pheochromocytoma.

A 40-year-old man, the proband's son, was shown to have the same RET mutation, underwent total thyroidectomy prophylactically, and only microscopic foci of medullary thyroid carcinoma were found. A 10-year-old boy, the proband's grandson also having the same RET mutation, showed normal basal serum calcitonin level and has been followed up conservatively. To our knowledge, 18 patients of 6 families with the Cys630 mutations have been reported so far. This is only the second reported case with primary hyperparathyroidism.

The age-related risk of MTC is associated with the type of RET mutation. Our aim was to identify prognostic factors associated with recurrent MTC in MEN 2 patients. METHODS In a nationwide case-control study, all patients who underwent total thyroidectomy in the Netherlands under the age of 20 years were classified into standard (1), high (2), or very high risk (3) for MTC based on RET-mutation type. Disease-free patients were compared with those with recurrent disease. RESULTS A total of 93 patients were included in the study. Sixty-six percent had MTC on histology, the youngest being 1 year old. Codon 634 was most affected. Sixteen (18%) patients had persistent or recurrent disease, one of whom died. Significantly associated determinants of outcome in univariate analysis were higher age at surgery, no age-appropriate prophylactic surgery according to risk level, elevated preoperative calcitonin levels, affected codon, and the presence of lymph node metastases at surgery. On multivariate analysis only age of surgery was the single independent factor associated with persistent disease. CONCLUSIONS Prophylactic thyroidectomy beyond the recommended age is associated with persistent/recurrent disease. In addition, codon 634 mutation is associated with a high risk of recurrence requiring early surgery for all these patients.",

We recently observed this phenomenon in a large familial MTC (FMTC) family carrying the RET-S891A mutation. Among genetic modifiers affecting RET-driven MTC, a role has been hypothesized for RET-G691S non-synonymous polymorphism, though the issue remains controversial. Aim of this study was to define the in vitro contribution of RET-G691S to the oncogenic potential of the RET-S891A, previously shown to harbour low transforming activity.;The RET-S891A and RET-G691S/S891A mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis, transiently transfected in HEK293T cells and stably expressed in NIH3T3 cells. Their oncogenic potential was defined by assessing the migration ability by wound healing assay and the anchorage-independent growth by soft agar assay in NIH3T3 cells stably expressing either the single or the double mutants. Two RET-S891A families were characterised for the presence of RET-G691S.;The functional studies demonstrated that RET-G691S/S891A double mutant displays a higher oncogenic potential than RET-S891A single mutant, assessed by focus formation and migration ability. Moreover, among the 25 RET-S891A carriers, a trend towards an earlier age of diagnosis was found in the MTC patients harboring RET-S891A in association with RET-G691S.;We demonstrate that the RET-G691S non-synonymous polymorphism enhances in vitro the oncogenic activity of RET-S891A. Moreover, an effect on the phenotype was observed in the RET-G691S/S891A patients, thus suggesting that the analysis of this polymorphism could contribute to the decision on the more appropriate clinical and follow-up management.",

In this paper, we report three apparently unrelated medullary thyroid carcinoma cases homozygous for these mutations. To clarify the phenotypic heterogeneity associated with these mutations, we compare the clinical data and age of diagnosis among these three homozygous patients, six other heterozygous cases from the same populations, and other homozygous and heterozygous subjects reported previously. The data are consistent with a model in which codon 804 mutations have low penetrance, the developing of medullary thyroid carcinoma being associated with a second germline or somatic mutation.

In this study we sought to identify such locus.

Haplotype distribution were also analyzed. A total of 58 patients with sMTC were included in the study. In addition, 100 unselected, unrelated race-, age-, and gender-matched normal controls were also evaluated.;Although the overrepresentation of IVS1-126G>T remains present in our current sMTC series, thus supporting our previous hypothesis, no differences were obtained among cases and controls in the distribution of the variants tested upstream this position. On the other hand, the frequency and distribution of G691S/S904S variants were similar in both groups of study, leading to exclude their role in sMTC in our series.;These findings would suggest that the major genetic events contributing to the appearance of sMTC may reside in several different RET loci.

        "Doc_abstract":"Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified Dok1 as a docking protein for RET tyrosine kinase. Dok1 bound more strongly to RET with a multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2B mutation than RET with a MEN2A mutation and was highly phosphorylated in the cells expressing the former mutant protein. Analysis by site-directed mutagenesis revealed that tyrosine 361 in mouse Dok1 represents a binding site for the Nck adaptor protein and tyrosines 295, 314, 361, 376, 397, and 408 for the Ras-GTPase-activating protein. We replaced tyrosine 361 or these six tyrosines with phenylalanine (designated Y361F or 6F) in Dok1 and introduced the mutant Dok1 genes into the cells expressing the wild-type RET or RET-MEN2B protein. Overexpression of Dok1 or Dok1-Y361F, but not Dok1-6F, suppressed the Ras/Erk activation induced by glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor or RET-MEN2B, implying that this inhibitory effect requires the Ras-GTPase-activating protein binding to Dok1. In contrast, overexpression of Dok1, but not Dok1-Y361F or Dok1-6F, enhanced the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) and c-Jun activation. This suggested that the association of Nck to tyrosine 361 in Dok1 is necessary for the JNK and c-Jun activation by glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor or RET-MEN2B. Because a high level of the JNK phosphorylation was observed in the cells expressing RET-MEN2B, its strong activation via Nck binding to Dok1 may be responsible for aggressive properties of medullary thyroid carcinoma developed in MEN 2B.",

The RET receptor plays a crucial role in regulating cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival through embryogenesis. Activating mutations in RET lead to the development of several inherited and noninherited diseases. Germline point mutations are found in the cancer syndromes multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2, including MEN 2A and 2B, and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. These syndromes are autosomal dominantly inherited. The identification of mutations associated with these syndromes has led to genetic testing to identify patients at risk for MEN 2 and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma and subsequent implementation of prophylactic thyroidectomy in mutation carriers. In addition, more than 10 somatic rearrangements of RET have been identified from papillary thyroid carcinomas. These mutations, as those found in MEN 2, induce oncogenic activation of the RET tyrosine kinase domain via different mechanisms, making RET an excellent candidate for the design of molecular targeted therapy. Recently, various kinds of therapeutic approaches, such as tyrosine kinase inhibition, gene therapy with dominant negative RET mutants, monoclonal antibodies against oncogene products, and nuclease-resistant aptamers that recognize and inhibit RET have been developed. The use of these strategies in preclinical models has provided evidence that RET is indeed a potential target for selective cancer therapy. However, a clinically useful therapeutic option for treating patients with RET-associated cancer is still not available.",

We studied the sensitivity of an MTC cell line and xenograft to irinotecan, alone and in combination with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, CEP-751.;In TT cell culture and xenografts, irinotecan treatment was highly effective. This effect was augmented by treatment with CEP-751. Treatment of TT cell xenografts resulted in durable complete remission in 100% of the mice, with median time to recurrence of 70 d for irinotecan alone and more than 130 d for irinotecan plus CEP-751. Although irinotecan induced an S phase checkpoint arrest in TT cells, CEP-751 in combination with irinotecan resulted in a loss of this arrest. CEP-751 induced a loss in the induction of the DNA repair program marked by phospho-H2AX and the checkpoint pathway marked by the activated Chk1 pathway.;Irinotecan treatment was highly effective in a preclinical model of human MTC, resulting in complete remission in 100% of the xenografts treated. The duration of remission was further enhanced by combination with the kinase inhibitor, CEP-751. These results suggest that irinotecan, alone or in combination, may be useful for the treatment of MTC.",

However, a distinct lag period exists not only in the recognition but also in the medical treatment of patients with MEN2. Here we present a comprehensive genetic and clinical analysis of MEN2 among Chinese families followed from 1975 to 2011. Our series comprises 36 index cases and 134 relatives from 11 independent families.;Genetic diagnosis was performed in all participants by direct sequencing all relevant RET exons. Thyroidectomy was performed in 50 patients with varying cervical neck dissection procedures. Patients with pheochromocytoma (PHEO) underwent specific surgery. Demographic, clinical profiles, mutation types, tumor histopathologic features, and follow-up records were systematically analyzed.;The RET mutations p.C634Y (n=34), p.C634R (n=6), p.C618S (n=13), p.V292M/R67H/R982C (n=7), p.L790F (n=2), and p.C634Y/V292M/R67H/R982C (n=1) were confirmed in 31 index cases and then identified in 32 at-risk relatives (mutation carriers), with MEN2A as the most common clinical subtype. The overall penetrance of PHEO in patients with MEN2A was 46.7%. A total of 50 patients underwent thyroidectomy, and there was a significant lowering of their mean age at thyroidectomy and the tumor diameter of the mutation carriers that were detected and operated on compared with the index cases (age at first surgery: 29.3 vs. 39.3 years, p<0.05; maximum size: 1.1 vs. 3.3 cm, p<0.001). There was also a decrease in the TNM staging and the proportion of patients who underwent inappropriate initial thyroid surgery (pN1: 31.6% vs. 100%, p<0.001; inappropriate surgery: 0% vs. 29%). Meanwhile, disease-free survival (DFS) increased (DFS: 100% vs. 58.1%, p<0.05). Both medullary thyroid carcinoma-specific (n=1) and PHEO-specific (n=5) deaths were reported during the study period.;Our results further substantiate that gene scanning of all relevant RET exons is a powerful tool in the management of MEN2 patients, especially in asymptomatic carriers, and has led to earlier diagnosis and more complete initial treatment of patients with MEN2 in China.",

Our data and the data from the literature suggest a possible pathogenesis of PTC caused by exon 13 and 14 RET mutations that affect the intracellular domain of the encoded protein.

The ret proto-oncogene shows a pattern of expression restricted to neuroendocrine tissue. Its fusion with H4 allows the expression of the activated form in thyroid papillary carcinomas. Therefore the detection of ret transcripts is a tool to investigate ret activation in thyroid neoplasms. Here we show the detection by in situ hybridisation, of activated ret transcripts in human thyroid papillary neoplasms that were positive for PTC activation by Southern blot analysis.

RET functions as a multicompetent receptor complex that includes alphaGFRs and RET. Somatic rearrangements of RET designated as RET/PTC (from papillary thyroid carcinoma) were identified in papillary thyroid carcinoma before RET was recognized as the susceptibility gene for MEN2. There are now at least at least 15 types of RET/PTC rearrangements involving RET and 10 different genes. RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3 are by far the most common rearrangements. All of the rearrangements are due to DNA damage and result in the fusion of the RET tyrosine-kinase (RET-TK) domain to the 5'-terminal region of heterologous genes. RET/PTC rearrangements are very common in radiation-induced tumors but have been detected in variable proportions of sporadic (i.e., non-radiation associated) papillary carcinomas. It is estimated that up to approximately half the papillary thyroid carcinomas in the United States and Canada harbor RET/PTC rearrangements, most commonly RET/PTC-1, followed by RET/PTC-3 and occasionally RET/PTC-2. The cause of these rearrangements in sporadic papillary carcinomas is not known, but the close association between their presence and the papillary carcinoma phenotype indicates that they play a causative role in tumor development. The proposed mechanisms of RET/PTC-induced tumorigenesis and the clinical and pathologic implications of RET/PTC activation are discussed.",

Low expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) p27(Kip1) is present in thyroid tumors, and recent evidence demonstrates p27 downregulation by the active RET mutant, RET/PTC1, found in papillary thyroid carcinoma. This implicates decreased p27 activity as an important event during thyroid tumorigenesis. However, p27(-/-) mice develop MEN-like tumors only in combination with loss of another CDKI, p18(Ink4c). This suggests that p18 and p27 functionally collaborate in suppression of tumorigenesis, that loss of both is critical in the development of MEN tumors and that both p18 and p27 are regulated by RET. We report that induction of the constitutively active MEN2A-specific RET mutant, RET2A(C634R), correlates with reduced p18/p27, and elevated cyclin D protein levels, leading to increased CDK activity, increased pRb phosphorylation and proliferation under growth arrest conditions. Mechanistically, RET2A represses p18/p27 mRNA levels while elevating cyclin D1 mRNA levels. RET2A expression also correlates with decreased p27 protein stability. RET2A-mediated regulation of p18 and p27, but not of cyclins D1 and D2, requires functional mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. Additionally, RET2A-dependent p18 repression is required and sufficient to increase cell proliferation. Perhaps most significantly, MEN2A adrenal tumors also display these changes in cell cycle expression profile, demonstrating the biological relevance of our cell culture studies. Our results demonstrate for the first time that RET2A regulates p18, and suggest that loss of not only p27 but also of p18 expression is a key step in MEN tumorigenesis.",

Since MEN2-associated mutations involve only hot spots, the molecular genetic analysis of the RET proto-oncogene constitutes the perfect tool for the diagnosis of MEN2, being thus considered the standard method. The molecular genetic screening for MEN2-associated RET germline mutations should be carried out in all patients with an apparently sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma or pheochromocytoma. This testing needs to include exons 10, 11, and 13 to 16 of the RET proto-oncogene. Such investigations are aimed at identifying an index person of a new MEN2 family. The detection of such a RET germline mutation is the basis for predictive molecular genetic testing within an affected family, and allows the exclusion or identification of gene carriers. For these family members at risk, prophylactic total thyroidectomy is recommended as a curative procedure, according to a risk-adapted, genetically based treatment algorithm. The management of such affected families should be always complemented by oncological and genetic counselling.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Routine calcitonin assay programs and recent studies on the natural history of familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) have greatly added to our understanding of C-cell hyperplasia (CCH) and refined its classification. This article is an update on CCH physiopathology related to clinical presentation. With this combined approach, two types of CCH that differ by their physiological characteristics can be identified: neoplastic CCH and reactive (also called physiological) CCH. Neoplastic CCH is caused by a germline mutation of the RET protooncogene in a multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) syndrome. It progresses to MTC following a time line that depends on the RET mutation involved. CCH may actually be a misnomer for a neoplastic condition that some authors have proposed to call \"in situ-MTC\". Reactive CCH is considered to be caused by a stimulus that is external to the C-cell, and its premalignant potential is not documented. Many situations such as hypercalcemia, hyperparathyroidy, chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis or follicular tumors have been associated with reactive CCH, the pathogenesis of which remains unclear. But C-cell density in normal patients is subject to important variability, and several studies have demonstrated the dramatic male predominance in physiological CCH when hypercalcitoninemia was a random discovery. These data suggest that a number of conditions which were previously associated with reactive CCH might be purely fortuitous. Our clinical/pathological confrontation contributes to appropriately distinguishing between various CCH types, and in turn to identify the best way of managing patients.",

        "Doc_abstract":"MTC occurs sporadically or as part of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) syndromes or as familial MTC (FMTC). 97% of the patients affected with MEN 2B show a germline mutation in codon 918 (exon 16) within the tyrosine kinase domain of the RET protooncogene. In 97% of MEN 2A patients, the germline mutation affects one of five cysteine codons within exons 10 and 11 in the extracellular domain. Only 65% of FMTC patients are found to have a germline mutation of RET. These mutations affect either the cysteine rich domain (as MEN 2A mutations) or codons 768 (exon 13) or 804 (exon 14) within the tyrosine kinase domain. In families affected with hereditary form of MTC, mutation analysis is now commonly used to determine genetic status. Individuals without the mutation would be considered unaffected and would not require further biochemical screening. Individuals who inherit the MEN 2 mutation would undergo biochemical screening tests and have thyroidectomy as soon as these tests are abnormal. Risk of phaeochromocytoma in affected patients depends on the position of RET mutation. This risk is high if the patient has a codon 634 mutation and low if he has a mutation within exon 10, 13 or 14. Frequency of adrenal follow-up could so be adapted with regards to the localisation of RET germline mutation. When a new MTC case is diagnosed, the distinction between a true sporadic and a de novo hereditary case is important for future clinical management of both the patient and his family. The absence of RET exons 10, 11, 13, and 14 germline mutations appears to rule out MEN 2A to a high probability. However the presence of a familial form of MTC cannot be excluded conclusively. Since codon 918 somatic mutations are found in 25% of MTC from truly sporadic cases, mutation analysis of RET in tumour DNA may help in distinguishing the sporadic cases from those that are in fact heritable.",

Various molecular methods have been used to identify the different mutations, including DNA sequencing, restriction enzymatic analyses, chemical cleavage mismatch, Single Stranded Conformational Polymorphism [SSCP], and Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis [DGGE]. These techniques, although useful and accurate, are labor intensive and some involve the use of radioactivity. We have developed a multiplex PCR assay simultaneously to amplify exons 10, 11, and 13 of the RET proto-oncogene. The multiplex PCR product is then analyzed on a modified Mutation Detection Enhancement [MDE] matrix for heteroduplex identification and visualized with ethidium bromide. Distinct heteroduplexes were detected for each known RET proto-oncogene mutation available in our laboratory (nine in exon 10, five in exon 11, one in exon 13, and the single exon 16 mutation). Presymptomatic DNA diagnosis of MEN 2 is essential since pentagastrin-stimulated calcitonin studies can occasionally produce false positive results and lead to unnecessary thyroidectomies. Prophylactic thyroidectomy is recommended by age 5 or 6 once a mutation is identified in a patient, since penetrance is very high. MDE heteroduplex detection provides a quick, efficient, and inexpensive method of screening for RET mutations in MTC patients with unknown mutations, or for presymptomatic diagnosis in individuals at risk for inheriting a known RET mutation. Confirmation of the specific mutation can be achieved by restriction enzymatic digestion (if feasible) or by DNA sequencing.",

Whether this approach is justified, and, if so, when and to which extent surgery should be performed remained to be clarified. A questionnaire was sent to all surgical departments in Germany and Austria. All of the patients who fulfilled the following criteria were enrolled: (1) preoperatively proved RET mutation; (2) age </= 20 years, (3) clinically asymptomatic thyroid C cell disease; and (4) TNM classification pT0-1/pNX/pN0-1/M0. Seventy-five patients were identified, and fifteen mutations were detected in six codons. Two adolescents had unilateral pheochromocytomas as part of the multiple endocrine neoplasia II (MEN-II) syndrome. No hyperparathyroidism was noted. All patients underwent total thyroidectomy, and 57 patients went on to have lymph node dissection. Parathyroid glands were removed in 34 patients and autografted in 11. Histopathology revealed MTC in 46 patients (61%, youngest 4 years); C cell hyperplasia (CCH) only was detected in the other 29 patients. Three patients had lymph node metastases (LNMs) the youngest being age 14 years. Calcitonin levels were not useful for differentiating between CCH and MTC, but in all patients with LNMs at least the stimulated calcitonin levels were assayed. After surgery, five patients (6.7%) sustained permanent hypoparathyroidism, and one patient (1.3%) had a permanent unilateral recurrent nerve palsy. All but three patients (96%) were biochemically cured. In conclusion, prophylactic total thyroidectomy can be performed safely in experienced centers. We recommend prophylactic total thyroidectomy at age 6. Cervicocentral lymph node dissection should be included when calcitonin levels are elevated or if patients are older than 10 years. Bilateral lymph node dissection should be performed if LNMs are suspected or when patients with elevated calcitonin are older than 15 years.",

Undifferentiated (anaplastic) thyroid tumors are supposed to be derived, through a process of progression, from previously differentiated neoplasms. A common genetic alteration in thyroid tumors is the rearrangement of the tyrosine kinase-encoding RET proto-oncogene, leading to the generation of chimeric RET/PTC oncogenes. To define the characteristics of the thyroid tumor subset with RET rearrangements, we have investigated its activation by a combined immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-PCR approach in a series of 316 well-characterized thyroid tumors representative of the main diagnostic groups. RET activation was detected in 81 of 201 (40.3%) papillary carcinomas. It correlated with tumors exhibiting the \"classic\" morphological features of papillary cancer or with the microcarcinoma subtype (P = 0.017). RET activation in papillary carcinoma was not associated with clinical markers (such as large tumor size, extrathyroidal extension, or metastases) of increased morbidity. Follicular-type neoplasms (61 adenomas and 22 carcinomas), as well as the aggressive poorly differentiated (15 cases) or undifferentiated (anaplastic) carcinomas (17 cases), were negative. This study demonstrates that all thyroid carcinomas harboring activating RET rearrangements exhibit a well-differentiated phenotype, that of papillary carcinoma, and indicates that the subset of RET/PTC-positive papillary carcinomas do not progress to more aggressive, less differentiated tumor phenotypes.",

Elevations in serum calcium trigger release of calcitonin from the C-cell, which in turn functions to inhibit absorption of calcium by the intestine, resorption of bone by the osteoclast, and reabsorption of calcium by renal tubular cells. Oncogenic transformation of the thyroid C-cell is thought to progress through a hyperplastic process prior to malignancy with increasing levels of serum calcitonin serving as a biomarker for tumor burden. The discovery that multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 is caused by activating mutations of the RET gene serves to highlight the RET-RAS-MAPK signaling pathway in both initiation and progression of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Thyroid C-cells are known to express RET at high levels relative to most cell types; therefore, aberrant activation of this receptor is targeted primarily to the C-cell, providing one possible cause of tissue-specific oncogenesis. The role of RET signaling in normal C-cell function is unknown though calcitonin gene transcription appears to be sensitive to RET activation. Beyond RET, the modeling of oncogenesis in animals and screening of human tumors for candidate gene mutations have uncovered mutation of RAS family members and inactivation of Rb1 regulatory pathway as potential mediators of C-cell transformation. A growing understanding of how RET interacts with these pathways, both in normal C-cell function and during oncogenic transformation, will help in the development of novel molecular-targeted therapies.

Patients with MEN 2B have a single point mutation (ATG to ACG) at codon 918 of RET. Therefore, a direct DNA testing has been developed to provide a highly accurate technique of detecting kindred members who have inherited a specific mutation associated with MEN 2A, MEN 2B or FMTC. In USA and Europe, prophylactic thyroidectomy has been performed on the basis of positive DNA testing, and the presence of a C-cell hyperplasia or a small medullary thyroid carcinoma was confirmed in each patient operated. Through nationwide survey in Japan, 233 patients with MEN 2 syndrome have been identified. They consisted of 180 MEN 2A, 18 MEN 2B, 13 FMTC and 22 unclassified patients. At follow-up, 47% of patients had recurrent medullary thyroid carcinoma and 5.7% of patients died of the disease.

RET protein comprises an extracellular portion with four cadherine-like domains and a cysteine- rich region important for intermolecular interactions; a hydrophobic transmembrane domain; an intracellular part comprising the juxtamembrane domain with regulatory function and the catalytic domain that phosphorylates the tyrosine residues of substrates. RET is involved in the development of enteric nervous system and renal organogenesis during embryonic life. Mutations of RET are associated to a subset of colorectal cancer and are commonly found in hereditary and sporadic thyroid cancer. Activating point mutations in the cystein-rich or the kinase domain of RET cause multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), a group of familial cancer syndromes characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, parathyroid hyperplasia and ganglioneuromatosis of the gastroenteric mucosa. Rearranged forms of RET (termed RET/PTC) are detected in the majority of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC). At present, the therapeutic treatment available for these pathologies is the total or partial surgical removal of thyroid, associated with radio-iodine therapy or chemotherapy: despite widespread use of multimodality treatment, survival rates have not improved much in the past few decades, which suggests that new treatment options should be explored.

In a second step, we used a COLD-PCR approach followed by HRM genotyping analysis for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of a pregnant woman carrying a fetus with a C634Y mutation. HRM analysis revealed differences in melting curve shapes that correlated with patients diagnosed for MEN2A by gene sequencing analysis with 100% accuracy. Moreover, the pregnant woman carrying the fetus with the C634Y mutation revealed a melting curve shape in agreement with the positive controls in the COLD-PCR study. The mutation was confirmed by sequencing of the COLD-PCR amplification product. In conclusion, we have established a HRM analysis in serum samples as a new primary diagnosis method suitable for the detection of C634Y mutations in MEN2A patients. Simultaneously, we have applied the increase of sensitivity of COLD-PCR assay approach combined with HRM analysis for the non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of C634Y fetal mutations using pregnant women serum.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The RET/PTC oncogene, a rearranged form of the RET proto-oncogene, has been found to be associated with human papillary thyroid carcinomas. To investigate whether RET/PTC causes papillary thyroid carcinoma, we generated a transgenic mouse model of papillary thyroid carcinoma with targeted expression of RET/PTC1 in the thyroid gland. Thyroid tumors in these RET/PTC1 transgenic mice are characterized by a slow growth rate, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-responsive tumor progression, and loss of radioiodide-concentrating activity despite continued expression of thyroglobulin (Tg). The time of tumor onset appears to be dependent on the expression level of RET/PTC1 in these transgenic mice. In high-copy RET/PTC1 transgenic mice, cellular abnormalities, including a slightly increased proliferation rate, aberrant follicle formation, and loss of radioiodide-concentrating activity, can be readily identified at embryological day 18. To identify which signaling pathway or pathways perturbed by RET/PTC1 are essential for RET/PTC1 to induce tumor development, we generated transgenic mice carrying a thyroid-targeted RET/PTC1 triple mutant, which contains tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations at tyrosine residues 294, 404, and 451. Initial characterization of the thyroid glands of these RET/PTC1 triple-mutant transgenic mice showed no change in follicular morphology or radioiodide-concentrating activity. This finding suggests that signaling pathways mediated by one or more of these three phosphotyrosine binding sites are essential for RET/PTC1 to induce thyroid tumor development. Finally, in order to investigate whether tumors induced by RET/PTC3 are more aggressive than those tumors induced by RET/PTC1, we also generated thyroid-targeted RET/PTC3 transgenic mice.",

Total RNA recovered from paraffin-embedded thyroid cancer surgical specimens was analyzed for ret/PTC 1, 2, and 3 mutations using RT-PCR with Southern blotting to maximize detection sensitivity. Ret/PTC rearrangements were identified in 42.9% of thyroid carcinoma and 46.2% of adenoma subjects. Among the positive carcinoma specimens, three were follicular carcinomas. Ret/PTC 1, the predominant rearrangement, was more prevalent in nonirradiated compared with irradiated carcinomas (66.7 vs. 27.0%; P = 0.04). Ret/PTC activation was associated with male gender. The strengths of this study included analysis of age-, gender-, and ethnicity-matched groups; molecular analysis using two techniques; and a complete blinding of laboratory analysis from clinical features.

Seventy members were studied and DNA analysis for RET mutations was performed in fifty-eight of them. Exons 10, 11, 13, 14 and 16 of the RET proto-oncogene were analyzed by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis, direct DNA sequencing and/or restriction enzyme analysis. No mutations of the RET proto-oncogene were identified in 1 of 9 families with MEN 2A and in the 3 families with FMTC. In 7 MEN 2A families, the mutation was demonstrated in codon 634 and in 1 family it was demonstrated in codon 620. There was a low frequency, about 8%, of hyperparathyroidism associated with MEN 2A. The specific causative mutations for pararthyroid disease were C634R or C634Y. Among the MEN 2A individuals there was one case with de novo C634R mutation and one case, C634Y, with cutaneous lichen amyloidosis which predated by 24 years the diagnosis of MEN 2A. In 2 children who were MEN 2A gene carriers, microscopic medullary thyroid carcinomas were found. These data show a low frequency of hyperparathyroidism in our cases and provide further evidence that individuals with C634R as well as with C634Y mutations of the RET proto-oncogene could be at risk for parathyroid disease.

Activation of RET is a mechanism of oncogenesis in medullary thyroid carcinomas where both germline and sporadic activating somatic mutations are prevalent. At present, there are no known specific RET inhibitors in clinical development, although many potent inhibitors of RET have been opportunistically identified through selectivity profiling of compounds initially designed to target other tyrosine kinases. Vandetanib and cabozantinib, both multi-kinase inhibitors with RET activity, are approved for use in medullary thyroid carcinoma, but additional pharmacological activities, most notably inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor - VEGFR2 (KDR), lead to dose-limiting toxicity. The recent identification of RET fusions present in ~1% of lung adenocarcinoma patients has renewed interest in the identification and development of more selective RET inhibitors lacking the toxicities associated with the current treatments. In an earlier publication [Newton et al, 2016; 1] we reported the discovery of a series of 2-substituted phenol quinazolines as potent and selective RET kinase inhibitors. Here we describe the development of the robust screening cascade which allowed the identification and advancement of this chemical series.  Furthermore we have profiled a panel of RET-active clinical compounds both to validate the cascade and to confirm that none display a RET-selective target profile.

Stimulated CT is generally better than basal, but in the lower ranges false negatives and false positives still occur. In families with hereditary MTC, RET gene mutation analysis has superseded measurement of plasma CT in the detection of asymptomatic disease gene carriers. All individuals with apparently sporadic MTC, but in whom there is some suspicion of familial disease, should also have RET genetic analysis. A negative DNA result practically excludes the possibility of hereditary MTC in families where an index case has been investigated and obviates the need for further biochemical evaluation. Disease gene carriers may be divided into three distinct risk groups depending on the specific RET gene mutation in the family. The age at which presymptomatic surgery has to be performed depends on the risk group to which the patient belongs. Compared with the results of DNA analysis, the results of CT stimulation tests have become less important in the assessment of timing of surgery. During follow-up of patients who underwent surgery, measurement of plasma basal CT is still useful. The high sensitivity of measuring stimulated CT levels does not outweigh the burden of life-long periodic stimulation tests and the limited clinical consequences of slightly elevated levels.

The purpose of this study was to (1) report the clinical correlates of 5 additional c804 kindreds, and (2) clarify therapeutic options in children.;Thirty-eight members from five c804 kindreds underwent genetic analysis. Biochemical, operative, and pathology reports were reviewed.;Twenty-three gene carriers were identified, of whom 14 had thyroidectomy. Medullary thyroid carcinoma was found in 7 patients (aged 5-56 years), C-cell hyperplasia in 6 patients (aged 13-40 years), and normal histology in a single patient (aged 27 years). One patient with medullary thyroid carcinoma died of metastases (aged 12 years). Nine of the 23 gene carriers delayed operation, 4 of whom had calcitonin testing. Three of the 4 patients had abnormal calcitonin levels and a single patient was negative (aged 40 years). Of the remaining 9 patients, 2 await thyroidectomy, and 3 have refused evaluation.;Penetrance of the c804 mutation is highly variable. Medullary thyroid carcinoma associated with this genotype has aggressive potential. Prophylactic thyroidectomy in childhood is a viable approach.",

After validated evaluation of HRM, the method was utilized for primary screening of 28 pathogenic c-RET mutations distributed among nine exons of c-RET gene.;Validation experiments confirm the repeatability, robustness, accuracy and reproducibility of HRM. All c-RET gene pathogenic variants were detected with no occurrence of false-positive/false-negative results.;The data provide basic information about design, establishment and validation of HRM for primary screening of genetic variants in order to distinguish heterozygous point mutation carriers among the wild-type sequence carriers.

This approach is often successful in early disease; however, treatment options for advanced endocrine malignancies remain unsatisfactory and prognosis is poor. In particular, cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation therapy often show only limited and transient efficacy and are associated with significant toxicity. Thus, new treatment options are urgently needed. Advances in the understanding of the molecular pathology of endocrine malignancies has recently led to identification of key events in endocrine oncogenesis (e.g. oncogenic RET mutations in medullary thyroid carcinoma or RET/PTC rearrangements in papillary thyroid carcinoma). These new insights are increasingly matched by new compounds (e.g. tyrosine kinase inhibitors) targeting signaling pathways essential for tumor cell survival, proliferation and metastases. Accordingly, a rapidly growing number of preclinical investigations and early clinical trials in endocrine malignancies have been initiated. First results of \"targeted therapies\" in medullary and differentiated thyroid carcinoma are impressive: phase II trials targeting RET or VEGF receptor kinases led to objective tumor response in up to 50% of patients. This review covers these recent molecular and clinical advances which most likely will dramatically alter the treatment of endocrine malignancies within the coming decade.",

Subtypes of MEN 2 include MEN 2A, MEN 2B and familial MTC (FMTC) which differ in pattern of additional lesions or--in FMTC--lack of pheochromocytoma. In 2009, after extensive review of the literature, the guidelines of the American Thyroid Association made several recommendations regarding clinical and genetic diagnostic testing and treatment options. In this article, the recently published literature is reviewed and concerns regarding future perspectives are added. In particular, a critical handling of rare DNA variants and double mutations is necessary. Up to now, mutation-specific risk profiles and mutation-associated treatment recommendations are unavailable. We emphasise the need for approved centres for treatment of patients affected by MEN 2, not only adults but young children as well. As a high level of skill is required for endoscopic adrenal-sparing surgery, surgeons should declare their expertise before operating such patients.

MEN2 has been reported in approximately 500 to 1000 families worldwide and the prevalence has been estimated at approximately 1:30,000. Two different forms, sporadic and familial, have been described for MEN2. Sporadic form is represented by a case with two of the principal MEN2-related endocrine tumors. The familial form, which is more frequent and with an autosomal pattern of inheritance, consists of a MEN2 case with at least one first degree relative showing one of the characteristic endocrine tumors. Familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) is a subtype of MEN2 in which the affected individuals develop only medullary thyroid carcinoma, without other clinical manifestations of MEN2. Predisposition to MEN2 is caused by germline activating mutations of the c-RET proto-oncogene on chromosome 10q11.2. The RET gene encodes a single-pass transmembrane tyrosine kinase that is the receptor for glial-derived neurotrophic growth factors. The combination of clinical and genetic investigations, together with the improved understanding of the molecular and clinical genetics of the syndrome, helps the diagnosis and treatment of patients. Currently, DNA testing makes possible the early detection of asymptomatic gene carriers, allowing to identify and treat the neoplastic lesions at an earlier stage. In particular, the identification of a strong genotype-phenotype correlation in MEN2 syndrome may enable a more individualized treatment for the patients, improving their quality of life. At present, surgical treatment offers the only chance of cure and therefore, early clinical and genetic detection and prophylactic surgery in subjects at risk are the main therapeutic goal.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Thyroid cancer is rare in childhood and consists of several different histopathologic groups with widely varying clinical behavior. Major categories include differentiated, medullary, and anaplastic thyroid cancer. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and various sarcomas also can arise in the thyroid. This article discusses differentiated and medullary thyroid cancer in childhood and adolescence. Differentiated thyroid carcinoma is divided into three subtypes: papillary, papillary with follicular elements, and follicular. Medullary tumors may occur in isolation but more frequently are associated with one of the multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes (MEN). A paradoxical observation concerning patients with differentiated thyroid cancer is that 70% to 80% present with regional lymph node involvement, and more than 20% have distant metastases at diagnosis. However, survival rates in series with median follow-ups of 10 to 20 years have been 90% to 100%. These data have implications for the surgical management of pediatric patients with differentiated thyroid cancer. The cellular and genetic factors that underlie this paradoxical behavior are not understood. Management of children with medullary thyroid cancer was revolutionized by the identification of specific mutations in the ret oncogene that predict for multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes. This has allowed sensitive and specific diagnosis based on analysis of the patient's white blood cells. Because this leads to earlier diagnosis, total thyroidectomy can be performed at a much earlier age than if the increase in serum calcitonin was used to identify C-cell hyperplasia or early carcinoma. At present, genetic testing should be performed at birth in children suspected of having the MEN IIb syndrome and no later than 1 year of age for those with possible MEN IIa. If specific ret gene mutations are noted, total thyroidectomy is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is established. For MEN IIa patients, thyroidectomy probably should be performed before 5 years of age, whereas patients with MEN IIb may require surgery during the first 6 months to 1 year of life.",

The overall survival benefit with cabozantinib is as yet unclear, with no significant benefit observed in two interim analyses (one prespecified, and one unplanned and conducted at the request of the US FDA). The tolerability profile of oral cabozantinib is typical for a small molecule targeting the VEGFR and other tyrosine kinase-mediated pathways, with adverse events associated with the inhibition of the VEGF pathway (e.g. gastrointestinal perforation, haemorrhage, hypertension and venous thrombosis) reported in the phase III study.

Ribonucleic acid extracted from frozen tissue was reverse transcribed; PCR was performed to amplify ret/PTC-1, 2, and -3. The TPC-1 cell line was the positive control for ret/PTC-1. All tumors were characterized morphologically. Clinical data were collected. The 57 papillary and 3 follicular carcinomas were resected from 44 female patients and 15 males. The average age at diagnosis was 46.2 yr (range. 24-83 yr). Three patients had a history of neck irradiation. At diagnosis, 11 patients had extrathyroidal tumor extension, 20 had lymph node metastases, and 1 had lung metastasis. Thirteen patients had tall cell papillary carcinomas; 3 tumors had focal insular or anaplastic dedifferentiation. The average follow-up was 13.4 months, during which 4 patients had recurrent disease. No deaths occurred. One papillary carcinoma (1.7%) was positive for ret/PTC-1, none was positive for ret/PTC-2, and 2(3.4%) were positive for ret/PTC-3. Although all 3 patients who had tumors containing ret/PTC rearrangements were under the age of 45 yr (range, 26-44 yr) and had small tumors (< 1.2 cm), 2 of these 3 patients presented with lymph node metastases, and the third had lymphatic invasion. ret/PTC oncogene expression did not correlate with radiation history. In summary, ret/PTC oncogene rearrangements were found in 3 of 60 (5%) thyroid carcinomas and were not present in tumors with aggressive morphological features. However, we found ret/PTC rearrangements in young patients (< 45 yr of age) with small thyroid carcinomas showing a predisposition for lymphatic involvement, suggesting a possible role in the development of this subgroup of tumors.",

Unlike well differentiated tumors, PDCs are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The general prevalence of RET/PTC rearrangement in thyroid PDC and its impact on patient outcome are unknown. To address these issues and to identify prognostically relevant clinicopathologic parameters, we have investigated a series of 62 PDCs. RET/PTC rearrangement, analyzed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry using antibodies specific for the tyrosine kinase and juxtamembrane portions of the RET protein, was identified in 8/62 (12.9%) PDCs. RET/PTC was more common in cases with histologic evidence indicating coexistence with or possible evolution from a well differentiated papillary carcinoma (5 of 25 tumors, 20%) but did not correlate with other clinicopathologic parameters. The relatively low prevalence of RET activation in PDCs argues against a major role for RET/PTC in the progression from well to poorly differentiated thyroid tumor phenotypes. Survival analysis demonstrates that poor survival in PDC is associated with old age, male sex, invasion of extrathyroidal soft tissues, coexistence in the same tumor of oncocytic features with insular growth pattern, and distant metastases but not RET activation.",

In this article an attempt is made to summarize and update our knowledge about physiologic or reactive C-cell hyperplasia, neoplastic C-cell hyperplasia (medullary carcinoma in situ), and medullary microcarcinoma. Seldom recognized preoperatively, physiologic C-cell hyperplasia is associated with inflammatory, metabolic, and neoplastic thyroid disorders as well as with hypercalcemia. However, the pathogenesis is still unclear. Although physiologic C-cell hyperplasia may progress to medullary carcinoma, the full malignant potential is unknown. Problems related to the definition of physiologic C-cell hyperplasia are discussed. Immunohistochemistry and quantitative analysis are required for the diagnosis. By contrast, C-cell hyperplasia associated with MEN II syndromes or familial medullary carcinoma can be diagnosed preoperatively in asymptomatic children or adolescents by the detection of germline mutations of the RET protooncogene. Morphologic and genetic abnormalities support the idea that C-cells in the familial form of C-cell hyperplasia are neoplastic and can be recognized with conventional stains. Therefore, the number of C-cells is irrelevant for the diagnosis. Medullary microcarcinoma is a neoplasm that measures < 1 cm. The sporadic variant is usually an incidental microscopic finding, whereas the familial form can be diagnosed by genetic testing. Its morphologic features and biologic behavior differ from those of larger medullary carcinomas. The frequency of medullary microcarcinoma will probably increase with the use of genetic testing.",

There appears to be a correlation between specific types of RET mutation and clinical phenotypes of the cancers involved.

They were positive for direct RET mutation analysis. CT was assayed by immunoradiometric method before and after Pg. Pg test results before and after thyroidectomy, age at operation and histologic results were analysed.;Mean preoperative peak CT was 82.5 +/- 34.0 pg/ml (22-133): among these 36 patients preoperative basal and peak CT were normal in 16 and 2 patients respectively. F-MTC and MEN 2A patients were different according to their preoperative peak CT levels (58.1 +/- 24.0 vs 97.6 +/- 31.3) pg/ml, p < 0.01) and age at thyroidectomy (20.4 +/- 10.5 vs 11.6 +/- 7.6 years, p < 0.01 by Mann-Whitney test).

RET/PTC expression has been demonstrated to inhibit transcription of thyroid-specific genes. To study the signal transduction pathways responsible for this, we generated PCCL3 thyroid cells with doxycycline-inducible expression of RET/PTC3, RET/PTC3(Y541F), or PTC2/PDZ. Acute expression of RET/PTC(Y541F) appropriately interacted with Shc, an intermediate in the activation of the Ras pathway, but failed to activate PLCgamma. By contrast, PTC2/PDZ failed to bind Shc, but interacted normally with PLCgamma. Acute expression of RET/PTC3 or RET/PTC3(Y541F), but not PTC2/PDZ, inhibited TSH-induced Tg and NIS expression, suggesting that activation of Shc-Ras, but not PLCgamma, is required for RET/PTC-induced dedifferentiation. Accordingly, acute expression of H-Ras(V12) or of a constitutively active MEK1 also blocked TSH-induced expression of Tg and NIS. Moreover, MEK inhibitors restored Tg and NIS levels. In conclusion, activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK pathway through Shc mediates RET/PTC-induced thyroid cell dedifferentiation. This suggests that inhibition of this pathway may promote redifferentiation in poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas with constitutive activation of either Ras or RET/PTC.",

These studies suggested that the radiation exposure may be a direct inducer of activating rearrangements in the ret gene. In order to confirm the postulated link between irradiation and the role of the ret proto-oncogene in thyroid tumorigenesis, we analysed for the presence of ret activating rearrangements using RT-PCR, XL-PCR, Southern blot and direct sequencing techniques, 39 human thyroid tumors (19 papillary carcinomas and 20 follicular adenomas), from patients who had received external radiation for benign or malignant conditions. As controls, we studied 39 'spontaneous' tumors (20 papillary carcinomas and 19 follicular adenomas). Our data concerning the radiation-associated tumors, showed that: (1) the overall frequency of ret rearrangements was 84% in papillary carcinomas (16/19) and 45% (9/20) in follicular adenomas; (2) in contrast with the results obtained in the Chernobyl tumors, the most frequently observed chimeric gene was RET/PTC1 instead of the RET/PTC3 and (3) all the tumors were negative for RET/PTC2. In the 'spontaneous' tumors, only the papillary carcinomas presented a ret rearrangement (15%:3/20): 1 RET/PTC1, 1 RET/ PTC3 and 1 uncharacterized. In conclusion, our results confirm the crucial role played by the ret proto-oncogene activating rearrangements in the development of radiation-associated thyroid tumors appearing after therapeutic or accidental ionizing irradiation, and show, for the first time, the presence of RET/PTC genes in follicular adenomas appeared after external irradiation.",

A small percentage of such patients, however, do not undergo remission and need new therapeutic approaches. Both anaplastic and medullary thyroid carcinomas exhibit aggressive behavior and are usually resistant to current therapeutic modalities. Thyroid carcinoma represents a fascinating model and a particularly promising paradigm for targeted therapy because some of the key oncogenic events are activating mutations of genes coding for tyrosine kinases, and these occur early in cancer development. A prototype is the RET proto-oncogene, a receptor tyrosine kinase, which is a key regulator of development and a 'hotspot' for oncogenic mutations. Mutations in the RET proto-oncogene have been identified as causative for papillary carcinoma and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma, making it an attractive target for selective inhibition in these subtypes. ZD 6474 has shown promising activity in preclinical models against RET kinase, and its contemporary inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor and epidermal growth factor pathways renders it a very attractive drug for clinical trials in thyroid cancer. Activating point mutation of B-RAF can occur early in the development of papillary carcinoma. Moreover, papillary carcinomas with these mutations have more aggressive properties and are diagnosed more often at an advanced stage. Clinical evaluation of B-RAF-targeting drugs is undergoing and trials in thyroid cancer are planned.

In a papillary thyroid carcinoma, we identified a novel gene (ELKS), the 5' portion of which is fused to the RET gene by gene rearrangement due to the translocation t(10;12)(q11;p13). Subsequent cloning of the ELKS cDNA revealed that ELKS encodes a novel 948 amino acid peptide and is expressed ubiquitously in human tissues. The presence of multiple coiled-coil domains in the ELKS product suggests that the ELKS protein forms dimers. Since the tyrosine kinase of RET is activated by dimerization that occurs when its ligands bind to the receptor, fusion of RET with the 5' dimerization domains of ELKS would activate its cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase constitutively in papillary thyroid carcinomas.",

However, its prevalence has been reported variably and its relation to clinical outcome has been controversial. The characteristic nuclear features of PTC usually render the diagnosis, but problem arises with equivocal cytologic features that are present focally. Although there remains some controversy, CK19 has been reported to be a useful ancillary tool for diagnosis of PTC. To evaluate the expression rate of RET/PTC rearrangement and CK19 in PTCs in a Korean population, we studied 115 papillary thyroid carcinomas in 3 mm-core tissue microarray based immunohistochemical analysis. The prevalence of Ret protein expression was 62.6% and the CK19 immunoreactivity was 80.9%. There was no statistically significant association between the Ret positivity and CK19 immunoreactivity, although the percent agreement of the two was relatively high. The clinicopathological variables did not correlate with the expression of Ret. In conclusion, the prevalence of Ret protein expression and its clinicopathological implications in a Korean population are not much different from those reported in previous studies. However, its detection via immunohistochemistry can be a useful diagnostic tool for diagnosing papillary thyroid carcinoma in conjunction with CK19.",

Expression of RET/PTC oncogenes promotes neoplastic transformation of cultured thyroid cells and of thyroid glands in transgenic mice. Notwithstanding these oncogenic effects, we have found that the expression of two RET/PTC oncogenes (H4-RET and RFG-RET) induces apoptosis of rat thyroid PC CL 3 cells. Promotion of thyroid cell death depends on the kinase activity of RET/PTC and on the phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue (tyrosine 1062) that maps in the carboxy-terminus of the RET protein. Tyrosine 1062 is essential for RET/PTC-mediated activation of the Ras/ERK pathway. Inhibition of Ras/ERK by a dominant negative Ras or by the MEKI inhibitor, PD98059, obstructed RET/PTC-mediated apoptosis. We also show that signals transmitted by tyrosine 1062 mediate proapoptotic events like Bcl-2 down regulation and Bax upregulation, and that adoptive overexpression of Bcl-2 overcomes RET/PTC-induced apoptosis. Thus, gene rearrangements that generate RET/PTC oncogenes subvert RET function by converting it into a chronically active kinase that is constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine 1062. In turn, Y1062 phosphorylation transmits not only mitogenic but also proapoptotic signals to thyroid cells.",

Only cells with either two overlapping signals or one split and one overlapping signal were counted to ensure that only complete cell nuclei had been scored. In total, 23 of 32 cases (72%) showed RET rearrangements diagnosed by FISH interphase analysis. In all cases, the tumors were composed of a mixture of cells with and without ret rearrangement on FISH. In some cases, this distribution was clearly nonrandom because clustering of rearranged cells was detected within the same tumor nodule. Accordingly, only 31% of the cases positive for rearrangement on FISH also scored positive using RT-PCR.

Although several proteins have been identified to be substrates of RET/PTC kinases, the pathogenic roles played by RET/PTC in malignant and benign thyroid diseases and the molecular mechanisms that are involved are not fully understood. We found that RET/PTC expression phosphorylates the Y701 residue of STAT1, a type II interferon (IFN)-responsive protein. RET/PTC-mediated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) phosphorylation requires RET/PTC kinase activity to be intact but other tyrosine kinases, such as Janus kinases or c-Src, are not involved. RET/PTC-induced STAT1 transcriptional activation was not inhibited by suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 or -3, or protein inhibitors of activated STAT3 [(protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS3)], but PIAS1 strongly repressed the RET/PTC-induced transcriptional activity of STAT1. RET/PTC-induced STAT1 activation caused IFN regulatory factor-1 expression. We found that STAT1 and IFN regulatory factor-1 cooperated to significantly increase transcription from type IV IFN-gamma responsive promoters of class II transactivator genes. Significantly, cells stably expressing RET/PTC expressed class II transactivator and showed enhanced de novo membrane expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II proteins. Furthermore, RET/PTC1-bearing papillary thyroid carcinoma cells strongly expressed MHC class II (human leukocyte-associated antigen-DR alpha) genes, whereas the surrounding normal tissues did not. Thus, RET/PTC is able to phosphorylate and activate STAT1. This may lead to enhanced MHC class II expression, which may explain why the tissues surrounding RET/PTC-positive cancers are infiltrated with lymphocytes. Such immune response-promoting activity of RET/PTC may also relate to the development of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.",

She was asymptomatic when she was seen at 22 weeks of gestation because of increased urinary metanephrine levels. A 24-h blood pressure monitoring was normal. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a right-sided, 34x31x28mm, well-limited, adrenal mass with high signal intensity on T2-weighted images; the contralateral adrenal was normal. At 26 weeks of gestation and after an adequate labetalol preparation, a retroperitoneal laparoscopic right-sided adrenalectomy was performed without maternal or foetal complications. Pathohistological examination confirmed the presence of a 3cm pheochromocytoma in the right adrenal gland, with no sign of malignancy. The levels of urinary methoxylated metabolites were normal two months after surgery. The pregnancy progressed normally and the patient delivered a healthy child without complications. In conclusion, firstly, all MEN2a women should be screened for a pheochromocytoma with a 24-h urinary metanephrine and normetanephrine evaluation before or early during pregnancy, even with normal blood pressure; secondly, pheochromocytoma diagnosed during pregnancy should be operated on during pregnancy because of the risks for both mother and baby; thirdly, after medical therapy, retroperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy can be performed during the second trimester of pregnancy.",

RET was expressed in 5.4% of normal thyroid tissue, 18% of follicular adenomas, 22.7% of nodular hyperplasia cases and 71.7% of papillary carcinomas. Its expression in papillary carcinoma was not associated with the coexistence of nodular hyperplasia lesions. p53 was expressed by 17% of papillary carcinomas. No association was found between p53 expression of nodular hyperplasia with or without co-existing papillary carcinoma. p53, rather than RET, was an excellent predictor of tumour lymph node metastasis and capsular invasion. p53 was also a significant prognosticator of survival outcome.;RET expression is highly prevalent in local papillary carcinoma, indicating a significant role in the pathogenesis of this tumour, with no apparent role in tumour behaviour and survival outcome. p53 on the other hand appears to be a significant factor in the latter events. The two genes appear to act in two different pathways: the former being an initiator, and the later a propagator of papillary carcinoma.",

Multiple endocrine neoplasia IIa and IIb and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma are inherited conditions with autosomal dominance and incomplete penetrance. Traditionally, diagnosis and screening for these conditions have been done using pentagastrin stimulation tests and plasma calcitonin determinations. Recent genetic mapping, however, has assigned the genes responsible for these tumors to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 10. Available data suggest that mutations in exon 10, 11, or 16 of the RET proto-oncogene are responsible for MEN IIa and IIb and familial non-MEN medullary thyroid carcinoma. Thus, genetic testing can identify affected members of a kindred and will probably lead to early thyroidectomy and possible cure for gene carriers.;Early studies confirm the usefulness of DNA analysis in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with familial forms of medullary thyroid carcinoma.

Oncogenic activation of RET causes the cancer syndrome multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) and is a frequent event in sporadic thyroid carcinomas. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying RET's potent transforming and mitogenic signals are still not clear. Here, we show that nuclear localization of beta-catenin is frequent in both thyroid tumors and their metastases from MEN 2 patients, suggesting a novel mechanism of RET-mediated function through the beta-catenin signaling pathway. We show that RET binds to, and tyrosine phosphorylates, beta-catenin and show that the interaction between RET and beta-catenin can be direct and independent of cytoplasmic kinases, such as SRC. As a result of RET-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation, beta-catenin escapes cytosolic down-regulation by the adenomatous polyposis coli/Axin/glycogen synthase kinase-3 complex and accumulates in the nucleus, where it can stimulate beta-catenin-specific transcriptional programs in a RET-dependent fashion. We show that down-regulation of beta-catenin activity decreases RET-mediated cell proliferation, colony formation, and tumor growth in nude mice. Together, our data show that a beta-catenin-RET kinase pathway is a critical contributor to the development and metastasis of human thyroid carcinoma.",

Some have suggested thyroid lobectomy with isthmusectomy and central neck dissection for patients with sMTC, given their lower frequency of bilateral disease, although this topic has not been thoroughly studied. This study assessed the prevalence of multifocality in sMTC via a large international multi-institutional retrospective review to quantify this prevalence, including the impact of geography, to assess more accurately the risks associated with alternative surgical approaches.;A retrospective chart review of sMTC patients from 11 institutions over 29 years (1983-2011) was undertaken. Data regarding focality, extent of disease, RET germline analysis plus family and clinical history for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), and demographic data were collected and analyzed.;Patients from four continents and seven countries were included in the sample. Data for 313 patients with documented sMTC were collected. Of these, 81.2% were confirmed with negative RET germline testing, while the remaining 18.8% demonstrated a negative family history and no manifestations of MEN2 syndromes other than MTC. Bilateral disease was identified in 17/306 (5.6%) patients, while multifocal disease was noted in 50/312 (16.0%) sMTC patients. When only accounting for germline negative patients, these rates were not significantly different (5.6% and 17%, respectively). Among them, when disease was unifocal in the ipsilateral lobe and isthmus, bilateral disease was present in 6/212 (2.8%) cases. When disease was multifocal in the ipsilateral lobe or isthmus, then bilateral disease was present in 8/37 (21.6%) cases (p < 0.001). No geographic differences in focality were identified.;The 5.6% prevalence of bilateral foci in sMTC suggests that total thyroidectomy should remain the standard of care for initial surgery, as less complete thyroid surgery may fail to address fully the primary site of disease. Whether ipsilateral tumor focality should be an independent factor determining the need for completion thyroidectomy when sMTC is diagnosed after hemithyroidectomy remains to be determined.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN2B) is a highly aggressive thyroid cancer syndrome. Since almost all sporadic cases are caused by the same nucleotide substitution in the RET proto-oncogene, the calculated disease incidence is 100-200 times greater than would be expected based on the genome average mutation frequency. In order to determine whether this increased incidence is due to an elevated mutation rate at this position (true mutation hot spot) or a selective advantage conferred on mutated spermatogonial stem cells, we studied the spatial distribution of the mutation in 14 human testes. In donors aged 36-68, mutations were clustered with small regions of each testis having mutation frequencies several orders of magnitude greater than the rest of the testis. In donors aged 19-23 mutations were almost non-existent, demonstrating that clusters in middle-aged donors grew during adulthood. Computational analysis showed that germline selection is the only plausible explanation. Testes of men aged 75-80 were heterogeneous with some like middle-aged and others like younger testes. Incorporating data on age-dependent death of spermatogonial stem cells explains the results from all age groups. Germline selection also explains MEN2B's male mutation bias and paternal age effect. Our discovery focuses attention on MEN2B as a model for understanding the genetic and biochemical basis of germline selection. Since RET function in mouse spermatogonial stem cells has been extensively studied, we are able to suggest that the MEN2B mutation provides a selective advantage by altering the PI3K/AKT and SFK signaling pathways. Mutations that are preferred in the germline but reduce the fitness of offspring increase the population's mutational load. Our approach is useful for studying other disease mutations with similar characteristics and could uncover additional germline selection pathways or identify true mutation hot spots.",

Patient was diagnosed with stage III (T3, N1a, MO) medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), multicentric micropapillary thyroid carcinoma, scapular and lumbar melanomas (Clark II, Breslow II), and lobular invasive breast carcinoma (T1a, NO, MO). All tumors present in our patient except micropapillary thyroid carcinomas were investigated for gene alterations known to have a key role in cancer promotion and progression. Tumor samples were screened for the p16 alterations (loss of heterozygosity and homozygous deletions), loss of heterozygosity of PTEN, p53 alterations (mutational status and loss of heterozygosity) and mutational status of RET, HRAS and KRAS. Each type of tumor investigated had specific pattern of analyzed genetic alterations. The most prominent genetic changes were mutual alterations in PTEN and p53 tumor suppressors present in breast cancer and two melanomas. These co-alterations could be crucial for promoting development of multiple malignancies. Moreover the insertion in 4(th) codon of HRAS gene was common for all tumor types investigated. It represents frameshift mutation introducing stop codon at position 5 which prevents synthesis of a full-length protein. Since the inactivated RAS enhances sensitivity to tamoxifen and radiotherapy this genetic alteration could be considered as a good prognostic factor for this patient. ",

NIH 3T3 fibroblasts stably transfected with a mammalian expression vector encoding full-length Delta RFP/RET readily gave rise to the tumors in athymic mice suggestive of high transforming potential of the fusion protein. Thus, the Delta rfp/ret rearrangement may be involved in a causative manner in cancerogenesis and provides additional evidence of the role of activated ret oncogene in the development of a subset of papillary thyroid carcinoma.",

Review of the English literature of patients undergoing preventive thyroidectomy for a positive RETgene germline mutation, shows that 3.4% of these patients (a total of 209 patients) had normal thyroid glands. Also, 8.6% of patients undergoing preventive total thyroidectomy with prophylactic central neck node dissection had cervical node metastases. We conclude that preventive thyroidectomy in patients screened early for germline RETgene mutation allows for earlier diagnosis and treatment of patients, sometimes even before any hyperplasia or neoplasia can be demonstrated because cervical node metastases can occur early and be demonstrated even with small tumors (< 1 cm), we recommend prophylactic central neck node dissection at the time of preventive thyroidectomy.",

In humans, indirect measurements based on age dependent tumor incidence predict that, on average, the accumulation of 5 to 6 different steps is needed to initiate tumor formation. These mutations do not appear to be random, in that certain neoplasms show prediction for structural aberrations in specific genes. In thyroid tumors, some of gene abnormalities were found. The point mutations of ras oncogenes, predominantly H-ras codon 12, are found in 20-25% of follicular adenomas and papillary carcinomas. Recently, the gene rearrangements of the oncogenes trk and ret were identified in the DNA from papillary carcinomas. About 25% of papillary carcinomas contained an introchromosomal (10q) gene rearrangement involving the tyrosine kinase domain of the ret oncogene with an unknown amino-terminal sequence. The mutations of trk and/or ret were not observed in other thyroid neoplastic phenotypes. In medullary thyroid carcinoma, which is a tumor of the parafollicular, calcitonin-secreting C cell of the thyroid, approximately 20% of patients have autosomal dominant inherited forms. Germ line abnormalities on chromosome 10 are linked to at least one type of genetic medullary thyroid carcinoma (MEN type 2a).

RET/PTC oncoproteins lack extracellular or transmembrane domains, and activation takes place through constitutive dimerization mediated through coiled-coil motifs in the NH(2) terminus of the chimeric protein. Based on the observation that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitor PKI166 decreased RET/PTC kinase autophosphorylation and activation of downstream effectors in thyroid cells, despite lacking activity on the purified RET kinase, we proceeded to examine possible functional interactions between RET/PTC and EGFR. Conditional activation of RET/PTC oncoproteins in thyroid PCCL3 cells markedly induced expression and phosphorylation of EGFR, which was mediated in part through mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. RET and EGFR were found to coimmunoprecipitate. The ability of RET to form a complex with EGFR was not dependent on recruitment of Shc or on their respective kinase activities. Ligand-induced activation of EGFR resulted in phosphorylation of a kinase-dead RET, an effect that was entirely blocked by PKI166. These effects were biologically relevant, as the EGFR kinase inhibitors PKI166, gefitinib, and AEE788 inhibited cell growth induced by various constitutively active mutants of RET in thyroid cancer cells as well as NIH3T3 cells. These data indicate that EGFR contributes to RET kinase activation, signaling, and growth stimulation and may therefore be an attractive therapeutic target in RET-induced neoplasms.",

Past medical history included a total thyroidectomy for medullary carcinoma in 1985, and left adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma in 1994. Blood pressure was 130/ 85 mmHg without orthostatic hypotension and pulse rate was 72 beats/min. Laboratory data revealed thyroid hormones and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in the normal range and high basal serum calcitonin levels (158 pg/ml). Plasma catecholamines and vanillylmandelic acid resulted in normal levels but epinephrine/norepinephrine ratio was elevated (0.65). The glucagon stimulation test showed positive clinical and biochemical response. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintiscan confirmed the presence of bilateral adrenal masses. Bilateral adrenalectomy by laparoscopic anterior approach was performed. Histology was consistent with adrenal pheochromocytomas. After surgical approach, psychiatric findings disappeared and did not recur at follow-up in spite of no medication for two years. In conclusion, bilateral pheochromocytoma is more frequent in MEN2A syndrome and probably understimated if the follow-up is not prolonged. In these cases clinical features are often aspecific and basal hormonal data may be normal in a great number of patients. Therefore long-term observation is justified in these patients.

The first hint that the MEN1 gene is localized on chromosome 11 came from the finding of allele losses in MEN1 associated tumours. Subsequent genetic linkage analysis to restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers assigned the gene to chromosome band 11q13. MEN2A is characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma and phaeochromocytoma. The disease locus was localized to the centromeric region of chromosome 10 by genetic linkage. For both syndromes genetic linkage maps of the flanking regions have been established, and a set of RFLP markers is now available for premorbid identification of gene carriers in affected families. Analysis of allele losses showed that tumorigenesis of parathyroid and pancreatic lesions results from unmasking of a recessive mutation at the MEN1 locus, and by deletion mapping the tentative MEN1 region was restricted to a few million base pairs.

The rearranged during transfection (RET) proto-oncogene is the major susceptibility gene for Hirschsprung disease, and germline mutations in RET have been reported in up to 50% of the inherited forms of Hirschsprung disease and in 15-20% of sporadic cases of Hirschsprung disease.

Presently, there is strong evidence favoring the hypothesis that specific inactivating haplotypes play a key role in the fetal development of congenital megacolon/Hirschsprung disease. In the present study, we report the genetic findings in a novel family with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2: a specific RET haplotype was documented in patients with Hirschsprung disease associated with medullary thyroid carcinoma, but it was absent in patients with only medullary thyroid carcinoma.

RET/PTC (rearranged in transformation/papillary thyroid carcinomas) gene rearrangements are the most frequent genetic alterations identified in papillary thyroid carcinoma. Although the oncogenic potential of RET/PTC is related to intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, the substrates for this enzyme are yet to be identified. In this report, we show that phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), a pivotal serine/threonine kinase in growth factor-signaling pathways, is a target of RET/PTC. RET/PTC and PDK1 colocalize in the cytoplasm. RET/PTC phosphorylates a specific tyrosine (Y9) residue located in the N-terminal region of PDK1. Y9 phosphorylation of PDK1 by RET/PTC requires an intact catalytic kinase domain. The short (iso 9) and long forms (iso 51) of the RET/PTC kinases (RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3) induce Y9 phosphorylation of PDK1. Moreover, Y9 phosphorylation of PDK1 by RET/PTC does not require phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or Src activity. RET/PTC-induced phosphorylation of the Y9 residue results in increased PDK1 activity, decrease of cellular p53 levels, and repression of p53-dependent transactivation. In conclusion, RET/PTC-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PDK1 may be one of the mechanisms by which it acts as an oncogenic tyrosine kinase in thyroid carcinogenesis.",

The principle microscopic differences between these genetically determined medullary microcarcinomas and larger sporadic (>1 cm) medullary carcinomas were the low incidence of stromal desmoplasia and amyloid deposition, the high incidence of C-cell hyperplasia, and the low incidence of lymph node metastases. Only one patient, a 34-year-old man, presented with lymph node metastases. All patients remain disease free 11 to 70 months after diagnosis.

        "Doc_abstract":"The association of the rare hereditary cancer syndrome, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2a (MEN 2a) with Hirschsprung's disease, both linked to germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene, has been reported recently. With the widespread availability of genetic screening for MEN 2a, it is necessary to define the indications for genetic testing of MEN 2a and population subgroups at high risk for inheriting the disease. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of Hirschsprung's disease in MEN 2a and investigate the value of genetic analysis for MEN 2a in children with familial Hirschsprung's disease.;The ethnically diverse study group consisted of unselected consecutive patients (n=426) at risk for hereditary medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) referred to a single laboratory for genetic testing. Analysis used genomic DNA and a polymerase chain reaction-based heteroduplex mutation detection strategy for exons 10, 11, 13, and 14 of the RET proto-oncogene followed by direct DNA sequencing. Significance of RET genotype-phenotype correlation was determined by Fisher's two-tailed Exact test and a 2 x 2 contingency table.;Thirty-six distinctly new MEN 2a kindreds were identified. Hirschsprung's disease cosegregated among siblings with MEN 2a in 15 patients from 6 of the 36 (17%) families. The extent of aganglionosis in the 15 patients ranged from midrectum to duodenum. Of the 15 patients with Hirschsprung's disease, 10 (six boys, four girls) underwent thyroidectomy for MTC (n=5) or C-cell hyperplasia (n = 5) at ages 2 to 47 years (mean, 15.6 years), and the remaining five patients died in childhood of complications related to the aganglionosis. In retrospect, Hirschsprung's disease was the presenting feature of MEN 2a in five of the six families rather than MTC or pheochromocytoma. In all six MEN 2a families expressing Hirschsprung's disease, the RET mutation predisposing to the combined phenotype occurred in exon 10 at codons 609 (n=2), 618 (n=3), or 620 (n = 1). By contrast, the MEN 2a with Hirschsprung's phenotype was not found in any of the 22 families with a RETexon 11, 13, or 14 mutation (P=.0007).;The authors conclude that Hirschsprung's disease is a phenotypic marker for MEN 2a and possibly more common than originally appreciated. The expression of Hirschsprung's disease with MEN 2a may be uniquely linked to RETexon 10 mutations. The authors recommend that (1) patients affected with MEN 2a may be counseled regarding the potential risk of Hirschsprung's disease in offspring and (2) a family history of MTC be explored in children with familial Hirschsprung's disease and genetic screening for MEN 2a be considered.",

Thyroid tumours comprise a broad spectrum of lesions with different phenotypes and variable biological and clinical behaviour. Molecular analysis has detected specific genetic alterations in these different tumour types. In particular, the well-differentiated carcinomas of the papillary type are characterised by the activation of the tyrosine kinase receptors (TKRs) RET and NTRK1 proto-oncogenes. Cytogenetic analysis of these tumours has contributed to defining the chromosomal mechanisms leading to the TKRs' oncogenic activation. The results have shown that, in the majority of the cases, intra-chromosomal inversions of chromosome 10 and of chromosome 1 lead to the formation of RET-derived and NTRK1-derived oncogenes, respectively. Exposure to ionizing radiation is associated with papillary carcinomas, and RET activation has been suggested to be related to this event. All these findings are contributing to the definition of genetic and environmental factors relevant to the pathogenesis of thyroid tumours. Moreover, the molecular characterisation of specific genetic lesions could provide significant information about the association between ionising radiation and RET oncogene activation.",

Ultrasonography (US) and US-guided biopsy remain cornerstones in the initial workup of thyroid cancer. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment, with radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy reserved for differentiated subtypes. Posttreatment surveillance of thyroid cancer is done with US of the thyroid bed as well as monitoring of tumor markers such as serum thyroglobulin and serum calcitonin. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, and fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT are used in the follow-up of patients with negative iodine 131 imaging and elevated tumor markers. Certain mutations, such as mutations of BRAF in papillary thyroid carcinoma and mutations in RET codons 883, 918, and 928, are associated with an aggressive course in medullary thyroid carcinoma, and affected patients need close surveillance. Treatment options for metastatic RAI-refractory thyroid cancer are limited. Currently, Food and Drug Administration-approved molecularly targeted therapies for metastatic RAI-refractory thyroid cancer, including sorafenib, lenvatinib, vandetanib, and cabozantinib, target the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and RET kinases. Imaging plays an important role in assessment of response to these therapies, which can be atypical owing to antiangiogenic effects. A wide spectrum of toxic effects is associated with the molecularly targeted therapies used in thyroid cancer and can be detected at restaging scans. (©)RSNA, 2016. ",

Activation of protein kinase B (PKB) and its downstream signaling pathways appears to be an important event in thyroid tumorigenesis. In this study, we found that the thyroid-specific oncogenic RET/PTC tyrosine kinase is able to phosphorylate PKB in vitro and in vivo. RET/PTC-transfected cells showed tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous and exogenous PKB, which was independent of phosphorylation of T308 and S473 regulated by the upstream kinases phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 and -2, respectively. The PKB Y315 residue, which is known to be phosphorylated by Src tyrosine kinase, was also a major site of phosphorylation by RET/PTC. RET/PTC-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation results in the activation of PKB kinase activity. The activation of PKB by RET/PTC blocked the activity of the forkhead transcription factor, FKHRL1, but a Y315F mutant of PKB failed to inhibit FKHRL1 activity. In summary, these observations suggest that RET/PTC is able to phosphorylate the Y315 residue of PKB, an event that results in maximal activation of PKB for RET/PTC-induced thyroid tumorigenesis.",

In the case of MEN 1, loss-of-function germline mutations in the tumour suppressor gene MEN1 increase the risk of developing pituitary, parathyroid and pancreatic islet tumours, and less commonly thymic carcinoids, lipomas and benign adrenocortical tumours. In the case of MEN 2, gain-of-function germline mutations clustered in specific codons of the RET proto-oncogene increase the risk of developing medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), phaeochromocytoma and parathyroid tumours. Offering RET testing is best practice for the clinical management of patients at-risk of MEN 2, and MEN 2 has become a classic model for the integration of molecular medicine into patient care. Prophylactic thyroidectomy in an asymptomatic RET mutation carrier to address the risk of developing MTC can prevent or cure this malignancy. No similar preventative strategies can be employed to prevent or cure MEN 1-associated tumours. Genetic testing for MEN 1 is therefore both more complex due to a general lack of mutational hotspots, and the benefit to patients is less straight forward. While a number of genotype-phenotype correlations exist in MEN 2, providing further rationale for performing genetic testing in this condition, these correlations are absent in MEN 1.

The first RET rearrangement, named RET/PTC, was discovered in 1987. This rearrangement constitutively activates the transcription of the RET tyrosine-kinase domain in follicular cell, thus triggering the signaling along the MAPK pathway and an uncontrolled proliferation. Up to now, 13 different types of RET/PTC rearrangements have been reported but the two most common are RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3. Ionizing radiations are responsible for the generation of RET/PTC rearrangements, as supported by in vitro studies and by the evidence that RET/PTC, and particularly RET/PTC3, are highly prevalent in radiation induced PTC. However, many thyroid tumors without any history of radiation exposure harbor similar RET rearrangements. The overall prevalence of RET/PTC rearrangements varies from 20 to 70% of PTCs and they are more frequent in childhood than in adulthood thyroid cancer. Controversial data have been reported on the relationship between RET/PTC rearrangements and the PTC prognosis. RET/PTC3 is usually associated with a more aggressive phenotype and in particular with a greater tumor size, the solid variant, and a more advanced stage at diagnosis which are all poor prognostic factors. In contrast, RET/PTC1 rearrangement does not correlate with any clinical-pathological characteristics of PTC. Moreover, the RET protein and mRNA expression level did not show any correlation with the outcome of patients with PTC and no correlation between RET/PTC rearrangements and the expression level of the thyroid differentiation genes was observed. Recently, a diagnostic role of RET/PTC rearrangements has been proposed. It can be searched for in the mRNA extracted from cytological sample especially in case with indeterminate cytology. However, both the fact that it can be present in a not negligible percentage of benign cases and the technical challenge in extracting mRNA from cytological material makes this procedure not applicable at routine level, at least for the moment.",

Case 1: A 30-year-old man without a history of hypertension or any other chronic medical problems was admitted to the Emergency Department because of a hypertensive crisis that was followed by cardiac arrest. A later diagnosis revealed bilateral pheochromocytoma and RET proto-oncogene mutation in codon 634. The patient underwent bilateral adrenalectomy and total thyroidectomy; the latter confirmed the presence of medullary carcinoma. Case 2: The patient underwent right adrenalectomy with the removal of a pheochromocytoma at the age of sixteen. Ten years later, a suspicion of pheochromocytoma in the remaining left adrenal was raised. Mutation in the RET proto-oncogene was confirmed as well. The patient first underwent left adrenalectomy and then she had total thyroidectomy. Postoperative histopathological examinations revealed pheochromocytoma and medullary carcinoma. Case 3: Radiological and biochemical examination confirmed pheochromocytoma. Therefore, the two adrenals were removed. As mutation in codon 634 was detected, the patient underwent total thyroidectomy as well. The presence of medullary carcinoma was confirmed.;Pheochromocytoma is a rare and potentially lethal disease if a catecholamine crisis develops.

Because of its unprecedented scale and its emotional implications, this finding has raised concern and called the attention of the scientific community to this major health problem. Although epidemiologically documented, a direct correlation between thyroid cancer and radiation exposure has not been definitely proven at the molecular level. On the assumption that ionizing radiation could cause specific and common cancer-associated genetic lesions, an analysis of oncogene activation and/or tumor suppressor gene inactivation would help to define radiation-induced thyroid carcinomas. Therefore, we have analyzed by different molecular approaches, including Southern blotting, DNA transfection assay on NIH-3T3 cells, and reverse transcription-PCR analysis, six papillary carcinomas from children living in the region of Belarus at the time of the Chernobyl nuclear accident to identify tumor-specific gene rearrangements of the proto-oncogenes RET and TRK, previously found activated in a tumor type-specific manner in papillary thyroid carcinoma. Using Southern blot analysis in four cases, we could detect specific rearranged bands indicating an oncogenic activation of RET that in three cases resulted in rearranged sequences provided by the same activating gene. Moreover, the DNA of the last three cases showed a biological activity in transforming NIH-3T3 cells after the DNA-mediated transfection assay, and the respective NIH-3T3 transfectants were found to express the oncogenic fusion transcripts. These results support the possibility that RET oncogenic activation could represent a major genetic lesion associated with thyroid carcinoma in children exposed to the Chernobyl nuclear accident.",

We found that RET/PTC was able to induce the expression of CXCR4, the receptor for the chemokine CXCL12/SDF-1alpha/beta. We observed that CXCR4 expression correlated with the transforming ability of the oncoprotein and depended on the integrity of the RET/PTC-RAS/ERK signaling pathway. We found that CXCR4 was expressed in RET/PTC-positive human thyroid cancer cell lines, but not in normal thyroid cells. Furthermore, we found CXCR4 expression in human thyroid carcinomas, but not in normal thyroid samples by immunohistochemistry. Since CXCR4 has been recently implicated in tumor proliferation, motility and invasiveness, we asked whether treatment with SDF-1alpha was able to induce a biological response in thyroid cells. We observed that SDF-1alpha induced S-phase entry and survival of thyroid cells. Invasion through a reconstituted extracellular matrix was also supported by SDF-1alpha and inhibited by a blocking antibody to CXCR4. Taken together, these results suggest that human thyroid cancers bearing RET/PTC rearrangements may use the CXCR4/SDF-1alpha receptor-ligand pathway to proliferate, survive and migrate.",

Two patients had basal and stimulated plasma calcitonin levels above the normal range. Stimulated plasma calcitonin levels had increased but remained within the normal range in four patients. The data suggest that there was a lower incidence of persistent or recurrent disease in children who underwent total thyroidectomy before eight years of age and in children in whom there were no metastases to cervical lymph nodes.;In this study, young patients identified by direct DNA analysis as carriers of a RET mutation characteristic of MEN-2A had no evidence of persistent or recurrent medullary thyroid carcinoma five or more years after total thyroidectomy.

We report a new RET point mutation [R694Q (CGG-->CAG)], serendipitously found in a 23-yr-old woman with hypothyroidism due to atrophic Hashimoto's thyroiditis and primary ovarian failure, without altered calcitonin secretion. Familial history and clinical and biochemical evaluation of first-degree relatives were negative for FMTC, MEN 2A and 2B, and Hirschsprung disease. Genetic analysis showed that the mutation was inherited from the mother, who was submitted 2 yr before to thyroidectomy for goitrous Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Histological revision and immunohistochemical studies documented normal C cell number and morphology. We cloned the mutation in an expression vector encoding a full-length RET protein. The construct was transiently expressed in 293T cells in parallel with a wild-type RET and a C634R MEN 2A-associated RET mutant. Proteins were harvested from transfected cells, and tyrosine phosphorylation levels were assayed. The mutation did not exert significant potentiating effects on RET kinase. A focus assay was also performed on NIH3T3 fibroblasts; the mutant did not exert significant transforming activity. In conclusion, a new RET mutation was found in two subjects without any evidence of MEN and FMTC. In keeping with clinical data, transfection studies confirmed lack of activating activity. This serendipitous discovery, apparently devoid of oncogenic potential, underscores the problems that may be encountered in genomic studies on RET.",

The evaluation and management of MEN2-related tumours is often different from that of sporadic counterparts. This review article provides an overview of clinical manifestations, diagnosis and surgical management of MEN2 patients. This review also presents applications of the most up-to-date imaging modalities to MEN2 patients that are tightly linked to the clinical management and aims to guide physicians towards a rationale for the use of imaging prior to prophylactic thyroidectomy, initial surgery and reoperations for persistent/recurrent disease. This review also concludes that, in the near future, it is expected that these patients will indeed benefit from newly developed positron emission tomography approaches which will target peptide receptors and protein kinases. Identification of MEN2-specific radiopharmaceuticals will also soon arise from molecular profiling studies. Furthermore, subtotal (cortical-sparing) adrenalectomy, which is a valid option in MEN2 for avoiding long-term steroid replacement, will benefit from an accurate estimation through imaging of differential adrenocortical function.

This thyroid-specific rearrangement causes aberrant expression of RET/PTC and results in constitutive ligand-independent activation of RET kinase. However, it is unclear how RET/PTC activates the specific signaling pathways for cellular transformation. In this study, we show that RET/PTC associates with signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and activates it by the specific phosphorylation of the tyrosine 705 residue. Activation of STAT3 requires the intrinsic kinase activity of RET/PTC; Janus tyrosine kinase and c-Src kinase are not involved in the RET/PTC-mediated activation of STAT3. RET/PTC-induced activation of STAT3 induces the STAT3-responsive genes, vascular endothelial growth factor, cyclin D1, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1. In addition, RET/PTC-mediated cellular transformation and proliferation of transformed cells require tyrosine 705 phosphorylation of STAT3 in NIH3T3 cells. We conclude that STAT3 activation by the RET/PTC tyrosine kinase is one of the critical signaling pathways for the regulation of specific genes, such as cyclin D1, vascular endothelial growth factor, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and for cellular transformation.",

Molecular DNA screening of samples was performed by non-radioactive single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and heteroduplex gel electrophoresis method followed by mutation analysis of PCR products by direct cycle sequencing using an automated DNA sequencer. We identified 12 MEN 2A/FMSC and 6 MEN 2B families with 29 gene carriers. Ten different types of mutations were identified in the MEN 2A/FMTC families (620 Cys-->Arg, 618 Cys-->Ser, Gly, 611 Cys-->Tyr; 634 Cys-->Arg, Tyr, Trp, Phe, Ser, Gly) and all 6 MEN 2B families had a 918 Met-->Thr point mutation. Our results indicate that PCR-based DNA testing for RET point mutations is a rapid, accurate and reproducible method of identifying MEN 2 gene carriers using blood or tissue DNA. Early detection of gene carriers allows preventive thyroidectomy without neck dissection or parathyroid transplantation, and non-gene carriers can be released from biochemical testing. Furthermore, it is shown that the distribution and localization of RET mutations in MEN 2 families from Switzerland concur with combined results of larger series and that a \"founder effect\" of MEN 2 can be excluded for this country.",

Familial syndromes of hyperparathyroidism are also associated with a range of endocrine and nonendocrine tumors, including potential malignancies. Complications of the associated neoplasms are the major causes of morbidities and mortalities in these familial syndromes, e.g., parathyroid carcinoma in HPT-JT syndrome; thymic, bronchial, and enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in MEN1; and medullary thyroid cancer and pheochromocytoma in MEN2A. Because of the different underlying mechanisms of neoplasia, these familial tumors may have different characteristics compared with their sporadic counterparts. Large-scale clinical trials are frequently lacking due to the rarity of these diseases. With technological advances and the development of new medications, the natural history, diagnosis, and management of these syndromes are also evolving. In this article, we summarize the recent knowledge on endocrine neoplasms in three familial hyperparathyroidism syndromes, with an emphasis on disease characteristics, molecular pathogenesis, recent developments in biochemical and radiological evaluation, and expert opinions on surgical and medical therapies. Because these familial hyperparathyroidism syndromes are associated with a wide variety of tumors in different organs, this review is focused on those endocrine neoplasms with malignant potential. ",

MEN-2A, MEN-2B, and familial medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) comprise the MEN-2 syndrome. A germline mutation in the RET proto-oncogene is responsible for the MEN-2 syndrome. Recent data indicate that in 99% of MEN-2 cases, a germline RET mutation can be identified by genetic testing. The phenotypic variation of MEN-2 is diverse and partly related to the codon and specific point mutation in the RET proto-oncogene. There are increasing data on the genotype-phenotype correlations in patients with MEN-2 and this information should be used for screening at-risk patients and treatment of RET mutation carriers. All patients (especially if young) with MTC or bilateral pheochromocytoma should have a careful family history taken and genetic screening for RET germline mutations. Patients who are RET germline mutation carriers but without clinical or biochemical evidence of MTC should have a prophylactic total thyroidectomy. The optimal age of thyroidectomy should be based on the RET genotype (eg, high-risk mutations within the first year of life, intermediate-risk mutations by 5 years of age, and low-risk mutations by 10 years of age). Patients who are diagnosed with clinical or biochemical evidence of MTC should have a total or a near total thyroidectomy and at least a central neck lymph node dissection. Patients who have pheochromocytoma and a unilateral adrenal tumor on a localizing study should have a unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy after preoperative alpha-blockade. However, patients with bilateral adrenal tumors on localizing studies should have bilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy. A cortical-sparing (subtotal) adrenalectomy may be considered, if technically feasible, to avoid long-term steroid dependence and to reduce the risk of Addisonian crisis. Patients with biochemical evidence of primary hyperparathyroidism should have a bilateral neck exploration and total parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation (30-60 mg of the most normal parathyroid tissue) to the nondominant forearm if asymmetric parathyroid hyperplasia is present. Rarely, patients may have only single-gland disease and excision may be performed if the other parathyroid glands are not found with biopsy to be hyperplastic. All unresected parathyroid glands should be marked with a clip because patients with MEN-2A have a high risk of persistent and recurrent primary hyperparathyroidism. Patients with familial MTC may have not manifested the other features of MEN-2A, thus these patients should have continued follow-up for pheochromocytoma and primary hyperparathyroidism.",

Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the rearrangement of the RET locus during lung carcinogenesis are unknown.;Genomic segments containing breakpoint junctions for RET fusions were cloned and analyzed by genomic polymerase chain reaction and genome capture sequencing using a next-generation sequencer to identify the mechanisms involved in DNA strand breaks and illegitimate joining of DNA ends. Of the 18 cases studied, 16 were identified by screening 671 LADC cases and two were previously published.;Almost all (17 of 18, 94%) of the breakpoints in RET were located within a 2.0-kb region spanning exon 11 to intron 11 and no breakpoint occurred within 4 bp of any other. This suggested that as in papillary thyroid carcinoma, DNA strand breaks formed at nonspecific sites within this region trigger RET fusion. Just over half of the RET fusions in LADC (10 of 18, 56%) were caused by simple reciprocal inversion, and two DNA-repair mechanisms, namely nonhomologous end joining and break-induced replication, were deduced to have contributed to the illegitimate joining of the DNA ends.;Oncogenic RET fusion in LADC occurs through multiple pathways and involves the illegitimate repair of DNA strand breaks through mechanisms different from those identified in papillary thyroid carcinoma, where RET fusion also functions as a driver mutation.",

To test how the HSCR phenotype may be affected by the presence of genetic variants, we investigated the role of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), 2508C-->T (S836S), in exon 14 of the RET gene, characterized by low frequency among patients with HSCR and overrepresentation in individuals affected by sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma. Typing of several different markers across the RET gene demonstrated that a whole conserved haplotype displayed anomalous distribution and nonrandom segregation in families with HSCR.

Three main rearranged forms of RET have been described: RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3, which arise from a paracentric inversion and RET/PTC2, which originates from a 10 : 17 translocation. We previously developed a dual-color FISH test to detect these RET rearrangements in interphase nuclei of thyroid lesions. This approach allowed us to detect a novel translocation involving the RET region, which was not detectable by RT - PCR with specific primers for known rearrangements. A combination of RT - PCR and RACE analyses finally led to the identification of the fusion gene, which involves the 5' portion of PCM-1, a gene coding for a centrosomal protein with distinct cell cycle distribution, and the RET tyrosine kinase (TK) domain. FISH analysis confirmed the chromosomal localization of PCM-1 on chromosome 8p21-22, a region commonly deleted in several tumors. Immunohistochemistry, using an antibody specific for the C-terminal portion of PCM-1 showed that the protein level is drastically decreased and its subcellular localization is altered in thyroid tumor tissue with respect to normal thyroid. However, heterozygosity is retained for seven microsatellite markers in the 8p21-22 region, suggesting that the non-rearranged PCM-1 allele is not lost and that the translocation is balanced.

Analysis of a total of 18 mutant genes revealed that codon 634 mutations have the highest transforming activity. The activity of ret with a codon 609, 611, 618, or 620 mutation and with a codon 630 mutation was approximately 3- to 5-fold and 2-fold lower than that of ret with a codon 634 mutation, respectively.

The expression of the cell surface form of Ret with codon 609, 611, 618, or 620 mutation was very low compared with that of Ret with codon 634 mutation, indicating that the former four mutations might impair transport of Ret to the plasma membrane, as observed for several Hirschsprung mutations affecting the Ret extracellular domain.

Cytologic evaluation facilitates the diagnosis of thyroid lesions (TLs), but in 10-40% of cases the interpretation is indeterminate. Patients with indeterminate diagnoses are often treated with hemithyroidectomy followed by completion thyroidectomy, if cancer is found in the initial specimen. Exposing patients to multiple surgeries increases costs and morbidity. The American Thyroid Association states that a combination of molecular markers is likely to optimize the management of patients with indeterminate cytology. However, few studies have addressed the molecular alterations present in pediatric TL. Twenty-seven thyroid carcinomas from patients 10 to 19 years of age were tested for alterations common in adult TL, including BRAF V600E mutation, RET fusions, and TERT promoter mutations. Mutation-negative cases were subsequently analyzed with a next-generation sequencing (NGS) mutation panel to search for additional targets. Histologic diagnoses included 12 classic papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs), 13 follicular variant PTCs, 1 medullary thyroid carcinoma, and 1 follicular carcinoma. Fourteen cases showed lymph node involvement, and 13 cases demonstrated lymphovascular invasion. The BRAF V600E mutation was detected in 10/27 cases, and RET fusions were detected in 6/27 cases. No TERT promoter mutations were identified in any of the cases. The NGS panel revealed additional RET and CTNNB1 pathogenic missense mutations. Our results demonstrate that molecular abnormalities are common in pediatric TLs and suggest that incorporation of molecular testing will be helpful in optimizing patient management. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"The ret oncogene frequently has been found activated in papillary thyroid carcinomas. A previous characterization of ret activation revealed recombination of its tyrosine kinase domain and sequences derived from an uncharacterized locus (D10S170). The mechanism leading to this recombination was identified as a paracentric inversion of the long arm of chromosome 10, inv(10)(q11.2q21), with the breakpoints occurring where ret and D10S170 were mapped. To further characterize the activation of ret in papillary thyroid carcinomas, we have now isolated and sequenced a second type of ret oncogenic rearrangement not involving the D10S170 locus. The nucleotide sequence indicated that the transforming activity was created by the fusion of the ret tyrosine kinase domain with part of the RI alpha regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA). This is the first example of an oncogenic activity involving a PKA gene. PKA is the main intracellular cyclic AMP receptor, and its RI alpha subunit gene is located on chromosome 17q. RI alpha-ret transcripts encode two isoforms of the chimeric protein (p76 and p81), which display constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation as well as a tyrosine kinase enzymatic activity. Under nonreducing conditions, both isoforms are found in a dimeric configuration because of both homo- and heterodimer formation. Thus, the in vivo activation of ret in human papillary thyroid carcinomas is provided by the fusion of its tyrosine kinase domain with different genes and can be mediated by different mechanisms of gene rearrangement.",

One of the most frequent variants of these recombination events is the fusion of the intracellular kinase-encoding domain of RET to the first 101 amino acids of a gene named H4(D10S170). We have characterized the H4(D10S170) gene product, showing that it is a ubiquitously expressed 55 KDa nuclear and cytosolic protein that is phosphorylated following serum stimulation. This phosphorylation was found to depend on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) Erk1/2 activity and to be associated to the relocation of H4(D10S170) from the nucleus to the cytosol. Overexpression of the H4(D10S170) gene was able to induce apoptosis of thyroid follicular epithelial cells; conversely a carboxy-terminal truncated H4(D10S170) mutant H4(1-101), corresponding to the portion included in the RET/PTC1 oncoprotein, behaved as dominant negative on the proapoptotic function and nuclear localization of H4(D10S170). Furthermore, conditional expression of the H4(D10S170)-dominant negative truncated mutant protected cells from stress-induced apoptosis. The substitution of serine 244 with alanine abrogated the apoptotic function of H4(D10S170). These data suggest that loss of the H4(D10S170) gene function might have a role in thyroid carcinogenesis by impairing apoptosis.",

Although it is well accepted that the constitutive active tyrosine kinase of Ret oncogenes ultimately leads to malignant transformation, it is not clear whether a decrease in the autophosphorylation of oncogenic Ret forms can affect the mitogenic and transforming activities of Ret. Potential modulators of the tyrosine kinase activity of Ret could be tyrosine phosphatases that are expressed in human thyroid tissue. Therefore, we investigated the impact of the tyrosine phosphatases SHP1 and SHP2 on the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and oncogenic potency of Ret with a 9-bp duplication in the cysteine-rich domain (codons 634-636), which was described in a patient with MEN type 2A recently. SHP1 and SHP2 were stably overexpressed in NIH3T3 fibroblasts together with Ret-9bp. Coexpression of SHP1 with Ret-9bp reduced the autophosphorylation of Ret-9bp by 19 +/- 7% (P = 0.01, n = 4), whereas no effect was seen with SHP2. Furthermore, Ret-9bp could be coimmunoprecipitated with SHP1 but not with SHP2 antibodies. Suppression of the Ret-9bp tyrosine kinase activity by SHP1 caused a decrease in activation of Erk2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and abolished PKB/Akt (protein kinase B) phosphorylation. In addition, diminished Ret-9bp autophosphorylation led to reduced phosphorylation of the transcription factor jun-D. Finally, the inhibitory effect on Ret-9bp signaling resulted in a 40-60% reduction of [(3)H]thymidine incorporation and in reduced ability of NIH3T3 cells to form colonies in soft agar. In conclusion, the data suggest that SHP1 caused a moderate reduction of Ret autophosphorylation, which led to a strong suppression of the Ret oncogene activity.",

It has been claimed that RAS, p53 or GSP mutations and RET or TRK rearrangements might play a role in adult thyroid tumors. In childhood, the thyroid gland is particularly sensitive to ionizing radiation. The reactor accident in Chernobyl provided a unique chance to study molecular genetic aberrations in a cohort of children who developed papillary thyroid carcinomas after a short latency time after exposure to high doses of radioactive iodine isotopes. According to the concepts of molecular genetic epidemiology, exposure to a specific type of irradiation might result in a typical molecular lesion. Childhood papillary thyroid tumors after Chernobyl exhibit a high prevalence of RET rearrangement as almost the only molecular alteration. The majority showed RET/PTC3 (i.e., ELE/RET rearrangements), including several subtypes. Less frequently, RET/PTC1 (i.e., H4/RET rearrangements), and a novel type (RET/PTC5, i.e., RFG5/RET) were observed. Proof of reciprocal transcripts suggests that a balanced intrachromosomal inversion leads to this rearrangement. Breakpoint analyses revealed short homologous nucleotide stretches at the fusion points. In all types of rearrangement, the RET tyrosine kinase domain becomes controlled by 5' fused regulatory sequences of ubiquitously expressed genes that display coiled-coil regions with dimerization potential. Oncogenic activation of RET is apparently due to ligand-independent constitutive ectopic RET tyrosine kinase activity. The analysis of this cohort of children with radiation-induced thyroid tumors after Chernobyl provides insights into typical molecular aberrations in relation to a specific mode of environmental exposure and may serve as a paradigm for molecular genetic epidemiology.",

The diagnosis of this morbid condition can be made if at least four members of the same family are affected by calcitonin-secreting C-cell carcinoma.;We report the analysis of a family in which FMTC was diagnosed between 1993 and 1998. Of the five patients we confirmed as being affected by FMTC, we were able to perform a prophylactic thyroidectomy in only one case. The high possibility of lymph-node metastasis at the time of clinical diagnosis (52-75%), and the high morbidity and radio-chemo-resistance to adjuvant therapies, indicate total thyroidectomy with central lymph-node dissection.;It appears that preventive lymphadenectomy does not substantially improve survival, while pre-clinical diagnosis is of greater importance than surgery in improving survival and preventing recurrence. Total preventive thyroidectomy has been recommended in all carriers of ret genetic defects, even in families at risk with mutations of the 618 or 620 codon, because the penetrance of FMTC approaches 100%, and a 100% accordance between presence of the disease and gene carrier status is reported. This procedure would therefore represent the only possibility of achieving a 100% cure in subjects affected by familial medullary thyroid carcinoma.",

The prognosis of MEN-2 is linked to the carcinological evolution of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), which depends mainly on the stage of discovery, and to the incidents related to pheochromocytomas. The emphasizes the need for early diagnosis and management of MEN-2. Since 1993, mutations evidenced on the protooncogene RET have allowed subjects at risk to be identified, thus leading to a three-step management of these patients. (1) For all the potentially affected members of a MEN-2 family, screening by molecular genetics of the ret gene enables one to identify the subjects at risk who bear the mutation. When no mutation is observed, a linkage analysis study may be proposed. (2) In the subjects at risk, early screening for the various types of endocrine lesions may then start in childhood and be performed using specific biological markers of MTC, pheochromocytoma and primary hyperparathyroidism, and particularly, basal and pentagastrin-stimulated calcitonin measurement, which is known to be the most sensitive marker for the monitoring of MTC. (3) This step of biological investigations enables the earliest possible treatment of any endocrine lesion detected before it is expressed clinically, thus improving the prognosis of MEN-2. When genetic screening cannot be performed, only annual clinical and biological monitoring remain available in all members of a family affected with MEN-2.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) in the signal transduction leading to Erk activation in PTC cells. In normal thyroid cells, CaMKII and Erk were in the inactive form in the absence of stimulation. In primary PTC cultures and in PTC cell lines harboring the oncogenes RET/PTC-1 or BRaf(V600E), CaMKII was active also in the absence of any stimulation. Inhibition of calmodulin or phospholipase C (PLC) attenuated the level of CaMKII activation. Expression of recombinant RET/PTC-3, BRaf(V600E), or Ras(V12) induced CaMKII activation. Inhibition of CaMKII attenuated Erk activation and DNA synthesis in thyroid papillary carcinoma (TPC-1), a cell line harboring RET/PTC-1, suggesting that CaMKII is a component of the Erk signal cascade in this cell line. In conclusion, PTCs contain an active PLC/Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent signal inducing constitutive activation of CaMKII. This kinase is activated by BRaf(V600E), oncogenic Ras, and by RET/PTC. CaMKII participates to the activation of the Erk pathway by oncogenic Ras and RET/PTC and contributes to their signal output, thus modulating tumor cell proliferation.",

We hypothesized that RET could directly phosphorylate FAK and ERK.;RET and ERK kinase activity were measured with the use of an in vitro kinase assay. The relative contribution of RET in phosphorylation of ERK was tested by treating cells with PD98059, an inhibitor of MEK, and the RET inhibitor PP2, then measuring ERK activity.;Immunoprecipitated, mutant RET from cells or the recombinant RET kinase domain was able to directly phosphorylate tyrosine residues on FAK. Specifically Y576/577, Y861, and Y925, but not the autophosphorylation site Y397 of FAK, were phosphorylated by RET. Similarly ERK 2 could be phosphorylated at Y187 (Y204 in ERK1). Inhibition of both MEK (upstream of ERK) and RET was more potent than inhibition of either alone in decreasing ERK activity. Furthermore, tyrosine residues in DOK1, the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase, JNK 1 and 2, P-38, and phospholipase-gamma were directly phosphorylated by RET.;RET directly phosphorylates tyrosine residues on FAK, ERK 1/2, DOK1, the p85 subunit of of phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase, JNK 1 and 2, P-38, and phospholipase-gamma.

In this study we examined thyroid aspirates for the presence of ret/PTC gene rearrangements by RT-PCR and Southern hybridization. We prospectively collected thyroid aspirates in Cytolyt solution and prepared slides for cytological examination using the ThinPrep method. All remaining material was then used for nucleic acid extraction with subsequent RT-PCR for the housekeeping gene PGK-1 to ensure ribonucleic acid integrity, for thyroglobulin to ensure the presence of follicular epithelial cells, and for the three most common ret/PTC gene rearrangements (ret/PTC-1, -2, and -3). The results of the first 73 cases with surgical follow-up were correlated with the cytological diagnosis and final histopathology. ret/PTC gene rearrangements were detected in 17 of 33 samples (52%) that were PC on histopathology; the presence of gene rearrangements was confirmed by molecular analysis of corresponding surgically resected frozen tissue. There were no false positives. The identification of ret/PTC gene rearrangements refined the diagnosis of PC in 9 of 15 specimens (60%) that would otherwise have been considered indeterminate and in 2 of 6 that were considered insufficient for cytological diagnosis.

The diagnosis of these tumors can usually be made at the histologic level, with immunohistochemical stains necessary in some circumstances. Specific molecular mutations have been described that can be diagnostically useful or explain, in part, their pathogenesis, including the well-known Ret/PTC and PPARgamma-PAX8 translocations, point mutations in the Ret, Ras and BRAF genes, and loss of heterozygosity of multiple different tumor suppressor genes. Some unusual tumors of the thyroid gland are more difficult to diagnose. In examining these lesions, the pathologist may use the hematoxylin and eosin-stained morphology, coupled with an analysis of the immunohistochemical staining profiles and possibly analysis of the underlying molecular mutational patterns. These less common thyroid tumors include tall cell and cribriform-morular variants of papillary carcinoma, hyalinizing trabecular tumor, mucoepidermoid and sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinoma with eosinophilia, poorly differentiated (insular) carcinoma, and undifferentiated (anaplastic) carcinoma. The diagnostic features of these rare tumors, including the histology, immunohistochemical expression profiles and the known molecular mutational profiles of each, are reviewed.",

Three chromosomal rearrangements have been described, of which PTC1 is the commonest. Wide differences (2.5-25%) in frequency of PTC1 in different populations have been reported; it is not clear whether these are due to environmental factors, racial differences or technical reasons. We have developed a simple and rapid reverse transcriptase nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR) method enabling the detection of gene expression from single 5 microns sections of formalin-fixed paraffin wax-embedded archival material. We have applied this approach to detect expression of the RET tyrosine kinase domain, allowing identification of RET activation resulting from any rearrangement, whether characterised or not, or from overexpression. A retrospective study was performed on 22 adult and 21 childhood papillary carcinomas. Thirteen of 22 (59%) adult and 10 of 21 (48%) childhood carcinomas showed evidence of RET activation, demonstrating a major role for the RET oncogene in UK thyroid papillary carcinogenesis. This study also shows a similar frequency of RET activation in both children and adults. The use of a technique that allows reliable amplification of RNA from archival material, using primers chosen in different exons so that amplified products are readily distinguished from genomic DNA, will allow correlation of translocations and chromosomal rearrangements with a variety of specific tumour types.",

We used gene expression microarray analysis to identify target genes modulated by RET. We compared two oncogenic RET mutants, associated with MEN 2A (2ARET) or MEN 2B (2BRET) disease subtypes, that are predicted to have distinct downstream target genes. We showed that overall, 2ARET and 2BRET modulated genes with similar functional ontologies. Further, when we validated our microarray data by quantitative real time PCR, we did not detect major differences in gene expression associated with these mutants when differences in receptor activity levels were considered. We did, however, detect differences in gene expression induced by two RET COOH-terminal isoforms, RET9 and RET51, irrespective of the RET form present (wildtype, 2ARET, or 2BRET).

A comparison of RET variant frequencies between patients with and without PHEO was performed. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analysis were used to estimate the effect of RET variants on the age-dependent penetrance.;A total of 48 (31.4%) patients presented with MEN2-associated PHEOs.

We also studied mutations involving the ras, Braf, ret or pax8 genes. Results of Q-PCR were closely correlated with those of ICC (P < 0.0001; R = 0.59) and showed that overall tpo expression was lower in all carcinomas than in normal and BT (P < 0.05).

Genetic mutations were observed in 90% of PCc, 61.9% of FC, 41.7% of PCfv, 0% of OC and 10% in BT. pax8-ppar gamma1 rearrangement was correlated with qualitative changes in tpo mRNA (P < 0.01). These results confirmed the decrease of TPO expression in 97% of thyroid carcinomas regardless of histological type and the overexpression of shorter splice variants in follicular tumors.

Its role in the treatment of patients with thyroid carcinoma has yet to be evaluated in clinical trials. Two patients with progressive metastatic thyroid carcinoma (case 1: PTC, and case 2: FTC) were enroled in a phase I clinical trial to evaluate positron emission tomography (PET) in the monitoring of response to sunitinib. Tumour biopsies and PET were performed at baseline and 4 weeks after the commencement of sunitinib. Activation of the RET kinase pathway was evaluated using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot analysis of total phosphorylated tyrosine and downstream signalling targets of the RET pathway. Both patients demonstrated sustained clinical responses to sunitinib over a duration of 4 years. In case 1, (PTC) PET confirmed evidence of a partial metabolic response, and IHC and western blot analysis demonstrated inhibition of the RET kinase pathway posttreatment. In case 2, (FTC) PET confirmed stable disease after sunitinib. IHC staining of the tumour showed low total phosphorylated tyrosine staining at baseline which did not change after treatment. These case studies highlight potential activity of sunitinib in patients with metastatic thyroid carcinoma.

Avoidance of reoperations and optimal conditions for effective postoperative radioiodine therapy are arguments for this aggressive strategy. In patients with medullary carcinoma or with detected ret-proto-oncogene mutations, thyroidectomy with cervicocentral lymphadenectomy should be the initial operation. The cervicolateral and mediastinal compartments should be dissected when clinically obvious lymph node metastases are present in patients with differentiated carcinomas. In patients with medullary carcinomas, persistently increased calcitonin levels after the initial operation are sufficient indication for this procedure.

Following our demonstration that the PLA(2) group IV isoform alpha (PLA(2)IV alpha) controls TSH-independent growth of normal thyroid (PCCl(3)) cells, we have investigated the mitogenic role of PLA(2)IV alpha in rat thyroid cells transformed by the RET/PTC oncogenes (PC-PTC cells). We now report that PLA(2)IV alpha acts downstream of the RET/PTC oncogenes in a novel pathway controlling RET-dependent cell proliferation. In addition, we show that PLA(2)IV alpha is in its phosphorylated/active form not only in RET/PTC-transformed cells and in cells derived from human papillary carcinomas but also in lysates from tumor tissues, thus relating constitutive activation of PLA(2)IV alpha to RET/PTC-dependent tumorigenesis. Moreover, p38 stress-activated protein kinase is the downstream effector of RET/PTC that is responsible for PLA(2)IV alpha phosphorylation and activity. In summary, our data elucidate a novel mechanism in the control of thyroid tumor cell growth that is induced by the RET/PTC oncogenes and which is distinguishable from that of other oncogenes, such as BRAF. This mechanism is mediated by PLA(2)IV alpha and should be amenable to targeted pharmacologic intervention.",

The ligand for the receptor is still unknown. Previously, using a human epidermal growth factor receptor - Ret chimaeric receptor (HERRet) stably transfected into fibroblasts, it was shown that Ret activation induces the activation of p21ras, but, surprisingly, activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) was not observed (Santoro et al. (1994) Mol. Cell. Biol., 14, 663). In this report we describe early signaling events induced by the activated HERRet fusion receptor in a cell line derived from neuroectodermal tissue, SK-N-MC. In these cells, activated HERRet induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, complex formation of Shc with Grb2 and Sos and activation of p21ras. Importantly, also ERK2 is activated. This activation was strong and sustained for at least 2 h. Activation was abolished by the dominant negative p21rasasn17 mutant, showing that activation of ERK2 is mediated by p21ras. These results suggest that Ret can induce ERK2 activation in a p21ras dependent manner in cells derived from tissue where Ret is endogenously expressed.",

Chromosomal rearrangements involving the RET gene, known as RET/PTC, are prevalent in thyroid papillary carcinomas from patients with radiation history. We studied the generation of RET/PTC in HTori-3 immortalized human thyroid cells exposed to a range of doses of gamma-radiation and harvested 2, 5-6, and 9 d later. RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3 were detected by RT-PCR followed by Southern blotting and hybridization with internal oligonucleotide probes. No RET/PTC was found in cells harvested 2 and 5-6 d after irradiation, whereas 59 RET/PTC events were detected in cells collected 9 d after exposure. The average rate of RET/PTC induction was 0.1 x 10(-6) after exposure to 0.1 Gy, 1.6 x 10(-6) after 1 Gy, 3.0 x 10(-6) after 5 Gy, and 0.9 x 10(-6) after 10 Gy. When adjusted for cell survival, the rate after 10 Gy was comparable with those after 5 Gy. RET/PTC1 was more common than RET/PTC3 after each dose, comprising 80% of all rearrangements. In this study, we demonstrate a dose-dependent induction of RET/PTC rearrangements in human thyroid cells after exposure to 0.1-10 Gy gamma-radiation. This provides additional evidence for a direct link between this genetic event and radiation exposure and offers a powerful experimental system for studying radiation-induced carcinogenesis in the thyroid gland.",

VPA induced metabolic stress, activated AMP-activated protein kinase and increased autophagic flux. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy (chloroquine) augmented VPA-inducible cytotoxicity, suggesting that autophagy was protective in VPA-treated cells.

Expression of Gab1 PI3K-m in SK-N-MC human primitive neuroectodermal tumor cells expressing wild-type RET markedly impaired Akt phosphorylation, Rac1 activation, and lamellipodia formation that were induced by GDNF whereas expression of Gab1 SHP2-m partially impaired Erk activation. Furthermore, expression of Gab1 PI3K-m, but not Gab1 SHP2-m, in TT human medullary thyroid carcinoma cells expressing RET with a multiple endocrine neoplasia 2A mutation enhanced cytochrome c release, and apoptosis induced by etoposide, suggesting that PI3K is involved in survival of TT cells via a mitochondrial pathway.

Three main rearranged forms of RET have been described: RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3, which arise from a paracentric inversion of the long arm of chromosome 10, and RET/PTC2, which originates from a 10;17 translocation. We have developed a dual-color FISH approach to detect RET/PTC rearrangements in interphase nuclei of thyroid lesions. By using a pool of three cosmids encompassing the RET chromosome region and a chromosome 10 centromeric probe, we could discriminate between the presence of an inversion (RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3) or a translocation (RET/PTC2). We have investigated a series of thyroid tissue samples from Italian and French patients corresponding to a total of 69 PTCs and 22 benign lesions. Among PTCs, 13 (18.8%) showed a RET rearrangement, and 11 (15.9%) of these carried an inversion (RET/PTC1 or RET/PTC3) in more than 10% of the nuclei examined. Activated forms of RET were also observed in three adenomas. RT-PCR analysis on the same samples confirmed the presence and the type of rearrangement predicted using FISH analysis. An interesting difference in the frequency and type of RET rearrangements was detected between the Italian and the French patients. Furthermore, we identified a putative novel type of rearrangement in at least one PTC sample. Several PTCs carried a significant number of cells characterized by a trisomy or a tetrasomy of chromosome 10. Overall, the FISH approach in interphase nuclei represents a powerful tool for detecting, at the single cell level, RET/PTC rearrangements and other anomalies involving the RET chromosome region.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Thyroid carcinomas derived from follicular cells comprise papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), follicular thyroid carcinoma, poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC) and undifferentiated anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC). PTC, the most frequent thyroid carcinoma histotype, is associated with gene rearrangements that generate RET/PTC and TRK oncogenes and with BRAF-V600E and RAS gene mutations. These last two genetic lesions are also present in a fraction of PDTCs. The ERK1/2 pathway, downstream of the known oncogenes activated in PTC, has a central role in thyroid carcinogenesis. In this study, we demonstrate that the BRAF-V600E, RET/PTC, and TRK oncogenes upregulate the ERK1/2 pathway's attenuator cytoplasmic dual-phase phosphatase DUSP6/MKP3 in thyroid cells. We also show DUSP6 overexpression at the mRNA and protein levels in all the analysed PTC cell lines. Furthermore, DUSP6 mRNA was significantly higher in PTC and PDTC in comparison with normal thyroid tissues both in expression profile datasets and in patients' surgical samples analysed by real-time RT-PCR. Immunohistochemical and western blot analyses showed that DUSP6 was also overexpressed at the protein level in most PTC and PDTC surgical samples tested, but not in ATC, and revealed a positive correlation trend with ERK1/2 pathway activation. Finally, DUSP6 silencing reduced the neoplastic properties of four PTC cell lines, thus suggesting that DUSP6 may have a pro-tumorigenic role in thyroid carcinogenesis.",

The mechanisms by which different Ret isoforms (Ret-2A and Ret-2B) cause distinct neoplastic diseases remain largely unknown. On the other hand, forced expression of these mutated versions of Ret induces the rat pheochromocytoma cell line, PC12, to differentiate. Here we used an inducible vector encoding a dominant-negative Ras (Ras p21(N17)) to investigate the contributions of the Ras pathway to the phenotype induced in PC12 cells by the expression of either Ret-2A or Ret-2B mutants. We show that the Ret-induced molecular and morphological changes are both mediated by Ras-dependent pathways. However, even though inhibition of Ras activity was sufficient to revert Ret-induced differentiation, the kinetics of morphological reversion of the Ret-2B- was more rapid than the Ret-2A-transfected cells. Further, we show that in Ret-transfected cells the suc1-associated neurotrophic factor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation target, SNT, is chronically phosphorylated in tyrosine residues, and associates with the Sos substrate. These results indicate the activation of the Ras cascade as an essential pathway triggered by the chronic active Ret mutants in PC12 cells. Moreover, our data indicate SNT as a substrate for both Ret mutants, which might mediate the activation of this cascade.",

Unrecognized, this transformation can rapidly result in death. We report the only documented case of a thirty eight year old gentleman with MEN2A who presented to a community hospital with hemorrhagic shock and peritonitis secondary to an unrecognized hemorrhagic pheochromocytoma. The clinical course is notable for an inability to localize the source of hemorrhage during an initial damage control laparotomy that stabilized the patient sufficiently to allow emergent transfer to our facility, re-exploration for continued hemorrhage and abdominal compartment syndrome, and ultimately angiographic embolization of the left adrenal artery for control of the bleeding. Following recovery from his critical illness and appropriate medical management for pheochromocytoma, he returned for interval bilateral adrenal gland resection, from which his recovery was unremarkable. Our review of the literature highlights the high mortality associated with the undertaking of an operative intervention in the face of an unrecognized functional pheochromocytoma.

Twenty haplotypes and 57 genotypes were generated, and their association with the disease and with the clinical features were statistically evaluated. Interestingly, 14 genotypes were found to be unique to sMTC patients and 25 to controls. Two haplotypes and three genotypes, all including the intronic variants IVS1-126 and IVS14-24, were significantly associated with sMTC patients and with a higher tumour aggression. The functional activity of the only nonsynonymous RET variant (c.2071C > A, G691S) was tested for the first time. Interestingly, Western blot analyses showed that the fraction of Ret9-G691S protein located at the plasma membrane level was overrepresented when compared to Ret9-WT, suggesting facilitated targeting at the cell membrane for this variant. However, no transforming activity was shown in a focus formation assay on cells carrying the Ret9-G691S, against a possible oncogenic role of G691S variant.;RET genotypes including two intronic RET variants were associated with the risk of developing sMTC and to more aggressive behaviour. Further studies are warranted to elucidate whether these RET genotypes are in linkage disequilibrium with another susceptibility gene or whether these variants could play a role in the genesis of sMTC per se.",

At times, the FNAB diagnosis can be difficult, particularly of follicular-patterned lesions. Previous studies have shown that some immunohistochemical (IHC) markers may be helpful in establishing more accurate diagnosis. In this study, our goal was to evaluate four of the recently investigated markers in differentiating benign from malignant thyroid nodules on FNABs.;We performed IHC staining of galectin-3, Ret oncoprotein (Ret), HBME-1, and cytokeratin 19 (CK19), on cell block sections of thyroid FNAB cases that had corresponding surgical resections. They included 44 benign lesions (37 hyperplastic or cellular nodules, HN; and 7 follicular adenomas, FA) and 27 malignant tumors (6 follicular carcinoma, FC; 19 classic papillary carcinoma, PTC; and 2 follicular variant of papillary carcinoma, FVPC). The stains were done according to the standard avidin-biotin-peroxidase method.;Statistical analysis showed that immunoexpression was significantly higher in the malignant group for all four markers. The sensitivity for positive expression for all benign lesions versus malignant tumors was as follows: 10/44 (22.7%) versus 25/27 (92.6%) for galectin-3; 14/44 (31.8%) versus 23/27 (85%) for Ret; 12/44 (27.3%) versus 24/27 (88.8%) for HBME-1; and 13/44 (29.5%) versus 23/27 (85%) for CK19. The sensitivity and specificity was highest for galectin-3 (92.6% and 77.3%, respectively) followed by HMBE-1 (88.9% and 72.7%, respectively). When combining the markers' expressions, the panel of galectin-3 + HBME-1 showed the highest sensitivity and specificity (90.7% and 75%, respectively), but this was, however, lower than galectin-3 alone (92.3% and 77.3%, respectively).;We conclude that galectin-3 is the best single marker in differentiating benign from malignant thyroid lesions with the highest sensitivity and specificity. The galectin-3 + HBME-1 was the best combination for distinguishing benign from malignant lesions. Because they were the best two independent and combined markers, we recommend the use of the galectin-3 + HBME-1 panel to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of follicular-patterned thyroid lesions on FNABs.",

We identified microsomal prostaglandin E2 synthase-1 (mPGES-1) as a RET/PTC-inducible gene through subtraction hybridization cloning and expression profiling with custom microarrays. The inducible prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) biosynthetic enzymes cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and mPGES-1 are up-regulated in many cancers. COX-2 is overexpressed in thyroid malignancies compared with benign nodules and normal thyroid tissues. Eicosanoids may promote tumorigenesis through effects on tumor cell growth, immune surveillance, and angiogenesis. Conditional RET/PTC1 or RET/PTC3 expression in PCCL3 thyroid cells markedly induced mPGES-1 and COX-2. PGE2 was the principal prostanoid and up-regulated (by approximately 60-fold), whereas hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid metabolites were decreased, consistent with shunting of prostanoid biosynthesis toward PGE2 by coactivation of the two enzymes. RET/PTC activated mPGES-1 gene transcription. Based on experiments with kinase inhibitors, with PCCL3 cell lines with doxycycline-inducible expression of RET/PTC mutants with substitutions of critical tyrosine residues in the kinase domain, and lines with inducible expression of activated mutants of H-RAS and MEK1, RET/PTC was found to regulate mPGES-1 through Shc-RAS-MEK-ERK. These data show a direct relationship between activation of a tyrosine kinase receptor oncogene and regulation of PGE2 biosynthesis. As enzymes involved in prostanoid biosynthesis can be targeted with pharmacological inhibitors, these findings may have therapeutic implications.",

The predominant BRAF V600E mutation has not been detected in benign thyroid tissue so far, so consequently, this assumedly pathognomonic alteration is qualified to improve the preoperative diagnosis of PTC.;Two hundred ninety preoperatively harvested fine-needle aspiration biopsies (FNABs) underwent routine cytologic assessment. BRAF V600E mutation analysis was performed by mutation-specific PCR using the same cell material; a hybrid-specific RT-PCR assay was used for detection of RET/PTC1 rearrangements. Detected genetic alterations were verified by direct sequencing. Definitive histopathology was obtained in 93/290 lesions following surgery of the respective thyroid nodule.;While cytology alone diagnosed 13/30 malignancies (22 PTCs, 4 FTCs, 1 MTC, 1 UTC, 2 metastases), five additional malignancies were identified by supplementary mutation analysis. Cytology classified eight FNABs as benign, while postoperative histology demonstrated a thyroid malignancy (6 PTCs, 1 FTC, 1 metastasis). In four of these eight cases, the genetic analysis detected a BRAF V600E mutation or a RET/PTC1 rearrangement. Classifying both suspicious and malignant FNAB results as positive cytology results, supplementary genetic testing increased the overall sensitivity of FNAB from 70.4 to 85.7%, the positive predictive value (PPV) from 59.4 to 64.9%, and the negative predictive value (NPV) from 84.0 to 91.3%.;Supplementary mutation analysis of RET and especially of the BRAF V600E mutation in FNABs is a fast and probably cost-effective assay in routine diagnostic setting.

The present study is aimed to investigate the role of microRNA (miR)-449 in the progression of PTC. Our results revealed that miR-449 was underexpressed in the collected PTC specimens compared with non-cancerous PTC tissues. Overexpression of miR-449 induced a cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and inhibited PTC cell growth in vitro. Further studies revealed that RET proto-oncogene (RET) is a novel miR-449 target, due to miR-449 bound directly to its 3'-untranslated region and miR-449 mimic reduced the protein expression of RET. Similar to the effects of miR-449 overexpression, RET downregulation inhibited cell growth, whereas RET overexpression reversed the inhibitive effect of miR-449 mimic. Furthermore, miR-449 overexpression inhibited the nuclear translocation of β-catenin and reduced the expression of several downstream genes, including c-Myc, cyclin D1, T cell-specific transcription factor (TCF) and lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF-1), and inactivated the β-catenin pathway in TPC-1 cells. Moreover, overexpression of β-catenin prevented miR-449-reduced cell cycle arrest and cell viability. In xenograft animal experiments, miR-449 overexpression effectively suppressed the tumor growth of PTC. Taken together, our research indicated that miR-449 functions as an anti-oncogene by targeting RET, and that miR-449 overexpression inhibited the growth of PTC by inactivating the β-catenin pathway. Thus, miR-449 may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PTC.",

The present study shows that the position of the RET mutation is related to disease phenotype; codon 634 mutations are predictive of families predisposed to pheochromocytoma. In 18% of our patients, the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma preceded detection of medullary thyroid carcinoma. Therefore, mutation analysis of the RET gene should be performed in apparently \"sporadic\" cases of pheochromocytoma to confirm or exclude MEN 2. The most sensitive biochemical marker for pheochromocytoma in MEN 2 is 24-h urinary epinephrine excretion. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and MIBG scintigraphy are all highly sensitive methods to localize pheochromocytoma. We conclude that, in all families with MEN 2, mutational analysis of the RET proto-oncogene should be performed, both to identify gene carriers for MEN 2 and to identify specific mutations that are more strongly associated with pheochromocytoma.",

Here, we show that RET/PTC stimulates the beta-catenin pathway. By stimulating PI3K/AKT and Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), RET/PTC promotes glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) phosphorylation, thereby reducing GSK3beta-mediated NH(2)-terminal beta-catenin (Ser33/Ser37/Thr41) phosphorylation. In addition, RET/PTC physically interacts with beta-catenin and increases its phosphotyrosine content. The increased free pool of S/T(nonphospho)/Y(phospho)beta-catenin is stabilized as a result of the reduced binding affinity for the Axin/GSK3beta complex and activates the transcription factor T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor. Moreover, through the ERK pathway, RET/PTC stimulates cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation and promotes the formation of a beta-catenin-CREB-CREB-binding protein/p300 transcriptional complex. Transcriptional complexes containing beta-catenin are recruited to the cyclin D1 promoter and a cyclin D1 gene promoter reporter is active in RET/PTC-expressing cells. Silencing of beta-catenin by small interfering RNA inhibits proliferation of RET/PTC-transformed PC Cl3 thyrocytes, whereas a constitutively active form of beta-catenin stimulates autonomous proliferation of thyroid cells. Thus, multiple signaling events downstream from RET/PTC converge on beta-catenin to stimulate cell proliferation.",

Gene ablation studies have revealed that the GDNF-RET receptor system is essential for the development of kidney and peripheral neurons, including sympathetic, parasympathetic and enteric neurons. RET can activate various signaling pathways such as RAS/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways. These signaling pathways are activated via binding of adaptor proteins to intracellular tyrosine residues of RET phosphorylated by its own kinase activity. The RET is profoundly involved in the development of several human neuroendocrine diseases. The constitutive activation of the RET by somatic rearrangement with other partner genes or germ-line mutations causes a considerable population of human papillary thyroid carcinomas or multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2A and 2B, respectively, whereas the dysfunction of RET by germ-line missense and/or nonsense mutations causes Hirschsprung's disease. Biological properties of mutant RET protein determine the disease phenotype. For example, the MEN 2B mutation alters the substrate specificity of RET tyrosine kinase and RET carrying the MEN 2B mutation hereby induces the different set of genes from that carrying the MEN 2A mutation.

Here, we demonstrate that pro-inflammatory programs are selectively activated by TRAF2 and TRAF6 association with RET/PTC oncoproteins. Eliminating this mechanism reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine production without decreasing transformation efficiency. Conversely, ablating MEK/ERK or PI3K/AKT signaling eliminates transformation but not pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion.

In most cases the activation consisted of an in frame fusion of the RET tyrosine-kinase domain, at the carboxy-terminus, with heterologous genes at the amino-terminus. These chimeric oncogenes are collectively named RET/PTC. Two forms of these gene products, RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3, have been tested for their ability to induce meiotic maturation in Xenopus oocytes.

The injected oocytes expressed polypeptides recognized by an anti-RET gene product antibody as well as by an antiphosphotyrosine antibody, indicating activation of the tyrosine-kinase domain.

Now we found a new type of RET rearrangement: By the 5'RACE method we demonstrated in cDNA the fusion of the tyrosine kinase domain of RET with a truncated ELE1 gene shorter than the ELE1 in RET/PTC3. Sequencing of genomic DNA revealed a rearrangement breakpoint at position 41 of a new ELE1 intron (522 bp in length). The new oncogene RET/ delta PTC3 is shortened by one ELE1 exon of 144 bp in length. Structural considerations of the ele1 amino terminal of RET/ delta PTC3 suggest that the transforming activity of the fusion protein is apparently not affected by this truncation. The exon lacking in RET/ delta PTC3 was found to code in the reciprocal transcript RET/ delta ELE1 and increased its size by 144 bp.

To investigate the frequency of TRK protooncogene rearrangement in Chinese thyroid tumors, we performed reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to amplify specific TRK rearrangement transcripts. We examined thyroid tumors of 40 patients, including 14 papillary carcinomas, 4 follicular carcinomas, 1 Hurthle cell carcinoma, 1 insular carcinoma, and 20 nodular goiters. NF874 NIH3T3, NF723 NIH3T3, NF861 NIH3T3, and NF881 NIH3T3 were used as controls for TRK-T3, TRK-T2, TRK-T1, and TRK, respectively. No known TRK protooncogene rearrangements were detected among the 40 thyroid tumors in our studies. We suggest that the TK receptor NTRK1 activation seems less important than RET activation in PTCs in the Chinese population.",

        "Doc_abstract":"In spite of its simple organization, the thyroid gland can give rise to a wide spectrum of neoplasms, ranging from innocuous to highly malignant lesions. Approximately 94% of the malignancies is represented by well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma originating from follicular cells. These neoplasms are divided into two main categories, papillary thyroid carcinoma and follicular thyroid carcinoma. Despite their origin from the same type of cells, the two neoplasias show different biological behavior and a different set of genetic features, including specific cytogenetic patterns. Thyroid adenoma is the benign counterpart of follicular carcinoma. No benign counterpart of papillary carcinoma has yet been identified. The chromosomes of thyroid nodules have been investigated since 1965, and different cytogenetic subgroups have been recognized, some of which show structural chromosomal rearrangements. These structural changes lead to the formation of fusion genes RET-PTC, TRK(-T), and BRAF-AKAP9, which originate as a result of intrachromosomal or interchromosomal rearrangements and are found in papillary thyroid carcinoma. Fusion genes involving PPARγ are caused mainly by translocations and are characteristic of follicular neoplastic tissue. Radiation exposure and the particular architectural arrangement of chromatin regions in which the affected genes lie during interphase are thought to favor the formation of fusion genes in papillary thyroid carcinoma and possibly also in follicular thyroid carcinoma.",

The identification of mutations in the RET proto-oncogene segregating with the disease phenotype in MEN 2A and FMTC families has made it possible to re-examine the validity of using this test for the identification of affected family members.;Sequential and single pentagastrin stimulation test data were collected following the identification of RET mutation positive and RET mutation negative members of families with MEN 2A or FMTC.;RET mutations were identified in 16 Australian and New Zealand MEN 2A or FMTC families. An analysis of 39 individuals from these families was included in this study. Thirty-two individuals (14 males, 18 females) had previously been determined as RET mutation negative. Seven individuals (6 males, 1 female) had previously been determined as RET mutation positive. Two RET mutation negative males had thyroidectomy based on prior pentagastrin test results.;Serum calcitonin levels in response to stimulation with pentagastrin were measured at 0, 1, 2, 5 and 10 minutes post injection. Mutation analysis of the RET proto-oncogene was performed in all individuals. In two RET mutation negative individuals from two MEN 2A families, thyroidectomy was performed and C-cells were quantitated in order to determine the diagnosis of C-cell hyperplasia.;There was a statistically significant difference (P < 0.013) between RET mutation negative male and female mean peak calcitonin responses of 282 +/- 236 and 96 +/- 62 (mean +/- SD) ng/l respectively. False positive responses to pentagastrin stimulation were identified in seven individuals who were RET mutation negative in two of the 16 families. Histologic examination of the thyroid glands in the two RET mutation negative individuals who had thyroidectomy demonstrated C-cell hyperplasia in one but not in the other.;There is considerable overlap between pentagastrin test results in individuals who are RET mutation positive and those who are RET mutation negative. These results indicate a need for routine performance of RET proto-oncogene analysis on all individuals at risk of developing MEN 2A or FMTC and a coupling of pentagastrin test results and RET proto-oncogene analysis in the decision to proceed with thyroidectomy.",

        "Doc_abstract":"A major early event in papillary thyroid carcinogenesis is constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway caused by alterations of a single gene, typically rearrangements of the RET and NTRK1 genes or point mutations in the BRAF and RAS genes. In childhood papillary thyroid cancer, regardless of history of radiation exposure, RET/PTC rearrangements are a major event. Conversely, in adult-onset papillary thyroid cancer among the general population, the most common molecular event is BRAF(V600E) point mutation, not RET/PTC rearrangements. To clarify which gene alteration, chromosome aberration, or point mutation preferentially occurs in radiation-associated adult-onset papillary thyroid cancer, we have performed molecular analyses on RET/PTC rearrangements and BRAF(V600E) mutation in 71 papillary thyroid cancer cases among atomic bomb survivors (including 21 cases not exposed to atomic bomb radiation), in relation to radiation dose as well as time elapsed since atomic bomb radiation exposure. RET/PTC rearrangements showed significantly increased frequency with increased radiation dose (P(trend) = 0.002). In contrast, BRAF(V600E) mutation was less frequent in cases exposed to higher radiation dose (P(trend) < 0.001). Papillary thyroid cancer subjects harboring RET/PTC rearrangements developed this cancer earlier than did cases with BRAF(V600E) mutation (P = 0.03). These findings were confirmed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. These results suggest that RET/PTC rearrangements play an important role in radiation-associated thyroid carcinogenesis.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Knowledge of the molecular events that govern human thyroid tumorigenesis has grown considerably in the past ten years. Key genetic alterations and new oncogenic pathways have been identified. Molecular genetic aberrations in thyroid carcinomas bear noteworthy resemblance to those in acute myelogenous leukemias. Thyroid carcinomas and myeloid leukemias both possess transcription factor gene rearrangements-PPARgamma-related translocations in thyroid carcinoma and RARalpha-related and CBF-related translocations (amongst others) in myeloid leukemia. PPARgamma and RARalpha are closely related members ofthe same nuclear receptor subfamily, and the PML-RARalpha and PAX8-PPARgamma fusion proteins both function as dominant negative inhibitors of their wild-type parent proteins. Thyroid carcinomas and myeloid leukemias also both harbor NRAS mutations (15-25% of both cancers) and receptor tyrosine kinase mutations--RET mutations in thyroid carcinomas and FLT3 mutations in myeloid leukemias. The NRAS and tyrosine receptor kinase mutations are not observed in the same thyroid carcinoma or leukemia patients, suggesting that multiple initiating pathways exist in both. Lastly, thyroid carcinomas and myeloid leukemias possess p53 mutations at relatively low frequency (10-15%) in patients who tend to be older and have more aggressive, therapy resistant disease. Such parallels are unlikely to occur by chance alone and argue that common mechanisms underlie these diverse epithelial and hematologic cancers. The comparison of thyroid carcinomas and myeloid leukemias may highlight areas of thyroid cancer investigation worthy of further focus. For example, few collaborating mutations have been defined in thyroid carcinomas even though they play a clear role in myeloid leukemias, as exemplified by RARalpha rearrangements and FLT3 mutations that together dictate the promyleocytic leukemia phenotype. Functional interactions between collaborating mutations are possible at multiple levels, and it is tempting to speculate that some thyroid carcinomas might develop through an unique combination or co-activation of RET and RAS and/or RET and PPARgamma (and/or other) signaling systems. In fact, the ELE1-RET (PTC3) fusion protein contains the ELE1 nuclear receptor co-activator domain and it appears to physically associate with and inhibit wild-type PPARgamma in some papillary carcinomas. The similarities of the fusion proteins in thyroid carcinoma and myeloid leukemia suggest that a more directed search for fusion genes in non-thyroid carcinomas is warranted. In fact, novel fusion genes have been identified recently in aggressive midline, secretory breast, and renal cell carcinomas, although the epithelial nature of the latter is not well-documented. Interestingly, these cancers all tend to present more frequently in adolescence and young adulthood in a manner similar to thyroid and myeloid malignancies that have fusion genes. The analyses of cancers that present earlier in life may enhance fusion gene recognition in other carcinoma types. Definition and biologic characterization of the precursor cells that give rise to thyroid carcinoma will also be important. Myeloid leukemias are thought to arise from stem/progenitor cells that acquire disturbed self-renewal and differentiation capacities but retain characteristics of the myeloid lineages. Although the presence of comparable stem/progenitor cells in the thyroid are not defined, distinct thyroid cancer lineages and patterns of differentiation exist and candidate stem/progenitor cells such as the p63-immunoreactive solid cell nests are apparent. A last important area is development of molecular-based therapies for thyroid carcinoma patients resistant to standard radio-iodine treatment. Treatments for such cancers are limited and pathways defined by thyroid cancer mutations are prime targets for pharmacologic interventions with molecular inhibitors. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors and nuclear receptor ligands have proven dramatically effective in some myeloid leukemia patients. Various molecular inhibitors are being investigated now in thyroid cancer models. Such developments predict that the thyroid cancer model will continue to provide biologic insights into human carcinoma biology and that improved pathologic diagnosis and treatment for thyroid cancer patients sit on the not too distant horizon."},

Immunohistochemistry was performed using a polyclonal antibody against tyrosine kinase domain of Ret protein. Screening for RET/PTC1-3 was performed using RT-PCR and specific primers for each rearrangement; complementarily, a subset of cases were tested using RET exon 10/11 primers designed to detect the expression of the wild-type RET. Positive staining was observed in 30 of 39 (77%) tumours. RET/PTC1-3 rearrangements were detected in 8 of 32 (25%) cases. Ten of 15 (67%) cases expressed the wild-type RET. Two tumours characterised by positive immunostaining, absence of RET 5' expression and absence of RET/PTC1-3 expression were considered as expressing a RET rearrangement different from RET/PTC-1, -2, or -3. In 3 of 10 tumours, expression of the wild-type RET coexisted with the expression of a RET rearrangement. Positive staining does not necessarily mean the presence of a rearrangement; it may correspond to the expression of the wild-type RET, RET rearrangement or both. On the contrary, positive staining without evidence for the expression of the extracellular domain of RET is highly suggestive of a RET rearrangement independently of the type.

        "Doc_abstract":"A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method was adopted for detecting transcripts specific for retTPC/PTC, an activated form of the ret proto-oncogene reported to be found specifically in human papillary thyroid carcinomas. By this sensitive method retTPC/PTC transcript could be detected in about 500 fg of total RNA of TPC-1, a retTPC/PTC transcript-positive cell line. In Japanese patients, one of 11 papillary thyroid carcinomas, four of 19 follicular adenomas and one of two adenomatous goiters were positive for the transcript, indicating that the involvement of retTPC/PTC is not specific to papillary thyroid carcinomas. In several independent RT-PCR experiments using different portions of the same positive carcinoma tissue, retTPC/PTC transcript was always detected. On the other hand, the transcript was not always positive in different RNA samples from benign cases, suggesting that positive carcinomas are probably composed of clonal cell populations all expressing retTPC/PTC, whereas adenomas and adenomatous goiter comprise heterogeneous populations: both positive and negative for retTPC/PTC transcript. Activation of the ret proto-oncogene might therefore be involved in malignant conversion to thyroid carcinomas.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Hyperparathyroidism (HPT) in its hereditary variants assumes special forms, has special associations, and requires special managements. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH or FBHH) and neonatal severe primary hyperparathyroidism (NSHPT) reflect heterozygous or homozygous mutations, respectively, in the calcium-sensing receptor. FHH and NSHPT represent the mildest and severest variants of HPT. Both cause hypercalcemia from birth and atypical HPT that always and uniquely persists after subtotal parathyroidectomy. Their HPT is likely polyclonal and nonneoplastic. In contrast, mono- or oligo-clonal parathyroid neoplasia underlays most other HPT variants: multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A), and hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome (HPT-JT). Familial-isolated HPT combines several diagnoses, including occult forms of the above syndromes. Each neoplastic variant has tumors in multiple parathyroids and a delayed, but still early age of onset for HPT (average age, 25-35 years). Each justifies special and similar approaches to parathyroidectomy: typically, identification of four glands, subtotal parathyroidectomy, rapid intraoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) assays, and parathyroid cryopreservation. Outcomes of parathyroidectomy remain suboptimal in each. Each syndrome of parathyroid neoplasia associates with characteristic cancer(s): enteropancreatic neuroendocrine or foregut carcinoid tissues (MEN1), thyroidal C cells (MEN2A), or parathyroid (HPT-JT). HPT has promoted gene discovery more through its rare hereditary variants than through common adenoma; the main genes causing four of six hereditary variants are known. The RET mutation test became essential in management of MEN2A. The MEN1 test is less urgent, because it rarely guides a major patient benefit. The CASR test, perhaps least urgent, has largely been unavailable. Further progress in molecular genetics will enhance understandings, diagnosis, and therapy of HPT.",

        "Doc_abstract":"In thyroid, the diagnosis of papillary carcinoma (PC) is based on nuclear features; however, identification of these features is inconsistent and controversial. Proposed markers of PC include HBME-1, specific cytokeratins (CK) such as CK19, and ret, the latter reflecting a ret/PTC rearrangement. We applied immunohistochemical stains to determine the diagnostic accuracy of these three markers. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from 232 surgically resected thyroid nodules included 40 hyperplastic nodules (NH), 35 follicular adenomas (FA), 138 papillary carcinomas (PC; 54 classical papillary tumors and 84 follicular variant papillary carcinomas [FVPC]), 4 follicular carcinomas (FC), 6 insular carcinomas (IC), 7 Hürthle cell carcinomas (HCC), and 2 anaplastic carcinomas (AC). HBME-1 and ret were negative in all NH and FA; some of these exhibited focal CK19 reactivity in areas of degeneration. Half of the FC and AC exhibited HBME-1 staining but no positivity for CK19 or ret. In PC, 20% of cases stained for all three markers. Classical PC had the highest positivity with staining for HBME-1 in 70%, CK19 in 80%, and ret in 78%. FVPC were positive for HBME-1 in 45%, for CK19 in 57%, and for ret in 63%; only 7 FVPC were negative for all three markers. The six IC exhibited 67% staining for HBME-1 and 50% positivity for CK19 and ret. The seven HCC had 29% positivity for HBME-1 and CK19, and 57% positivity for ret. This panel of three immunohistochemical markers provides a useful means of diagnosing PC. Focal CK19 staining may be found in benign lesions, but diffuse positivity is characteristic of PC. HBME-1 positivity indicates malignancy but not papillary differentiation. Only rarely are all three markers negative in PC; this panel therefore provides an objective and reproducible tool for the analysis of difficult thyroid nodules.",

Associations between mutation types and (131) I dose and other characteristics were explored.;RET/PTC (ret proto-oncogene/papillary thyroid carcinoma) rearrangements were most common (35%), followed by BRAF (15%) and RAS (8%) point mutations. Two tumors carrying PAX8/PPARγ (paired box 8/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) rearrangement were identified. A significant negative association with (131) I dose for BRAF and RAS point mutations and a significant concave association with (131) I dose, with an inflection point at 1.6 Gy and odds ratio of 2.1, based on a linear-quadratic model for RET/PTC and PAX8/PPARγ rearrangements were found. The trends with dose were significantly different between tumors with point mutations and rearrangements. Compared with point mutations, rearrangements were associated with residence in the relatively iodine-deficient Zhytomyr region, younger age at exposure or surgery, and male sex.;These results provide the first demonstration of PAX8/PPARγ rearrangements in post-Chernobyl tumors and show different associations for point mutations and chromosomal rearrangements with (131) I dose and other factors. These data support the relationship between chromosomal rearrangements, but not point mutations, and (131) I exposure and point to a possible role of iodine deficiency in generation of RET/PTC rearrangements in these patients.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Thyroid cancers are the most common endocrine malignancy. Radiation exposure, family history of thyroid cancer and some inherited conditions are the most important predisposing factors for the development of thyroid cancer. Three mitogenic signalling pathways have been described in the thyroid cell, which are influenced by various stimulatory and inhibitory hormones, growth factors and neurotransmitters. Various proto-oncogenes and oncogenes like ras, braf, trk, met and RET also play a role in the signal transduction systems. Two theories have been described in thyroid cancer pathogenesis, the foetal cell carcinogenesis theory and the more common, multistep carcinogenesis theory. The multistep carcinogenesis theory is now the accepted model in many human cancers, including thyroid cancer. The early events of tumour formation are the consequence of activation of either various growth factors or the proto-oncogenes like ras, met or ret. This results in the formation of differentiated thyroid cancers like the papillary, follicular or Hurthle cell cancers. The later stages of tumour formation involve further activation of proto-oncogenes and loss or inactivation of tumour suppressor genes like p53. Based on this theory, follicular carcinomas are generated from follicular adenomas and papillary carcinomas from precursor cells generated from thyrocytes. Anaplastic carcinoma may develop from papillary or follicular carcinoma by dedifferentiation. In this review article, we highlight the molecular pathogenesis of thyroid tumours.",

These rearrangements result in the formation of chimaeric genes composed of the tyrosine kinase domain of NTRK1 fused to 5' sequences of different genes. To investigate if the NTRK1 gene plays a role in radiation-induced thyroid carcinogenesis, we looked for the presence of NTRK1-activating rearrangements in 32 human thyroid tumours (16 follicular adenomas, 14 papillary carcinomas and two lymph-node metastases of papillary thyroid carcinomas) from patients who had received external radiation, using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, Southern blot and direct sequencing techniques. These data were compared with those obtained in a series of 28 'spontaneous' benign and malignant thyroid tumours, collected from patients without a history of radiation exposure and four in vitro culture cell lines derived from 'spontaneous' thyroid cancers. Our results concerning the radiation-associated tumours showed that only rearrangements between NTRK1 and TPM3 genes (TRK oncogene) were detected in 2/14 papillary carcinomas and in one lymph-node metastasis of one of these papillary thyroid carcinomas. All the radiation-associated adenomas were negative. In the 'spontaneous' tumours, only one of the 14 papillary carcinomas and one of the four in vitro culture cell lines, derived from a papillary carcinoma, presented a NTRK1 rearrangement also with the TPM3 gene. Twenty-five of this series of radiation-associated tumours were previously studied for the ras and RET/PTC oncogenes. In conclusion, our data: (a) show that the overall frequency of NTRK1 rearrangements is similar between radiation-associated (2/31: 6%) and 'spontaneous' epithelial thyroid tumours (2/32: 6%). The frequency, if we consider exclusively the papillary carcinomas, is in both cases 12%; (b) show that the TRK oncogene plays a role in the development of a minority of radiation-associated papillary thyroid carcinomas but not in adenomas; and (c) confirm that RET/PTC rearrangements are the major genetic alteration associated with ionizing radiation-induced thyroid tumorigenesis.",

Common fragile sites frequently coincide with the location of genes involved in carcinogenic chromosomal translocations, suggesting their role in cancer formation. However, there has been no direct evidence linking breakage at fragile sites to the formation of a cancer-specific translocation. Here, we studied the involvement of fragile sites in the formation of RET/PTC rearrangements, which are frequently found in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). These rearrangements are commonly associated with radiation exposure; however, most of the tumors found in adults are not linked to radiation. In this study, we provide structural and biochemical evidence that the RET, CCDC6 and NCOA4 genes participating in two major types of RET/PTC rearrangements, are located in common fragile sites FRA10C and FRA10G, and undergo DNA breakage after exposure to fragile site-inducing chemicals.

In most cases the activation consisted of the fusion of its tyrosine-kinase domain with the 5'-terminal region of a gene designated H4 or D10S170. We have named the resulting H4/RET chimeric oncogene RET/PTC. Another activated form of the RET oncogene has subsequently been found in a thyroid carcinoma and is now referred to as RET/PTC2. Here we report the identification and cloning of a novel rearranged version of the RET oncogene in a human thyroid papillary carcinoma. In this case the tyrosine-kinase domain of RET was fused to a sequence 790 bp long belonging to a new gene that we have named RFG (RET Fused Gene). This novel chimeric oncogene has been designated RET/PTC3. In order to have more insights into the function of RFG we have completely cloned and sequenced its cDNA. RFG predicted amino-acid sequence does not have any significant homology to any already known genes and is ubiquitously expressed in human and mouse tissues.

Differentiated thyroid carcinomas (DTCs) represent more than 90% of all thyroid carcinomas and comprise the papillary and follicular thyroid carcinoma subtypes. Anaplastic thyroid carcinomas correspond to less than 1% of all thyroid tumors and can arise de novo or by dedifferentiation of a differentiated tumor. The etiology of DTCs is not fully understood. Several genetic events have been implicated in thyroid tumorigenesis. Point mutations in the BRAF or RAS genes or rearranged in transformation (RET)/papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) gene rearrangements are observed in approximately 70% of papillary cancer cases. Follicular carcinomas commonly harbor RAS mutations and paired box gene 8 (PAX8)-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) rearrangements. Anaplastic carcinomas may have a wide set of genetic alterations, that include gene effectors in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and/or β-catenin signaling pathways. These distinct genetic alterations constitutively activate the MAPK, PI3K and β-catenin signaling pathways, which have been implicated in thyroid cancer development and progression. In this context, the evaluation of specific genes, as well as the knowledge of their effects on thyroid carcinogenesis may provide important information on disease presentation, prognosis and therapy, through the development of specific tyrosine kinase targets.

All high copy transgenic mice developed bilateral thyroid tumors as early as 4 days of age.

A subset of thyroid tumors have loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 10q22-23, a region harboring the gene responsible for Cowden disease, an autosomal dominant hamartoma syndrome associated with thyroid and breast tumors. PTEN/MMAC1/TEP1 codes for a dual-specificity phosphatase and is likely a tumor suppressor gene. We sought to determine the PTEN status in a series of epithelial thyroid neoplasms. We studied 95 sporadic thyroid tumors, of which 39 were papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs), 12 were follicular carcinomas, 9 were anaplastic carcinomas, 5 were Hürthle cell carcinomas, 21 were nonfunctioning follicular adenomas, and 9 were Hürthle cell adenomas. Direct sequencing of PCR-amplified products was performed for all nine exons of PTEN. Two polymorphic markers, one located in intron 8 and another, a dinucleotide repeat marker, AFMa086wg9, located within intron 2, were analyzed in paired blood-tumor DNA samples to assess hemizygous deletions of PTEN. We found a somatic frameshift mutation in one PTC, which was expected to generate a premature stop codon 2 amino acids downstream. Twenty-six % of informative benign tumors (four follicular adenomas and three Hürthle cell adenomas) and only 3 of 49 (6.1%) informative malignant tumors (one PTC, one follicular carcinoma, and one anaplastic carcinoma) showed evidence of hemizygous deletion of PTEN (P = 0.046). We conclude that a subset of thyroid tumors have somatic deletions of the PTEN gene, predominantly the benign forms, and that small intragenic mutations of PTEN are infrequent in thyroid tumors. We speculate that other mechanisms of PTEN inactivation, rather than small intragenic mutations, might occur in the hemizygously deleted samples and act as the \"Knudson second hit.\" Alternatively, other tumor suppressor genes mapping to chromosome 10q22-23 could be the actual targets for such deletions and thus represent the various hits in the pathway of multistep carcinogenesis.",

In FVPTCs, we observed ras mutation in 6 of 24 cases (25%), BRAF mutation in 1 of 13 cases (7.6%), and ret rearrangement in 5 of 12 cases (41.7%).

To determine if TRK-T1 expression can cause thyroid cancer in vivo, we developed transgenic mice that express the human TRK-T1 fusion protein in the thyroid. Immunohistochemical analysis of TRK-T1 transgenic mouse thyroids revealed TRK-T1 staining within the thyroid follicular epithelium. In contrast to nontransgenic littermates, 54% of transgenic mice developed thyroid abnormalities that included follicular hyperplasia and papillary carcinoma.

We report here the biochemical characterization of the human RET tyrosine kinase domain and the structure determination of the non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms. Both structures adopt the same active kinase conformation competent to bind ATP and substrate and have a pre-organized activation loop conformation that is independent of phosphorylation status. In agreement with the structural data, enzyme kinetic data show that autophosphorylation produces only a modest increase in activity. Longer forms of RET containing the juxtamembrane domain and C-terminal tail exhibited similar kinetic behavior, implying that there is no cis-inhibitory mechanism within the RET intracellular domain. Our results suggest the existence of alternative inhibitory mechanisms, possibly in trans, for the autoregulation of RET kinase activity. We also present the structures of the RET tyrosine kinase domain bound to two inhibitors, the pyrazolopyrimidine PP1 and the clinically relevant 4-anilinoquinazoline ZD6474.

Here, we show that the RET protooncogene is expressed during mouse embryogenesis in an unusual temporal and spatial manner. In fact, its expression was first detected around day 10 of gestation in the basal plate of the neural tube and in the developing encephalic ganglia, and later its pattern of expression was definitely established in neural structures, mostly in neural crest derivatives (spinal and encephalic ganglia). As far as the central nervous system is concerned, RET expression was confined to the ventral part of the midbrain from 12.5 days postcoitum (dpc) until birth. RET was also found to be expressed within structures of sensory organs such as the ganglial layer of the retina and the olfactory epithelium. A peculiar pattern of RET expression was clearly observed in the wall of the gut and in the nephrogenic zone of the developing kidney cortex, specifically in the metanephrogenic vesicles. Finally, RET was found to be expressed in the liver mostly between 12.5 dpc and 14.5 dpc.

Compared with the others, ARAF is a much weaker stimulator of MAPK. To determine the key RAF isoform mediating RET/PTC-induced ERK phosphorylation, we stably transfected doxycycline-inducible RET/PTC3-expressing thyroid PCCL3 cells with small interfering RNA vectors to induce selective knockdown of BRAF or CRAF. Conditional RET/PTC3 expression induced comparable ERK phosphorylation in CRAF knockdown and control cells but negligible ERK phosphorylation in BRAF knockdown cells. Selective knockdown of BRAF prevented RET/PTC-dependent down-regulation of the sodium iodide symporter, a gene that confers key biological effects of RET/PTC in PTCs. Moreover, microarray analysis revealed numerous RET/PTC-regulated genes showing requirement of BRAF for appropriate expression.

Moreover, identification of molecular markers as well as a better understanding of thyroid carcinogenesis will help develop innovative targeted therapies, particularly in patients with metastatic iodo-resistant thyroid carcinoma. To date, four types of somatic genetic alterations are known to hold potential interest for the diagnosis and/or prognosis of follicular cell-derived thyroid carcinomas: BRAF and RAS mutations, and RET/PTC and PAX8/PPARγ rearrangements. Other recent molecular biomarkers have been investigated in thyroid oncology, in particular different microRNA signatures. This review describes the different aspects of ancillary methods, including those bassed on molecular biology, that are of current interest for the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of follicular cell-derived thyroid carcinomas.",

There are several clinically approved multi-kinase inhibitors that target RET as a secondary pharmacology but additional activities, most notably inhibition of KDR, lead to dose-limiting toxicities. There is, therefore, a clinical need for more specific RET kinase inhibitors. Herein we report our efforts towards identifying a potent and selective RET inhibitor using vandetanib 1 as the starting point for structure-based drug design. Phenolic anilinoquinazolines exemplified by 6 showed improved affinities towards RET but, unsurprisingly, suffered from high metabolic clearance. Efforts to mitigate the metabolic liability of the phenol led to the discovery that a flanking substituent not only improved the hepatocyte stability, but could also impart a significant gain in selectivity. This culminated in the identification of 36; a potent RET inhibitor with much improved selectivity against KDR. ",

The objective was to evaluate if the selective inactivation of menin in murine thyroid glands expressing RET÷PTC3 and E7 oncogenes, might induce an increased index of proliferation and a more rapid development of thyroid hyperplasia and÷or tumors. The thyroid glands of 77 mice aged 4-18 months (31 expressing the E7 oncogene and 25 the RET÷PTC3 oncogene) were analyzed for histological changes and Ki67 proliferation index. Fifty-two mice had selective inactivation of menin in the thyroid gland (16 mice with RET÷PTC3 oncogene and 19 mice with E7 oncogene). As compared to wild type, mice with inactivation of menin presented an increased Ki67 proliferation index. Mice presenting the E7 oncogene showed larger thyroid glands with a pattern of diffuse hyperplasia. Mice expressing the RET÷PTC3 oncogene presented larger thyroid glands compared to the wild type mice but smaller compared to E7 mice. The lesions in the RET÷PTC3 group were \"proliferative papillary cystic changes\" (60%), \"cribriform\" (16%), \"solid\" (8%) and a combination of these patterns in the rest of the thyroid glands. The inactivation of menin in the thyroid gland of young mice does not seem to change the histological pattern, but it influences the proliferation of follicular cells. Further molecular studies especially in aged mice are needed to better understand the correlation between certain oncogenes and the inactive status of menin. ",

They have also further been associated with both familial and sporadic medullary thyroid carcinomas. Missense mutations affecting cysteine residues within the extracellular domain of the receptor causes constitutive tyrosine kinase activation through the formation of disulfide-bonded homodimers. We have recently reported that a somatic 6 bp in-frame deletion, originally coding for Glu632-Leu633, potently activates the RET gene. This activation is increased with respect to the frequent MEN 2A-associated missense mutation Cys634Arg. This finding specifically correlated to the clinic behavior of the corresponding tumor, which was characterized by an unusually aggressive progression with both multiple and recurrent metastases. By examining the possibility that this deletion acts in a manner similar to cysteine substitution, we have analysed the molecular mechanism by which this oncogenic activation occurs. Phosphorylated dimers of the deleted Ret receptor were detected in immunoprecipitates separated under non-reducing conditions. Like other Cys point mutations, this 6 bp deletion affecting two amino acid residues between two adjacent Cys, is capable of activating the transforming ability of Ret by promoting receptor dimerization. These results suggest that alteration to cysteine residue position or pairing is capable of inducing ligand independent dimerization. Furthermore, we present data demonstrating that the processing and sorting of the Ret membrane receptor to the cell surface is affected by mutation type.",

The ability to detect fusion genes is relevant for a correct diagnosis and for therapy.

A high prevalence of RET gene rearrangements (62.3%) with a significant predominance of ELE1/RET (PTC3) over H4/RET (PTC1) rearrangements was found in PTCs of the first post-Chernobyl decade. NTRK1 rearrangements were rare (3.3%). In 3.3%, we observed novel types of RET rearrangements: GOLGA5/ RET (PTC5), HTIF/RET (PTC6), RFG7/RET (PTC7), and an as yet undefined RFGX/RET.RET rearrangements, preferentially ELE1/RET, are related to rapid tumor development. At longer intervals after exposure to ionizing radiation, the prevalence of RET rearrangements declines with a shift from ELE1/RET to H4/RET, most significantly in female patients. The prevalence of specific types of rearrangements is independent of age at irradiation. A significantly higher prevalence of ELE1/RET was observed in the most heavily contaminated Oblasts, Gomel and Brest, suggesting a preferential formation of this type of rearrangement after high thyroid doses. RET rearrangement is related to aggressive growth: Rearrangement-positive PTCs were in a more advanced pT category and more frequently in the pN1 category at presentation than rearrangement-negative PTCs. ELE1/RET is related to the solid variant of PTC, H4/RET more frequently to typical papillary structures. The genotype/phenotype evaluation of post-Chernobyl PTCs reveals a characteristic spectrum of gene rearrangements that lead to typical phenotypes with important biological and clinical implications.",

Because these oncogenes encode chimeric proteins, novel RET/PTC epitopes may be targets of antitumor immune responses. We have been interested in the RET/PTC3 (RP3) fusion protein because this family member is more frequently expressed in radiation-induced and childhood papillary carcinomas than other members of the fusion oncogene family. We hypothesized that the activated kinase of c-RET, in the form of RP3, when expressed in patients with thyroid disease, presents an unusual altered self target for T cell recognition. Interestingly, we find that immunization with mouse RP3 protein can induce a strongly immunogenic response to RP3, although this response is not directed against the peptide comprising the unique fusion region. Rather, the responses are specific for the carboxyl-terminal portion of RP3 that is derived from the self protein c-RET. Furthermore, transplantation of RP3-expressing thyroid tumors into naive mice resulted in leukocytic infiltration, tumor rejection, and induction of RP3-specific T cells. Thus, the somatic fusion of two unrelated self proteins results in the development of a uniquely immunogenic response directed against self epitopes within RP3. These studies may better define the mechanisms controlling the initiation of thyroid-specific immune responses and provide insight into the design of novel molecules for invoking tumor-specific immunity.",

In MEN 2A or 2B, early genetic diagnosis before the development of clinical tumors is crucial for the cure of the disease. We studied mutations of ret proto-oncogene in 3 Korean families with MEN 2A and searched for new restriction sites that could be used for genetic diagnosis. By direct sequencing of exon 10 and 11 harboring 'hot' spots, heterozygous point mutation was detected at positions translating cysteine codon in all 3 families. In 2 families, mutations at codon 634 in exon 11 were found (from TGC to CGC or TAC), yielding a new CfoI or RsaI restriction site. In one family, a mutation was located at codon 618 in exon 10 (from TGC to CGC), generating a new CfoI restriction site. These new restriction sites were used in detecting 2 undiagnosed family members without clinical symptoms or signs. In one of them, thyroidectomy was performed to disclose a small medullary thyroid cancer. These results indicate that Korean MEN 2A patients have germ-line mutations in the ret protooncogene at the cysteine residues like patients of other races, and the strategy employing direct sequencing to find mutations at 'hot spot' and search for ensuing new restriction sites could be a useful approach for the molecular diagnosis of genetic diseases accompanied by mutations in restricted areas of disease genes such as MEN 2.",

To identify additional low-penetrance genes, we have done a two-stage case-control study in two European populations using high-throughput genotyping. We selected 417 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) belonging to 69 genes either related to RET signaling pathway/functions or involved in key processes for cancer development. TagSNPs and functional variants were included where possible. These SNPs were initially studied in the largest known series of sMTC cases (n = 266) and controls (n = 422), all of Spanish origin. In stage II, an independent British series of 155 sMTC patients and 531 controls was included to validate the previous results. Associations were assessed by an exhaustive analysis of individual SNPs but also considering gene- and linkage disequilibrium-based haplotypes. This strategy allowed us to identify seven low-penetrance genes, six of them (STAT1, AURKA, BCL2, CDKN2B, CDK6, and COMT) consistently associated with sMTC risk in the two case-control series and a seventh (HRAS) with individual SNPs and haplotypes associated with sMTC in the Spanish data set. The potential role of CDKN2B was confirmed by a functional assay showing a role of a SNP (rs7044859) in the promoter region in altering the binding of the transcription factor HNF1. These results highlight the utility of association studies using homogeneous series of cases for better understanding complex diseases.",

It has been known for a long time that exposure of cells to radiation results in extensive DNA damage; however, a small number of studies have tried to explain the mechanisms of radiation-induced carcinogenesis. The high prevalence of RET/PTC rearrangements in patients who have received external radiation, and the evidence of in vitro induction of RET rearrangements in human cells, suggest an enhanced sensitivity of the RET genomic region to damage by ionizing radiation. To assess whether RET is indeed more sensitive to radiations than other genomic regions, we used a COMET assay coupled with fluorescence in situ hybridization, which allows the measurement of DNA fragmentation in defined genomic regions of single cells. We compared the initial DNA damage of the genomic regions of RET, CXCL12/SDF1, ABL, MYC, PLA2G2A, p53, and JAK2 induced by ionizing radiation in both a lymphoblastoid and a fetal thyroid cell line. In both cell lines, RET fragmentation was significantly higher than in other genomic regions. Moreover, a differential distribution of signals within the COMET was associated with a higher percentage of RET fragments in the tail. RET was more susceptible to fragmentation in the thyroid-derived cells than in lymphoblasts. This enhanced susceptibility of RET to ionizing radiation suggests the possibility of using it as a radiation exposure marker.",

This could be also the case for ret but only in radiation-associated tumours;--ras, ret, trk and probably gsp and met: starting from small papillary lesions ('spontaneous' or radiation-induced) and progressing to a clinically evident papillary carcinoma;--the p53 gene playing a role only in the final dedifferentiation process. Simultaneous alteration in the same sample of combinations of ras, gsp, ret, trk and TSHR was found in only a minority of the approximately 150 tumours studied. These data suggest an interchangeable role for these genes in the initiation of 'spontaneous' or radiation-associated epithelial thyroid tumorigenesis.

The aim of this study was to identify molecular determinants of RET sensitivity to ZD6474. Here, we show that mutation of RET tyrosine 806 to cysteine (Y806C) induced RET kinase resistance to ZD6474 (IC(50): 933 nM). Y806 maps close to the gate-keeper position at the RET kinase nucleotide-binding pocket. Although tyrosine 806 is a RET auto-phosphorylation site, its substitution to phenylalanine (Y806F) did not markedly affect RET susceptibility to ZD6474 (IC(50): 87 nM), suggesting that phosphorylation of Y806 is not required for compound binding. Accordingly, the introduction of a phosphomimetic residue (Y806E) also caused resistance to ZD6474, albeit of a lesser degree (IC(50): 512 nM) than the cysteine mutation. Y806C/E RET mutants were also resistant to ZD6474 with respect to intracellular signalling and activation of an AP1-responsive promoter. We conclude that Y806 is a molecular determinant of RET sensitivity to ZD6474. Y806C is a natural RET mutation identified in a patient affected by multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B. Based on its rare occurrence, it is unlikely that Y806C will be a frequent cause of refractoriness to ZD6474; however, it may be envisaged that mutations at this site can mediate secondary resistance formation in patients treated with the compound.",

We analyzed the mutational state of 116 PTC and we compared gene expression profiles of PTC-ga(+) and PTC-ga(-) from data of a 200 gene macroarray and quantitative PCR. Seventy five PTC were PTC-ga(+) and 41 were PTC-ga(-). Unsupervised analyses of macroarray data by hierarchical clustering led to a complete segregation of PTC-ga(+) and PTC-ga(-). In a series of 42 genes previously recognized as PTC 'marker' genes, 22 were found to be expressed at a comparable level in PTC-ga(-) and normal tissue. Thyroid-specific genes, TPO, TG, DIO1, and DIO2 were under-expressed in PTC-ga(+) but expressed at a normal level in PTC-ga(-). A few genes including DUOX1 and DUOX2 were selectively dys-regulated in PTC-ga(-). Tumor grade of PTC-ga(-) was lower than that of PTC-ga(+). There was a strong association between the mutational state and histiotype of PTC; 81% of PTC follicular variants were corresponded to PTC-ga(-), whereas 84% of PTC of classical form were PTC-ga(+).

        "Doc_abstract":"A post-Chernobyl papillary thyroid cancer, displaying a novel ELE1/RET oncogenic rearrangement with an anomalous fusion transcript, was molecularly characterized. In spite of the presence of a normal breakpoint in exon 5 of the activating ELE1 gene, the sequence of the rearranged genomic DNA showed a previously unreported intra-exonic breakpoint in the RET protooncogene. As a consequence, a cDNA sequence 93 nucleotides larger than the regular one, and with the exon 5 of ELE1 joined to exon 11 instead of exon 12 of RET, is formed. To characterize the product of this new oncogenic ELE1/RET rearrangement, here designated as RET/PTC4, we performed an immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis on cell extracts from NIH3T3 transfectants. The results showed the presence of two isoforms of the chimeric protein, displaying a constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation. As expected, the molecular weight of this protein was higher than that of RET/ PTC3 protein (p80 and p85, instead of p76 and p81). Previous reports, from our and other laboratories, showed that post-Chernobyl papillary thyroid carcinomas are characterized by a high frequency (about 60%) of RET oncogenic rearrangements (Fugazzola et al., 1995; Klugbauer et al., 1995; Ito et al., 1994). These events predominantly involve ELE1 activating sequence, thus producing RET/PTC3 oncogene (Fugazzola et al., 1995; Klugbauer et al., 1995). Hence, this elevated frequency of RET rearrangements could increase the probability of selecting unusual events as that here described. Alternatively, targeted radiation effects could be responsible for the atypical RET rearrangement producing RET/PTC4 oncogene.",

High-sensitivity RT-PCR detected RET/PTC in all of these and in 12 additional cases, where the levels of expression corresponded to one to five positive cells. Real-time LightCycler RT-PCR detected RET/PTC in 12 and Southern blot analysis in 11 tumors. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, 14 tumors were positive, including nine cases with 50-86% positive cells and five cases with 17-35% positive cells. Overall, nine (14%) tumors harbored clonal rearrangements, which were present in the majority of tumor cells and detected by all five methods. Five (8%) cases had subclonal rearrangements present in a smaller portion of tumor cells and detected by most methods. Twelve (18%) tumors had nonclonal RET/PTC that were detected only by high-sensitivity RT-PCR. No other mutations were found in tumors harboring clonal RET/PTC, whereas 60% of tumors with subclonal and 42% of tumors with nonclonal RET/PTC harbored additional mutations.;Our data suggest that broad variability in the reported prevalence of RET/PTC rearrangement is at least in part a result of the use of different detection methods and tumor genetic heterogeneity.",

In poorly differentiated tumors and anaplastic tumors often an accumulation of genetic alterations from differentiated thyroid cancer but also novel gene mutations can be observed. The C-cell-derived medullary thyroid cancer evolves through the constitutive activation of the RET kinase, either through germline RET mutations or somatic RET and RAS mutations.

To date, these rearrangements have never been analyzed in routine air-dried FNA smears, but only in frozen tissue, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, and in fresh FNA material. Fixed routine air-dried FNA samples have hitherto been judged as generally not suitable for testing these rearrangements in a clinical setting.

To assess RNA quality, an intron-spanning PAX8 cDNA was amplified.;Acceptable RNA quality was obtained from 95% of the FNA samples and 92% of the FFPE samples.

A comprehensive survey of oncogenic mutations in the follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma according to its encapsulated and infiltrative forms has not been performed. Paraffin tissue from 28 patients with encapsulated and 19 with infiltrative follicular variant were subjected to mass spectrometry genotyping encompassing the most significant oncogenes in thyroid carcinomas: 111 mutations in RET, BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, KRAS, PIK3CA, AKT1 and other related genes. There was no difference in age, gender, tumor size and angioinvasion between encapsulated or infiltrative tumors. Infiltrative carcinomas had a much higher frequency of extrathyroid extension, positive margins and nodal metastases than encapsulated tumors (P<0.05). The BRAF 1799T>A mutation was found in 5 of 19 (26%) of the infiltrative tumor and in none of the encapsulated carcinomas (P=0.007).

One encapsulated carcinoma showed a PAX8/PPARgamma rearrangement, whereas two infiltrative tumors harbored RET/PTC fusions. Encapsulated follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinomas have a molecular profile very close to follicular adenomas/carcinomas (high rate of RAS and absence of BRAF mutations).

The expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of Sam68, a protein implicated in mRNA nucleocytoplasmic translocation and splicing, were further examined in RET-transfected cells and thyroid tumors. Of relevance, cells transfected with RETMEN2B examined for anti-phosphotyrosine bound proteins, showed other proteins implicated in splicing: DEAD-box p68 RNA helicase, SYNCRIP, and hnRNP K. Western blotting analysis suggested that these proteins are singularly tyrosine phosphorylated in RETMEN2B-transfected cells, and that they constitutively bind with Sam68.

        "Doc_abstract":"The susceptibility of thyroid epithelium to radiation-induced carcinogenesis is well recognised. In this context, thyroid carcinogenesis is associated with specific somatic ret/papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) rearrangements and morphologically with the papillary phenotype. Previous studies have demonstrated the possibility of inducing ret rearrangements in vitro using X-rays. The purpose of our study was to assess whether gamma (gamma) radiation using a Caesium 137 source can induce specific ret rearrangements in a human thyroid epithelial cell culture model. We further hypothesised that if radiation-induced thyroid carcinogenesis is associated with non-random rearrangement events, then DNA copy gain and loss induced by irradiation may also occur in a non-random manner. We irradiated SV40-immortalised human thyroid epithelial cells with incremental doses of gamma-radiation and, using TaqMan reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, looked for the presence of the common ret rearrangements. Cohorts showing evidence of ret/PTC chimeric transcripts were further analysed using microarray comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) to detect copy gain and loss associated with radiation. Four Grays of gamma-radiation was sufficient to induce ret/PTC-3. In this model, transcripts of ret/PTC-1 were not detected, and we suggest that the type of radiation may influence the resulting rearrangement that occurs. Using array CGH, we have demonstrated a predominant pattern of subtelomeric deletions occurring in association with this radiation cohort and raise the possibility that chromosome 10 may be a hotspot for radiation-induced damage for as yet unknown reasons.",

The aim of this study was to proof the concept of dendritic cell immunization with a tumor cell-specific polypeptide hormone as a target molecule in a transgenic mouse model for medullary thyroid carcinoma (Ret/Cal mice).;Ret/Cal mice were repeatedly immunized for up to 6 months with amino acid-modified (xenogenic) calcitonin-pulsed dendritic cells. Xenogenic calcitonin was chosen for immunization due to its higher immunogenicity as compared with murine calcitonin.;Lymph nodes from control protein-immunized mice did not show any macroscopic abnormalities, whereas tumor peptide-treated mice revealed in general profoundly enlarged lymph nodes. In tetramer analysis of paratumorous lymph nodes, 1.9% to 3.1% of all infiltrating CD8(+) T cells were specific for one of three tumor epitopes tested. Analysis of the activated IFN-gamma-secreting component in splenic cells revealed an average of 2.8% tumor epitope-specific CD8(+) cells. Immunohistochemistry revealed strong CD8(+) tumor infiltration in calcitonin-vaccinated mice. In addition, these cells also showed strong in vitro lysis capacity at up to 63.3%. Most importantly, calcitonin-immunized mice revealed largely diminished tumor outgrowth (-74.3%) compared with control mice (P < 0.0001). Likewise, serum calcitonin levels in calcitonin-vaccinated Ret/Cal mice were lower than in the control group.;These results have a major effect, as they are the first to establish a role for xenogenic polypeptide hormones as target molecules for immunotherapy in endocrine malignancies.",

It is indeed now known that BRAF and RAS mutations and RET/PTC and PAX8/PPARγ rearrangements account for the majority of molecular alterations detected in differentiated thyroid cancers. Abnormal regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is also a promising way of research. The diagnostic utility and prognostic value of detecting these molecular events has been analyzed in several recent studies. BRAF mutation analysis improves the performance of fine-needle aspiration diagnosis by increasing specificity in \"indeterminate\" cytologies and sensitivity in false negatives. Testing for a \"panel of mutations\" (BRAF, RAS, RET/PTC and PAX8/PPARγ) improves the performance, detecting papillary carcinomas with non-classic histology. The specificity of these analyzes is excellent but their sensitivity is still insufficient. In the future, specific miRNAs expression profiles in thyroid carcinoma and identification of new mutations might provide interesting information. Several studies have found that BRAF mutations are associated with a more aggressive tumor behavior, a higher risk of recurrence and treatment failure. With regard to the other mutations and rearrangements, current data are conflicting and it seems premature to draw practical conclusions applicable in routine practice. Lastly, targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, based on our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of thyroid oncogenesis, has shown promise in metastatic, progressive, and radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid carcinomas.",

BRAF mutation screening focused on exon 15 and exon 11 of the gene by single-stranded conformational polymorphism and sequence analysis. Search of RET/PTC expression was conducted with the RT-PCR technique. The molecular genetic study of the BRAF gene showed the presence of a missense thymine to adenine transversion at nucleotide 1796, resulting in the V599E substitution, in 24 of 60 PTCs (40%), none of six follicular adenomas, and none of five follicular carcinomas or one anaplastic carcinoma. Moreover, nine of 60 PTCs (15%) presented RET/PTC expression. A genetico-clinical association analysis showed a statistically significant correlation between BRAF mutation and development of PTCs of the classic papillary histotype (P = 0.038). On the contrary, no link could be detected between expression of BRAF(V599E) and age at diagnosis, gender, dimension, and local invasiveness of the primary cancer, presence of lymph node metastases, tumor stage, and multifocality of the disease.

MEN 2B is associated with medullary thyroid carcinoma and pheochromocytoma with oral, ocular, and alimentary submucosal ganglioneuromas and Marfanoid body features. Approximately 50% of cases are thought to be spontaneous mutations. The RET protooncogene (RET) is a 21-exon gene encoding a tyrosine kinase receptor. A codon 918 germ line mutation, which converts a highly conserved methionine to a threonine in the intracellular tyrosine kinase portion of this receptor of RET, has been identified in 95% of patients with MEN 2B. This mutation is easily detected by a direct deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing or restriction enzyme (Fok 1) analysis of amplified polymerase chain reaction products. The RET gene is normally expressed in the oral and gastrointestinal submucosal neural ganglia, and the codon 918 mutation is thought to cause neuromas by virtue of its transforming activity in these ganglia. Identifying clinical features of MEN 2B in an 11-year-old boy by an oral pathologist led to confirmation by mutational analysis. Before genetic testing was available, the patient, and at a later date his mother, underwent thyroidectomies based solely on biochemical testing. Results indicated the patient had the codon 918 mutation, whereas his phenotypically normal mother, father, and older brother had normal RET analyses. Studies in families have demonstrated that the mutant allele is derived from the father with possible acquisition during spermatogenesis. We believe the mother of our affected patient to be normal; the absence of phenotypic features of MEN 2B and a normal genotype suggest her calcitonin abnormalities and minimal evidence for C-cell hyperplasia were inconsequential. Molecular analysis for RET abnormalities will likely supplant biochemical methods of diagnosis in patients with MEN 2B.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Thyroid cancer poses a significant clinical challenge, and our understanding of its pathogenesis is incomplete. To gain insight into the pathogenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma, transcriptional profiles of four normal thyroids and 51 papillary carcinomas (PCs) were generated using DNA microarrays. The tumors were genotyped for their common activating mutations: BRAF V600E point mutation, RET/PTC1 and 3 rearrangement and point mutations of KRAS, HRAS and NRAS. Principal component analysis based on the entire expression data set separated the PCs into three groups that were found to reflect tumor morphology and mutational status. By combining expression profiles with mutational status, we defined distinct expression profiles for the BRAF, RET/PTC and RAS mutation groups. Using small numbers of genes, a simple classifier was able to classify correctly the mutational status of all 40 tumors with known mutations. One tumor without a detectable mutation was predicted by the classifier to have a RET/PTC rearrangement and was shown to contain one by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. Among the mutation-specific expression signatures were genes whose differential expression was a direct consequence of the mutation, as well as genes involved in a variety of biological processes including immune response and signal transduction. Expression of one mutation-specific differentially expressed gene, TPO, was validated at the protein level using immunohistochemistry and tissue arrays containing an independent set of tumors. The results demonstrate that mutational status is the primary determinant of gene expression variation within these tumors, a finding that may have clinical and diagnostic significance and predicts success for therapies designed to prevent the consequences of these mutations.",

Recently, let-7 microRNA was found to reduce RAS levels in lung cancer, acting as a tumor suppressor gene. Here, we report that RET/PTC3 oncogenic activation in PCCL3 rat thyroid cells markedly reduces let-7f expression. Moreover, stable transfection of let-7 microRNA in TPC-1 cells, which harbor RET/PTC1 rearrangement, inhibits MAPK activation. As a result, let-7f was capable of reducing TPC-1 cell growth, and this might be explained, at least in part, by decreased messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of cell cycle stimulators such as MYC and CCND1 (cyclin D1) and increased P21 cell cycle inhibitor mRNA. In addition, let-7 enhanced transcriptional expression of molecular markers of thyroid differentiation such as TITF1 and TG. Thus, reduced expression of let-7f might be an essential molecular event in RET/PTC malignant transformation. Moreover, let-7f effects on thyroid growth and differentiation might attenuate neoplastic process of RET/PTC papillary thyroid oncogenesis through impairment of MAPK signaling pathway activation. This is the first functional demonstration of an association of let-7 with thyroid cancer cell growth and differentiation.",

In vitro studies have certain pitfalls, one of which is the use of cell culture systems such as the NIH3T3 cells, in which RET usually is not expressed in contrast to the in vivo situation. Recent data suggest that an overrepresentation of mutant RET as a 'second hit' event might trigger tumorigenesis. However, alterations in other genes might contribute to this overrepresentation of RET or impact on MEN 2-related tumor development through completely different mechanisms and pathways. The final goal of further elucidating the natural history and pathogenesis of MEN2-related tumors should be the chance to offer patients with RET germline mutations an optimal cancer prevention (e.g. codon specific recommendations for prophylactic thyroidectomy) and treatment program, especially for metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma for which presently no effective therapy other than surgery exists.",

Moreover, it has been shown that phosphorylated tyrosine receptors, activated by their ligands, form multiprotein complexes responsible for transducing mitogenic or differentiation signals. We have therefore begun to analyse in this study the signal transduction pathways triggered by different Ret and Trk oncoproteins. We have shown that the SH2 domain of the adaptor protein Shc coimmunoprecipitates with all the Ret and Trk oncoproteins as well as with NGF-activated proto-Trk receptor. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Trk proteins both normal and oncogenic is necessary for their binding to Shc. In addition, in cells containing either Ret or Trk oncoproteins, Shc proteins are constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine and bound to Grb2. Only in in vitro experiments were Ret and Trk oncoproteins shown to bind the SH2 region of Grb2. Finally, when proto-Trk product is stimulated by NGF, Shc phosphorylation and association with Grb2 are induced.

Here, we test whether the oncoprotein RET/PTC could be responsible for this effect, since RET/PTC rearrangements are quite prevalent in PTC and RET/PTC activates PLCgamma, an upstream modulator of PKCs. At 3 h after induction of RET/PTC1 or RET/PTC3 expression, there was evidence of PKCepsilon activation. Activation was restricted to PKCepsilon, as acute expression of RET/PTC did not change the subcellular distribution of other PKC isozymes expressed in PCCL3 cells. Prolonged RET/PTC expression (2-6 days) produced an isozyme-specific change in PKCepsilon subcellular localization and a decrease in total PKCepsilon levels. The expression of RET/PTC3(Y541F), which does not interact with PLCgamma, but signals normally through other RET effectors, had no effect on PKCepsilon distribution at any of the time points examined. However, downregulation of total PKCepsilon levels was only partially prevented by expression of RET/PTC(Y541F). Cells with decreased PKCepsilon following prolonged expression of RET/PTC were relatively resistant to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Based on our previous observation that PCCL3 cells expressing a dominant-negative PKCepsilon are also markedly resistant to apoptosis, we propose that selective downregulation of PKCepsilon following prolonged RET/PTC activation promotes cell survival and clonal expansion.",

Histological examination of thyroid tumors showed a range of morphological features.

Immunoreactivity for thyroglobulin and high molecular weight keratins was strong. Somatic APC mutation analysis revealed an insertion of a novel long interspersed nuclear element-1-like sequence in one tumor sample, suggesting disruption of APC. In three FAP patients, ret/PTC-1 and ret/PTC-3 were expressed in thyroid cancers. No positivity was observed for ret/ PTC-2. p53 immunohistochemistry was positive in only one section of a recurrent thyroid tumor sample.

RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3 are the most prevalent variants. We have found RET rearrangements in 35.8% of TCV (14 of 39 cases). Whereas the prevalences of RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3 were almost equal in classic and follicular PTC, all of the TCV-positive cases expressed the RET/PTC3 rearrangement. These findings prompted us to compare RET/PTC3 and RET/PTC1 in an in vitro thyroid model system. We have expressed the two oncogenes in PC Cl 3 rat thyroid epithelial cells and found that RET/PTC3 is endowed with a strikingly more potent mitogenic effect than RET/PTC1. Mechanistically, this difference correlated with an increased signaling activity of RET/PTC3.

We show that RET and NCOA4 are much closer to each other than expected based on their genomic separation. Modeling of chromosome folding in this region suggests the presence of chromosome coiling with coils of approximately 8 Mb in length, which positions the RET gene close to both, the NCOA4 and H4, loci. There was no significant variation in gene proximity between adult and pediatric thyroid cells.

It exerts its growth-promoting effect through a classical genomic and a non-genomic pathway, mediated via a membrane-bound estrogen receptor. This receptor is linked to the tyrosine kinase signaling pathways MAPK and PI3K. In papillary thyroid carcinomas, these pathways may be activated either by a chromosomal rearrangement of the tyrosine receptor kinase TRKA, by RET/PTC genes, or by a BRAF mutation and, in addition, in females they may be stimulated by high levels of estrogen. Furthermore, estrogen is involved in the regulation of angiogenesis and metastasis that are critical for the outcome of thyroid cancer.

The aim of this review is to critically analyse the features of this entity. A search of the literature revealed 25 clinicopathological studies with in-depth analysis of features of DSVPTC. Overall, the prevalence of DSVPTC varies from 0.7-6.6% of all papillary thyroid carcinoma. Higher prevalence of DSVPTC was noted in paediatric patients and in patients affected by irradiation. DSVPTC tends to occur more frequently in women and in patients in the third decade of life. Macroscopically, DSVPTC can involve the thyroid gland extensively without forming a dominant mass. Microscopic examination of DSVPTC revealed extensive fibrosis, squamous metaplasia and numerous psammoma bodies. The latter pathological feature can aid in the pre-operative diagnosis of the entity by fine needle aspiration and ultrasound. Compared to conventional papillary thyroid carcinoma, DSVPTC had a higher incidence of lymph node metastases at presentation. Distant metastases were noted in approximately 5% of the cases. Patients with DSVPTC were recommended to be managed by aggressive treatment protocols. It is likely that as a result of this, the prognosis of the patients with DSVPTC was noted to be similar to conventional papillary thyroid carcinoma. Overall, cancer recurrence and cancer related mortality have been reported in 14% and 3%, respectively, of patients with DSVPTC. In immunohistochemical studies, DSVPTC showed different expression patterns of epithelial membrane antigen, galectin 3, cell adhesion molecules, p53 and p63 when compared to conventional papillary thyroid carcinoma. On genetic analysis, the occurrence of BRAF and RAS mutations are uncommon events in DSVPTC and activation of RET/PTC rearrangements are common. To conclude, DSVPTC has different clinical, pathological and molecular profiles when compared to conventional papillary thyroid carcinoma. ",

However, criteria for selecting thyroid tumors that may benefit from sunitinib are lacking.;The effect of activating somatic mutations in the KRAS and BRAF genes on the responsiveness to sunitinib was evaluated in a panel of thyroid cancer cell lines harboring wild-type KRAS and BRAF genes, the RET/PTC1 rearrangement, the G12R KRAS, or the V600E BRAF mutation.;Sunitinib was found to selectively inhibit cell proliferation, induce cell accumulation in the G0-G1 phase, and inhibit the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in both KRAS/BRAF wild-type thyroid cancer cells and in tumor cells harboring the RET/PTC rearrangement, whereas it was completely ineffective in KRAS- or BRAF-mutated thyroid carcinoma cells. This differential antitumor activity of sunitinib did not correlate with the expression profile of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2, and 3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α and cKIT genes. Of note, the constitutive activation of RAS/RAF/ERK signaling in KRAS/BRAF wild-type cells by transfection of the R12 HRAS or V600E BRAF mutants or stimulation with epithelial growth factor resulted in the loss of responsiveness to sunitinib, whereas pharmacological inhibition of MAPK kinase activity resulted in the resensitization of KRAS- or BRAF-mutated cells to the multikinase inhibitor.;The constitutive activation of the RAS/RAF/ERK pathway may favor resistance to sunitinib in thyroid carcinoma cells.",

The aim of this study was to address some of the existing controversies by comparing two groups of unselected PTCs, one with and the other without ret rearrangement, with regard to several clinicopathological and biological features. Thirty-three PTCs were selected at random. ret rearrangement was found in eight cases (24.2 per cent) using Southern blot analysis. The mean age of the patients with tumours displaying ret rearrangement (28 +/- 3.1 years) was significantly lower than that of the patients harbouring cases that did not present rearrangement (45 +/- 2.9 years). The large majority of the tumours with ret rearrangement displayed a papillary or mixed follicular-papillary pattern and very low proliferative activity. ret rearrangement correlated significantly with decreased cytoplasmic expression of E-cadherin. No significant differences were found regarding the gender of the patients, tumour size, multicentricity, extrathyroidal growth, vascular invasion, lymphocytic infiltration, lymph node involvement or the expression of E-cadherin (membrane), c-erb-B2, c-met, Bcl-2, and vimentin.

In this study, we analyze the relationship between these alterations and the microscopic features of papillary carcinomas, their clinical features, and prognostic characteristics. Ninety-seven papillary carcinomas were studied; in all cases, frozen tissue was available for nucleic acid extraction. Of 96 unselected cases, 42% were positive for BRAF, 18% for RET/PTC, and 15% for RAS mutations. Morphologic features were evaluated in detail in 61 cases and 6 characteristic nuclear features and 3 additional microscopic features were assessed quantitatively. At least 4 nuclear features were found in each tumor, with nuclear pseudoinclusions being the least frequent finding in all mutation groups. BRAF mutations were associated with older patient age, typical papillary appearance or the tall cell variant, a higher rate of extrathyroidal extension, and more advanced tumor stage at presentation. RET/PTC rearrangements presented at younger age and had predominantly typical papillary histology, frequent psammoma bodies, and a high rate of lymph node metastases. Tumors with RAS mutations were exclusively the follicular variant of papillary carcinoma and correlated with significantly less prominent nuclear features and low rate of lymph node metastases. These findings demonstrate that BRAF, RET/PTC, and RAS mutations are associated with distinct microscopic, clinical, and biologic features of thyroid papillary carcinomas.",

It has been reported that exposure to external medical radiation or to external and internal radiation from atomic bomb explosions, nuclear tests or nuclear accidents leads to an increased risk for thyroid cancer. The risk of thyroid cancer is maximal during the first years of life and decreases with increasing age at exposure due to morphologic and functional heterogeneity in the thyroid tissue of children and adults. Also it has been indicated that iodine deficiency increases the risk of the thyroid cancer related to radioactive iodines in case of exposure to radioactive iodines in childhood and the stable iodine supplementation reduces this risk. Ionizing radiation produces a range of mutations in irradiated cells of the thyroid.

Thyroid cancer often has an inflammatory cell infiltrate, which includes lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and mast cells, whose role in thyroid cancer is still not completely understood. However, most experimental evidence suggests these cells exert a protumorigenic function.

RET rearrangements are an initiating event in papillary carcinoma, and simultaneously the most characteristic mutation for this type of cancer. They are followed by further, not well recognized, mutations. RAS mutations are regarded as a crucial event in the development of follicular tumors already at the adenoma step, while in papillary cancer they belong to the spectrum of secondary mutations, enabling tumor progression. Aberrant DNA methylation, causing loss of P16 tumor supressor gene, may be a common event in both types of cancer. Aneuploidy is seen much more frequently in follicular than in papillary cancer, which also exhibits a low rate for loss of heterozygosity and microsatellite instability. Mutations of the P53 tumor supressor gene are a common feature of undifferentiated thyroid cancers and could be responsible for their aggressive phenotype. RET rearrangements have been proposed as identifying fingerprints for irradiation induced thyroid cancer in children. Our own data speak against this hypothesis.

Eighteen EPONs were retrieved from our surgical pathology files and reviewed for defining morphologic features. Cases having the typical nuclear features of PTC were excluded. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CK19, HBME1, and CD56 was carried out. Microdissection, polymerase chain reaction, and sequencing of exon 15 of the BRAF gene were completed. Cases were evaluated for rearranged in transformation/papillary thyroid carcinoma RET/PTC rearrangement by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). The majority of the tumors exhibited a distinctive histologic appearance. They were composed of true papillae lined by a single layer of predominantly cuboidal cells with oncocytic cytoplasm; hobnailing was typically prominent. Three tumors showed taller cells with uniformly apical nuclei and no hobnailing. Ten of 18 cases showed vascular and/or capsular invasion; hence, if the diagnostic criteria used to evaluate follicular neoplasms are applied, more than half of the tumors would be considered minimally invasive carcinomas. No cases were immunoreactive with antibodies to HBME1, whereas only 1 of 13 was immunoreactive for CK19. Six of 7 interpretable cases were immunoreactive for CD56. No BRAF point mutations or RET/PTC rearrangements were identified in the examined cases. All patients were alive at the time of last follow-up and no locally recurrent disease had been reported; however, 1 case was remarkable for a lymph node metastasis.

Members of this Grb family have also been shown to interact with other kinases through their SH2 domain. Here we examined the functional role of Grb14 in thyroid cancer using loss- and gain-of-function approaches. Stable knockdown of Grb14 in thyroid cancer cells facilitated IR signaling. In contrast, RET phosphorylation was diminished in concert with reduced activation of Akt and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Loss of Grb14 also resulted in diminished cell proliferation and invasion both in vitro and in mouse flank xenografts. In complementary studies, forced expression of Grb14 interrupted IR signaling but facilitated RET activation, STAT3 and Akt phosphorylation. Consistent with these findings Grb14 overexpression enhanced cell invasion and resulted in striking metastases in an orthotopic thyroid cancer mouse xenograft model.

The combination of BRAF testing and cytology improved the accuracy of cytology from 69.9% to 89.2% (P < 0.05). Moreover, BRAF testing confirmed 82.4% of papillary carcinomas with suspicious cytology and identified 33.3% of papillary carcinomas with atypia cytology.;Of the three candidate markers, BRAF testing showed diagnostic utility in fine needle aspiration. Combining BRAF testing with cytology improves the accuracy of fine needle biopsy. Those who have positive BRAF and malignant or suspicious malignant cytology can undergo thyroidectomy without a frozen section.",

Mutations leading to constitutive activation of MAP kinase effectors -the tyrosine receptor kinase RET and the intracellular signalling effectors RAS and BRAF- are essential for the pathogenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Similarly, there is increasing evidence demonstrating that mutations leading to activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase (PI3K)/AKT effectors -PTEN and PI3KCa- are essential for the pathogenesis of follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC). Besides this strong relationship between the histological phenotype and the pathway predominantly activated, the nature of the genetic event seems to determine the biological behaviour of the tumour and the ultimate clinical outcome of the patient. In this review we will summarise and discuss the main genetic events related to thyroid cancer initiation, the contribution of genomics and the convenience of using a new molecular classification of thyroid cancer, complementary to the clinicopathological classification.

Because thyroid nodules are more common than thyroid cancers and are associated with thyroid cancer risk, we evaluated several polymorphisms potentially relevant to thyroid tumors and assessed interaction with ionizing radiation exposure to the thyroid gland. Thyroid nodules were detected in 1998 by ultrasound screening of 2997 persons who lived near the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site in Kazakhstan when they were children (1949-1962). Cases with thyroid nodules (n = 907) were frequency matched (1:1) to those without nodules by ethnicity (Kazakh or Russian), gender and age at screening. Thyroid gland radiation doses were estimated from fallout deposition patterns, residence history and diet. We analyzed 23 polymorphisms in 13 genes and assessed interaction with ionizing radiation exposure using likelihood ratio tests (LRT). Elevated thyroid nodule risks were associated with the minor alleles of RET S836S (rs1800862, P = 0.03) and GFRA1 -193C>G (rs not assigned, P = 0.05) and decreased risk with XRCC1 R194W (rs1799782, P trend = 0.03) and TGFB1 T263I (rs1800472, P = 0.009). Similar patterns of association were observed for a small number of papillary thyroid cancers (n = 25). Ionizing radiation exposure to the thyroid gland was associated with significantly increased risk of thyroid nodules (age and gender adjusted excess odds ratio/Gy = 0.30, 95% CI 0.05-0.56), with evidence for interaction by genotype found for XRCC1 R194W (LRT P value = 0.02). Polymorphisms in RET signaling, DNA repair and proliferation genes may be related to risk of thyroid nodules, consistent with some previous reports on thyroid cancer. Borderline support for gene-radiation interaction was found for a variant in XRCC1, a key base excision repair protein. Other pathways such as genes in double-strand break repair, apoptosis and genes related to proliferation should also be pursued.",

We have analysed ptc-1 and ptc-2 products by immunoprecipitation with specific anti-RET antibodies followed by immunoblotting with the same reagent or with antibodies specific for phosphotyrosine (P-tyr) residues. The anti-RET antibodies were reactive with 64-kDa (p64ptc-1) and 81-kDa (p81ptc-2) proteins from lysates of ptc-1 and ptc-2 transformed cells, respectively, and identified two proteins of 140 kDa and 160 kDa from extracts of SK-N-SH, a neuroblastoma cell line previously shown to express two differently glycosylated forms of the normal RET product. The anti P-tyr antibodies, while detecting the same p64ptc-1 and p81ptc-2 proteins from ptc-1 and ptc-2 extracts, did not show any specific band in the neuroblastoma lysates. An additional set of experiments led us to conclude that, whereas the normal product of the RET proto-oncogene is a membrane-associated receptor-like molecule not intrinsically phosphorylated on tyrosine, both oncogenic forms of RET, ptc-1 and ptc-2, are constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine, display an 'in vitro' autophosphorylation activity, are translocated from the membrane to the cytoplasm and are apparently unaffected by protein kinase C modulation.",

In order to analyze the genetic alterations that may cooperate with RET/PTC3 in the development or progression of thyroid tumors, we interbred Tg-RET/PTC3 mice with Tg-E7 transgenic mice, which express the E7 oncogene of the human papilloma virus 16 in thyroid cells. Tg-E7 mice develop large colloid goiters with small papillae and well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas in older animals. Here we show that thyroid lesions in Tg-RET/PTC3-Tg-E7 double transgenics were morphologically different from those occurring in Tg-RET/PTC3 mice, while they were virtually indistinguishable from those occurring in Tg-E7 mice. In addition, the coexpression of RET/PTC3 and E7 oncogenes neither enhanced the malignant phenotype nor reduced the latency period of thyroid lesions with respect to parental transgenic lines.

Mutational screening of RET revealed 9 different mutations, present in 26 of the 114 probands (22.8%). In addition, distributions of 8 RET polymorphisms and the haplotypes comprising them, were studied in the context of the families positive for RET mutational screening, in order to evaluate them as genetic modifiers.

The relationship between the presence of pheochromocytoma (PC) and/or hiperparathyroidism (HPT) in carriers of the same RET mutation, and the genotype for the specific variants was also studied.

Based on these observations, we hypothesized that SPP86 may be useful for studying the cellular activity of RET.;We compared the effects of SPP86 on RET-induced signaling and proliferation in thyroid cancer cell lines expressing RET-PTC1 (TPC1), or the activating mutations BRAFV600E (8505C) and RASG13R (C643). The effect of SPP86 on RET- induced phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)/Akt and MAPK pathway signaling and cell proliferation in MCF7 breast cancer cells was also investigated.;SPP86 inhibited MAPK signaling and proliferation in RET/PTC1 expressing TPC1 but not 8505C or C643 cells. In TPC1 cells, the inhibition of RET phosphorylation required co-exposure to SPP86 and the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor PF573228. In MCF7 cells, SPP86 inhibited RET- induced phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)/Akt and MAPK signaling and estrogen receptorα (ERα) phosphorylation, and inhibited proliferation to a similar degree as tamoxifen. Interestingly, SPP86 and PF573228 inhibited RET/PTC1 and GDNF- RET induced activation of Akt and MAPK signaling to a similar degree.;SPP86 selectively inhibits RET downstream signaling in RET/PTC1 but not BRAFV600E or RASG13R expressing cells, indicating that downstream kinases were not affected. SPP86 also inhibited RET signaling in MCF7 breast cancer cells. Additionally, RET- FAK crosstalk may play a key role in facilitating PTC1/RET and GDNF- RET induced activation of Akt and MAPK signaling in TPC1 and MCF7 cells.",

However, there are caveats associated with the use of the molecular approach in fine-needle aspiration (FNA), particularly for RET/PTC, that should be taken into consideration. It has been claimed that a clonal or sporadic presence of this abnormality in follicular cells can distinguish between malignant and benign nodules. Nevertheless, the most commonly used PCR-based techniques lack the capacity to quantify the number of abnormal cells. Because fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is the most sensitive method for detecting gene rearrangement in a single cell, we compared results from FISH and conventional RT-PCR obtained in FNA of a large cohort of consecutive patients with suspicious nodules and investigated the feasibility of setting a FISH-FNA threshold capable of distinguishing non-clonal from clonal molecular events. For this purpose, a home brew break-apart probe, able to recognize the physical breakage of RET, was designed. While a ≥3% FISH signal for broken RET was sufficient to distinguish nodules with abnormal follicular cells, only samples with a ≥6.8% break-apart FISH signal also exhibited positive RT-PCR results. On histological analysis, all nodules meeting the ≥6.8% threshold proved to be malignant. These data corroborate the power of FISH when compared with RT-PCR in quantifying the presence of RET/PTC in FNA and validate the RT-PCR efficiency in detecting clonal RET/PTC alterations. ",

Moreover, the chromosomal localization of the involved genes and the type of chromosomal change observed suggested that RET and NTRKI activation occurred by intrachromosomal rearrangements.

The UNSCEAR report concluded that no somatic disorders other than thyroid cancer were caused by radiation exposure due to the accident except for acute radiation sickness occurred to the people within the Power Plant at the time of the accident. A hypothesis is discussed in this paper that the increase of thyroid cancer was caused predominantly by the screening, overdiagnosis, and registration of nonirradiated persons as Chernobyl victims. A mechanism of thyroid cancer overdiagnosis is described that can be active even today, causing hypertherapy. Older neglected tumors found by the screening shortly after the Chernobyl accident or brought from noncontaminated areas were misclassified as aggressive radiation-induced cancers. Therefore, supposed markers of the radiation-induced thyroid cancer, such as the RET rearrangements, are probably associated with disease duration and tumor progression. The screening effect is obviously dependent on the basis level of medical surveillance: the higher the level, the smaller the screening effect. Absence of any significant increase of thyroid cancer after the Fukushima accident in spite of the vigorous screening would certify the high level of health care in Japan especially for children.",

To establish whether FIHP exists as a distinct disease entity or represents a variant of any of the known multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes, we tested 19 members of a large, well characterized family with FIHP in which the disease is transmitted through 4 generations in an autosomal dominant fashion. Fourteen DNA markers at 10 polymorphic loci closely linked to the MEN1 locus on the long arm of chromosome 11 and 5 markers close to the MEN2A gene on chromosome 10 were tested using Southern blot analysis and polymerase chain reaction-based techniques. Additionally, two polymorphic markers (Mir1 and Mir2) within the prepro-PTH gene on the short arm of chromosome 11 were analyzed using denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis. Linkage was clearly excluded between FIHP and the MEN1 and MEN2A loci as well as to the PTH gene. Comparison of constitutional and tumor genotypes showed that constitutional heterozygosity was retained for markers in the MEN1 and MEN2A regions as well as to the PTH gene in 4 tumors from 3 affected members. In 1 individual, a parathyroid carcinoma was found after recurrence of hypercalcemia.

HBME-1 and galectin-3 showed 92.8% and 89% sensitivity, respectively, and their coexpression was present in 36 out of 42 papillary carcinomas (85.7%) and absent in non-malignant lesions. Their association increased sensitivity to 94.7% and the diagnostic accuracy to 97.9% and involved the highest number of cases (95%) in comparison with two other panels including, respectively, three (HBME-1, galectin-3, CK19) and all four antibodies.;An immunohistochemical panel consisting of HBME-1 and galectin-3 can make a correct distinction between malignant and hyperfunctioning thyroid neoplasms with high diagnostic accuracy.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Surgery has been the treatment of choice for many disorders of the thyroid gland, both benign and malignant, for many decades. However, surgery has not been invariable but has continued to change in accordance with research results. In benign cases, surgery has generally evolved to be as organ preserving as possible. In several instances, however, a more radical extent of resection seems justified in order to ensure that the risk of recurrence is as low as possible. For instance, total thyroidectomy may be beneficial in patients with endemic multinodular goitre or young patients with Graves' disease and accompanying cold nodules or high levels of autoantibodies. Several tools, e.g. magnifying glasses, bipolar coagulation forceps and neuromonitoring, are available to identify and preserve the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the parathyroid glands, hence keeping the morbidity at a low level. Most recently, minimally invasive surgery has been successfully used in treating both benign and malignant disorders of the thyroid gland. In the case of malignant disorders, minimally invasive surgery may become an attractive alternative to open surgery if a limited surgical extent is justified, e.g. in patients with micro-PTC (papillary thyroid carcinoma, diameter less than 1 cm). Whether a limited surgical approach is also justified in other cases, e.g. in any patient with intrathyroidal PTC or patients with micro-FTC (follicular thyroid carcinoma), remains to be shown and is the subject of ongoing investigations. One of the most intriguing recent discoveries is the identification of genotype-phenotype correlations in patients with hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma. In these patients, the timing and extent of surgery may depend not only on the patient's age and serum levels of the tumour marker calcitonin but also on the specific germline RET proto-oncogene mutation. Surgery will certainly continue to play an important role in the treatment of thyroid diseases and may be increasingly based on individual findings instead of general recommendations.",

Analysis of these codons will provide a final diagnosis in the great majority of affected families making unnecessary further studies. To specifically study the codons 634 and 918 we used a minisequencing method as an alternative method to complete sequencing.;Using this mutation detection method we were able to reproduce in all cases, representative of 7 families, the information previously obtained by direct sequencing of PCR products. Depending on the number of primers used in the minisequencing reaction, we were able to interrogate either only one nucleotide of the target codon or the three nucleotides simultaneously.;This technique appears as a simple, rapid and efficient method for genetic screening of MEN 2 families.

Familial medullary thyroid cancer may occur in isolation or as part of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type II syndromes. Genetic testing for a RET mutation on chromosome 10 is used to identify new family members who are gene carriers. Total thyroidectomy should be used in gene carriers without clinical disease before age 6 in medullary thyroid cancer and MEN type IIA, and as soon as the diagnosis is made in MEN type IIB after the first year of life. Those with clinical disease should have at least a bilateral central neck dissection. Modified radical neck dissection is recommended for patients when the primary tumor is 1.5 cm. A normal postoperative serum calcitonin level suggests that the operation has been curative. Physicians need to be aware of ethical and lifestyle issues related to patients with familial disease and their family members. Familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer occurs as a discrete entity or as part of other family cancer syndromes such as Gardner syndrome, Cowden disease, and other rare syndromes. Familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer almost exclusively includes patients with papillary or Hurthle cell cancers. These families appear to have more benign thyroid conditions. The gene (or genes) for familial papillary thyroid cancer is yet to be identified, whereas that for some Hurthle cells (TCO) has been mapped to chromosome 19p13.2. Familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer is somewhat more aggressive than its sporadic counterpart, but is less aggressive than medullary thyroid cancer.

Similarly, BRAF mutations were positive only in PTC, but with a higher prevalence (24/43 positives, 55.8%). All but one BRAF mutation resulted in the prototypic substitution of valine 600 with a glutamic acid. In one case, a somatic in-frame insertion of three bases at codon 599 resulted in the insertion of an additional valine. RET/PTC expression and BRAF mutations were mutually exclusive. Screening of the RAS gene allowed identification of oncogenic mutations in 1/3 (33.3%) FA and 3/4 (75%) FTC. None of the PTCs was positive for RAS.;These data indicate that BRAF mutations are the most frequent genetic event in PTC and that RAS mutations, besides being a genetic hallmark of follicular tumours, are rare or completely absent in PTC from our area.

Ret expression is developmentally regulated and detectable only at very low levels in adult adrenal medulla. However, mutations of ret that cause constitutive activation or alter signal transduction give rise to adrenal medullary hyperplasia and pheochromocytomas in humans with hereditary multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes 2A and 2B and in animal models. These discordant observations pose the conundrum of how a molecule barely detectable in the adult adrenal can contribute to development of adrenal medullary pathology that typically occurs in adults. We recently reported that depolarization and phorbol esters that activate protein kinase C act synergistically with neurturin to up-regulate ret protein and mRNA expression in adult rat chromaffin cell cultures. Those findings suggested that ret expression in vivo is not static and might be regulated in part by neurally derived signals. We show here that the anti-hypertensive agent reserpine, which is known to cause a reflex increase in trans-synaptic stimulation of chromaffin cells, increases expression of ret mRNA and protein in adult rat adrenal medullary tissue in vivo. Elevated ret protein levels are detectable both by immunoblots and immunohistochemistry, which shows immunoreactive ret in chromaffin cells and neurons after reserpine administration. The finding that ret expression is subject to up-regulation by environmental signals in vivo suggests that epigenetic factors might influence the development of adrenal medullary disease by affecting the expression of ret. It is known that long-term administration of reserpine leads to the development of adrenal medullary hyperplasia and pheochromocytomas in rats. Our findings suggest potential utility of the rat model for studying the roles of ret in the adrenal medulla and the mechanisms of its involvement in MEN 2 and other pheochromocytoma syndromes.",

The most promising compound displays excellent switching properties and stability with good inhibitory effect towards RET in cell-free as well as live-cell assays and a significant difference in inhibitory activity between its two photoisomeric forms. As the first reported photoswitchable small-molecule kinase inhibitor, we consider the herein presented effector to be a significant step forward in the development of tools for kinase signal transduction studies with spatiotemporal control over inhibitor concentration in situ.

These mutations cause ligand-independent constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase receptor by the formation of disulfide-bonded homodimers. We examined a different type of mutation, which results in an additional cysteine in the cysteine rich domain. A duplication of 9 bp in the first case resulted in an insertion of three amino acids between codon 633 and 634. In the second case a 12 bp duplication in exon 11 results in four additional amino acids between codon 634 and 635.

Furthermore, the two common genetic alterations characteristic for PTC, the V600E mutation of the BRAF gene and RET/PTC 1 and 3 rearrangements, were determined in all HTTs. All miRNAs were significantly up-regulated in PTCs, whereas all miRNAs in HTT, normal thyroid tissue, adenomas, and MNGs were down-regulated. Calculating relative changes in gene expression, a 510-fold change of miRNA 146b between PTC and HTT could be observed followed by fold changes between 6.4 and 29 in the remaining miRNAs (P < 0.001).

As a model system, we selected human thyroid papillary cancer, in which the most common abnormalities, RET/papillary thyroid cancer rearrangements (fusion of RET kinase domain to the activating domains of other genes), were found in 40--45% of cases. We found that the mean expression levels of TR beta mRNA and TR alpha mRNA were significantly lower, whereas the protein levels of TR beta 1 and TR alpha 1 were higher in cancer tissues than in healthy thyroid. Sequencing of TR beta 1 and TR alpha 1 cDNAs, cloned from 16 papillary cancers, revealed that mutations affected receptor amino acid sequences in 93.75% and 62.5% of cases, respectively. In contrast, no mutations were found in healthy thyroid controls, and only 11.11% and 22.22% of thyroid adenomas had such TR beta 1 or TR alpha 1 mutations, respectively.

Excess relative risk is important, being 7.7 for 1 Gy delivered to the thyroid gland during childhood. The risk of thyroid tumours is modified by several factors: a) age at exposure: in childhood, the risk decreases with increasing age at exposure and is not significant after 20 years; b) gender: females are two times more likely than males to develop thyroid tumours; c) genetic predisposition due to a defect in DNA repair mechanisms, and dietary and hormonal factors may modify the risk; d) the influence of fractionation and dose rate is not well established. Radioiodine 131 (1311) used for medical purposes has almost no tumourigenic effect on the adult thyroid gland. The consequences of the Chernobyl accident have clearly shown that the risk of thyroid cancer after exposure to 1311 in childhood is important, and that such exposure should be prevented by potassium iodine prophylaxis. RET/PTC rearrangements are found in 60-80% of papillary carcinomas and in 45% of adenomas occurring after radiation exposure.

Previous studies suggested that the coiled-coil domain of CCDC6, mainly encoded by human exon 2, is required for the protein function. Therefore, we engineered a murine Ccdc6 construct, carrying a deletion of the exon 2, that was able to exert only a mild repression on CREB1 transcriptional activity, with respect to the wild type Ccdc6. Subsequently, we generated Ccdc6-ex2 knock-in mice. These mice developed thyroid hyperplasia associated with an enhanced CREB1 activity and an increased expression of the CREB-1 regulated genes.

The RET/PTC oncogene, an activated form of the RET proto-oncogene, is frequently observed in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC); RET/PTC1, -2 and -3 are known to be the three major forms. High frequencies of RET/PTC rearrangements have been observed in radiation-associated PTC, such as those appearing post-Chernobyl or post-radiotherapy, but the rearrangement types differ between these two populations. We investigated whether a specific type of RET/PTC rearrangement was induced by X-rays in vivo and in vitro. In human normal thyroid tissues transplanted in scid mice, the RET/PTC1 rearrangement was predominantly detected throughout the observation period (up to 60 days) after X-ray exposure of 50 Gy. On the other hand, RET/PTC3 was detected only 7 days after X-irradiation, and no transcript of RET/PTC2 was detected. These results are supported by the results of an in vitro study. The RET/PTC1 rearrangement was preferentially induced in a dose-dependent manner by X-rays within a high dose range (10, 50 and 100 Gy) in four cell lines. On the other hand, RET/PTC3 was induced at a much lower frequency, and no induction of RET/PTC2 was observed.

To explore this, we generated clonal lines derived from well-differentiated rat thyroid PCCL3 cells with doxycycline-inducible expression of either RET/PTC1 or RET/PTC3. As previously shown in other cell types, RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3 oligomerized and displayed constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. Neither RET/PTC1 nor RET/PTC3 conferred cells with the ability to grow in the absence of TSH, likely because of concomitant stimulation of both DNA synthesis and apoptosis, resulting in no net growth in the cell population. Effects of RET/PTC on DNA synthesis and apoptosis did not require direct interaction of the oncoprotein with either Shc or phospholipase Cgamma. Acute expression of the oncoprotein decreased TSH-mediated growth stimulation due to interference of TSH signaling by RET/PTC at multiple levels. Taken together, these data indicate that RET/PTC is a weak tumor-initiating event and that TSH action is disrupted by this oncoprotein at several points, and also predict that secondary genetic or epigenetic changes are required for clonal expansion.",

This review identifies contributions that have changed approaches to diagnosis and broadened treatment options for patients with hereditary medullary and nonmedullary thyroid cancers related to multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), Cowden syndrome, and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).;A new risk-stratification scheme based on type of RET gene mutation informs the age at which prophylactic thyroidectomy and diagnostic screening for MEN-associated endocrine diseases should occur. Two new US Food and Drug Administration-approved targeted medical therapies are now available for medullary thyroid cancer. There is better understanding of more aggressive clinical features and increased lifetime cancer risks for patients with well differentiated thyroid cancers as part of families with and without Cowden syndrome or FAP. This has led to a clearer appreciation for the role and timing of thyroid ultrasound screening in these populations. It has also informed the appropriate extent of thyroid surgery and the circumstances in which prophylactic thyroidectomy is reasonable to consider as part of hereditary syndromes other than MEN2.;Recognition and early diagnosis of these syndromes allows for comprehensive medical care and may improve thyroid cancer-related outcomes. Ultrasound-based screening programs to detect thyroid disease are advised for patients and family members with hereditary cancer syndromes.",

Oncocytic thyroid cells are characterized by a prominent eosinophilia (or oxyphilia) caused by mitochondrial abundance. Although disruptive mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are the most significant hallmark of such tumors, oncocytomas may be envisioned as heterogeneous neoplasms, characterized by multiple nuclear and mitochondrial gene lesions. We investigated the nuclear mutational profile of oncocytic tumors to pinpoint the mutations that may trigger the early oncogenic hit.;Total DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded tissues from 45 biopsies of oncocytic tumors. High-resolution melting was used for mutation screening of mitochondrial complex I subunits genes. Specific nuclear rearrangements were investigated by RT-PCR (RET/PTC) or on isolated nuclei by interphase FISH (PAX8/PPARγ). Recurrent point mutations were analyzed by direct sequencing.;In our oncocytic tumor samples, we identified rare TP53 mutations. The series of analyzed cases did not include poorly- or undifferentiated thyroid carcinomas, and none of the TP53 mutated cases had significant mitotic activity or high-grade features. Thus, the presence of disruptive TP53 mutations was completely unexpected. In addition, novel mutations in nuclear-encoded complex I genes were identified.;These findings suggest that nuclear genetic lesions altering the bioenergetics competence of thyroid cells may give rise to an aberrant mitochondria-centered compensatory mechanism and ultimately to the oncocytic phenotype.",

        "Doc_abstract":"In the last 10 years, evidence has accumulated that overexpression of Met protein is a distinguishing feature of almost every case of well-differentiated papillary carcinoma. Increased expression of the protein is probably due to enhanced transcription of the MET gene and/or to post-transcriptional mechanisms. So far, alterations of the MET gene have not been recognized, but evidence has been provided that activated RAS and RET can cause accumulation of MET RNA. Thus, the possibility exists that dysregulation of MET is the final result of different molecular pathways capable of inducing thyroid cell transformation; RET rearrangements might account for some of the cases, but the demonstration that the majority of papillary carcinomas do not have recognized alterations of the RET gene strongly suggests that MET gene dysregulation can also be achieved through other molecular pathways. Dysregulation of MET causes marked accumulation of Met protein in tumour cells that is promptly detected by immunohistochemistry. Thus, overexpression of Met protein might represent an immunohistochemical marker of papillary carcinoma, potentially helpful in problematic cases, but caution is required; moderate expression of Met protein is observed in non-neoplastic thyroid diseases, such as Graves' and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and reagents active on paraffin sections may have a low affinity and/or low specificity for Met protein, leading to artifactual staining. Met protein-positive papillary carcinoma cells may produce hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and may activate HGF through the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) bound to urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPA-R). Thus, papillary carcinoma cells possess the molecular machinery necessary for a productive HGF/Met interaction. In vitro studies have demonstrated that HGF enhances the motility and invasiveness of tumour cells and induces the synthesis and release of chemokines active in the recruitment of dendritic cells. These observations provide a rational basis for the understanding of two distinguishing features of papillary carcinoma. First, the tumour is often characterized by early metastatic spread to regional lymph nodes and by multifocal involvement of the gland, which suggests highly invasive behaviour. Second, a prominent peritumoural inflammatory reaction is often observed, which suggests cross-talk between tumour cells and the immune system.",

The criteria for classification included predominantly (>70%) solid growth pattern of primary tumor, retention of cytologic features typical of papillary carcinoma, and absence of tumor necrosis. For each case of the solid variant, a control case of classical papillary carcinoma matched by age, sex, tumor size, and length of follow-up was selected. The follow-up ranged from 6 to 32 years. Two patients with the solid variant of papillary carcinoma (10%) died from disease 7 and 10 years after initial surgery, while another two patients (10%) are alive with lung metastases. In contrast, the control group had no cases with distant metastases or death from disease. Molecular analyses showed a similar prevalence of RET /PTC rearrangements in both groups. In conclusion, the solid variant of papillary carcinoma is associated with a slightly higher frequency of distant metastases and less favorable prognosis than classical papillary carcinoma.

It has been shown that RET/PTC1 decreases expression of the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS), the molecule that mediates radioiodide therapy for thyroid cancer. Using proteomic analysis, we identify hsp90 and its co-chaperone p50cdc37 as novel proteins associated with RET/PTC1. Inhibition of hsp90 function with 17-allylamino-17-demothoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) reduces RET/PTC1 protein levels. Furthermore, 17-AAG increases radioiodide accumulation in thyroid cells, mediated in part through a protein kinase A-independent mechanism. We show that 17-AAG does not increase the total amount of NIS protein or cell surface NIS localization. Instead, 17-AAG increases radioiodide accumulation by decreasing iodide efflux. Finally, the ability of 17-AAG to increase radioiodide accumulation is not restricted to thyroid cells expressing RET/PTC1. These findings suggest that 17-AAG may be useful as a chemotherapeutic agent, not only to inhibit proliferation but also to increase the efficacy of radioiodide therapy in patients with thyroid cancer.",

The multistage complex theory of thyroid carcinogenesis is based on observations made on cohort patients studies and during animal experiments over a period of last fifty years. The process of thyroid oncogenesis is conceived to be a series of events induced by genetic and environmental factors which alter follicular cells division and growth control. These factors can be considered as initiators (chemical agents and ionising radiation) and promoters (some goitrogenes and drugs). The first class of factors induce incipient tumorigenesis while the second augments TSH secretion and radically increases tumour growth. Normally silent, intracellular proto-oncogenes (of which Ret/PTC series are the most conceived ones) can become activated by chromosomal translocations, deletions or mutations and can transform normal follicular cell into a condition of uncontrolled division and growth. The most significant known cause of thyroid carcinomas in men is exposure to external or internal ionising radiation. Beside that, long-term iodine deficiency, effects of certain chemical carcinogens, drugs and goitrogenes must be considered as significant risk factors.

Consequently, isthmus-preserving total bilateral lobectomy (IPTB) may be regarded as an adequate surgical procedure for C-cell hyperplasia (CCH).;IPTB was performed from October 2001 to December 2004 in 64 patients, 59 patients with nodular goiter and slightly to moderately elevated serum calcitonin (stimulated under 500 pg/ml) (group A, apparently sporadic cases) and in 5 patients undergoing prophylactic surgery for hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) with intermediate- or low-risk RET mutations (non-634) (group B). The surgical procedure focused on meticulous total extracapsular resection of both thyroid lobes, preservation of an isthmus remnant of about 3 ml (smaller in children), and histologic workup of the border zones of resection in addition to that of the completely removed lobes. When malignancy could be proven intraoperatively (7 patients) or when the isthmus turned out to contain nodular lesions (4 patients), completion total thyroidectomy (plus lymphadenectomy) was performed as a one-stage procedure. Second-stage total thyroidectomy was performed in 3 cases. Thus, IPTB was the definitive surgical procedure in 50 patients (45 of group A and all 5 of group B).;In all of the 50 definite IPTB cases, postoperative serum calcitonin was below the measurable limit (2 pg/ml); stimulated calcitonin was below the measurable limit in 47 (including all of group B) and was measurable in 3 sporadic cases in a lower-normal range between 2.4 and 3.5 pg/ml. Genetic screening of the apparently sporadic cases with CCH was positive in one (codon 791). The risk of recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis seems not to be elevated (0% permanent); permanent hypocalcemia occurred in 1 patient (2%). Follow-up data of 37 patients, median 18 (6-36) months, showed continuously nonmeasurable serum calcitonin with one exception, where it was in the normal range after 18 months. All IPTB patients are still under substitution therapy with L-thyroxine (median 125 mug/day) with decreasing tendency in all 3 children after prophylactic operation, the latter also showing an increasing volume of well-vascularized isthmi (from 1.5 to 2.5 ml).;IPTB reliably removes all C cells. There may not be need for total thyroidectomy (TTx) in cases with CCH. When necessary, completion TTx can be performed easily without additional risk. IPTB leaves a functionally relevant remnant, corresponding to that of a subtotal resection. This might be of importance especially for prophylactic surgery in children where the isthmus can compensate for the loss of thyroid function with time.",

The possibility of using inhibitors on the BRAF pathway as became an interesting therapeutic approach. In thyroid cancer cells the target molecules, implicated on the cellular effects, mediated by inhibition of BRAF are not well established. In order to fill this lack of knowledge we studied the proliferation and survival pathways and associated molecules induced by BRAF inhibition in thyroid carcinoma cell lines harbouring distinct genetic backgrounds.;Suppression of BRAF pathway in thyroid cancer cell lines (8505C, TPC1 and C643) was achieved using RNA interference (RNAi) for BRAF and the kinase inhibitor, sorafenib. Proliferation analysis was performed by BrdU incorporation and apoptosis was accessed by TUNEL assay. Levels of protein expression were analysed by western-blot.;Both BRAF RNAi and sorafenib inhibited proliferation in all the cell lines independently of the genetic background, mostly in cells with BRAF(V600E) mutation. In BRAF(V600E) mutated cells inhibition of BRAF pathway lead to a decrease in ERK1/2 phosphorylation and cyclin D1 levels and an increase in p27(Kip1). Specific inhibition of BRAF by RNAi in cells with BRAF(V600E) mutation had no effect on apoptosis. In the case of sorafenib treatment, cells harbouring BRAF(V600E) mutation showed increase levels of apoptosis due to a balance of the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-2.;Our results in thyroid cancer cells, namely those harbouring BRAF(V600E) mutation showed that BRAF signalling pathway provides important proliferation signals. We have shown that in thyroid cancer cells sorafenib induces apoptosis by affecting Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 in BRAF(V600E) mutated cells which was independent of BRAF. These results suggest that sorafenib may prove useful in the treatment of thyroid carcinomas, particularly those refractory to conventional treatment and harbouring BRAF mutations.",

We examined 13 cases of struma ovarii to determine if these lesions can exhibit histological, immunohistochemical, and/or molecular features of follicular variant PTC. Ten of these had atypical histology, cytologic features of PTC, and all ten showed diffuse positivity for CK19; eight of these were also positive for HMBE-1. Mutational analysis for BRAF identified no V600E mutations. However, seven of the ten cases with features of follicular variant PTC exhibited a rearranged in transformation (RET)/PTC rearrangement by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The three cases considered to be benign based on histologic and cytologic criteria were negative for CK19 and HBME-1 by immunohistochemistry, and had no evidence of BRAF mutation or ret/PTC-1 and ret/PTC-3 rearrangements. These results indicate that follicular variant PTC can occur in struma ovarii and that such lesions exhibit the same morphologic and immunohistochemical profile as follicular variant PTC in thyroid. The application of molecular testing to verify the diagnosis can be valuable, as these lesions may harbor ret/PTC gene rearrangements.",

HCC cell lines MHCC97L and Huh7 were transfected with lentiviral vector of miR-218 mimics. The effect of miR-218 overexpression on cancer cell growth, both in vitro and in vivo, as well as cancer cell invasion was examined. A bioinformatic method was used to predict the binding of miR-218 to RET proto-oncogene (RET). Small interfering RNA (SiRNA)-mediated genetic knock-down of RET was performed in MHCC97L and Huh7 cells, and its modulatory effect on miR-218-mediated HCC development was examined. miR-218 was found to be downregulated in HCC cell lines and primary HCC tissues. Overexpression of miR-218 in MHCC97L or Huh7 cells resulted in significant decrease in cell proliferation and invasion capability. Overexpression of miR-218 also reduced the tumor growth of xenografted Huh7 cells in vivo. The expression of endogenous RET was found to be upregulated by miR-218, and siRNA-induced RET downregulation resulted in phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) upregulation and reversal of the inhibitory effect of miR-218 upregulation on HCC proliferation. Our results indicate that miR-218 modulates HCC development, and this effect may be through RET and PTEN. ",

Posttreatment surveillance included iodine-123-metaiodobenzylguanidine scans and CT scans. Fine-needle aspiration of the thyroid nodule diagnosed a follicular neoplasm, which was negative for BRAF, NRAS, KRAS, HRAS, PAX8/PPARg, and RET/PTC mutations, without evidence of metastatic NB. Nodule histology demonstrated an encapsulated follicular variant of PTC (FVPTC). Next-generation sequence analysis for a 46 cancer-gene profile was performed on both tumors with subsequent peripheral blood DNA testing. A heterozygous missense mutation in STK11 (F354L) was identified in both the NB and FVPTC. This mutation was also detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Two additional heterozygous somatic missense mutations of uncertain significance were identified: KDR/VEGF receptor 2 (Q472H) on chromosome 4 and MET (N375S) on chromosome 7. To our knowledge, this is the shortest reported duration from completion of NB treatment to detection of thyroid cancer.

Because the role of TrkA was not completely elucidated in thyroid cancer ethiopathogenesis, we decided to study the expression of active, phosphorylated TrkA and of its coreceptor p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75 NTR) in a series of 92 PTC (37 lesions of conventional PTC, 28 of follicular variant of PTC [FVPTC], and 27 of other variants of PTC) as well as in 21 samples of normal thyroid and nonneoplastic thyroid lesions used as a controls. We observed neoexpression of p75 NTR in PTC, particularly in conventional PTC and in other variants of PTC displaying a papillary growth pattern, rather than in FVPTC. No immunoexpression of p75 NTR was observed in normal thyroid nor in nonneoplastic thyroid lesions. The cellular localization of p75 NTR immunoexpression was also significantly associated with the growth pattern of PTC, being much more frequently detected in an apical localization in PTC with papillary architecture than in PTC with a follicular or solid growth pattern. This apical localization of p75 NTR was significantly associated with the presence of BRAF V600E.

Therefore, development and evaluation of novel treatment strategies, including gene therapy, are urgently needed. A variety of gene therapy approaches have been evaluated for the treatment of follicular cell-derived and medullary thyroid cancer, including corrective gene therapy (p53 restoration, expression of a dominant negative RET mutant), cytoreductive gene therapy (suicide gene/prodrug strategy herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase [HSV-tk]/ganciclovir, antiangiogenic therapy with endostatin) and immunomodulatory gene therapy (expression of interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-12). Furthermore, cloning of the sodium iodide symporter (NIS) gene has paved the way for the development of a novel cytoreductive gene therapy strategy based on NIS gene transfer followed by the application of radioiodine therapy ((131)I). NIS gene delivery into medullary and follicular cell-derived thyroid cancer cells has been shown to be capable of establishing or restoring radioiodine accumulation and might therefore represent an effective therapy for medullary and dedifferentiated thyroid tumors that lack iodide accumulating activity. The data summarized in this review article clearly demonstrate that the currently available strategies represent potentially curative novel therapeutic approaches for future gene therapy of thyroid cancer. The combination of different therapeutic genes has been demonstrated to be very useful to enhance therapeutic efficacy and seems to have a promising role at least as part of a multimodality approach for advanced thyroid cancer.",

        "Doc_abstract":"A high prevalence of the activating BRAF mutation, BRAF(T1796A), is observed in adult papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs). The prognosis of childhood PTCs is generally fairly good despite the fact that distant metastases are often documented in these cases. To investigate the differences between the characteristics of childhood and adult PTCs, we analyzed both BRAF(T1796A) and RAS mutations in 31 Japanese and 48 post-Chernobyl Ukrainian thyroid carcinomas. In the 31 Japanese childhood cases, BRAF(T1796A) was found in only one instance (3.2%), and no RAS mutations were detected. In the Ukrainian subjects, of the 15 childhood and the 33 adolescent and young adult PTCs examined, the BRAF(T1796A) mutation was found in zero and eight cases, respectively, and RAS mutations were found in two of the young adult cases. In addition, 17 of the 48 Ukrainian cases showed expression of the RET tyrosine kinase region, indicating the existence of RET/PTC rearrangements. Unlike adult PTCs, we could detect no positive association between BRAF(T1796A) mutations and clinical parameters in the childhood carcinomas, suggesting that a low prevalence of BRAF(T1796A) is a common feature of PTCs in children regardless of radiation exposure levels. The differences in the prevalence of BRAF(T1796A) mutations between childhood and adult cases of PTC may well reflect inherent differences in the clinical features of these cancers between the two age groups.",

The post-Chernobyl tumors showed chromosomal imbalances in 30% of tumors. The most frequent DNA copy number changes in post-Chernobyl tumors involved chromosomes 2, 7q11.2-21, 13q21-22, 21 (DNA gains), and chromosomes 16p/q, 20q, 22q (DNA losses). Some of these specific alterations detected in post-Chernobyl thyroid tumors (deletions on chromosomes 16p/q and 22q) have previously been reported in thyroid tumors as associated with an aggressive biologic behavior and may therefore also account for the more aggressive phenotype of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) found in post- Chernobyl tumors. Eighteen percent of post-Chernobyl PTC that exhibit RET rearrangements also showed chromosomal imbalances indicating that either additional genetic events are involved in this subset of tumors, or that intratumoral genetic heterogeneity exists in these tumors, suggesting a oligoclonal pattern to tumor development.",

In cases of MEN 2B, when the mutation is carried in codons 883, 918 or 922, prophylactic thyroidectomy is performed prior to 6 months of age, due to the increased aggressiveness of these heterozygosities, which are capable of determining the onset of medullary cancer during the first months of life. We present two heterozygous twin patients with MEN 2B syndrome who were born 32 weeks premature, and who underwent prophylactic thyroidectomy at 7 months of age. The patients were carriers of the mutation at codon 918. We suggested the early surgery at 7 months as, due to their prematurity, the patients were required to gain weight to improve their condition prior to surgery.

        "Doc_abstract":"Oxyphil or Hurthle cell tumours of the thyroid are characterised by their consistent excessive number of mitochondria. A recently discovered gene, GRIM-19 has been found to fulfil two roles within the cell: as a member of the interferon-beta and retinoic acid-induced pathway of cell death, and as part of the mitochondrial Complex I assembly. In addition, a gene predisposing to thyroid tumours with cell oxyphilia (TCO) has been mapped to chromosome 19p13.2 in one family. A cluster of genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism occurs in this region; one of these is GRIM-19. We have searched for GRIM-19 mutations in a series of 52 thyroid tumours. Somatic missense mutations in GRIM-19 were detected in three of 20 sporadic Hurthle cell carcinomas. A germline mutation was detected in a Hurthle cell papillary carcinoma arising in a thyroid with multiple Hurthle cell nodules. No mutations were detected in any of the 20 non-Hurthle cell carcinomas tested, nor in any of 96 blood donor samples. In one of the sporadic Hurthle cell papillary carcinomas positive for GRIM-19 mutation, we have also detected a ret/PTC-1 rearrangement. No GRIM-19 mutations were detected in any of the six cases of known familial Hurthle cell tumour tested, so that our results do not support the identification of GRIM-19 as the TCO gene. The GRIM-19 mutations we have detected are the first nuclear gene mutations specific to Hurthle cell tumours to be reported to date; we propose that such mutations can be involved in the genesis of sporadic or familial Hurthle cell tumours through the dual function of GRIM-19 in mitochondrial metabolism and cell death.",

Drawing on 38 medullary thyroid cancer patients harboring germ-line mutations in codon 620 (n=8), 618 (n=19), 611 (n=10), and 609 (n=1), this study aimed to test the hypothesis that closer proximity of RET germ-line mutations in exon 10 to the cell membrane may translate into earlier or more advanced disease. The closer mutations in codon 620, 618, and 611 were located to the transmembrane domain (codons 657-636) of the RET receptor, the greater were mean primary tumor diameters (23.5, 18.7, and 7.5 mm, P=0.020), the frequency of lymph node metastasis (75, 68, and 30%, P=0.11) and pheochromocytoma (38, 16, and 0%, P=0.11). Periods of observation were broadly comparable for these groups (mean age 33.4-39.3 years; P=0.71). When mutations in adjoining codons were collapsed (codons 620/618 vs 611/609), the differences in mean primary tumor diameter (20.1 vs 7.4 mm, P=0.005) and lymph node metastasis (70 vs 36%; P=0.07) were accentuated. Compared with 80 carriers of exon 11 mutations (codon 634, n=78; codon 630, n=2), the 38 carriers of exon 10 mutations, which are rarer and confer a weaker transforming activity in vitro than exon 11 mutations, required significantly more time to develop fewer tumors. Although limited in numbers, these data suggested that membrane proximity is an important determinant of tumor development in carriers of RET mutations in exon 10.",

Both mutations are able to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) signaling transduction pathway leading to cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. PD0325901 is a specific MEK1/2 inhibitor and therefore is a promising drug to treat thyroid cancers with either RET/PTC or BRAF mutation. In this study we tested the effects of PD0325901 on PTC cells harboring either mutation in vitro by growth curves and Western blots and in vivo using a murine orthotopic xenograft model. We found that 50% growth inhibition (GI(50)) by PD0325901 was 11 nmol/L for the PTC cells with the RET/PTC1 rearrangement and 6.3 nmol/L for PTC cells with a BRAF mutation, with both concentrations readily achievable in serum. After 1 week of oral administration of PD0325901 (20-25 mg/kg/day) in mice, no tumor growth was detected in mice inoculated with PTC cells bearing a BRAF mutation. For PTC with the RET/PTC1 rearrangement, the average tumor volume of the orthotopic tumor was reduced by 58% as compared with controls. In conclusion, our data suggested that PTC cells carrying a BRAF mutation were more sensitive to PD0325901 than were PTC cells carrying the RET/PTC1 rearrangement. Our findings support the clinical evaluation of PD0325901 for patients with PTC and potentially other carcinomas with BRAF mutations.",

These subjects had been treated for either sporadic or familial or were at risk for medullary thyroid carcinoma. All patients had previously attended genetic counselling with detection of germline Ret-mutations, were informed on their own genetic risk, had good short-term prognosis and performance status and did not receive recent cancer treatment. Each patient was invited to answer two questionnaires, the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) and the subjective quality of life profile (SQLP).;We report herein the descriptive results of this study (HADS and SQLP scores and distributions) and describe the individual clinical covariates that might explain the observed differences between subgroups of individuals. Although psychometric scores appeared similar in these subgroups, quality of life scores were lower in Ret-mutation carriers. Genetically-predisposed patients were less satisfied and expressed more expectations for favourable change in their quality of life.;This finding suggests a high level of frustration and latent unsatisfaction related either to the management of the genetic information given by the clinicians and its psychosocial consequences or simply to the knowledge of the genetic risk of cancer.

We aimed at investigating the impact of point mutations and rearrangement detection in a set of routine air-dried FNA smears with a higher percentage of FTCs.;RNA and DNA was extracted from 310 FNAs (164 indeterminate, 57 malignant, 89 benign) and corresponding formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (156 follicular adenomas [FAs], 32 FTCs, 44 papillary thyroid carcinomas [PTCs], 9 follicular variant PTCs, and 69 goiters).

While the presence of a BRAF and RET/PTC mutation was associated with cancer in 100% of samples each, the presence of a RAS and PAX8/PPARG mutation was associated with cancer in only 12% and 50% of samples, respectively. In the indeterminate group 4 of 25 carcinomas were identified by molecular FNA screening, which increased the sensitivity from 67% (cytology alone) to 75% (cytology plus molecular screening).;Molecular screening for point mutations and rearrangements is feasible in air-dried FNAs. Although the impact of detecting point mutations and rearrangements in FNAs has most likely been overestimated in previous studies, molecular FNA analyses improve presurgical diagnostics. The detection of BRAF mutations in FNA may improve the choice of surgery and postsurgical treatment. Further data are necessary to elucidate the true impact of detecting RAS and PAX8/PPARG mutations in FNAs.

Intraoperative frozen section and a final pathology revealed that the cyst from the left ovary was composed of mature teratomatous elements, normal thyroid tissue (>50%) and a non-encapsulated focus of follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC).Normal and cancerous thyroid tissues were tested for BRAF and RAS mutations by direct sequencing, and for RET/PTC rearrangements by RT-PCR/Southern blotting. A KRAS codon 12 mutation, the GGT → GTT transversion, corresponding to the Gly → Val amino acid change was identified in the absence of other genetic alterations commonly found in PTC.;To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this mutation is described in a papillary thyroid carcinoma arising in struma in the ovarii. This finding provides further evidence that even rare mutations specific for PTC may occur in such tumors. Molecular testing may be a useful adjunct to common differential diagnostic methods of thyroid malignancy in SO.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) receptor, encoded by the protooncogene c-met, is overexpressed in many human tumours, including those of thyroid epithelium. The absence in most cases of any primary structural abnormality of the met gene suggests that overexpression is secondary to mutation of other gene(s). To test this hypothesis we investigated the effect on met expression of two activated oncogenes known to play a major role in thyroid oncogenesis, ras and ret. To minimize the possibility of unknown co-operating events, we introduced these genes directly into normal human thyrocytes in primary culture using amphotropic retroviral vectors and assessed met expression as early as possible in the resulting epithelial colonies. Double immunofluorescence revealed expression of met protein, strictly localized to cells expressing the mutant ras and ret vectors, expression in background normal cells being barely detectable. In contrast, colonies induced to proliferate at a comparable rate by a vector expressing SV40 T showed no increase in met expression. To permit quantitation by Western blotting we also extended these findings to a thyroid cell line (R18) containing a zinc-inducible mutant ras gene. Induction of the oncogene led to a fourfold increase in met protein expression. We conclude that overexpression of met is induced by activation of the ras or ret signalling pathway and not simply by deregulation of the cell cycle per se. The data suggest that the proliferative advantage conferred by these oncogenes may be in part due to the resulting sensitization of tumour epithelium to paracrine HGF secreted by stromal cells.",

We were recently confronted in Belgium over a short period with four patients (3 F, 1 M) with papillary thyroid carcinoma who were aged 10 years, 2 months, 2 years and 6 years when the Chernobyl accident occurred. We thus raise the question of a possible relationship. The patients were aged 17, 11, 10, 19 years at presentation. They all presented fortuitously over 3 years which was a very unusual increase in our extensive experience in thyroid surgery (62 cases of thyroid cancer among 1014 thyroidectomies in adults vs 4 cases in 18 children since the Chernobyl accident in 1986). Two out of the four patients had psammoma bodies (identifiable on CT scanning and ultrasound) and thyroglobulin autoantibodies (TgAb). The first patient had positive lymph nodes at the time of surgery. The incidence of thyroid cancers in Belarus and Ukraine rose just 4 years after the Chernobyl disaster; because radioactive clouds passed over Belgium, we wonder whether the occurrence of thyroid cancer in our patients could be related to this irradiation. The mechanism of increased incidence of radiation-induced thyroid cancer is thought to be due to rearrangement of the tyrosine kinase domains of the RET and TTK genes. The other important similarities in our patients are the presence of psammoma bodies that can be visualized on radiological examination and the presence of TgAb that are more frequent in differentiated thyroid cancers. Whether or not these cases reflect an increased incidence in the population as a whole, clinicians must remain vigilant for this rare but curable cancer in young patients, especially if suggestive radiological features or TgAb are present.",

No KRAS, RET/PTC, or PAX8/PPARgamma genetic alteration was detected.

        "Doc_abstract":"Over the last decade it has become possible to investigate the molecular basis of functional and neoplastic thyroid diseases, leading to the elucidation of various genetic defects at the level of the pituitary, thyroid and target organs. Mutations in either the pituitary-specific transcription factor Pit-1 or its target gene, TSH beta, lead to rare forms of hereditary congenital hypothyroidism. However, somatic mutations in thyroid epithelial cells causing an increase in hormone production and/or cellular proliferation are much more frequent. Nearly 50% of all toxic adenomas were shown to harbour activating mutations in either the TSH-receptor or certain G-proteins. In contrast, follicular and papillary thyroid malignancies are associated with mutations in the ras and ret genes respectively. Intriguingly, different mutations and rearrangements in the ret gene were shown to cause medullary thyroid cancer and MEN2 as well as to be specifically associated with papillary thyroid cancer. In contrast, mutations in thyroid-specific genes, such as thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin, causing congenital hypothyroidism are extremely rare. Besides the molecular abnormalities at the pituitary and thyroidal level leading to altered hormone secretion, genetic defects impairing thyroid hormone action at the target level also occur. Specifically, mutations in one of the thyroid hormone receptor genes (the proto-oncogene c-erbA beta) were shown to cause the autosomal dominant syndrome of resistance to thyroid hormone. The quest for a better understanding of the molecular defects in the pituitary-thyroid axis has led to the cloning of some of the key proteins, which can now be used for diagnostic purposes in vivo and in vitro. The use of recombinant thyroid peroxidase and TSH-receptor proteins has made possible the development of more sensitive and specific in vitro assays for autoantibodies. In addition, recombinant TSH was recently shown to be effective in stimulating radioiodine uptake in patients with residual differentiated thyroid cancer who remained on suppressive thyroid hormone therapy. Recombinant human TSH may therefore become a convenient diagnostic tool in the follow-up of patients with thyroid cancer by allowing for thyroglobulin measurements and radioiodine scanning without the need for the patient to become hypothyroid.",

The mean age at exposure of patients with PTC showing BRAF mutation was higher than that of patients with tumors without BRAF mutation irrespective of their RET status.

Thyroid cancer is one of the fastest growing cancer diagnoses worldwide. It is 2.9-times more common in women than men. The less aggressive histologic subtypes of thyroid cancer are more common in women, whereas the more aggressive histologic subtypes have similar gender distribution. The gender disparity in incidence, aggressiveness and prognosis is well established for thyroid cancer but the cause of the disparity is poorly understood. The aim of this article is to evaluate the current evidence on the cause of thyroid cancer gender disparity. Dietary and environmental factors do not appear to have a significant role in thyroid cancer gender disparity. Common somatic mutations in BRAF, rearranged in transformation/papillary thyroid carcinomas (RET/PTC) and neurotrophin receptor-tyrosine kinase (NTRK) also do not account for the gender disparity in thyroid cancer. While reproductive factors would seem a logical hypothesis to account for the gender disparity, there appears to be no conclusive effect on the risk of developing thyroid cancer. Recent studies on estrogen receptor status in thyroid cancer show a difference in the receptor subtypes expressed based on the histology of thyroid cancer. Moreover, the response to estrogen is dependent on the specific estrogen receptor expressed in thyroid cancer cells. However, what determines the tumor-specific sex hormone receptor expression is unclear. No established molecular factors appear to explain gender differences in thyroid cancer. Therefore, the application of high-throughput genomic and proteomic approaches to the study of thyroid cancer gender disparity could be helpful for better understanding the molecular basis for gender differences in thyroid and other cancers.",

In thyroid tissue the NT-3 mRNA level was threefold lower and the NT-4 mRNA level sixfold higher than those detected in adult rat hippocampus, while BDNF mRNA was undetectable. Very low levels of mRNA for truncated trkB and trkC receptors and no catalytic trkA, trkB or trkC were found. In conclusion NT-3 and NT-4, but not the corresponding functional receptors, are expressed in the thyroid tissue. Therefore, it is unlikely that these factors serve a direct local autocrine or paracrine function in thyroid cell types, and a target-derived mode of action on neurons innervating the thyroid tissue is suggested. An opposite result has been found for the neurotrophic factor GDNF: thyroid tissue showed a high level of transcripts for the GDNF receptor subunits (GDNFR-alpha and Ret), while GDNF mRNA was undetectable. The in situ hybridization analysis of GDNFR-alpha and ret mRNA revealed an interesting difference in the cell distribution of these transcripts: ret mRNA is selectively expressed in a subpopulation of cells scattered in the follicular epithelium and in the interfollicular spaces, while GDNFR-alpha expression is more homogeneous and widespread, including the more abundant cell type of the thyroid gland: the follicular cell. Double-labeling in situ hybridization/immunocytochemistry experiments, with a specific marker (calcitonin), showed that parafollicular cells express ret but not GDNFR-alpha.

To evaluate the predictive and prognostic functions of RET in ccRCC, a tissue microarray study was conducted on 273 ccRCC patients. Results showed that both RET cytoplasmic and nuclear expression were independently associated with PFS and OS, and the combined RET cytoplasmic and nuclear statuses demonstrated that the ratio of high nuclear RET and cytoplasmic RET was the strongest predictor of both PFS and OS. The high cytoplasmic RET expression retained its independent poor prognostic value in targeted drug treated patients. The RET nuclear expression was associated with distant metastasis.

A consistent proportion of PTC is characterized by chromosome rearrangements producing RET and TRK oncogenes, but the mechanisms underlying the thyrocyte propensity to such alterations are poorly understood. Diminished capacity of thyrocytes to repair radiation-induced DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) might play a role in chromosome rearrangements; however, this question has not been fully addressed due to the lack of physiologically relevant experimental models.;Several normal human thyroid primary cultures were produced and characterized for their capacity to repair the DNA DSBs induced by ionizing radiation. For comparison, normal human bronchial epithelial cells were used. We employed the gammaH2AX foci assay; counts were determined at different time points after irradiation.;All the thyrocyte samples analyzed showed similar DNA DSBs induction. The rate of gammaH2AX foci clearance was homogenous, showing only small differences among samples.;This work reports the first characterization of DNA DSB repair in human primary thyrocytes, a relevant clinical model for thyroid carcinogenesis, and represents an important step toward dissection of the link between DNA DSB repair and thyroid-specific oncogenic rearrangements.",

For the rare aggressive endocrine cancers that are widely metastatic or rapidly progressive, however, the role of the medical oncologist becomes more important. To date, conventional chemotherapy has not had a significant impact on the natural history of these malignancies. This has led to the evaluation of novel compounds; some of which have already entered into randomized clinical trials. This review will focus on the advances made in the treatment of advanced thyroid cancer, the commonest of endocrine malignancies.;A growing understanding of molecular oncology has allowed the development of targeted agents in different types of thyroid cancer. Some agents presently being evaluated in clinical trials include inhibitors of angiogenesis (sorafenib, CA4P, axitinib and vandetanib), the epidermal growth factor receptor (gefitinib, vandetanib) and RET protein (vandetanib). Preliminary results from these studies will be reviewed in this paper.;The recent explosion of targeted agents available for study has generated enthusiasm for oncologists treating thyroid cancer. Antiangiogenesis strategies in particular appear promising. RET inhibition in medullary thyroid cancer is also being explored. Further clinical trials will determine which of these will enter the clinic in the near future.",

The use of molecular data to improve the preoperative diagnosis of thyroid cancer on materiel from fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is in the course of validation by numerous teams throughout the world. We have proposed a molecular test based on the expression level of a series of 19 genes, capable of discriminating malignant from benign tumors [15]. A prospective study aiming at the clinical validation of the molecular test has been performed on a cohort of 730 patients with a thyroid nodule. In patients subjected to tumor resection (≈ 220), the preoperative molecular diagnosis (generated on FNAB material from analyses of the expression level of the 19 genes) was compared to the postoperative diagnosis given by the pathologist (used as reference). Treatment and follow-up of the serious forms of thyroid cancer should benefit by the early identification of tumors with a metastatic potential using molecular characteristics differentiating invasive and non-invasive thyroid carcinomas. We have performed genetic and genomic analyses on a series of 200 papillary thyroid carcinomas (non-invasive or NI-PTC, 50%; invasive or I-PTC, 50%). BRAF(V600E) mutation or/and RET/PTC gene rearrangement have been detected in less than 25% of NI-PTC but in more than 75% of I-PTC. Pan-genomic analyses (Agilent microarray) revealed that 1373 genes are differentially expressed (fold change greater than 2) in NI-PTC as compared to I-PTC samples.

A case-control study was conducted in 413 surgical cases comprising 17 distinct histopathologic categories, 244 malignant, 169 benign, and 304 double-blinded specimens. Seventeen alterations of BRAF, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, PAX8, and RET genes were evaluated using a single validated technology platform. Following verification of analytical sensitivity, accuracy, and precision in model and surgical specimens, 152 molecular positive results were generated in lesions representing multiple stages of progression and epithelial differentiation as well as rare subtypes of primary, secondary, or recurring tumors. Single mutations were found in 58% of primary malignant lesions and 12% of benign (P < .001). In the blinded validation set, mutation distribution and frequency were distinct across variants of follicular and papillary carcinomas. BRAF or RET-PTC was detected exclusively in malignant lesions but not in follicular carcinomas (P < .001). RAS or PAX8-PPARG were present in 23% of adenomas, and NRAS was found in a single nonneoplastic lesion (P = .0014). These data substantiate the diagnostic utility of molecular testing for oncogenic mutations and validate its performance in a variety of surgical specimens. Standardized and validated multianalyte molecular panels can complement the preoperative and postoperative assessment of thyroid nodules and support a growing number of clinical and translational applications with potential diagnostic, prognostic, or theranostic utility.

Over-expression of GDNF in adult transgenic mice induces the development of testicular tumours that mimic human seminoma, the most frequent testicular germ cell tumour. Activating mutations of RET were previously reported in several types of cancer, including thyroid, pituitary, adrenal and melanoma cancer. Both mouse experimental model and clinical studies suggested that mutations or selective polymorphisms of RET might be associated with human seminoma. To verify this hypothesis, we conducted this study in a French University Hospital and carried out an association study using tissue samples from 66 paraffin-embedded seminoma tumours. The most frequently mutated exons of the RET proto-oncogene were sequenced to identify mutations or selective polymorphisms. No somatic mutations were identified.

It has been hypothesized that these isoforms perform distinct functions and that their expressions are differentially regulated during mammalian development. To gain an insight into the expression patterns of various ret isoforms during embryogenesis, we investigate the temporal and spatial expressions of ret gene in mouse embryos and in adult mice. We characterized the 3' end of the mouse ret gene and localized the alternatively spliced exons. Using 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3' RACE) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), ret 9 and ret 51 transcripts were identified in both mouse embryos and adult mouse tissues. However, the ret 43 transcript was not. Using in situ hybridization, we showed that ret 9 was the dominant ret encoding transcript in mouse embryos. Transcripts of ret 9 were detected in all cranial ganglia; in the sensory and autonomic ganglia of the trunk; in a subset of neurons of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG); in the motor neurons of the spinal cord; in the developing lung and excretory systems; in the enteric neuroblasts of the ENS; and in the thyroid lobes. In contrast, ret 51 expression was weak and restricted to the motor column of the spinal cord, the DRG, the enteric neuroblasts, the lung bud and the kidney.

Incidence is increasing, with a global estimate of half a million new cases this year. PTC is found in a variety of morphologic variants, usually grows slowly and is clinically indolent, although rare, aggressive forms with local invasion or distant metastases can occur. In recent years, thyroid cancer has been at the forefront of molecular pathology as a result of the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster and the recognition of the role of Ret/PTC rearrangements in PTC. Nonetheless, the molecular pathogenesis of this disease remains poorly characterized. In the clinical setting, benign thyroid nodules are far more frequent, and distinguishing between them and malignant nodules is a common diagnostic problem. It is estimated that 5-10% of people will develop a clinically significant thyroid nodule during their lifetime. Although the introduction of fine-needle aspiration has made PTC identification more reliable, clinicians often have to make decisions regarding patient care on the basis of equivocal information. Thus, the existing diagnostic tools available to distinguish benign from malignant neoplasms are not always reliable. This article will critically evaluate recently described putative biomarkers and their potential future role for diagnostic purposes in fine-needle aspiration cytology samples. It will highlight the evolution of our understanding of the molecular biology of PTC, from a narrow focus on specific molecular lesions such as Ret/PTC rearrangements to a pan-genomic approach.",

This knowledge has in turn led to the development of a range of targeted therapies, some specific to thyroid cancer genetic alterations such as the RET/PTC translocation, and others that exploit general malignant properties such as angiogenesis. This review highlights novel targeted agents for the treatment of differentiated and medullary thyroid cancers being studied at this time, and the results of recently published trials. We propose that such patients should be managed, whenever possible, within a clinical trial, in order to access the most promising new drugs for thyroid cancer.

We examined spontaneous PTC from 33 patients (23 females and 10 males) with a median age of 18 yr (range, 6-21 yr) and a median follow-up of 3.5 yr (range, 0-13.4 yr). The ret/PTC mutations were identified in 15 tumors (45%), including 8 PTC-1 (8 of 15, 53%), 2 PTC-2 (2 of 15, 13%), 2 PTC-3 (2 of 15, 13%), and 3 (3 of 15, 20%) combined PTC mutations (PTC-1 and PTC-2). This distribution is significantly different (P = 0.001, by chi2 analysis) from that reported for children with radiation-induced PTC. There was no correlation between the presence or type of ret/PTC mutation and patient age, tumor size, focality, extent of disease at diagnosis, or recurrence. We conclude that ret/PTC mutations are 1) common in sporadic childhood PTC, 2) predominantly PTC-1, 3) frequently multiple, and 4) of different distribution than that reported for children with radiation-induced PTC.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Two systems biology concepts, genomics and proteomics, are highlighted in this review. These techniques are implemented to optimize the use of thyroid tumor markers (TTM). Tissue microarray studies can produce genetic maps and proteomics, patterns of protein expression of TTM derived from preoperative biopsies and specimens. For instance, papillary and medullary thyroid cancers harbor RAS, RET, and BRAF genetic mutations. Follicular thyroid cancers harbor translocations and fusions of certain genes (PAX 8 and PPAR-gamma). Proteomic analysis from various tissue sources can provide useful information regarding the overall state of a thyroid cancer cell. Understanding the molecular events related to these genetic and protein alterations can potentially clarify thyroid cancer pathogenesis and guide appropriate molecular targeted therapies. However, despite the realization that these emerging technologies hold great promise, there are still significant obstacles to the routine use of TTM. These include equivocal thyroid nodule tissue morphologic interpretations, inadequate standardization of methods, and monetary costs. Interpretative shortcomings are frequently due to the relative scarcity of cellular material from fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) specimens. This can be rectified with large needle aspiration biopsy (LNAB) techniques and is exemplified by the favorable performance of galectin-3 determinations on LNAB specimens.",

The mechanism of its carcinogenesis is unclear, and its rapid growth and spread often prevent effective surgical therapy. Thus, chemotherapy is necessary. However, ATC is often resistant to anticancer drugs. Therefore, prediction of chemosensitivity is important in selecting appropriate treatment. In this study, after the establishment of three cell lines (K119, KOA2, and IAA) from patients with ATC, we analyzed them for abnormalities in certain oncogenes (myc, ras, ret, and c-erbB2) and the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Only one of three cell lines (KOA2) had a N-ras mutation [codon 61 CAA(Gln)-->CGA(Arg)] and a p53 gene mutation [exon 6 codon 192 Caa(Gln)-->TAG(stop)]. We also investigated their in vitro drug sensitivity and compared it with clinical chemosensitivity, retrospectively. In vitro drug sensitivity was determined using an adhesive tumor cell culture system. Only the K119 cells were sensitive to adriamycin and cisplatin in vitro. The other two were resistant to them in vitro. These results paralleled the clinical responses. We also evaluated the in vitro drug sensitivity of a poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma cell line (SMP) and papillary thyroid carcinoma cell lines (NPA). None of the five cell lines expressed the multidrug resistance gene (mdr-1). In conclusion, we established ATC cell lines that are suitable models for characterizing the nature of multidrug resistance and carcinogenesis.",

Autopsy incidence varies from 3%-36%. PMC may, however, present with clinical symptoms, the commonest of which is cervical lymphadenopathy with or without palpable thyroid nodules. Other reported presentations include cystic neck mass, pulmonary mass (es), metastases in the skull or vertebral column. The upper limit of size to define PMC is 10 mm in most studies but many studies include lesions up to 15 mm in diameter. Histologic variants include encapsulated and partially encapsulated papillary carcinoma, circumscribed microcarcinoma and occult sclerosing carcinoma. Younger age and size less than 10 mm (< 15 mm in other studies) are considered to be favorable prognostic factors. Size alone, however, cannot be regarded as a determinant of prognosis. Older age, larger tumor size, distant metastases, capsular invasion and multifocality indicate unfavorable prognosis. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is an infrequent finding, since small deletions may be missed by southern blot analysis. Activation of oncogenes ret and trk have been reported in papillary carcinoma. Some authors advocate conservative while others favor aggressive therapy including total thyroidectomy with or without Iodine 131ablation.

The data were compared to findings on 32 post-Chernobyl PTCs that occurred after a longer period of time (9-12 years) after the accident. In none of the cases from either group were 100% of cells positive for RET rearrangement. In addition, the pattern of RET-positive cells was different in the two groups (short vs longer latency). A significant clustering of aberrant cells could be detected in the long-latency subgroup, whereas the aberrant cells were more homogeneously distributed among the short-latency tumours. The findings suggest that oligoclonal tumour development occurs in post-Chernobyl PTCs. This pattern of different clones within the tumour appears to become more discrete in cases with longer latencies, suggesting either outgrowth of individual clones or development of later subclones with time.",

To test the hypothesis that the ret/PTC1 rearrangement is involved in the pathogenesis of Chernobyl-associated papillary thyroid carcinomas, we studied a panel of 31 cases from Belarus. All individuals lived in fallout-contaminated oblasts (regions) of Belarus at the time of the accident: Gomel (n = 13), Brest (n = 12), Minsk (n = 4), and Grodno (n = 2). All were under age 20 at the time of the accident; 20 were born between 1982 and 1986. Individual thyroid radiation doses were estimated at 1.1 to 110 rem. Patients underwent surgery in Minsk in 1996. Fifteen patients had locally advanced disease (stage T4). The majority had regional lymph node involvement (stage N1, n = 27). There were no distant metastases. Surgical specimens were frozen at -80 degrees C, RNA was extracted and cDNA prepared. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed with specific primers for ret/PTC1, and c-ret and GAPDH as controls. Controls were positive in all 31 cases. Nine cases yielded a positive PCR product for the ret/PTC1 rearrangement (29%).

Cases in which more than one DNA variant was found were clinically reevaluated, and cosegregation of the disease with the variant was analyzed within the registrants' families. A total of 1000 controls were screened for the presence of detected variants, and in silico analyses were performed.;Three variants were identified, RET p.Tyr791Phe and p.Ser649Leu and VHL p.Pro81Ser. The frequencies of RET p.Ser649Leu (0.07%) and p.Tyr791Phe (0.9%) compared with controls excluded the two variants' role in the etiology of MEN 2 and VHL. None of the carriers of the RET variants who underwent prophylactic thyroidectomy showed medullary thyroid carcinoma. Clinical reinvestigation of 18 variant carriers excluded MEN 2. VHL variant p.Pro81Ser, also previously described as a mutation, did not segregate with the VHL in one family. In silico analyses for these variants predicted unmodified protein function.;RET p.Tyr791Phe and p.Ser649Leu and VHL p.Pro81Ser are definitely not pathogenic mutations for VHL and MEN 2.

PAX8/PPARG and RET/PTC rearrangements were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, while BRAF and RAS mutations were detected by pyrosequencing.;BRAF mutations were associated with a carcinoma in 100% of samples; RAS mutations were associated with a carcinoma in 57% of samples. Forty-nine percent of the carcinomas were identified by molecular testing in the group of follicular lesions, which increased the sensitivity from 60% to 80% compared to cytologic FNA evaluation alone. While follicular lesion FNAs had a 28% risk of malignancy, the risk increased to 71% for mutation-positive follicular lesions, and decreased to 18% for mutation-negative follicular lesions.;Molecular testing of air-dried FNA samples improves presurgical diagnosis. Discrepant sensitivities and specificities reported previously are most likely related to the use of different grading schemes resulting in different compositions of the cytologic categories, interobserver variability to diagnose follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinomas and a different prevalence of RAS mutations in follicular carcinomas.

The use of inhibitors specific for RET/PTC may be useful for targeted therapy of PTC.;The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacies of the recently developed kinase inhibitors SU11248, SU5416, and SU6668 in inhibition of RET/PTC.;SU11248, SU5416, and SU6668 were synthesized, and their inhibitory potencies were evaluated using an in vitro RET/PTC kinase assay. The inhibitory effects of the compounds on RET/PTC were evaluated by quantifying the autophosphorylation of RET/PTC, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 activation, and the morphological reversal of RET/PTC-transformed cells.;An in vitro kinase assay revealed that SU5416, SU6668, and SU11248 inhibited phosphorylation of the synthetic tyrosine kinase substrate peptide E4Y by RET/PTC3 in a dose-dependent manner with IC(50) of approximately 944 nm for SU5416, 562 nm for SU6668, and 224 nm for SU11248. Thus, SU11248 effectively inhibits the kinase activity of RET/PTC3. RET/PTC-mediated Y705 phosphorylation of STAT3 was inhibited by addition of SU11248, and the inhibitory effects of SU11248 on the tyrosine phosphorylation and transcriptional activation of STAT3 were very closely correlated with decreased autophosphorylation of RET/PTC.

Moreover, it presents the authors' own findings. The familial medullary thyroid carcinoma burdened genealogy shows a new point mutation TCG(Ser)-->GCG(Ala) in codon 891, in the exon 15 of the protooncogene RET. This mutation was not detected in the chromosomes of healthy individuals. Analyzing the linkage with two known and two new polymorphic markers showed that there was a cisaggregation of informative polymorphic markers, phenotypic manifestation of the disease, and mutations in the genealogy in question. In the protooncogene RET, there were two new polymorphisms: G/A at position 24 in intron 14 and C/T in codon 836 (exon 14). The rate of the polymorphism encountered in codon 836 proved to be similar for the Russians and the Germans (0.96%), which was also seen for two earlier described polymorphisms in codon 691 (0.80 and 0.81, respectively) and in codon 904 (0.21 and 0.22). At the same time, there were statistically significant differences in the rates of intron 14 polymorphism (0.87 and 0.77, respectively). In a family having MEN 2, a proband displayed TGC-->CGC mutation in codon 634 of the gene RET in the heterozygous state. The mutation results in substitution of cysteine amino acid residue in the cysteine-rich extracellular domain of protein kinase encoded by the gene RET for arginine. The results of molecular analysis were used to confirm its clinical diagnosis and to indicate that effective care should be delivered in MEN 2a.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) frequently presents as multiple tumour-foci within a single thyroid gland or pluriform, with synchronous tumours comprising different histological variants, raising questions regarding its clonality. Among the genetic aberrations described in PTC, the BRAF V600E mutation and ret/PTC activation occur most commonly. Several studies have investigated the genetic alteration status of multifocal thyroid tumours, with discordant results. To address the question of clonality this study examined disparate geographical and morphological areas from a single PTC (classic PTC, insular and anaplastic foci, and tumour cells adjacent to vascular invasion and lymphocytic infiltrate) for the presence of ret/PTC 1 or BRAF mutations. Moreover, we wanted to investigate the consistency of miRNA signatures within disparate areas of a tumour, and geographical data was further correlated with expression profiles of 330 different miRNAs. Putative miRNA gene targets were predicted for differentially regulated miRNAs and immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue sections in an effort to investigate phenotypic variations in microvascular density (MVD), and cytokeratin and p53 protein expression levels.;All of the morphological areas proved negative for ret/PTC 1 rearrangement. Two distinct foci with classic morphology harboured the BRAF mutation. All other regions, including the insular and anaplastic areas were negative for the mutation. MiRNA profiles were found to distinguish tumours containing the BRAF mutation from the other tumour types, and to differentiate between the more aggressive insular & anaplastic tumours, and the classic variant. Our data corroborated miRNAs previously discovered in this carcinoma, and additional miRNAs linked to various processes involved in tumour growth and proliferation.;The initial genetic alteration analysis indicated that pluriform PTC did not necessarily evolve from classic PTC progenitor foci. Analysis of miRNA profiles however provided an interesting variation on the clonality question. While hierarchical clustering analysis of miRNA expression supported the hypothesis that discrete areas did not evolve from clonal expansion of tumour cells, it did not exclude the possibility of independent mutational events suggesting both phenomena might occur simultaneously within a tumour to enhance cancer progression in geographical micro-environments within a tumour.",

Subsequent reports concerning hyalinizing trabecular carcinoma further complicated its classification. To avoid uncertainties, the definition of hyalinizing trabecular tumor (HTT) is more widely used. Herein, a case of HTT is reported in detail, and the circumstances are also discussed. HTT is thought to be particularly differentiated from papillary carcinoma despite the identical high frequency of nuclear grooves and cytoplasmic inclusions, and MIB-1-positive staining is one of the most accurate diagnostic methods due to the distinct membrane-positive pattern noted in HTT. It is believed that most HTTs are benign and lobectomy is the standard treatment. Pathologists should offer surgeons information concerning diagnosis overlapping with effective treatment.",

Little is known about the methylation status of MLH1 and MGMT in thyroid tumours and its association with MSI and mutational status.;In a series of 96 thyroid tumours whose mutational profiles of BRAF, IDH1 and NRAS mutations and RET/PTC were previously determined, we investigated MLH1 and MGMT expression and methylation status by qPCR and methylation-specific PCR after bisulphite treatment, respectively.

Additionally, malignant lesions show a higher MSI pattern than benign lesions.

Specimens were shipped in a nucleic acid stabilization solution and tested at a centralized clinical laboratory. Seventeen genetic alterations (BRAF, KRAS, HRAS, and NRAS mutations, PAX8-PPARG and RET-PTC rearrangements) were evaluated by multiplex polymerase chain reaction and liquid bead array cytometry in 769 FNAs that met inclusion criteria. Cytology, histology, and clinical care followed local procedures and practices. All results were double-blinded.;Thirty-two specimens (4.2%) failed to yield sufficient nucleic acid to generate molecular data. A single genetic alteration was detected in 80% of cytology malignant cases, 21% of indeterminate, 7.8% of nondiagnostic, and 3.5% of benign cases. Among 109 nodules with surgical histology reference standard, oncogenic mutations were present in 50% of malignant nodules missed by cytology. There were 14 cancers not identified by cytology or molecular tests, including 5 carcinomas with histologic sizes less than 1 cm (3 multifocal) and 8 noninvasive follicular variants of papillary carcinoma (4 encapsulated). No mutations were detected in 89% of the nodules benign by histopathology with 6 false-positive molecular results in 5 adenomas (2-5.5 cm) and 1 cystic nodule with an incidental papillary microcarcinoma (0.15 cm).

Pheochromocytoma is the tumor of the main sympathetic paraganglia, which is the adrenal medulla. The sympathetic paraganglioma secretes catecholamine while the parasympathetic do not. Both of them originate from neural crest cells and share similar mechanisms of tumor development. The same genetic alteration may predispose to the development of sympathetic and parasympathetic paraganglioma. The best known hereditary forms of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma are the von Hippel-Lindau disease, in which pheochromocytoma may be associated with CNS hemangioblastoma, retinal angioma, pancreatic endocrine tumor/cysts and renal clear cell carcinoma/cysts; the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, in which pheochromocytoma is associated with medullary thyroid carcinoma and primary hyperparathyroidism, Type 1 neurofibromatosis, the most frequent hereditary cancer syndrome. Finally, it has been characterized the paraganglioma syndrome in which sympathetic and parasympathetic paraganglioma are variously associated. The list of predisposing gene is quite long and comprises VHL, RET, NF1, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SDHAF2. More rarely, two other genes may predispose to pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma development: KIF1Bbeta and PHD2. A mechanism conducing to a defective apoptosis is the common pathways of those genes.

The former setting usually affects middle-aged females; the latter is typical of familial adenomatous polyposis. We report the case of a 69-yr-old man in whom two abdominal masses had been instrumentally detected following an access of abdominal pain. Save for a moderate hypertension, he was asymptomatic and an impalpable thyroid nodule was detected by ultrasonography. A high urinary noradrenaline output and cytology of the masses raised the suspicion of pheochromocytoma. At laparotomy, an adrenal pheochromocytoma and a paracaval paraganglioma were excised. Subsequently, hemithyroidectomy was performed, and histopathology revealed papillary microcarcinoma. A nodule of desmoid tumor was also removed from the abdominal wall. An analysis of RET, APC, and TP53 gene mutations, and of RET and NTRK1 gene rearrangements, yielded negative results. No in vitro transforming activity was detected in the tumor DNA when assayed in transfection experiments. The lack of a consistent family history also made unlikely the possibility of identifying the putative germline defect by linkage analyses.

We developed a rapid screening technique to detect ret rearrangements in human interphase and metaphase cells on the basis of multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of locus-specific DNA probes.;DNA from individual clones representing the respective ends of a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) contig spanning the entire ret gene locus were labeled with either digoxigenin (visualized in red) or biotin (green) and hybridized to normal human lymphocytes and the papillary thyroid cancer cell line TPC-1 expressing the ret/H4 chimeric transcript. Further detailed analysis was performed with whole chromosome painting probes and locus-specific probes (YACs, P1s, DNA repeat probes) on tumor metaphase spreads.;Hybridization of the YACs to unrearranged ret loci in normal human lymphocyte interphase nuclei showed two yellow domains because of probe overlap. Hybridization to TPC-1 interphase nuclei showed one yellow domain, and 1 red and 1 green domain separated by a large physical distance. Further analysis of metaphase spreads revealed a complex translocation t(1;10;21)(1pter > 1q31::21q22.1 > 21qter; 10q11.2 > 10pter::1q31 > 1qter; 21pter > 21q22.1;;10q21.2 > 10q11.2::10q21.2 > 10qter) and loss of the H4 gene locus on the nontranslocated chromosome 10.;Break point spanning probes can reliably detect ret rearrangements in interphase nuclei. Locus-specific and whole chromosome painting probes can be used to further characterize complex rearrangements by fluorescence in situ hybridization to metaphase spreads. The papillary thyroid cancer cell line TPC-1 carries the paracentric inversion 10q, inv(10)(q11.2q21) and a complex t(1; 10; 21) translocation. Deletion of the H4 gene on the chromosome 10 not involved in the t(1; 10; 21) translocation suggests lack of normal H4 expression in the TPC-1 cell line.

MET mutation M1268T was located in a codon highly conserved among receptor tyrosine kinases, and homologous to the codon mutated in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B, and many cases of sporadic medullary carcinoma of the thyroid gland (Ret M918T). Ret M918T and MET M1268T have previously been shown to be highly active in mouse NIH3T3 transformation assays, and to change the substrate specificity of the kinase. We studied the mechanism of transformation mediated by MET M1268T by analysing a clone, F4, derived from NIH3T3 cells transformed by MET M1268T. In contrast to NIH3T3 cells, F4 cells grew in suspension in tissue culture, and rapidly formed tumors in nude mice. We found that c-Src was constitutively bound to MET proteins in F4 cells, and that Src kinase activity was elevated. Transfection of dominant negative Src constructs into F4 cells eliminated the ability of F4 cells to grow in suspension culture and retarded the growth of F4 cells in vivo. The ability of transfected dominant negative Src constructs to inhibit the growth of F4 cells correlated with the inhibition of phosphorylation of paxillin and focal adhesion kinase. Transfection of dominant negative Src constructs into F4 cells had no effect on Grb2 binding or PLC gamma phosphorylation. The results suggest that c-Src participates in the tumorigenic phenotype induced in NIH3T3 cells by MET M1268T by signaling through focal adhesion kinase and paxillin. Oncogene (2000).",

        "Doc_abstract":"The two main forms of RET rearrangement in papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) arise from intrachromosomal inversions fusing the tyrosine kinase domain of RET with either the H4 (RET/PTC1) or the ELE1/RFG genes (RET/PTC3). PTEN codes for a dual-specificity phosphatase and maps to chromosome 10q22-23. Germline mutations confer susceptibility to Cowden syndrome whereas somatic mutations or deletions are common in several sporadic human tumors. Decreased PTEN expression has been implicated in thyroid cancer development. We report the characterization of a new chromosome 10 rearrangement involving H4 and PTEN. The initial H4/PTEN rearrangement was discovered as a non-specific product of RT-PCR for RET/PTC1 in irradiated thyroid cell lines. Sequencing revealed a transcript consisting of exon 1 and 2 of H4 fused with exons 3-6 of PTEN. Nested RT-PCR with specific primers bracketing the breakpoints confirmed the H4/PTEN rearrangements in irradiated KAT-1 and KAT-50 cells. Additional H4/PTEN variants, generated by recombination of either exon 1 or exon 2 of H4 with exon 6 of PTEN, were found in non-irradiated KAK-1, KAT-50, ARO and NPA cells. Their origin through chromosomal recombination was confirmed by detection of the reciprocal PTEN/H4 product. H4/PTEN recombination was not a clonal event in any of the cell lines, as Southern blots with appropriate probes failed to demonstrate aberrant bands, and multicolor FISH of KAK1 cells with BAC probes for H4 and PTEN did not show a signal overlap in all cells. Based on PCR of serially diluted samples, the minimal frequency of spontaneous recombination between these loci was estimated to be approximately 1/10(6) cells. H4/PTEN products were found by nested RT-PCR in 4/14 normal thyroid tissues (28%) and 14/18 PTC (78%) (P<0.01). H4/PTEN is another example of recombination involving the H4 locus, and points to the high susceptibility of thyroid cells to intrachromosomal gene rearrangements. As this also represents a plausible mechanism for loss-of-function of PTEN, other thyroid neoplastic phenotypes and eventually other cancer types need to be screened for clonal H4/PTEN rearrangements.",

The field has recently witnessed several important developments stemming from improvements in histopathological classification schemes, advanced imaging techniques, and a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor progression (in both sporadic and hereditary cancers). Platinum-based chemotherapy remains the mainstay of therapy for high grade carcinomas. In contrast, the treatment of advanced well-differentiated NET depends on site of origin, underlying tumor biology, and whether or not the patient is symptomatic. Somatostatin analogs continue to play a key role in controlling hormone-mediated symptoms. In addition, octreotide has demonstrated anti-tumor activity in midgut carcinoids. Novel somatostatin analogs (for use alone or in the context of peptide receptor radiotherapy or imaging) are on the horizon. Agents targeting VEGF- and mTOR-pathway signaling have been approved for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. In addition, two RET inhibitors have been approved for medullary thyroid cancer, evidence for a fundamentally new treatment paradigm (based on the use of targeted agents). Despite the advances, there remains a serious unmet need for additional treatment options for refractory high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas, paragangliomas/pheochromocytomas, adrenocortical carcinomas, and progressive carcinoid tumors. Furthermore, the role of liver-directed therapy in the context of available systemic approaches needs clarification.

The most dramatic advances have been in the application of molecular genetic techniques to define the affected genes and to develop predictive testing for patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes. Germline mutations at specific loci of the RET proto-oncogene have been demonstrated in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia types IIA, IIB, and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma not associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia. This has led to direct DNA testing for these mutations in patients at risk for these syndromes. The approach to predictive testing, diagnosis, and early treatment of these patients is discussed as a model for the approach to hereditary cancers. Linkage testing with DNA markers is still required for patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type I because the responsible gene has not yet been isolated. Efforts to clarify the etiologies of other familial neuroendocrine tumors not associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia continue. Familial pheochromocytoma, neuroblastoma, and carcinoid also are reviewed. The use of molecular genetic techniques as a powerful tool for the early identification and treatment of susceptible individuals is emphasized.",

Because no more than 10 % of HSCR cases have a late presentation with classical chronic constipation and megacolon, the clinician has to make a difficult, early diagnosis, which is the crux of the clinical problem. The aim of this review paper is to present all tools currently available to make a clear HSCR diagnosis and to discuss the problems facing the clinician and the pediatric surgeon in the correct identification of HSCR and of other intestinal dysganglionoses.;Based on the current state of knowledge and 24 years' personal experience in clinical practice and basic research in this field, I describe an algorithmic approach that enables clinicians and surgeons to rationalize and maximize the clarity of diagnosis through a complementary set of procedures and enzyme-histochemical reactions.;Two innovative techniques, added to the protocol in the last four years, are described: the lyophilized HSCR diagnostic kit, and the one-trocar transumbilical laparoscopic intestinal full-thickness biopsy technique (OTTLB).;The rational, algorithmic diagnostic pathway proposed in this review paper aims to optimize every diagnosis by the stepwise application of a complementary set of procedures and enzyme-histochemical reactions as they become appropriate. In the interests of simplifying genetic molecular diagnosis, I suggest the following guidelines: 1) only in cases of total colonic aganglionosis (TCA) is it advisable to carry out full RET mutation screening (the mutation rate is up to 70 %); and 2) all HSCR patients should be tested only for standard MEN2A and MTC mutations. If these are present, the patients should be followed up carefully with proper surveillance and biochemical testing of other susceptible family members as they are at risk of developing neuroendocrine tumors.",

Both molecules have been associated with the development of thyroid C-cell tumors after lifetime exposure in rodents. Previously, it has been reported that these tumors are preceded by increased plasma calcitonin and C-cell hyperplasia. We can now document that the murine C-cell effects are mediated via GLP-1R. Thus, 13 wk of continuous exposure to GLP-1R agonists was associated with marked increases in plasma calcitonin and in the incidence of C-cell hyperplasia in wild-type mice. In contrast, similar effects were not seen in GLP-1R knockout mice. Human C-cell cancer is often caused by activating mutations in the rearranged-during-transfection (RET) protooncogene. We developed an immunohistochemical method to assess RET activation in tissues. Liraglutide dosing to mice was not found to activate RET. Further evaluation of the signaling pathways demonstrated that liraglutide increased ribosomal S6, but not MAPK kinase, phosphorylation. These observations are consistent with effects of GLP-1R agonists on rodent C cells being mediated via mammalian target of rapamycin activation in a RET- and MAPK-independent manner.",

In order to characterize further the transforming activity of this tumour histotype, a new panel of tumour specimens from 16 patients was analysed by using a modified calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation transfection protocol. Tumour DNA from 10 patients (62%) displayed a transforming activity due to activation of three different oncogenes identified in four cases as PTC, in four cases as TRK, and in two cases as N-RAS. The same structural alterations of PTC and TRK (gene rearrangements) as well as of N-RAS (point mutation) detected in the NIH3T3 transformants, were also found in the original tumour DNAs, thus indicating that their activation was not due to transfection procedures. Since both PTC, a novel rearranged form of RET, and TRK display a tyrosine protein kinase activity, it is proposed that the activation of this class of oncogenes is specifically involved in the pathogenesis of papillary thyroid cancer.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Most cancers appear to be sporadic. However, 5 to 10% of cancers occur in genetically predisposed individuals. This inherited genetic risk is observed in syndromes such as familial polyendocrinopathies or phacomatosis such as neurofibromatosis, but also in familial aggregations of frequent cancers such as breast or colon cancers. Thanks to studies on molecular genetics, it has been possible over the last ten years to localize and to identify a large number of predisposing genes. These discoveries have permitted to better understand the biological basis of the predisposition and to offer counselling by identifying at-risk individuals in those families. In the case of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 associated with an elevated risk for medullary thyroid cancer, the gene involved is a protooncogene named RET and located on chromosome 10. Point mutations affecting specific regions of this gene are the basis of the genetic predisposition. For familial breast cancer, a susceptibility gene named BRCA1 has been located on the long arm of chromosome 17. Mutation of this gene (yet to be identified) led to very elevated risk of breast cancer and also in some families of ovarian cancer.",

Indeed, about 40% of PTCs harbor mutations in BRAF gene, whereas RET rearrangements (RET/PTC oncogenes) are present in about 20% of cases. Finally, RAS mutations and TRK rearrangements account for about 5% each of these malignancies. We used RNA-Sequencing to identify fusion transcripts and mutations in cancer driver genes in a cohort of 18 PTC patients. Furthermore, we used targeted DNA sequencing to validate identified mutations. We extended the screening to 50 PTC patients and 30 healthy individuals. Using this approach we identified new missense mutations in CBL, NOTCH1, PIK3R4 and SMARCA4 genes. We found somatic mutations in DICER1, MET and VHL genes, previously found mutated in other tumors, but not described in PTC. We identified a new chimeric transcript generated by the fusion of WNK1 and B4GALNT3 genes, correlated with B4GALNT3 overexpression. Our data confirmed PTC genetic heterogeneity, revealing that gene expression correlates more with the mutation pattern than with tumor staging. Overall, this study provides new data about mutational landscape of this neoplasia, suggesting potential pharmacological adjuvant therapies against Notch signaling and chromatin remodeling enzymes.
