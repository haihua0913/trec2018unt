However, the function of ErbB receptors and their ligands appears highly complex, and its impact on cell growth and proliferation of normal and tumor cells is incompletely understood. Flow cytometric fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements facilitate the quantitative analysis of receptor interaction.

These cell surface receptors were discovered in the context of cellular transformation and have subsequently been found to be overexpressed in many types of human cancer. Cumulative evidence suggests that upregulation of the most well-characterized receptor, erbB1, also known as the epidermal growth factor receptor, plays a significant role in the development and progression of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. A variety of strategies have been developed that specifically target epidermal growth factor receptor, including monoclonal antibodies, ligand-linked immunotoxins, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and antisense approaches. Epidermal growth factor receptor blockade in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines and preclinical animal models inhibits cell proliferation and tumor growth. Clinical trials are under way to test the safety and efficacy of many of these targeting strategies in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients. Encouraging preliminary results combining an epidermal growth factor receptor targeting approaches with chemotherapy or radiotherapy suggest that interference with this growth factor receptor may enhance antitumor efficacy of standard therapies. As erbB family member interactions and downstream signaling pathways are elucidated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, specific targeting strategies may become incorporated into standard treatment approaches.",

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, or HER1) belongs to the erbB receptor tyrosine kinase family. HER1-mediated cell signaling has been shown to play a major role in promoting tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and evasion of apoptosis. Over-expression of HER1 is observed in multiple human malignancies, including colorectal, lung, breast and pancreatic cancers. In pancreatic carcinoma, over-expression of HER1 is observed in greater than 70% of patients and is associated with a poor prognosis and a significant decrease in survival. Cetuximab (Erbitux) is a chimeric monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to the extracellular domain of the HER1 molecule preventing ligand binding and promoting internalization and subsequent degradation of the HER1 receptor. Cetuximab has shown anti-tumor activity either alone or in combination with other agents and is currently FDA approved for use in both squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and colorectal carcinoma. Research efforts continue to elucidate a possible role for cetuximab in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Despite promising preclinical work, phase II and phase III clinical trials have failed to consistently show efficacy of cetuximab treatment in advanced pancreatic cancer either alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents.

These receptors consist of an extracellular domain, a single hydrophobic transmembrane segment, and an intracellular portion with a juxtamembrane segment, a protein kinase domain, and a carboxyterminal tail. The ErbB proteins function as homo and heterodimers. Growth factor binding to EGFR induces a large conformational change in the extracellular domain. Two ligand-EGFR complexes unite to form a back-to-back dimer in which the ligands are on opposite sides of the aggregate. Following ligand binding, EGFR intracellular kinase domains form an asymmetric dimer. The carboxyterminal lobe of the activator kinase of the dimer interacts with the amino-terminal lobe of the receiver kinase thereby leading to its allosteric stimulation. Several malignancies are associated with the mutation or increased expression of members of the ErbB family including lung, breast, stomach, colorectal, head and neck, and pancreatic carcinomas. Gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib are orally effective protein-kinase targeted quinazoline derivatives that are used in the treatment of ERBB1-mutant lung cancer and lapatinib is an orally effective quinazoline derivative used in the treatment of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer. Moreover, monoclonal antibodies that target the extracellular domain of ErbB2 are used for the treatment of ErbB2-positive breast cancer and monoclonal antibodies that target ErbB1 and are used for the treatment of colorectal cancer.

Various quinazoline inhibitors targeting ErbB1 or ErbB2 - 4 have been developed as anti-cancer agents and might be useful for antipsychotic treatment. In the present study, we used an animal model of schizophrenia established by neonatal hippocampal lesioning and evaluated the neurobehavioral consequences of ErbB1-inhibitor treatment. Subchronic administration of the ErbB1 inhibitor ZD1839 to the cerebroventricle of rats receiving neonatal hippocampal lesioning ameliorated deficits in prepulse inhibition as well as those in the latent inhibition of tone-dependent fear learning. There were no apparent adverse effects on basal learning scores or locomotor activity, however. The administration of other ErbB1 inhibitors, PD153035 and OSI-774, similarly attenuated the prepulse inhibition impairment of this animal model. In parallel, there were decreases in ErbB1 phosphorylation in animals treated with ErbB1 inhibitors. These results indicate an antipsychotic potential of quinazoline ErbB1 inhibitors.

The second approach utilizes humanized monoclonal antibodies generated against the receptor's ligand-binding extracellular domain. These antibodies block binding of receptor-activating ligands and, in some cases, can induce receptor endocytosis and downregulation.

These trans-membrane proteins are activated following binding with peptide growth factors of the EGF-family of proteins. Evidence suggests that the EGFR is involved in the pathogenesis and progression of different carcinoma types. The EGFR and EGF-like peptides are often over-expressed in human carcinomas, and in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that these proteins are able to induce cell transformation. Amplification of the EGFR gene and mutations of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain have been recently demonstrated to occur in carcinoma patients. Interestingly, both these genetic alterations of the EGFR are correlated with high probability to respond to anti-EGFR agents. However, ErbB proteins and their ligands form a complex system in which the interactions occurring between receptors and ligands affect the type and the duration of the intracellular signals that derive from receptor activation. In fact, proteins of the ErbB family form either homo- or hetero-dimers following ligand binding, each dimer showing different affinity for ligands and different signaling properties. In this regard, evidence suggests that cooperation of multiple ErbB receptors and cognate ligands is necessary to induce cell transformation. In particular, the growth and the survival of carcinoma cells appear to be sustained by a network of receptors/ligands of the ErbB family. This phenomenon is also important for therapeutic approaches, since the response to anti-EGFR agents might depend on the total level of expression of ErbB receptors and ligands in tumor cells.",

With the advent of new therapeutic options targeting EGFR signalling in colon carcinoma, it was decided to determine ADAM17 status in relation to clinico-pathological parameters and EGFR status. To this end, a series of 39 colon carcinomas were analysed. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were used to localize ADAM17, EGFR, and the activated forms of EGFR. The activated form of ADAM17 was assessed in primary cancers and colon cell lines by immunoblotting. ADAM17 and EGFR mRNA levels were assessed by quantitative RT-PCR. Chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) was used to quantify the HER1 gene. ADAM17 was strongly expressed in all tumours, by both neoplastic and endothelial cells. It was expressed both as a pro- and as an active form in tumours and colonic cancer cell lines. ADAM17 mRNA was up-regulated in 90% of colon carcinomas relative to the paired normal mucosa, whatever the tumour grade or stage. When present, activated EGFR was co-expressed with ADAM17 by colon carcinomas, although at a variable level among tumour cells, and by endothelial cells. EGFR mRNA was overexpressed in 77% of colon carcinomas compared with the paired normal mucosa. One case showed high-level amplification of HER1. In conclusion, this study is the first demonstration that ADAM17 is overexpressed in human primary colon carcinoma, whatever the tumour stage and differentiation and whatever the level of EGFR expression.

In the past 30 years we have witnessed some interesting shifts in terms of epidemiology of esophago gastric cancers. Regardless of a world region, the majority of patients diagnosed with esophageal or gastric cancers die from progression or recurrence of their disease. While there are many active cytotoxic agents for esophageal and stomach cancers, their impact on the disease course has been modest at best. Median survival for patients with advanced gastroesophageal cancer is still less than a year. Therefore, novel strategies, based on our understanding of biology and genetics, are desperately needed. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway has been implicated in pathophysiology of many epithelial malignancies, including esophageal and stomach cancers. EGFR inhibitors, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies, have been explored in patients with esophageal and gastric cancers. It appears that tumors of the distal esophagus and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) may be more sensitive to EGFR blockade than distal gastric adenocarcinomas. Investigations looking into potential molecular predictors of sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors for patients with esophageal and GEJ cancers are ongoing. While we are still searching for those predictors, it is clear that they will be different from ones identified in lung and colorectal cancers. Further development of EGFR inhibitors for esophageal and GEJ cancers should be driven by better understanding of EGFR pathway disregulation that drives cancer progression in a sensitive patient population.",

This manuscript comprehensively reviews the preclinical data on afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family (ErbB) including EGFR, HER2 and ErbB4. Afatinib covalently binds to cysteine 797 of the EGFR and the corresponding cysteines 805 and 803 in HER2 and ErbB4, respectively. Such covalent binding irreversibly inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of these receptors, resulting in reduced auto- and transphosphorylation within the ErbB dimers and inhibition of important steps in the signal transduction of all ErbB receptor family members. Afatinib inhibits cellular growth and induces apoptosis in a wide range of cells representative for non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, head and neck squamous cell cancer and several other cancer types exhibiting abnormalities of the ErbB network. This translates into tumour shrinkage in a variety of in vivo rodent models of such cancers. Afatinib retains inhibitory effects on signal transduction and in vitro and in vivo cancer cell growth in tumours resistant to reversible EGFR inhibitors, such as those exhibiting the T790M mutations. Several combination treatments have been explored to prevent and/or overcome development of resistance to afatinib, the most promising being those with EGFR- or HER2-targeted antibodies, other tyrosine kinase inhibitors or inhibitors of downstream signalling molecules.

Moreover, strong correlation was detected among these three factors. To examine whether a causal link exists, we used two human gastric carcinoma lines, SNU-5 and HGC27, to study the molecular basis of miRNA-34a, EGFR signaling, and MMP7 activation. We found that EGF-induced EGFR phosphorylation in SNU-5 or HGC27 cells activated MMP7 and consequently cancer invasiveness. Both an inhibitor for EGFR and an inhibitor for Akt significantly inhibited the EGF-induced activation of MMP7, suggesting a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling cascade dependent pathway. Moreover, miRNA-34a levels were not affected by EGF-induced EGFR phosphorylation. However, overexpression of miRNA-34a antagonized EGF-induced MMP7 activation without affecting EGFR phosphorylation in SNU-5 or HGC27 cells. Taken together, our data suggest that miRNA-34 inhibits EGFR signaling via downstream PI3K signaling cascades to regulate MMP7 expression in gastric carcinoma. Thus, miRNA-34a, EGFR, and MMP7 appear to be promising therapeutic targets for preventing the metastasis of gastric carcinoma.",

Recently, mutant Ras was shown to be capable of activating ErbB receptors in a ligand-independent manner. Furthermore, it was observed that nucleolin, a transcriptional regulator and ribosome biogenesis factor, can bind both K-Ras and the cytoplasmic tail of ErbB receptors to enhance ErbB receptor activation. However, the functional significance of these interactions to cancer pathogenesis has not been probed. Here, we show that endogenous nucleolin interacts simultaneously in vivo with endogenous Ras and ErbB1 (EGFR) in cancer cells. The C-terminal 212 amino acids of nucleolin were determined to be sufficient to interact with ErbB1 and all Ras protein isoforms (H-, N-, and K-Ras). Nucleolin partially colocalizes with Ras at the plasma membrane. Moreover, activated but not wild-type Ras facilitates nucleolin interaction with ErbB1 and stabilizes ErbB1 receptor levels. Most importantly, these three oncogenes synergistically facilitate anchorage-independent cell growth in vitro and tumor growth in vivo.

Therapies that target EGFR can promote the dimerization of EGFR with other ErbB receptors, which is associated with the development of drug resistance. Understanding how interactions among ErbB receptors alter EGFR biology could provide avenues for improving cancer therapy. We found that EGFR interacted directly with the CYT1 and CYT2 variants of ErbB4 and the membrane-anchored intracellular domain (mICD). The CYT2 variant, but not the CYT1 variant, protected EGFR from ligand-induced degradation by competing with EGFR for binding to a complex containing the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl and the adaptor Grb2. Cultured breast cancer cells overexpressing both EGFR and ErbB4 CYT2 mICD exhibited increased migration. With molecular modeling, we identified residues involved in stabilizing the EGFR dimer. Mutation of these residues in the dimer interface destabilized the complex in cells and abrogated growth factor-stimulated cell migration. An exon array analysis of 155 breast tumors revealed that the relative mRNA abundance of the ErbB4 CYT2 variant was increased in ER+ HER2- breast cancer patients, suggesting that our findings could be clinically relevant.

In this study, we evaluated the in vivo efficacy of a therapeutic anti-ErbB3 antibody, MM-121. We found that MM-121 effectively blocked ligand-dependent activation of ErbB3 induced by either EGFR, HER2, or MET. Assessment of several cancer cell lines revealed that MM-121 reduced basal ErbB3 phosphorylation most effectively in cancers possessing ligand-dependent activation of ErbB3. In those cancers, MM-121 treatment led to decreased ErbB3 phosphorylation and, in some instances, decreased ErbB3 expression. The efficacy of single-agent MM-121 was also examined in xenograft models. A machine learning algorithm found that MM-121 was most effective against xenografts with evidence of ligand-dependent activation of ErbB3. We subsequently investigated whether MM-121 treatment could abrogate resistance to anti-EGFR therapies by preventing reactivation of ErbB3. We observed that an EGFR mutant lung cancer cell line (HCC827), made resistant to gefitinib by exogenous heregulin, was resensitized by MM-121. In addition, we found that a de novo lung cancer mouse model induced by EGFR T790M-L858R rapidly became resistant to cetuximab. Resistance was associated with an increase in heregulin expression and ErbB3 activation. However, concomitant cetuximab treatment with MM-121 blocked reactivation of ErbB3 and resulted in a sustained and durable response. Thus, these results suggest that targeting ErbB3 with MM-121 can be an effective therapeutic strategy for cancers with ligand-dependent activation of ErbB3.",

Although tumour-specific overexpression affected each ErbB receptor (EGFR 47%, ErbB2 29%, ErbB3 21%, ErbB4 26%), EGFR abnormalities were most prevalent. The latter, and overexpression of more than two ErbB receptors in the same tumour, which always included EGFR, correlated with metastatic disease. ErbB products were specifically detected on the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm. In contrast, ErbB4 was uniquely localized to the nucleus in 7 carcinomas and a tumour-derived cell line, indicating a role for regulated intramembrane proteolysis resulting in nuclear ErbB4 translocation in HNSCC. Expression of prototype ligand EGF or low-affinity stromal activator tenascin correlated significantly with EGFR overexpression, implying chronic EGFR activation. Simultaneous overexpression of additional ErbB receptors in most of these cases suggested recurrent involvement of receptor heterodimers. In spite of frequent ErbB receptor alterations, autologous ErbB serum antibodies were rare, with only 1 of 38 tumour patients exhibiting an ErbB2-specific immune response. Based on upregulation of several known immunosuppressive molecules, scarcity of ErbB-specific antibodies is consistent with attenuation of natural tumour-specific immune responses in HNSCC.",

Previous studies have indicated that activation of erbB molecules contributes to malignant transformation both by promoting cell proliferation through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) signaling pathway and by preventing apoptosis through the Phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI-3 kinase) pathway. Disabling erbB receptors converts malignant cells that were resistant to cell death caused by irradiation to cells that are sensitive to apoptosis. Here, we report that an activated form of EGFR can elevate the levels of Survivin, a member of the Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein (IAP) family implicated in mitotic checkpoint control. Conversely, inactivation of the ErbB receptors reduces the expression levels of Survivin. Furthermore, we found that upregulation of Survivin by EGFR is dependent on the PI-3 kinase pathway but not on the MAP kinase pathway. Indeed, inhibition of PI-3 kinase can diminish Survivin at both the mRNA and the protein levels. Combined with previous findings that Survivin plays a role in control of chromosome segregation and that it is overexpressed in various cancers, our results suggest that EGFR may cause transformation by directly affecting mitosis and increasing chromosome instability.",

Limited information is available on the contribution of Rho GTPases to heregulin-mediated signaling. In breast cancer cells, heregulin beta1 (HRG) causes a strong activation of Rac; however, it does so with striking differences in kinetics compared to epidermal growth factor, which signals through ErbB1 (epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]). Using specific ErbB receptor inhibitors and depletion of receptors by RNA interference (RNAi), we established that, surprisingly, activation of Rac by HRG is mediated not only by ErbB3 and ErbB2 but also by transactivation of EGFR, and it is independent of ErbB4. Similar receptor requirements are observed for HRG-induced actin cytoskeleton reorganization and mitogenic activity via extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). HRG-induced Rac activation was phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase dependent and Src independent. Furthermore, inactivation of Rac by expression of the Rac GTPase-activating protein beta2-chimerin inhibited HRG-induced ERK activation, mitogenicity, and migration in breast cancer cells. HRG mitogenic activity was also impaired by depletion of Rac1 using RNAi. Our studies established that Rac is a critical mediator of HRG mitogenic signaling in breast cancer cells and highlight additional levels of complexity for ErbB receptor coupling to downstream effectors that control aberrant proliferation and transformation.",

We initially confirmed that breast tumour tissues express all five somatostatin receptors (SSTR1-5) and four epidermal growth factor receptors (ErbB1-4). Subsequently, to gain insight into the function of SSTRs and ErbBs in oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive (MCF-7) or ERalpha-negative (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cells, we defined SSTR1, SSTR5 and ErbB1 mRNA and protein expression in these two tumour cell lines. Consistent with previous studies showing SSTR1/SSTR5 heterodimerization and having seen cell-specific and ligand-selective alterations in receptor expression, we next elucidated whether SSTR1 and SSTR5 functionally interact with ErbB1 using pbFRET analysis. We subsequently determined the effects of SST and EGF either alone, or in combination, on selected downstream signalling molecules such as erk1/2, p38 and JNK. Here, we showed that both SST and EGF influenced erk1/2 phosphorylation and that SST modulated the effects of EGF in a cell-specific manner. We also demonstrated agonist-, time and cell-dependent regulation of p38 phosphorylation. We further investigated modulation of Grb2, SOS, Shc, SH-PTP1 and SH-PTP2. ErbB1 adaptor proteins known to play a role in MAPK activation, Shc, Grb2 and SOS, changed in an agonist- and cell-specific manner whereas, SH-PTP1 and SH-PTP2, adaptor proteins reported to interact with SSTRs, translocated from the cytosol to membrane in a cell-specific manner following SST and/or EGF treatment. Although several previous studies have shown crosstalk between RTKs and GPCRs, there are no reports describing SSTR (GPCR) modulation of ErbBs (RTK) in breast cancer.

Recent preclinical and clinical evidence shows that inhibition of growth factor signaling pathways suppresses the growth of malignant cells without serious toxicities. To test the hypothesis that inhibition of the HER1 signaling pathway enhances the antitumor effect of endocrine therapy, a promising signal transduction inhibitor (STI) of HER1 tyrosine kinase, gefitinib, and an estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist, fulvestrant, were administered to human breast cancer cells. Our experimental results have revealed that gefitinib additively enhances the antitumor effect of fulvestrant in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cells under estrogen-supplemented conditions. An additive increase in the protein expression level of a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21 may play a key role of this additive cytostatic effect. The rationale and future perspectives of the combined use of STIs with endocrine therapy in breast cancer are discussed.",

A subpopulation of SMOX(high) cells are resistant to apoptosis, despite their high levels of DNA damage. Because epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation can regulate apoptosis, we determined its role in SMOX-mediated effects.;SMOX, apoptosis, and DNA damage were measured in gastric epithelial cells from H. pylori-infected Egfr(wa5) mice (which have attenuated EGFR activity), Egfr wild-type mice, or in infected cells incubated with EGFR inhibitors or deficient in EGFR. A phosphoproteomic analysis was performed. Two independent tissue microarrays containing each stage of disease, from gastritis to carcinoma, and gastric biopsy specimens from Colombian and Honduran cohorts were analyzed by immunohistochemistry.;SMOX expression and DNA damage were decreased, and apoptosis increased in H. pylori-infected Egfr(wa5) mice. H. pylori-infected cells with deletion or inhibition of EGFR had reduced levels of SMOX, DNA damage, and DNA damage(high) apoptosis(low) cells. Phosphoproteomic analysis showed increased EGFR and erythroblastic leukemia-associated viral oncogene B (ERBB)2 signaling. Immunoblot analysis showed the presence of a phosphorylated (p)EGFR-ERBB2 heterodimer and pERBB2; knockdown of ErbB2 facilitated apoptosis of DNA damage(high) apoptosis(low) cells. SMOX was increased in all stages of gastric disease, peaking in tissues with intestinal metaplasia, whereas pEGFR, pEGFR-ERBB2, and pERBB2 were increased predominantly in tissues showing gastritis or atrophic gastritis. Principal component analysis separated gastritis tissues from patients with cancer vs those without cancer. pEGFR, pEGFR-ERBB2, pERBB2, and SMOX were increased in gastric samples from patients whose disease progressed to intestinal metaplasia or dysplasia, compared with patients whose disease did not progress.;In an analysis of gastric tissues from mice and patients, we identified a molecular signature (based on levels of pEGFR, pERBB2, and SMOX) for the initiation of gastric carcinogenesis.",

We have discovered that endogenous Lpd is in a complex with the EGFR and Lpd and Mena knockdown impairs EGFR endocytosis. Conversely, overexpressing Lpd substantially increases the EGFR uptake in an F-actin-dependent manner, suggesting that F-actin polymerization is limiting for EGFR uptake. Furthermore, we found that Lpd directly interacts with endophilin, a BAR domain containing protein implicated in vesicle fission. We identified a role for endophilin in EGFR endocytosis, which is mediated by Lpd. Consistently, Lpd localizes to clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) just before vesicle scission and regulates vesicle scission. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism in which Lpd mediates EGFR endocytosis via Mena downstream of endophilin. ",

In 50% of such cancers, a secondary EGFR mutation, T790M, has been identified that renders gefitinib and erlotinib ineffective inhibitors of EGFR kinase activity. Thus, there is a clinical need to develop novel EGFR inhibitors that can effectively inactivate T790M-containing EGFR proteins.

Less is known about molecular markers that may predict response to gefitinib in HNSCC patients.;We analyzed possible associations of responsiveness to gefitinib with molecular markers of the EGFR/ErbB receptor family signaling pathway using 10 established HNSCC lines in vitro. IC50 of gefitinib sensitivity was determined using clonogenic survival assays. ErbB signaling was assessed by Western and real-time reverse transcription-PCR analyses of EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 expression levels as well as by phosphorylation analysis of pEGFR, pErbB2, pErbB3, pAkt, and pErk. EGFR sequences encoding kinase domain and EGFR gene copy numbers were determined by cDNA sequencing and real-time PCR, respectively. Finally, responsiveness to gefitinib was compared with responsiveness to the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab (Erbitux).;Expression levels of pErbB2 (P = 0.02) and total ErbB3 protein (P = 0.02) associated with resistance to gefitinib. Combining gefitinib with pertuzumab (Omnitarg), an antibody targeting ErbB2 heterodimerization, provided additional growth-inhibitory effect over gefitinib alone on relatively gefitinib-resistant HNSCC cell lines. The same markers did not predict resistance to cetuximab. In contrast, a similar trend suggesting association between EGFR gene copy number and drug sensitivity was observed for both gefitinib (P = 0.0498) and cetuximab (P = 0.053). No activating EGFR mutations were identified.;EGFR amplification may predict sensitivity to gefitinib in HNSCC. However, other EGFR/ErbB receptor family members than EGFR may contribute to resistance to gefitinib. ErbB2 and ErbB3 may have potential as predictive markers and as therapeutic targets for combination therapy in treatment of HNSCC with gefitinib.",

MET amplification was detected in 4 of 18 (22%) lung cancer specimens that had developed resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib.

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors were studied by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies to cyclooxygenase-2, epidermal growth factor receptor, and CD34. The immunohistochemical results were correlated with clinicopathological features and survival. In our study population, we found a male/female ratio of 72:43, a median age of 59 years, stage III and IV incidence of 66.9%, and a median follow-up of 96 months. Positive expression rates of cyclooxygenase-2 and epidermal growth factor receptor were 89.6 and 23.5%, respectively. The median microvascular density value was 52.5. When this value was determined as the cut-off point, 50% of patients were found to have high microvascular density. Epidermal growth factor receptor over-expression correlated with high microvascular density values, advanced lymph node involvement (N3), and TNM stage presentation (III and IV). Similarly, lymph node involvement was associated with cyclooxygenase-2 over-expression and high microvascular density. Univariate analysis showed that epidermal growth factor receptor over-expression, pathological T3 and T4 disease, and overall stage III and IV disease were adverse prognostic factors. On multivariate analysis using a Cox regression model, expression of epidermal growth factor receptor, and advanced TNM stage were significant adverse prognostic factors for overall survival. Expression of epidermal growth factor receptor in Arab Omani patients with gastric cancer correlates with aggressive tumor characteristics and is an independent prognostic factor.

As these are essential components of receptor-mediated and fluid-phase endocytosis, respectively, we reasoned that IP6 might impair erbB1 endocytosis and associated signaling in human PCA cells, leading to their growth inhibition. IP6 strongly to completely inhibited (26-100%; P < 0.05) transforming growth factor alpha-induced binding of activated erbB1 to AP2 in human PCA DU145 cells, demonstrating the impairment of the initial step in ligand-induced erbB1 endocytosis. IP6 treatment of cells resulted in a dose-dependent increase (1.8- to 7. 7-fold compared with cells treated with ligand alone; P < 0.05) in levels of activated erbB1. These two findings suggest that the inhibitory effect of IP6 on receptor endocytosis is independent of its lack of effect on ligand-induced erbB1 activation. These effects of IP6, however, were associated with strong inhibition of ligand-induced Shc phosphorylation (77-84% decrease; P < 0.05) and its binding to erbB1 (58-100% decrease; P < 0.05). IP6 also significantly and dose-dependently inhibited fluid-phase endocytosis (19-52%; P < 0.05). It inhibited PI3K-AKT signaling pathway as an upstream response in its effect on the inhibition of fluid-phase endocytosis. The inhibition of erbB1 receptor and fluid-phase endocytosis, and associated signaling by IP6, was corroborated by very strong to complete inhibition (70-100%; P < 0.05) of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 activation by IP6. IP6 significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited anchorage-dependent and -independent inhibition (50-100% and 30-75%, respectively) in DU145 cells. Targeting the impairment of erbB1 endocytosis and associated mitogenic signaling by IP6 in advanced and androgen-independent human PCA DU145 cells could be a useful approach for treating PCA.",

Structural dysfunction of the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR is associated with the clinical response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in patients with NSCLC. The most common EGFR gene mutations occur as either deletions in exon 19 or as substitution L858R in exon 21 and cause a clinically beneficial response to gefinitib or erlotinib treatment. Unfortunately, the majority of patients finally develop resistance to these drugs. Acquired resistance is linked to secondary mutations localised in the EGFR gene, mainly substitution T790M in exon 20. Through intense research a few different mechanisms of resistance to reversible tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been identified: amplification of MET or IGF-1R genes, abnormalities of PTEN and mTOR proteins as well as rare mutations in EGFR and HER2 genes. Extensively investigated new drugs could be of significant efficiency in NSCLC patients with secondary resistance to reversible EGFR TKI. ",

Mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene was found in a subset of lung cancers in 2002.

While EGFR-mediated signalling pathways have been well established, there is still a rather limited understanding of how intracellular protein-protein interactions, ubiquitination, endocytosis and subsequent degradation of EGFR contribute to the determination of sensitivity to EGFR targeting agents and are emerging areas of investigation.

Monitoring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) conformation by anisotropy microscopy together with cell-free reconstitution of cytohesin-dependent receptor autophosphorylation indicate that cytohesins facilitate conformational rearrangements in the intracellular domains of dimerized receptors.

Several evidences suggest that cooperation of multiple ErbB receptors and ligands is required for the induction of cell transformation. In this respect, EGFR, upon activation, sustains a complex and redundant network of signal transduction pathways with the contribution of other trans-membrane receptors. EGFR has been found to be expressed and altered in a variety of malignancies and clearly it plays a significant role in tumor development and progression, including cell proliferation, regulation of apoptotic cell death, angiogenesis and metastatic spread. Moreover, amplification of the EGFR gene and mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain have been recently reported in human carcinomas. As a result, investigators have developed approaches to inhibit the effects of EGFR activation, with the aim of blocking tumor growth and invasion.

This group includes the epidermal growth factor receptors, the HER-2/neu (erbB-2), HER-3, and HER-4. Despite the structural similarity of these receptors, HER-2/neu, HER-4, and HER-3 do not bind to any ligand of the epidermal growth factor receptor. However, a 44-kD glycoprotein called neu differentiation factor (neu differentiation factor/heregulin) has been isolated. This ligand phosphorylates the HER-2/neu receptor and binds directly to HER-4 and HER-3. The abundance of erbB receptors and their ligands in breast cancers points to their functional importance in the pathogenesis and biological behavior of breast cancers. Furthermore, these receptors and ligands may hold a promise for targeted therapy for breast cancer in the future.",

On comparison of the CRC primary tumor and matched adjacent normal mucosa (ANM) tissue samples, the mRNA expression levels of ErbB3, but not ErbB1, were significantly increased in CRC tissue samples, compared with those in the ANM tissues. The expression levels of the ligands exhibited opposing trends to their corresponding receptors, including EGF, BTC, AREG, EREG and HB‑EGF, which were increased in the CRC tissues, whereas NRG1 and NGR2 were decreased in thee CRC tissues, compared with those in the AMN tissues. Subsequently, the present study investigated the frequency of K-ras mutations in the patients with CRC. The K‑ras mutations were found to be present in 36.8% (45/122) of the cases, however, no correlation was observed between K‑ras mutations and clinicopathological characteristics. In the CRC tissues, the expression levels of the EGFR family receptors and their ligands were determined in wild-type and mutant K-ras CRC cases. The expression levels of ErbB1, ErbB2, ErbB3, BTC, AREG, EREG, NRG1 and NRG2 were significantly decreased in the mutant K‑ras cases, compared with those in the wild‑type K‑ras cases. These results suggested that the tumorigenesis of CRC with wild‑type K‑ras was mediated through, not only ErbB1, but also through the ErbB2 and ErbB3 pathways. Notably, although ErbB2 does not bind any ErbB ligands, ErbB2 may activate tumorigenesis via a heterodimer, rather than a homodimer. Therefore, the results of the present study suggest that the most effective strategy to target not only ErbB1, but also ErbB2 and ErbB3, is the use of monoclonal antibody treatment.",

We examined the effect of the selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) gefitinib (\"Iressa\") in combination with the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor CPT-11 (irinotecan) on human colorectal cancer cells. EGFR mRNA and protein expression were detected by RT-PCR and immunoblotting in all 7 colorectal cancer cell lines studied. Gefitinib inhibited the cell growth of the cancer cell lines in vitro with an IC(50) range of 1.2-160 microM by 3,(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Lovo cells exhibited the highest level of protein and autophosphorylation of EGFR and were the most sensitive to gefitinib. The combination of gefitinib and CPT-11 induced supra-additive inhibitory effects in COLO320DM, WiDR and Lovo cells, assessed by an in vitro MTT assay. Administration of gefitinib and CPT-11 had a supra-additive inhibitory effect on WiDR cells and tumor shrinkage was observed in Lovo cell xenografts established in nude mice, whereas no additive effect of combination therapy was observed in COLO320DM cells. To elucidate the mechanisms of synergistic effects, the effect of CPT-11-exposure on phosphorylation of EGFR was examined by immunoprecipitation. CPT-11 increased phosphorylation of EGFR in Lovo and WiDR cells in time- and dose-dependent manners. This EGFR activation was completely inhibited by 5 microM gefitinib and gefitinib-induced apoptosis was enhanced by combination with CPT-11, measured by PARP activation although no PARP activation was induced by 5 microM CPT-11 alone. These results suggested that these modification of EGFR by CPT-11, in Lovo cells, is a possible mechanism for the synergistic effect of CPT-11 and gefitinib. These findings imply that the EGFR-TKI gefitinib and CPT-11 will be effective against colorectal tumor cells that express high levels of EGFR, and support clinical evaluation of gefitinib in combination with CPT-11, in the treatment of colorectal cancers.",

Our particular emphasis in this review will be on how ErbB receptors, in particular ErbB1 and ErbB2, contribute to processes linked to cancer progression.

EGFR has become a model protein for understanding the biology and endocytosis of related growth-factor receptors, and the mechanisms involved in its endocytosis and degradation have been scrutinized for several decades. Nevertheless, the details and principles of these processes are still poorly understood and often controversial. In particular, the literature describing how the ubiquitylation and recruitment of EGFR to clathrin-coated pits are connected is inconsistent and confusing. In this Opinion article, we discuss the impact of signaling motifs, kinase activity and ubiquitylation on clathrin-dependent endocytosis and lysosomal sorting of EGFR.

In animal models, ultraviolet-B is a complete carcinogen, capable of inducing and promoting the development of malignant cells. A key element of ultraviolet-B-induced carcinogenesis is the ability of ultraviolet-B to induce the expression of a number of cellular proteins and activate growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases, including the erbB receptor family. Keratinocytes express the erbB1 (also called EGF-R, HER1), the erbB2 (also known as neu or HER2), and the erbB3 (HER3) subtypes. In general, activation of the erbB receptor family leads to a cellular proliferative response. In certain instances, however, activation of an erbB receptor can induce differentiation, cell cycle arrest, and even apoptosis. The inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity in rodent models and human skin has been shown to inhibit some ultraviolet-B response pathways. We have shown that the inhibition of erbB receptors, by both pharmaceutical and immunologic means, will inhibit ultraviolet-B-induced apoptosis in the HaCaT human keratinocyte cell line. This inhibition was specific for the erbB receptor family and specific for ultraviolet-B-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that, in certain instances, ultraviolet-B-induced apoptotic signaling requires erbB family receptor activity.",

Through the available literature on NCBI and clinical trials, 31 clinical trials in which cetuximab or panitumumab as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy were used for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer patients in different line settings and 12 clinical trials in which bevacizumab was used for being compared with anti epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies or chemotherapy were chosen for reviewing and comparing the results of overall survival, progression free survival and adverse effects. Cetuximab and panitumumab are well accepted for the treatment of mCRC patients at all stages in different line settings.

The epidermal growth factor receptor-targeting potential of these novel structures was studied by ELISA for isolated epidermal growth factor receptor and by Western blotting for whole-cell assays. DNA damage was analyzed using the single-cell microelectrophoresis comet assay. Antiproliferative effects were determined by the sulforhodamine B assay.

Targeting ErbBs by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) may therefore limit esophageal cancer cell migration. Here, we studied the impact of TKIs on ErbB dimerization, cell signaling pathways, and cell migration in three esophageal cell lines: OE21 (ESCC), OE33 (EAC), and Het-1A (non-neoplastic esophageal epithelium). In OE21 cells, the TKIs erlotinib, gefitinib, and lapatinib slightly affected epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR/EGFR, but not EGFR/HER2 dimerization as detected by in situ proximity ligation assay (in situ PLA). Still, TKIs inhibited ERK1/2, Akt, STAT3, and RhoA activity in OE21 cells, as assessed by Western blot, antibody arrays, and Rho GTPase effector pull-down assays. This was accompanied by reduced OE21 cell migration, induction of focal adhesions, and actin cytoskeleton reorganization, as shown by Oris™ migration assay and focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/phalloidin staining. In contrast, in OE33 cells, only lapatinib decreased STAT5, Src family kinase (SFK), and FAK activity as well as β-catenin expression. This impeded cell migration and induced morphological changes in OE33 cells. No alterations were seen for the non-neoplastic Het-1A cells. Thus, we identified the ErbB signaling network as regulator of esophageal cancer cell's actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesions, and cell migration. ErbB targeted TKIs therefore also limit ESCC and EAC cell motility and migration.;Clinical tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) reduce esophageal cancer cell migration. Loss of cell migration is linked to reduced Akt, ERK1/2, STAT (3 or 5), FAK, SFKs, and RhoA activity. Clinical TKIs act via distinct signaling in the two main histotypes of esophageal cancer.",

Various growth factors, including epidermal growth factor receptor, have been shown to influence pituitary tumor growth and differentiation. To analyze the role of epidermal growth factor receptor in pituitary tumor development, we examined normal pituitaries (n=8), pituitary adenomas (n=158), and pituitary carcinomas (n=7) for expression of epidermal growth factor receptor protein and messenger RNA using tissue microarrays and RT-PCR. We also examined (a) the expression of phospho-epidermal growth factor receptor, the activated form of epidermal growth factor receptor, in pituitary tumors and normal pituitaries by immunohistochemistry and (b) the effects on epidermal growth factor receptor expression of treating pituitary cells (HP75 cell line) with epidermal growth factor. Epidermal growth factor receptor and the phosphorylated variant expression were present in normal pituitary cells. Epidermal growth factor receptor messenger RNA was also detected in normal pituitaries, pituitary adenomas, and carcinomas by in situ hybridization and RT-PCR. Most pituitary adenomas showed expression of epidermal growth factor receptor and the phosphorylated variant. Nonfunctional adenomas showed higher levels of expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (76 vs 34%) and of phospho-epidermal growth factor receptor (26 vs 8%) as compared to functional adenomas. Five of seven pituitary carcinomas showed strong expression of both epidermal growth factor receptor and phospho-epidermal growth factor receptor. When a human pituitary cell line (HP75) was cultured in the presence of epidermal growth factor receptor, there was an increase in the levels of both epidermal growth factor receptor and phospho-epidermal growth factor receptor after 5 h of treatment, thus confirming that epidermal growth factor receptor signaling was active in pituitary tumors. These results indicate that activated epidermal growth factor receptor is expressed in pituitary adenomas and carcinomas. Higher levels in pituitary carcinomas suggest a role in pituitary tumor progression.",

Unfortunately, most tumors will inevitably develop resistance to trastuzumab, necessitating the need for alternate HER2-directed therapeutic approaches. Recent advances in our understanding of the interaction between HER2 and other members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family have led to identification of newer agents, resulting in the expansion of the clinical armamentarium of available agents for the treatment of HER2-positive tumors.

To explore protein expressional differences in primary and metastatic gastric carcinoma, we evaluated the expressions of 32 tumor-associated proteins in 250 pairs of primary and metastatic gastric carcinoma tissues by immunohistochemistry using tissue array slides. In metastatic gastric carcinomas, the expressions of epidermal growth factor receptor, c-erbB2, and trefoil factor 1(TFF-1) were higher and those of beta-catenin, E-cadherin, fragile histone triad gene (FHIT), glutathione S transferase-pi (GST-pi), kangai 1 (KAI1), and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) were lower than in primary gastric carcinomas. Furthermore, the expressions of beta-catenin, E-cadherin, KAI1, and NF-kappaB were associated with an advanced T and combined stage. In addition, the loss of E-cadherin expression during lymph node metastasis or E-cadherin immunonegativity in metastatic lesions and epidermal growth factor receptor expression in primary gastric carcinomas were independently associated with a poor prognosis by multivariate analysis. In conclusion, the expression of some tumor-associated proteins and their prognostic significance in metastatic gastric carcinomas differ from those in primary tumors. Consequently, analysis of both metastatic gastric carcinomas and their primary counterparts may be required to fully determine the molecular characteristics of node-positive gastric carcinoma.",

Targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor represents a promising molecular approach in cancer treatment. Several antiepidermal growth factor receptor agents are in clinical development. This review focuses on the available clinical data on epidermal growth factor receptor-targeting drugs in the treatment of nonsmall cell lung cancer.;Three drugs are currently in phase 2 and phase 3 development as single agents or in combination with other anticancer therapies in nonsmall cell lung cancer patients: cetuximab (Erbitux), a chimeric human-mouse monoclonal IgG1 antibody that blocks ligand binding and functional epidermal growth factor receptor activation; and erlotinib (Tarceva) and gefitinib (Iressa), two orally bioavailable, small-molecule epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors of tyrosine kinase enzymatic activity that prevent epidermal growth factor receptor autophosphorylation and activation. Single-agent gefitinib treatment has determined a 10 to 20% response rate and a 30 to 50% symptom improvement in previously treated, chemotherapy-refractory advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer patients. Gefitinib has been the first epidermal growth factor receptor-targeting agent to be registered as an anticancer drug in several countries, including Japan, Australia, and the United States, for the third-line treatment of chemoresistant nonsmall cell lung cancer patients.;Antiepidermal growth factor receptor has shown promising antitumor activity in nonsmall cell lung cancer patients with a mild toxicity profile.

Studies from our laboratory identified targeted therapy as a way to treat cancer. Rational therapeutics targeting and disabling erbB receptors have been developed to reverse the malignant properties of tumors. Reversal of the malignant phenotype, best seen with disabling the HER2 receptors using monoclonal antibodies is a distinct process from that seen with blocking of ligand binding to cognate receptors as has been done for EGFr receptors. Here we review the mechanisms of action deduced from a number of approaches developed in our laboratory and elsewhere, including monoclonal antibodies, peptide mimetics, recombinant proteins and small molecules.

        "Doc_abstract":"Despite the approval of the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), cetuximab and panitumumab, for the treatment of colorectal cancer patients, there is currently no reliable predictive marker for response to therapy. In addition, the duration of response is often limited. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of afatinib, an irreversible erbB family blocker, as a single agent or in combination with cytotoxic drugs (5-fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin) or mAb ICR62 on the proliferation of a panel of human colorectal tumour cell lines and the association between the expression levels of the EGFR family members and response to treatment. Of the cells examined, EGFR-overexpressing DiFi cells were the most sensitive to treatment with both afatinib (IC50=45 nM) and ICR62 (IC50=4.33 nM). Afatinib also inhibited the growth of other tumour cell lines with IC50 values which ranged from 0.33 µM (CCL-221) to 1.62 µM (HCT-116). A significant association was found between the co-expression of EGFR, human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2 and HER-3 and response to treatment with afatinib (R=0.915, P=0.021). Treat-ment with afatinib and cytotoxic drugs was accompanied by an increase in the proportion of these cells in the sub-G0/G1 and in the S and G2/M phase of the cell cycle, respectively. We conclude that afatinib as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs shows activity in colorectal tumour cells and that determination of the co-expression of HER family members should be conducted in clinical trials using drugs targeting erbB signaling. This approach could lead to the identification of a specific subpopulation of cancer patients more likely to benefit from erbB-directed therapy.",

Stomach specimens (N = 165) were stained for PGII and two tumour markers, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr) and p53. PGII was more likely to be expressed with moderate or extensive IM than with minimal or no IM (P = 0.05).

Of 25 cases that expressed all three markers (PGII, EGFr, p53), 20 (80%) had stage 3 or 4 disease, compared with 11 (37%) advanced cancers expressing none of the markers (P = 0.001). Cancers expressing one or two markers were between these extremes.;PGII+ cancers in IM-associated gastric cancers may derive from residual gastric glands, or may arise from postinduction reversion to a gastric phenotype from intestinalized cells.

Using machine learning analysis applied to the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia database, we identified expression of AXL, the gene that encodes the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL, as exceptionally predictive of lack of response to ErbB family receptor-targeted inhibitors. Activation of EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) transactivated AXL, and this ligand-independent AXL activity diversified EGFR-induced signaling into additional downstream pathways beyond those triggered by EGFR alone. AXL-mediated signaling diversification was required for EGF (epidermal growth factor)-elicited motility responses in AXL-positive TNBC (triple-negative breast cancer) cells. Using cross-linking coimmunoprecipitation assays, we determined that AXL associated with EGFR, other ErbB receptor family members, MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor), and PDGFR (platelet-derived growth factor receptor) but not IGF1R (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor) or INSR (insulin receptor). From these AXL interaction data, we predicted AXL-mediated signaling synergy for additional RTKs and validated these predictions in cells. This alternative mechanism of receptor activation limits the use of ligand-blocking therapies and indicates against therapy withdrawal after acquired resistance. Further, subadditive interaction between EGFR- and AXL-targeted inhibitors across all AXL-positive TNBC cell lines may indicate that increased abundance of EGFR is principally a means to transactivation-mediated signaling.

EGFR is abnormally activated by various mechanisms like receptor overexpression, mutation, ligand-dependent receptor dimerization, ligand-independent activation and is associated with the development of variety of human cancers. EGFR inhibition is one of the key targets for cancer chemotherapy.

This observation suggests a potential role for nuclear EGFR in bladder cancer. We confirmed that EGFR could be induced to transit to nuclei in cultured human bladder cancer cells in response to the urothelial cell growth factor and EGFR ligand heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF). Mass spectrometric analysis of EGFR immune complexes from a transitional carcinoma cell line (TCCSUP) identified the phosphoinositide kinase, PIKfyve, as a potential component of the EGFR trafficking mechanism. RNA silencing indicated that PIKfyve is a mediator of HB-EGF-stimulated EGFR nuclear trafficking, EGFR binding to the cyclin D1 promoter, and cell cycle progression.

Addition of SLO did not affect either ERK1/2 or Akt kinases and altered the expression of only 10 of 84 metastasis-related genes in MDA-MB-231 cells. Neither SLO nor EGF promoted growth of several human breast cancer cell lines.

Because of its resistance to degradation, ErbB2 is the preferred dimerization partner for other members of the ErbB family, and its overexpression in vivo is associated with poor prognosis. We now show that the chaperone-binding ubiquitin ligase CHIP efficiently ubiquitinates and down-regulates ErbB2. CHIP expression shortens the half-life of both nascent and mature ErbB2 protein. In vitro ubiquitination assay shows that CHIP serves as a ubiquitin ligase for ErbB2, and both exogenously expressed and endogenous CHIP coprecipitate with the kinase. Furthermore, CHIP association with ErbB2 requires a chaperone intermediate and is increased by the chaperone-binding drug geldanamycin, a potent stimulator of ErbB2 ubiquitination and degradation.

In addition, delphinidin, quercetin and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) were found to suppress the phosphorylation of the ErbB2 receptor, with delphinidin exhibiting the strongest inhibitory properties. Their potency to suppress the ErbB2 receptor phosphorylation can be summarised as delphinidin > EGCG > quercetin. The effectiveness of delphinidin against the EGFR and the ErbB2 receptor was comparable, indicating a broader spectrum of activity against receptor tyrosine kinases. At low micromolar concentrations delphinidin showed some preference towards the ErbB2 receptor.

Immunotherapy targeting EGFR-overexpressing malignancies using genetically modified immune effector cells is a novel and promising approach. In the present study, we have developed an adoptive cellular immunotherapy strategy based on the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified cytokine-induced killer (CAR-CIK) cells specific for the tumor cells expressing EGFR. To generate CAR-CIK cells, a lentiviral vector coding the EGFR-specific CAR was constructed and transduced into the CIK cells. The CAR-CIK cells showed significantly enhanced cytotoxicity and increased production of cytokines IFN-γ and IL-2 when co-cultured with EGFR-positive cancer cells. In tumor xenografts, adoptive immunotherapy of CAR-CIK cells could inhibit tumor growth and prolong the survival of EGFR-overexpressing human tumor xenografts. Moreover, tumor growth inhibition and prolonged survival in mice with EGFR(+) human cancer were associated with the increased persistence of CAR-CIK cells in vivo. Our study indicates that modification with EGFR-specific CAR strongly enhances the antitumor activity of the CIK cells against EGFR-positive malignancies.",

Here, we examine the effect of coexpressing varying levels of HERs 1-3 on the receptor dimerization patterns using a detailed kinetic model for HER/ErbB dimerization and trafficking. Our results indicate that coexpression of EGFR with HER2 or HER3 biases signaling to the cell surface and retards signal downregulation. In addition, simultaneous coexpression of HERs 1-3 leads to an abundance of HER2-HER3 heterodimers, which are known to be potent inducers of cell growth and transformation. Our new approach to use parameter dependence analysis in experimental design reveals that measurements of HER3 phosphorylation and HER2 internalization ratio may prove to be especially useful for the estimation of critical model parameters. Further, we examine the effect of receptor dimerization patterns on biological response using a simple phenomenological model.

In addition, ErbB receptor family members are commonly amplified and overexpressed in various human neoplasms and tumor-derived cell lines, where it is believed that increased signalling as a result of receptor overexpression may play an important role in oncogenesis. Consequently, ErbB receptor family members are being investigated rigorously as potential biomarkers of cancer and as therapeutic targets in malignant tissues. Numerous studies now demonstrate the existence of \"soluble\" ErbB (sErbB) analogs in normal and cancerous tissues. These sErbB proteins embody the extracellular domain (ECD) of the receptor only; they are generated by either proteolytic cleavage or from truncated, alternatively spliced mRNA transcripts. Recently, we have identified an alternate transcript of the human c-erbB1 (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) proto-oncogene from placenta that encodes a sErbB1 protein of 60-kDa. This protein, p60 sErbB1, is glycosylated and secreted when expressed in transfected tissue culture cells in vitro. Although \"soluble\" receptor analogs may play important physiological roles in intercellular communication, tissue morphogenesis, tissue regeneration and repair, and embryogenesis by inhibiting or stimulating specific mitogenic and pattern forming signals, their mechanism of action has not been thoroughly elucidated. To further characterize sErbB1 expression in human tissues and cell lines and to better understand their role in carcinogenesis and normal development, we have generated monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) toward specific peptide epitopes of ErbB1 extracellular subdomains III and IV.

The functional contribution of epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent Bcl-x(L) expression to keratinocyte survival is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase activity with either an epidermal growth factor receptor antagonistic monoclonal antibody (MoAb 425) or an epidermal growth factor receptor-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor (AG 1478) downregulated Bcl-x(L) expression in normal human keratinocytes but had no effect on expression of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homologs Bad, Bak, and Bax. Bovine pituitary extract and insulin partially alleviated both, downregulation of Bcl-x(L) expression and cell death upon epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition. Forced expression of Bcl-x(L) attenuated cell death of immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT) induced by either forced suspension (anoikis) or by epidermal growth factor receptor blockade.

We obtained paired samples from the tumor and the adjacent normal tissue from the same patient undergoing surgery for gastric cancer. Using RT-qPCR, we quantified the mRNA expression of the four receptors including the HER4 splicing isoforms and all the ligands activating these receptors.

We found that HER2 mRNA expression was upregulated in the tumor tissue compared to the matched normal tissue (p = 0.0520). All ligands with affinity for EGFR were upregulated, whereas the expression of EGFR was unchanged. Interestingly, we found the mRNA expression of HER4 (p = 0.0002) and its ligand NRG4 (p = 0.0009) to be downregulated in the tumor tissue compared to the matched normal tissue. HER4 downregulation was demonstrated for all the alternatively spliced isoforms of this receptor. These results support the involvement of EGFR and HER2 in gastric cancer and suggest an interesting association of reduced HER4 expression with development of gastric cancer. ",

At the end of each feeding period, animals were sacrificed and the stomach was dissected for the sample preparation. EtOH caused a time-dependent alteration (r = 0.89) of the 125I-epidermal growth factor binding to the gastric mucosal membrane (% control: week 2, 114%; week 4, 64%* and week 6, 45%*, n = 5, *P < 0.05). Protein kinase analysis also showed that EtOH caused a time-dependent decrease of epidermal growth factor-stimulated autophosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor protein (180 kDa) during three feeding periods. Western blot analysis, using anti-tyrosine phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (active form) antibody, revealed a major immunoreactive protein band (180 kDa) in all samples pre-incubated with 1 microM epidermal growth factor. Consistent with data from kinase analysis, treatment of EtOH decreased the immunoreactivity of the active form of epidermal growth factor receptor (180 kDa) in the stomach. In conclusion, EtOH feeding caused a time-dependent alteration of epidermal growth factor receptor in the stomach, which may be one of the mechanisms underlying the gastric pathology associated with alcohol abuse.",

However, only HER2 is currently used for therapy indications and new predictors for the treatment with lapatinib are sought.;This minireview focuses on lapatinib and its role in breast cancer treatment. Preclinical and clinical studies as well as pharmacological characteristics are briefly reviewed while the focus is on efficacy assessment including predictive factors for therapy outcome.;Lapatinib (Tykerb/Tyverb) was Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved in 2007 for use in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of HER2-positive advanced or metastatic breast cancer in patients who had received previous treatment (including anthracycline, taxane and trastuzumab containing regimens) and in 2010 for use in combination with letrozole for postmenopausal women with hormonal receptor positive and HER2- positive metastatic breast cancer. In contrast to trastuzumab (Herceptin), lapatinib is orally administered and it targets both HER2 and HER1 receptors. As a synthetic and oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), it is convenient, cheaper and easier to produce than monoclonal antibodies. The recommended dosage is not dependent on body weight either. Lapatinib plasma level measurement could be an approach to tailored therapy for further optimizing the dose and prolonging this efficient therapy. New lapatinib response predictors are being evaluated. At this time, only HER2 amplification/overexpression is used to choose lapatinib therapy candidates. Further studies on concurrent HER1 fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)/immunohistochemistry (IHC) assessment and/or microarray analyses may produce new data on the predictive role of the HER1 (EGFR) gene/protein.

Helicobacter pylori infection, dietary factors, lifestyle influences and various genetic aberrations have been shown to contribute to the development and progression of gastric cancer. Recent studies on the genomic landscape of gastric adenocarcinoma have identified several key signaling molecules, including epidermal growth factor receptor family (ErbB) members, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor family (VEGFR) members and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway components, that have been implicated in the molecular pathogenesis of gastric cancers. However, clinical trials with compounds that target these molecules have failed to show a significant improvement in overall survival rates when supplemented with conventional therapies. Therefore, it is essential to identify effective prognostic and/or diagnostic biomarkers and develop molecular targeted therapies. The JAK/STAT cascade is a principal signal transduction pathway in cytokine and growth factor signaling, regulating various cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and survival. Numerous in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that dysregulated JAK/STAT signaling is a driving force in the pathogenesis of various solid cancers as well as hematopoietic malignancies. Hence, a large number of preclinical and clinical studies of drugs targeting this pathway are currently underway. Notably, aberrant JAK/STAT signaling has also been implicated in gastric cancers. In this review, we focus on the ongoing research on the JAK/STAT cascade in gastric carcinoma and discuss the therapeutic potential of targeting JAK/STAT signaling for the treatment of gastric cancer.",

The focus of SCCHN therapy has more recently shifted to the molecular level, particularly the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB) pathway. Several agents that target the EGFR pathway, including monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, are under investigation for SCCHN. Searches of PubMed and results of key oncology congresses were performed to identify relevant articles and abstracts. The EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibody cetuximab is approved for the treatment of locally advanced SCCHN in combination with radiotherapy, for first-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic SCCHN in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy and 5-fluorouracil, and for recurrent or metastatic SCCHN following progression with platinum-based chemotherapy. Other investigational EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibodies (e.g., panitumumab, nimotuzumab, zalutumumab) are in clinical development for SCCHN. Inhibition of the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR has also been explored as a therapeutic approach in SCCHN using small-molecule reversible inhibitors, such as gefitinib and erlotinib. However, a key challenge in SCCHN is the development of resistance, and strategies are being pursued to delay or overcome resistance to EGFR-targeted agents. These strategies include development of agents that inhibit multiple ErbB receptors simultaneously (e.g., lapatinib) or that bind multiple ErbB family receptors irreversibly (e.g., afatinib, PF-00299804) and investigation of combinations of agents that target multiple pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of SCCHN.

Targeting these driver mutations, such as sensitizing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, has dramatically improved the prognosis of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the clinical benefit of molecularly targeted therapy on NSCLC appears to be different between lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas (SqCCs). We report here that the resistance of lung SqCC harboring EGFR mutations to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) was due to the activation of BMP-BMPR-Smad1/5-p70S6K. The combined treatment of these tumor cells with EGFR-TKI, together with inhibitors specific to BMPR or downstream mTOR, effectively reversed the resistance to EGFR-TKI. Moreover, blocking the whole PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway with the PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor BEZ235 also showed efficacy in treating this subtype of lung SqCC.

Based on promising preclinical results, lapatinib is being extensively studied in cancer patients. In Phase I clinical trials, the side effect profile of lapatinib results are favorable, with a few patients experiencing serious toxicity. Phase II studies showed that lapatinib has meaningful clinical activity in the setting of HER2-positive advanced breast cancer patients. Unfortunately, its activity in epidermal growth factor receptor-dominated cancers, such as colorectal cancer or squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, is modest. An extensive program is now ongoing in breast cancer patients to establish the correct role of lapatinib in this clinical setting.

No activating EGFR mutations were found and gefitinib alone was only weakly effective in gastric cancer cell lines. However, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) significantly enhanced the inhibitory effects of gefitinib indicating synergistic action. Whole genome expression profiling indicated significant regulation of 120 genes in the case of co-administration of gefitinib and ASA (32 induced, 88 repressed) in gastric adenocarcinoma cells. Further analyses indicated that several important signalling pathways were effectively inhibited by simultaneous exposure to gefitinib and ASA. Our findings indicate that although gastric cancer does not seem to harbour mutations which render the cancer cells constitutively susceptible to gefitinib, the co-administration of ASA can strengthen RTK inhibitor activity in adenocarcinoma cells by EGFR activation.

The aim of this study was to investigate epidermal growth factor receptor immunohistochemical expression and epidermal growth factor receptor gene amplification in 82 consecutive gastrointestinal stromal tumor cases using tissue microarray technique. Hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections and clinical information were reviewed, and expression of CD117 (KIT), CD34 and epidermal growth factor receptor was investigated by immunohistochemistry. Epidermal growth factor receptor gene copy number was determined using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Immunohistochemistry revealed that CD117 and CD34 were expressed in 96 and 57% of tumors, respectively. Variable epidermal growth factor receptor protein immunohistochemical overexpression was detected in 96% of gastrointestinal stromal tumor cases, but none of the 75 cases with represented tumor tissue cores and countable fluorescence signals exhibited epidermal growth factor receptor gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization. These results show that there is no correlation between epidermal growth factor receptor protein overexpression by immunohistochemistry and epidermal growth factor receptor gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

One tissue block for each of 88 primary tumors and 60 paired primary tumors and metastases was examined for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status by immunohistochemistry using 3 different antibodies (HercepTest, CB11, and 4B5) and by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Two additional tissue blocks of the primary tumor were tested by immunohistochemistry if the results were negative on the first tissue block. The concordance among the 3 antibodies was 94.5% (testing 1 tissue block). Two cases showed a clinically significant discrepancy between primary tumor (score 0) and lymph nodes metastases (score 3+). Additional block analysis increased both the sensitivity (from 63% to 83%) and the accuracy (from 91% to 94%) of immunohistochemistry as compared with fluorescent in situ hybridization. The multiblock approach could potentially identify a greater number of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive gastric cancers, particularly those with higher levels of intratumor heterogeneity. In turn, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positivity correlated with a worse prognosis (P=.011) and was an independent variable in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 1.57).

Although they might improve safety and delay onset of chemoresistance, no anti-ligand antibodies have been clinically approved. To identify suitable ligands, we surveyed fluids from ovarian and lung cancer patients and found that amphiregulin (AREG) is the most abundant and generalized ligand secreted by advanced tumors. AREG is a low affinity EGFR ligand, which is upregulated following treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs. Because AREG depletion retarded growth of xenografted ovarian tumors in mice, we generated a neutralizing monoclonal anti-AREG antibody. The antibody inhibited growth of ovarian cancer xenografts and strongly enhanced chemotherapy efficacy. Taken together, these results raise the possibility that AREG and other low- or high-affinity binders of EGFR might serve as potential targets for cancer therapy. ",

The critical role played by epidermal growth factor receptor in cancer has resulted in extensive research for selective inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor signalling pathway. Selective small molecule epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as ZD1839 (Iressa), block signal transduction pathways implicated in proliferation and survival of cancer cells and other host-dependent processes promoting cancer cell growth. In preclinical studies, ZD1839, alone and in combination with other agents, has demonstrated antitumour activity in a range of tumour types. Results from Phase I trials, in healthy volunteers and in patients with advanced disease, have shown that ZD1839 has excellent bioavailability and an acceptable tolerability profile. In these studies, ZD1839 has also shown promising clinical activity in patients with a variety of tumour types. Furthermore, Phase II studies confirmed clinically meaningful antitumour activity and have demonstrated symptom relief in the second- and third-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Phase III trials are currently evaluating ZD1839 in combination with gemcitabine/cisplatin or paclitaxel/carboplatin as first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer and an ongoing clinical trial programme is investigating other tumours (i.e., head and neck, prostate, colon and breast) and other combinations.

To begin addressing such open questions in an animal model, we have developed a transgenic line in which an oncogenic Neu cDNA (Neu*) driven by the probasin gene promoter is overexpressed in the mouse prostate and causes development of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) that progresses to invasive carcinoma. Expression profiling using microarrays, which was selectively validated and extended by immunophenotyping of Neu*-induced PIN and CAP, led to the identification of some novel biomarkers and also revealed increased expression of Egfr, Erbb3 and phosphorylated androgen receptor. In view of this information from our mouse model, which can be used to analyze further the role of Erbb signaling in prostatic tumorigenesis, we examined human prostate cancer tissue arrays by immunohistochemistry. Based on statistical analyses of the results, we propose the testable hypothesis that ERBB3, shown to be expressed in 86% of the human CAP cases that we examined, is the pivotal element of the Erbb pathway promoting tumorigenesis by heterodimerization with NEU or EGFR, while a NEU/EGFR dimer does not appear to play a significant role in CAP.",

We demonstrate that NDRG1 markedly decreased the expression and activation of EGFR, HER2, and HER3 in response to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) ligand, while also inhibiting formation of the EGFR/HER2 and HER2/HER3 heterodimers. In addition, NDRG1 also decreased activation of the downstream MAPKK in response to EGF. Moreover, novel anti-tumor agents of the di-2-pyridylketone class of thiosemicarbazones, namely di-2-pyridylketone 4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone and di-2-pyridylketone 4-cyclohexyl-4-methyl-3-thiosemicarbazone, which markedly up-regulate NDRG1, were found to inhibit EGFR, HER2, and HER3 expression and phosphorylation in cancer cells. However, the mechanism involved appeared dependent on NDRG1 for di-2-pyridylketone 4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone, but was independent of this metastasis suppressor for di-2-pyridylketone 4-cyclohexyl-4-methyl-3-thiosemicarbazone. This observation demonstrates that small structural changes in thiosemicarbazones result in marked alterations in molecular targeting. Collectively, these results reveal a mechanism for the extensive downstream effects on cellular signaling attributed to NDRG1. Furthermore, this study identifies a novel approach for the treatment of tumors resistant to traditional EGFR inhibitors. ",

MAbs have been developed that are specific for many tumorigenic molecules and receptors. They can potentially be used to treat a range of solid tumors. Among the most promising targets for therapy are members of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER/ErbB) family, particularly HER1 and HER2. Several MAbs have been produced that are directed against HER1. One of these agents, cetuximab (Erbitux), is now advanced in clinical development. HER2 is also a key target and methods are being investigated to maximize the effect of using MAbs to inhibit this receptor. One approach aims to augment the efficacy of trastuzumab (Herceptin) by coupling it to a chemotherapeutic agent, thus enabling the delivery of cytotoxic therapy at a cellular level. Another opportunity is based on research that shows that HER2 acts as a dimerization partner for other HER receptors and consequently is important in HER-ligand-dependent tumor growth. Therefore, anti-HER2 MAbs that inhibit the association of HER2 with other HER family members have the potential to be highly effective. This article reviews some of these alternative approaches to MAb-based anti-HER therapy that will hopefully improve treatment outcome for patients with a range of solid tumors.",

We evaluated the antitumor             effects of lapatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor which simultaneously inhibits             EGFR and HER2, 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) alone and in combination on esophageal cancer             cells. The antiproliferative activity of lapatinib, 5-Fu and lapatinib plus 5-Fu             was measured by MTT assay and the combination index (CI) values were calculated.             Additionally, cell cycle distribution of lapatinib alone and the combination with             5-Fu were detected by flow cytometry analysis. Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide             stain were used for analyzing the apoptotic cells after cells were treated with             either agent alone or in combination. The EGFR and HER2 activated signaling pathways             were monitored by western blotting. The combination of lapatinib and 5-Fu synergistically             inhibited cell proliferation and exhibited an enhanced proapoptotic effect on             esophageal cancer cells. The potentiation effect of combined treatment was associated             with downregulation of EGFR and HER2 signaling pathways because data from western             blot analysis showed that lapatinib in combination with 5-Fu markedly reduced             the phosphorylation of EGFR and HER2, and inhibited the activation of downstream             signaling molecules, such as AKT and ERK. A significant G1 arrest was also observed             in cell cycle analysis after exposing cells to lapatinib, however, combination             with 5-Fu did not enhance G1 arrest.

Since ERBB3 lacks intrinsic kinase activity, signal transduction occurs through formation of heterodimers with EGFR, ERBB2, and ERBB4. ERBB3 is a signaling specialist since it has six binding sites for the p85 SH2 adapter subunit of phosphoinositide 3' kinases. These lipid kinases coordinate regulation of metabolism, cell size, proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis. Not surprisingly, ERBB3 signaling has been linked to cancer etiology and progression. In breast cancer, the partnership of ERBB2 and ERBB3 may be crucial for the aggressive properties of cancers with ERBB2 amplification, and may contribute to pre-existing and acquired resistance to therapy. This partnership creates opportunities for improving efficacy of ERBB-targeted pharmaceuticals, by interfering with coupling of ERBB2 to ERBB3 through dimerization inhibitors, and by use of therapeutic compounds that target AKT-dependent pathways activated through ERBB3. Additional therapeutic opportunities may be identified through better understanding of how ERBBs are regulated and deployed in normal mammary gland processes. Work using mouse models has identified the main processes regulated by each of the four ERBBs, which has practical implications in understanding breast cancer etiology, and eventual development of better prognostic, predictive, and therapeutic tools.",

The description of the anilinoquinazoline class of potent and selective TK inhibitors led to several candidate drugs from this chemical class, for example gefitinib ('Iressa') and erlotinib ('Tarceva'), which are being evaluated in breast cancer patients. Rapid advances in cancer molecular genetics have identified numerous potential drug targets associated with abnormal control of cell division either downstream of the ErbBs, for example Ras and MEK, or in erbB-associated signalling networks, like Src kinase, which affect the tumour cell motility and invasiveness. Candidate drugs for several of these targets are currently being evaluated; for example, the prenylation inhibitor AZD3409, a mimetic of the CAAX box of K-Ras, inhibits protein farnesyl and geranylgeranyl tranferases and a novel, selective, orally active Src kinase inhibitor AZD0530 have entered Phase I clinical trials and may have utility in breast cancer therapy.",

Central to the signaling of these receptors is their intracellular kinase domain, which is activated by ligand-induced dimerization of the receptor and phosphorylates several tyrosine residues in the C-terminal tail. The phosphorylated tail then recruits other signaling molecules and relays the signal to downstream pathways. A model of the autoinhibition, activation and feedback inhibition mechanisms for the ErbB kinase domain has emerged from a number of recent structural studies. Meanwhile, recent clinical studies have revealed the relationship between specific ErbB kinase mutations and the responsiveness to kinase inhibitor drugs.

Mutations and over-expression of the ErbB receptors have been implicated in a variety of human cancers. It is widely thought that the ErbB receptors are located in the plasma membrane, and that ligand binding to the monomeric form of the receptors induces its dimeric form for activation. However, it still remains controversial whether prior to ligand binding the receptors exist as monomers or dimers on the cell surface. Using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays in the present study, we demonstrate that in the absence of bound ligand, all the ErbB family members have preformed, yet inactive, homo- and heterodimers on the cell surface, except for ErbB3 homodimers and heterodimers with cleavable ErbB4, which exist primarily in the nucleus. BiFC assays of the dimerization have also suggested that the ligand-independent dimerization of the ErbB receptors occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) before newly synthesized receptor molecules reach the cell surface. Based on BiFC and mammalian two-hybrid assays, it is apparent that the intracellular domains of the receptors are responsible for the spontaneous dimer formation. These provide new insights into an understanding of transmembrane signal transduction mediated by the ErbB family members, and are relevant to the development of anti-cancer drugs.",

Non‑surgical approaches typically comprise radiotherapy and antineoplastic chemotherapy, of which platinum‑based agents are the most common. Similar to other malignancies, targeted therapies have an increasing role in the treatment of head and neck cancer. The overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a useful target for specific therapeutic strategies. Resistance to EGFR‑directed therapies, including cetuximab, is partly mediated by the activation of alternative receptors and pathways. Therefore, other members of the ErbB family, including human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2 and HER4, may have important therapeutic roles. The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of afatinib, an EGFR/HER2/HER4 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in combination with cisplatin in HNSCC cell lines. The cisplatin concentration used was set at cell line‑specific half maximal inhibitory concentration values. Since the vast majority of head and neck cancers do not exhibit any EGFR tyrosine kinase domain mutations, five human EGFR wild‑type HNSCC cell lines were used in the present study. For statistical analyses, non‑parametric Mann‑Whitney tests were conducted. The present study detected a concentration‑dependent efficacy of afatinib. In three out of the five cell lines (PCI‑9, PCI‑52 and PCI‑68), 0.625 µM afatinib in combination with cisplatin exerted significant antiproliferative effects. In the two other cell lines (PCI‑1 and PCI‑13), significant effects were observed following treatment with ≥1.25 µM afatinib. Notably, compared with the findings of previous studies, cell lines (PCI-9 and PCI-52) less vulnerable to erlotinib or gefitinib were more vulnerable to the afatinib/cisplatin combination, and vice versa. Differences in the treatment success of erlotinib/gefitinib (targeting only EGFR) and afatinib (targeting EGFR, HER2 and HER4) may be explained by mutations in the EGFR. Therefore, afatinib treatment may be considered an important therapeutic option for patients failing cetuximab treatment. In addition, the present study demonstrated significant enhancement of platinum‑based therapies upon the addition of various afatinib concentrations. These results provide preclinical evidence to advocate further in vivo studies and clinical trials.",

Our aim was to explore the effects of ZD1839 in breast cancer cell lines expressing different levels of EGFR and the closely related HER2 receptor.;We studied the growth-inhibitory effects of ZD1839 in a series of breast carcinoma cell lines. In HER2-overexpressing BT-474 breast cancer cells, we studied the effects of ZD1839 on cell growth and heterodimerization of receptors under basal and ligand-stimulated conditions.;ZD1839 was an equally potent inhibitor of growth in breast cancer cells expressing high levels of EGFR and HER2. In BT-474 breast cancer cells, ZD1839 abolished EGF- and heregulin-induced activation of ErbB receptors and downstream signaling molecules. Because ZD1839 does not inhibit the HER2 tyrosine kinase in vitro, and because heregulin is a ligand that activates HER2 by binding to HER3 and HER4 but does not bind to the EGFR, our findings suggested that ZD1839 interfered with HER2 function in intact cells. Searching for mechanisms, we report that ZD1839 induces the formation of inactive unphosphorylated EGFR/HER2 and EGFR/HER3 heterodimers. Furthermore, ZD1839 completely abolishes basal and heregulin-induced formation of active phosphorylated HER2/HER3 heterodimers.;ZD1839 inhibits the growth of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, possibly by sequestration of HER2 and HER3 receptors in an inactive heterodimer configuration with the EGFR.

The EGFR axis is activated by a variety of ligands that are crucial in the formation and propagation of many tumors, including colorectal cancer, through their effects on cell signaling pathways, cellular proliferation, control of apoptosis, and angiogenesis. The importance of the EGFR axis in tumorigenesis and tumor progression makes it an attractive target for the development of anticancer therapies. A variety of targeting strategies to exploit the role of EGFR in tumors have been employed. The most highly developed of these anti-EGFR approaches are the monoclonal antibodies and the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Clinical evaluations of these compounds have yielded some promising results. The role of the EGFR axis in colorectal cancer formation and progression is reviewed and the clinical development of these anticancer EGFR-targeted drugs is reviewed and updated.",

In immune complex assays performed in the presence of 15 mM Mn2+, ErbB proteins and the chEGFR exhibited highly reproducible tyrosine kinase activity. Under these conditions, the ErbB and chEGFR proteins had similar apparent Km [Km(app)] values for ATP. The ErbB proteins appeared to be activated, as they had at least 3-fold-higher relative Vmax(app) for autophosphorylation and approximately 2-fold higher relative Vmax(app) for the phosphorylation of the exogenous substrate TK6 (a bacterially expressed fusion protein containing the C-terminal domain of the human EGFR). The ErbB kinases had both higher Km(app) and higher Vmax(app) for the phosphorylation of the exogenous substrate TK6 than did the chEGFR. The ratios of the Vmax(app) to the Km(app) for TK6 phosphorylation suggested that the ErbB proteins had lower catalytic efficiencies for the exogenous substrate than did the chEGFR. The three tested ErbB proteins had cytoplasmic domain mutations that conferred distinctive disease potentials. These mutations did not affect the kinetics for the phosphorylation of the exogenous substrate TK6. Two of the ErbB proteins contained all of the sites used for autophosphorylation. In these, a mutation that broadened oncogenic potential to endothelial cells caused an additional increase in Vmax(app) for autophosphorylation. Thus, mutations that change the EGFR into an ErbB oncogene cause multiple changes in the kinetics of protein tyrosine kinase activity.",

To explore a role for muscarinic receptor signaling in colon cancer metastasis, we used human H508 and HT29 colon cancer cells that coexpress epidermal growth factor (ERBB) and CHRM3 receptors. In a wound closure model, following 8-h incubation of H508 cells with 100 μM ACh we observed a threefold increase in cell migration indistinguishable from the actions of epidermal growth factor (EGF). Atropine blocked the actions of ACh but not of EGF. In SNU-C4 colon cancer cells that express ERBB but not CHRM, EGF caused a threefold increase in migration; ACh had no effect. ACh-induced cell migration was attenuated by chemical inhibitors of ERBB1 activation, by anti-ERBB1 antibody, and by inhibitors of ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling. Consistent with matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP7)-mediated release of an ERBB1 ligand, heparin binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HBEGF), ACh-induced migration was inhibited by an MMP inhibitor and by anti-MMP7 and -HBEGF antibodies. ACh-induced cell migration was blocked by inhibiting RhoA and ROCK, key proteins that interact with the actin cytoskeleton. ACh-induced RhoA activation was attenuated by agents that inhibit ERBB1, ERK, and PI3K activation. Collectively, these findings indicate that ACh-induced cell migration is mediated by MMP7-mediated release of HBEGF, an ERBB ligand that activates ERBB1 and downstream ERK and PI3K signaling. In a cell invasion model, ACh-induced HT29 cell invasion was blocked by atropine. In concert with previous observations, these findings indicate that muscarinic receptor signaling plays a key role in colon cancer cell proliferation, survival, migration, and invasion.",

We used a chemical genetic approach to generate a selective inhibitor of v-erbB [a transforming allele of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)] and interrogated inhibition in known downstream signaling pathways. On the basis of this analysis, we hypothesized that dual inhibition of v-erbB and phosphatidylinositol 3' (PI3) kinases could show improved potency. We, therefore, used two different cell lines to examine the effects of v-erbB or EGFR inhibitors, in combination with PI3 kinase inhibitors, in mouse models for EGFR-driven cancers. When treated with NaPP1, v-erbB-as1-transformed fibroblasts showed cell-cycle arrest and decreased activity of Akt kinase. Inhibitors of v-erbB-as1 and of PI3 kinase showed enhanced efficacy in treating established 3T3:v-erbB-as1 tumor allografts. We extended these results to the human glioma cell line U87:MG transduced with DeltaEGFR, a tumor-derived activated allele, treating tumor-bearing mice with vehicle, the EGFR inhibitor ZD1839, LY294002, or ZD1839 plus LY294002.

Tumor-associated macrophages are generally considered allies in the process of tumor progression in several types of cancer, although their role on gastric and colorectal carcinomas is still poorly understood. In this report, we studied the influence of primary human macrophages on gastric and colorectal cancer cells, considering invasion, motility/migration, proteolysis and activated intracellular signaling pathways. We demonstrated that macrophages stimulate cancer cell invasion, motility and migration, and that these effects depend on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity and on the activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (at the residue Y(1086)), PLC-γ (phospholipase C-gamma) and Gab1 (GRB2-associated binding protein-1), as evidenced by siRNA (small interference RNA) experiments. Epidermal growth factor (EGF)-immunodepletion impaired macrophage-mediated cancer cell invasion and motility, suggesting that EGF is the pro-invasive and pro-motile factor produced by macrophages. Macrophages also induced gastric and colorectal cancer cell phosphorylation of Akt, c-Src and ERK1/2, and led to an increase of RhoA and Cdc42 activity. Interestingly, whereas macrophage-mediated cancer cell c-Src and ERK1/2 phosphorylation occurred downstream EGFR activation, Akt phosphorylation seems to be a parallel event, taking place in an EGFR-independent manner. The involvement of EGF, EGFR-downstream signaling partners and MMPs in macrophage-mediated invasion provides novel insights into the molecular crosstalk established between cancer cells and macrophages, opening new perspectives for the design of new and more efficient therapeutic strategies to counteract cancer cell invasion.

To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying cisplatin resistance in breast cancer, we used estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 cells as a model system. We generated cisplatin-resistant MCF-7 cells and determined the functional status of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), MAPK, and AKT signaling pathways by phosphoreceptor tyrosine kinase and phospho-MAPK arrays. The cisplatin-resistant MCF-7 cells are characterized by increased EGFR phosphorylation, high levels of AKT1 kinase activity, and ERK1 phosphorylation. In contrast, the JNK and p38 MAPK modules of the MAPK signaling pathway were inactive. These conditions were associated with inactivation of the p53 pathway and increased BCL-2 expression. We investigated the expression of genes encoding the ligands for the ERBB signaling cascade and found a selective up-regulation of amphiregulin expression, which occurred at later stages of cisplatin resistance development. Amphiregulin is a specific ligand of the EGFR (ERBB1) and a potent mitogen for epithelial cells. After exposure to cisplatin, the resistant MCF-7 cells secreted amphiregulin protein over extended periods of time, and knockdown of amphiregulin expression by specific short interfering RNA resulted in a nearly complete reversion of the resistant phenotype. To demonstrate the generality and importance of our findings, we examined amphiregulin expression and cisplatin resistance in a variety of human breast cancer cell lines and found a highly significant correlation. In contrast, amphiregulin levels did not significantly correlate with cisplatin resistance in a panel of lung cancer cell lines.

A total of five human breast cancer cell lines were used. The effects of single or combined treatments with gefitinib and/or fulvestrant on cell growth, cell cycle progression and apoptosis were analysed. Changes in the expression levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p21 and p27, an antiapoptotic factor, Bcl-2, and a proapoptotic factor, Bax, were also investigated. All cell lines tested were sensitive to gefitinib (50% growth inhibitory concentration, 10-28.5 microM). Breast cancer cell lines with a high expression level of HER1 or HER2 were more sensitive to gefitinib than the others. Gefitinib induced a significant G1-S blockade in ER-positive KPL-3C cells. Gefitinib induced significant apoptosis in HER1-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells. Gefitinib additively increased the antitumour effect of fulvestrant in all three ER-positive cell lines in a medium supplemented with 17beta-oestradiol. The combined treatment promoted cell cycle retardation in KPL-3C cells, which is associated with an upregulation of p21 by fulvestrant and gefitinib, respectively.

These receptors activate numerous downstream pathways in response to extracellular ligands, regulating diverse processes that include differentiation, migration, proliferation, and survival. Alterations in these genes play a role in the development and progression of many human cancers. In gastric carcinomas (GCs), expression of HER1 and HER2 is thought to be a prognostic factor and target of novel biologic agents. The effect of HER3 or HER4 expression in GC has not been sufficiently studied. In this study, we explored the gene and protein expression of the HER family in GC to establish new potential prognostic factors.;Immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization were performed in 221 patients with GC using tissue microarray. Correlation between the expression or amplification of HER genes and the clinicopathologic parameters was statistically analyzed.;Alterations of members of the HER family were significantly associated with the parameters involved in tumor progression, including depth of tumor invasion, involved lymph nodes, and tumor stage. In addition, HER2 amplification and HER3 expression were significantly related to worse survival.;These results reveal that all members of the HER family are expressed in GC. Furthermore, expression of HER2 and HER3 is a significant predictor of poor survival in GC. Therefore, the development of HER-targeted agents and agents targeting downstream signaling pathways provides new possibilities in the treatment of GC.",

ZNF216 gene has been identified as one of Immediate Early Genes (IEGs) induced by RTKs. Overexpression of ZNF216 protein sensitizes 293 cell line to TNF-α induced apoptosis. However, ZNF216 overexpression has been reported in medulloblastomas and metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinomas. Thus, the role of this protein is still not clearly understood. In this study, the inverse correlation between EGFR and ZNF216 expression was confirmed in various human cancer cell lines differently expressing EGFR. EGF treatment of NIH3T3 cells overexpressing both EGFR and ZNF216 (NIH3T3-EGFR/ZNF216), induced a long lasting activation of EGFR in the cytosolic fraction and an accumulation of phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR) more in the nuclear than in the cytosolic fraction compared to NIH3T3-EGFR cells. Moreover, EGF was able to stimulate an increased expression of ZNF216 in the cytosolic compartment and its nuclear translocation in a time-dependent manner in NIH3T3-EGFR/ZNF216. A similar trend was observed in A431 cells endogenously expressing the EGFR and transfected with Znf216. The increased levels of pEGFR and ZNF216 in the nuclear fraction of NIH3T3-EGFR/ZNF216 cells were paralleled by increased levels of phospho-MAPK and phospho-Akt. Surprisingly, EGF treatment of NIH3T3-EGFR/ZNF216 cells induced a significant increase of apoptosis thus indicating that ZNF216 could sensitize cells to EGF-induced apoptosis and suggesting that it may be involved in the regulation and effects of EGFR signaling.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a tyrosine kinase receptor of the ErbB family that is abnormally activated in many epithelial tumors. Receptor activation leads to recruitment and phosphorylation of several downstream intracellular substrates, leading to mitogenic signaling and other tumor-promoting cellular activities. In human tumors, receptor overexpression correlates with a more aggressive clinical course. Taken together, these observations indicate that the EGFR is a promising target for cancer therapy. Monoclonal antibodies directed at the ligand-binding extracellular domain and low-molecular weight inhibitors of the receptor's tyrosine kinase are currently in advanced stages of clinical development. These agents prevent ligand-induced receptor activation and downstream signaling, which results in cell cycle arrest, promotion of apoptosis, and inhibition of angiogenesis. They also enhance the antitumor effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In patients, anti-EGFR agents can be given safely at doses that fully inhibit receptor signaling, and single-agent activity has been observed against a variety of tumor types, including colon carcinoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer, ovarian carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma. Although antitumor activity is significant, responses have been seen in only a minority of the patients treated. In some clinical trials, anti-EGFR agents enhanced the effects of conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

Human skin, cultured normal keratinocytes, and A431 skin carcinoma cells expressed ErbB1, ErbB2, and ErbB3, but not ErbB4. Skin and A431 cells expressed more ErbB3 than did keratinocytes. Despite strong expression of ErbB2 and ErbB3, heregulin was inactive in stimulating tyrosine phosphorylation in A431 cells. In contrast, it was highly active in MDA-MB-453 breast carcinoma cells. ErbB2 displayed punctate cytoplasmic staining in A431 and keratinocytes, compared to strong cell surface staining in MDA-MB-453. In skin, ErbB2 was cytoplasmic in basal keratinocytes, assuming a cell surface pattern in the upper suprabasal layers. In contrast, ErbB1 retained a cell surface distribution in all epidermal layers. Keratinocyte proliferation in culture was found to be ErbB1-RTK-dependent, using a selective inhibitor. These results suggest that in skin keratinocytes, ErbB2 transduces ligand-dependent differentiation signals, whereas ErbB1 transduces ligand-dependent proliferation/survival signals.

How Notch3 and epidermal growth factor receptor-mitogen-activated protein kinase (EGFR-MAPK) pathways cooperate in modulating apoptosis is not yet known. In this study, we provide evidence that Notch3 regulates Bim, a BH-3-only protein, via MAPK signaling. Furthermore, loss of Bim expression prevents tumor apoptosis induced by Notch3 inhibition. Using gamma-secretase inhibitor and erlotinib in a xenograft model, Bim induction and tumor inhibition were observed to be enhanced compared with either agent alone, consistent with our previous observation of significant synergism between Notch and EGFR-ras-MAPK signaling.

Its overexpression in many epithelial tumors has been associated with bad prognosis and poor survival. Cancer vaccine based on the extracellular domain (ECD) of HER1 and adjuvated in very small sized proteoliposomes (VSSP) and Montanide ISA 51-VG is a new and complementary approach for the treatment of epithelial tumors. The present study deals with the immunogenicity of this vaccine in Macaca fascicularis monkeys and evaluation of its toxicity during 12 months. Twelve monkeys were randomized into two groups of 3 animals per sex: control and vaccinated. Treated monkeys received 9 doses of vaccination and were daily inspected for clinical signs. Body weight, rectal temperature, cardiac and respiratory rates were measured during the study. Humoral immune response, clinical pathology parameters and delayed type hypensensitivity were analyzed. Skin biopsy was performed at the end of the study in all animals. Animal's survival in the study was 100% (n=12). Local reactions were observed at the administration site of four treated animals (n=6), with two showing slight inflammatory cutaneous damage. Clinical pathology parameters were not affected. HER1 vaccine induced high IgG antibodies titers in the treated animals even when DTH was not observed. The induced antibodies recognized HER1+ tumor cell lines, decreased HER1 phosphorylation and showed anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in H125 cells. In general the present study showed that HER1 vaccine induced specific immune response in M. fascicularis monkeys and was well tolerated, suggesting it could be safely used in clinical studies in epithelial cancer patients.",

Epidermal growth factor receptor has received much interest in recent years with the advent of epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted molecular therapy in clinical oncology. We investigate the role of epidermal growth factor receptor as a biomarker for head and neck cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Using immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization, we assessed the epidermal growth factor receptor protein expression and gene copy in 3 groups of head and neck cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma: primary lesions not associated with metastasis (P), primary lesions associated with subsequent metastasis (PM), and metastatic nodal disease (M). Epidermal growth factor receptor overexpression was detected in 36% and 79% of P and PM cases, respectively. Epidermal growth factor receptor overexpression was significantly associated with PM (P = .03) and was found to be an independent prognostic factor for metastasis on multivariate analysis (P = .05). However, epidermal growth factor receptor overexpression was only maintained in 47% of cases in the M group. None of the 27 cases that overexpressed the epidermal growth factor receptor protein showed gene amplification: the results were uninterpretable in 2, and polysomy and balanced disomy were detected in 5 and 20 cases, respectively.

Afatinib downregulates ErbB signalling by covalently binding to the kinase domains of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 2 and HER4, resulting in irreversible inhibition of tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation; it also inhibits transphosphorylation of HER3. Afatinib is approved as monotherapy for the treatment of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-naïve adults with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating EGFR mutations in the EU, and for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumours have EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations as detected by a US FDA-approved test in the US. In two randomized, open-label, multinational phase III trials, progression-free survival was significantly prolonged with afatinib compared with pemetrexed plus cisplatin (LUX-Lung 3) or gemcitabine plus cisplatin (LUX-Lung 6) in treatment-naïve patients with advanced NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations. The objective response rate was significantly higher with afatinib than with pemetrexed plus cisplatin or gemcitabine plus cisplatin, and patient-reported outcomes for symptoms such as cough and dyspnoea and certain health-related quality of life measures significantly favoured afatinib versus pemetrexed plus cisplatin or gemcitabine plus cisplatin. Afatinib also showed efficacy in EGFR TKI-naïve patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma and activating EGFR mutations who had received no more than one prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced disease, according to the results of the noncomparative, multinational, phase II LUX-Lung 2 trial. Oral afatinib had a manageable tolerability profile. EGFR-mediated adverse events (e.g. diarrhoea, rash/acne) were generally managed using dose reduction and delays. In conclusion, afatinib is a valuable new option for use in treatment-naïve or EGFR TKI-naïve patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma and activating EGFR mutations. ",

However, epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors have exhibited high response rates in EGFR mutation-positive lung cancer patients with central nervous system metastases.

Bevacizumab has also been used as an effective therapeutic agent in patients with central nervous system metastases. However, the efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor doublet therapy for leptomeningeal metastases and the cerebrospinal fluid penetration of epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors have yet to be determined. Moreover, the safety of this doublet regimen in patients with a poor general condition is not known.

We show here that somatic deletions in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR were associated with increased EGFR gene copy number in NSCLC.

High levels of this expression are common in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and correlate with decreased survival.

To date, results of phase II or III trials of tyrosine kinase inhibitors have yielded mixed results, with moderate activity but no increase in survival reported in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Recently reported results of phase II trials of cetuximab in combination with chemotherapy show the feasibility and activity of these combinations, with overall response rates of 22% to 53% in previously treated and untreated patients. The primary toxicity of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors is mild-to-moderate rash that is occasionally severe. In addition, hypersensitivity reactions are uncommonly reported with monoclonal antibodies, and orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitors are associated with diarrhea that can be dose limiting. Combining epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors with chemotherapy does not appear to increase chemotherapy-related toxicity.

Comparison of all receptor combinations reveals that EGFR/ErbB-2 and ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimers are the most potent inducers of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA expression compared with EGFR/ErbB-3, EGFR/ErbB-4, ErbB-2/ErbB-4, and ErbB-3/ErbB-4. Immunohistochemistry of tumor xenografts overexpressing these heterodimers shows increased VEGF expression and remarkably enhanced vascularity. Enhanced VEGF expression is associated with increased VEGF transcription. Deletional analysis reveals that ErbB-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of VEGF involves a hypoxia-inducible factor 1-independent responsive region located between nucleotides -88 to -66 of the VEGF promoter. Mutational analysis reveals that the Sp-1 and AP-2 transcription factor binding elements within this region are required for up-regulation of VEGF by heregulin beta1 and that this up-regulation is dependent on the activity of extracellular signal-related protein kinases.

In human mammary carcinomas the EGFR is involved in regulating cell growth, survival, migration and metastasis and its activation correlates with the lack of response in hormone therapy. Here, we demonstrate in oestrogen receptor-positive and -negative human breast cancer cells and primary mammary epithelial cells a cross-communication between G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and the EGFR. We present evidence that specific inhibition of ADAM15 or TACE blocks GPCR-induced and proHB-EGF-mediated EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, downstream mitogenic signalling and cell migration. Notably, activation of the PI3K downstream mediator PKB/Akt by GPCR ligands involves the activity of sphingosine kinase (SPHK) and is independent of EGFR signal transactivation. We conclude that GPCR-induced chemotaxis of breast cancer cells is mediated by EGFR-dependent and -independent signalling pathways, with both parallel pathways having to act in concert to achieve a complete migratory response.",

Previously, we have shown that epidermal growth factor receptor overexpression independently predicts poor prognosis in cervical cancer patients, which makes it a potential therapeutic target. The aim of this study was to systematically analyze the molecular mechanism leading to epidermal growth factor receptor overexpression in cervical cancer. All experiments were performed on archival paraffin-embedded material. In 166 cervical cancer patients, cytoplasmic, membrane and phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor protein expression were studied in association with patient survival. Membrane epidermal growth factor receptor overexpression was associated with poor disease-specific survival (P=0.027). This association was particularly present in human papillomavirus 16-positive patients (P=0.029). We analyzed whether epidermal growth factor receptor overexpression was caused by gene amplification using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Epidermal growth factor receptor gene copy number was linked to chromosome 7 ploidy, as no gene amplification could be detected when corrected for chromosome 7 centromeric signals. Chromosome 7 aneuploidy was associated with membrane epidermal growth factor receptor overexpression (P=0.013). Additional mutation analysis was performed by sequencing pure, flow-sorted tumor cells, but no mutations were detected. Furthermore, human papillomavirus 16 E5 and E6 oncogene mRNA expression was measured, using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, to determine the association between the human papillomavirus and epidermal growth factor receptor overexpression. High human papillomavirus 16 E5 and E6 mRNA expression were associated with decreased survival (P=0.045 and 0.047, respectively). High human papillomavirus 16 E6 mRNA expression was associated with membrane epidermal growth factor receptor overexpression (P=0.013). This is the first study performed on cancer patient material showing that chromosome 7 aneuploidy and high human papillomavirus 16 E6 mRNA expression lead to membrane epidermal growth factor receptor overexpression in cervical cancer.",

Our previous studies have demonstrated that gastric mucosa TGF-alpha and epidermal growth factor receptor were significantly increased in rats with portal hypertension using the immunohistochemical analysis. Thus, the present study aimed to confirm the effect of portal hypertension on the expression of gastric TGF-alpha and epidermal growth factor receptor mRNA and to localize gastric TGF-alpha and epidermal growth factor receptor mRNA production sites in rats.;Portal hypertension was induced experimentally by partial ligation of the portal vein in 12 male Wistar rats (PVL group), and in another group of 12 rats (control) that received sham operations. The severity of gastric mucosal lesions was evaluated macroscopically by a gross ulcer index. We simultaneously detected the expression of TGF-alpha and epidermal growth factor receptor mRNA in the gastric tissues of control and portal hypertensive rats by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization.;The portal pressure and gross gastric mucosal damage differed significantly between the PVL group and the control group (p < 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively). The expression of TGF-alpha and epidermal growth factor receptor mRNA was significantly increased in portal hypertensive rats compared to the control using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (both p < 0.01). Additionally, in situ hybridization showed the TGF-alpha and epidermal growth factor receptor mRNA were more intense in the PVL group compared to the control. TGF-alpha mRNA was located primarily in the parietal cells of the gastric fundic glands and in the surface epithelial cells, whereas epidermal growth factor receptor mRNA was mainly in the mucous neck cells of the proliferative zone and some parietal cells.;From these findings, we suggest that the enhanced TGF-alpha and epidermal growth factor receptor production may play an important role in the gastric mucosal regeneration of portal hypertensive rats through the increased mRNA expression.",

In total, 55 breast carcinomas morphologically diagnosed as apocrine were evaluated for the steroid receptor expression profile characteristic of normal apocrine epithelium (androgen receptor positive/estrogen receptor (ER) negative/progesterone receptor (PR) negative), and for the expression of EGFR and Her-2/neu proteins, and the copy number ratios of the genes EGFR/CEP7 and HER-2/CEP17. On the basis of the results of steroid receptors expression, 38 (69%) cases were classified as pure apocrine carcinoma (androgen receptor positive/ER negative/PR negative), whereas 17 (31%) were re-classified as apocrine-like carcinomas because they did not have the characteristic steroid receptor expression profile. Her-2/neu overexpression was observed in 54% of the cases (57% pure apocrine carcinomas vs 47% apocrine-like carcinomas). HER-2/neu gene amplification was demonstrated in 52% of all cases (54% pure apocrine carcinomas vs 46% apocrine-like carcinomas). EGFR protein (scores 1 to 3+) was detected in 62% of all cases and was expressed in a higher proportion of pure apocrine carcinomas than in the apocrine-like carcinomas group (76 vs 29%, P=0.006). In the pure apocrine carcinoma group, Her-2/neu and EGFR protein expression were inversely correlated (P=0.006, r=-0.499). EGFR gene amplification was observed in two pure apocrine carcinomas and one apocrine-like carcinoma. Polysomy 7 was commonly present in pure apocrine carcinomas (61 vs 27% of apocrine-like carcinomas; P=0.083) and showed a weak positive correlation with EGFR protein expression (P=0.025, r=0.326). Our study showed that apocrine breast carcinomas are molecularly diverse group of carcinomas. Strictly defined pure apocrine carcinomas are either HER-2-overexpressing breast carcinomas or triple-negative breast carcinomas, whereas apocrine-like carcinomas predominantly belong to the luminal phenotype. Pure apocrine carcinomas show consistent overexpression of either EGFR or HER-2/neu, which could have significant therapeutic implications.",

Inappropriate activation of these receptors is a key feature of many human cancers, and its reversal is an important clinical goal. A natural secreted antagonist of EGFR signalling, called Argos, was identified in Drosophila. We showed previously that Argos functions by directly binding (and sequestering) growth factor ligands that activate EGFR. Here we describe the 1.6-A resolution crystal structure of Argos bound to an EGFR ligand. Contrary to expectations, Argos contains no EGF-like domain. Instead, a trio of closely related domains (resembling a three-finger toxin fold) form a clamp-like structure around the bound EGF ligand. Although structurally unrelated to the receptor, Argos mimics EGFR by using a bipartite binding surface to entrap EGF. The individual Argos domains share unexpected structural similarities with the extracellular ligand-binding regions of transforming growth factor-beta family receptors. The three-domain clamp of Argos also resembles the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) receptor, which uses a similar mechanism to engulf the EGF-like module of uPA. Our results indicate that undiscovered mammalian counterparts of Argos may exist among other poorly characterized structural homologues. In addition, the structures presented here define requirements for the design of artificial EGF-sequestering proteins that would be valuable anti-cancer therapeutics.",

We used receptor TK (RTK) capture arrays to identify receptors active in NSCLC cell lines. As Met and ErbBs were active, we explored the potential therapeutic advantage of combined targeting of Met with ErbB receptor family inhibitors for treatment of NSCLC. We found that Met physically interacts with both EGFR and Her2 in a NSCLC cell line with overexpression/overactivation of Met. Combined use of a dual EGFR/Her2 inhibitor with a Met inhibitor yields maximal growth inhibition compared with the use of EGFR and/or Met inhibitors. This suggests that simultaneous inhibition of multiple RTKs may be needed to effectively abrogate tumour cell growth.

The aim of the present study was to identify the bioactive constituents of the apple juice extract which contribute substantially to this potentially chemopreventive effect and to address the question whether the effect is specific to the EGFR or whether other members of the ErbB-receptor family might also be affected. Apple-derived dihydrochalcones and their respective glycosides were found to decrease EGFR activity under cell-free conditions with IC50-values ranging from 0.4 ± 0.1 to 267.0 ± 50.0 μM but showed no activity on human cancer cells. The concentration of quercetin or its glycosides in the extract was too low to contribute substantially to the EGFR-inhibitory properties. In contrast, fractions derived from the apple juice extract comprising ≥86% oligomeric procyanidins (OPCs) suppressed the activity of the EGFR in cell culture with an IC50 ∼ 100 μg mL(-1). In addition, the activity of further members of the ErbB-receptor family was potently inhibited, with ErbB3 receptor activity being most potently decreased (IC50 ∼ 10 μg mL(-1)). From the apple polyphenols identified so far OPCs were found to add the highest contribution to the inhibitory effects towards members of the ErbB-receptor family. Considering the crucial role of the ErbB-receptors in carcinogenesis, these results support the hypothesis that apple-derived OPCs as well as OPC-rich apple preparations might be of interest with respect to chemoprevention.",

EGFR can promote the maturity of pulmonary type II epithelial cells and the synthesis and secretion of pulmonary surfactant.

To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of monoclonal antibody 528 directed against epidermal growth factor receptor on the proliferation and differentiation of monolayer cells and multicenter tumor spheroids from three head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (1483, MDA 686Ln, and MDA 886Ln) and the epidermal growth factor-responsive vulvar carcinoma A431. All head and neck squamous cell carcinoma lines were shown to express high levels of epidermal growth factor receptor by Scatchard analyses. Epidermal growth factor inhibited the growth of monolayer cells but stimulated the growth of 886 and A431 multicellular tumor spheroids. Epidermal growth factor modulated the differentiation of A431 and 686 with respect to involucrin immunohistochemistry and cornified enveloped competency. Monoclonal antibody 528 directed against epidermal growth factor receptor inhibited cellular proliferation as measured by cell number, thymidine incorporation, and multicellular tumor spheroid volume. A mild promotion of differentiation was observed in the epidermal growth factor-responsive cells. In conclusion, monoclonal antibody 528 directed against epidermal growth factor receptor inhibits growth of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells bearing high levels of epidermal growth factor receptors and promotes differentiation in some tumors. The use of a multicellular tumor spheroid model to evaluate growth factor responsiveness and inhibition of proliferation may more accurately reflect in vivo tumor growth than monolayer cells.

The grade was G1 in 5, G2 in 24, and G3 in 29 patients. Seven normal urothelial samples were obtained from patients with benign urologic conditions. The tumor material was probed using conventional immunoblotting and enhanced chemiluminescence. The blots were captured with digital imaging, and protein expression was quantified with gel analysis software.;Most tumors exhibited detectable expression of at least one erbB receptor. Examples of coexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr) and erbB-2 were also found. Detectable erbB-3 or erbB-4 protein expression was lacking in this series.

The monoclonal anti-LeY antibody ABL364 and its humanized version IGN311 immunoprecipitated ErbB1 and ErbB2 from detergent lysates of A431 and SKBR-3, respectively.

Stimulation of MAPK by ErbB was dynamin dependent and contingent on receptor internalization. ABL364 and IGN311 changed the intracellular localization of fluorescent EGF-containing endosomes and accelerated recycling of intracellular [(125)I]EGF to the plasma membrane.

Conserved in the ErbB family is a cluster of basic amino acid residues in the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane region. We found that charge-silencing mutagenesis within this juxtamembrane region of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) results in the generation of a mutant receptor (EGFR Mut R1-6) that spontaneously transforms NIH 3T3 cells in a ligand-independent manner. A similar mutant with one additional basic residue, EGFR Mut R1-5, fails to exhibit ligand-independent transformation. The capacity of EGFR Mut R1-6 to mediate this transformation is maintained when this mutant is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum via a single point mutation, L393H, which we describe. We show that EGFR Mut R1-6 with or without L393H exhibits enhanced basal tyrosine phosphorylation when ectopically expressed, and the ligand-independent transforming activity of EGFR Mut R1-6 is sensitive to inhibition of EGFR kinase activity and is particularly dependent on PI3K and mTOR activity. Similar to EGFR Mut R1-6/L393H in NIH 3T3 cells, EGFR variant type III, a highly oncogenic mutant form of EGFR linked to human brain cancers, confers transforming activity while it is wholly endoplasmic reticulum-retained in U87 cells.

Breast cancer cells and osteoblasts express the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and produce ErbB family ligands, suggesting participation of these growth factors in autocrine and paracrine signaling within the bone microenvironment. EGFR ligand expression was profiled in the bone metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells (MDA-231), and agonist-induced signaling was examined in both breast cancer and osteoblast-like cells. Both paracrine and autocrine EGFR signaling were inhibited with a neutralizing amphiregulin antibody, PAR34, whereas shRNA to the EGFR was used to specifically block autocrine signaling in MDA-231 cells. The impact of these was evaluated with proliferation, migration and gene expression assays. Breast cancer metastasis to bone was modeled in female athymic nude mice with intratibial inoculation of MDA-231 cells, and cancer cell-bone marrow co-cultures. EGFR knockdown, but not PAR34 treatment, decreased osteoclasts formed in vitro (p<0.01), reduced osteolytic lesion tumor volume (p<0.01), increased survivorship in vivo (p<0.001), and resulted in decreased MDA-231 growth in the fat pad (p<0.01).

Crystal structures of human EGFR-Mig6 complexes reveal the structural basis for enhanced phosphorylation of primed Mig6 and show how Mig6 rearranges after phosphorylation by EGFR to effectively irreversibly inhibit the same receptor that catalyzed its phosphorylation. This dual phosphorylation site allows Mig6 to inactivate EGFR in a manner that requires activation of the target receptor and that can be modulated by Src. Loss of Mig6 is a driving event in human cancer; analysis of 1,057 gliomas reveals frequent focal deletions of ERRFI1, the gene that encodes Mig6, in EGFR-amplified glioblastomas. ",

The potential pitfalls of these clinical trials, and the molecular mechanisms that might be involved in regulating the sensitivity/resistance of breast cancer cells to EGFR TKIs are discussed in this brief article. In particular, preclinical findings clearly demonstrate that breast cancer cells are able to activate different mechanisms to escape the anti-tumor effects of drugs directed against growth factor-driven pathways. Therefore, it is conceivable that significant blockade of tumor growth might be obtained only through contemporary blockade of different growth promoting pathways, at least in advanced disease. In addition, preclinical and clinical findings support the use of EGFR TKIs in specific subgroups of breast cancer patients, such as estrogen receptor positive (ER+), tamoxifen resistant patients. In this regard, we describe potential future applications of these compounds in combination with other agents in the treatment of breast carcinoma.",

Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors have shown promise in treating some of these tumors. Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC) is an aggressive neoplasm that occurs in young patients with no history of cirrhosis. This study examines the expression and gene copy number of EGFR in FL-HCC. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded FL-HCC (n = 13) sections were stained with a monoclonal antibody against EGFR. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was performed using probes against EGFR gene and centromeric region of chromosome 7 (CEP 7). Epidermal growth factor receptor and CEP 7 signals were counted in 50 tumor nuclei per case as well as 300 normal hepatocyte nuclei. The EGFR to CEP 7 signal ratio was calculated for each case. Most (92%, 12/13) of FL-HCC showed strong and diffuse staining with anti-EGFR antibody. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was informative in 11 cases, 10 of which showed extra EGFR gene copy numbers (mean, 3.69; range, 3.13-5.0). Epidermal growth factor receptor was overexpressed in all these cases. The mean number of EGFR signals per cell in FL-HCC was double that of normal hepatocytes (3.69 versus 1.80); the mean EGFR/CEP 7 ratio in tumor cells was 1.05. In conclusion, EGFR is strongly overexpressed on the cell membrane in nearly all cases of FL-HCC. Similar gains of chromosome 7 are observed, indicating that the extra EGFR gene copies are due to polysomy rather than gene amplification. The strong expression of EGFR in FL-HCC tumors suggests that they may respond to treatment with EGFR antagonists.",

KRAS is a frequently mutated gene in human cancer but remains a challenging clinical target. Inhibitors against KRAS signaling mediators, namely, PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) and mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin), have limited clinical efficacy as single agents in KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer (CRC). We investigated potential bypass mechanisms to PI3K/mTOR inhibition in KRAS-mutant CRC. Using genetically engineered mouse model cells that had acquired resistance to the dual PI3K/mTOR small-molecule inhibitor PF-04691502, we determined with chemical library screens that inhibitors of the ERBB [epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)] family restored the sensitivity to PF-04691502. Although EGFR inhibitors alone have limited efficacy in reducing KRAS-mutant tumors, we found that PF-04691502 induced the abundance, phosphorylation, and activity of EGFR, ERBB2, and ERBB3 through activation of FOXO3a (forkhead box O 3a), a transcription factor inhibited by the PI3K to AKT pathway. PF-04691502 also induced a stem cell-like gene expression signature. KRAS-mutant patient-derived xenografts from mice treated with PF-04691502 had a similar gene expression signature and exhibited increased EGFR activation, suggesting that this drug-induced resistance mechanism may occur in patients. Combination therapy with dacomitinib (a pan-ERBB inhibitor) restored sensitivity to PF-04691502 in drug-resistant cells in culture and induced tumor regression in drug-resistant allografts in mice. Our findings suggest that combining PI3K/mTOR and EGFR inhibitors may improve therapeutic outcome in patients with KRAS-mutant CRC. ",

Although studies of their functions have conventionally focused on their membrane-associated forms, documented observations of the presence of these membrane receptors and their functioning partners in the nucleus have reshaped the intracellular geography and highlight the need to modify the central dogma. The ErbB proteins in the membrane can translocate to the nucleus through different mechanisms. Nuclear RTKs regulate a variety of cellular functions, such as cell proliferation, DNA damage repair, and signal transduction, both in normal tissues and in human cancer cell. In addition, they play important roles in determining cancer response to cancer therapy. Nuclear presence of these ErbB proteins is emerging as an important marker in human cancers.

        "Doc_abstract":"A better understanding of how epidermal growth factor receptor family members (ErbBs) contribute to metastasis is important for evaluating ErbB-directed therapies. Activation of ErbB3/ErbB2 heterodimers can affect both proliferation and motility. We find that increasing ErbB3-dependent signaling in orthotopic injection models of breast cancer can enhance intravasation and lung metastasis with no effect on primary tumor growth or microvessel density. Enhanced metastatic ability due to increased expression of ErbB2 or ErbB3 correlated with stronger chemotaxis and invasion responses to heregulin beta1. Suppression of ErbB3 expression reduced both intravasation and metastasis. A human breast cancer tumor tissue microarray showed a significant association between ErbB3 and ErbB2 expression and metastasis independent of tumor size. These results indicate that ErbB3-dependent signaling through ErbB3/ErbB2 heterodimers can contribute to metastasis through enhancing tumor cell invasion and intravasation in vivo and that ErbB-directed therapies may be useful for the inhibition of invasion independent of effects on tumor growth.",

Knowledge of molecular pathways determining the behavior of individual gastric tumors seems to be crucial for therapeutic decisions, and evaluation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression might be critical for prognosis, assessment, and identification of patients that could be treated with tailored therapies.;VEGF and EGFR determination was performed in 88 gastric cancer samples as well as 25 normal gastric mucosa specimens from non-cancer patients using a commercially available immunohistochemistry kit. In all samples, the correlation of VEGF and EGFR expression was investigated with each other, and with other prognostic indicators in all samples, and, finally, with survival rates in 69 patients undergoing potentially curative surgery.;Forty-eight per cent (42 cases) of gastric cancers expressed VEGF, and 44% (39 cases) stained for EGFR. In curatively treated patients, VEGF and EGFR expression was demonstrated to correlate with worse survival in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Molecular profiling was shown to more accurately estimate the risk of cancer-related death than TNM stage, and, of most interest, to allow sorting out high-risk patients within the same stage.;These findings provide evidence that contemporary evaluation of VEGF and EGFR expression may be crucial to select gastric cancer patients with poor prognosis who may benefit of tailored treatments.",

Several mechanisms lead to the receptor's aberrant activation that is observed in cancer, including receptor overexpression, mutation, ligand-dependent receptor dimerization, and ligand-independent activation. Two classes of anti-EGFR agents are currently approved for the treatment of patients with cancer: cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody directed at the extracellular domain of the receptor, and gefitinib and erlotinib, oral, low-molecular-weight (MW), adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive inhibitors of the receptor's tyrosine kinase. Anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated activity in the therapy of advanced colorectal carcinoma and in a variety of epithelial tumor types, including head and neck cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The development of low MW, anti-EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has been focused until recently on NSCLC, although responses have been reported for other types of cancer. Erlotinib was the only agent approved based on demonstrating improved survival, which was observed in patients with advanced NSCLC who previously had been treated with chemotherapy. Recent major advances in the EGFR field include the discovery of EGFR somatic mutations in NSCLC that have important implications for biology, treatment, clinical trial design, and methods for mutation detection. Clinical and survival benefits with anti-EGFR agents have been demonstrated in additional tumor types such as head and neck and pancreatic carcinomas. New agents with clinical activity are entering the clinic and new combinatorial approaches with anti-EGFR agents are being explored. Major efforts are, belatedly, attempting to identify molecular markers that can predict patients more likely to respond to anti-EGFR therapy.",

The objective of this study was to analyze whether epidermal growth factor receptor expression predicts tumor response and sphincter preserving in patients treated with preoperative chemoradiation therapy.;This study was conducted on 34 patients with locally-advanced rectal adenocarcinoma who were treated with preoperative chemoradiation therapy. The patients had histologically-proven adenocarcinoma of the rectum with the inferior margin of the tumor located no farther than 6 cm from the anal verge. Preoperative radiotherapy was delivered to the pelvis with 60CO to 50.4 Gy. All patients received simultaneous chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, 300 mg/m(2) IV infused over 24 hr during radiotherapy on days 1 - 5 every week; 28 patients received oxaliplatin 50 - 60 mg/m(2) weekly during radiotherapy. The patients were restaged by physical examination and pelvic CT, between four and six weeks later. Then, they were referred to a surgeon who was expert in gastrointestinal cancer surgery. Subsequently, postsurgical specimen was histopathologically examined and graded according to the Mandard criteria for assessment of pathologic response after neo-adjuvant chemoradiation. Immunohistochemistry for epidermal growth factor receptor was determined at the preradiation biopsy and was evaluated according to the extension and staining intensity.;Fourteen (41%) out of 34 tumors were epidermal growth factor receptor positive. Twenty (59%) patients responded to pelvic preoperative chemoradiation. Sixteen (47%) patients achieved complete response with no residual tumor in the resected specimen; four (12%) were downstaged (partial response). Response to pelvic radiotherapy was observed in 80% of those negative for epidermal growth factor receptor and in 28% of those with positive epidermal growth factor receptor (P = 0.005). Only two of 14 positive epidermal growth factor receptor patients achieved a complete response, while 14 of 20 of the negative epidermal growth factor receptor patients developed complete response. In our study, the sphincter preservation rate was 43% in positive epidermal growth factor receptor patients and 80% in those who did not express epidermal growth factor receptor (P = 0.036).;Epidermal growth factor receptor expression in the diagnostic biopsy of locally-advanced rectal cancer treated with chemoradiation therapy may serve as an important predictor of complete response to preoperative treatment.",

In differentiated cancer, EGFR was more frequently positive in cases of advanced cancer than in those of early stage cancer (p < 0.05). These results suggest that EGFR are expressed or increase in the transition process from early to advanced stage cancer in differentiated gastric cancer.

In addition, EGFR inhibitors have shown significant promise for patients who failed cisplatin-based therapy. In this study, we investigated whether treatment with an EGFR inhibitor improves cisplatin sensitivity in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines. The effects of a combination of AG1478, a specific EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, with cisplatin were evaluated in cultured OSCC cell lines and cisplatin-resistant sublines. Higher expression of EGFR and p-EGFR was found in the two cisplatin-resistant cell lines compared with the corresponding parental cell lines. In addition, augmented inhibition of OSCC cell growth by the combination of AG1478 with cisplatin was found in both cell lines.

Attempts to treat such tumors with epidermal growth factor receptor antagonists resulted in remarkable success in recent studies. Little is known, however, about the efficacy of this therapy in biliary tract cancer. Protein expression of epidermal growth factor receptor, ErbB-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 was assessed in seven human biliary tract cancer cell lines by immunoblotting. In addition, histological sections from 19 patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma were analyzed for epidermal growth factor receptor, ErbB-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 expression by immunohistochemistry. Moreover, we sequenced the cDNA products representing the entire epidermal growth factor receptor coding region of the seven cell lines, and searched for genomic epidermal growth factor receptor amplifications and polysomy by fluorescence in-situ hybridization. Cell growth inhibition by gefitinib erlotinib and NVP-AEE788 was studied in vitro by automated cell counting. In addition, the anti-tumoral effect of erlotinib and NVP-AEE788 was studied in a chimeric mouse model. The anti-tumoral drug mechanism in this model was assessed by MIB-1 antibody staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transfer-mediated dUTP nick end-labelling assay, von Willebrand factor staining, and immunoblotting for p-p42/44 (p-Erk1/2, p-MAPK) and p-AKT. Immunoblotting revealed expression of epidermal growth factor receptor, ErbB-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 in all biliary tract cancer cell lines. EGFR was detectable in six of 19 (32%) extrahepatic human cholangiocarcinoma tissue samples, ErbB-2 in 16 of 19 (84%), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 in nine of 19 (47%). Neither epidermal growth factor receptor mutations nor amplifications or polysomy were found in the seven biliary tract cancer cell lines. Gefitinib, erlotinib and NVP-AEE788 caused a significant growth inhibition in vitro; however, there was a significant difference in efficacy (NVP-AEE788>erlotinib>gefitinib). After 14 days of in-vivo treatment, using the chimeric mouse model, tumors had a significantly reduced volume and mass after NVP-AEE788, but not after erlotinib treatment, as compared with placebo. Reduction of proliferation (signalling via the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway), induction of apoptosis and inhibition of angiogenesis were the main mechanisms of drug action. No significant reduction of anti-apoptotic AKT phosphorylation, however, occurred, which may be a possible counter mechanism of the tumor. Epidermal growth factor receptor, ErbB-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 expression was detectable in biliary tract cancer, and receptor inhibition exerts marked effects on tumor growth in vitro and in vivo, which was strongest for the dual EGFR/ErbB-2 inhibitor NVP-AEE788. Therefore, further clinical evaluation of this new drug for the treatment of biliary tract cancer is recommended.",

While molecular status did not correlate with OS, EGFR and AR positivity were significantly associated with DFS in univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis revealed that EGFR was the only independent predictor of DFS.;The statuses of some molecules are useful to predict DFS in patients with SDC. Ki-67 overexpression suggests that cytotoxic agents are effective for SDC. Since the majority of SDCs express AR, HER2, and/or EGFR, assessing and targeting these molecules are promising strategies to improve the prognosis of unresectable, metastatic or recurrent SDC, and a classification system according to the molecular expression status may be useful to select appropriate therapy.",

Fork-head box O (FOXO) transcription factors, Akt downstream effectors, are important regulators of cell growth. Here, we hypothesized that FOXO1 might be crucial in quercetin-induced growth inhibition in EGFR-overexpressing oral cancer. Quercetin treatment suppressed cell growth by inducing G2 arrest and apoptosis in EGFR-overexpressing HSC-3 and TW206 oral cancer cells. Quercetin inhibited EGFR/Akt activation with a concomitant induction of FOXO1 activation. FOXO1 knockdown attenuated quercetin-induced p21 and FasL expression and subsequent G2 arrest and apoptosis, respectively. Likewise, quercetin suppressed tumor growth in HSC-3 xenograft mice. Taken together, our data indicate that quercetin is an effective anticancer agent and that FOXO1 is crucial in quercetin-induced growth suppression in EGFR-overexpressing oral cancer. ",

Paradoxically, little is known of the expression pattern of these 4 genes in human tumors, and the clinical significance of the 2 most recently discovered ERBB genes, ERBB3 and ERBB4, is unclear. We used a real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay to quantify ERBB family mRNA copy numbers in a large series of breast tumors from patients with known long-term outcome. ERBB gene expression varied widely, by more than 2 orders of magnitude for ERBB1 and ERBB3, more than 3 orders for ERBB2 and more than 4 orders for ERBB4. We found a positive correlation between ERBB3 and ERBB4 mRNA levels, and a negative correlation between the expression of these 2 latter genes and that of ERBB1. Compared to normal breast tissue, ERBB1 was underexpressed (82.3% of tumors), ERBB2 (16.9%) and ERBB3 (46.2%) were overexpressed and ERBB4 was both underexpressed (24.6%) and overexpressed (29.2%). Links were also found between ERBB status on the one hand and Scarff-Bloom-Richardson (SBR) histopathological grade and estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) status on the other hand. Relapse-free survival (RFS) was shorter among patients with ERBB3-overexpressing tumors (p=0.0092) and longer among those with ERBB4-underexpressing tumors (p=0.0085) relative to patients with normal expression of the respective genes; in contrast, RFS was not significantly influenced by ERBB1 or ERBB2 mRNA status. Only ERBB4 status retained prognostic significance in Cox multivariate regression analysis (p=0.015). Our results point to the involvement of several ErbB-specific ligands (amphiregulin and neuregulin 1) and enzymes or adaptor molecules (PI3K, Src, Shc and Grb7) in the ErbB pathway dysregulation associated with breast cancer. These findings reveal a complex expression pattern of ERBB gene family members in breast tumors and suggest that it is this pattern of expression, rather than the expression of individual family members, that should be taken into account when evaluating antitumoral drugs designed to target these receptors.",

The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of non-canonical EGFR pathway in resistance mechanism against cisplatin treatment. Wild type and mutated (exon 19 deletion) EGFR-expressing cells responded similarly to cisplatin by showing MAPK-mediated EGFR phosphorylation. It is interesting that internalization mechanism of EGFR was switched from tyrosine kinase-dependent to p38-dependent fashions, which is involved in a survival pathway that counteracts cisplatin treatment. We therefore introduce a potential combinatorial therapy composed of p38 inhibition and cisplatin to block the activation of EGFR, therefore inducing cancer cell death and apoptosis. ",

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a rate-limiting enzyme for prostanoid biosynthesis, including prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), and plays a key role in both inflammation and cancer. It has been demonstrated that inhibition of COX-2 and PGE(2) receptor signaling results in the suppression of tumor development in a variety of animal models. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying COX-2/PGE(2)-associated inflammation in carcinogenesis have not yet been fully elucidated. In order to study the role of PGE(2)-associated inflammatory responses in tumorigenesis, it is important to use in vivo mouse models that recapitulate human cancer development from molecular mechanisms with construction of tumor microenvironment. We have developed a gastritis model (K19-C2mE mice) in which an inflammatory microenvironment is constructed in the stomach via induction of the COX-2/PGE(2) pathway. We also developed a gastric cancer mouse model (Gan mice) in which the mice develop inflammation-associated gastric tumors via activation of both the COX-2/PGE(2) pathway and Wnt signaling. Expression analyses using these in vivo models have revealed novel mechanisms of the inflammatory responses underlying gastric cancer development. PGE(2)-associated inflammatory responses activate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling through the induction of EGFR ligands and ADAMs that release EGFR ligands from the cell membrane. In Gan mice, a combination treatment with EGFR and COX-2 inhibitors significantly suppresses gastric tumorigenesis. Moreover, PGE(2)-associated inflammation downregulates tumor suppressor microRNA, miR-7, in gastric cancer cells, which suppresses epithelial differentiation. These results indicate that PGE(2)-associated inflammatory responses promote in vivo gastric tumorigenesis via several different molecular mechanisms.",

Exon 18 mutations occur much less frequently at about 4% of all EGFR gene mutations. Together, exon 19 deletion and exon 21 L858R gene substitution are present in about 10% of Caucasian patients and 20-40% of Asian patients with non-small cell lung cancer. T790M gene mutation at exon 20 is associated with acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Early studies showed that activating EGFR gene mutations are most common in patients with adenocarcinoma histology, women, never smokers and those of Asian ethnicity. A recent multi-center phase III trial suggested that frontline epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy with afatinib is associated with improved progression-free survival compared to chemotherapy regardless of race. Moreover, guidelines now suggest EGFR gene mutation testing should be conducted in all patients with lung adenocarcinoma or mixed lung cancers with an adenocarcinoma component, regardless of characteristics such as smoking status, gender or race.

Such tendency existed in the model group (0.7104 +/- 0.0457) but with no significant difference (P = 0.495 > 0.05) and in model serum group (0.8516 +/- 0.0409) with an extremely obvious difference (P = 0.001 < 0.01). Furthermore, the EGFR gene expression in stomach serum group was significantly higher than that in gallbladder serum group (P = 0.00 < 0.01).;The present study shows that serum derived from rats treated with electroacupuncture at stomach meridian acupoints can distinctly increase the EGFR gene expression of gastric mucosal cells. Therefore, there is certain meridian specificity in the serum, which could provide a proof for the TCM theory \"particular relation between meridian and internal organ\".",

The EGFR-tED protein was purified by gel filtration and Ni-NTA affinity chromatography with high purity (>90%) and refolded by a urea gradient size-exclusion chromatography, which could bind its ligand EGF in a concentration-dependent manner. The renatured EGFR was used for biopanning anti-EGFR scFvs from a human synthetic antibody phage display library.

SCLC has been reported to express a low to undetectable level of EGFR. We compared the effects of gefitinib between cell lines with detectable and undetectable EGFR expression. First, we evaluated expression levels of EGFR and HER2/neu by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation respectively; EGFR protein was detected in two of the five SCLC cell lines, whereas HER2/neu was not detected in any. Next, we analyzed expression levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and compared these results with EGFR (HER-1/ErbB1) and HER2/neu (ErbB2) expression levels, as EGFR conducts signals through Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway; gefitinib inhibited phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by EGF addition in cell lines with detectable and undetectable EGFR expression.

At present, anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) cetuximab and panitumumab and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mAb bevacizumab have been incorporated into treatment paradigms for patients with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer. However, many patients simply do not respond to these treatments or eventually acquire resistance following a short course therapy. In this article, we review the literature for studies on the expression patterns, prognostic significance and predictive value of HER (also called erbB) family members and other factors for response to therapy with the HER inhibitors in colorectal cancer. We discuss some of the advances, challenges as well as future opportunities for more effective targeting of the HER receptors using a cocktail of HER inhibitors (e.g. dual and pan HER TKIs, monospecific or bispecific antibodies) in combination with other therapeutic interventions.",

An adenoviral vector was utilized to transduce cells with an EGFr transgene (AdEGFr). Immunoblots were performed to measure EGFr expression and EGFr tyrosine phosphorylation. Radiolabeled ligand studies were employed to test binding of epidermal growth factor to EGFr. Scatchard analyses allowed for quantification of the number of EGFrs. Standard immunohistochemistry was performed to assess EGFr expression. Cellular proliferation was assessed after various combinations of treatment.;Studies of prostate carcinoma cells infected with AdEGFr demonstrated an increase in EGFr expression. This increase in expression correlated with increased function of EGFr. Specifically, increased EGFr expression also resulted in increased ligand binding, ligand-induced internalization of EGFr, and ligand-induced EGFr tyrosine kinase activity that could be blocked with pre-exposure to IMC-C225 (an anti-EGFr monoclonal antibody). Transduction of the LNCaP cells with AdEGFr did not increase the antiproliferative effects of IMC-C225, but did significantly increase IMC-C225-induced radiosensitization as determined by cell proliferation.;Augmentation of EGFr expression, through an adenoviral vector approach in prostate carcinoma cells, resulted in cells that demonstrated greater IMC-C225-induced radiosensitization compared to cells that were not treated with AdEGFr.",

However, these patients show distinct differences in their survival time, possibly due to differing responses to chemotherapy and differing tumor biology. In contrast to histological subtype, grading and staging, which are known to affect a patient's prognosis, the impact of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her-2/neu), topoisomerase IIα and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on survival remain inconclusive. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess their impact on survival in a group of advanced ovarian cancer patients. Tissue microarrays were constructed from specimens of 243 patients. Gene copy and chromosome numbers were evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Scoring for the latter was calculated by considering the percentage of positive tumor cells and the relative staining intensity. FISH results were evaluated by previously published recommendations and correlated with overall survival. Using IHC, 1.6% of the cases that were tested for Her-2/neu and topoisomerase IIα were strongly positive, and 12.3% were positive for EGFR. Using FISH, 4.4% amplifications and 2.1% polysomies for Her-2/neu were identified; topoisomerase IIα showed 2.2% amplifications, 0.4% deletions and 3.5% polysomies. We observed 10.8% high polysomies, but no amplification for EGFR. None of the results obtained by IHC or FISH correlated with overall survival. In general, Her-2/neu, topoisomerase IIα and EGFR may be prognostic factors in ovarian carcinomas. However, within this group of FIGO stage III patients, differences in gene aberration or protein expression were not able to predict differences in survival.",

However, the role of EGFR in gastric cancer (GC) is still elusive. In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression and molecular mechanisms of EGFR in GC cells. Forty cases of GC and the corresponding adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANCT) were collected, and the expression of EGFR was assessed using immunohistochemistry in biopsy samples. Furthermore, EGFR signaling was blocked by constructed recombinant small hairpin RNA lentiviral vector (Lv-shRAGE) used to transfect into human GC SGC-7901 cells. The expression of AKT, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9) was detected by real-time PCR and western blotting assays. Cell proliferative activities and invasive capability were, respectively, determined by MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) and Transwell assays. Cell apoptosis and cycle distribution were analyzed by flow cytometry. EGFR was found highly expressed in cancer tissues compared with the ANCT and correlated with lymph node metastases. Knockdown of EGFR reduced cell proliferation and invasion of GC with decreased expression of AKT, PCNA and MMP-9 and induced cell apoptosis and cycle arrest. Upregulation of EGFR expression is associated with lymph node metastases of GC, and blockade of EGFR signaling suppresses growth and invasion of GC cells through AKT pathway, suggesting that EGFR may represent a potential therapeutic target for this aggressive malignancy.

We have identified the following biological roles for TGF alpha in the stomach, using a variety of primate and rodent models: inhibition of acid secretion; stimulation of mucous cell growth; protection against ethanol- and aspirin-induced injury. This last effect is associated with a time- and dose-dependent increase in levels of insoluble gastric mucin. Based on these known biological actions of TGF alpha, we have examined TGF alpha production in Ménétrier's disease, a disorder characterized by foveolar hyperplasia, hypochlorhydria, and increased gastric mucin content. In four patients with Ménétrier's disease, there was enhanced TGF alpha immunostaining throughout the gastric mucosa. Furthermore, metallothionein (MT)-TGF alpha transgenic mice which overproduce TGF alpha in the stomach exhibit histopathological and biochemical features characteristic of and consistent with the diagnosis of Ménétrier's disease. Thus locally produced TGF alpha may mediate a number of biological processes in the stomach, and its altered production may participate in the pathogenesis of selected pathological states.",

Pleural effusion is a common complication of lung cancer. In this study, we assessed the feasibility of detection of EGFR mutations in samples of pleural effusion fluid. We obtained 43 samples, which was the cell-free supernatant of pleural fluid, from Japanese NSCLC patients, and examined them for EGFR mutations. The epidermal growth factor receptor mutation status was determined by a direct sequencing method (exons 18-21 in EGFR). EGFR mutations were detected in 11 cases (E746_A750del in seven cases, E746_T751del insA in one case, L747_T751del in one case, and L858R in two cases). The EGFR mutations were observed more frequently in women and non-smokers. A comparison between the EGFR mutant status and the response to gefitinib in the 27 patients who received gefitinib revealed that all seven patients with partial response and one of the seven patients with stable disease had an EGFR mutation. No EGFR mutations were detected in the patients with progressive disease. The results suggest that DNA in pleural effusion fluid can be used to detect EGFR mutations and that the EGFR mutation status may be useful as a predictor of the response to gefitinib.",

Current anti-EGFR therapies, such as cetuximab (Erbitux), gefitinib (Iressa), or trastuzumab (Herceptin), target EGFR or HER-2 but not both. Because solid tumors express different EGFRs, identification of inhibitor(s), targeting multiple EGFR family members may provide a therapeutic benefit to a broader patient population. We have identified a natural inhibitor of EGFRs called EGFR-related protein (ERRP), a 53 to 55 kDa protein that is present in most, if not all, normal human epithelial cells. The growth of colon (HCT-116, Caco2, and HT-29) and breast (MDA-MB-468 and SKBR-3) cancer cells expressing varying levels of EGFR, HER-2, and/or HER-4 was inhibited by recombinant ERRP in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, ERRP caused no inhibition of growth of normal mouse fibroblast cell lines (NIH-3T3, NIH-3T3/P67), and the growth of nontransformed rat small intestinal IEC-6 cells expressing relatively low levels of EGFRs was inhibited only at high doses of ERRP. Transforming growth factor-alpha or heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-induced activation of EGFR and HER-2 was inhibited by ERRP in colon and breast cancer cells expressing high levels of EGFR or HER-2. In contrast, cetuximab inhibited the growth- and ligand-induced activation of EGFR in cell lines expressing high levels of EGFR, whereas trastuzumab was effective only in HER-2-overexpressing cells. ERRP and trastuzumab, but not cetuximab, attenuated heregulin-alpha-induced activation of colon and breast cancer cells that expressed high levels of HER-2. Furthermore, ERRP, but not cetuximab or trastuzumab, significantly induced apoptosis of colon and breast cancer cells. None of these agents induced apoptosis of either NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblast or normal rat small intestinal IEC cells. Our results suggest that ERRP is an effective pan-erbB inhibitor and, thus, may be a potential therapeutic agent for a wide variety of epithelial cancers expressing different levels and subclasses of EGFRs.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether cytohesins contribute to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) pathway in colorectal cancer cells. RT-PCR and immunofluorescence experiments were employed to detect the expression of cytohesins in colorectal cancer cell lines. The EGF pathway activation conditions were investigated by examining the phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and intracellular signal-related kinases, with or without chemical inhibition (SecinH3) and knockdown of cytohesins. An MTT assay was conducted to examine the inhibitory effect of SecinH3 and cytohesin-specific siRNA in HT-29 cells. Results demonstrated that the four homologous members of the cytohesin family were expressed in the four colorectal cancer cell lines. Notably, a significantly higher expression level of cytohesin-2 (ARNO) compared with the other three homologous family members was observed. Stimulation with EGF and SecinH3, as well as knockdown of ARNO, are capable of reducing EGF pathway activation and proliferation of HT-29 cells. In conclusion, cytohesins play an essential role in the activation of the EGF pathway and may be a potential target in colorectal cancer therapy.",

All blood samples were obtained before prostate biopsy. Total urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor antigen in serum were measured by specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Gleason score, the number of positive cores, maximum percent of cancer and inflammation were considered on biopsy. Patients determined to have prostate adenocarcinoma underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy. Gleason score, pathological stage (extraprostatic extension), surgical margins, seminal vesicle involvement, perineural infiltration, lymphovascular invasion and cancer volume were evaluated in radical retropubic prostatectomy specimens.;The 30 patients with prostate cancer had significantly higher levels of serum urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor in comparison to those without prostate cancer but not significantly higher levels of prostate specific antigen. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor levels closely correlated in the serum of patients with prostate cancer. In a multivariate model high serum epidermal growth factor receptor increased the probability of positive biopsies by 1.9 times. ROC analysis revealed that serum epidermal growth factor receptor had 93.3% sensitivity and 98% specificity for detecting prostate cancer at a cutoff of 67.9 ng/ml. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor were significantly higher in patients with extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle involvement and perineural infiltration in the radical retropubic prostatectomy specimens.

In fact, ligation/activation of EGFR induces Src-dependent phosphorylation of two critical tyrosine residues of p130CAS, leading to the assembly of a Crk-associated substrate (CAS)/Nck1 complex that promotes Ras-associated protein-1 (Rap1) signaling. Importantly, GTP loading of Rap1 is specifically required for pancreatic carcinoma cell migration on vitronectin but not on collagen. Furthermore, Rap1 activation is required for EGFR-mediated metastasis in vivo without impacting primary tumor growth.

The miRNA miR-7 was selected for further investigation, which included real-time reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of miR-7 levels in different gastric cancer cell lines and tissues and distant non-tumor tissues from patient resections. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), Transwell migration and invasion, and western blot assays were performed to assess tumor cell viability, invasion and gene expression, respectively, after miR-7 transfection. The miRNA microarray profiling revealed 14 upregulated miRNAs (including miR-21, miR-26b and miR-30b) and 19 downregulated miRNAs (including let-7i, miR-7 and miR-622) between gastric cancer and normal cell lines. The qRT-PCR analysis confirmed that reduced miR-7 expression occurred more frequently in poorly and moderately differentiated gastric cancer MGC-803, MKN-45 and SGC-7901 cell lines than in the well-differentiated gastric cancer NCI-N87 cell line, which was consistent with the results for gastric cancer tissues. Expression of miR-7 was downregulated in 86.9% (20/23) of the gastric cancer tissues compared with that in the distant non-tumor tissues. Restoration of miR-7 expression significantly inhibited tumor cell viability, invasiveness and migration when compared with the control cells. Luciferase assay confirmed the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as a target gene of mR-7, and expression of miR-7 significantly suppressed EGFR expression at both the mRNA and protein levels.

While ERBB1, ERBB2 and ERBB3 are often overexpressed or activated in breast cancer, and are oncogenic, the role of ERBB4 in breast cancer is uncertain. Some studies suggest a tumor suppressor role of ERBB4, while other reports suggest an oncogenic potential. Alternative splicing of ERBB4 yields four major protein products, these spliced isoforms differ in the extracellular juxtamembrane domain (JM-a versus JM-b) and cytoplasmic domain (CYT-1 versus CYT-2). Two of these isoforms, JM-a CYT-1 and JM-a CYT-2, are expressed in the mammary gland. Failure to account for isoform-specific functions in previous studies may account for conflicting reports on the role of ERBB4 in breast cancer.;We have produced mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV) -ERBB4 transgenic mice to evaluate potential developmental and carcinogenic changes associated with full length (FL) JM-a ERBB4 CYT-1 versus ERBB4 CYT-2. Mammary tissue was isolated from transgenic mice and sibling controls at various developmental stages for whole mount analysis, RNA extraction, and immunohistochemistry. To maintain maximal ERBB4 expression, transgenic mice were bred continuously for a year after which mammary glands were isolated and analyzed.;Overexpressing FL CYT-1 isoform resulted in suppression of mammary ductal morphogenesis which was accompanied by decreased number of mammary terminal end buds (TEBs) and Ki-67 positive cells within TEBs, while FL CYT-2 isoform had no effect on ductal growth in pubescent mice. The suppressive ductal phenotype in CYT-1 mice disappeared after mid-pregnancy, and subsequent developmental stages showed no abnormality in mammary gland morphology or function in CYT-1 or CYT-2 transgenic mice. However, sustained expression of FL CYT-1 isoform resulted in formation of neoplastic mammary lesions, suggesting a potential oncogenic function for this isoform.;Together, we present isoform-specific roles of ERBB4 during puberty and early pregnancy, and reveal a novel oncogenic property of CYT-1 ERBB4.

Somatic cells undergo replication and division by traversing the tightly regulated cell cycle. Growth factors play a critical role in initiating signaling events stimulating cell cycle progression, which is crucial for their mitogenic and tumorigenic effects. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its ligands are frequently upregulated in human cancers. The oncogenic effects of EGFR include initiation of DNA synthesis, enhanced cell growth, invasion, and metastasis. Specific abrogation of EGFR results in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, or dedifferentiaton of cancer cells. Downregulation of EGFR signaling has therapeutic benefit in preclinical and clinical studies. Therefore, better understanding of the mechanisms of regulation and coordination between the cell cycle, cell growth, and cell death will lead to the development of novel cancer therapies.",

We have previously shown that one of the two intestinal epithelial desmosomal cadherins, desmocollin-2 (Dsc2) loss promotes colonic epithelial carcinoma cell proliferation and tumor formation. In this study we show that loss of the other intestinal desmosomal cadherin, desmoglein-2 (Dsg2) that pairs with Dsc2, results in decreased epithelial cell proliferation and suppressed xenograft tumor growth in mice. Dsg2-deficient cells demonstrated a compensatory increase in Dsc2 expression, and small interfering RNA-mediated loss of Dsc2 restored proliferation in Dsg2-deficient cells. Dsg2 downregulation inhibited epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and cell proliferation through altered phosphorylation of EGFR and downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation in parallel with inhibited EGFR receptor internalization. Additionally, we demonstrated a central role of Dsc2 in controlling EGFR signaling and cell proliferation in intestinal epithelial cells. Consistent with these findings, analyses of human colon cancers demonstrated increased Dsg2 protein expression. Taken together, these data demonstrate that partner desmosomal cadherins Dsg2 and Dsc2 play opposing roles in controlling colonic carcinoma cell proliferation through differential effects on EGFR signaling.

So far, EGFR mutational status of different subtypes of epithelial tumours of the thymus has been analyzed only inappropriately. We have investigated 20 different subtypes of thymomas (type A, AB, and B3) and thymic carcinomas for mutations in exons 18, 19, 20, and 21 of the EGFR gene and performed immunohistochemistry for EGFR. Concerning immunohistochemistry, most of the cases (17/20) had a strong positive staining. Although sequence alterations were found in four samples, none of these alterations led to amino acid changes in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR comparable to those in non-small cell lung cancer. Thus EGFR-expression in thymic tumours does not rely on mutations in critical functional (activation) domains of the EGFR-gene.

Tumorigenesis has been linked with macrophage-mediated chronic inflammation and diverse signalling pathways, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. The precise role of EGFR in HCC is unknown, and EGFR inhibitors have shown disappointing clinical results. Here we discover that EGFR is expressed in liver macrophages in both human HCC and in a mouse HCC model. Mice lacking EGFR in macrophages show impaired hepatocarcinogenesis, whereas mice lacking EGFR in hepatocytes unexpectedly develop more HCC owing to increased hepatocyte damage and compensatory proliferation. Mechanistically, following interleukin-1 stimulation, EGFR is required in liver macrophages to transcriptionally induce interleukin-6, which triggers hepatocyte proliferation and HCC. Importantly, the presence of EGFR-positive liver macrophages in HCC patients is associated with poor survival. This study demonstrates a tumour-promoting mechanism for EGFR in non-tumour cells, which could lead to more effective precision medicine strategies. ",

We hypothesize that inhibition of c-Src and EGFRs will be an effective therapeutic strategy for triple-negative breast cancer. To test our hypothesis, we used a c-Src-specific inhibitor dasatinib (BMS-354825; Bristol-Myers Squibb) and our newly developed ErbB-inhibitory protein (EBIP), a potential pan-ErbB inhibitor, in breast cancer cells. EBIP is composed of 1 to 448 amino acids of the ectodomain of human EGFR to which the 30-amino acid epitope (known as \"U\" region) of rat EGFR-related protein is fused at the COOH-terminal end. The combination of dasatinib and EBIP was found to be highly effective in inhibiting the growth of four different breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-468, SKBr-3, MDA-MB-453, and MDA-MB-231) that express different levels of EGFRs. In EGFR-overexpressing MDA-MB-468 cells, the combination, but not monotherapy, markedly stimulated apoptosis mediated by caspase-9 and caspase-8 and attenuated activation of EGFR and Src as well as tyrosine kinase activity. EBIP also inhibited heregulin-induced activation of HER-2 and HER-3 in MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells. The combination therapy was highly effective in suppressing tumor growth ( approximately 90% inhibition) in MDA-MB-468-derived xenografts in severe combined immunodeficient mice. The latter could be attributed to induction of apoptosis. We conclude that combining dasatinib and EBIP could be an effective therapeutic strategy for breast cancer by targeting EGFRs and Src signaling.",

Several important activating EGFR mutations have now been identified, which correlate strongly with response to treatment with these agents. Multiple randomised controlled trials have confirmed the association between the presence of activating EGFR mutations and objective response to gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib, thus demonstrating their superiority over platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment for NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation-positive tumours, and resulting in approval of these agents for use in this setting. It can be tempting to compare outcome data across multiple clinical trials and agents; however, substantial differences in methodology between studies, including investigator versus independent assessment and differences in patient eligibility, makes such comparisons fraught with difficulty. This critical review provides an overview of the evolution of the methodology used in eight phase III trials investigating first-line targeted treatment of NSCLC, identifies key differences in methodology and reporting, and critically assesses how these differences should be taken into account when interpreting the findings from such trials.

We have designed an adenovirus-expressing antisense EGFR and have investigated its effect on the growth of gastric cancer in vitro and in vivo. Following infection with EGFR antisense RNA-expressing adenovirus (Ad-EAS), the cell surface EGFR protein levels of infected cancer cells were markedly reduced, and the in vitro growth of Ad-EAS-infected cells was significantly inhibited relative to control-infected cells in all three gastric cancer cell lines (AGS, KKLS, and MKN28) studied here (P < .0002). In a nude mouse subcutaneous tumor system, in vivo tumor growth of MKN28 was significantly inhibited after Ad-EAS treatment, and inhibition on day 48 was 93% by volume compared with that of untreated controls.

Here, we present a detailed dissection of the EGFR/PI3K pathway, composed of sequencing of the core pathway components, and high-resolution genomic copy number assessment. Mutations were found in PIK3CA (6%), but no point mutations were observed in other pathway genes such as PTEN and EGFR. In contrast, we observed frequent copy number alterations of genes in the pathway, including PIK3CA, EGFR, protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor S (PTPRS), and RICTOR. In total, activating genetic pathway alterations were identified in 74% of head and neck tumors. Importantly, intragenic microdeletions of the EGFR phosphatase PTPRS were frequent (26%), identifying this gene as a target of 19p13 loss. PTPRS loss promoted EGFR/PI3K pathway activation, modulated resistance to EGFR inhibition, and strongly determined survival in lung cancer patients with activating EGFR mutations. These findings have important implications for our understanding of head and neck cancer tumorigenesis and for the use of targeted agents for this malignancy.",

Expression levels are, however, only one factor that determines the physiological activity of a receptor. For some surface receptors, their distribution on the cell surface, especially their clustering, provides additional mechanisms for regulation. To access this spatial information robust assays are required that provide detailed insight into the organization of cell surface receptors on nanometer length scales. In this manuscript, we demonstrate through combination of scattering spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and generalized multiple particle Mie theory (GMT) simulations that the density- and morphology-dependent spectral response of Au nanoparticle (NP) immunolabels bound to the epidermal growth factor receptors ErbB1 and ErbB2 encodes quantitative information of both the cell surface expression and spatial clustering of the two receptors in different unliganded in vitro cancer cell lines (SKBR3, MCF7, A431). A systematic characterization of the collective spectral responses of NPs targeted at ErbB1 and ErbB2 at various NP concentrations indicates differences in the large-scale organization of ErbB1 and ErbB2 in cell lines that overexpress these receptors. Validation experiments in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) confirm that NPs targeted at ErbB1 on A431 are more strongly clustered than NPs bound to ErbB2 on SKBR3 or MCF7 at overall comparable NP surface densities. This finding is consistent with the existence of larger receptor clusters for ErbB1 than for ErbB2 in the plasma membranes of the respective cells.",

Recently, efforts have been made to develop novel 4-anilinoquinazoline and pyridopyrimidine derivatives to inhibit EGFR and ErbB2 kinases simultaneously. In this study, we tested the efficacy of a novel reversible dual inhibitor GW572016 compared with the selective EGFR and ErbB2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) AG1478 and AG879 and their combination, using the human colon adenocarcinoma GEO mode. GEO cells depend on multiple ErbB receptors for aberrant growth. A synergistic effect on inhibition of cell proliferation associated with induction of apoptosis was observed from the combination of AG1478 and AG879. Compared with AG1478 or AG879, the single TKI compound GW572016 was a more potent inhibitor of GEO cell proliferation and was able to induce apoptosis at lower concentrations. Western blot analysis revealed that AG1478 and AG879 were unable to suppress both EGFR and ErbB2 activation as well as the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and AKT pathways as single agents. In contrast, GW572016 suppressed the activation of EGFR, ErbB2, MAPK, and AKT in a concentration-dependent manner. Finally, in vivo studies showed that GW572016 treatment efficiently blocked GEO xenograft growth at a dose range of 30 to 200 mg/kg with a twice-daily schedule. In summary, our study indicates that targeting both EGFR and ErbB2 simultaneously could enhance therapy over that of single agents directed at EGFR or ErbB2 in cancers that can be identified as being primarily heterodimer-dependent.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of EGFR and c-kit in breast cancer with special focus on the basal-like phenotype (BLP) and other prognostic factors in an African population. We analyzed 65 archival tissues immunohistologically. EGFR and/or c-kit were expressed in 55% of basal-like tumors. Expression of EGFR and/or c-kit was strongly associated with high histologic grade (P=0.001), high nuclear grade (P=0.017), high mitotic counts (P=0.002), ER negativity (P=0.003), PR negativity (P=0.007), and HER2 negativity (P=0.014). EGFR and/or c-kit positive tumors were more likely to express the BLP (OR 9.1, CI 2.6-32.0, P<0.0005) than the negative tumors. In conclusion, there is a high expression of EGFR and/or c-kit in basal-like breast carcinoma in this series from Uganda and their expression is associated with features of poor prognosis.

Unlike the mutant oncogene, the EGFR requires activation by binding of ligand to its extracellular (EC) domain, whereas its cellular effects depend on activation of its cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase. The overexpression of EGFR and its ligands in several human carcinomas and their association with accelerated tumor progression provided a rationale for targeting this network with tumor-selective strategies. Two of those antireceptor approaches, both solidly based on the known structure and function of the EGFR, are discussed. The first strategy involves the development of humanized monoclonal antibodies against the nonconserved receptor's EC domain. These antibodies block ligand binding and can induce receptor endocytosis and downregulation. The second approach is the generation of ATP mimetics that compete with ATP for binding to the receptor's kinase pocket, thus disabling signal transduction. Preclinical and early clinical studies already suggest that both of these approaches, either alone or in combination with standard anticancer therapies, will be able to alter the natural history of EGFR-expressing cancers with little to no toxicity to the tumor-bearing host.",

Essential element of such pathways is the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a member of the HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases. One of the most important issues in cancer, which attracted the attention of clinical oncologists, is the potential use of targeted therapies. EGFR signaling pathway is implicated in the control of cell survival, proliferation, metastasis and angiogenesis. EGFR is, therefore, an appealing target for molecular-targeted cancer therapy as it is expressed in a variety of solid tumors (colorectal, breast, head and neck, etc.). Receptor antagonists that target EGFR have already been of high interest for a number of years. Multiple therapeutic strategies have been developed to target EGFR, including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), ligand-toxin conjugates, and antisense oligonucleotides. In particular, mAbs block ligand from binding to the extracellular domain of the receptor. Two mAbs that block EGFR (erbB1), cetuximab and panitumumab, have been approved by FDA. Cetuximab is a chimeric IgG1 anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, whereas panitumumab is a fully human IgG2 anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody.

Tumor samples were obtained from 126 patients with gastric adenocarcinomas who underwent a radical gastrectomy between 1999 and 2002. The expression of phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3), p-mTOR and EGFR was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining. The relations of these to clinicopathological factors and outcomes were assessed. The expression of p-STAT3 p-mTOR and EGFR positively correlated with the following variables related to tumor progression: the depth of tumor invasion (T1 vs. T2-4; p<0.001, p=0.036 and p<0.001, respectively), lymph node involvement (p=0.008, p=0.027 and p=0.007) and tumor stage (I vs. II-IV; p<0.001, p=0.041 and p<0.001).

Recent studies have provided compelling evidence that irreversible ErbB inhibitors have the potential to override this resistance. Here, we found that AST1306, a novel anilino-quinazoline compound, inhibited the enzymatic activities of wild-type epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ErbB2 as well as EGFR resistant mutant in both cell-free and cell-based systems. Importantly, AST1306 functions as an irreversible inhibitor, most likely through covalent interaction with Cys797 and Cys805 in the catalytic domains of EGFR and ErbB2, respectively. Further studies showed that AST1306 inactivated pathways downstream of these receptors and thereby inhibited the proliferation of a panel of cancer cell lines. Although the activities of EGFR and ErbB2 were similarly sensitive to AST1306, ErbB2-overexpressing cell lines consistently exhibited more sensitivity to AST1306 antiproliferative effects. Consistent with this, knockdown of ErbB2, but not EGFR, decreased the sensitivity of SK-OV-3 cells to AST1306. In vivo, AST1306 potently suppressed tumor growth in ErbB2-overexpressing adenocarcinoma xenograft and FVB-2/N(neu) transgenic breast cancer mouse models, but weakly inhibited the growth of EGFR-overexpressing tumor xenografts. Tumor growth inhibition induced by a single dose of AST1306 in the SK-OV-3 xenograft model was accompanied by a rapid (within 2 h) and sustained (≥24 h) inhibition of both EGFR and ErbB2, consistent with an irreversible inhibition mechanism. Taken together, these results establish AST1306 as a selective, irreversible ErbB2 and EGFR inhibitor whose growth-inhibitory effects are more potent in ErbB2-overexpressing cells.",

DNA isolated from individual elements was assessed for EGFR and KIT activating mutations. All assessable cases were negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and (except one) HER2. The majority were positive for cytokeratin 5/6 (58%), p63 (59%), and EGFR overexpression (66%); 24% were KIT positive. No EGFR or KIT activating mutations were present; 26% of the primary metaplastic breast carcinomas were fluorescence in situ hybridization-positive, displaying high EGFR copy number secondary to aneusomy (22%) and amplification (4%). We report here that metaplastic breast carcinoma is a basal-like breast cancer lacking EGFR and KIT activating mutations but exhibiting high EGFR copy number (primarily via aneusomy), suggesting that EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors should be evaluated in this molecular subset of breast carcinomas.",

Epidermal growth factor receptor mutations were observed in 60 tumours (39.0%), all of which were adenocarcinoma. Among the patients with adenocarcinoma (n=108), EGFR mutations were more frequently observed in nonsmokers than former smokers or current smokers (83.0, 50.0, 15.2%, respectively), in women than men (76.3 vs 34.0%), in tumours with bronchio-alveolar component than those without bronchio-alveolar component (78.9 vs 42.9%), and in well or moderately differentiated tumours than poorly differentiated tumours (72.0, 64.4, 34.2%). No tumours with EGFR mutations had any K-ras codon 12 mutations, which were well-known smoking-related gene mutations.

Basal-like tumors presented an activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway linked to frequent EGFR gains and activation of an EGFR autocrine loop. We used a 40-gene expression classifier derived from human tumors to identify human bladder cancer cell lines and a chemically induced mouse model of bladder cancer corresponding to human basal-like bladder cancer.

In this study, the effect of EBP50 expression on CC cell proliferation and prognosis of CC patients by regulating EGFR signaling was investigated. We found that EBP50 expression level was significantly downregulated in CC tissues. EBP50 expression negatively correlated with CC cell proliferation, cell cycle and the activation of EGFR-mediated ERK signaling. EBP50 knockdown abolished its inhibition on EGF-induced ERK activation, suggesting EBP50 regulated EGFR signaling. In order to further explore EBP50 regulated EGFR signaling via interaction, we constructed EBP50_DD mutant which disrupted its interaction with EGFR. EBP50_DD overexpression attenuated the inhibition of EBP50_WT on EGFR-mediated ERK signaling, further revealing EBP50 regulated EGFR signaling via its interaction with EGFR. EGFR activation was associated with poor prognosis of CC patients. EBP50 could not predict the prognosis of all CC patients. However, after ruling out patients with egfr/ErbB mutation or copy number variation (CNV) and (chemo)radiation, which caused continuous EGFR activation and affected the prognosis of patients, respectively, EBP50 expression level exhibited the prognosis prediction ability, revealing EBP50 affected prognosis of CC patients via regulating EGFR signaling.

There is a reported synergistic relationship between trastuzumab and ZD1839 therapy in patients with breast cancer. Although EGFR is the preferred dimerization partner for HER-2, it is unclear whether expression of these 2 interrelated receptors in a given patient with breast cancer would be parallel or mutually exclusive.;To assess EGFR status in primary breast carcinoma versus metastatic central nervous system (CNS) sites and to compare results with HER-2/neu status in the same tumor.;Central nervous system metastases (n = 51) from 33 patients and corresponding primary breast cancer specimens, when available (n = 11), were immunohistochemically stained for EGFR using a monoclonal mouse anti-EGFR antibody (clone 31G7) that recognizes both the wild-type form and the 145-kd variant III form of EGFR. The sections were evaluated by visual and image analysis techniques, and results were compared to previously assessed HER-2/neu status.;Epidermal growth factor receptor expression was found in CNS metastases from 39% of patients, with 82% concordance between the EGFR status of the primary breast and metastatic sites, and 92% concordance between the EGFR status among multiple CNS metastases in a given patient. Epidermal growth factor receptor and HER-2/neu status were concordant at the primary site in only 45% of patients. Additionally, EGFR and HER-2/neu status were concordant among multiple CNS metastases per individual case in only 45% of patients.;Thirty-nine percent of patients with metastatic breast cancer express EGFR, with parallel expression between metastatic sites and the primary neoplasm in 82% of the cases. The discordance in 18% of the cases, however, suggests that anti-EGFR agents might not show equal efficacy against metastatic tumor deposits and the primary tumor within a given patient. An additional corollary for pathologists based on this nonhomogeneity of receptor expression is that both the primary breast and multiple metastatic tumor deposits may need to be individually assessed for EGFR status. In our study, most metastatic tumor deposits showed expression for either EGFR or HER-2/neu, and less often for both, implying that drug therapies could be individualized for patients based on test results for both receptors.",

To functionally dissect RAS-mediated resistance, we have studied clinically approved anti-EGFR antibodies, cetuximab and panitumumab, in cancer models. Both antibodies were equally cytotoxic in vitro. However, cetuximab, which also triggers antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), was more effective than panitumumab in vivo. Oncogenic RAS neutralized the activity of both antibodies in vivo. Mechanistically, RAS upregulated BCL-XL in cancer cell lines and in primary colorectal cancers. Suppression of BCL-XL by short hairpin RNA or treatment with a BH3 mimetic overcame RAS-mediated antibody resistance. In conclusion, RAS-mutant tumors escape anti-EGFR antibody-mediated receptor blockade as well as ADCC in vivo.

Mutations in EGFR itself are, however, rare, and the mechanisms regulating EGFR activation remain elusive. Leucine-rich immunoglobulin repeats-1 (LRIG1), an inhibitor of EGFR activity, is one of four genes identified that predict patient survival across solid tumour types including breast, lung, melanoma, glioma, and bladder. We show that deletion of Lrig1 is sufficient to promote murine airway hyperplasia through loss of contact inhibition and that re-expression of LRIG1 in human lung cancer cells inhibits tumourigenesis. LRIG1 regulation of contact inhibition occurs via ternary complex formation with EGFR and E-cadherin with downstream modulation of EGFR activity. We find that LRIG1 LOH is frequent across cancers and its loss is an early event in the development of human squamous carcinomas. Our findings imply that the early stages of squamous carcinoma development are driven by a change in amplitude of EGFR signalling governed by the loss of contact inhibition.",

Although epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is important and well studied with respect to NSCLC progression, little is known about how miRNAs mediate EGFR signaling to modulate tumorigenesis. To identify miRNAs that target EGFR, we performed a bioinformatics analysis and found that miR-542-5p down-regulates EGFR mRNA and protein expression in human lung cancer cells (H3255, A549, Hcc827). We observed increases in EGFR association with Ago2 in miR-542-5p-transfected cells. Interestingly, we observed an inverse correlation of miR-542-5p expression and EGFR protein levels in human lung cancer tissue samples, suggesting that miR-542-5p directly targets EGFR mRNA. Furthermore, we found that miR-542-5p inhibited the growth of human lung cancer cells.

We found that breast tumor kinase (Brk)/protein-tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6), a nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase highly expressed in most human breast tumors, interacted with EGFR and sustained ligand-induced EGFR signaling. We demonstrate that Brk inhibits ligand-induced EGFR degradation through uncoupling activated EGFR from casitas B-lineage lymphoma-mediated EGFR ubiquitination. In addition, upon activation by EGFR, Brk directly phosphorylated Y845 in the EGFR kinase domain, thereby further potentiating EGFR kinase activity. Experimental elevation of Brk conferred resistance of breast cancer cells to cetuximab (an EGFR-blocking antibody)-induced inhibition of cell signaling and proliferation, whereas knockdown of Brk sensitized the cells to cetuximab by inducing apoptosis.

To examine its role, we used an immunohistochemical approach to detect epiregulin expression in NSCLC biopsy samples and pharmacologic and genetic approaches to inhibit epiregulin in cultured NSCLC cells. In NSCLC biopsy samples, epiregulin was detected in 237 of 366 (64.7%) tumors, which correlated with nodal metastasis and a shorter duration of survival. In EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines, treatment with a small-molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor diminished mRNA levels of the gene encoding epiregulin (EREG). The ability of EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells to invade through Matrigel in vitro was inhibited by treatment with an anti-epiregulin neutralizing antibody or by transfection with an EREG short hairpin RNA. Collectively, these findings show that epiregulin expression correlated with advanced disease, was EGFR dependent, and conferred invasive properties on NSCLC cells.

Several plant polyphenols including the type III polyketide synthase products (genistein, curcumin, resveratrol, and epigallocatechin-3-galate) possess chemopreventive activity, primarily as a result of RTK inhibition. However, only a small fraction of the polyphenolic structural universe has been evaluated. Along these lines, we have developed an in vitro route to the synthesis and subsequent screening of unnatural polyketide analogues with N-acetylcysteamine (SNAc) starter substrates and malonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and methylmalonyl-CoA as extender substrates. The resulting polyketide analogues possessed a similar structural polyketide backbone (aromatic-2-pyrone) with variable side chains. Screening chalcone synthase (CHS) reaction products against BT-474 cells resulted in identification of several trifluoromethylcinnamoyl-based polyketides that showed strong suppression of the HER2-associated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, yet did not inhibit the growth of nontransformed MCF-10A breast cells (IC(50)>100 microM). Specifically, 4-trifluoromethylcinnamoyl pyrone (compound 2 e) was highly potent (IC(50)<200 nM) among the test compounds toward proliferation of several breast cancer cell lines. This breadth of activity likely stems from the ability of compound 2 e to inhibit the phosphorylation of HER1, HER2, and HER3. Therefore, these polyketide analogues might prove to be useful drug candidates for potential breast cancer therapy.",

Studies on Western and Japanese lung cancers have indicated substantial differences in the EGFR mutation frequency between these populations. To investigate the prevalence of EGFR in another distinct ethnic group, EGFR alterations were studied in 47 consecutive non small cell lung cancers from Saudi Arabia by immunohistochemistry, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and DNA sequencing. Detectable EGFR expression was seen in 69.8% of 43 interpretable cancers. Epidermal growth factor receptor amplification, present in 15.3% of 39 analyzable cancers, was strongly associated with high levels of EGFR expression (P = .0047). Only 1 exon 18-21 mutation was seen among 34 lung cancers that could be successfully sequenced. It is concluded that EGFR exon 18-21 mutations are rare in Middle East patients with lung cancer and occur in a similar range as in Western patients.

        "Doc_abstract":"Neoplastic transformation is often related to abnormal activation of growth factor receptors and their signaling pathways. The concept of targeting specific tumorigenic receptors and/or signaling molecules has been validated by the development and successful clinical application of drugs acting against the epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu, Erb2), the epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (EGFR, HER1), the Brc-Abl kinase, the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and c-kit. This review will focus on the next promising therapeutic target, the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR). IGF-IR has been implicated in a number of neoplastic diseases, including several common carcinomas. From a pharmaceutical standpoint, of particular importance is that IGF-IR appears to be required for many transforming agents (genetic, viral, chemical) to act, but is not obligatory for the function of normal adult cells. The tumorigenic potential of IGF-IR is mediated through its antiapoptotic and transforming signaling, and in some cases through induction of prometastatic pathways. Preclinical studies demonstrated that downregulation of IGF-IR reversed the neoplastic phenotype and sensitized cells to antitumor treatments. The strategies to block IGF-IR function employed anti-IGF-IR antibodies, small-molecule inhibitors of the IGF-IR tyrosine kinase, antisense oligodeoxynucleotides and antisense RNA, small inhibitory RNA, triple helix, dominant-negative mutants, and various compounds reducing ligand availability. The experience with these strategies combined with the knowledge gained with current anti-growth factor receptor drugs should streamline the development of anti-IGF-IR therapeutics.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The development of the gastric mucosa is controlled by hormones, growth factors and feeding behavior. Early weaning (EW), which means the abrupt interruption of suckling, increases proliferation and differentiation in the rat gastric epithelium. Transforming growth factor alpha (TGFalpha) is secreted in the stomach, binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and may control cell proliferation, differentiation and migration. Here, we investigated the influence of suckling-weaning transition on the differentiation of mucous neck cells in the stomach and its association to the expression of TGFalpha and EGFR. Fifteen-day-old Wistar rats were divided into two groups: suckling (control), in which pups were kept with the dam, and early weaning (EW), in which rats were separated from their mother and fed with hydrated powdered chow. TGFalpha and EGFR levels were increased at 18 days in EW animals compared to control ones (p<0.05). Histochemical reactions with Periodic Acid-Schiff reagent+Alcian Blue or Bandeiraea simplicifolia II lectin were used to stain the mucous neck cells and showed an increase in this cell population throughout EW, which was more pronounced at 17 days when compared to suckling pups (p<0.05). These morphological results were confirmed by RT-PCR for mucin 6. The levels of mucin 6 mRNA were higher in EW animals from the 16th to the 18th day (1-3 days post-weaning) when compared to the respective control group. Inhibition of EGFR through AG1478 administration to EW animals prevented the expansion of mucous neck cell population induced by EW (p<0.05). Therefore, early weaning up regulated TGFalpha/EGFR expression and induced differentiation of mucous neck cells. Moreover, we showed that EGFR takes part in the maturation of this cell population. We conclude that regular suckling-weaning transition is crucial to guarantee the development of the gastric mucosa.",

To clarify the mechanism underlying the aggressive behavior of thymic carcinoma, we examined the clinicopathologic features, aberrant methylation patterns of the tumor suppressor genes, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRs) mutation in both thymic carcinomas and thymomas. Clinical data of 11 thymic cancers and 13 thymomas were reviewed. Resected samples of 5 thymic cancers and 6 thymomas selected from 24 cases were used for methylation and mutation studies. Positive tumor markers were more frequent in thymic cancers than in thymomas (p=0.0233), and the methylation index, which reflects the overall methylation pattern, was significantly higher in thymic carcinomas (p=0.0053). No tumors showed a mutation of EGFR, KRAS, and HER2.

In this study, we show that NSCLCs with EGFR mutation express higher programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) than NSCLCs with wild type EGFR. The EGFR activation is also associated with high expression of PD-L1. The EGFR-TKI gefitinib can reduce PD-L1 expression, via inhibiting NF-κB, in EGFR mutant NSCLC in vitro and in vivo.

In addition to trastuzumab, the first humanized antibody that was approved for the therapy of solid tumors by the FDA, now many humanized antibodies are in late clinical trials, or already approved.

Nineteen cases were assessed for beta-catenin gene exon 3 mutations, expression of MMP-7, and expression/gene amplification of EGFR, HER-2, and cyclin D1. beta-catenin was expressed in all 96 high-grade neuroendocrine tumors, the vast majority (94%) showing >50% immunopositive cells. A disarrayed immunoreactivity, however, was commonly encountered consisting in variably altered membrane-associated patterns of staining along with progressive accumulation of cytoplasmic immunoreactivity. In LCNEC, but not in SCLC, the disarrayed patterns correlated with EGFR and HER-2 protein expression. beta-catenin nuclear accumulation was found in nine tumors, including seven LCNEC and two SCLC, and was always associated with disarrayed immunoreactivity and increased MMP-7, but not cyclin D1 expression. These cases, however, did not show beta-catenin gene mutations or EGFR and HER-2 gene amplification or expression. No association was found between nuclear beta-catenin and any clinicopathological variable including patients' survival. The subcellular compartmentalization of beta-catenin is profoundly altered in high-grade pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors.

We demonstrated that ZIP acts as a transcription repressor through the recruitment of the nucleosome remodelling and deacetylase complex. Transcriptional target analysis revealed that ZIP regulates several cellular signalling pathways including EGFR pathways that are critically involved in cell proliferation, survival, and migration. We showed that ZIP inhibits cell proliferation and suppresses breast carcinogenesis, and that ZIP depletion leads to a drastic tumour growth in vivo. We found that ZIP is downregulated in breast carcinomas and that its level of expression is negatively correlated with that of EGFR. Our data indicate that ZIP is a novel transcription repressor and a potential tumour suppressor.

Strikingly, Nsdhl inactivation antagonized the growth of skin tumors while having little effect on normal skin. Loss of Nsdhl induced the expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1, reduced the expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), decreased intracellular cholesterol, and was dependent on the liver X receptor (LXR) α. Importantly, EGFR signaling opposed LXRα effects on cholesterol homeostasis, whereas an EGFR inhibitor synergized with LXRα agonists in killing cancer cells.

When treatments were combined primarily additive effects were observed. While radioresistance tended to be associated with a high level of phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR; P = 0.09), cetuximab-resistant cells had low levels of pEGFR (P = 0.13).

Three hundred fifty small cell lung cancers, adenocarcinomas (AC), squamous cell carcinomas (SqCC), and large cell carcinomas were analyzed using a combination of techniques for the analysis of protein expression, gene copy numbers, and mutations. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining with antibodies for the EGFR mutations L858R and del E746-A750 revealed intratumoral heterogeneity and several discrepant cases when compared to mutation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based analysis. The frequencies of these two mutations, when considering IHC staining with mutation-specific antibodies in a cohort of 298 cases and subsequent confirmation by PCR, were 10 % in AC and <2 % in SqCC. Furthermore, screening by sequencing of EGFR in a cohort of 52 lung AC and squamous carcinomas demonstrated a more diverse mutation spectrum, not covered by the mutation-specific antibodies. High expression of total EGFR protein was correlated to high gene copy numbers but did not reflect the mutational status of the tumors. We believe that the mutation spectra in a Southern Swedish population is too diverse to be covered by the mutation-specific antibodies, and we also raise some other issues regarding the use of the mutation-specific antibodies, for example concerning heterogeneous expression of the mutated protein, optimal antibody dilution, and discrepancies between staining results and PCR.",

Recently, emerging evidence has suggested that the expression of PD-L1 is related to the mutation status of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Moreover, the activation of the EGFR signaling pathway can induce expression of PD-L1. In the present study, we demonstrated that activated EGFR can upregulate the expression of PD-L1 through the interleukin 6/Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (IL-6/JAK/STAT3) signaling pathway in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Cells treated with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) can downregulate the activation of the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 pathway, which subsequently reduces the expression of PD-L1. Furthermore, silencing of PD-L1 expression in NSCLC cells correlated with inhibition of cell proliferation and enhanced tumor cell apoptosis. In summary, our research indicates that EGFR is involved in the regulation of PD-L1 expression and cell proliferation via the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway in NSCLC. The present study suggests the potential of combined targeted therapy with immunotherapy in the treatment of NSCLC. ",

To test the hypothesis that these mutations cause constitutive EGF receptor signaling, and to investigate its mechanistic basis, we expressed representative examples in a null background and analysed their biochemical properties. Each mutation caused significant EGF-independent tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR, and allowed the receptor to promote Ba/F3 cell mitogenesis in the absence of EGF, arguing that these are oncogenic mutations. Active mutated receptors are present at the cell surface and are fully competent to bind EGF. Recent structural studies show that the inactive EGFR tyrosine kinase domain is autoinhibited by intramolecular interactions between its activation loop and alphaC helix. We find that mutations predicted to disrupt this autoinhibitory interaction (including several that have not been described in NSCLC) elevate EGF-independent tyrosine kinase activity, thus providing new insight into how somatic mutations activate EGFR and other ErbB family members.",

Although erbB2 has no known physiologic ligand, it can form complexes with other members of the family and undergo transactivation of its very potent kinase activity, thereby initiating downstream signaling and cell proliferation. ErbB2 is a frequent pathologic marker in ductal invasive breast carcinomas and is targeted by using a specific humanized monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab (Herceptin). The antibody is effective in only 20% to 50% of erbB2-positive tumors, and this resistance, as yet poorly understood, constitutes a major therapeutic challenge.;Magnetic microspheres coated with ligands or antibodies are widely used for separation of proteins and cells and allow localized, high intensity, and precisely timed stimulation of cells. We used EGF- and trastuzumab-covered paramagnetic microspheres, quantitative confocal laser scanning microscopy, and digital image processing to investigate the (trans)activation of and local signal propagation from erbB1 and erbB2 on trastuzumab sensitive and resistant carcinoma cell lines expressing these receptors at high levels.;On A431 cells expressing high levels of endogenous erbB1 and transfected erbB2-mYFP (A4-erbB2-mYFP F4 cell line), EGF-coupled-microspheres activated erbB1 and transactivated erbB2-mYFP. In two other cell lines with comparable erbB2 expression but lower levels of erbB1, EGF microspheres transactivated erbB2 less efficiently. Trastuzumab in solution activated erbB2 on A4-erbB2-mYFP and the trastuzumab sensitive SKBR-3 cells, but only negligibly on the resistant JIMT-1 cells that showed a 10 times higher K(d) for the antibody. Nevertheless, pronounced erbB2 activation and tyrosine phosphorylation could be detected after stimulation with trastuzumab-coupled microspheres in all cell lines, although transactivation of erbB1 was negligible. Receptor phosphorylation was restricted to the immediate proximity of the microspheres, i.e., receptor clusters external to these locations remained inactive.;ErbB1 ligand and erbB2 specific antibody attached to magnetic microspheres are efficient tools in assessing erbB activation, localized signal propagation, and erbB heterodimer formation.

We have previously found that EGFR stability plays a key role in cell survival after chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is known to stabilize mutant EGFR and ErbB2, but its role in cancers with wild-type (WT) WT-EGFR is unclear. In this report, we demonstrate that fully mature, membrane-bound WT-EGFR interacts with HSP90 independent of ErbB2. Further, the HSP90 inhibitors geldanamycin (GA) and AT13387 cause a decrease in WT-EGFR in cultured head and neck cancer cells. This decrease results from a significantly reduced half-life of WT-EGFR. WT-EGFR was also lost in head and neck xenograft specimens after treatment with AT13387 under conditions that inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival of the mice. Our findings demonstrate that WT-EGFR is a client protein of HSP90 and that their interaction is critical for maintaining both the stability of the receptor as well as the growth of EGFR-dependent cancers. Furthermore, these findings support the search for specific agents that disrupt HSP90's ability to act as an EGFR chaperone.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/ErbB2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase belonging to the EGFR/ErbB family and is overexpressed in 20-30% of human breast cancers. Since there is a growing effort to develop pharmacological inhibitors of the HER2 kinase for the treatment of breast cancer, it is clinically valuable to rationalize how specific mutations impact the molecular mechanism of receptor activation. Although several crystal structures of the ErbB kinases have been solved, the precise mechanism of HER2 activation remains unknown, and it has been suggested that HER2 is unique in its requirement for phosphorylation of Y877, a key tyrosine residue located in the activation loop (A-loop). In our studies, discussed here, we have investigated the mechanisms that are important in HER2 kinase domain regulation and compared them with the other ErbB family members, namely EGFR and ErbB4, to determine the molecular basis for HER2's unique mode of activation. We apply computational simulation techniques at the atomic level and at the electronic structure (quantum mechanical) level to elucidate details of the mechanisms governing the kinase domains of these ErbB members. Through analysis of our simulation results, we have discovered potential regulatory mechanisms common to EGFR, HER2, and ErbB4, including a tight coupling between the A-loop and catalytic loop that may contribute to alignment of residues required for catalysis in the active kinase. We further postulate an autoinhibitory mechanism whereby the inactive kinase is stabilized through sequestration of catalytic residues. In HER2, we also predict a role for phosphorylated Y877 in bridging a network of hydrogen bonds that fasten the A-loop in its active conformation, suggesting that HER2 may be unique among the ErbB members in requiring A-loop tyrosine phosphorylation for functionality. In EGFR, HER2, and ErbB4, we discuss the possible effects of activating mutations. Delineation of the activation mechanism of HER2 in the context of the other ErbB members is crucial for understanding how the activated kinase might interact with downstream molecules and couple to signaling cascades that promote cancer. Our comparative analysis furthers insight into the mechanics of activation of the HER2 kinase and enables us to predict the effect of an identified insertion mutation on HER2 activation. Further understanding of the mechanism of HER2 kinase activation at the atomic scale and how it couples to downstream signaling at the cellular scale will elucidate predictive molecular phenotypes that may indicate likelihood of response to specific therapies for HER2-mediated cancers.",

The formation of EGFR clusters is mediated by the ionic interaction between the anionic lipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in the plasma membrane and the juxtamembrane (JM) region of EGFR. Disruption of EGFR clustering by PIP2 depletion or JM region mutation impairs EGFR activation and downstream signaling. Furthermore, JM region mutation in constitutively active EGFR mutant attenuates its capability of cell transformation. Collectively, our findings highlight the key roles of anionic phospholipids in EGFR signaling and function, and reveal a novel mechanism to explain the aberrant activation of EGFR in cancers. ",

Patients with activating mutations of the EGFR gene show sensitivity to, and clinical benefit from, treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKls). First generation reversible ATP-competitive EGFR-TKls, gefitinib and erlotinib, are effective as first, second-line or maintenance therapy. Despite initial benefit, most patients develop resistance within a year, 50-60% of cases being related to the appearance of a T790M gatekeeper mutation. Newer, irreversible EGFR-TKls - afatinib and dacomitinib - covalently bind to and inhibit multiple receptors in the ErbB family (EGFR, HER2 and HER4). These agents have been mainly evaluated for first-line treatment but also in the setting of acquired resistance to first-generation EGFR-TKls. Afatinib is the first ErbB family blocker approved for patients with NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations; dacomitinib is in late stage clinical development. Mutant-selective EGFR inhibitors (AZD9291, CO-1686, HM61713) that specifically target the T790M resistance mutation are in early development. The EGFR-TKIs differ in their spectrum of target kinases, reversibility of binding to EGFR receptor, pharmacokinetics and potential for drug-drug interactions, as discussed in this review. For the clinician, these differences are relevant in the setting of polymedicated patients with NSCLC, as well as from the perspective of innovative anticancer drug combination strategies. ",

While the therapeutic targeting of single receptors has proven efficacious, optimal targeting of this receptor family should target all oncogenic members simultaneously. The juxtamembrane domains of ERBB1, ERBB2, and ERBB3 are highly conserved and control various aspects of ERBB-dependent biology. In an effort to block those functions, we have targeted this domain with decoy peptides synthesized in tandem with a cell-penetrating peptide, termed EJ1. Treatment with EJ1 induces cell death, promotes the formation of inactive ERBB multimers, and results in simultaneous reduction of ERBB1, ERBB2, and ERBB3 activation. Treatment also results in the activation of myosin light chain-dependent cell blebbing while inactivating CaMKII signaling, coincident with the induction of cell death. EJ1 also directly translocates to mitochondria, correlating with a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and production of reactive oxygen species. Finally, treatment of a mouse model of breast cancer with EJ1 results in the inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis without associated toxicities in normal cells. Overall, these data demonstrate that a portion of the ERBB jxm domain, when used as an intracellular decoy, can inhibit tumor growth and metastasis, representing a novel anticancer therapeutic.",

We integrated the available structural information with phylogenetic, biochemical, biophysical, genetic, and computational data into a suggested model for the regulation and activation of these receptors. According to the model, regulation is maintained by a dynamic equilibrium between monomeric and dimeric states in various conformations. Along this dynamic equilibrium, variations in the points of interactions within the dimers alter the activation state and ligand-binding affinities. The active state was recently shown to be associated with an asymmetric dimer of the kinase domains. That finding enabled us to elucidate, in molecular terms, the directionality observed in the activation process of ErbB heterodimers; it can explain, for example, the preferential activation of ErbB2 by ErbB1 over activation of ErbB1 by ErbB2. Sequence alterations that reverse this directionality lead to aberrant signaling and cancer. Our model also offers molecular interpretations of the effects of various oncogenic alterations that interfere with the regulatory mechanism.",

BBR3610 more efficiently killed HCT116, DLD1, SW480, and HT29 cells than BBR3464, cisplatin, or oxaliplatin. The amount of platinum uptake per cell and its incorporation into DNA were identical for BBR3464 and BBR3610. BBR3610 lethality (IC(75)) was unaltered comparing HCT116 wild-type and p53-/- cells, was reduced in p21-/- cells, and was enhanced in K-RAS D13 null cells. Small molecule or molecular inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (ERBB1) or phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase (PI3K) enhanced BBR3610 toxicity in HCT116, DLD1, and SW480 cells. Small molecule or molecular inhibition of caspase 8 function abolished the toxicity of BBR3610 and of BBR3610 + ERBB1 inhibitor treatments, whereas inhibition of caspase 9 suppressed the ability of ERBB1 inhibitors to enhance BBR3610 lethality. Treatment with BBR3610 reduced AKT activity; the expression of dominant-negative AKT enhanced and expression of constitutively active AKT suppressed, respectively, the toxicity of BBR3610 and of BBR3610 + ERBB1 inhibitor treatments. Treatment with BBR3610 reduced expression of c-FLIP-s and MCL-1, levels that were maintained in cells expressing constitutively active AKT. Overexpression of c-FLIP-s or loss of BID function suppressed BBR3610 toxicity, whereas overexpression of XIAP or Bcl-xL suppressed the potentiation of cell killing by ERBB1 inhibitors. Collectively, our data argue that BBR3610 promotes cell killing via a caspase 8-dependent mechanism, which can be enhanced by ERBB1/PI3K inhibitors that promote additional BBR3610-dependent cell killing via activation of BAX and caspase 9.",

Unlike lung cancers with EGFR kinase domain (KD) mutations, GBMs respond poorly to the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib. Using RNAi, we show that GBM cells carrying EGFR EC mutations display EGFR addiction. In contrast to KD mutants found in lung cancer, glioma-specific EGFR EC mutants are poorly inhibited by EGFR inhibitors that target the active kinase conformation (e.g., erlotinib). Inhibitors that bind to the inactive EGFR conformation, however, potently inhibit EGFR EC mutants and induce cell death in EGFR-mutant GBM cells. Our results provide first evidence for single kinase addiction in GBM and suggest that the disappointing clinical activity of first-generation EGFR inhibitors in GBM versus lung cancer may be attributed to the different conformational requirements of mutant EGFR in these 2 cancer types.;Approximately 40% of human glioblastomas harbor oncogenic EGFR alterations, but attempts to therapeutically target EGFR with first-generation EGFR kinase inhibitors have failed.

        "Doc_abstract":"Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) ranks second in the frequency of all skin tumors. Its incidence has risen significantly due to an increased sun exposure and the number of immunocompromised patients. It has a well-defined progression with known precursor lesions called actinic keratosis. The degree of cellular differentiation, tumor thickness, location, and other features has prognostic value. It has a better prognosis than mucosal SCC of the head and neck, also called head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Ultraviolet light plays a fundamental role as an initiator and promoter of carcinogenesis of SCC, allowing the accumulation of genetic alterations that allows a selective growth advantage. The TP53 (p53) gene often mutates and Ras is frequently activated, but with low frequency of mutations. Normally, the extracellular signals determine whether the cells move from a quiescent state into an active proliferative state. In tumor cells an increase in the production of growth factors and its receptors can be often seen that gives rise to such an autocrine circuit facilitating cellular division. Recently, frequent mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been detected in lung cancer, mainly deletions in exon 19 and L858R mutation in exon 21. These are located at the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain (TK). EGFR TK mutations produce activation of the signaling pathways downstream and preferentially activated antiapoptotic pathways (PI3K/AKT, JAK-STAT and ERK/MAPK). These mutations are correlated with the clinical response of patients to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefinitib and erlotinib), because the tumor cells are addicted to the constant activation of specific signaling pathways. Glioblastoma shows another EGFR mutation (EGFRvIII), corresponding to a deletion of the extracellular domain, and it is present in 24-67% of these tumors. This variant has been found in 42% of HNSCC, related to the poor response to monoclonal antibody cetuximab. Many observations show that there are abnormalities in the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and/or its ligands in HNSCC with frequent activation of multiple pathways downstream EGFR, and unrelated to RAS mutation. This suggests the possibility of activation by mutation or overexpression of a component of the pathway located upstream-Ras. While in other tumors, especially lung cancer and glioblastoma, the EGFR mutations are frequent genetic events, it is unknown whether EGFR is mutated or amplified in SCC of the skin and what would be its pathogenic role in this malignancy and its precursors.",

Given that the gastrointestinal tract is a major route of Pb(2+) exposure, we investigated the ability of Pb(2+) to induce IL-8 expression in gastric carcinoma cells and its underlying mechanism. At a concentration of 0.1 μM, Pb(2+) induced IL-8 gene activation in gastric carcinoma AGS cells. Using a IL-8 promoter-deletion analysis, transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP-1) was identified as a necessary component of Pb(2+) -induced IL-8 gene activation. Upregulation of the IL-8 gene was abrogated by the MEK inhibitor, PD98059, and partially suppressed by the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, AG1478 and PD153035. Furthermore, c-Jun protein expression was induced in cells treated with Pb(2+) , and overexpression of c-Jun enhanced Pb(2+) -induced IL-8 activation.

This study aimed to examine the effects of nimotuzumab on acquired radioresistance in human esophageal carcinoma cells and to investigate its underlying mechanisms.;The radioresistant human esophageal carcinoma cell line KYSE-150R was generated by using fractionated irradiation. KYSE-150R cells were pretreated with or without nimotuzumab before ionizing radiation. Cell growth and colony formation were measured to quantitate the effects of radiation. The γ-H2AX foci assay was employed to determine cellular DNA-repairing capacity. The phosphorylation of key molecules involved in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway and cellular DNA repair was measured by Western blot analysis.;Nimotuzumab enhanced radiation-induced inhibition on cell growth and clonogenic survival in KYSE-150R cells. The average number of γ-H2AX foci increased in the irradiated cells treated with nimotuzumab. Nimotuzumab inhibited phosphorylation of the EGFR and its downstream molecules AKT and ERK. Phosphorylation of the DNA repair-related proteins DNA-PKcs, ATM, and RAD51 was also inhibited by nimotuzumab.;These results indicate that nimotuzumab can inhibit key cancer survival mechanisms, the EGFR signaling pathway, and DNA repair and thereby reverse acquired radioresistance in KYSE-150R cell line.",

Conventional chemotherapy and radiation have shown limited efficacy for advanced gastric cancer, showing an overall survival (OS) rate of ~10 months. Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), is the first approved molecularly targeted agent for HER2-overexpressing gastric cancer, which was found to prolong the OS and the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients. However, HER2 overexpression is present only in a minority of patients with gastric cancer. Hence, other targeted agents are urgently needed. Ramucirumab, a novel human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that selectively targets the extracellular domain of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), is regarded as a new standard second-line treatment for patients with advanced gastric cancer. The combination of two or more targeted agents directed against two different molecular targets may improve the survival of patients with advanced gastric cancer. Although great efforts have been made, the effect of targeted therapy for gastric cancer is limited. One key reason is that participants in clinical trials for new targeted agents were not selected by detection of the targeted molecule. Here, we review clinical trials related to molecular targets such as anti-epidermal growth factor receptor signaling including anti-HER2 and anti-EGFR1, anti-VEGF signaling, anti-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and anti-MET.",

Thus, this protein may improve penetration of conjugated drugs into the deep zone of gastric cancer multicellular 3D spheroids.

The results of the present study showed that anti‑EGFR‑iRGD‑DTPA‑Gd exhibited no significant cyto-toxicity to human gastric carcinoma cells (BGC‑823) under the experimental conditions used. Compared with a conventional contrast agent (Magnevist), anti‑EGFR‑iRGD‑DTPA‑Gd showed higher T1 relaxivity (10.157/mM/sec at 3T) and better tumor‑targeting ability. In addition, the signal intensity and the area under curve for the enhanced signal time in tumor, in vivo, were stronger than Gd‑DTPA alone or the anti‑EGFR‑Gd control.

        "Doc_abstract":"The EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) plays a key role in the regulation of essential normal cellular processes and in the pathophysiology of hyperproliferative diseases such as cancer. Recent investigations have demonstrated that GPCRs (G-protein-coupled receptors) are able to utilize the EGFR as a downstream signalling partner in the generation of mitogenic signals. This cross-talk mechanism combines the broad diversity of GPCRs with the signalling capacities of the EGFR and has emerged as a general concept in a multitude of cell types. The molecular mechanisms of EGFR signal transactivation involve processing of transmembrane growth factor precursors by metalloproteases which have been recently identified as members of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family of zinc-dependent proteases. Subsequently, the EGFR transmits signals to prominent downstream pathways, such as mitogen-activated protein kinases, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway and modulation of ion channels. Analysis of GPCR-induced EGFR activation in more than 60 human carcinoma cell lines derived from different tissues has demonstrated the broad relevance of this signalling mechanism in cancer. Moreover, EGFR signal transactivation was linked to diverse biological processes in human cancer cells, such as cell proliferation, migration and anti-apoptosis. Together with investigations revealing the importance of this GPCR-EGFR cross-talk mechanism in cardiac hypertrophy, Helicobacter pylori -induced pathophysiological processes and cystic fibrosis, these findings support an important role for GPCR ligand-dependent EGFR signal transactivation in diverse pathophysiological disorders.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays a crucial role in growth, differentiation and motility of normal as well as tumor cells. The transduction of extracellular signals to the cytoplasm via the receptor not only depends on ligand binding, but is also determined by the receptor density on the cell surface. Therefore, with regard to cancer diagnosis and therapeutic approaches targeting EGFR it is important to know how the expression level of EGFR is controlled. We found that transcription activity declines with increasing numbers of CA dinucleotides of a highly polymorphic CA repeat in the first intron of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene. In vivo data from cultured cell lines support these findings, although other regulation mechanisms can compensate this effect. In addition, we showed that RNA elongation terminates at a site closely downstream of the simple sequence repeat (SSR) and that there are two separate major transcription start sites. Model calculations for the helical DNA conformation revealed a high bendability in the EGFR polymorphic region, especially if the CA stretch is extended. These data suggest that the CA-SSR can act like a joint, bringing the promoter in proximity to a putative repressor protein bound downstream of the CA-SSR. The data indicate that this polymorphism may be a marker for cancer, linking genetic and epigenetic risk factors. Furthermore, in breast cancer, heterozygous tumors with short CA-SSR showed an elevated EGFR-expression in contrast to tumours with longer CA-SSR. Tumours with loss of heterozygosity in intron 1 of egfr revealed an increased EGFR expression if the longer allele was lost. Moreover, decreased EGFR gene levels were significantly correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer.",

Treatment of locally advanced disease is associated with significant acute side effects and can lead to chronic disabilities, while the prognosis of recurrent or metastatic disease is very poor. This highlights the need for better therapeutic options. Epidermal growth factor receptor is overexpressed in 90% of HNSCC patients and is an attractive therapeutic target in this patient population. Afatinib is a potent, irreversible pan-ErbB inhibitor. Preliminary studies in HNSCC show promising activity.;This article reviews the current data evaluating small molecules inhibitors of the ErbB family in the treatment of HNSCC with a specific emphasis on afatinib, a second-generation, irreversible, pan-ErbB inhibitor. It also provides a description of afatinib's drug characteristics, pharmacokinetics and toxicity profile as well as details of the published and ongoing clinical trials evaluating its efficacy in HNSCC patients.;Phase II trials in HNSCC show that daily oral treatment with afatinib is tolerable. Most common toxicities are skin rash and diarrhea. Afatinib has clinical activity as a single agent in a subset of refractory and/or metastatic HNSCC patients. It is thought that ongoing Phase III trials should better clarify the role of this compound in the treatment of HNSCC.",

This signalling route is distinct from the better-characterized, traditional EGFR pathway that involves transduction of mitogenic signals through activation of multiple signalling cascades. Transcriptional activity of nuclear EGFR appears to depend on its C-terminal transactivation domain and its physical and functional interaction with other transcription factors that contain DNA-binding activity. Likely via its ability to upregulate gene expression, nuclear EGFR pathway is associated with major characteristics of more aggressive tumours: increased proliferative potential, nitric oxide synthesis, and accelerated G1/S cell cycle progression. A role of nuclear EGFR in prognostic prediction is further suggested in patients with breast carcinomas and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas. It is noted that significant advances were made towards the knowledge of the nuclear EGFR pathway; however, many aspects of this new pathway remain unresolved and will be discussed in this review. As a number of other receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and cytokine receptors also undergo similar nuclear translocalization, a better understanding of the physiological and malignant nature of the nuclear EGFR pathway will likely shed light into the biology of cancer with nuclear RTKs.",

The tumor microenvironment spontaneously induces both increased expression of the Mena invasive (Mena(INV)) and decreased expression of Mena11a isoforms in invasive and migratory tumor cells. Tumor cells with this Mena expression pattern participate with macrophages in migration and intravasation in mouse mammary tumors in vivo. Consistent with these findings, anatomical sites containing tumor cells with high levels of Mena expression associated with perivascular macrophages were identified in human invasive ductal breast carcinomas and called TMEM. The number of TMEM sites positively correlated with the development of distant metastasis in humans. Here we demonstrate that mouse mammary tumors generated from EGFP-Mena(INV) expressing tumor cells are significantly less cohesive and have discontinuous cell-cell contacts compared to Mena11a xenografts. Using the mouse PyMT model we show that metastatic mammary tumors express 8.7 fold more total Mena and 7.5 fold more Mena(INV) mRNA than early non-metastatic ones. Furthermore, Mena(INV) expression in fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNA) samples of human invasive ductal carcinomas correlate with TMEM score while Mena11a does not. These results suggest that Mena(INV) is the isoform associated with breast cancer cell discohesion, invasion and intravasation in mice and in humans. They also imply that Mena(INV) expression and TMEM score measure related aspects of a common tumor cell dissemination mechanism and provide new insight into metastatic risk.",

Study quality was assessed, and studies with a quality score of 4 or lower were excluded. Cell biological markers were clustered on biological function, and the prognostic and predictive significance of these markers was described. In total, 42 studies concerning 82 cell biological markers were included in this systematic review. In addition to cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and serum squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-ag) levels, markers associated with poor prognosis were involved in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling (EGFR and C-erbB-2) and in angiogenesis and hypoxia (carbonic anhydrase 9 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α). Epidermal growth factor receptor and C-erbB-2 were also associated with poor response to (chemo)radiation. In conclusion, EGFR signaling is associated with poor prognosis and response to therapy in cervical cancer patients primarily treated with (chemo)radiation, whereas markers involved in angiogenesis and hypoxia, COX-2, and serum SCC-ag levels are associated with a poor prognosis. Therefore, targeting these pathways in combination with chemoradiation may improve survival in advanced-stage cervical cancer patients.",

Compared with other breast cancer subtypes, EGFR is frequently overexpressed in TNBC and a potential therapeutic target for this disease. There are two types of EGFR inhibitors, small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and monoclonal antibody (mAb), for the treatment of cancers, such as non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. For breast cancer, however, the clinical trials of EGFR inhibitors have failed due to low response rates. Because a small portion of patients do demonstrate response to EGFR inhibitors, it may be necessary to stratify patients to enhance the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors in TNBC and to develop the effective combination therapy for this patient population.

        "Doc_abstract":"Breast cancer 1 (BRCA1)-associated breast cancers are mostly basal-like high-grade ductal carcinomas that frequently overexpress epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Aberrant EGFR expression is correlated with disease progression, resistance to radiation and chemotherapy, and poor clinical prognosis. Although BRCA1 is involved in multiple cellular processes, its functional role in EGFR regulation remains enigmatic. Here, we report a previously unrecognized posttranscriptional mechanism by which BRCA1 regulates EGFR expression through the induction of miR-146a. We demonstrate that EGFR expression correlates negatively with BRCA1, whereas miR-146a levels increase with BRCA1. We show that BRCA1 binds to MIR146A promoter and activates transcription, which in turn attenuates EGFR expression. Knockdown of miR-146a in BRCA1-overexpressing cells negated this effect and suppressed its ability to inhibit proliferation and transformation. In archived triple-negative breast cancer samples, we show a strong positive correlation between BRCA1 and miR-146a expression. We also show that low expression of miR-146a strongly predicts positive lymph node status and is associated with distinctively poor overall survival of patients. Together, these observations provide an insight into a novel BRCA1miR-146aEGFR paradigm by which BRCA1 carries out an aspect of tumor suppressor function that is potentially amenable to therapeutic intervention.

Approximately 85% of lung cancer is categorized as non-small cell lung cancer, and traditionally, non-small cell lung cancer has been treated with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Targeted agents that inhibit the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway have been developed and integrated into the treatment regimens in non-small cell lung cancer. Currently, approved epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors include the tyrosine kinase inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib. Molecular determinants, such as epidermal growth factor receptor-activating mutations, have been associated with response to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors and may be used to guide treatment choices in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Thus, treatment choice for patients with non-small cell lung cancer depends on molecular features of tumors; however, improved techniques are required to increase the specificity and efficiency of molecular profiling so that these methods can be incorporated into routine clinical practice.

So far, the expression of EGFR and HER2 has only been determined in primary cervical cancers, and we have not found published data regarding the receptor status in corresponding metastatic lesions. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether any of these receptors are suitable as target for clinical diagnosis and therapy.;Expression of EGFR and HER2 was investigated immunohistochemically in both lymph node metastases and corresponding primary cervical cancers (n = 53). HER2 and EGFR expression was scored using HercepTest criteria (0, 1+, 2+ or 3+).;EGFR overexpression (2+ or 3+) was found in 64% (35/53) of the primary cervical tumors and 60% (32/53) of the corresponding lymph node metastases. There was a good concordance between the primary tumors and the paired metastases regarding EGFR expression. Only four patients who had 2+ or 3+ in the primary tumors changed to 0 or 1+ in lymph node metastases, and another two cases changed the other way around.

Therefore, in this study, we investigated the potential molecular mechanism that contributes to cell viability and the response of gefitinib, one of the EGFR-TKIs, in lung cancer models with wide-type EGFR (wtEGFR). Interestingly, we found that EGF-induced EGFR endocytosis is existed differently between gefitinib-sensitive and -insensitive lung cancer cell lines. Suppressing EGFR endocytos decreased cell viability and increased apoptotic cell death in gefitinib-insensitive lung cancer with wtEGFR in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we found that Rab25 was differentially expressed in between gefitinib-sensitive and -insensitive lung cancer cells. Rab25 knockdown caused the changed EGFR endocytosis and reverted the gefitinib response in gefitinib-sensitive lung cancer with wtEGFR in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our findings suggest a novel insight that EGFR endocytosis is a rational therapeutic target in lung cancer with wtEGFR, in which the combined efficacy with gefitinib is expected.

Chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) was done using chromogenic detection. The mean signal numbers for EGFR gene and chromosome 7 as well as the EGFR gene/chromosome 7 centromere probe (CEP7) ratio were recorded. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was done on the corresponding paraffin sections. The copy number of the EGFR gene in each tumor/cell line ranged from 1.2 to 5.6. The EGFR gene/CEP7 ratio showed a biological continuum ranging from 0.59 to 1.94 with a mean of 1.04. EGFR gene copy loss was found in 16.6% of cases whereas copy gain was demonstrated in 19.4%. There was no relationship between IHC protein expression of EGFR and EGFR gene copy number or EGFR gene/CEP7 ratio.In conclusion, most breast carcinomas had a balanced EGFR gene/CEP7 copy number with a mean ratio of 1.04.

Many mechanisms of resistance to EGFR inhibitors have been identified, one of these being attributed to alternatively localized EGFR from the cell membrane into the cell's nucleus. Inside the nucleus, EGFR functions as a co-transcription factor for several genes involved in cell proliferation and angiogenesis, and as a tyrosine kinase to activate and stabilize proliferating cell nuclear antigen and DNA dependent protein kinase. Nuclear localized EGFR is highly associated with disease progression, worse overall survival in numerous cancers, and enhanced resistance to radiation, chemotherapy, and the anti-EGFR therapies gefitinib and cetuximab.

In this paper, we constructed a superior selective sandwich-type electrochemical biosensor to detect in-frame deletions in exon 19 of EGFR in real samples of patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma. Based on the characteristics of different hybridization efficiency in different hybridization phase conditions, different region around EGFR exon 19 deletion hotspots was selected to design DNA probes to improve biosensor performance. The results confirm that alteration of deletion location in target deliberately according to different hybridization phase is able to improve selectivity of sandwich-type DNA biosensor. Satisfactory discrimination ability can be achieved when the deletions are located in the capture probe interaction region. In order to improve efficiency of ssDNA generation from dsDNA, we introduce Lambda exonuclease (λ-exo) to sandwich-type biosensor system. EGFR exon 19 statuses of clinical real samples from lung cancer patients can be discriminated successfully by the proposed method. Our research would make the electrochemical biosensor be an excellent candidate for EGFR detection for lung cancer patients. ",

We describe five patients with metastatic lung cancer whose tumors harbored EGFR fusions, four of whom were treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) with documented antitumor responses. In vitro, EGFR-RAD51 fusions are oncogenic and can be therapeutically targeted with available EGFR TKIs and therapeutic antibodies. These results support the dependence of EGFR-rearranged tumors on EGFR-mediated signaling and suggest several therapeutic strategies for patients whose tumors harbor this novel alteration.;We report for the first time the identification and therapeutic targeting of EGFR C-terminal fusions in patients with lung cancer and document responses to the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib in 4 patients whose tumors harbored EGFR fusions. Findings from these studies will be immediately translatable to the clinic, as there are already several approved EGFR inhibitors.

During signal transduction across plasma membrane, ErbB receptors are involved in lateral homodimerization and heterodimerization with proper assembly of their extracellular single-span transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic domains. The ErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimer appears to be the strongest and most potent inducer of cellular transformation and mitogenic signaling compared to other ErbB homodimers and heterodimers. Spatial structure of the heterodimeric complex formed by TM domains of ErbB1 and ErbB2 receptors embedded into lipid bicelles was obtained by solution NMR. The ErbB1 and ErbB2 TM domains associate in a right-handed alpha-helical bundle through their N-terminal double GG4-like motif T(648)G(649)X(2)G(652)A(653) and glycine zipper motif T(652)X(3)S(656)X(3)G(660), respectively. The described heterodimer conformation is believed to support the juxtamembrane and kinase domain configuration corresponding to the receptor active state.

The present study aimed to determine the contribution of membrane-bound precursors of TGF-alpha in enhancing EGFR activation in the gastric and colonic mucosa during aging. The extent of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, a measure of EGFR activation, was substantially higher (300--350%) in the gastric and colonic mucosa of 23- (aged) vs. 4-mo-old (young) Fischer 344 rats. This was accompanied by an increase (200--1,000%) in the relative concentration of 18- to 20-kDa membrane-bound precursor forms of TGF-alpha. The amount of TGF-alpha bound to EGFR was also higher (150-250%) in the gastric and colonic mucosa of aged vs. young rats. In vitro studies revealed that exposure of HCT 116 cells (a colon cancer cell line) to TGF-alpha from gastric and colonic mucosal membranes of aged rats caused a 200--250% higher activation of EGFR and extracellular signal-related kinases (p42/44) compared with young rats.

Forced expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β in epidermal growth factor receptor sensitive UMUC5 cells (50% inhibitory concentration less than 10 nM) significantly decreased responsiveness to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition (50% inhibitory concentration greater than 100 nM) and increased invasive potential 3-fold as well as tumorigenicity. Increased invasiveness was associated with epidermal growth factor triggered platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β transactivation, increased mitogen activated protein kinase and glycogen synthase kinase-3β phosphorylation, and decreased E-cadherin. Inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β receptors blocked cell invasion, decreased cell proliferation, reduced xenograft tumor growth and increased E-cadherin expression.;In epidermal growth factor receptor expressing bladder cancer co-expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β has implications for tumor biology.

The groups were compared in terms of estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, cytokeratin 5/6 immunostaining, human epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (EGFR) membrane staining and molecular subtype, as indicated by their immunohistochemistry profiles.;ER/PR-negative status was predictive of invasion, whereas HER2 superexpression and cytokeratin 5/6-positive status were negatively associated with invasion. Among the high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ cases, a triple-positive profile (positive for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2) and cytokeratin 5/6 expression by neoplastic cells were negatively associated with invasion. In the low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ subgroup, only cytokeratin 5/6 expression exhibited a negative association with the probability of invasion.;The immunohistochemical expression of cytokeratin 5/6 by ductal carcinoma in situ epithelial cells may provide clinically useful information regarding the risk of progression to invasive disease.",

        "Doc_abstract":"We have previously shown that the epidermal growth factor-receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor PD153035 induces retinoic acid receptor-beta (RAR-beta) expression in malignant cells by mechanisms that are independent of its blocking activity on EGFR (ErbB1) or on any other ErbB receptor (ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4). RAR-beta2, one of three human RAR-beta isoforms (RAR-beta1, RAR-beta2, RAR-beta4), is silenced in many tumors and acts as a tumor suppressor. Forced expression of RAR-beta2 reverts the malignant phenotype of RAR-beta2-negative breast cancer cells and reconstitutes retinoid sensitivity in these cells. Here, we demonstrate that the EGFR inhibitor PD153035 specifically induces RAR-beta2, but not the other two isoforms (RAR-beta1, RAR-beta4) in MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-453 human breast cancer cells. Induction was seen at the mRNA (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) and protein level (Western analysis). PD153035-mediated induction of RAR-beta2 was associated with synergistic growth inhibition in cells co-treated with PD153035 and all-trans retinoic acid (tRA). Most importantly, PD153035 restored retinoic acid sensitivity in retinoic acid-resistant cells. Our previous work also revealed that PD153035 directly intercalates into the DNA suggesting that changes in the chromatin structure contribute to the RAR-beta2-inducing effect of PD153035. This prompted us to examine the effect of DNA intercalating chemotherapeutic drugs such as doxorubicin, amsacrine, and mitoxantrone on the expression of RAR-beta. Vincristine was used for comparative reasons, because this drug does not target DNA. All four compounds caused dose-dependent growth inhibition in MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-453 cells. Interestingly, compounds that directly interact with the DNA (doxorubicin, amsacrine, mitoxantrone) caused a time-dependent up-regulation of the RAR-beta expression in all cell lines examined, whereas the negative control drug vincristine, which causes disruption of microtubule structures, did not stimulate RAR-beta expression. These data further support the notion that induction of the RAR-beta tumor-suppressor gene in cancer cells by PD153035 is mediated at least in part by its DNA intercalating activity.",

In the present study, HCRP-1 expression was examined in a RCC tissue microarray. The negative expression of HCRP-1 was significantly correlated with tumor grade (P = 0.002), TNM stage (P = 0.001) and pT status (P = 0.003). Furthermore, we showed a strong correlation between negative HCRP-1 expression and worse overall and disease-specific survival (P = 0.0003 and P = 0.0012, respectively). Knockdown of HCRP-1 promoted cell migration and invasion in 786-O and OS-RC-2 cell lines. HCRP-1 depletion increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 protein level, with increased extracellular signal-regulatedkinase (ERK) phosphorylation, which could be reversed by ERK siRNA or ERK inhibitor, PD98059. Further analysis showed that HCRP-1 knockdown induced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation. Treatment with EGFR inhibitor or EGFR siRNA blocked HCRP-1-mediated up-regulation of EGFR, ERK phosphorylation and MMP-2 expression. In summary, our results showed that negative HCRP-1 expression is an independent prognostic factor for RCC patients and promotes migration and invasion by EGFR-ERK-mediated up-regulation of MMP-2. HCRP-1 may serve as a therapeutic target for RCC. ",

Clinical outcome can be substantially improved by ERBB2-targeted therapy. Lapatinib is a potent, orally bioavailable small molecule that reversibly and selectively inhibits epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR1 or ERBB1) and ERBB2 tyrosine kinases. Lapatinib binds the adenosine triphosphate-binding site of the receptor's intracellular domain to inhibit tumor cell growth. This review summarizes the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and tolerability of lapatinib, and reviews both Food and Drug Administration-approved and investigational uses of lapatinib in breast cancer therapy. The drug is generally well tolerated in patients, with diarrhea and rashes being the most common (usually mild or moderate) adverse effects. Unlike trastuzumab, lapatinib has infrequent adverse effects on cardiac function. Lapatinib has substantial activity for advanced ERBB2-positive breast cancer, particularly in combination with capecitabine, following progression after anthracyclines, taxanes, and trastuzumab. Lapatinib combined with capecitabine yielded significant improvements in time to progression and response rate compared with capecitabine alone. This drug can also be combined with letrozole for the treatment of postmenopausal women with ERBB2-positive breast cancer, for whom hormonal therapy is indicated. Lapatinib has shown early promise in treatment of central nervous system metastasis and is being further evaluated in various clinical settings. ",

Although several crystal structures of ErbB kinases have been solved, the precise mechanism of HER2 activation remains unknown, and it has been suggested that HER2 is unique in its requirement for phosphorylation of Y877, a key tyrosine residue located in the activation loop. To elucidate mechanistic details of kinase domain regulation, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of a homology-modeled HER2 kinase structure in active and inactive conformations. Principal component analysis of the atomistic fluctuations reveals a tight coupling between the activation loop and catalytic loop that may contribute to alignment of residues required for catalysis in the active kinase. The free energy perturbation method is also employed to predict a role for phosphorylated Y877 in stabilizing the kinase conformations. Finally, simulation results are presented for a HER2/EGFR heterodimer and reveal that the dimeric interface induces a rearrangement of the alphaC helix toward the active conformation. Elucidation of the molecular regulatory mechanisms in HER2 will help establish structure-function relationships in the wild-type kinase, as well as predict mutations with a propensity for constitutive activation in HER2-mediated cancers.",

EGFR immunoreactivity was present in 15 of 35 LMP and invasive carcinomas and 1 of 10 cystadenomas. On the contrary, immunoreactivity of p185, which is an oncogene product of c-erbB-2, was detected only in five cases of carcinoma and in no benign cystadenoma. These results indicate that EGFR may be involved in the neoplastic process in epithelial ovarian adenocarcinoma, especially mucinous carcinoma, but involvement of c-erbB-2 is probably not as prevalent as considered previously.

This article examines the relationship between EGFR expression and cancer prognosis based on literature compiled on PubMed between 1985 and September 2000. More than 200 studies were identified that analysed relapse-free-interval or survival data directly in relation to EGFR levels in over 20000 patients. Analysis of the data showed that 10 cancer types both express elevated levels of EGFR relative to normal tissues and have been studied in sufficient depth to allow sound judgements to be made concerning the association between EGFR and patient outlook. The EGFR was found to act as a strong prognostic indicator in head and neck, ovarian, cervical, bladder and oesophageal cancers. In these cancers, increased EGFR expression was associated with reduced recurrence-free or overall survival rates in 70% (52/74) of studies. In gastric, breast, endometrial and colorectal cancers, the EGFR provided more modest prognostic information, correlating to poor survival rates in 52% (13/25) of studies, while in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), EGFR expression only rarely (3/10 studies) related to patient outlook. However, it is likely that the true prognostic significance of the EGFR has been underestimated as the published studies only assessed total cellular EGFR levels, rather than the activated form of the receptor, and were not standardised with regard to patient populations or assay methods. Finally, it is important to stress that failure to detect a prognostic significance for EGFR in any one cancer type does not necessarily preclude patients from benefiting from anti-EGFR therapies.",

The primary tumors from 55 patients who developed BM were used to construct a tissue microarray. The clinical and pathologic features were recorded and the tissue microarray was stained for estrogen receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, cytokeratin 5/6, and epidermal growth factor receptor by immunohistochemistry. This cohort of patients was compared against a group of 254 patients who remain free of metastases (67 mo mean follow-up), and another cohort of 40 patients who developed mixed visceral and bone metastatic disease without brain recurrence over a similar period of time. Breast cancer patients who went on to develop BM were more likely to be <50 years old (P<0.001), and the primary tumors were more likely to be estrogen receptor negative (P<0.001) and high grade (P=0.002).

Modulation of receptor signaling was determined in cell assays by Western blot analyses of receptor autophosphorylation and downstream signaling. The ability of BMS-599626 to inhibit receptor heterodimer signaling in tumor cells was studied by receptor coimmunoprecipitation.

A clinically relevant secondary mutation (T790M) abolished TKI sensitivity.

In this study, we found that integrin α6β4 up-regulates several genes in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway, including amphiregulin (AREG), epiregulin (EREG), and ectodomain cleavage protease MMP1, which is mediated by promoter demethylation and NFAT5. The correlation of these genes with integrin α6β4 was confirmed in The Cancer Genome Atlas Pancreatic Cancer Database. Based on previous observations that integrin α6β4 cooperates with c-Met in pancreatic cancers, we examined the impact of EGFR signaling on hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-stimulated migration and invasion. We found that AREG and EREG were required for autocrine EGFR signaling, as knocking down either ligand inhibited HGF-mediated migration and invasion. We further determined that HGF induced secretion of AREG, which is dependent on integrin-growth factor signaling pathways, including MAPK, PI3K, and PKC. Moreover, matrix metalloproteinase activity and integrin α6β4 signaling were required for AREG secretion. Blocking EGFR signaling with EGFR-specific antibodies or an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor hindered HGF-stimulated pancreatic carcinoma cell chemotaxis and invasive growth in three-dimensional culture. Finally, we found that EGFR was phosphorylated in response to HGF stimulation that is dependent on EGFR kinase activity; however, c-Met phosphorylation in response to HGF was unaffected by EGFR signaling. Taken together, these data illustrate that integrin α6β4 stimulates invasion by promoting autocrine EGFR signaling through transcriptional up-regulation of key EGFR family members and by facilitating HGF-stimulated EGFR ligand secretion. These signaling events, in turn, promote pancreatic carcinoma migration and invasion.",

There were not EGFR expression differences between cervical squamous carcinoma (45.8%) and adenocarcinoma (42.9%). These findings suggest that the elevated expression of EGFR may be linked, at least initially, to the malignant state of the cervical squamous epithelia.

Knockdown of GLRX3 in NPC cell lines inhibited proliferation in vitro, tumorignesis in vivo, and colony formation. In addition, GLRX3 knockdown decreased the migration and invasion capacity of NPC cells by reversing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Furthermore, stabilization of GLRX3 was positively related to with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression and negatively with ROS generation. Phosphorylation of Akt, a key downstream effector, was induced by EGFR signaling but did not rely on increasing ROS level in NPC cells.

The major inhibitor of plasmin generation, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), is among the most highly induced transcripts during the phenotypic transition initiated by TGF-beta maximal expression requires EGFR signaling. PAI-1 induction occurs early in the progression of incipient epidermal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and is a significant indicator of poor prognosis in epithelial malignancies. Mouse modeling and molecular genetic analysis of complex systems indicates that PAI-1 regulates the temporal/spatial control of pericellular proteolysis, promotes epithelial plasticity, inhibits capillary regression and facilitates stromal invasion.

The results demonstrated that EGFR phosphorylation was markedly inhibited in gastric cancer cell lines (SGC7901 and MGC803) which possessed functional K‑ras and BRAF following treatment with cetuximab.

Knockdown of IGF‑IR or the use of an IGF‑IR inhibitor were found to increase the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to cetuximab. Furthermore, cetuximab induced phosphorylation of the non‑receptor tyrosine kinase c‑steroid receptor co‑activator (Src). Treatment of gastric cancer cells with a Src inhibitor was shown to significantly reduce cetuximab‑induced phosphorylation of IGF‑IR as well as Src, which resulted in enhanced sensitivity to cetuximab treatment.

Cell line and animal studies have shown that MAPK and STAT-3 are important mediators of the EGFR signal in liver cells. However, little is known about EGFR phosphorylation and subsequent signaling in primary hepatocellular carcinoma. We investigated the site of EGFR phosphorylation by Western blot in 18 hepatocellular carcinomas. Fourteen of 18 hepatocellular carcinomas had detectable EGFR by Western blotting and 13 of 14 showed phosphorylation at tyrosine 845. In contrast, no EGFR phosphorylation was detected at tyrosine 998, tyrosine 1045, or tyrosine 1068, which signal through other pathways including STAT-3 and MAPK. These findings were further explored by examination of EGFR expression and signaling pathway activation in tissue arrays comprised of 73 hepatocellular carcinomas using antibodies that recognize phosphorylated (or activated) proteins. Tissue array studies also found no correlation between EGFR expression (29% of cases) and STAT-3 nuclear positivity (16%), AKT (4%), MAPK (3%), or STAT-5 (3%) positivity, all P>0.05. EGFR expression was correlated with hepatitis B infection, but not with tumor size, nuclear grade, or proliferative rate. We conclude that EGFR is phosphorylated at tyrosine 845 in most hepatocellular carcinomas and that EGFR expression by immunohistochemistry does not correlate well with STAT-3, STAT-5, MAPK, or AKT immunostaining.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The mechanism behind the growth-promoting effect of insulin is a subject of debate. Employing RT4 bladder cancer cells, we examined the cross-talk between insulin and the epidermal growth factor system. We found that insulin induced a time- and dose-dependent (25-1000 nmol.L(-1) insulin) increase in mRNA expression of three ligands from the epidermal growth factor system. Times for peak increase and fold increase after incubation with 250 nmol.L(-1) insulin were as follows: heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor, 0.5 h, 1.4-fold, P < 0.05; epiregulin, 3 h, 14-fold, P < 0.0001; and amphiregulin, 3 h, 12-fold, P < 0.001. Induction of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor and amphiregulin was verified at the protein level. We demonstrate that incubation of RT4 bladder cancer cells for 24 h with 250 nmol.L(-1) insulin increases proliferation by 43% (P < 0.0001) as compared to untreated cells. At the same time, phosphorylation and thereby activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (HER1) was observed. Both phosphorylation and insulin-induced proliferation were almost completely inhibited by the HER1 inhibitor Iressa (P < 0.0001). This shows that insulin leads to activation of HER1, and that HER1 plays an essential role in mediating the growth-promoting effect of insulin. Iressa inhibited not only the activation of HER1 caused by insulin but also the insulin-induced increase in the three ligands (heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor, epiregulin and amphiregulin). As heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor was induced before epiregulin and amphiregulin upon insulin stimulation, we speculated that the insulin-induced heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor initiated the activation of HER1, and that this in turn led to increased expression of epiregulin and amphiregulin and thereby to continued activation of HER1. Earlier reports have shown that insulin-like growth factor receptor can activate HER1 via its ligand heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor. In accord with this, we found that treatment of RT4 cells with recombinant heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor mimicked the effect of insulin, with induction of mRNA for the three ligands. However, the insulin-induced increase in mRNA expression of amphiregulin and epiregulin could not be prevented by the heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor inhibitor CRM197, demonstrating that heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor is not essential for the insulin-induced increase in the expression of these ligands. In conclusion, we show that insulin-induced growth in RT4 cells requires activated HER1. Furthermore, activation of HER1 is required for the insulin-induced increase in expression of the HER1 ligands heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor, amphiregulin and epiregulin.",

In this regard, the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab has been approved alone or in combination with: (a) chemotherapy for treatment of colorectal and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and (b) with external radiotherapy for treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The conjugation of radionuclides to cetuximab in combination with the specific targeting properties of this antibody might increase its therapeutic efficiency. This review article gives an overview of the preclinical studies that have been performed with radiolabeled cetuximab for imaging and/or treatment of different tumor models. A particularly promising approach seems to be the treatment with therapeutic radionuclide-labeled cetuximab in combination with external radiotherapy. Present data support an important impact of the tumor micromilieu on treatment response that needs to be further validated in patients. Another important challenge is the reduction of nonspecific uptake of the radioactive substance in metabolic organs like liver and radiosensitive organs like bone marrow and kidneys. Overall, the integration of diagnosis, treatment and monitoring as a theranostic approach appears to be a promising strategy for improvement of individualized cancer treatment. ",

However, molecular screening methods have started to extend beyond identification of classic EGFR mutations to prevent exclusion of patients with rare or complex mutations who may benefit from anti-EGFR therapy. Rare EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung cancers are heterogeneous: exon 20 insertions lack sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors while exon 18 or complex mutations are more sensitive and require individual assessment.

Patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer with this mutation show dramatic clinical responses to treatment with EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, whose effectiveness has been established recently in large clinical trials. Most of the mechanisms responsible for resistance to treatment, which most responders experience eventually, have been elucidated, and methods to overcome resistance have been developed. In addition to the clinical benefit, understanding EGFR mutations sheds new light on the molecular and pathological aspects of this adenocarcinoma subset, which include frequent development in nonsmokers or females, and particular clusters within the molecular classification in lung cancer. In contrast to the involvement of EGFR mutations in the early stage of lung adenocarcinoma development, EGFR amplification is superimposed on the progression to invasive cancer. In this review, I summarize the clinicopathological characteristics of EGFR mutations in lung cancer. I also provide an overview of the current understanding of the lung adenocarcinoma subset harboring EGFR mutations with special reference to the molecular classification of lung cancer and the novel concept of the \"terminal respiratory unit.\"",

We screened the EGFR in 469 resected tumours of patients with lung cancer, which included 322 adenocarcinomas, 102 squamous cell carcinomas, 27 large cell carcinomas, 13 small cell carcinomas, and five other cell types. PCR with a specific condition was performed to identify any deletion in exon 19, while mutant-allele-specific amplification was performed to identify a mutation in codon 858 of exon 21. EGFR mutations were found in 136 cases (42.2%) with adenocarcinoma, in one case with large cell carcinoma, and in one case with pleomorphic carcinoma. An in-frame deletion in exon 19 was found in 62 cases while an L858R mutation was found in 77 cases. In the 322 cases with adenocarcinoma, these mutations were more frequently found in women than in men (P=0.0004), in well differentiated tumours than in poorly differentiated tumours (P=0.0014), and in patients who were never smokers than in patients who were current/former smokers (P<0.0001). The mutation was more frequently observed in patients who smoked <or=20 pack-year, and in patients who quit at least 20 years before the date of diagnosis for lung cancer. The K-ras mutations were more frequently found in smokers than in never smokers, and in high-dose smokers than in low-dose smokers.

With the recent advances in the knowledge of cellular processes and signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis of breast cancer, the current focus of researchers and clinicians is to develop novel treatment strategies that can be included in the armamentarium against breast cancer. With the failure of endocrine-targeted therapy and the development of resistance to existing chemotherapy, the most explored pathway as next generation target for breast cancer therapy has been the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (ErbB-1)/herceptin-2 (HER-2) (ErbB-2) pathway. This review focuses on the rationale for targeting members of ErbB receptor family and numerous agents that are in use for inhibiting the pathway. The mechanism of action, preclinical and clinical trial data of the agents that are in use for targeting the EGFR/HER-2 pathway and the current status, thereof, have been discussed in detail.

        "Doc_abstract":"The overexpression and aberrant function of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its ligands in several human carcinomas have provided a rationale for targeting this signaling network with novel treatment approaches. The epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase (EGFR-TK) is a selective target for inhibiting cancer because it is activated in many tumor cells, yet is strictly controlled in normal cells. The EGFR-TK initiates diverse signal transduction pathways in tumor cells that have a profound effect on their biology. Activation of the EGFR-TK provides signals that drive dysregulated proliferation, invasion and metastasis, angiogenesis, and enhanced cell survival. Therefore, the EGFR-TK is a promising drug target for many types of solid tumors, and its inhibition has potential in both the treatment and prevention of these neoplasias. Based on the structure and function of the EGFR, two antireceptor therapeutic strategies have been developed. The first strategy uses humanized monoclonal antibodies generated against the receptor's ligand-binding, extracellular domain. These antibodies block binding of receptor-activating ligands and, in some cases, can induce receptor endocytosis and downregulation. The second approach uses small molecules that compete with adenosine triphosphate for binding to the receptor's kinase pocket, thus blocking receptor activation and the transduction of postreceptor signals. Early clinical studies suggest that both of these approaches, either alone or in combination with standard anticancer therapies, are well tolerated and can induce clinical responses and tumor stabilization in a variety of common carcinomas. ZD1839 (Iressa; AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, Wilmington, DE) is the EGFR-TK inhibitor furthest along in clinical development, and it is currently being investigated in a variety of solid tumors, including non-small-cell lung cancer.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a member of the EGFR family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). EGFR activation via ligand binding results in signaling through various pathways ultimately resulting in cellular proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. Aberrant expression or activity of EGFR has been strongly linked to the etiology of several human epithelial cancers including but not limited to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and brain cancer. Thus intense efforts have been made to inhibit the activity of EGFR by designing antibodies against the ligand binding domains (cetuximab and panitumumab) or small molecules against the tyrosine kinase domain (erlotinib, gefitinib, and lapatinib). Although targeting membrane-bound EGFR has shown benefit, a new and emerging role for EGFR is now being elucidated. In this review we will summarize the current knowledge of the nuclear EGFR signaling network, including how it is trafficked to the nucleus, the functions it serves in the nucleus, and how these functions impact cancer progression, survival, and response to chemotherapeutics.",

Specific antibodies and low-molecular-weight tyrosine kinase inhibitors of both proteins are currently in clinical trials for cancer treatment. Benzimidazole derivatives possess diverse biological activities, including antitumor activity. However, the anticancer mechanism of 5a (a 2-aryl benzimidazole compound; 2-chloro-N-(2-p-tolyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-5-yl)acetamide, C(16)H(14)ClN(3)O, MW299), a novel 2-aryl benzimidazole derivative, toward breast cancer is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that 5a potently inhibited both EGFR and HER2 activity by reducing EGFR and HER2 tyrosine phosphorylation and preventing downstream activation of PI3K/Akt and MEK/Erk pathways in vitro and in vivo. We also show that 5a inhibited the phosphorylation of FOXO and promoted FOXO translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, resulting in the G1-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, 5a potently induced apoptosis via the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated death receptor 5 upregulation in breast cancer cells. The antitumor activity of 5a was consistent with additional results demonstrating that 5a significantly reduced tumor volume in nude mice in vivo. Analysis of the primary breast cancer cell lines with HER2 overexpression further confirmed that 5a significantly inhibited Akt Ser473 and Bad Ser136 phosphorylation and reduced cyclin D3 expression. On the basis of our findings, further development of this 2-aryl benzimidazole derivative, a new class of multitarget anticancer agents, is warranted and represents a novel strategy for improving breast cancer treatment.",

The expression of EGF and EGFR was significantly strong in pulmonary metastatic nodules compared to those in primary breast carcinoma tissue.

EGFR expression was determined by FACS and quantitative PCR in GC cells. Experimental 5-fluorouracil (5FU) was used instead of S-1 for in vitro experiments. The efficacy of 5FU or cetuximab monotherapy or combination 5FU/cetuximab therapy was examined in vitro and in vivo. Clinical specimens were examined for EGFR by immunohistochemistry (IHC). EGFR expression score was defined as strong membrane and cytoplasmic staining in at least 50-75% of cells. The combination of 5FU and cetuximab synergistically inhibited cell proliferation and exhibited an enhanced proapoptotic effect in GC cells with EGFR overexpression. Cetuximab also induced down-regulation of phosphorylation of EGFR and AKT, leading to diminished signaling. The antitumor effect of the combination of S-1 and cetuximab in vivo was also greater than that of either drug alone.

To date the clinical utility of epidermal growth factor receptor immunohistochemistry in determining monoclonal antibody efficacy has remained somewhat inconclusive. The lack of an agreed reproducible scoring criteria for epidermal growth factor receptor immunohistochemistry has, in various clinical trials yielded conflicting results as to the use of epidermal growth factor receptor immunohistochemistry assay as a companion diagnostic. This has resulted in this test being removed from the licence for the drug panitumumab and not performed in clinical practice for cetuximab. In this review we explore the reasons behind this with a particular emphasis on colorectal cancer, and to suggest a way of resolving the situation through improving the precision of epidermal growth factor receptor immunohistochemistry with quantitative image analysis of digitised images complemented with companion molecular morphological techniques such as in situ hybridisation and section based gene mutation analysis.

The activation of EGFR by phosphorylation is balanced by receptor kinase and protein tyrosine phosphatase activities. However, the mechanisms of negative EGFR regulation by tyrosine phosphatases remain largely unexplored. Our previous results indicate that protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type O (PTPRO) is down-regulated in a subset of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with a poor prognosis. Here we identified PTPRO as a phosphatase that negatively regulates SRC by directly dephosphorylating Y416 phosphorylation site. SRC activation triggered by PTPRO down-regulation induces phosphorylation of both EGFR at Y845 and the c-CBL ubiquitin ligase at Y731. Increased EGFR phosphorylation at Y845 promotes its receptor activity, whereas enhanced phosphorylation of c-CBL triggers its degradation promoting EGFR stability. Importantly, hyperactivation of SRC/EGFR signaling triggered by loss of PTPRO leads to high resistance of colon cancer to EGFR inhibitors. Our results not only highlight the PTPRO contribution in negative regulation of SRC/EGFR signaling but also suggest that tumors with low PTPRO expression may be therapeutically targetable by anti-SRC therapies.

Therefore, this receptor tyrosine kinase is considered to be an attractive target for antibody-based therapy. Indeed, antibodies to the EGFR have already proven their value for the treatment of several solid tumours, especially in combination with chemotherapeutic treatment regimens. Variable domains of camelid heavy chain-only antibodies (called Nanobodies) have superior properties compared with classical antibodies in that they are small, very stable, easy to produce in large quantities and easy to re-format into multi-valent or multi-specific proteins. Furthermore, they can specifically be selected for a desired function by phage antibody display. In this report, we describe the successful selection and the characterisation of antagonistic anti-EGFR Nanobodies. By using a functional selection strategy, Nanobodies that specifically competed for EGF binding to the EGFR were isolated from \"immune\" phage Nanobody repertoires. The selected antibody fragments were found to efficiently inhibit EGF binding to the EGFR without acting as receptor agonists themselves. In addition, they blocked EGF-mediated signalling and EGF-induced cell proliferation. In an in vivo murine xenograft model, the Nanobodies were effective in delaying the outgrowth of A431-derived solid tumours. This is the first report describing the successful use of untagged Nanobodies for the in vivo treatment of solid tumours. The results show that functional phage antibody selection, coupled to the rational design of Nanobodies, permits the rapid development of novel anti-cancer antibody-based therapeutics.",

There are several different mechanisms by which STAT proteins can mediate intracellular EGFR signaling, including direct activation of STATs by EGFR binding and indirect activation of STATs through Src-mediated EGFR signaling. EGFR likely activates STAT in a manner distinctive from other mechanisms of STAT activation; STAT5 can be phosphorylated in an EGF-dependent manner at unique sites, conferring novel functions. Cumulative evidence suggests that targeting EGFR signaling pathways at several levels may demonstrate synergistic therapeutic effects compared with targeting the upstream receptor alone. Thus, methods to inhibit EGFR in conjunction with oncogenic STATs may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for cancers characterized by upregulation of EGFR signaling.",

The use of currently available therapies results in only a modest impact on overall survival of patients with advanced-stage disease. New approaches for the treatment of colorectal cancer are urgently needed. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently dysregulated in colorectal carcinoma, and overexpression of the receptor confers a poor prognosis. Targeting the EGFR has become a rational approach for the treatment of colorectal carcinoma. Several strategies to inhibit the EGFR and its downstream signaling pathways are currently being investigated in preclinical and clinical studies, including monoclonal antibodies directed against the extracellular domain of the receptor and small-molecule inhibitors of its tyrosine kinase activity. Some of these drugs have already been tested in colorectal cancer and have shown preliminary evidence of antitumor efficacy. Important issues to elucidate in the future include the definition of the biologic context in which these drugs are more likely to be effective and the integration of the different agents in current therapeutic strategies for colorectal cancer.

Here, we investigated whether designed ankyrin repeat proteins can reliably identify the amplification status of the epidermal growth factor receptor 2 in breast cancer. Designed ankyrin repeat proteins specific for epidermal growth factor receptor 2 were tested in paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Detection using enzymatic biotinylation proved to be most specific and sensitive. The affinity of the designed ankyrin repeat proteins was found crucial, but for a picomolar binder no further gain was found by making it multivalent. The best designed ankyrin repeat protein, G3 (K(D) 90 pM) was compared on breast cancer tissue microarrays (n=792) to an FDA-approved rabbit monoclonal antibody against epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (clone 4B5; Ventana Medical Systems) and correlated with corresponding epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification status measured by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Amplification status and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 expression measured by designed ankyrin repeat protein and antibody correlated strongly with each other (P<0.0001 each), the correlation between designed ankyrin repeat protein and amplification status being the strongest (0.87 compared to 0.77 for the antibody, Kendall's tau-beta). Using a modified scoring system for the designed ankyrin repeat protein, we show that the designed ankyrin repeat protein detects a positive epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification status with similar sensitivity and significantly higher specificity than the antibody (P=0.0005).

The peptide was produced in E. coli with a high yield of the correctly folded peptide. EGFt showed specificity and high affinity for EGFR but induced poor EGFR homodimerization and phosphorylation. Interestingly, EGFt promoted EGFR internalization and translocation to the cell nucleus although it did not stimulate the cell growth. In addition, EGFt competed with EGFR native ligands, inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells. These data indicate that EGFt may be a potential EGFR blocker for cancer therapy.

        "Doc_abstract":"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Several molecular pathways underlying mechanisms of this disease have been partly elucidated, among which the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway is one of the well-known signaling cascades that plays a critical role in tumorigenesis. Dysregulation of the EGFR signaling is frequently found in lung cancer. The strategies to effectively inhibit EGFR signaling pathway have been mounted for developing anticancer therapeutic agents. However, most anti-EGFR-targeted agents fail to repress cancer progression because of developing drug-resistance. Therefore, studies of the mechanisms underpinning the resistance toward anti-EGFR agents may provide important findings for lung cancer treatment using anti-EGFR therapies. Recently, increasing numbers of miRNAs are correlated with the drug resistance of lung cancer cells to anti-EGFR agents, indicating that miRNAs may serve as novel targets and/or promising predictive biomarkers for anti-EGFR therapy. In this paper, we summarize the emerging role of miRNAs as regulators to modulate the EGFR signaling and the resistance of lung cancer cells to anti-EGFR therapy. We also highlight the evidence supporting the use of miRNAs as biomarkers for response to anti-EGFR agents and as novel therapeutic targets to circumvent the resistance of lung cancer cells to EGFR inhibitors.

Although gefitinib therapy of the primary NSCLC resulted in disease control for over 3 years, the patient subsequently developed metastatic SCLC to the liver. Epidermal growth factor receptor mutation analysis revealed that the exon 21 L858R activating mutation was present in both the original lung adenocarcinoma and the metastatic SCLC. We hypothesize that SCLC either evolved from the previously diagnosed NSCLC or that both arose from a common precursor. Further comparative molecular analysis of these histologically distinct tumors would be of value to better understand the potential role of EGFR in the pathogenesis of SCLC in never-smokers, and the role of selection for an EGFR-mutant SCLC subclone as an unusual mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors in NSCLC.",

As gastric cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, systemic chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for these patients. However, no standard palliative chemotherapy regimen has been accepted for patients with metastatic gastric cancer. Palliative chemotherapy including fluoropyrimidine, platin compounds, docetaxel and epirubicin prolongs survival, and improves a high quality of life to a greater extent than best supportive care. The number of clinical investigations associated with targeted agents has recently increased. Agents targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor 1 and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) have been widely tested. Trastuzumab was the first target drug developed, and pivotal phase III trials showed improved survival when trastuzumab was integrated into cisplatin/fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy in patients with metastatic gastric cancer. Trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy was thus approved to be a new standard of care for patients with HER2-positive advanced esophagogastric adenocarcinoma. Thus, the evaluation of HER2 status in all patients with metastatic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma should be considered. Other agents targeting vascular endothelial growth factor, mammalian target of rapamycin, and other biological pathways have also been investigated in clinical trials, but showed little impact on the survival of patients. In this review, systemic chemotherapy and targeted therapies for metastatic gastric cancer in the first- and second-line setting are summarized in the light of recent advances. ",

To evoke a high titers of antibodies (Abs) targeting the dimer interface of EGFR in patients, a chimeric peptide, comprising a linear B-cell epitope peptide from the highly conservative β-hairpin loop of dimer interface of human EGFR (EGFR237-267) and a 'promiscuous' Th-cell epitope MVF from the measles virus fusion protein, was constructed. The construct was immunogenic and able to elicit high titers of peptide-specific Abs in both mice and rabbits, while both animals' EGFRs contain a sequence 100% homologous to EGFR237-267. The peptide-specific Abs could recognize and inhibit EGFR over-expressing epithelial cancer cells, such as epidermoid carcinoma A431 and Lewis lung cancer (LLC), furthermore, the binding of the Abs to the native EGFR on the surface of cells was ligand-dependent, which meant that these Abs did target the dimer interface of EGFR as designed, because the exposure of the interface needs ligand binding. The chimeric peptide immunization was able to significantly inhibit the growth of subcutaneously transplanted LLC cells in C57BL6 mice. Therefore, the MVF-EGFR237-267 construct represents a promising candidate for active anti-EGFR immunotherapy and provides a novel targeting strategy for the anti-EGFR therapy.",

Selected sections of the primary tumors were immunostained for p53, epidermal growth factor receptor, and HER-2/neu; deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy and S-phase fraction were determined with use of flow cytometry. Clinical information was abstracted from the medical records. Survival times were analyzed according to the life-table methods of Kaplan and Meier, and the statistical significance of the various factors was tested with the log-rank test. The proportional hazards model of Cox was used to identify prognostic factors.;Positive immunostaining was observed for p53 in 13 cases (45%), for epidermal growth factor receptor in 14 cases (50%), and for HER-2/neu in 19 cases (65%). Tumors were diploid in 16 cases (55%) and aneuploid in 13 (45%). The S-phase fraction was < or = 15% (mean) in 13 cases (45%) and > 15% in 16 cases (55%). The median survival for the entire group was 52 months. None of the above variables had a significant effect on survival time.;Neither immunostaining for p53, epidermal growth factor receptor, and HER-2/neu nor deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy nor S-phase fraction allowed us to distinguish transitional cell carcinoma from other more common epithelial ovarian cancers. In addition, no prognostic significance was associated with these biomarkers. A study of larger numbers of cases may be more elucidative.",

G(0)-G(1) arrest was measured by FACS. Western blot analysis was used to detect the key enzymes in both the Ras/Raf and PI3K pathways. When establishing the IC(50) of HCC to several drugs, including EKB-569, sorafenib, erlotinib, gefitinib, pazopanib, and brivanib, SK-Hep1 cells treated with EKB-569 have shown the highest (72.8%-86.4%) G(0)-G(1) arrest and decreased the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK at the protein level. We found that EKB-569 had higher efficacy in HCC, compared to first generation, reversible EGFR-TK inhibitors. Furthermore, the combination of sorafenib and EKB-569 showed a synergistic effect to inhibit proliferation of SNU-475, previously the most resistant cell to EGFR-TKIs.

Here, we describe that combined use of two such mAbs, C225 (Cetuximab) and 425 (EMD55900), reduced growth and survival of EGFR overexpressing MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells more effectively than either antibody alone. Similarly, the C225/425 antibody combination more effectively inhibited AKT and MAPK phosphorylation in MDA-MB-468 cells. Surface plasmon resonance, size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation demonstrated that mAbs C225 and 425 simultaneously bind to distinct antigenic epitopes on domain III of the soluble wild-type EGFR. Furthermore, neither mAb competed with the other for binding to cells expressing either wild-type EGFR or a mutant EGFR (EGFRvIII) associated with neoplasia. Mutagenesis experiments revealed that residues S460/G461 in EGFR domain III are essential components of the 425 epitope and clearly distinguish it from the EGF/ TGFalpha binding site and the C225 interaction interface. Collectively, these results support the conclusion that therapeutic EGFR blockade in cancer patients by combined use of mAbs C225 and 425 could provide advantages over the use of the two antibodies as single agents.",

However, as with other targeted therapies, intrinsic/acquired resistance mechanisms limit efficacy. In the FaDu HNSCC xenograft model, we show that combined blockade of EGFR and ERBB3 promotes rapid tumor regression, followed by the eventual outgrowth of resistant cells. RNA sequencing revealed that resistant cells express FGFR3-TACC3 fusion proteins, which were validated as drivers of the resistant phenotype by several approaches, including CRISPR-mediated inactivation of FGFR3-TACC3 fusion genes. Interestingly, analysis of signaling in resistant cell lines demonstrated that FGFR3-TACC3 fusion proteins promote resistance by preferentially substituting for EGFR/RAS/ERK signaling rather than ERBB3/PI3K/AKT signaling. Furthermore, although FGFR3-TACC3 fusion proteins promote resistance of additional EGFR-dependent HNSCC and lung cancer cell lines to EGFR blockade, they are unable to compensate for inhibition of PI3K signaling in PIK3CA-mutant HNSCC cell lines. Validation of FGFR3-TACC3 fusion proteins as endogenous drivers of resistance in our screen provides strong evidence that these fusions are capable of substituting for EGFR signaling. Thus, FGFR3-TACC3 fusion proteins may represent a novel mechanism of acquired resistance in EGFR-dependent cancers of multiple cell lineages.Oncogene advance online publication, 27 June 2016 ; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.216.",

Further, increased neuroendocrine marker and decreased EGFR expression as well as greater sensitivity to BCL2 family inhibition are observed in resistant SCLC transformed cancers compared with resistant NSCLCs.

All patients received intravenous infusions of the exogenous hypoxia marker pimonidazole prior to biopsy. Presence of EGFR, pimonidazole binding, and colocalization between EGFR and tumor hypoxia were examined using immunohistochemistry.;Of all biopsies examined, respectively, 91% and 60% demonstrated EGFR- and pimonidazole-positive areas. A weak but significant association was found between the hypoxic fractions of pimonidazole (HFpimo) and EGFR fractions (F-EGFR) and between F-EGFR and relative vascular area. Various degrees of colocalization between hypoxia and EGFR were found, increasing with distance from the vasculature. A high fraction of EGFR was correlated with better disease-free and metastasis-free survival, whereas a high degree of colocalization correlated with poor outcome.;Colocalization of hypoxia and EGFR was demonstrated in head-and-neck squamous cell carcinomas, predominantly at longer distances from vessels.

A better understanding of this association could inform improved strategies for preventing and treating this disease. We investigated the expression, regulation, and function of the transcriptional regulator SRY-related high-mobility group box 9 (Sox9) in urothelial development, injury repair, and cancer. In mouse bladders, Sox9 levels were high during periods of prenatal urothelial development and diminished with maturation after birth. In adult urothelial cells, Sox9 was quiescent but was rapidly induced by a variety of injuries, including exposure to the carcinogen cyclophosphamide, culture with hydrogen peroxide, and osmotic stress. Activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) was required for Sox9 induction in urothelial injury and resulted from activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr) by several Egfr ligands that were dramatically induced by injury. In UroCa cell lines, SOX9 expression was constitutively upregulated and could be suppressed by EGFR or ERK1/2 blockade. Gene knockdown showed a role for SOX9 in cell migration and invasion. Accordingly, SOX9 protein levels were preferentially induced in invasive human UroCa tissue samples (n = 84) compared with noninvasive cancers (n = 56) or benign adjacent urothelium (n = 49). These results identify a novel, potentially oncogenic signaling axis linking urothelial injury to UroCa. Inhibiting this axis is feasible through a variety of pharmacologic approaches and may have clinical utility.",

After the initial promising results of EGFR-targeted therapies, therapeutic resistance is a major clinical problem. In order to overcome resistance to these EGFR-targeted therapies, new treatment options are necessary. In contrast to first generation EGFR inhibitors, afatinib (BIBW2992) is a second-generation irreversible ErbB family blocker that inhibits EGFR as well as HER2 and HER4. Consequently, treatment with afatinib may result in a distinct and more pronounced therapeutic benefit. Preclinical studies have reported promising results for afatinib in monotherapy as well as in combination with other drugs in CRC model systems. Furthermore, clinical studies examining afatinib as single agent and in combination therapy demonstrated manageable safety profile. Nevertheless, only limited antitumor activity has been observed in CRC patients. Although several combination treatments with afatinib have already been investigated, no optimal combination has been identified for CRC patients yet. As molecular tumor characteristics have gained increased importance in the choice of treatment, additional studies with biomarker-driven patient recruitment are required to further explore afatinib efficacy in CRC.

This study evaluated the relationship between HER2 and hormone receptors and explored the additional prognostic value of Ki67, EGFR, the androgen receptor, and p53.;Quantitative determination of HER2 and EGFR was performed in 240 invasive breast cancer tissue microarray specimens using quantum dot (QD)-based nanotechnology. We identified two subtypes of HER2, ie, high total HER2 load (HTH2) and low total HER2 load (LTH2), and three subtypes of hormone receptor, ie, high hormone receptor (HHR), low hormone receptor (LHR), and no hormone receptor (NHR). Therefore, breast cancer patients could be divided into five subtypes according to HER2 and hormone receptor status. Ki67, p53, and the androgen receptor were determined by traditional immunohistochemistry techniques. The relationship between hormone receptors and HER2 was investigated and the additional value of Ki67, EGFR, the androgen receptor, and p53 for prediction of 5-year disease-free survival was assessed.;In all patients, quantitative determination showed a statistically significant (P<0.001) negative correlation between HER2 and the hormone receptors and a significant positive correlation (P<0.001) between the estrogen receptor and the progesterone receptor (r=0.588), but a significant negative correlation (P<0.001, r=-0.618) with the HHR subtype. There were significant differences between the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 subtypes with regard to total HER2 load and hormone receptor subtypes. The rates of androgen receptor and p53 positivity were 46.3% and 57.0%, respectively. Other than the androgen receptor, differences in expression of Ki67, EGFR, and p53 did not achieve statistical significance (P>0.05) between the five subtypes. EGFR and Ki67 had prognostic significance for 5-year disease-free survival in univariate analysis, but the androgen receptor and p53 did not. Multivariate analysis identified that EGFR expression had predictive significance for 5-year disease-free survival in hormone-receptor positive patients and in those with the lymph node-positive breast cancer subtype.;Hormone receptor expression was indeed one of the molecular profiles in the subtypes identified by quantitative HER2 and vice versa. EGFR status may provide discriminative prognostic information in addition to HER2 and hormone receptor status, and should be integrated into routine practice to help formulate more specific prediction of the prognosis and appropriate individualized treatment.",

In the survival analysis of all the patients, coexpression of membranous IGF-1R and VEGF-R3 in stromal vessels was the most significant predictor of poor survival (hazard ratio, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.31-2.63; p<0.001).

EGFR mutations and overexpression have further been shown to modulate sensitivity to these EGFR-targeted therapies in NSCLC and several other types of cancers. However, it is clear that mutations and/or genetic variations in EGFR alone cannot explain all of the variability in the responses of patients with NSCLC to EGFR-targeted therapies. For instance, in addition to EGFR genotype, genetic variations in other members of the signaling pathway downstream of EGFR or variations in parallel receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathways are now recognized to have a significant impact on the efficacy of certain EGFR-targeted therapies. In this review, we highlight the mutations and genetic variations in such genes downstream of EGFR and in parallel RTK pathways. Specifically, the directional effects of these pharmacogenetic factors are discussed with a focus on two commonly prescribed EGFR inhibitors: cetuximab and erlotinib. The results of this comprehensive review can be used to optimize the treatment of NSCLC with EGFR inhibitors. Furthermore, they may provide the rationale for the design of subsequent combination therapies that involve the inhibition of EGFR. ",

More recently, further improvements in survival have occurred due to the use of novel targeted therapies such EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inibitors (EGFR-TKIs), EGFR monoclonal antibodies (EGFR-mAb), and VEGF antibodies. Despite the initial clinical efficacy of these inhibitors in such cancer, resistance invariably develops, typically within 1 to 2 years. Over the past several years, multiple molecular mechanisms of resistance have been identified, and some common themes have emerged. One is the development of resistance mutations in the drug target and another it is activation of alternative signaling of key downstream pathways despite sustained inhibition of the original drug target. In this mini-review, we summarize the concepts underlying EGFR- and VEGF-mediated resistance, the specific examples known to date, and the challenges of applying this knowledge to develop improved therapeutic strategies to prevent or overcome resistance.

All current EGFR inhibitors possess a structurally related quinazoline-based core scaffold and were identified as ATP-competitive inhibitors of wild-type EGFR. Here we identify a covalent pyrimidine EGFR inhibitor by screening an irreversible kinase inhibitor library specifically against EGFR T790M. These agents are 30- to 100-fold more potent against EGFR T790M, and up to 100-fold less potent against wild-type EGFR, than quinazoline-based EGFR inhibitors in vitro. They are also effective in murine models of lung cancer driven by EGFR T790M. Co-crystallization studies reveal a structural basis for the increased potency and mutant selectivity of these agents.

After oncogenic EGFR inhibition, TET1 binds to tumor suppressor promoters and induces their re-expression through active DNA demethylation. Ectopic expression of TET1 potently inhibits lung and glioblastoma tumor growth, and TET1 knockdown confers resistance to EGFR inhibitors in lung cancer cells. Lung cancer samples exhibited reduced TET1 expression or TET1 cytoplasmic localization in the majority of cases. Collectively, these results identify a conserved pathway of oncogenic EGFR-induced DNA methylation-mediated transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressors that may have therapeutic benefits for oncogenic EGFR-mediated lung cancers and glioblastomas.

EGFR mutation is rarely found in LSQC; however, more importantly, it is not a valid predictive biomarker for EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) in LSQC as it has been shown in LADC. Available data showed that the response rate and progression-free survival in EGFR mutant LSQC patients treated with EGFR-TKI are not better than that observed in patients treated with platinum-doublet chemotherapy in the first-line setting. Therefore, in contrast to advanced LADC, EGFR mutation testing may not be necessarily performed upfront in advanced LSQC because not only the mutation rate is low, but also the predictive value is insufficient.

Aggressive tumor cell subpopulations express Mena(INV), which promotes tumor cell invasion by potentiating EGF responses. However, the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. Here we report that Mena associates constitutively with the tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B and mediates a novel negative feedback mechanism that attenuates receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. On EGF stimulation, complexes containing Mena and PTP1B are recruited to the EGFR, causing receptor dephosphorylation and leading to decreased motility responses. Mena also interacts with the 5' inositol phosphatase SHIP2, which is important for the recruitment of the Mena-PTP1B complex to the EGFR. When Mena(INV) is expressed, PTP1B recruitment to the EGFR is impaired, providing a mechanism for growth factor sensitization to EGF, as well as HGF and IGF, and increased resistance to EGFR and Met inhibitors in signaling and motility assays. In sum, we demonstrate that Mena plays an important role in regulating growth factor-induced signaling. Disruption of this attenuation by Mena(INV) sensitizes tumor cells to low-growth factor concentrations, thereby increasing the migration and invasion responses that contribute to aggressive, malignant cell phenotypes.

We used cDNA microarrays to examine alterations in gene expression after treatment of carcinoma cells with PD153035, a specific and reversible inhibitor of EGFR function. When human cervical carcinoma cells were grown on a collagen substrate in three-dimensional organotypic culture, untreated cells expressed high levels of EGFR RNA and invaded the underlying collagen. Blocking EGFR function decreased DNA synthesis and inhibited invasion in a dose-dependent manner. Microarray analyses identified 312 genes that were significantly increased or decreased in expression after EGFR inhibition.

One notable innovation in recent decades has been the identification of a subset of breast cancers that overexpress the transmembrane glycoprotein human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and the consequent development of HER2-targeted therapy. Given the significant benefits demonstrated with the HER2-targeted monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab, in the adjuvant and metastatic settings, investigators have endeavored to develop novel mechanisms for disrupting HER2-mediated signaling. Lapatinib, an orally available HER1- and HER2-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, represents one such notable innovation. Lapatinib is currently being evaluated in both the adjuvant and metastatic settings and was recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in combination with capecitabine, for the treatment of women with HER2-positive, pretreated, metastatic breast cancer.

We report here that prostasin and its activating enzyme matriptase are capable of inducing proteolytic cleavages in the EGFR extracellular domain (ECD) when co-expressed in the FT-293 cells, generating two amino-terminally truncated fragments EGFR135 and EGFR110, at 135 and 110 kDa. Prostasin's role in EGFR cleavage is dependent on the serine active-site but not the GPI-anchor. The modifications of EGFR were confirmed to be on the primary structure by deglycosylation. EGFR135 and EGFR110 are not responsive to EGF stimulation, indicating loss of the ligand-binding domains. EGFR110 is constitutively phosphorylated and in its presence Erk1/2 phosphorylation is increased in the absence of EGF. The protease-induced EGFR cleavages are not dependent on EGFR phosphorylation. The EGFR ECD proteolytic modification by matriptase-prostasin is also observed in the BEAS-2B normal lung epithelial cells, the BPH-1 benign prostate hyperplasia and the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines; and represents a novel mechanism for epithelial cells to modulate EGF-EGFR signaling.",

In this study, EGFR gene amplification as defined by chromogenic in situ hybridization and protein overexpression was examined in a cohort of 47 metaplastic breast carcinomas. Furthermore, the presence of activating EGFR mutations in exons 18, 19, 20, and 21 was investigated. Thirty-two cases showed EGFR overexpression and of these, 11 (34%) harboured EGFR gene amplification. In addition, EGFR amplification showed a statistically significant association with EGFR overexpression (p < 0.0094) and was restricted to carcinomas with homologous metaplasia. Ten cases, five with and five without EGFR amplification, were subjected to microarray-based CGH, which demonstrated that EGFR copy number gain may occur by amplification of a discrete genomic region or by gains of the short arm of chromosome 7 with a breakpoint near the EGFR gene locus, the minimal region of amplification mapping to EGFR, LANCL2, and SEC61G. No activating EGFR mutations were identified, suggesting that this is unlikely to be a common alternative underlying genetic mechanism for EGFR expression in metaplastic breast carcinomas. Given that metaplastic breast carcinomas are resistant to conventional chemotherapy or hormone therapy regimens and that tumours with EGFR amplification are reported to be sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, these findings indicate that further studies are warranted to explore EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents for metaplastic breast carcinomas harbouring amplification of 7p11.2.",

Regular EGFR protein levels are increased in cancer cells and the receptor then becomes constitutively active. However, downstream signals generated by constitutively activated EGFR are unknown.

Constitutive or non-canonical EGFR signalling activates the transcription factor IRF3 leading to expression of IFI27, IFIT1 and TRAIL. Ligand-mediated activation of EGFR switches off IRF3-dependent transcription, activates canonical extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt signals, and confers sensitivity to chemotherapy and virus-induced cell death. Mechanistically, the distinct downstream signals result from a switch of EGFR-associated proteins. EGFR constitutively complexes with IRF3 and TBK1 leading to TBK1 and IRF3 phosphorylation. Addition of epidermal growth factor dissociates TBK1, IRF3 and EGFR leading to a loss of IRF3 activity, Shc-EGFR association and ERK activation.

However, individual studies often lack the power required to assess these relationships, and large-scale analyses are limited by the need for high throughput, standardized scoring methods. To address these limitations, we assessed whether automated image analysis of immunohistochemically stained tissue microarrays can permit rapid, standardized scoring of tumour markers from multiple studies. Tissue microarray sections prepared in nine studies containing 20 263 cores from 8267 breast cancers stained for two nuclear (oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor), two membranous (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and epidermal growth factor receptor) and one cytoplasmic (cytokeratin 5/6) marker were scanned as digital images. Automated algorithms were used to score markers in tumour cells using the Ariol system. We compared automated scores against visual reads, and their associations with breast cancer survival. Approximately 65-70% of tissue microarray cores were satisfactory for scoring. Among satisfactory cores, agreement between dichotomous automated and visual scores was highest for oestrogen receptor (Kappa = 0.76), followed by human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Kappa = 0.69) and progesterone receptor (Kappa = 0.67). Automated quantitative scores for these markers were associated with hazard ratios for breast cancer mortality in a dose-response manner. Considering visual scores of epidermal growth factor receptor or cytokeratin 5/6 as the reference, automated scoring achieved excellent negative predictive value (96-98%), but yielded many false positives (positive predictive value = 30-32%). For all markers, we observed substantial heterogeneity in automated scoring performance across tissue microarrays. Automated analysis is a potentially useful tool for large-scale, quantitative scoring of immunohistochemically stained tissue microarrays available in consortia. However, continued optimization, rigorous marker-specific quality control measures and standardization of tissue microarray designs, staining and scoring protocols is needed to enhance results. ",

Despite the improvement in overall survival with the addition of HER2-targeted agents to chemotherapy, many patients do not benefit from these agents because of inherent resistance. In addition, many patients who achieve an initial response eventually acquire drug resistance. Currently, several mechanisms of resistance have been described, including mutations in other signaling pathways, expression of a truncated form of HER2, receptor crosstalk, and autophagy. There are several approaches under study to target these pathways of resistance, including blocking PI3 kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling, blocking neoangiogenesis and the vascular endothelial growth factor axis, using monoclonal antibody targeting of the HER2 dimerization site, and using HER2 monoclonal antibody-drug conjugates.

The mean serum level for TGF-alpha in the gastric carcinoma patients was significantly elevated as compared with that of healthy controls (104 +/- 235 vs. 22 +/- 16 pg/ml; p = 0.03). Eleven patients with gastric carcinoma (27.5%) showed elevated serum TGF-alpha levels above the cutoff value of 54 pg/ml (defined as 2 standard deviations above the mean of the control group). No significant association was noted between the positivity of TGF-alpha and clinicopathologic characteristics including gender, age and stage. However, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma showed a higher positivity of serum TGF-alpha (43.8%) compared with other histologic types, which was marginally significant (p = 0.06).

In a number of tumours elastosis was also examined in relation to Ki-67 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) immunostaining. Sensitivity and specificity of DEL and TEL for predicting the receptor, Ki-67 and EGFR findings were estimated. Sensitivity of DEL and TEL for oestrogen and progesterone receptors is dependent on the degree of tumour differentiation and the degree of elastosis, increasing from DEL 1 degree and TEL 1 degree to DEL 3 degrees and TEL 3 degrees. It was more evident in grade 1 (G1) and G2 than in G3 carcinomas. Elastosis is a useful predictor of positive receptor findings particularly in G1 and G2 tumours with moderate and high-grade elastosis. It is a similarly useful predictor of negative receptor values in G3 carcinomas. The predictive value of DEL and TEL for the results of Ki-67 and EGFR immunostaining gradually decreases with increasing elastosis, consistent with the assumption that Ki-67 and EGFR identify the degree of tumour proliferation and invasion, while elastosis correlates with the degree of differentiation of breast cancer. Elastosis is a poor predictor of Ki-67 and EGFR findings in any individual breast cancer. Moderate and high-grade elastosis points to positive steroid hormone receptor assays in G1 and G2 carcinomas. In contrast, the lack of elastosis in G3 carcinomas may indicate a negative receptor assay. Both findings have a high degree of reliability.",

Remarkably HER3 activation by HRG could occurs independent of HER2, and in one cell line almost no HER4 activation by HRG was detected despite high levels expression. Both EGF and HRG induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), but the time course of MAPK activation differed depending on the hetero-dimers induced. EGF and HRG mediated cell growth through the EGFR/HER2 heterodimer and HER4, respectively, but not through HER3 when it was the only HRG receptor expressed and phosphorylated in the cells. These findings reveal a distinct pattern of HRG induced EGFR family interaction in ovarian cancer that is distinct from that described in human breast cancer. Moreover EGF and HRG can exert distinct biological functions depending on the receptor complexes induced in a given ovarian cancer cell line.",

Although most EGFR-mutant lung cancers are sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and shrink in response to treatment, acquired resistance to TKI therapy is common. We demonstrate here that two EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, HCC827 and HCC4006, contain a subpopulation of cells that have undergone epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and survive independent of activated EGFR. These EGFR-independent cancer cells, herein termed gefitinib-resistant (GR) cells, demonstrate higher levels of basal autophagy than their parental cells and thrive under hypoxic, reduced-serum conditions in vitro; this somewhat simulates the hypoxic environment common to cancerous tissues. We show that depletion of the essential autophagy gene, ATG5, by small interfering RNA (siRNA) or chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, markedly reduces GR cell viability under hypoxic conditions. Moreover, we show a significant elevation in caspase activity in GR cells following knockdown of ATG5. These results suggest that GR cells can evade apoptosis and survive in hostile, hypoxic environments with constant autophagic flux. We also show the presence of autophagosomes in some cancer cells from patient samples, even in untreated EGFR-mutant lung cancer tissue samples. Together, our results indicate that autophagy inhibitors alone or in combination with EGFR TKIs may be an effective approach for the treatment of EGFR-mutant lung cancers, where basal autophagy of some cancer cells is upregulated.

Mena expression level in primary tumors is correlated with metastasis in breast, cervical, colorectal and pancreatic cancers. Cells expressing high Mena levels are part of the tumor microenvironment for metastasis (TMEM), an anatomical structure that is predictive for risk of breast cancer metastasis. Previously we have shown that forced expression of Mena adenocarcinoma cells enhances invasion and metastasis in xenograft mice. Whether Mena is required for tumor progression is still unknown. Here we report the effects of Mena deficiency on tumor progression, metastasis and on normal mammary gland development.;To investigate the role of Mena in tumor progression and metastasis, Mena deficient mice were intercrossed with mice carrying a transgene expressing the polyoma middle T oncoprotein, driven by the mouse mammary tumor virus. The progeny were investigated for the effects of Mena deficiency on tumor progression via staging of primary mammary tumors and by evaluation of morbidity. Stages of metastatic progression were investigated using an in vivo invasion assay, intravital multiphoton microscopy, circulating tumor cell burden, and lung metastases. Mammary gland development was studied in whole mount mammary glands of wild type and Mena deficient mice.;Mena deficiency decreased morbidity and metastatic dissemination. Loss of Mena increased mammary tumor latency but had no affect on mammary tumor burden or histologic progression to carcinoma. Elimination of Mena also significantly decreased epidermal growth factor (EGF) induced in vivo invasion, in vivo motility, intravasation and metastasis. Non-tumor bearing mice deficient for Mena also showed defects in mammary gland terminal end bud formation and branching.;Deficiency of Mena decreases metastasis by slowing tumor progression and reducing tumor cell invasion and intravasation. Mena deficiency during development causes defects in invasive processes involved in mammary gland development. These findings suggest that functional intervention targeting Mena in breast cancer patients may provide a valuable treatment option to delay tumor progression and decrease invasion and metastatic spread leading to an improved prognostic outcome.",

We observed a significantly higher intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR and p185c-erbB-2 in the gastric mucosa of 24-mo-old (aged) rats than in that of their 4- or 12-mo-old counterparts. This was associated with increased levels of EGFR protein and steady-state mRNA levels of EGFR and p185c-erbB-2. In addition, we also observed threefold higher steady-state mRNA levels of transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha; one of the primary ligands of EGFR) in the gastric mucosa of aged rats than in that of 4-mo-old (young) animals. This was accompanied by a fivefold increase in the relative concentration of the 18-kDa precursor form of TGF-alpha in gastric mucosal membranes but not in the cytosol. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that aging is associated with increased tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR and p185c-erbB-2 in the gastric mucosa. Moreover, the observation that aging results in increased accumulation of TGF-alpha in gastric mucosal membranes raises the possibility that the membrane-bound TGF-alpha could partly be responsible for the constitutively active EGFR-induced signaling pathway in the gastric mucosa of aged rats and, in turn, for stimulation of mucosal proliferative activity.",

Gemcitabine given 24 h prior to (212)Pb-cetuximab increased the median survival from 174 d to 283 d, but carboplatin suppressed the effectiveness of (212)Pb-cetuximab. Notably, concurrent treatment of tumor-bearing mice with (212)Pb-labeled cetuximab and trastuzumab provided therapeutic benefit that was greater than either antibody alone. In conclusion, cetuximab proved to be an effective vehicle for targeting HER1-expressing tumors with α-radiation for the treatment of disseminated intraperitoneal disease. These studies provide further evidence that the multimodality therapy regimens may have greater efficacy and benefit in the treatment of cancer patients.",

We demonstrate significant activation of both signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 and its upstream activator Janus kinase (JAK)2, in high-grade ovarian carcinomas compared with normal ovaries and benign tumours. The association between STAT3 activation and migratory phenotype of ovarian cancer cells was investigated by EGF-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in OVCA 433 and SKOV3 ovarian cancer cell lines. Ligand activation of EGFR induced a fibroblast-like morphology and migratory phenotype, consistent with the upregulation of mesenchyme-associated N-cadherin, vimentin and nuclear translocation of beta-catenin. This occurred concomitantly with activation of the downstream JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Both cell lines expressed interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), and treatment with EGF within 1 h resulted in a several-fold enhancement of mRNA expression of IL-6. Consistent with that, EGF treatment of both OVCA 433 and SKOV3 cell lines resulted in enhanced IL-6 production in the serum-free medium. Exogenous addition of IL-6 to OVCA 433 cells stimulated STAT3 activation and enhanced migration. Blocking antibodies against IL-6R inhibited IL-6 production and EGF- and IL-6-induced migration. Specific inhibition of STAT3 activation by JAK2-specific inhibitor AG490 blocked STAT3 phosphorylation, cell motility, induction of N-cadherin and vimentin expression and IL6 production. These data suggest that the activated status of STAT3 in high-grade ovarian carcinomas may occur directly through activation of EGFR or IL-6R or indirectly through induction of IL-6R signalling. Such activation of STAT3 suggests a rationale for a combination of anti-STAT3 and EGFR/IL-6R therapy to suppress the peritoneal spread of ovarian cancer.",

The GI50 of gefitinib as well as the effects of gefitinib on growth factor actions in pancreatic cancer cell lines were analyzed using MTT assays. FACS analysis using Annexin and propidium iodide (PI) staining were performed to study cell cycle, apoptosis and cell death. Western blot analysis was carried out to investigate expression levels of the 4 members of the ErbB family of receptors in pancreatic cancer cell lines, as well as MAP kinase and EGFR phosphorylation. Soft agar assays were used to measure colony formations. Invasiveness of cancer cells was analyzed using Matrigel-coated filters. gefitinib inhibited cell proliferation of pancreatic cancer cell lines with GI50 concentrations ranging from 2.5 to over 10 micro M. Gefitinib completely inhibited EGF-induced cell proliferation, but did not significantly influence insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-induced mitogenesis.

Despite the use of cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy, distant failure still confuses clinicians and the outcome of metastatic NPC remains disappointing.

We predicted that combining the conventional cytotoxic drug cisplatin with the novel molecular-targeted agent cetuximab demonstrates a strong antitumor effect on NPC cells. In this study, we selected HNE1 and CNE2 cells, which have been proved to possess different EGFR expression levels, to validate our conjecture. The two-drug regimen showed a significant synergistic effect in HNE1 cells but an additive effect in CNE2 cells. Our results showed that cisplatin-induced apoptosis was significantly enhanced by cetuximab in the high EGFR-expressing HNE1 cells but not in CNE2 cells. Further molecular mechanism study indicated that the EGFR/AKT pathway may play an important role in cell apoptosis via the mitochondrial-mediated intrinsic pathway and lead to the different antitumor effects of this two-drug regimen between HNE1 and CNE2 cells. Thus, the regimen may be applied in personalized NPC treatments. ",

Here we report a distinct resistance mechanism whereby PTEN inactivation specifically raises EGFR activity by impairing the ligand-induced ubiquitylation and degradation of the activated receptor through destabilization of newly formed ubiquitin ligase Cbl complexes. PTEN-associated resistance to EGFR kinase inhibitors is phenocopied by expression of dominant negative Cbl and can be overcome by more complete EGFR kinase inhibition.

Several kinds of agents targeting this receptor are currently progressing through preclinical or clinical investigations. These agents are usually monoclonal antibodies with unique characteristics, and some have shown efficacy and been welltolerated in clinical trials. For example, patritumab and seribantumab are thought to compete with ligand binding and have proven efficacy for some malignancies in Phase II clinical trials. LJM716 locks the human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 in the inactive conformation in both ligand-dependent and - independent cancers. Lumretuzumab is a glycoengineered antibody, which enhances antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Duligotumab is an antibody that targets both the human epidermal growth factor receptors 1 and 3. Heregulin is a human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 ligand that represents an encouraging candidate biomarker for the prediction of the efficacy of agents targeting this receptor.;A number of antibodies that interact with human epidermal growth factor receptors have been evaluated for clinical use.

Over expression of EGFR is associated with carcinogenesis and seen in variety of cancers. Anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies can block EGFR downstream signaling pathway resulting in inhibition of uncontrolled cell proliferation. Antibody fragments have a variety of advantages. In comparison to full length antibodies they have smaller size and therefor exhibit better tumor penetration ability. The aim of this study was to prepare a single domain antibody to target extracellular domain of EGFR. mRNA was extracted from C225 hybridoma cells producing anti-EGFR antibody and subjected to reverse transcription reaction (RT-PCR) to obtain cDNA molecules encoding VH domain of mAb C225. The cDNA encoded VH domain was in frame introduced into the pET-22b(+) vector and expressed in BL21 (DE3) bacterial cells. The resultant antibody was purified via Ni- NTA column and its reactivity was assessed by ELISA and western blot techniques using A431 cell lysate. Analysis by ELISA revealed that this single domain antibody was able to bind EGFR on A431cells. This result was further confirmed by western blotting. In conclusion, the results of this study indicated that single domain antibody can identify and bind to EGFR of A431 carcinoma cells. This recombinant fragment antibody would potentially be used for targeting of cancer cells with high EGFR expression. ",

Several strategies for EGFR targeting have been developed, the most succesful being represented by monoclonal antibodies, that directly interfere with ligand-receptor binding and small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, that interfere with activation/phosphorylation of EGFR. These agents have been authorized in advanced chemorefractory cancers, including colorectal cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer and head and neck cancer. However, evidence of resistance to these drugs has been described and extensive studies have been performed to investigate whether resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy is primary or secondary. Cellular levels of EGFR do not always correlate with response to the EGFR inhibitors. Indeed, in spite of the over expression and efficient inhibition of EGFR, resistance to EGFR inhibitors may occur. Moreover, given the genetic instability of cancer cells, genetic modifications could enable them to acquire a resistant phenotype to anti-EGFR therapies. Taken together, these findings support the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms affecting cancer cell sensitivity or resistance to such inhibitors. This review will focus on the most relevant mechanisms contributing to the acquisition of sensitivity/resistance to EGFR inhibitors.",

Emerging data suggest that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase may contribute to breast cancer genesis and progression.

Reliable biomarkers for the identification of patients who             are likely to benefit from this treatment are not available. In this study, we             assessed the activity of cetuximab in five gastric cancer cell lines (AGS, AZ521,             Hs746T, LMSU and MKN1). The viability of two of these cell lines, AZ521 and MKN1,             was significantly reduced by cetuximab treatment. High expression and secretion             levels of the EGFR-binding ligand, amphiregulin (AREG), were associated with cetuximab             responsiveness. MET activation and mutations in Kirsten-Ras gene (KRAS) were associated             with cetuximab resistance. By introducing a hierarchy between these markers, we             established a model that facilitated the correct classification of all five gastric             cancer cell lines as cetuximab responsive or non-responsive. The highest priority             was allocated to activating KRAS mutations, followed by MET activation and finally             by the levels of secreted AREG. In order to validate these results, we used three             additional human gastric cancer cell lines (KATOIII, MKN28 and MKN45).

In addition, several studies have investigated the anti-tumor effects of combinations of an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor agent and a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor. In general, in these studies, supra-additive anti-tumor efficacy was apparent when combining anti-epidermal growth factor receptor and anti-angiogenic treatments. Beneficial effects were also observed when combining this dual targeted therapy with either conventional chemotherapy or irradiation.;Early clinical trials combining the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor drug erlotinib (Tarceva) and the anti-angiogenic agent bevacizumab (Avastin) show acceptable toxicity and promising anti-tumor activity (lung cancer), which need to be confirmed in randomized trials.",

It has been reported that somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR or ERBB2 genes occur in a subset of patients with lung cancer. We searched for mutations of the EGFR, ERBB2, and KRAS genes in surgically resected non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) to determine the prevalence of these mutations in Korean lung cancer patients. In addition, we examined the relationship between the mutations and clinicopathologic features of lung cancers. Mutations of the EGFR, ERBB2, and KRAS genes were determined by polymerase chain reaction-based direct sequencing in 115 surgically resected non-small cell lung cancers. EGFR mutations were present in 20 patients (17.4%). The EGFR mutations were found only in adenocarcinomas (20 of 55 adenocarcinomas, 36.4%). The ERBB2 mutation was found in 1 adenocarcinoma of the 115 NSCLCs (0.9% overall; 1.8% of the 55 adenocarcinomas). KRAS mutations were found in 6 (5.2%) of the 115 NSCLCs (2 of 60 squamous cell carcinomas, or 3.3%, and 4 of 55 adenocarcinomas, or 7.3%). EGFR mutations in adenocarcinomas were more frequent in women (P = 0.02) and in never-smokers (P = 0.004). EGFR mutations in adenocarcinomas were not associated with pathologic stage in never-smokers, but were more frequent in pathologic stage II-IV than in stage I in ever-smokers (P = 0.01). Of the 55 adenocarcinomas, 25 (45.5%) had mutations of one or another of the three genes; EGFR mutations were never found in adenocarcinomas together with ERBB2 or KRAS mutations. These findings suggest that the EGFR mutation is frequent in Korean lung cancer patients, and that the ERBB2 mutation is rare. Further studies are needed to investigate the role of EGFR mutations in the carcinogenesis of adenocarcinoma among smokers.",

In this study we evaluated the frequency of point mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) for future use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in clinical treatment and to assess the use of EGFR, p16INK4a and E-cadherin as biomarkers in cervical cancer diagnosis with immunohistochemistry. Fifty-three patient specimens of cervical cancer were analysed for HPV infection, for EGFR mutations in exons 18 through 21, and for expression of EGFR, p16INK4a and E-cadherin by immunostaining. Results showed that 79.24% of the cases (42/53) are HPV positive and the HPV types more closely associated with risk are HPV 16 and 18. In all 53 analysed specimens, any mutation affecting the EGFR kinase domain in exons 18 through 21 was observed.

Thus, EGFR, p16INK4a and E-cadherin would be excellent tools for IHC analysis during the cervical cancer development.

In these patients, there is often an initial dramatic response to treatment with the first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) erlotinib or gefitinib. A small number of patients with EGFR mutations have primary resistance to erlotinib and gefitinib, and most patients who initially respond to treatment with erlotinib or gefitinib will develop resistance to first-generation EGFR TKIs. The problems with both primary and acquired resistance to erlotinib and gefitinib support the need for development of additional agents that inhibit EGFR signaling in such patients. This is an overview of three representative second-generation EGFR TKIs. HKI-272, a second-generation irreversible EGFR TKI that also inhibits HER2, has completed accrual of a phase II trial in both untreated patients and patients with acquired resistance to erlotinib or gefitinib. XL647 is a reversible inhibitor of EGFR, HER2, and vascular epidermal growth factor receptor. Preclinical work shows that XL647 can inhibit cell lines bearing mutated forms of EGFR that have been associated with acquired resistance. BIBW2992 is an irreversible EGFR TKI that also inhibits HER2 and vascular epidermal growth factor receptors. In vitro work shows that this compound inhibits wild-type EGFR, EGFR exon 19 deletion, EGFR L858R, and EGFR T790M, the mutation associated with acquired resistance. The preliminary results from phase I and phase II trials for BIBW-2992 and XL647 are discussed.",

Several types of human malignancies harbor activating BRAF mutations, most frequently a V600E substitution. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a transmembrane tyrosine kinase (TK) receptor that mediates proliferation and survival signaling, is expressed in a wide variety of normal and neoplastic tissues. EGFR inhibitors have produced objective responses in patients with non-small cell lung carcinomas harboring activating EGFR TK domain somatic mutations. We evaluated the presence of mutations in BRAF (exons 11 and 15), KRAS (exons 1 and 2), NRAS (exons 1 and 2), and EGFR (exons 18-21) in adrenal carcinomas (35 tumor specimens and two cell lines) by DNA sequencing. BRAF mutations were found in two carcinomas (5.7%). Four carcinomas (11.4%) carried EGFR TK domain mutations. One specimen carried a KRAS mutation, and another carried two NRAS mutations. No mutations were found in the two adrenocortical cell lines. BRAF- and EGFR-mutant tumor specimens exhibited stronger immunostaining for the phosphorylated forms of the MEK and ERK kinases than their wild-type counterparts. EGFR-mutant carcinomas exhibited increased phosphorylation of EGFR (Tyr 992) compared with wild-type carcinomas. We conclude that BRAF, RAS, and EGFR mutations occur in a subset of human adrenocortical carcinomas.

This provided support for analogous efforts for drugs that target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).

However, such biological therapies, including those targeting epidermal growth factor receptor pathways, pose a risk of increasing cancer rates. Using two mouse models of colitis-associated cancer, we found that epidermal growth factor receptor inactivation accelerated the incidence and progression of colorectal tumors. By modulating inflammation and epithelial regeneration, epidermal growth factor receptor optimized the response to chronic inflammation and limited subsequent tumorigenesis.

Using evidence from human patient samples, transgenic animal models, and cell and molecular biology studies we highlight the roles of this signalling pathway in lung development, homeostasis, repair, and disease ontogeny. We identify mechanisms underlying lung EGFR pathway regulation and suggest how targeting these mechanisms using new and existing therapies has the potential to improve future lung cancer, COPD and pulmonary fibrosis patient outcomes.

However, the effective antitumor capacity of EGFR-specific T cells against EGFR-overexpressing tumor cells has not been fully elucidated. In our previous study, we identified an anti-EGFR single-chain variable fragment (scFv) with specific and high affinity after screening by ribosome display. In this study, the anticancer potential of anti-EGFR scFv was investigated on the basis of cell-targeted therapy. A chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting EGFR was constructed and expressed on the cell membrane of T lymphocytes. These CAR-modified T cells demonstrated antitumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the safety evaluation showed that CAR-modified lymphocytes have no or very minimal acute systemic toxicity. Taken together, our study provided the experimental basis for clinical application of genetically engineered lymphocytes; moreover, we also evaluate a new and interesting cell therapy protocol.",

Sex bias occurrence was conserved in our model, with male experimental mice developing liver tumors at reduced latency and higher tumor penetrance. In parallel, we explored sex differences regarding genomic aberrations in 235 HCC patients. Liver cancer candidate genes were identified from both sexes and genotypes. Interestingly, transposon insertions in the epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr) gene were common in SB-induced liver tumors from male mice (10/10, 100%) but infrequent in female mice (2/9, 22%).

Our analysis results show that the Spearman׳s rank correlation coefficients between the PFS and three types of local surface properties are all greater than 0.6 with small P-values, implying a high significance. Moreover, the number of atoms with solid angles in the ranges of [0.71, 1], [0.61, 1] or [0.5, 1], indicating the convex degree of a local EGFR surface, also shows a strong correlation with the PFS.

Methotrexate, vincristine, adriamycin and cisplatin (M-VAC) chemotherapy has been the standard of therapy for over a decade. However, there has been no improvement in patient survival. Encouraging preclinical data have resulted in the rapid translation of epidermal growth factor receptor antagonists into the clinic. However, phase I and II single-agent clinical trials in head and neck, lung, and colon cancer failed to match the hope generated by laboratory investigations since only a minority of patients seemed to benefit from this approach. Nonetheless, recent data revealed that non-small-cell lung cancer tumors that responded to single-agent Iressa possessed activating epidermal growth factor receptor mutations. These findings have generated refound interest for epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent tumors that are identified by molecular and pharmacodynamic approaches prior to or early in the course of therapy.;Targeted therapy against epidermal growth factor receptor has become one of the primary focuses of the genitourinary SPORE in bladder cancer. The SPORE grant scheme is designed to encourage rapid development of new and innovative cancer research in areas of high priority, in this case bladder cancer. The SPORE has facilitated the advancement of novel epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted therapy, such as the monoclonal antibody IMC-225 and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor ZD1839 (Iressa), from the laboratory to clinical trials.

We found that ERBB4 activated the transcriptional coactivator YAP, which promotes organ and tissue growth and is inhibited by the Hippo tumor-suppressor pathway. Overexpressing ERBB4 in cultured mammary epithelial cells or adding the ERBB4 ligand neuregulin 1 (NRG1) to breast cancer cell cultures promoted the expression of genes regulated by YAP, such as CTGF. Knocking down YAP or ERBB4 prevented the induction of CTGF expression by NRG1, as did treating cells with the ERBB inhibitors lapatinib or erlotinib, which reduced ERBB4 cleavage. NRG1 stimulated YAP activity to an extent comparable to that of EGF (epidermal growth factor) or LPA (lysophosphatidic acid), known activators of YAP. NRG1 stimulated YAP-dependent cell migration in breast cancer cell lines. These observations connect the unusual nuclear function of a growth factor receptor with a mechanosensory pathway and suggest that NRG1-ERBB4-YAP signaling contributes to the aggressive behavior of tumor cells.

MUC1 knockout cells were more sensitive to the EGFR inhibitor, lapatinib. Finally, MUC1 and EGFR co-expression was associated with increased cellular proliferation in human endometrial tumors.

Several drugs are being developed to overcome EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance. Here, we report that pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) stabilized mutant EGFR protein by direct interaction and sustained cell survival signaling in lung cancer cells. PKM2 silencing resulted in markedly reduced mutant EGFR expression in TKI-sensitive or -resistant human lung cancer cells, and in inhibition of tumor growth in their xenografts, concomitant with downregulation of EGFR-related signaling. Mechanistically, PKM2 directly interacted with mutant EGFR and heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90), and thus stabilized EGFR by maintaining its binding with HSP90 and co-chaperones. Stabilization of EGFR relied on dimeric PKM2, and the protein half-life of mutant EGFR decreased when PKM2 was forced into its tetramer form. Clinical levels of PKM2 positively correlated with mutant EGFR expression and with patient outcome. These results reveal a previously undescribed non-glycolysis function of PKM2 in the cytoplasm, which contribute to EGFR-dependent tumorigenesis and provide a novel strategy to overcome drug resistance to EGFR TKIs.

We use EGF as a metastatic inducer of MDA-MB-231 cells to investigate the effect of NFD on cell migration and invasion. NFD suppressed EGF-mediated protein levels of c-Jun and c-Fos, and reduced MMP-9 expression and activity, concomitantly with a marked inhibition on cell migration and invasion without obvious cellular cytotoxicity.

Furthermore, the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 inhibited EGF-induced MMP-9 expression, cell migration and invasion, as well as the activation of PI3K/Akt, suggesting that PI3K/Akt activation occur downstream of EGFR activation.

The Gs protein-coupled transmembrane receptor, GPR30, is linked to specific estrogen binding and rapid estrogen-mediated release of heparin-bound epidermal growth factor. Using marker rescue and dominant interfering mutant strategies, we show that estrogen action via GPR30 promotes fibronectin (FN) matrix assembly by human breast cancer cells. Stimulation with 17beta-estradiol or the ER antagonist, ICI 182, 780, results in the recruitment of FN-engaged integrin alpha5beta1 conformers to fibrillar adhesions and the synthesis of FN fibrils. Concurrent with this cellular response, GPR30 promotes the formation of Src-dependent, Shc-integrin alpha5beta1 complexes. Function-blocking antibodies directed against integrin alpha5beta1 or soluble Arg-Gly-Asp peptide fragments derived from FN specifically inhibited GPR30-mediated epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation. Estrogen-mediated FN matrix assembly and epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation were similarly disrupted in integrin beta1-deficient GE11 cells, whereas reintroduction of integrin beta1 into GE11 cells restored these responses. Mutant Shc (317Y/F) blocked GPR30-induced FN matrix assembly and tyrosyl phosphorylation of erbB1. Interestingly, relative to recombinant wild-type Shc, 317Y/F Shc was more readily retained in GPR30-induced integrin alpha5beta1 complexes, yet this mutant did not prevent endogenous Shc-integrin alpha5beta1 complex formation.

As of 2011, most of the patients with advanced NSCLC are tested in Japan, and the use of cytological samples has significantly contributed to this success. A portion of samples used to determine a definite diagnosis of NSCLC, either tissue samples or cytological samples, is ensured to contain cancer cells, and is then investigated by an EGFR mutation test that is applicable to both tissue samples and cytological samples. Cytological samples now account for one-third of all the samples investigated. EGFR mutation is detected in cytological samples at a similar rate with tissue samples. The criterion ensuring an EGFR mutation test to have satisfactory sensitivity and specificity for use in both tissue and cytological samples is presented. Cytological samples are valuable clinical sources being collected less invasively than tissue samples, and should therefore be extensively used in EGFR mutation testing.",

Increased LeY expression activates             epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor             2 (HER2) and promotes cell proliferation in EGFR-overexpressing cells. However,             the effect of downregulation of LeY expression on cell proliferation in HER2-overexpressing             cells remains unknown. FUT1 encodes α1,2-fucosyltransferase, a key enzyme for             LeY synthesis. We knocked down FUT1 by short interfering RNA (siRNA) in four HER2-overexpressing             human cancer cell lines, including NCI-N87, MKN7, SKBr3 and BT474. We investigated             whether downregulation of LeY and alteration in the glycosylation status of these             cells affect cell proliferation and HER2 activation. Knocking down FUT1 expression             markedly inhibited proliferation of NCI-N87, which highly expressed EGFR and was             sensitive to EGFR deprivation. Furthermore, FUT1 siRNA downregulated the total             amount of HER2 protein, phosphorylation of HER2 and EGFR, and phosphorylation             of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in this cell line. Moreover, the             marked downregulation of phosphorylation of HER2 and ERK was observed following             short-time EGF-stimulation. These effects were not observed in the other three             cell lines. Our results suggest that knockdown of FUT1 downregulates HER2 signaling             via EGFR downregulation.

Aberrant EGFR signaling is correlated with progression of various malignancies, and somatic tyrosine kinase domain mutations in the EGFR gene have been discovered in patients with non-small cell lung cancer responding to EGFR-targeting small molecular agents, such as gefitinib and erlotinib. EGFR overexpression is thought to be the principal mechanism of activation in various malignant tumors. Moreover, an increased EGFR copy number is associated with improved survival in non-small cell lung cancer patients, suggesting that increased expression of mutant and/or wild-type EGFR molecules could be molecular determinants of responses to gefitinib. However, as EGFR mutations and/or gene gains are not observed in all patients who respond partially to treatment, alternative mechanisms might confer sensitivity to EGFR-targeting agents. Preclinical studies showed that sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors depends on how closely cell survival and growth signalings are coupled with EGFR, and also with HER2 and HER3, in each cancer.

ErbB3 binds neuregulins via its extracellular region and signals primarily by heterodimerizing with ErbB2/HER2/Neu. A recently appreciated role for ErbB3 in resistance of tumor cells to EGFR/ErbB2-targeted therapeutics has made it a focus of attention. However, efforts to inactivate ErbB3 therapeutically in parallel with other ErbB receptors are challenging because its intracellular kinase domain is thought to be an inactive pseudokinase that lacks several key conserved (and catalytically important) residues-including the catalytic base aspartate. We report here that, despite these sequence alterations, ErbB3 retains sufficient kinase activity to robustly trans-autophosphorylate its intracellular region--although it is substantially less active than EGFR and does not phosphorylate exogenous peptides. The ErbB3 kinase domain binds ATP with a K(d) of approximately 1.1 microM. We describe a crystal structure of ErbB3 kinase bound to an ATP analogue, which resembles the inactive EGFR and ErbB4 kinase domains (but with a shortened alphaC-helix). Whereas mutations that destabilize this configuration activate EGFR and ErbB4 (and promote EGFR-dependent lung cancers), a similar mutation conversely inactivates ErbB3. Using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations, we delineate a reaction pathway for ErbB3-catalyzed phosphoryl transfer that does not require the conserved catalytic base and can be catalyzed by the \"inactive-like\" configuration observed crystallographically. These findings suggest that ErbB3 kinase activity within receptor dimers may be crucial for signaling and could represent an important therapeutic target.",

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family member ERBB4, which forms signaling complexes with other EGFR family members, can undergo ligand-induced proteolytic cleavage to release a soluble intracellular domain (ICD) that enters the nucleus to modify transcription. We found that ERBB4 activates sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) to enhance low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake and cholesterol biosynthesis. Expression of the ERBB4 ICD in mammary epithelial cells or activation of ERBB4 with the ligand neuregulin 1 (NRG1) induced the expression of SREBP target genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, including HMGCR and HMGCS1, and lipid uptake, LDLR, which encodes the LDL receptor. Addition of NRG1 increased the abundance of the cleaved, mature form of SREBP-2 through a pathway that was blocked by addition of inhibitors of PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) or dual inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2, but not by inhibition of AKT or mTORC1. Pharmacological inhibition of the activity of SREBP site 1 protease or of all EGFR family members (with lapatinib), but not EGFR alone (with erlotinib), impaired NRG1-induced expression of cholesterol biosynthesis genes. Collectively, our findings indicated that activation of ERBB4 promotes SREBP-2-regulated cholesterol metabolism. The connections of EGFR and ERBB4 signaling with SREBP-2-regulated cholesterol metabolism are likely to be important in ERBB-regulated developmental processes and may contribute to metabolic remodeling in ERBB-driven cancers.

Further, the expression of miR-21 is regulated by EGFR via the activation of β-catenin and AP-1. These data indicate that a feedback loop exists between miR-21 and EGFR.

        "Doc_abstract":"Esophageal cancer is one of the most common cancers, and the 5-year survival rate is less than 10% due to lack of effective therapeutic agents. This study was to evaluate antitumor activity of Ec-LDP-Hr-AE, a recently developed bispecific enediyne-energized fusion protein targeting both epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), on esophageal cancer. The fusion protein Ec-LDP-Hr-AE consists of two oligopeptide ligands and an enediyne antibiotic lidamycin (LDM) for receptor binding and cell killing, respectively. The current study demonstrated that Ec-LDP-Hr had high affinity to bind to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells, and enediyne-energized fusion protein Ec-LDP-Hr-AE showed potent cytotoxicity to ESCC cells with differential expression of EGFR and HER2. Ec-LDP-Hr-AE could cause significant G2-M arrest in EC9706 and KYSE150 cells, and it also induced apoptosis in ESCC cells in a dosage-dependent manner. Western blot assays showed that Ec-LDP-Hr-AE promoted caspase-3 and caspase-7 activities as well as PARP cleavage. Moreover, Ec-LDP-Hr-AE inhibited cell proliferation via decreasing phosphorylation of EGFR and HER2, and further exerted inhibition of the activation of their downstream signaling molecules. In vivo, at a tolerated dose, Ec-LDP-Hr-AE inhibited tumor growth by 88% when it was administered to nude mice bearing human ESCC cell KYSE150 xenografts. These results indicated that Ec-LDP-Hr-AE exhibited potent anti-caner efficacy on ESCC, suggesting it could be a promising candidate for targeted therapy of esophageal cancer. ",

A series of EGFR inhibitors from both the monoclonal antibody (mAb) and tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) class have shown clear clinical activity in the treatment of several common human cancers. Three EGFR inhibitors have recently gained Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for cancer therapy in the United States including the mAb cetuximab (Erbitux) and the small-molecule TKIs gefitinib (Iressa) and erlotinib (Tarceva). The rapidly expanding preclinical and clinical data contributing to these FDA approvals validate a central role of the EGFR as an important molecular target in epithelial malignancies. Indeed, one of the more striking clinical results in this field has been recently achieved by combining an EGFR inhibitor (cetuximab) with radiation in the treatment of advanced head and neck cancer patients. Nevertheless, the overall clinical gains realized to date with the EGFR inhibitors are modest for the global cancer population. Much remains to be learned regarding the rational integration of EGFR inhibitors into cancer treatment regimens as well as methods to optimize the selection of patients most likely to benefit from EGFR inhibitor strategies.",

We determined crystal structures of the wild-type and T790M/L858R double mutant EGFR kinases with reversible and irreversible pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidine inhibitors based on analogues of TAK-285 and neratinib. In these structures, M790 adopts distinct conformations to accommodate different inhibitors, whereas R858 allows conformational variations of the activation loop. These results provide structural insights for understanding the structure-activity relationships that should contribute to the development of potent inhibitors against drug-sensitive or -resistant EGFR mutations.

The transcription factor Snail is known as one of the most prominent transcriptional E-cadherin repressors; its regulation in cancer tissues, however, still remains unclear.

Stimulation of two endometrial carcinoma cell lines with epidermal growth factor (EGF) lead to an increase of Snail protein expression. In primary human endometrioid endometrial carcinomas Snail protein expression correlated with the activated, phosphorylated form of EGFR (Tyr1086) as revealed by profiling 24 different signalling proteins using protein lysate microarrays. In addition, we observed an inverse correlation between Snail and E-cadherin protein levels in these tumours. Most likely, p38 MAPK, PAK1, AKT, ERK1/2 and GSK-3beta are involved in the up-regulation of Snail downstream of EGFR. Snail mRNA expression did not show a correlation with activated EGFR in these tumours. Taken together, profiling of signalling proteins in primary human tissues provided strong evidence that EGFR signalling is involved in Snail protein overexpression.",

NSCLC cells expressing mutant EGFRs underwent extensive apoptosis after small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of the mutant EGFR or treatment with pharmacological inhibitors of Akt and STAT signaling and were relatively resistant to apoptosis induced by conventional chemotherapeutic drugs.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), a standard methodology to detect EGFR copy number abnormalities in nonsmall cell lung carcinoma, is limited by instrumentation and cost. Chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) is an emerging alternative detection technique using light microscopy, but its utility in assessing EGFR copy number in lung cancer is not established. To address the utility of CISH, we studied paraffin-embedded nonsmall cell lung carcinoma specimens from 77 Taiwanese nonsmoking women treated by surgery alone. We recorded the number of signals per tumor cell nucleus, correlated EGFR copy number by CISH with FISH results, and used receiver operating characteristics to identify cut-off points for the CISH results. Tumors were classified as adenocarcinoma (n=28), mixed adenocarcinoma with bronchioloalveolar features (n=25), bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (n=2), squamous cell carcinoma (n=15), and adenosquamous carcinoma (n=7). By FISH, 29% of cases had no amplification, 18% had low polysomy, 35% had high polysomy, and 12% had gene amplification. EGFR copy number detected by CISH highly correlated with FISH (Spearman r=0.81, P<0.0001). We determined the optimal EGFR CISH cut-off points that discriminate between no amplification and low polysomy (2.8 signals, P=0.09); no amplification plus low polysomy and high polysomy plus gene amplification (4.5 signals, P<0.0001); and high polysomy and gene amplification (7.1 signals, P=0.0003).

Marked increases were observed for the TGFs and c-sis, whereas EGFR mRNA was poorly expressed; there was no correlation with pathological staging of the cancers. In the nonneoplastic tissues, 14 had normal histology and 27 displayed superficial (SG) or atrophic gastritis (AG). Transcript levels greater than or equal to + were similar between these categories for all the growth factors, but were about 50% higher for EGFR in the tissues with gastritis. Concurrent expression of TGF alpha and EGFR (greater than or equal to + level) was more frequent in the paired tumors (38%) than in adjacent nonmalignant tissue (6%) and was seen in only one of 14 (7%) normal samples, in three of 19 (16%) of those with AG, and none of eight of those displaying SG.

The patient received gastroscopy due to an epigastric pain during the adjuvant chemotherapy. The endoscopic examination revealed an erosive lesion at the posterior wall of the gastric body. The gastric lesion was immunohistochemically diagnosed as a metastatic disease from the breast cancer. The patient initially received hormone therapy, according to the subtype of the primary and the metastatic diseases. The gastric lesion initially disappeared; however, a relapsed lesion transformed into luminal human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 type from luminal type. Subsequently, the metastatic lesions underwent repeated subtype changing, which created difficultly when deciding the treatment strategy. The molecular profile of breast cancer can change during the treatment, resulting in the treatment resistance observed in certain cases.

This review will focus on the signal transduction through this protein, and explains how the overexpression of erbB2 may result in poor prognosis of breast cancer, and finally it will summerize our current understanding about the therapeutic potential of receptor-targeted therapy in breast cancer. ErbB2 does not have any known ligand which is able to bind to it with high affinity. However the kinase activity of erbB2 can be activated without any ligand, if it is overexpressed, and by heteroassociation with other members of the erbB family (erbB1 or epidermal growth factor receptor, erbB3 and erbB4). This interaction substantially increases the efficiency and diversity of signal transduction through these receptor complexes. In addition, erbB2 forms large scale receptor clusters containing hundreds of proteins. These receptor islands may take part in recruiting cytosolic factors which relay the signal towards the nucleus or the cytoplasm. Overexpression of erbB2 was linked to higher transforming activity, increased metastatic potential, angiogenesis and drug resistence of breast tumor in laboratory experiments. As a corollary of these properties, erbB2 amplification is generally thought to be associated with a poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. These early findings lead to the development of antibodies that down-regulate erbB2. Such a therapeutic approach has already been found effective in experimental tumor models and in clinical trials as well. Further understanding of the importance of erbB2 and growth factor receptors in the transformation of normal cells to malignant ones may once give us a chance to cure erbB2 over-expressing breast cancer.",

The significance of the EGFR as a cancer therapeutic target is underscored by the clinical development of several different classes of EGFR antagonists, including monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Extensive preclinical studies have demonstrated the anti-tumor effects of mAb806 against tumor xenografts overexpressing EGFR. EGF stimulation of A431 cells induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular signalling proteins which regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis. Detailed understanding of the intracellular signalling pathways and components modulated by mAbs (such as mAb806) to EGFR, and other growth factor receptors, remain limited. The use of fluorescence 2D difference gel electrophoresis (2D DIGE), coupled with sensitive MS-based protein profiling in A431 tumor (epidermoid carcinoma) xenografts, in combination with mAb806, revealed proteins modulating endocytosis, cell architecture, apoptosis, cell signalling pathways and cell cycle regulation, including Dynamin-1-like protein, cofilin-1 protein, and 14-3-3 protein zeta/delta. Further, we report various proteins, including Interferon-induced protein 53 (IFI53), and Oncogene EMS1 (EMS1) which have roles in the tumor microenvironment, regulating cancer cell invasiveness, angiogenesis and formation of metastases.

Increased inhibition of pEGFR in both the cell types explains its higher anti-cancer activity. Interestingly, gefitinib resistant, H1975 (T790M EGFR mutant) lung carcinoma cells was also found to be sensitive to GNPs. Our data shows that GNPs hyperacetylate histone H3 in these cells, either directly or indirectly, which may account for the augmented cell death. GNPs were proficient in activating histone acetyltransferases (p300/CBP), which in turn induces the expression of p21 and cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, inhibition of histone acetyltransferases by garcinol results in alleviation of cell death caused by GNPs. In addition to this, nuclear intrusion of GNPs results in the inhibition of NO production in nucleus, possibly through nuclear EGFR, which might be responsible for preventing cell proliferation in resistant cells. To best of our knowledge, we provide first evidence that GNPs potentiate cell death by activating p300/CBP histone acetyltransferases.",

Here, the role of CCK/gastrin and CI-988 on EGFR transactivation and lung cancer proliferation was investigated. Addition of CCK-8 or gastrin-17 (100 nM) to NCI-H727 human lung cancer cells increased EGFR Tyr(1068) phosphorylation after 2 min. The ability of CCK-8 to cause EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation was blocked by CI-988, gefitinib (EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor), PP2 (Src inhibitor), GM6001 (matrix metalloprotease inhibitor), and tiron (superoxide scavenger). CCK-8 nonsulfated and gastrin-17 caused EGFR transactivation and bound with high affinity to NCI-H727 cells, suggesting that the CCK2R is present. CI-988 inhibited the ability of CCK-8 to cause ERK phosphorylation and elevate cytosolic Ca(2+). CI-988 or gefitinib inhibited the basal growth of NCI-H727 cells or that stimulated by CCK-8.

In this study, we found that the EGFR-TKI, gefitinib, modestly suppressed proliferation of the lung cancer cell lines, A549 and H358, which both harbor wild-type EGFR. Treatment with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) reduced the sensitivity to gefitinib, whereas sensitivity was restored by treatment with an HGF antibody, a MET inhibitor, or depletion of MET but not ErbB3 gene. Moreover, both PI3K/mTOR inhibitors and MEK inhibitors suppressed proliferation of A549 cells, whereas only PI3K/mTOR inhibitors effectively suppressed cell viability of EGFR mutant PC-9 cells. Our findings suggest that HGF reduced the gefitinib sensitivity through MET and downstream PI3K and MAPK pathways. Combined use of EGFR-TKI and MET inhibitors or inhibition of downstream signaling molecules might be a better second or third line choice for a group of patients with advanced lung cancer harboring wild-type EGFR.

We have developed a tamoxifen-resistant (TAM-R) MCF-7 breast cancer cell line to investigate the mechanisms behind this condition. Both epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and c-erbB2 mRNA and protein expression were increased in TAM-R compared with wild-type MCF-7 cells, whereas comparable levels of c-erbB3 mRNA and protein were expressed in both cell lines. Under basal conditions, phosphorylated EGFR/c-erbB2, EGFR/c-erbB3 but not c-erbB2/c-erbB3 receptor heterodimers were detected in TAM-R cells in association with increased levels of phosphorylated extracellular-signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). Both cell lines were capable of generating a range of EGFR-specific ligands and increased expression of transforming growth factor alpha was observed in TAM-R cells. Treatment of TAM-R cells with ZD1839 (Iressa) or trastuzumab (Herceptin) blocked c-erbB receptor heterodimer formation and phosphorylation, reduced ERK1/2 activity, and strongly inhibited cell growth. The MAPK kinase inhibitor PD098059 specifically reduced phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels and inhibited TAM-R growth. All three agents abolished ERK1/2 activity in wild-type cells but caused only small reductions in cell proliferation. These results demonstrate that TAM-R MCF-7 cell growth is mediated by the autocrine release and action of an EGFR-specific ligand inducing preferential EGFR/c-erbB2 dimerization and downstream activation of the ERK pathway.",

Interestingly, acquired resistance to erlotinib was also associated with the MAPK pathway activation as a result of CRAF or NRAS amplification.

With the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors that selectively target lung cancer-related epidermal growth factor receptor mutations, management of advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer has been greatly transformed. Improvements in progression-free survival and life quality of the patients were observed in numerous clinical studies. However, overall survival is not prolonged because of later-acquired drug resistance. Recent studies reveal a heterogeneous subclonal architecture of lung cancer, so it is speculated that the tumor may rapidly adapt to environmental changes via a Darwinian selection mechanism. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of both spatial and temporal tumor heterogeneity as potential mechanisms underlying epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance in nonsmall cell lung cancer and summarize the possible origins of tumor heterogeneity covering theories of cancer stem cells and clonal evolution, as well as genomic instability and epigenetic aberrations in lung cancer.

EGFR overexpression was found in 51 % of the tumors (24/47); in particular, EGFR overexpression occurred in mucoepidermoid (seven out of seven) and salivary duct carcinomas (9/12). Although EGFR amplification was not detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, increased copy number due to polysomy of chromosome 7, which houses EGFR, was observed in 4 of the 24 tumors with EGFR overexpression; this polysomy occurred most frequently in salivary duct carcinomas (three out of nine). HER2 overexpression was observed in 21 % (10/47) of all tumors; in these 10 tumors, HER2 gene amplification was found in seven cases. p-Akt was found in 51 % (24/47) of all tumors, most frequently in mucoepidermoid carcinomas (six out of seven). p-mTOR was found in 57 % of the latter (four out of seven). Consequently, different signaling cascades were found activated: (1) an EGFR/HER2(-Akt)-mTOR-dependent axis, with gene gains of HER2 and/or EGFR, activated in salivary duct carcinoma and carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma; (2) an EGFR(-Akt)-mTOR-dependent pathway activated in mucoepidermoid carcinoma or acinic cell carcinoma, without HER2 or EGFR gene alterations; and (3) an Akt-dependent pathway without EGFR/HER2 activation in other types.

One of them is epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling pathway that regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, angiogenesis and apoptosis. All these processes are deregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC). Moreover, EGFR has been validated as the therapeutic target in CRC, and monoclonal antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab are used in the therapy of patients with metastatic CRC. Because of the extensive involvement of miRNAs in the regulation of EGFR signalling, it seems they could also serve as promising predictive biomarkers to anti-EGFR therapy. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about miRNAs targeting EGFR signalling pathway, their functioning in CRC pathogenesis and potential usage as biomarkers. ",

The resulted EGFR-targeted SPV (ESPV) could efficiently encapsulate therapeutic cargos (drugs or small interfering RNAs [siRNAs]) or labelled fluorescent cargo (quantum dots [QDs]) and exhibited excellent affinity for EGFR-positive cancer cells.

The identification of new potential targets will ensure that the arsenal of cancer therapies continues to expand. FAM83B was recently discovered in a forward genetic screen for novel oncogenes that drive human mammary epithelial cell (HMEC) transformation. We report here that elevated FAM83B expression increases Phospholipase D (PLD) activity, and that suppression of PLD1 activity prevents FAM83B-mediated transformation. The increased PLD activity is engaged by hyperactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is regulated by an interaction involving FAM83B and EGFR. Preventing the FAM83B/EGFR interaction by site-directed mutation of lysine 230 of FAM83B suppressed PLD activity and MAPK signaling. Furthermore, ablation of FAM83B expression from breast cancer cells inhibited EGFR phosphorylation and suppressed cell proliferation. We propose that understanding the mechanism of FAM83B-mediated transformation will provide a foundation for future therapies aimed at targeting its function as an intermediary in EGFR, MAPK and mTOR activation.

But resistance has been observed in case of KRAS mutation. Inhibition of a single transduction pathway is often inefficient due to activation of alternative signalling. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key intracellular kinase integrating proliferation, survival and angiogenic pathways and has been implicated in the resistance to EGFR inhibitors. Thus, mTOR blockade is pursued to interfere at multiple levels with tumour growth.

        "Doc_abstract":"Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, has defined roles in neoplastic transformation and tumor progression. Overexpression of HER2 is an adverse prognostic factor in several human neoplasms and, particularly in breast cancer, correlates strongly with a decrease in overall patient survival. HER2 stimulates breast tumorigenesis by forming protein-protein interactions with a diverse array of intracellular signaling molecules, and evidence suggests that manipulation of these associations holds therapeutic potential. To modulate specific HER2 interactions, the region(s) of HER2 to which each target binds must be accurately identified. Calmodulin (CaM), a ubiquitously expressed Ca(2+) binding protein, interacts with multiple intracellular targets. Interestingly, CaM binds the juxtamembrane region of the epidermal growth factor receptor, a HER2 homolog. Here, we show that CaM interacts, in a Ca(2+)-regulated manner, with two distinct sites on the N-terminal portion of the HER2 intracellular domain. Deletion of residues 676-689 and 714-732 from HER2 prevented CaM-HER2 binding. Inhibition of CaM function or deletion of the CaM binding sites from HER2 significantly decreased both HER2 phosphorylation and HER2-stimulated cell growth. Collectively, these data suggest that inhibition of CaM-HER2 interaction may represent a rational therapeutic strategy for the treatment of patients with breast cancer.

The 5-year survival rates after curative surgical resection decline from 60-90% in stage I, to 30-50% in stage II and finally drop to only to 10-25% for patients in stage III of this disease. Surgical treatment is the only therapeutic modality that has a potentially curative effect. According to certain criteria, early gastric cancer limited to the mucosa or submucosa is indicated for endoscopic mucosal resection. In advanced gastric cancer with surgical approach, the questions of type of resection, extent of lymph node dissection and indication for splenectomy do arise. R0 resection represented with macroscopic- and microscopic-free resection margins is the ultimate goal for a surgeon. Chemotherapy is the treatment of choice in stage IV for unresectable disease. According to numerous randomized controlled trials, adjuvant chemotherapy versus chemoradiotherapy have been accepted for stages Ib-IIIb of this disease. Combination chemotherapy seems to be more effective than monotherapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is administered with the aim to downstage a locally advanced tumor prior to attempting curative resection. New therapeutic possibilities include agents like angiogenesis inhibitors, human epidermal growth factor receptor family inhibitors and inhibitors of small molecules (tyrosine kinase inhibitors). Survival rates in resectable gastric cancer are influenced mainly by the depth of invasion through the gastric wall and by the presence or absence of regional lymph node involvement.

But those with hepatic metastases may insensitive to EGFR-TKIs due to MET activation by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). In our retrospective analysis, 164 lung adenocarcinoma patients with known epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status who received the treatment of erlotinib as 2nd/3rd line setting were reviewed. The disease control rate (DCR) in patients without hepatic metastases group was higher than that in patients with hepatic metastases (66.1% vs 54.5%, p<0.001). In EGFR mutation-positive patients, median PFS was significantly longer in patients without hepatic metastases than that in those with hepatic metastases (9.9months 95% CI 7.74-12.06months vs. 7.9months 95% CI 5.88-9.92months; p=0.017).

Over the years, an increasing number of studies have reported on the crosstalk between EGFR and other receptors that can contribute to accelerated cancer development or even acquisition of resistance to anti-EGFR therapies. Combined targeting of EGFR and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) is a rational strategy to potentiate anti-cancer treatment and possibly retard resistance development. In the present study, we have pursued this by encapsulating the kinase inhibitor AG538 in anti-EGFR nanobody-liposomes. The thus developed dual-active nanobody-liposomes associated with EGFR-(over)expressing cells in an EGFR-specific manner and blocked both EGFR and IGF-1R activation, due to the presence of the EGFR-blocking nanobody EGa1 and the anti-IGF-1R kinase inhibitor AG538 respectively. AG538-loaded nanobody-liposomes induced a strong inhibition of tumor cell proliferation even upon short-term exposure followed by a drug-free wash-out period. Therefore, AG538-loaded nanobody-liposomes are a promising anti-cancer formulation due to efficient intracellular delivery of AG538 in combination with antagonistic and downregulating properties of the EGa1 nanobody-liposomes.",

We analyzed the ability of ZD1839 to induce apoptosis and/or inhibition of proliferation in breast carcinoma cell lines, as well any association between this ability and the downregulation activity of MAPK and Akt, two recently proposed markers of ZD1839 activity. Proliferation, survival, and activation of Akt and MAPK were evaluated in six human breast cancer cell lines expressing various levels of EGFR and HER2 and exposed to ZD1839. EGFR and HER2 expression levels were determined using specific monoclonal antibodies and FACS analysis. The effects of ZD1839 were independent of EGFR expression levels, but were influenced by high HER2 expression. ZD1839 significantly reduced the rate of [3H]-thymidine incorporation in the four sensitive cell lines, while apoptosis was also induced in two of these cell lines. No correlation was found between the cytostatic or cytotoxic effects of ZD1839 and its ability to downregulate MAPK and Akt activity in the tumor cell lines. Our data suggest that the antitumor activity of ZD1839 is due to a cytostatic effect, and involves apoptosis induction in a subset of sensitive cells only, and that neither MAPK nor Akt is a reliable marker of ZD1839 activity.",

We demonstrate here that an EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cell line, H1975 (L858R+T790M), has a subset of cells that exhibits an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype and can thrive in the presence of third-generation EGFR TKIs. These cells depend on not only autophagy but also on the isomerase Pin1 for survival in vitro, unlike their parental cells.

We demonstrated that 29% of DCIS, 40% of primary invasive breast cancers and 54% of metastatic lymph nodes express EGFRvIII by immunohistochemical analysis with two monoclonal antibodies. High levels of EGFRvIII expression were detected in about 5% of primary breast cancer and 27% of metastatic lymph-nodes. Furthermore, in the positive samples, the normal mammary gland exhibited negative staining for EGFRvIII, while the tumor cells were positive. The frequency of EGFRvIII expression correlated with breast cancer progression. We also showed that, despite the absence of gene amplification of EGFR in breast carcinoma cells, EGFRvIII was phosphorylated in breast cancer. In addition, approximately 40% of ErbB-2 positive primary breast tumors were found to co-express EGFRvIII. Even more striking is that 75% (3/4) of ErbB-2 positive metastatic lymph node specimens co-expressed with EGFRvIII. Co-expression of EGFRvIII with ErbB-2 in 32D cells amplified downstream signaling cascades and significantly enhanced tumorigenesis in vivo.

The mechanism of this resistance is unknown; however, we have recently shown that Met kinase activity compensates for loss of EGFR kinase activity in cell culture models. Met has been implicated in the pathogenesis of breast tumors and therefore may cooperate with EGFR for tumor growth. Here we have found that EGFR phosphorylation and cell proliferation is in part regulated by Met expression. In addition, we found that Met constitutive phosphorylation occurred independent of the Met ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Ligand-independent Met phosphorylation is mediated by Met amplification, mutation, or overexpression and by Met interaction with other cell surface molecules. In SUM229 breast cancer cells, we found that Met was not amplified or mutated, however it was overexpressed. Met overexpression did not directly correlate with ligand-independent Met phosphorylation as the SUM229 cell line was the only Met expressing breast cancer line with constitutive Met phosphorylation. Interestingly, Met expression did correlate with EGFR expression and we identified an EGFR/Met complex via co-immunoprecipitation. However, we only observed Met constitutive phosphorylation when c-Src also was part of this complex. Ligand-independent phosphorylation of Met was decreased by down regulating EGFR expression or by inhibiting c-Src kinase activity. Lastly, inhibiting EGFR and Met kinase activities resulted in a synergistic decrease in cell proliferation, supporting the idea that EGFR and Met functionally, as well as physically interact in breast cancer cells to regulate response to EGFR inhibitors.",

This study was done on 40 core liver biopsies from patients with CHC, 20 liver specimens from HCC cases on top of CHC as well as five normal controls. All were immunohistochemically stained with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and TGF-α antibodies. Some selected HCC cases were submitted for FISH technique to detect EGFR gene alteration. By immunohistochemistry EGFR and TGF-α were overexpressed in HCC and cirrhotic cases compared to CHC cases without cirrhosis. Also, their expression was stronger in CHC cases with higher grades of activity and stages of fibrosis compared to lower ones. FISH positive results for EGFR were detected in 33.3% of the examined HCC cases. EGFR and TGF-α can be used as predictive markers for activity, fibrosis, and carcinogenesis in CHC patients.

Several small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting EGFR have shown clinical efficacy in lung and colon cancers, but no benefit has been noted in breast cancer. Thirteen EGFR expressing breast cancer cell lines were analyzed for response to EGFR TKIs. Seven were found to be EGFR TKI resistant; while shRNA knockdown of EGFR determined that four of these cell lines retained the requirement of EGFR protein expression for growth. Interestingly, EGFR localized to plasma membrane lipid rafts in all four of these EGFR TKI-resistant cell lines, as determined by biochemical raft isolation and immunofluorescence. When lipid rafts were depleted of cholesterol using lovastatin, all four cell lines were sensitized to EGFR TKIs. In fact, the effects of the cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors and gefitinib were synergistic. While gefitinib effectively abrogated phosphorylation of Akt- and mitogen-activated protein kinase in an EGFR TKI-sensitive cell line, phosphorylation of Akt persisted in two EGFR TKI-resistant cell lines, however, this phosphorylation was abrogated by lovastatin treatment. Thus, we have shown that lipid raft localization of EGFR correlates with resistance to EGFR TKI-induced growth inhibition and pharmacological depletion of cholesterol from lipid rafts decreases this resistance in breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we have presented evidence to suggest that when EGFR localizes to lipid rafts, these rafts provide a platform to facilitate activation of Akt signaling in the absence of EGFR kinase activity.",

It was found that 13.8% of the cases were positive for erbB-3. Expression of erbB-3 was inversely correlated with EGFR and erbB-4 expression (P = .012 and P = .046). Expression of erbB-3 was correlated with positive estrogen and progesterone receptor status and inversely correlated with histologic grade. Expression of erbB-3 was correlated with longer disease-free survival (DFS; P = .028). Within the erbB-3-expressing group, there was a tendency for the coexpressing group to have shorter DFS compared with the single-expressing group. This study revealed that erbB-3 expression was associated with better prognosis. In an era of personalized targeted therapy, erbB-3 expression and its coexpressive pattern with other EGFR family members could be an important determinant for therapeutic plans for breast cancer treatment.",

One such target is the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a transmembrane protein that is frequently dysregulated in cancer cells and associated with the development, progression and aggressiveness of a number of malignancies. Inhibition of EGFR signaling has thus been identified as an attractive strategy in control of tumor proliferation, and over a decade of intense activity in the field has culminated in the discoveries and subsequent approvals of gefitinib and erlotinib for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. However, the drug's resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib has been clinically observed. Therefore, intensive efforts have been made in the discovery of novel potent and selective EGFR inhibitors. This review will focus on the developments of small molecule EGFR inhibitors based on the quinazoline core scaffolds in recent 5 years.

We developed a semi-automated high-content fluorescence microscopy-based EGFR endocytosis screen to identify proteins that mediate EGFR endocytosis in human HBL100 breast cancer cells. Knockdown of 172 individual endocytosis and actin-regulatory genes with small interfering RNAs led to the identification of 14 genes of which the contribution to EGFR endocytosis in breast cancer is until now poorly defined, including DNAJC6, GDI2, FGD6, HAX1, NECAP2 and AnxA2. We show that depletion of the actin and endocytosis regulatory protein annexin A2 (AnxA2) in a panel of four triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines affected EGFR endocytosis. Depletion of AnxA2 in the aggressive and highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 TNBC cell line resulted in the inhibition of EGFR transport beyond the early endosomes. This inhibition coincided with enhanced epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced cell migration and downstream signaling via c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and Akt. Moreover, AnxA2 knockdown increased lung metastasis formation in mice. The effect of AnxA2 knockdown on EGFR endocytosis in MDA-MB-231 was related to dephosphorylation/activation of the actin-severing protein cofilin, as re-expression of an inactive S3E-cofilin mutant, but not an active S3A-cofilin mutant, re-established EGFR endocytosis to control levels. Together, our data provide evidence for AnxA2 as a mediator of EGFR endocytosis and signaling in breast cancer via regulation of cofilin activation. ",

Immunohistochemistry revealed that EGFR protein is overexpressed in 53 (50%) of the 106 ESCC examined.

Because HER2 protein overexpression was observed in the primary tumor, he was treated with T-XP therapy. After 5 courses of treatment, the sizes of the primary tumor and multiple liver metastases were reduced on CT scans. In March 2013, a Billroth I distal gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection was performed. Liver metastasis was not detected. No residual cancer cells were found in the stomach or lymph nodes. The patient subsequently received oral administration of S-1 alone for 2 weeks followed by a 2-week rest period as 1 course. This was repeated for 19 courses. The postoperative course was uneventful, and there was no detectable liver metastasis 36 months after the original diagnosis. Therefore, T-XP therapy is an option for the management of HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer with liver metastasis.",

Despite many studies having suggested that overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a potent predictor of malignancy in cancers, systematic research of EGFR in multidrug resistant (MDR) breast cancer cells is lacking. In order to clarify the role of EGFR in MDR breast cancer cells, MCF7/Adr expressing relatively higher EGFR, and its parental cell line MCF7 expressing relatively lower EGFR, were chosen for this study. Knockdown of EGFR by siRNA in MCF7/Adr cells showed that EGFR siRNA inhibits cell migration, invasion and proliferation in vitro; converse effects were observed in MCF7 cells transfected with pcDNA3.0-EGFR plasmid. Moreover, we found that EGFR upregulated migration and invasion via EMMPRIN, MMP2 and MMP9 in addition to promoting cell cycle passage via elevation of cyclin D1 and CDK4 in MDR breast cancer cells. Interestingly, MCF7/Adr cells not expressing EGFR showed significant decrease of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and ABCG2 expression levels, and became more sensitive to treatment of adriamycin (ADR) and paclitaxel (Taxol); the above results indicated that MDR of cancer cells is related to S-phase arrest. In conclusion, EGFR is an important factor enhancing the malignancy of MDR breast cancer cells, partially, inducing MDR. Anti-EGFR therapy may improve outcome in chemorefractory breast cancer patients.",

Although epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapies have emerged as a promising therapeutic approach in patients with advanced typical NSCLC such as adenocarcinoma, the potential clinical activity of these drugs in lung SC is still unknown. To investigate this point, we have analyzed the status of 4 EGFR pathways biomarkers in a series of lung SC. EGFR protein expression, EGFR gene copy number, EGFR mutational status and KRAS mutational status were assessed in a series of 22 consecutive cases of primary lung SC. EGFR protein overexpression was observed in all the cases. High level of polysomy (>or=4 copies of the gene in >40% of cells) was detected in 5 cases (23%). No EGFR mutation was detected. KRAS mutations were found in 8 patients (38%; Gly12Cys in 6 cases and Gly12Val in 2 cases). The consistent EGFR protein overexpression and the high rate of KRAS mutation may contribute to the poorer outcome of lung SC in comparison with typical NSCLC. The rare incidence of increased EGFR gene copy number, the lack of EGFR mutation and the high rate of KRAS mutation observed in our series also suggest that most patients with lung SC are not likely to benefit from anti-EGFR therapies.",

At present, secondary resistance mechanisms associated with progression are better known: clonal selection of EGFR resistance mutation (T790M mutation in exon 20), amplification of transmembrane receptors for other growth factors (c-met, HER family, IGF1R, or AXL), downstream molecular alterations in EGFR signaling pathway (PI3K or PTEN), and epithelial-mesenchymal transition or transdifferentiation to small-cell cancer.

EGFR signaling is tightly regulated by receptor endocytosis and lysosome-mediated degradation, although the molecular mechanisms governing such regulation, particularly in the context of cancer, remain poorly delineated. Here, high-resolution genomic profiles of GBM identified a highly recurrent focal 1p36 deletion encompassing the putative tumor suppressor gene, Mig-6. We show that Mig-6 quells the malignant potential of GBM cells and dampens EGFR signaling by driving EGFR into late endosomes and lysosome-mediated degradation upon ligand stimulation. Mechanistically, this effect is mediated by the binding of Mig-6 to a SNARE protein STX8, a protein known to be required for late endosome trafficking. Thus, Mig-6 functions to ensure recruitment of internalized receptor to late endosomes and subsequently the lysosomal degradation compartment through its ability to specifically link EGFR and STX8 during ligand-stimulated EGFR trafficking. In GBM, the highly frequent loss of Mig-6 would therefore serve to sustain aberrant EGFR-mediated oncogenic signaling. Together, these data uncover a unique tumor suppression mechanism involving the regulation of receptor trafficking.",

We recently reported that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) induces resistance to EGFR-TKIs by activating the Met/PI3K pathway. HGF is also known to induce angiogenesis in cooperation with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is an important therapeutic target in lung cancer. Therefore, we hypothesized that dual inhibition of HGF and VEGF may be therapeutically useful for controlling HGF-induced EGFR-TKI-resistant lung cancer. We found that a dual Met/VEGF receptor 2 kinase inhibitor, E7050, circumvented HGF-induced EGFR-TKI resistance in EGFR mutant lung cancer cell lines by inhibiting the Met/Gab1/PI3K/Akt pathway in vitro. HGF stimulated VEGF production by activation of the Met/Gab1 signaling pathway in EGFR mutant lung cancer cell lines, and E7050 showed an inhibitory effect. In a xenograft model, tumors produced by HGF-transfected Ma-1 (Ma-1/HGF) cells were more angiogenic than vector control tumors and showed resistance to gefitinib. E7050 alone inhibited angiogenesis and retarded growth of Ma-1/HGF tumors. E7050 combined with gefitinib induced marked regression of tumor growth. Moreover, dual inhibition of HGF and VEGF by neutralizing antibodies combined with gefitinib also markedly regressed tumor growth. These results indicate the therapeutic rationale of dual targeting of HGF-Met and VEGF-VEGF receptor 2 for overcoming HGF-induced EGFR-TKI resistance in EGFR mutant lung cancer.",

Based on the observation that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitor PKI166 decreased RET/PTC kinase autophosphorylation and activation of downstream effectors in thyroid cells, despite lacking activity on the purified RET kinase, we proceeded to examine possible functional interactions between RET/PTC and EGFR. Conditional activation of RET/PTC oncoproteins in thyroid PCCL3 cells markedly induced expression and phosphorylation of EGFR, which was mediated in part through mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. RET and EGFR were found to coimmunoprecipitate. The ability of RET to form a complex with EGFR was not dependent on recruitment of Shc or on their respective kinase activities. Ligand-induced activation of EGFR resulted in phosphorylation of a kinase-dead RET, an effect that was entirely blocked by PKI166. These effects were biologically relevant, as the EGFR kinase inhibitors PKI166, gefitinib, and AEE788 inhibited cell growth induced by various constitutively active mutants of RET in thyroid cancer cells as well as NIH3T3 cells.

Nonetheless, improving therapeutic efficacy and patient survival is important, particularly in patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer.

The two antibodies bind to sub-domain IV of the receptor, but have non-overlapping epitopes, allowing them to simultaneously bind HER2. Treatment with 1E11 alone induced apoptosis in HER2-positive cancer cells, and this effect was enhanced by combination treatment with trastuzumab. Combination treatment with 1E11 and trastuzumab reduced the levels of total HER2 protein and those of aberrant HER2 signaling molecules including phosphorylated HER3 and EGFR.

Strikingly, the mice invariably developed multifocal lung adenocarcinomas of varying sizes at between 5 and 6 weeks of age, and they died from tumor progression approximately 2 months later if left untreated. Daily oral administration of the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) gefitinib (5 mg/kg/day) reduced the total and phosphorylation levels of EGFR to those in wild-type mouse lung tissue; in addition, it abrogated tumor growth within 1 week and prolonged survival to >30 weeks. Interestingly, phosphorylated ErbB2, ErbB3, and thyroid transcriptional factor-1 increased in the transgenic mice compared with those in wild-type mice. They might play some roles in tumors progression in the transgenic mice. This model will be useful for studying the mechanisms of carcinogenesis, chemoprevention, and acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs in lung cancer patients carrying activating EGFR mutations.",

Immunopositivity of C-KIT was common in adenoid cystic carcinoma (92%). Lack of C-KIT expression occurred in salivary duct carcinoma (P < 0.001) and was associated with high-grade tumours (P = 0.002), positive lymph nodes (P = 0.002) and high expression of Ki67 (P = 0.001). HER2 was typically expressed in salivary duct carcinomas (83%), but was not associated with any other parameter. EGFR overexpression occurred independently of histological type and clinical parameters. On univariate survival analysis, overexpression of EGFR (P = 0.011) and lack of C-KIT (P = 0.014) were associated with worse prognosis, whereas HER2 was of no prognostic significance. On multivariate analysis, the strongest negative predictor of survival was high proliferative activity measured by Ki67 (P = 0.002), followed by presence of residual tumour (P = 0.006), overexpression of EGFR (P = 0.026) and advanced tumour stage (P = 0.041).;The expression of receptor tyrosine kinases confers additional prognostic impact on disease-specific survival.

The possibility of these new molecules being used to treat patients without adenocarcinoma histology is notably small. For example, EGFR mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion gene rearrangement are rare in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (generally <1%). Additionally, the benefit of targeted treatment approaches in patients with small-cell lung cancer histology is limited.

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a member of the c-ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase family, is involved in regulation of epithelial cell growth and differentiation, and possible modulation of EGFR-dependent signaling by ONOO- was studied. Exposure of epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells to 0.1-1.0 mM ONOO- resulted in tyrosine nitration on EGFR and other proteins but did not significantly affect EGFR tyrosine autophosphorylation. A high molecular mass tyrosine-phosphorylated protein (approximately 340 kDa) was detected in A431 cell lysates after exposure to ONOO-, most likely representing a covalently dimerized form of EGFR, based on immunoprecipitation and/or immunoblotting with alpha-EGFR antibodies and co-migration with ligand-induced EGFR dimers cross-linked with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide. Covalent EGFR dimerization by ONOO- probably involved intermolecular dityrosine cross-linking and was enhanced after receptor activation with epidermal growth factor. Furthermore, irreversibly cross-linked EGFR was more extensively tyrosine-phosphorylated compared with the monomeric form, indicating that ONOO- preferentially cross-links activated EGFR. Exposure of A431 cells to ONOO- markedly reduced the kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation of a downstream EGFR substrate, phospholipase C-gamma1, which may be related to covalent alterations in EGFR. Alteration of EGFR signaling by covalent EGFR dimerization by inflammatory oxidants such as ONOO- may affect conditions of increased EGFR activation such as epithelial repair or tumorigenesis.",

In this study, we showed a novel signal transduction pathway using two human gastric cancer cell lines, MKN28 and MKN74. Both gastric cancer cells expressed leptin and its receptors (Ob-R) at the protein level. We found that leptin, even at as low as 0.1 ng/mL, induced significant tyrosine phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Time-course experiments revealed that phosphorylation was maximal after 5 minutes of stimulation and declined thereafter. We also revealed that tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR induced by leptin was significantly attenuated by two inhibitors, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, AG1478, and a broad-spectrum matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, GM6001. This indicates that the pathway of EGFR transactivation induced by leptin is dependent on proteolytically released EGFR ligands. Leptin induced JAK2 activation and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 activation in these gastric cancer cells, both of which occurred after the peak of EGFR transactivation. Pretreatment of gastric cancer cells with AG1478 significantly reduced the degree of phosphorylation of both JAK2 and ERK1/2. These findings indicate the involvement of EGFR transactivation in the activation of JAK2 and ERK1/2. Our results reveal that EGFR transactivation is involved in the leptin signaling pathway in gastric cancer cells, which extends the physiologic action of leptin beyond its central effects in the hypothalamus to regulate body weight.",

Human domain antibodies selected against VEGF and EGFR were formatted into a fully human dual-targeting IgG (DT-IgG) to directly target both antigens in a single molecule. We evaluated the efficacy of DT-IgG in comparison with bevacizumab and cetuximab alone and in combination in the lung cancer cell line A549 (low EGFR expression and KRAS mutant) and the head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell line Tu212 (high EGFR expression and KRAS wild type) in vitro and in vivo. DT-IgG suppressed Tu212 and A549 cell growth, inhibited EGFR activation and induced apoptosis as effectively as cetuximab, and neutralized VEGF as effectively as bevacizumab. DT-IgG induced EGFR-dependent VEGF internalization, constituting a novel antiangiogenesis mechanism. In xenograft models with lung and head and neck cancer cell lines, DT-IgG displayed efficacy equivalent to bevacizumab in diminishing tumor growth despite its short serum half-life (36 hr in rats) and both agents may constitute preferable alternatives to cetuximab in KRAS-mutant tumors. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that localization of DT-IgG was similar to that of cetuximab, largely associated with EGFR+tumor cells. Our proof of principle study suggests a DT-IgG against EGFR and VEGF as an alternative therapeutic strategy with potentially enhanced clinical benefit.",

To investigate the relation between the expression of EGFR and PCNA LI, we divided the patients into the following three groups according to the immunohistochemical findings: group A, EGFR (+); group B, EGFR (-), and EGF(+) or TGF alpha(+); group C, EGFR(-), EGF(-) and TGF alpha(-).

In the cancers invading subserosal layer or further, the frequency of metastasis in group A was over 78% and was not related to the PCNA range. In group B, metastasis was more frequent in high- and intermediate-PCNA tumors (about 80%) than in low-PCNA tumors (44%).

We identified subnetworks of proteins influencing resistance, with putative resistance determinants enriched among proteins that interacted with proteins at the core of the network. We found that clinically relevant drugs targeting proteins connected in the EGFR network, such as protein kinase C or Aurora kinase A, or the transcriptional regulator signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), synergized with EGFR antagonists to reduce cell viability and tumor size, suggesting the potential for a direct path to clinical exploitation.

In breast and colorectal cancer, polymorphisms in metabolic enzymes involved in tamoxifen and irinotecan therapies has led the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to address genetic factors relevant to patient consideration of treatment with these compounds. Tamoxifen therapeutic failure in breast cancer has been associated with reduced CYP2D6 activity due to inefficient activation of tamoxifen. Irinotecan toxicity in colorectal cancer is more common in patients with reduced-activity UGT1A alleles, resulting in excessive exposure to the potent SN-38 metabolite. In colorectal and lung cancers, somatic mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor and downstream signaling molecules have been associated with the therapeutic outcome of epidermal growth factor receptor-directed therapies. This review discusses the current knowledge regarding the utility of single gene-UGT1A1, CYP2D6, EGFR, and KRAS-or multigene analysis, for optimizing breast, colorectal, and lung cancer therapy.

To investigate these mechanisms, we established EGFR inhibitor-resistant clones from non-small cell lung cancer cells. A comparative analysis revealed that acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors was associated consistently with the loss of p53 and cross-resistance to radiation. To examine the role of p53, we first knocked down p53 in sensitive parental cells and found a reduction in sensitivity to both EGFR inhibitors and radiation. Conversely, restoration of functional p53 in EGFR inhibitor-resistant cells was sufficient to resensitize them to EGFR inhibitors or radiation in vitro and in vivo. Further studies indicate that p53 may enhance sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors and radiation via induction of cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA damage repair. Taken together, these findings suggest a central role of p53 in the development of acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors and prompt consideration to apply p53 restoration strategies in future clinical trials that combine EGFR inhibitors and radiation.",

We used a series of bioinformatics methods to analyze and integrate the functional genetics screen and RNA-seq data to identify a set of kinases that are critical in survival and proliferation in these TKI-resistant lines.

        "Doc_abstract":"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Several molecular pathways underlying mechanisms of this disease have been partly elucidated, among which the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway is one of the well-known signaling cascades that plays a critical role in tumorigenesis. The strategies to effectively inhibit EGFR signaling pathway have been used in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) targeted therapy. Patients with EGFR mutations benefit from EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) treatment. However, most of TKIs-treated patients eventually suffer drug resistant after 10-month treatments. MiRNAs (microRNAs) is a non coding RNA and protein involved in regulating gene expression in the transcription level. More and more studies have found that miRNAs are correlated with EGFR-TKIs secondary resistance. MiRNAs may serve as novel targets to circumvent the resistance and promising predictive biomarkers for EGFR-TKIs. In this paper, we reviewed briefly advanced research on miRNAs and EGFR-TKIs secondary resistance in NSCLC.;肺癌是癌症致死率最高的疾病，关于这个疾病的发生机制已得到部分阐明，其中表皮生长因子受体（epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFR）信号通路研究最为深入，在肺癌的发生中起着至关重要的作用。而有效地抑制EGFR信号通路的药物已用于非小细胞肺癌（non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC）的靶向治疗中，伴有EGFR基因突变的患者使用EGFR酪氨酸激酶抑制剂（EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, EGFR-TKIs）治疗后获得不错的临床收益，但大部分患者在使用该药治疗10个月后出现耐药现象。MiRNAs（microRNAs）是一种非编码蛋白的RNA，参与转录后水平基因的表达调控。越来越多的研究发现miRNAs与EGFR-TKIs继发性耐药有关，miRNAs可作为逆转EGFR-TKIs耐药及评估EGFR-TKIs有效性的生物指标。本文就NSCLC中miRNAs与EGFR-TKIs继发性耐药机制之间的相关性研究进展做简要的综述。.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Members of the EGFR/ErbB family of tyrosine kinases are found to be highly expressed and deregulated in many cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The ErbB family, including EGFR, has been demonstrated to play key roles in metastasis, tumorigenesis, cell proliferation, and drug resistance. Recently, these characteristics have been linked to a small subpopulation of cells classified as cancer stem cells (CSCs) which are believed to be responsible for tumor initiation and maintenance. In this study, we investigated the possible role of EGFR as a regulator of \"stemness\" in HNSCC cells. Activation of EGFR by the addition of EGF ligand or ectopic expression of EGFR in two established HNSCC cell lines (UMSCC-22B and HN-1) resulted in the induction of CD44, BMI-1, Oct-4, NANOG, CXCR4, and SDF-1. Activation of EGFR also resulted in increased tumorsphere formation, a characteristic ability of cancer stem cells. Conversely, treatment with the EGFR kinase inhibitor, Gefinitib (Iressa), resulted in decreased expression of the aforementioned genes, and loss of tumorsphere-forming ability. Similar trends were observed in a 99.9% CD44 positive stem cell culture derived from a fresh HNSCC tumor, confirming our findings for the cell lines. Additionally, we found that these putative cancer stem cells, when treated with Gefitinib, possessed a lower capacity to invade and became more sensitive to cisplatin-induced death in vitro. These results suggest that EGFR plays critical roles in the survival, maintenance, and function of cancer stem cells. Drugs that target EGFR, perhaps administered in combination with conventional chemotherapy, might be an effective treatment for HNSCC.",

Its expression and activation leads to cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Consistently, EGFR amplification or expression of EGFR variant 3 (EGFRvIII) is associated with resistance to conventional cancer therapy through activation of pro-survival signaling and DNA-repair mechanisms. EGFR targeting has successfully been exploited as strategy to increase treatment efficacy. Nevertheless, these targeting strategies have only been proven effective in a limited percentage of human tumors. Recent knowledge indicates that EGFR deregulated tumors display differences in autophagy and dependence on autophagy for growth and survival and the use of autophagy to increase resistance to EGFR-targeting drugs. In this review the dependency on autophagy and its role in mediating resistance to EGFR-targeting agents will be discussed. Considering the current knowledge, autophagy inhibition could provide a novel strategy to enhance therapy efficacy in treatment of EGFR deregulated tumors.",

In addition to modulation of mitogenic and motogenic behavior, emerging data identify EGFR activation as a novel mechanism for rapid modification of the cell surface proteome. The transmembrane collagenase membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP, MMP-14) is a major contributor to pericelluar proteolysis in the ovarian carcinoma microenvironment and is subjected to extensive posttranslational regulation. In the present study, the contribution of EGFR activation to control of MT1-MMP cell surface dynamics was investigated. Unstimulated ovarian cancer cells display caveolar colocalization of EGFR and MT1-MMP, whereas EGFR activation prompts internalization via distinct endocytic pathways. EGF treatment results in phosphorylation of the MT1-MMP cytoplasmic tail, and cells expressing a tyrosine mutated form of MT1-MMP (MT1-MMP-Y(573)F) exhibit defective MT1-MMP internalization. As a result of sustained cell surface MT1-MMP activity, a phenotypic epithelial-mesenchymal transition is observed, characterized by enhanced migration and collagen invasion, whereas growth within three-dimensional collagen gels is inhibited. These data support an EGFR-dependent mechanism for regulation of the transition between invasive and expansive growth of ovarian carcinoma cells via modulation of MT1-MMP cell surface dynamics.",

Recently, Kirsten ras (KRAS) status has emerged as a predictor of response to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeted therapies. In this article, we will discuss targeted therapies for colorectal cancers (CRC) based on EGFR signaling pathway and review published data about the potential usefulness of KRAS as a biological marker for response to these therapies. Results from relevant studies published since 2005 and unpublished results presented at national meetings were retrieved and summarized. These studies reflected response (or lack of response) to EGFR-targeted therapies in patients with metastatic CRC as a function of KRAS status. It has become clear that patients with colorectal cancer whose tumor has an activating mutation in KRAS do not respond to monoclonal antibody therapies targeting EGFR. It should now become a standard practice that any patients being considered for EGFR targeted therapies have their tumors tested for KRAS status and only those with wild-type KRAS being offered such therapies.",

Activating mutations at exon 19 and 21 of the EGFR gene are associated with the occurrence and development of lung adenocarcinoma. These gain of function mutations predict responsiveness to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKis), erlotinib or gefitinib and are also a favorable prognostic factor in lung cancer. Sequencing is the recommended technique to detect the mutations, but other more sensitive technics are under evaluation. Treatment as first line therapy by gefitinib is limited to lung cancer patients harboring an EGFR mutation. Erlotinib can be given regardless of the EGFR status as second or third line therapy, as well as maintenance therapy in patients with a stable disease after platinum based chemotherapy. In EGFR mutated tumors, most patients present a recurrence of the disease, despite an initial response on EGFR TKis. Two mechanisms of secondary resistance have been identified, the selection of the T790M mutation in EGFR exon 20 and the MET amplification. Other molecular anomalies as the ras mutations or the EMLA-ALK protein fusion are mutually exclusive with the EGFR mutations and are associated with primary resistance to EGFR TKis.",

We reported previously the development of targeted LPD (liposome-polycation-DNA complex) conjugated with anti-EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) Fab' (TLPD-FCC) for siRNA delivery, which showed superior gene silencing activity in EGFR-overexpressing breast cancers. However, TLPD-FCC did not achieve satisfactory gene silencing activity in EGFR-overexpressing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, some modifications including increased antibody conjugation efficiency and reduced PEGylation degree were made to TLPD-FCC to increase gene silencing activity in HCC. The resultant optimized liposomes denoted as TLPD-FP75 efficiently bound and delivered to EGFR-overexpressing HCC, resulting in enhanced gene silencing activity compared to untargeted LPD (NTLPD-FP75). Tissue distribution in vivo revealed that the accumulation of TLPD-FP75 was higher than NTLPD-FP75 in orthotopic HCC model of mice. The promoted uptake of TLPD-FP75 in HCC cells was confirmed by confocal microscopy. To investigate the in vivo gene silencing activity, we administered TLPD-FP75 by intravenous injections into mice bearing orthotopic HCC. The results showed TLPD-FP75 potently suppressed luciferase expression, while little silencing was observed in NTLPD-FP75.
