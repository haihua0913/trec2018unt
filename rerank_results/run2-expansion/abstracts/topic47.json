The PTEN gene (also called MMAC1 and TEP1) maps to chromosome region 10q23 and has been implicated as a target of alteration in gliomas and also in other cancers such as those of the breast, prostate, and kidney. Here we sought to provide a functional test of its candidacy as a growth suppressor in glioma cells. We used a combination of Northern blot analysis, protein truncation assays, and sequence analysis to determine the types and frequency of PTEN mutations in glioma cell lines so that we could define appropriate recipients to assess the growth suppressive function of PTEN by gene transfer. Introduction of wild-type PTEN into glioma cells containing endogenous mutant alleles caused growth suppression, but was without effect in cells containing endogenous wild-type PTEN. The ectopic expression of PTEN alleles, which carried mutations found in primary tumors and have been shown or are expected to inactivate its phosphatase activity, caused little growth suppression. These data strongly suggest that PTEN is a protein phosphatase that exhibits functional and specific growth-suppressing activity.",

        "Doc_abstract":"PTEN/MMAC1/TEP1 (PTEN, phosphatase deleted on chromosome ten; MMAC1, mutated in multiple advanced cancers; TEP1, tensin-like phosphatase) is a major human tumor suppressor gene whose suppressive activity operates on the phosphatidylinositol pathway. A single homologue of this gene, TEP1 (YNL128w), exists in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast strains deleted for TEP1 exhibit essentially no phenotype in haploids; however, diploids exhibit resistance to the phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate kinase inhibitor wortmannin and to lithium ions. Although rates of cancer increase with age, neither tep1 haploids nor diploids have altered life spans. TEP1 RNA is present throughout the cell cycle, and levels are dramatically up-regulated during meiotic development. Although homozygous tep1 mutants initiate the meiotic program and form spores with wild-type kinetics, analysis of the spores produced in tep1 mutants indicates a specific defect in the trafficking or deposition of dityrosine, a major component of yeast spore walls, to the surface. Introduction of a common PTEN mutation found in human tumors into the analogous position in Tep1p produces a nonfunctional protein based on in vivo activity. These studies implicate Tep1p in a specific developmental trafficking or deposition event and suggest that Tep1p, like its mammalian counterpart, impinges on the phosphatidylinositol pathway.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that men with a family history of prostate cancer are at an increased risk for this disease. This important observation has led a number of research teams, including our own, to collect DNA samples and clinical data from prostate cancer families, with the goal of localizing and characterizing prostate cancer susceptibility genes. The candidate tumor suppressor gene PTEN (also called MMAC1) has recently been shown to be somatically altered in several common malignancies, including cancers of the brain, kidney, skin, thyroid, endometrium, breast, and prostate. Germ-line mutations in this gene, which maps to chromosome 10q23, have been associated with Cowden disease, an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome that is characterized by multiple hamartomas. Although prostate cancer is not typically associated with Cowden disease, previous studies of sporadic prostate cancers demonstrate loss of heterozygosity at 10q23 loci in approximately 25% of cases. We, therefore, hypothesized that germ-line mutations in the PTEN gene may predispose to prostate cancer in a subset of families, particularly those in which cancers of the breast, kidney, and/or thyroid also segregate. To test this hypothesis, DNA was isolated from whole blood of 11 prostate cancer patients from 10 unrelated families. Four of the 10 families met the previously established clinical criteria for hereditary prostate cancer. Eight of the II men had at least one second primary malignancy, including cases of neuroendocrine cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, melanoma, kidney, and thyroid cancer. Although we identified some common as well as some unique polymorphisms, no nonsense or missense mutations were identified in any of the 11 samples. To further examine the possibility that PTEN mutations contribute to prostate cancer predisposition, we also studied the probands from each of 10 families with early-onset and/or multiple individuals with prostate cancer. Sequence analysis of the PTEN gene in these 10 men also revealed no mutations or novel polymorphisms. We conclude that germ-line mutations in the PTEN are unlikely to contribute in a significant way to the inherited predisposition to prostate cancer.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Germline mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene PTEN (MMAC1, TEP1) are found in Cowden syndrome, which predisposes to hamartomas, breast cancer, trichilemmomas, and thyroid tumors of follicular epithelium. PTEN has also been found to be somatically deleted, mutated, and/or silenced in various sporadically occurring cancers such as glioblastoma, breast cancer, kidney cancer, malignant melanoma, and endometrial cancer. Loss or reduction of PTEN protein expression as well as inappropriate subcellular compartmentalization is seen in non-medullary thyroid cancers. However, although allelic loss of the PTEN locus in 10q23.3 is frequently seen, this is not coupled with mutations in the PTEN gene. To approach further the frequency and mechanism behind PTEN silencing, we screened a panel of 87 sporadic thyroid tumors for PTEN mRNA expression, including 14 anaplastic carcinomas, 37 follicular carcinomas, 21 atypical adenomas, and 15 ordinary adenomas. Complete loss of PTEN mRNA expression was evident in six of the tumors, including four anaplastic carcinomas, one widely invasive carcinoma, and one ordinary adenoma. The transcriptional silencing of PTEN was significantly associated with the anaplastic subtype, suggesting that PTEN is involved in the carcinogenesis of highly malignant or late-stage thyroid cancers, whereas this particular mechanism appears to be of minor importance in differentiated follicular thyroid tumors. No association was observed between the expression, loss of heterozygosity, and mutation status in the 33 cases in which these parameters were compared. This indicates that PTEN silencing is a result of a wide variety of epigenetic and/or structural silencing mechanisms rather than a consequence of structural biallelic inactivation of the classical type. Furthermore, the high rate of alterations in the 10q23 region might indicate the presence of an as-yet unknown tumor-suppressor gene with an important role in the development of thyroid tumors.",

To study this link, the POET3 mouse, an inducible model of prostatitis, was crossed with a Pten-loss model of prostate cancer (Pten(+/-)) containing the ROSA26 luciferase allele to monitor prostate size. Prostatitis was induced, and prostate bioluminescence was tracked over 12 months, with lesion development, inflammation, and cytokine expression analyzed at 4, 8, and 12 months and compared with mice without induction of prostatitis. Acute prostatitis led to more proliferative epithelium and enhanced bioluminescence. However, 4 months after initiation of prostatitis, mice with induced inflammation had lower grade pre-neoplastic lesions. A trend existed toward greater development of carcinoma 12 months after induction of inflammation, including one of two mice with carcinoma developing perineural invasion. Two of 18 mice at the later time points developed lesions with similarities to proliferative inflammatory atrophy, including one mouse with associated carcinoma. Pten(+/-) mice developed spontaneous inflammation, and prostatitis was similar among groups of mice at 8 and 12 months. Analyzed as one cohort, lesion number and grade were positively correlated with prostatitis. Specifically, amounts of CD11b(+)Gr1(+) cells were correlated with lesion development. These results support the hypothesis that myeloid-based inflammation is associated with lesion development in the murine prostate, and previous bouts of CD8-driven prostatitis may promote invasion in the Pten(+/-) model of cancer.

Inactivation of the tumor-suppressor gene PTEN and lack of p27(KIP1) expression have been detected in most advanced prostate cancers. But mice deficient for Cdkn1b (encoding p27(Kip1)) do not develop prostate cancer. PTEN activity leads to the induction of p27(KIP1) expression, which in turn can negatively regulate the transition through the cell cycle. Thus, the inactivation of p27(KIP1) may be epistatic to PTEN in the control of the cell cycle. Here we show that the concomitant inactivation of one Pten allele and one or both Cdkn1b alleles accelerates spontaneous neoplastic transformation and incidence of tumors of various histological origins. Cell proliferation, but not cell survival, is increased in Pten(+/-)/Cdkn1b(-/-) mice. Moreover, Pten(+/-)/Cdkn1b(-/-) mice develop prostate carcinoma at complete penetrance within three months from birth. These cancers recapitulate the natural history and pathological features of human prostate cancer.

PTEN loss was not significantly associated with biochemical recurrence (hazard ratio 2.1, 95% confidence interval 0.9-5.1, P = 0.10), but significantly predicted increased risk of castration-resistant prostate cancer, metastasis and prostate cancer-specific mortality (all log-rank, P < 0.0001), and time from androgen deprivation therapy to castration-resistant prostate cancer (log-rank, P = 0.003). No patient without PTEN loss developed metastases or died from prostate cancer.;PTEN loss at the time of biopsy seems to predict time to development of metastasis, prostate cancer-specific mortality and, for the first time, castration-resistant prostate cancer and response to androgen deprivation therapy after radical prostatectomy. If confirmed by larger studies, this would support the use of PTEN loss as an early marker of aggressive prostate cancer.",

Since Pten/Trp53 double conditional knockout mice show earlier onset and fast progression of prostate cancer when compared to Pten knockout mice, we asked whether heterozygosity of these two tumor suppressor genes was sufficient to accelerate prostatic tumorigenesis. To answer this question we examined prostatic lesion progression of Pten/Trp53 double heterozygous mice and a series of controls such as Pten heterozygous, Pten conditional knockout, Trp53 heterozygous and Trp53 knockout mice. Tissue recombination of adult prostatic epithelium coupled with embryonic rat seminal vesicle mesenchyme was used as a tool to stimulate prostatic epithelial proliferation. In our study, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) was found with high frequency at 8 weeks post-tissue recombination transplantation. PIN lesions in Pten/Trp53 double heterozygous mice were more severe than those seen in Pten heterozygous alone. Furthermore, morphologic features attributable to Pten or Trp53 loss appeared to be enhanced in double heterozygous tissues. LOH analysis of Pten and Trp53 in genomic DNA collected from high-grade PIN lesions in Pten heterozygous and Pten/Trp53 double heterozygous mice showed an intact wild-type allele for both genes in all samples examined. In conclusion, simultaneous heterozygosity of Pten and Trp53 accelerates prostatic tumorigenesis in this mouse model of prostate cancer independently of loss of heterozygosity of either gene.",

In keeping with its role as a pivotal upstream regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway, experimentally-induced deletion of Pten in the murine prostate invariably results in neoplasia. However, and unlike humans where prostate tumorigenesis likely evolves over decades, disease progression in the constitutively Pten deficient mouse prostate is relatively rapid, culminating in invasive cancer within several weeks post-puberty. Given that the prostate undergoes rapid androgen-dependent growth at puberty, and that Pten excisions during this time might be especially tumorigenic, we hypothesized that delaying prostate-specific Pten deletions until immediately after puberty might alter the pace of tumorigenesis. To this end we generated mice with a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase transgene enabling temporal control over prostate-specific gene alterations. This line was then interbred with mice carrying floxed Pten alleles. Despite evidence of increased Akt/mTOR/S6K axis activity at early time points in Pten-deficient epithelial cells, excisions induced in the post-pubertal (6 wk-old) prostate yielded gradual acquisition of a range of lesions. These progressed from pre-malignant changes (nuclear atypia, focal hyperplasia) and low grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) at 16-20 wks post-tamoxifen exposure, to overtly malignant lesions by approximately 1 yr of age, characterized by high-grade PIN and microinvasive carcinoma. In contrast, when Pten excisions were triggered in the pre-pubertal (2 week-old) prostate, neoplasia evolved over a more abbreviated time-frame, with a spectrum of premalignant lesions, as well as overt PIN and microinvasive carcinoma by 10-12 wks post-tamoxifen exposure. These results indicate that the developmental stage at which Pten deletions are induced dictates the pace of PIN development.",

In this study, we investigated this possibility by genetically deleting Sox4 in a mouse model of prostate cancer initiated by loss of the tumor suppressor Pten. We found that specific homozygous deletion of Sox4 in the adult prostate epithelium strongly inhibited tumor progression initiated by homozygous loss of Pten. Mechanistically, Sox4 ablation reduced activation of AKT and β-catenin, leading to an attenuated invasive phenotype. Furthermore, SOX4 expression was induced by Pten loss as a result of the activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling, suggesting a positive feedback loop between SOX4 and PI3K-AKT-mTOR activity.

To examine the possible significance of alterations associated with the tumor suppressor gene, MMAC/PTEN, in prostate carcinoma, the biological and biochemical effects of MMAC/PTEN expression were examined in LNCaP cells, which are devoid of a functional gene product. Acute expression of MMAC/PTEN via an adenoviral construct resulted in a dose-dependent and specific inhibition of Akt/PKB activation, consistent with the phosphatidylinositol phosphatase activity of MMAC/PTEN. MMAC/PTEN expression induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells, although to a lesser extent than that observed with p53 via an adenoviral construct. However, MMAC/PTEN expression produced a growth inhibition that was significantly greater than that achieved with p53. Overexpression of Bcl-2 in LNCaP cells blocked MMAC/PTEN- and p53-induced apoptosis but not the growth-suppressive effects of MMAC/ PTEN, suggesting that the growth regulatory effects of MMAC/PTEN involve multiple pathways.

Our previous works suggest that although precancerous lesions were found in Pten heterozygous mice, cancer progression and metastasis only happened when both alleles of Pten were deleted. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of PTEN in prostate cancer control, we generated two pairs of isogenic, androgen receptor (AR)-positive prostate epithelial lines from intact conditional Pten knock-out mice that are either heterozygous (PTEN-P2 and -P8) or homozygous (PTEN-CaP2 and PTEN-CaP8) for Pten deletion. Further characterization of these cells showed that loss of the second allele of Pten leads to increased anchorage-independent growth in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo without obvious structural or numerical chromosome changes based on SKY karyotyping analysis. Despite no prior exposure to hormone ablation therapy, Pten null cells are tumorigenic in both male and female severe combined immunodeficiency mice. Furthermore, knocking down PTEN can convert the androgen-dependent Myc-CaP cell into androgen independence, suggesting that PTEN intrinsically controls androgen responsiveness, a critical step in the development of hormone refractory prostate cancer. Importantly, knocking down AR by shRNA in Pten null cells reverses androgen-independent growth in vitro and partially inhibited tumorigenesis in vivo, indicating that PTEN-controlled prostate tumorigenesis is AR dependent. These cell lines will serve as useful tools for understanding signaling pathways controlled by PTEN and elucidating the molecular mechanisms involved in hormone refractory prostate cancer formation.",

This finding was confirmed in human prostate cancer cells in which PTEN expression was abolished by RNA interference-mediated attenuation. These results were consistent with clinical evidence that the expression of p300 and AR correlates positively in human prostate cancer specimens. Mechanistically, PTEN inactivation increased AR phosphorylation at serine 81 (Ser81) to promote p300 binding and acetylation of AR, thereby precluding its polyubiquitination and degradation. In support of these findings, in PTEN-deficient prostate cancer in the mouse, we found that p300 was crucial for AR target gene expression.

An integrated analysis of PTEN loss was, therefore, performed for structural variations, point mutations and protein expression in clinically insignificant (48 cases) and significant (76 cases) prostate cancers treated by radical prostatectomy. Whole-genome mate pair sequencing was performed on tumor cells isolated by laser capture microdissection to characterize PTEN structural alterations. Fluorescence in situ hybridization probes were constructed from the sequencing data to detect the spectrum of these PTEN alterations. PTEN loss by mate pair sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization occurred in 2% of insignificant, 13% of large volume Gleason score 6, and 46% of Gleason score 7 and higher cancers. In Gleason score 7 cancers with PTEN loss, PTEN alterations were detected in both Gleason pattern 3 and 4 in 57% of cases by mate pair sequencing, 75% by in situ hybridization and 86% by immunohistochemistry.

In addition, germline mutation of PTEN is responsible for two dominantly inherited, related cancer syndromes called Cowden disease and Bannayan-Ruvalcaba-Riley syndrome [4]. PTEN encodes a dual-specificity phosphatase that inhibits cell spreading and migration partly by inhibiting integrin-mediated signalling [5] [6] [7]. Furthermore, PTEN regulates the levels of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) by specifically dephosphorylating position 3 on the inositol ring [8]. We report here that the dauer formation gene daf-18 is the Caenorhabditis elegans homologue of PTEN. DAF-18 is a component of the insulin-like signalling pathway controlling entry into diapause and adult longevity that is regulated by the DAF-2 receptor tyrosine kinase and the AGE-1 PI 3-kinase [9]. Others have shown that mutation of daf-18 suppresses the life extension and constitutive dauer formation associated with daf-2 or age-1 mutants. Similarly, we show that inactivation of daf-18 by RNA-mediated interference mimics this suppression, and that a wild-type daf-18 transgene rescues the dauer defect. These results indicate that PTEN/daf-18 antagonizes the DAF-2-AGE-1 pathway, perhaps by catalyzing dephosphorylation of the PIP3 generated by AGE-1. These data further support the notion that mutations of PTEN contribute to the development of human neoplasia through an aberrant activation of the PI 3-kinase signalling cascade.",

In contrast to its role in other developing organs, this gene is dispensable for the initial developmental processes such as budding and branching. However, as cytodifferentiation progresses, abnormal luminal cells fill the ductal lumens together with augmented epithelial proliferation. This phenotype resembles the hyperplasia seen in postnatal Pten deletion models that develop neoplasia at later stages. Consistent with this, gene expression analysis showed a number of genes affected that are shared with Pten mutant prostate cancer models, including a decrease in androgen receptor regulated genes. In depth analysis of the phenotype of these mice during development revealed that loss of Pten leads to the precocious differentiation of epithelial cells towards a luminal cell fate.

Promoter hypermethylation has recently been identified as an alternative mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in cancer, but its importance in the PTEN gene in endometrial carcinoma is unknown. The purpose of our study was to assess the frequency of promoter methylation of the PTEN gene and to determine its correlation with clinicopathologic variables in a prospective and population-based series of endometrial carcinomas with complete follow-up. Presence of PTEN promoter methylation was seen in 26 of 138 patients (19%). Methylation was significantly associated with metastatic disease (p = 0.01) and a microsatellite unstable phenotype (p = 0.006). In conclusion, we find that PTEN promoter methylation is relatively frequent in endometrial carcinoma.

PTEN and TP53 contribute to the regulation of self-renewal and differentiation in prostate progenitors, presumptive tumor initiating cells for prostate cancer. Here we characterize the transformed phenotypes resulting from deletion of the Pten and TP53 tumor suppressors in prostate epithelium. Using the PB-Cre4(+)Pten(fl/fl)TP53(fl/fl) model of prostate cancer, we describe the histological and metastatic properties of primary tumors, transplanted primary tumor cells, and clonal cell lines established from tumors. Adenocarcinoma was the major primary tumor type that developed, which progressed to lethal sarcomatoid carcinoma at approximately 6 months of age. In addition, basal carcinomas and prostatic urothelial carcinomas were observed. We show that tumor heterogeneity resulted, at least in part, from the transformation of multipotential progenitors. CK8+ luminal epithelial cells were capable of undergoing epithelial to mesenchymal transition in vivo to sarcomatoid carcinomas containing osseous metaplasia. Metastasis rarely was observed from primary tumors, but metastasis to lung and lymph nodes occurred frequently from orthotopic tumors initiated from a biphenotypic clonal cell line. Androgen deprivation influenced the differentiated phenotypes of metastases. These data show that one functional consequence of Pten/TP53 loss in prostate epithelium is lineage plasticity of transformed cells.",

Building upon insights gained from our studies with Pten-/p53-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), we report here that hexokinase 2 (HK2) is selectively upregulated by the combined loss of Pten and p53 in prostate cancer cells. Mechanistically, Pten deletion increases HK2 mRNA translation through the activation of the AKT-mTORC1-4EBP1 axis, and p53 loss enhances HK2 mRNA stability through the inhibition of miR143 biogenesis. Genetic studies demonstrate that HK2-mediated aerobic glycolysis, known as the Warburg effect, is required for Pten-/p53-deficiency-driven tumor growth in xenograft mouse models of prostate cancer.

However, expression studies on human prostate cancer samples are unclear on the role this protein plays in this disease. We have used in vivo genetic studies in the embryo and adult to extend our understanding of the role of β-Catenin in the normal and neoplastic prostate. Our gene deletion analysis revealed that prostate epithelial β-Catenin is required for embryonic prostate growth and branching but is dispensable in the normal adult organ. During development, β-Catenin controls the number of progenitors in the epithelial buds and regulates a discrete network of genes, including c-Myc and Nkx3.1. Deletion of β-Catenin in a Pten deleted model of castration-resistant prostate cancer demonstrated it is dispensable for disease progression in this setting. Complementary overexpression experiments, through in vivo protein stabilization, showed that β-Catenin promotes the formation of squamous epithelia during prostate development, even in the absence of androgens. β-Catenin overexpression in combination with Pten loss was able to drive progression to invasive carcinoma together with squamous metaplasia. These studies demonstrate that β-Catenin is essential for prostate development and that an inherent property of high levels of this protein in prostate epithelia is to drive squamous fate differentiation. In addition, they show that β-Catenin overexpression can promote invasive prostate cancer in a clinically relevant model of this disease. These data provide novel information on cancer progression pathways that give rise to lethal prostate disease in humans.",

To provide insight into the role of PTEN mutations in prostate cancer, we used microarrays to identify genes regulated by FKHRL1 and FKHR in LAPC4 prostate carcinoma cells. These studies revealed that adenoviral overexpression of FKHRL1 and FKHR in the LAPC4 prostate cancer cell line resulted in apoptosis and induced the expression of many genes that affect cellular proliferation or survival. The expression of one of these FOXO-regulated genes, TRAIL, a pro-apoptotic member of the tumor necrosis factor family, was decreased in human metastatic prostate tumors. The altered expression of TRAIL in these tumors correlated directly with decreased PTEN expression and the resultant loss of FKHRL1 and FKHR activity. Analysis of the effects of FOXO proteins on the TRAIL promoter localized the FKHRL1 responsive element of the TRAIL promoter to nucleotides -138 to -121 and demonstrated that TRAIL is a direct target of FKHRL1. These findings suggest that the decreased activity of FKHRL1 and FKHR in prostate cancers resulting from loss of PTEN leads to a decrease in TRAIL expression that may contribute to increased survival of the tumor cells.",

This aberration leads to the ectopic activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway, which promotes tumor growth. Here, we show that the transcription factor Gata3 is progressively lost in Pten-deficient mouse prostate tumors as a result of both transcriptional down-regulation and increased proteasomal degradation. To determine the significance of this loss, we used conditional loss- and gain-of-function approaches to manipulate Gata3 expression levels in prostate tumors. Our results show that Gata3 inactivation in Pten-deficient prostates accelerates tumor invasion. Conversely, enforced expression of GATA3 in Pten-deficient tissues markedly delays tumor progression. In Pten-deficient prostatic ducts, enforced GATA3 prevented Akt activation, which correlated with the down-regulation of Pik3cg and Pik3c2a mRNAs, encoding respectively class I and II PI3K subunits. Remarkably, the majority of human prostate tumors similarly show loss of active GATA3 as they progress to the aggressive castrate-resistant stage. In addition, GATA3 expression levels in hormone-sensitive tumors holds predictive value for tumor recurrence.

Robust ERG-mediated transcriptional changes, observed only in the setting of Pten loss, included the restoration of AR transcriptional output and upregulation of genes involved in cell death, migration, inflammation and angiogenesis. Similarly, ETS variant 1 (ETV1) positively regulated the AR cistrome and transcriptional output in ETV1-translocated, PTEN-deficient human prostate cancer cells. In two large clinical cohorts, expression of ERG and ETV1 correlated with higher AR transcriptional output in PTEN-deficient prostate cancer specimens.

Loss of heterozygosity at PTEN was found in only two cases both by microsatellite analysis and quantitative Southern blotting.

Further, immunohistochemistry revealed significant correlation of decreased PTEN protein expression with PTEN genomic deletion both in localized and metastatic cancer. Of note, ERG aberration, but not PTEN deletion, was consistently identical both in localized cancer and adjacent HGPIN. Similarly, whereas all metastases (41/41, 100%) shared the same ERG status across multiple sites from the same patient, 5% (2/41) of cases showed discordance for PTEN deletion status across multiple sites.

Bioluminescence signal increased rapidly in Pten(p-/-) mice from 3 to 11 weeks, but was much slower from 11 to 52 weeks. Changes in bioluminescence signal were correlated with epithelial proliferation. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed progressive increases in prostate volume, which were attributed to excessive fluid retention in the anterior prostate and to expansion of the stroma. Development of invasive prostate cancer in 52-week-old Pten(p-/-) mice was rare, indicating that disease progression was slowed relative to that in previous reports. Tumors in these mice exhibited a spontaneous inflammatory phenotype and were rapidly infiltrated by myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Although Pten(p-/-) tumors responded to androgen withdrawal, they failed to exhibit relapsed growth for up to 1 year.

Monoallelic Pten deletion in mice causes low prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN). This study tested the effect of a hypercaloric diet on prostate cancer in Pten (+/-) mice.;1-month old mice were fed a high-calorie diet deriving 45% calories from fat for 3 and 6 months before prostate was analyzed histologically and biochemically for mPIN progression. Because Pten (+/-) mice are protected against diet-induced insulin resistance, we tested the role of insulin on cell growth in RWPE-1 normal human prostatic epithelial cells with siRNA knockdown of PTEN.;In addition to activating PI3 kinase/Akt and Ras/MAPkinase pathways, high-calorie diet causes neoplastic progression, angiogenesis, inflammation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. It also elevates the expression of fatty acid synthase (FAS), a lipogenic gene commonly elevated in progressive cancer. SiRNA-mediated downregulation of PTEN demonstrates increased cell growth and motility, and soft agar clonicity in addition to elevation in FAS in response to insulin in RWPE-1 normal human prostatic cells. Downregulating FAS in addition to PTEN, blunted the proliferative effect of insulin (and IL-6) in RWPE-1 cells.;High-calorie diet promotes prostate cancer progression in the genetically susceptible Pten haploinsufficient mouse while preserving insulin sensitivity. This appears to be partly due to increased inflammatory response to high-caloric intake in addition to increased ability of insulin to promote lipogenesis.",

Given that mice deficient in ERβ do not develop prostate cancer, we hypothesized that ERβ loss occurs as a consequence of tumorigenesis caused by other oncogenic mechanisms and that its loss is necessary for tumorigenesis. In support of this hypothesis, we found that ERβ is targeted for repression in prostate cancer caused by PTEN deletion and that loss of ERβ is important for tumor formation. ERβ transcription is repressed by BMI-1, which is induced by PTEN deletion and important for prostate tumorigenesis. This finding provides a mechanism for how ERβ expression is regulated in prostate cancer. Repression of ERβ contributes to tumorigenesis because it enables HIF-1/VEGF signaling that sustains BMI-1 expression.

PTEN-regulated genes were disproportionately represented among genes altered in human prostate cancer progression and metastasis but not among those associated with tumorigenesis. From the former set, we identified two novel putative PTEN targets, cdc6 and cyclin E2, which were overexpressed in metastatic human prostate cancer and up-regulated as a function of PTEN depletion in poorly metastatic DU145 human prostate cancer cells harboring a wild type PTEN. Inhibition of cdc6 and cyclin E2 levels as a consequence of PTEN expression was associated with cell cycle G(1) arrest, whereas use of PTEN activity mutants revealed that regulation of these genes was dependent on PTEN lipid phosphatase activity. Computational and promoter-reporter evaluations implicated the E2F transcription factor in PTEN regulation of cdc6 and cyclin E2 expression.

The Pten conditional knockout mice [(Pten-loxp/loxp:PB-Cre4(+)) (Pten-KO)] provide a unique preclinical model to evaluate agents for efficacy for both the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer. We present here for the first time that dietary plumbagin, a medicinal plant-derived naphthoquinone (200 or 500 ppm) inhibits tumor development in intact as well as castrated Pten-KO mice. Plumbagin has shown no signs of toxicity at either of these doses. Plumbagin treatment resulted in a decrease expression of PKCε, AKT, Stat3, and COX2 compared with the control mice. Plumbagin treatment also inhibited the expression of vimentin and slug, the markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in prostate tumors. In summary, the results indicate that dietary plumbagin inhibits growth of both primary and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in Pten-KO mice, possibly via inhibition of PKCε, Stat3, AKT, and EMT markers (vimentin and slug), which are linked to the induction and progression of prostate cancer.",

NVP-BEZ235 selectively induced apoptotic cell death in the prostate cancer cell line DU145, which harbors wild-type PTEN; however, in the PC3 cell line, which is PTEN-null, treatment with NVP-BEZ235 resulted in autophagic cell death. Consistently, NVP-BEZ235 treatment did not result in the cleavage of caspase-3; instead, it resulted in the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, indicating autophagic cell death; these results suggest that an alternate mechanism of cell death is induced by NVP-BEZ235 in PTEN-null prostate cancer cells.

Somatic copy number alterations (CNA) are found in most aggressive primary human prostate cancers, and the overall number of such changes is increased in metastases. Chromosome 10q23 deletions, encompassing PTEN, and amplification of 8q24, harboring MYC, are frequently observed, and the presence of both together portends a high risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality. In extant genetically engineered mouse prostate cancer models (GEMM), isolated MYC overexpression or targeted Pten loss can each produce early prostate adenocarcinomas, but are not sufficient to induce genetic instability or metastases with high penetrance. Although a previous study showed that combining Pten loss with focal MYC overexpression in a small fraction of prostatic epithelial cells exhibits cooperativity in GEMMs, additional targeted Tp53 disruption was required for formation of metastases. We hypothesized that driving combined MYC overexpression and Pten loss using recently characterized Hoxb13 transcriptional control elements that are active in prostate luminal epithelial cells would induce the development of genomic instability and aggressive disease with metastatic potential. Neoplastic lesions that developed with either MYC activation alone (Hoxb13-MYC) or Pten loss alone (Hoxb13-Cre∣Pten(Fl/Fl)) failed to progress beyond prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and did not harbor genomic CNAs. By contrast, mice with both alterations (Hoxb13-MYC∣Hoxb13-Cre∣Pten(Fl/Fl), hereafter, BMPC mice) developed lethal adenocarcinoma with distant metastases and widespread genome CNAs that were independent of forced disruption of Tp53 and telomere shortening. BMPC cancers lacked neuroendocrine or sarcomatoid differentiation, features uncommon in human disease but common in other models of prostate cancer that metastasize. These data show that combined MYC activation and Pten loss driven by the Hoxb13 regulatory locus synergize to induce genomic instability and aggressive prostate cancer that phenocopies the human disease at the histologic and genomic levels.",

Several large scale tissue microarray studies have revealed that the expression of some Notch signaling components including the Jagged1 ligand are upregulated in advanced human prostate cancer specimens. Jagged1 expressed by tumor cells may activate Notch signaling in both adjacent tumor cells and cells in tumor microenvironment. However, it remains undetermined whether increased Jagged1 expression reflects a cause for or a consequence of tumor progression in vivo. To address this question, we generated a novel R26-LSL-JAG1 mouse model that enables spatiotemporal Jagged1 expression. Prostate specific upregulation of Jagged1 neither interferes with prostate epithelial homeostasis nor significantly accelerates tumor initiation or progression in the prostate-specific Pten deletion mouse model for prostate cancer. However, Jagged1 upregulation results in increased inflammatory foci in tumors and incidence of intracystic adenocarcinoma. In addition, Jagged1 overexpression upregulates Tgfβ signaling in prostate stromal cells and promotes progression of a reactive stromal microenvironment in the Pten null prostate cancer model. Collectively, Jagged1 overexpression does not significantly accelerate prostate cancer initiation and progression in the context of loss-of-function of Pten, but alters tumor histopathology and microenvironment. Our study also highlights an understudied role of Notch signaling in regulating prostatic stromal homeostasis.Oncogene advance online publication, 27 June 2016; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.232.",

During this process, the effects of a specific mutation on the incipient cancer cell may dictate the nature of subsequent mutations that can be tolerated or selected for, affecting the rate at which subsequent mutations occur. Here we have used a new mouse model of prostate cancer that recapitulates several salient features of the human disease to examine the relative rates in which the remaining wild-type alleles of Pten and p53 tumor suppressor genes are lost. In this model, focal overexpression of c-MYC in a few prostate luminal epithelial cells provokes a mild proliferative response. In the context of compound Pten/p53 heterozygosity, c-MYC-initiated cells progress to prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN) and adenocarcinoma lesions with marked heterogeneity within the same prostate glands. Using laser capture microdissection and gene copy number analyses, we found that the frequency of Pten loss was significantly higher than that of p53 loss in mPIN but not invasive carcinoma lesions. c-MYC overexpression, unlike Pten loss, did not activate the p53 pathway in transgenic mouse prostate cells, explaining the lack of selective pressure to lose p53 in the c-MYC-overexpressing cells. This model of heterogeneous prostate cancer based on alterations in genes relevant to the human disease may be useful for understanding pathogenesis of the disease and testing new therapeutic agents.",

The potential prognostic role of the combined alterations in EGFR and PTEN in prostate cancer is not well established. It was the aim of the study to investigate this role. Prevalence of EGFR and PTEN somatic mutations, EGFR amplification and EGFR protein expression were investigated in a series of prostate adenocarcinomas, classified according to the current Gleason grading system. Mutational analysis revealed eight EGFR and three PTEN mutations in 98 (8%) and 92 (3%) prostate adenocarcinomas, respectively. The combined prevalence of EGFR-PTEN mutations was 11%. EGFR overexpression was present in 31% of adenocarcinomas, with a marginally significant difference (P=0.068) between Gleason grade < or =7 adenocarcinomas and Gleason grade > or =8 and metastatic adenocarcinomas. Four cases (4 of 31; 13%) had an EGFR gene gain due to chromosome 7 polysomy. In 35% of adenocarcinomas we found some type of EGFR-PTEN alteration, with a tendency to be associated with advanced-stage prostate adenocarcinomas (P=0.04). The IVS18+19 polymorphism was also associated with more advanced prostate adenocarcinomas. This is the first study reporting mutations of EGFR and PTEN in the same series of prostate adenocarcinomas. Protein overexpression is the most frequent EGFR abnormality. Mutations in EGFR and PTEN genes are a minor event, although prostate cancer represents the third neoplasm in which the EGFR gene mutations are more prevalent.

Modeling prostate cancer in the mouse has shown that while Pten deletion in prostate epithelial cells leads to adenocarcinoma, combined loss of Pten and TP53 results in rapidly developing disease with greater tumor burden and early death. TP53 contributes significantly to the regulation of stem cell self-renewal, and we hypothesized that loss of Pten/TP53 would result in measurable changes in prostate cancer stem/progenitor cell properties. Clonogenic assays that isolate progenitor function in primary prostate epithelial cells were used to measure self-renewal, differentiation, and tumorigenic potential. Pten/TP53 null as compared with wild-type protospheres showed increased self-renewal activity and modified lineage commitment. Orthotopic transplantation of Pten/TP53 null cells derived from protospheres produced invasive Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (PIN)/adenocarcinoma, recapitulating the pathology seen in primary tumors. Pten/TP53 null progenitors relative to wild type also demonstrated increased dependence on the AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and androgen receptor (AR) pathways for clonogenic and tumorigenic growth. These data demonstrate roles for Pten/TP53 in prostate epithelial stem/progenitor cell function, and moreover, as seen in patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer, suggest for the involvement of an AR-dependent axis in the clonogenic expansion of prostate cancer stem cells.",

Since the primary prostate cancer diagnostic method, prostate biopsy, has limited accuracy in cancer diagnosis and malignant tissues have shown significantly different electrical properties from normal or benign tissues, MREIT has potential application in prostate cancer detection. The feasibility of utilizing MREIT in detecting prostate cancer was evaluated via a series of well-designed computer simulations in the present study. MREIT techniques with three different electrode configurations (external, trans-rectal, and trans-urethral electrode arrays) and two different reconstruction algorithms (J-substitution algorithm and harmonic Bz algorithm) were successfully developed. The performance of different MREIT techniques were evaluated and compared based on the imaging accuracy of the reconstructed conductivity distribution in the prostate. Without the presence of noise, the external MREIT achieves a better imaging accuracy than the two endo-MREIT (trans-rectal and trans-urethral) techniques, while the trans-urethral MREIT achieves the best imaging accuracy in noisy environments. We also found that the J-substitution reconstruction algorithm consistently offered better imaging accuracy than the harmonic Bz algorithm. When Gaussian distributed random noise with a standard deviation of 0.25 nT was added, the relative errors (RE) between the reconstructed and target conductivity distributions inside the prostate were observed to be 14.18% and 17.35% by the trans-urethral MREIT with the J-substitution and harmonic Bz algorithms respectively. The lower REs of 9.64% and 11.17% were achieved respectively when the standard deviation of noise was reduced to 0.05 nT. The simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of applying MREIT for prostate cancer detection. ",

Here, we investigate the expression of α(v)β(6) in mouse models of prostatic inflammation and prostate cancer to establish a possible relationship between inflammation of the prostate, α(v)β(6) expression and the progression of prostate cancer. Using immunohistochemical techniques, we show expression of α(v)β(6) in two in vivo mouse models; the Pten(pc)-/- model containing a prostate- specific Pten tumor suppressor deletion that causes cancer, and the prostate ovalbumin-expressing transgenic (POET) inflammation mouse model. We show that the α(v)β(6) integrin is induced in prostate cancer and inflammation in vivo in these two mouse models. α(v)β(6) is expressed in all the mice with cancer in the Pten(pc-/-) model but not in age-matched wild-type mice. In the POET inflammation model, α(v)β(6) is expressed in mice injected with activated T-cells, but in none of the control mice. In the POET model, we also used real time PCR to assess the expression of Transforming Growth Factor Beta 1 (TGFβ1), a factor in inflammation that is activated by α(v)β(6).

PSGR has been functionally implicated in prostate cancer cell invasiveness, suggesting a potential role in the transition to metastatic PCa. Recently, transgenic mice overexpressing PSGR in the prostate were reported to develop an acute inflammatory response followed by emergence of low grade PIN, whereas mice with compound PSGR overexpression and loss of PTEN exhibited accelerated formation of invasive prostate adenocarcinoma.

Pten-deficient prostate lesions arising from basal cells exhibited luminal phenotypes with higher invasiveness, and the cell fate of Pten-deficient basal cells was traced to neoplastic luminal cells. After temporally ablating Pten in keratin 8-expressing luminal cells, luminal-derived Pten-deficient prostate tumors exhibited slower disease progression, compared with basal-derived tumors, within 13 weeks after Pten ablation. Cellular proliferation was significantly increased in basal-derived versus luminal-derived Pten-deficient prostate lesions. Increased tumor invasion into the smooth muscle layer and aberrantly regulated aggressive signatures (Smad4 and Spp1) were identified exclusively in basal-derived Pten-deficient lesions. Interestingly, p63-expressing cells, which represent basal stem and progenitor cells of basal-derived Pten-deficient prostate lesions, were significantly increased, relative to cells of the luminal-derived prostate lesion. Furthermore, castration did not suppress cellular proliferation of either basal-derived or luminal-derived Pten-deficient prostate tumors.

Knockdown PTEN DU145 and 22Rv1 cells were augmented, and the stem cell-like properties were examined by cell viability and tumor sphere formation and treated by Akt IV inhibitor to provide the signal transduction pathway. Luciferase activity assays were performed.;The knockdown of PTEN in prostate cancer cell lines increased the stem-like properties of the cells, including their sphere-forming ability, stem cell population number, epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related gene expression, and ABCG2 expression. Additionally, PTEN expression was highly associated with elevated expression of phospho-Akt. Treatment with an Akt inhibitor suppressed the PTEN-mediated effects on the properties of these stem-like cells as well as drug resistance, ABCG2 expression, and the NF-κB pathway.;The loss of PTEN in prostate cancer cells resulted in an increased PI3K/Akt pathway.

Several neurological symptoms are also part of CD with megalencephaly and Lhermitte-Duclos disease (LDD) as the most important features. Early recognition of CD patients is important because of the increased risk of developing malignancies. Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy, but also urogenital, digestive tract, and thyroid cancers are found with higher frequencies. CD was localised to chromosome 10q23 and the PTEN gene (also known as MMAC1 or TEP1) was shown to be involved. Germline mutations were identified in both familial and sporadic CD patients. We identified eight PTEN mutations, of which seven were novel, in 13 CD patients. Combined with previous data we have identified 17 independent CD mutations. Gross DNA alterations in CD patients were not detected. Genotype-phenotype relations are discussed. The only correlation suggested to exist is that missense mutations are not detected in LDD patients. However, larger numbers are needed to confirm this. Association of PTEN mutations and the occurrence of malignant breast disease found in an earlier study cannot be confirmed. Clinical features of five CD patients without a PTEN mutation in the coding sequence do not differ from CD patients with a PTEN mutation. Furthermore, it is likely that we have identified the majority of CD patients in the Netherlands. From this we estimate that CD has a prevalence of about 1 in 250,000 in the Dutch population with a low mutation frequency.",

However, recent molecular studies have suggested that retrograde spread of invasive adenocarcinoma into pre-existing prostatic ducts can morphologically mimic HGPIN. Thus, previous molecular studies characterizing morphologically identified HGPIN occurring in radical prostatectomies or needle biopsies with concurrent invasive carcinoma may be partially confounded by intraductal spread of invasive tumor. To assess ERG and PTEN status in HGPIN foci likely to represent true precursor lesions in the prostate, we studied isolated HGPIN occurring without associated invasive adenocarcinoma in cystoprostatectomies performed at Johns Hopkins between 2009 and 2014. Of 344 cystoprostatectomies, 33% (115/344) contained invasive prostatic adenocarcinoma in the partially submitted prostate (10 blocks/case on average) and were excluded from the study. Of the remaining cases without sampled cancer, 32% (73/229) showed 133 separate foci of HGPIN and were immunostained for ERG and PTEN using genetically validated protocols. Of foci of HGPIN with evaluable staining, 7% (8/107) were positive for ERG. PTEN loss was not seen in any HGPIN lesion (0/88). Because these isolated HGPIN foci at cystoprostatectomy are unlikely to represent retrograde spread of invasive tumor, our study suggests that ERG rearrangement, but not PTEN loss, is present in a minority of potential neoplastic precursor lesions in the prostate.

We investigated the feasibility of using tumor cells derived from this model to test tumor vaccination and adoptive immunotherapeutic strategies for prostate cancer.;PTEN-CaP8 adenocarcinoma cells derived from the biallelic PTEN knockout prostate cancer model were used to vaccinate nontumor bearing litter mates. Tumor specific effector cells were generated from splenocytes of vaccinated mice by mixed lymphocyte-tumor reactions, and antiproliferative effects and cytokine generation were examined in vitro.

Utilizing a previously described mouse model that is genetically predisposed to prostate cancer through a prostate-specific heterozygous PTEN deletion, termed C57/Luc/Ptenp+/-, we used bioluminescence imaging and histopathological analyses to test whether chronic exposure to chlorpyrifos in a grain-based diet for 32 weeks was able to promote prostate cancer development. Chronic exposure to chlorpyrifos in the diet did not promote prostate cancer development in C57/Luc/Ptenp+/- mice despite achieving sufficient levels to inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity in plasma. We found no significant differences in numbers of murine prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia lesions or disease progression in chlorpyrifos versus control treated animals up to 32 weeks.

The goal of this study was to understand the anti-metastatic effect of anethole through C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4)/tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) axis in DU145 prostate cancer cells. Anethole reduced both of the RNA level and the protein level of CXCR4 in a dose-dependent manner without cytotoxicity. Anethole also reduced the expression of CXCR4 and prolonged the expression of PTEN in DU145 prostate cancers. The phosphorylation of AKT and phosphatidylinositol-3kinase (PI3K) were decreased with anethole. The inhibition metastatic effect of anethole was arisen from down-regulating CXCR4 and up-regulating PTEN. Morphologically, anethole significantly inhibited the invasion of DU145 cell and down-regulated the activities of matrix-metalloproteinase (MMPs) in a dose-dependent manner. However, anethole didnot decrease the phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT while PTEN was silenced. Furthermore, the CXCR4 inhibition of anethole was not caused to proteasomal or lysosomal of CXCR4. Taken together, anethole demonstrated to act as the CXCR4 antagonist and as the PTEN activator which resulted to PI3K/AKT-mediated inhibition of the metastatic prostate cancer progressions. ",

We report that on a C57BL/6 background, in contrast to previous studies on mixed 129 genetic backgrounds, Pten locus heterozygosity is fully penetrant for the development of prostate adenocarcinoma. Grossly observable tumors were detected at 6 months of age, and, by 10 to 12 months, 100% of examined mice developed adenocarcinoma of the anterior prostate. Furthermore, double heterozygotes carrying both Pten and Tsc2-null alleles showed no increase relative to Pten(+/-) heterozygotes in either lesion development or progression. Lesions in both Pten(+/-); Tsc2(+/-), and Pten(+/-) mice exhibited loss of PTEN expression and activation of PI3K signaling. PI3K activation occurred early in prostate intraepithelial neoplasia lesion formation in these animals, consistent with loss of PTEN function, and contributed to the etiology of tumors that developed in Pten(+/-) mice.

In PC patients, we show that PTEN is incorporated in the cargo of exosomes that circulate in their blood. Interestingly, normal subjects have no PTEN expression in their blood exosomes.

PTEN encodes a dual-specificity phosphatase with lipid phosphatase and protein tyrosine phosphatase activities that regulate both apoptosis and interactions with the extracellular matrix. Recent studies have associated PTEN mutations with tumorigenesis of prostate carcinoma via the Wnt signaling pathway, leading to nuclear beta-catenin accumulation. To elucidate the potential interaction of PTEN and beta-catenin in endometrial cancer, we performed mutation analyses of the entire PTEN gene and of exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene that is most frequently targeted by mutations. A total of 82 endometrial carcinomas comprising 62 type I endometrioid carcinomas and 20 type II high-grade carcinomas were investigated. In addition in a subset of 22 carcinomas, the intracellular beta-catenin distribution was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Overall, 20 (24.4%) of 82 tumors revealed mutations in the PTEN gene, and 16 (19.5%) of 82, in the beta-catenin gene. Six tumors (7.3%) showed mutations in both the PTEN and beta-catenin gene. Mutations were mainly detected in endometrioid carcinomas of the endometrium. As expected, a striking nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin could be shown in tumors with beta-catenin mutations. In the vast majority of tumors with PTEN mutations, a regular staining pattern of the cytoplasmic and membranous compartments was found.

We evaluated whether immunostains for PTEN and ERG can sensitively identify intraductal carcinoma and accurately distinguish it from high-grade PIN. A combined immunostain for PTEN, ERG, p63 and CK903 was developed and validated. Radical prostatectomy specimens with lesions meeting criteria for intraductal carcinoma (n=45), intraductal cribriform proliferations falling short of intraductal carcinoma (n=15), and PIN lesions (n=39) were retrospectively identified and assessed for PTEN and ERG. Cytoplasmic PTEN loss was identified in 84% (38/45) of the intraductal carcinoma and 100% (15/15) of intraductal cribriform proliferation cases. In contrast, cytoplasmic PTEN loss was never observed in PIN (0/39; P<0.0001). Of the 53 cases of intraductal carcinoma or intraductal cribriform proliferation with cytoplasmic PTEN loss, it was homogeneously lost in 42 cases (79%).

ERG expression was identified in 58% (26/45) of intraductal carcinoma and 67% (10/15) of intraductal cribriform proliferations compared with 13% (5/39) of PIN. Concordance between the PTEN/ERG status of the intraductal carcinoma lesions and the concurrent invasive carcinoma was high (>95% and P<0.0001 for each), and substantially less for PIN and the concurrent invasive tumor (83% for PTEN and 67% for ERG; P=NS for each). Cytoplasmic PTEN loss occurs in the majority of intraductal carcinoma and intraductal cribriform proliferation cases. Cytoplasmic PTEN loss was never observed in PIN (100% specificity). Our study identifies PTEN loss as a potentially useful marker to distinguish intraductal carcinoma from PIN and provides a plausible molecular explanation for why intraductal carcinoma is associated with poor prognosis.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The tumor suppressor gene PTEN (MMAC1, TEP1) encodes a dual-specificity phosphatase and is considered a progression-associated target of genetic alterations in human gliomas. Recently, it has been reported that the introduction of wild type PTEN into glioma cells containing endogenous mutant PTEN alleles (U87MG, LN-308), but not in those which retain wild-type PTEN (LN-18, LN-229), causes growth suppression and inhibits cellular migration, spreading and focal adhesion. Here, we show that PTEN gene transfer has no effect on the chemosensitivity of the four cell lines. Further, a correlational analysis of the endogenous PTEN status of 12 human glioma cell lines with their sensitivity to seven different cancer chemotherapy drugs reveals no link between PTEN and chemosensitivity. In contrast, ectopic expression of wild type PTEN, but not the PTEN(G129R) mutant, in PTEN-mutant gliomas markedly sensitizes these cells to irradiation and to CD95-ligand (CD95L)-induced apoptosis. PTEN-mediated facilitation of CD95L-induced apoptosis is associated with enhanced CD95L-evoked caspase 3 activity. Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), previously shown to inhibit CD95L-induced apoptosis in nonglial COS7 cells, is inactivated by dephosphorylation. Interestingly, both PTEN-mutant U87MG and PTEN-wild-type LN-229 cells contain phosphorylated PKB constitutively. Wild-type PTEN gene transfer promotes dephosphorylation of PKB specifically in U87MG cells but not in LN-229 cells. Sensitization of U87MG cells to CD95L-apoptosis by wild-type PTEN is blocked by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). The protection by IGF-1 is inhibited by the phosphoinositide 3-OH (PI 3) kinase inhibitor, wortmannin. Although PKB is a down-stream target of PI 3 kinase, the protection by IGF-1 was not associated with the reconstitution of PKB phosphorylation. Thus, PTEN may sensitize human malignant glioma cells to CD95L-induced apoptosis in a PI 3 kinase-dependent manner that may not require PKB phosphorylation.",

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the association between PTEN genomic deletion and a higher Gleason score or a higher possibility of capsular penetration. A comprehensive, computerized literature search of PubMed was carried out until May 27, 2014. Studies were included according to specific inclusion criteria. Pooled hazard ratio was estimated using the fixed effects model or random effects model according to heterogeneity between studies. Seven eligible studies meeting the specific inclusion criteria were selected for further analysis; all were retrospective studies. Overall meta-analysis demonstrated that PTEN genomic deletion was associated with a higher Gleason score (OR 0.319; 95% confidence interval: 0.153-0.666; P = 0.000) and a higher possibility of capsular penetration (OR 0.393; 95% confidence interval: 0.185-0.837; P = 0.015). None of the studies materially altered the original results and no evidence of publication bias was found.;PTEN genomic deletion in operable localized prostate cancer indicates a higher Gleason score and a higher probability of capsular penetration, indicating a worse prognosis.

However, in early clinical trials, men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer did not respond to PD-1 blockade as a monotherapy. One explanation for this unresponsiveness could be that prostate tumors generally do not express programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), the primary ligand for PD-1. However, lack of PD-L1 expression in prostate cancer would be surprising, given that phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss is relatively common in prostate cancer and several studies have shown that PTEN loss correlates with PD-L1 upregulation--constituting a mechanism of innate immune resistance. This study tested whether prostate cancer cells were capable of expressing PD-L1, and whether the rare PD-L1 expression that occurs in human specimens correlates with PTEN loss.;Human prostate cancer cell lines were evaluated for PD-L1 expression and loss of PTEN by flow cytometry and western blotting, respectively. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for PTEN was correlated with PD-L1 IHC using a series of resected human prostate cancer samples.;In vitro, many prostate cancer cell lines upregulated PD-L1 expression in response to inflammatory cytokines, consistent with adaptive immune resistance. In these cell lines, no association between PTEN loss and PD-L1 expression was apparent. In primary prostate tumors, PD-L1 expression was rare, and was not associated with PTEN loss.;These studies show that some prostate cancer cell lines are capable of expressing PD-L1.

Twelve (32%) out of 37 informative cases showed allelic losses of at least one locus on 10q and eight tumors showed a partial deletion of 10q.

Moreover, we detected a somatic missense mutation (Met --> Val) of a candidate tumor suppressor gene PTEN / MMAC1, located at 10q23.3, in one HCC with LOH of 10q. Our findings indicated the presence of putative tumor suppressor gene(s) in the distal region of 10q that might be involved in the development and progression of HCC.

This high frequency of recurrent PTEN deletions in prostate cancer suggests there may be unusual genomic features close to this locus that facilitate DNA alteration at 10q23.3. To explore possible mechanisms for deletions in the PTEN region, a meta-analysis of 311 published human genome array datasets was conducted and determined that the minimal prostate cancer-associated deletion at 10q23.3 corresponds to ∼2.06 MB region flanked by BMPR1A and FAS. On a separate cohort comprising an additional 330 tumors, four-color fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis using probes for BMPR1A, FAS, cen(10), and PTEN showed that 132 of 330 (40%) tumors had PTEN loss, 50 (15%) of which were homozygous losses (comprising in total 100 deletion events). Breakpoints between PTEN and BMPR1A or FAS were subsequently mapped in 100 homozygous and 82 hemizygous PTEN losses, revealing that 125/182 PTEN microdeletions occurred within the 940 kB interval between BMPR1A and PTEN. Furthermore, this breakpoint interval coincides with a repeat-rich region of 414 kB containing the SD17 and SD18 segmental duplications, which contain at least 13 homologous inverted repeat sequences. Together, these data suggest that a strong selective growth advantage for loss of PTEN and upregulation of PI3K/AKT, combined with the close proximity of PTEN to a large unstable segment of repeated DNA comprising SD17 and SD18, can lead to recurrent microdeletions of the PTEN gene in prostate cancer. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The PTEN and p53 tumour suppressors are among the most commonly inactivated or mutated genes in human cancer including prostate cancer. Although they are functionally distinct, reciprocal cooperation has been proposed, as PTEN is thought to regulate p53 stability, and p53 to enhance PTEN transcription. Here we show that conditional inactivation of Trp53 in the mouse prostate fails to produce a tumour phenotype, whereas complete Pten inactivation in the prostate triggers non-lethal invasive prostate cancer after long latency. Strikingly, combined inactivation of Pten and Trp53 elicits invasive prostate cancer as early as 2 weeks after puberty and is invariably lethal by 7 months of age. Importantly, acute Pten inactivation induces growth arrest through the p53-dependent cellular senescence pathway both in vitro and in vivo, which can be fully rescued by combined loss of Trp53. Furthermore, we detected evidence of cellular senescence in specimens from early-stage human prostate cancer. Our results demonstrate the relevance of cellular senescence in restricting tumorigenesis in vivo and support a model for cooperative tumour suppression in which p53 is an essential failsafe protein of Pten-deficient tumours.",

The aim of the current study was to assess the effect of IGF1R gene silencing in prostate cancer cells that lack functional PTEN protein. In human DU145, LNCaP and PC3 prostate cancer cells, transfection with IGF1R small interfering RNA induced significant enhancement of apoptosis and inhibition of survival, not only in PTEN wild-type DU145 but also in PTEN mutant LNCaP and PC3. This was attributed to attenuation of IGF signaling via Akt, ERKs and p38. In both DU145 and PC3, IGF1R knockdown led to enhancement of sensitivity to mitoxantrone, etoposide, nitrogen mustard and ionizing radiation. There was no sensitization to paclitaxel or 5-fluorouracil, which do not damage DNA, suggesting that chemosensitization results from impairment of the DNA damage response, in addition to removal of apoptosis protection.

This study was undertaken to determine, whether NBS1 expression is linked to clinically or molecularly relevant subgroups of prostate cancer. NBS1 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray containing 11,152 prostate cancer specimens. NBS1 expression was absent or only weakly detectable in benign prostate. In prostate cancers, NBS1 expression was found in 81.3% of interpretable tumors and was considered strong in 41.3% of cases. NBS1 upregulation was tightly linked to ERG-positive cancers (p<0.0001). Within ERG-negative cancers, strong NBS1 immunostaining was linked to advanced pathological tumor stage, high Gleason grade, and positive nodal status (p<0.0001 each), while high NBS1 immunostaining was only weakly associated with advanced pathological tumor stage in ERG-positive cancers (p=0.0099). A comparison with chromosomal deletions revealed a strong NBS1 upregulation in PTEN-deleted cancers, while deletions of 3p13, 5q21 and 6q15 did not affect NBS1 expression. High NBS1 expression was linked to biochemical recurrence in ERG-negative and PTEN non-deleted cancers (p<0.0001), which was largely driven by high KPNA2 karyopherin alpha 2 expression. In conclusion, our study identifies an association of NBS1 expression with surrogates of genomic instability in prostate cancer including TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangements and PTEN deletion.

This pathway is constitutively active and drives prostate cancer (PCa) progression to advanced metastatic disease. PTEN, a critical tumor and metastasis suppressor gene negatively regulates cell survival, proliferation, migration and angiogenesis via the PI3K/Akt pathway. PTEN is mutated, downregulated/dysfunctional in many cancers and its dysregulation correlates with poor prognosis in PCa. Here, we demonstrate that microRNA-4534 (miR-4534) is overexpressed in PCa and show that miR-4534 is hypermethylated in normal tissues and cell lines compared to PCa tissues/cells. miR-4534 exerts its oncogenic effects partly by downregulating the tumor suppressor PTEN gene. Knockdown of miR-4534 impaired cell proliferation, migration/invasion and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in PCa. Suppression of miR-4534 and its effects on tumor growth was confirmed in a xenograft mouse model. We performed parallel experiments in non-cancer RWPE1 cells by overexpessing miR-4534 followed by functional assays. Overexpression of miR-4534 induced pro-cancerous characteristics in this non-cancer cell line. Statistical analyses revealed that miR-4534 has potential to independently distinguish malignant from normal tissues and positively correlated with poor overall and PSA recurrence free survival. Taken together, our results show that depletion of miR-4534 in PCa induces a tumor suppressor phenotype partly through induction of PTEN. These results have important implications for identifying and defining the role of new PTEN regulators such as microRNAs in prostate tumorigenesis. Understanding aberrantly overexpressed miR-4534 and its downregulation of PTEN will provide mechanistic insight and therapeutic targets for PCa therapy.",

Id4 was either over-expressed or silenced in prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and LNCaP respectively followed by analysis of PTEN, NKX3.1 and Sox9 expression.;Id4-/- mice had smaller prostates with fewer tubules, smaller tubule diameters and subtle mPIN like lesions. Levels of androgen receptor were similar between wild type and Id4-/- prostate. Decreased NKX3.1 expression was in part due to decreased androgen receptor binding on NKX3.1 promoter in Id4-/- mice. The increase in the expression of Myc, Sox9, Id1, Ki67 and decrease in the expression of PTEN, Akt and phospho-AKT was associated with subtle mPIN like lesions in Id4-/- prostates. Finally, prostate cancer cell line models in which Id4 was either silenced or over-expressed confirmed that Id4 regulates NKX3.1, Sox9 and PTEN.;Our results suggest that loss of Id4 attenuates normal prostate development and promotes hyperplasia/dysplasia with subtle mPIN like lesions characterized by gain of Myc and Id1 and loss of Nkx3.1 and Pten expression. One of the mechanisms by which Id4 may regulate normal prostate development is through regulating androgen receptor binding to respective response elements such as those on NKX3.1 promoter. In spite of these complex alterations, large neoplastic lesions in Id4-/- prostates were not observed suggesting the possibility of mechanisms/pathways such as loss of Akt that could restrain the formation of significant pre-cancerous lesions.",

The goal of the present study was to determine the safety and efficacy of VSV treatment of prostate tumors that arise in situ in immunocompetent, transgenic prostate-specific PTEN-null (PTEN(-/-)) mice. Interferon-sensitive VSV(AV3 strain), which expresses luciferase, was injected intraprostatically into tumor-bearing PTEN(-/-) and control mice and then monitored for tissue bioluminescence over 96 hours. Virus readily dispersed throughout the bodies of mice after only 3 hours; however, it persisted at high levels for >72 hours in PTEN(-/-) mice, but at relatively low levels and for only approximately 48 hours in controls. Plaque assays provided a similar pattern, with much higher concentrations of replicating virus in prostates of PTEN(-/-) mice than in controls. Transient, low levels of virus were detected in the spleens of both groups. Apoptotic analyses by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining revealed that VSV(AV3) is able to selectively infect and kill prostate cells in PTEN(-/-) mice, while sparing normal cells in control mice. The primary mechanism for cell kill is apparently apoptotic oncolysis as opposed to neutrophil invasion as has been reported using xenograft models. These results suggest that control of locally advanced human prostate cancer may be achievable through intraprostatic injection and amplification of a safe oncolytic virus, such as VSV(AV3).",

Chromosome 16q deletion was found in 21% of cancers, and was linked to advanced tumor stage, high Gleason grade, accelerated cell proliferation, the presence of lymph node metastases (p < 0.0001 each) and positive surgical margin (p = 0.0004). 16q Deletion was more frequent in ERG fusion-positive (27%) as compared to ERG fusion-negative cancers (16%, p < 0.0001), and was linked to other ERG-associated deletions including phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) (p < 0.0001) and 3p13 (p = 0.0303). In univariate analysis, the deletion of 16q was linked to early biochemical recurrence independently from the ERG status (p < 0.0001). Tumors with codeletions of 16q and PTEN had a worse prognosis (p = 0.0199) than those with PTEN or the deletion of 16q alone. Multivariate modeling revealed that the prognostic value of 16q/PTEN deletion patterns was independent from the established prognostic factors. In summary, the results of our study demonstrate that the deletion of 16q and PTEN cooperatively drives prostate cancer progression, and suggests that deletion analysis of 16q and PTEN could be of important clinical value particularly for preoperative risk assessment of the clinically most challenging group of low- and intermediated grade prostate cancers.",

Data on ERG status and PTEN, 3p13, 5q21 and 6q15 deletions were available from earlier studies. AZGP1 expression was strong in benign prostatic glands but absent in 38.0% of 8,510 interpretable prostate cancers. Reduced AZGP1 expression was associated with TPMRSS2:ERG fusions, both by FISH and immunohistochemical analysis (p < 0.0001 each). For example, AZGP1 was absent in 54.6% of 2,029 ERG IHC positive but in only 28.1% of 2,398 ERG negative cancers. Irrespective of the ERG status, reduced AZGP1 expression was tightly linked to high Gleason score, advanced pathological tumor stage, positive nodal status and early PSA recurrence (p < 0.0001 each). Reduced AZGP1 expression was also strongly associated with PTEN deletions. AZGP1 immunostaining was lacking in 62.7% of 842 PTEN deleted but in only 37.3% of PTEN non-deleted cancers but retained strong prognostic influence in both subgroups (p < 0.0001 each). The prognostic role of AZGP1 expression was also independent of Gleason score, pT stage, pN stage, surgical margin status and preoperative PSA, irrespective of whether preoperative or postoperative variables were used for modeling.

On the other hand, results of recent animal studies as well as clinical evidence indicate that PTEN is also involved in tumor metastasis suppression. Although PTEN is known to play a key role in controlling cell growth and apoptosis, how PTEN exerts the metastasis suppressor function remains largely unknown. Recently, a microarray analysis identified the Drg-1 gene (differentiation related gene 1) as one of the potential targets of PTEN. The Drg-1 gene has been shown to suppress tumor metastasis in animal models of prostate and colon cancer, and the expression of this gene is significantly reduced with advancement of prostate and breast cancers in clinical setting. In this study, we explored the possibility that PTEN controls tumor metastasis by regulating the expression of the Drg-1 gene. Our results indicate that overexpression of PTEN significantly augments the endogenous expression of Drg-1 protein, whereas inhibition of PTEN by small interfering RNA decreases Drg-1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We also found that the control of the Drg-1 gene by PTEN seems to be at the transcriptional level, and that a phospho-Akt inhibitor restores the Drg-1 expression, indicating that PTEN controls Drg-1 by an Akt-dependent pathway. Consistent with these results, our immunohistochemical analysis revealed that PTEN expression correlates significantly with Drg-1 in both prostate and breast cancer cases. Furthermore, combination of the two markers, PTEN and Drg-1, emerged as a significantly better predictor of prostate and breast cancer patient survival than either marker alone.",

Among 426 PCa patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP), the prognostic significance of the studied SNPs on biochemical recurrence (BCR) was also assessed using the Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression model.

We found the upregulation of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1) in human PCa and cultured PCa cells, but not in normal prostates and non-tumorigenic prostate cells. To understand the role of NFATc1 in prostate tumorigenesis in situ, we temporally and spatially controlled the activation of NFATc1 in mouse prostate and showed that such activation resulted in prostatic adenocarcinoma with features similar to those seen in human PCa. Our results indicate that the activation of a single transcription factor, NFATc1 in prostatic luminal epithelium to PCa can affect expression of diverse factors in both cells harboring the genetic changes and in neighboring cells through microenvironmental alterations. In addition to the activation of oncogenes c-MYC and STAT3 in tumor cells, a number of cytokines and growth factors, such as IL1β, IL6 and SPP1 (osteopontin, a key biomarker for PCa), were upregulated in NFATc1-induced PCa, establishing a tumorigenic microenvironment involving both NFATc1 positive and negative cells for prostate tumorigenesis. To further characterize interactions between genes involved in prostate tumorigenesis, we generated mice with both NFATc1 activation and Pten inactivation in prostate. We showed that NFATc1 activation led to acceleration of Pten null-driven prostate tumorigenesis by overcoming the PTEN loss-induced cellular senescence through inhibition of p21 activation. This study provides direct in vivo evidence of an oncogenic role of NFATc1 in prostate tumorigenesis and reveals multiple functions of NFATc1 in activating oncogenes, in inducing proinflammatory cytokines, in oncogene addiction, and in overcoming cellular senescence, which suggests calcineurin-NFAT signaling as a potential target in preventing PCa.

Through expression profiling of glioblastoma tissue samples and prostate cancer xenografts, we identified a molecular signature for loss of the PTEN tumor suppressor in glioblastoma and prostate tumors. The PTEN signature consists of a minimum of nine genes, several of which are involved in various pathways already implicated in tumor formation. Among these signature genes, the most significant was an increase in insulin growth factor-binding protein 2 (IGFBP-2) mRNA. Up-regulation of IGFBP-2 was confirmed at the protein level by Western blot analysis and validated in samples not included in the microarray analysis. The link between IGFBP-2 and PTEN was of particular interest because elevated serum IGFBP-2 levels have been reported in patients with prostate and brain tumors. To further investigate this link, we determined that IGFBP-2 expression is negatively regulated by PTEN and positively regulated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt activation. In addition, Akt-driven transformation is impaired in IGFBP2(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts, implicating a functional role for IGFBP-2 in PTEN signaling. Collectively, these studies establish that PTEN and IGFBP-2 expression are inversely correlated in human brain and prostate cancers and implicate serum IGFBP-2 levels as a potential serum biomarker of PTEN status and PI3K Akt pathway activation in cancer patients.",

The transcription factor Runx2 plays an important role in bone formation and prostate cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. Here we showed that the forkhead box O (FOXO1) protein, a key downstream effector of the tumor suppressor PTEN, inhibits the transcriptional activity of Runx2 in prostate cancer cells. This inhibition was enhanced by PTEN but diminished by active Akt. FOXO1 bound to Runx2 in vitro and in vivo and suppressed Runx2's activity independent of its transcriptional function. FOXO1 inhibited Runx2-promoted migration of prostate cancer cells, whereas silencing of endogenous FOXO1 enhanced prostate cancer cell migration in a Runx2-dependent manner. Forced expression of FOXO1 also inhibited Runx2-promoted prostate cancer cell invasion. Finally, we found that expression of PTEN and the level of FOXO1 in the nucleus is inversely correlated with expression of Runx2 in a cohort of prostate cancer specimens from patients with lymph node and bone metastasis. These data reveal FOXO1 as a critical negative regulator of Runx2 in prostate cancer cells. Inactivation of FOXO1 due to frequent loss of PTEN in prostate cancer cells may leave the oncogenic activities of Runx2 unchecked, thereby driving promiscuous expression of Runx2 target genes involved in cell migration and invasion and favoring prostate cancer progression.",

Maternal HFD-induced phenotypes are focally present in young adult subjects and greatly exacerbated in aged subjects.

Recent work has suggested that the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion is associated with a more aggressive phenotype. Similarly, PTEN deletion has been associated with biochemical recurrence and lymph node metastasis. To date, there has been no systematic analysis of the combined influence of genomic PTEN deletion with TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusions on clinical parameters of prostate cancer progression. We carried out a retrospective analysis of 125 prostate cancers with known clinical outcome using interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization to detect the relative prevalence of TMPRSS2:ERG rearrangements and/or PTEN genomic deletions. TMPRSS2:ERG rearrangement was found in 60 of 125 (48%) prostate cancers. Duplication of TMPRSS2:ERG fusion was observed in seven (6%) tumors. Gleason grade (P=0.0002)/score (P=0.001), median tumor volume (P=0.0024), preoperative PSA (P=0.001) and perineural invasion (P=0.0304) were significantly associated with biochemical recurrence by univariate analysis with TMPRSS2:ERG approaching significance (P=0.0523). By multivariate analysis, relevant factors associated with recurrence were Gleason scores 7 (P=0.001) and 8-10 (P=0.015), PTEN homozygous deletion (P=0.013) and concurrent TMPRSS2:ERG fusion and PTEN deletion (P=0.036). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that the presence of TMPRSS2:ERG fusion was marginally less favorable in comparison to no fusion. Duplication of fusion gene showed worse prognosis. It was possible to determine the relative frequencies of PTEN deletion and/or TMPRSS2:ERG fusions in 82 of 125 prostate cancers. With biochemical recurrence as an endpoint, the genomic biomarkers identified three patient groups: (1) 'poor genomic grade' characterized by both PTEN deletion and TMPRSS2:ERG fusions (23/82, 28%); (2) 'intermediate genomic grade' with either PTEN deletion or TMPRSS2:ERG fusion (35/82, 43%) and (3) 'favorable genomic grade' in which neither rearrangement was present (24/82, 29%).

Here we show that PTEN suppresses androgen receptor (AR) activity via a phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase/Akt-independent pathway in the early passage numbers prostate cancer LNCaP cells. We provide the direct links between PTEN and androgen/AR signaling by demonstrating that AR directly interacts with PTEN. The interaction between PTEN and AR inhibits the AR nuclear translocation and promotes the AR protein degradation that result in the suppression of AR transactivation and induction of apoptosis. The minimum interaction peptide within AR (amino acids 483-651) disrupts the interaction of PTEN with AR and reduces the PTEN effect on AR transactivation and apoptosis. Genetic approaches using PTEN-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) further demonstrate that both AR expression and AR activity were much higher in PTEN-null MEFs than wild-type MEFs, and reintroducing PTEN into PTEN-null MEFs dramatically reduced AR protein levels and AR activity. Interestingly, we also found that PTEN could suppress AR activity via the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase/Akt-dependent pathway in the higher passage number LNCaP cells, because restoration of Akt activity blocks the effect of PTEN on AR activity. Together, these contrasting PTEN effects on AR activity in the same prostate cancer cell line with different passage numbers suggest that PTEN, via distinct mechanisms, differentially regulates AR in various stages of prostate cancers.",

It most often has a multifocal distribution within the gland, and different Gleason grades may be present within different foci. Data from our group and others have shown that the genomic deletion of the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) tumor suppressor gene and the disruption of the ETS gene family have a central role in prostate cancer and are likely to be associated with Gleason grade. In this study, prostate cancer samples were systematically analyzed to determine whether there was concordance between PTEN losses and TMPRSS2-ERG fusion rearrangements, within or between foci in multifocal disease, using well-annotated tissue microarrays (TMAs) consisting of 724 cores derived from 142 radical prostatectomy specimens. Three-color fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of both the PTEN deletion and the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion was used to precisely map genetic heterogeneity, both within and between tumor foci represented on the TMA. PTEN deletion was observed in 56 of 134 (42%) patients (hemizygous=42 and homozygous=14). TMPRSS2-ERG fusion was observed in 63 of 139 (45%) patients. When analyzed by Gleason pattern for a given TMA core, PTEN deletions were significantly associated with Gleason grades 4 or 5 over grade 3 (P<0.001). Although TMPRSS2-ERG fusions showed a strong relationship with PTEN deletions (P=0.007), TMPRSS2-ERG fusions did not show correlation with Gleason grade. The pattern of genetic heterogeneity of PTEN deletion was more diverse than that observed for TMPRSS2-ERG fusions in multifocal disease. However, the marked interfocal discordance for both TMPRSS2-ERG fusions and PTEN deletions was consistent with the concept that multiple foci of prostate cancer arise independently within the same prostate, and that individual tumor foci can have distinct patterns of genetic rearrangements.",

Genetic ablation of Par-4 induces fully invasive prostate carcinomas in PTEN-heterozygous mice. In contrast, Par-4 deficiency alone, like PTEN heterozygosis, results in lesions that are unable to progress beyond the benign neoplastic stage known as PIN. At this PIN transition, the mutual induction of Par-4 and PTEN is an additional regulatory step in preventing cancer progression. Par-4 deficiency cooperates with PTEN haploinsufficiency in prostate cancer initiation and progression and their simultaneous inactivation, in addition to enhancing Akt activation, sets in motion a unique mechanism involving the synergistic activation of NFkappaB. These results suggest that the concurrent interruption of complementary signaling pathways targeting PI3K/Akt and NFkappaB activation could provide new and effective strategies for cancer therapy.",

Comparative studies between mouse and human are important because mice are widely used to study prostate cancer, a disease that occurs in a region-restricted manner within the human prostate. An informatics-based approach was used to identify prostate-specific human genes as candidate markers of region-specific identity that might distinguish prostatic ducts prone to prostate cancer from ducts that rarely give rise to cancer. Subsequent analysis of normal and cancerous human prostates demonstrated that the genes microseminoprotein-beta (MSMB) and transglutaminase 4 (TGM4) were expressed in distinct groups of ducts in the normal human prostate, and only MSMB was detected in areas of prostate cancer. The mouse orthologs of MSMB and TGM4 were then used for expression studies in mice along with the mouse ventrally expressed gene spermine binding protein (SBP). All three genes were informative markers of region-specific epithelial identity with distinct expression patterns that collectively accounted for all ducts in the mouse prostate. Together with the human data, this suggested that MSMB expression defines an anatomical domain in the mouse prostate that is molecularly most similar to human prostate cancers. Computer-assisted serial section reconstruction was used to visualize the complete expression domains for MSMB, SBP, and TGM4 in the mouse prostate. This showed that MSMB is expressed in prostatic ducts that comprise 21% of the mouse dorso-lateral prostate. Finally, the expression of MSMB, SBP, and TGM4 was evaluated in a mouse prostate cancer model created by the prostate epithelium-specific deletion of the tumor suppressor PTEN. MSMB and TGM4 were rapidly and dramatically down-regulated in response to PTEN deletion suggesting that this model of prostate cancer includes a more rapid de-differentiation of the prostatic epithelium than is observed in organ-confined human prostate cancers.",

Monoclonal antibodies were generated against murine PSCA (mPSCA). mPSCA is expressed on approximately 20% of cells in normal prostate epithelium, and this number decreases with increasing age. In the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model of prostate cancer, tumors develop between 19 and 25 weeks of age. Murine PSCA was strongly expressed on approximately 60% of the cells of TRAMP tumors, at an age where the number of PSCA+ cells and the level of expression of PSCA is very low in the normal prostate. Phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) +/- mice develop a number of different cancers, including prostate cancer. The incidence of prostate cancer is low and occurs after a relatively long latency. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of prostatic tissue from 11-18-month-old PTEN +/- mice showed elevated numbers of PSCA+ cells in the prostate, and immunohistochemical analysis showed high mPSCA expression in the tumors of these mice. Together, these results show that two distinct mechanisms of carcinogenesis lead to expression of a common target antigen.",

Thus, developing molecular markers of small cell differentiation in prostate cancer will be important to guide the diagnosis and therapy of this aggressive tumor.;We examined the status of RB1, TP53, and PTEN in prostatic small cell and acinar carcinomas via immunohistochemistry (IHC), copy-number alteration analysis, and sequencing of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens.;We found retinoblastoma (Rb) protein loss in 90% of small cell carcinoma cases (26 of 29) with RB1 allelic loss in 85% of cases (11 of 13). Of acinar tumors occurring concurrently with prostatic small cell carcinoma, 43% (3 of 7) showed Rb protein loss. In contrast, only 7% of primary high-grade acinar carcinomas (10 of 150), 11% of primary acinar carcinomas with neuroendocrine differentiation (4 of 35), and 15% of metastatic castrate-resistant acinar carcinomas (2 of 13) showed Rb protein loss. Loss of PTEN protein was seen in 63% of small cell carcinomas (17 of 27), with 38% (5 of 13) showing allelic loss. By IHC, accumulation of p53 was observed in 56% of small cell carcinomas (14 of 25), with 60% of cases (6 of 10) showing TP53 mutation.;Loss of RB1 by deletion is a common event in prostatic small cell carcinoma and can be detected by a validated IHC assay.

The activation status of PKB is regulated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) via the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3, PIP3). PTEN antagonises PI3K by degrading PIP3 to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). Deregulation of PKB through loss of functional PTEN has frequently been implicated in the progression of tumours, including prostate cancer, and the PTEN-negative prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and PC3 have been widely used as models for this mechanism of constitutive PKB activation. However, other enzymes in addition to PTEN can antagonise PI3K, including SHIP2, which degrades PIP3 to phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2). We investigated the role of PTEN and SHIP2 in the regulation of PKB phosphorylation in a panel of human prostate-derived epithelial cell lines. In the PTEN-positive prostate-derived cell lines PNT2, PNT1a and P4E6, PI3K inhibition by LY294002 caused rapid dephosphorylation of PKB at ser473 (T(1/2)<2 min), leading to its inactivation. In the PTEN-null line LNCaP, LY294002-induced PKB dephosphorylation was much slower (T(1/2)>20 min), but in PC3 cells (also PTEN-null) it was only slightly slower than in PTEN-positive cells (T(1/2)=3 min). PKB dephosphorylation paralleled loss of plasma membrane PIP3. PNT1a, P4E6 and PC3, but not PNT2 or LNCaP, expressed SHIP2. SiRNA-mediated knockdown of SHIP2 expression markedly slowed PKB inactivation in response to LY294002 in PC3 but not in other SHIP2-positive cells, whereas knockdown of PTEN expression in PNT2, PNT1a and P4E6 resulted in higher steady-state levels of PKB phosphorylation and slowed, but did not prevent, LY294002-induced PKB inactivation. Thus SHIP2 substitutes for PTEN in the acute regulation of PKB in PC3 cells but not other prostate cell lines, where PTEN may share this role with further PIP3-degrading mechanisms.",

LIG4 expression was predominantly localized in the nucleus of the cells with increased intensities in malignant as compared to benign prostate epithelium. In prostate cancer, LIG4 expression was found in 91% of interpretable tumors, including 12% cancers with weak, 23% with moderate and 56% with strong LIG4 positivity. Strong LIG4 expression was tightly linked to advanced Gleason score (P<0.0001) and positive nodal involvement (P=0.03). There was a remarkable accumulation of strong LIG4 expression in tumors harboring TMPRSS2:ERG fusion and PTEN deletions (P<0.0001 each).

Multivariate analysis including parameters that are available before surgery demonstrated independent association with biochemical recurrence for advanced Gleason grade on biopsy, high preoperative PSA level, high clinical stage (P<0.0001 each) and for LIG4 immunostaining (P=0.03).

Development of antimetastatic drugs that trigger or mimic the effect of metastasis suppressors represents new therapeutic approaches to improve patient survival.

Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models have been constructed to assess the causal role of these putative oncogenic events and provide molecular insight into disease pathogenesis. While GEM models generally initiate neoplasia by manipulating a single gene, expression profiles of GEM tumors typically comprise hundreds of transcript alterations. It is unclear whether these transcriptional changes represent the pleiotropic effects of single oncogenes, and/or cooperating genomic or epigenomic events. Therefore, it was determined whether structural chromosomal alterations occur in GEM models of prostate cancer and whether the changes are concordant with human carcinomas. Whole genome array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was used to identify somatic chromosomal copy number aberrations (SCNA) in the widely used TRAMP, Hi-Myc, Pten-null, and LADY GEM models. Interestingly, very few SCNAs were identified and the genomic architecture of Hi-Myc, Pten-null, and LADY tumors were essentially identical to the germline. TRAMP neuroendocrine carcinomas contained SCNAs, which comprised three recurrent aberrations including a single copy loss of chromosome 19 (encoding Pten). In contrast, cell lines derived from the TRAMP, Hi-Myc, and Pten-null tumors were notable for numerous SCNAs that included copy gains of chromosome 15 (encoding Myc) and losses of chromosome 11 (encoding p53).;Chromosomal alterations are not a prerequisite for tumor formation in GEM prostate cancer models and cooperating events do not naturally occur by mechanisms that recapitulate changes in genomic integrity as observed in human prostate cancer.",

Through an understanding of the key pathways involved in prostate cancer progression, a rational drug design can be aimed at the molecules critical to cellular signaling. This may enable administration of selective therapies based on the expression of molecular targets, more appropriately individualizing treatment for prostate cancer patients. One pathway with a prominent role in prostate cancer is the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Current estimates suggest that PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling is upregulated in 30-50% of prostate cancers, often through loss of PTEN. Molecular changes in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway have been demonstrated to differentiate benign from malignant prostatic epithelium and are associated with increasing tumor stage, grade, and risk of biochemical recurrence. Multiple inhibitors of this pathway have been developed and are being assessed in the laboratory and in clinical trials, with much attention focusing on mTOR inhibition. Current clinical trials in prostate cancer are assessing efficacy of mTOR inhibitors in combination with multiple targeted or traditional chemotherapies, including bevacizumab, gefitinib, and docetaxel. Completion of these trials will provide substantial information regarding the importance of this pathway in prostate cancer and the clinical implications of its targeted inhibition.

Heterogeneity of the aberrations detected was evaluated. Genetic patterns were also correlated with transcript levels. Among samples with complete data available, the three-marker FISH panel detected chromosomal abnormalities in 53% of primary prostate cancers and 87% of metastatic (Met) or castration-resistant (CRPC) tumors. The number of markers with abnormal FISH result had a different distribution between the two groups (P<0.001). At the patient level, Met/CRPC tumors are 4.5 times more likely to show abnormalities than primary cancer patients (P<0.05). Heterogeneity among Met/CRPC tumors is mostly inter-patient. Intra-patient heterogeneity is primarily due to differences between the primary prostate tumor and the metastases while multiple metastatic sites show consistent abnormalities. Intra-tumor variability is most prominent with the AR copy number in primary tumors. AR copy number correlated well with the AR mRNA expression (rho = 0.52, P<0.001).

Our imaging data revealed an unexpected, aberrant accumulation of esterified cholesterol in lipid droplets of high-grade prostate cancer and metastases. Biochemical study showed that such cholesteryl ester accumulation was a consequence of loss of tumor suppressor PTEN and subsequent activation of PI3K/AKT pathway in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, we found that such accumulation arose from significantly enhanced uptake of exogenous lipoproteins and required cholesterol esterification.

While there is some evidence to suggest that these lesions can be related and exist on a pathological and morphological continuum, the precise clonal and temporal relationships between precursor lesions and invasive cancers within individual tumours remain undefined. Here, we used molecular genetic, cytogenetic, and histological analyses to delineate clonal, temporal, and spatial relationships between HGPIN and cancer lesions with distinct morphological and molecular features. First, while confirming the previous finding that a substantial fraction of HGPIN lesions associated with ERG-positive cancers share rearrangements and overexpression of ERG, we found that a significant subset of such HGPIN glands exhibit only partial positivity for ERG. This suggests that such ERG-positive HGPIN cells either rapidly invade to form adenocarcinoma or represent cancer cells that have partially invaded the ductal and acinar space in a retrograde manner. To clarify these possibilities, we used ERG expression status and TMPRSS2-ERG genomic breakpoints as markers of clonality, and PTEN deletion status to track temporal evolution of clonally related lesions. We confirmed that morphologically distinct HGPIN and nearby invasive cancer lesions are clonally related. Further, we found that a significant fraction of ERG-positive, PTEN-negative HGPIN and intraductal carcinoma (IDC-P) lesions are most likely clonally derived from adjacent PTEN-negative adenocarcinomas, indicating that such PTEN-negative HGPIN and IDC-P lesions arise from, rather than give rise to, the nearby invasive adenocarcinoma. These data suggest that invasive adenocarcinoma can morphologically mimic HGPIN through retrograde colonization of benign glands with cancer cells. Similar clonal relationships were also seen for intraductal carcinoma adjacent to invasive adenocarcinoma. These findings represent a potentially undervalued indicator of pre-existing invasive prostate cancer and have significant implications for prostate cancer diagnosis and risk stratification.",

MT1-MMP is highly expressed in bone metastasis of prostate cancer (PC) patients and promotes intraosseous tumor growth of PC cells in mice. The majority of metastatic prostate cancers harbor loss-of-function mutations or deletions of the tumor suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten). However, the role of PTEN inactivation in MT1-MMP expression in PC cells has not been examined. In this study, prostate epithelial cell lines derived from mice that are either heterozygous (PTEN(+/-)) or homozygous (PTEN(-/-)) for PTEN deletion or harboring a wild-type PTEN (PTEN(+/+)) were used to investigate the expression of MT1-MMP. We found that biallelic loss of PTEN is associated with posttranslational regulation of MT1-MMP protein in mouse PC cells. PTEN(-/-) PC cells display higher levels of MT1-MMP at the cell surface when compared to PTEN(+/+) and PTEN(+/-) cells and consequently exhibited enhanced migratory and collagen-invasive activities. MT1-MMP displayed by PTEN(-/-) cells is differentially O-glycosylated and exhibits a slow rate of turnover. MT1-MMP expression in PTEN(-/-) cells is under control of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, as determined using pharmacological inhibitors. Interestingly, rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, upregulates MT1-MMP expression in PTEN(+/+) cells via PI3K activity. Collectively, these data in a mouse prostate cell system uncover for the first time a novel and complex relationship between PTEN loss-mediated PI3K/AKT activation and posttranslational regulation of MT1-MMP, which may play a role in PC progression.",

Outcome was determined by 60-month follow-up determining serum prostate-specific antigen levels.;By itself, PTEN was not a good predictor of biochemical recurrence; however, in combination with pAkt, it was a better predictor of the risk of biochemical recurrence compared with pAkt alone. Ninety percent of all cases with high pAkt and negative PTEN were recurrent whereas 88.2% of those with low pAkt and positive PTEN were nonrecurrent. In addition, high Gleason scores resulted in reduced protection from decreased pAkt and increased PTEN. By univariate logistic regression, pAkt alone gives an area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve of 0.82 whereas the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve for the combination of PTEN, pAkt, and Gleason based on a stepwise selection model is 0.89, indicating excellent discrimination.;Our results indicate that loss of PTEN expression, together with increased Akt phosphorylation and Gleason score, is of significant predictive value for determining, at the time of prostatectomy, the risk of biochemical recurrence.",

Intact PTEN suppresses phosphorylation of Akt downstream of PI3K activation in non-transformed cells whereas Akt phosphorylation is unimpeded in malignant cells that are often PTEN-deficient. We have previously shown that activation of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis transactivates the EGFR to promote pro-proliferative signaling preferentially through the Raf/MEK/Erk pathway in benign prostate epithelial cells. These cells demonstrate little basal pAkt and these levels do not increase with CXCL12 stimulation because PTEN is intact and fully functional. Thus, inactivation of PTEN may be the critical factor that modulates downstream signaling and the specific CXCL12-stimulated proliferative responses of non-transformed and transformed prostate epithelial cells. Based on these data, we hypothesize that the CXCL12/CXCR4-mediated activation of downstream pro-proliferative signaling through the Raf/MEK/Erk or PI3K/Akt pathways is modulated by PTEN status. ",

Although the importance of dietary stilbenes such as resveratrol and pterostilbene as anti-cancer agents is well recognized, our understanding of their miRNA-targeting capabilities is still limited. In our previous study, we reported that resveratrol downregulates PTEN-targeting members of the oncogenic miR-17 family, which are overexpressed in prostate cancer. This study investigates the resveratrol and pterostilbene induced miRNA-mediated regulation of PTEN in prostate cancer. Here, we show that both compounds decrease the levels of endogenous as well as exogenously expressed miR-17, miR-20a and miR-106b thereby upregulating their target PTEN. Using functional luciferase reporter assays, we demonstrate that ectopically expressed miR-17, miR-20a and miR-106b directly target PTEN 3'UTR to reduce its expression, an effect rescued upon treatment with resveratrol and pterostilbene. Moreover, while stable lentiviral expression of miR-17/106a significantly decreased PTEN mRNA and protein levels and conferred survival advantage to the cells, resveratrol and more so pterostilbene was able to dramatically suppress these effects. Further, pterostilbene through downregulation of miR-17-5p and miR-106a-5p expression both in tumors and systemic circulation, rescued PTEN mRNA and protein levels leading to reduced tumor growth in vivo. Our findings implicate dietary stilbenes as an attractive miRNA-mediated chemopreventive and therapeutic strategy, and circulating miRNAs as potential chemopreventive and predictive biomarkers for clinical development in prostate cancer.

In this context, miR-21 was found to be overexpressed in different human cancers (e.g. glioblastoma, breast cancer). In addition, it is thought to be endowed with oncogenic properties due to its ability to negatively modulate the expression of tumor-suppressor genes (e.g. PTEN) and to cause the reversion of malignant phenotype when knocked- down in several tumor models. On the basis of these findings, miR-21 has been proposed as a widely exploitable cancer-related target. However, scanty information is available concerning the relevance of miR-21 for prostate cancer. In the present study, we investigated the role of miR-21 and its potential as a therapeutic target in two prostate cancer cell lines, characterized by different miR-21 expression levels and PTEN gene status.;We provide evidence that miR-21 knockdown in prostate cancer cells is not sufficient per se i) to affect the proliferative and invasive potential or the chemo- and radiosensitivity profiles or ii) to modulate the expression of the tumor-suppressors PTEN and Pdcd4, which in other tumor types were found to be regulated by miR-21. We also show that miR-21 is not differently expressed in carcinomas and matched normal tissues obtained from 36 untreated prostate cancer patients subjected to radical prostatectomy.;Overall, our data suggest that miR-21 is not a central player in the onset of prostate cancer and that its single hitting is not a valuable therapeutic strategy in the disease.

These observations support the hypothesis that AR isoform accumulation is a consequence of selective therapeutic pressure on the full length AR. The Pten deficient prostate cancer model proceeds with well-defined kinetics including progression to castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). While surgical castration and enzalutamide treatments yield an initial therapeutic response, Pten-/-epithelia continue to proliferate yielding locally invasive primary tumor pathology. That most epithelium remains AR positive, but ligand independent, suggests the presence of oncogenic AR variants. To address this hypothesis, we have used a panel of recently described Pten-/- tumor cell lines derived from both from hormone intact (E4, E8) and castrated Pten mutants (cE1, cE2) followed by RACE PCR to identify and characterize three novel truncated, amino terminus containing AR variants (mAR-Va, b, c). Variants appear not only conserved throughout progression but are correlated with nearly complete loss of full length AR (AR-FL) at castrate androgen levels. The overexpression of variants leads to enhanced transcriptional activity of AR while knock down studies show reduced transcriptional output. Collectively, the identification of truncated AR variants in the conditional PTEN deletion model supports a role for maintaining the CRPC phenotype and provides further therapeutic applications of this preclinical model.

Following a single oral dose of PhIP (200 mg/kg body weight), we observed inflammation, atrophy of acini, low-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN; after 20 weeks), and high-grade PIN (HgPIN; after 30 to 50 weeks) in dorsolateral, ventral, and coagulating anterior prostate glands of these mice. These lesions were androgen receptor positive and featured the loss of expression of the basal cell marker p63 and the tumor suppressor PTEN. Similar to human prostate carcinogenesis, glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) expression was lost or partially lost in HgPIN. E-Cadherin expression was also lost in HgPIN. The expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 was elevated, possibly to enhance promoter hypermethylation for the silencing of GSTP1 and E-cadherin. Prostate carcinogenesis was promoted by a high-fat stress diet, resulting in HgPIN that developed earlier and in advanced lesions displayed features consistent with carcinoma in situ. This dietary carcinogen-induced prostate cancer model, recapitulating important features of early human prostate carcinogenesis, constitutes a new experimental system for prostate cancer research.",

We hypothesized that these three characteristics may not be unrelated, specifically that, together, they may favor the metastatic spread of prostatic cancer cells without decreasing their growth potential. In support of this hypothesis, we report here that: (1) IRS-1 expression increases cell adhesion and decreases cell motility; (2) over-expression of the IGF-IR, in the absence of IRS-1, causes growth arrest and (3) a combination of IGF-IR and IRS-1 restores the transformed phenotype of LNCaP cells.

Its overexpression has been implicated in cell transformation and oncogenesis in both in vitro and in vivo models. In this study, we investigated its role in human prostate cancer progression. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin sections of 622 radical prostatectomy specimens, 74 prostatic intraepithelial neoplasm specimens, as well as in 4 normal prostate organ donors assembled into tissue microarrays. We found that both luminal and basal epithelial cells in normal prostate had very low Skp2 levels, but Skp2 levels and labeling frequency increased dramatically in both premalignant lesions of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasm (P = 0.0252) and in prostate cancer (P = 0.0037). The Skp2 labeling frequency in cancer was positively correlated with preoperative serum prostate-specific antigen level (P = 0.0499) and Gleason score (P = 0.0002), whereas the Skp2 index was positively correlated with extraprostatic extension (P = 0.0454), clinical stage (P = 0.0170), as well as Gleason score (P = 0.0002). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that a higher Skp2 labeling index (>10) was a significant predictor of shorter biochemical recurrence-free survival time after radical prostatectomy (P < 0.0363, log-rank test). An inverse correlation of Skp2 was observed with both its biochemical target p27 expression in prostate cancer (P = 0.0003) and with its putative negative regulator, the PTEN tumor suppressor protein (P = 0.0444).

Cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α) is a lipid modifying enzyme by catalyzing the hydrolysis of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipid. The released arachidonic acid and its metabolites contribute to survival and proliferation of prostate cancer cells. In this mini-review, we summarize the relationship between pAKT and cPLA2α in prostate cancer cells. There was a concordant increase in pAKT and cPLA2α levels in prostate tissue of prostate epithelial-specific PTEN-knockout mice compared to PTEN-wild type mice. Restoration of PTEN expression or inhibition of PI3K action decreased cPLA2α expression in PTEN-mutated or deleted prostate cancer cells. An increase in AKT phosphorylation elevated, whereas inhibition of AKT phosphorylation diminished, cPLA2α protein levels. pAKT had no influence on cPLA2α expression at mRNA levels but stabilized cPLA2α at protein levels by protecting it from degradation. Conversely, an induction of cPLA2α expression led to an increase in pAKT levels in PTEN-mutated or deleted prostate cancer cells, while silencing of cPLA2α expression or pharmacological blocking cPLA2α action decreased pAKT levels. The diminishment of pAKT by either genetic silencing or pharmacological blocking of cPLA2α was mitigated by the addition of arachidonic acid. The stimulatory effect of arachidonic acid on pAKT levels was lessened by inhibiting the production of arachidonic acid metabolites. These studies have revealed a link between oncogenic pathway and lipid metabolism and provided potential molecular targets for treating prostate cancer. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"PTEN is the second most mutated tumor suppressor gene other than p53. It suppresses tumorigenesis by dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3) to phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-biphosphate (PIP2), thereby directly inhibiting phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)-mediated tumorigenic activities. Consistent with this model of action, cytosolic PTEN is recruited to the plasma membrane to dephosphorylate PIP3. While nuclear PTEN has been shown to suppress tumorigenesis by governing genome integrity, additional mechanisms may also contribute to nuclear PTEN-mediated tumor suppression. The nuclear protein BMI1 promotes stem cell self-renewal and tumorigenesis and PTEN inhibits these events, suggesting that PTEN may suppress BMI1 function.;We investigated whether PTEN inhibits BMI1 function during prostate tumorigenesis. PTEN binds to BMI1 exclusively in the nucleus. This interaction does not require PTEN's phosphatase activity, as phosphatase-deficient PTEN mutants, PTEN/C124S (CS), PTEN/G129E (GE), and a C-terminal PTEN fragment (C-PTEN) excluding the catalytic domain, all associate with BMI1. Furthermore, the residues 186-286 of C-PTEN are sufficient for binding to BMI1. This interaction reduces BMI1's function. BMI1 enhances hTERT activity and reduces p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF) expression. These effects were attenuated by PTEN, PTEN(CS), PTEN(GE), and C-PTEN. Furthermore, knockdown of PTEN in DU145 cells increased hTERT promoter activity, which was reversed when BMI1 was concomitantly knocked-down, indicating that PTEN reduces hTERT promoter activity via inhibiting BMI1 function. Conversely, BMI1 reduces PTEN's ability to inhibit AKT activation, which can be attributed to its interaction with PTEN in the nucleus, making PTEN unavailable to dephosphorylate membrane-bound PIP3. Furthermore, BMI1 appears to co-localize with PTEN more frequently in clinical prostate tissue samples from patients diagnosed with PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) and carcinoma compared to normal prostate epithelium. While PTEN co-localized with BMI1 in 2.4% of normal prostate epithelial cells, co-localization was observed in 37.6% and 18.5% of cells in PIN and carcinoma, respectively. Collectively, we demonstrate that PTEN inhibits BMI1 function via binding to BMI1 in a phosphatase independent manner.;We demonstrate that nuclear PTEN reduces BMI1 function independently of its phosphatase activity. It was recently observed that nuclear PTEN also suppresses tumorigenesis. Our results, therefore, provide a plausible mechanism by which nuclear PTEN prevents tumorigenesis.",

Genetic lineage-marking demonstrates that rare luminal cells that express Nkx3-1 in the absence of testicular androgens (castration-resistant Nkx3-1-expressing cells, CARNs) are bipotential and can self-renew in vivo, and single-cell transplantation assays show that CARNs can reconstitute prostate ducts in renal grafts. Functional assays of Nkx3-1 mutant mice in serial prostate regeneration suggest that Nkx3-1 is required for stem cell maintenance. Furthermore, targeted deletion of the Pten tumour suppressor gene in CARNs results in rapid carcinoma formation after androgen-mediated regeneration.

Protocol-defined progression included a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level ≥ 0.4 ng/mL, radiologic/clinical recurrence, or death. Univariate and multivariable proportional hazards regression analyses were used to investigate the influence of PTEN status (and other protein markers) on progression-free survival (PFS).;In this exploratory, post hoc analysis, PTEN protein loss (vs presence) was observed in 61% of patients and was associated with lower preoperative PSA levels, higher clinical stage, lower Ki67 expression, the presence of p53, and the presence of ERG. In univariate analysis, the factors associated with PFS included Gleason sum, seminal vesicle invasion, PTEN status, MYC expression, and Ki67 expression. In multivariable analysis, only 3 variables emerged as independent prognostic factors for PFS: PTEN status (P = .035), MYC expression (P = .001), and Ki67 expression (P < .001). A prognostic model was constructed that incorporated clinical covariates as well as information on PTEN, MYC, and Ki67.;The current results indicated that PTEN status, MYC expression, and Ki67 expression in primary tumor samples may predict PFS more accurately than clinical factors alone in men with high-risk prostate cancer who receive adjuvant docetaxel after prostatectomy.

Here we show they function in prostate tumor suppression in the mouse. Concomitant inactivation of Spry1 and Spry2 in prostate epithelium causes ductal hyperplasia and low-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). However, when Spry1 and Spry2 loss-of-function occurs in the context of heterozygosity for a null allele of the tumor suppressor gene Pten, there is a striking increase in PIN and evidence of neoplastic invasion. Conversely, expression of a Spry2 gain-of-function transgene in Pten null prostatic epithelium suppresses the tumorigenic effects of loss of Pten function. We show that Sprouty gene loss-of-function results in hyperactive RAS/ERK1/2 signaling throughout the prostate epithelium and cooperates with heterozygosity for a Pten null allele to promote hyperactive PI3K/AKT signaling. Furthermore, Spry2 gain-of-function can suppress hyperactivation of AKT caused by the absence of PTEN. Together, these results point to a key genetic interaction between Sprouty genes and Pten in prostate tumorigenesis and provide strong evidence that Sprouty genes can function to modulate signaling via the RAS/ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT pathways. The finding that Sprouty genes suppress tumorigenesis caused by Pten loss-of-function suggests that therapeutic approaches aimed at restoring normal feedback mechanisms triggered by receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, including Sprouty gene expression, may provide an effective strategy to delay or prevent high-grade PIN and invasive prostate cancer.",

Acute prostatitis was characterized by recruitment of adoptively transferred OT-I cells and importantly, autologous CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells (Treg). In concert with leukocyte infiltration elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were observed. Inflammation also resulted in marked epithelial cell proliferation that was sustained up to 80 days post adoptive transfer of OT-I cells.;The POET-3 model represents a novel mouse model to study both acute and chronic prostate inflammation in an antigen-specific system. Further, the POET-3 mouse model can be crossed with other genetic models of disease such as the C57/Luc/Pten(-/-) model of prostate cancer, allowing the impact of prostatitis on other prostatic diseases to be evaluated.",

As chromosomal comparative genomic hybridization (cCGH) data was available for these samples, we compared the sensitivity and overall concordance of the two methodologies, and used the combined information to infer the best of three different aCGH scoring approaches.;Our data demonstrate that the reliability of aCGH in the analysis of primary prostate carcinomas depends to some extent on the scoring approach used, with the breakpoint estimation method being the most sensitive and reliable. The pattern of copy number changes detected by aCGH was concordant with that of cCGH, but the higher resolution technique detected 2.7 times more aberrations and 15.2% more carcinomas with genomic imbalances. We additionally show that several aberrations were consistently overlooked using cCGH, such as small deletions at 5q, 6q, 12p, and 17p. The latter were validated by fluorescence in situ hybridization targeting TP53, although only one carcinoma harbored a point mutation in this gene. Strikingly, homozygous deletions at 10q23.31, encompassing the PTEN locus, were seen in 58% of the cases with 10q loss.;We conclude that aCGH can significantly improve the detection of genomic aberrations in cancer cells as compared to previously established whole-genome methodologies, although contamination with normal cells may influence the sensitivity and specificity of some scoring approaches. Our work delineated recurrent copy number changes and revealed novel amplified loci and frequent homozygous deletions in primary prostate carcinomas, which may guide future work aimed at identifying the relevant target genes. In particular, biallelic loss seems to be a frequent mechanism of inactivation of the PTEN gene in prostate carcinogenesis.",

The tissue samples were subjected to RNA extraction and subsequently to cDNA synthesis according to the kit manufacturer's protocol. Quantitative Real-Time PCR assay was performed for each sample in triplicate reactions. REST and SPSS software were used to statistically analyze PTEN and NKX3.1 gene expression data.

The results of Chi-Square analysis revealed a significant correlation between the expression of these genes in both BPH and cancer groups (P=0.004 and 0.001, respectively).

We now show that AKT activation and activity are markedly increased in androgen-independent, prostate-specific antigen-positive prostate cancer cells (LNAI cells) established from xenograft tumors of the androgen-dependent LNCaP cell line. These LNAI cells show increased expression of integrin-linked kinase, which is putatively responsible for AKT activation/Ser-473 phosphorylation, as well as for increased phosphorylation of the AKT target protein, BAD. Furthermore, expression of the p27(Kip1) cell cycle regulator was diminished in LNAI cells, consistent with the notion that AKT directly inhibits AFX/Forkhead-mediated transcription of p27(Kip1). To assess directly the impact of increased AKT activity on prostate cancer progression, an activated hAKT1 mutant was overexpressed in LNCaP cells, resulting in a 6-fold increase in xenograft tumor growth. Like LNAI cells, these transfectants showed dramatically reduced p27(Kip1) expression. Together, these data implicate increased AKT activity in prostate tumor progression and androgen independence and suggest that diminished p27(Kip1) expression, which has been repeatedly associated with prostate cancer progression, may be a consequence of increased AKT activity.",

Studies demonstrate that IDC-P is strongly associated with high-grade (Gleason grades 4/5), large-volume invasive prostate cancers. In addition, recent genetic studies indicate that IDC-P represents intraductal spread of invasive carcinoma, rather than a precursor lesion. Some of the architectural patterns in IDC-P exhibit architectural overlap with one of the main differential diagnoses, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN). In these instances, additional diagnostic criteria for IDC-P, including marked nuclear pleomorphism, non-focal comedonecrosis (>1 duct showing comedonecrosis), markedly distended normal ducts/acini, positive nuclear staining for ERG, and cytoplasmic loss of PTEN by immunohistochemistry, can help make the distinction. This distinction between IDC-P and HGPIN is of critical importance because IDC-P has an almost constant association with invasive carcinoma and has negative clinical implications, including shorter relapse-free survival, early biochemical relapse, and metastatic failure rate after radiotherapy. Therefore, IDC-P should be reported in prostate biopsies and radical prostatectomies, regardless of the presence of an invasive component.

The lack of our understanding of underlying genetic alterations for the transition from androgen-dependent (AD) to ADI prostate cancer growth hampers our ability to develop target-driven therapeutic strategies for the efficient treatment of ADI prostate cancer.;By screening a library of activated human kinases, we have identified TPL2, encoding a serine/threonine kinase, as driving ADI prostate cancer growth. TPL2 activation by over-expressing either wild-type or a constitutively activated form of TPL2 induced ADI growth, whereas the suppression of TPL2 expression and its kinase activity in ADI prostate cancer cells inhibited cell proliferation under androgen-depleted conditions. Most importantly, TPL2 is upregulated in ADI prostate cancers of both the Pten deletion mouse model and the clinical prostate cancer specimens.;Together these data suggest that TPL2 kinase plays a critical role in the promotion of ADI prostate cancer progression.

        "Doc_abstract":"A major challenge to oncolytic virus therapy is that individual cancers vary in their sensitivity to oncolytic viruses, even when these cancers arise from the same tissue type. Variability in response may arise due to differences in the initial genetic lesions leading to cancer development. Alternatively, susceptibility to viral oncolysis may change during cancer progression. These hypotheses were tested using cells from a transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Primary cultures from murine cancers derived from prostate-specific Pten deletion contained a mixture of cells that were susceptible and resistant to VSV. Castration-resistant cancers contained a higher percentage of susceptible cells than cancers from noncastrated mice. These results indicate both susceptible and resistant cells can evolve within the same tumor. The role of Pten deletion was further investigated using clonal populations of murine prostate epithelial (MPE) progenitor cells and tumor-derived Pten(-/-) cells. Deletion of Pten in MPE progenitor cells using a lentivirus vector resulted in cells that responded poorly to interferon and were susceptible to VSV infection. In contrast, tumor-derived Pten(-/-) cells expressed higher levels of the antiviral transcription factor STAT1, activated STAT1 in response to VSV, and were resistant to VSV infection. These results suggest that early in tumor development following Pten deletion, cells are primarily sensitive to VSV, but subsequent evolution in tumors leads to development of cells that are resistant to VSV infection. Further evolution in castration-resistant tumors leads to tumors in which cells are primarily sensitive to VSV.;There has been a great deal of progress in the development of replication-competent viruses that kill cancer cells (oncolytic viruses). However, a major problem is that individual cancers vary in their sensitivity to oncolytic viruses, even when these cancers arise from the same tissue type. The experiments presented here were to determine whether both sensitive and resistant cells are present in prostate cancers originating from a single genetic lesion in transgenic mice, prostate-specific deletion of the gene for the tumor suppressor Pten. The results indicate that murine prostate cancers are composed of both cells that are sensitive and cells that are resistant to oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Furthermore, androgen deprivation led to castration-resistant prostate cancers that were composed primarily of cells that were sensitive to VSV. These results are encouraging for the use of VSV for the treatment of prostate cancers that are resistant to androgen deprivation therapy.",

Using genetically engineered mice, we show that inactivation of the pRb family proteins (Rb/p107/p130) induces epithelial proliferation and apoptosis and is sufficient to produce prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions. Over time, adenocarcinomas develop in all mice with no evidence of neuroendocrine tumors. Apoptosis is dependent on Pten function and not p53, unlike other epithelial cell types tested previously. Consequently, Pten hemizygosity reduces apoptosis by 50%, accelerating progression to adenocarcinomas with heterogeneous composition. Heterogeneity is associated with concurrent Pten haploinsufficiency and focal selective progression to complete Pten loss, which yields distinct tumor properties.

To investigate the role of Cav-1 in prostate cancer onset and progression, we interbred Cav-1(-/-) null mice with a TRAMP (transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate) model that spontaneously develops advanced prostate cancer and metastatic disease. We found that, although the loss of Cav-1 did not affect the appearance of minimally invasive prostate cancer, its absence significantly impeded progression to highly invasive and metastatic disease. Inactivation of one (+/-) or both (-/-) alleles of Cav-1 resulted in significant reductions in prostate tumor burden, as well as decreases in regional lymph node metastases. Moreover, further examination revealed decreased metastasis to distant organs, such as the lungs, in TRAMP/Cav-1(-/-) mice. Utilizing prostate carcinoma cell lines (C1, C2, and C3) derived from TRAMP tumors, we also showed a positive correlation between Cav-1 expression and the ability of these cells to form tumors in vivo. Furthermore, down-regulation of Cav-1 expression in these cells, using a small interfering RNA approach, significantly reduced their tumorigenic and metastatic potential. Mechanistically, we showed that loss or down-regulation of Cav-1 expression results in increased apoptosis, with increased prostate apoptosis response factor-4 and PTEN levels in Cav-1(-/-) null prostate tumors.

Analysis of human prostate tissues, xenograft and transgenic mouse models of prostate cancer, and prostate cancer cell lines has provided support for the role of MTA1 in advanced disease and its potential role in initial stages of prostate tumor progression. Recent discoveries have highlighted a critical role for MTA1 in inflammation-triggered prostate tumorigenesis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, prostate cancer survival pathways, and site metastasis. Evidence for MTA1 as an upstream negative regulator of tumor suppressor genes such as p53 and PTEN has also emerged. MTA1 is involved in prostate tumor angiogenesis by regulating several pro-angiogenic factors. Evidence for MTA1 as a prognostic marker for aggressive prostate cancer and disease recurrence has been described.

Active surveillance and watchful waiting are increasingly recommended to patients with small tumors felt to be low risk, highlighting the difficulties of Gleason scoring in this setting. There is an urgent need for predictive biomarkers that can be rapidly deployed to aid in clinical decision-making. Our objectives were to assess the incidence and ability of PTEN alterations to predict aggressive disease in a multicenter study.;We used recently developed probes optimized for sensitivity and specificity in a four-color FISH deletion assay to study the Canary Retrospective multicenter Prostate Cancer Tissue Microarray (TMA). This TMA was constructed specifically for biomarker validation from radical prostatectomy specimens, and is accompanied by detailed clinical information with long-term follow-up.;In 612 prostate cancers, the overall rate of PTEN deletion was 112 (18.3%). Hemizygous PTEN losses were present in 55/612 (9.0%) of cancers, whereas homozygous PTEN deletion was observed in 57/612 (9.3%) of tumors. Significant associations were found between PTEN status and pathologic stage (P < 0.0001), seminal vesicle invasion (P = 0.0008), extracapsular extension (P < 0.0001), and Gleason score (P = 0.0002). In logistic regression analysis of clinical and pathological variables, PTEN deletion was significantly associated with extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle involvement, and higher Gleason score. In the 406 patients in which clinical information was available, PTEN homozygous (P = 0.009) deletion was associated with worse post-operative recurrence-free survival (number of events = 189), pre-operative prostate specific antigen (PSA) (P < 0.001), and pathologic stage (P = 0.03).;PTEN status assessed by FISH is an independent predictor for recurrence-free survival in multivariate models, as were seminal vesicle invasion, extracapsular extension, and Gleason score, and preoperative PSA. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that the assay can be readily introduced at first diagnosis in a cost effective manner analogous to the use of FISH for analysis of HER2/neu status in breast cancer. Combined with published research beginning 17 years ago, both the data and tools now exist to implement a PTEN assay in the clinic.",

Transformation and progression towards malignancy in prostate cancer is dependant on the inability of the prostatic epithelial cells to undergo apoptosis rather than on the regulation of proliferation. Molecular targeting of inadequacies in this process of suppression of apoptosis could prove to be of great therapeutic importance for prostate cancer patients. Existence of tissue specific promoters to aid in the delivery of genes with therapeutic potential makes molecular therapy an attractive option. This review discusses salient features of molecules such as, Bcl-2, Bcl-(XL), NF-kappaB, Akt, PTEN and Par-4 that play a significant role in the regulation of prostate cancer and focuses on the prospects of effectively utilizing their potential for the therapy of hormone-sensitive and hormone-resistant prostate cancer.",

Microdissected tissue included morphologically normal foci, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostatic adenocarcinoma. LOH analysis was performed using 4 microsatellite markers that map in the region of the 1q24 to 25 locus of the putative prostate cancer susceptibility gene HPC1 and 4 that map in the region of the 10q23 locus of the PTEN gene.;The incidence of LOH on 10q was consistent with that previously reported in prostatic tumors. LOH associated with the PTEN locus was recorded in morphologically normal foci, BPH and adenocarcinoma. Sequence analysis of PTEN in a limited number of lesions revealed mutations in nontumor and tumor tissue. Analysis of the DS10215 locus showed significant LOH in tumor but not in benign tissue, suggestive of a tumor suppressor gene in this region associated with prostatic neoplastic progression. In contrast, no significant LOH was observed in the same tissues at 4 loci on chromosome 1q. In this study we recorded elevated levels of microsatellite instability in benign prostatic tissue with an additional increase associated with prostatic adenocarcinoma.;The low incidence of LOH in the region of the HPC1 locus in all prostate lesions studied suggests that this putative hereditary prostate cancer susceptibility locus does not appear to have a role in sporadic prostate cancer, at least not in the context of LOH. In contrast, analysis of the same tissues for LOH at chromosome 10q confirmed frequent alterations in this region linked to late stage prostate cancer.

In the estrogen receptor-deficient breast cancer cells and the androgen-insensitive prostate cells, the amount of Akt3 enzymatic activity was approximately 20-60-fold higher than in the cells that were estrogen- or androgen-responsive. In contrast, the levels of Akt1 and -2 were not increased in these cells. The increase in Akt3 enzyme activity correlated with an increase in both Akt3 mRNA and protein. In a prostate cancer cell line lacking the tumor suppressor PTEN (a lipid and protein phosphatase), the basal enzymatic activity of Akt3 was constitutively elevated and represented the major active Akt in these cells. Finally, reverse transcription-PCR was used to examine the Akt3 expression in 27 primary breast carcinomas. The expression levels of Akt3 were significantly higher in the estrogen receptor-negative tumors in comparison to the estrogen receptor-positive tumors. To see if the increase in Akt3 could be due to chromosomal abnormalities, the Akt3 gene was assigned to human chromosome 1q44 by fluorescence in situ hybridization and radiation hybrid cell panel analyses.

Employing essentially non-prostate cell lines, we previously showed that statins rapidly downregulate nuclear levels of phosphorylated Akt via P2X7, a purinergic receptor recently implicated in invasive growth. Here, we present studies on phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN)-positive prostatic cells. We document an involvement of EH domain-binding protein 1 (EHBP1), previously associated with aggressive prostate cancer and insulin-stimulated trafficking and cell migration, in P2X7 signaling. We also show that EHBP1 is essential for an anti-invasive effect of atorvastatin. Furthermore, EHBP1 interacted with P-Rex1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor previously implicated in invasive growth. Mevalonate did not prevent this anti-invasive effect of atorvastatin. These data indicate that atorvastatin modulates invasiveness via P2X7, EHBP1 and P-Rex1. Interestingly, the interaction between EHBP1 and P-Rex1 was not induced by extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the endogenous P2X7 ligand, and statins counteracted invasiveness stimulated by extracellular ATP. In support of these experimental data, a population-based genetic analysis showed that a loss of function allele in the P2X7 gene (rs3751143) associated with non-aggressive cancer, and the common allele with aggressive cancer. Our data indicate a novel signaling pathway that inhibits invasiveness and that is druggable.

Two microsatellite markers surrounding PTEN were used to test the co-segregation of 10 rare variants, which may give rise to highly penetrance in HPC. Two common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were evaluated in the 188 HPC families using a family-based association study approach. To study low penetrant SNPs in PCa susceptibility, 33 SNPs covering PTEN were selected from the whole genome-wide association studies (GWAS) from our available case-control studies in Sweden (Cancer of the Prostate in Sweden (CAPS)) and the publicly available cancer genetic markers of susceptibility (CGEMS) study.

This lack of efficacy has prompted the development of alternative treatment strategies. In the present study we investigate the effects of the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib in a genetically engineered mouse model of prostate cancer and explore the rational combination with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus.;Conditional prostate specific PTEN-deficient knockout mice were utilized to determine the pharmacodynamic and chemopreventive effects of sorafenib. This mouse model was also used to examine the therapeutic efficacy of sorafenib alone or in combination with everolimus. Preclinical efficacy was assessed by comparing the reduction of tumor burden, proliferation, angiogenesis and the induction of apoptosis. Molecular responses were assessed by immunohistochemical, TUNEL and western blot assays.;Pharmacodynamic analysis revealed that a single dose of sorafenib decreased activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis at doses of 30-60 mg/kg, but activated JAK/STAT3 signaling. Levels of cleaved casapase-3 increased in a dose dependent manner. Chemoprevention studies showed that chronic sorafenib administration was capable of inhibiting tumor progression through the reduction of cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis and the induction of apoptosis. In intervention models of established castration-naïve and castration-resistant prostate cancer, treatment with sorafenib provided modest but statistically insignificant reduction in tumor burden. However, sorafenib significantly inhibited cancer cell proliferation and MVD but had minimal effects on the induction of apoptosis. Interestingly, the administration of sorafenib increased the expression levels of the androgen receptor, p-GSK3β and p-ERK1/2 in castration-resistant prostate cancers. In both intervention models, combination therapy demonstrated a clear tendency of enhanced antitumor effects over monotherapy. Notably, the treatment combination of sorafenib and everolimus overcame therapeutic escape from single agent therapy in castration-resistant prostate cancers.;In summary, we provide insights into the molecular responses of sorafenib therapy in a clinically relevant model of prostate cancer and present preclinical evidence for the development of targeted treatment strategies based on the use of multikinase inhibitors in combination with mTOR inhibitors for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.",

Previously published reports from other organ systems led us to investigate a mechanistic relationship between PTEN and BMP signaling in prostate epithelial cells.;We analyzed growth rate and PTEN expression in E6, BPH-1, and C4-2B prostate epithelial cells treated with BMP-4. We also treated doxacyclin-inducible PTEN-C4-2B cells with BMP-4 and doxacyclin to determine the effect of BMP on growth and PTEN expression in conditions of increasing PTEN expression. We determined the dependency of BMP-mediated growth inhibition via siRNA knockdown of PTEN expression and BMP treatment. We determined PTEN protein stability by determining the effect of BMP-4 on PTEN protein at time points after treatment with cyclohexamide, a translation inhibitor.;We found that BMP-4 induces PTEN in E6 and BPH-1 cells and reduces proliferation. Knockdown of PTEN attenuated the growth-inhibiting effects of BMP-4 in these cells. BMP-4 had no effect in PTEN-negative C4-2B cells, but doxacyclin-driven PTEN C4-2B cells responded to BMP-4 with enhanced PTEN and growth inhibition. BMP-4 also increased PTEN protein stability.;BMP signaling induces PTEN expression and sustains PTEN protein expression resulting in inhibition of prostate epithelial cell growth. These data are the first to identify a mechanistic linkage between BMP signaling and PTEN in the prostate, both of which are independently identified as tumor suppressors and suggest possible coordinate dysregulation in prostate cancer.",

Restoring PTEN activity in cancer cells through gene therapy has shown to inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis, particularly in cells with a PTEN deficiency. Gene therapy, however, comes with some inherent risks such as triggering an immune response and permanent off target effects. Nanoparticle assisted protein delivery could mitigate these liabilities while maintaining therapeutic integrity. In this report, we evaluated the use of cationic lipid-like (lipidoid) materials to intracellularly deliver the PTEN protein. We synthesized a small library of cationic lipidoid materials and screened for the delivery of PTEN based on cell viability. The lipidoid material EC16-80 was selected for high efficacy and the subsequent lipidoid-protein complex was characterized using DLS, zeta potential, and TEM. Intracellular delivery of PTEN with EC16-80 to the PTEN deficient prostate cancer cell line PC-3 resulted in a significant decrease in activated AKT and induced apoptosis.

Prostatic adult stem cells, transit amplifying/intermediate cells (TA/ICs), and luminal cells were individually modeled within a three-dimensional reconstruction of a prostate duct. Different movement behaviors for TA/ICs and luminal cells were assessed by their ability to recreate experimental patterns of prostate cell proliferation and epithelial morphology. Strongly directed TA/IC movement toward the distal region of the prostate duct combined with weakly directed luminal cell movement toward the proximal region of the prostate duct was able to best recreate experimental patterns of prostate proliferation and morphology. The effects on cell mobility from abnormalities in PTEN and thymosin beta15 (Tbeta15), genes which are commonly altered in prostate cancer, were simulated in the model.

We show that ZBTB7A physically interacts with SOX9 and functionally antagonizes its transcriptional activity on key target genes such as MIA, which is involved in tumor cell invasion, and H19, a long noncoding RNA precursor for an RB-targeting microRNA. Inactivation of Zbtb7a in vivo leads to Rb downregulation, PICS bypass and invasive prostate cancer.

However, the molecular events underlying this critical transition are poorly understood. One of the important genes that might play a role in CaP development is the PTEN gene. At the present time, there has been no systematic analysis of the incidence of genomic PTEN deletion by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in CaP and associated preneoplastic histologic lesions. This study assesses the frequency of PTEN deletion by interphase FISH analysis in CaP and prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia (PIN). Dual-color FISH was performed using DNA probes for bands 10q23.3 (PTEN locus) and chromosome 10 centromere using 35 radical prostatectomy specimens. PTEN deletions were not found in 3/3 of stroma, 6/6 samples of benign glandular epithelium, and 12/12 samples of low-grade PIN. However, PTEN deletions were found in 3/13 (23%) of high-grade PIN and 24/35 (68%) of CaP. Concordance was observed between PTEN deletion status and the overall cellular PTEN protein expression levels, as assessed by immunohistochemistry. The high frequency of PTEN deletion observed in CaP versus precursor lesions implicates a pivotal role for PTEN haploinsufficiency in the transition from preneoplastic PIN to CaP. Moreover, this observation is an important consideration for novel therapeutic trials in CaP in which biologic efficacy is influenced by the activity level of PTEN. These findings draw attention to the usefulness of this relatively simple FISH assay for future applications in clinical laboratories.",

One strategy to decrease the risk of death from this disease is screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA); however, the extent of benefit and harm with such screening is under continuous debate.;In December, 1994, 20,000 men born between 1930 and 1944, randomly sampled from the population register, were randomised by computer in a 1:1 ratio to either a screening group invited for PSA testing every 2 years (n=10,000) or to a control group not invited (n=10,000). Men in the screening group were invited up to the upper age limit (median 69, range 67-71 years) and only men with raised PSA concentrations were offered additional tests such as digital rectal examination and prostate biopsies. The primary endpoint was prostate-cancer specific mortality, analysed according to the intention-to-screen principle. The study is ongoing, with men who have not reached the upper age limit invited for PSA testing. This is the first planned report on cumulative prostate-cancer incidence and mortality calculated up to Dec 31, 2008. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial ISRCTN54449243.;In each group, 48 men were excluded from the analysis because of death or emigration before the randomisation date, or prevalent prostate cancer. In men randomised to screening, 7578 (76%) of 9952 attended at least once. During a median follow-up of 14 years, 1138 men in the screening group and 718 in the control group were diagnosed with prostate cancer, resulting in a cumulative prostate-cancer incidence of 12.7% in the screening group and 8.2% in the control group (hazard ratio 1.64; 95% CI 1.50-1.80; p<0.0001). The absolute cumulative risk reduction of death from prostate cancer at 14 years was 0.40% (95% CI 0.17-0.64), from 0.90% in the control group to 0.50% in the screening group. The rate ratio for death from prostate cancer was 0.56 (95% CI 0.39-0.82; p=0.002) in the screening compared with the control group.

Tumors from mice on the omega-3 diet had lower proportions of phosphorylated Bad and higher apoptotic indexes compared with those from mice on omega-6 diet. Knockdown of Bad eliminated omega-3-induced cell death, and introduction of exogenous Bad restored the sensitivity to omega-3 fatty acids.

In addition, Pten(+/-) mice develop tumors in multiple organs because of the activation of the PI3K signaling cascade. Because activation of PI3K signaling leads to feedback inhibition of insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS2) expression, an upstream activator of PI3K, we therefore anticipated that IRS2 expression would be low in tumors that lack PTEN. Surprisingly, however, an elevation of IRS2 was often detected in tumor samples in which PTEN levels were compromised. To determine the potential contribution of Irs2 to tumor progression, Pten(+/-) mice were crossed with Irs2(+/-) mice. Deletion of Irs2 did not affect the initiation of neoplasia found in Pten(+/-) mice but suppressed cancer cell growth, proliferation, and invasion through the basement membrane. Deletion of Irs2 also attenuated the expression of Myc in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia in Pten(+/-) mice.

We determined that enterolactone at 20 μM significantly restricted the proliferation of mid and late stage models of prostate disease. These effects were strongly associated with changes in the expression of the DNA licencing genes (GMNN, CDT1, MCM2 and 7), in reduced expression of the miR-106b cluster (miR-106b, miR-93, and miR-25), and in increased expression of the PTEN tumour suppressor gene.

Gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps are also present in Cowden syndrome (CS; MIM 158350) and Bannayan-Zonana syndrome (BZS; also called Ruvalcaba-Myhre-Smith syndrome; MIM 153480). The susceptibility locus for both CS and BZS has recently been identified as the novel tumor suppressor gene PTEN, encoding a dual specificity phosphatase, located at 10q23.3. A putative JPS locus, JP1, which most likely functions as a tumor suppressor, had previously been mapped to 10q22-24 in both familial and sporadic juvenile polyps. Given the shared clinical features of gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps among the three syndromes and the coincident mapping of JP1 to the region of PTEN, we sought to determine whether JPS was allelic to CS and BZS by mutation analysis of PTEN and linkage approaches. Microsatellite markers spanning the CS/BZS locus (D10S219, D10S551, D10S579, and D10S541) were used to compute multipoint lod scores in eight informative families with JPS. Lod scores of < -2.0 were generated for the entire region, thus excluding PTEN and any genes within the flanking 20-cM interval as candidate loci for familial JPS under our statistical models. In addition, analysis of PTEN using a combination of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and direct sequencing was unable to identify a germline mutation in 14 families with JPS and 11 sporadic cases. Therefore, at least a proportion of JPS cases are not caused by germline PTEN alteration or by an alternative locus at 10q22-24.",

Targeting TRAP-1 with a novel class of mitochondria-directed Hsp90 inhibitors, ie, Gamitrinibs, caused rapid and complete killing of androgen-dependent or -independent prostate cancer, but not BPH-1 cells, whereas reintroduction of TRAP-1 in BPH-1 cells conferred sensitivity to Gamitrinib-induced cell death.

We analyzed the possible involvement of PTEN in peptide-growth factor-dependent cell growth in endometrial carcinoma cells. PTEN-null Ishikawa cells were efficiently infected with recombinant adenovirus at 20 MOI (multiplicity of infection) to express PTEN protein. In PTEN-IK cells, phospho-Akt/PKB was down-regulated regardless of the consistent expression of Akt/PKB. The cell growth of parental IK cells was significantly stimulated by EGF and IGF-I, and PTEN-IK cells were further sensitized to the EGF-or IGF-I-growth stimulation. EGFR antibody could completely compromise the stimulatory effects of EGF in both cell lines. Wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor, or UO126, a MAPK inhibitor, partly suppressed EGF-mediated cell growth stimulation in both cell lines. EGF augmented the level of phospho-Akt/PKB of PTEN-IK cells more effectively than that of parental IK cells.

However, whether and how parthenolide enhances tumor sensitivity to radiation therapy are unknown. In this study, we show that inhibition of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway is a common mechanism for the radiosensitization effect of parthenolide in prostate cancer cells LNCaP, DU 145, and PC3. Parthenolide inhibits radiation-induced NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity and the expression of its downstream target sod2, the gene coding for an important antiapoptotic and antioxidant enzyme (manganese superoxide dismutase) in the three prostate cancer cells. Different susceptibilities to parthenolide's effect are observed in two radioresistant cancer cells, DU 145 and PC3, with DU 145 cells showing higher sensitivity. This differential susceptibility to parthenolide is due, in part, to the fact that in addition to NF-kappaB inhibition, parthenolide activates the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt prosurvival pathway in both cell lines. However, the activated Akt in DU 145 cells is kept at a relatively low level compared with that in PC3 cells due to the presence of functional PTEN. Transfection of wild-type PTEN into PTEN-null cells, PC3, confers the enhanced radiosensitization effect of parthenolide in PTEN-expressing cells. When PTEN expression is knocked down in DU 145 cells, the cells become more resistant to parthenolide's effect. Taken together, these results suggest that parthenolide inhibits the NF-kappaB pathway and activates the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt pathway in prostate cancer cells. The radiosensitization effect of parthenolide is due, in part, to the inhibition of the NF-kappaB pathway. The presence of PTEN enhances the radiosensitization effect of parthenolide, in part, by suppressing the absolute amount of activated p-Akt.",

Here, we determined how the tumourigenic phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT), tumour-suppressive phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) pathways are integrated via the metastasis suppressor, N-myc downstream-regulated gene-1 (NDRG1). Moreover, we assessed how the novel anti-tumour agent, Dp44mT, may target these integrated pathways by increasing NDRG1 expression.;Protein expression in Dp44mT-treated normal human prostate epithelial cells and prostate cancer cells (PC-3, DU145) was assessed by western blotting. The role of NDRG1 was examined by transfection using an NDRG1 overexpression vector or shRNA.;Dp44mT increased levels of tumour-suppressive PTEN, and decreased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and SMAD2L, which are regulated by oncogenic Ras/MAPK signalling. Importantly, the effects of Dp44mT on NDRG1 and p-SMAD2L expression were more marked in prostate cancer cells than normal prostate epithelial cells. This may partly explain the anti-tumour selectivity of these agents. Silencing NDRG1 expression increased phosphorylation of tumourigenic AKT, ERK1/2 and SMAD2L and decreased PTEN levels, whereas NDRG1 overexpression induced the opposite effect. Furthermore, NDRG1 silencing significantly reduced the ability of Dp44mT to suppress p-SMAD2L and p-ERK1/2 levels.;NDRG1 has an important role in mediating the tumour-suppressive effects of Dp44mT in prostate cancer via selective targeting of the PI3K/AKT, TGF-β and ERK pathways.",

Identifying factors that regulate the spread of tumor into the regional nodes and distant sites would guide the development of novel diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic targets. The aim of our study was to examine the expression and biological role of EphB4 in prostate cancer. EphB4 mRNA is expressed in 64 of 72 (89%) prostate tumor tissues assessed. EphB4 protein expression is found in the majority (41 of 62, 66%) of tumors, and 3 of 20 (15%) normal prostate tissues. Little or no expression was observed in benign prostate epithelial cell line, but EphB4 was expressed in all prostate cancer cell lines to varying degrees. EphB4 protein levels are high in the PC3 prostate cancer cell line and several folds higher in a metastatic clone of PC3 (PC3M) where overexpression was accompanied by EphB4 gene amplification. EphB4 expression is induced by loss of PTEN, p53, and induced by epidermal growth factor/epidermal growth factor receptor and insulin-like growth factor-I/insulin-like growth factor-IR. Knockdown of the EphB4 protein using EphB4 short interfering RNA or antisense oligodeoxynucleotide significantly inhibits cell growth/viability, migration, and invasion, and induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotide targeting EphB4 in vivo showed antitumor activity in murine human tumor xenograft model.

Loss of heterozygosity affecting this region of 10q is observed in several cancer types, especially glioblastoma, and inactivating mutations of the PTEN/MMAC1 gene are found in some of these cancers as well as cell lines and xenografts. Breast cancer is among the tumor types in which mutations are documented, and germline mutations of the gene appear to be responsible for the rare autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome known as Cowden disease, which includes breast cancer among its clinical features. To further determine the role that PTEN/MMAC1 mutations may play in breast tumorigenesis, the entire coding region was screened for mutations in 54 unselected primary breast cancers. Two mutations were identified, a somatic 2-bp deletion in an apparently sporadic breast cancer, and a germ-line 4-bp deletion in a breast cancer patient with a clinical history consistent with Cowden disease. These data indicate that somatic mutations of PTEN/ MMAC1 occur in only a small fraction of primary breast cancers and confirm the role of this gene in the etiology of Cowden disease. Evidence is also presented suggesting that numerous polymorphisms and missense variants exist in the PTEN/MMAC1 transcript.",

MAGI-2 gene rearrangements have recently been described in prostate cancer. We studied the immunohistochemical expression of MAGI-2 protein in prostate tissue. Seventy-eight radical prostatectomies were used to construct 3 tissue microarrays consisting of 512 cores, including benign tissue, benign prostatic hyperplasia, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), and adenocarcinoma, Gleason patterns 3 to 5. Immunohistochemistry for phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) and double-stain MAGI-2/p63 was performed and analyzed by visual and image analysis, the latter as percent of analyzed area (%AREA), and mean optical density multiplied by %AREA (STAIN). By visual and image analysis, MAGI-2 was significantly higher in adenocarcinoma and HGPIN compared with benign (benign versus HGPIN P < .001; benign versus adenocarcinoma, P < .001). HGPIN and adenocarcinoma did not significantly differ by either modality. Using visual intensity to distinguish benign tissue and adenocarcinoma, a receiver operating curve yielded an area under the curve of 0.902. A STAIN threshold of 1470 yielded a sensitivity of 0.66 and specificity of 0.96. There was a significant correlation between PTEN and MAGI-2 staining for normal and benign prostatic hyperplasia, but this was lost in HGPIN and cancer. We conclude that MAGI-2 immunoreactivity is elevated in prostate cancer and HGPIN compared with normal tissue, and suggest that MAGI-2 may contribute to prostate carcinogenesis.

Several mechanisms of cell defense can be turned on in one cell. The interconnections between different mechanisms involved in drug resistance are poorly studied. In the present study we used PC3 and DU145 human prostate cell lines to show that PTEN functional status determines level of cell resistance to some drugs, it correlates with expression level of MRP1 and BCRP proteins. We showed that Pgp is not involved in development of drug resistance in these cells. Transfection of PTEN into PTEN-deficient PC3 as well as rapamycin treatment caused the inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling and resulted in cell sensitization to the action of doxorubicin and vinblastine. We showed that PTEN transfection leads to the change in expression of MRP1 and BCRP. Our results show that in prostate cancer cells at least two mechanisms of drug resistance are interconnected.

We subsequently used immunohistochemistry to examine KLLN expression and association with Gleason grade and score in 109 prostatectomy samples. KLLN's tumor-suppressive effect was studied in androgen-dependent and androgen-independent cell models.;Patients were diagnosed with peripheral zone prostate carcinomas without metastasis at the time of prostatectomy. Each patient's primary tumor comprised at least 2 tumoral regions with different Gleason grades.;KLLN expression decreased from normal prostate tissue to primary carcinomas (P < .0001). The loss of epithelial and stromal KLLN expression is associated with poor differentiation and high Gleason scores (P < .0001), consistent with our in vitro observation that KLLN inhibits tumor cell proliferation and invasiveness. KLLN decreases prostate-specific antigen levels and suppresses androgen-mediated cell growth by inhibiting androgen receptor (AR) transcription. As an androgen receptor-regulated target, KLLN also functions as a transcriptional activator, directly promoting the expression of TP53 and TP73, with consequent elevated apoptosis, regardless of AR status.;Our observations suggest that KLLN is a transcription factor directly regulating AR, TP53, and TP73 expression, with a role in prostate carcinogenesis.

Here, we show that while PTK6 is located primarily within the cytoplasm, the pool of active PTK6 in prostate cancer cells localizes to membranes. Ectopic expression of membrane-targeted active PTK6 promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition in part by enhancing activation of AKT, thereby stimulating cancer cell migration and metastases in xenograft models of prostate cancer. Conversely, siRNA-mediated silencing of endogenous PTK6 promoted an epithelial phenotype and impaired tumor xenograft growth. In mice, PTEN deficiency caused endogenous active PTK6 to localize at membranes in association with decreased E-cadherin expression. Active PTK6 was detected at membranes in some high-grade human prostate tumors, and PTK6 and E-cadherin expression levels were inversely correlated in human prostate cancers. In addition, high levels of PTK6 expression predicted poor prognosis in patients with prostate cancer.

However, because of the low specificity of PSA, unnecessary biopsies and mistaken diagnoses frequently occur. Prostate cancer has various features so prognosis following diagnosis is greatly variable. There is a requirement for new prognostic biomarkers, particularly to differentiate between inactive and aggressive forms of disease, to improve clinical management of prostate cancer. Research continues into finding additional markers that may allow this goal to be attained. We here selected a group of candidate biomarkers including PSA, PSA velocity, percentage free PSA, TGFβ1, AMACR, chromogranin A, IL-6, IGFBPs, PSCA, biomarkers related to cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, PTEN, androgen receptor, cellular adhesion and angiogenesis, and also prognostic biomarkers with Genomic tests for discussion.

Intact PTEN immunostaining was 91% specific for the absence of PTEN gene deletion (549/602 tumors with two copies of the PTEN gene by FISH showed intact expression of PTEN by immunohistochemistry) and 97% sensitive for the presence of homozygous PTEN gene deletion (absent PTEN protein expression by immunohistochemistry in 65/67 tumors with homozygous deletion). PTEN immunohistochemistry was 65% sensitive for the presence of hemizygous PTEN gene deletion, with protein loss in 40/62 hemizygous tumors. We reviewed the 53 cases where immunohistochemistry showed PTEN protein loss and FISH showed two intact copies of the PTEN gene. On re-review, there was ambiguous immunohistochemistry loss in 6% (3/53) and failure to analyze the same tumor area by both methods in 34% (18/53). Of the remaining discordant cases, 41% (13/32) revealed hemizygous (n=8) or homozygous (n=5) PTEN gene deletion that was focal in most cases (11/13). The remaining 19 cases had two copies of the PTEN gene detected by FISH, representing truly discordant cases. Our automated PTEN immunohistochemistry assay is a sensitive method for detection of homozygous PTEN gene deletions. Immunohistochemistry screening is particularly useful to identify cases with heterogeneous PTEN gene deletion in a subset of tumor glands.

Anecdotal and epidemiologic observations provide evidence for beneficial effects of the calorie restriction mimetic resveratrol (RES), a SIRT1 activator in preventing cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Although SIRT1 possesses both tumorigenic and antitumorigenic potential, the molecular mechanisms underlying SIRT1-mediated tumor progression or inhibition are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the role of SIRT1 in multiple human prostate cancer cell lines and prostate-specific PTEN knockout mouse model using resveratrol. Androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines (C42B, PC3, and DU145) express higher levels of SIRT1 than androgen-responsive (LNCaP) and nontumorigenic prostate cells (RWPE-1). Resveratrol enhanced this expression without any significant effect on SIRT1 enzymatic activity. Inhibition of SIRT1 expression using shRNA enhanced cell proliferation and inhibited autophagy by repressing phosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP1. These biologic correlates were reversed in the presence of resveratrol. Analysis of prostates from dietary intervention with resveratrol showed a significant reduction in prostate weight and reduction in the incidence of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplastic (HGPIN) lesions by approximately 54% with no significant change in body weight. Consistent with the in vitro findings, resveratrol intervention in the PTEN knockout mouse model was associated with reduction in the prostatic levels of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity and increased expression of SIRT1. These data suggest that SIRT1/S6K-mediated inhibition of autophagy drives prostate tumorigenesis. Therefore, modulation of SIRT1/S6K signaling represents an effective strategy for prostate cancer prevention.",

CD147 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray containing 11,152 prostate cancer specimens. Results were compared to tumor phenotype, biochemical recurrence, ERG status and deletions on PTEN, 3p13, 6q15 and 5q21. CD147 expression was strong in benign prostatic glands and often reduced in prostate cancers. CD147 immunostaining was found in 71.7% of 7628 interpretable cases. CD147 staining was considered strong in 34.6%, moderate in 24.3% and weak in 12.8% of cancers while 28.3% did not show any CD147 reactivity. Reduced CD147 staining was strongly associated with both TMPRSS2-ERG-rearrangement and ERG expression (p<0.0001 each). Within the subgroups of ERG positive and negative cancers, deletions of PTEN, 3p13, 6q15 and 5q21 were unrelated to the CD147 expression status. Decreased CD147 expression was significantly linked to high preoperative PSA values, high Gleason grade, advanced tumor stage (p<0.0001 each), and positive lymph node involvement (p=0.0026) in all cancers. There was a marginal, but statistically significant, association of reduced CD147 expression with early biochemical recurrence (p=0.0296). The significant reduction of CD147 expression in ERG positive prostate cancer provides further evidence for marked biological differences between \"fusion type\" and \"non-fusion type\" prostate cancer.

However,             the physiological basis of the male predominance of bladder cancer remains poorly             understood. A higher than expected association of prostate and bladder cancers             has also been reported which may indicate a common mechanism of carcinogenesis.             Consistent with this, androgens and the androgen receptor (AR) play essential             roles in prostate carcinogenesis and are believed to play a role in bladder carcinogenesis.             There is also evidence implicating cancer stem cells in prostate and bladder cancers.             Indeed putative prostate and bladder cancer stem cells share some common molecular             features. We highlight key proteins (CD49f, CD133, PTEN, CD44) which are implicated             in both prostate and bladder cancers and are enriched in putative prostate and             bladder cancer stem cells. We examine published chromatin immuno-precipitation             studies analyzing the genome-wide distribution of the AR to identify AR association             with, and by inference potential AR-regulation of, these loci. We discuss recent             evidence indicating a role for the AR in the splicing of the key urological stem             cell protein CD44. We propose a model whereby aberrant AR regulation of these             putative stem cell proteins contributes to malignant transformation of prostate             and bladder cells.

However, robustness and reliability have not been fully investigated for quantum dot fluorophores in situ hybridization applications. We demonstrate the feasibility of an automated multiplexing four-color quantum dot fluorophores in situ hybridization assay comprised of four genomic probes each labeled with unique haptens, four anti-hapten antibodies each conjugated with quantum dot fluorophores with distinct emission spectrum, protocols for their use on a fully automated tissue staining platform, and direct observation of multiple signals using conventional filter-based fluorescent microscopy. This assay is successfully applied to the simultaneous detection of ERG3p, ERG5p, PTEN, and CEN10 genes in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded prostate tissues on BenchMark ULTRA instruments. There were 386 slides from 10 prostatectomy cases stained on 13 on these instruments. These 10 cases consisted of benign prostate and prostate cancer; the cancer cases were either positive or negative for ERG rearrangement and/or contained PTEN deletion. There were 350 (91%) slides appropriately stained for all four targets. The staining results accurately identified the ERG and PTEN status for all 10 cases.

Often, RAS/ERK signaling is activated by mutation of the RAS or RAF oncogenes, and PI3K/AKT is activated by loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN. In prostate cancer, PTEN deletions are common, but, unlike other carcinomas, RAS and RAF mutations are rare. We have previously shown that over-expression of \"oncogenic\" ETS transcription factors, which occurs in about one-half of prostate tumors due to chromosome rearrangement, can bypass the need for RAS/ERK signaling in the activation of a cell migration gene expression program. In this study we test the role of RAS/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling in the function of oncogenic ETS proteins.;We find that oncogenic ETS expression negatively correlates with RAS and RAF mutations in prostate tumors. Furthermore, the oncogenic ETS transcription factors only increased cell migration in the absence of RAS/ERK activation. In contrast to RAS/ERK, it has been reported that oncogenic ETS expression positively correlates with PI3K/AKT activation. We identified a mechanistic explanation for this finding by showing that oncogenic ETS proteins required AKT signaling to activate a cell migration gene expression program through ETS/AP-1 binding sequences. Levels of pAKT correlated with the ability of oncogenic ETS proteins to increase cell migration, but this process did not require mTORC1.;Our findings indicate that oncogenic ETS rearrangements cause a cell migration gene expression program to switch from RAS/ERK control to PI3K/AKT control and provide a possible explanation for the high frequency of PTEN, but not RAS/RAF mutations in prostate cancer.",

PTEN-/- cells were transduced with a small hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentiviral vector containing either scrambled nucleotides (SCRM) or sequences targeted to PDGF D (shPDGF D). Tumorigenesis and morphogenesis of these cell lines were evaluated in vivo via subcutaneous injection of male nude mice and in vitro using Matrigel 3-dimensional (3D) culture. Effects of irradiation on clonogenic survival, cell migration, and invasion were measured with respect to the PTEN status and the PDGF D expression level. In addition, apoptosis and cell cycle redistribution were examined as potential mechanisms for differences seen.;PTEN-/- cells were highly tumorigenic in animals and effectively formed foci in 3D culture. Importantly, loss of PDGF D in these cell lines drastically diminished these phenotypes. Furthermore, PTEN-/- cells demonstrated increased clonogenic survival in vitro compared to PTEN+/+, and attenuation of PDGF D significantly reversed this radioresistant phenotype. PTEN-/- cells displayed greater migratory and invasive potential at baseline as well as after irradiation. Both the basal and radiation-induced migratory and invasive phenotypes in PTEN-/- cells required PDGF D expression. Interestingly, these differences were independent of apoptosis and cell cycle redistribution, as they showed no significant difference.;We propose that PDGF D represents a potentially promising target for PCa treatment resistance in the absence of PTEN function, and warrants further laboratory evaluation and clinical study.",

Although ERG gene rearrangement has been identified in approximately 50% of localized prostate cancers in western countries, the prognostic significance of this critical molecular event remains unknown in Chinese patients. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry, we evaluated ERG, PTEN and EGFR family aberrations in a cohort of 224 Chinese prostate cancer patients diagnosed in transurethral resection of the prostate (TUR-P). Overall, ERG rearrangement was detected in 23.2% (44/190) cases, of which 54.5% (24/44) showed deletion of the 5'end of ERG. PTEN deletion was identified in 10.8% (19/176) cases. Amplification of EGFR and HER2 genes was present in 1.1% (2/178) and 5.8% (10/173) of cases, respectively. Significant correlation between ERG rearrangement and PTEN deletion was identified in this cohort. EGFR and HER2 aberrations occurred more frequently in PCas without ERG rearrangement than in those with ERG rearrangement, although this did not reach statistical significance. Overall, ERG rearrangement was associated with pre-operative PSA values (P = 0.038) and cancer-related death (P = 0.02), but not with the age, clinical T stage, Gleason score, or Ki-67 labeling index (LI). Notably, multivariate analysis including known prognostic markers revealed ERG rearrangement was an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.022). Additionally, ERG rearrangement status was helpful to identify patients with poor prognosis from PCa group with low Ki-67 LI.

Here we have identified shank-interacting protein-like 1 (SIPL1) as a PTEN-NR in human tumor cell lines and human primary cervical cancer cells. Ectopic SIPL1 expression protected human U87 glioma cells from PTEN-mediated growth inhibition and promoted the formation of HeLa cell-derived xenograft tumors in immunocompromised mice. Conversely, siRNA-mediated knockdown of SIPL1 expression inhibited the growth of both HeLa cells and DU145 human prostate carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo in a xenograft tumor model. These inhibitions were reversed by concomitant knockdown of PTEN, demonstrating that SIPL1 affects tumorigenesis via inhibition of PTEN function. Mechanistically, SIPL1 was found to interact with PTEN through its ubiquitin-like domain (UBL), inhibiting the phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) phosphatase activity of PTEN. Furthermore, SIPL1 expression correlated with loss of PTEN function in PTEN-positive human primary cervical cancer tissue.

In turn, loss of Notch/RBP-J function resulted in decreased cell proliferation and loss of epithelial and smooth muscle progenitors. Gain of Notch function resulted in an early onset of benign prostate hyperplasia by three months of age. Loss of Notch function also resulted in abnormal differentiation of the prostate epithelium and stroma. In particular, loss of Notch signaling and increase in PTEN promoted a switch from myoblast to fibroblast lineage, and a loss of smooth muscle. In summary, we show that Notch signaling is necessary for terminal differentiation of the prostate epithelium and smooth muscle, and that during normal prostate development Notch/PTEN pathway functions to maintain patterned progenitors in the epithelial and smooth muscle compartments. In addition, we found that both positive and negative modulation of Notch signaling results in abnormal organization of the prostate tissue, and can contribute to prostate disease in the adult organ.",

Syndecan-1 (SDC-1), a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan, supports the integrity of the epithelial compartment. In tumor cells of epithelial lineage, SDC-1 is generally downregulated. This may result in perturbation of homeostasis and lead to progression of malignancy. Our studies have shown that the n-3 PUFA species, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), increases SDC-1 expression in prostate tissues of Pten knockout (Pten(P-/-)) mice/cells and human prostate cancer cells. We have now determined that DHA-mediated up-regulation of SDC-1 induces apoptosis. Bovine serum albumin-bound DHA and exogenous human recombinant SDC-1 ecotodomain were delivered to PC3 and LNCaP cells in the presence or absence of SDC-1 small interfering (si)RNA. In the presence of control siRNA, both DHA and SDC-1 ectodomain induced apoptosis, whereas SDC-1 silencing blocked DHA-induced but not SDC-1 ectodomain-induced apoptosis. Downstream effectors of SDC-1 signaling linked to n-3 PUFA-induced apoptosis involved the 3'-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1)/Akt/Bad integrating network. A diet enriched in n-3 PUFA decreased phosphorylation of PDK1, Akt (T308), and Bad in prostates of Pten(P-/-) mice. Similar results were observed in human prostate cancer cells in response to DHA and SDC-1 ectodomain. The effect of DHA on PDK1/Akt/Bad signaling was abrogated by SDC-1 siRNA. These findings define a mechanism by which SDC-1-dependent suppression of phosphorylation of PDK1/Akt/Bad mediates n-3 PUFA-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer.",

In this study, we sought to determine molecular relationships between aspects of normal prostate development and prostate carcinogenesis. We first characterized the gene expression program associated with key points of murine prostate organogenesis spanning the initial in utero induction of prostate budding through maturity. We identified a highly reproducible temporal program of gene expression that partitioned according to the broad developmental stages of prostate induction, branching morphogenesis, and secretory differentiation. Comparisons of gene expression profiles of murine prostate cancers arising in the context of genetically engineered alterations in the Pten tumor suppressor and Myc oncogene identified significant associations between the profile of branching morphogenesis and both cancer models. Further, the expression of genes comprising the branching morphogenesis program, such as PRDX4, SLC43A1, and DNMT3A, was significantly altered in human neoplastic prostate epithelium.

A combinatorial approach was used to identify miRs that promote prostate cancer progression in a unique set of prostate cancer cell lines, which originate from the parental p69 cell line and extend to a highly tumorigenic/metastatic M12 subline. Together, these cell lines are thought to mimic prostate cancer progression in vivo. Previous network analysis and miR arrays suggested that the loss of hsa-miR-125b together with the overexpression of hsa-miR-22 could contribute to prostate tumorigenesis. The dysregulation of these two miRs was confirmed in human prostate tumor samples as compared to adjacent benign glandular epithelium collected through laser capture microdissection from radical prostatectomies. In fact, alterations in hsa-miR-125b expression appeared to be an early event in tumorigenesis. Reverse phase microarray proteomic analysis revealed ErbB2/3 and downstream members of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways as well as PTEN to be protein targets differentially expressed in the M12 tumor cell compared to its parental p69 cell. Relevant luciferase+3'-UTR expression studies confirmed a direct interaction between hsa-miR-125b and ErbB2 and between hsa-miR-22 and PTEN. Restoration of hsa-miR-125b or inhibition of hsa-miR-22 expression via an antagomiR resulted in an alteration of M12 tumor cell behavior in vitro. Thus, the dual action of hsa-miR-125b as a tumor suppressor and hsa-miR-22 as an oncomiR contributed to prostate tumorigenesis by modulations in PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways, key pathways known to influence prostate cancer progression.

Loss of PTEN function is associated with constitutive survival signaling through the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt pathway. Therefore, we asked if reconstitution of PTEN function would lead to the reversal of resistance to apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Adenovirus-mediated expression of PTEN completely suppressed constitutive Akt activation in LNCaP prostate cancer cells and enhanced apoptosis induced by a broad range of apoptotic stimuli. PTEN expression sensitized cells to death receptor-mediated apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor, anti-Fas antibody, and TRAIL. PTEN also sensitized cells to non-receptor mediated apoptosis induced by a kinase inhibitor staurosporine and chemotherapeutic agents mitoxantrone and etoposide. PTEN-mediated apoptosis was accompanied by caspase-3 and caspase-8 activation and was inhibited by a broad specificity caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk. Bcl-2 overexpression also blocked PTEN-mediated apoptosis. Lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN is required for apoptosis as the PTEN G129E mutant selectively deficient in lipid phosphatase activity was unable to sensitize cells to apoptosis. PTEN-mediated apoptosis involves a FADD-dependent pathway for both death receptor-mediated and drug-induced apoptosis as coexpression of a dominant negative FADD mutant blocked PTEN-mediated apoptosis. Since in death receptor signaling, FADD mediates activation of caspase-8, which in turn cleaves BID, and since caspase-8 is activated in PTEN-mediated apoptosis, we examined BID cleavage in PTEN-mediated apoptosis. PTEN facilitated BID cleavage after treatment with low doses of staurosporine and mitoxantrone. BID cleavage was inhibited by dominant negative FADD. Taken together, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that PTEN promotes drug-induced apoptosis by facilitating caspase-8 activation and BID cleavage through a FADD-dependent pathway.",

Current prognostic variables, stage, and Gleason score have limitations in assessing treatment regimens for individual patients, especially in the intermediate-risk group of Gleason score 7. ERG:TMPRSS2 fusion and loss of PTEN are some of the most common genetic alterations in prostate cancer. Immunohistochemistry of PTEN and ERG has generated interest as a promising method for more precise outcome prediction but requires further validation in population-based cohorts. We studied the predictive value of ERG and PTEN expression by immunohistochemistry in two large radical prostatectomy cohorts comprising 815 patients with extensive follow-up information. Clinical end points were initiation of secondary therapy, overall survival, and disease-specific survival. Predictions of clinical outcomes were also assessed according to androgen receptor (AR) activity. PTEN loss, especially in ERG-negative cancers, predicted initiation of secondary treatments and shortened disease-specific survival time, as well as stratifying Gleason score 7 patients into different prognostic groups with regard to secondary treatments and disease-specific survival. High AR immunoreactivity in ERG-negative cancers with PTEN loss predicted worse disease-specific survival. We also observed that in Gleason score 7 ERG-negative cases with PTEN loss and high AR expression have significantly shorter disease-specific survival time compared with ERG-positive cases. Our conclusion is that loss of PTEN is a strong determining factor for shorter disease-specific survival time and initiation of secondary therapies after radical prostatectomy. The predictive value of PTEN immunoreactivity is further accentuated in ERG-negative cancers with high AR expression. Negative PTEN expression, accompanied by ERG status, can be used to stratify patients with Gleason score 7 into different survival groups.

Distinct cancer phenotypes from different cells and organs likely result from unique gene expression repertoires established in the embryo and maintained after malignant transformation. We used comprehensive gene expression analysis to examine this concept in the prostate, an organ with a tractable developmental program and a high propensity for cancer. We focused on gene expression in the murine prostate rudiment at three time points during the first 48 h of exposure to androgen, which initiates proliferation and invasion of prostate epithelial buds into surrounding urogenital sinus mesenchyme. Here, we show that androgen exposure regulates genes previously implicated in prostate carcinogenesis comprising pathways for the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), fibroblast growth factor (FGF)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and Wnt signaling along with cellular programs regulating such 'hallmarks' of cancer as angiogenesis, apoptosis, migration and proliferation. We found statistically significant evidence for novel androgen-induced gene regulation events that establish and/or maintain prostate cell fate. These include modulation of gene expression through microRNAs, expression of specific transcription factors, and regulation of their predicted targets. By querying public gene expression databases from other tissues, we found that rather than generally characterizing androgen exposure or epithelial budding, the early prostate development program more closely resembles the program for human prostate cancer. Most importantly, early androgen-regulated genes and functional themes associated with prostate development were highly enriched in contrasts between increasingly lethal forms of prostate cancer, confirming a 'reactivation' of embryonic pathways for proliferation and invasion in prostate cancer progression. Among the genes with the most significant links to the development and cancer, we highlight coordinate induction of the transcription factor Sox9 and suppression of the proapoptotic phospholipid-binding protein Annexin A1 that link early prostate development to early prostate carcinogenesis.

In this study, we investigate an alternative mechanism through which inflammation promotes the initiation of prostate cancer. Adult murine prostate epithelia are composed predominantly of basal and luminal cells. Previous studies revealed that the two lineages are largely self-sustained when residing in their native microenvironment. To interrogate whether tissue inflammation alters the differentiation program of basal cells, we conducted lineage tracing of basal cells using a K14-CreER;mTmG model in concert with a murine model of prostatitis induced by infection from the uropathogenic bacteria CP9. We show that acute prostatitis causes tissue damage and creates a tissue microenvironment that induces the differentiation of basal cells into luminal cells, an alteration that rarely occurs under normal physiological conditions. Previously we showed that a mouse model with prostate basal cell-specific deletion of Phosphatase and tensin homolog (K14-CreER;Pten(fl/fl)) develops prostate cancer with a long latency, because disease initiation in this model requires and is limited by the differentiation of transformation-resistant basal cells into transformation-competent luminal cells. Here, we show that CP9-induced prostatitis significantly accelerates the initiation of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia in this model. Our results demonstrate that inflammation results in a tissue microenvironment that alters the normal prostate epithelial cell differentiation program and that through this cellular process inflammation accelerates the initiation of prostate cancer with a basal cell origin.

The clinical significance of this alteration and the tumour suppressor gene(s) driving the deletion remain to be identified. We have mapped the 3p13 deletion locus using SNP array analysis and performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis to search for associations between 3p13 deletion, prostate cancer phenotype and patient prognosis in a tissue microarray containing more than 3200 prostate cancers. SNP array analysis of 72 prostate cancers revealed a small deletion at 3p13 in 14 (19%) of the tumours, including the putative tumour suppressors FOXP1, RYBP and SHQ1. FISH analysis using FOXP1-specific probes revealed deletions in 16.5% and translocations in 1.2% of 1828 interpretable cancers. 3p13 deletions were linked to adverse features of prostate cancer, including advanced stage (p < 0.0001), high Gleason grade (p = 0.0125), and early PSA recurrence (p = 0.0015). In addition, 3p13 deletions were linked to ERG(+) cancers and to PTEN deletions (p < 0.0001 each). A subset analysis of ERG(+) tumours revealed that 3p13 deletions occurred independently from PTEN deletions (p = 0.3126), identifying tumours with 3p13 deletion as a distinct molecular subset of ERG(+) cancers. mRNA expression analysis confirmed that all 3p13 genes were down regulated by the deletion. Ectopic over-expression of FOXP1, RYBP and SHQ1 resulted in decreased colony-formation capabilities, corroborating a tumour suppressor function for all three genes. In summary, our data show that deletion of 3p13 defines a distinct and aggressive molecular subset of ERG(+) prostate cancers, which is possibly driven by inactivation of multiple tumour suppressors.",

Results were compared to tumor phenotype, biochemical recurrence and molecular subtypes defined by ERG status as well as genomic deletions of 3p, 5q, 6q and PTEN.

High EZH2 expression was strongly associated with high Gleason grade (P < 0.0001), advanced pathological tumor stage (P < 0.0001), positive nodal status (P < 0.0001), elevated preoperative PSA level (P = 0.0066), early PSA recurrence (P < 0.0001) and increased cell proliferation P < 0.0001).

The prognostic impact of EZH2 was independent of established pre- and postoperatively assessed clinicopathological parameters.

Following the discovery of the recurrent TMPRSS2:ETS fusions in prostate cancer and EML4:ALK in non-small-cell lung cancer, it is now accepted that fusion genes not only are the hallmark of haematological malignancies and sarcomas, but also play an important role in epithelial cell carcinogenesis. However, previous studies aiming to identify fusion genes in prostate cancer were mainly focused on expression changes and fusion transcripts. To investigate the genes recurrently affected by the chromosome breakpoints in prostate cancer, we analysed Affymetrix array 6.0 and 500K SNP microarray data from 77 prostate cancer samples. While the two genes most frequently affected by genomic breakpoints were, as expected, ERG and TMPRSS2, surprisingly more known tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) than known oncogenes were identified at recurrent chromosome breakpoints. Certain well-characterised TSGs, including p53, PTEN, BRCA1 and BRCA2 are recurrently truncated as a result of chromosome rearrangements in prostate cancer. Interestingly, many of the genes residing at recurrent breakpoint sites have not yet been implicated in prostate carcinogenesis such as HOOK3, PPP2R2A and TCBA1. We have confirmed the generally reduced expression of selected genes in clinical samples using quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Subsequently, we further investigated the genes associated with the t(4:6) translocation in LNCaP cells and reveal the genomic fusion of SNX9 and putative TSG UNC5C, which led to the reduced expression of both genes. This study reveals another common mechanism that leads to the inactivation of TSGs in prostate cancer and the identification of multiple TSGs inactivated by chromosome rearrangements will lead to new direction of research for the molecular basis of prostate carcinogenesis.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Prostate cancer, the majority of which is adenocarcinoma, is the most common epithelial cancer affecting a majority of elderly men in Western nations. Its manifestation, however, varies from clinically asymptomatic insidious neoplasms that progress slowly and do not threaten life to one that is highly aggressive with a propensity for metastatic spread and lethality if not treated in time. A number of somatic genetic and epigenetic alterations occur in prostate cancer cells. Some of these changes, such as loss of the tumor suppressors PTEN and p53, are linked to disease progression. Others, such as ETS gene fusions, appear to be linked more with early phases of the disease, such as invasion. Alterations in chromosome 8q24 in the region of MYC have also been linked to disease aggressiveness for many years. However, a number of recent studies in human tissues have indicated that MYC appears to be activated at the earliest phases of prostate cancer (e.g., in tumor-initiating cells) in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, a key precursor lesion to invasive prostatic adenocarcinoma. The initiation and early progression of prostate cancer can be recapitulated in genetically engineered mouse models, permitting a richer understanding of the cause and effects of loss of tumor suppressors and activation of MYC. The combination of studies using human tissues and mouse models paints an emerging molecular picture of prostate cancer development and early progression. This picture reveals that MYC contributes to disease initiation and progression by stimulating an embryonic stem cell-like signature characterized by an enrichment of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and by repressing differentiation. These insights pave the way to potential novel therapeutic concepts based on MYC biology.",

Conversely, this response is bypassed with deletion of either Trp53 or Zbtb7a together with Pten, leading to the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Mechanistically, the integrated acquisition of data from mouse models and patients identifies the expression patterns of XAF1, XIAP and SRD5A1 as a predictive and actionable signature for CRPC.

In line with this important role of PTEN, mice that are heterozygous for a PTEN-null allele (PTEN+/− mice) spontaneously develop a variety of tumours in multiple organs. PTEN is a phosphatase with selectivity for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, which is produced by the class I isoforms of PI3K (p110α, p110β, p110γ and p110δ). Previous studies indicated that PTEN-deficient cancer cell lines mainly depend on p110β, and that p110β, but not p110α, controls mouse prostate cancer development driven by PTEN loss. In the present study, we investigated whether the ubiquitously expressed p110α can also functionally interact with PTEN in cancer. Using genetic mouse models that mimic systemic administration of p110α- or p110β-selective inhibitors, we confirm that inactivation of p110β, but not p110α, inhibits prostate cancer development in PTEN+/− mice, but also find that p110α inactivation protects from glomerulonephritis, pheochromocytoma and thyroid cancer induced by PTEN loss. This indicates that p110α can modulate the impact of PTEN loss in disease and tumourigenesis. In primary and immortalized mouse fibroblast cell lines, both p110α and p110β controlled steady-state PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels and Akt signalling induced by heterozygous PTEN loss. In contrast, no correlation was found in primary mouse tissues between PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels, PI3K/PTEN genotype and cancer development.

The expression levels of these five markers were associated with patient clinical and pathological characteristics.;Expression levels of p-Akt, p-mTOR, p-4E-BP1 and p-p70S6K were significantly higher in prostate cancer tissues than in BPH and HGPIN tissues. In 182 patients with prostate cancer the p-mTOR expression level significantly and positively correlated with its upstream p-Akt and downstream p-4E-BP1 and p-p70S6K expression levels. The cancer Gleason score was significantly correlated with p-Akt and p-mTOR expression level but not with p-4E-BP1 and p-p70S6K expression level. However, the p-4E-BP1 and p-p70S6K expression levels in primary cancer lesions were statistically significantly correlated with patient T stage and distant metastases.;Most patients with prostate cancer have at least one component of the mTOR signalling pathway activated. The activation of the mTOR pathway might be involved in prostate cancer development and progression. The association between activation of mTOR pathway and patient clinicopathological variables suggested that not all patients are equally amenable to treatment strategies targeting the mTOR pathway.",

To evaluate its clinical impact and relationship with key genomic alterations in prostate cancer, AQP5 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray containing 12427 prostate cancers. The analysis revealed weak to moderate immunostaining in normal prostate epithelium. In prostate cancers AQP5 staining levels were more variable and also included completely negative and highly overexpressing cases. Negative, weak, moderate, and strong AQP5 staining was found in 25.0%, 32.5%, 32.5%, and 10.0% of 10239 interpretable tumors. Comparison of AQP5 expression levels with tumor characteristics showed a dichotomous pattern with both high and low staining levels being linked to unfavorable tumor phenotype. AQP5 was negative in 28%, 23%, 24%, and 35% of tumors with Gleason score ≤3 + 3, 3 + 4, 4 + 3 and ≥4 + 4, while the rate of strongly positive cases continuously increased from 7.0% over 10.0% and 12.0% to 13.0% in cancers with Gleason score ≤3 + 3, 3 + 4, 4 + 3 and ≥4 + 4. AQP5 expression was also related to ERG positivity and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) deletion (P < .0001 each). Strong AQP5 positivity was seen in 15.5% of ERG-positive and 5.8% of ERG-negative cancers (P < .0001) as well as in 14.7% of cancers with PTEN deletion and 9.4% of cancers without PTEN deletion. Remarkably, both negativity and strong positivity of AQP5 were linked to unfavorable disease outcome. This was however only seen in subgroups defined by TMPRSS2-ERG fusion and/or PTEN deletion. In summary, AQP5 can be both overexpressed and lost in subgroups of prostate cancers. Both alterations are linked to unfavorable outcome in molecularly defined cancer subgroups. It is hypothesized that this dichotomous role of AQP5 is due to two highly different mechanisms as to how the protein can influence cancer cells, that is, hydraulic motility regulation and Ras/MAPK pathway activation.

Drugs targeting the PI3K pathway aim to inhibit proliferation, promote apoptosis, and enhance chemosensitivity and radiosensitivity of cancer cells. The phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) phosphatidylinositol 3'-phosphatase is a key negative regulator of the PI3K pathway. Inactivation of the PTEN tumor suppressor results in constitutive activation of the PI3K pathway and is found in approximately 50% of advanced prostate cancers, which correlates with a high Gleason score and poor prognosis. Inhibition of the PI3K pathway leads to apoptosis of prostate cancer cells; however, the precise mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. Here we report that apoptotic cell death of PTEN-deficient LNCaP and PC3 prostate cancer cells induced by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 can be abrogated by disrupting Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) interactions with recombinant Fas:Fc fusion protein or FasL neutralizing antibody (Nok-1), or by expressing dominant-negative Fas-associated death domain. Furthermore, we find that apoptosis induced by expression of wild-type PTEN, driven by a tetracycline-inducible expression system in LNCaP cells, can be inhibited by blocking Fas/FasL interaction using Fas:Fc or Nok-1. These data show that apoptosis induced by blockade of the PI3K pathway in prostate tumor cells is mediated by an autocrine Fas/FasL apoptotic mechanism and the Fas apoptotic pathway is both necessary and sufficient to mediate apoptosis by PI3K inhibition.",

In order to optimize treatment approaches for intermediate-risk patients, additional genetic prognosticators are needed. Previous reports using array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) in radical prostatectomy cohorts suggested a combination of allelic loss of the PTEN gene on 10q and allelic gain of the c-MYC gene on 8q were associated with metastatic disease. We tested whether copy number alterations (CNAs) in PTEN (allelic loss) and c-MYC (allelic gain) were associated with biochemical relapse following modern-era, image-guided radiotherapy (mean dose 76.4 Gy). We used aCGH analyses validated by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) of DNA was derived from frozen, pre-treatment biopsies in 126 intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients. Patients whose tumors had CNAs in both PTEN and c-MYC had significantly increased genetic instability (percent genome alteration; PGA) compared to tumors with normal PTEN and c-MYC status (p < 0.0001). We demonstrate that c-MYC gain alone, or combined c-MYC gain and PTEN loss, were increasingly prognostic for relapse on multivariable analyses (hazard ratios (HR) of 2.58/p = 0.005 and 3.21/p = 0.0004; respectively). Triaging patients by the use of CNAs within pre-treatment biopsies may allow for better use of systemic therapies to target sub-clinical metastases or locally recurrent disease and improve clinical outcomes.",

We have then explored the antitumor effects as single agent and in combination with docetaxel in triple-negative breast (TNBC) and prostate cancer models. In vitro, AZD8186 inhibited growth of a range of cell lines. Sensitivity was associated with inhibition of the AKT pathway.

Overcoming this process is a critical step in early cancer development. The druggable orphan nuclear receptor TLX (NR2E1) is characterized as an important regulator of neural stem cells and is also implicated in the development of some brain tumours. However, its exact functional roles in cancer growth regulation still remain unclear. Here we report that TLX can act as a promoter of tumourigenesis in prostate cancer by suppressing oncogene-induced senescence. We determined that TLX exhibited an increased expression in high-grade prostate cancer tissues and many prostate cancer cell lines. Functional studies revealed that TLX could perform an oncogenic function in prostate cancer cells, as its knockdown triggered cellular senescence and cell growth arrest in vitro and in vivo, whereas its over-expression promoted the malignant growth of prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, enhancement of TLX activity, by either ectopic expression or ligand stimulation, could potently prevent doxorubicin-induced senescence in prostate cancer cells and also allow prostatic epithelial cells to escape oncogene-induced senescence induced either by activated oncogene H-Ras(G12V) or knockdown of tumour suppressor PTEN, via a mechanism of direct but differential transcriptional regulation of two senescence-associated genes, repression of CDKN1A and transactivation of SIRT1. Together, our present study shows, for the first time, that TLX may play an important role in prostate carcinogenesis through its suppression of oncogene-induced senescence, and also suggests that targeting the senescence-regulatory TLX is of potential therapeutic significance in prostate cancer.",

We now report that the oncogenic Ets variant 4 (Etv4) promotes prostate cancer metastasis in response to coactivation of PI3-kinase and Ras signaling pathways in a genetically engineered mouse model of highly penetrant, metastatic prostate cancer. Using an inducible Cre driver to simultaneously inactivate Pten while activating oncogenic Kras and a fluorescent reporter allele in the prostate epithelium, we performed lineage tracing in vivo to define the temporal and spatial occurrence of prostate tumors, disseminated tumor cells, and metastases. These analyses revealed that though disseminated tumors cells arise early following the initial occurrence of prostate tumors, there is a significant temporal lag in metastasis, which is temporally coincident with the up-regulation of Etv4 expression in primary tumors. Functional studies showed that knockdown of Etv4 in a metastatic cell line derived from the mouse model abrogates the metastatic phenotype but does not affect tumor growth. Notably, expression and activation of ETV4, but not other oncogenic ETS genes, is correlated with activation of both PI3-kinase and Ras signaling in human prostate tumors and metastases. Our findings indicate that ETV4 promotes metastasis in prostate tumors that have activation of PI3-kinase and Ras signaling, and therefore, ETV4 represents a potential target of therapeutic intervention for metastatic prostate cancer.

This review notably summarizes the present knowledge of the (de)regulation of the effects of androgens, p53, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax, Akt, PTEN, Par-4, clusterine, caspases and NF-kappaB in prostate adenocarcinoma cell lines and provides an appraisal of their therapeutic potential.

In this review, we summarise novel understandings of the early molecular events in prostatic carcinogenesis that may underlie both the molecular and clinical heterogeneity. Issues covered include those related to stem cells and embryonic signalling, oncogene/tumor suppressor abnormalities, androgen signalling, apoptosis and the nature of tumor-stromal interactions. Emphasis is placed on signalling pathway abnormalities, their causation, consequences and interactions. For example, genomic abnormalities involving the TMPRSS2-ETS and PTEN loci and the resulting signalling effects suggest the importance of genomic instability as a crucial factor in the emergence of this neoplasm. Together with new insights into signalling pathways consequent to abnormalities such as these, a greater understanding of the pathophysiology involved in prostatic carcinogenesis will lead to targeted approaches for both therapy and chemoprevention in the future.",

Rodent models have demonstrated that an early and later-life exposure to estrogen can lead to cancerous lesions and implicated hormonal dysregulation as an avenue for developing future prostate neoplasia. This study utilizes a human fetal prostate xenograft model to study the role of estrogen in the progression of human disease. Histopathological lesions were assessed in 7-, 30-, 90-, 200-, and 400-day human prostate xenografts. Gene expression for cell cycle, tumor suppressors, and apoptosis-related genes (ie, CDKN1A, CASP9, ESR2, PTEN, and TP53) was performed for 200-day estrogen-treated xenografts. Glandular hyperplasia was observed in xenografts given both an initial and secondary exposure to estradiol in both 200- and 400-day xenografts. Persistent estrogenic effects were verified using immunohistochemical markers for cytokeratin 10, p63, and estrogen receptor α. This model provides data on the histopathological state of the human prostate following estrogenic treatment, which can be utilized in understanding the complicated pathology associated with prostatic disease and early and later-life estrogenic exposures.

To assess its role in prostate cancer, LPCAT1 expression was analyzed on a tissue microarray containing samples from 11,152 prostate cancer patients. In benign prostate glands, LPCAT1 immunostaining was absent or weak. In prostate cancer, LPCAT1 positivity was found in 73.8% of 8786 interpretable tumors including 29.2% with strong expression. Increased LPCAT1 expression was associated with advanced tumor stage (pT3b/T4) (p < 0.0001), high Gleason score (≥4 + 4) (p < 0.0001), positive nodal involvement (p = 0.0002), positive surgical margin (p = 0.0005), and early PSA recurrence (p < 0.0001). High LPCAT1 expression was strongly linked to ERG-fusion type prostate cancer. Strong LPCAT1 staining was detected in 45.3% of ERG positive but in only 16.7% of ERG negative tumors (p < 0.0001). Within ERG negative cancers, LPCAT1 staining was strongly increased within the subgroup of PTEN deleted cancers (p < 0.0001). Further subgroup analyses revealed that associations of high LPCAT1 expression with PSA recurrence and unfavorable tumor phenotype were largely driven by ERG negative cancers (p < 0.0001) while these effects were substantially mitigated in ERG positive cancers (p = 0.0073). The prognostic impact of LPCAT1 expression was independent of histological and clinical parameters. It is concluded, that LPCAT1 measurement, either alone or in combination, may be utilized for better clinical decision-making.

        "Doc_abstract":"Epigenetic mechanisms may be the main driving force for critical changes in gene expression that are responsible for progression of prostate cancers. The three most extensively characterized mechanisms for epigenetic gene-regulation are (i) changing patterns of DNA methylation, (ii) histone acetylations/deacetylations, and (iii) alterations in regulatory feedback loops for growth factors. Several studies have indicated that DNA hypermethylation is an important mechanism in prostate cancer for inactivation of key regulatory genes such as E-cadherin, pi-class glutathione S-transferase, the tumor suppressors CDKN2 and PTEN, and IGF-II. Similarly, histone acetylations and deacetylations are frequently associated respectively with transcriptional activation (e.g. IGFBP-2 and p21) and repression (e.g. Mad:Max dimers) of genes linked to prostate cancer progression. Recently, histone acetyltransferase and deacetylase activities have been shown to be intrinsic with transcriptional coregulator proteins that bind to steroid receptors (e.g. SRC-1 and PCAF). Changes in regulatory feedback loops for growth factors with prostate cancer progression tend toward shifts from paracrine to autocrine control where the receptor and ligand are produced by the same cell. While there are several examples of this progression pattern in prostate tumors such as with IGF, FGF, TGF-alpha and their respective receptors, the precise mechanism (i.e. epigenetic or mutational) is less certain. In the context of treatment options, the contribution of mutational versus epigenetic events to prostate cancer progression is an important consideration. Irreversible genetic changes are likely to be less amenable to therapeutic control than are epigenetic ones.",

Muscadine grapes contain unique phytochemical constituents compared with other grapes and are potentially a source for novel compounds with antitumor activities. We compared the antitumor activities of muscadine grape skin extract (MSKE), which we show contains no resveratrol, with that of resveratrol using primary cultures of normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) and the prostate cancer cell lines RWPE-1, WPE1-NA22, WPE1-NB14, and WPE1-NB26, representing different stages of prostate cancer progression. MSKE significantly inhibited tumor cell growth in all transformed prostate cancer cell lines but not PrEC cells. Prostate tumor cell lines, but not PrEC cells, exhibited high rates of apoptosis in response to MSKE through targeting of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase survival pathways. The reduction in Akt activity by MSKE is mediated through a reduction in Akt transcription, enhanced proteosome degradation of Akt, and altered levels of DJ-1, a known regulator of PTEN. In contrast to MSKE, resveratrol did not induce apoptosis in this model but arrested cells at the G(1)-S phase transition of the cell cycle associated with increased expression of p21 and decreased expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 proteins. These results show that MSKE and resveratrol target distinct pathways to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth in this system and that the unique properties of MSKE suggest that it may be an important source for further development of chemopreventive or therapeutic agents against prostate cancer.",

We now demonstrate that the Akt and Erk MAP kinase signaling pathways are activated in androgen-independent lesions of these mice. Forced activation of either Akt or Erk signaling in an androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell line promotes hormone-independent but AR-dependent growth in culture. Although these pathways act additively in culture, they act synergistically in vivo to promote tumorigenicity and androgen independence in the context of the prostate microenvironment.

Because acute bacterial infection in human prostate tissues is relatively rare, the disease relevance of the bacterial infection-induced basal-to-luminal differentiation is uncertain. Herein we employ a high fat diet-induced sterile prostate inflammation model to determine whether basal-to-luminal differentiation can be induced by inflammation irrespective of the underlying etiologies. A K14-CreER model and a fluorescent report line are utilized to specifically label basal cells with the green fluorescent protein. We show that high fat diet promotes immune cell infiltration into the prostate tissues and basal-to-luminal differentiation. Increased cell proliferation accompanies basal-to-luminal differentiation, suggesting a concurrent regulation of basal cell proliferation and differentiation. This study demonstrates that basal-to-luminal differentiation can be induced by different types of prostate inflammation evolved with distinct etiologies. Finally, high fat diet also accelerates initiation and progression of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia that are originated from basal cells with loss-of-function of the tumor suppressor Pten. Because prostate cancer originated from basal cells tends to be invasive, our study also provides an alternative explanation for the association between obesity and aggressive prostate cancer. ",

Our earlier studies defined a mechanistic model for male hormone dependent regulation of AR protein levels in prostate cancer (CaP) cells through a negative feed-back loop between AR and PMEPA1, an androgen induced NEDD4 E3 ubiquitin ligase binding protein. This report focuses on the impact of PMEPA1 silencing on CaP biology. PMEPA1 knockdown accelerated the growth of CaP tumor cells in athymic nude mice. In cell culture models knockdown of PMEPA1 resulted in resistance to AR inhibitors enzalutamide and bicalutamide. While, AR protein down regulation by NEDD4 was PMEPA1 dependent, we also noted a PMEPA1 independent downregulation of PTEN by NEDD4. In a subset of human CaP, decreased PMEPA1 mRNA expression significantly correlated with increased levels of AR transcription target PSA, as a surrogate for elevated AR. This study highlights that silencing of PMEPA1 accelerates the growth of CaP cells through AR, NEDD4 and PTEN. Thus, the therapeutic restoration of PMEPA1 represents a promising complementary strategy correcting for AR and PTEN defects in CaP. Statement of significance: Here we define that silencing of PMEPA1 facilitates the growth of CaP cells and modulates AR through NEDD4 and PTEN.

Cell survival was evaluated by clonogenic assay or sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay upon irradiation in the absence or presence of the AR antagonist enzalutamide.;PTEN loss resulted in upregulation of AR expression in a PDGF-D dependent manner and irradiation selectively increased the nuclear AR protein level and its activity in a murine cell model. When the functional significance of AR in cell survival was tested, treatment with enzalutamide resulted in radiosensitization of human LNCaP cells. Similarly to the murine model, PDGF-D overexpression increased the nuclear AR level and its transcriptional activity in LNCaP cells. PDGF-D over-expression was associated with radioresistance and enzalutamide treatment effectively reversed PDGF-D-mediated radioresistance in LNCaP cells.;We have demonstrated that AR, a target of the PTEN and PDGF D-downstream signaling program, contributes to radiation resistance in human PCa cells.

Seventy one patients with Gleason score 6 tumors on biopsy upgraded to Gleason score 7 or higher at prostatectomy (cases) were compared with 103 patients with Gleason score 6 on both biopsy and prostatectomy (controls). A validated immunohistochemical assay for PTEN was performed, followed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to detect PTEN gene deletion in a subset. PTEN protein loss and clinical-pathologic variables were assessed by logistic regression. Upgraded patients were older than controls (61.8 vs 59.3 years), had higher pre-operative PSA levels (6.5 vs 5.3 ng/ml) and a higher fraction of involved cores (0.42 vs 0.36). PTEN loss by immunohistochemistry was found in 18% (13/71) of upgraded cases compared with 7% (7/103) of controls (P=0.02). Comparison between PTEN immunohistochemistry and PTEN FISH showed the assays were highly concordant, with 97% (65/67) of evaluated biopsies with intact PTEN protein lacking PTEN gene deletion, and 81% (13/16) of the biopsies with PTEN protein loss showing homozygous PTEN gene deletion. Tumors with PTEN protein loss were more likely to be upgraded at radical prostatectomy than those without loss, even after adjusting for age, preoperative PSA, clinical stage and race (odds ratio=3.04 (1.08-8.55; P=0.035)).

Mitochondrion-associated protein LRPPRC functions as an inhibitor for autophagy initiation to protect mitochondria from autophagy degradation. MAP1S and LRPPRC interact with each other and may collaboratively regulate autophagy although the underlying mechanism is yet unknown. Previously, we have reported that LRPPRC levels serve as a prognosis marker of patients with prostate adenocarcinomas (PCA), and that patients with high LRPPRC levels survive a shorter period after surgery than those with low levels of LRPPRC. MAP1S levels are elevated in diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocelular carcinomas in wildtype mice and the exposed MAP1S-deficient mice develop more malignant hepatocellular carcinomas. We performed immunochemical analysis to evaluate the co-relationship among the levels of MAP1S, LRPPRC, P62, and γ-H2AX. Samples were collected from wildtype and prostate-specific PTEN-deficient mice, 111 patients with PCA who had been followed up for 10 years and 38 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia enrolled in hospitals in Guangzhou, China. The levels of MAP1S were generally elevated so the MAP1S-mediated autophagy was activated in PCA developed in either PTEN-deficient mice or patients than their respective benign tumors. The MAP1S levels among patients with PCA vary dramatically, and patients with low MAP1S levels survive a shorter period than those with high MAP1S levels. Levels of MAP1S in collaboration with levels of LRPPRC can serve as markers for prognosis of prostate cancer patients.",

Patterns of association between SPINK1 and each of ERG and PTEN were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Associations between SPINK1 expression and various pathologic parameters and clinical outcome were also investigated.

SPINK expression was observed in 5.56 % of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and 1.1 % of adjacent morphologically benign prostatic glands. SPINK1 and ERG expression were almost exclusive, with only 1.0 % of the cases co-expressing both in the same core sample. SPINK1 interfocal and within-core heterogeneity was noted in 29.2 % and 64.6 % of cases, respectively. SPINK1 expression was not significantly associated with PTEN deletion in the two cohorts (p = 0.871 for discovery cohort and p = 0.293 for validation cohort).

The partial basal-like immunophenotype of these tumors is intriguing in light of the persistent debate surrounding the cell-of-origin for prostate cancer; however, their molecular phenotype is unknown. We collected 37 of these tumors on radical prostatectomy and biopsy and assessed subsets for a diverse panel of molecular markers. The majority of p63-expressing tumors were positive for the ΔNp63 isoform (6/7) by immunofluorescence and p63 mRNA (7/8) by chromogenic in situ hybridization. Despite p63 positivity, these tumors uniformly expressed luminal-type cytokeratin proteins such as CK18 (13/13), CK8 (8/8), and markers of androgen axis signaling commonly seen in luminal cells, including androgen receptor (10/11), NKX3.1 (8/8), and prostein (12/13). Conversely, basal cytokeratins such as CK14 and CK15 were negative in all cases (0/8) and CK5/6 was weakly and focally positive in 36% (4/11) of cases. Pluripotency markers including β-catenin, Oct4, and c-kit were negative in p63-expressing tumors (0/11). Despite nearly universal expression of androgen receptor and downstream androgen signaling targets, p63-expressing tumors lacked ERG rearrangements by fluorescence in situ hybridization (0/14) and ERG protein expression (0/37). No tumors expressed SPINK1 or showed PTEN protein loss (0/19). Surprisingly, 74% (14/19) of p63-expressing tumors expressed GSTP1 protein at least focally, and 33% (2/6) entirely lacked GSTP1 CpG island hypermethylation by bisulfite sequencing. In contrast to usual prostatic adenocarcinomas, prostate tumors with p63 expression show a mixed luminal/basal immunophenotype, uniformly lack ERG gene rearrangement, and frequently express GSTP1. These data strongly suggest that p63-expressing prostate tumors represent a molecularly distinct subclass and further study of this rare tumor type may yield important insights into the role of p63 in prostatic biology and the prostate cancer cell-of-origin.

Here, we have used whole-genome sequencing and molecular pathological analyses to characterize the lethal cell clone in a patient who died of prostate cancer. We tracked the evolution of the lethal cell clone from the primary cancer to metastases through samples collected during disease progression and at the time of death. Surprisingly, these analyses revealed that the lethal clone arose from a small, relatively low-grade cancer focus in the primary tumor, and not from the bulk, higher-grade primary cancer or from a lymph node metastasis resected at prostatectomy. Despite being limited to one case, these findings highlight the potential importance of developing and implementing molecular prognostic and predictive markers, such as alterations of tumor suppressor proteins PTEN or p53, to augment current pathological evaluation and delineate clonal heterogeneity. Furthermore, this case illustrates the potential need in precision medicine to longitudinally sample metastatic lesions to capture the evolving constellation of alterations during progression. Similar comprehensive studies of additional prostate cancer cases are warranted to understand the extent to which these issues may challenge prostate cancer clinical management. ",

Despite efforts to understand the mechanisms of prostate cancer development and progression, the reasons for the disease remain unclear. Although recurrent DNA copy number aberrations in prostate cancer have been well documented in the past 15 years, most of the target genes for these aberrations remain to be identified. The most common DNA copy number aberrations are losses in chromosomes 5q, 6q, 8p, 10q, 13q, 16q, 17p, and 18q, and gains in 7p/q, 8q, 9p, and Xq. In addition, a chromosomal rearrangement in 21q has been observed in over 50% of prostate cancers. The target genes for two common chromosomal aberrations have been identified: the androgen receptor (AR) gene at Xq12, and TMPRSS2 and ERG at 21q. Putative target genes for other copy number aberrations include: NKX3-1 (8p loss), PTEN and MXI1 (10q loss), FOXO1A (13q loss), CDH1 and ATBF1 (16q loss), MCM7 and EZH2 (7q gain), TCEB1, EIF3S3 and MYC (8q gain).

As such, selective inactivation of this pathway may provide opportunities to attack prostate cancer from all fronts. However, while preclinical studies examining specific inhibitors of PI3K or mTOR have yielded promising results, the evidence from clinical trials is less convincing. Emerging evidence from the analyses of some solid tumors suggests that a class of dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, which bind to and inactivate both PI3K and mTOR, may achieve better anti-cancer outcomes. In this review, we will summarize the mechanisms of action of these inhibitors, their effectiveness when used alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic compounds, and their potential to serve as the next generation therapies for prostate cancer patients, particularly those who are resistant to the frontline chemotherapeutic drugs.

To explore disease heterogeneity at the genomic level, we carried out array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) on 64 prostate tumor specimens, including 55 primary tumors and 9 pelvic lymph node metastases. Unsupervised cluster analysis of DNA copy number alterations (CNA) identified recurrent aberrations, including a 6q15-deletion group associated with subtype-1 gene expression patterns and decreased tumor recurrence. Supervised analysis further disclosed distinct patterns of CNA among gene-expression subtypes, where subtype-1 tumors exhibited characteristic deletions at 5q21 and 6q15, and subtype-2 cases harbored deletions at 8p21 (NKX3-1) and 21q22 (resulting in TMPRSS2-ERG fusion).

Clinical trials showed insignificant clinical benefit in patients with castration resistant prostate cancer both when EGFR inhibitors were administered as monotherapy or in association with antiandrogens or chemotherapeutics. Why, differently to other tumors, have EGFR inhibitors been so ineffective in human prostate cancer? This is the question that we have set in this report.;For this purpose, the effectiveness of erlotinib, a selective EGFR inhibitor, in a wide range of prostate cancer cells (wild type or engineered to overexpress peculiar proteins including androgen receptor and PTEN).;We demonstrated that the effectiveness of erlotinib was inversely correlated to the EGFR/Her2 ratio rather than EGFR/p-EGFR or Her2/p-Her2 levels. Chronic treatment with bicalutamide induced overexpression of Her2 and reduction of EGFR/Her2ratio and this was associated with increased Akt and Erk activity. In these conditions of treatment a reduced efficacy of erlotinib was observed. At the same time, an increased efficacy versus erlotinib was documented in cancer cells chronically exposed to DHT. In these culture conditions low levels of Her2 and increased EGFR/Her2 ratio were evidenced.;Taken together, our results seem to suggest that a low EGFR/Her2 ratio and PTEN absence are the main factors responsible of erlotinib inefficacy. Therefore the inhibition of EGFR could have important antitumor effects in hormone-naive rather than in hormonally treated patients.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Licorice extract which is used as a natural sweetener has been shown to possess inhibitory effects against prostate cancer, but the mechanisms responsible are poorly understood. Here, we report a compound, isoangustone A (IAA) in licorice that potently suppresses the growth of aggressive prostate cancer and sought to clarify its mechanism of action. We analyzed its inhibitory effects on the growth of PTEN-deleted human prostate cancer cells, in vitro and in vivo. Administration of IAA significantly attenuated the growth of prostate cancer cell cultures and xenograft tumors. These effects were found to be attributable to inhibition of the G1/S phase cell cycle transition and the accumulation of p27(kip1). The elevated p27(kip1) expression levels were concurrent with the decrease of its phosphorylation at threonine 187 through suppression of CDK2 kinase activity and the reduced phosphorylation of Akt at Serine 473 by diminishing the kinase activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Further analysis using recombinant proteins and immunoprecipitated cell lysates determined that IAA exerts suppressive effects against CDK2 and mTOR kinase activity by direct binding with both proteins. These findings suggested that the licorice compound IAA is a potent molecular inhibitor of CDK2 and mTOR, with strong implications for the treatment of prostate cancer. Thus, licorice-derived extracts with high IAA content warrant further clinical investigation for nutritional sources for prostate cancer patients. ",

Bladder neck invasion, pelvic and mediastinal lymph node metastases and multiple bone metastases were found. The case was diagnosed with prostatic adenocarcinoma T3N2M1 (OSS, LYM) stage D2. Three courses of chemotherapy using ifosfamide applied from Feb. 2, 1980 showed no marked effect except for partial pain relief. Hormonal treatment with diethylstilbestrol diphosphate was started from May 28 and arterial infusion chemotherapy using CDDP and 5-FU was performed 2 months later, resulting in size reduction of the prostate and pelvic lymph node metastases and disappearance of mediastinal lymph node metastases. Needle biopsy of the prostate was negative for cancer cells. After 8 months, Tegafur was started, and 12 months later radiotherapy was added to the prostate and pelvic lymph nodes. The abnormal accumulation in bone scan began to decrease after 14 months and achieved complete remission 28 months after the initial therapy. We discontinued the hormonal therapy 31 months later because of his complaint of chest discomfort and palpitation. At the present time, 14 years after the initial therapy, the prostate was 35 x 29 x 19 mm in size on transrectal ultrasonography with undetectable serum PSA level and no tumor cells but only mass fibrosis has been seen by pathological examinations.

Although largely characterized as indolent, poor outcomes have been reported in a considerable fraction of cases. As yet, optimum treatment strategies for this cancer have not been developed. This study investigates protein expression of common or potential molecular therapeutic targets and reports on the clinicopathological features of 9 new cases. We evaluated the expression of ERBB2, KIT, androgen receptor, PTEN, EGFR, ERG, and p53 via immunohistochemistry. We also examined EGFR amplification and TMPRSS2-ERG gene rearrangement by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The mean clinical follow-up was 44 months. We found that basal cell carcinoma behaved aggressively with almost one-half of the cases displaying high-risk pathologic features or local recurrence (44%). One patient died as a result of metastatic disease. The most consistent abnormalities included a loss of PTEN expression (56% of cases) and EGFR overexpression (67% of cases). EGFR overexpression occurred in the absence of gene amplification. The TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement was not detected in any of the tumors studied, nor was ERG protein positivity identified by immunostaining. In addition, ERBB2, KIT, p53, and androgen receptor expressions were either absent or showed only weak, limited reactivity. Our results suggest that there is a high morbidity associated with this tumor, and more intense follow-up and additional treatment may be indicated. Furthermore, targeted therapies directed against the EGFR and PTEN proteins or their constitutive pathways may be promising for future clinical management. ",

Flow cytometry (FCM) was used to assess the cell cycle in LNCaP and PC-3 cells. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was applied to examine the expression of PTEN gene (a tumor suppressor gene), estrogen receptor alpha gene (ERalpha), estrogen receptor beta gene (ERbeta), androgen receptor gene (AR) and vascular endothelial growth factor gene (VEGF).;The viability of PC-3 and LNCaP cells decreased with increasing concentrations and exposure time of genistein and daidzein. Genistein increased G2/M phase cells in PC-3 cells while decreased S phase cells in LNCaP cells in a dose-dependent manner. Daidzein exerted no influence on the cell cycle of LNCaP and PC-3 cells, but the apoptosis percentage of LNCaP cells was elevated significantly by daidzein. Genistein induced the expression of PTEN gene in PC-3 and LNCaP cells. Daidzein induced the expression of PTEN gene in LNCaP but not in PC-3 cells. The expression of VEGF, ERalpha and ERbeta genes decreased and AR gene was not expressed after incubation with genistein and daidzein in PC-3 cells. In LNCaP cells, the expression of VEGF and AR gene decreased but there was no change in the expression of ERalpha and ERbeta gene after incubation with genistein and daidzein. Conclusion Genistein and daidzein exert a time- and dose-dependent inhibitory effect on PC-3 and LNCaP cells. The down-regulation of ER gene by daidzein influences the growth of PC-3 cells directly. The inhibition of PC-3 cells by genistein and that of LNCaP cells by genistein and daidzein may be via Akt pathway that is repressed by PTEN gene, which subsequently down-regulates the expression of AR and VEGF genes. Our results suggest that the expression of PTEN gene plays a key role and several pathways may be involved in the suppression of prostate cancer cells by genistein and daidzein.",

One proposed mechanism to account for androgen receptor (AR) activity in the castrate             environment is via crosstalk with other signaling pathways. Specifically, reciprocal             interactions between the AKT/mTOR and AR pathways have been implicated in prostate             cancer progression. Here, we used the potent inhibitor ridaforolimus to target             mTOR signaling alone and in combination with AR blockade by bicalutamide to examine             the effect of abrogating these signaling pathways. Ridaforolimus treatment inhibited             the proliferation of all six prostate cancer cell lines examined with the greatest             sensitivity associated with loss of PTEN and elevated AKT/mTOR pathway activity.             Dual inhibition of the AR and mTOR signaling pathways provided further benefit             with the ridaforolimus-bicalutamide combination producing synergistic antiproliferative             effects in prostate cancer cells in vitro when compared with each agent alone.             Pharmacodynamic analysis confirmed that combination treatment resulted in full             inhibition of each of the respective pathways. Importantly, the ridaforolimus-bicalutamide             combination exhibited potent antitumor activity with parallel reductions in plasma             PSA levels in vivo. Taken together, ridaforolimus exhibited potent antiproliferative             and antitumor activity in prostate cancer models and the addition of bicalutamide             represents a potentially effective combination strategy for patient therapy.",

Since most of the affected genes are hidden within large amplifications or deletions, there is a need for fast and faithful validation of drivers. However, classic genetic CaP engineering in mouse makes this a daunting task because generation, breeding based combination of alterations and non-invasive monitoring of disease are too time consuming and costly. To address the unmet need, we recently developed RapidCaP mice, which endogenously recreate human PTEN-mutant metastatic CaP based on Cre/Luciferase expressing viral infection, that is guided to Pten(loxP)/Trp53(loxP) prostate. Here we use a sensitized, non-metastatic Pten/Trp53-mutant RapidCaP system for functional validation of human metastasis drivers in a much accelerated time frame of only 3-4months. We used in vivo RNAi to target three candidate tumor suppressor genes FOXP1, RYBP and SHQ1, which reside in a frequent deletion on chromosome 3p and show that Shq1 cooperates with Pten and p53 to suppress metastasis. Our results thus demonstrate that the RapidCaP system forms a much needed platform for in vivo screening and validation of genes that drive endogenous lethal CaP. ",

Activation of NF-kappaB is induced by an IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex that phosphorylates and promotes dissociation of IkappaB from NF-kappaB, which then translocates into the nucleus. Activation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase/Akt signaling by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) activates IKK and NF-kappaB. The present study shows that PTEN, a tumor suppressor that inhibits PI 3-kinase function, impairs TNF activation of Akt and the IKK complex in 293 cells. Transient expression of PTEN suppressed IKK activation and TNF-induced NF-kappaB DNA binding and transactivation. Studies were conducted with PC-3 prostate cancer cells that do not express PTEN and DU145 prostate cancer cells that express PTEN. TNF activated Akt in PC-3 cells, but not in DU145 cells, and the ability of TNF to activate NF-kappaB was blocked by pharmacological inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity in PC-3 cells, but not in DU145 cells. Expression of PTEN in PC-3 cells to a level comparable with that endogenously present in DU145 cells inhibited TNF activation of NF-kappaB.

The protein product (PTEN) encodes a dual-specificity protein phosphatase and in addition can dephosphorylate certain lipid substrates. Herein, we show that PTEN protein induces a G1 block when reconstituted in PTEN-null cells. A PTEN mutant associated with Cowden's disease (PTEN;G129E) has protein phosphatase activity yet is defective in dephosphorylating inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate in vitro and fails to arrest cells in G1. These data suggest a link between induction of a cell-cycle block by PTEN and its ability to dephosphorylate, in vivo, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. In keeping with this notion, PTEN can inhibit the phosphatidylinositol 3,4, 5-trisphosphate-dependent Akt kinase, a downstream target of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and constitutively active, but not wild-type, Akt overrides a PTEN G1 arrest. Finally, tumor cells lacking PTEN contain high levels of activated Akt, suggesting that PTEN is necessary for the appropriate regulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway.",

Clinical factors, such as prostate-specific antigen value and derivatives, and pathological factors, such as stage and Gleason grading, are well kown prognostic factors. Nomograms can provide useful prediction in each clinical sceario. The field of molecular biomarkers is briskly evolving towards personalized medicine.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether such therapy can be improved by combining docetaxel with Aneustat (OMN54), a multivalent botanical drug candidate shown to have anti-prostate cancer activity in preliminary in vitro experiments, which is currently undergoing a Phase-I Clinical Trial. Human metastatic, androgen-independent C4-2 prostate cancer cells and NOD-SCID mice bearing PTEN-deficient, metastatic and PSA-secreting, patient-derived subrenal capsule LTL-313H prostate cancer tissue xenografts were treated with docetaxel and Aneustat, alone and in combination. In vitro, Aneustat markedly inhibited C4-2 cell replication in a dose-dependent manner. When Aneustat was combined with docetaxel, the growth inhibitions of the drugs were essentially additive. In vivo, however, the combination of docetaxel and Aneustat enhanced anti-tumor activity synergistically and very markedly, without inducing major host toxicity. Complete growth inhibition and shrinkage of the xenografts could be obtained with the combined drugs as distinct from the drugs on their own. Analysis of the gene expression of the xenografts using microarray indicated that docetaxel + Aneustat led to expanded anticancer activity, in particular to targeting of cancer hallmarks that were not affected by the single drugs. Our findings, obtained with a highly clinically relevant prostate cancer model, suggest, for the first time, that docetaxel-based therapy of advanced human prostate cancer may be improved by combining docetaxel with Aneustat.",

However, various conditions used during biopsy processing for histologic analysis may affect the performance of diagnostic tests, such as hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, immunohistochemistry (IHC), or in situ hybridization (ISH). One such condition that may affect diagnostic test performance is fixation duration in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF). For example, prostate needle biopsies are often <1 mm in diameter and thus overfixed. It is important to understand the impact of tissue fixation duration on diagnostic test performance to enable optimized assay procedures. This study was designed to study the effect of 10% NBF fixation duration of prostate needle biopsy on multiplexed quantum dot (QD) ISH assay of ERG and PTEN, 2 genes commonly altered in prostate cancer. The samples were also evaluated for H&E staining and ERG and PTEN IHC. H&E staining and ERG and PTEN IHC were acceptable for all the durations of fixation tested. For QD ISH, we observed good signals with biopsy samples fixed from 4 to 120 hours. Biopsy specimens fixed between 8 and 72 hours gave the best signal as scored by the study pathologist. In a separate cohort of 18 routinely processed prostate biopsy cores, all cores were stained successfully with the QD ISH assay, and results were 100% concordant to ERG and PTEN IHC.

Mechanisms that dictate nuclear import and, less extensively, nuclear export of PTEN have been described, however the relevance of these processes in disease states, particularly cancer, remain largely unknown. We investigated the impact of acid ceramidase on the nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of PTEN. Immunohistochemical analysis of a human prostate tissue microarray revealed that nuclear PTEN was lost in patients whose tumors had elevated acid ceramidase. We found that acid ceramidase promotes a reduction in nuclear PTEN that is dependent upon sphingosine 1-phosphate-mediated activation of Akt. We were further able to show that sphingosine 1-phosphate promotes formation of a complex between Crm1 and PTEN, and that leptomycin B prevents acid ceramidase and sphingosine 1-phosphate mediated loss of nuclear PTEN, suggesting an active exportin-mediated event. To investigate whether the tumor promoting aspects of acid ceramidase in prostate cancer depend upon its ability to export PTEN from the nucleus, we used enforced nuclear expression of PTEN to study docetaxel-induced apoptosis and cell killing, proliferation, and xenoengraftment. Interestingly, while acid ceramidase was able to protect cells expressing wild type PTEN from docetaxel, promote proliferation and xenoengraftment, acid ceramidase had no impact in cells expressing PTEN-NLS. These findings suggest that acid ceramidase, through sphingosine 1-phosphate, promotes nuclear export of PTEN as a means of promoting tumor formation, cell proliferation, and resistance to therapy.

Focal homozygous deletions were detected at 8p22, 10q23.31, 13q13.1, 13q14.11, and 13q14.12. Key genes mapping within these deleted regions include PTEN, BRCA2, C13ORF15, and SIAH3.

Furthermore, targeted mutational analysis of normal-tumor pairs has identified somatic mutations in genes known to be associated with prostate cancer including AR and TP53, but has also revealed novel somatic point mutations in genes including MTOR, BRCA2, ARHGEF12, and CHD5.

Due to its kinase activity, it serves as a molecular conduit for inhibiting apoptosis and promoting angiogenesis in most cell types. In most of the prostate tumors, Akt signaling is constitutively activated due to the deletion or mutation of the tumor suppressor PTEN, which negatively regulates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase through lipid phosphatase activity. Recently, we identified a natural compound, psoralidin, which inhibits Akt phosphorylation, and its consequent activation in androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC) cells. Furthermore, ectopic expression of Akt renders AIPC cells resistant to chemotherapy; however, psoralidin overcomes Akt-mediated resistance and induces apoptosis in AIPC cells. While dissecting the molecular events, both upstream and downstream of Akt, we found that psoralidin inhibits phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation and transcriptionally represses the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and its target genes (Bcl-2, Survivin, and Bcl-xL, etc.), which results in the inhibition of cell viability and induction of apoptosis in PC-3 and DU-145 cells. Interestingly, psoralidin selectively targets cancer cells without causing any toxicity to normal prostate epithelial cells. In vivo xenograft assays substantiate these in vitro findings and show that psoralidin inhibits prostate tumor growth in nude mice. Our findings are of therapeutic significance in the management of prostate cancer patients with advanced or metastatic disease, as they provide new directions for the development of a phytochemical-based platform for prevention and treatment strategies for AIPC.",

To determine the relevance of this finding to human prostate cancer, we examined the expression of BMPs and BMP receptors (BMPR) as well as the responsiveness to recombinant human BMP7 in a series of human prostate tumor cell lines. All prostatic cell lines tested expressed variable levels of BMP2, BMP4, and BMP7 and at least two of each type I and II BMPRs. In all cases, BMP7 induced Smad phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner, with Smad5 activation clearly demonstrable. However, the biological responses to BMP7 were cell type specific. BPH-1, a cell line representing benign prostatic epithelial hyperplasia, was growth arrested at G1. In the bone metastasis-derived PC-3 prostate cancer cells, BMP7 induced epithelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation with classic changes in morphology, motility, invasiveness, and molecular markers. Finally, BMP7 inhibited serum starvation-induced apoptosis in the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line and more remarkably in its bone metastatic variant C4-2B line. Each of the cell lines influenced by BMP7 was also responsive to BMP2 in a corresponding manner. The antiapoptotic activity of BMP7 in the LNCaP and C4-2B cell lines was not associated with a significant alteration in the levels of the proapoptotic protein Bax or the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis. However, in C4-2B cells but not in LNCaP cells, a starvation-induced decrease in the level of survivin was counteracted by BMP7. Taken together, these findings suggest that BMPs are able to modulate the biological behavior of prostate tumor cells in diverse and cell type-specific manner and point to certain mechanisms by which these secreted signaling molecules may contribute to prostate cancer growth and metastasis.",

Here, a role for AnxA1 in prostate adenocarcinoma was determined using primary cultures and a tumor cell line (cE1), all derived from the conditional Pten deletion mouse model of prostate cancer. AnxA1 secretion by prostate-derived cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) was significantly higher than by normal prostate fibroblasts (NPF). Prostate tumor cells were sorted to enrich for epithelial subpopulations based on nonhematopoietic lineage, high SCA-1, and high or medium levels of CD49f. Compared with controls, AnxA1 enhanced stem cell-like properties in high- and medium-expression subpopulations of sorted cE1 and primary cells, in vitro, through formation of greater number of spheroids with increased complexity, and in vivo, through generation of more, larger, and histologically complex glandular structures, along with increased expression of p63, a basal/progenitor marker. The differentiated medium-expression subpopulations from cE1 and primary cells were most susceptible to gain stem cell-like properties as shown by increased spheroid and glandular formation. Further supporting this increased plasticity, AnxA1 was shown to regulate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in cE1 cells. These results suggest that CAF-secreted AnxA1 contributes to tumor stem cell dynamics via two separate but complementary pathways: induction of a dedifferentiation process leading to generation of stem-like cells from a subpopulation of cancer epithelial cells and stimulation of proliferation and differentiation of the cancer stem-like cells.;AnxA1 participates in a paradigm in which malignant prostate epithelial cells that are not cancer stem cells are induced to gain cancer stem cell-like properties.",

However, the sites in PTEN that are phosphorylated in vivo have not been identified directly, nor has the effect of phosphorylation on PTEN catalytic activity been reported. We used mass spectrometric methods to identify Ser(370) and Ser(385) as in vivo phosphorylation sites of PTEN. These sites also are phosphorylated by CK2 in vitro, and phosphorylation inhibits PTEN activity towards its substrate, PIP3. We also identify a novel in vivo phosphorylation site, Thr(366). Following transient over-expression, a fraction of CK2 and PTEN co-immunoprecipitate. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of CK2 activity leads to decreased Akt activation in PTEN+/+ but not PTEN-/- fibroblasts. Our results contrast with previous assignments of PTEN phosphorylation sites based solely on mutagenesis approaches, suggest that CK2 is a physiologically relevant PTEN kinase, and raise the possibility that CK2-mediated inhibition of PTEN plays a role in oncogenesis.",

An approach that scrutinizes every cancer focus is needed in order to generate a comprehensive evaluation of the disease, and by correlating to patients' clinico-pathological information, specific prognostic biomarker can be identified. Our study utilized the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 Genome-wide assay to investigate forty-three fresh frozen PCa tissue foci from twenty-three patients. With a long clinical follow-up period that ranged from 2.0-9.7 (mean 5.4) years, copy number variation (CNV) data was evaluated for association with patients' PSA status during follow-up. From our results, the loss of unique genes on 10q23.31 and 10q23.2-10q23.31 were identified to be significantly associated to PSA recurrence (p < 0.05). The implication of PTEN and FAS loss (10q23.31) support previous reports due to their critical roles in prostate carcinogenesis. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the PAPSS2 gene (10q23.2-10q23.31) may be functionally relevant in post-operative PSA recurrence because of its reported role in androgen biosynthesis. It is suggestive that the loss of the susceptible region on chromosome 10q, which implicates PTEN, FAS and PAPSS2 may serve as genetic predictors of PSA recurrence after radical prostatectomy. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"One of the major obstacles in curing prostate cancer is the development of drug resistance. It is not only imperative to discover the molecular basis of resistance but also to find therapeutic agents that can disrupt the resistant pathways. Tumor necrosis factor TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand TRAIL-like ligands or agonist TRAIL-receptor monoclonal antibodies have entered phase I and II clinical trials with a very limited cytotoxic profile when used systemically in a variety of cancers. Therefore, TRAIL-receptor agonists are new proapoptotic pharmaceutical agents with great potential as new cancer therapeutic agents. Although many cancer cells undergo TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, some are resistant to TRAIL. Therefore, we have been investigating mechanisms to overcome TRAIL resistance in cancer cells so that TRAIL-associated compounds can be used effectively in clinical trials. Epigenetic inactivation of proapoptotic genes, or activation of survival signaling, can cause cross-resistance to several anti-tumor therapies and to immune cytotoxic lymphocytes. We hypothesize that 5-aza-2 deoxycytidine aza-dCR, decitabine may render TRAIL-resistant prostate cancer cells sensitive to caspase-8-mediated apoptosis and may, therefore, be therapeutically efficient. We evaluated the antiproliferative effects of decitabine on the following four prostate cancer cell lines: well-differentiated AR positive LnCaP p53(+), PTEN- and 22rv1 p53(+) and PTEN(+)]; poorly-differentiated AR negative PC3 p53-, PTEN- and DU145 p53 mutant, PTEN(+). Here, we provide evidence that treatment with sub-optimal concentrations of decitabine are additive to TRAIL effects in well-differentiated PCa cells whereas the same treatment shows synergistic effects in poorly-differentiated PCa cells through increased caspase-8 expression, down-modulation of Akt activation and through the expression of certain anti-apoptotic molecules including FLIP, PED/PEA-15, survivin and c-IAP-1. Our findings demonstrate that decitabine at relatively low concentrations restores caspase-8 expression and sensitises resistant PCa cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis leading to important implications in novel therapeutic strategies targeting defective apoptosis pathways in advanced prostate tumors.",

Inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a downstream target of phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling, results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in multiple in vitro and in vivo models of prostate cancer. However, single-agent use of mTOR inhibition has limited clinical success, and the identification of molecular events mitigating tumor response to mTOR inhibition remains a critical question. Here, using genetically engineered human prostate epithelial cells (PrEC), we show that MYC, a frequent target of genetic gain in prostate cancers, abrogates sensitivity to rapamycin by decreasing rapamycin-induced cytostasis and autophagy. Analysis of MYC and the mTOR pathway in human prostate tumors and PrEC showed selective increased expression of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) with gain in MYC copy number or forced MYC expression, respectively. We have also found that MYC binds to regulatory regions of the 4EBP1 gene. Suppression of 4EBP1 expression resulted in resensitization of MYC-expressing PrEC to rapamycin and increased autophagy. Taken together, our findings suggest that MYC expression abrogates sensitivity to rapamycin through increased expression of 4EBP1 and reduced autophagy.",

We now report a link between loss of protection against oxidative damage and loss-of-function of Nkx3.1, a homeobox gene that is known to be required for prostatic epithelial differentiation and suppression of prostate cancer. Using gene expression profiling, we find that Nkx3.1 mutant mice display deregulated expression of several antioxidant and prooxidant enzymes, including glutathione peroxidase 2 and 3 (GPx2 and GPx3), peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6), and sulfyhydryl oxidase Q6 (Qscn6). Moreover, the formation of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia in these mutant mice is associated with increased oxidative damage of DNA, as evident by increased levels of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine. We further show that progression to prostate adenocarcinoma, as occurs in compound mutant mice lacking Nkx3.1 as well as the Pten tumor suppressor, is correlated with a further deregulation of antioxidants, including superoxide dismutase enzymes, and more profound accumulations of oxidative damage to DNA and protein, the latter manifested by increased levels of 4-hydroxynonenal. We propose that the essential role of Nkx3.1 in maintaining the terminally differentiated state of the prostate epithelium provides protection against oxidative damage and, thereby, suppression of prostate cancer.

We used a global high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) assay to characterize copy number alterations (CNAs) in intermediate risk prostate cancer.

Here, we use whole genome sequencing of a prostate cancer tumor, computational analyses, and experimental validation to identify and predict novel oncogenic activity arising from a point mutation in the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) tumor suppressor protein. We demonstrate that this mutation (p.A126G) produces an enzymatic gain-of-function in PTEN, shifting its function from a phosphoinositide (PI) 3-phosphatase to a phosphoinositide (PI) 5-phosphatase. Using cellular assays, we demonstrate that this gain-of-function activity shifts cellular phosphoinositide levels, hyperactivates the PI3K/Akt cell proliferation pathway, and exhibits increased cell migration beyond canonical PTEN loss-of-function mutants. These findings suggest that mutationally modified PTEN can actively contribute to well-defined hallmarks of cancer. Lastly, we demonstrate that these effects can be substantially mitigated through chemical PI3K inhibitors. These results demonstrate a new dysfunction paradigm for PTEN cancer biology and suggest a potential framework for the translation of genomic data into actionable clinical strategies for targeted patient therapy.

Abnormal DNA content and deletions were linked to high Gleason score, advanced tumor stage, and positive nodal stage (P < 0.0001 each). The risk of PSA recurrence increased from diploid to tetraploid and from tetraploid to aneuploid DNA status (P < 0.0001 each). However, 40% of patients with Gleason score ≥4+4 and 55% of patients with PSA recurrence had diploid cancers.

The first phase, which is the growth of the androgen-dependent cancer (AD-Ca) responds well to androgen depletion treatment while the second phase, that could be termed as androgen depletion-independent cancer (ADI-Ca) does not. We used two separate prostate tumors, one AD-Ca and one ADI-Ca from the conditional Pten deletion mouse model to generate from each a pair of cell lines. The AD-Ca cell lines (E2 and E4) and the ADI-Ca cell lines (cE1 and cE2) display bi-allelic deletion at the Pten gene locus, an event which is specific for the prostate epithelium for this mouse model, and a fairly similar level of expression of the androgen receptor (AR). The ADI-Ca cell lines (cE series) grow well in the absence of androgen, display increased AR transcription under androgen-deprived environment, and retain the sensitivity to increased proliferation when androgen is supplemented. The AD-Ca cell lines (E series) grow slowly in the absence of androgen, and, unlike cE cells, do not show increased AR expression when maintained in the absence of androgen. The detection of epithelial cell markers, such as CK8, CK14, CK18 and E-cadherin in the cE series is conforming with the polygonal epithelial morphology of these cells in culture. The E cells also present mostly polygonal-shaped morphology with a small percent of cells with fibroblastoid morphology, and produce little or very low levels of cytokeratins, but increased levels of vimentin, Twist and Slug, the markers known to be associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Each of the cell lines, when inoculated subcutaneously into male or female NOD.SCID mice induced tumors within eight weeks with 100% incidence. Histopathological examinations of the tumor sections, however, led to noticeable biological differences. The cE series engenders adenocarcinomas, particularly in male hosts, and the E series induces sarcomatoid carcinomas (positively stained for CK8 and AR as well as vimentin expression) in either male or female hosts. These new cell lines are promising models for the elucidation of the androgen metabolism and their role in prostate cancer.",

PTEN is frequently inactivated in many tumour types including glioblastoma, prostate and endometrial cancers. While initial studies reported that PTEN gene mutations were rare in colorectal cancer, more recent reports have shown an approximate 18% incidence of somatic PTEN mutations in colorectal tumours exhibiting microsatellite instability (MSI+). To verify the role of this gene in colorectal tumorigenesis, we analysed paired normal and tumour DNA from 41 unselected primary sporadic colorectal cancers for PTEN inactivation by mutation and/or allelic loss. We now report PTEN gene mutations in 19.5% (8/41) of tumours and allele loss, including all or part of the PTEN gene, in a further 17% (7/41) of the cases. Both PTEN alleles were affected in over half (9/15) of these cases showing PTEN genetic abnormalities. Using immunohistochemistry, we have further shown that all tumours harbouring PTEN alterations have either reduced or absent PTEN expression and this correlated strongly with later clinical stage of tumour at presentation (P=0.02). In contrast to previous reports, all but one of the tumours with PTEN gene mutations were microsatellite stable (MSI-), suggesting that PTEN is involved in a distinct pathway of colorectal tumorigenesis that is separate from the pathway of mismatch repair deficiency.

PTEN is a dual protein/lipid phosphatase and its main substrate phosphatidyl-inositol 3,4,5 triphosphate (PIP3) is the product of PI3K. Increase in PIP3 recruits AKT to the membrane where is activated by other kinases also dependent on PIP3. Many components of this pathway have been described as causal forces in cancer. PTEN activity is lost by mutations, deletions or promoter methylation silencing at high frequency in many primary and metastatic human cancers. Germ line mutations of PTEN are found in several familial cancer predisposition syndromes. Recently, many activating mutations in the PI3KCA gene (coding for the p110alpha catalytic subunit of PI3K) have been described in human tumors. Activation of PI3K and AKT are reported to occur in breast, ovarian, pancreatic, esophageal and other cancers. Genetically modified mice confirm these PTEN activities. Tissue-specific deletions of PTEN usually provoke cancer. Moreover, an absence of PTEN cooperates with an absence of p53 to promote cancer. However, we have observed very different results with the expression of activated versions of AKT in several tissues. Activated AKT transgenic lines do not develop tumors in breast or prostate tissues and do not cooperate with an absence of p53. This data suggest that an AKT-independent mechanism contributes to PTEN tumorigenesis. Crosses with transgenic mice expressing possible PTEN targets indicate that neither cyclin D1 nor p53 are these AKT-independent targets. However, AKT is more than a passive bridge toward PTEN tumorigenesis, since its expression not only allows but also enforces and accelerates the tumorigenic process in combination with other oncogenes.",

In this regard, mTOR activity is associated with cancer cell growth and survival. Here, we have explored an involvement of the I kappa B kinase (IKK) pathway, associated with nuclear factor-kappaB activation, in controlling mTOR activity. The experiments show that IKK alpha controls mTOR kinase activity in Akt-active, PTEN-null prostate cancer cells, with less involvement by IKK beta. In these cells, IKK alpha associates with mTOR, as part of the TORC1 complex, in an Akt-dependent manner. Additionally, IKKalpha is required for efficient induction of mTOR activity downstream of constitutively active Akt expression. The results indicate a novel role for IKK alpha in controlling mTOR function in cancer cells with constitutive Akt activity.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Genetic alterations targeting the PTEN tumor suppressor gene are among the most frequently noted somatic mutations in human cancers. Such lesions have been noted in cancers of the prostate and endometrium and in glioblastoma multiforme, among many others. Moreover, germline mutation of PTEN leads to the development of the related hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes, Cowden disease, and Bannayan-Zonana syndrome, wherein breast and thyroid cancer incidence is elevated. The protein product, PTEN, is a lipid phosphatase, the enzymatic activity of which primarily serves to remove phosphate groups from key intracellular phosphoinositide signaling molecules. This activity normally serves to restrict growth and survival signals by limiting activity of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway. Multiple lines of evidence support the notion that this function is critical to the ability of PTEN to maintain cell homeostasis. Indeed, the absence of functional PTEN in cancer cells leads to constitutive activation of downstream components of the PI3K pathway including the Akt and mTOR kinases. In model organisms, inactivation of these kinases can reverse the effects of PTEN loss. These data raise the possibility that drugs targeting these kinases, or PI3K itself, might have significant therapeutic activity in PTEN-null cancers. Akt kinase inhibitors are still in development; however, as a first test of this hypothesis, phase I and phase II trials of inhibitors of mTOR, namely, rapamycin and rapamycin analogs are underway.",

Using a case-only design, subjects were identified from three Australian epidemiological studies. Men who had died of their disease, \"cases\" (N = 83), were matched to \"referents\" (N = 232), those who had not died of prostate cancer, using incidence density sampling. Diagnostic tissue was retrieved to assess expression of AZGP1, MUC1, NKX3.1, p53, and PTEN by semiquantitative immunohistochemistry (IHC). Poisson regression was used to estimate mortality rate ratios (MRRs) adjusted for age, Gleason score, and stage and to estimate survival probabilities.

Induction of cell death required the mitochondrial pathway, as prostate-specific coexpression of BCL2 blocked apoptosis. Thus, there is an mTOR-dependent survival signal required downstream of Akt.

Numerous physiological processes have been ascribed to this evolutionarily conserved molecule including proliferation, cell size determination, survival, differentiation, and cell fate specification. Indeed, mutation in PTEN gene is the genetic cause of Cowden Syndrome. Structurally, the 54-kilodalton protein is composed of two major functional domains crucial for catalytic and membrane binding functions. Additional regulatory regions in both amino- and carboxyl-termini further dictate its structural integrity, catalytic activity, and subcellular localization. Extensive characterization of PTEN primary coding sequence has revealed a multitude of post-translational modifications that fine-tune its biochemical properties. These include phosphorylation, ubiquitination, redox modifications, and acetylation. This article aims to provide an in-depth review of the diverse post-translational modifications of PTEN, focusing on their biological relevance in both normal and cancer cells. The potential applications to cancer therapy by modulating the post-translational modifications of PTEN will also be discussed.",

To circumvent the paucity of human tissues available for analyses, we used the Ctnnb1(tm1Mmt/+);Pten(tm1Hwu/tmiHwu);Amhr2(tm3(cre)Bhr/+) transgenic mouse model, which features the constitutive activation of CTNNB1 signaling combined with the loss of Pten in granulosa cells and develops GCTs that mimic aggressive forms of the human disease. Proteomic profiling by mass spectrometry showed that vinculin, enolase 1, several heat shock proteins, and valosin containing protein (VCP) were more abundantly secreted by cultured mouse GCT cells compared to primary cultured GC. Among these proteins, only VCP was present in significantly increased levels in the preoperative serum of GCT cancer patients compared to normal subjects. To determine the specificity of VCP, serum levels were also measured in ovarian carcinoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and breast, colon, pancreatic, lung, and prostate cancer patients. Increased serum VCP levels were observed in the majority of cancer cases, with the exception of patients with lung or prostate cancer. Moreover, serum VCP levels were increased in some GCT, ovarian carcinoma, breast cancer, and colon cancer patients who did not otherwise display increased levels of widely used serum tumor markers for their cancer type (e.g. inhibin A, inhibin B, CA125, CEA, or CA15.3). These results demonstrate the potential use of VCP as highly sensitive serum marker for GCT as well as several other human cancers.",

It contains an amino-terminal phosphatase domain and acts as a phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate phosphatase antagonizing the activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase. PTEN also contains a carboxyl-terminal domain, and we addressed the role of this region that, analogous to the amino-terminal phosphatase domain, is the target of many mutations identified in tumors. Expression of carboxyl-terminal mutants in PTEN-deficient glioblastoma cells permitted the anchorage-independent growth of the cells that otherwise was suppressed by wild-type PTEN. The stability of these mutants in cells was reduced because of rapid degradation. Although the carboxyl-terminal region contains regulatory PEST sequences and a PDZ-binding motif, these specific elements were dispensable for the tumor-suppressor function. The study of carboxyl-terminal point mutations affecting the stability of PTEN revealed that these were located in strongly predicted beta-strands. Surprisingly, the phosphatase activity of these mutants was affected in correlation with the degree of disruption of these structural elements. We conclude that the carboxyl-terminal region is essential for regulating PTEN stability and enzymatic activity and that mutations in this region are responsible for the reversion of the tumor-suppressor phenotype. We also propose that the molecular conformational changes induced by these mutations constitute the mechanism for PTEN inactivation.",

A tissue microarray containing 3,261 prostate cancers and 49 normal prostate samples with clinical follow-up data was analyzed for p(Ser2448)-mTOR expression by immunohistochemistry. Moderate to strong p(Ser2448)-mTOR staining was found in all (n = 49) normal prostate tissues, but was lost in 24% or weak in 29% cancers. Moderate and strong staining was found in 36 and 11% of tumors.

Employing a novel dual reporter prostate cancer model, epithelial and stromal transcriptomic profiling identified CXCL5 as a cancer-secreted chemokine to attract CXCR2-expressing MDSCs, and, correspondingly, pharmacologic inhibition of CXCR2 impeded tumor progression. Integrated analyses identified hyperactivated Hippo-YAP signaling in driving CXCL5 upregulation in cancer cells through the YAP-TEAD complex and promoting MDSC recruitment. Clinicopathologic studies reveal upregulation and activation of YAP1 in a subset of human prostate tumors, and the YAP1 signature is enriched in primary prostate tumor samples with stronger expression of MDSC-relevant genes. Together, YAP-driven MDSC recruitment via heterotypic CXCL5-CXCR2 signaling reveals an effective therapeutic strategy for advanced prostate cancer.;We demonstrate a critical role of MDSCs in prostate tumor progression and discover a cancer cell nonautonomous function of the Hippo-YAP pathway in regulation of CXCL5, a ligand for CXCR2-expressing MDSCs.

However, the molecular mechanism of genistein action is not known. We tested the hypothesis that genistein activates expression of several aberrantly silenced tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) that have unmethylated promoters such as PTEN, CYLD, p53 and FOXO3a. We report here that genistein activates TSGs through remodeling of the heterochromatic domains at promoters in prostate cancer cells by modulating histone H3-Lysine 9 (H3-K9) methylation and deacetylation. Genistein activation involved demethylation and acetylation of H3-K9 at the PTEN and the CYLD promoter, while acetylation of H3-K9 at the p53 and the FOXO3a promoter occurred through reduction of endogenous SIRT1 activity. There was a decrease of SIRT1 expression and accumulation of SIRT1 in the cytoplasm from the nucleus. Increased expression of these TSGs was also reciprocally related to attenuation of phosphorylated-AKT and NF-kappaB binding activity in prostate cancer cells. This is the first report describing a novel epigenetic pathway that activates TSGs by modulating either histone H3-Lysine 9 (H3-K9) methylation or deacetylation at gene promoters leading to inhibition of the AKT signaling pathway.

As part of our efforts to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for FAS overexpression, we have addressed the question whether overexpression of FAS may be linked to the frequently observed inactivation of PTEN and subsequent activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3k) pathway. Using LNCaP prostate cancer cells as an experimental paradigm of FAS-overexpressing PTEN-null cancer cells, we demonstrate that LY294002, an inhibitor of the PI3k pathway causes a dramatic decrease in FAS protein expression. Smaller but still substantial effects are seen at the FAS mRNA level and at the level of transcriptional activity of FAS promoter-reporter constructs. Consistent with these findings, reintroduction of PTEN results in decreased levels of FAS expression in a manner that is dependent on its lipid phosphatase activity. In support of a role for Akt/protein kinase B as a downstream effector, cotransfection of constitutively active Akt1/protein kinase B alpha abrogates the inhibitory effects of PTEN expression and restores FAS promoter activity. Taken together, these results demonstrate that inactivation of PTEN and subsequent activation of the PI3k/Akt kinase pathway may play an important role in the overexpression of the FAS protein in cancer cells.",

The difference of 5' nucleotide sequence resulted in the variation in the amino terminal ends of the two, brain and prostate, types of human hippostasin. The longest ORF of the brain-type was 250 amino acids with a putative signal peptide, while that of the prostate-type was 282 amino acids. Homology search using the amino acid sequence revealed that prostate-type hippostasin was identical to TLSP (PRSS20), which is expressed in human primary keratinocytes (1). Transient expression analysis showed that both brain- and prostate-type TLSP/hippostasin were secreted into the conditioned medium as about 40 kDa proteins. Human TLSP/hippostasin showed 47% and 45% identity to trypsinogen II and kallikrein, respectively. In fact, the recombinant human TLSP/hippostasin efficiently cleaved Bz-Phe-Arg-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide, a kallikrein substrate, and weakly cleaved other substrates for kallikrein and trypsin. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.3 kb band in the whole brain and a 1.4 kb band in the prostate and the lung. In situ hybridization revealed that it was expressed preferentially by the pyramidal neurons in the human hippocampus and secretory epithelial cells in the prostate. These results indicated that TLSP/hippostasin is involved in the functions of the human central nervous system and prostate and that it is a multifunctional protease present in various organs.",

The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of Palomid 529 (P529), a novel TORC1/TORC2 inhibitor, in association with docetaxel (DTX) and cisplatin (CP). This work utilizes a wide panel of prostatic cancer cell lines with or without basal activation of Akt as well as two in vivo models of aggressive HRPC. The blockade of Akt/mTOR activity was associated to reduced cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Comparison of IC50 values calculated for PTEN-positive and PTEN-negative cell lines as well as the PTEN transfection in PC3 cells or PTEN silencing in DU145 cells revealed that absence of PTEN was indicative for a better activity of the drug. In addition, P529 synergized with DTX and CP. The strongest synergism was achieved when prostate cancer (PCa) cells were sequentially exposed to CP or DTX followed by treatment with P529. Treatment with P529 before the exposure to chemotherapeutic drugs resulted in a moderate synergism, whereas intermediated values of combination index were found when drugs were administered simultaneously. In vivo treatment of a combination of P529 with DTX or CP increased the percentage of complete responses and reduced the number of mice with tumor progression. Our results provide a rationale for combinatorial treatment using conventional chemotherapy and a Akt/mTOR inhibitor as promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of HRPC, a disease largely resistant to conventional therapies.",

As the PCa research field has matured, the second generation of models has incorporated the single and multiple molecular changes observed in human disease, such as loss of PTEN and overexpression of Myc. Application of these models has revealed that mice are particularly resistant to developing invasive PCa, and once they achieve invasive disease, the PCa rarely resembles human disease. Nevertheless, these models and their application have provided vital information on human PCa progression.

Nevertheless, the monoclonality of morphologically heterogeneous (Gleason score 7) tumour foci would suggest that genetic biomarkers, arising early in prostate carcinogenesis, may overcome issues related to intratumoural heterogeneity. In spite of the above limitations, a few biomarkers including the proliferation marker Ki-67 and genetic markers such as c-MYC and PTEN have consistently shown their independent prognostic impact both for biochemical recurrence and for clinical outcome parameters such as metastatic disease or prostate-specific mortality. The routine application of biomarkers requiring immunostaining (e.g. Ki-67) has particularly been hindered by the lack of standardized protocols for processing and scoring, while the application of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technology is considered more labour intensive but better standardized. Future steps to enhance the uptake of prostate tissue biomarkers should be focused on prospective studies, particularly on prostate biopsy specimens, using protocols that are highly standardized for the processing and scoring of the biomarkers.

Because a number of tumor suppressor genes are known to be silenced by aberrant promoter methylation, we examined the methylation status of the 5' CpG islands of PTEN using methylation-specific PCR. The altered expression of PTEN in 310 gastric carcinomas was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining using tissue-array and clinicopathologic profiles related to PTEN expression were characterized. Of 310 consecutive gastric carcinomas, 62 cases (20%) showed expression loss of PTEN. Altered PTEN expression was significantly associated with tumor depth and size, lymphatic invasion, advanced stage, pTNM stage, and patient survival (p < 0.001). The promoter methylation frequency of PTEN was found to be present in 26 (39%) of 66 cases examined, and 19 (73%) of 26 gastric cancer tissues showing promoter methylation exhibited the loss of PTEN expression. Abnormalities in the expression of PTEN significantly correlated with promoter methylation (p < 0.001). In conclusion, silencing of the PTEN gene occurs frequently in gastric carcinoma and aberrant promoter methylation is a major mechanism of silencing of the PTEN gene.

A broad variety of human cancers carry PTEN alterations, including glioblastomas, endometrial, breast, thyroid and prostate cancers. The PTEN protein has at least two biochemical functions: it has both lipid phosphatase and protein phosphatase activity. The lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN decreases intracellular PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) level and downstream Akt activity. Cell-cycle progression is arrested at G1/S, mediated at least partially through the upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27. In addition, agonist-induced apoptosis is mediated by PTEN, through the upregulation of proapoptotic machinery involving caspases and BID, and the downregulation of antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl2. The protein phosphatase activity of PTEN is apparently less central to its involvement in tumorigenesis. It is involved in the inhibition of focal adhesion formation, cell spreading and migration, as well as the inhibition of growth factor-stimulated MAPK signaling. Therefore, the combined effects of the loss of PTEN lipid and protein phosphatase activity may result in aberrant cell growth and escape from apoptosis, as well as abnormal cell spreading and migration. In melanoma, PTEN loss has been mostly observed as a late event, although a dose-dependent loss of PTEN protein and function has been implicated in early stages of tumorigenesis as well. In addition, loss of PTEN and oncogenic activation of RAS seem to occur in a reciprocal fashion, both of which could cooperate with CDKN2A loss in contribution to melanoma tumorigenesis.",

With time, 10% of FPten(flox/flox) mice spontaneously developed pedicellate papillary transitional cell carcinomas (TCC). This type of tumor also arose in FPten(flox/flox) mice treated with the chemical carcinogen N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine.

In advanced bladder cancers, PTEN protein was significantly reduced (particularly in the nucleus) in 94% of cases, and this decrease in PTEN correlated with disease stage and grade.

We have previously reported acute and late incidence of genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity; here we report protocol-defined 5-year relapse-free survival outcomes.;We did an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial at seven Dutch radiotherapy centres. We enrolled patients with intermediate-risk to high-risk T1b-T4NX-N0MX-M0 localised prostate cancer, a prostate-specific antigen concentration of 60 μg/L or less, and a WHO performance status of 0-2. We used a web-based application to randomly assign (1:1) patients to either hypofractionated radiotherapy of 64·6 Gy (19 fractions of 3·4 Gy, three fractions per week) or conventionally fractionated radiotherapy of 78·0 Gy (39 fractions of 2·0 Gy, five fractions per week). Based on an estimated α/β ratio for prostate cancer of 1·5 Gy, the equivalent total dose in fractions of 2·0 Gy was 90·4 Gy for hypofractionation compared with 78·0 Gy for conventional fractionation. The primary endpoint was relapse-free survival. All analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis in all eligible patients. The HYPRO trial completed recruitment in 2010 and follow-up is ongoing. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN85138529.;Between March 19, 2007, and Dec 3, 2010, 820 patients were enrolled, of whom 804 were eligible and assessable for intention-to-treat analyses.

However, the mechanisms leading to this aberrant PTEN localization in human cancers are currently unknown. We have previously reported that ubiquitinylation of PTEN at specific lysine residues regulates its nuclear-cytoplasmic partitioning. Here we show that functional promyelocytic leukaemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies co-ordinate PTEN localization by opposing the action of a previously unknown PTEN-deubiquitinylating enzyme, herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease (HAUSP, also known as USP7), and that the integrity of this molecular framework is required for PTEN to be able to enter the nucleus. We find that PTEN is aberrantly localized in acute promyelocytic leukaemia, in which PML function is disrupted by the PML-RARalpha fusion oncoprotein. Remarkably, treatment with drugs that trigger PML-RARalpha degradation, such as all-trans retinoic acid or arsenic trioxide, restore nuclear PTEN. We demonstrate that PML opposes the activity of HAUSP towards PTEN through a mechanism involving the adaptor protein DAXX (death domain-associated protein). In support of this paradigm, we show that HAUSP is overexpressed in human prostate cancer and is associated with PTEN nuclear exclusion. Thus, our results delineate a previously unknown PML-DAXX-HAUSP molecular network controlling PTEN deubiquitinylation and trafficking, which is perturbed by oncogenic cues in human cancer, in turn defining a new deubiquitinylation-dependent model for PTEN subcellular compartmentalization.",

To identify genes differentially regulated by androgens in each prostate lobe, the rat castration model was used. Microarray analysis was performed to compare dorsolateral (DLP) and ventral prostate (VP) samples from sham-castrated, castrated, and testosterone-replenished castrated rats. Our data demonstrate that, after castration, the VP and the DLP differed in the number of genes with altered expression (1496 in VP vs. 256 in DLP) and the nature of pathways modulated. Gene signatures related to apoptosis and immune response specific to the ventral prostate were identified. Microarray and RT-PCR analyses demonstrated the androgen repression of IGF binding protein-3 and -5, CCAAT-enhancer binding protein-delta, and phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) genes, previously implicated in apoptosis. We show that PTEN protein was increased only in the luminal epithelial cells of the VP, suggesting that it may be a key mediator of VP apoptosis in the absence of androgens. The castration-induced immune/inflammatory gene cluster observed specifically in the VP included IL-15 and IL-18. Immunostaining of the VP, but not the DLP, showed an influx of T cells, macrophages, and mast cells, suggesting that these cells may be the source of the immune signature genes. Interestingly, IL-18 was localized mainly to the basal epithelial cells and the infiltrating macrophages in the regressing VP, whereas IL-15 was induced in the luminal epithelium. The VP castration model exhibits immune cell infiltration and loss of PTEN that is often observed in progressive PCa, thereby making this model useful for further delineation of androgen-regulated gene expression with relevance to PCa.",

Although PTEN mutations are present in complex atypical hyperplasia and carcinoma, PIK3CA mutations are restricted to carcinoma. We generated mouse models harboring Pten loss and/or activated Pik3ca in the endometrial epithelium to investigate their respective roles in the pathogenesis of UEC. Presence of an activated mutant Pik3ca on the background of Pten loss led to aggressive disease, with 100% of mice exhibiting carcinoma. Expression of Pik3ca with E545K mutation alone was unable to cause hyperplasia or cancer in the uterus and did not activate Akt as effectively as Pten deletion in short-term cultures of mouse endometrial epithelium, likely explaining the lack of phenotype in vivo. We also report that nuclear localization of FOXO1 correlated with PTEN mutational status irrespective of the PIK3CA status in endometrial cancer cell lines. Furthermore, gene expression profiles resulting from Pten loss or activation of Pik3ca in primary mouse endometrial epithelial cells exhibit minimal overlap. Thus, Pten and Pik3ca have distinct consequences on the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway in endometrial epithelium and are likely to affect other nonoverlapping cellular mechanisms involved in the development and progression of the most common type of uterine cancer.",

In this report, we offer evidence that a critical support of IGF-I in prostate cancer is mediated by its ability to suppress BMP4-induced apoptosis and Smad-mediated gene expression. Suppression of BMP4 signaling by IGF-I was reversed by chemical inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, or mTOR; by enforced expression of wild-type PTEN or dominant-negative PI3K; or by small hairpin RNA-mediated silencing of mTORC1/2 subunits Raptor or Rictor. Similarly, IGF-I suppressed BMP4-induced transcription of the Id1, Id2, and Id3 genes that are crucially involved in prostate tumor progression through PI3K-dependent and mTORC1/2-dependent mechanisms. Immunohistochemical analysis of non-malignant and malignant prostate tissues offered in vivo support for our model that IGF-I-mediated activation of mTOR suppresses phosphorylation of the BMP-activated Smad transcription factors. Our results offer the first evidence that IGF-I signaling through mTORC1/2 is a key homeostatic regulator of BMP4 function in prostate epithelial cells, acting at two levels to repress both the proapoptotic and pro-oncogenic signals of BMP-activated Smads. We suggest that deregulation of this homeostatic control may be pivotal to the development and progression of prostate cancer, providing important implications and new potential targets for the therapeutic intervention of this malignancy.",

Previously, we found that PTEN loss by IHC was associated with increased risk of upgrading from biopsy (Gleason 3 + 3) to prostatectomy (Gleason 7+). Now, using an evaluable subset of 111 patients with adjacent biopsy sections, we analyzed the association between PTEN deletion in cancer and the odds of upgrading by a highly sensitive and specific four-color FISH assay. We also compared the concordance of PTEN loss by IHC and PTEN deletion by FISH. PTEN deletion was found in 27 % (12/45) of upgraded cases compared with 11 % (7/66) of controls (P = 0.03). Cancers with PTEN deletions were more likely to be upgraded than those without deletions (adjusting for age odds ratio = 3.40, 95 % confidence interval 1.14-10.11). With respect to concordance, of 93 biopsies with PTEN protein detected by IHC, 89 (96 %) had no PTEN deletion by FISH, and of 18 biopsies without PTEN protein by IHC, 15 had homozygous or hemizygous PTEN deletion by FISH. Only 4 biopsies of the 93 (4 %) with PTEN protein intact had PTEN deletion by FISH. When the regions of uncertainty in these biopsies were systematically studied by FISH, intra-tumoral variation of PTEN deletion was found, which could account for variation in immunoreactivity. Thus, FISH provides a different approach to determining PTEN loss when IHC is uncertain. Both FISH and IHC are concordant, showing consistent positive associations between PTEN loss and upgrading. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"One of the foremost problems in the prostate cancer (PCa) field is the inability to distinguish aggressive from indolent disease, which leads to difficult prognoses and thousands of unnecessary surgeries. This limitation stems from the fact that the mechanisms of tumorigenesis in the prostate are poorly understood. Some genetic alterations are commonly reported in prostate tumors, including upregulation of Myc, fusion of Ets genes to androgen-regulated promoters, and loss of Pten. However, the specific roles of these aberrations in tumor initiation and progression are poorly understood. Likewise, the cell of origin for PCa remains controversial and may be linked to the aggressive potential of the tumor. One important clue is that prostate tumors co-express basal and luminal protein markers that are restricted to their distinct cell types in normal tissue. Prostate epithelium contains layer-specific stem cells as well as rare bipotent cells, which can differentiate into basal or luminal cells. We hypothesize that the primary oncogenic cell of origin is a transient-differentiating bipotent cell. Such a cell must maintain tight temporal and spatial control of differentiation pathways, thus increasing its susceptibility for oncogenic disruption. In support of this hypothesis, many of the pathways known to be involved in prostate differentiation can be linked to genes commonly altered in PCa. In this article, we review what is known about important differentiation pathways (Myc, p38MAPK, Notch, PI3K/Pten) in the prostate and how their misregulation could lead to oncogenesis. Better understanding of normal differentiation will offer new insights into tumor initiation and may help explain the functional significance of common genetic alterations seen in PCa. Additionally, this understanding could lead to new methods for classifying prostate tumors based on their differentiation status and may aid in identifying more aggressive tumors. ",

Here, we describe the improvement of the conditional Pten deletion model of prostate adenocarcinoma by combining it with either a conditional luciferase or enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter line. In these models, the recombination mechanism that inactivates the Pten alleles also activates the reporter gene. In the luciferase reporter model, the growth of the primary cancer can be followed noninvasively by bioluminescence imaging (BLI). Surgical castration of tumor-bearing animals leads to a reduced bioluminescence signal corresponding to tumor regression that is verified at necropsy. When castrated animals are maintained, the emergence of androgen depletion-independent cancer is detected using BLI at times varying from 7 to 28 weeks postcastration. The ability to monitor growth, regression, or relapse of the tumor with the use of BLI lead to the collection of tumors at different stages of development. By comparing the distribution of phenotypically distinct populations of epithelial cells in cancer tissues, we noted that the degree of hyperplasia of cells with neuroendocrine differentiation significantly increases in the recurrent cancer relative to the primary cancer, a characteristic which may parallel the appearance of a neuroendocrine phenotype in human androgen depletion-independent cancer. The enhanced green fluorescent protein model, at necropsy, can provide an opportunity to locate or assess tumor volume or to isolate enriched populations of cancer cells from tumor tissues via fluorescence-based technologies. These refined models should be useful in the elucidation of mechanisms of prostate cancer progression, and for the development of approaches to preclinical intervention.",

In this study, we use a novel mesenchyme-free embryonic prostate culture system, newly available mTOR inhibitors and a conditional PTEN loss-of-function model to investigate the role of the interconnected PI3K and mTOR signaling pathways in prostatic organogenesis. We demonstrate that PI3K levels and PI3K/mTOR activity are robustly induced by androgen during murine prostatic development and that PI3K/mTOR signaling is necessary for prostatic epithelial bud invasion of surrounding mesenchyme. To elucidate the cellular mechanism by which PI3K/mTOR signaling regulates prostatic branching, we show that PI3K/mTOR inhibition does not significantly alter epithelial proliferation or apoptosis, but rather decreases the efficiency and speed with which the developing prostatic epithelial cells migrate. Using mTOR kinase inhibitors to tease out the independent effects of mTOR signaling downstream of PI3K, we find that simultaneous inhibition of mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity attenuates prostatic branching and is sufficient to phenocopy combined PI3K/mTOR inhibition. Surprisingly, however, mTORC1 inhibition alone has the reverse effect, increasing the number and length of prostatic branches. Finally, simultaneous activation of PI3K and downstream mTORC1/C2 via epithelial PTEN loss-of-function also results in decreased budding reversible by mTORC1 inhibition, suggesting that the effect of mTORC1 on branching is not primarily mediated by negative feedback on PI3K/mTORC2 signaling. Taken together, our data point to an important role for PI3K/mTOR signaling in prostatic epithelial invasion and migration and implicates the balance of PI3K and downstream mTORC1/C2 activity as a critical regulator of prostatic epithelial morphogenesis.",

Early studies demonstrate that only stem-like basal cells in the normal human prostate (NHP) can function as the cell of origin for prostate cancer (PCa). Here, we show that the organoids derived from bulk NHP luminal cells can also be tumorigenically transformed. We further show that the WIT medium, which is used to culture human mammary epithelial progenitor cells, when combined with the ROCK inhibitor, can readily propagate a population of progenitor-like cells from the primary NHP luminal cell isolates. Such functionally defined luminal progenitors can be transformed by distinct sets of genetic perturbations (i.e., AR+AKT/ERG or c-MYC+PTEN knockout) to form tumor glands. Genome-wide RNA-Seq analysis of freshly purified unperturbed human benign prostatic basal and luminal cells and culture-expanded lineage-specific stem/progenitor populations reveals that the luminal progenitors possess a distinct gene expression profile that is greatly enriched in advanced, castration-resistant, and metastatic PCa, and it associates with poor patient survival. The ability of the simple two-dimensional culture system reported herein to greatly enrich NHP progenitor-like cells should facilitate biological and biochemical studies as well as high-throughput screening in these cells and in progenitor-like PCa cells.;The development of a novel two-dimensional cell culture system demonstrated that the luminal progenitor cells in adult human prostate can serve as a cell of origin for prostate cancer.",

Oncogene-induced senescence is thought to be invariably preceded by hyperproliferation, aberrant replication, and activation of a DNA damage checkpoint response (DDR), rendering therapeutic enhancement of this process unsuitable for cancer treatment. We previously demonstrated in a mouse model of prostate cancer that inactivation of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (Pten) elicits a senescence response that opposes tumorigenesis. Here, we show that Pten-loss-induced cellular senescence (PICS) represents a senescence response that is distinct from oncogene-induced senescence and can be targeted for cancer therapy. Using mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we determined that PICS occurs rapidly after Pten inactivation, in the absence of cellular proliferation and DDR. Further, we found that PICS is associated with enhanced p53 translation. Consistent with these data, we showed that in mice p53-stabilizing drugs potentiated PICS and its tumor suppressive potential. Importantly, we demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of PTEN drives senescence and inhibits tumorigenesis in vivo in a human xenograft model of prostate cancer. Taken together, our data identify a type of cellular senescence that can be triggered in nonproliferating cells in the absence of DNA damage, which we believe will be useful for developing a \"pro-senescence\" approach for cancer prevention and therapy.",

It has been observed that the expression levels of AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3 vary, but the levels of phospho-Ser473 AKT and phospho-Thr308 AKT are quite unique in these cancer cell lines, and that CL-1 cells have the highest basal levels of AKT activation among these cell lines.

In a recent screen for mediators of resistance to IGF-1R inhibitor AZ12253801, we identified RAD51, required for the strand invasion step of HR. These findings prompted us to test the hypothesis that IGF-1R-inhibited cells accumulate DSBs formed at endogenous DNA lesions, and depend on residual HR for their repair. Indeed, initial experiments showed time-dependent accumulation of γH2AX foci in IGF-1R -inhibited or -depleted prostate cancer cells. We then tested effects of suppressing HR, and found that RAD51 depletion enhanced AZ12253801 sensitivity in PTEN wild-type prostate cancer cells but not in cells lacking functional PTEN. Similar sensitization was induced in prostate cancer cells by depletion of BRCA2, required for RAD51 loading onto DNA, and in BRCA2(-/-) colorectal cancer cells, compared with isogenic BRCA2(+/-) cells. We also assessed chemical HR inhibitors, finding that RAD51 inhibitor BO2 blocked RAD51 focus formation and sensitized to AZ12253801. Finally, we tested CDK1 inhibitor RO-3306, which impairs HR by inhibiting CDK1-mediated BRCA1 phosphorylation. R0-3306 suppressed RAD51 focus formation consistent with HR attenuation, and sensitized prostate cancer cells to IGF-1R inhibition, with 2.4-fold reduction in AZ12253801 GI50 and 13-fold reduction in GI80. These data suggest that responses to IGF-1R inhibition are enhanced by genetic and chemical approaches to suppress HR, defining a population of cancers (PTEN wild-type, BRCA mutant) that may be intrinsically sensitive to IGF-1R inhibitory drugs.",

PTEN localizes predominantly to the cytoplasm and functions as a lipid phosphatase, thereby negatively regulating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT signaling pathway. PTEN can also localize to the nucleus, where it binds and regulates p53 protein level and transcription activity. However, the precise function of nuclear PTEN and the factors that control PTEN nuclear localization are still largely unknown. In this study, we identified oxidative stress as one of the physiological stimuli that regulate the accumulation of nuclear PTEN. Specifically, oxidative stress inhibits PTEN nuclear export, a process depending on phosphorylation of its amino acid residue Ser-380. Nuclear PTEN, independent of its phosphatase activity, leads to p53-mediated G(1) growth arrest, cell death, and reduction of reactive oxygen species production. Using xenografts propagated from human prostate cancer cell lines, we reveal that nuclear PTEN is sufficient to reduce tumor progression in vivo in a p53-dependent manner. The data outlined in this study suggest a unique role of nuclear PTEN to arrest and protect cells upon oxidative damage and to regulate tumorigenesis. Since tumor cells are constantly exposed to oxidative stress, our study elucidates the cooperative roles of nuclear PTEN with p53 in tumor suppression.",

To gain mechanistic insights into ANXA7 tumor suppression, we undertook an in vitro study in which we compared wild-type (WT)-ANXA7 and dominant-negative (DN)-ANXA7 effects to a conventional tumor suppressor p53 in prostate cancer cells with different androgen sensitivity. Unlike p53 (which caused cell growth arrest and apoptosis to a noticeable extent in benign PrEC), WT-ANXA7 demonstrated profound cytotoxicityin androgen-sensitive LNCaP as well as in the androgen-resistant DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells, but not in PrEC. In androgen-sensitive LNCaP, WT-ANXA7 decreased low-molecular-weight (LMW) AR protein forms and maintained higher retinoblastoma 1 (RB1)/phospho-RB1 ratio. In contrast, DN-ANXA7 (which lacks phosphatidylserine liposome aggregation properties) increased LMW-AR forms and hyperphosphorylated RB1 that was consistent with the lack of DN-ANXA7 cytotoxicity. According to the microarray-based Ingenuity Pathways Analysis, a major WT-ANXA7 effect in androgen-sensitive LNCaP constituted of upregulation of the RB1-binding transcription factor E2F1 along with its downstream proapoptotic targets such as ASK1 and ASPP2. These results suggested a reversal of the RBdependent repression of the proapoptotic E2F-mediated transcription. However, DN-ANXA7 increased RB1/2 (but not E2F1) expression and induced the proliferation-promoting ERK5, thereby maintaining the RB-dependent repression of E2F-mediated apoptosis in LNcaP. On the other hand, in androgen-resistant cells, WT-ANXA7 tumor suppressor effects involved PTEN and NFkB pathways. Thus, ANXA7 revived the RB-associated cell survival control and overcame androgen resistance and dysfunctional status of major tumor suppressors commonly mutated in prostate cancer.

Here, we show that ETS family members, such as ERG and ETV1, directly repress the expression of the checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), a key DNA damage response cell-cycle regulator essential for the maintenance of genome integrity. Critically, we find that ERG expression correlates with CHK1 downregulation in human patients and demonstrate that Chk1 heterozygosity promotes the progression of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia into prostatic invasive carcinoma in Pten(+) (/-) mice. Importantly, CHK1 downregulation sensitizes prostate tumor cells to etoposide but not to docetaxel treatment. Thus, we identify CHK1 as a key functional target of the ETS proto-oncogenic family with important therapeutic implications.;Genetic translocation and aberrant expression of ETS family members is a common event in different types of human tumors.

Although some consequences of eIF2alpha phosphorylation are cytoprotective, phosphorylation of eIF2alpha by RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) is largely proapoptotic and tumor suppressing. Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10 (PTEN) is a tumor suppressor protein that is mutated or deleted in various human cancers, with functions that are mediated through phosphatase-dependent and -independent pathways. Here, we demonstrate that the eIF2alpha phosphorylation pathway is downstream of PTEN. Inactivation of PTEN in human melanoma cells reduced eIF2alpha phosphorylation, whereas reconstitution of PTEN-null human glioblastoma or prostate cancer cells with either wild-type PTEN or phosphatase-defective mutants of PTEN induced PKR activity and eIF2alpha phosphorylation. The antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of PTEN were compromised in mouse embryonic fibroblasts that lacked PKR or contained a phosphorylation-defective variant of eIF2alpha. Induction of the pathway leading to phosphorylation of eIF2alpha required an intact PDZ-binding motif in PTEN.

This novel hyperthermia modality has shown better potentiation of chemotherapeutics over other types of hyperthermia. We hypothesized that inducing hyperthermia via magnetic nanoparticles (MFH) would enhance the cytotoxicity of BZ in BZ-sensitive and BZ-resistant cancer cells more effectively than hyperthermia using a hot water bath (HWH). Studies were conducted using BZ in combination with MFH in two BZ-sensitive cell lines (MDA-MB-468, Caco-2), and one BZ-resistant cell line (A2780) at two different conditions, ie, 43°C for 30 minutes and 45°C for 30 minutes. These experiments were compared with combined application of HWH and BZ. The results indicate enhanced potentiation between hyperthermic treatment and BZ.

Using ChIP assays, two regions of the survivin promoter, -1953 to -1812 (I) and -1485 to -1119 (II) encompassing consensus Runx-binding sites were examined. Runx2 was found to be associated with both regions, with a stronger affinity to region-I.

In reporter assays, transcription activity by BMP7 was significantly reduced when sequences including binding sites of region-II were deleted. Additionally, Runx2 expression was enhanced by BMP7 in these cells. Along with a strong survivin expression, a trend in increased Runx2 expression in human prostate cancer cells and tissues was noted.

The paucity of biomarkers to predict prostate tumor biology makes it important to identify key pathways that confer poor prognosis and guide potential targeted therapy. Using a murine forward mutagenesis screen in a Pten-null background, we identified peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (Pparg), encoding a ligand-activated transcription factor, as a promoter of metastatic CaP through activation of lipid signaling pathways, including up-regulation of lipid synthesis enzymes [fatty acid synthase (FASN), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), ATP citrate lyase (ACLY)]. Importantly, inhibition of PPARG suppressed tumor growth in vivo, with down-regulation of the lipid synthesis program. We show that elevated levels of PPARG strongly correlate with elevation of FASN in human CaP and that high levels of PPARG/FASN and PI3K/pAKT pathway activation confer a poor prognosis. These data suggest that CaP patients could be stratified in terms of PPARG/FASN and PTEN levels to identify patients with aggressive CaP who may respond favorably to PPARG/FASN inhibition. ",

PTEN mRNA expression by ISH was consistently more sensitive than PTEN IHC, with 56% of samples on a mixed-tumor tissue microarray (TMA) showing high expression by ISH compared with 42% by IHC. On a prostate TMA, 49% of cases showed high expression by ISH compared with 43% by IHC. Variations in PTEN mRNA expression within malignant epithelium were quantifiable using image analysis on the prostate TMAs. Within tumors, clear overexpression of PTEN mRNA on malignant epithelium compared with benign epithelium was frequently observed and quantified. The use of SpotStudio software in the mixed-tumor TMA allowed for clear demonstration of varying levels of PTEN mRNA between tumor samples by the mRNA methodology. This was evident by the quantifiable differences between distinct oropharyngeal tumors (up to 3-fold increase in average number of spots per cell between 2 cases). mRNA detection of PTEN or other biomarkers, for which optimal or standardized immunohistochemical techniques are not available, represents a means by which heterogeneity of expression within focal regions of tumor can be explored with more confidence.

Representational difference analysis (RDA) uses selective hybridization and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to isolate regions of chromosomal loss and has facilitated the identification of tumor suppressor genes, such as BRCA2 and PTEN. We have recently identified a 1-5-cM homozygous deletion on 12p12-13 in a prostate cancer xenograft and found that 47% of patients who died of prostate carcinoma demonstrate focal loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in this region in metastatic deposits. We have now characterized the region of interest by assembling a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) contig spanning the homozygous deletion and identifying which known genes and expressed sequence tags (EST) lie within the homozygous deletion. A rib metastasis was harvested at autopsy and placed subcutaneously in a male SCID mouse. Genomic DNA from this xenograft and from the patient's normal renal tissue was extracted. Multiplex PCR, with the xenograft and normal DNA used as template, was performed using primers for loci on the Whitehead contig 12.1 believed to be near our region of interest. We found that our deletion lay in a 1-2-Mb interval between WI-664 and D12S358. We then used the same primers to construct a YAC contig across the homozygous deletion. PCR amplification of YAC DNA, using primers for the genomic sequences of known genes and ESTs reported to lie on 12p12-13, was used to identify candidate genes that lay within the deletion. Duplex PCR, with control primers known not to be deleted in the xenograft, was used to confirm that both the CDKN1B and ETV6 genes were homozygously deleted in the xenograft.

Therefore, we established the validity of a quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for the human telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT) mRNA and telomerase associated protein (TEP1) mRNA using the TaqMan fluorogenic detection system.

Our results indicated that the levels of hTERT mRNA and TEP1 mRNA expression in AsPC-1 were 1.50 and 2.31 times higher than in PANC-1 cells. This TaqMan RT-PCR assay appears to be useful in determining the quantities of hTERT and TEP1 mRNAs in clinical specimens.

We previously demonstrated that approximately 1 out of 40 Lin(-)Sca-1(+)CD49f(high) (LSC) prostate basal epithelial cells possess the capacities of stem cells for self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation. We show here that treating LSC cells with the ROCK kinase inhibitor Y-27632 increases their cloning efficiency by 8 fold in an in vitro prostate colony assay. Y-27632 treatment allows prostate colony cells to replate efficiently, which does not occur otherwise. Y-27632 also increases the cloning efficiency of prostate stem cells in a prostate sphere assay and a dissociated prostate cell regeneration assay. The increased cloning efficiency is due to the suppression of the dissociation-induced, RhoA/ROCK activation-mediated apoptosis of prostate stem cells. Dissociation of prostate epithelial cells from extracellular matrix increases PTEN activity and attenuates AKT activity. Y-27632 treatment alone is sufficient to suppress cell dissociation-induced activation of PTEN activity. However, this does not contribute to the increased cloning efficiency, because Y-27632 treatment increases the sphere-forming unit of wild type and Pten null prostate cells to a similar extent. Finally, knocking down expression of both ROCK kinases slightly increases the replating efficiency of prostate colony cells, corroborating that they play a major role in the Y-27632 mediated increase in cloning efficiency. Our study implies that the numbers of prostate cells with stem/progenitor activity may be underestimated based on currently employed assays, supports that dissociation-induced apoptosis is a common feature of embryonic and somatic stem cells with an epithelial phenotype, and highlights the significance of environmental cues for the maintenance of stem cells.",

        "Doc_abstract":"A search for novel and biologically relevant androgen-regulated genes and processes in the human prostate led to the intriguing observation that androgens provoke a remarkable and coordinated increase in the expression of several genes involved in triglyceride and cholesterol synthesis in various prostatic adenocarcinoma cell lines. This coordinated activation was shown to be the result of a novel and indirect pathway in which androgens cause activation of a secondary transcription regulator, Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein (SREBP), a pivotal factor in the control of intracellular lipid homeostasis. The biological relevance of increased lipogenesis in the biology of prostate cancer is underlined by recent immunocytochemical investigations on needle biopsies showing an increase in the expression of Fatty Acid Synthase (FAS) in 94% of the tumor-lesions examined. This increase is already evident in the earliest recognizable lesions (Prostatic Intra-epithelial Neoplasia; PIN) and is more pronounced in tumors with a higher Gleason score, suggesting that increased FAS expression may serve both as an early tumor marker and as a marker of tumor progression. As in tumor cell-lines, increased FAS expression in prostate tumors seems to be only part of a more general and coordinated activation of lipogenic pathways. Further studies revealed that lipogenesis in prostate tumor cells can be enhanced not only by androgens but also by growth factors and by tumor-associated disturbances in signal transduction pathways. EGF, for instance, is also able to activate lipogenesis via the SREBP pathway and activation of the P13 kinase system by inactivation of PTEN (a phenomenon observed in some 50% of the prostate cancers) also causes increased lipogenesis. The early and nearly universal activation of lipogenesis in prostate cancers (and also in various other tumors) suggests that this may be a fundamental event in the development of the tumoral phenotype, an element that certainly merits further investigation. In addition, there are serious indications that interference with enhanced lipogenic activity in tumor cells may cause tumor cell death and delayed tumor development, suggesting that increased lipogenic activity in tumor cells may open a novel avenue for therapeutic intervention.",

Individuals were categorized for diagnostic criteria for Cowden syndrome (CS) using the 2009 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines and underwent germline PTEN mutation analysis.;Two of the 259 patients (0.8%), with both follicular thyroid carcinoma and macrocephaly, were found to carry a germline mutation in the PTEN gene. The PTEN mutation frequency in unselected cases of follicular thyroid carcinoma was 4.8%.;The frequency of germline pathogenic PTEN mutations in an unselected series of patients with DTC is relatively low, but it is enriched by considering follicular histology and macrocephaly. These results suggest that by adding head circumference to the clinical assessment, thyroid cancer specialists can more effectively identify patients needing referral for cancer genetic services.",

However, the cancer growth inhibitory/cytocidal effects and molecular mechanisms in prostate cancer cells have not been well studied. In the present study, we demonstrate that Tan IIA significantly decreased the viable cell number of LNCaP (phosphate and tensin homolog (PTEN) mutant, high AKT, wild type p53) prostate cancer cells more sensitively than against the PC-3 (PTEN null, high AKT, p53 null) prostate cancer cells. Tan IIA significantly increased TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) positive index and sub-G1 DNA contents of treated cells, consistent with apoptosis. Tan IIA treatment led to cleavage activation of pro-caspases-9 and 3, but not pro-caspase-8, and cleavage of poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP), a caspase-3 substrate. Additionally, Tan IIA treatment induced cytochrome c release from the mitochondria into the cytosol and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and suppressed the expression of mitochondria protective Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1(L). Tan IIA reduced the expression of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) p85 subunit, and the phosphorylation of AKT and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, the combination of Tan IIA and LY294002, a specific PI3K inhibitor, enhanced PARP cleavage of LNCaP and PC-3, but not in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells which do not contain detectable active AKT. The findings suggest that Tan IIA-induced apoptosis involves mitochondria intrinsic caspase activation cascade and an inhibition of the PI3K/AKT survival pathway.",

We studied the association of regulated PTEN expression with changes in biological function and gene expression profiles.;PTEN-negative LNCaP cells were stably transfected with wild-type PTEN cDNA under inducible control, resulting in LNCaP/PTEN cells. Microarray analysis was used to monitor gene expression changes upon induction of PTEN. Expression of selected individual genes was studied in Q-PCR and siRNA experiments. Cell-cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry.;Induced expression of PTEN in LNCaP/PTEN cells significantly inhibited cell proliferation, at least partly due to cell-cycle arrest at the G1 phase. Expression profiling combined with pathway analysis revealed that PTEN-dependent G1 growth arrest was associated with an altered mRNA expression of the G1 cell-cycle regulators Cdc25a, E2F2, cyclin G2, and RBL2/p130. Specific inhibition of Akt signaling by siRNA resulted in downregulation of both E2F2 and Cdc25a mRNA expression and upregulation of the FOXO target cyclin G2, similar to the effect observed by PTEN induction. However, Akt did not mediate the PTEN-dependent RBL2/p130 mRNA expression in LNCaP/PTEN cells.;The results indicate that PTEN dependent gene expression is important in cell-cycle regulation and is mediated by both Akt-dependent and -independent mechanisms.",

In addition to its well-described role in cell signaling, PTEN is involved in the maintenance of genomic stability. Loss of PTEN function causes defects in repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination and, therefore, sensitizes cells to inhibition of the poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase (PARP). Here, we determined the PTEN status of eight endometrioid endometrial carcinoma cell lines and correlated it with in vitro sensitivity to the PARP inhibitor KU0058948. PTEN-deficient cells showed a significantly greater sensitivity to KU0058948 than the two endometrioid endometrial carcinoma cell lines with wild-type PTEN. The cell lines lacking PTEN expression were unable to elicit a homologous recombination damage response as assayed by RAD51 focus function (a marker of competent homologous recombination DNA repair) upon irradiation and treatment with PARP inhibitors. PTEN silencing in PTEN wild-type Hec-1b cells resulted in reduced RAD51 foci formation after DNA damage and increased sensitivity to PARP inhibition. PTEN reexpression in PTEN-null cell lines resulted in enhanced RAD51 foci formation and in relative resistance to KU0058948. Given that up to 80% of endometrioid endometrial cancers lack PTEN expression, our results suggest that PARP inhibitors may be therapeutically useful for a subset of endometrioid endometrial cancers.",

In 53 informative muscle invasive tumours (> or = pT2), allele loss was detected in 13 (24.5%) and allelic imbalance in four tumours (overall frequency 32%).

Two homozygous deletions were identified but no mutations. Of 15 bladder tumour cell lines analysed, three showed homozygous deletion of all or part of the PTEN gene, but none had mutations detectable by SSCP analysis. Our results indicate that PTEN is involved in the development of some bladder tumours. The low frequency of mutation of the retained allele in tumours with 10q23 LOH suggests that there may be another predominant mechanism of inactivation of the second allele, for example small intragenic deletions, that hemizygosity may be sufficient for phenotypic effect, or that there is another target gene at 10q23.",

However, less than 50% of estrogen receptor positive breast cancers do not respond to tamoxifen treatment whereas 40% of tumors that initially respond to treatment develop resistance over time. The underlying mechanisms for tamoxifen resistance are probably multifactorial but remain largely unknown. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the impact of PTEN tumor suppressor gene on acquiring resistance to tamoxifen by analyzing loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and immunohystochemical expression of PTEN in 49 primary breast carcinomas of patients treated with tamoxifen as the only adjuvant therapy. The effect of PTEN inactivation on breast cancer progression and disease outcome was also analyzed. Reduced or completely lost PTEN expression was observed in 55.1% of samples, while 63.3% of samples displayed LOH of PTEN gene. Inactivation of PTEN immunoexpression significantly correlated with the PTEN loss of heterozygosity, suggesting LOH as the most important genetic mechanism for the reduction or complete loss of PTEN expression in primary breast carcinoma. Most importantly, LOH of PTEN and consequential reduction of its immunoexpression showed significant correlation with the recurrence of the disease. Besides, our study revealed that LOH of PTEN tumor suppressor was significantly associated with shorter disease free survival, breast cancer specific survival and overall survival. In summary, our results imply that LOH of PTEN could be used as a good prognostic characteristic for the outcome of breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen.",

Loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10) can hyperactivate mTOR through AKT and represents one of the most frequent events in human prostate cancer. We show here that conditional inactivation of mTor in the adult mouse prostate is seemingly inconsequential for this postmitotic tissue. Conversely, inactivation of mTor leads to a marked suppression of Pten loss-induced tumor initiation and progression in the prostate. This suppression is more pronounced than that elicited by the sole pharmacological abrogation of mTORC1. Acute inactivation of mTor in vitro also highlights the differential requirement of mTor function in proliferating and transformed cells. Collectively, our data constitute a strong rationale for developing specific mTOR inhibitors targeting both mTORC1 and mTORC2 for the treatment of tumors triggered by PTEN deficiency and aberrant mTOR signaling.",

In the treatment group, SIL (50 mg/kg, per orally (p.o.)) was administered daily to rats concomitantly with testosterone. Rats were killed 72 h after the last testosterone injection. Then, prostate tissues were dissected out, weighed, and subjected to histological, immunohistochemical, and biochemical examinations. Rats treated with testosterone showed marked increase in prostate weight and prostate weight/body weight with histopathological picture of inflammation and hyperplasia as well as increased collagen deposition. Co-treatment with SIL significantly alleviated these pathological changes. Further, SIL attenuated testosterone-induced nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), cyclooxygenase-II (COX-II), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) upregulation, and blunted testosterone-mediated increase in nitric oxide level and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8. Testosterone-induced downregulation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) were alleviated by SIL. Our findings highlight the anti-inflammatory properties of SIL as a crucial mechanism of its preventive actions against experimental BPH. This can be attributed to, at least partly, attenuating the expression of NF-kB and the subsequent inflammatory cascade, ameliorating the expression of PTEN, and mitigating that of HIF-1α.

Herein, we investigated and independently validated CRISP3 expression in relation to ERG and PTEN genomic aberrations and clinical outcome. CRISP3 protein expression was examined by immunohistochemistry using a cohort of patients with localized PCA (n = 215) and castration resistant PCA (CRPC) (n = 46). The Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSKCC) and Swedish cohorts were used for prognostic validation. Results showed, CRISP3 protein intensity to be significantly associated with neoplastic epithelium, being highest in CRPC vs. benign prostate tissue (p < 0.0001), but was not related to Gleason score (GS). CRISP3 mRNA was significantly associated with higher GS (p = 0.022 in MSKCC, p = 1.1e-4 in Swedish). Significant association between CRISP3 expression and clinical outcome was documented at the mRNA but not the protein expression levels. CRISP3 mRNA expression was related to biochemical recurrence in the MSKCC (p = 0.038) and lethal disease in the Swedish cohort (p = 0.0086) and retained its prognostic value in the subgroup of patients with GS 6 & 7. Furthermore, CRISP3 protein and mRNA expression was significantly associated with positive ERG status and with PTEN deletions. Functional biology analysis documented phenylalanine metabolism as the most significant pathway governing high CRISP3 and ERG expression in this subtype of PCA. In conclusion, the combined status of CRISP3, ERG and PTEN define a molecular subtype of PCA with poorest and lethal outcome. Assessing their combined value may be of added value in stratifying patients into different prognostic groups and identify those with poorest clinical outcome. ",

As yet, there are no validated descriptions of prostate cancer subgroups derived from integrated genomics linked with clinical outcome.;In a study of 482 tumour, benign and germline samples from 259 men with primary prostate cancer, we used integrative analysis of copy number alterations (CNA) and array transcriptomics to identify genomic loci that affect expression levels of mRNA in an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) approach, to stratify patients into subgroups that we then associated with future clinical behaviour, and compared with either CNA or transcriptomics alone.;We identified five separate patient subgroups with distinct genomic alterations and expression profiles based on 100 discriminating genes in our separate discovery and validation sets of 125 and 103 men. These subgroups were able to consistently predict biochemical relapse (p = 0.0017 and p = 0.016 respectively) and were further validated in a third cohort with long-term follow-up (p = 0.027). We show the relative contributions of gene expression and copy number data on phenotype, and demonstrate the improved power gained from integrative analyses. We confirm alterations in six genes previously associated with prostate cancer (MAP3K7, MELK, RCBTB2, ELAC2, TPD52, ZBTB4), and also identify 94 genes not previously linked to prostate cancer progression that would not have been detected using either transcript or copy number data alone. We confirm a number of previously published molecular changes associated with high risk disease, including MYC amplification, and NKX3-1, RB1 and PTEN deletions, as well as over-expression of PCA3 and AMACR, and loss of MSMB in tumour tissue. A subset of the 100 genes outperforms established clinical predictors of poor prognosis (PSA, Gleason score), as well as previously published gene signatures (p = 0.0001). We further show how our molecular profiles can be used for the early detection of aggressive cases in a clinical setting, and inform treatment decisions.;For the first time in prostate cancer this study demonstrates the importance of integrated genomic analyses incorporating both benign and tumour tissue data in identifying molecular alterations leading to the generation of robust gene sets that are predictive of clinical outcome in independent patient cohorts.",

Recent studies have suggested a potential synergy between vaccination and androgen ablation, yet the enhanced T-cell function is transient. Using a defined tumor antigen model, UV-8101-RE, we found that concomitant castration significantly increased the frequency and function of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells early after the immunization of wild-type mice. However, at a late time point after immunization, effector function was reduced to the same level as noncastrated mice and was accompanied by a concomitant amplification in CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Treg) following immunization. We investigated whether Treg expansion occurred following castration of prostate tumor-bearing mice. In the prostate-specific Pten(-/-) mouse model of prostate cancer, we observed an accelerated Treg expansion in mice bearing the castration-resistant endogenous prostate tumor, which prevented effector responses to UV-8101-RE. Treg depletion together with castration elicited a strong CD8(+) T-cell response to UV-8101-RE in Pten(-/-) mice and rescued effector function in castrated and immunized wild-type mice. In addition, Treg expansion in Pten(-/-) mice was prevented by in vivo interleukin (IL)-2 blockade suggesting that increased IL-2 generated by castration and immunization promotes Treg expansion. Our findings therefore suggest that although effector responses are augmented by castration, the concomitant expansion of Tregs is one mechanism responsible for only transient immune potentiation after androgen ablation.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Tumor necrosis factor superfamily member TRAIL/Apo-2L has recently been shown to induce apoptosis in transformed and cancer cells. Some prostate cancer cells express constitutively active Akt/protein kinase B due to a complete loss of lipid phosphatase PTEN gene, a negative regulator of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. Constitutively active Akt promotes cellular survival and resistance to chemotherapy and radiation. We have recently noticed that some human prostate cancer cells are resistant to TRAIL. We therefore examined the intracellular mechanisms of cellular resistance to TRAIL. The cell lines expressing the highest level of constitutively active Akt were more resistant to undergo apoptosis by TRAIL than those expressing the lowest level. Down-regulation of constitutively active Akt by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, reversed cellular resistance to TRAIL. Treatment of resistant cells with cycloheximide (a protein synthesis inhibitor) rendered cells sensitive to TRAIL. Transfecting dominant negative Akt decreased Akt activity and increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis in cells with high Akt activity. Conversely, transfecting constitutively active Akt into cells with low Akt activity increased Akt activity and attenuated TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of TRAIL sensitivity occurs at the level of BID cleavage, as caspase-8 activity was not affected. Enforced expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 or Bcl-X(L) inhibited TRAIL-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. We therefore identify Akt as a constitutively active kinase that promotes survival of prostate cancer cells and demonstrate that modulation of Akt activity, by pharmacological or genetic approaches, alters the cellular responsiveness to TRAIL. Thus, TRAIL in combination with agents that down-regulate Akt activity can be used to treat prostate cancer.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), a phosphoinositide-3-OH-kinase-activated protein kinase, is highly expressed in prostate tumors. p-Akt can indirectly hinder p53-dependent growth suppression and apoptosis by phosphorylating Mdm2. Alternatively, p-Akt can directly phosphorylate p21 and restrict it to the cytoplasm for degradation. Because the prostate is the highest zinc-accumulating tissue before the onset of cancer, the effects of physiological levels of zinc on Akt-Mdm2-p53 and Akt-p21 signaling axes in human normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) and malignant prostate LNCaP cells were examined in the present study. Cells were cultured for 6 days in low-zinc growth medium supplemented with 0 [zinc-deficient (ZD)], 4 [zinc-normal (ZN)], 16 [zinc-adequate (ZA)], or 32 [zinc-supplemented (ZS)] microM zinc. Zinc status of both cell types was altered in a dose-dependent manner, with LNCaP cells reaching a plateau at >16 microM zinc. For both cell types, p-Akt was higher in the ZD than in the ZN cells and was normalized to that of the ZN cells by treatment with a PI3K inhibitor, LY-294002. PTEN, an endogenous phosphatase targeting Akt dephosphorylation, was hyperphosphorylated (p-PTEN, inactive form) in ZD PrEC. Nuclear p-Mdm2 was raised, whereas nuclear p53 was depressed, by zinc deficiency in PrEC. Nuclear p21 and p53 were lowered by zinc deficiency in LNCaP cells. Higher percentages of ZD, ZA, and ZS than ZN LNCaP cells were found at the G(0)/G(1) phase of the cell cycle, with proportionally lower precentages at the S and G(2)/M phases. Hence, the increased p-PTEN in ZD PrEC would result in hyperphosphorylation of p-Akt and p-Mdm2, as well as reduction of nuclear p53 accumulation. For ZD LNCaP cells, Akt hyperphosphorylation was probably mediated through p21 phosphorylation and degradation, thus restricting p21 nuclear entry to induce cell cycle arrest. Thus zinc deficiency differentially modulated the Akt-Mdm2-p53 signaling axis in normal prostate cells vs. the Akt-p21 signaling axis in malignant prostate cells.",

While individuals with CD have an increased risk of breast and thyroid neoplasms, the primary features of CD are hamartomas. The gene for CD has been mapped by linkage analysis to a 6 cM region on the long arm of chromosome 10 at 10q22-23. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) studies of sporadic follicular thyroid adenomas and carcinomas, both component tumors of CD, have suggested that the putative susceptibility gene for CD is a tumor suppressor gene. Somatic missense and nonsense mutations have recently been identified in breast, prostate, and brain tumor cell lines in a gene encoding a dual specificity phosphatase, PTEN/MMACI, mapped at 10q23.3. Furthermore, germline PTEN/MMACI mutations are associated with CD. In the present study, 20 hamartomas from 11 individuals belonging to ten unrelated families with CD have been examined for LOH of markers flanking and within PTEN/MMACI. Eight of these ten families have germline PTEN/MMACI mutations. LOH involving microsatellite markers within the CD interval, and including PTEN/MMACI, was identified in two fibroadenomas of the breast, a thyroid adenoma, and a pulmonary hamartoma belonging to 3 to 11 (27%) of these patients. The wild-type allele was lost in these hamartomas. Semi-quantitative PCR performed on RNA from hamartomas from three different tissues from a CD patient suggested substantial reduction of PTEN/MMACI RNA levels in all of these tissues.

A key effector of Akt-induced signaling is the regulatory protein mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). We show here that mTOR downstream from Akt controls NF-kappaB activity in PTEN-null/inactive prostate cancer cells via interaction with and stimulation of IKK. The mTOR-associated protein Raptor is required for the ability of Akt to induce NF-kappaB activity. Correspondingly, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin is shown to suppress IKK activity in PTEN-deficient prostate cancer cells through a mechanism that may involve dissociation of Raptor from mTOR.

Loss of PTEN expression and Akt activation were further correlated with different clinical parameters and found to be significantly correlated with tumor stage. Apoptotic index was estimated and correlated with PTEN expression and Akt activation. The percentage of apoptotic cells varied from 0.2 to 14.1%. Low apoptotic index was observed in 105 (72%) of samples, and it was found to be significantly related with loss of PTEN expression and phospho-Akt;The present study confirms the contribution of loss of PTEN expression in Akt phosphorylation and spontaneous apoptosis suppression in the specimens of oral cancer.

Loss of PTEN function has been implicated in the progression of several types of cancer, but the correlation between loss of PTEN expression and advanced carcinomas is not well established. The capacity for angiogenesis of a tumor is known to play a very important role in growth and metastasis, and there have been reports that PTEN relates to angiogenesis. In the present study, formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded tissues from 101 patients with breast carcinomas, including 88 cases of invasive ductal carcinomas and 13 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), were evaluated by immunohistochemical methods for the expression of PTEN and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), as well as microvessel density (MVD). The results were compared with the clinicopathologic parameters. There was no loss of PTEN expression in any of the cases of DCIS, but 28 (32%) of the 88 invasive cases did not express PTEN. Loss of PTEN expression was associated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.03), but did not correlate with tumor size, tumor grade, MVD or recurrence. VEGF expression significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis in invasive ductal carcinoma (P = 0.01). There was no correlation between the expression of PTEN and that of VEGF (P = 0.63).

        "Doc_abstract":"The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/AKT signaling cascades play critical roles in the transmission of signals from growth factor receptors to regulate gene expression and prevent apoptosis. Components of these pathways are mutated or aberrantly expressed in human cancer (e.g., Ras, B-Raf, PI3K, PTEN, Akt). Also, mutations occur at genes encoding upstream receptors (e.g., EGFR and Flt-3) and chimeric chromosomal translocations (e.g., BCR-ABL) which transmit their signals through these cascades. These pathways interact with each other to regulate growth and in some cases tumorigenesis. For example, in some cells, PTEN mutation may contribute to suppression of the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade due to the ability of elevated activated Akt levels to phosphorylate and inactivate Raf-1. We have investigated the genetic structures and functional roles of these two signaling pathways in the malignant transformation and drug resistance of hematopoietic, breast and prostate cancer cells. Although both of these pathways are commonly thought to have anti-apoptotic and drug resistance effects on cells, they display different cell-lineage-specific effects. Induced Raf expression can abrogate the cytokine dependence of certain hematopoietic cell lines (FDC-P1 and TF-1), a trait associated with tumorigenesis. In contrast, expression of activated PI3K or Akt does not abrogate the cytokine dependence of these hematopoietic cell lines, but does have positive effects on cell survival. However, activated PI3K and Akt can synergize with activated Raf to abrogate the cytokine dependence of another hematopoietic cell line (FL5.12) which is not transformed by activated Raf expression by itself. Activated Raf and Akt also confer a drug-resistant phenotype to these cells. Raf is more associated with proliferation and the prevention of apoptosis while Akt is more associated with the long-term clonogenicity. In breast cancer cells, activated Raf conferred resistance to the chemotherapeutic drugs doxorubicin and paclitaxel. Raf induced the expression of the drug pump Mdr-1 (a.k.a., Pgp) and the Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic protein. Raf did not appear to induce drug resistance by altering p53/p21Cip-1 expression, whose expression is often linked to regulation of cell cycle progression and drug resistance. Deregulation of the PI3K/PTEN/Akt pathway was associated with resistance to doxorubicin and 4-hydroxyl tamoxifen, a chemotherapeutic drug and estrogen receptor antagonist used in breast cancer therapy. In contrast to the drug-resistant breast cancer cells obtained after overexpression of activated Raf, cells expressing activated Akt displayed altered (decreased) levels of p53/p21Cip-1. Deregulated expression of the central phosphatase in the PI3K/PTEN/Akt pathway led to breast cancer drug resistance. Introduction of mutated forms of PTEN, which lacked lipid phosphatase activity, increased the resistance of the MCF-7 cells to doxorubicin, suggesting that these lipid phosphatase deficient PTEN mutants acted as dominant negative mutants to suppress wild-type PTEN activity. Finally, the PI3K/PTEN/Akt pathway appears to be more prominently involved in prostate cancer drug resistance than the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. Some advanced prostate cancer cells express elevated levels of activated Akt which may suppress Raf activation. Introduction of activated forms of Akt increased the drug resistance of advanced prostate cancer cells. In contrast, introduction of activated forms of Raf did not increase the drug resistance of the prostate cancer cells. In contrast to the results observed in hematopoietic cells, Raf may normally promote differentiation in prostate cells which is suppressed in advanced prostate cancer due to increased expression of activated Akt arising from PTEN mutation. Thus in advanced prostate cancer it may be advantageous to induce Raf expression to promote differentiation, while in hematopoietic cancers it may be beneficial to inhibit Raf/MEK/ERK-induced proliferation. These signaling and anti-apoptotic pathways can have different effects on growth, prevention of apoptosis and induction of drug resistance in cells of various lineages which may be due to the expression of lineage-specific factors."},

From the published literature, it is controversial as to whether there is a relationship between these different molecular mechanisms. Therefore, a cohort of 187 pure endometrioid and non-endometrioid endometrial carcinomas, carefully characterized as to clinical and pathological features, was examined for PTEN sequence abnormalities and the immunohistochemical expression of PTEN and the DNA mismatch repair proteins MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2. MLH1 methylation analysis was performed when tumors had loss of MLH1 protein. Mismatch repair protein loss was more frequent in endometrioid carcinomas compared with non-endometrioid carcinomas, a difference primarily attributable to the presence of MLH1 methylation in a greater proportion of endometrioid tumors. Among the non-endometrioid group, mixed endometrioid/non-endometrioid carcinomas were the histotype that most commonly had loss of a mismatch repair protein. In endometrioid tumors, the frequency of PTEN loss measured by immunohistochemistry and mutation did not differ significantly between the mismatch repair protein intact or mismatch repair protein loss groups, suggesting that PTEN loss is independent of mismatch protein repair status in this group. However, in non-endometrioid carcinomas, both intact positive PTEN immunohistochemical expression and PTEN wild type were highly associated with retained positive expression of mismatch repair proteins in the tumor. Relevant to screening endometrial cancers for Lynch Syndrome, an initial PTEN immunohistochemistry determination may be able to replace the use of four mismatch repair immunohistochemical markers in 63% of patients with non-endometrioid endometrial carcinoma. Therefore, PTEN immunohistochemistry, in combination with tumor histotype, is a useful adjunct in the clinical evaluation of endometrial carcinomas for Lynch Syndrome. ",

Based on the identification of mutations in sporadic breast, brain and prostate tumours, we decided to examine the potential role of PTEN in sporadic malignant melanoma. Frozen tissue from primary cutaneous melanomas (n = 23) and metastases (n = 17) were microdissected, and microsatellite markers D10S541 and D10S547, flanking the gene on both sides, were used to search for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the PTEN gene locus. To identify mutations within the putative tumour suppressor gene, we performed single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis using intronic primers to amplify exons 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the PTEN gene. No LOH was detected using the polymorphic markers D10S541 and D10S547. SSCP analysis revealed no aberrant bands in the tumour specimen.

Here we describe an in vivo mouse model that recapitulates the most frequent rearrangement in prostate cancer, the fusion of the promoter region of TMPRSS2 with the coding region of the transcription factor, ERG. A recombinant bacterial artificial chromosome including an extended TMPRSS2 promoter driving genomic ERG was constructed and used for transgenesis in mice. TMPRSS2-ERG expression was evaluated in tissue sections and FACS-fractionated prostate cell populations. In addition to the anticipated expression in luminal cells, TMPRSS2-ERG was similarly expressed in the Sca-1(hi)/EpCAM(+) basal/progenitor fraction, where expanded numbers of clonogenic self-renewing progenitors were found, as assayed by in vitro sphere formation. These clonogenic cells increased intrinsic self renewal in subsequent generations. In addition, ERG dependent self-renewal and invasion in vitro was demonstrated in prostate cell lines derived from the model. Clinical studies have suggested that the TMPRSS2-ERG translocation occurs early in prostate cancer development. In the model described here, the presence of the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion alone was not transforming but synergized with heterozygous Pten deletion to promote PIN. Taken together, these data suggest that one function of TMPRSS2-ERG is the expansion of self-renewing cells, which may serve as targets for subsequent mutations. Primary prostate epithelial cells demonstrated increased post transcriptional turnover of ERG compared to the TMPRSS2-ERG positive VCaP cell line, originally isolated from a prostate cancer metastasis. Finally, we determined that TMPRSS2-ERG expression occurred in both castration-sensitive and resistant prostate epithelial subpopulations, suggesting the existence of androgen-independent mechanisms of TMPRSS2 expression in prostate epithelium.",

Whether these differences in isoform dependence arise from tissue specificity or from the nature of the oncogenic signal activating the PI3K pathway is important, given increasing interest in using isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors in cancer therapy. To approach this question, we studied the PI3K isoform dependence of our recently constructed prostate cancer model driven by MT. Since MT activates a number of signaling pathways, we first confirmed that the MT-driven prostate cancer model was actually dependent on PI3K. A newly generated transgenic prostate line expressing an MT allele (Y315F) known to be defective for PI3K binding displayed a markedly reduced ability to drive tumor formation. We next selectively ablated expression of either p110α or p110β in mice in which wild-type MT was expressed in the prostate. We found that tumor formation driven by MT was significantly delayed by the loss of p110α expression, while ablation of p110β had no effect. Since the tumor formation driven by MT is p110α dependent in the prostate as well as in the mammary gland, our data suggest that PI3K isoform dependence is driven by the mode of PI3K pathway activation rather than by tissue type.;Middle T antigen (MT), the oncogene of polyomavirus, can drive tumor formation in a variety of cell types and tissues. Interestingly, MT has no intrinsic enzymatic activity but instead functions by binding and activating cellular signaling proteins. One of the most important of these is the lipid kinase PI3K, which was first studied in MT immunoprecipitates. Ubiquitously expressed PI3K comes in two major isoforms: p110α and p110β. Previous work in animal models showed that p110α was the key isoform in breast tumors driven by oncogenes, including MT and HER2, while p110β was key in prostate tumors driven by Pten loss. We asked the simple question of whether a prostate tumor driven by MT depends on p110α, which would suggest that the mode of activation determines p110 isoform dependence, or p110β, which would suggest that tissue type determines isoform dependence. The clear answer is that MT depends on p110α in both the prostate and breast.",

Germline mutations of PTEN give rise to Cowden Disease (CD), an autosomal dominantly-inherited cancer syndrome which predisposes to increased risk of developing breast and thyroid tumors. However, PTEN mutations have rarely been detected in sporadic thyroid carcinomas. In this study, we confirm that PTEN mutations in sporadic thyroid cancer are infrequent as we found one point mutation and one heterozygous deletion of PTEN gene in 26 tumors and eight cell lines screened. However, we report that PTEN expression is reduced both at the mRNA and at the protein level - in five out of eight tumor-derived cell lines and in 24 out of 61 primary tumors. In most cases, decreased PTEN expression is correlated with increased phosphorylation of the PTEN-regulated protein kinase Akt/PKB. Moreover, we demonstrate that PTEN may act as a suppressor of thyroid cancerogenesis as the constitutive re-expression of PTEN into two different thyroid tumor cell lines markedly inhibits cell growth. PTEN-dependent inhibition of BrdU incorporation is accompanied by enhanced expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1 and can be overcome by simultaneous co-transfection of an excess p27kip1 antisense plasmid. Accordingly, in a subset of thyroid primary carcinomas and tumor-derived cell lines, a striking correlation between PTEN expression and the level of p27kip1 protein was observed. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that inactivation of PTEN may play a role in the development of sporadic thyroid carcinomas and that one key target of PTEN suppressor activity is represented by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1.",

Loss of heterozygosity of 10q22-24 markers and somatic PTEN mutations have been found to a greater or lesser extent in a variety of sporadic component and noncomponent cancers of CS. Among several series of sporadic breast carcinomas, the frequency of loss of flanking markers around PTEN is approximately 30 to 40%, and the somatic intragenic PTEN mutation frequency is <5%. In this study, we analyzed PTEN expression in 33 sporadic primary breast carcinoma samples using immunohistochemistry and correlated this to structural studies at the molecular level. Normal mammary tissue had a distinctive pattern of expression: myoepithelial cells uniformly showed strong PTEN expression. The PTEN protein level in mammary epithelial cells was variable. Ductal hyperplasia with and without atypia exhibited higher PTEN protein levels than normal mammary epithelial cells. Among the 33 carcinoma samples, 5 (15%) were immunohistochemically PTEN-negative; 6 (18%) had reduced staining, and the rest were PTEN-positive. In the PTEN-positive tumors as well as in normal epithelium, the protein was localized in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus (or nuclear membrane). Among the immunostain negative group, all had hemizygous PTEN deletion but no structural alteration of the remaining allele. Thus, in these cases, an epigenetic phenomenon such as hypermethylation, -ecreased protein synthesis or increased protein degradation may be involved. In the cases with reduced staining, 5 of 6 had hemizygous PTEN deletion and 1 did not have any structural abnormality. Finally, clinicopathological features were analyzed against PTEN protein expression. Three of the 5 PTEN immunostain-negative carcinomas were also both estrogen and progesterone receptor-negative, whereas only 5 of 22 of the PTEN-positive group were double receptor-negative. The significance of this last observation requires further study.",

In mammalian cells, DJ-1 underexpression results in decreased phosphorylation of PKB/Akt, while DJ-1 overexpression leads to hyperphosphorylation of PKB/Akt and increased cell survival. In primary breast cancer samples, DJ-1 expression correlates negatively with PTEN immunoreactivity and positively with PKB/Akt hyperphosphorylation.

Several recent large-scale cancer prevention trials with high dose of α-tocopherol, however, yielded disappointing results. Whether vitamin E prevents or promotes cancer is a serious concern. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of action of the different forms of tocopherols would enhance our understanding of this topic. In this study, we demonstrated that δ-T was the most effective tocopherol form in inhibiting prostate cancer cell growth, by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. By profiling the effects of δ-T on the cell signaling using the phospho-kinase array, we found that the most inhibited target was the phosphorylation of AKT on T308. Further study on the activation of AKT by EGFR and IGFR revealed that δ-T attenuated the EGF/IGF-induced activation of AKT (via the phosphorylation of AKT on T308 induced by the activation of PIK3). Expression of dominant active PIK3 and AKT in prostate cancer cell line DU145 in which PIK3, AKT, and PTEN are wild type caused the cells to be reflectory to the inhibition of δ-T, supporting that δ-T inhibits the PIK3-mediated activation of AKT. Our data also suggest that δ-T interferes with the EGF-induced EGFR internalization, which leads to the inhibition of the receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent activation of AKT. In summary, our results revealed a novel mechanism of δ-T in inhibiting prostate cancer cell growth, supporting the cancer preventive activity δ-T. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Taxol chemotherapy is one of the few therapeutic options for patients with CRPC albeit the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. We have demonstrated recently that Taxol (paclitaxel and its semisynthetic analogue docetaxel) treatment of 22Rv1, a CRPC cell line that expresses the tumor suppressor gene PTEN, inhibits AR transcriptional activity. In contrast, paclitaxel failed to inhibit AR activity in the PTEN-deficient C4-2 CRPC cells. Docetaxel treatment of 22Rv1 xenografts in mice induced mitotic arrest and a decrease in expression of the AR target gene prostate-specific antigen (PSA) mainly in tumor cells adjacent to vascular vessels. Further studies demonstrated that Taxol inhibition of the AR is mediated, at least in part, by Taxol-induced nuclear accumulation of FOXO1, a key downstream effector protein of PTEN and increased association of FOXO1 with the AR. These studies suggest that the status of the functional PTEN/FOXO pathway and the drug bioavailability may be the two key determinants for Taxol chemoresistance of CRPC in the clinic.",

However, the relation between PTEN signaling and estrogen/estrogen receptor in endometrial tumorigenesis remains unresolved. We used genetically engineered mice as a model to address this relation. Mice with a single deleted Pten allele (Pten(+/-)) spontaneously develop complex atypical hyperplasia and ~20% develop endometrial cancer. To determine the effect of removing endogenous estrogen, we performed oophorectomies on Pten(+/-) mice. Although there was a reduction in the number and severity of hyperplastic lesions, the endometrial phenotype persisted, suggesting that Pten mutation, independent of estrogen, can initiate the development of complex atypical hyperplasia. To recapitulate the situation in women with unopposed estrogen, we implanted 17β-estradiol pellets in adult female Pten heterozygous mice, resulting in increased carcinoma incidence. Because studies have shown that estrogen largely acts on the endometrium via estrogen receptor ERα, we generated Pten(+/-)ERα(-/-) mice. Strikingly, 88.9% of Pten(+/-)ERα(-/-) mice developed endometrial hyperplasia/carcinoma. Furthermore, Pten(+/-)ERα(-/-) mice showed a higher incidence of in situ and invasive carcinoma, suggesting that endometrial tumorigenesis can progress in the absence of ERα. Thus, the relation between Pten alterations and estrogen signaling in the development of endometrial carcinoma is complex; the results presented herein have important implications for the treatment of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma in women.",

Despite correlative data, how deregulated PTEN signalling leads to thyroid carcinogenesis is not known. Mice harbouring a dominant-negative mutant thyroid hormone receptor beta (TRbeta(PV/PV) mice) spontaneously develop follicular thyroid carcinoma and distant metastases similar to human cancer. To elucidate the role of PTEN in thyroid carcinogenesis, we generated TRbeta(PV/PV) mice haploinsufficient for Pten (TRbeta(PV/PV)Pten(+/-) mouse). PTEN deficiency accelerated the progression of thyroid tumour and increased the occurrence of metastasis spread to the lung in TRbeta(PV/PV)Pten(+/-) mice, thereby significantly reducing their survival as compared with TRbeta(PV/PV)Pten(+/+) mice. AKT activation was further increased by two-fold in TRbeta(PV/PV)Pten(+/-) mice thyroids, leading to increased activity of the downstream mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-p70S6K signalling and decreased activity of the forkhead family member FOXO3a.

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from 99 women with a primary diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma were evaluated for PTEN expression by immunohistochemical methods. The microvessel density (MVD) was also studied by immunohistochemical labeling of endothelial cells with CD34 antibody. Computerized image analysis was used to evaluate MVD. Reduced PTEN expression was seen in 27.3% of invasive ductal carcinoma. The MVD ranged from 22.0 to 197.0, with a median value of 58.5 (65.4 +/- 27.9). Reduced PTEN expression correlated with lymph node status (P < 0.01), tumor grade (P < 0.05), and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage (P < 0.05). There was a statistically significant correlation between reduced PTEN expression and increased MVD (P < 0.05). The mean MVD was higher in reduced PTEN-expressive tumors, irrespective of stage, compared with normal PTEN-expressive tumors with the same stage. On multivariate analysis, only TNM stage and reduced PTEN expression correlated with survival. Our results suggest that reduced PTEN expression may be an independent prognostic indicator in patients with invasive ductal carcinoma. PTEN loss may be associated with increased tumor angiogenesis.",

However, very little is known about the underlying crosstalk between SDHD and PTEN in CS-associated thyroid cancer. Here, we show SDHD-G12S and SDHD-H50R lead to impaired PTEN function through alteration of its subcellular localization accompanied by resistance to apoptosis and induction of migration in both papillary and follicular thyroid carcinoma cell lines. Other studies have shown elevated proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (SRC) activity in invasive thyroid cancer cells; so, we explore bosutinib, a specific inhibitor for SRC, to explore SRC as a mediator of SDH-PTEN crosstalk in this context. We show that SRC inhibition could rescue SDHD dysfunction-induced cellular phenotype and tumorigenesis only when wild-type PTEN is expressed, in thyroid cancer lines. Patient lymphoblast cells carrying either SDHD-G12S or SDHD-H50R also show increased nuclear PTEN and more oxidized PTEN after hydrogen peroxide treatment. Like in thyroid cells, bosutinib decreases oxidative PTEN in patient lymphoblast cells carrying SDHD variants, but not in patients carrying both SDHD variants and PTEN truncating mutations. In summary, our data suggest a novel mechanism whereby SDHD germline variants SDHD-G12S or SDHD-H50R induce thyroid tumorigenesis mediated by PTEN accumulation in the nucleus and may shed light on potential treatment with SRC inhibitors like bosutinib in PTEN-wild-type SDHD-variant/mutation positive CS/CSL patients and sporadic thyroid neoplasias.

Therefore, the PI3K-Akt pathway plays a central role in various cellular processes promoting survival signaling that can contribute to the malignant phenotype, and, consequently, is an attractive pharmacologic target. However, as single agents, the efficacy of AKT inhibitors may be limited by resistance mechanisms that result in minimal cell death in tumor cells.;We investigated the effects of the Akt inhibitor AZD5363 on cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, and Akt downstream pathway proteins. Survival mechanisms induced by AZD5363 were investigated. We then examined the impacts of inhibition of autophagy in combination with AZD5363 on cell proliferation and apoptosis. Furthermore, the anticancer activity of combination treatment of the lysosomotropic inhibitor of autophagy (chloroquine) with the Akt inhibitor AZD5363 was evaluated in PC-3 prostate cancer xenografts.;Here, we show that the Akt inhibitor AZD5363 affected the Akt downstream pathway by reducing p-mTOR, p-P70S6K, and p-S6K. While AZD5363 monotherapy induced G(2) growth arrest and autophagy, it failed to induce significant apoptosis in PC-3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines. Blocking autophagy using pharmacologic inhibitors (3-methyladenine, chloroquine, and bafilomycin A) or genetic inhibitors (siRNA targeting Atg3 and Atg7) enhanced cell death induced by Akt inhibitor AZD5363 in these tumor prostate cell lines. Importantly, the combination of AZD5363 with chloroquine significantly reduced tumor volume by 84.9% compared with the control group and by 77.5% compared with either drug alone in PC3 xenografts.;Taken together, these data show that the Akt inhibitor AZD5363 synergizes with the lysosomotropic inhibitor of autophagy chloroquine to induce apoptosis and delay tumor progression in prostate cancer models that are resistant to monotherapy AZD5363, providing a new therapeutic approach potentially translatable to patients.",

Stromal-epithelial interactions are crucial for this development; however, the precise mechanisms by which epithelium responds to stromal cues remain unknown. We have previously reported ectopic expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ2 (PPARγ2) increased androgen receptor expression and promoted differentiation of mouse prostate epithelium. PPARγ is also implicated in urothelial differentiation. Herein we demonstrate that knockdown of PPARγ2 in benign human prostate epithelial cells (BHPrEs) promotes urothelial transdifferentiation. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo heterotypic tissue regeneration models with embryonic bladder mesenchyme promoted urothelial differentiation of PPARγ2-deficient BHPrE cells, and deficiency of both PPARγ isoforms 1 and 2 arrested differentiation. Because PTEN deficiency is cooperative in urothelial pathogenesis, we engineered BHPrE cells with combined knockdown of PPARγ and PTEN and performed heterotypic recombination experiments using embryonic bladder mesenchyme. Whereas PTEN deficiency alone induced latent squamous differentiation in BHPrE cells, combined PPARγ and PTEN deficiency accelerated the development of keratinizing squamous metaplasia (KSM). We further confirmed via immunohistochemistry that gene expression changes in metaplastic recombinants reflected human urothelium undergoing KSM. In summary, these data suggest that PPARγ isoform expression provides a molecular basis for observations that adult human epithelium can be transdifferentiated on the basis of heterotypic mesenchymal induction. These data also implicate PPARγ and PTEN inactivation in the development of KSM.",

However, unlike in men, Tgfbr2(ColTKO) prostates exhibited no regression acutely after castration. The administration of Sabutoclax (BI-97C1), a pan-active Bcl-2 protein family antagonist mediated apoptosis in castrate-resistant PCa cells of Tgfbr2(ColTKO) mice and human subcutaneous, orthotopic, and intratibial xenograft PCa models. Interestingly, Sabutoclax had little apoptotic effect on benign prostate tissue in Tgfbr2(ColTKO) and wild-type mice.

When the cancer recurs, early stages can be controlled with hormone ablation therapy to delay the rate of cancer progression but, over time, the cancer overcomes its hormone dependence, becomes highly aggressive and metastasizes. Clinical trials have shown that pomegranate juice (PJ) inhibits PCa progression. We have previously shown that the PJ components luteolin (L), ellagic acid (E) and punicic acid (P) together inhibit growth of hormone-dependent and -independent PCa cells and inhibit their migration and chemotaxis towards CXCL12, a chemokine that is important in PCa metastasis. On the basis of these findings, we hypothesized that L+E+P inhibit PCa metastasis in vivo. To test this possibility, we used a severe combined immunodeficiency mouse model in which luciferase-expressing human PCa cells were injected subcutaneously near the prostate. Tumor progression was monitored with bioluminescence imaging weekly. We found that L+E+P inhibits PC-3M-luc primary tumor growth, inhibits the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis for metastasis and none of the tumors metastasized. In addition, L+E+P significantly inhibits growth and metastasis of highly invasive Pten (-/-) ;K-ras (G12D) prostate tumors. Furthermore, L+E+P inhibits angiogenesis in vivo, prevents human endothelial cell (EC) tube formation in culture and disrupts preformed EC tubes, indicating inhibition of EC adhesion to each other. L+E+P also inhibits the angiogenic factors interleukin-8 and vascular endothelial growth factor as well as their induced signaling pathways in ECs.

        "Doc_abstract":"PROBLEM STATEMENT: RNA polymerase III (RNA pol III) is responsible for transcribing many of the small structural RNA molecules involved in RNA processing and protein translation, thereby regulating the growth rate of a cell. RNA pol III transcribes both gene internal (tRNA) and gene external (U6 snRNA) promoters and proper initiation by RNA polymerase III requires the transcription initiation factor TFIIIB. TFIIIB has been shown to be a target of repression by tumor suppressors such as ARF, p53, RB and the RB-related pocket proteins. Also, TFIIIB activity is stimulated by the oncogenes c-Myc and the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase. Recently, two TFIIIB subunits, BRF1 and BRF2, have been demonstrated to behave as oncogenes, making deregulation of TFIIIB activity and thus RNA pol III transcription an important step in tumor development. PTEN is a commonly mutated tumor suppressor regulating cell growth, proliferation and survival. Thus, we sought to examine the potential role of PTEN in regulating U6 snRNA transcription. APPROACH: We examined the potential for PTEN to regulate U6 snRNA transcription using in vitro RNA pol III luciferase assays, western blotting and deletion analysis in cancer cell lines differing in their PTEN status. RESULTS: Using breast, cervical, prostate and glioblastoma cancer cells we demonstrate: (1) PTEN inhibition of gene external RNA pol III transcription is cell type specific, (2) PTEN-mediated inhibition of U6 transcription occurs via the C2 lipid-binding domain and (3) PTEN repression of U6 transcription occurs, at least in part, through the TFIIIB subunit BRF2. CONCLUSION/RECOMMENDATIONS: Our data demonstrates that regulation of the U6 snRNA gene by PTEN is mediated, in part by the TFIIIB oncogene BRF2, potentially identifying novel targets for chemotherapeutic drug design.",

As a key enzyme for FA synthesis fatty acid synthase (FASN) is often overexpressed in human prostate cancers and its expression correlates with worse prognosis and poor survival. P300 is an acetyltransferase that acts as a transcription co-activator. Increasing evidence suggests that P300 is a major PCa promoter, although the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that P300 binds to and increases histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27Ac) in the FASN gene promoter. We provided evidence that P300 transcriptionally upregulates FASN expression and promotes lipid accumulation in human PCa cells in culture and Pten knockout prostate tumors in mice. Pharmacological inhibition of P300 decreased FASN expression and lipid droplet accumulation in PCa cells. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that expression of P300 protein positively correlates with FASN protein levels in a cohort of human PCa specimens. We further showed that FASN is a key mediator of P300-induced growth of PCa cells in culture and in mice. Together, our findings demonstrate P300 as a key factor that regulates FASN expression, lipid accumulation and cell growth in PCa.

Infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) is associated with reduced disease-free survival following radical prostatectomy. However, the association between PTEN loss, TAM infiltration and radiotherapy response of CaP cells remains to be evaluated. Immunohistochemical and molecular analysis of surgically-resected Gleason 7 tumors confirmed that PTEN loss correlated with increased CXCL8 expression and macrophage infiltration. However PTEN status had no discernable correlation with expression of other inflammatory markers by CaP cells, including TNF-α. In vitro, exposure to conditioned media harvested from irradiated PTEN null CaP cells induced chemotaxis of macrophage-like THP-1 cells, a response partially attenuated by CXCL8 inhibition. Co-culture with THP-1 cells resulted in a modest reduction in the radio-sensitivity of DU145 cells. Cytokine profiling revealed constitutive secretion of TNF-α from CaP cells irrespective of PTEN status and IR-induced TNF-α secretion from THP-1 cells. THP-1-derived TNF-α increased NFκB pro-survival activity and elevated expression of anti-apoptotic proteins including cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1 (cIAP-1) in CaP cells, which could be attenuated by pre-treatment with a TNF-α neutralizing antibody. Treatment with a novel IAP antagonist, AT-IAP, decreased basal and TNF-α-induced cIAP-1 expression in CaP cells, switched TNF-α signaling from pro-survival to pro-apoptotic and increased radiation sensitivity of CaP cells in co-culture with THP-1 cells. We conclude that targeting cIAP-1 can overcome apoptosis resistance of CaP cells and is an ideal approach to exploit high TNF-α signals within the TAM-rich microenvironment of PTEN-deficient CaP cells to enhance response to radiotherapy.

The purpose of this study was to re-evaluate the latent carcinogenic period of BZ and BNA, in order to set the safety period after exposure for the health surveillance system.;The subjects were 236 dyestuff-plant workers in Tokyo, who had been exposed to these dyestuffs. The incidence of bladder cancer and its histopathology in this group was surveyed in the period from 1962 to 1996.;Nineteen workers (8.1%) were found to have bladder cancers. The exposure period for these 19 patients was 82.0 +/- 50.2 months. The mean +/- SD latent period from the subjects' initial and final exposure until tumor development was 29.5 +/- 8.2 years and 20.1 +/- 10.6 years, respectively. Significantly, a negative correlation (Pearson) was observed between the exposure period and the latent period from the end of exposure to cancer onset (R = -0.544, P < 0.05). All tumors except one were transitional cell carcinoma. Flow cytometric analysis was performed in 11 patients and all of these patients had DNA aneuploidy.;The latent periods of bladder cancer caused by BZ and BNA were longer than previously expected. It is necessary to survey the onset of bladder cancer in exposed workers more than 30 years after the initial exposure.",

It has a critical role in prostate cancer (PC) including Pten loss-driven carcinogenesis, but the molecular basis of this remains unclear. We investigated the effect of GRP78 and its putative client proteins, including androgen receptor (AR) in clinical PC. Expression of GRP78 and key Hsp70-hsp90 client proteins (HER2, HER3, AR and AKT) were studied in an incidence tissue microarray (TMA) of prostate cancer. The relationship of GRP78 and AR was further tested in in vitro cell models (LNCaP and its derived LNCaP-CR subclone) and a matched TMA of hormone-naïve (HNPC) and castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In vitro and in vivo expression of GRP78 and client proteins were assessed by western blotting and immunohistochemistry, respectively, using the weighted histoscore method. Significant co-expression of GRP78, pAKT, HER2, HER3 and AR was observed in PC. Abnormal AR, GRP78 and pAKT expression have significant impact on patient survival. GRP78 expression in AR(+) tumours was significantly higher than in AR(-) tumours. In keeping with our clinical data, activation of AR by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) potently activated GRP78 expression in both LNCaP and LNCaP-CR cells. For the first time, using a matched HNPC and CRPC TMA, enhanced cytoplasmic and membranous GRP78 expression was observed in CRPC. Future prospective studies are therefore warranted to validate GRP78 as prognostic marker and therapeutic target, in the context of the AR and pAKT status. In summary, GRP78 is co-expressed with Hsp70-hsp90 client proteins. Up-regulated expression of AR and GRP78 expression in untreated prostate cancer predicts a less favourable outcome. This points to the importance of understanding in the molecular interaction among AR, GRP78 and AKT.",

The PTEN and TSC2 tumor suppressors function to antagonize mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) activation by Akt; hence, compound heterozygous inactivation of Pten and Tsc2 in the mouse may in principle exacerbate the tumor phenotypes observed in the single mutants in a reciprocal manner. In contrast, we found that while Tsc2 heterozygosity unmasks Pten haploinsufficiency in growth and tumor suppression, tumorigenesis in Tsc2+/- mutants is surprisingly not accelerated by Pten heterozygosity, even though mTOR activation is cooperatively enhanced by compound Pten/Tsc2 heterozygosity. We show that the wild-type alleles of both Pten and Tsc2 are retained in prostate tumors from both Pten+/- and Pten+/-Tsc2+/- mice, whereas TSC-related tumor lesions are invariably associated with Tsc2 loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in both Tsc2+/- and Pten+/-Tsc2+/- mice. These findings demonstrate that inactivation of TSC2 is epistatic to PTEN in the control of tumor initiation and progression and, importantly, that both Pten and Tsc2 are haploinsufficient for suppression of tumorigenesis initiated by Pten heterozygosity, while neither Pten nor Tsc2 is haploinsufficient for repression of carcinogenesis arising from Tsc2 heterozygosity, providing a rationale for the differential cancer susceptibility of the two human conditions associated with PTEN or TSC2 heterozygous mutations.",

Then, we confirmed it by data of six types of other cancer including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, papillary thyroid carcinoma, pituitary gonadotrope tumors, ovarian cancer, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The results showed a clear cancer-associated ceRNA network.

Normal proliferative, EIN, and malignant (endometrial adenocarcinoma) endometrial tissues were immunostained for PTEN and PAX2. Proliferative samples with loss of protein in at least one gland were scored as latent precancers. EIN and cancer lesions were scored by the majority pattern. Overall prevalence and topography of joint PAX2-PTEN expression loss was examined. The prevalence of PAX2 protein loss in the sequence of normal to precancer to cancer was 36%, 71%, and 77%, respectively, and for PTEN, it was 49%, 44%, and 68%, respectively. The normal endometrial prevalence of PAX2- or PTEN-deficient latent precancers was unaffected by biopsy indication, but increased significantly with age. Coincident loss of PAX2 and PTEN expression in an individual normal endometrium was seen in 21% of patients, but usually involved different glands. Coincident loss was more common in precancers (31%) and carcinoma (55%), in which case, both markers were protein null in an overlapping clonal distribution. PAX2 and PTEN protein loss occurs independently and accumulates with increasing age in latent precancers of normal premenopausal endometrium.

Allelic losses in the proximity of the PTEN locus (10q23) also occur in sporadic colorectal cancers (CRCs), but biallelic inactivation of this site has not been frequently demonstrated. We hypothesized that alternative mechanisms of PTEN allelic inactivation, such as promoter hypermethylation, might be operative in CRC and that PTEN inactivation may be related to recognized forms of genomic instability. We characterized a cohort of 273 sporadic CRCs by determining their microsatellite instability (MSI) status. Of these, 146 cancers were examined for PTEN promoter methylation by methylation-specific PCR. Mutations at the poly(A)6 repeat sequences in PTEN exons 7 and 8 and deletions at the 10q23 locus were also identified using microsatellite analysis. The presence of PTEN protein was determined by immunostaining, and the results were correlated with the promoter methylation status. We observed that PTEN promoter hypermethylation was a frequent occurrence in MSI-high (MSI-H) tumors (19.1% of MSI-H versus 2.2% of MSI-low/microsatellite stable tumors; P = 0.002). A PTEN mutation or a deletion event was present in 60% of the tumors with promoter region hypermethylation. Hypermethylation of the PTEN promoter correlated significantly with either decreased or complete loss of PTEN protein expression (P = 0.004). This is the first demonstration of PTEN inactivation as a result of promoter hypermethylation in MSI-H sporadic CRCs. These data suggest that this silencing mechanism plays a major role in PTEN inactivation and, in colon cancer, may be more important than either allelic losses or inactivating mutations. The significant correlation of PTEN hypermethylation with MSI-H tumors further suggests that PTEN is an additional important \"target\" of methylation along with the hMLH1 gene in the evolution of MSI-H CRCs and also confers the \"second hit\" in the biallelic inactivation mechanism for some proportion of tumors.",

The results demonstrate that TSC2 inhibits IKK/NF-κB activity downstream of Akt and upstream of mTORC1 in a PTEN-deficient environment. However, TSC2 promotes IKK/NF-κB activity upstream of Akt and mTORC1 in TSC2 mutated tumor cells. These data indicate that TSC2 negatively or positively regulates IKK/NF-κB activity in a context-dependent manner depending on the genetic background.;This study provides fundamental insight for understanding the molecular details by which TSC2/mTOR regulates NF-κB signaling in different tumors.",

Comparative biodistribution and imaging studies were performed in athymic mice bearing human colon carcinoma xenografts (LS-174T). Tumor uptake of radiolabel was very similar between the chelates (30% ID/g) and tumors were identified in scintigraphic images with all the chelate-antibody complexes. The uptake by normal organs, especially the liver, was greater for MA-DTPA, CA-DTPA, and SCN-Bz-EDTA chelate-B72.3 IgG (1.3:1 to 2.5:1) in comparison to that found with the B72.3-SCN-Bz-DTPA (approximately 5:1) and abdominal organ, and uptake was very prominent on imaging with these chelate-MAb complexes but was virtually absent in the mice injected with B72.3-SCN-Bz-DTPA. Purification of the MAb-chelate complex by Sephadex G-50 chromatography followed by HPLC using a TSK-3000 column provided better subsequent biodistribution and also resulted in clearer images as compared to MAb chelate complexes purified by less rigorous purification protocols. We conclude that the 111In-SCN-Bz-DTPA complex is superior, at least when bound to MAb B72.3, to other chelate-complexes currently in use.",

Akt is strongly inhibited by perifosine, an orally active alkyl-lysophospholipid currently being evaluated as an anti-cancer agent in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. To determine whether perifosine may enhance the antitumor activity of the anti-EGF receptor monoclonal antibody cetuximab/C225 in PTEN-deficient cancer cells, we exposed MDA468 breast cancer cells (which contain mutated PTEN gene) and PC3 prostate cancer cells (in which the PTEN gene is deleted) to perifosine and cetuximab, alone and in combination. Treatment of the cells with perifosine reduced baseline levels of phosphorylated Akt, phosphorylated p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and p38MAPK, and increased baseline levels of phosphorylated stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/c-jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK). A 72-h exposure of the MDA468 and PC3 cells to perifosine alone resulted in cell death in a dose-dependent manner, which was enhanced by cetuximab. Addition of subtoxic doses of perifosine to cetuximab treatment also enhanced the cetuximab-induced growth inhibition. The combination treatment enhanced the inhibition of phosphorylation of Akt, p44/42MAPK and p38MAPK, but offset the phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK that was activated by perifosine treatment alone. Taken together, the data showed that perifosine enhances the antitumor activity of cetuximab in PTEN-deficient cancer cells. Further evaluation of the combination treatment in preclinical and clinical studies is warranted.",

Tumor promotion by TMEPAI depends on two different but related actions on TGF-β signaling. Firstly, TMEPAI binds and sequesters regulatory Smads2/3 and thereby decreases growth suppressive signaling by TGF-β. Secondly, increased expression of TMEPAI decreases PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) abundance, and thereby increases TGF-β dependent tumor promotive PI3K/Akt signaling. These actions of TMEPAI give rise to increased cell proliferation and motility. Moreover, signaling alterations produced by high TMEPAI were associated with oncogenic Snail expression and lung metastases. Finally, an inverse correlation between TMEPAI and PTEN levels was confirmed in triple negative breast cancer tumor samples. Together, our findings suggest that TMEPAI has dually critical roles to promote TGF-β dependent cancer cell growth and metastasis. Thus, redirected TGF-β signaling through TMEPAI may play a pivotal role in TGF-β mediated tumor promotion. ",

The aim of this study is to comprehensively investigate PTEN alterations in a large cohort of Middle Eastern papillary thyroid cancer by immunohistochemistry and fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH).;PTEN protein expression was analysed by immunohistochemistry in a tissue microarray (TMA) format in a large cohort of more than 1000 patients with papillary thyroid cancer. Copy number changes in PTEN were analysed by FISH and data were correlated with clinicopathological parameters along with survival analysis.;PTEN inactivation reflected by complete absence of staining was seen in 24.5% of PTC samples, whereas PTEN deletion was seen only in 4.8% of the tested samples by FISH. No association was seen between PTEN loss of protein expression and PTEN gene deletion. However, interestingly, PTEN loss of expression was significantly associated with the follicular variant subset of papillary thyroid cancer.;Our study confirmed that PTEN might have a role in pathogenesis in a subset of PTC. PTEN loss of protein expression is a more common event in follicular variant of papillary thyroid cancer. Lack of association between PTEN loss of protein expression and PTEN gene deletion might indicate that gene deletion may not be the sole cause for PTEN loss of expression and these results might raise the possibility of other mechanism such as promoter methylation-mediated gene silencing to be responsible for PTEN inactivation.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Growth factors and mitogens use the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade to transmit signals from their receptors to regulate gene expression and prevent apoptosis. Some components of these pathways are mutated or aberrantly expressed in human cancer (e.g., Ras, B-Raf). Mutations also occur at genes encoding upstream receptors (e.g., EGFR and Flt-3) and chimeric chromosomal translocations (e.g., BCR-ABL) which transmit their signals through these cascades. Even in the absence of obvious genetic mutations, this pathway has been reported to be activated in over 50% of acute myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia and is also frequently activated in other cancer types (e.g., breast and prostate cancers). Importantly, this increased expression is associated with a poor prognosis. The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt pathways interact with each other to regulate growth and in some cases tumorigenesis. For example, in some cells, PTEN mutation may contribute to suppression of the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade due to the ability of activated Akt to phosphorylate and inactivate different Rafs. Although both of these pathways are commonly thought to have anti-apoptotic and drug resistance effects on cells, they display different cell lineage specific effects. For example, Raf/MEK/ERK is usually associated with proliferation and drug resistance of hematopoietic cells, while activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade is suppressed in some prostate cancer cell lines which have mutations at PTEN and express high levels of activated Akt. Furthermore the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt pathways also interact with the p53 pathway. Some of these interactions can result in controlling the activity and subcellular localization of Bim, Bak, Bax, Puma and Noxa. Raf/MEK/ERK may promote cell cycle arrest in prostate cells and this may be regulated by p53 as restoration of wild-type p53 in p53 deficient prostate cancer cells results in their enhanced sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs and increased expression of Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. Thus in advanced prostate cancer, it may be advantageous to induce Raf/MEK/ERK expression to promote cell cycle arrest, while in hematopoietic cancers it may be beneficial to inhibit Raf/MEK/ERK induced proliferation and drug resistance. Thus the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway has different effects on growth, prevention of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and induction of drug resistance in cells of various lineages which may be due to the presence of functional p53 and PTEN and the expression of lineage specific factors.",

However, the regulation of PTEN expression is still not well understood. We previously reported that androgen receptor (AR) activates PTEN transcription in breast cancer cells. Here, we found that the transcription factor GATA2 (GATA binding protein 2) is overexpressed in non-cultured human breast carcinomas and is negatively correlated with PTEN expression. We then showed GATA2 promotes breast cancer cell growth and stimulates AKT phosphorylation by inhibiting PTEN transcription. We mapped a GATA2-binding site in the PTEN promoter, whereby GATA2 not only blocks AR-induced PTEN expression by preventing AR nuclear translocation, but also directly represses PTEN transcription independent of AR. Most importantly, for the first time, we have discovered a novel reverse regulation within the traditional PTEN/AKT signaling pathway, whereby AKT induces GATA2 with consequent decreased PTEN transcription, likely germane in tumor invasion and metastases but not initiation.",

The tumor suppressor gene phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10 (PTEN) is frequently mutated or deleted in numerous tumors, especially in endometrial carcinoma. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the aberrant expression of PTTG1 and PTEN is associated with tumorigenesis and progression of endometrial carcinoma. Tissue microarray and immunohistochemical staining were undertaken in 124 endometrial carcinoma, 28 atypical hyperplasia and 35 normal endometrium samples. Then, the correlation of PTTG1 and PTEN expression with the clinicopathological features and with the levels of estrogen and progesterone receptor was analyzed. The presence of PTTG1 and PTEN protein was significantly increased and decreased, respectively, as lesions progressed from normal endometrium to atypical hyperplasia to carcinoma. PTTG1 protein showed a significantly positive correlation with TNM stage, but not with other characteristics. In addition, PTEN protein did not correlate with any parameters except for histological grade, to which it was found to be inversely related. Statistical analysis confirmed a significant relationship between an increase in PTTG1 and a decrease in PTEN. These results indicate that high expression of PTTG1 and low expression of PTEN may be involved in pathogenesis and development of endometrial carcinoma. The findings also provide evidence that combined evaluation of the two markers may be useful in predicting tumor behavior and thus prognosis.",

Increased levels of MVP, vault-associated vRNA and vaults have been linked directly to non-P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance (MDR). To further characterize the putative role of vaults in MDR, expression levels of all of the vault proteins were examined in various MDR cell lines. Subcellular fractionation of vault particles revealed that all 3 vault proteins are increased in MDR cells compared to the parental, drug-sensitive cells. Furthermore, protein analysis of subcellular fractions of the drug-sensitive, MVP-transfected AC16 cancer cell line indicated that vault levels are increased, in this stable line. Since TEP1 is shared by both vaults and the telomerase complex, TEP1 protein (and vault) levels were compared with telomerase activity in a variety of cell lines, including various MDR lines. Our studies demonstrate that while vault levels may be a good predictor of drug resistance, their up-regulation alone is not sufficient to confer the drug-resistant phenotype.

Targeted inhibition of downstream pathways, namely mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) may prove to be important in the treatment of HRPC because of the prevalence of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) loss, and it has been shown preclinically that mTOR inhibition reverses the phenotype of PTEN loss.

The dilemma is to specifically identify among all prostate tumors the very aggressive high-grade cancers that will become life-threatening by developing extra-prostatic invasion and metastatic potential and the indolent cancers that will never modify a patient's life expectancy. A choice must be made between several therapeutic options to achieve the optimal personalized management of the disease that causes as little harm as possible to patients. Reliable clinical, biological, or pathological markers that would enable distinctions to be made between aggressive and indolent PCas in routine practice at the time of initial diagnosis are still lacking. The molecular mechanisms that explain why a PCa is aggressive or not are also poorly understood. Among the potential markers and/or actors in PCa aggressiveness, Src and other members of the Src kinase family, are valuable candidates. Activation of Src-dependent intracellular pathways is frequently observed in PCa. Indeed, Src is at the cross-roads of several pathways [including androgen receptor (AR), TGFbeta, Bcl-2, Akt/PTEN or MAPK, and ERK …], and is now known to influence some of the cellular and tissular events that accompany tumor progression: cell proliferation, cell motility, invasion, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, resistance to apoptosis, angiogenesis, neuroendocrine differentiation, and metastatic spread. Recent work even suggests that Src could also play a part in PCa initiation in coordination with the AR. The aim of this review is to gather data that explore the links between the Src kinase family and PCa progression and aggressiveness. ",

However, direct in vivo evidence for the role of EMT in the formation of cancer stem-like cells (CSC) and the metastatic cascade remains lacking. Here we report the first isolation and characterization of mesenchymal-like and EMT tumor cells, which harbor both epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics, in an autochthonous murine model of prostate cancer. By crossing the established Pb-Cre(+/-);Pten(L/L);Kras(G12D) (/+) prostate cancer model with a vimentin-GFP reporter strain, generating CPKV mice, we were able to isolate epithelial, EMT, and mesenchymal-like cancer cells based on expression of vimentin and EpCAM. CPKV mice (but not mice with Pten deletion alone) exhibited expansion of cells with EMT (EpCAM(+)/Vim-GFP(+)) and mesenchymal-like (EpCAM(-)/Vim-GFP(+)) characteristics at the primary tumor site and in circulation. These EMT and mesenchymal-like tumor cells displayed enhanced stemness and invasive character compared with epithelial tumor cells. Moreover, they displayed an enriched tumor-initiating capacity and could regenerate epithelial glandular structures in vivo, indicative of epithelia-mesenchyme plasticity. Interestingly, while mesenchymal-like tumor cells could persist in circulation and survive in the lung following intravenous injection, only epithelial and EMT tumor cells could form macrometastases. Our work extends the evidence that mesenchymal and epithelial states in cancer cells contribute differentially to their capacities for tumor initiation and metastatic seeding, respectively, and that EMT tumor cells exist with plasticity that can contribute to multiple stages of the metastatic cascade.",

        "Doc_abstract":"A 100-fold increased incidence of bladder cancer is observed with workers exposed to high levels of benzidine (BZ). This review evaluates the overall metabolism of BZ to determine pathways involved in initiation of carcinogenesis. Enzymatic and liver slice incubations demonstrated N-acetylation and N-glucuronidation of BZ and N-acetylbenzidine (ABZ). With rat, N,N'-diacetylbenzidine (DABZ) is the major slice metabolite. With human, ABZ is the major metabolite along with N-glucuronides. Differences between rat and human are attributed to preferential acetylation of BZ and deacetylation of DABZ, resulting in N-glucuronide formation by human liver. Glucuronidation of BZ and its analogues exhibited the following relative ranking of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) metabolism: UGT1A9>UGT1A4>>UGT2B7>UGT1A6 approximately UGT1A1. N-Glucuronides of BZ, ABZ, and N'-hydroxy-N-acetylbenzidine (N'HA) are acid labile with the latter having a much longer t(1/2) than the former two glucuronides. O-Glucuronides are not acid labile. In urine from BZ-exposed workers, an inverse relationship between urine pH and levels of free (unconjugated) BZ and ABZ is observed. This is consistent with the presence of labile urinary N-glucuronides. Cytochrome P-450 oxidizes BZ to an inactive product (3-OHz.sbnd;BZ) and ABZ to N'HA and N-hydroxy-N-acetylbenzidine (NHA). Cytochrome P-450, PHS, and horseradish peroxidase activate ABZ to bind DNA forming N'-(3'-monophospho-deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-N-acetylbenzidine (dGp-ABZ). This is the major adduct detected in bladder cells from workers exposed to BZ. An inverse relationship exists between urine pH and levels of bladder cell dGp-ABZ. Bladder epithelium contains relatively high levels of prostaglandin H synthase (PHS) and low levels of cytochrome p-450, suggesting activation by PHS. Activation by PHS involves a peroxygenase oxidation of ABZ to N'HA, while horseradish peroxidase activates ABZ to a diimine monocation. Reactive nitrogen oxygen species (RNOS) offer a new pathway for metabolism and potential activation. Results suggest BZ initiation of bladder cancer is complex, involving multiple organs (i.e. liver, kidney, and bladder) and metabolic pathways (i.e. N-acetylation, N-glucuronidation, peroxidation, and RNOS).",

Here, we report the results of the first association study on genetic variation in telomere-associated genes and their effect on telomere length, breast cancer (BC) susceptibility and prognosis. We genotyped 14 potentially functional and most informative SNPs in nine telomere-associated genes (TERT, TEP1, TERF1, TERF2, TERF2IP, ACD, POT1, TNKS and TNKS2) in 782 incident BC cases and 1559 matched controls.

The PTEN-/-/NIC mouse is a genetically engineered mouse model for ErbB2/Neu-overexpressing/‑PTEN deficient breast carcinoma with histopathological and molecular features relevant to the luminal subtype of primary human breast cancer. However, the PTEN-/-/NIC model develops multifocal and aggressive mammary tumors with a short life-span, which greatly impedes its preclinical usage. To complement the genetic engineering approach and to facilitate the future application of this model, in the present study, two newly established cell lines, NICP20 and NICP21, from PTEN-/-/NIC mammary tumors are described. These NICP20 and NICP21 cells retained the crucial molecular phenotype similar to the origin, as confirmed by genotyping and western blot analysis. These cells induced tumors in immunocompetent syngeneic mice by mammary fat pad injection and produced lung metastasis when injected intravenously. Tumors induced by these cells displayed luminal‑like histologic morphology and hyperactivation of Akt which are similar to PTEN-/-/NIC tumors. Immunohistochemical staining also revealed that tumors induced by the NICP20 and NICP21 cells showed a high proliferative level, comparable angiogenesis and T-cell infiltration properties similar to PTEN-/-/NIC tumors. Therefore, these NICP20 and NICP21 cells represent an alternative and useful model system to enhance our understanding of the nature of ErbB2-positive breast cancers, particularly accompanying PTEN loss and to facilitate further experimental therapeutic studies.",

Our aim was to investigate the effects of GnRH-I agonists and GnRH-II on estrogen receptor-negative human endometrial carcinoma cells and the effect from phosphatase and tensin homolog gene (PTEN) to them.;A lentiviral vector-mediated RNAi method was used to establish a PTEN-negative HEC-1A cell clone (HEC-1A-ND).

Western blotting was used to detect AKT and ERK1/2 activation after treatment with different concentrations of Triptorelin or GnRH-II for 30 minutes in the above mentioned three kinds of cells.;Triptorelin and GnRH-II induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation of HEC-1A, HEC-1A-ND and HEC-1A-NC in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was augmented in HEC-1A-ND cells in which PTEN gene was knocked-down. Furthermore, Triptorelin and GnRH-II inhibited the AKT and ERK activity in HEC-1A-ND cells.;Triptorelin and GnRH-II can promote apoptosis rate and inhibit cell proliferation of estrogen receptor-negative endometrial carcinoma cells in a dose-dependent manner.

We report here the cloning, gene organization, cDNA sequence characterization and expression analysis of LAPSER1, an LZTS1-related gene. This gene maps within a subregion of human chromosome 10q24.3 that has been reported to be deleted in various cancers, including prostate tumors, as frequently as the neighboring PTEN locus. The complete LAPSER1 cDNA sequence encodes a predicted protein containing various domains resembling those typically found in transcription factors (P-Box, Q-rich and multiple leucine zippers). LAPSER1 is expressed at the highest levels in normal prostate and testis, where multiple isoforms are seen, some of which are either undetectable or differentially expressed in some prostate tumor tissues and cell lines. Over-expression of LAPSER1 cDNA strongly inhibited cell growth and colony-forming efficiencies of most cancer cells assessed. Together these data suggest that LAPSER1 is another gene involved in the regulation of cell growth whose loss of function may contribute to the development of cancer.",

All nine exons of PTEN were screened for mutations by direct sequencing in 144 patients with pathologically proven gastric carcinoma and their corresponding normal mucosae, followed by Western blotting to detect the changes in PI3K/AKT pathway. Direct sequencing indicated there were 27 cases with mutations among 144 patients consisting of 15 cases (55.6%) of missense mutation, nine nonsense mutations (33.3%), two 1-bp deletion (7.4%), and a mutation within intron 6 (3.7%). The mutation hot spots at codons 36, 75, 232 and 393 had not been observed previously, and the mutation sites in exons 3, 5, 6 and 8 were not found, suggesting that there might be some unique characteristic of PTEN inactivation mechanism in the Shanghai population. The PTEN mutation rate was significantly higher at pTMN stages III and IV than that at stages I and II (P<0.005), and it was higher in poorly differentiated gastric cancer than in well or moderately differentiated types (P<0.05). PTEN and E-cadherin protein expression in gastric cancer was significantly down-regulated comparing with that in paracancerous tissues, while the PI3K, AKT, MMP-2, MMP-9 and NF-kappaBp65 protein were overexpressed in cancer tissues. Our results implicated that the mutations of PTEN did not occur at a significant rate in gastric carcinoma in Shanghai, but might play a role in tumorigenesis. The mutation status of PTEN was significantly relevant to pTNM staging and degree of cell differentiation, hinting that PTEN might be a prognostic biomarker of gastric cancer.

PAX2 and PTEN expression were markedly reduced or absent in 12 of 12 and 4 of 12 tubal intraepithelial carcinomas. In summary, high-grade müllerian carcinomas share identical frequencies of altered or reduced expression of p53, PTEN and PAX2, all of which can be appreciated in tubal intraepithelial carcinomas. Because only a subset of these tumors appears to arise in the fallopian tube, attention to expression of these biomarkers in the ovary and other müllerian sites might facilitate the identification of other carcinogenic pathways.

PTEN dysfunction leads to tumorigenesis through unopposed survival signals mediated via activated protein kinase B (PKB), which may also be associated with hormone-independence. We therefore investigated the relationship between PTEN-PKB and receptor status in human breast cancer. Several molecular variables, including immunohistochemical staining for PTEN, PKB (phosphorylated on ser473), p53 and p21 were evaluated. The p53 gene was sequenced from exons 2-11. Seventy-eight participants in a randomised breast cancer trial served as the cohort for our study. Twenty-eight of 77 (36%) patients' tumours demonstrated absent or reduced PTEN expression; 17 of 78 (22%) tumours over-expressed P-PKB. A significant inverse relationship was observed between reduced PTEN and increased P-PKB expression. Reduced PTEN also correlated with reduced ER or PR expression. None of the molecular variables correlated with survival. ER and PR negative tumours, however, experienced a significantly inferior disease-free survival than other ER/PR status tumours. Immunohistochemical analyses of ER expression in mammary carcinomas arising in PTEN heterozygous knockout mice did not demonstrate a reduction in ER immunoreactivity, in comparison to wild-type mice. Our data demonstrate that the PTEN-PKB pathway is abnormal in approximately 1/3 of lymph node negative breast cancer. Dysregulated PTEN-PKB was also associated with reduced ER/PR expression, but this does not appear to be a simple direct causal relationship. These observations support the contention that dysregulation in PTEN-PKB contributes to disease progression and hormone resistance of human breast cancer.",

Here, we use a novel lineage-tracing strategy to assess the cell of origin in a diverse range of mouse models, including Nkx3.1(+/-); Pten(+/-), Pten(+/-), Hi-Myc, and TRAMP mice, as well as a hormonal carcinogenesis model. Our results show that luminal cells are consistently the observed cell of origin for each model in situ; however, explanted basal cells from these mice can generate tumors in grafts. Consequently, we propose that luminal cells are favored as cells of origin in many contexts, whereas basal cells only give rise to tumors after differentiation into luminal cells.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme that synthesises telomeres in human germ cells, embryogenesis and in cancer, maintaining chromosomal length, stability and cellular immortality. The hTERT gene is the rate-limiting determinant of telomerase reactivation during immortalization and malignant transformation. Telomeric DNA-binding proteins have been attracting increasing interest due to their essential role in the regulation of telomeric DNA length and in protecting against chromosomal end-to-end fusion. These proteins include hTR, TRF1, TRF2, TANK1, TANK2, POT1, TIN2, EST1, and TEP. This study represents the first comprehensive investigation of the mRNA expression of key telomere-related genes in human breast cancer.;One hundred and twenty seven tumour tissues and 33 normal tissues were analyzed. Levels of transcription of hTERT, hTR, TRF1, TRF2, TANK1, TANK2, POT1, TIN2, EST1, and TEP1 were determined using real-time quantitative PCR. The mRNA expression of these genes was normalized against CK19 and was then analyzed against the pathological parameters and clinical outcome over a 10 year follow up period.;The mRNA expressions of hTERT, hTR, TANK1, EST1, and TEP1 were higher in tumour samples compared with normal breast tissue. This reached statistical significance for EST1 when comparing good prognosis tumours with normal breast tissue (means=11013 vs 1160, P=0.05). Both hTERT and TEP1 levels significantly predicted overall survival (P=0.012 and 0.005 respectively) and disease-free survival (P=0.0011 and 0.01 respectively). The mRNA levels of TANK2 and POT1 were lower in malignant tissues compared with non-malignant breast tissues and this difference reached statistical significance when comparing the levels in normal tissues with those in advanced tumours (P=0.0008 and P=0.038 respectively). Their levels fell further with increasing tumour's stage and were higher in tumours from patients who remained disease free compared with those who developed local recurrence or distant metastasis or died from breast cancer.TRF2 showed a trend similar to that of TANK2 and POT1. Furthermore, there was a highly significant correlation between TANK1 expression and that of hTERT, hTR, TRF1, TRF2 and EST1, (r=0.533, 0.586, 0.608, 0.644 and 0.551 respectively, P<0.001).;Genes encoding telomere-associated proteins display different patterns of mRNA expression in human breast cancer, and in normal breast tissue, suggesting different and sometimes opposing roles in mammary carcinogenesis. hTERT, hTR, TANK1, EST1 and TEP1 seem to be up-regulated, with hTERT and TEP1 correlating with clinical outcome. Conversely, TANK2 and POT1 transcription levels demonstrate a compelling trend to be lower in malignant tissues and lower still in those patients who develop recurrent disease suggesting that TANK2 and POT1 may act as tumour suppressor genes possibly by negatively regulating telomerase activity.",

Furthermore, ROS contributes to the delicate balance between tumor cell survival and death. However, the mechanisms by which tumor cells decide to elicit survival or death signals during oxidative stress are not completely understood. We have previously reported that ROS enhanced tumorigenic functions in prostate cancer cells, such as transendothelial migration and invasion, which depended on CXCR4 and AKT signaling. Here, we report a novel mechanism by which ROS facilitated cell death through activation of AKT. We initially observed that ROS enhanced the expression of phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) in 22Rv1 human prostate cancer cells. The tumor suppressor PTEN, a negative regulator of AKT signaling, was rendered catalytically inactive through oxidation by ROS, although the expression levels remained consistent. Despite these events, cells still underwent apoptosis. Further investigation into apoptosis revealed that expression of the tumor suppressor pVHL increased, and contains a target site for p-AKT phosphorylation. pVHL and p-AKT associated in vitro, and knockdown of pVHL rescued HIF1α expression and the cells from apoptosis. Collectively, our study suggests that in the context of oxidative stress, p-AKT facilitated apoptosis by inducing pVHL function.",

Since IκBα is a substrate of the proteasome, the initial rationale for using BZ in MM has been to inhibit NF-κB. However, BZ rather activated NF-κB activity in U266 cells. BZ induces autophagy as well as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in various cell lines tested. Inhibition of initial autophagosome formation by treatment with either 3-methyladenine or siRNA for LC3B in U266 cells and knockdown of the atg5 gene in a murine embryonic fibroblastic cell line all resulted in attenuation of BZ-induced cell death. In contrast, combined treatment with BZ and bafilomycin A1 (BAF), which is a specific inhibitor of vacuolar-ATPase and is used as an autophagy inhibitor at the late stage, resulted in synergistic cytotoxicity, compared with that by either BZ or BAF alone. BAF treatment also induced ER stress, but the kinetics of inductions of ER stress-related genes [e.g. CHOP (GADD153) and GRP78] completely differed between BZ- and BAF-treatments: BZ induced these ER stress markers within 8 h, whereas treatment with BAF required more than 48 h in U266 cells. In order to synchronize ER stress, we pre-treated U266 cells with BAF for 48 h, followed with BZ for 48 h. The sequential treatment with BAF and BZ induced a further enhanced cytotoxicity, compared with the simultaneous combination of BAF and BZ. These data suggest crosstalk among the ubiquitin-proteasome system, the autophagy-lysosome system, and ER stress.

Unfortunately, resistance to docetaxel therapy is an ultimate occurrence. Alterations in androgen receptor (AR) expression and signaling are associated mechanisms underlying resistance to docetaxel treatment in CRPC. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone, which regulates the activation, maturation and stability of critical signaling proteins involved in prostate cancer, including the AR. This knowledge and recent advances in compound design and development have highlighted Hsp90 as an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of CRPC. We recently reported the development of a MYC-CaP castrate resistant (MYC-CaP/CR) transplant tumor model, which expresses amplified wild type AR. Within, we report that a second generation Hsp90 inhibitor, NVP-AUY922, inhibits cell growth and significantly induces cell death in MYC-CaP/CR and Pten-CaP/cE2 cell lines. NVP-AUY922 induced proteasome degradation of AR, though interestingly does not require loss of AR protein to inhibit AR transcriptional activity. Further, NVP-AUY922 increased docetaxel toxicity in MYC-CaP/CR and Pten-CaP/cE2 cell lines in vitro. Finally, NVP-AUY922/docetaxel combination therapy in mice bearing MYC-CaP/CR tumors resulted in greater anti-tumor activity compared to single treatment. This study demonstrates that NVP-AUY922 elicits potent activity towards AR signaling and augments chemotherapy response in a mouse model of CRPC, providing rationale for the continued clinical development of Hsp90 inhibitors in clinical trials for treatment of CRPC patients.

No variants predicted to alter protein function were detected in LKB1, but 1 of 72 cancers showed a somatic mutation in PTEN, together with allele loss. This cancer did not have a detectable APC mutation or allele loss at APC. It remains possible that PTEN and LKB1 are inactivated in other sporadic colon cancers by means such as deletion or promoter methylation.

We tested the possible involvement of p110β in a recently described rapid depletion of phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) in the nucleus. Previous work showed that this down-regulation is induced by extracellular ATP or by statins and is mediated by the purinergic receptor P2X7. Here, we used p110β knock out mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and siRNA-treated cancer cells. We found that p110β is essential for ATP- or statin-induced nuclear pAkt depletion in MEFs and in several cancer cell lines including prostate cancer cells. ATP, statin or the selective P2X7 agonist BzATP also inhibited cell growth, and this inhibition was not seen in p110β knock out cells. We also found that p110β was necessary for statin-induced changes in binding between FKBP51, pAkt and PTEN. Our data show that p110β is essential for the ATP- and statin-induced effects and support a role of nuclear pAkt in cancer development.

Local CaP recurrence after RT is a pattern of treatment failure attributable to radioresistance of cancer cells. One major obstacle to RT is that there is a limit to the amount of radiation that can be safely delivered to the target organ. Recent results indicate that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, autophagy, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cells (CSCs) are involved in CaP metastasis and radioresistance. Emerging evidence also suggests that combining a radiosensitizer with RT increases the efficacy of CaP treatment. Understanding the mechanisms of radioresistance will help to overcome recurrence after RT in CaP patients and prevent metastasis. In this review, we discuss the novel findings of PI3K/Akt/PTEN/mTOR signaling pathway, autophagy, EMT and CSCs in the regulation of CaP metastasis and radioresistance, and focus on combination of radiosensitizers with RT in the treatment of CaP in preclinical studies to explore novel approaches for future clinical trials.

Here we show that celecoxib suppressed the self-renewal and drug-pumping functions in HCC cells. Besides, celecoxib depleted CD44+/CD133+ hepatic cancer stem cells (hCSC). Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and CD133 overexpression did not reverse the celecoxib-induced depletion of hCSC. Also, celecoxib inhibited progression of rat Novikoff hepatoma. Moreover, a 60-day celecoxib program increased the survival rate of rats with hepatoma. Histological analysis revealed that celecoxib therapy reduced the abundance of CD44+/CD133+ hCSCs in hepatoma tissues. Besides, the hCSCs depletion was associated with elevated apoptosis and blunted proliferation and angiogenesis in hepatoma. Celecoxib therapy activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and up-regulated PTEN, thereby inhibiting Akt and disrupting hCSC expansion. PTEN gene delivery by adenovirus reduced CD44/CD133 expression in vitro and hepatoma formation in vivo.

Another 10 3-month-old male rats were included in a young control group and fed on the same diet as the aged control rats. At the end of 3 months of CGD treatment, the prostates of all the rats were harvested and weighed. The histomorphological and interstitial changes of the prostatic tissue were observed by HE staining and Masson staining, respectively. The expressions of phosphorylated phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), phosphorylated Akt (Ser 473) and phosphorylated PTEN in the rat prostate were determined by Western blotting.;The wet weight and index of the prostate were significantly higher in the aged controls than in the young controls ([1 220 +/- 140] vs [550 +/- 60] mg, P < 0.01; 2.08 +/- 0.17 vs 1.94 +/- 0.10, P < 0.05).

However, the detailed mechanism by which sodium selenite specifically kills tumor cells remains unclear. Herein, we demonstrated that supranutritional doses of selenite-induced apoptosis in CRC cells through reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent modulation of the PI3K/AKT/FoxO3a signaling pathway. First, we found that selenite treatment in HCT116 and SW480 CRC cells caused inhibition of AKT and the nuclear accumulation of FoxO3a by western blot and immunofluorescence analyses, respectively, thereby facilitating transcription of the target genes bim and PTEN. Modulation of the AKT/FoxO3a/Bim signaling pathway by chemical inhibitors or RNA interference revealed that these events were critical for selenite-induced apoptosis in CRC cells. Additionally, we discovered that FoxO3a-mediated upregulation of PTEN exerted a further inhibitory effect on the AKT survival pathway. We also corroborated our findings in vivo by performing immunohistochemistry experiments. In summary, our results show that selenite could induce ROS-dependent FoxO3a-mediated apoptosis in CRC cells and xenograft tumors through PTEN-mediated inhibition of the PI3K/AKT survival axis. These results help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying selenite-induced cell death in tumor cells and provide a theoretical basis for translational applications of selenium.",

The disease shares clinical and histopathological features with small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). The genetic mechanisms underlying the development and tumor progression of MCC are poorly understood. We recently showed by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) that the pattern of chromosomal abnormalities in MCC resembles that of SCLC. One of the most frequently observed losses involved the entire chromosome 10 or partial loss of the chromosome 10 long arm (33% of examined MCC cases). The PTEN tumor-suppressor gene has been mapped to 10q23.3 and was shown to be mutated in a variety of human cancers including SCLC. Germline PTEN mutations have been observed in familial predisposing cancer syndromes including Cowden disease. Interestingly, an association between Cowden syndrome and Merkel cell carcinoma has been reported. To study the possible role of PTEN in MCC oncogenesis, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis for the 10q23 region was performed on 26 MCC tumor samples from 23 MCC patients. The PTEN locus was deleted in 9 of 21 (43%) informative MCC tumor samples [7 of 18 (39%) MCC patients]. Despite this high frequency of LOH at 10q23, mutation and homozygous deletion screening of the PTEN gene revealed only one tumor with a nonsense mutation and a second with a homozygous deletion of exon 9. These data suggest that either alternative mechanisms lead to inactivation of the PTEN gene or that other tumor-suppressor genes at chromosome 10 are implicated in the development of MCC.",

However, a significant number of these patients will recur and be in need of second-line therapies. The knowledge of molecular arrangements after pharmacological therapy seems to be a new primary prerequisite to predict the efficacy or the failure of a secondary therapy. Based on these considerations, we have conducted this study in order to analyze the expressions of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), Akt, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), phospho-EGFR (p-EGFR), human EGFR2 (Her2), and phospho-Her2 (p-Her2) after bicalutamide treatment. For this purpose, we evaluated retrospectively 69 prostate cancer tissues derived from patients who received radical prostatectomy as the only treatment, and 81 from patients who received bicalutamide for 120 days before surgery. In addition, we analyzed at different time points the effects of castration performed on athymic mice bearing the LuCaP 35 xenograft line at different times. We observed that bicalutamide treatment increased significantly the levels of p-Akt, EGFR, and Her2 with a concomitant reduction in PTEN. This effect was time dependent and required of sufficient time to be evident as indicated by data obtained with the LuCaP 35 tumors. A logistic multiple regression analysis revealed that a switch of p-Akt control from a PTEN/EGFR- to Her2-after bicalutamide treatment was possible.

PTEN function appears to be modulated by subcellular compartmentalization, and mislocalization may affect function. We have shown that cellular ATP levels affect nuclear PTEN levels. Here, we examined the ATP-binding capabilities of PTEN and functional consequences, relevant to cancer-associated mutations. PTEN mutation analysis of CS patients and sporadic colorectal carcinomas and comparative aminoacid analysis were utilized to identify mutations in ATP-binding motifs. The ability of wild-type (WT) or mutant PTEN to bind ATP was assessed by ATP-agarose-binding assays. Subcellular fractionation, western blotting, confocal microscopy and growth assays were used to determine relative nuclear-cytoplasmic localization and function. Somatic colorectal carcinoma-derived PTEN missense mutations were associated with nuclear mislocalization. These mutations altered cellular proliferation, apoptosis and anchorage-dependent growth. Examination of PTEN's amino acid sequence revealed these mutations resided in previously undescribed ATP-binding motifs (c.60-73; c.122-136). In contrast to WT PTEN, both cancer-associated somatic and germline-derived PTEN missense mutations, which lie within the ATP-binding motifs, result in mutant PTEN that does not bind ATP efficiently. We also show that CS patients with germline ATP-binding motif-mutations had nuclear PTEN mislocalization. Of four unrelated patients with functional germline ATP-binding domain mutations, all three female patients had breast cancers. Germline and somatic mutations within PTEN's ATP-binding domain play important pathogenic roles in both heritable and sporadic carcinogenesis by PTEN nuclear mislocalization resulting in altered signaling and growth.

        "Doc_abstract":"PTEN is a tumor suppressor frequently inactivated in brain, prostate, and uterine cancer. It acts as a phosphoinositide phosphatase and consists of an amino-terminal phosphatase domain tightly linked to a COOH-terminal C2 domain involved in lipid membrane-binding. We investigated the functions of the C2 domain and their relevance for tumor growth. To discriminate between PTEN C2 domain ability to recruit or to position the active site to the membrane, we artificially membrane-targeted PTEN by a myristoylation signal. This modification increased wild-type PTEN growth inhibition but did not rescue a C2 mutant defective in lipid-binding, suggesting a model in which PTEN C2 domain positions the active site productively with respect to the membrane-bound phosphoinositide substrate. When tumor-derived mutations in the loops that connect the C2 beta-strands were analyzed, we found that these generally destabilized the protein but had variable effects on the phosphatase activity and tumor growth. The magnitude of these effects was dependent on the presence of the COOH-terminal PEST sequences and on the cell type where the mutant proteins were expressed, suggesting the existence of fluctuating structural defects of the mutant protein. One of the C2 loop mutants induced a total loss of PTEN tumor-suppressor function, most likely by affecting both the membrane binding and the protein stability. These data support a double role for PTEN C2 domain in protein stability and in productive orientation of the catalytic site.",

The level of protein expression of EGFR, PIK3CA, pAkt, mTOR, and PTEN was assessed by immunohistochemistry. In situ hybridization was used to detect the existence of human papillomavirus (HPV).;Nineteen of 61 patients with oropharyngeal cancer showed HPV-positive tumors, and two of 60 patients with oral cavity cancer showed HPV-positive tumors. EGFR and pAkt expression was significantly higher in oral cavity cancers than in oropharyngeal cancers. Loss of PTEN occurred significantly more frequently in oral cavity cancers than in oropharyngeal cancers. The expression levels of PIK3CA, mTOR, and p53 did not differ significantly between the two cancers. Overexpression of EGFR and pAkt and loss of PTEN were observed more frequently in HPV-negative tumors. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that pAkt expression had a significantly unfavorable impact on relapse-free survival in oropharyngeal cancer.;We conclude that the expression levels of EGFR, pAkt, and PTEN differ between oropharyngeal and oral cavity cancer and it may be attributed to HPV-related molecular pathogenesis.

While the role of PTEN's lipid phosphatase activity, as a negative regulator of the cytoplasmic phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt pathway is well known, it is now well established that PTEN exists and functions in the nucleus. Multiple mechanisms of regulating PTEN's subcellular localization have been reported. However none are ubiquitous across multiple cancer cell lines and tissue types. We show here that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) regulates PTEN subcellular localization in a variety of different cancer cell lines, including those derived from breast, colon and thyroid carcinomas. Cells deficient in ATP show an increased level of nuclear PTEN protein. This increase in PTEN is reversed when cells are supplemented with ATP, ADP or AMP. In contrast, the addition of the non-hydrolyzable analogue ATPgammaS, did not reverse nuclear PTEN protein levels in all the cell types tested. To our knowledge, this is the first report that describes a regulation of PTEN subcellular localization that is not specific to one cell line or tissue type, but appears to be common across a variety of cell lineages.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Cadmium (Cd) is a potential human prostate carcinogen. Chronic Cd exposure malignantly transforms RWPE-1 human prostate epithelial cells into CTPE cells by an unclear mechanism. Previous studies show that RWPE-1 can also be malignantly transformed by arsenic, and KRAS activation is key to causation and maintenance of this phenotype. Although Cd and arsenic can both transform prostate epithelial cells, it is uncertain whether their mechanisms are similar. Thus, here we determined whether KRAS activation is critical in causing and maintaining Cd-induced malignant transformation in CTPE cells. Expression of KRAS, miRNAs, and other genes of interest was analyzed by Western blot and RT-PCR. Following stable KRAS knockdown (KD) by RNA interference using shRNAmir, the malignant phenotype was assessed by various physical and genetic parameters. CTPE cells greatly overexpressed KRAS by 20-fold, indicating a likely role in Cd transformation. Thus, we attempted to reverse the malignant phenotype via KRAS KD. Two weeks after shRNAmir transduction, KRAS protein was undetectable in CTPE KD cells, confirming stable KD. KRAS KD reduced stimulated RAS/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways and markedly mitigated multiple physical and molecular malignant cell characteristics including: hypersecretion of MMP-2, colony formation, cell survival, and expression of cancer-relevant genes (reduced proliferation and cell cycle-related genes; activated tumor suppressor PTEN). However, KRAS KD did not reverse miRNA expression originally down-regulated by Cd transformation. These data strongly suggest KRAS is a key gene in development and maintenance of the Cd-induced malignant phenotype, at least in the prostate. It is not, however, the only genetic factor sustaining this phenotype. ",

In phase II trials of patients with cancer, response to microtubule inhibitors increases when these drugs are combined with estramustine. We aimed to assess whether combining estramustine with chemotherapy increases survival in patients with castration-refractory prostate cancer.;We systematically searched for randomised clinical trials that compared chemotherapy regimens with and without estramustine in patients with histologically-proven prostate cancer and were published between 1966 and 2004. Data from these studies were verified centrally and updated individual patient data were analysed. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Secondary endpoints were prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, time to PSA progression, and toxicity. A Cox regression model that was stratified by trial and adjusted for covariates at baseline was used.;The initial search identified seven eligible trials that included 742 patients, from which data from five trials including 605 patients had been collected. Individual patient data from two trials (137 patients) were no longer available. The 605 patients had been accrued between Jan 1, 1993 and Dec 1, 2003 and randomly assigned to chemotherapy plus estramustine or to chemotherapy without estramustine. Chemotherapy (with or without estramustine) consisted of docetaxel, paclitaxel, ixabepilone, and vinblastine. Median follow-up was 2.8 years (range 0.0-3.4), and 510 deaths had occurred by the end of follow-up. Cox regression analysis stratified by trial showed that concentrations of serum haemoglobin (p<0.0001), use of chemotherapy plus estramustine (p=0.008), performance status (p=0.002), and serum PSA concentrations (p=0.04) were associated independently with overall survival. Overall survival was significantly better in patients assigned chemotherapy plus estramustine (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.77 [95% CI 0.63-0.93], p=0.008). Estimated absolute increase in overall survival when estramustine was added to chemotherapy was 9.5% (SE 4.0) at 1 year after randomisation. We did not note a significant association between treatment effect on overall survival and age, concentration of serum haemoglobin, performance status, or serum PSA concentration. Patients who received chemotherapy plus estramustine had a better PSA response than those who received chemotherapy without estramustine (RR 0.53 [0.38-0.72], p<0.0001). Time to PSA progression was significantly longer in patients assigned chemotherapy plus estramustine than in those assigned chemotherapy without estramustine (HR 0.74 [0.58-0.94], p=0.01). Patients assigned chemotherapy and estramustine had more grade 3 or grade 4 thromboembolic events compared with those assigned chemotherapy without estramustine (12 of 271 vs 1 of 275).;In patients with castration-refractory prostate cancer, addition of estramustine to chemotherapy increases time to PSA progression and overall survival compared with chemotherapy without estramustine. However, this benefit should be balanced with the risk of increased thromboembolic events in patients who receive estramustine and chemotherapy in combination compared with chemotherapy without estramustine.",

In vitro studies have determined several common mutations of Tp53 that have specific gain-of-function properties in addition to loss of function, including the ability to promote castration-resistant (CR) growth of CaP cells in some contexts. To date, a lack of suitable mouse models has prohibited investigation of the role played by Tp53 mutations in mediating CaP progression in vivo. Here, we describe the effects of conditional expression of a mutant Tp53 (Tp53(R270H); equivalent to the human hotspot mutant R273H) in the prostate epithelium of mice. Heterozygous \"Tp53(LSL-R270H/+)\" [129S4(Trp53(tm3Tyj))] and \"Nkx3.1-Cre\" [129S(Nkx3-1(tm3(cre)Mms))] mice with prostate-specific expression of the Tp53(R270H) mutation (p53(R270H/+) Nkx3.1-Cre mice) were bred onto an FVB/N background via speed congenesis to produce strain FVB.129S4(Trp53(tm3Tyj/wt)); FVB.129S(Nkx3-1(tm3(cre)Mms/wt)) and littermate genotype negative control mice. These mutant mice had significantly increased incidences of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions, and these appeared earlier, compared with the Nkx3.1 haploinsufficient (Nkx3.1-Cre het) littermate mice, which did not express the Tp53 mutation. PIN lesions in these mice showed consistent progression and some developed into invasive adenocarcinoma with a high grade, sarcomatoid or epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype. PIN lesions were similar to those seen in PTEN conditional knockout mice, with evidence of AKT activation concomitant with neoplastic proliferation. However, the invasive tumor phenotype is rarely seen in previously described mouse models of prostatic neoplasia. These data indicate that the Tp53(R270H) mutation plays a role in CaP initiation. This finding has not previously been reported.

It has been reported that PTEN, an important tumour suppressor, is regulated by multiple miRNAs. Thus, in this study we focused on the expression and significance of miR-21 in gastric cancer tissues, and the role of miR-21 in the biological behaviour and the expression of PTEN in gastric cancer cells. Real-time PCR was used to detect miR-21 expression in gastric cancer tissues, the adjacent normal tissues, and the gastric cell lines. The gastric cancer cell line BGC-823 was transfected with pre-miR-21/miR-21 inhibitor to overexpress/downregulate miR-21. The influence of miR-21 on the biological behaviour of gastric cancer cells was evaluated using the CCK-8 kit, FCMs, the scratch healing assay and the transwell test. Western blotting and the Luciferase Reporter Assay were used to evaluate the change of PTEN expression after lowered expression of miR-21 in gastric cancer cell lines. Real-time PCR analysis indicated that miR-21 exhibited higher expression in gastric cancer tissues compared to the adjacent non-tumor tissues. miR-21 expression was significantly associated with the degree of differentiation of the tumour tissues (P=0.004), as well as local invasion and lymph node metastasis (P<0.01). After transfection, pre-miR21 BGC-823 cells grew faster than the negative and control groups (P<0.01). The reduction in miR-21 expression demonstrated a remarkable effect on the biological behaviour of gastric cancer cells (P<0.05); the pre-miR-21-transfected cells healed more quickly compared to the control cells in the scratch healing assay, whereas the transwell test indicated that cell migration in vitro was notably inhibited with the downregulation of miR-21 (P<0.05). The western blot results and Luciferase Reporter Assay demonstrated that PTEN expression was remarkably increased after miR-21 inhibition (P<0.05). microRNA-21 expression was upregulated in gastric carcinoma tissues and was significantly associated with the degree of differentiation of tumour tissues, local invasion and lymph node metastasis. Overexpression of miR-21 promoted BGC-823 cell growth, invasion and cell migration in vitro, whereas downregulation of miR-21 exhibited a stronger inhibitory effect on the biological behaviour of gastric cancer cells; additionally, miR-21 inhibition may upregulate the PTEN expression level, which indicates that PTEN may be a target gene for gastric cancer initiation and development.",

In the CAF, we show that BMP2 or BMP7, but not transforming growth factor beta-1, can strikingly stimulate secretion of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), also known as CXCL12. The CAF cells express type I and type II BMP receptors as well as the receptor for SDF-1, CXCR4. SDF-1 activation is associated with BMP-induced Smad phosphorylation, and the stimulatory effect is blocked by BMP antagonist, noggin. The findings that BMP treatment can increase SDF-1 pre-mRNA levels in a time-dependent manner and actinomycin D treatment can abolish stimulatory effect of BMP suggest a transcriptional modulation of SDF-1 by BMP signaling. Using a human microvascular endothelial cell line, we show that SDF-1 present in the conditioned medium from the stimulated CAF can significantly induce tube formation, an effect relating to angiogenic function. Furthermore, we found that BMP2 can also protect the CAF from serum starvation-induced apoptosis independent of SDF-1, implying that BMP may induce other factors to sustain the survival of these cells. In short, this report establishes a novel BMP-SDF-1 axis in the prostate tumor along with a new prosurvival effect of BMP that when considered together with our previously described oncogenic properties of BMP indicate a circuitry for heterotypic cell interactions potentially critical in prostate cancer.",

An optimized procedure was developed for AlDH histochemistry. Frozen sections were preincubated in nitroblue tetrazolium/acetone and then incubated at 20 degrees C in viscous polyvinyl alcohol media containing buffer, phenazine methosulfate, sodium azide, substrate, coenzyme, and nitroblue tetrazolium. Background activity was evaluated by omission of substrate. Activity was quantitated by computer-assisted microscopic photometry. All five carcinomas had heterogeneous staining of NADP- and NAD-dependent BzDH and AcDH activity, with clusters of very high-activity cells. The magnitude of staining in the high-activity neoplastic cells was at least tenfold greater for BzDH-NADP and about twofold greater for BzDH-NAD, AcDH-NADP, and AcDH-NAD than the staining in other liver cells.

Inter-individual variability in treatment response and prognosis has been associated with genetic polymorphisms in specific genes: EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PTEN and TTF-1. Somatic mutations in EGFR and KRAS genes are reported at rates of 15-40% in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in ethnically diverse populations. BRAF and PTEN are commonly mutated genes in various cancer types, including NSCLC, with PTEN mutations exerting an effect on the therapeutic response of EGFR/AKT/PI3K pathway inhibitors. TTF-1 is expressed in approximately 80% of lung adenocarcinomas and its positivity correlates with higher prevalence of EGFR mutation in this cancer type. To determine molecular markers for lung cancer in Brazilian patients, the rate of the predominant EGFR, KRAS, BRAF and PTEN mutations, as well as TTF-1 expression, was assessed in 88 Brazilian NSCLC patients. EGFR exon 19 deletions (del746-750) were detected in 3/88 (3·4%) patients. Activating KRAS mutations in codons 12 and 61 were noted in five (5·7%) and two (2·3%) patients, respectively. None of the common somatic mutations were detected in either the BRAF or PTEN genes. TTF-1 was overexpressed in 40·7% of squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC).

Since HDAC6 is involved in aggresome formation, which is recognized as a cytoprotective response serving to sequester misfolded proteins and facilitate their clearance by autophagy, we further investigated the combined effect of vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA)), which has a potent inhibitory effect for HDAC6, with CAM and BZ in breast cancer cell lines. SAHA exhibited some cytotoxicity along with an increased acetylation level of α-tubulin, a substrate of HDAC6. Combined treatment of SAHA, CAM, and BZ potently enhanced the apoptosis-inducing effect compared with treatment using each reagent alone or a combination of two of the three. Expression levels of ER-stress-related genes, including the pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP (GADD153), were maximally induced by the simultaneous combination of three reagents. Like breast cancer cell lines, a wild-type murine embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity and maximally up-regulated Chop after combined treatment with SAHA, CAM, and BZ; however, a Chop knockout MEF cell line almost completely canceled this enhanced effect.

        "Doc_abstract":"Based on next-generation sequencing of early-onset prostate cancer (PCa), we earlier demonstrated that PCa in young patients is prone to rearrangements involving androgen-regulated genes-such as transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2)-v-ets avian erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog (ERG) fusion-and provided data suggesting that this situation might be caused by increased androgen signaling in younger men. In the same study, an accumulation of chromosomal deletions was found in cancers of elderly patients. To determine how age-dependent molecular features relate to cancer phenotype, an existing data set of 11,152 PCas was expanded by additional fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), 6q15 and 5q21. The results demonstrate that the decrease in TMPRSS2-ERG fusions with increasing patient age is limited to low-grade cancers (Gleason ≤3+4) and that the significant increase in the deletion frequency with age was strictly limited to ERG-negative cancers for 6q15 and 5q21 but to ERG-positive cancers for PTEN. These data suggest that the accumulation of non-androgen-linked genomic alterations with advanced patient age may require an appropriate microenvironment, such as a positive or negative ERG status. The strong link of ERG activation to young patient age and low-grade cancers may help to explain a slight predominance of low-grade cancers in young patients.",

However, targeting of the IL-6/STAT3 axis in PCa patients has failed to provide therapeutic benefit. Here we show that genetic inactivation of Stat3 or IL-6 signalling in a Pten-deficient PCa mouse model accelerates cancer progression leading to metastasis. Mechanistically, we identify p19(ARF) as a direct Stat3 target. Loss of Stat3 signalling disrupts the ARF-Mdm2-p53 tumour suppressor axis bypassing senescence. Strikingly, we also identify STAT3 and CDKN2A mutations in primary human PCa. STAT3 and CDKN2A deletions co-occurred with high frequency in PCa metastases. In accordance, loss of STAT3 and p14(ARF) expression in patient tumours correlates with increased risk of disease recurrence and metastatic PCa. Thus, STAT3 and ARF may be prognostic markers to stratify high from low risk PCa patients. Our findings challenge the current discussion on therapeutic benefit or risk of IL-6/STAT3 inhibition. ",

However, published PCa diagnostic markers share little overlap and are poorly validated using independent data. Therefore, we here developed an integrative proteomics and interaction network-based classifier by combining the differential protein expression with topological features of human protein interaction networks to enhance the ability of PCa diagnosis.;By two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) coupled with MS using PCa and adjacent benign tissues of prostate, a total of 60 proteins with the differential expression in PCa tissues were identified as the candidate markers. Then, their networks were analyzed by GeneGO Meta-Core software and three hub proteins (PTEN, SFPQ and HDAC1) were chosen. After that, a PCa diagnostic classifier was constructed by support vector machine (SVM) modeling based on the microarray gene expression data of the genes which encode the hub proteins mentioned above. Validations of diagnostic performance showed that this classifier had high predictive accuracy (85.96∼90.18%) and area under ROC curve (approximating 1.0). Furthermore, the clinical significance of PTEN, SFPQ and HDAC1 proteins in PCa was validated by both ELISA and immunohistochemistry analyses. More interestingly, PTEN protein was identified as an independent prognostic marker for biochemical recurrence-free survival in PCa patients according to the multivariate analysis by Cox Regression.;Our data indicated that the integrative proteomics and interaction network-based classifier which combines the differential protein expression and topological features of human protein interaction network may be a powerful tool for the diagnosis of PCa.

Nelfinavir (NFV) is an HIV protease inhibitor that induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in cancer cells. Under conditions of ER stress, misfolded proteins are transported from the ER back to the cytosol for subsequent degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Bortezomib (BZ) is a proteasome inhibitor and interferes with degradation of misfolded proteins. Here, we show that NFV and BZ enhance proteotoxicity in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and multiple myeloma (MM) cells. The combination synergistically inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell death. Activating transcription factor (ATF)3 and CCAAT-enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), markers of ER stress, were rapidly increased, and their siRNA-mediated knockdown inhibited cell death. Knockdown of double-stranded RNA activated protein kinase-like ER kinase, a signal transducer in ER stress, significantly decreased apoptosis. Pretreatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, decreased levels of ubiquitinated proteins, ATF3, CHOP, and the overall total cell death, suggesting that inhibition of protein synthesis increases cell survival by relieving proteotoxic stress. The NFV/BZ combination inhibited the growth of NSCLC xenografts, which correlated with the induction of markers of ER stress and apoptosis. Collectively, these data show that NFV and BZ enhance proteotoxicity in NSCLC and MM cells, and suggest that this combination could tip the precarious balance of protein homeostasis in cancer cells for therapeutic gain.",

Tyr176-phosphorylated AKT localizes to the plasma membrane and promotes Thr308/Ser473-phosphorylation leading to AKT activation. Mice expressing activated Ack1 specifically in the prostate exhibit AKT Tyr176-phosphorylation and develop murine prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPINs). Further, expression levels of Tyr176-phosphorylated-AKT and Tyr284-phosphorylated-Ack1 were positively correlated with the severity of disease progression, and inversely correlated with the survival of breast cancer patients.

Previous studies suggest that PTEN suppresses tumor formation by acting as a phosphoinositide phosphatase to limit signaling by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Here, we examined the effect of deleting various regulatory subunits of PI3K (p85alpha and p85beta) on epithelial neoplasia and lymphoid hyperplasia in PTEN+/- mice. Interestingly, we found the loss of one p85alpha allele with or without the loss of p85beta led to increased incidence of intestinal polyps. Signaling downstream of PI3K was enhanced in the PTEN+/-p85alpha+/-p85beta-/- polyps, as judged by an increased fraction of both cells with cytoplasmic staining of the transcription factor FKHR and cells with positive staining for the proliferation marker Ki-67. In contrast, the incidence of prostate intraepithelial neoplasia was not significantly altered in PTEN+/- mice heterozygous for p85alpha or null for p85beta, whereas the fraction of proliferating cells in prostate intraepithelial neoplasia was reduced in mice lacking p85beta. Finally, there was no significant change in T lymphocyte hyperplasia in the PTEN+/- mice with various p85 deletions, although anti-CD3-stimulated AKT activation was somewhat reduced in the p85alpha+/- background. These results indicate that decreasing the levels of different p85 regulatory subunits can result in enhanced PI3K signaling in some tissues and decreased PI3K signaling in others, supporting the model that, although p85 proteins are essential for class I(A) PI3K signaling, they can function as inhibitors of PI3K signaling in some tissues and thus suppress tumor formation.",

Here we show that SLUG is a major regulator of mesenchymal differentiation. As microRNAs (miRs) are pleiotropic regulators of differentiation and tumorigenesis, we evaluated miR expression associated with tumorigenesis and EMT. Mir-1 and miR-200 were reduced with progression of prostate adenocarcinoma, and we identify Slug as one of the phylogenetically conserved targets of these miRs. We demonstrate that SLUG is a direct repressor of miR-1 and miR-200 transcription. Thus, SLUG and miR-1/miR-200 act in a self-reinforcing regulatory loop, leading to amplification of EMT. Depletion of Slug inhibited EMT during tumorigenesis, whereas forced expression of miR-1 or miR-200 inhibited both EMT and tumorigenesis in human and mouse model systems.

The activity of ILK is constitutively elevated in a serum-independent manner in PTEN mutant cells, and transfection of wild-type PTEN under the control of an inducible promoter into mutant PTEN cells inhibits ILK activity. Transfection of ILK antisense (ILKAS) or exposure to a small-molecule ILK inhibitor suppresses the constitutive phosphorylation of PKB/Akt on Ser-473 in PTEN-mutant glioblastoma cell lines. In addition, the delivery of ILKAS to PTEN-negative glioblastoma cells resulted in apoptosis. Rag-2M mice bearing established ( approximately 100 mg) human U87MG glioblastoma tumors, treated QD x 5 for 3 consecutive weeks with ILKAS (i.p. 5 mg/kg), exhibited stable disease with < or =7% increase in tumor volume over the 3-week course of treatment. In contrast, animals treated with an oligonucleotide control or saline exhibited a >100% increase in tumor volume over the same time period. Our initial results indicate that therapeutic strategies targeting ILK may be beneficial in the treatment of glioblastomas.",

PTEN is an inhibitor of PI3K, and its loss or mutation is common in human prostate cancer. But the direct role and mechanism of PI3K/PTEN signaling in regulating angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo remain to be elucidated. In this study, by using chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and in nude mice models, we demonstrated that inhibition of PI3K activity by LY294002 decreased PC-3 cells-induced angiogenesis. Reconstitution of PTEN, the molecular inhibitor of PI3K in PC-3 cells inhibited angiogenesis and tumor growth. Immunohistochemical staining indicated that PTEN expression suppressed HIF-1alpha, VEGF and PCNA expression in the tumor xenographs. Similarly, expression of AKT dominant negative mutant also inhibited angiogenesis and tumor growth, and decreased the expression of HIF-1alpha and VEGF in the tumor xenographs. These results suggest that inhibition of PI3K signaling pathway by PTEN inhibits tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth. In addition, we found that AKT is the downstream target of PI3K in controlling angiogenesis and tumor growth, and PTEN could inhibit angiogenesis by regulating the expression of HIF-1 and VEGF expression through AKT activation in PC-3 cells.",

Analysis of the N-terminal sequence of the NEP cytosolic domain (N-terminal MGKSESQMDI TDINTPKPKK KQRWTR) identified a myristoylation consensus site. Mutation of Gly-2 to Arg significantly decreased (3)H-myristoylation activity, and correlated with translocation of NEP from the plasma membrane to a perinuclear domain as demonstrated by immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting with an NEP-specific antibody. Removal of this myristoylation residue did not affect NEP enzymatic specific activity. Myristoylated NEP recruited more PTEN protein to the cell membrane fraction than unmyristoylated NEP.

Although miR-338-3p has been implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma, its role in gastric cancer is unknown. To this end, we report that miR-338-3p is downregulated in both gastric cancer tissue and cell lines. Forced expression of miR-338-3p inhibited cell proliferation and clonogenicity and induced a G1-S arrest as well as apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, P-Rex2a (PREX2) was identified as a direct target of miR-338-3p, and silencing P-Rex2a resulted in the same biologic effects of miR-338-3p expression in gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, both enforced expression of miR-338-3p or silencing of P-Rex2a resulted in activation of PTEN, leading to a decline in AKT phosphorylation. Also, miR-338-3p markedly inhibited the in vivo tumorigenicity in a nude mouse xenograft model system. These results demonstrate that miR-338-3p affects gastric cancer progression through PTEN-AKT signaling by targeting P-Rex2a in gastric cancer cells, which posits miR-338-3p as a novel strategy for gastric cancer treatment.;miR-338-3p acts as a novel tumor suppressor that blocks the growth of gastric cancer cells through PTEN-PI3K signaling by targeting P-Rex2a.",

Total numbers of 60 histopathologically confirmed cases of squamous cell carcinoma and 15 cases of inflammatory lesion of oral specimens were studied. We assessed PTEN and bcl2 overexpression by the use of anti-PTEN and anti-bcl2 antibody through immunohistochemistry as directed by the manufacturer. There was progressive loss of PTEN expression from inflammatory lesion to OSCC (p<0.05). Significant differences were found for PTEN expression between inflammatory lesion and OSCC. The difference in expression pattern of PTEN in gender did not reach statistical significance (p>0.05). The expression of bcl2 was found to be restricted to tumor cells in well and moderately differentiated tumors. The intense expression of bcl2 was observed throughout the tumor cell in poorly differentiated tumors.

Mutation of T308 and S473 of Akt to alanine as well as the inhibition or depletion of upstream kinases for Akt activation blocked Akt degradation. These features of Akt degradation are reminiscent of the 'activation-induced suicidal degradation' mechanism. PTEN was also required for Akt destabilization as Akt activation alone was unable to elicit Akt degradation in the absence of PTEN. Conversely, PTEN introduction in PTEN-null prostate cancer cells restored the ability to degrade Akt upon selenium treatment. Collectively, selenium seems to achieve ultimate negative regulation of Akt signaling by destabilizing the protein, and this regulation mechanism might provide a paradigm for the anti-cancer activity of selenium.",

In order to discover potential therapeutic targets, we aimed to discover deregulated signalling pathways in human BLCs.;In this study, we focused on the oncogenic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway in 13 BLCs, and compared it with a control series of 11 hormonal receptor negative- and grade III-matched HER2+ carcinomas. The two tumour populations were first characterised by immunohistochemistry and gene expression. The PI3K pathway was then investigated by gene copy-number analysis, gene expression profiling and at a proteomic level using reverse-phase protein array technology and tissue microarray. The effects of the PI3K inhibition pathway on proliferation and apoptosis was further analysed in three human basal-like cell lines.;The PI3K pathway was found to be activated in BLCs and up-regulated compared with HER2+ tumours as shown by a significantly increased activation of the downstream targets Akt and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). BLCs expressed significantly lower levels of the tumour suppressor PTEN and PTEN levels were significantly negatively correlated with Akt activity within that population. PTEN protein expression correlated significantly with PTEN DNA copy number and more importantly, reduced PTEN DNA copy numbers were observed specifically in BLCs. Similar to human samples, basal-like cell lines exhibited an activation of PI3K/Akt pathway and low/lack PTEN expression. Both PI3K and mTOR inhibitors led to basal-like cell growth arrest. However, apoptosis was specifically observed after PI3K inhibition.;These data provide insight into the molecular pathogenesis of BLCs and implicate the PTEN-dependent activated Akt signalling pathway as a potential therapeutic target for the management of patients with poor prognosis BLCs.",

The vault has been shown to affect multidrug resistance in cancer cells, and one particular component, MVP, is thought to play a role in the transport of drug from the nucleus. To locate the position of the vRNA, vaults were treated with RNases, and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) was performed on the resulting complexes. Using single-particle reconstruction techniques, 3,476 particle images were combined to generate a 22-A-resolution structure. Difference mapping between the RNase-treated vault and the previously calculated intact vault reconstructions reveals the vRNA to be at the ends of the vault caps. In this position, the vRNA may interact with both the interior and exterior environments of the vault.

Both stoichiometric considerations and the finding of higher resolution for the computationally selected and refined \"barrel only\" images indicate a possible symmetry mismatch between the barrel and the caps. The molecular architecture of the complex is emerging, with 96 copies of MVP composing the eightfold symmetric barrel, and the vRNA together with one copy of TEP1 and four predicted copies of VPARP comprising each cap.",

According to the 'two-hit' tumour-suppressor gene concept, inactivation occurs by any combination of the following three pathogenetic processes: mutation, loss of one allele [i.e. loss of heterozygosity (LOH)] or promoter methylation. To determine the frequencies of PTEN tumour-suppressor gene features in colorectal carcinoma, we used DNA from colorectal carcinoma xenografts/primary tumour cell lines (N=22) or neoplastic glands isolated by laser-capture microdissection (N=20). Sequencing exons 1-9 of the gene revealed a total of 8 somatic mutations in 5 tumours (3 with high-degree microsatellite instability). In 1 tumour, a truncating mutation of one allele was combined with two missense mutations of the other allele. Polymorphic microsatellite marker analyses (D10S5412, D10S579 and D10S1765) showed complete loss of one allele (i.e. LOH sensu stricto) in 3 tumours, but combined LOH and mutation was found only once. Promoter methylation, tested by MethyLight technology, was found in only 1 of the tumours, not combined with mutation or LOH. In contrast, by immunohistochemistry (mAb 6H2.1), reduction or even loss of PTEN expression was found in 18 tumours. Taken together, PTEN downregulation is a fairly frequent event in colorectal carcinoma, but this apparently is not usually caused by two hits on the gene.",

Case-control studies containing available genotype frequencies of the NPAS2 polymorphisms were chosen. The odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to assess the strength of association. Eight independent case-control studies with 3,857 cancer patients and 4,525 cancer-free controls were selected for this meta-analysis. Two NPAS2 gene polymorphisms were identified (rs2305160 and rs17024926). The results showed statistically significant associations of rs2305160 with cancer risk (AA+GA vs. GG: OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.72-0.98, P = 0.02; AG vs. GG: OR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.68-0.96, P = 0.02).

Although there are a few reports about PTEN related to hepatocellular carcinoma, the role of PTEN in the liver remains unclear. Therefore, to clarify the role of PTEN in the liver, we generated and analyzed hepatocyte-specific Pten-deficient mice (Pten-deficient mice). The liver of 40-week-old Pten-deficient mice revealed macrovesicular steatosis, ballooning hepatocytes, lobular inflammatory cell infiltration, and perisinusoidal fibrosis that are characteristic of human nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). By 80 weeks of age, 100% of Pten-deficient livers showed adenomas and 66% had hepatocellular carcinomas. Thus, PTEN is important for the prevention of adipogenic and tumorigenic transformation, and Pten-deficient mice are a novel model for NASH and hepatocellular carcinoma. Our results suggest that the controlled blocking of molecules acting downstream of PI3K might provide significant therapeutic benefit to patients predisposed to NASH and hepatocellular carcinoma.",

In recent years, application of CO2 laser resection in the treatment of stage T1 glottic carcinoma can remove the tumor completely and reduce the injury of laryngeal tissues. But recurrence still happened in some postoperative patients. Here, we selected 131 patients to compare the therapeutic effects of CO2 laser resection and traditional split laryngeal surgery on the early laryngeal cancer, examined the expression of p27 and PTEN by immunohistochemistry in early laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma tissues in correlation to clinical outcome. After two years follow-up 14/85 (16.5%) of CO2 laser treatment group presented with local recurrence (recurrent group), while that of split laryngeal surgery group was 6/46 (13.0%). There was no statistical significance in recurrence rate between the two groups (P>0.05). 10 of all the 111 (9.0%) non-recurrent patients did not follow the doctor's advice to quit smoking after the operation, while 12 in the 20 (60.0%) recurrent patients did not; the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P<0.01). The positive rates of p27 were 80.2% (105/131) and 43.5% (57/131), and that of PTEN were 83.2% (109/131) and 48.9% (64/131) in the cancer adjacent tissues (negative surgical margin tissues) and in laryngeal carcinoma tissues, respectively (P<0.001). The expression rates of p27 and PTEN in laryngeal carcinoma tissues of the recurrent group were 20.0% (4/20), 10.0% (2/20) and that in non recurrent group were 47.7% (53/111) and 55.9% (62/111), respectively, with a significant difference (P<0.001). In addition, the expression of p27 and PTEN in tumor resected marginal tissues of the recurrence group was 50.0% (10/20), 40.0% (8/20) and that in non recurrence group was 85.6% (95/111) and 91.0% (101/111), respectively; the difference was also statistically significant between both groups (P<0.001). In conclusion, there is no statistically significant difference in tumor recurrence rate between CO2 laser surgery and traditional split laryngeal surgery.

The LOH analysis was performed by amplifying DNA by PCR, using five markers of the 10q23 region (D10S1687, D10S541, D10S2491, D10S583 and D10S571).

        "Doc_abstract":"Prostate cancer (PCa) is a clinically heterogeneous disease and current treatment strategies are based largely on anatomical and pathological parameters. In the recent past, several DNA sequencing studies of primary and advanced PCa have revealed recurrent patterns of genomic aberrations that expose mechanisms of resistance to available therapies and potential new drug targets. Suppression of androgen receptor (AR) signalling is the cornerstone of advanced prostate cancer treatment. Genomic aberrations of the androgen receptor or alternative splicing of its mRNA are increasingly recognised as biomarkers of resistance to AR-targeted therapies such as abiraterone or enzalutamide. Genomic aberrations of the PI3K-AKT axis, in particular affecting PTEN, are common in PCa, and compounds targeting different kinases in this pathway are showing promise in clinical trials. Both germline and somatic defects in DNA repair genes have been shown to sensitise some patients to therapy with PARP inhibition. In addition, abnormalities in mismatch-repair genes are associated with response to immune checkpoint inhibition in other solid tumours and present a tantalising therapeutic avenue to be pursued. Aberrations in CDK4/6-RB1 pathway genes occur in a subset of PCas, may associate with differential sensitivity to treatment, and are likely to have clinical implications beyond prognostication. Inhibitors of CDK4/6 are already being tested in prostate cancer clinical trials. Furthermore, deletions of RB1 are strongly associated with a neuroendocrine phenotype, a rare condition characterized by a non-AR-driven transcriptomic profile. Finally, aberrations in genes involved in regulating the chromatin structure are an emerging area of interest. Deletions of CHD1 are not infrequent in PCa and may associate with increased AR activity and genomic instability, and these tumours could benefit from DNA-damaging therapies. This review summarises how genomic discoveries in PCa are changing the treatment landscape of advanced CRPC, both by identifying biomarkers of resistance and by identifying vulnerabilities to be targeted.

PCR products were then sequenced for mutation screening. And we also proved the effect of mutations on the expression of PTEN protein by immunohistochemistry.;PTEN mutations were detected in 11 of 50 (22%) breast cancers and 4 of 50 (8%) adjacent ductal hyperplasia, all of which were atypical ductal hyperplasia and same PTEN mutation were detected in the corresponding cancer tissues. No PTEN mutation was detected in all adjacent normal breast tissues and 50 cases of breast benign lesions. The mutation sites concentrated at exon 3, 4, 5 and 7; no mutation was detected in exon 1, 2, 6, 8, or 9 and splicing sites of all introns.

That is why there is need to define new factors that could be not only diagnostic but also predictve factors. In present study we analyzed the mRNA PTEN expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) in 123 women of endometrial carcinoma and 14 women of control group. Moreover we assessed oestrogen (ER) and progesterone receptors (PgR) in all cases. We defined the correlation between expression of PTEN gene and receptors and between PTEN expression and maturity grade of cancer. Neoplasm advancement grade G1 was diagnosed in 82.11% of patients (n = 101), G2 in 9.76% of patients (n = 12) and G3 in 8.13% of patients (n = 10). Presence of ER and PgR and decreased expression of PTEN gene was found in majority of patients with endometrial cancer (79.12% and 59.34% respectively) and the most numerous group was with weak expression of ER and strong expression of PgR. There was no statistically significant difference in gene expression depending on receptors expression nor maturity grade of cancer (p > 0.05). Evaluation of expression of PTEN gene may turn out to be a very useful tool aimed at qualifying patients for different therapies of endometrial cancer and at searching of new diagnostic and therapeutic methods of this cancer independently on its receptor status nor maturity grade of cancer.",

Deficient PTEN expression leads to activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt (pAkt) signaling pathway, which may contribute to multiple human cancers. The relation between PTEN expression and Akt activation is still unclear in colorectal cancers and adenomatous polyps. Moreover, PTEN and pAkt expression in relation to demographic, tumoral, and outcome variables remains to be elucidated.;PTEN and pAkt expression were evaluated in 76 primary colorectal cancers and 25 adenomatous colorectal polyp tissues using immunohistochemical staining on paraffin-embedded sections. PTEN and pAkt expression were compared with clinicopathologic features of colorectal cancers. The relationship between PTEN and pAkt expression was also investigated.;In colorectal cancers, pAkt expression was found to be significantly higher than polyps (P = .007). On the other hand, PTEN expression was significantly lower in polyps (P <.0001). In colorectal cancer patients, PTEN expression showed a negative correlation with young age, female sex, and left-sided (distal) tumors. On multivariate analysis, low PTEN expression (PTEN loss) was noted as an independent parameter for local recurrence (P = .024). There was significant association between pAkt expression and stage (P = .008), and preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels (P = .017) in colorectal cancers. A negative correlation between PTEN and pAkt expression was found in colon cancer patients (P = .010), whereas no significiant association was found in adenomatous polyps (P = .403). No correlation of PTEN expression or pAkt expression was observed in Kaplan-Meier survival statistics and multivariate analyses for disease-free and overall survival.;The current study suggests that the PTEN loss-PI3K/pAkt pathway may play an important role in sporadic colon carcinogenesis and that reduced PTEN expression may predict relapse in colorectal cancer patients.",

The lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN antagonizes the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR pathway to repress tumor cell growth and survival. In the nucleus, PTEN promotes chromosome stability and DNA repair. Consequently, loss of PTEN function increases genomic instability. PTEN deficiency is caused by inherited germline mutations, somatic mutations, epigenetic and transcriptional silencing, post-translational modifications, and protein-protein interactions. Given the high frequency of PTEN deficiency across cancer subtypes, therapeutic approaches that exploit PTEN loss-of-function could provide effective treatment strategies. Herein, we discuss therapeutic strategies aimed at cancers with loss of PTEN function, and the challenges involved in treating patients afflicted with such cancers. We review preclinical and clinical findings, and highlight novel strategies under development to target PTENdeficient cancers. ",

Because the mutation frequency is similar in CAH and UEC, Pten mutations are thought to occur relatively early in endometrial tumorigenesis. Previous work from our laboratory using the Pten(+/-) mouse model has demonstrated somatic inactivation of the wild type allele of Pten in both CAH and UEC. In the present study, we injected adenoviruses expressing Cre into the uterine lumen of adult Pten floxed mice in an attempt to somatically delete both alleles of Pten specifically in the endometrium. Our results demonstrate that biallelic inactivation of Pten results in an increased incidence of carcinoma as compared to the Pten(+/-) mouse model. In addition, the carcinomas were more aggressive with extension beyond the uterus into adjacent tissues and were associated with decreased expression of nuclear ERα as compared to associated CAH. Primary cultures of epithelial and stromal cells were prepared from uteri of Pten floxed mice and Pten was deleted in vitro using Cre expressing adenovirus. Pten deletion was evident in both the epithelial and stromal cells and the treatment of the primary cultures with estrogen had different effects on Akt activation as well as Cyclin D3 expression in the two purified components. This study demonstrates that somatic biallelic inactivation of Pten in endometrial epithelium in vivo results in an increased incidence and aggressiveness of endometrial carcinoma compared to mice carrying a germline deletion of one allele and provides an important in vivo and in vitro model system for understanding the genetic underpinnings of endometrial carcinoma.",

We have previously described a rapid (3-5 min) and P2X7-dependent depletion of nuclear phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) and effects on downstream targets, and here we studied mechanisms behind the pAkt depletion. We show that cholesterol-lowering drugs, statins, or extracellular ATP, induced a complex and coordinated response in insulin-stimulated A549 cells leading to depletion of nuclear pAkt. It involved protein/lipid phosphatases PTEN, pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat phosphatase (PHLPP1 and -2), protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and calcineurin. We employed immunocytology, immunoprecipitation, and proximity ligation assay techniques and show that PHLPP and calcineurin translocated to the nucleus and formed complexes with Akt within 3 min. Also PTEN translocated to the nucleus and then co-localized with pAkt close to the nuclear membrane. An inhibitor of the scaffolding immunophilin FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51) and calcineurin, FK506, prevented depletion of nuclear pAkt. Furthermore, okadaic acid, an inhibitor of PP2A, prevented the nuclear pAkt depletion. Chemical inhibition and siRNA indicated that PHLPP, PP2A, and PTEN were required for a robust depletion of nuclear pAkt, and in prostate cancer cells lacking PTEN, transfection of PTEN restored the statin-induced pAkt depletion. The activation of protein and lipid phosphatases was paralleled by a rapid proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) translocation to the nucleus, a PCNA-p21(cip1) complex formation, and cyclin D1 degradation. We conclude that these effects reflect a signaling pathway for rapid depletion of pAkt that may stop the cell cycle.",

The molecular mechanism underlying INPP4B's tumor-suppressive role is currently unknown. Here, we demonstrate that INPP4B restrains tumor development by dephosphorylating the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 that accumulates in situations of PTEN deficiency. In vitro, INPP4B directly dephosphorylates PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. In vivo, neither inactivation of Inpp4b (Inpp4b(Δ/Δ)) nor heterozygous deletion of Pten (Pten(+/-)) in mice causes thyroid abnormalities, but a combination of these mutations induces malignant thyroid cancers with lung metastases. At the molecular level, simultaneous deletion of Inpp4b and Pten synergistically increases PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels and activates AKT downstream signaling proteins in thyroid cells. We propose that the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 phosphatase activity of INPP4B can function as a \"back-up\" mechanism when PTEN is deficient, making INPP4B a potential novel therapeutic target for PTEN-deficient or PIK3CA-activated cancers.;Although INPP4B expression is reduced in several types of human cancers, our work on Inpp4B-deficient mice provides the first evidence that INPP4B is a bona fide tumor suppressor whose function is particularly important in situations of PTEN deficiency.

        "Doc_abstract":"Several recent advances have been made in our understanding of the pathogenesis of endometrial tumours, particularly endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (EEC). Mutations in the PTEN gene and microsatellite instability (MSI) are common genetic abnormalities in EECs, and distinguish these lesions from other histological subtypes of endometrial carcinoma. Endometrial precancers are monoclonal lesions that share a common genetic lineage with invasive EEC, including PTEN mutations and MSI. Mutations of the PTEN tumour suppressor gene have been identified in histologically normal-appearing endometrium exposed to oestrogen, 18-55% of endometrial precancers and 26-80% of EECs. PTEN has been shown to play several roles in tumour suppression, including cell cycle arrest and promotion of apoptosis. Loss of PTEN function predisposes endometrial cells to neoplastic transformation, particularly in high-oestrogenic states. MSI is another common alteration seen in EECs and endometrial precancers, and some studies have reported an association between MSI and PTEN mutations. The replication error that results in MSI may facilitate the development of PTEN mutations in some, but not all, cases of EEC. The prognostic significance of PTEN gene mutations and MSI in endometrial carcinoma is controversial. Further study is needed to delineate the different pathogenetic pathways of EEC and their natural history.",

This enzyme is highly active in most cancer cells, but is inactive in most somatic cells. This striking observation led to the suggestion that telomerase might be important for the continued growth or progression of cancer cells. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of telomerase activation in cancer cells. Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTRT) has recently been identified as a putative human telomerase catalytic subunit. We transfected the gene encoding hTRT into telomerase-negative human normal fibroblast cells and demonstrated that expression of wild-type hTRT induces telomerase activity, whereas hTRT mutants containing mutations in regions conserved among other reverse transcriptases did not. Hepatocellular carcinoma (20 samples) and non-cancerous liver tissues (19 samples) were examined for telomerase activity and expression of hTRT, the human telomerase RNA component (hTR; encoded by TERC) and the human telomerase-associated protein (hTLP1; encoded by TEP1). A significant correlation between hTRT expression and telomerase activity was observed. These results indicate that the hTRT protein is the catalytic subunit of human telomerase, and that it plays a key role in the activation of telomerase in cancer cells.",

The expressions of PTEN and MMP-7, and MVD were compared with the clinicopathological parameters of tumors, and the relationship between PTEN and MMP-7 expression and MVD was analyzed. It was found that PTEN was expressed less frequently in primary gastric carcinoma cells than in adjacent epithelial cells (P < 0.05), whereas this was reversed for MMP-7 (P < 0.05). PTEN expression was negatively correlated with invasion, metastasis, growth pattern, Lauren's classification and histological classification (P < 0.05). Matrix metalloproteinase-7 expression was positively associated with tumor size, Borrmann's classification, invasive depth, metastasis and TNM staging (P < 0.05), but negative with PTEN expression (P < 0.05). A positive correlation of MVD with tumor size, invasive depth, metastasis and TNM staging was found (P < 0.05). Microvessel density depended on decreased PTEN expression and increased MMP-7 expression (P < 0.05). The results of the present study suggested that down-regulated PTEN expression and up-regulated MMP-7 expression were greatly implicated in tumorigenesis and progression of gastric carcinoma.

In addition, the current study identified phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) as a target of miR‑337 using computational analysis and a luciferase assay. EC cells transfected with miR‑337 mimics and anti‑PTEN small interfering RNA demonstrated significantly decreased expression of PTEN, markedly increased proliferation and inhibition of cell apoptosis.

They result from loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for the PTEN gene on chromosome 10q23. Previous studies reported that various drugs, chemicals, and foods can up-regulate PTEN mRNA and protein expression in different cell lines, and they may be useful in the future prevention and/or treatment of these cancers. PTEN has also been observed to have prognostic significance and is gradually being accepted as an independent prognostic factor. This will help in monitoring disease progression and/or recurrence, with a view to improving treatment outcomes and reducing the associated morbidity and mortality from these cancers. Neprilysin (NEP) is a zinc-dependent metallopeptidase that cleaves and inactivates some biologically active peptides thus switching off signal transduction at the cell surface. Decreased NEP expression in many cancers has been reported. NEP can form a complex with PTEN and enhance PTEN recruitment to the plasma membrane as well as stabilize its phosphatase activity. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) post-transcriptionally down-regulates the expression of PTEN and stimulates growth and invasion in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (lung Ca), suggesting that this may be a potential therapeutic target in the future treatment of NSCLC.

Using TGF-beta1 transgenic mice (n=7) and wildtype littermates (n=6), as well as pancreatic tissues obtained from organ donors (n=10) and patients with pancreatic cancer (n=10), we assessed the expression of PTEN by means of immunohistochemistry and semiquantitative PCR analysis. In addition, PANC-1 cells were treated with TGF-beta1 in vitro and the levels of PTEN mRNA were determined in these cells. In human pancreatic cancers PTEN mRNA levels were significantly decreased (P<0.05). In addition, in the pancreas of TGF-beta1 transgenic mice the expression of PTEN was significantly reduced (P<0.01), as compared to wildtype littermates and incubation of PANC-1 cells with TGF-beta1 decreased PTEN mRNA levels after 24 h. Inasmuch as TGF-beta1 decreases PTEN expression in human pancreatic cancer cells and human pancreatic cancers overexpress TGF-beta1, the reduced expression of PTEN in pancreatic cancer may be mediated by TGF-beta1 overexpression.

Furthermore, targeting DNA repair defects by PARP1 inhibitors (PARPi) as a cancer treatment strategy is emerging yet requires suitable predictive biomarkers. To address these issues, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of multiple markers of DNA damage signalling, oxidative stress, DNA repair and cell cycle control pathways during progression of human prostate disease from benign hyperplasia, through intraepithelial neoplasia to CaP, complemented by genetic analyses of TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement and NQO1, an anti-oxidant factor and p53 protector. The DNA damage checkpoint barrier (γH2AX, pATM, p53) mechanism was activated during CaP tumorigenesis, albeit less and with delayed culmination compared to other cancers, possibly reflecting lower replication stress (slow proliferation despite cases of Rb loss and cyclin D1 overexpression) and progressive loss of ATM activator NKX3.1. Oxidative stress (8-oxoguanine lesions) and NQO1 increased during disease progression. NQO1 genotypes of 390 men did not indicate predisposition to CaP, yet loss of NQO1 in CaP suggested potential progression-opposing tumour suppressor role. TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement and PTEN loss, events sensitizing to PARPi, occurred frequently along with heterogeneous loss of DNA repair factors 53BP1, JMJD1C and Rev7 (all studied here for the first time in CaP) whose defects may cause resistance to PARPi.

Despite a relatively low prevalence, it accounts for a disproportionate number of thyroid cancer-related deaths, due to its resistance to any therapeutic approach.

By 9 months of age, over 75% of the compound mutant mice develop aggressive, undifferentiated thyroid tumors that evolve from pre-existing follicular hyperplasia and carcinoma. These tumors display all the features of their human counterpart, including pleomorphism, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, aneuploidy, local invasion, and distant metastases. Expression profiling of the murine ATCs reveals a significant overlap with genes found deregulated in human ATC, including genes involved in mitosis control. Furthermore, similar to the human tumors, [Pten, p53]thyr-/- tumors and cells are highly glycolytic and remarkably sensitive to glycolysis inhibitors, which synergize with standard chemotherapy.

Despite many studies in this field, the carcinogenetic events of malignant conversion in cervical tumours have not been significantly characterised. The first aim of this project was to investigate the mutation status of the tumour suppressor gene- Phosphatase and Tension Homolog (PTEN)--in cervical cancer tissue. The second aim of this study was the analysis in the same cervical cancer tissue for aberrations in the mitochondrial electron transport chain subunit gene NDUFB8, which is localised to the same chromosomal contig as PTEN. The third aim was the evaluation of the potential therapeutic anti-cancer drug 2,4-Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) and its affect in regulating the PTEN protein in a cervical cancer cell line (HeLa). To approach the aims, paraffin-embedded cancerous cervical tissue and non-cancerous cervical tissue were obtained. DNA recovered from those tissues was then used to investigate the putative genomic changes regarding the NDUFB8 gene utilising SYBR Green I Real-Time PCR. The PTEN gene was studied via Dual-Labelled probe Real-Time PCR. To investigate the protein expression change of the PTEN protein, HeLa cells were firstly treated with different concentrations of 2,4-Thiazolidinediones and the level of PTEN protein expression was then observed utilising standard protein assays. Results indicated that there were putative copy-number changes between the cancerous cervical tissue and non-cancerous cervical tissue, with regard to the PTEN locus. This implies a potential gain of the PTEN gene in cancerous cervical tissue. With regards to normal cervical tissue versus cancerous cervical tissue no significant melting temperature differences were observed with the SYBR Green I Real-Time PCR in respect to the NDUFB8 gene. A putative up-regulation of PTEN protein was observed in TZD treated HeLa cells.",

However, no adequate biomarker is currently available for predicting the prognosis of this cancer. Recent studies have revealed dysregulated expression of several microRNAs (miRNAs) in various cancer tissues, and therefore, these cancer-associated miRNAs (also called onco-miRs) could be promising prognostic biomarkers of cancer progression or metastasis. In this study, in order to identify onco-miRs and their possible targets involved in EEC, we performed microarray-based integrative analyses of miRNA and mRNA expression in specimens excised from EEC lesions and adjacent normal endometrial tissues. Using integrated statistical analyses, we identified miR-200a, miR-200b and miR-429 as highly up-regulated onco-miRs in EECs. Conversely, we detected expression of a tumor-suppressor gene, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which was predicted in silico using a miRNA-targeting mRNA prediction algorithm, as a target of the three miRNAs and which was down-regulated in EECs. Furthermore, these miRNAs were validated to target PTEN experimentally using luciferase assays and real-time polymerase chain reaction. These results suggest that the occurrence of EEC is, at least in part, mediated by miRNA-induced suppression of PTEN expression. ",

However, the mechanisms on aberrant elevation of ARF in cancers are still poorly understood. We previously showed that ARF (p14ARF in human and p19Arf in mouse) elevation correlates with PTEN loss and stabilizes SLUG to reduce cell adhesion in prostate cancer (PCa). Here we report that ARF is essential for MMP7 expression, E-Cadherin decrease and the anchorage loss to the extracellular matrix (ECM) in PCa in vitro and in vivo. We found that Mmp7 is aberrantly elevated in cytosol and nucleus of malignant prostate tumors of Pten/Trp53 mutant mice. Interestingly, p19Arf deficiency strikingly decreases Mmp7 levels but increases E-Cadherin in Pten/Trp53/p19Arf mice. ARF knockdown markedly reduces MMP7 in human PCa cells. Conversely, tetracycline-inducible expression of ARF increases MMP7 with a decrease of E-Cadherin in PCa cells. Importantly, MMP7 physically binds ARF to show the co-localization in nucleus. Co-expression of MMP7 and ARF promotes cell migration, and MMP7 knockdown decreases wound healing in PCa cells. Furthermore, MMP7 elevation correlates with ARF expression in advanced human PCa. Our findings reveal for the first time that the crosstalk between ARF and MMP7 in nucleus contributes to ECM network in tumor microenvironments in vivo, implicating a novel therapeutic target for advanced PCa treatment.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Inactivating mutations in the PTEN tumor suppressor gene occur in approximately 30-50% of endometrial carcinomas. PTEN is a phosphatase that negatively regulates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathway, including the downstream effector AKT. To evaluate the role of PTEN in endometrial growth regulation, we expressed wild-type or mutant PTEN in endometrial carcinoma cell lines. As expected, expression of exogenous PTEN decreased levels of activated AKT in all cell lines examined. However, PTEN induced a G(1) cell cycle arrest specifically in endometrial carcinoma cells that lack endogenous wild-type PTEN. Growth of cells containing wild-type PTEN was unaffected by exogenous PTEN expression. Growth arrest required a functional phosphatase domain but not the PDZ interaction motif of PTEN. Overall levels of CIP/KIP and INK4 family members, the known inhibitory regulators of the G(1) phase of the cell cycle, were unchanged. However, PTEN induced a specific reduction of cyclin D3 levels and an associated increase in the amount of the inhibitor p27(KIP1) complexed with CDK2. Enforced expression of cyclin D3 abrogated the PTEN-induced cell cycle arrest. Although PTEN signaling directly regulates p27(KIP1) levels in some settings, in endometrial carcinoma cells, PTEN expression indirectly regulated p27(KIP1) activity by modulating levels of cyclin D3. These data support multiple mechanisms of PTEN-induced cell cycle arrest.",

Simvastatin, a cholesterol synthesis inhibitor, lowered raft cholesterol content, inhibited Akt1 serine-threonine kinase (protein kinase Balpha)/protein kinase B (Akt/PKB) pathway signaling, and induced apoptosis in caveolin- and PTEN-negative LNCaP PCa cells. Replenishing cell membranes with cholesterol reversed these inhibitory and apoptotic effects. Cholesterol also potentiated Akt activation in normal prostate epithelial cells, which were resistant to the apoptotic effects of simvastatin. Elevation of circulating cholesterol in SCID mice increased the cholesterol content and the extent of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in lipid rafts isolated from LNCaP/sHB xenograft tumors. Cholesterol elevation also promoted tumor growth, increased phosphorylation of Akt, and reduced apoptosis in the xenografts. Our results implicate membrane cholesterol in Akt signaling in both normal and malignant cells and provide evidence that PCa cells can become dependent on a cholesterol-regulated Akt pathway for cell survival.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Emergence of castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer is due to activation of survival pathways, including apoptosis suppression and anoikis resistance, and increased neovascularization. Thus targeting of apoptotic players is of critical significance in prostate cancer therapy since loss of apoptosis and resistance to anoikis are critical in aberrant malignant growth, metastasis and conferring therapeutic failure. The majority of therapeutic agents act through intrinsic mitochondrial, extrinsic death receptor pathways or endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways to induce apoptosis. Current therapeutic strategies target restoring regulatory molecules that govern the pro-survival pathways such as PTEN which regulates AKT activity. Other strategies focus on reactivating the apoptotic pathways either by down-regulating anti-apoptotic players such as BCL-2 or by up-regulating pro-apoptotic protein families, most notably, the caspases. Caspases are a family of cystine proteases which serve critical roles in apoptotic and inflammatory signaling pathways. During tumorigenesis, significant loss or inactivation of lead members in the caspase family leads to impairing apoptosis induction, causing a dramatic imbalance in the growth dynamics, ultimately resulting in aberrant growth of human cancers. Recent exploitation of apoptosis pathways towards re-instating apoptosis induction via caspase re-activation has provided new molecular platforms for the development of therapeutic strategies effective against advanced prostate cancer as well as other solid tumors. This review will discuss the current cellular landscape featuring the caspase family in tumor cells and their activation via pharmacologic intervention towards optimized anti-cancer therapeutic modalities.

Homozygosity for the null mutation (Pten (-/-) mice) results in early embryonic lethality, precluding the functional analysis of Pten in various organs. To investigate the physiological functions of Pten in viable mice, various tissue-specific Pten mutations have been generated using the Cre-loxP system.

Efforts to map recurrent somatic deletions in the tumor genome, especially homozygous deletions (HODs), have provided important positional information in the search for cancer-causing genes. Analyzing HODs in the tumors of 244 patients from two independent cohorts and 22 PCa xenografts using high-resolution single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays, herein we report the identification of CHD1, a chromatin remodeler, as one of the most frequently homozygously deleted genes in PCa, second only to PTEN in this regard. The HODs observed in CHD1, including deletions affecting only internal exons of CHD1, were found to completely extinguish the expression of mRNA of this gene in PCa xenografts. Loss of this chromatin remodeler in clinical specimens is significantly associated with an increased number of additional chromosomal deletions, both hemi- and homozygous, especially on 2q, 5q and 6q. Together with the deletions observed in HEK293 cells stably transfected with CHD1 small hairpin RNA, these data suggest a causal relationship. Downregulation of Chd1 in mouse prostate epithelial cells caused dramatic morphological changes indicative of increased invasiveness, but did not result in transformation.

However, the working mechanisms for Taxol are not fully understood. Here, we showed that treatment of 22Rv1, a PTEN-positive CRPC cell line, with paclitaxel and its semisynthetic analogue docetaxel decreases expression of the androgen receptor (AR)-activated genes prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and Nkx3.1 but increases expression of the AR repression gene maspin, suggesting that Taxol treatment inhibits AR activity. This was further supported by the observation that the activity of AR luciferase reporter genes was inhibited by paclitaxel. In contrast, paclitaxel treatment failed to inhibit AR activity in the PTEN-null CRPC cell line C4-2. However, pretreatment of C4-2 cells with the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 restored paclitaxel inhibition of the AR. Treatment of 22Rv1 xenografts in mice with docetaxel induced mitotic arrest and a decrease in PSA expression in tumor cells adjacent to vascular vessels. We further showed that paclitaxel induces nuclear accumulation of FOXO1, a known AR suppressive nuclear factor, and increases the association of FOXO1 with AR proteins in the nucleus. FOXO1 knockdown with small interfering RNA attenuated the inhibitory effect of paclitaxel on AR transcriptional activity, expression of PSA and Nkx3.1, and cell survival.

The target of the current study was to examine the immunomodulatory effect of DEC, Setaria equina ES or a combination of them on rat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) induced by diethylnitrosamine (DEN). In vitro effect of combined DEC and ES or ES alone on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated rat peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was tested through IFN-γ assay in culture supernatants. In addition, single or repeated doses of DEC, ES or DEC+ES have been applied in white albino rats to test the effect on HCC. Levels of IFN-γ and anti-ES IgG antibodies in rat serum were assayed using ELISA. Hemolytic complement activity (CH50) was determined in serum while the concentration of nitric oxide (NO) was assayed in liver tissue. The infiltration of NK cells as well as the expression of MHC Iproliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), inducible NO synthase (iNOS), Bcl2 and p53 were determined using immunohistochemistry. There was a dose-dependent increase in IFN-γ after in vitro exposure to DEC+ES. Repeated ES doses increased NO concentration (p<0.05) and expression of iNOS but reduced CH50 (p<0.001), while repeated DEC+ES doses could increase anti-ES IgG (p<0.01), IFN-γ level (p<0.05) and NK cell infiltration. The same treatments could also reduce the expression of MHC I expression, PCNA, Bcl2 and p53. This study has shown immunomodulatory and protective effects of DEC+ES repeated doses on rat HCC. ",

The present study aimed at determining the occurrence of an impaired PTEN and p27Kip1 expression alone or in combination in a renal cell carcinoma to further clarify the role of Akt-pathway-associated proteins for the development and/or progression of this malignant disease. By using tissue microarray analysis, tissue samples from renal cell cancers and the corresponding benign tissue samples were investigated for expression of the PTEN, pAkt and p27Kip1 protein by immunohistochemistry. Additionally, a Western blot and RT-PCR analysis was performed to verify the results obtained from the immunohistochemical approach and to further clarify the mechanisms underlying the regulation of both proteins in renal cell cancer. Western blot analysis revealed an overexpression of PTEN and p27Kip1 in renal cell cancer samples and a significantly elevated expression of both proteins when compared with the corresponding benign tissue (p<0.0001 and p<0.0005). The latter finding was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR (p<0.05 and p<0.01) and immunohistochemistry (p<0.001 and p<0.0001). PTEN and p27Kip1 expression were positively correlated with each other both in the tumour and benign tissue (p<0.001 and p<0.0001). We concluded that a strong expression of PTEN in renal cell cancer did not block the PI3K-mediated phosphorylation of Akt in the tumour specimens analysed. Furthermore, Akt activation may not result in a decreased p27Kip1, the latter being retained and overexpressed in the majority of renal cell cancers when compared with the corresponding benign renal parenchyma.",

However, a putative erbB2 and PTEN interaction remains largely unknown in salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma cells. The purpose of this study was to silence erbB2 gene and investigate the functional relationship between erbB2 and PTEN in SACC-83 salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma cells. erbB2-specific siRNAs were transfected into SACC-83 cells using cationic liposome. RT-PCR, immunocytochemistry and Western blotting were employed to detect erbB2 and PTEN expression. Compared with the control groups, erbB2 mRNA expression was decreased in the erbB2-siRNA transfection group, and immunocytochemistry and Western blotting indicated a concordant erbB2 protein reduction. The average optical density values for erbB2 proteins in erbB2-siRNA transfected group were significantly lower than that in the control groups (P<0.05). On the other hand, PTEN expression at both mRNA and protein levels were not significantly affected by erbB2 silencing (P>0.05). In conclusion, the data indicate that siRNA could effectively silence erbB2 gene expression in SACC-83 cells, but PTEN expression appeared unaltered following erbB2 silencing. PTEN expression might not be strictly associated with erbB2 amplification in SACC-83 cells. Future studies will more closely examine the molecular and biological relationships of erbB2 and PTEN in salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma.",

To explore the implication of PTEN and PIK3CA mutations in gastric tumorigenesis, we characterized the expression and mutation status of the genes in 126 gastric tissues and 15 cell lines. Expression of PTEN transcript was abnormally low in 5 of 15 (33%) cell lines and 20 of 55 (36%) primary carcinomas, whereas 0 of 71 noncancerous tissues including 16 benign tumors showed altered expression. Allelotyping analysis using an intragenic polymorphism (IVS4+109) revealed that 14 of 30 (47%) informative cases carried LOH of the gene, which is closely linked to low expression. The LOH rate was significantly higher in advanced tumors [12 of 19 (63%)] compared to early-stage tumors [2 of 11 (18%)] and more frequent in poorly differentiated tumors [9 of 13 (69%)] than well- or moderately differentiated tumors [5 of 17 (29%)]. Interestingly, however, none of the LOH tumors carried mutational disruption of the remaining allele, suggesting haploinsufficiency of PTEN in gastric tumorigenesis. Methylation studies revealed that PTEN pseudogene, but not PTEN, is methylated in cell lines and primary tumors, indicating that PTEN is not a target of epigenetic silencing in gastric cancers and that the pseudogene should be considered more carefully in methylation analysis of the PTEN promoter. Genomic amplification of PIK3CA was found in 9 of 15 (60%) cell lines and 20 of 55 (36.4%) primary tumors but in no noncancerous tissues. Furthermore, PIK3CA amplification was predominantly detected in tumors with no PTEN alterations, suggesting that mutations of PTEN and PIK3CA are mutually exclusive events in gastric tumorigenesis. Amplification of PIK3CA was strongly associated with increased expression of PIK3CA transcript and elevated levels of phospho-AKT. Collectively, our data reveal that 13 of 15 (87%) gastric cell lines and 31 of 55 (56%) primary carcinomas harbored either amplification of PIK3CA or abnormal reduction of PTEN. Mutually exclusive alterations of PTEN and PIK3CA also suggest that mutations of either gene could activate the PI3-kinase/AKT signaling pathway, which is directly linked to the malignant progression of gastric tumor cells.",

In this study, a plasmid containing the PTEN gene was transfected into Ishikawa cells to investigate the difference in growth and signal transduction between Ishikawa-PTEN and Ishikawa cells after SDF-1alpha stimulation, and to study mechanisms of the involvement of PTEN protein in endometrial carcinoma development.;Ishikawa cells were transfected with a plasmid (pLXSN-PTEN) containing the PTEN gene and a plasmid (pLXSN-EGFP) with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Cells were then screened to obtain Ishikawa-PTEN cells and Ishikawa-neo cells that can both stably express PTEN protein and EGFP. Expression of PTEN protein, phosphorylation levels of AKT and ERK (pAKT and pERK) and growth differences in Ishikawa-PTEN, Ishikawa-neo and Ishikawa cells before and after SDF-1alpha stimulation were then determined by Western blots and MTT assays.;Western blot analysis showed that Ishikawa cells produced PTEN after transfection with the PTEN gene. At 15 minutes after SDF-1alpha stimulation, the pAKT level of Ishikawa-PTEN cells was lower than that of Ishikawa-neo cells and Ishikawa cells. There was no significant difference in pERK levels among the three cell lines. The positive effect of SDF-1alpha on Ishikawa-PTEN cells growth was markedly less than the effect on Ishikawa-neo and Ishikawa cells. However, in the absence of SDF-1alpha stimulation (baseline), the pAKT level in Ishikawa-PTEN cells was less than that in Ishikawa cells. There was a significant difference in growth between the Ishikawa-PTEN cells and the Ishikawa-neo cells.;PTEN gene transfection can regulate the level of pAKT but not pERK in Ishikawa-PTEN cells.

        "Doc_abstract":"Epidemiological data suggest that consumption of phytoestrogens can be protective against the development of breast cancer. It may be logical to postulate that phytoestrogens may regulate proteins that control cellular division, such as the tumor suppressor PTEN. Germline, and more significantly, somatic PTEN mutations have been observed in a broad range of human cancers, especially those of the breast. Active PTEN results in decreased phosphorylation of Akt and MAPK, the up-regulation of p27 and down-regulation of cyclin D1 protein levels resulting in decreased proliferation and an increase in apoptosis. We hypothesized that phytoestrogen exposure regulates PTEN protein expression in the breast cancer cell line, MCF-7. When MCF-7 cells were stimulated with resveratrol, quercetin or genistein, there was an increase in PTEN protein levels. Concomitantly, phytoestrogen stimulation resulted in decreased Akt phosphorylation and an increase in p27 protein levels, indicating active PTEN lipid phosphatase activity. In contrast, we found that MAPK phosphorylation and cyclin D1 levels, which are regulated by PTEN's protein phosphatase activity, were not altered. Using semi-quantitative RT-PCR, we found that mRNA levels were slightly increased in cells stimulated by phytoestrogens, suggesting that the mechanism for increased PTEN protein expression is dependent upon transcription. Concurrently, our data provide evidence that a mechanism for phytoestrogens' protective nature is partially through increased PTEN expression. More importantly, it provides a novel target for the regulation of PTEN expression and suggests that dietary changes may be adjunctive to traditional preventive and therapeutic strategies against breast cancer.",

Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme composed of a template RNA and several proteins. Recently, three such telomerase component genes have been identified: human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT); human telomerase RNA component (hTERC); and telomerase-associated protein 1 (TEP1). The expression of these components was evaluated in 34 HCCs and 24 non-cancerous liver tissues by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Expression of hTERT mRNA was detected in most HCCs, but not in the non-cancerous tissues (P<0.01). Expression of hTERC was detected in both HCCs and non-cancerous tissues, but the expression level in HCCs was higher than that in non-cancerous tissues (P<0.01) and tended to increase as histological differentiation became less marked. The expression level of hTERT mRNA correlated with relative telomerase activity (P<0.01). These results suggest that telomerase reactivation during hepatocarcinogenesis might be regulated by only hTERT and an increase in telomerase activity level in tumour progression might be regulated by both hTERT and hTERC.",

The staining pattern was correlated with several well-established prognostic parameters, including 5-year survival. Positive staining of p53 was significantly correlated with increased stage (P < 0.0001), lymph node metastases (P = 0.001), and a nonendometrioid histology (P = 0.001). On the contrary, positive beta-catenin expression was significantly associated with decreased stage (P = 0.002), decreased grade (P = 0.007), and a negative lymph node status (P = 0.023).

EF24 induces apoptosis in these cells apparently by inhibiting miR-21 expression, and also enhances the expression of several miR-21 target genes, PTEN and PDCD4. EF24 treatment significantly suppressed the growth of DU145 prostate cancer xenografts in immunocompromised mice and resulted in tumor regression. EF24 enhanced the expression of the miR-21 target PTEN in DU145 tumor tissue, but suppressed the expression of markers of proliferating cells (cyclin D1 and Ki67). In syngeneic mice injected with B16 cells, EF24 treatment inhibited the formation of lung metastasis, prolonged animal survival, inhibited miR-21 expression and increased the expression of miR-21 target genes. Expression profiling of miRNAs regulated by EF24 in vitro and in vivo showed that the antitumor activity of EF24 reflected the enhanced expression of potential tumor suppressor miRNAs as well as the suppressed expression of oncogenic miRNAs, including miR-21. Taken together, our data suggest that EF24 is a potent anticancer agent and selectively targets NF-κB signaling and miRNA expression, indicating that EF24 has significant potential as a therapeutic agent in various cancers.

Furthermore, endometriosis and cancer are similar in other aspects, such as the development of new blood vessels and a decrease in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis. In spite of these similarities, endometriosis is not considered a malignant disorder. The possibility that endometriosis could, however, transform and become cancer has been debated in the literature since 1925. Mutations in the genes that encode for metabolic and detoxification enzymes, such as GALT and GSTM, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of endometriosis and in the progression to carcinoma of the ovary. PTEN, a tumor suppressor commonly mutated (50%) in endometrial carcinoma, is found mutated in endometrioid carcinoma of the ovary, but not in other forms of ovarian cancer. A recent study has shown that somatic mutations in the PTEN gene were identified in 20% of endometrioid carcinomas and 20.6% of solitary endometrial cysts, suggesting that inactivation of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene is an early event in the development of ovarian endometrioid carcinoma. In addition to cancerous transformation at the site of endometriosis, there is recent evidence to indicate that having endometriosis itself may increase a woman's risk of developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, malignant melanoma, and breast cancer.",

Notwithstanding, several clinical and histologic studies as well as molecular data show that endometriosis could be a precursor of sporadic endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas at extrauterine loci. Several reports have implicated alterations of the hMLH1 and p16(ink4a) (p16) genes, in particular hypermethylation of the promoter region, and of the PTEN gene, principally genetic mutations, in endometrial and ovarian cancers and have indicated that these alterations are already present in precancer conditions. In this report, we analyzed the methylation status of hMLH1 and p16 and the protein expression of PTEN and hMLH1 in 46 cases of endometriosis stages III and IV to better define the possible involvement of these genes in the malignant transformation of endometriosis. We found abnormal methylation of hMLH1 in 4 of the 46 cases (8.6%). In addition, these cases had no detectable hMLH1 protein expression. Regarding patients with hMLH1 alterations, 2 were classified as stage IV and 2 showed coexistent endometriosis and carcinoma. Only 1 case of endometriosis (2.17%), classified as atypical, showed abnormal methylation of p16. Reduced PTEN protein expression was detected in 7 of 46 cases (15.21%): 5 were clinically classified as stage IV, and the other 2 presented both cancer and hypermethylated hMLH1. Our preliminary study suggests that reduced expression of both hMLH1 and PTEN may be involved in the malignant evolution of endometriosis and should be used as markers of neoplastic transformation in aggressive endometriosis with elevated tumor markers.",

This study investigated whether loss of nuclear PTEN is correlated with chemosensitivity, clinicopathological parameters and survival.;Intracellular levels of PTEN of multiple cell lines of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) were evaluated by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. The chemosensitivity of cell lines with various expression levels of PTEN was evaluated using 5-flurouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin and irinotecan (CPT), and clinical significance was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis of 133 CRC specimens.;Colon cancer cell lines HT-29, LoVo and SW480 differed in expression of PTEN, with high, moderate and low levels, respectively. HT-29 and LoVo PTEN expression was suppressed by a low concentration of 5-FU and oxaliplatin; however, SW480 was insensitive to these chemotherapeutic agents. Nuclear PTEN was overexpressed in most (>80%) normal colon mucosa samples, but the incidence significantly decreased (89.2% → 53.4%) in the CRC group. PTEN in the nucleus was negatively correlated with tumor size and vascular invasion in CRC, and CRC patients with negative PTEN expression in the nucleus exhibited poor survival.;Cell lines with a high expression of PTEN are sensitive to chemotherapy with 5-FU and oxaliplatin.

As such, the delivery of the PTEN gene represents a powerful strategy for ESCC therapy. The tegument protein VP22 of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) has been reported to act as a transporter of heterologous proteins across the host cell membrane, thereby enhancing the biological functions of these proteins. In the present study, the intercellular delivery and antitumor activity of the fusion protein PTEN-VP22 were examined in the esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell line Eca109 both in vitro and in vivo. VP22-mediated PTEN intercellular delivery was confirmed in the Eca109 cells by western blot analysis and by quantitation of immunofluorescence. VP22 alone did not exert antiproliferative effects or induce cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis, blockage of the Akt and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) pathways, tumor growth inhibition, or antiangiogenic effects in Eca109 cells. However, compared with PTEN alone, PTEN-VP22 exerted significantly higher antiproliferative effects and induced cell cycle arrest at G1 stage, apoptosis and antiangiogenic effects in Eca109 cells. Together, our findings demonstrate that VP22 alone does not exert antitumor activity directly; however, this protein mediates the intercellular delivery of PTEN and thereby increases its intracellular concentration to achieve a therapeutic steady state, leading to an overall increase in the antitumor activity of PTEN. This study provides further experimental data to confirm the potential of VP22-based intercellular delivery strategies for enhancing the efficacy of gene therapy for cancer treatment.",

Reducing PTEN in breast cancer cells by antisense oligonucleotides conferred trastuzumab resistance in vitro and in vivo. Patients with PTEN-deficient breast cancers had significantly poorer responses to trastuzumab-based therapy than those with normal PTEN.

Loss of PTEN and subsequent AKT activation stimulate estrogen receptor α-dependent pathways that play an important role in endometrial tumorigenesis. The major pathologic phenomenon of endometrial cancer is the loss of ovarian steroid hormone control over uterine epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis. However, the precise mechanism of PTEN/AKT signaling in endometrial cancer remains poorly understood. The progesterone signaling mediator MIG-6 suppresses estrogen signaling and it has been implicated previously as a tumor suppressor in endometrial cancer. In this study, we show that MIG-6 also acts as a tumor suppressor in endometrial cancers associated with PTEN deficiency. Transgenic mice, where Mig-6 was overexpressed in progesterone receptor-expressing cells, exhibited a relative reduction in uterine tumorigenesis caused by Pten deficiency. ERK1/2 was phosphorylated in uterine tumors and administration of an ERK1/2 inhibitor suppressed cancer progression in PR(cre/+)Pten(f/f) mice. In clinical specimens of endometrial cancer, MIG-6 expression correlated inversely with ERK1/2 phosphorylation during progression. Taken together, our findings suggest that Mig-6 regulates ERK1/2 phosphorylation and that it is crucial for progression of PTEN-mutant endometrial cancers, providing a mechanistic rationale for the evaluation of ERK1/2 inhibitors as a therapeutic treatment in human endometrial cancer.",

Loss of PTEN expression leads to the activation of downstream signaling pathways that have been associated with resistance to radiation. In non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), suppressed expression of PTEN is frequently due to methylation of its promoter region. In this study, we tested whether gene transfer of wild-type PTEN into an NSCLC cell line with a known methylated PTEN promoter, H1299, would increase its sensitivity to ionizing radiation. Pretreating H1299 cells with an adenoviral-mediated PTEN (Ad-PTEN)-expressing vector sensitized H1299 cells to radiation. To determine the mechanism responsible for radiosensitization, we first examined radiation-induced apoptosis, which was enhanced but did not correlate with radiosensitizing effect of Ad-PTEN. Therefore, we next examined the ability of Ad-PTEN to modulate the repair of radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) using the detection of repair foci positive for gamma-H2AX, a protein that becomes evident at the sites of each DSB and that can be visualized by immunofluorescent staining. Compared with controls, the repair of radiation-induced DSBs was retarded in H1299 cells pretreated with Ad-PTEN, consistent with the radiosensitizing effect of the vector. We conclude that signal transduction pathways residing primarily in the cytoplasm may intersect with DNA damage and repair pathways in the nucleus to modulate cellular responses to radiation. Elucidating the mechanisms responsible for this intersection may lead to novel strategies for improving therapy for cancers with defective PTEN.",

However, the mechanisms driving these processes are not understood in all details. In our study, we observed significant differences in sensitivity of cancer epithelial cell lines to COX-independent antiproliferative effects of NSAIDs. The prostate cancer cell line LNCaP, lacking both critical enzymes in the negative control of PKB/Akt activation, PTEN and SHIP2, was the most sensitive to these effects, as assessed by analysing the cell cycle profile and expression of cell cycle regulating proteins. We found that p53 protein and its signalling pathway is not involved in early antiproliferative action of the selected NSAID-indomethacin. RNAi provided evidence for the involvement of p21(Cip1/Waf1), but not GDF-15, in antiproliferative effects of indomethacin in LNCaP cells. Interestingly, we also found that indomethacin activated PKB/Akt and induced nuclear localisation of p21(Cip1/Waf1) and Akt2 isoform. Our results are in agreement with other studies and suggest that maintaining of the p21(Cip1/Waf1) level and its intracellular localisation might be influenced by Akt2. Knock-down of SHIP2 by RNAi in PTEN negative prostate and colon cancer cell lines resulted in higher sensitivity to antiproliferative effects of indomethacin. Our data suggest novel mechanisms of NSAIDs antiproliferative action in cancer epithelial cells, which depends on the status of negative regulation of the PKB/Akt pathway and the isoform-specific action of Akt2. Thus, unexpectedly, multiple defects in negative regulation of the PKB/Akt pathway may contribute to increased sensitivity to chemopreventive effects of these widely used drugs.",

Aberrant promoter methylation and expression loss of PTEN were evaluated in cancer tissues of GC by methylation-specific PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively, showing that both abnormalities occurred concurrently in EBV-associated GC. PTEN abnormalities were reiterated in GC cell lines MKN-1 and MKN-7 infected with recombinant EBV, and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) was commonly overexpressed in both cell lines. Stable and transient transfection systems in MKN-1 similarly showed that viral latent membrane protein 2A (LMP2A) up-regulated DNMT1, leading to an increase in methylation of the PTEN promoter. Importantly, the level of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3) increased in the nuclei of LMP2A-expressing GC cells, and knockdown of STAT3 counteracted LMP2A-mediated DNMT1 overexpression. Immunohistochemistry for both pSTAT3 and DNMT1 showed diffuse labeling in the nuclei of the cancer cells in GC tissues, especially in EBV-associated GC. Taken together, LMP2A induces the phosphorylation of STAT3, which activates DNMT1 transcription and causes PTEN expression loss through CpG island methylation of the PTEN promoter in EBV-associated GC.

The susceptibility gene for CS is PTEN, a tumor suppressor gene on 10q23.3 that encodes a lipid phosphatase that lies upstream of protein kinase B (Akt). Interestingly, Carney complex is also a phakomatosis where multiple endocrine neoplasias are prominent and thyroid cancer might be a rare component. One of its susceptibility genes is the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A. Over the course of the last four years, investigators have found the increasing clinical spectrum of syndromes characterized by germline loss-of-function PTEN mutation. In addition to CS, subsets of such disparate syndromes as Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, Proteus syndrome, and possibly VATER with hydrocephalus and megencephaly with autistic features have been found to have germline PTEN mutations. Paradoxically, somatic intragenic PTEN mutations were rare in uncultured primary epithelial thyroid tumors, although hemizygous deletion occurred in 10-20% of thyroid adenomas and carcinomas. However, with subsequent study, it was discovered that epigenetic silencing of PTEN and perhaps inappropriate subcellular compartmentalization were two novel mechanisms of PTEN inactivation pertinent in thyroid carcinogenesis.

Recent studies suggest that tumor microenvironmental factors might modulate the PTEN activity though a decrease in total PTEN expression and an increase in phosphorylation of the PTEN C-terminus (p-PTEN), resulting in the acquisition of the EMT phenotypes. Nevertheless, it is not known whether persistent hypoxia can modulate PTEN phosphatase activity or whether hypoxia-induced EMT phenotypes are negatively regulated by the PTEN phosphatase activity. We aimed to investigate hypoxia-induced modulation of PTEN activity and EMT phenotypes in lung cancers.;Western blotting was performed in five lung cancer cell lines to evaluate total PTEN expression levels and the PTEN activation. In a xenograft model of lung cancer cells with endogenous PTEN expression, the PTEN expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. To examine the effect of hypoxia on phenotypic alterations in lung cancer cells in vitro, the cells were cultured under hypoxia. The effect of unphosphorylated PTEN (PTEN4A) induction on hypoxia-induced EMT phenotypes was evaluated, by using a Dox-dependent gene expression system.;Lung cancer cells involving the EMT phenotypes showed a decrease in total PTEN expression and an increase in p-PTEN. In a xenograft model, loss of PTEN expression was observed in the tumor lesions showing tissue hypoxia. Persistent hypoxia yielded an approximately eight-fold increase in the p-PTEN/PTEN ratio in vitro. PTEN4A did not affect stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α.

PREX2, a widely distributed GEF that activates the GTPase RAC1, binds to and inhibits PTEN. We used mouse embryonic fibroblasts and breast cancer cell lines to show that PTEN suppresses cell migration and invasion by blocking PREX2 activity. In addition to metabolizing the phosphoinositide PIP₃, PTEN inhibited PREX2-induced invasion by a mechanism that required the tail domain of PTEN, but not its lipid phosphatase activity. Fluorescent nucleotide exchange assays revealed that PTEN inhibited the GEF activity of PREX2 toward RAC1. PREX2 is a frequently mutated GEF in cancer, and examination of human tumor data showed that PREX2 mutation was associated with high PTEN expression. Therefore, we tested whether cancer-derived somatic PREX2 mutants, which accelerate tumor formation of immortalized melanocytes, were inhibited by PTEN. The three stably expressed, somatic PREX2 cancer mutants that we tested were resistant to PTEN-mediated inhibition of invasion but retained the ability to inhibit the lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN. In vitro analysis showed that PTEN did not block the GEF activity of two PREX2 cancer mutants and had a reduced binding affinity for the third. Thus, PTEN antagonized migration and invasion by restraining PREX2 GEF activity, and PREX2 mutants are likely selected in cancer to escape PTEN-mediated inhibition of invasion.",

When the volume of the tumors grown subcutaneously in athymic nude mice reached 50-60 mm(3), three intratumoral injections of the following four formulations were performed during week 1 and then during week 3: (1) saline, (2) DC + Tf + pCMVlacZ, (3) DC + Tf + pCMVPTEN, and (4) DC + Tf + pCMVp53 (standard formulation). There was no significant difference in tumor volume and survival between group 1 and group 2 animals. As compared with group 1 controls, group 3 animals had slower tumor growth during the first 3 weeks but thereafter their tumor growth rate was similar to that of the controls. By day 2 posttreatment, group 4 animals had significantly lower tumor volume relative to initial tumor volume as well as controls at the comparable time point. Also, animals treated with p53 survived longer. Treatment with DC, Tf, pCMVp53, DC + pCMVp53, or Tf + pCMVp53 had no effect on tumor volume or survival. Expression of p53 protein and apoptosis were detected in tumors treated with the standard formulation, thus associating p53 protein expression and apoptosis with efficacy. However, p53 protein was expressed in only a fraction of the tumor cells, suggesting a role for bystander effects in the efficacy of p53 gene therapy.

PTEN is heavily regulated by transcription factors, microRNAs, competitive endogenous RNAs (such as the PTEN pseudogene), and methylation, whereas the tumor suppressive activity of the PTEN protein can be altered at multiple levels through aberrant phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation. These regulatory cues are presumed to play a key role in tumorigenesis through the alteration of the appropriate levels, localization, and activity of PTEN. The identification of all these levels of PTEN regulation raises, in turn, a key corollary question: How low should PTEN level(s) or activity drop in order to confer cancer susceptibility at the organismal level? Our laboratory and others have approached this question through the genetic manipulation of Pten in the mouse.

        "Doc_abstract":"The phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) tumor suppressor is a phosphatase that antagonizes the phosphoinositol-3-kinase/AKT signaling pathway and suppresses cell survival as well as cell proliferation. PTEN is the second most frequently mutated gene in human cancer after p53. Germline mutations of PTEN have been found in cancer susceptibility syndromes, such as Cowden syndrome, in which over 80% of patients have mutations of PTEN. Homozygous deletion of Pten causes embryonic lethality, suggesting that PTEN is essential for embryonic development. Mice heterozygous for Pten develop spontaneous tumors in a variety of organs comparable with the spectrum of its mutations in human cancer. The mechanisms of PTEN functions in tumor suppression are currently under intense investigation. Recent studies demonstrate that PTEN plays an essential role in the maintenance of chromosomal stability and that loss of PTEN leads to massive alterations of chromosomes. The tumor suppressor p53 is known as a guardian of the genome that mediates the cellular response to environmental stress, leading to cell cycle arrest or cell death. Through completely different mechanisms, PTEN also protects the genome from instability. Thus, we propose that PTEN is a new guardian of the genome. In this review, we will discuss new discoveries on the role of PTEN in tumor suppression and explore mechanisms by which PTEN maintains genomic stability.",

Mutation or deletion of PTEN, historically the most commonly identified mechanisms of inactivation of tumor suppressors, is found only in the minority of sporadic non-cultured primary cancers, which indicates that there might be other, novel mechanisms of inactivation. Despite the absence of a classic nuclear localization signal, PTEN enters the nucleus by several mechanisms, including simple diffusion, active shuttling, cytoplasmic-localization-signal-dependent export and monoubiquitylation-dependent import. Cytoplasmic PTEN has a well-known role as a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway; however, it is becoming clear that cytosolic PTEN is not the same as nuclear PTEN. Nuclear PTEN plays a role in chromosome stability, DNA repair, cell cycle arrest and cellular stability. The balance between these functions is an important factor in determining whether a cell remains benign or becomes neoplastic.",

Residual tissue androgens are consistently detected within CRPC tumors and play a critical role in facilitating AR-mediated signaling pathways which lead to disease progression. Testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) are the major androgens detected in tumors. They are produced through three biosynthesis pathways: Δ(4), Δ(5), and backdoor pathways. Both androgens bind to and stimulate AR activation. The current study investigates the effects of pomegranate extracts (POM) and their ability to inhibit androgen biosynthesis using PCa cell lines (22RV1 and LNCaP) in vitro as well as the PTEN knockout mouse model representing prostate cancer. Steroids were extracted using ethyl acetate or solid phase extraction, and then analyzed by UPLC/MS/MS. The results showed that POM (0-12μg/mL) reduced the production of testosterone, DHT, DHEA, androstenedione, androsterone, and pregnenolone in both cell lines. In addition our in vivo data supports this observation with a reduction in serum steroids determined after 20 weeks of POM treatment (0.17 g/L in drinking water). In accordance with these results, Western blotting of cell lysates and tPSA analysis determined that PSA was significantly decreased by the treatment of POM. Interestingly, AKR1C3 and AR levels were shown to be increased in both cell lines, perhaps as a negative feedback effect in response to steroid inhibition. Overall, these results provide mechanistic evidence to support the rationale for recent clinical reports describing efficacy of POM in CRPC patients.",

Recently several relevant genes have been cloned, including those encoding three major components of human telomerase: human telomerase RNA component (hTR), human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), and telomerase-associated protein-1 (TEP1). Also important are genes encoding human telomeric-repeat binding factor proteins (TRF) 1 and 2. We compared 10 human malignant hematopoietic cell lines, 19 samples from patients with acute leukemia and normal granulocytes and monocytes to study telomerase activity and expression of these various genes using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In all 10 malignant cell lines with telomerase activity, hTR, hTERT mRNA, and TEP1 mRNA were expressed, while in normal monocytes and granulocytes without telomerase activity, expression of hTR, but not hTERT mRNA was detected. TEP1 mRNA was expressed in normal monocytes, but not granulocytes. Expression of TRF1 and TRF2 mRNAs was greater in the normal cells than in human malignant hematopoietic cell lines and in 16 samples of patients with acute leukemia. When differentiation of the malignant hematopoietic cell line HL-60 was induced using tumor-necrosis-factor 471 and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), telomerase activity decreased gradually during differentiation. Of the three telomerase components, only hTERT mRNA expression showed changes paralleling telomerase activity, becoming undetectable with differentiation. In contrast, initially low expression of TRF1 and TRF2 mRNAs increased during differentiation. Not only hTERT, but also TRF1 and TRF2 are important regulators of telomerase activity that represent potential targets for gene therapy against cancer.",

The tumor suppressor gene Pten (phosphatase and tensin homolog) is commonly mutated in the more common type 1 (endometrioid) subtype. The glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94) is emerging as a novel regulator for cancer development. Here we report that expression profiles from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) showed significantly increased Grp94 mRNA levels in endometrial tumor versus normal tissues, correlating with highly elevated GRP94 protein expression in patient samples and the requirement of GRP94 for maintaining viability of human endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EAC) cell lines. Through generation of uterus-specific knockout mouse models with deletion of Grp94 alone (c94f/f) or in combination with Pten (cPf/f94f/f), we discovered that c94f/f uteri induced squamous cell metaplasia (SCM) and reduced active nuclear β-catenin. The cPf/f94f/f uteri showed accelerated SCM and suppression of PTEN-null driven EAC, with reduced cellular proliferation, attenuated β-catenin signaling and decreased AKT/S6 activation in the SCM. In contrast to single PTEN knockout uteri (cPf/f), cPf/f94f/f uteri showed no decrease in E-cadherin level and no invasive lesion. Collectively, our study implies that GRP94 downregulation induces SCM in EAC and suppresses AKT/S6 signaling, providing a novel mechanism for suppressing EAC progression. ",

We describe two patients presenting with colorectal cancer at a young age (28 and 39 years) and dysmorphisms fitting the Cowden spectrum. Heterozygous germline mutations in PTEN were found in both patients. Moreover, analysis of the resected colorectal cancer specimens revealed loss of heterozygosity at the PTEN locus with retention of the mutated alleles, and greatly reduced or absent PTEN expression. Histologically and molecularly, the tumours showed resemblance with sporadic colorectal cancers, although they had prominent fibrotic stroma. Our data indicate that PTEN loss was involved in carcinogenesis in the two patients, supporting that colorectal cancer is part of the Cowden syndrome-spectrum. This is in line with data on sporadic colorectal cancer, mice studies and emerging epidemiological data on Cowden syndrome. Although the exact role of germline PTEN mutations in the carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer remains unclear, we think that Cowden syndrome should be in the differential diagnosis of colorectal cancer certainly in view of the possible prognostic and therapeutic consequences.

To decipher molecular relatedness, we used laser capture microdissection (LCM) and whole-genome amplification (WGA) to separately collect and amplify DNA from adjacent GP3 and GP4 cell populations from 14 cases of GS7 prostate cancer. We then carried out massively parallel mate-pair next generation sequencing (NGS) to examine the landscape of large chromosomal alterations. We identified four to 115 DNA breakpoints in GP3 and 17 to 480 in GP4. Our findings indicate that while GP3 and GP4 from the same tumor each possess unique breakpoints, they also share identical ones, indicating a common origin. Approximately 300 chromosomal breakpoints were localized to the regions affected in at least two tumors, whereas more than 3,000 were unique within the set of 14 tumors. TMPRSS2-ERG was the most recurrent rearrangement present in eight cases, in both GP3 and GP4. PTEN rearrangements were found in five of eight TMPRSS2-ERG fusion-positive cases in both GP3 and GP4.

PTEN regulates cell growth, apoptosis, and proliferation. Phosphorylation in PTEN tail causes its inactivation and decreases its degradation. There is little known about the regulation of PTEN by ovarian steroids. We hypothesized that PTEN expression in human endometrium is variable throughout the menstrual cycle and early pregnancy, and that ovarian steroids regulate PTEN expression because PTEN is critical in many steroid-sensitive tissues such as endometrium, prostate, and breast. In the present study, we have observed a direct regulation of PTEN by ovarian steroids. Estradiol increased PTEN phosphorylation at 5-15 min. After 24-h treatment, progesterone induced a significant increase in PTEN protein levels, assessed by Western blot. Furthermore, we evaluated for the first time a comparison between menstrual cycle and early pregnancy, immunohistochemically. Endometrial PTEN expression revealed temporal and spatial changes throughout the menstrual cycle and during early pregnancy. We conclude that estradiol may down-regulate PTEN activity by increasing its phosphorylation, but progesterone is likely to regulate the PTEN pool by decreasing its phosphorylation and increasing its protein level. Presented data, therefore, suggest that ovarian steroids regulate the endometrial PTEN pool. We propose that PTEN might be one of the signaling proteins that estrogen and progesterone are acting to affect endometrial cell proliferation and/or apoptosis.",

To clarify the impact of the pathway-related molecules on prognosis, we analyzed PTEN, phosphorylated-Akt (p-Akt), and Ki-67 expression by immunohistochemistry in 99 patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma. PTEN-negative or PTEN-mixed staining was found in 66% of tumors. Positive staining of p-Akt was found in 40% of tumors. Loss of PTEN expression (negative or mixed) was significantly associated with positive p-Akt expression. The patients with PTEN-positive and p-Akt-negative expression clearly showed a higher survival rate than patients in the other groups. Subsequent multivariate analysis revealed that the combination of PTEN/Akt expression was an independent prognostic factor. Examining the relationship between p-Akt expression and Ki-67 labeling index (LI), we found that negative p-Akt was related to a decrease in Ki-67 LI. Additionally, the patients with low Ki-67 LI, as determined by p-Akt-expression status, had a better prognosis. In the present study, we demonstrated that PTEN-positive and p-Akt-negative expression was a predictor of survival for patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma. This study suggests the clinical significance of PTEN and p-Akt expression analysis in treatment decisions for patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma.",

Cowden syndrome (CS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by benign and malignant tumors. CS-related individual features occur commonly in the general population. Approximately 25% of patients diagnosed with CS have pathogenic germline PTEN mutations, which increase lifetime risks of breast, thyroid, uterine, renal and other cancers.

In this review, we highlight our current knowledge of germline PTEN mutations in relation to human disease.

In this study, the biological and prognostic value of phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway dysregulation was assessed by immunohistochemistry in a well-characterized series of 72 patients with node-negative breast cancer with a long-term follow-up. Phosphorylated Akt and PTEN expression was reduced in 32% and 12.5% of the tumors, respectively. Phosphorylated Akt or PTEN status was not associated with the main clinicopathologic and biological parameters, whereas their expression was tightly related to their downstream targets cyclin D1 and p27(Kip1) which are involved in cell proliferation. Survival analysis showed a strong association between a shorter disease-free survival and the dysregulated expression of phosphorylated Akt (P = .036), PTEN (P = .003), p27(Kip1) (P = .008), and Ki67 (P = .0007), or the distinct subtypes of breast tumors (luminal, HER2 overexpressing, and basal-like; P = .03). Moreover, multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional-hazards regression model showed that PTEN and Ki67 were independent predictive factors of disease recurrence and that their simultaneous dysregulation strongly increased the hazards ratio of the patients with node-negative breast cancer (hazards ratio, 38.30; P = .0014). In conclusion, our results show that the dysregulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt/PTEN pathway is relevant to the prognosis in node-negative breast carcinoma and that the evaluation of key components of this pathway might be a useful tool to identify the patients with node-negative breast cancer at high-risk of disease recurrence.",

We aimed to determine whether long-term androgen deprivation was superior to short-term androgen deprivation when combined with high-dose radiotherapy.;In this open-label, multicentre, phase 3 randomised controlled trial, patients were recruited from ten university hospitals throughout Spain. Eligible patients had clinical stage T1c-T3b N0M0 prostate adenocarcinoma with intermediate-risk and high-risk factors according to 2005 National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated randomisation schedule to receive either 4 months of androgen deprivation combined with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy at a minimum dose of 76 Gy (range 76-82 Gy; short-term androgen deprivation group) or the same treatment followed by 24 months of adjuvant androgen deprivation (long-term androgen deprivation group), stratified by prostate cancer risk group (intermediate risk vs high risk) and participating centre. Patients assigned to the short-term androgen deprivation group received 4 months of neoadjuvant and concomitant androgen deprivation with subcutaneous goserelin (2 months before and 2 months combined with high-dose radiotherapy). Anti-androgen therapy (flutamide 750 mg per day or bicalutamide 50 mg per day) was added during the first 2 months of treatment. Patients assigned to long-term suppression continued with the same luteinising hormone-releasing hormone analogue every 3 months for another 24 months. The primary endpoint was biochemical disease-free survival. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02175212.;Between Nov 7, 2005, and Dec 20, 2010, 178 patients were randomly assigned to receive short-term androgen deprivation and 177 to receive long-term androgen deprivation. After a median follow-up of 63 months (IQR 50-82), 5-year biochemical disease-free survival was significantly better among patients receiving long-term androgen deprivation than among those receiving short-term treatment (90% [95% CI 87-92] vs 81% [78-85]; hazard ratio [HR] 1·88 [95% CI 1·12-3·15]; p=0·01). 5-year overall survival (95% [95% CI 93-97] vs 86% [83-89]; HR 2·48 [95% CI 1·31-4·68]; p=0·009) and 5-year metastasis-free survival (94% [95% CI 92-96] vs 83% [80-86]; HR 2·31 [95% CI 1·23-3·85]; p=0·01) were also significantly better in the long-term androgen deprivation group than in the short-term androgen deprivation group. The effect of long-term androgen deprivation on biochemical disease-free survival, metastasis-free survival, and overall survival was more evident in patients with high-risk disease than in those with low-risk disease. Grade 3 late rectal toxicity was noted in three (2%) of 177 patients in the long-term androgen deprivation group and two (1%) of 178 in the short-term androgen deprivation group; grade 3-4 late urinary toxicity was noted in five (3%) patients in each group. No deaths related to treatment were reported.;Compared with short-term androgen deprivation, 2 years of adjuvant androgen deprivation combined with high-dose radiotherapy improved biochemical control and overall survival in patients with prostate cancer, particularly those with high-risk disease, with no increase in late radiation toxicity.

        "Doc_abstract":"Deregulation of the PI3K signaling pathway is observed in many human cancers and occurs most frequently through loss of PTEN phosphatase tumor suppressor function or through somatic activating mutations in the Class IA PI3K, PIK3CA. Tumors harboring activated p110alpha, the protein product of PIK3CA, require p110alpha activity for growth and survival and hence are expected to be responsive to inhibitors of its lipid kinase activity. Whether PTEN-deficient cancers similarly depend on p110alpha activity to sustain activation of the PI3K pathway has been unclear. In this study, we used a single-vector lentiviral inducible shRNA system to selectively inactivate the three Class IA PI3Ks, PIK3CA, PIK3CB, and PIK3CD, to determine which PI3K isoforms are responsible for driving the abnormal proliferation of PTEN-deficient cancers. Down-regulation of PIK3CA in colorectal cancer cells harboring mutations in PIK3CA inhibited downstream PI3K signaling and cell growth. Surprisingly, PIK3CA depletion affected neither PI3K signaling nor cell growth in 3 PTEN-deficient cancer cell lines. In contrast, down-regulation of the PIK3CB isoform, which encodes p110beta, resulted in pathway inactivation and subsequent inhibition of growth in both cell-based and in vivo settings. This essential function of PIK3CB in PTEN-deficient cancer cells required its lipid kinase activity. Our findings demonstrate that although p110alpha activation is required to sustain the proliferation of established PIK3CA-mutant tumors, PTEN-deficient tumors are dependent instead on p110beta signaling. This unexpected finding demonstrates the need to tailor therapeutic approaches to the genetic basis of PI3K pathway activation to achieve optimal treatment response.",

Athymic mice, bearing human colon carcinoma xenografts (LS-174T) were injected i.v. to determine the biodistribution of the MAb chelate conjugates. Three of the MAb metal chelate conjugates (1B4M-DTPA, 1M3B-DTPA, and 1B3M-DTPA), labeled with 111In showed efficient and stable tumor localization as well as a slower blood clearance rate than SCN-Bz-DTPA, GEM-DTPA or 2B-DTPA MAb chelate conjugates. Major differences were also seen in normal organ uptake, especially liver and spleen.

A recent molecular and mutational analysis of breast cancers revealed that inactivation of tumor suppressors, p53 and PTEN, are strongly associated with triple negative breast cancer. In addition, these tumor suppressors have important roles in regulating self-renewal in normal and malignant stem cells. To investigate their role in breast carcinogenesis, we knocked down these genes in human mammary cells and in non-transformed MCF10A cells. p53 and PTEN knockdown synergized to activate pro-inflammatory interleukin-6 (IL6)/Stat3/nuclear factor κB signaling. This resulted in generation of highly metastatic epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-like cancer stem cells resulting in tumors whose gene expression profile mimicked that found in basal/claudin-low molecular subtype within the triple negative breast tumors. Constitutive activation of this loop in transformed cells was dependent on proteolytic degradation of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) resulting in low levels of this protein in basal/claudin-low cell lines and primary tumors. In non-transformed cells, transient activation of the IL6 inflammatory loop induced SOCS3 expression leading to pathway inactivation. In transformed cells, enforced expression of SOCS3 or interfering with IL6 pathway via IL6R blockade inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in mouse xenograft models. Furthermore, circulating tumor cells were significantly reduced in tumor-bearing animals when treated with anti-IL6R antibodies. These studies uncover important connections between inflammation and carcinogenesis and suggest that blocking pro-inflammatory cytokines may be utilized as an attractive strategy to target triple negative breast tumors, which currently lacks molecularly targeted therapies.

Sequential multislice T1-weighted turbo field echo (TFE) (TR/TE/flip angle: 15 msec/6.1 msec/25 degrees) coronal images of normal rats were obtained before and after intravenous injections of 0.1 mmol/kg [Gd(Bz-TTDA)]2- in study groups (N = 12) or 0.1 mmol/kg gadopentate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA)2- in control groups (N = 12). Similar protocols of MR imaging with additional T2-weighted images were used for the rats with implanted HCC in both study and control groups (N = 12, in each group). MR images were analyzed to evaluate the time-enhancement change (% increase of signal-to-noise ratio [SI/N]) in normal liver, renal cortex, renal medulla, and tumors. The liver-lesion contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) were also evaluated in study and control groups. The rats were killed immediately after the last MR scan to undergo autopsy and histopathologic observation. The acute toxicity test (medial lethal dose, LD50) in mice was also done.;The liver enhancement in normal rats reached a plateau 5-50 minutes after injection of [Gd(Bz-TTDA)]2-, maintained for three hours, then gradually declined. Intensity of enhancement in liver, renal cortex, and medulla after injection of [Gd(Bz-TTDA)]2- was significantly higher than with Gd-DTPA. The efficacy of tumor characterization with injection of [Gd(Bz-TTDA)]2- was similar to that of Gd-DTPA at the early dynamic phase of the contrast study. However, the liver-lesion CNRs were significantly higher in the study group in the later phase, when tumor enhancement decreased and liver enhancement persisted. The dose of LD50 in acute toxicity test of [Gd(Bz-TTDA)]2- in mice was 7.5 mmol/kg.;The preliminary results in this animal study indicated that [Gd(Bz-TTDA)]2- has the potential of becoming a reliable liver MR contrast agent.",

Cells were exposed to various concentrations of ethanolic neem leaf extract (ENLE) (25-125 μg/ml). The doses were fixed by cell viability (MTT) assay. For apoptotic detection in situ apoptosis assay, caspase-3 activity and protein expression of cytochrome c and Poly-ADP Ribose Polymerase (PARP) were analysed as well as mRNA expression of Bcl-2 family proteins was studied by RT-PCR. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and p-Akt were analysed by western blotting and mRNA expression of Akt 1 and 2, PTEN was performed by RT-PCR. Immunoblotting of cyclin D1 and p21 was done to access the inhibition of cell proliferation.;ENLE gives 50% inhibition at a dose of 100 μg/ml in both PC-3 and LNCaP cells and considered as effective dose. ENLE decreased the protein expression of PI3K as well as p-Akt and the mRNA expression of Akt 1and 2 in both the cells. There was a significant decrease in mRNA expression of PTEN in LNCaP cells. ENLE induced apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation by inhibiting PI3K/Akt pathway. Decrease in p-Akt leads to increase in the protein level of Bad, p21 and decrease in the cyclin D1, respectively. ENLE treatment increased the cytochrome c expression and caspase-3 activity as well as regulated the mRNA expression of Bcl-2 family proteins thereby inducing apoptosis to both the cell lines. In situ apoptosis assay showed increased red fluorescence in 100 μg/ml of ENLE in both PC-3 and LNCaP cell lines.;The results suggested that ENLE induces apoptosis and inhibits cell proliferation through inhibiting PI3K/Akt pathway in both PC-3 and LNCaP cells.",

MicroRNA (miRNA)-494 has been proven to be involved in the carcinogenesis and development of various types of cancer by directly targeting PTEN. However the role, mechanism and clinical significance of miR-494 in cervical cancer have not been further reported. In the present study, we analyzed the expression of miR-494 in -with PTEN expression and clinicopathological data of cervical cancer patients. The results showed that miR-494 expression was significantly upregulated in human cervical cancer cell lines and tissues. miR-494 upregulation was significantly associated with PTEN downregulation, adverse clinicopathological characteristics, poor overall and progression-free survival and poor prognosis. In vitro experiments showed that inhibition of miR-494 suppressed cell proliferation and growth by directly targeting the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of PTEN mRNA. These findings identified a novel molecular mechanism involved in the regulation of PTEN expression and cervical cancer progression.

DNA of 38 patients with endometrial carcinoma (EC) was extracted from blood and from fresh-frozen and paraffin-embedded tumor tissue. PTEN mutations were detected by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and DNA sequencing. Results were correlated with MI status and clinicopathologic data. PTEN mutations were detected in 17 tumors (44.7%), and they were more frequent in endometrioid (EEC) (17 of 33, 51.5%) than in nonendometrioid carcinomas (NEEC) (0 of 5, 0%). PTEN mutational spectrum differed between MI+ and MItumors. PTEN mutations were detected in 9 of 15 MI+ tumors (60%), but in only 8 of 23 MI- neoplasms (34.8%). In EC with MI, PTEN mutations were detected in short coding mononucleotide repeats (A)s and (A)6 in 4 of 9 carcinomas (44.4%). These results confirm that PTEN is an important target gene in endometrial carcinogenesis.

ERs are involved in the etiology and/or progression of cancers of the prostate, breast, uterus, ovary, colon, lung, stomach, and malignancies of the immune system. In estrogen-sensitive malignancies, ERβ usually is a tumor suppressor and ERα is an oncogene. ERβ regulates genes in several key pathways including tumor suppression (p53, PTEN); metabolism (PI3K); survival (Akt); proliferation pathways (p45(Skp2), cMyc, and cyclin E); cell-cycle arresting factors (p21(WAF1), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (CDKN1A)), p27(Kip1), and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs); protection from reactive oxygen species, glutathione peroxidase. Because they are activated by small molecules, ERs are excellent targets for pharmaceuticals. ERα antagonists have been used for many years in the treatment of breast cancer and more recently pharmaceutical companies have produced agonists which are very selective for ERα or ERβ. ERβ agonists are being considered for preventing progression of cancer, treatment of anxiety and depression, as anti-inflammatory agents and as agents, which prevent or reduce the severity of neurodegenerative diseases.

Unlike other head and neck cancers, mutations or deletions of tumor suppressor genes in NPC are not common. Recently, downregulation of tumor suppressor genes expression by microRNA (miRNA) is increasingly recognized as an important mechanism of nasopharyngeal tumorigenesis. In this study, we reported that microRNA-144 (miR-144) was frequently upregulated in NPC specimens and cell lines. Repression of miR-144 significantly decreased cell proliferation, clonogenicity, migration, invasion and tumor formation in nude mice, while restoring miR-144 in miR-144-attenuated NPC cells exhibited a strong tumorigenic role. Further, we found that miR-144 was inversely correlated with the tumor suppressor gene phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in NPC specimens and cell lines, and then we identified PTEN as a direct target of miR-144 in NPC cell lines. PTEN downregulation in miR-144-attenuated cells could increase cell growth, migration and invasion. Mechanistic investigations revealed that miR-144 suppressed the expression of PTEN to increase the expression of pAkt and cyclin D1 to promote G(1)-phase transition and decrease E-cadherin to promote migration and invasion. Taken together, we provide compelling evidence that miR-144 functions as an onco-miRNA in NPC, and its oncoeffects are mediated chiefly by repressing PTEN expression to activate the PI3K/Akt pathway.",

While PI3 kinase (PI3K) produces PIP3, PTEN dephosphorylates the 3-position phosphate from PIP3, thereby directly inhibiting Akt activation. PTEN is the dominant PIP3 phosphatase, as knockdown of PTEN results in increases in Akt activation in mice. The PTEN tumor suppressor gene is frequently mutated in a variety of human cancers, consistent with an inverse correlation between levels of the PTEN protein and Akt activation. We have examined PTEN expression and Akt activation in 35 primary clear cell renal cell carcinomas RCCs (ccRCCs) and 9 papillary RCCs (pRCCs) and their respective non-tumor kidney tissues. The PTEN protein was reduced in 16 ccRCCs (16/35=45.7%) and 8 pRCCs (8/9=88.9%). In these RCCs, 25.0% (4/16) of ccRCCs and 25.0% (2/8) of pRCCs expressed elevated Akt activation. 19 ccRCCc (19/35=54.3%) expressed comparable or higher levels of PTEN. Of these ccRCCs, 31.6% (6/19) showed increases in Akt activation. As PTEN dominantly inhibits Akt activation, the coexistence of high levels of the PTEN protein with enhanced Akt activation suggests the existence of novel mechanisms which attenuate PTEN function in ccRCC. These mechanisms may reduce PTEN function or increase PIP3 production.",

Moreover, FAK overexpression could rescue the inhibition of cell invasion by PTEN. These results were further confirmed in orthotropic gastric cancer nude mice model. In addition, in human gastric cancer tissues, PTEN protein level was conversely correlated with FAK protein level. Mechanistically, we found that PTEN inhibited PI3K/NF-κB pathway and inhibited the DNA binding of NF-κB on FAK promoter.

In the current study, we investigated the role of PTEN, a tumor suppressor, in chemotaxis of human breast cancer cells.

Disruption of PTEN by siRNA caused a marked decrease in chemokinesis, cell adhesion, and membrane spreading, resulting in a severe defect in chemotaxis. In PTEN disrupted cells, PDK1, AKT, and PKCzeta exhibited elevated basal activities, which prevented EGF-induced further activation of these molecules. In the absence of EGF, active PDK1 was detected on multiple directions of the plasma membranes of PTEN disrupted cells, which competed against EGF-induced gradient sensing. To confirm the biological relevance of in vitro studies, both PTEN disrupted cells and its parental human breast cancer cells were injected into tail veins of SCID mice. Mice injected with PTEN disrupted cancer cells showed a marked decrease in lung metastasis.

Improved insight into the regulation of PTEN is leading to a richer understanding of the contribution of PTEN and the PI-3 kinase pathway to human tumors. Understanding the pathology of PI-3 kinase signaling in tumors improves knowledge of cancer etiology and provides novel therapeutic targets.",

However, such tumors usually arise in perimenopausal or postmenopausal women with decreased serum estrogen levels. This study aimed to reveal the contributions of estrogen to endometrial carcinogenesis in a mouse model of endometrial carcinoma initiated by conditional targeting of Pten.;The Cre-loxP system was used to achieve Pten inactivation within mouse endometrial epithelium. We delivered a recombinant adenovirus vector expressing Cre recombinase to the endometrial cavity of the Pten mice that had been ovariectomized at 10 weeks old. Mice were subcutaneously injected with 17β-estradiol (E2) or vehicle, followed by injection of the adenovirus. Two weeks after adenovirus injection, the entire endometrium was analyzed.;Mice that did not receive E2 injection notably developed endometrial neoplasia, complex atypical hyperplasia, or carcinoma (7/8, 87.5%). In contrast, hyperplastic but nonneoplastic endometrium was observed in E2-treated mice. In these E2-treated mice, immunohistochemistry revealed that Pten-null glandular epithelial cells clonally proliferate among the hyperplastic endometrium.;The results of this study suggest that estrogen clonally proliferates Pten-null epithelial cells together with surrounding cells, and depletion of estrogen induces predominant growth of Pten-null cells with estrogen-independent capabilities, resulting in abnormal structure of the glandular cells and subsequent neoplasia. This phenomenon might explain why the incidence of human endometrial carcinoma increases with perimenopausal or postmenopausal status, which represents declining ovarian function. Our model mice have partially resolved the issue of endometrial Pten- and estrogen-related carcinogenesis and have potential to represent a valuable tool for developing novel therapies against this carcinoma.",

This modification is dependent on the phosphorylation of EGR1 at S350 and T309 by Akt, which promotes interaction of EGR1 with ARF at K272 in its repressor domain by the ARF/Ubc9/SUMO system. EGR1 sumoylation is decreased by ARF reduction, and no EGR1 sumoylation is detected in ARF(-/-) mice, which also exhibit reduced amounts of PTEN. Our model predicts that perturbation of any of the clinically important tumour suppressors, PTEN, EGR1, and ARF, will cause some degree of dysfunction of the others.

Disregulation in the activity of either of these players can lead to cellular transformation. Many protein tyrosine kinases are proto-oncogenes and it has been postulated that some protein phosphatases may act as tumor suppressors. Herein we will review the recent findings addressing the roles the candidate tumor suppressor PTEN/MMAC1/TEP1 (PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10; MMAC 1, mutated in multiple advanced cancers 1; TEP1, TGF beta regulated and epithelial cell enriched phosphatase 1) plays in signal transduction and tumorigenesis. PTEN is a dual specificity protein phosphatase (towards phospho-Ser/Thr and phospho-Tyr) and, unexpectedly, also has a phosphoinositide 3-phosphatase activity. PTEN plays an important role in the modulation of the 1-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns 3-kinase) pathway, by catalyzing the degradation of the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 generated by PtdIns 3-kinase; this inhibits the downstream functions mediated by the PtdIns 3-kinase pathway, such as activation of protein kinase B (PKB, also known as Akt), cell survival and cell proliferation. Furthermore, PTEN modulates cell migration and invasion by negatively regulating the signals generated at the focal adhesions, through the direct dephosphorylation and inhibition of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Growth factor receptor signaling is also negatively regulated by PTEN, through the inhibition of the adaptor protein Shc. While some of the functions of PTEN have been elucidated, it is clear that there is much more to discover about the roles of this unique protein.",

Inactivation of only the TGF-β receptor type II, Tgfbr2, in the mouse liver (Tgfbr2(LKO)) had no overt phenotype, while inactivation of Pten alone (Pten(LKO)), resulted in the formation of both hepatocellular carcinomas and cholangiocarcinomas (CC). Interestingly, deletion of both Pten and Tgfbr2 (Pten(LKO);Tgfbr2(LKO)) in the mouse liver resulted in a dramatic shift in tumor type to predominantly CC. Assessment of the PI3K/PTEN/AKT pathway revealed increased phosphorylation of AKT and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β) in both the Pten(LKO) and Pten(LKO);Tgfbr2(LKO) mice, suggesting that this pathway is constitutively active regardless of the status of the TGF-β signaling pathway. However, phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase was observed in the liver of all three phenotypes (Tgfbr2(LKO), Pten(LKO), Pten(LKO);Tgfbr2(LKO)) indicating that the loss of Tgfbr2 and/or Pten leads to an increase in this signaling pathway. Analysis of markers of liver progenitor/stem cells revealed that the loss of TGF-β signaling resulted in increased expression of c-Kit and CD133. Furthermore, in addition to increased c-Kit and CD133, Scf and EpCam expression were also increased in the double knock-out mice. These results suggest that the alteration in tumor types between the Pten(LKO) mice and Pten(LKO);Tgfbr2(LKO) mice is secondary to the altered regulation of stem-cell features induced by the loss of TGF-β signaling.

We performed biological and biochemical studies to determine whether PTEN-deficient cancer cells are sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition of FRAP/mTOR by using the rapamycin derivative CCI-779. In vitro and in vivo studies of isogenic PTEN(+/+) and PTEN(-/-) mouse cells as well as human cancer cells with defined PTEN status showed that the growth of PTEN null cells was blocked preferentially by pharmacologic FRAP/mTOR inhibition. Enhanced tumor growth caused by constitutive activation of Akt in PTEN(+/+) cells also was reversed by CCI-779 treatment, indicating that FRAP/mTOR functions downstream of Akt in tumorigenesis. Loss of PTEN correlated with increased S6 kinase activity and phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 protein, providing evidence for activation of the FRAP/mTOR pathway in these cells. Differential sensitivity to CCI-779 was not explained by differences in biochemical blockade of the FRAP/mTOR pathway, because S6 phosphorylation was inhibited in sensitive and resistant cell lines.

When hetero-transplanted, these cells (designated As-CSC) formed highly pleomorphic, aggressive tumors with immature epithelial- and mesenchymal-like cells, suggesting a highly pluripotent cell of origin. Consistent with tumor-derived CSCs, As-CSCs formed abundant free-floating spheres enriched in CSC-like cells, as confirmed by molecular analysis and the fact that only these floating cells formed xeno-graft tumors. An early loss of NSC self-renewal gene expression (p63, ABCG2, BMI-1, SHH, OCT-4, NOTCH-1) during arsenite exposure was sub-sequently reversed as the tumor suppressor gene PTEN was progressively suppressed and the CSC-like phenotype acquired.;Arsenite transforms prostate epithelial stem/progenitor cells into CSC-like cells, indicating that it can produce CSCs from a model NSC population.",

The cytotoxic effects of compounds including curcumin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), dihydroartemisinin (DHA), irinotecan (CPT-11) and oxaliplatin (OXA) on cancer cells were determined using the MTT assay. Enhanced cytotoxicity of curcumin in PTEN-deficient CRC cells was observed, and this was confirmed using clonogenic assays. Apoptosis and cell cycle progression were analyzed by flow cytometry. Levels of apoptosis and cell cycle-related proteins were examined by Western blotting.;We developed an isogenic set of CRC cell lines that differed only in their PTEN status. Using this set of cell lines, we found that disruption of the PTEN gene had no effect on the sensitivity of CRC cells to 5-FU, CPT-11, DHA, or OXA, whereas PTEN disruption increased the sensitivity of CRC cells to curcumin. Loss of PTEN did not alter the curcumin-induced apoptosis in CRC cells. However, PTEN deficiency led to an altered pattern of curcumin-mediated cell cycle arrest. In HCT116 PTEN (+/+) cells, curcumin caused a G2/M phase arrest, whereas it caused a G0/G1 phase arrest in HCT116 PTEN (-/-) cells. Levels of cell cycle-related proteins were consistent with these respective patterns of cell cycle arrest.;Curcumin shows enhanced cytotoxicity toward PTEN-deficient cancer cells, suggesting that it might be a potential chemotherapeutic agent for cancers harboring PTEN mutations.",

Everolimus, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin, as well as the multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors sorafenib and sunitinib, has demonstrated a substantial therapeutic effect in various types of human cancer with moderate side-effects. Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 1 and 2, and of the tumor-suppressor protein phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) were evaluated in chemonaïve human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive and -negative squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and after exposure to everolimus, sorafenib or sunitinib.;p16-positive CERV196 and p16-negative HNSCC 11A and 14C cells were incubated with different drug concentrations for 48-192 h. Expression of VEGFR1 and -2 as well as PTEN were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and was compared to a chemonaïve control.;VEGFR1 and -2, as well as PTEN, were expressed in all three cell lines. Sunitinib, sorafenib and everolimus significantly reduced the expression of VEGFR1 and -2, especially in p16-positive CERV196 cells. Sunitinib appeared to be more effective in reducing VEGFR1 and -2 expression than sorafenib and everolimus. PTEN levels were remarkably lower in HPV-positive CERV196 cells. PTEN expression increased significantly under sunitinib and sorafenib in HNSCC 11A and CERV196 cells. Everolimus, on the other hand, led to a significant decrease of PTEN expression in these cell lines.;The tested drugs displayed a remarkable anti-angiogenic effect by inhibition of VEGFR1 and -2 expression. Sunitinib and sorafenib were able to increase PTEN expression, which might induce apoptosis of cancer cells.

AlbCrePten(flox/flox) mice showed massive hepatomegaly and steatohepatitis with triglyceride accumulation, a phenotype similar to human nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Adipocyte-specific genes were induced in mutant hepatocytes, implying adipogenic-like transformation of these cells. Genes involved in lipogenesis and beta-oxidation were also induced, possibly as a result of elevated levels of the transactivating factors PPARgamma and SREBP1c. Importantly, the loss of Pten function in the liver led to tumorigenesis, with 47% of AlbCrePten(flox/flox) livers developing liver cell adenomas by 44 weeks of age. By 74-78 weeks of age, 100% of AlbCrePten(flox/flox) livers showed adenomas and 66% had hepatocellular carcinomas. AlbCrePten(flox/flox) mice also showed insulin hypersensitivity. In vitro, AlbCrePten(flox/flox) hepatocytes were hyperproliferative and showed increased hyperoxidation with abnormal activation of protein kinase B and MAPK.

However, the signal initiating these p62-driven processes was previously unknown. Here, we show that p62 is phosphorylated via a cascade that includes MEK3/6 and p38δ and is driven by the PB1-containing kinase MEKK3. This phosphorylation results in the recruitment of TRAF6 to p62, the ubiquitination and activation of mTOR, and the regulation of autophagy and cell proliferation. Genetic inactivation of MEKK3 or p38δ mimics that of p62 in that it leads to inhibited growth of PTEN-deficient prostate organoids. Analysis of human prostate cancer samples showed upregulation of these three components of the pathway, which correlated with enhanced mTORC1 activation. ",

Here, we report evidence for a positive feedback regulation of the ErbB-PI3K/AKT cascade by SPRY2 loss in in vitro as well as pre-clinical in vivo models and clinical PC. Reduction in SPRY2 expression resulted in hyper-activation of PI3K/AKT signalling to drive proliferation and invasion by enhanced internalization of EGFR/HER2 and their sustained signalling at the early endosome in a PTEN-dependent manner. This involved p38 MAPK activation by PI3K to facilitate clathrin-mediated ErbB receptor endocytosis. Finally, in vitro and in vivo inhibition of PI3K suppressed proliferation and invasion, supporting PI3K/AKT as a target for therapy particularly in patients with PTEN-haploinsufficient-, low SPRY2- and ErbB-expressing tumours. In conclusion, SPRY2 is an important tumour suppressor in PC since its loss drives the PI3K/AKT pathway via functional interaction with the ErbB system.",

PTEN protein expression was reduced or absent in 62% of tumours but PTEN gene copy loss was present only in 4% of PSCCs.;EGFR, HER3 and HER4 but not HER2 are associated with penile carcinogenesis. HPV-negative tumours tend to express significantly more pEGFR than HPV-positive cancers and this expression correlates with pAkt protein, indicating EGFR as an upstream regulator of Akt signalling in PSCC. Conversely, HER3 expression is significantly more common in HPV-positive cases and positively correlates with cytoplasmic Akt1 expression. HER4 and PTEN protein expression are not related to HPV infection. Our results suggest that PSCC patients could benefit from therapies developed to target HER receptors.",

CpG island hypermethylation is another route to tumour suppressor gene inactivation, however, the literature regarding PTEN hypermethylation in cancer is controversial. Furthermore, investigation of the methylation status of the PTEN CpG island is challenging due to sequence homology with the PTEN pseudogene, PTENP1. PTEN shares a CpG island promoter with another gene known as KLLN. Here we present a thorough reinvestigation of the methylation status of the PTEN CpG island in DNA from colorectal, breast, ovarian, glioma, lung and haematological cancer cell lines.;Using a range of bisulphite-based PCR assays we investigated 6 regions across the PTEN CpG island. We found that regions 1-4 were not methylated in cancer cell lines (0/36). By allelic bisulphite sequencing and pyrosequencing methylation was detected in regions 5 and 6 in colorectal, breast and haematological cancer cell lines. However, methylation detected in this region was associated with the PTENP1 promoter and not the PTEN CpG island.;We show that methylation of the PTEN CpG island is a rare event in cancer cell lines and that apparent methylation most likely originates from homologous regions of the PTENP1 pseudogene promoter. Future studies should utilize assays that reliably discriminate between PTEN and PTENP1 to avoid data misinterpretation.",

Depletion of PTEN leads to loss of heterochromatic foci, decreased chromatin compaction, overexpression of heterochromatic genes, and reduced protein stability of heterochromatin protein 1 α. We found that the C-terminus of PTEN is required to maintain heterochromatin structure. Additionally, cancer-associated PTEN mutants lost their tumor-suppressor function when their heterochromatin structure was compromised.

Expectedly, a significant portion of these actions of P-Rex proteins must be related to their Rac regulatory properties. In addition, P-Rex proteins control signaling by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) route by interacting with PTEN and mTOR. The interaction with PTEN inhibits its phosphatase activity, leading to AKT activation. The interaction with mTOR may be important in nutrient-stimulated Rac activation and migration. In humans, several studies have implicated P-Rex proteins in the pathophysiology of various neoplasias. Thus, overexpression of P-Rex proteins has been linked to poor patient outcome in breast cancer and may facilitate metastatic dissemination of prostate cancer cells. In addition, whole-genome sequencing described P-Rex2 as a significantly mutated gene in melanoma. Furthermore, expression in melanocytes of mutated forms of P-Rex2 found in patients with melanoma showed the protumorigenic role of these P-Rex mutations in melanoma genesis. These findings open interesting opportunities for P-Rex targeting in cancer.

In addition, PTEN protein level was negatively correlated with that of paxillin in human colon cancer tissues.

We show now that these effects of IRS-1 are accompanied by serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and are inhibited by inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). We have confirmed the requirement for PI3K activity and serine phosphorylation by the use of IRS-1 mutants, expressed in LNCaP cells. Serine phosphorylation inhibits IGF-I-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of IRS-1, which is restored by the expression of wild-type PTEN or by inhibition of PI3K activity. Finally, IRS-1 in LNCaP cells co-immunoprecipitates with integrin alpha 5 beta 1, and the association is again IGF-I-independent.

PTEN encodes a multifunctional phosphatase, which negatively regulates cell growth, migration and survival via the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/AKT signalling pathway. Accordingly, Pten+/- mice develop various types of tumors including teratocarcinomas and teratomas. We have investigated PTEN expression in 60 bioptic specimens of germ cell tumors (32 seminomas, 22 embryonal carcinomas and six teratomas) and 22 intratubular germ cell neoplasias (ITGCN) adjacent to the tumors for PTEN protein and mRNA expression. In total, 10 testicular biopsies were used as controls. In the testis, PTEN was abundantly expressed in germ cells whereas it was virtually absent from 56% of seminomas as well as from 86% of embryonal carcinomas and virtually all teratomas. On the contrary, ITGCN intensely expressed PTEN, indicating that loss of PTEN expression is not an early event in testicular tumor development. The loss of PTEN expression occurs mainly at the RNA level as determined by in situ hybridization of cellular mRNA (17/22) but also it may involve some kind of post-transcriptional mechanisms in the remaining 25% of cases. Analysis of microsatellites D10S551, D10S541 and D10S1765 in GCTs (n=22) showed LOH at the PTEN locus at 10q23 in at least 36% of GCTs (three embryonal carcinoma, three seminoma, two teratoma); one seminoma and one embryonal (9%) carcinoma presented an inactivating mutation in the PTEN gene (2/22). Finally, we demonstrated that the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/AKT pathway, which is regulated by the PTEN phosphatase, is crucial in regulating the proliferation of the NT2/D1 embryonal carcinoma cells, and that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(kip1) is a key downstream target of this pathway.",

A subset of thyroid tumors have loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 10q22-23, a region harboring the gene responsible for Cowden disease, an autosomal dominant hamartoma syndrome associated with thyroid and breast tumors. PTEN/MMAC1/TEP1 codes for a dual-specificity phosphatase and is likely a tumor suppressor gene. We sought to determine the PTEN status in a series of epithelial thyroid neoplasms. We studied 95 sporadic thyroid tumors, of which 39 were papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs), 12 were follicular carcinomas, 9 were anaplastic carcinomas, 5 were Hürthle cell carcinomas, 21 were nonfunctioning follicular adenomas, and 9 were Hürthle cell adenomas. Direct sequencing of PCR-amplified products was performed for all nine exons of PTEN. Two polymorphic markers, one located in intron 8 and another, a dinucleotide repeat marker, AFMa086wg9, located within intron 2, were analyzed in paired blood-tumor DNA samples to assess hemizygous deletions of PTEN. We found a somatic frameshift mutation in one PTC, which was expected to generate a premature stop codon 2 amino acids downstream. Twenty-six % of informative benign tumors (four follicular adenomas and three Hürthle cell adenomas) and only 3 of 49 (6.1%) informative malignant tumors (one PTC, one follicular carcinoma, and one anaplastic carcinoma) showed evidence of hemizygous deletion of PTEN (P = 0.046). We conclude that a subset of thyroid tumors have somatic deletions of the PTEN gene, predominantly the benign forms, and that small intragenic mutations of PTEN are infrequent in thyroid tumors. We speculate that other mechanisms of PTEN inactivation, rather than small intragenic mutations, might occur in the hemizygously deleted samples and act as the \"Knudson second hit.\" Alternatively, other tumor suppressor genes mapping to chromosome 10q22-23 could be the actual targets for such deletions and thus represent the various hits in the pathway of multistep carcinogenesis.",

Although PTEN's lipid phosphatase activity is key to its tumor suppressive functions, it also dephosphorylates protein substrates and interacts with other key regulatory molecules, salient among them the tumor suppressor p53. Given the critical roles of PTEN in cellular homeostasis, it is not surprising that both PTEN expression levels and PTEN protein activities are tightly controlled by a complex conglomeration of molecules that regulate post-translational modifications, subcellular localization, transcriptional activation and transcriptional repression. As one of the most commonly altered molecules in human disease, PTEN plays an important role in a myriad of signaling cascades, and plays a central role in normal brain development and brain tumor pathogenesis. As such it influences prognosis of human cancer, predicts response to therapy, constitutes the lynchpin of genetic syndromes, and may underlie neurocognitive abnormalities such as autism spectrum disorders and Alzheimer's disease.

Importance of miR-21 in renal cell carcinomas is proposed from profiling studies using tumor tissue samples.

Using cultured renal carcinoma cells, we demonstrate enhanced expression of mature miR-21 along with pre-and pri-miR-21 by increased transcription compared to normal proximal tubular epithelial cells. Overexpression of miR-21 Sponge to quench endogenous miR-21 levels inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of renal cancer cells. In the absence of mutation in the PTEN tumor suppressor gene, PTEN protein levels are frequently downregulated in renal cancer. We show that miR-21 targets PTEN mRNA 3'untranslated region to decrease PTEN protein expression and augments Akt phosphorylation in renal cancer cells. Downregulation of PTEN as well as overexpression of constitutively active Akt kinase prevented miR-21 Sponge-induced inhibition of renal cancer cell proliferation and migration. Moreover, we show that miR-21 Sponge inhibited the inactivating phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor protein tuberin and attenuated TORC1 activation. Finally, we demonstrate that expression of constitutively active TORC1 attenuated miR-21 Sponge-mediated suppression of proliferation and migration of renal cancer cells.

Recent studies have also demonstrated that PTEN is a promising target in type II diabetes and obesity treatment. Using C-terminal PTEN sequence in pEG202-NLS as bait, yeast two-hybrid screening on Mouse Embryo, Colon Cancer, and HeLa cDNA libraries was carried out. Isolated positive clones were validated by mating assay and identified through automated DNA sequencing and BLAST database searches. Sequence analysis revealed a number of PTEN-binding proteins linking this phosphatase to a number of different signaling cascades, suggesting that PTEN may perform other functions besides tumor-suppressing activity in different cell types. In particular, the interplay between PTEN function and adipocyte-specific fatty-acid-binding protein FABP4 is of notable interest. The demonstrable tautology of PTEN to FABP4 suggested a role for this phosphatase in the regulation of lipid metabolism and adipocyte differentiation. This interaction was further studied using coimmunoprecipitation and gel-filtration assays. Finally, based on Biacore assay, we have calculated the K(D) of PTEN-FABP4 complex, which is around 2.8 microM.",

Pancreatic cancer cells migration was assessed after treatment with TLR4 agonist, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Moreover, two tumor suppressors, PTEN and MAP2K4, were detected. Then we predicted and proved the miRNA which targeted PTEN and MAP2K4.;We found that the expression of TLR4 was increased in pancreatic cancer cells and tissues. After treatment with LPS, the migration of pancreatic cancer cells was increased and the protein levels of two tumor suppressors, PTEN and MAP2K4, were inhibited. To investigate the possible mechanism, we checked the expression of miR-181a. The result showed that miR-181a was decreased by LPS. Furthermore, we predicted and confirmed that both PTEN and MAP2K4 were miR-181a targets.

Furthermore, MI-positive UECs (defined as tumors with detectable alterations at two or more different microsatellite loci) are significantly more likely to contain PTEN mutations than are MI-negative UECs. To determine whether PTEN inactivation is a relatively early event in endometrial tumorigenesis, we evaluated complex atypical hyperplasia (CAH), the direct precursor to UEC, for the presence of PTEN mutations. Mutations were present in 3 of 11 (27%) CAHs with synchronous UEC and in 4 of 18 (22%) CAHs that were not associated with invasive carcinoma. One case with synchronous CAH and UEC contained a germ-line PTEN mutation. In addition, we evaluated the same series of CAHs for MI. We identified four MI-positive CAHs with synchronous UEC but did not detect the MI phenotype in any CAHs without associated invasive carcinoma. A PTEN-mutant (germ-line mutation) MI-negative CAH was synchronous with a PTEN-mutant MI-positive UEC. These results suggest that mutation of PTEN can be an early event in the pathogenesis of UEC and may precede the development of the MI phenotype in a subset of cases.",

We investigated the relationship between proliferation activity and in situ expression of the telomerase RNA component (human telomerase RNA component, hTERC). In addition, in situ hybridization of the telomerase-associated proteins (telomerase-associated protein 1, TEP1; human telomerase reverse transcriptase, TERT), and MIB-1 immunohistochemistry for proliferation activity were performed, using the malignant tumors of adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant lymphoma, and somatic tissues of testis, endometrium, stomach, skin, and lymph nodes. In the somatic tissues, the stem cells expressed telomerase-associated RNA, but no proliferation activity. When the proliferation activity of the stem cells increased, however, the telomerase-associated expressions decreased.

The present study aims to evaluate the expression of PTEN in OSMF and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and correlate it with the pathogenesis and malignant transformation of OSMF. 60 cases total of OSMF (30) and OSCC (30) were subjected to immunohistochemistry using PTEN antibody. Ten normal oral mucosa (NOM) specimens were also stained as controls. There was progressive loss of PTEN expression from normal mucosa to OSMF and OSCC (p ≤ 0.001). Significant differences were observed for PTEN expression between NOM and OSMF, OSMF and OSCC as well as NOM and OSCC. Though a progressive loss of PTEN was noticed between early OSMF and advanced OSMF, the variation did not reach statistical significance (p ≥ 0.001). Data suggest that there is a significant loss of PTEN expression in OSMF as compared to normal oral mucosa and that this trend increased from OSMF to OSCC.

These consortium criteria were based on clinical experience and case reports in the existing literature, with their inherent selection biases. Although it was initially reported that approximately 80% of patients with Cowden syndrome had an identifiable germline PTEN mutation, more recent work has shown these diagnostic criteria to be far less specific.

Immunohistochemical staining was performed to detect the expression of mTOR and PTEN in paraffin-embedded gastric tissue sections obtained from 33 patients with gastric cancer and 30 normal controls.

By considering negative mTOR expression with positive PTEN expression as one group and negative PTEN expression with positive mTOR expression as the other, significant statistical differences were observed in various categories, including histological types and metastatic and clinical pathology stages, between the 2 groups (P<0.01 or 0.05). The results indicated that the expression levels of mTOR and PTEN were negatively correlated in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway.

Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) gene mutations were determined by whole genome amplification and direct sequencing. Carbonic anhydrase 9 (CAIX), a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) target, paired box gene 2 (PAX2), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 and glycogen synthase kinase 3-β (GSK3β) were immunohistochemically evaluated as members of the VHL protein (pVHL)- and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-controlled pathways. VHL mutations were identified in 3 of 12 (25%) tumors. Inactivated GSK3β, decreased PTEN expression and PAX2 positivity were observed in the vast majority of the multilocular cystic renal cell carcinomas. Strong nuclear staining of p27 was seen in 14 of 15 cases. Compared with multilocular cystic renal cell carcinomas, expression frequencies of PAX2, p-GSK3β, PTEN and CAIX were similar in a set of low-grade, early-stage clear cell renal cell carcinomas, whereas only 30% had strong p27 positivity. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that multilocular cystic renal cell carcinomas are related at the molecular level with clear cell renal cell carcinomas. Maintenance of a strong subcellular p27 expression in all multilocular cystic renal cell carcinomas analyzed may in part explain the excellent prognosis of these tumor patients.",

In previous studies with radiolabelled MoAb B72.3, metastatic liver lesions in patients with colon cancer appeared as areas of either increased (hot lesions) or decreased (cold lesions) activity, and extrahepatic lesions appeared as areas of increased activity. Eleven patients were enrolled in this study, and 12 MoAb imaging study results were correlated with computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging findings. The improved detection rates (number of hot lesions) in MoAb imaging were 48% (14/29) for hepatic metastases and 60% (6/10) for extrahepatic metastases. This represents a significant improvement in the rate of detection of metastatic disease of the liver in patients with recurrent colon cancer when compared to the rate in previous reports. Seventeen clinically unsuspected hepatic and extrahepatic areas of increased uptake were also identified on MoAb studies, and two of these areas were confirmed as metastatic disease at surgery. The rate of detection of extrahepatic metastases with 111In-SCN-Bz-DTPA MoAb B72.3 was also compared and found to be equal to the detection rates with other radiolabelled immunoconjugates. No major adverse side effects were noted during the administration of the MoAb. Four of nine patients tested had a positive anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) response 3 months after injection. These preliminary data indicate that this 111In-labelled immunoconjugate of MoAb B72.3 demonstrates an improvement in hepatic lesion detection rate than did previously reported preparations in patients with recurrent colon cancer.",

        "Doc_abstract":"In the female population in Asia, systematic investigation concerning alterations in cancer-related genes in breast carcinoma is rare, and the correlation among oncogene or suppressor gene expression with tumor cell apoptosis, cell cycle regulation and tumor cell autophagy remains to be clarified. In this study, a tissue microarray consisting of 360 individual samples from three different breast tissues was generated. By comparing the expression of the tumor-suppressor genes (BRCA1, BECN1, CCND1, PTEN and UVRAG) in ductal breast cancer and normal breast tissues, respectively, we were able to assign changes in the expression of these mRNAs to specific stages and allocate them to define the roles in the multi‑step process of breast carcinogenesis. Tumor-suppressor genes, such as BRCA1 and BECN1, usually had lower signals in the carcinomatous tissues (10.2 and 6.6%) compared to the normal tissues (31 and 32.6%), while stronger positive dots (positive cells >30%) usually existed in the normal tissues. The patients in the oldest age group had the lowest expression rate. Only BECN1 and CCND1 expression showed a significant association with patient age (p=0.030 and p=0.003). A significant association was observed between BRCA1 and BECN1 expression and tumor size (p=0.028 and p=0.021). BECN1 gene expression was positively correlated with UVRAG and PTEN expression (p=0.006 and p=0.000). CCND1 was negatively correlated with PTEN, BECN1 and BRCA1 expression (p=0.011, p=0.000 and p=0.000). Abnormal expression of BRCA1, BECN1, CCND1, PTEN and UVRAG may play a role in human breast carcinogenesis through dysregulated mRNA expression. Overexpressed CCND1 may shorten the G1 phase of the cell cycle, suppress cell apoptosis and contribute to the formation of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC).",

Here we demonstrate that PTEN destabilization is induced by EGFR- or oncogenic PI3K mutation-mediated AKT activation in cervical cancer. EGFR/PI3K/AKT-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of PTEN are dependent on the MKRN1 E3 ligase. These processes require the stabilization of MKRN1 via AKT-mediated phosphorylation. In cervical cancer patients with high levels of pAKT and MKRN1 expression, PTEN protein levels are low and correlate with a low 5-year survival rate. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PI3K/AKT signals enforce positive-feedback regulation by suppressing PTEN function. ",

Previous studies have shown that adiponectin can activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in myocytes, hepatocytes, and adipocytes, suggesting that adiponectin may suppress tumor development through AMPK activation and subsequent inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). However, the mechanisms through which adiponectin affects cancer cells are not understood, and it remains to be determined whether adiponectin is linked to the same downstream targets in all cells types, and in particular in cancer cells. In the present study, we demonstrate that while adiponectin stimulates AMPK in phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) deficient LNCaP prostate cancer cells, it also increases mTOR activity as assessed by phosphorylation of two downstream targets, p70 S6 kinase and ribosomal protein S6. This adiponectin stimulation of mTOR was mediated through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 kinase) and Akt activation. These results show that adiponectin can activate both AMPK and PI3 kinase/Akt pathways, and that cell type-specific factors such as PTEN status may determine which of these pathways will have the dominant effect on mTOR. Therefore, while it is possible that high endogenous adiponectin levels could be protective against cancer by direct mechanisms or indirect systemic mechanisms, our results indicate that adiponectin may also directly stimulate signaling pathways that enhance the growth of some tumors.",

Matrine effectively inhibited proliferation of several carcinoma cell lines, including melanoma V600EBRAF harboring M21 cells. Flow cytometry analysis showed Matrine induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in M21 cells dose-dependently. Apoptosis in M21 cells induced by Matrine was identified by Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) analysis and Annexin-V/FITC staining. Molecular mechanistic study suggested that Matrine upregulated both mRNA level and protein expression level of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN), leading to inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Downregulation of phosphor-Aktser473 by Matrine activated p21 and Bax, which contributed to G0/G1 cell cycle and apoptosis. Besides, Matrine enhanced the PI3K/Akt inhibition effects to inhibit the cell proliferation with PI3K inhibitor, LY2940002. In summary, our findings suggest Matrine is a promising antitumor drug candidate with its possible PTEN activation mechanisms for treating cancer diseases, such as melanomas. ",

KLLN, which shares a bidirectional promoter with PTEN, causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We previously identified germline hypermethylation of the KLLN promoter in 37% of PTEN mutation-negative CS/CS-like (CSL) patients. Patients with germline KLLN hypermethylation have an increased prevalence of breast and renal cancers when compared with PTEN mutation carriers. We have consequently sought to identify and characterize germline KLLN variants/mutations in CS/CSL and in apparently sporadic breast cancer patients. KLLN variants in CS/CSL patients are rare (1 of 136, 0.007%). Interestingly, among 438 breast cancer patients, 13 (3%) have germline KLLN variants when compared with none in 128 controls (P = 0.049). Patients with KLLN variants have a family history of breast cancer when compared with those without (P = 0.02). We demonstrate that germline KLLN variants dysregulate the cell cycle at G2. Of 24 breast carcinomas analyzed, 3 (13%) have somatic KLLN hemizygous deletions, with somatic loss of the wild-type allele in a patient with germline KLLN p.Leu119Leu. Of 452 breast carcinomas in The Cancer Genome Atlas project, 93 (21%) have KLLN hemizygous or homozygous deletions. This is the first study to associate germline KLLN variants with sporadic breast cancer and to recognize somatic KLLN deletions in breast carcinomas.

Germline mutations in PTEN and p53 tumor suppressor cause Cowden syndrome and Li-Fraumeni syndrome, respectively. There exists some phenotypic overlap in these syndromes, and they are associated with high risks of breast cancer. The tumor suppressor protein PTEN is a dual-specificity phosphatase which has protein phosphatase activity and lipid phosphatase activity that antagonizes PI3K activity. Cells that lack PTEN have constitutively higher levels of PIP3 and activated downstream targets. PTEN gene is recognized as one of the most frequently mutated or mutated in many human cancers. Li-Fraumeni syndrome results from germline mutations of the tumor suppressor p53 gene encoding a transcriptional factor able to regulate cell cycle and apoptosis when DNA damage occurs. The p53 protein cooperates with PTEN and might be an essential blockage in development of mammary tumors. Many findings have demonstrated that PTEN as well as p53 plays a critical role in DNA damage response. This review summarizes the function of PTEN and p53 in carcinogenic cell signaling. In addition, we will discuss the role of PTEN signaling through its interaction with p53 and MDM2 pathways for the potential implications in hereditary cancer prevention and therapeutic intervention.

However, the significance of the role of PTEN in Middle Eastern ethnic breast cancer has not been explored especially with the fact that breast cancer originating from this ethnic population tend to behave more aggressively than breast cancer in the west. In this study, we analyzed PTEN alteration in a tissue microarray format containing more than 1000 primary breast cancers with clinical follow-up data. Tissue Microarray sections were analyzed for protein expression and copy number change using immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Loss of PTEN immunostaining was observed in 77 % of the cases. PTEN loss was significantly associated with large tumor size (p = 0.0030), high grade (p = 0.0281), tumor recurrence (p = 0.0333), and triple-negative breast cancers (p = 0.0086).

FDA approval of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA; vorinostat), an inhibitor of histone deacetylase, for the treatment of hematological malignancies led to the clinical trials of vorinostat for advanced thyroid cancer. However, patients were resistant to vorinostat treatment. To understand the molecular basis of resistance, we tested the efficacy of SAHA in two mouse models of metastatic follicular thyroid cancer: Thrb(PV/PV) and Thrb(PV/PV)Pten(+/-) mice. In both, thyroid cancer is driven by overactivation of PI3K-AKT signaling. However, the latter exhibit more aggressive cancer progression due to haplodeficiency of the tumor suppressor, the Pten gene. SAHA had no effects on thyroid cancer progression in Thrb(PV/PV) mice, indicative of resistance to SAHA. Unexpectedly, thyroid cancer progressed in SAHA-treated Thrb(PV/PV)Pten(+/-) mice with accelerated occurrence of vascular invasion, anaplastic foci, and lung metastasis. Molecular analyses showed further activated PI3K-AKT in thyroid tumors of SAHA-treated Thrb(PV/PV)Pten(+/-) mice, resulting in the activated effectors, p-Rb, CDK6, p21(Cip1), p-cSrc, ezrin, and matrix metalloproteinases, to increase proliferation and invasion of tumor cells. Single-molecule DNA analysis indicated that the wild-type allele of the Pten gene was progressively lost, whereas carcinogenesis progressed in SAHA-treated Thrb(PV/PV)Pten(+/-) mice. Thus, this study has uncovered a novel mechanism by which SAHA-induced loss of the tumor suppressor Pten gene to promote thyroid cancer progression. Effectors downstream of the Pten loss-induced signaling may be potential targets to overcome resistance of thyroid cancer to SAHA. ",

Preliminary findings reported after 5 years of follow-up showed that escalated-dose conformal radiotherapy improved biochemical progression-free survival. Based on the sample size calculation, we planned to analyse overall survival when 190 deaths occurred; this target has now been reached, after a median 10 years of follow-up.;RT01 was a phase 3, open-label, international, randomised controlled trial enrolling men with histologically confirmed T1b-T3a, N0, M0 prostate cancer with prostate specific antigen of less than 50 ng/mL. Patients were randomly assigned centrally in a 1:1 ratio, using a computer-based minimisation algorithm stratifying by risk of seminal vesicle invasion and centre to either the control group (64 Gy in 32 fractions, the standard dose at the time the trial was designed) or the escalated-dose group (74 Gy in 37 fractions). Neither patients nor investigators were masked to assignment. All patients received neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy for 3-6 months before the start of conformal radiotherapy, which continued until the end of conformal radiotherapy. The coprimary outcome measures were biochemical progression-free survival and overall survival. All analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. Treatment-related side-effects have been reported previously. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN47772397.;Between Jan 7, 1998, and Dec 20, 2001, 862 men were registered and 843 subsequently randomly assigned: 422 to the escalated-dose group and 421 to the control group.

We previously demonstrated that Ishikawa cells do not possess functional PTEN protein because of protein truncations.

Doxorubicin is a commonly used anticancer drug in endometrial carcinoma. The cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin was evaluated using the methyl thiazoleterazolium (MTT) assay. We used the Hoechst 33258 staining to confirm the induction of apoptosis. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis were performed to evaluate the effects of doxorubicin on phosphorylation of Bcl-2 antagonist of cell death (Bad) and protein kinase B (Akt/PKB). Doxorubicin induced death of all cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, but the death was more significant in PTEN-expressing clones than in parent Ishikawa cells. A low concentration of doxorubicin (0.1 muM) did not affect apoptosis in PTEN-null Ishikawa cells, but it induced apoptosis in PTEN-expressing clones. A high concentration (1 microM) induced apoptosis in all cell lines, but the percentages of apoptotic cells were higher in PTEN-expressing clones than in parent Ishikawa cells. In the clones, phospho-Akt/PKB and phospho-Bad (Ser-136) were downregulated. Doxorubicin reduced the levels of phospho-Akt/PKB and phospho-Bad (Ser-136) in all the cell lines, but the reduction was most significant in the PTEN-expressing clones.

PTEN-induced cells with contact inhibition exhibit G0-G1 cell-cycle arrest, and the Ki-67 labeling index is reduced. These changes are canceled by transfection of a double-stranded short-interfering RNA against the PTEN gene.

Mutations were detected in 3 of the 33 (9%) ovarian cancers: 2 cases with double mutations and 1 case with a mutation on 1 allele accompanied by deletions on both alleles in the poly T tract preceding the splice acceptor site in intron 7. An intragenic deletion was detected in 1 of the 7 (14%) ovarian cancer cell lines. PTEN mutations were detected not only in the endometrioid type but also in the serous and mucinous types of ovarian cancer. However, PTEN was not mutated in the 12 tumors that showed AI of the PTEN locus. Our results suggest that the PTEN gene plays an important role in the development of a subset but diverse histological types of ovarian tumors. However, it is possible that another tumor-suppressor gene in the close vicinity of the PTEN gene is also inactivated by AI of the 10q23.3 region.",

We further show that ectopic expression of Fgf10 causes skin papillomas, whereas Pten deletion-induced skin tumors are inhibited by epidermal deletion of Fgfr2.

However, the response and molecular mechanism of breast cancer cells exposed to Tα1 remain unclear. PTEN, a tumor suppressor gene, is frequently mutated in a variety of human cancers. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the biological roles of PTEN in the growth inhibition of human breast cancer cells exposed to Tα1. Using wild-type and mutant PTEN-expressing cells, we found a strong correlation between PTEN status and Tα1-mediated growth inhibition of breast cancer cells. The growth inhibition effect was more pronounced in breast cancer cells in which Tα1 enhanced PTEN expression, whereas endogenous PTEN knockdown reversed the growth inhibition effect of Tα1 in breast cancer cells. Further investigation revealed that PTEN up-regulation, which was induced by Tα1, can inhibit the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, leading to the growth inhibition of breast cancer cells. The addition of the synergy between Tα1 and the inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR activation could strongly block cell viability in PTEN down-regulated breast cancer cells. PTEN-overexpressing cells not only up-regulated Bax and cleaved caspase-3/9 and PARP expression but also down-regulated Bcl-2 compared to the treatment with Tα1 alone. Together these findings suggest that PTEN mediates Tα1-induced apoptosis through the mitochondrial death cascade and inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in breast cancer cells. ",

However, the side-effects of resveratrol stimulation are of concern due to the high doses administered to humans. This study investigated the effects of resveratrol on the mRNA expression of pten and bcl-xl in HepG2 cells using semi-quantitative and quantitative PCR. This study demonstrated that 200 µmol/l resveratrol stimulation for 12 h resulted in the inhibition of HepG2 proliferation, reduced pten and increased bcl-xl mRNA expression.

Our current study firstly revealed that Hes1 upregulation in a cohort of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) biopsies is significantly associated with the EMT, invasive and metastatic phenotypes of cancer. In the present study, we found that Hes1 overexpression triggered EMT-like cellular marker alterations of NPC cells, whereas knockdown of Hes1 through shRNA reversed the EMT-like phenotypes, as strongly supported by Hes1-mediated EMT in NPC clinical specimens described above. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments demonstrated that Hes1 promoted the migration and invasion of NPC cells in vitro. In addition, exogenous expression of Hes1 significantly enhanced the metastatic ability of NPC cells in vivo. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed that Hes1 inhibited PTEN expression in NPC cells through binding to PTEN promoter region. Increased Hes1 expression and decreased PTEN expression were also observed in a cohort of NPC biopsies. Additional studies demonstrated that Hes1-induced EMT-like molecular changes and increased motility and invasion of NPC cells were mediated by PTEN.

PTEN is a susceptibility gene for a number of disorders, including breast and thyroid cancer. Activation of PPARgamma through agonists increases functional PTEN protein levels that subsequently induces apoptosis and inhibits cellular growth, which suggests that PPARgamma may be a tumor suppressor.

However, miR-32 knock-down inhibited these processes in HCT-116 cells and enhanced the expression of PTEN protein. In addition, we further identified PTEN as the functional downstream target of miR-32 by directly targeting the 3'-UTR of PTEN.;Our results demonstrated that miR-32 was involved in tumorigenesis of CRC at least in part by suppression of PTEN.",

Although involvement of PTEN in tumorigenesis was shown in different tissues, no data are available concerning PTEN activity in response to antineoplastic agents. Therefore, we assayed the PTEN activity exposed to either blank medium or the commonly used anti-cancer drugs cisplatin, adriamycin or paclitaxel, respectively, in three different concentrations. PTEN activity was determined using the Malachite Green assay basing upon dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) by the PTEN enzyme and subsequent determination of inorganic phosphate released. Although the three different anti-cancer drugs assayed act with different cellular modes, the antineoplastics influenced PTEN activity in a similar manner: at low concentrations tested all three antineoplastics significantly increased PTEN activity. However, increasing drug concentrations exhibited a decline but not a total loss of PTEN activity. The data indicate that PTEN activity is increased following cytotoxic drug exposure and, thereby, exhibits its suppressive function. However, the decrease of PTEN activity in response to increasing drug concentrations suggests an aberration of total functional activity. As far as the regulative checkpoint PTEN is abolished, tumor cells might evade cell death pathways resulting in increased proliferation of cancer cells. This might be a general event in refractory tumor cells surviving chemotherapy.",

Defects of posttranslational modifications of proteins are linked to a number of important diseases, such as cancer. This review will update our knowledge on the critical role of posttranscriptional regulation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and its activities and the functional impact on cancer behaviors. PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene that occupies a key position in regulating cell growth, proliferation, apoptosis, mobility, signal transduction, and other crucial cellular processes. The activity and function of PTEN are regulated by coordinated epigenetic, transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and posttranslational modifications. In particular, PTEN is subject to phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, somoylation, acetylation, and active site oxidation. Posttranslational modifications of PTEN can dynamically change its activity and function. Deficiency in the posttranslational regulation of PTEN leads to abnormal cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and adhesion, which are associated with cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis. With increasing information on how PTEN is regulated by multiple mechanisms and networked proteins, its exact role in cancer initiation, growth, and metastasis will be revealed. PTEN and its functionally related proteins may represent useful targets for the discovery of new anticancer drugs, and gene therapy and the therapeutic potentials should be fully explored. ",

In this study, we demonstrated that the oncogenic protein lysine methyltransferase SET and MYND domain containing 2 (SMYD2) methylates PTEN at lysine 313 in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of SMYD2 suppressed the cell growth of breast cancer cells and attenuated phosphorylation levels of AKT, indicating that SMYD2-mediated methylation negatively regulates PTEN tumor suppressor activity and results in activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT pathway. Furthermore, PTEN protein with lysine 313 substitution diminished phosphorylation of PTEN at serine 380, which is known to inactivate tumor suppressor functions of PTEN.

We further focused on whether increased SAM with DNMT1 overexpression in TAMR-MCF-7 cells lead to aberrant methylation of the PTEN gene promoter and its therapeutic potential. Methylation-specific PCR analyses revealed that two sites within the PTEN promoters were methylated in TAMR-MCF-7 cells, which resulted in down-regulation of PTEN expression and increase in Akt phosphorylation. Both the loss of PTEN expression and the increased Akt phosphorylation in TAMR-MCF-7 cells were completely reversed by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza), a DNMT inhibitor. 5-Aza inhibited the basal cell proliferation rate of TAMR-MCF-7 cells and intraperitoneal injection of 5-Aza significantly suppressed TAMR-MCF-7 tumor growth in a xenograft study. Immunohistochemistry showed that PTEN expression in TAM-resistant human breast cancer tissues was lower than in TAM-responsive cases.

In the current study we disposed of 80 well-characterized ILC cases. Gene amplification of cyclin D1 (CCND1) and c-erbB2-encoding gene (ERBB2) and expression of their gene products were studied by differential polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry, respectively. A comprehensive point mutation study of the phosphatase and tensin homolog tumor suppressor gene (PTEN) was pursued by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP)/sequencing analysis. The CCND1 gene was rarely amplified in ILC in spite of showing overexpression of the protein in 41% of tumors. Hence, unlike IDC, increase in gene dosage did not account for the protein excess. PTEN mutations were detected in ILC (truncating mutations) in around 2% of the tumors. Unlike IDC, ILC did not display ERBB2 overexpression and expression of the transcription factor E2F1 correlated inversely with tumor grade. The observed discrepancy in the pattern of the human oncogenes CCND1 and ERBB2, which are involved in the process of carcinogenesis of ductal tumors, appears to suggest a different molecular basis for development and progression of ILC.",

PTEN, a tumor suppressor gene, has been demonstrated to be able to reverse cisplatin-resistance in ovarian cancer cell line C13K. However, the downstream molecules of PTEN involved in the resistance-reversing effect have not been completely clarified. Therefore, we screened the downstream molecules of PTEN and studied their interactions in C13K ovarian cancer cells using a 3D culture model. Firstly, we constructed an ovarian cancer cell line stably expressing PTEN, C13K/PTEN. MTT assay showed that overexpression of PTEN enhanced the sensitivity of C13K cells to cisplatin, but not to paclitaxel. Then we examined the differently expressed proteins that interacted with PTEN in C13K/PTEN cells with or without cisplatin treatment by co-immunoprecipitation. KRT10 was identified as a differently expressed protein in cisplatin-treated C13K/PTEN cells. Further study confirmed that cisplatin could induce upregulation of KRT10 mRNA and protein in C13K/PTEN cells and there was a directly interaction between KRT10 and PTEN. Forced expression of KRT10 in C13K cells also enhanced cisplatin-induced proliferation inhibition and apoptosis of C13K cells. In addition, KRT10 siRNA blocked cisplatin-induced proliferation inhibition of C13K/PTEN cells. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that KRT10 is a downstream molecule of PTEN which improves cisplatin-resistance of ovarian cancer and forced KRT10 overexpression may also act as a therapeutic method for overcoming MDR in ovarian cancer.

To explore the general internist's contribution to disease prevention, the authors quantified the extent to which opportunities for prevention were addressed by the general internal medicine (GIM) service in an acute care teaching hospital in Calgary.;The authors interviewed 100 adult patients before discharge from the hospital's GIM service between May 14, 1997, and Dec. 2, 1997. The number of potential opportunities for preventive intervention were identified for each patient from 10 possible interventions recommended by the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination (now the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care): breast cancer screening, Papanicolaou smear for cervical cancer, counselling on menopausal hormone replacement therapy, digital rectal examination for prostate cancer, smoking cessation counselling, cholesterol measurement, therapy or monitoring for hypertension, influenza vaccination, pneumococcal vaccination and colorectal cancer screening. The authors determined which interventions the patient had undergone before the current admission to hospital and, using patient recall and postdischarge medical chart review, which opportunities for intervention were addressed by the GIM service during the current admission. An opportunity for preventive intervention was considered as addressed by the GIM service if it was performed during the current admission or if the general internist informed the patient or the patient's family physician of the need for such intervention in the near future.;Among the 10 preventive interventions considered, a mean of 3.8 potential opportunities for prevention were identified for each patient. Of these, 46.5% had been addressed before the current admission, and 8.7% were addressed by the GIM service during the admission. Therefore, at the time of discharge, a mean of 55.2% of opportunities had been addressed. Among the opportunities not previously addressed, the GIM service most frequently addressed digital rectal examination for prostate cancer and cholesterol measurement.;General internists are discharging patients without sufficiently addressing opportunities for disease prevention. Preventive care protocols may be needed to limit the frequency of missed opportunities for prevention in patients admitted to tertiary care GIM services.",

However, identical mutations in the PTEN gene may lead to different symptoms that have traditionally been described as different disorders, such as Cowden disease, Lhermitte-Duclos disease, and Bannayan-Zonana syndromes. This lack of genotype-phenotype correlation prompted us to directly test the possible effects of genetic background or modifier genes on PTEN-controlled tumorigenesis using genetically engineered mouse models. In this study, we generated two animal models in which either exon 5 (Pten(Delta5)) or promoter to exon 3 (Pten(-)) of the murine Pten gene were deleted and compared phenotypes associated with individual mutations on two genetic backgrounds. We found that the onset and spectrum of tumor formation depend significantly on the genetic background but less on the type of mutation generated.

Because inactivation of PTEN is a somatic event, PTEN mutations represent an important genetic difference between cancer cells and normal cells and therefore a potential anticancer drug target. However, it remains a substantial challenge to identify compounds that target loss-of-function events such as mutations of tumor suppressors. In an effort to identify small molecules that preferentially kill cells with mutations of PTEN, the authors developed and implemented a high-throughput, paired cell-based screen composed of parental HCT116 cells and their PTEN gene-targeted derivatives. From 138 758 compounds tested, two hits were identified, and one, N'-[(1-benzyl-1H-indol-3-yl)methylene]benzenesulfonohydrazide (CID1340132), was further studied using a variety of cell-based models, including HCT116, MCF10A, and HEC1A cells with targeted deletion of either their PTEN or PIK3CA genes. Preferential killing of PTEN and PIK3CA mutant cells was accompanied by DNA damage, inhibition of DNA synthesis, and apoptosis.

Here we show that PTEN associates with p85, the regulatory subunit of PI3K. Using newly generated antibodies, we demonstrate that this PTEN-p85 association involves the unphosphorylated form of PTEN engaged within the PAC and also includes the p110beta isoform of PI3K. The PTEN-p85 association is enhanced by trastuzumab treatment and linked to a decline in AKT phosphorylation in some ERBB2-amplified breast cancer cell lines.

We have recently shown significantly increased expression of miR-21 in renal tumors and that this miRNA contributes to the proliferation of renal cancer cells in culture. However, the mechanism by which miR-21 regulates renal cancer cell proliferation is poorly understood. Addiction to constitutive NFκB activity is hallmark of many cancers including renal cancer. Using miR-21 Sponge in renal cancer cells to block endogenous function of miR-21, we show inhibition of phosphorylation of p65 subunit of NFκB, IKKβ and IκB, which results in attenuation of NFκB transcriptional activity. Subtle reduction in the tumor suppressor PTEN has been linked to various malignancies. We showed previously that miR-21 targeted PTEN in renal cancer cells. Inhibition of PTEN by siRNAs restored miR-21 Sponge-induced suppression of phosphorylation of p65, IKKβ, IκB and NFκB transcriptional activity along with reversal of miR-21 Sponge-reduced phosphorylation of Akt. Expression of constitutively active Akt protected against miR-21 Sponge- and PTEN-mediated decrease in p65/IKKβ/IκB phosphorylation and NFκB transcriptional activity. Furthermore, IKKβ and p65 were required for miR-21-induced renal cancer cell proliferation. Interestingly, miR-21 controlled the expression of cyclin D1 through NFκB-dependent transcription. Finally, we demonstrate that miR-21-regulated renal cancer cell proliferation is mediated by cyclin D1 and CDK4.

Stability of the labeled conjugates in plasma at 37 degrees C was assessed. Biodistribution and therapeutic efficacy of labeled cG250 were compared in nude mice with SK-RC-52 human RCC xenografts.;Both SCN-Bz-DTPA and DOTA were stable in vitro (<5% release of the radiolabel during 14 and 21 d of incubation) and in vivo (uptake in bone </= 1.5 percentage injected dose per gram [%ID/g] at 7 d after injection) when used to label (88)Y or (177)Lu to cG250. The DOTA conjugate was slightly but significantly more stable than SCN-Bz-DTPA at 7 d after injection. In vivo, these cG250 preparations showed high tumor uptake (70 +/- 15 %ID/g +/- SD at 7 d after injection). Maximum tumor uptake for (125)I-cG250 and (186)Re-mercaptoacetyltriglycine-(MAG3)-cG250 (<20 +/- 3 %ID/g +/- SD) was reached at 3 d after injection and was much lower in comparison with cG250 labeled with the residualizing radionuclides. Because the highest specific activities could be prepared using SCN-Bz-DTPA, and relatively low protein doses of cG250 could be administered without saturating the tumor, cG250-SCN-Bz-DTPA conjugates were used in RIT studies. In RIT experiments at maximum tolerated dose, tumor growth was delayed most effectively by cG250 labeled with (177)Lu, next most effectively by (90)Y and (186)Re (which were approximately equal), and least by (131)I (delayed by approximately 185, 125, 90, and 25 d, respectively). The best median survival (300 d) was observed for (177)Lu-SCN-Bz-DTPA-cG250. Median survival for control groups was <150 d.;DOTA-conjugated radiolabeled antibodies were the most stable radioimmunoconjugates in vitro and in vivo as manifested by the lowest bone uptake.

Identifying DCIS and invasive cancer specific epigenetic lesions and understanding how these epigenetic changes are involved in triggering tumour progression is important for a better understanding of which lesions are at risk of becoming invasive.;Quantitative DNA methylation analysis of ABCB1, CDKN2A/p16INK4a, ESR1, FOXC1, GSTP1, IGF2, MGMT, MLH1, PPP2R2B, PTEN and RASSF1A was performed by pyrosequencing in a series of 27 pure DCIS, 28 small invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCs), 34 IDCs with a DCIS component and 5 normal breast tissue samples. FOXC1, ABCB1, PPP2R2B and PTEN were analyzed in 23 additional normal breast tissue samples. Real-Time PCR expression analysis was performed for FOXC1.;Aberrant DNA methylation was observed in all three diagnosis groups for the following genes: ABCB1, FOXC1, GSTP1, MGMT, MLH1, PPP2R2B, PTEN and RASSF1A. For most of these genes, methylation was already present at the DCIS level with the same frequency as within IDCs. For FOXC1 significant differences in methylation levels were observed between normal breast tissue and invasive tumours (P < 0.001). The average DNA methylation levels were significantly higher in the pure IDCs and IDCs with DCIS compared to pure DCIS (P = 0.007 and P = 0.001, respectively). Real-time PCR analysis of FOXC1 expression from 25 DCIS, 23 IDCs and 28 normal tissue samples showed lower gene expression levels of FOXC1 in both methylated and unmethylated tumours compared to normal tissue (P < 0.001). DNA methylation levels of FOXC1, GSTP1, ABCB1 and RASSF1A were higher in oestrogen receptor (ER) positive vs. ER negative tumours; whereas methylation levels of FOXC1, ABCB1, PPP2R2B and PTEN were lower in tumours with a TP53 mutation.;Quantitative methylation analysis identified ABCB1, FOXC1, PPP2R2B and PTEN as novel genes to be methylated in DCIS. In particular, FOXC1 showed a significant increase in the methylation frequency in invasive tumours. Low FOXC1 gene expression in both methylated and unmethylated DCIS and IDCs indicates that the loss of its expression is an early event during breast cancer progression.",

The transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) has also been implicated as a tumor suppressor pertinent to a range of neoplasias, including breast cancer. We previously demonstrated that lovastatin may signal through PPARgamma and directly upregulate PTEN expression at the transcriptional level. In our current study, we show that simvastatin, pravastatin and fluvastatin can induce PTEN expression in a dose-dependent manner. This resulted from an increase in PTEN mRNA indicating transcriptional upregulation. In addition, we observed, for the first time, that upregulation of sterol response element-binding protein (SREBP), known to induce PPARgamma expression, can increase PTEN expression. Using reporter assays, we observed that both the statins and SREBP could specifically induce PPARgamma-mediated transcription. However, the statins do not appear to signal through SREBP. Furthermore, our results indicate that SREBP utilizes PPARgamma's transcriptional activity to induce PTEN transcription, whereas the statins signal through PPARgamma's protein activity to upregulate PTEN expression. Overall, our observations suggest that statins signal through another transcription factor, in a PPARgamma-dependent manner, which in turn induces PTEN transcription. We, therefore, studied the full-length PTEN promoter through serial deletion reporter assays and electromobility shift assays and identified a region between -854 and -791 that binds an as-yet-unidentified transcription factor, through which the statins induce PTEN expression. Since PTEN is constitutively active, our data indicate it may be worthwhile to examine statin and SREBP stimulation as mechanisms to increase PTEN expression for therapeutic and preventative strategies in cancer, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease.",

To determine the interplay between Mig-6 and the PTEN/phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathway during endometrial tumorigenesis, we generated mice with Mig-6 and Pten conditionally ablated in progesterone receptor-positive cells (PR(cre/+)Mig-6(f/f)Pten(f/f); Mig-6(d/d)Pten(d/d)). The ablation of both Mig-6 and Pten dramatically accelerated the development of endometrial cancer compared with the single ablation of either gene. The epithelium of Mig-6(d/d)Pten(d/d) mice showed a significant decrease in the number of apoptotic cells compared with Pten(d/d) mice. The expression of the estrogen-induced apoptotic inhibitors Birc1 was significantly increased in Mig-6(d/d)Pten(d/d) mice. We identified extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) as an MIG-6 interacting protein by coimmunoprecipitation and demonstrated that the level of ERK2 phosphorylation was increased upon Mig-6 ablation either singly or in combination with Pten ablation.

        "Doc_abstract":"Recent studies have found a higher frequency of the PTEN tumor-suppressor gene alterations in invasive bladder carcinoma than in superficial disease, suggesting that PTEN is important in this process. A role of PTEN in bladder cancer invasion is further suggested by the fact that PTEN is a regulator of cell motility, a necessary component of tumor invasion. However, it is unknown whether PTEN is mechanistically involved in 'in vivo' tumor invasion or merely an epiphenomenon and, if the former is true, whether this process is dependent on its protein or lipid phosphatase activities. To address these issues, we stably transfected several commonly used human bladder cancer cell lines with known invasive phenotypes with either wild-type PTEN constructs or those deficient in the lipid phosphatase (G129E) or both protein and lipid phosphatase (G129R) activities. Here we show that chemotaxis was inhibited by both the wild-type and G129E mutant of PTEN but not by G129R-transfected cells. Using a novel organotypic in vitro invasion assay, we evaluated the impact of wild-type and mutant PTEN transgene expression on the invasive ability of T24T, a human bladder cancer cell line with a functionally impaired PTEN. Results indicate that the G129E mutant blocks invasion as efficiently as wild-type PTEN transfection. In contrast to the wild-type gene, this mutant has no effect on cell clonogenicity in agar. To further establish the role of PTEN in tumor invasion, we evaluated vector- and PTEN-transfected T24T cells in an orthotopic in vivo assay that faithfully reproduces human disease. Microscopic examination of murine bladders at the completion of this experiment parallels the results obtained with the organotypic assay. Our results are the first demonstration: (1) that the inhibitory effects of PTEN on cell motility translate into suppression of in vivo invasion; (2) that PTEN can inhibit tumor invasion even in the absence of its lipid phosphatase activity; (3) how organotypic in vitro approaches can be used as surrogates of in vivo invasion allowing rapid dissection of molecular processes leading to this phenotype while reducing the number of animals used in research.",

PTEN inhibits the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway and downstream functions, including activation of Akt/protein kinase B (PKB), cell survival, and cell proliferation in tumor cells carrying mutant- or deletion-type PTEN. In such tumor cells, enforced expression of PTEN decreases cell proliferation through cell-cycle arrest at G1 phase accompanied, in some cases, by induction of apoptosis. More recently, the tumor-suppressive effect of PTEN has been reported in ovarian and thyroid tumors that are wild type for PTEN. In the present study, we examined the tumor-suppressive effect of PTEN in human colorectal cancer cells that are wild type for PTEN. Adenoviral-mediated transfer of PTEN (Ad-PTEN) suppressed cell growth and induced apoptosis significantly in colorectal cancer cells (DLD-1, HT29, and SW480) carrying wtPTEN than in normal colon fibroblast cells (CCD-18Co) carrying wtPTEN. This suppression was induced through downregulation of the Akt/PKB pathway, dephosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and cell-cycle arrest at the G2/M phase, but not the G1 phase. Furthermore, treatment of human colorectal tumor xenografts (HT-29, and SW480) with Ad-PTEN resulted in significant (P=0.01) suppression of tumor growth. These results indicate that Ad-PTEN exerts its tumor-suppressive effect on colorectal cancer cells through inhibition of cell-cycle progression and induction of cell death.

To test the hypothesis, we compared the PTEN knockout (PTENKO) induced uterine pathology in heterozygous PTENKO and combined heterozygous PTEN and complete AR knockout (PTENARKO) female mice. PTENKO induced uterine pathology was significantly reduced by AR inactivation with severe macroscopic uterine pathology present in 21% of PTENARKO vs 46% of PTENKO at a median age of 45 weeks. This could be due to reduced stroma ERα expression in PTENARKO compared to PTENKO uterus, while AR inactivation did not modify PTEN or P-AKT levels. Unexpectedly, while progesterone (P4) is assumed protective in uterine cancers, serum P4 was significantly higher in PTENKO females compared to WT, ARKO, and PTENARKO females consistent with more corpora lutea in PTENKO ovaries.

ATLL cells do not harbour genetic alterations in PTEN and PI3KCA but express high levels of PTEN that is highly phosphorylated at its C-terminal tail. Here we report a mechanism for the N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2)-dependent regulation of PTEN phosphatase activity via the dephosphorylation of PTEN at the Ser380, Thr382 and Thr383 cluster within the C-terminal tail. We show that NDRG2 is a PTEN-binding protein that recruits protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) to PTEN. The expression of NDRG2 is frequently downregulated in ATLL, resulting in enhanced phosphorylation of PTEN at the Ser380/Thr382/Thr383 cluster and enhanced activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway. Given the high incidence of T-cell lymphoma and other cancers in NDRG2-deficient mice, PI3K-AKT activation via enhanced PTEN phosphorylation may be critical for the development of cancer. ",

The hSulf-1 is a heparin-degrading endosulfatase, which can inhibit the heparin binding growth factor-mediated signaling transduction into cells. Therefore, miR-21-mediated suppression of both hSulf-1 and PTEN led to activation of AKT/ERK pathways and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HCC cells, and finally enhance the activity of HCC cell proliferation and movement and promote HCC xenograft tumor growth in mouse models.

        "Doc_abstract":"In human endometrial cancer, the fourth most common cancer in women, tumor suppressor phosphatase tensin homologue (PTEN) is frequently mutated. In the presence of a mutated PTEN protein, Akt phosphorylation levels are increased leading to the activation of this survival pathway. Numerous studies indicated that COX-2 is inappropriately induced and up-regulated in a number of malignant cancer cells. COX-2 plays an important role in tumor cell biology, taking part actively in angiogenesis particularly via the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The present study was undertaken to determine the involvement of PI 3-K/Akt pathway in the regulation of COXs expression and PGE2 synthesis. Three different human endometrial cancer cell lines known to have wild-type PTEN (HEC 1-A) or a mutated inactive PTEN protein (RL 95-2 and Ishikawa) were used for these studies. Results showed that Akt phosphorylation was high in mutated PTEN cells. RT-PCR studies revealed that Akt1 and Akt2 were the regulated forms whereas Akt3 mRNA was nearly undetectable. COX-2 mRNA expression and protein levels were high in these cells compared to wild-type PTEN cells as demonstrated by RT-PCR and Western analysis respectively. PGE2 production was higher in mutated-PTEN expressing phospho-Akt and COX-2 compared to wild-type PTEN cells. Inhibition of PI 3-K with Wortmannin and LY294002 blocked Akt phosphorylation and inhibited expression of COX-2 in mutated-PTEN cells. Inhibition of Akt phosphorylation with specific PI 3-K inhibitors and down-regulation of COX-2 increased apoptosis in human endometrial cancer cells. Likewise, transfection of mutated-PTEN cells with a dominant negative Akt vector, resulted in COX-2 down-regulation and activation of apoptosis, as demonstrated by Hoechst nuclear staining. On the opposite, activation of Akt using a constitutively active expression vector, resulted in the up-regulation of COX-2 protein expression. Specific inhibition of COX-2 with NS-398 induced apoptosis in COX-2 expressing human endometrial cancer cells. It is concluded that the PI 3-K/Akt survival pathway is involved in the regulation of COX-2 and PGE2 synthesis in human endometrial cancer cells.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Endometrioid endometrial cancer arises through a gradual series of histological changes, each accompanied by specific alterations in gene expression and activity. Activation of the Wnt-β-catenin pathway and loss of PTEN activity are frequently observed in endometrial cancers. However, the specific roles played by alterations in these pathways in the initiation and progression of endometrial cancer are currently unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of loss of Pten and Apc gene function in the mouse endometrium by employing tissue-specific and inducible mutant alleles, followed by immunohistochemical (IHC) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis of their corresponding cancerous lesions. Loss of the Apc function in the endometrium leads to cytoplasmic and nuclear β-catenin accumulation in association with uterine hyperplasia and squamous cell metaplasia, but without malignant transformation. Loss of Pten function also resulted in squamous metaplasia but, in contrast to loss of Apc function, it initiates endometrial cancer. On the other hand, loss of Apc function in the endometrium accelerates Pten-driven endometrial tumourigenesis. Analysis of compound heterozygous mice confirmed that somatic loss of the wild-type Pten allele represents the rate-limiting initiation step in endometrial cancer. Simultaneous loss of Pten and Apc resulted in endometrial cancer characterized by earlier onset and a more aggressive malignant behaviour. These observations are indicative of the synergistic action between the Wnt-β-catenin and Pten signalling pathways in endometrial cancer onset and progression.",

The biomarker expressions correlated with clinicopathologic variables and with patient survival.;(1) p-AKT was positive in 53.7% (51/95) of tumors and was found to express almost similarly in endometrioid adenocarcinoma(EC) and non-enometrioid adenocarcinoma (NEC). There was no significant difference of patient survival between p-AKT positive and negative subgroups (P=0.757). (2) PTEN loss was found in 56.8%(54/95) of tumors, and occurred more often in EC(60.7%, 51/84) than in NEC (27.3%, 3/11), which was of statistical significance (P=0.035). The patients with PTEN loss had a longer survival than those without (P=0.015). (3) Although there was no significant correlation between p-AKT and PTEN expression, the extended analysis showed that the predictive value of PTEN loss in p-AKT positive subgroup (P=0.148) was lower than that in p-AKT negative expression subgroup (P=0.055). Meanwhile p-AKT positive and PTEN loss might have synergic effect on tumor proliferation, Ki67 positive rate was highest in PTEN+/p-AKT+ subgroup (40.0%) and lowest in PTEN-/p-AKT- subgroup (8.7%), which was of significant difference (P=0.015). (4) No correlation was found between p-AKT expression and P53 or HER-2 status (P>0.05). On the other hand, HER-2 and P53 positive correlated significantly (r=0.209, P=0.041) and occurred more frequently in NEC (45.5%, 100.0%) than in EC(6.0%, 42.9%)(P <0.05), which were found to predict poor survival (P<0.05).;p-AKT was activated equally in EC and NEC. p-AKT positive alone might have limited effect on patient survival, however, p-AKT expression might lower the predictive value of PTEN loss in endometrial carcinoma. Moreover, p-AKT positive and PTEN loss might have synergic effect on tumor proliferation. On the other hand, as p-AKT expression did not have any correlations with PTEN, P53 and HER-2 status in this cohort, there might be other important factors involved in p-AKT activation in endometrial carcinoma.

The results showed that among 41 cases of pancreatic cancers, the positive staining of PTNE (39.02%) was significantly weaker than that in normal pancreatic tissues (P < 0.05).

Prior work has shown that conditional bi-allelic inactivation of the Apc and Pten tumour suppressor genes in the mouse ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) promotes outgrowth of tumours that reflect the biological behaviour and gene expression profiles of human OECs harbouring comparable Wnt and PI3K-AKT pathway defects, although the mouse tumours are more poorly differentiated than their human tumour counterparts. We found that conditional inactivation of one or both Arid1a alleles in OSE concurrently with Apc and Pten inactivation unexpectedly prolonged the survival of tumour-bearing mice and promoted striking epithelial differentiation of the cancer cells, resulting in morphological features akin to those in human OECs. Enhanced epithelial differentiation was linked to reduced expression of the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and vimentin, and increased expression of the epithelial markers Crb3 and E-cadherin. Global gene expression profiling showed enrichment for genes associated with mesenchymal-epithelial transition in the Arid1a-deficient tumours. We also found that an activating (E545K) Pik3ca mutation, unlike Pten inactivation or Pik3ca H1047R mutation, cannot cooperate with Arid1a loss to promote ovarian cancer development in the mouse. Our results indicate that the Arid1a tumour suppressor gene has a key role in regulating OEC differentiation, and paradoxically the mouse cancers with more initiating tumour suppressor gene defects had a less aggressive phenotype than cancers arising from fewer gene alterations.

Neither external beam radiation nor chemotherapy, alone or in combination, have given encouraging results so far. A possible solution might come from the use of targeted therapy such as radioimmunotherapy. We present here the results obtained from the preclinical development of a new monoclonal antiferritin antibody (Ab), AMB8LK. Ferritin is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer and could thus be used as a target for the delivery of radioactivity at the tumour sites. The AMB8LK Ab was conjugated to three chelating agents: the 2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (PSCN-Bz-DTPA), the (R)-2-amino-3-(4-isothiocyanatophenyl)propyl]-trans-(S,S)-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine-pentaacetic acid (p5CN-Bz-CHX-A\"-DTPA) and the 2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (pSCN-Bz-DOTA). Radiolabelling of the three immunoconjugates with indium 111 and yttrium 90 as well as in vitro stability and immunoreactivity against pure ferritin and cells expressing ferritin were analysed. In vivo biodistribution studies were conducted on normal and on human pancreatic adenocarcinoma CAPAN-1 tumour bearing mice. These experiments demonstrated good radiolabelling (>95%), stability and immunoreactivity of the three compounds. In the biodistribution studies, differences between the three immunoconjugates were apparent in the rate of blood clearance and in tumour, liver and bone uptake. A very good pancreatic adenocarcinoma tumour targeting was observed especially with the Bz-DTPA-AMB8LK: 20% of the injected dose of the indium-labelled compound 3 days after injection; 15% of the injected dose 5 days after that of the yttrium-labelled Ab. Altogether, these results in animal models suggest that (90)Y-Bz-DTPA-AMB8LK is a good candidate for further therapeutic efficacy studies.",

Loss of PTEN expression correlated with activation of mTOR by increased phosphorylated S6 ribosome protein. We further functionally studied the role of PTEN in a pair of human SACC cell lines, SACC-83 and SACC-LM. Reduced PTEN level was correlated with the metastasis potential. When we knocked down PTEN in the SACC-83 cell line, we observed increased proliferation and enhanced migration/invasion in vitro, and increased tumor size in vivo. We further tested the therapeutical effect by applying a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 to both SACC cell lines. Decreased cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, as well as reduced cell migration/invasion were observed in both cell lines upon the NVP-BEZ235 treatment. Moreover, the NVP-BEZ235 treatment in a SGT xenograft mouse model significantly reduced primary tumor size and lung metastasis. Taken together, our results demonstrated that PTEN is a potent tumor suppressor in human SGTs, and targeting PI3K/mTOR pathway may be effective in the targeted therapy for human SGT patients with loss of PTEN expression.

        "Doc_abstract":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors. Most patients with HCC die within one year after diagnosis largely because of frequent tumor recurrence and metastasis. The tumor suppressor gene PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) is one of the most commonly lost or mutated genes in a variety of human cancers, including HCC. PTEN antagonizes phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/ATP-dependent tyrosine kinase (Akt) signaling, thereby negatively regulating a multitude of biological aggressive tumor behaviors. However, the direct role and mechanism of PTEN in the regulation of invasion and invasion-related gene expression in HCC remain to be elucidated. In this study, we introduced wild-type PTEN or phosphatase-dead PTEN into HepG2 cells that have low expression of PTEN. We found that overexpression of PTEN inhibits HepG2 cell growth via cell cycle arrest without inducing apoptosis. Matrigel invasion and scratch assays indicated that PTEN significantly inhibits HepG2 cell migration and invasion in vitro. On the molecular level, overexpression of PTEN suppressed expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 in HepG2 cells. Similarly, treatment of HepG2 cells with the PI3K/Akt pharmacological inhibitor, LY294002, potently suppressed cell migration and invasion as well as expression of MMPs. However, the phosphatase-dead PTEN mutant did not exert the same effects. Our data show that PTEN not only inhibits HepG2 cell growth via cell cycle arrest, but also suppresses cell invasion in a PI3K/Akt/MMP-dependent manner, which suggests that loss or mutation of PTEN may contribute to increased cell invasion and facilitates HCC progression.",

It has been suggested that the constitutive activation of PI3K/AKT signaling with concurrent loss of function of the tumor suppressor molecule PTEN contributes to cancer formation. Members of the PI3K-PTEN-AKT pathway, including these proteins and mTOR, are altered in melanoma tumors and cell lines. A hallmark of activation of the pathway is the loss of function of PTEN. Indeed, loss of heterozygosity of PTEN has been observed in approximately 30% of human melanomas, implicating this signaling pathway in this cancer. PI3K signaling activation, via loss of PTEN function, can inhibit proapoptotic genes such as the FoxO family of transcription factors, while inducing cell growth- and cell survival-related elements such as p70S6K and AKT. Determining how the PI3K-PTEN-AKT signaling pathway, alone or in cooperation with other pathways, orchestrates the induction of target genes involved in a diverse range of activities is a major challenge in research into melanoma initiation and progression. Moreover, the acquisition of basic knowledge will help patient management with appropriate therapies that are already, or will shortly be, on the market.",

PTEN counteracts the functions of many growth factors, the most prevalent of which is insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II). PTEN expression is stimulated by IGF-II forming a feedback loop. Investigating IGF-binding protein (IGFBP) modulation of IGF-II actions on MCF-7 breast cancer cells, we found that IGFBP-2 also regulates PTEN. The MCF-7 cells were not responsive to high doses of IGF-II due to induction of PTEN, which was not observed with an IGF-II-analog that does not bind to IGFBPs or in the presence of an inhibitor that prevents IGFs associating with IGFBPs. These cells predominantly produce IGFBP-2: blocking IGFBP-2 with a specific antibody, or preventing IGFBP-2 binding to integrins, restored the induction of PTEN and the cells were non-responsive to high doses of the IGF-II-analog. Our findings indicate that breast cancer cells do not respond to high doses of IGF-II due to induction of PTEN, but IGFBP-2, when free from IGF-II can suppress PTEN.

Gastric cancer cell line AGS and MKN-45 cells were stably transduced with lentivirus to downregulate endogenous miR-193-3p. The modulation of miR-193-3p downregulation on gastric cancer proliferation, migration, chemo-drug responses, and tumor explant were assessed by MTT, wound-healing, 5-FU chemoresistance and in vivo tumorigenicity assays, respectively. Downstream target of miR-193-3p, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in gastric cancer, was assessed by dual-luciferase reporter assay, qRT-PCR, and western blot. PTEN was knocked down by siRNA in AGS and MKN-45 cells to assess its direct impact on miR-193-3p modulation in gastric cancer. MiR-193-3p was aberrantly upregulated in both gastric cell lines and human gastric tumors. In AGS and MKN-45 cells, miR-193-3p downregulation reduced cancer proliferation, migration and 5-FU chemoresistance in vitro, and tumorigenicity in vivo. PTEN was confirmed to be targeted by miR-193-3p in gastric cancer. PTEN inhibition in AGS and MKN-45 cells directly reversed the anti-tumor modulations of miR-193-3p downregulation on gastric cancer proliferation, migration, and 5-FU chemoresistance.

Because genes interact with each other during cellular processes, carcinogenesis related genes may form differential co-expression patterns with other genes in different cell states. In this study, we develop a statistical method for identifying differential gene-gene co-expression patterns in different cell states.;For efficient pattern recognition, we extend the traditional F-statistic and obtain an Expected Conditional F-statistic (ECF-statistic), which incorporates statistical information of location and correlation. We also propose a statistical method for data transformation. Our approach is applied to a microarray gene expression dataset for prostate cancer study. For a gene of interest, our method can select other genes that have differential gene-gene co-expression patterns with this gene in different cell states. The 10 most frequently selected genes, include hepsin, GSTP1 and AMACR, which have recently been proposed to be associated with prostate carcinogenesis. However, genes GSTP1 and AMACR cannot be identified by studying differential gene expression alone. By using tumor suppressor genes TP53, PTEN and RB1, we identify seven genes that also include hepsin, GSTP1 and AMACR.

Four analogs were evaluated for their ability to inhibit growth of myeloid leukemia (NB4, HL-60), breast (MCF-7), and prostate (LNCaP) cancer cells. All 4 analogs inhibited growth in a dose-dependent manner. Most effective was 21-(3-methyl-3-hydroxy-butyl)-19-nor D(3) (Gemini-19-nor), which has 2 side chains and removal of the C-19. Gemini-19-nor was approximately 40 625-, 70-, 23-, and 380-fold more potent than 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) in inhibiting 50% clonal growth (ED(50)) of NB4, HL-60, MCF-7, and LNCaP cells, respectively.

Annexin V assay showed that Gemini-19-nor and 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent fashion. Gemini-19-nor (10(-8) M, 4 days) caused apoptosis in approximately 20% of cells, whereas 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) at the same concentration did not induce apoptosis.

Here, we used ten breast cancer cell lines to compare NVP-BEZ235 sensitivity and in the context of androgen receptor (AR) activation during NVP-BEZ235 treatment. We also used female SCID mice bearing breast tumor xenografts to investigate the beneficial effect of dihydrotestosterone/NVP-BEZ235 combination treatment compared with each alone.

Gene manipulations of MTDH and PTEN levels by knockdown or overexpression were utilized to elucidate molecular mechanisms of MTDH and PTEN implication in trastuzumab resistance. For in vivo studies, SK-BR-3 and SK-BR-3/R cells and modified derivatives were inoculated into nude mice alone or under trastuzumab exposure. Tumor volumes, histological examinations as well as Ki67 and PTEN expressions were revealed.;Elevated MTDH expression indicated poor clinical benefit, shortened progression free survival time, and was negatively correlated with PTEN level both in HER2 positive breast cancer patients and SK-BR-3/R cells. MTDH knockdown restored PTEN expression and trastuzumab sensitivity in SK-BR-3/R cells, while MTDH overexpression prevented SK-BR-3 cell death under trastuzumab exposure, probably through IκBα inhibition and nuclear translocation of p65 which subsequently decreased PTEN expression. Synergized effect of PTEN regulation were observed upon MTDH and p65 co-transfection. Forced PTEN expression in SK-BR-3/R cells restored trastuzumab sensitivity. Furthermore, decreased tumor volume and Ki67 level as well as increased PTEN expression were observed after MTDH knockdown in subcutaneous breast cancer xenografts from SK-BR-3/R cells, while the opposite effect were found in grafts from MTDH overexpressing SK-BR-3 cells.;MTDH overexpression confers trastuzumab resistance in HER2 positive breast cancer.

SDHx mutation analysis occurred in those without PTEN mutations/variations and elevated manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) levels. KLLN epimutation analysis was performed in the subset without any PTEN or SDHx mutation/deletion/ variant/polymorphism.;Gene-specific thyroid cancer histologies, demographic and clinical information, and adjusted standardized incidence rates were studied.;Of 2723 CS/CS-like patients, 664 had thyroid cancer. Standardized incidence rates for thyroid cancer were 72 [95% confidence interval (CI), 51-99; P < 0.001] for pathogenic PTEN mutations, 63 (95% CI, 42-92; P < 0.001) for SDHx variants, and 45 (95% CI, 26-73; P < 0.001) for KLLN epimutations. All six (16.7%) diagnosed under age 18 yr carried pathogenic PTEN mutations. Follicular thyroid cancer was overrepresented in PTEN mutation-positive cases compared to those with SDHx and KLLN alterations. PTEN frameshift mutations were found in 31% of patients with thyroid cancer compared to 17% in those without thyroid cancer.;CS/CS-like patients have elevated risks of follicular thyroid cancer due to PTEN pathogenic mutations and of papillary thyroid cancer from SDHx and KLLN alterations.

Mutations in PTEN are frequent and their presence is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer, which is the most common type of non-cutaneous malignancy in females. Delivery of the tumor suppressor PTEN gene represents a powerful strategy for breast cancer therapy, but a present limitation of gene therapy is the ability to deliver sufficient quantities of active proteins to target cells. The capacity of HSV-1VP22 fusion proteins to spread from the primary transduced cell to surrounding cells could improve gene therapeutics, particularly in cancer. To assess the potential efficacy of VP22 as a gene therapy for breast cancer, expression vectors for N- and C-terminal PTEN-VP22 fusion proteins were constructed. VP22‑mediated intercellular transport and antitumor efficacy in BT549 (PTEN-null) breast tumor cells were investigated. The results showed that PTEN-VP22 has the same spreading abilities as VP22. In cell proliferation and apoptosis assays, PTEN-VP22 gene transfer induces a stronger anti-proliferative effect and apoptotic activity compared with PTEN gene transfer alone. In addition, VP22 enhanced the PTEN‑mediated decrease in the level of phosphorylated AKT. The results show that PTEN-VP22 can spread in vitro and PTEN-VP22 gene induces significantly greater antitumor activity than the PTEN gene alone. This study confirms the utility of VP22-mediated delivery in vitro and suggests that PTEN-VP22 may have applications in breast cancer gene therapy.",

We found resistance to TRAIL could induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhance invasiveness. We further demonstrated PTEN was down-regulated in TRAIL-resistant cells. Silencing miR-221, PTEN expression was up-regulated, the process of EMT could be reversed, and the ability of migration and invasion were correspondingly weakened. We also demonstrated knockdown of miR-221 could reverse resistance to TRAIL partially by targeting PTEN. Our findings suggest that resistance to TRAIL could induce EMT and enhance invasiveness by suppressing PTEN via miR-221.

We isolated clones expressing the steady-state level of the PTEN protein from PTEN-null Ishikawa cells by transfection. The obtained clones showed reduced proliferative activity and reduced anchorage-independent cell growth with the augmented p27(Kip1). These cell lines were sensitized to apoptosis by staurosporine. A low concentration of UCN-01 did not affect apoptosis, but a high concentration augmented apoptosis in the PTEN-expressing clone.

Germline mutations of PTEN have been shown to cause Cowden syndrome, Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome and Proteus syndrome. Recently, germline mutations in BMPR1A, the gene encoding the type 1A receptor of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) have been found in rare families with Cowden syndrome, suggesting that there may be a link between BMP signaling and PTEN. We thus sought to determine whether BMP2 stimulation alters PTEN protein levels in the breast cancer line, MCF-7. We found that exposure to BMP2 increased PTEN protein levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The increase in PTEN protein was rapid and was not due to an increase in new protein synthesis, as cycloheximide treatment did not inhibit BMP2-induced PTEN accumulation, suggesting that BMP2 stimulation inhibited PTEN protein degradation. Indeed, we found that BMP2 treatment of MCF-7 cells decreased the association of PTEN with two proteins in the degradative pathway, UbCH7 and UbC9. These data indicate that BMP2 exposure can regulate PTEN protein levels by decreasing PTEN's association with the degradative pathway. This opens up a new mode of regulating PTEN activity to be investigated further and may explain why BMPR1A can act as a minor susceptibility gene for PTEN mutation negative Cowden syndrome.",

Early metastatic spread is the single most important reason for this poor outcome. The survival of patients with pathological stage I disease, that is, no evidence for metastatic spread, and molecular aberrations on chromosome 11p15.5 is equal to that of patients with stage II disease, that is, metastatic spread to hilar lymph nodes. RRM1 is a gene in this region, and it is haploinsufficient in at least 34% stage I patients. Here, we show that overexpression of RRM1 in human and mouse lung cancer cell lines induced PTEN expression, reduced phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), suppressed migration, invasion, and metastasis formation, and increased survival in an animal model. Increased PTEN expression was required for the RRM1-induced suppression of cell motility and FAK phosphorylation. We conclude that RRM1 functions as a metastasis suppressor gene through induction of PTEN expression.",

Here, we examine whether patients experience differences in acute gastrointestinal and genitourinary adverse effects.;In this randomised non-inferiority phase 3 trial, done in seven radiotherapy centres in the Netherlands, we enrolled intermediate-risk or high-risk patients aged between 44 and 85 years with histologically confirmed stage T1b-T4 NX-0MX-0 prostate cancer, a PSA concentration of 60 ng/mL or lower, and WHO performance status of 0-2. A web-based application was used to randomly assign (1:1) patients to receive either standard fractionation with 39 fractions of 2 Gy in 8 weeks (five fractions per week) or hypofractionation with 19 fractions of 3·4 Gy in 6·5 weeks (three fractions per week). Randomisation was done with minimisation procedure, stratified by treatment centre and risk group. The primary endpoint is 5-year relapse-free survival. Here we report data for the acute toxicity outcomes: the cumulative incidence of grade 2 or worse acute and late genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity. Non-inferiority of hypofractionation was tested separately for genitourinary and gastrointestinal acute toxic effects, with a null hypothesis that cumulative incidences of each type of adverse event were not more than 8% higher in the hypofractionation group than in the standard fractionation group. We scored acute genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxic effects according to RTOG-EORTC criteria from both case report forms and patients' self-assessment questionnaires, at baseline, twice during radiotherapy, and 3 months after completion of radiotherapy. Analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. Patient recruitment has been completed. This study is registered with www.controlled-trials.com, number ISRCTN85138529.;Between March 19, 2007, and Dec 3, 2010, 820 patients were randomly assigned to treatment with standard fractionation (n=410) or hypofractionation (n=410). 3 months after radiotherapy, 73 (22%) patients in the standard fractionation group and 75 (23%) patients in the hypofractionation group reported grade 2 or worse genitourinary toxicity; grade 2 or worse gastrointestinal toxicity was noted in 43 (13%) patients in the standard fractionation group and in 42 (13%) in the hypofractionation group. Grade 4 acute genitourinary toxicity was reported for two patients, one (<1%) in each group. No grade 4 acute gastrointestinal toxicities were observed. We noted no significant difference in cumulative incidence by 120 days after radiotherapy of grade 2 or worse acute genitourinary toxicity (57·8% [95% CI 52·9-62·7] in the standard fractionation group vs 60·5% (55·8-65·3) in the hypofractionation group; difference 2·7%, 90% CI -2·99 to 8·48; odds ratio [OR] 1·12, 95% CI 0·84-1·49; p=0·43). The cumulative incidence of grade 2 or worse acute gastrointestinal toxicity by 120 days after radiotherapy was higher in patients given hypofractionation (31·2% [95% CI 26·6-35·8] in the standard fractionation group vs 42·0% [37·2-46·9] in the hypofractionation group; difference 10·8%, 90% CI 5·25-16·43; OR 1·6; p=0·0015; non-inferiority not confirmed).;Hypofractionated radiotherapy was not non-inferior to standard fractionated radiotherapy in terms of acute genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity for men with intermediate-risk and high-risk prostate cancer.

PI3K signaling is most often activated by PIK3CA mutation or PTEN loss, which frequently results in sensitivity to p110α or p110β inhibitors, respectively. To examine the p110 isoform dependence in HER2+, PTEN-deficient tumors, we generated genetic mouse models of breast tumors driven by concurrent Her2 activation and Pten loss coupled with deletion of p110α or p110β. Ablation of p110α, but not p110β, significantly impaired the development of Her2+/Pten-null tumors in mice. We further show that p110α primarily mediates oncogenic signaling in HER2+/PTEN-deficient human cancers while p110β conditionally mediates PI3K/AKT signaling only upon HER2 inhibition. Combined HER2 and p110α inhibition effectively reduced PI3K/AKT signaling and growth of cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Addition of the p110β inhibitor to dual HER2 and p110α inhibition induced tumor regression in a xenograft model of HER2+/PTEN-deficient human cancers. Together, our data suggest that combined inhibition of HER2 and p110α/β may serve as a potent and durable therapeutic regimen for the treatment of HER2+, PTEN-deficient breast tumors. ",

Recent transcriptomics approaches have demonstrated that medulloblastoma is composed of molecularly distinct subgroups, one of which is characterized by activation of the Hedgehog pathway, which in mouse models is sufficient to drive medulloblastoma development. There is thus considerable interest in targeting the Hedgehog pathway for therapeutic benefit in medulloblastoma, particularly given the recent approval of the Hedgehog pathway inhibitor vismodegib for metastatic and locally advanced basal cell carcinoma. Like other molecularly targeted therapies, however, there have been reports of acquired resistance to vismodegib, driven by secondary Hedgehog pathway mutations and potentially by activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Given that acquired resistance to vismodegib may occur as a result of inappropriate PI3K pathway activation, we asked if loss of the PI3K pathway regulator, phosphatase and tensin homologue (Pten), which has been reported to occur in patients within the Hedgehog subgroup, would constitute a mechanism of innate resistance to vismodegib in Hedgehog-driven medulloblastoma. We find that Hedgehog pathway inhibition successfully restrains growth of Pten-deficient medulloblastoma in this mouse model, but does not drive tumor regression, as it does in Pten-wild-type medulloblastoma. Combined inhibition of the Hedgehog and PI3K pathways may lead to superior antitumor activity in PTEN-deficient medulloblastoma in the clinic.",

Although multiple cellular miRNAs have been identified to regulate the EMT and metastasis in cancers, the role of viral miRNAs in cancer progression remains largely unknown. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated malignancy typically characterized by its early metastasis. In the present study, we have discovered the involvement of a viral miRNA, EBV-miR-BART7-3p, in the EMT and metastasis of NPC cells. Initially, we observed that EBV-miR-BART7-3p was highly expressed in NPC and positively correlated with lymph node metastasis and clinical stage of NPC. Subsequently, we demonstrated that EBV-miR-BART7-3p enhanced cell migration/invasion in vitro, cancer metastasis in vivo, and particularly the EMT characterized by loss of epithelial markers and gain of mesenchymal features in NPC cells. Furthermore, mechanistic studies disclosed that EBV-miR-BART7-3p targeted a major human tumor suppressor PTEN, modulating PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β signaling and eventually leading to the high expression and nuclear accumulation of Snail and β-catenin, which favor EMT. Knockdown of PTEN could phenocopy the effect of EBV-miR-BART7-3p, whereas re-expression of PTEN resulted in a phenotypic reversion. Moreover, these findings were supported by an observation of an EBV-positive cell model in which silencing of endogenous EBV-miR-BART7-3p partially attenuated cell migration/invasion and altered EMT protein expression pattern via reverting PI3K/Akt, Snail and β-catenin expression. Thus, this study suggests a novel mechanism by which EBV-miR-BART7-3p modulates the EMT and metastasis of NPC cells, and a clinical implication of EBV-miR-BART7-3p as a potential biomarker or therapeutic target.

Here, we utilized the SMAD4-null SW480 colon cancer cell line to examine BMPs effect on a potential target gene, PTEN, and how its expression might be regulated. Initial treatment of the SMAD4-null cells with BMP resulted in mild growth suppression, but with prolonged exposure to BMP, the cells become growth stimulatory, which coincided with observed decreases in transcription and translation of PTEN, and with corresponding increases in phospho-AKT protein levels. BMP-induced PTEN suppression was mediated via the RAS/ERK pathway, as pharmacologic inhibition of RAS/ERK, or interference with protein function in the cytosol by DN-RAS prevented BMP-induced growth promotion and changes in PTEN levels, as did treatment with noggin, a BMP ligand inhibitor.

        "Doc_abstract":"Epithelial ovarian cancer comprises three major histological subtypes (serous, mucinous, and endometrioid), and it is becoming clear that the developmental pathways for these subtypes are fundamentally different. In particular, endometrioid ovarian cancers probably arise by the malignant transformation of ectopic endometrial implants called endometriosis and not the ovarian surface epithelium. The PTEN/MMAC gene on chromosome 10q23 is a tumor suppressor implicated in the pathogenesis of a wide variety of malignancies, but to date, somatic mutations in PTEN have not been identified in studies of predominantly serous ovarian cancers. In endometrial cancers, PTEN mutations are very common in tumors of the endometrioid type but have rarely been found in serous types, and we hypothesized that a similar histological subtype bias might be occurring in ovarian cancer. We have analyzed 81 ovarian tumors, including 34 endometrioid, 29 serous, 10 mucinous, and 8 clear cell tumors, for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on 10q23 and for mutations in all 9 coding exons of PTEN. LOH was common among the endometrioid (43%) and serous (28%) tumors but was infrequent among the other histological subtypes. Somatic PTEN mutations were detected in seven (21%) of the endometrioid tumors, and in all informative cases, the mutation was accompanied by loss of the wild-type allele. One mucinous tumor without 10q23 LOH was shown to harbor two somatic PTEN mutations. In this tumor, the histological appearance of the mucinous areas was atypical, and the mucinous areas contained foci of endometrioid differentiation. The majority of tumors with PTEN mutations were grade 1 and/or stage 1, suggesting that inactivation of PTEN is an early event in ovarian tumorigenesis. No PTEN mutations were found among the serous or clear cell tumors. The identification of frequent somatic PTEN mutations in endometrioid ovarian tumors indicates that it plays a significant role in the etiology of this subtype. The absence of mutations in other histological subtypes is consistent with the hypothesis that epithelial ovarian cancers arise through distinct developmental pathways.",

The ErbB2-targeted antibody trastuzumab improves survival when given with chemotherapy to patients with ErbB2-overexpressing metastatic disease, but treatment is not curative, and primary resistance is common. Postulated mechanisms of action for trastuzumab include immune-mediated cytotoxicity and receptor downmodulation. A study in this issue of Cancer Cell suggests that trastuzumab causes rapid activation of the PTEN lipid phosphatase, which in turn downregulates the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Resistance to trastuzumab occurs when PTEN function is lost, suggesting that PTEN activation is a critical component of the therapeutic effect.",

        "Doc_abstract":"PTEN is a novel tumour suppressor gene located on chromosome 10. PTEN mutations are believed to exert their effects through the putative PI3K-AKT-mTOR signalling pathway. Specifically, loss of PTEN leads to activation of AKT, which in turn promotes anti-apoptotic and pro-cell cycle entry pathways believed to be essential in tumourigenesis. Whilst PTEN mutations are frequent in a variety of sporadic cancers and inherited cancer syndromes, it is not clear how frequently PTEN mutations and immunohistochemical loss of PTEN expression occur in sporadic breast cancer. This study used tissue microarrays (TMAs) to assess wild-type PTEN and pAKT immunohistochemical staining in 670 and 691 cases, respectively, of primary operable breast cancer. Scores of 0, 1, and 2 were given for negative, weakly positive, and strongly positive degrees of immunoreactivity, respectively. In addition, immunohistochemical assessment of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Her2, and proliferation by MIB1 expression was performed on the same TMAs and the scores were compared with those of PTEN and pAKT. Eight per cent of cases did not express wild-type PTEN. No correlation was observed between patient, tumour and outcome variables and PTEN. pAKT expression correlated inversely with adverse tumour variables such as tumour grade (p< 0.001) and correlated positively with ER status (p< 0.001). No correlation was seen between either PTEN or AKT and EGFR, Her2 or MIB1. No association of PTEN or pAKT was seen in Kaplan-Meier or multivariate analysis for overall survival. The results indicate that loss of PTEN expression is infrequent in breast cancer. PTEN and AKT do not appear to be prognostic markers. The study argues against the current model of a simple linear tumourigenic PTEN-PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in breast cancer. It also suggests that, in this group of breast cancers, the most common upstream regulator of AKT may be ER rather than PTEN, EGFR or Her2.",

LOH was found in 8 of 19 ovarian endometrioid carcinomas (42.1%), 6 of 22 clear cell carcinomas (27.3%) and 13 of 23 solitary endometrial cysts (56.5%). Somatic mutations in the PTEN gene were identified in 4 of 20 ovarian endometrioid carcinomas (20.0%), 2 of 24 clear cell carcinomas (8.3%) and 7 of 34 solitary endometrial cysts (20.6%). In 5 endometrioid carcinomas with endometriosis, 3 displayed LOH events common to both the carcinoma and the endometriosis. In 7 clear cell carcinomas with endometriosis, 3 displayed LOH events common to both the carcinoma and the endometriosis. In no cases there were LOH events in the endometriosis only. These results indicate that inactivation of the PTEN gene is an early event in the development of both endometrioid and clear cell carcinoma of the ovary. A laser-assisted microdissection method enables us to collect target cells without contamination by non-tumor cells.

However, the role of PTEN does not appear to be restricted only to PI3K signaling antagonism, and new functions have been recently discovered for this protein. In addition to the well-established role of PTEN as a tumor suppressor, increasing evidence now suggests that a dysregulated PTEN expression and/or activity is also linked to the development of several hepatic pathologies. Dysregulated PTEN expression/activity is observed with obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, hepatitis B virus/hepatitis C virus infections, and abusive alcohol consumption, whereas mutations/deletions have also been associated with the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, it appears that alterations of PTEN expression and activity in hepatocytes are common and recurrent molecular events associated with liver disorders of various etiologies.

Although it has been demonstrated that microRNA-21 (miR-21) can act as an 'oncogene' in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, its role in radioresistance remains unexplored. The aims of this study were to investigate the role of miR-21 in esophageal squamous carcinoma cells' radioresistance and to identify the possible mechanism. The relatively radioresistant esophageal squamous cancer TE-1 cells (TE-R60) was established by fractionated irradiation. By lentiviral transduction with miRZip-21, the miR-21 expression in TE-1 cells was stably downregulated, which was renamed as 'anti-miR-21 TE-1 cells.' The phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) was knocked down in anti-miR-21 TE-1 cells through short interfering RNA. The expression level of miR-21 and PTEN messenger RNA were measured by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The expression level of PTEN, phospho-Akt, and Akt protein were detected by Western blot. Clongenic assay was used to analyze the cells' radiosensitivity. miR-21 was overexpressed, and PTEN was suppressed in established radioresistant TE-R60 cells compared with the parent cells (1.3-fold and 70.83%). The inhibition of miR-21 significantly increased the cells' radiosensitivity (P < 0.05) and the PTEN protein expression (2.3-fold) in TE-1 cells. In addition, phospho-Akt protein, downstream target of PTEN, reduced significantly in anti-miR-21 TE-1 cells. Knockdown of PTEN in anti-miR-21 TE-1 cells could abrogate the miR-21 inhibition-induced radiosensitization (P < 0.05). Inhibition of miR-21 increased radiosensitivity of esophageal cancer TE-1 cells, and this effect was possibly through the activation of PTEN. Inhibition of miR-21 may form a novel therapeutic strategy to increase the radiosensitivity of esophageal cancer. ",

The dysregulation of this pathway has been implicated in tumor initiation, cell growth and survival, invasion and angiogenesis, thus, PI3K and mTOR are promising therapeutic targets for cancer. We discovered GDC-0980, a selective, potent, orally bioavailable inhibitor of Class I PI3 kinase and mTOR kinase (TORC1/2) with excellent pharmacokinetic and pharmaceutical properties. GDC-0980 potently inhibits signal transduction downstream of both PI3K and mTOR, as measured by pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers, thereby acting upon two key pathway nodes to produce the strongest attainable inhibition of signaling in the pathway. Correspondingly, GDC-0980 was potent across a broad panel of cancer cell lines, with the greatest potency in breast, prostate, and lung cancers and less activity in melanoma and pancreatic cancers, consistent with KRAS and BRAF acting as resistance markers. Treatment of cancer cell lines with GDC-0980 resulted in G1 cell-cycle arrest, and in contrast to mTOR inhibitors, GDC-0980 induced apoptosis in certain cancer cell lines, including those with direct pathway activation via PI3K and PTEN. Low doses of GDC-0980 potently inhibited tumor growth in xenograft models including those with activated PI3K, loss of LKB1 or PTEN, and elicited an exposure-related decrease in PD biomarkers.

The peak incidence in relation to age increased slightly but remained in the third and fourth decade through the study period. The incidence in men over 40 years of age increased markedly towards the end of the study. There were 109 deaths at follow-up (Dec. 1981) among those having the UC diagnosis between 1955-1979. Twentysix out of 41 patients who died due to UC did so postoperatively. The mortality pattern among those 68 patients who had causes of death unrelated to UC was similar to the expected. There was a decrease in cumulative survival probability compared with the expected, in particular in those with total colitis. This was also seen when only deaths unrelated to UC were included suggesting an increased sensitivity to the ordinary disease spectrum in UC patients.

In the present study, we have investigated the mechanism and regulation of PTEN ubiquitination catalysed by NEDD4-1 (neural-precursor-cell-expressed, developmentally down-regulated 4-1), a ubiquitin ligase for PTEN we identified recently. Using the reconstituted assay and cellular analysis, we demonstrated that NEDD4-1-mediated PTEN ubiquitination depends on its intact HECT (homologous to E6-associated protein C-terminus) domain. Instead of using its WW domains (protein-protein interaction domains containing two conserved tryptophan residues) as a protein interaction module, NEDD4-1 interacts with PTEN through its N-terminal region containing a C2 domain as well as the HECT domain. Strikingly, we found that a C-terminal truncated PTEN fragment binds to NEDD4-1 with higher affinity than the full-length PTEN, suggesting an intrinsic inhibitory effect of the PTEN C-terminus on PTEN-NEDD4-1 interaction. Moreover, the C-terminal truncated PTEN is more sensitive to NEDD4-1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. Therefore the present study reveals that the C-terminus of PTEN plays a critical role in stabilizing PTEN via antagonizing NEDD4-1-induced PTEN protein decay; conversely, truncation of the PTEN C-terminus results in rapid NEDD4-1-mediated PTEN degradation, a possible mechanism accounting for attenuation of PTEN function by certain PTEN mutations in human cancers.",

MiR-20b has been reported to participate in breast cancer tumorigenic progression, however, the functional roles are still unclear and under debating. The aim of this study is to explicit the molecular mechanism of miR-20b underlying breast cancer tumorigenesis.;In the present study, we showed that miR-20b was overexpressed in human breast cancer tissues and cell lines compared with paired adjacent normal tissues and normal cell lines, respectively. We identified PTEN, a well-known tumor suppressor, as the functional downstream target of miR-20b. Luciferase assays confirmed that miR-20b could directly bind to the 3' untranslated region(UTR) of PTEN and suppress translation. Alteration of miR-20b expression changed PTEN protein level but not mRNA expression in ZR-75-30 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells, suggesting miR-20b regulates PTEN gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. Furthermore, upregulation of miR-20b significantly promoted the proliferation, colony formation and DNA synthesis of ZR-75-30 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Conversely, knockdown of miR-20b expression inhibited the growth of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.;Dysregulation of miR-20b plays critical roles in the breast cancer tumorigenesis, at least in part via targeting the tumor suppressor PTEN. This microRNA may serve as a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for breast cancer.",

Aberrant miR‑370 expression has been indicated in tumor growth, but the mechanism of miR‑370 inhibits both the proliferation and metastatic ability for gastric cancer remains unclear. Accumulating evidence reported that PTEN signaling pathway plays an important role in the cellular processes, such as apoptosis, cell growth and proliferation. The goal of this study was to identify whether miR‑370 could inhibit the growth, migration, invasion, proliferation and metastasis of gastric cancer through targeting PTEN. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) was used to quantify miR-370 expression in vitro experiments. The biological functions of miR‑370 were determined via cell proliferation. Our study indicated that miR‑370 targeted PTEN leading to activation of apoptosis signaling and the cell proliferation of cervical cancer cells, ameliorating gastric cancer growth and progression. In addition, the combination of miR‑370 and PTEN inactivated AKT, MDM2 and mTOR while stimulated caspase-3, p53 and GSK3β expression, promoting apoptosis and suppressing proliferation of gastric cancer cells. Therefore, our study revealed the mechanistic links between miR‑370 and PTEN in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer through modulation of cell apoptosis and proliferation.

Here, we examined the impact of PTEN alterations on the response to treatment with a FAK inhibitor (GSK2256098). In vitro and in vivo therapeutic experiments were carried out using PTEN-mutated and PTEN-wild-type models of uterine cancer alone and in combination with chemotherapy. Treatment with GSK2256098 resulted in greater inhibition of pFAK(Y397) in PTEN-mutated (Ishikawa) than in PTEN-wild-type (Hec1A) cells. Ishikawa cells were more sensitive to GSK2256098 than the treated Hec1A cells. Ishikawa cells were transfected with a wild-type PTEN construct and pFAK(Y397) expression was unchanged after treatment with GSK2256098. Decreased cell viability and enhanced sensitivity to chemotherapy (paclitaxel and topotecan) in combination with GSK2256098 was observed in Ishikawa cells as compared with Hec1a cells. In the Ishikawa orthoptopic murine model, treatment with GSK2256098 resulted in lower tumor weights and fewer metastases than mice inoculated with Hec1A cells. Tumors treated with GSK2256098 had lower microvessel density (CD31), less cellular proliferation (Ki67), and higher apoptosis (TUNEL) rates in the Ishikawa model when compared with the Hec1a model. From a large cohort of evaluable patients, increased FAK and pFAK(Y397) expression levels were significantly related to poor overall survival. Moreover, PTEN levels were inversely related to pFAK(Y397) expression. These preclinical data demonstrate that PTEN-mutated uterine cancer responds better to FAK inhibition than does PTEN wild-type cancer. Therefore, PTEN could be a biomarker for predicting response to FAK-targeted therapy during clinical development.",

Biochemical evidence suggests that p27(kip1) is phosphorylated on several serine residues, including Ser-10 and Ser-178, but that phosphorylation is unaltered by PI 3-kinase activity.

Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate is involved in the activation of the anti-apoptotic effector target, Akt. Although the Akt pathway has been implicated in regulating NF-kappaB activity, it is controversial as to whether Akt activates NF-kappaB predominantly through mechanisms that regulate nuclear translocation or transactivation potential. In this report, we utilized PTEN as a natural biological inhibitor of Akt activity to study the effects on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced activation of NF-kappaB. We found that the reintroduction of PTEN into prostate cells inhibited TNF-stimulated NF-kappaB transcriptional activity. PTEN failed to block TNF-induced IKK activation, IkappaBalpha degradation, p105 processing, p65 (RelA) nuclear translocation, and DNA binding of NF-kappaB. However, PTEN inhibited NF-kappaB-dependent transcription by blocking the ability of TNF to stimulate the transactivation domain of the p65 subunit. PTEN also inhibited the transactivation potential of the cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein, but this was not observed for c-Jun. The transactivation potential of p65 following TNF stimulation could be rescued from PTEN-dependent repression by re-introducing expression constructs encoding activated forms of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Akt, or Akt and IKK. The ability of PTEN to inhibit the TNF-induced transactivation function of p65 is important, because expression of PTEN blocked TNF-stimulated NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression, thus sensitizing cells to TNF-induced apoptosis. Maintenance of the PTEN tumor suppressor protein is therefore required to modulate Akt activity and to concomitantly control the transcriptional activity of the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-kappaB.",

Both IGFBPs are potent effectors of growth and metabolism. Secretion of IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 is further suppressed by insulin and diminished with increasing obesity. Both IGFBP family members share the RGD sequence motif that mediates binding to integrins and is linked to PTEN/PI3K signalling. In mice, IGFBP-2 prevents age- and diet-dependent glucose insensitivity and blocks differentiation of preadipocytes. The latter function is modulated by two distinct heparin-binding domains of IGFBP-2 which are lacking in IGFBP-1. IGFBP-2 is further regulated by leptin and has been demonstrated to affect insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, further supporting a particular role of IGFBP-2 in glucose and fat metabolism.

Cells transfected with a mutant PTEN gene lacking both lipid and protein phosphatase activities were more resistant to doxorubicin than cells transfected with the PTEN mutant lacking lipid phosphatase activity indicating that the protein phosphatase activity of PTEN was also important in controlling the sensitivity to doxorubicin, while no difference was observed between the lipid (G129E) and lipid and protein (C124S) phosphatase PTEN mutants in terms of sensitivity to rapamycin. A synergistic inhibitory interaction was observed when doxorubicin was combined with rapamycin in the phosphatase-deficient PTEN-transfected cells. Interference with the lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN was sufficient to activate Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling. These studies indicate that disruption of the normal activity of the PTEN phosphatase can have dramatic effects on the therapeutic sensitivity of breast cancer cells. Mutations in the key residues which control PTEN lipid and protein phosphatase may act as dominant-negative mutants to suppress endogenous PTEN and alter the sensitivity of breast cancer patients to chemo- and targeted therapies.",

Lipofectamine 2000 was used to transfect the constructed expression vectors into hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HHCC which was PTEN protein negative. G418 was used to select the cell clones constantly expressing PTEN protein. Flow cytometry was used to assay the cell cycle of HHCC transfected by above mentioned eukaryotic expression vectors and non-transfected cell line HHCC. Intrinsic 473-phosphorylated AKT representing the level of active AKT was assayed by Western blot. The non-transfected HHCC served as control.;The proliferation of HHCC constantly expressing PTEN protein was obviously inhibited compared with HHCC cells transfected with mutated PTEN gene and empty vectors, and non-transfected HHCC cells. The number of HHCC cells transfected with wild type PTEN gene at G(1) phase, G(2) phase and S phase was 70.8%, 6.8% and 22.4%, respectively. Compared with control group transfected with empty vector, the number of G(1) phase HHCC cells constantly expressing wild type-PTEN protein was significantly higher than that of control. The number of cells in G(2) and S phase was significantly lower than that of control. However, the number of cells in G(1) phase, G(2) phase and S phase of HHCC transfected with mutant PTEN was 63.2%, 10.1% and 26.7%, respectively. There was no significant difference compared with control group. Western blot result showed that the intrinsic level of 473-phosphorylated AKT of HHCC constantly expressing wild type PTEN protein was down-regulated, and that of HHCC transfected with mutated PTEN gene was equal to that of control.;Wild type PTEN gene can inhibit the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells at G(1) phase.

These allelic disorders, Cowden syndrome, Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, Proteus syndrome, and Proteus-like syndrome are associated with unregulated cellular proliferation leading to the formation of hamartomas. Thus far, an increased risk of malignancy has only been documented in Cowden syndrome; however, current recommendations advise that all individuals with PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome follow the cancer surveillance strategies suggested for Cowden syndrome until further data indicate otherwise. Because any individual phenotypic feature of Cowden syndrome and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome are frequently present in the general population, many individuals often go undiagnosed and consequently do not benefit from available cancer surveillance strategies. Therefore, it is critical for clinicians to recognize the phenotypic features associated with these syndromes to accurately diagnose and provide preventative care.

As mice lacking the peroxidase peroxiredoxin1 (Prdx1) produce more cellular ROS and die prematurely of cancer, they offer an ideal model system to study ROS-induced tumorigenesis. Prdx1 ablation increased the susceptibility to Ras-induced breast cancer. We, therefore, investigated the role of Prdx1 in regulating oncogenic Ras effector pathways. We found Akt hyperactive in fibroblasts and mammary epithelial cells lacking Prdx1. Investigating the nature of such elevated Akt activation established a novel role for Prdx1 as a safeguard for the lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN, which is essential for its tumour suppressive function. We found binding of the peroxidase Prdx1 to PTEN essential for protecting PTEN from oxidation-induced inactivation.

The importance of this pathway in tumorigenesis has been highlighted by the finding that PTEN, the lipid phosphatase that breaks down PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) to PtdIns(4,5)P(2), is frequently mutated in human cancer. Cells lacking PTEN possess elevated levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3), PKB, and S6K activity and heterozygous PTEN(+/-) mice develop a variety of tumors. Knockout of PKBalpha in PTEN-deficient cells reduces aggressive growth and promotes apoptosis, whereas treatment of PTEN(+/-) mice with rapamycin, an inhibitor of the activation of S6K, reduces neoplasia. We explored the importance of PDK1, the protein kinase that activates PKB and S6K, in mediating tumorigenesis caused by the deletion of PTEN. We demonstrate that reducing the expression of PDK1 in PTEN(+/-) mice, markedly protects these animals from developing a wide range of tumors.

Besides, the number and constitution of FMGS and ARs differed greatly among different cancers and stages. In addition, FMGS and ARs were rare in endocrine-related cancers such as breast carcinoma, ovarian cystadenocarcinoma, and thyroid carcinoma, but abundant in cancers contact directly with external environments such as skin melanoma and stomach adenocarcinoma.

The phenotypic spectrum of PTEN mutations expanded to include autism with macrocephaly only 10 years ago. Neurological studies of patients with PTEN-associated autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show increases in cortical white matter and a distinctive cognitive profile, including delayed language development with poor working memory and processing speed. Once a germline PTEN mutation is found, and a diagnosis of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) hamartoma tumor syndrome made, the clinical outlook broadens to include higher lifetime risks for multiple cancers, beginning in childhood with thyroid cancer. First described as a tumor suppressor, PTEN is a major negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway-controlling growth, protein synthesis, and proliferation. This canonical function combines with less well-understood mechanisms to influence synaptic plasticity and neuronal cytoarchitecture. Several excellent mouse models of Pten loss or dysfunction link these neural functions to autism-like behavioral abnormalities, such as altered sociability, repetitive behaviors, and phenotypes like anxiety that are often associated with ASD in humans. These models also show the promise of mTOR inhibitors as therapeutic agents capable of reversing phenotypes ranging from overgrowth to low social behavior. Based on these findings, therapeutic options for patients with PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome and ASD are coming into view, even as new discoveries in PTEN biology add complexity to our understanding of this master regulator.

        "Doc_abstract":"The tumor suppressor gene PTEN is frequently mutated in diverse human cancers and in autosomal dominant cancer predisposition disorders. Recent studies have shown that the lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN is critical for its tumor suppressor function and that PTEN negatively regulates the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase-protein kinase B pathway. Although more than half of PTEN mutations result in protein truncation, a significant fraction of PTEN mutations are missense mutations. To examine whether tumor-derived and germ-line-derived missense mutations inactivate PTEN lipid phosphatase function, we constructed 42 distinct types of PTEN missense mutations and expressed them in Escherichia coli. The purified (His)6-tagged PTEN proteins were tested for their ability to dephosphorylate inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate. In addition, we examined the effect of mutant PTENs on the ability of PTEN to bind to the phospholipid membrane. The results revealed that the majority of PTEN missense mutations [38 of 42 (90%)] eliminated or reduced phosphatase activity and that all of the mutations examined had no effect on the membrane binding activity of PTEN. Our study indicated that phosphoinositide phosphatase activity is important for the tumor suppressor function of PTEN and that there may be other mechanisms of PTEN inactivation that are not monitored by in vitro phosphatase assay and in vitro membrane binding assay.",

Subchronic and acute UVA radiation also downregulated PTEN in normal human epidermal keratinocytes, skin culture, and mouse skin. At the molecular level, chronic UVA radiation decreased the transcriptional activity of the PTEN promoter in a methylation-independent manner, whereas it had no effect on the protein stability or mRNA stability of PTEN. In contrast, we found that UVA-induced activation of the Ras/ERK/AKT and NF-кB pathways plays an important role in UV-induced PTEN downregulation. Inhibiting extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) or protein pinase B (AKT) increases PTEN expression.

Correlation between immunostainings and clinicopathological parameters, follow-up data of patients, was analyzed statistically.;High expression of DJ-1 was found in 66.7% (76/114) and associated with tumor depth (P=0.003), lymph node metastasis (P=0.011), distant metastasis (P=0.001) and advanced clinical stage (P=0.001). Loss or downregulation of PTEN was found in 58.7% (67/114) and associated with advanced clinical stage (P=0.018) and high expression of DJ-1 in tumor cells (P=0.006). In univariate survival analysis, high-expression of DJ-1 or loss of PTEN was significantly associated with poor prognosis of GC patients.

There also exists some phenotypic overlap in the occurrence of cancers in LFS and Cowden's disease (CD), for which germline PTEN mutations are believed to be responsible. We hypothesized that PTEN may be altered in some TP53-wild-type LFS families. We examined LFS primary patient lymphocytes for PTEN alterations using SSCP and sequence analysis. A novel intronic deletion was found in two unrelated individuals, adjacent to the splice acceptor site of PTEN exon 4. Based on an in vitro mRNA processing assay this alteration is predicted to be a polymorphism. The in vivo effects of this proximal splice site deletion are unknown and a genetic cause for the cancers in these families remains to be elucidated.

These lethal cases are thought to be caused by coordinated genomic alterations that accumulate over time. Recent genome-wide analyses of DNA from subjects with PCa have revealed most, if not all, genetic changes in both germline and PCa tumor genomes. In this article, I first review the major, somatically acquired genomic characteristics of various subtypes of PCa. I then recap key findings on the relationships between genomic alterations and clinical parameters, such as biochemical recurrence or clinical relapse, metastasis and cancer-specific mortality. Finally, I outline the need for, and challenges with, validation of recent findings in prospective studies for clinical utility. It is clearer now than ever before that the landscape of somatically acquired aberrations in PCa is highlighted by DNA copy number alterations (CNAs) and TMPRSS2-ERG fusion derived from complex rearrangements, numerous single nucleotide variations or mutations, tremendous heterogeneity, and continuously punctuated evolution. Genome-wide CNAs, PTEN loss, MYC gain in primary tumors, and TP53 loss/mutation and AR amplification/mutation in advanced metastatic PCa have consistently been associated with worse cancer prognosis. With this recently gained knowledge, it is now an opportune time to develop DNA-based tests that provide more accurate patient stratification for prediction of clinical outcome, which will ultimately lead to more personalized cancer care than is possible at present.

PTEN gene is frequently mutated or deleted in several malignancies including human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The clinical significance and prognostic value of PTEN expression in HCC or in the surrounding non-cancerous parenchyma remain obscure. Using immunohistochemistry, we analyzed the PTEN protein expression in 46 tissue sections collected from surgically resected hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive cirrhotic HCC patients. Although the surrounding normal liver tissue was strongly expressing PTEN in 42 cases (91.3%), the immunostaining intensity was low in 29 (63.1%) and high in 17 (36.9%) of the HCCs. Additionally a significant positive correlation was identified between low PTEN expression in the HCC and increased expression of iNOS and COX II in the surrounding liver. The overall survival was significantly longer for the HCC-patients with high PTEN expression than patients with low PTEN expression. Univariate analysis revealed PTEN expression as an independent prognostic factor for patients survival. By Western blot analysis we also found that the Akt/PKB signaling, which is negatively regulated by PTEN, was upregulated in the HCCs in comparison to its expression in the surrounding liver tissue. These results demonstrate that downregulation of PTEN in the tumor is an important step in HCV-positive cirrhotic hepatocarcinogenesis and might result in concomitant upregulation of iNOS and COX II in the surrounding liver in favor of tumor promotion.",

PIK3CA mutations were more common in hormone receptor-positive (34.5%) and HER2-positive (22.7%) than in basal-like tumors (8.3%). AKT1 (1.4%) and PTEN (2.3%) mutations were restricted to hormone receptor-positive cancers. Unlike AKT1 mutations that were absent from cell lines, PIK3CA (39%) and PTEN (20%) mutations were more common in cell lines than tumors, suggesting a selection for these but not AKT1 mutations during adaptation to culture. PIK3CA mutations did not have a significant effect on outcome after adjuvant tamoxifen therapy in 157 hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients. PIK3CA mutations, in comparison with PTEN loss and AKT1 mutations, were associated with significantly less and inconsistent activation of AKT and of downstream PI3K/AKT signaling in tumors and cell lines. PTEN loss and PIK3CA mutation were frequently concordant, suggesting different contributions to pathophysiology. PTEN loss rendered cells significantly more sensitive to growth inhibition by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 than did PIK3CA mutations. Thus, PI3K pathway aberrations likely play a distinct role in the pathogenesis of different breast cancer subtypes.

We transfected an intact PTEN gene into H1650 cells and knocked down PTEN expression in PC-9 cells using shRNA. The effectiveness of gefitinib and vandetanib was assessed using a xenograft model. While PC-9 cells were more resistant to vandetanib than gefitinib, H1650 cells were more sensitive to vandetanib than gefitinib. Both gefitinib and vandetanib suppressed the activation of EGFR and MAPK in H1650 cells, although phosphorylated AKT levels were not affected. In an H1650 cell xenograft model, vandetanib was also more effective than gefitinib. Although PTEN-transfected H1650 cells did not show restoration of sensitivity to gefitinib in vitro, the xenograft tumors responded to gefitinib and vandetanib. Knockdown of PTEN in PC-9 cells caused resistance to gefitinib. In conclusion, vandetanib might be effective in NSCLC with EGFR mutations that lack PTEN expression.

After nuclear translocation, PTEN induces autophagy, in association with the activation of the p-JUN-SESN2/AMPK pathway, in response to TPT.

However, CLs are known to be toxic and exposure to CLs can influence cell survival pathways. This study characterized how CLs combine with ILK siRNA to influence the AKT/PI3K pathway. Using PTEN-negative cell lines (PC3 castration-insensitive prostate cancer cells and U251 glioma cancer cells), the influence of CLs on the downstream consequences of ILK silencing was determined. When comparing nucleofection (an electroporation method that does not require the use of CLs) and CLs as means to deliver ILK siRNA, a 12- to 30-fold increase in siRNA delivery was achieved when using a CL formulation, yet ILK suppression was less efficient.

Forty-four patients with adenomatous polyps and 32 with primary adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum were enrolled in the study. They underwent endoscopic removal of polyps or major surgery and postoperative adjuvant chemo- and radiotherapy depending on staging of the disease. No patient had received chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy before the surgery. PTEN expression was evaluated using immunohistochemical staining on paraffin-embedded specimens and compared to clinicopathological features of tumors. In colorectal cancers, PTEN expression was found to be significantly lower than in normal intestinal mucosa and adenomatous polyps. That was associated with complete loss of PTEN expression observed more frequently in colorectal cancer, contrary to reduction of PTEN expression occurring mostly in polyps. A correlation between polyp diameter and loss of PTEN was demonstrated as well as between tumor size and TNM advanced stage and PTEN expression. The obtained results suggest that the PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway may play an important role in early stages of sporadic colorectal carcinogenesis and reduced PTEN expression in late oncogenesis is associated with some adverse clinical and pathological features.",

Here we show that expression of the gene encoding B7-H1 increases post transcriptionally in human glioma after loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K) pathway. Tumor specimens from individuals with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) had levels of B7-H1 protein that correlated with PTEN loss, and tumor-specific T cells lysed human glioma targets expressing wild-type PTEN more effectively than those expressing mutant PTEN.

Among the 55 cases of SNIP, 30 cases were without dysplasia subtypes, 11 cases were with dysplasia subtypes, and 14 cases with canceration to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) subtypes. PTEN and HIF-1α expression in SNIP was detected by immunohistochemistry. The differences between NM and SNIP, and among the three subtypes were analyzed, and the relationship between PTEN, HIF-1α expression and SNIP recurrence and the correlation between PTEN expression and HIF-1α expression were also analyzed.

Alterations in the density of PBR seem to be a sensitive indicator of stress: up-regulation after acute stress and down-regulation induced by repeated stress. PBR-specific ligands are involved in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation, and their binding is increased in some cancer tumors. Numerous studies in various endocrine organs have revealed that PBR are located in specific regions or tissues in the organs. Furthermore, PBR densities in various organs subject to hormonal control are regulated by organotropic hormones. At least in some cases, BZ ligands do not exert a specific effect in an organ, but rather modulate the well-documented effects of that particular hormone. To the best of our knowledge, BZ ligand action in peripheral tissues is dependent on recognition of PBR, which may suggest a receptor-mediated action.",

Statins, potent inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, display anticancer activity. The molecular mechanisms by which statins block cancer cell growth are poorly understood. We demonstrate that in the tumors derived from MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell xenografts, simvastatin significantly inhibited phosphorylation of Akt with concomitant attenuation of the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl(XL). In many cancer cells, Bcl(XL) is a target of NFkappaB. Simvastatin inhibited the DNA binding and transcriptional activities of NFkappaB resulting in marked reduction in transcription of Bcl(XL). Signals transmitted by anti-neoplastic mechanism implanted in the cancer cells serve to obstruct the initial outgrowth of tumors. One such mechanism represents the action of the tumor suppressor protein PTEN, which negatively regulates Akt kinase activity. We provide the first evidence for significantly increased levels of PTEN in the tumors of simvastatin-administered mice. Importantly, simvastatin markedly prevented binding of NFkappaB to the two canonical recognition elements, NFRE-1 and NFRE-2 present in the PTEN promoter. Contrary to the transcriptional suppression of Bcl(XL), simvastatin significantly increased the transcription of PTEN. Furthermore, expression of NFkappaB p65 subunit inhibited transcription of PTEN, resulting in reduced protein expression, which leads to enhanced phosphorylation of Akt. Taken together, our data present a novel bifaceted mechanism where simvastatin acts on a nodal transcription factor NFkappaB, which attenuates the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl(XL) and simultaneously derepresses the expression of anti-proliferative/proapoptotic tumor suppressor PTEN to prevent breast cancer cell growth.",

In this study, the presence of C-terminus mutations was confirmed through sequencing of different human tumor samples. The kinase CKII-mediated phosphorylation of PTEN at these sites makes it a loopy structure competing with the E3 ligases for binding to its lipid anchoring C2 domain. Accordingly, it was found that PTEN-CT expressing stable cell lines could inhibit tumorigenesis in syngenic breast tumor models. Therefore, we designed a novel exosome-mediated delivery of the intrinsic PTEN domain, PTEN-CT into different cancer cells and observed reduced proliferation, migration, and colony forming ability. The delivery of exosome containing PTEN-CT to breast tumor mice model was found to result in significant regression in tumor size with the tumor sections showing increased apoptosis. Here, we also report for the first time an active PTEN when its C2 domain is bound by PTEN-CT, probably rendering its anti-tumorigenic activities through the protein phosphatase activity. Therefore, therapeutic interventions that focus on PTEN E3 ligase inhibition through exosome-mediated PTEN-CT delivery can be a probable route in treating cancers with low PTEN expression. ",

Immunohistochemical staining for PTEN protein was performed with the labeled streptavidin-biotin method on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue samples. PTEN expression was represented as the staining score.;Immunohistochemistry showed that the nuclei of cells were positive for PTEN. The PTEN staining score of normal endometrium was significantly higher in the proliferative phase than in the secretory phase. The scores of various endometrial hyperplasias were not significantly different from each other, regardless of the type of hyperplasia. The PTEN staining scores of endometrioid adenocarcinomas were 7.6+/-5.2 in G1, 9.6+/-5.2 in G2, and 11.9+/-3.7 in G3, and increased significantly as the histological grade increased. PTEN staining score was not significantly correlated with clinicopathological parameters such as FIGO stage, myometrial invasion, lymph-vascular space invasion (LVSI), lymph node metastasis or group, but was significantly correlated with labeling indices (LIs) of cell cycle regulators such as Ki-67, cdk2, cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin E, p27, and p53. The PTEN staining score of p53-wild cases was significantly lower than that of p53-mutant ones, but there was no significant difference of the score in cases with different PTEN gene status. PTEN expression was significantly lower in cases with both high levels of estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor.;PTEN protein expression was decreased in well-differentiated and less growth-aggressive endometrial carcinoma with wild-type p53 gene and high levels of ER and PR.

In an attempt to expand this mouse model of endometrial tumorigenesis and to further our understanding of the association betweenPten mutations and DNA mismatch repair deficiency, we generated Ptenheterozygous, Mlh1-null (mismatch repair deficient) mice. Significantly, the majority ofPten(+/-)/Mlh1(-/-)mice developed polypoid lesions in the endometrium at 6 to 9 weeks of age. By 14 to 18 weeks, all of the double-mutant mice had lesions histologically similar to those seen inPten(+/-) mice, and two of them exhibited invasive disease. Moreover, the frequency of loss of the wild-type Pten allele in the double-mutant mice at 14 to 18 weeks was similar to that seen in lesions from 40-week-old Pten(+/-) mice.

In the present study, we evaluated the potential of the long-lived positron emitter (89)Zr to predict biodistribution of the residualizing therapeutic radiometals (88)Y (as a substitute for (90)Y) and (177)Lu when labeled to the monoclonal antibody (mAb) cetuximab via different types of chelates. Cetuximab was selected as a model mAb because it abundantly internalizes after binding to the epidermal growth factor receptor.;Cetuximab was labeled with (89)Zr using succinylated desferrioxamine B (N-sucDf). The chelates p-benzyl isothiocyanate-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7, 10-tetraacetic acid (p-SCN-Bz-DOTA) and p-isothiocyanatobenzyl diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (p-SCN-Bz-DTPA) were both used for radiolabeling with (88)Y and (177)Lu. For measurement of the in vitro stability of each of the 5 radioimmunoconjugates, samples were incubated in freshly prepared human serum at 37 degrees C up to 16 d. Biodistribution was assessed at 24, 48, 72, and 144 h after intraperitoneal coinjection of the PET and RIT conjugates in nude mice bearing the squamous cell carcinoma xenograft line A431.;Cetuximab premodification with N-sucDf, p-SCN-Bz-DOTA, or p-SCN-Bz-DTPA resulted in chelate-to-mAb molar ratios of about 1. After radiolabeling and purification, the radiochemical purity and immunoreactive fraction of the conjugates always exceeded 97% and 93%, respectively. All conjugates were stable in serum, showing a radioactivity release of less than 5% until day 7. From day 7 until day 16, an enhanced release was observed for the (89)Zr-N-sucDf, (88)Y-p-SCN-Bz-DTPA, and (177)Lu-p-SCN-Bz-DTPA conjugates. The coinjected PET and RIT conjugates showed similar biodistributions, except for the thighbone and sternum. For example, the (89)Zr-N-sucDf conjugate showed a 2.0-2.5 times higher radioactivity accretion in the thighbone than did the RIT conjugates at 72 h after injection.;In view of the advantages of PET over SPECT, (89)Zr-immuno-PET is a promising modality for in vivo scouting of (90)Y- and (177)Lu-labeled mAbs, although care should be taken when estimating bone marrow doses.",

The objective of this study was to apply two DMAs to the United States FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) database to see whether signals of potentially fatal AEs with cancer drugs might have been identified earlier than with traditional methods.;Screening algorithms used for analysis were the multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS) and proportional reporting ratios (PRRs). Data mining was performed on data from the FDA AERS database. When a signal was identified, it was compared with that in the year in which the event was added to package insert and/or the year a \"case series\" was published. A recent publication summarizing the time of dissemination of information on potentially fatal AEs to cancer drugs provided the data set for analysis.;The peer-reviewed published analysis contained 21 drugs and 26 drug-event combinations (DECs) that were considered sufficiently specific for data mining. Twenty-four of the DECs generated a signal of disproportionate reporting with PRRs (6 at 1 year and 16 from 2 years to 18 years prior to either a published \"case series\" or a package insert change) and 20 with MGPS (3 at 1 year and 11 from 2 years to 16 years prior to either a published \"case series\" or a package insert change). Two DECs did not signal with either DMA.;At least one commonly cited DMA generated a signal of disproportionate reporting for 24 of 26 DECs for selected cancer drugs. For 16 DECs, one could conclude that a signal was generated well in advance (> or =2 years) of standard techniques in use with at least one DMA. DMAs might be useful in supplementing traditional surveillance strategies with oncology drugs and other drugs with similar features. (i.e., drugs that may be approved on an accelerated basis, are known to have serious toxicity, are administered to patients with substantial and complicated comorbid illness, are not available to the general medical community, and may have a high frequency of \"off-label\" use).",

        "Doc_abstract":"PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene that is frequently mutated or deleted in a variety of human cancers including human gastric cancer. PTEN functions primarily as a lipid phosphatase and plays a key role in the regulation of the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway, thereby modulating cell proliferation and cell survival. On the other hand, the IGF system plays an important role in cell proliferation and cell survival via the PI3 kinase/Akt and MAP kinase pathways in many cancer cells. To characterize the impact of PTEN on the IGF-IGFR-IGFBP axis in gastric cancer, we overexpressed PTEN using an adenovirus gene transfer system in human gastric adenocarcinoma cells, SNU-484 and SNU-663, which lack PTEN. Overexpression of PTEN inhibited serum-induced as well as IGF-I-induced cell proliferation as compared to control cells. PTEN overexpression resulted in a significant decrease in the expression of IGF-I, -II, and IGF-IR. Interestingly, amongst the six IGFBPs, only IGFBP-3 was upregulated by PTEN, whereas IGFBP-4 and -6 were reduced. The IGFBP-3 promoter activity assay and Western immunoblotting demonstrate that PTEN regulates IGFBP-3 at the transcriptional level. In addition, the PI3 kinase inhibitor, LY294002, upregulates IGFBP-3 expression but downregulates IGF-I and IGF-II, indicating that PTEN controls IGFBP-3 and IGFs by an Akt-dependent pathway. These findings suggest that PTEN may inhibit antiapoptotic IGF actions not only by blocking the IGF-IGFR-induced Akt activity, but also by regulating expression of components of the IGF system, in particular, upregulation of IGFBP-3, which is known to exert antiproliferative effects through IGF-dependent and IGF-independent mechanisms in cancer cells.",

This syndrome is an autosomal dominant cancer predisposing syndrome due to a germline mutation in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene.;In this study, a representative family case of Li-Fraumeni syndrome is described. The proband of this family was a 43-year-old male who had osteosarcoma of the mandible and a positive family history of cancer. His mother died at the age of 29 of brain cancer; his sister died at the age of 18 of breast cancer; his brother died at the age of 36 of liver cancer; and another sister of his died at the age of 16 of leukemia. Complete sequence analysis of the TP53 and PTEN genes was performed in this family. We used standard diagnostic tools such as sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) to analyze these two genes in this family. The exons and flanking exon-intron junctions of the TP53 and PTEN genes were sequenced.;We detected a germline mutation in the TP53 gene in this family that was previously reported as somatic mutation in LFS in the catalogue of somatic mutations in cancer (COSMIC). In addition, according to the International Agency for Research of Cancer (IARC) database, a 19-year-old male patient with sarcoma was recently reported to have this germline mutation. We also found two new IVS variations in the PTEN gene, one of which can be a suggestive evidence of an effect on the splicing of PTEN.;Genomic modifications for tumor risk and genotype-phenotype correlations in LFS are still to be identified. We believe every new finding in this area can provide new insights into the pathogenesis and progression of Li-Fraumeni syndrome.",

We modified the structure of matrine and obtained a new matrine derivative, WM130 (C30N4H40SO5F), which exhibited better pharmacological activities than matrine. In this study, we investigated the antitumor activity and the underlying mechanisms of WM130 on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in vitro and in vivo, and found that WM130 inhibited the proliferation, invasion, migration and induced apoptosis of HCC cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, after treatment with WM130, the expressions of p-EGFR, p-ERK, p-AKT, MMP-2 and the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax were significantly down-regulated, whereas the expression of PTEN was increased in HCC cells. Moreover, WM130 inhibited Huh-7 xenograft tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner after intravenous administration. Immunohistochemistry results demonstrated that WM130 treatment resulted in down-regulation of p-EGFR, MMP-2, and Ki67 and up-regulation of PTEN. The findings indicated that WM130 could inhibit cell proliferation, invasion, migration and induced apoptosis in HCC cells by suppressing EGFR/ERK/MMP-2 and PTEN/AKT signaling pathways and may be a novel effective candidate for HCC treatment.

Herein, we report that, in breast cancer cells, progesterone (OHPg), through its cognate receptor PR-B, positively modulates PTEN expression by inducing its mRNA and protein levels, and increasing PTEN-promoter activity. The OHPg-dependent up-regulation of PTEN gene activity requires binding of the PR-B to an Sp1-rich region within the PTEN gene promoter. Indeed, ChIP and EMSA analyses showed that OHPg treatment induced the occupancy of PTEN promoter by PR and Sp1 together with transcriptional coactivators such as SRC1 and CBP. PR-B isoform knockdown abolished the complex formation indicating its specific involvement. The OHPg/PR-B dependent induction of PTEN causes the down-regulation of PI3K/AKT signal, switching on the autophagy process through an enhanced expression of UVRAG and leading to a reduced cell survival. Altogether these findings highlight a novel functional connection between OHPg/PR-B and tumour suppressor pathways in breast cancer. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"With tremendous advances in sequencing and analysis in recent years, a wealth of genetic information has become available to identify and classify breast cancer into five main subtypes - luminal A, luminal B, claudin-low, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-enriched, and basal-like. Current treatment decisions are often based on these classifications, and while more beneficial than any single treatment for all breast cancers, targeted therapeutics have exhibited limited success with most of the subtypes. Luminal B breast cancers are associated with early relapse following endocrine therapy and often exhibit a poor prognosis that is similar to that of the aggressive basal-like breast cancers. Identifying genetic components that contribute to the luminal B endocrine resistant phenotype has become imperative. To this end, numerous groups have identified activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway as a common recurring event in luminal B cancers with poor outcome. Examining the pathways downstream of PI3K, Fu and colleagues have recreated a human model of the luminal B subtype of breast cancer. The authors were able to reduce expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), the negative regulator of PI3K, using inducible short hairpin RNAs. By varying the expression of PTEN, the authors effectively conferred endocrine resistance and recapitulated the luminal B gene expression signature. Using this system in vitro and in vivo, they then tested the ability of selective kinase inhibitors downstream of PI3K to enhance current endocrine therapies. A combination of fulvestrant, which blocks ligand-dependent and -independent estrogen receptor signaling, with protein kinase B inhibition was found to overcome endocrine resistance. These findings squarely place PTEN expression levels at the nexus of luminal B breast cancers and indicates that patients with PTEN-low estrogen receptor-positive tumors might benefit from combined endocrine and PI3K pathway therapies.

Patient was diagnosed with stage III (T3, N1a, MO) medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), multicentric micropapillary thyroid carcinoma, scapular and lumbar melanomas (Clark II, Breslow II), and lobular invasive breast carcinoma (T1a, NO, MO). All tumors present in our patient except micropapillary thyroid carcinomas were investigated for gene alterations known to have a key role in cancer promotion and progression. Tumor samples were screened for the p16 alterations (loss of heterozygosity and homozygous deletions), loss of heterozygosity of PTEN, p53 alterations (mutational status and loss of heterozygosity) and mutational status of RET, HRAS and KRAS. Each type of tumor investigated had specific pattern of analyzed genetic alterations. The most prominent genetic changes were mutual alterations in PTEN and p53 tumor suppressors present in breast cancer and two melanomas. These co-alterations could be crucial for promoting development of multiple malignancies. Moreover the insertion in 4(th) codon of HRAS gene was common for all tumor types investigated. It represents frameshift mutation introducing stop codon at position 5 which prevents synthesis of a full-length protein. Since the inactivated RAS enhances sensitivity to tamoxifen and radiotherapy this genetic alteration could be considered as a good prognostic factor for this patient. ",

The basal-like breast cancer subtype represents one of the most aggressive and lethal types of breast cancer, and due to poor mechanistic understanding, it lacks targeted therapy. Many basal-like breast cancer patient samples display alterations of established drivers of cancer development, including elevated expression of EGFR, p53 inactivating mutations and loss of expression of the tumor suppressor PTEN; however, their contribution to human basal-like breast cancer pathogenesis remains ill-defined. Using non-transformed human mammary epithelial cells, we set out to determine whether altering EGFR, p53 and PTEN in different combinations could contribute to basal-like breast cancer progression through transformation of cells. Altering PTEN in combination with either p53 or EGFR in contrast to any of the single alterations caused increased growth of transformed colonies in soft agar. Concomitantly modifying all three genes led to the highest rate of cellular proliferation and the greatest degree of anchorage-independent colony formation. Results from our effort to engineer a model of BBC expressing alterations of EGFR, p53 and PTEN suggest that these changes are cooperative and likely play a causal role in basal-like breast cancer pathogenesis. Consideration should be given to targeting EGFR and restoring p53 and PTEN signaling simultaneously as a strategy for treatment of this subtype of breast cancer.",

However, the mechanisms by which cancer cells evade host immune responses remain largely elusive. Here we study the phenomena of immune evasion in malignant melanoma cells. We find that the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is an important regulator of the host immune response against melanoma cells. Mechanistically, PTEN represses the expression of immunosuppressive cytokines by blocking the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. In melanoma cells lacking PTEN, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activates the transcription of immunosuppressive cytokines in a PI3K-dependent manner. Furthermore, conditioned media from PTEN-deficient, patient-derived short-term melanoma cultures and established melanoma cell lines blocked the production of the interleukin-12 (IL-12) in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Inhibition of IL-12 production was rescued by restoring PTEN or using neutralizing antibodies against the immunosuppressive cytokines. Furthermore, we report that PTEN, as an alternative mechanism to promote the host immune response against cancer cells, represses the expression of programmed cell death 1 ligand, a known repressor of the host immune response. Finally, to establish the clinical significance of our results, we analyzed malignant melanoma patient samples with or without brisk host responses. These analyses confirmed that PTEN loss is associated with a higher percentage of malignant melanoma samples with non-brisk host responses compared with samples with brisk host responses. Collectively, these results establish that PTEN functions as a melanoma tumor suppressor in part by regulating the host immune response against melanoma cells and highlight the importance of assessing PTEN status before recruiting melanoma patients for immunotherapies.

Hsp27 interacts with other proteins such as β-catenin, histone deacetylase HDAC6, transcription factor STAT2 and procaspase-3. Phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) is a tumor suppressor gene that is deleted in many human tumors. The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is negatively regulated by PTEN. Hsp27 is described as a key component of the Akt signaling cascade: Akt, BAD, Forkhead transcription factors, Hsp27, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-3 and -6. Here, we have examined whether the downregulation of Hsp27 by siHsp27 affects the PTEN levels in the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line. PTEN was detected with two different antibodies using western blots and immunocytochemistry. p-Akt was also evaluated by western blot. In addition, Hsp27 and PTEN were immunoprecipitated to know whether these proteins interact. Intracellular colocalization studies were carried out by confocal microscopy. A significant reduction in the Hsp27 levels was noted in the siHsp27 transfected cells. These Hsp27 downregulated cells showed a significant increased expression of PTEN. The MW 76 and 55 kDa PTEN forms were upregulated as revealed by two different antibodies. The phosphatase activity of PTEN seems to be active because p-Akt levels were reduced. Hsp27 immunoprecipitation was bringing PTEN and vice versa, these two proteins seem to interact at cytoplasmic level by FRET. Downregulation of Hsp27 stabilized PTEN protein levels. Chaperone-assisted E3 ligase C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) levels were not significantly influenced by Hsp27 downregulation. In conclusion, we report a novel function of Hsp27 modulating the PTEN levels in human breast cancer cells suggesting an interaction between these two molecules.",

Using conditional deletion of the p110 catalytic isoforms of PI3K to predict sensitivity of cancer types to such inhibitors, we and others have demonstrated that tumors deficient of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) are often dependent on the p110β isoform of PI3K. Because human cancers usually arise due to multiple genetic events, determining whether other genetic alterations might alter the p110 isoform requirements of PTEN-null tumors becomes a critical question. To investigate further the roles of p110 isoforms in PTEN-deficient tumors, we used a mouse model of ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma driven by concomitant activation of the rat sarcoma protein Kras, which is known to activate p110α, and loss of PTEN. In this model, ablation of p110β had no effect on tumor growth, whereas p110α ablation blocked tumor formation. Because ablation of PTEN alone is often p110β dependent, we wondered if the same held true in the ovary. Because PTEN loss alone in the ovary did not result in tumor formation, we tested PI3K isoform dependence in ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) cells deficient in both PTEN and p53. These cells were indeed p110β dependent, whereas OSEs expressing activated Kras with or without PTEN loss were p110α dependent. Furthermore, isoform-selective inhibitors showed a similar pattern of the isoform dependence in established Kras(G12D)/PTEN-deficient tumors. Taken together, our data suggest that, whereas in some tissues PTEN-null tumors appear to inherently depend on p110β, the p110 isoform reliance of PTEN-deficient tumors may be altered by concurrent mutations that activate p110α.

Indeed, the PTEN network regulates a broad spectrum of biological functions, modulating the flow of information from membrane-bound growth factor receptors to nuclear transcription factors, occurring in concert with other tumor suppressors and oncogenic signaling pathways. PTEN acts through its lipid and protein phosphatase activity and other non-enzymatic mechanisms. Studies conducted over the past 10 years have expanded our understanding of the biological role of PTEN, showing that in addition to its ability to regulate proliferation and cell survival, it also plays an intriguing role in regulating genomic stability, cell migration, stem cell self-renewal, and tumor microenvironment. Changes in PTEN protein levels, location, and enzymatic activity through various molecular mechanisms can generate a continuum of functional PTEN levels in inherited syndromes, sporadic cancers, and other diseases. PTEN activity can indeed, be modulated by mutations, epigenetic silencing, transcriptional repression, aberrant protein localization, and post-translational modifications. This review will discuss our current understanding of the biological role of PTEN, how PTEN expression and activity are regulated, and the consequences of PTEN dysregulation in human malignant tumors.

Because it targets tumor-suppressor genes it has been linked to tumor progression. In this study we investigated the role of miR-21 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), and its possible mechanism.;Expression of miR-21 was detected by stem-loop RT-PCR in tissue from 76 invasive ESCC at stage I-IV and in their corresponding para-cancerous histological normal tissues (PCHNT). Thirty endoscopic esophageal mucosal biopsy specimens from non-tumor patients were used as controls. Expression of PTEN in 76 paired ESCC and PCHNT was investigated by real-time RT-PCR and an immunohistochemical method, respectively. Paired tumor and PCHNT specimens of 20 ESCC cases were randomly selected for western blot analysis. The effect of miR-21 on PTEN expression was assessed in the ESCC cell line with an miR-21 inhibitor to reduce miR-21 expression. Furthermore, the roles of miR-21 in cell biology were analyzed by use of miR-21 inhibitor-transfected cells.;Stem-loop RT-PCR revealed miR-21 was significantly overexpressed in ESCC tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-21 correlated with tumor status, lymph node metastasis, and clinical stage. We demonstrated that knockdown of miR-21 significantly increased expression of PTEN protein. Consequent PTEN expression reduced cell proliferation, invasion, and migration.;Our findings suggest that miR-21 could be a potential oncomiR, probably by regulation of PTEN, and a novel prognostic factor for ESCC patients.",

PTEN is a phosphatase that can act on both polypeptide and phosphoinositide substrates in vitro. The PTEN structure reveals a phosphatase domain that is similar to protein phosphatases but has an enlarged active site important for the accommodation of the phosphoinositide substrate. The structure also reveals that PTEN has a C2 domain. The PTEN C2 domain binds phospholipid membranes in vitro, and mutation of basic residues that could mediate this reduces PTEN's membrane affinity and its ability to suppress the growth of glioblastoma tumor cells. The phosphatase and C2 domains associate across an extensive interface, suggesting that the C2 domain may serve to productively position the catalytic domain on the membrane.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The PTEN protein has a single catalytic domain possessing both lipid phosphoinositol and protein phosphatase activities. The lipid phosphoinositol phosphatase activity is essential for PTEN to block the cell cycle in the G1 phase and thereby to suppress tumor formation and progression (Cantley, L. C., and Neel, B. G. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 96, 4240-4245), although the mechanisms governing PTEN activity under normal and neoplastic growth conditions remain unclear. Here, we report that PTEN interacts physically and functionally with PCAF, a histone acetyltransferase that regulates gene transcription through interaction with p300/CBP and various sequence-specific transcription factors (Nakatani, Y. (2001) Genes Cells 6, 79-86). Expression of PCAF results in increased acetylation of lysine residues (Lys125 and Lys128) within the catalytic cleft of PTEN, a structure essential for phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate specificity (Lee, J. O., Yang, H., Georgescu, M. M., Di Cristofano, A., Maehama, T., Shi, Y., Dixon, J. E., Pandolfi, P., and Pavletich, N. P. (1999) Cell 99, 323-334). The acetylation of PTEN caused by PCAF expression depends on the presence of growth factors. Reduction of endogenous PCAF activity using shRNA results in a loss of PTEN acetylation in response to growth factors and restores the ability of PTEN to down-regulate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling and to induce G1 cell cycle arrest. The retention of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT signaling and cell cycle regulatory activities of acetylation-resistant PTEN K125R and K128R mutants in the presence of enforced PCAF expression suggest a causal relationship. Together, these findings indicate a mechanism of PTEN regulation that forges a link between distinct cancer-relevant pathways central to the control of growth factor signaling and gene expression.",

However, the role of miR-19a/b in MDR in gastric cancer and its underlying mechanism remain unclear. In this study, we found that miR-19a/b were upregulated in MDR cell lines. Our results also showed that miR-19a/b upregulation decreased the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to anticancer drugs. We further confirmed that miR-19a/b accelerated the ADR efflux of gastric cancer cells by increasing the levels of mdr1 and P-gp and that miR-19a/b suppressed drug-induced apoptosis by regulating Bcl-2 and Bax. Finally, we verified that PTEN, an inhibitor of AKT phosphorylation, is the functional target of miR-19a/b. Overall, these findings demonstrated that miR-19a/b promote MDR in gastric cancer cells by targeting PTEN.",

The diffuse-type carcinoma was more inclined to invasion into muscularis propria, lymphatic invasion and lymph node metastasis, and belonged to higher International Union against Cancer (UICC) staging (p<0.05) compared with intestinal-type counterparts. Expression of FHIT, PTEN, Ki-67, caspase-3, mutant p53 and EMPPRIN was higher in intestinal-type carcinomas than in diffuse-type carcinomas (p<0.05). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with intestinal-type carcinomas had a higher cumulative survival rate (p<0.05).;Intestinal-type gastric carcinomas with a more favourable prognosis frequently show high levels of proliferation and apoptosis, and always accompany strong expression of FHIT, PTEN and mutant p53 and EMMPRIN. EMMPRIN expression might underlie the molecular basis of liver metastasis and higher proliferation of intestinal-type gastric carcinomas in Japan.
