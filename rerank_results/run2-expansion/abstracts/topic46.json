Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), via activation of its receptor, FGFR-1, has been postulated to be an important inducer of host stromal response and angiogenesis. To assess the putative role of tumor-associated stromal cells and vessels in tumor progression, we studied non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from 84 patients, including 51 squamous cell carcinomas and 33 nonsquamous cell carcinomas, by immunohistochemical detection. bFGF and FGFR-1 immunoreactivity was observed in tumor and in tumor-associated stromal cells and vessels. The expression of bFGF and FGFR-1 in stromal cells was higher in squamous than in non-squamous cell carcinomas (respectively, P = .007 and P = .0004). We found that bFGF and FGFR-1 expression in tumor and tumor-associated stromal cells and vessels was directly correlated with host stromal response, as assessed by intratumoral extension of stroma, but not with angiogenic response, as assessed by microvessel count. Although FGFR-1 expression of tumor cells was directly correlated with T-stage (P = .03), bFGF expressions of tumor-associated stromal cells and vessels were inversely correlated with lymph node metastasis (respectively, P = .0001 and P = .0002) and advanced pathological stage (respectively, P = .03 and P = .01). These findings suggest that bFGF might mediate host stromal response in NSCLC and that the expression of bFGF in tumor-associated stromal cells and vessels might have an inhibitory role in NSCLC progression.",

Among them Aea4 and Aea25 showed strong FGFR1`inhibition and high selectivity over other receptor kinases. The kinase inhibitory assay in different ATP concentrations and computer-assistant molecular docking showed that the FGFR1 inhibition mode of both Aea4 and Aea25 was non-ATP-competitive. The in vitro and in vivo study on anticancer efficacy of Aea4 and Aea25 against non-small cell lung cancer involves inhibition of cell proliferation, apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest with no toxicity. Thus, these two novel non-ATP competitive inhibitors derived from NDGA may have a great therapeutic potential in the treatment of NSCLC.

The FGFR inhibitor nintedanib has recently been approved for treatment of lung adenocarcinoma and is currently evaluated for small cell lung cancer (SCLC). However, tumor recurrence due to development of nintedanib resistance might occur. Hence, we aimed at characterizing the molecular mechanisms underlying acquired nintedanib resistance in FGFR1-driven lung cancer. Chronic nintedanib exposure of the FGFR1-driven SCLC cell line DMS114 (DMS114/NIN) but not of two NSCLC cell lines induced massive overexpression of the multidrug-resistance transporter ABCB1. Indeed, we proved nintedanib to be both substrate and modulator of ABCB1-mediated efflux. Importantly, the oncogenic FGFR1 signaling axis remained active in DMS114/NIN cells while bioinformatic analyses suggested hyperactivation of the endothelin-A receptor (ETAR) signaling axis. Indeed, ETAR inhibition resensitized DMS114/NIN cells against nintedanib by downregulation of ABCB1 expression. PKC and downstream NFκB were identified as major downstream players in ETAR-mediated ABCB1 hyperactivation. Summarizing, ABCB1 needs to be considered as a factor underlying nintedanib resistance. Combination approaches with ETAR antagonists or switching to non-ABCB1 substrate FGFR inhibitors represent innovative strategies to manage nintedanib resistance in lung cancer.",

The IHC scores for each RTK were almost equivalent between the LCNEC and SCLC groups, but they were significantly different from those of the ADC or SQCC groups. In particular, c-Kit was the only RTK that was remarkably expressed in both LCNECs and SCLCs. On the other hand, about 20 % of the HGNEC tumors exhibited strongly positive RTK expression, and this rate was similar to those for the ADC and SQCC tumors. Intriguingly, strongly positive RTKs were almost mutually exclusive in individual tumors.;Compared with ADC or SQCC, LCNEC and SCLC had similar expression profiles for the major RTKs.

Although lung adenocarcinomas with EGFR mutations or EML4-ALK fusions respond to treatment by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibition, respectively, squamous cell lung cancer currently lacks therapeutically exploitable genetic alterations. We conducted a systematic search in a set of 232 lung cancer specimens for genetic alterations that were therapeutically amenable and then performed high-resolution gene copy number analyses. We identified frequent and focal fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) amplification in squamous cell lung cancer (n = 155), but not in other lung cancer subtypes, and, by fluorescence in situ hybridization, confirmed the presence of FGFR1 amplifications in an independent cohort of squamous cell lung cancer samples (22% of cases). Using cell-based screening with the FGFR inhibitor PD173074 in a large (n = 83) panel of lung cancer cell lines, we demonstrated that this compound inhibited growth and induced apoptosis specifically in those lung cancer cells carrying amplified FGFR1. We validated the FGFR1 dependence of FGFR1-amplified cell lines by FGFR1 knockdown and by ectopic expression of an FGFR1-resistant allele (FGFR1(V561M)), which rescued FGFR1-amplified cells from PD173074-mediated cytotoxicity. Finally, we showed that inhibition of FGFR1 with a small molecule led to significant tumor shrinkage in vivo. Thus, focal FGFR1 amplification is common in squamous cell lung cancer and associated with tumor growth and survival, suggesting that FGFR inhibitors may be a viable therapeutic option in this cohort of patients.",

Treatment with a single TKI represents a logical step toward personalized cancer therapy, but intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms limit their long-term benefit. In this study, we deployed RNAi-based functional genomic screens to identify protein kinases controlling the intrinsic sensitivity of FGFR1-dependent lung cancer and head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) cells to ponatinib, a multikinase FGFR-active inhibitor. We identified and validated a synthetic lethal interaction between MTOR and ponatinib in non-small cell lung carcinoma cells. In addition, treatment with MTOR-targeting shRNAs and pharmacologic inhibitors revealed that MTOR is an essential protein kinase in other FGFR1-expressing cancer cells. The combination of FGFR inhibitors and MTOR or AKT inhibitors resulted in synergistic growth suppression in vitro. Notably, tumor xenografts generated from FGFR1-dependent lung cancer cells exhibited only modest sensitivity to monotherapy with the FGFR-specific TKI, AZD4547, but when combined with the MTOR inhibitor, AZD2014, significantly attenuated tumor growth and prolonged survival. Our findings support the existence of a signaling network wherein FGFR1-driven ERK and activated MTOR/AKT represent distinct arms required to induce full transformation. Furthermore, they suggest that clinical efficacy of treatments for FGFR1-driven lung cancers and HNSCC may be achieved by combining MTOR inhibitors and FGFR-specific TKIs.",

We have recently reported that FGFR1 amplification occurs in 20% of pulmonary squamous cell carcinomas, and preclinical tests have shown that these alterations are therapeutically tractable. These findings make FGFR1 amplification a potential biomarker for lung cancer treatment. Squamous cell carcinomas of the lung are characterized by an uneven FGFR1 gene copy number distribution. Therefore, fluorescence in situ hybridization assays need to address focality and heterogeneity of FGFR1 in these tumors. Here, we review our proposal for a reading and evaluation strategy.

Of note, these three comprehensive genomic analyses and other molecular analyses of small-cell lung cancer have contributed to the identification of patient populations that may benefit from promising targeted agents, such as those affecting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, FGFR1, RET or AURORA kinase inhibitors.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) detects chromosomal alterations that underlie the development and progression of cancer, and pinpoints targets of new anticancer drugs. Detection of such targets by FISH can be of diagnostic utility in morphologically difficult cases. Multitarget FISH with four different chromosomal probes improves the sensitivity of cytology in the diagnosis of lung cancer and clarifies equivocal cytological findings. FISH is becoming increasingly important in the field of predictive marker analysis. FISH is the gold standard to identify ALK rearrangements for treatment with the ALK inhibitor crizotinib (Xalkori). EGFR mutation analysis is the method of choice for selecting patients for therapy with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), whereas the EGFR gene copy number has not been confirmed as a reliable predictive marker. MET amplification is an important mechanism of secondary resistance to EGFR TKIs and a candidate predictive marker for targeted second-line treatment of TKI-resistant non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. FGFR1 amplification is a promising new marker in squamous cell carcinoma that may predict the response to FGFR1 inhibitors.

In this study, we evaluated fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and ligand expression in primary SCLC samples.;FGFR1 protein expression, messenger RNA (mRNA) levels, and gene copy number were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC), mRNA in situ hybridization, and silver in situ hybridization, respectively, in primary tumors from 90 patients with SCLC. Protein and mRNA expression of the FGF2 and FGF9 ligands were determined by IHC and mRNA in situ hybridization, respectively. In addition, a second cohort of 24 SCLC biopsy samples with known FGFR1 amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization was assessed for FGFR1 protein expression by IHC. Spearman correlation analysis was performed to evaluate associations of FGFR1, FGF2 and FGF9 protein levels, respective mRNA levels, and FGFR1 gene copy number.;FGFR1 protein expression by IHC demonstrated a significant correlation with FGFR1 mRNA levels (p < 0.0001) and FGFR1 gene copy number (p = 0.03).

Large-scale genomics have recently expanded the lung cancer landscape with FGFR1 amplification found in 10-20% of squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). However, the response rates have been low for biomarker-directed fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor therapy in SCC, which contrasts to the relatively high rates of response seen in EGFR mutant and ALK-translocated lung cancers treated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors and ALK inhibitors, respectively. In order to better understand the low response rates of FGFR1-amplified lung cancers to FGFR inhibitors, relationships between gene copy number, mRNA expression and protein expression of FGFR1 were assessed in cell lines, tumor specimens and data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The importance of these factors for the sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors was determined by analyzing drug screen data and conducting in vitro and in vivo experiments. We report that there was a discrepancy between FGFR1 amplification level and FGFR1 protein expression in a number of these cell lines, and the cancers with unexpectedly low FGFR1 expression were uniformly resistant to the different FGFR inhibitors. Further interrogation of the receptor tyrosine kinase activity in these discordant cell lines revealed co-activation of HER2 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRα) caused by gene amplification or ligand overexpression maintained phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and MEK/ERK signaling even in the presence of FGFR inhibitor. Accordingly, co-inhibition of FGFR1 and HER2 or PDGFRα led to enhanced drug responses. In contrast, FGFR1-amplified high FGFR1 protein-expressing lung cancers are sensitive to FGFR inhibitor monotherapy by downregulating ERK signaling. Addition of a PI3K inhibitor to these high FGFR1 protein-expressing cancers further sensitized them to FGFR inhibitor. These data reveal that biomarker-directed trials for FGFR1-amplified SCC require assessment of FGFR1 protein expression and uncover novel therapeutic strategies for FGFR1-amplified SCC with low FGFR1 protein expression.

Patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX) are considered to be interesting candidates. However, the establishment of such model systems requires highly specialized research facilities and introduces logistic challenges. We aimed to establish an extensive well-characterized panel of NSCLC xenograft models in the context of a long-distance research network after careful control of the preanalytical steps. One hundred fresh surgically resected NSCLC specimens were shipped in survival medium at room temperature from a hospital-integrated biobank to animal facilities. Within 24 h post-surgery, tumor fragments were subcutaneously xenografted into immunodeficient mice. PDX characterization was performed by histopathological, immunohistochemical, aCGH and next-generation sequencing approaches. For this model system, the tumor take rate was 35%, with higher rates for squamous carcinoma (60%) than for adenocarcinoma (13%). Patients for whom PDX tumors were obtained had a significantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS) compared to patients for whom no PDX tumors (P = 0.039) were obtained. We established a large panel of PDX NSCLC models with a high frequency of mutations (29%) in EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, MEK1, BRAF, PTEN, and PI3KCA genes and with gene amplification (20%) of c-MET and FGFR1. This new patient-derived NSCLC xenograft collection, established regardless of the considerable time required and the distance between the clinic and the animal facilities, recapitulated the histopathology and molecular diversity of NSCLC and provides stable and reliable preclinical models for human lung cancer research.

To date, most SCLC studies have evaluated patients with surgically resectable disease. Here we sought to evaluate the genomic mutation spectrum of 'every-day' SCLC patient tumors with extensive stage disease (ES-SCLC) and to correlate mutations with the main clinical outcomes of response to chemotherapy, progression-free (PFS) and overall (OS) survival.;A total of 50 SCLC patient tumors were examined in this study; targeted exome sequencing was obtained on 42 patients and whole-exome sequencing on 8 patients. Mutated genes were correlated with clinical outcomes using Kaplan-Meier methods (PFS, OS) and logistic regression (chemo-response). RB1 protein expression was detected by either western blotting of cultured cell lysates or immunohistochemistry of tumor specimens.;In all, 39 patients had ES-SCLC; 15 patients had either primary refractory/resistant disease and 21 patients had sensitive disease. The two most frequently mutated genes were TP53 (86%) and RB1 (58%); other frequently mutated genes (>10% patients) were involved in epigenetic regulation as well as the mTOR pathway. We identified a number of low-frequency, targetable mutations, including RICTOR, FGFR1, KIT, PTCH1 and RET. Using multivariate analysis, RB1 was the only significant factor (P = 0.038) in predicting response to first-line chemotherapy, with an odds ratio of 5.58 comparing mutant RB1 with wild-type. Patients with mutant RB1 had both better OS (11.7 versus 9.1 months P = 0.04) and PFS (11.2 versus 8.6 months, P = 0.06) compared with patients with wild-type RB1. Interestingly, ∼25% of SCLC cell lines and tumor specimens expressed RB1 protein, possibly representing the subgroup with wild-type RB1.;We found that SCLC tumors harboring no mutation in RB1 had a poor response to chemotherapy.",

Finally, we detected many of the alterations found in humans in SCLC tumors from Tp53 and Rb1 double knockout mice.

However, mechanistic strategies to target tumor cells carrying such mutations are yet to be developed. This study proposes a synthetic-lethality therapy for treating cancers deficient in the SWI/SNF catalytic (ATPase) subunit, BRG1/SMARCA4. The strategy relies upon inhibition of BRM/SMARCA2, another catalytic SWI/SNF subunit with a BRG1-related activity. Immunohistochemical analysis of a cohort of non-small-cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) indicated that 15.5% (16 of 103) of the cohort, corresponding to preferentially undifferentiated tumors, was deficient in BRG1 expression. All BRG1-deficient cases were negative for alterations in known therapeutic target genes, for example, EGFR and DDR2 gene mutations, ALK gene fusions, or FGFR1 gene amplifications. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated silencing of BRM suppressed the growth of BRG1-deficient cancer cells relative to BRG1-proficient cancer cells, inducing senescence via activation of p21/CDKN1A. This growth suppression was reversed by transduction of wild-type but not ATPase-deficient BRG1. In support of these in vitro results, a conditional RNAi study conducted in vivo revealed that BRM depletion suppressed the growth of BRG1-deficient tumor xenografts. Our results offer a rationale to develop BRM-ATPase inhibitors as a strategy to treat BRG1/SMARCA4-deficient cancers, including NSCLCs that lack mutations in presently known therapeutic target genes.",

We propose that autocrine growth signaling pathways distinct from EGFR are active in NSCLC cells. To this end, gene expression profiling revealed frequent coexpression of specific fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and FGF receptors (FGFRs) in NSCLC cell lines. It is noteworthy that FGF2 and FGF9 as well as FGFR1 IIIc and/or FGFR2 IIIc mRNA and protein are frequently coexpressed in NSCLC cell lines, especially those that are insensitive to gefitinib. Specific silencing of FGF2 reduced anchorage-independent growth of two independent NSCLC cell lines that secrete FGF2 and coexpress FGFR1 IIIc and/or FGFR2 IIIc. Moreover, a TKI [(+/-)-1-(anti-3-hydroxy-cyclopentyl)-3-(4-methoxy-phenyl)-7-phenylamino-3,4-dihydro-1H-pyrimido-[4,5-d]pyrimidin-2-one (RO4383596)] that targets FGFRs inhibited basal FRS2 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation, two measures of FGFR activity, as well as proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of NSCLC cell lines that coexpress FGF2 or FGF9 and FGFRs.

Multiple FGFR mRNA splice variants were coexpressed in NSCLC cells (n = 16) with predominance of FGFR1. Accordingly, both expression of a dominant-negative FGFR1 (dnFGFR1) IIIc-green fluorescent protein fusion protein and application of FGFR small-molecule inhibitors (SU5402 and PD166866) significantly reduced growth, survival, clonogenicity, and migratory potential of the majority of NSCLC cell lines. Moreover, dnFGFR1 expression completely blocked or at least significantly attenuated s.c. tumor formation of NSCLC cells in severe combined immunodeficient mice. Xenograft tumors expressing dnFGFR1 exhibited significantly reduced size and mitosis rate, enhanced cell death, and decreased tissue invasion. When FGFR inhibitors were combined with chemotherapy, antagonistic to synergistic in vitro anticancer activities were obtained depending on the application schedule. In contrast, simultaneous blockage of FGFR- and epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated signals exerted synergistic effects.

Advances in our understanding of the underlying biology of NSCLC have revealed distinct molecular subtypes. A substantial proportion of NSCLC depends on oncogenic molecular aberrations (so-called \"driver mutations\") for their malignant phenotype. Personalized therapy encompasses the strategy of matching these subtypes with effective targeted therapies. EGFR mutations and ALK translocation are the most effectively targeted oncogenes in NSCLC. EGFR mutations and ALK gene rearrangements are successfully being targeted with specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The number of molecular subgroups of NSCLC continues to grow. The scope of this review is to discuss recent data on novel molecular targets as ROS1, BRAF, KRAS, HER2, c-MET, RET, PIK3CA, FGFR1 and DDR2. Thereby the review will focus on therapeutic strategies targeting these aberrations. Moreover, the emerging challenge of acquired resistance to initially effective therapies will be discussed. ",

However, there are very few reports on the molecular profiles of small cell lung cancers (SCLCs). We therefore conducted the present Shizuoka Lung Cancer Mutation Study to analyze genomic aberrations in patients with thoracic malignancies.;We collected samples of SCLC from a biobank system and analyzed their molecular profiles. We assessed 23 mutations in nine genes (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, NRAS, MEK1, AKT1, PTEN, and HER2) using pyrosequencing plus capillary electrophoresis. We also amplified EGFR, MET, PIK3CA, FGFR1, and FGFR2 using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the fusion genes ALK, ROS1, and RET using reverse transcription PCR.;Between July 2011 and January 2013, 60 SCLC patients were enrolled in the study. Samples included eight surgically resected snap-frozen samples, 50 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, and seven pleural effusion samples. We detected 13 genomic aberrations in nine cases (15%), including an EGFR mutation (n=1, G719A), a KRAS mutation (n=1, G12D), PIK3CA mutations (n=3, E542K, E545K, E545Q), an AKT1 mutation (n=1, E17K), a MET amplification (n=1), and PIK3CA amplifications (n=6). EGFR and KRAS mutations were found in patients with combined SCLC and adenocarcinoma. No significant differences were detected in the characteristics of patients with and without genomic aberrations. However, serum neuron-specific enolase and progastrin-releasing peptide levels were significantly higher in patients without genomic aberrations than in those with aberrations (p=0.01 and 0.04, respectively).;Genomic aberrations were found in 15% SCLC patients, with PIK3CA amplifications most frequently observed. To further our understanding of the molecular profiles of SCLC, comprehensive mutational analyses should be conducted using massive parallel sequencing.",

Those with FGFR1 amplification levels above 3.5-fold had an inferior survival. These data were confirmed in a validation cohort of 142 NSCLC. After adjusting for age, sex, performance status, stage, and histology, patients with FGFR1 amplification levels above 3.5 fold had a hazard ratio of 2.91 (95% CI- 1.14, 7.41; pvalue-0.025) for death in the validation cohort. The rates of FGFR1 amplification using the cutoff level of 3.5 were 5.1% in squamous cell and 4.1% in adenocarcinomas. There was a non-significant trend towards higher amplifications rates in heavy smokers (> 15 pack-years of cigarette consumption) as compared to light smokers.;Our data suggest that a 3.5-fold amplification of FGFR1 is of clinical importance in NSCLC.

        "Doc_abstract":"Lung cancers are characterised by abundant genetic diversity with relatively few recurrent mutations occurring at high frequency. However, the genetic alterations often affect a common group of oncogenic signalling pathways. There have been vast improvements in our understanding of the molecular biology that underpins lung cancer in recent years and this has led to a revolution in the diagnosis and treatment of lung adenocarcinomas (ADC) based on the genotype of an individual's tumour. New technologies are identifying key and potentially targetable genetic aberrations not only in adenocarcinoma but also in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung. Lung cancer mutations have been identified in v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), BRAF and the parallel phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway oncogenes and more recently in MEK and HER2 while structural rearrangements in ALK, ROS1 and possibly rearranged during transfection (RET) provide new therapeutic targets. Amplification is another mechanism of activation of oncogenes such as MET in adenocarcinoma, fibroblastgrowth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) in SCC. Intriguingly, many of these genetic alternations are associated with smoking status and with particular racial and gender differences, which may provide insight into the mechanisms of carcinogenesis and role of host factors in lung cancer development and progression. The role of tumour suppressor genes is increasingly recognised with aberrations reported in TP53, PTEN, RB1, LKB11 and p16/CDKN2A. Identification of biologically significant genetic alterations in lung cancer that lead to activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumour suppressor genes has the potential to provide further therapeutic opportunities. It is hoped that these discoveries may make a major contribution to improving outcome for patients with this poor prognosis disease. ",

Unlike non-smoker adenocarcinoma of the lung, where highly efficient tyrosine kinase inhibitors are available for treating mutant EGFR or ALK-rearranged, no targetable biomarkers are available for SQCCL. The frequent and focal amplification of FGFR1 has generated great expectations in offering new therapeutical options in case of 16-22% of SQCCL patients. Broad 3q chromosome amplification is widely recognized as the most common chromosomal aberration found in SQCCL, where PIK3CA, SOX2, ACK1, PRKCI, TP63, PLD1, ECT2, and others genes are located. Although SOX2 has been postulated as a key regulator of basal stem cells transformation and tumor progression, it seems to confer a good prognosis in SQCCL. It is known that each patient might carry a different length of 3q chromosome amplicon. Thus, we suggest that the number and the biological importance of the genes spanned along each patient's 3q amplicon might help to explain inter-individual outcome variations of the disease and its potential predictive value, especially when relevant oncogenes such as those mentioned above are implicated. Currently, there is no clinical predictive data available from clinical trials. In this review, we have focused on the potential role of FGFR1 in SQCCL prognosis. Additionally, we have explored recently available public data on the comprehensive genomic characterization of SQCCL, in relation to the protein-coding genes that have a strong gene copy number - mRNA correlation in 3q chromosome, that were previously described as potential driver oncogenes or its modifiers in SQCCL.

Using aCGH, we performed karyotype analysis of 33 small cell lung cancer (SCLC) tumors, 13 SCLC cell lines, 19 bronchial carcinoids, and 9 gastrointestinal carcinoids. In contrast to the relatively conserved karyotypes of carcinoid tumors, the karyotypes of SCLC tumors and cell lines were highly aberrant. High copy number (CN) gains were detected in SCLC tumors and cell lines in cytogenetic bands encoding JAK2, FGFR1, and MYC family members. In some of those samples, the CN of these genes exceeded 100, suggesting that they could represent driver alterations and potential drug targets in subgroups of SCLC patients. In SCLC tumors, as well as bronchial carcinoids and carcinoids of gastrointestinal origin, recurrent CN alterations were observed in 203 genes, including the RB1 gene and 59 microRNAs of which 51 locate in the DLK1-DIO3 domain. These findings suggest the existence of partially shared CN alterations in these tumor types. In contrast, CN alterations of the TP53 gene and the MYC family members were predominantly observed in SCLC. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the aCGH profile of SCLC cell lines highly resembles that of clinical SCLC specimens. Finally, by analyzing potential drug targets, we provide a genomics-based rationale for targeting the AKT-mTOR and apoptosis pathways in SCLC.",

Squamous cell lung carcinoma (SqCLC) is the second most frequent histological subtype of lung carcinomas. Recently, growth factors, growth factor receptors, and signal transduction system-related gene amplifications and mutations are extensively under investigation to estimate the prognosis and to develop individualized therapies in SqCLC. In this study, besides the signal transduction molecule phosphatidyl inositol-3-phosphate kinase (IP3K) p110α, we explored the expressions of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and receptor-1 (FGFR1) in tumor tissue and also their clinical and prognostic significance in patients with early/advanced SqCLC.;From 2005 to 2013, 129 patients (23 early, 106 advanced disease) with a histopathological SqCLC diagnosis were selected from the hospital files of Cukurova University Medical Faculty for this study. Two independent pathologists evaluated FGFR1, FGF2, and PI3K (p110α) expressions in both tumor and stromal tissues from 99 of the patients with sufficient tissue samples, using immunohistochemistry. Considering survival analysis separately for patients with both early and advanced stage diseases, the relationship between the clinical features of the patients and expressions were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses.;FGFR1 expression was found to be low in 59 (60%) patients and high in 40 (40%) patients. For FGF2; 12 (12%) patients had high, 87 (88%) patients had low expression and for IP3K; 31 (32%) patients had high and 66 (68%) patients had low expressions. In univariate analysis, overall survival (OS) was significantly associated with stage of the disease and the performance status of the patient (P<0.0001 and P<0.001). There was no significant difference in OS of the patients with either low or high expressions of FGFR1, FGF2, and IP3K. When the patients with early or advanced stage disease were separately taken into consideration, the relationship did not differ, either. Any of FGFR1, FGF2 or IP3K expressions was not found predictive for the treatment of early or advanced staged patients. On the other hand, the expressions of both FGFR1 and FGF2 were significantly different with respect to smoking, scar of tuberculosis and scar of radiotherapy (P=0.002; P=0.06 and P=0.05, respectively).;There has not been identified an effective individualized treatment for SqCLC yet. Therefore, in order to be able to develop such a treatment in the future, it is essential to identify the genetic abnormalities that are responsible for the biological behaviors and carcinogenesis of SqCLC. Although we could not show the prognostic and predictive significance of FGFR1, FGF2 and IP3K expressions in SqCLC, we determined the expression rates of FGFR1, FGF2 and IP3K as a reference for Turkish patients. In conclusion, we want to put some emphasis on the fact that, pulmonary fibrosis which is a late complication of radiotherapy at stage III disease, and the scar of tuberculosis could be associated with FGFR1 and FGF2 expressions.",

Survival rates are poor and have remained stagnant owing to chemoresistance and the high propensity to form lung metastases. In this study, we used in vivo transgenic models of c-fos oncogene-induced osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma in addition to c-Fos-inducible systems in vitro to investigate downstream signalling pathways that regulate osteosarcoma growth and metastasis. Fgfr1 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 1) was identified as a novel c-Fos/activator protein-1(AP-1)-regulated gene. Induction of c-Fos in vitro in osteoblasts and chondroblasts caused an increase in Fgfr1 RNA and FGFR1 protein expression levels that resulted in increased and sustained activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), morphological transformation and increased anchorage-independent growth in response to FGF2 ligand treatment. High levels of FGFR1 protein and activated pFRS2α signalling were observed in murine and human osteosarcomas. Pharmacological inhibition of FGFR1 signalling blocked MAPK activation and colony growth of osteosarcoma cells in vitro. Orthotopic injection in vivo of FGFR1-silenced osteosarcoma cells caused a marked twofold to fivefold decrease in spontaneous lung metastases. Similarly, inhibition of FGFR signalling in vivo with the small-molecule inhibitor AZD4547 markedly reduced the number and size of metastatic nodules. Thus deregulated FGFR signalling has an important role in osteoblast transformation and osteosarcoma formation and regulates the development of lung metastases. Our findings support the development of anti-FGFR inhibitors as potential antimetastatic therapy. ",

In this study, we aimed to establish a variety of patient-derived NSCLC models and characterize these for common genetic aberrations to provide more informative models for preclinical drug efficacy testing.;NSCLC tissues from thirty-one patients were collected and implanted into immunodeficient mice. Established xenograft models were characterized for common genetic aberrations, including detection of gene mutations within EGFR and KRAS, and genetic amplification of FGFR1 and cMET.

Anti-tumor efficacy studies using gefitinib demonstrated that the EGFR activating mutation model had superior sensitivity and that the KRAS mutation models were resistant to gefitinib. The range of gefitinib responses in the patient-derived NSCLC xenograft models were consistent with the results reported from clinical trials.

In thyroid hyperplastic lesions such as adenomatous goiter, the FGF-2 immunoreactivity in follicular cells was detected in 2 of 12 adenomatous goiters (16.7%). In contrast, FGFR-1 immunoreactivity was detected in 66.7% of cases of this disease. The endothelial cells of microvessels in the stroma adjacent to the neoplasms and hyperplastic lesions also showed cytoplasmic FGF-2 immunoreactivity. The difference between FGF-2 and FGFR-1 expression in adenomatous goiters was statistically significant (P<0.05). Furthermore, the difference in FGF-2 immunoreactivity between carcinoma and adenomatous goiter was statistically significant (P=0.0001). The present investigation demonstrated the possibility of an autocrine mechanism of action of FGF-2 in human thyroid carcinoma. Moreover, in thyroid hyperplastic lesions, FGF-2 derived from the stroma might be involved in the formation of nodular and/or diffuse goiters.",

The best examples of this approach are the kinase inhibitors that selectively target tumors bearing an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation or an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement. Emerging protein kinase inhibitors may enhance our ability to effectively treat these and other genomic subtypes of NSCLC.;This article reviews the next-generation kinase inhibitors targeting EGFR and ALK-positive NSCLC. In addition, targeted kinase inhibitors in clinical development for other specific molecular subtypes of NSCLC are covered, including ROS1, BRAF, RET, HER2, KRAS (upstream of the MEK kinase), MET, PIK3CA, FGFR1, DDR2, VEGFR and AAK.;In EGFR-mutant NSCLC, there are several kinase inhibitors with promising activity, most notably dacomitinib and CO-1686 in tumors with acquired resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy. Next-generation ALK inhibitors appear to have greater potency than crizotinib and several ongoing trials may shed light on their role in both ALK- and ROS1-positive NSCLC. While there is optimism regarding the role of kinase inhibitors in other molecular subtypes, the available evidence is too immature to make recommendations and results from prospective trials are needed.",

We hypothesize that smooth muscle cell/myofibroblast-like cells will be spatially associated with bFGF-containing mast cells and that bFGF receptors will be expressed on the effector cells in IPF and LAM. We performed quantitative immunohistochemistry for bFGF, mast cell tryptase, smooth muscle actin for smooth muscle cell/myofibroblast-like cells, and fibroblast growth factor receptors (Flg, Bek) and measured collagen and elastic fiber in lung sections from IPF (n = 14), LAM (n = 9), and control lung (n = 10).

Flg was expressed on epithelial cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cell/myofibroblast-like cells, and macrophages in IPF. In LAM, Flg was expressed on epithelial cells adjacent to smooth muscle cell/myofibroblast-like cell aggregates.

Interestingly, small-molecule or small interfering RNA inhibition of ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) activity induced death of the FGFR1-transformed cells, but not of the parental MCF10A cell line. The dependence of FGFR1-transformed cells on RSK activity was further confirmed in cell lines derived from mouse and human lobular carcinomas that possess high FGFR1 activity.

Here, we analyzed the expression of miR-214 and FGFR-1 in 65 cases of HCC and paired non-neoplastic tissue specimens using real-time PCR and Western blot (WB), respectively. Our data indicated that miR-214 was downregulated and FGFR-1 was overexpressed in HCC compared to the paired non-neoplastic tissues. The low miR-214 expression was correlated with portal vein invasion (p=0.016) and early recurrence (p=0.045) in HCC patients. Moreover, the low miR-214 expression was correlated with high positive rate of FGFR-1 in HCC cases (p=0.020). Our data further demonstrated that miR-214 overexpression in SK-HEP1 and HepG2 cells downregulated FGFR-1 expression and inhibited liver cancer cell invasion. The Luciferase assay results further demonstrated the targeted regulation of FGFR-1 by miR-214. In conclusion, our data indicate that the downregulation of miR-214 in HCC and the upregulation of its target gene FGFR-1 is associated with HCC progression.

Because most patients with lung cancer present with metastatic disease, we investigated whether lymph node metastases in L-SCC share the FGFR1 amplification status of their corresponding primary tumor.;The study cohort consisted of 72 patients with L-SCC, 39 with regional lymph node metastases. Tissue microarrays were constructed from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue of the primary tumors and, where present, of the corresponding lymph node metastasis.

HS proteoglycans (HSPGs) determine mitogenic responses of breast carcinoma cells to FGF-2 in vitro. For this study, we examined the role of HSPGs as modulators of FGF-2 binding to FGFR-1 in situ and in vitro. During stepwise reconstitution of the FGF-2/HSPG/FGFR-1 complex in situ, we identified an elevated ability of breast carcinoma cell HSPGs to promote receptor complex formation compared to normal breast epithelium. HSPGs isolated from the MCF-7 breast-carcinoma cell line were then fractionated according to their ability to assemble the FGF-2 receptor complex. All MCF-7 HSPGs are decorated with HS chains similarly capable of promoting FGF-2 receptor complex formation. In this in vitro model, syndecan-1 and syndecan-4 are the cell surface HSPGs contributing most to the complex formation. Relative expression levels of these syndecans in human breast carcinoma tissues correlate well with receptor complex formation in situ, indicating that in breast carcinomas, core protein levels determine FGF-2 receptor complex formation. However, variances in syndecan expression levels do not explain the difference in FGF-2 receptor complex formation between normal and malignant epithelial cells, suggesting that alterations in HS structure occur during malignant transformation.",

The K-sam-related gene, N-sam (NCC-IT-cell-derived sam), was isolated by screening of the cDNA libraries of human immature teratoma cells, NCC-IT. Sequence analysis of the N-sam cDNAs showed that N-sam encodes a human FGF receptor, the FLG protein. N-sam was expressed in lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma cells, predominantly in the thymic T-cell phenotype. In a T-cell leukemia line, MOLT3, N-sam mRNA expression was markedly enhanced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment and was also up-regulated by basic FGF exposure. These results indicate that N-sam expression is regulated during T-cell ontogeny and modulated by its putative ligand exposure. The results also suggested that interaction between immature T-cell and marrow or thymic interstitial cells might be mediated by N-sam and basic FGF stored in the extracellular matrix of stromal cells.",

Although amplification of HER2, C-MYC, CCND1 and FGFR1 has been reported in breast cancers, their role in the progression of in situ to invasive breast carcinoma is unclear. To investigate this question we compared the amplification frequencies of these genes in pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), DCIS associated with invasive carcinoma, and invasive carcinoma.;We performed fluorescence in situ hybridization of the selected genes on tissue microarrays composed of 179 pure DCIS and 438 invasive carcinomas. Two hundred and sixteen of the latter had DCIS components, and in those cases we compared gene amplification in the intraductal and invasive components of each carcinoma.;The rate of amplification of FGFR1 was higher in invasive carcinomas than in the pure DCIS, but the opposite was true for HER2 amplification. These findings applied consistently to high-grade tumors, but not to low/intermediate-grade tumors. The amplification status of HER2, C-MYC, CCND1 and FGFR1 was generally similar in the matched invasive and DCIS components of the same tumors. However, FGFR1 amplification was more common in the invasive components than in the DCIS components. In survival analyses, FGFR1 amplification was found to be an independent prognostic factor for poor disease-free survival for all patients with invasive carcinoma and for the hormone receptor-positive subgroup.;Amplification of HER2, C-MYC and CCND1 seems to play a role in the early development of breast cancer, but not in its progression. However, the increased frequency of FGFR1 amplification in invasive carcinomas compared with pure DCIS and in the invasive components of individual tumors, and its association with decreased disease-free survival, suggests a role for FGFR1 amplification in the progression of breast cancer including in situ-to-invasive transition, as well as initiation.",

Major efforts have been launched to characterize the genomes of squamous-cell lung cancers. Among the new results emanating from these efforts are amplifications of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) gene, the discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) gene mutation as potential novel targets for the treatment of SQCLCs. Researchers find that there are many specific molecular targeted genes in the genome of squamous-cell lung cancer patients. These changes play a vital role in cell cycle regulation, oxidative stress, cell apoptosis, squamous epithelium differentiation, may be the candidate targeted moleculars in SQCLCs. Here, we provide a review on these discoveries and their implications for clinical trials in squamous-cell lung cancer assessing the value of novel therapeutics addressing these targets.;肺鳞癌（squamous-cell lung cancer, SQCLC）是一种常见的肺癌病理类型，全世界每年约40余万人死于肺鳞癌，发病与吸烟密切相关。然而，研究表明，在肺腺癌中有明显疗效的靶向药物却无法让肺鳞癌患者获益，如人表皮生长因子受体（epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFR）抑制剂、间变性淋巴瘤激酶（anaplastic lymphoma kinase, ALK）抑制剂等。通过大量基因组学研究表明，纤维母细胞生长因子受体1（fibroblast growth factor receptor 1, FGFR1）基因扩增和盘状结构域受体2（the discoidin domain receptor 2, DDR2）基因突变等都可能成为新的用于治疗肺鳞癌的潜在药物分子靶点。此外，肺鳞癌患者基因组中也存在特异性的基因变异位点，这些改变在肺鳞癌细胞周期调控、氧化应激反应、细胞凋亡和鳞状上皮分化过程中发挥了重要作用，也可能为寻找候选分子靶点提供依据。本综述通过回顾近年来肺鳞癌分子靶向治疗的相关研究，分析靶向治疗在肺鳞癌中的研究进展，使肺鳞癌的个体化靶向治疗成为可能。",

Members of the Src family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases are substrates for certain growth factor receptors. We have examined interactions between FGF receptor-1 (FGFR-1) and Src, Fyn and Yes. In lung capillary endothelial cells and murine fibroblasts, bFGF stimulation led to increased autophosphorylation of Src family members. In contrast, in porcine aortic endothelial cells (FGFR-1/PAE) and lung fibroblasts from chinese hamster (CCL 39), activation of FGFR caused reduced autophosphorylation of Src and Fyn. In neither case could complex-formation between Src members and FGFR be seen. Analysis of a panel of mutated FGFR-1 expressed in PAE cells showed that FGFR-1/Y766F mediated an increased autophosphorylation of Src members and upregulation of their kinase activities. Y766 in FGFR-1 has been shown to serve as a binding site for phospholipase C-gamma, which regulates Ca2+ fluxes and protein kinase C (PKC) activity. The negative effect on Src kinase activity upon FGFR stimulation was mimicked by activation of PKC in FGFR-1/PAE or CCL 39 cells using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and Src was phosphorylated in vitro by purified recombinant PKC alpha. Moreover, inhibition of PKC attenuated the bFGF induced decrease in autophosphorylation of Src family members.

FGF-2 was localized in the cytoplasm of airway epithelium and in the nuclei of airway smooth muscle, VSM, and endothelial cells.

In addition, FGFR-1 levels were elevated in the intima (1.5-fold, P = 0.05). VSM cells of large (> 200 micro m) pulmonary vessels showed increased staining for FGF-1 (1.6-fold, P < 0.03) and FGFR-1 (1.4-fold, P < 0.04) in COPD. Pulmonary vascular remodeling, assessed as the ratio of alpha-smooth muscle actin staining and vascular wall area with the lumen diameter, was increased in large vessels of patients with COPD (P = 0.007) and was inversely correlated with FEV(1) values (P < 0.007).

It can in vitro activate the coagulation factor FVII, kininogen and plasminogen activators. The present study was initiated to gain a more complete picture of the cell-associated activities of this fibrinolysis-related protease. Treatment of lung fibroblasts with HABP lead to a rapid activation of signalling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway with c-Raf, MEK and ERK1/2. Additionally the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and of several translation-related proteins was found. Proliferation assays confirmed the assumption of a strong growth-stimulating effect of HABP on human lung and skin fibroblasts. Intracellular signalling and growth stimulation were strongly dependent on the proteolytic activity of HABP. Stimulation of signalling and proliferation by HABP involved the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR-1). HABP-stimulated proliferation of lung fibroblasts MRC-5 was accompanied by a significant intracellular increase in basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), the major ligand of FGFR-1; bFGF could however not be identified in the supernatant of HABP-treated cells. Though, the conditioned medium from HABP-treated cells showed a strong growth-promoting activity on quiescent fibroblasts, indicating the release of a yet unknown growth factor amplifying the initial growth stimulus. In a two-dimensional wound model HABP stimulated the invasion of fibroblasts into a scratch area, adding a strong pro-migratory activity to this plasma protease. In summary, HABP exhibits a significant growth factor-like activity on quiescent human lung and dermal fibroblasts. Our findings suggest that this fibrinolysis-related plasma protease may participate in physiologic or pathologic processes where cell proliferation and migration are pivotal, like tissue repair, vascular remodelling, wound healing or tumor development.",

Many urothelial carcinomas contain activating point mutations or increased expression of FGFR3. However, little is known about the role of other FGFRs. We examined FGFR expression in telomerase-immortalized normal human urothelial cells, urothelial carcinoma cell lines, and tumor samples and showed that FGFR1 expression is increased in a high proportion of cell lines and tumors independent of stage and grade. To determine the role of FGFR1 in low-stage bladder cancer, we overexpressed FGFR1 in telomerase-immortalized normal human urothelial cells and examined changes in proliferation and cell survival in response to FGF2. FGFR1 stimulation increased proliferation and reduced apoptosis. To elucidate the mechanistic basis for these alterations, we examined the signaling cascades activated by FGFR1. FRS2alpha and PLCgamma were activated in response to FGF2, leading to activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. The level of mitogen-activated protein kinase activation correlated with the level of cyclin D1, MCL1, and phospho-BAD, which also correlated with FGFR-induced proliferation and survival. Knockdown of FGFR1 in urothelial carcinoma cell lines revealed differential FGFR1 dependence. JMSU1 cells were dependent on FGFR1 expression for survival but three other cell lines were not. Two cell lines (JMSU1 and UMUC3) were dependent on FGFR1 for growth in soft agar. Only one of the cell lines tested (UMUC3) was frankly tumorigenic; here, FGFR1 knockdown inhibited tumor growth. Our results indicate that FGFR1 has significant effects on urothelial cell phenotype and may represent a useful therapeutic target in some cases of urothelial carcinoma.",

Although sorafenib has been shown to improve survival of patients with advanced HCC, this improvement is modest and patients eventually have refractory disease. This study aims at investigating the antitumor, antiangiogenesis and antimetastatic activities of dovitinib in preclinical models of HCC.;21-0208 and SK-HEP1 cells as well as patient-derived HCC models were employed to study the antitumor effect of dovitinib. Changes of biomarkers relevant to FGFR/VEGFR/PDGFR pathways were determined by Western blotting. Microvessel density, apoptosis and cell proliferation were analyzed by immunohistochemistry.;Treatment of SK-HEP1 cells with dovitinib resulted in G2/M cell cycle arrest, inhibition of colony formation in soft agar and blockade of bFGF-induced cell migration. Dovitinib inhibited basal expression and FGF-induced phosphorylation of FGFR-1, FRS2-α and ERK1/2. In vivo, dovitinib potently inhibited tumor growth of six HCC lines. Inhibition of angiogenesis correlated with inactivation of FGFR/PDGFR-β/VEGFR-2 signaling pathways. Dovitinib also caused dephosphorylation of retinoblastoma, upregulation of p-histone H2A-X and p27, and downregulation of p-cdk-2 and cyclin B1, which resulted in a reduction in cellular proliferation and the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. In an orthotopic model, dovitinib potently inhibited primary tumor growth and lung metastasis and significantly prolonged mouse survival.;Dovitinib demonstrated significant antitumor and antimetastatic activities in HCC xenograft models.

In this review we present currently known resistance mechanisms for afatinib and crizotinib two recently approved drugs. Resistance mechanisms identified for afatinib include c-MET amplification and the V843I EGFR mutation. Expression of FGFR1, increased IL6R/JAK/STAT signaling, enhanced interference with aerobic glycolysis and autophagy are associated with resistance to afatinib. Most common resistance mechanisms for ALK break positive cases are gatekeeper mutations in the ALK gene. Also activation of the EGFR pathway, KRAS mutations, the autophagy pathway and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), have been associated with resistance. Many of the proposed resistance mechanisms need to be functionally studied to proof a causative relationship with resistance. ",

Only a few parietal cells of the body mucosa were stained with HH2. Two of 12 cases with dysplasia showed CDw75 antigen expression in dysplastic glands. Forty-one cases (47.1%) were immunoreactive for CDw75 antigen in the primary tumors or metastases. A very close relationship was found between the expression of the antigen in primary tumors and their respective metastases. The expression of the antigen was correlated with an infiltrative growth pattern, lymphatic invasiveness, and aneuploidy. All but two immunoreactive cases had lymph node metastases or lymphatic permeation. No relationship was found between CDw75 antigen expression and the morphologic types of gastric carcinoma, amount of lymphoid infiltrate, vascular invasion, and penetration of the gastric wall.;The authors conclude that CDw75 antigen expression can be used as a marker of malignant transformation of gastric epithelium and is a good indicator of the biologic aggressiveness of gastric carcinoma.",

Increased rat lung bFGF mRNA, relative to air-exposed control animals, was observed at 4 days of exposure, with no increase at days 6 and 14 of exposure. Parallel changes were observed with bFGF receptor (flg) mRNA. Nuclear runoff assays confirmed increased transcription of both bFGF and flg genes in response to 85% O2, whereas increased translation at 6 days of exposure was confirmed by protein immunoanalysis.

Immunohistochemistry of human skin localized HOP to the granular layer in the epidermis. Overexpression of HOP using a lentiviral vector up-regulated FLG and LOR expression during keratinocyte differentiation. Conversely, decreasing HOP expression using small interfering RNA markedly reduced the calcium-induced expression of late markers of differentiation in vitro, with the most prominent effect on profilaggrin (FLG) mRNA. Moreover, mRNA levels of profilaggrin and loricrin were downregulated in the epidermis of HOP knockout mice.

The aim of this study was to characterize CLCs at the molecular genetic level and identify putative therapeutic targets.;We subjected 13 cases of CLC to a comprehensive molecular analysis including immunohistochemistry for E-cadherin, estrogen and progesterone receptors, HER2/neu and p53; high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization (HR-CGH); microarray-based CGH (aCGH); and fluorescent and chromogenic in situ hybridization for CCND1 and FGFR1.;All cases lacked the expression of E-cadherin, p53, and HER2, and all but one case was positive for estrogen receptors.

Examination of aCGH and the gene expression profile data of the cell lines, MDA-MB-134 and ZR-75-1, which harbor distinct gains of 8p12-p11.2, identified FGFR1 as a putative amplicon driver of 8p12-p11.2 amplification in MDA-MB-134.

Here, we find CRIPTO expression as especially high in a subgroup of primary prostate carcinomas with poorer outcome, wherein resides cancer cell clones with mesenchymal traits. Experimental studies in PCa models showed that one notable function of CRIPTO expression in prostate carcinoma cells may be to augment PI3K/AKT and FGFR1 signaling, which promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and sustains a mesenchymal state. In the observed signaling events, FGFR1 appears to function parallel to AKT, and the two pathways act cooperatively to enhance migratory, invasive and transformation properties specifically in the CRIPTO overexpressing cells.

Mutations and copy-number aberrations were determined and results validated with a secondary method.;The overall mutational burden in HPV-negative and HPV-positive HNSCC was similar with an average of 15.2 versus 14.4 somatic exonic mutations in the targeted cancer-associated genes. HPV-negative tumors showed a mutational spectrum concordant with published lung squamous cell carcinoma analyses with enrichment for mutations in TP53, CDKN2A, MLL2, CUL3, NSD1, PIK3CA, and NOTCH genes. HPV-positive tumors showed unique mutations in DDX3X, FGFR2/3 and aberrations in PIK3CA, KRAS, MLL2/3, and NOTCH1 were enriched in HPV-positive tumors. Currently targetable genomic alterations were identified in FGFR1, DDR2, EGFR, FGFR2/3, EPHA2, and PIK3CA. EGFR, CCND1, and FGFR1 amplifications occurred in HPV-negative tumors, whereas 17.6% of HPV-positive tumors harbored mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor genes (FGFR2/3), including six recurrent FGFR3 S249C mutations.

FGF-1 is not secreted by the transfected cells unless the cDNA contains a signal sequence; conversely, NBT-II cells transfected with FGF-2 coding sequence produce and secrete the factor in a biologically active form. Bovine brain capillary endothelial cells are stimulated to proliferate upon addition of medium conditioned by the FGF-2-producing cells and this activity can be abrogated by the addition of anti-FGF-2 blocking antibodies. In addition, the FGF-2-containing medium, which cannot stimulate NBT-II cells due to absence of appropriate receptors, is able to induce scattering of NBT-II cells expressing the FGFR1. It has been reported previously that FGF-1-producing cells are highly tumorigenic in nude mice and induce carcinoma with a period of latency reduced from 6 to 5 weeks when compared to parental NBT-II cells. In contrast, NBT-II cells producing FGF-2 are no more tumorigenic than parental cells, indicating that FGF-1 and FGF-2 have different oncogenic properties in carcinoma. FGF-1 and FGF-2 are potent antiogenic factors that trigger the host endothelial cells. VEGF, another potent angiogen was found to be expressed in small amounts by NBT-II cells and to be expressed in reduced amount in the FGF-producing cells. In the NBT-II system in vivo FGF-1 and FGF-2 are highly and comparatively angiogenic in the resultant carcinoma and this occurs in the absence of production of significant amounts of VEGF by the carcinoma cells. Taken together, our results indicate that activated angiogenesis is not sufficient for rapid tumor expansion. FGF-1 behaves as a tumorigenic factor in the NBT-II bladder carcinoma cell model, whereas expression and secretion of large amounts of FGF-2 are not sufficient for increasing tumor growth.",

Herein, a consensus heptapeptide (LSPPRYP) was identified for the first time from a phage display heptapeptide library after three sequential rounds of biopanning against FGFR-expressing cells with competitive displacement of phage by bFGF, followed by subtraction of non-specific binding by FGFR-deficient cells. Phage bearing LSPPRYP showed high levels of binding to Balb/c 3T3 cells expressing high-affinity bFGF-binding FGFR (bFGFR), but not to the cells that do not express bFGFR (Cos-7), or express a very low affinity bFGFR (HaCat). The selected-phage-derived peptide synthesized by solid phase method using a rapid and practical Fmoc strategy was found to specifically compete with bFGF for binding to its receptors, inhibit bFGF-stimulated cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest, and block bFGF-induced activation of Erk1 and Erk2 kinase in B16-F10 melanoma cells. Importantly, treatment of melanoma-bearing mice with the synthetic peptide significantly suppressed tumor growth. The results demonstrate a strong anticancer activity of the isolated bFGFR-binding peptide (and its future derivatives), which may have great potential for cancer therapy. ",

HepG2 cells were cultured under OGD condition. CCK-8 assay was used to assess the cell survival, and flow cytometry was performed to detect the apoptosis. Protein expression levels were detected with Western blot analysis. Transfection was performed with liposome, and cells were screened with G418. The cell survival rates were significantly decreased in the OGD groups. When treated with autophagy inhibitor 3-MA, the survival rates were further declined in these cells. Moreover, flow cytometry indicated that apoptosis occurred in the HepG2 cells under OGD condition, and the apoptosis rates were significantly increased by the 3-MA treatment. Western blot analysis showed that, the expression levels of DCN were significantly elevated in OGD-preconditioned HepG2 cells. Meanwhile, the expression level of Beclin1 and the LC3BI/LC3BII ratio were significantly increased, while the expression level of P62 was significantly decreased, in HepG2 cells under OGD condition. Over-expression of DCN significantly increased the expression level of Beclin1 and the LC3BI/LC3BII ratio, while no significant changes were observed in the P62 expression level, in HepG2 cells. Under the OGD condition, the apoptosis rate was also significantly decreased in DCN-transfected HepG2 cells. DCN protects HepG2 cells against OGD-induced injury, via regulating autophagy. These results might contribute to a better understanding of the roles of DCN and autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma, and the potential treatment for the disease. ",

Twenty patients received continuous treatment with EGFR-TKIs even after disease progression, and 11 of these patients had T790M mutation in rebiopsy samples. In contrast, only 10 of 41 patients who finished EGFR-TKI treatment at disease progression had T790M mutation.

We have demonstrated that this androgen-dependent growth is mediated through an induction of heparin-binding growth factor (termed as androgen-induced growth factor: AIGF). We studied the molecular mechanism of androgen-dependent growth. NIH3T3 cells transfected to express AIGF showed focus-forming activity, anchorage-independent growth and tumor formation in nude mice indicating AIGF is an oncogene. The findings that AIGF inhibited binding of [125I]basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and only FGF receptor (FGFR)-1 mRNA expressed in SC-3 cells suggested that AIGF acts through FGFR-1. Therefore, we cloned FGFR-1 from cDNA library of SC-3 cells, which was found to have three mutations. When this variant FGFR-1 was expressed in FGFR-negative myoblast L6 cells, AIGF-dependent inhibition of the differentiation to myocytes was observed suggesting that variant FGFR-1 is receptor of AIGF. Since expressions of c-myc mRNA as well as AIGF mRNA were induced by testosterone treatment, we studied the role of c-myc in androgen-dependent growth in SC-3 cells using phosphorothioate derived antisense oligonucleotides (antisense) of c-myc or AIGF. Not only AIGF antisense but also c-myc antisense inhibited androgen-dependent growth. c-myc antisense did not affect androgen-induced AIGF mRNA expression. c-myc antisense inhibited AIGF-, but not bFGF-induced DNA synthesis. These results suggest that c-myc has a critical role of AIGF-, but not bFGF-induced growth.",

Moreover, FGFR1 phosphorylation levels were downregulated in A549 cells by influenza A virus infection, while the repression of FGFR1 kinase using PD173074, a potent and selective FGFR1 inhibitor, could enhance virus replication.

In vascular epithelium, it has been shown to regulate production and activity of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2, a potent type II cell mitogen in the lung. Such a relationship could have important consequences in prefibrotic change in the lung alveolus, where reepithelialization of alveolar surfaces is crucial. The goal of this study was to determine if FGF-2 production by alveolar type II cells is modulated by TGF-beta(1) or FGF-1, another type II cell mitogen. Isolated rat type II cells were exposed to 0 to 40 ng/mL of TGF-beta(1) or 0 to 500 ng/mL of FGF-1 in serum-free medium for 1 to 3 days. Using a specific immunoassay, significant increases in FGF-2 protein in type II cell lysates were achieved after 1 day of exposure to 100 ng/mL of FGF-1 and after 3 days of treatment with 8 ng/mL of TGF-beta(1). Similarly, transcripts for FGF-2 were dramatically increased with TGF-beta(1) or FGF-1, as were those for FGF receptor (FGFR)-1. These interactions were dramatically effected by the addition of heparin, a model sulfated extracellular matrix (ECM). Heparin as low as 0.01 mg/mL significantly downregulated expression of TGF-beta(1) and FGF-1-stimulated FGF-2 and FGFR-1. These results demonstrate important regulatory links between FGF-2, sulfated ECMs, and both TGF-beta(1) and FGF-1, which could contribute to the modulation of normal cell turnover, development, and repair processes attendant to fibrosis in the lung.",

A cDNA encoding FGFR-1 IIIc was stably transfected into the well-differentiated TAKA-1 pancreatic ductal cell line that is not responsive to FGF5 and does not express FGFR-1.;FGFR-1 IIIc was expressed in 5 of 7 pancreatic cancer cell lines and in the majority of the cancer cells in 4 of 7 PDAC samples. In vitro, TAKA-1 cells stably transfected with FGFR-1 IIIc exhibited increased basal growth; enhanced basal tyrosine phosphorylation of FGFR substrate-2 (FRS2), Shc, and phospholipase Cgamma; and increased activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). PD98059, an inhibitor of MAPK, suppressed the basal growth of parental and transfected clones, but the effect was more marked in clones expressing FGFR-1 IIIc. In vivo, tumor formation in nude mice was dramatically enhanced with FGFR-1 IIIc transfected (20 of 20) in comparison with sham transfected (0 of 10) cells.;Our data indicate that FGFR-1 IIIc is expressed in human pancreatic cancer cells, promotes mitogenic signaling via the FRS2-MAPK pathway, and has the potential to enhance pancreatic ductal cell transformation.",

Rg1 can activate the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). However, the mechanism that transmits these pro-angiogenic effects is still unclear.;By using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), we show for the first time that in the presence of Rg1, GR and fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR-1) cooperate to activate a non-genomic signalling cascade that results in angiogenic activity. The activation of FGFR-1 by Rg1 was blocked by the GR antagonist RU486. Depletion of FGFR-1 expression or inhibition of its activity using small interfering RNA and small molecule inhibitor, respectively, significantly inhibited Rg1-induced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt phosphorylation and subsequent endothelial nitric oxide synthase activation and angiogenic tube formation, confirming that the effect was FGFR-1 specific. On exploring how GR might regulate the activation of FGFR-1, we found that GR-mediated FGFR-1 activation was ligand-independent. In addition, we have shown that FGFR-1 regulation by GR was associated with GR/FGFR-1 complex formation.;This study provides important new insights into the mechanism regarding the beneficial effects of Rg1 on angiogenesis. We propose that Rg1 could be a novel prototype of nutraceutical that can induce therapeutic angiogenesis.",

Sequence analysis demonstrated an activating KRAS mutation (exon 2) in all FGFR1-amplified cases. The FGFR1-amplified pancreatic carcinoma cell line PT45P1 showed high levels of FGFR1 mRNA and protein expression. Proliferation of this cell line can be inhibited using the FGFR1 inhibitor BGJ398.;FGFR1 represents a potential new therapeutic target in a subset of patients harbouring FGFR1-amplified tumours.

Among the several factors associated with breast cancer development, angiogenesis plays an essential role and has currently emerged as a potential diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic target. Protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) have important activities in tumor angiogenesis and progression. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic significance of these two receptors, hypothesising significant correlations between receptor expression in tumor angiogenesis and clinicopathological parameters customarily used in breast cancer prognosis and prediction. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples of ductal invasive breast carcinomas were used to analyze the expression of PAR1 and FGFR1, in the tumor cells as well as in the tumor stroma, and further determine intratumoral microvessel density (iMVD) to quantify intratumoral angiogenesis. Correlations between PAR1 and FGFR1 expression in tumor cells and stroma, iMVD and several clinicopathological parameters and molecular markers used in breast cancer diagnosis have been addressed. The correlation between PAR1 and FGFR1 suggests an association of the two receptors with a more aggressive breast cancer phenotype and, consequently, a potential role during tumor progression. The results reported in the present study also emphasize the importance of microenvironmental factors in tumor progression, while precluding the positive association between iMVD and breast cancer aggressiveness.",

In the present study we investigated the activity of this gene in human NT2/D1 embryonal carcinoma cells subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and reoxygenation. OGD/reoxygenation cause global metabolic changes due to energy withdrawal and the subsequent generation of reactive oxygen species which initiates either a stress-adaptation-survival response or cell death, depending on the severity of the insult. A bi-phasic change in UCHL1 expression was observed by Q-PCR, Western blotting and flow cytometry. Down regulation of UCHL1 was detected immediately after OGD treatment and its expression was subsequently restored and increased 6 h after OGD treatment as well as during reoxygenation. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis detected a lower level of UCHL1 only in apoptotic cells that had severe loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Accordingly, down-regulation of endogenous UCHL1 by antisense cDNA in mouse N2a neuroblastoma cells increased the cell's sensitivity to OGD treatment. This down-regulation of endogenous UCHL1 led to the accumulation of p27, suggesting that UCHL1 is an essential gene to maintain cell homeostasis under normal growth and oxidative stress conditions.",

The complex molecular pathways and gene expression changes associated with these events in canine mammary tumors are still largely undetermined. In this study, the transcriptome of 13 lymph node positive canine mammary carcinomas and corresponding non-neoplastic mammary glands were compared to identify the molecular pathways associated with metastatic progression. Differential gene expression was analyzed using gene set enrichment and pathway analysis and compared with gene expression data from human breast cancer. Metastatic canine carcinomas had 1312 significantly differentially expressed genes compared to normal mammary glands. This expression profile included a significant up-regulation of cell division and matrix invasion genes (MMP, SERPINE1, TIMP3). In contrast, genes associated with epithelial differentiation (EGF, EGFR, MAP2K6, STAT 5), cell adhesion (CLDN5, CTNNAL1, MUC1, PECAM1) and angiogenesis (ANGPT 2, ANGPTL1-4, FIGF, TIE1) were mostly down-regulated. Tumors had a significant decrease in membrane receptors and pathway gene expression (EGFR, FGFR1, GHR, PDGFR, TGFBR, TIE1) indicating a tendency towards independence from these proliferative stimuli. A number of the identified deregulated pathways overlapped with gene expression profiles of human breast cancer.

In previous experiments, cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans extracted from human lung fibroblasts could not be shown to promote high affinity binding of bFGF when added to heparan sulfate-deficient cells that express FGF receptor-1 (FGFR1) (Aviezer, D., D. Hecht, M. Safran, M. Eisinger, G. David, and A. Yayon. 1994. Cell 79:1005-1013). In alternative tests to establish whether cell-surface proteoglycans can support the formation of the required complexes, K562 cells were first transfected with the IIIc splice variant of FGFR1 and then transfected with constructs coding for either syndecan-1, syndecan-2, syndecan-4 or glypican, or with an antisense syndecan-4 construct. Cells cotransfected with receptor and proteoglycan showed a two- to three- fold increase in neutral salt-resistant specific 125I-bFGF binding in comparison to cells transfected with only receptor or cells cotransfected with receptor and anti-syndecan-4. Exogenous heparin enhanced the specific binding and affinity cross-linking of 125I-bFGF to FGFR1 in receptor transfectants that were not cotransfected with proteoglycan, but had no effect on this binding and decreased the yield of bFGFR cross-links in cells that were cotransfected with proteoglycan. Receptor-transfectant cells showed a decrease in glycophorin A expression when exposed to bFGF. This suppression was dose-dependent and obtained at significantly lower concentrations of bFGF in proteoglycan-cotransfected cells. Finally, complementary cell-free binding assays indicated that the affinity of 125I-bFGF for an immobilized FGFR1 ectodomain was increased threefold when the syndecan-4 ectodomain was coimmobilized with receptor. Equimolar amounts of soluble syndecan-4 ectodomain, in contrast, had no effect on this binding. We conclude that, at least in K562 cells, syndecans and glypican can support bFGF-FGFR1 interactions and signaling, and that cell-surface association may augment their effectiveness.",

We have previously shown that metabolic stress due to glucose depletion (GD) induces necrosis and HMGB1 release through mitochondrial ROS production in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells. In this study, we examined the effects of hypoxia on GD-induced necrosis and show that hypoxia prevented GD-induced mitochondrial ROS production, HMGB1 release, and necrosis and switched the cell death mode to apoptosis that is dependent on caspase-3 and -9. We further found that inhibition of ERK1/2 by U0126 abolished the effects of hypoxia to switch the cell death mode and to suppress mitochondrial ROS production, indicating an important role(s) of the ERK pathway in cell death mode determination. We also found that during OGD-induced apoptosis the prosurvival protein kinase Akt is activated and inhibition of Akt by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin prevent OGD-induced apoptosis, caspase-3 and -9 activation, and nuclear translocation of AIF and EndoG. Similar inhibitory effects of PI3K inhibitors were observed in A549 cells that underwent apoptosis when treated with GD in the presence of NAC (a general antioxidant) or catalase (a H(2)O(2) scavenger), or in the presence of active PKC by treatment with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, indicating a crucial role(s) of the PI3K-Akt pathway in OGD-indcued apoptosis.

Dependence on secreted FGF2 for cell growth was tested with FP-1039, an FGFR1-Fc fusion protein. FGFR and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) dependence was defined by sensitivity to multiple inhibitors selective for FGFRs or EGFR.;FGF2 was expressed in eight of the nine HNSCC cell lines examined. Also, FGFR2 and FGFR3 were frequently expressed, whereas only two lines expressed FGFR1. FP-1039 inhibited growth of HNSCC cell lines expressing FGF2, identifying FGF2 as an autocrine growth factor. FGFR inhibitors selectively reduced in vitro growth and extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling in three HNSCC cell lines, whereas three distinct lines exhibited responsiveness to both EGFR and FGFR inhibitors. Combinations of these drugs yielded additive growth inhibition. Finally, three cell lines were highly sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) with no contribution from FGFR pathways.;FGFR signaling was dominant or codominant with EGFR in six HNSCC lines, whereas three lines exhibited little or no role for FGFRs and were highly EGFR dependent.

The level of expression of FGF8 mRNA was measured in 68 breast cancers and 24 non-malignant breast tissues. Elevated levels of FGF8 mRNA were found in malignant compared to non-malignant breast tissues with significantly more malignant tissues expressing FGF8 (P=0.019) at significantly higher levels (P=0.031). In situ hybridization of breast cancer tissues and analysis of purified populations of normal epithelial cells and breast cancer cell lines showed that malignant epithelial cells expressed FGF8 mRNA at high levels compared to non-malignant epithelial and myoepithelial cells and fibroblasts. Although two of the receptors which FGF8 binds to (FGFR2-IIIc, FGFR3-IIIc) are not expressed in breast cancer cells, an autocrine activation loop is possible since expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 4 and FGFR1 are retained in malignant epithelial cells. This is the first member of the FGF family to have increased expression in breast cancer and a potential autocrine role in its progression.",

Its solution behaviour in standard phosphate buffer, at pH 7.4, was investigated spectrophotometrically and found to reproduce quite closely that of cisplatin; indeed, progressive sequential release of the two halide ligands typically occurs as in the case of cisplatin, with a roughly similar kinetics. Afterward, patterns of reactivity toward model proteins and standard ctDNA were explored and the nature of the resulting interactions elucidated. The antiproliferative properties were then evaluated in four representative cancer cell lines, namely A549 (human lung cancer), HCT116 (human colon cancer), IGROV-1 (human ovarian cancer) and FLG 29.1 (human acute myeloid leukaemia). Cytotoxic properties in line with those of cisplatin were highlighted. From these studies an overall chemical and biological profile emerges for cisPtBr2 closely matching that of cisplatin; the few slight, but meaningful differences that were underscored might be advantageously exploited for clinical application.

Previously, we demonstrated that FGFR1 expression is increased in urothelial carcinoma cell lines and tumors, which promotes proliferation and survival via activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Here we examined splice variants of FGFR1 in both urothelial carcinoma cell lines and tumors. Two known FGFR1 IIIc splice variants (FGFR1α and FGFR1β) were expressed. FGFR1β lacks exon 3 of FGFR1α, removing the first Ig loop of the extracellular domain. Both isoforms were expressed at similar levels in normal urothelial cells, but FGFR1β was expressed at higher levels in most tumor cell lines. In tumor tissues, expression levels were higher than in controls, and the FGFR1β:FGFR1α ratio was significantly increased in association with tumor stage and grade. When FGFR1α and FGFR1β were expressed in urothelial cells, no differences in signaling were observed. FGFR1-induced proliferation paralleled MAPK pathway activation. The relative activation of FGFR1β and FGFR1α by all known mammalian FGFs was examined. Both isoforms were activated by the same FGFs, but the level of activation differed. FGFR1β showed higher affinity for low concentrations of FGF1, leading to enhanced signaling and increased proliferation. An FGFR1α-to-FGFR1β isoform switch and increased FGF1-induced activation of FGFR1β may result in a proliferative advantage that plays a key role during bladder tumor progression.",

The mAb used (HH2, EBU.65, EBU.141 and OKB4) detect different epitopes of CDw75. Normal peripheral blood B cells expressed high levels of CDw75 detectable with HH2, EBU.65 and EBU.141 but did not react with OKB4. Cells from patients with B-cell CLL closely resembled normal B cells. All CDw75 epitopes, including OKB4, were strongly expressed on some Namalwa variant Burkitt lymphoma cell lines. The OKB4 epitope was also present on red cells from all normal donors. The other CDw75 mAb were unreactive with red cells from some normal donors. The CDw75 epitope detected with EBU.65 was present on most CD4+ T cells and on a minority of CD8+ cells. HH2 and EBU.141 stained only small numbers of T lymphocytes. OKB4 did not react with T cells. EBU.65+, CD4+ T cells had low levels of expression of CD45R0, CD29, CD54 and CD58, and had high levels of CD45RA antigen. Phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) activation of cells led to the loss of EBU.65 binding. These results suggest that the CDw75 epitope recognized by the EBU.65 mAb is a marker of native T lymphocytes. On B CLL cells the epitopes detected with HH2, EBU.65 and EBU.141 were destroyed by treatment with neuraminidase. Treatment of B-CLL cells and red cells with neuraminidase increased the binding of OKB4, suggesting that this epitope is masked by sialic acid. The results suggest that CDw75 is a sialylated cell-surface antigen expressed in a number of tissue-specific isoforms.",

Because these findings inferred the presence of a functional receptor for fibroblast growth factor (FGFR), we have immunochemically assessed the appearance of FGFR-1 (cek-1; flg) during development. Using a peptide-generated antibody, Western blots of total embryonic proteins revealed that FGFR-1 was barely detectable at pre-heart stages, followed by sequential increases in relative abundance that peaked at stage 24, followed by a decline at days 7-14. Western blots of proteins from isolated embryonic hearts demonstrated a similar developmental pattern, except that FGFR-1 expression was not decreased at later stages. The presence of FGFR-1 mRNA was verified by reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR) amplification. Immunohistochemical examination revealed punctate deposits of FGFR-1 in the precardiac endoderm at stage 6, followed by detection in the endoderm, foregut, and pre-cardiac splanchnic mesoderm at stage 8 and in the newly formed myocardium at the heart tube stage (9/10). By stage 13, FGFR-1 staining was observed only in the myocardium, a pattern which persisted at least until stage 30 (day 7), after which only isolated hearts were examined. After stage 30, staining was diminished in the ventricle, but not in the atrium. Staining of cardiac endothelial cells was not observed at any stage. A functional role for FGFR-1 was indicated by experiments in which anti-FGFR-1, but not pre-absorbed antiserum, retarded proliferation and multilayering of cardiogenic cells in an in vitro model of cardiac morphogenesis.",

Accumulating evidence suggests that miRNAs are involved in cancer development and progression, acting as either tumor suppressors or oncogenes. Intriguingly, it has been shown that miR-133b was significantly downregulated in several types of cancers. However, its role and relevance in gastric cancer are still largely unknown. We showed that miR-133b was downregulated in human gastric cancer tissues and cell lines compared with nontumor counterparts by quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Overexpression of miR-133b could inhibit cell proliferation and colony formation of the gastric cancer cell lines MKN-45 and SGC-7901. Bioinformatics analysis indicated two putative miR-133b binding sites in the 3'-untranslated region of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) mRNA. In dual-luciferase reporter assay, miR-133b reduced the luciferase activity of Luc-FGFR1-wt, and mutation of miR-133b binding sites abolished the inhibitory effect of miR-133b. In this study, we found that miR-133b reduced the protein but not the mRNA levels of endogenous FGFR1. Furthermore, FGFR1 expression was upregulated in gastric cancer tissues and inversely correlated with miR-133b expression. Finally, knockdown of FGFR1 inhibited the growth of MKN-45 cells in a dose-dependent manner and overexpression of FGFR1 promoted the growth of GES-1 cells. These results indicate that miR-133b targets FGFR1 and inhibits gastric cancer cell growth, suggesting that it may serve as a tumor suppressive target in gastric cancer therapy.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) due to insufficient blood circulation can decrease cancer cell survival and proliferation in solid tumors. OGD increases the intracellular [AMP]/[ATP] ratio, thereby activating the AMPK. In this study, we have investigated the involvement of NQO1 in OGD-mediated AMPK activation and cancer cell death. We found that OGD activates AMPK in an NQO1-dependent manner, suppressing the mTOR/S6K/4E-BP1 pathway, which is known to control cell survival. Thus, the depletion of NQO1 prevents AMPK-induced cancer cell death in OGD. When we blocked OGD-induced Ca(2+)/CaMKII signaling, the NQO1-induced activation of AMPK was attenuated. In addition, when we blocked the RyR signaling, the accumulation of intracellular Ca(2+) and subsequent activation of CaMKII/AMPK signaling was decreased in NQO1-expressing cells under OGD. Finally, siRNA-mediated knockdown of CD38 abrogated the OGD-induced activation of Ca(2+)/CaMKII/AMPK signaling. Taken together, we conclude that NQO1 plays a key role in the AMPK-induced cancer cell death in OGD through the CD38/cADPR/RyR/Ca(2+)/CaMKII signaling pathway. ",

Subjects were examined for symptoms of atopic diseases as well as for lung function, airway responsiveness, and atopy.;In the whole population of twins, the risk for AD was significantly increased in individuals with FLG mutations in comparison with wild-type carriers (34.3% vs. 21.8%) after adjustment for possible confounders (odds ratio [OR] 1.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-3.41; P = 0.028). A significant association was also observed for persistent AD (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.02-4.36; P = 0.046). There were no significant differences in risk for asthma by FLG mutation status in individuals with and without AD, respectively (P-value for interaction, 0.595). In 11 dizygotic twin pairs discordant for FLG mutation status, risk for AD was higher in the twin carrying the FLG mutation (five of 11 [45.5%] twins had developed AD) than in the non-carrier co-twin (two of 11 [18.2%] twins had developed AD) (OR 2.50, 95% CI 0.45-13.85; P = 0.293).

We show quantitatively for the first time that the T lymphocyte adhesion force and adhesion work correlates with substrate point of zero charge, indicating greater adsorption on surfaces with smaller negative charge. Adhesion events also exhibited sawtooth-shaped force-distance profiles indicative of protein bonds. No significant correlations were found with oxide Hamaker constants, indicating negligible contributions from van der Waals forces, nor with surface roughness. These results suggest that, when cell-surface receptors are not activated, Jurkat cell adhesion is dominated by specific interactions related to the unfolding of modular glycoproteins or other proteins that are not unique to T-cell surfaces and by electrostatic forces between negatively charged glycoproteins and variably charged oxide surfaces.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether house dust mite allergen (HDMA) plus ozone altered this process. Rhesus monkeys were exposed to a regimen of HDMA and/or ozone or filtered air for 6 mo. To detect structural changes in the BMZ, we measured immunoreactivity of collagen I. To detect functional changes in the BMZ, we measured perlecan and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). We also measured components of the FGF-2 ternary signaling complex [fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR-1) and syndecan-4]. The width of the BMZ was irregular in the ozone groups, suggesting atypical development of the BMZ. Perlecan was also absent from the BMZ. In the absence of perlecan, FGF-2 was not bound to the BMZ. However, FGF-2 immunoreactivity was present in basal cells, the lateral intercellular space (LIS), and attenuated fibroblasts. FGFR-1 immunoreactivity was downregulated, and syndecan-4 immunoreactivity was upregulated in the basal cells. This suggests that FGF-2 in basal cells and LIS may be bound to the syndecan-4. We conclude that ozone and HDMA plus ozone effected incorporation of perlecan into the BMZ, resulting in atypical development of the BMZ. These changes are associated with specific alterations in the regulation of FGF-2, FGFR-1, and syndecan-4 in the airway epithelial-mesenchymal trophic unit, which may be associated with the developmental problems of lungs associated with exposure to ozone.",

To test this hypothesis, human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were induced to become neuron-like cells. Primary rat cortical neuronal cultures were also used. These cells were subjected to various lengths of short oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD, an in vitro simulation of ischemia) and then 1-h OGD. Some cells that were not exposed to a short episode of ischemia were incubated with culture medium from the cells that had 3- or 5-min OGD. Those cells were subjected to OGD for 1h at 1 or 24h after they were exposed to the medium. Cell injury was evaluated at 24h after the 1-h OGD by lactate dehydrogenase release assay. In another experiment, cells subjected to a 3-min OGD or exposed to the medium from cells that had a 3-min OGD were harvested at 30min after the OGD or the medium exposure for Western blotting of Akt, a prosurvival protein. Our study showed that a prior episode of ischemia lasting from 3 to 10min significantly reduced the 1-h OGD-induced cell injury. Medium from cells subjected to a 3-min OGD also induced acute and delayed phases of neuroprotection in OGD-naïve human neuron-like cells and primary rat cortical neuronal cultures. Cells subjected to a 3-min OGD or incubated with the medium from cells exposed to a 3-min OGD had increased phosphorylated/activated Akt. The increased phosphorylated Akt and neuroprotection induced by medium transferring were inhibited by 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX), an adenosine A1 receptor inhibitor. The 3-min OGD-induced neuroprotection was inhibited by LY294002, an Akt activation inhibitor.

Samples of benign nevi, normal skin and carcinoma cell lines were included as controls. Using RT-PCR analysis, expression of FGF1 and FGFR1 was observed in 69/77 and 68/77 cases, respectively. Immunohistochemical detection of the FGFR1 protein was positive in reactive stromal cells and at a much lower level in neoplastic cells. In situ hybridization experiments demonstrated FGFR1 mRNA mainly located in the stromal component. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA prepared from MM tumors did not show any structural alteration of the FGFR1 gene. There was no correlation between FGF1/FGFR1 expression and the usual clinicopathological parameters of MM. We conclude that FGF1 and FGFR1 are frequently co-expressed in MM, a situation that may contribute to aberrant autocrine and paracrine pathways.

FGF-2 exerts its effects by binding to cell surface receptors (FGFR-1) of the tyrosine kinase family. We have detected the presence of both long and short isoforms of FGFR-1 in embryonic and adult mouse heart. In this report, we have examined the ability of long and short FGFR-1 isoforms to signal a mitogenic response. Assessment of RNA from rat myoblast H9c2 cells by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and RNA blotting revealed that they were deficient in transcripts corresponding to long and short FGFR-1 species. Hybrid genes containing the cDNAs coding for long and short FGFR-1 isoforms directed by the myosin light chain-2 promoter and simian virus 40 enhancer sequences, were used to transiently transfect H9c2 cells. Total tyrosine phosphorylation was increased 2.0 and 2.6 fold in H9c2 cells transfected with the long and short FGFR-1 isoforms, respectively, compared to 'control' transfected H9c2 cells. This was accompanied by a 2.1 and 2.0 fold increase in DNA synthesis, as measured by tritiated thymidine incorporation, in H9c2 cells expressing the long and short FGFR-1 isoforms, respectively. To assess effects on proliferation, H9c2 cells were stably transfected with the myosin light chain-2/FGFR-1 cDNA genes. The rate of proliferation was increased 1.6 and 3.1 fold in H9c2 cells stably expressing the long and short FGFR-1 isoforms, respectively, compared to 'control' H9c2 cells. In contrast to non transfected H9c2 cells, treatment of H9c2 cells stably expressing long FGFR-1 with FGF-2 for 24 h resulted in a slight increase (1.3 fold, p < 0.02) in cell number. However, a greater response (1.5 fold, p < 0.0005) was observed with H9c2 cells stably expressing short FGFR-1 after treatment with FGF-2.

Both of them can be phosphorylated and therefore regulated by Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1). While phosphorylation of LDHA at tyrosine10 leads to tetramerization and activation, phosphorylation of PKM2 at tyrosine105 promotes dimerization and inactivation. Dimeric PKM2 is found in the nucleus and regulates gene transcription. Up-regulation and phosphorylation of LDHA and PKM2 contribute to faster proliferation under hypoxic conditions and promote the Warburg effect.;Using western blot and SYBR Green Real time PCR we investigated 77 thyroid tissues including 19 goiter tissues, 11 follicular adenomas, 16 follicular carcinomas, 15 papillary thyroid carcinomas, and 16 undifferentiated thyroid carcinomas for total expression of PKM2, LDHA and FGFR1. Additionally, phosphorylation status of PKM2 and LDHA was analysed. Inhibition of FGFR was performed on FTC133 cells with SU-5402 and Dovitinib.;All examined thyroid cancer subtypes overexpressed PKM2 as compared to goiter. LDHA was overexpressed in follicular and papillary thyroid cancer as compared to goiter. Elevated phosphorylation of LDHA and PKM2 was detectable in all analysed cancer subtypes. The highest relative phosphorylation levels of PKM2 and LDHA compared to overall expression were found in undifferentiated thyroid cancer. Inhibition of FGFR led to significantly decreased phosphorylation levels of PKM2 and LDHA.;Our data shows that overexpression and increased phosphorylation of PKM2 and LHDA is a common finding in thyroid malignancies. Phospho-PKM2 and Phospho-LDHA could be valuable tumour markers for thyroglobulin negative thyroid cancer.",

We have previously shown that human SMCs, when stimulated with thrombin, release basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), causing phosphorylation of FGF receptor-1 (FGFR-1). Treatment with bFGF-neutralizing antibodies (anti-bFGF) or heparin inhibits thrombin-induced DNA synthesis. We concluded that thrombin may stimulate entry into the cell cycle via bFGF release and FGFR-1 activation. In the present study, we demonstrate a requirement for not only FGFR-1 but also syndecan-4, a transmembrane heparan-sulfate proteoglycan. Inhibition of syndecan-4 expression using small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in reduced DNA synthesis by human SMCs after stimulation with thrombin (10 nmol/liter). Anti-bFGF antibody, which inhibits DNA synthesis in control cells, had no inhibitory effect when syndecan-4 expression was reduced by siRNA. Thrombin- or bFGF-induced SMC migration, determined in Boyden chamber assays, was reduced in cells treated with syndecan-4 or FGFR-1 siRNA or by anti-bFGF. Thrombin induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 in a biphasic pattern. Although thrombin-mediated ERK phosphorylation at 5 min was not affected by syndecan-4 or FGFR-1 siRNA, ERK phosphorylation at later time points was reduced. We conclude that thrombin-released bFGF binds to syndecan-4 and FGFR-1, which is required for thrombin-induced mitogenesis and migration.",

Detailed FISH analysis on OSCC tissue microarray sections revealed amplification prevalence for FGFR1 of 17.4% (16/92).

However, the mechanism of HIF-1-regulated cell survival is still not fully understood in ischemic conditions. Redox status is critical for decisions of cell survival, death and differentiation. We investigated the effects of inhibiting HIF-1 on cellular redox status in SH-SY5Y cells exposed to hypoxia or oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), coupled with cell death analyses. Our results demonstrated that inhibiting HIF-1alpha expression by HIF-1alpha specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection increased reactive oxygen species generation, and transformed the cells to more oxidizing environments (low GSH/GSSG ratio, low NADPH level) under either hypoxic or OGD exposure. Cell death increased dramatically in the siRNA transfected cells, compared to non-transfected cells after hypoxic/OGD exposures. In contrast, increasing HIF-1alpha expression by desferrioxamine, a metal chelator and hydroxylase inhibitor, induced a more reducing environment (high GSH/GSSG ratio, high NADPH level) and reduced cell death. Further studies showed that HIF-1 regulated not only glucose transporter-1 expression, but also the key enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. These enzymes are important in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis by generating NADPH, the primary reducing agent in cells. Moreover, catalase significantly decreased cell death in the siRNA-transfected cells induced by hypoxia and OGD.

In this study, we investigated the effects of FGF-2 on cell proliferation and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation before and after abrogation of FGFR-1-dependent signaling in 4 pancreatic cancer cell lines (ASPC-1, COLO-357, MIA-PaCa-2, and PANC-1). Signaling was blocked by infecting the cells with an adenoviral vector encoding for a truncated FGFR-1 (AdtrFGFR-1). FGF-2 enhanced the growth of all 4 cell lines and activated MAPK in 3 of these cell lines. Infection with the AdtrFGFR-1 virus resulted in abundant expression of the truncated FGFR-1 at the RNA and protein level, markedly attenuated FGF-2-induced proliferation in all 4 tested cell lines, and decreased FGF-2-dependent MAPK activation in the 3 cell lines in which FGF-2 activated this pathway. These findings suggest that FGFR-1-mediated mitogenesis in multiple pancreatic cancer cells can be efficiently blocked with an adenoviral vector encoding a truncated FGFR-1, raising the possibility that AdtrFGFR-1 may ultimately have a therapeutic role in PDAC.",

We further evaluated these compounds for FGFR1 inhibition ability as well as cytotoxicity against four cancer cell lines (H460, B16-F10, Hela229, and Hct116) in vitro. Some compounds displayed good-to-excellent potency against the four tested cancer cell lines compared with TKI258. Structure-activity relationship analyses indicated that small substituents at the side chain of the 3-vinyl-quinoxalin-2(1H)-one were more effective than large substituents. Lastly, we used molecular docking to obtain further insight into the interactions between the compounds and FGFR1. ",

In the present study, we have used the expressed sequence tag (EST) map of 8p11-21 to assemble a set of available cDNAs representing genes from this region. DNA arrays were prepared for expression analysis and search for genes potentially involved in breast cancer. Underexpresion in tumoral breast cells (versus normal breast) was observed for 15 transcripts. Among these, the Frizzled-related gene FRP1/FRZB, was turned off in 78% of breast carcinomas, suggesting that the lack of its product may be associated with malignant transformation. Overexpression in tumoral breast cells was observed for 13 genes. The FGFR1 gene, that encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor for members of the fibroblast growth factor family, was identified as a good candidate for one amplification unit. Taken together, our results demonstrate that such a strategy can rapidly identify genes with an altered pattern of expression and provide candidate genes for malignancies.",

In the present study, we investigated whether platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a tyrosine kinase receptor agonist, might transactivate another tyrosine kinase receptor to induce SMC proliferation. Because heparin inhibits PDGF-mediated proliferation in human SMCs, we investigated whether the heparin-binding growth factor basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and one of its receptors, FGFR-1, play a role in the response of human arterial SMCs to PDGF-BB. PDGF-BB induced the release of bFGF and sustained phosphorylation of FGFR-1 (30 minutes to 6 hours). A bFGF-neutralizing antibody inhibited PDGF-BB-mediated phosphorylation of FGFR-1, DNA synthesis, and cell proliferation. In the presence of bFGF antibody, PDGF-BB-induced early activation of ERK (0 to 60 minutes) was not affected, whereas late ERK activation (2 to 4 hours) was reduced. When FGFR-1 expression was suppressed using small interfering RNA (siRNA), ERK activation was reduced at late, but not early, time points after PDGF-BB stimulation. Addition of bFGF antibody to cells treated with siRNA to FGFR-1 had no further effect on ERK activation.

In cells exposed to 6 h of transient oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD), a model of ischemia, SUMOylation increases profoundly between 0 and 30 min following re-oxygenation. To elucidate the effect of transient OGD on SUMO conjugation of target proteins, we exposed neuroblastoma B35 cells expressing HA-SUMO3 to transient OGD and used stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) to quantify OGD-induced changes in levels of specific SUMOylated proteins. Lysates from control and OGD-treated cells were mixed equally, and HA-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by 1D-SDS-PAGE-LC-MS/MS. We identified 188 putative SUMO3-conjugated proteins, including numerous transcription factors and coregulators, and PIAS2 and PIAS4 SUMO ligases, of which 22 were increased or decreased more than ±2-fold. In addition to SUMO3, the levels of protein-conjugated SUMO1 and SUMO2, as well as ubiquitin, were all increased. Importantly, protein ubiquitination induced by OGD was completely blocked by gene silencing of SUMO2/3. Collectively, these results suggest several mechanisms for OGD-modulated SUMOylation, point to a number of signaling pathways that may be targets of SUMO-based signaling and recovery from ischemic stress, and demonstrate a tightly controlled crosstalk between the SUMO and ubiquitin conjugation pathways.",

Recent evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in PCa metastasis and hold great promise as therapeutic targets. In this study, we found that miR-573 expression is significantly lower in metastatic tissues than matched primary PCa. Its downregulation is correlated with high Gleason score and cancer-related mortality of PCa patients (P = 0.041, Kaplan-Meier analysis). Through gain- and loss-of function experiments, we demonstrated that miR-573 inhibits PCa cell migration, invasion and TGF-β1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and lung metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, miR573 directly targets the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) gene. Knockdown of FGFR1 phenocopies the effects of miR-573 expression on PCa cell invasion, whereas overexpression of FGFR1 partially attenuates the functions of miR-573. Consequently, miR-573 modulates the activation of FGFR1-downstream signaling in response to fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). Importantly, we showed that GATA3 directly increases miR-573 expression, and thus down-regulates FGFR1 expression, EMT and invasion of PCa cells in a miR-573-dependent manner, supporting the involvement of GATA3, miR-573 and FGFR1 in controlling the EMT process during PCa metastasis. Altogether, our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism by which miR-573 modulates EMT and metastasis of PCa cells, and suggest miR-573 as a potential biomarker and/or therapeutic target for PCa management.

However, the upstream mechanisms of these signaling events remain unknown. In mammals, the small GTP-binding protein Ras mediates ERK1/2 activation through activation of downstream effectors Raf-1-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 in response to a variety of stimuli. It is not clear whether this classic Ras cascade plays a role in TLR signaling in avian cells. In the present study, we investigated the role of Ras in FLG- and LPS-mediated signaling in ERK activation in chicken heterophils. Treatment of heterophils with LPS caused a rapid (within 5min) activation of Ras-GTP. The role of Ras activation in LPS-induced stimulation of ERK1/2 was corroborated when the specific Ras inhibitor, FTI-277, inhibited ERK1/2 activation. The classic Ras-mediated pathway of ERK1/2 activation by LPS was confirmed when the specific Raf-1 inhibitor, GW 5074, and the MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, both reduced ERK activation by 51-60%. Of more interest was that treatment of the heterophils with FLG did not activate Ras-GTP. Likewise, neither FTI-277 nor GW 5074 had any effect on FLG-mediated activation of ERK1/2. Another small GTPase, Rap1, has been shown to play a role in mammalian neutrophil function. Using a Rap1-GTP pull-down assay, we found that FLG stimulation, but not LPS, of avian heterophils induced a rapid and transient Rap1 activation. Rap1 has been shown to activate the ERK1/2 via a different Raf family member B-Raf whose downstream effector is MEK1/2. We show here that FLG stimulation of heterophils induces the phosphorylation of Rap1. The FLG induction of the Rap1-->B-Raf-->MEK1/2-->ERK1/2 cascade was confirmed by the reduction of ERK1/2 activation by the specific Rap1 inhibitor (GGTI-298) and U0126. The results demonstrate that for the first time that the small GTPase Ras family is involved in TLR signaling of avian heterophils with the TLR agonists LPS (Ras) and FLG (Rap1) inducing differential signaling cascades to activate the downstream ERK MAP kinase.",

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of abrogation of FGFR-1-dependent signaling on pancreatic cancer cell growth.;PANC-1 human pancreatic cancer cells were transfected with a truncated FGFR-1 complementary DNA (FGFR405), resulting in the expression of a kinase-deficient receptor. Activation of endogenous FGFR-1 was assessed in immunoblot studies with antiphosphotyrosine and anti-active mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase antibodies. Effects on cell growth were determined in vitro and in nude mice.;PANC-1 clones expressing the truncated receptor showed attenuated receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and MAP kinase activation in response to bFGF, decreased basal cell growth, and a marked decrease in tumor-forming potential in vivo. Confirmatory experiments with MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells indicated that FGFR405 also attenuated FGF-dependent MAP kinase activation in this cell line.;The findings suggest that FGFR-dependent signaling is crucial for pancreatic cancer growth and raise the possibility that inhibition of FGFR signaling may ultimately prove useful as a therapeutic option in patients with pancreatic cancer.",

The present study systematically characterised oxygen-glucose-deprivation (OGD) in primary rat cortical neurones to establish a reproducible model with components of both cell-death endpoints. OGD induced a time-dependent reduction in cell viability, with 80% cell death occurring 24 h after 3 h exposure to 0% O2 and 0.5 mM glucose. Indicative of a necrotic component to OGD-induced cell death, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor inhibition with MK-801 attenuated neuronal loss by 60%. The lack of protection by the caspase inhibitors DEVD-CHO and z-VAD-fmk suggested that under these conditions neurones did not die by an apoptotic mechanism. Moderating the severity of the insult by decreasing OGD exposure to 60 min did not reduce the amount of necrosis, but did induce a small degree of apoptosis (a slight reduction in cell death was observed in the presence of 10 uM DEVD-CHO). In separate experiments purported to enhance the apoptotic component, cells were gradually deprived of O2, exposed to 4% O2 (as opposed to 0%) during the OGD period, or maintained in serum-containing media throughout. While NMDA receptor antagonism significantly reduced cortical cell death under all conditions, a caspase-inhibitor sensitive component of cell death was not uncovered.

Thirty-nine tumors were analyzed using a commercial panel for mutations and copy number variations in 50 cancer-related genes.;On the basis of combined morphologic and molecular evidence of PA, 4 subsets of SDC emerged: 1) carcinomas with morphologic evidence of PA but intact PLAG1 and HMGA2 (n = 22); 2) carcinomas with PLAG1 alteration (n = 18) or 3) HMGA2 alteration (n = 12); and 4) de novo carcinomas, without morphologic or molecular evidence of PA (n = 14). The median disease-free survival was 37 months (95% confidence interval, 28.4-45.6 months). Disease-free survival and other clinicopathologic parameters did not differ for the subsets defined above.

In particular, little information exists as to the relevance of FGF and their specific receptors to human fetal development. We studied the anatomical distribution of messenger RNA encoding FGF-2 and one of its high affinity receptors, FGFR1, using in situ hybridization in a variety of human fetal tissues in early second trimester. Corresponding protein distributions were determined by immunohistochemistry. Both FGF-2 and FGFR1 mRNA and proteins were found to be present in every organ and tissue examined, but with defined cellular localizations. In skeletal muscle, both FGF-2 and FGFR1 mRNA and peptides were present in differentiated fibers, and both co-localized to proliferating chondrocytes of the epiphyseal growth plate. FGF-2 and FGFR1 mRNA and peptides were also present within cardiac or gastrointestinal smooth muscle. Within the gastrointestinal tract FGF-2 mRNA and peptide were located in the submucosal tissue, whereas FGFR1 was expressed within the overlying mucosa. Similarly, in skin, FGF-2 was expressed within the dermis whereas FGFR1 mRNA and peptide were most apparent in the stratum germinativum of the epidermis. In kidney and lung, FGFR1 mRNA was located in the tubular and alveolar epithelia respectively, whereas FGF-2 was expressed in both epithelial and mesenchymal cell populations. Both growth factor and receptor were widespread in both neuroblasts and glioblasts in the cerebral cortex of the brain. Immunoreactivity for FGF-2 and FGFR1 was seen in all vascular endothelial cells of major vessels and capillaries. Within the skin, kidney, lung, and intestine FGF-2 immunoreactivity was found in basement membranes underlying epithelia, and was associated with the extracellular matrix and plasma membranes of many cell types. The results show that FGF-2 and one of its receptors are widely expressed anatomically in the mid-trimester human fetus.",

In particular, FGFR1 gene amplification has been implicated in squamous cell lung and breast cancers. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting FGFR1, including AZD4547 and E3810 (Lucitanib), are currently in early phase clinical trials. Unfortunately, drug resistance limits the long-term success of TKIs, with mutations at the \"gatekeeper\" residue leading to tumor progression. Here we show the first structural and kinetic characterization of the FGFR1 gatekeeper mutation, V561M FGFR1. The V561M mutation confers a 38-fold increase in autophosphorylation achieved at least in part by a network of interacting residues forming a hydrophobic spine to stabilize the active conformation. Moreover, kinetic assays established that the V561M mutation confers significant resistance to E3810, while retaining affinity for AZD4547. Structural analyses of these TKIs with wild type (WT) and gatekeeper mutant forms of FGFR1 offer clues to developing inhibitors that maintain potency against gatekeeper mutations. We show that AZD4547 affinity is preserved by V561M FGFR1 due to a flexible linker that allows multiple inhibitor binding modes. This is the first example of a TKI binding in distinct conformations to WT and gatekeeper mutant forms of FGFR, highlighting adaptable regions in both the inhibitor and binding pocket crucial for drug design. Exploiting inhibitor flexibility to overcome drug resistance has been a successful strategy for combatting diseases such as AIDS and may be an important approach for designing inhibitors effective against kinase gatekeeper mutations.

Considering microglial cells as a target for anti-inflammatory treatment we studied the effects of microglial depletion on anti-inflammatory treatment of mouse hippocampal slice cultures subjected to ischemia-like neurodegeneration, induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). Hippocampal slice cultures, derived from 7-day-old mice and grown for 2 weeks, were divided into 8 groups: (1) control cultures; (2) sham-OGD cultures; (3) OGD cultures; (4) OGD cultures treated with triflusal during OGD; (5) microglia-depleted control cultures; (6) microglia-depleted sham-OGD cultures; (7) microglia-depleted OGD cultures; and (8) microglia-depleted OGD cultures treated with triflusal during OGD. The resulting neurodegeneration was quantified by densitometric measurements of cellular uptake of propidium iodide (PI), with focus on the hippocampal CA1 subfield. Subjection of regular cultures to OGD for 30 min induced a significant increase in PI uptake in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer, compared to control cultures. The presence of 100 microM triflusal during OGD protected against OGD-induced neurodegeneration, and reduced the number of OGD-induced NFkB positive-cells correspondingly. Cultures treated with the Mac1-saporin complex for 7 days displayed an almost total loss of microglial cells. When subjected to OGD after microglial depletion, these cultures displayed a significant increase in OGD-induced PI uptake compared to non-depleted cultures. The presence of triflusal during OGD of these cultures reduced neurodegeneration of the irrespective absence of microglia. In accordance with that, the presence of triflusal during OGD significantly inhibited the increase in the number of reactive microglia and proliferative cells in the CA1 pyramidal and dentate granule cell layers.

During hypoxia/ischemia, lactate released from astrocytes is taken up by neurons and stored for energy. This process is mediated by monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) in the central nervous system. In the present study, we investigated the ability of astrocytes to protect neurons from oxygen- and glucose-deprivation (OGD) injury via an MCT-dependent mechanism in vitro. Primary cultures of neurons, astrocytes, and astrocytes-neurons derived from rat hippocampus were subjected to OGD, MCT inhibition with small interfering (si)RNA. Cell survival and expression of MCT4, MCT2, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and neuronal nuclear antigen were evaluated. OGD significantly increased cell death in neuronal cultures and up-regulated MCT4 expression in astrocyte cultures, but no increased cell death was observed in neuron-astrocyte co-cultures or astrocyte cultures. However, neuronal cell death in co-cultures was increased by exposure to MCT4- or MCT2-specific siRNA, and this effect was attenuated by the addition of lactate into the extracellular medium of neuronal cultures prior to OGD. These findings demonstrate that resistance to OGD injury in astrocyte-neuron co-cultures occurs via an MCT-dependent mechanism. ",

Immunohistochemical analysis of the proteins encoded by the genes that were amplified frequently (FGF3/4, FGFR1, CCNE1, PAK1, JUNB, and MDM2) was performed on a tissue microarray comprising 254 cases of ovarian neoplasms. Regarding histologic type, characteristic patterns of copy number changes were revealed. They correlated with histologic tumor type and with intratumoral heterogeneity. Gain of FGF3/4 and CCNE1 was found in all serous carcinomas. Endometrioid carcinomas most frequently showed gain of JUNB (83%), KRAS2 (67%), MYCN (50%), ESR (50%), and CCND2 (50%). Of the serous borderline tumors, 80% harbored amplification of FGFR1 and MDM2 and a 75% gain of PIK3CA. Only CCNE1 immunoreactivity was significantly correlated with CGH results (P < .05) and postoperative survival (P < .05).

Activation of FGFR-1, -2, and -3 by FGFs induces mitogenic responses in various cell types, but the mitogenic potential of FGFR-4 has not been previously explored. We have compared the properties of BaF3 murine lymphoid cells and L6 rat myoblast cells engineered to express FGFR-1 or FGFR-4. Acidic FGF binds with high affinity to and elicits tyrosine phosphorylation of FGFR-1 or FGFR-4 receptors displayed on BaF3 cells, but only FGFR-1 activation leads to cell survival and growth. FGFR-4 activation also fails to elicit detectable signals characteristic of the FGFR-1 response: tyrosine phosphorylation of SHC and extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) proteins and induction of fos and tis11 RNA expression. The only detected response to FGFR-4 activation was weak phosphorylation of phospholipase C gamma. A chimeric receptor containing the extracellular domain of FGFR-4 and the intracellular domain of FGFR-1 confers FGF-dependent growth upon transfected BaF3 cells, demonstrating that the intracellular domains of the receptors dictate their functional capacity. Activation of FGFR-1 in transfected L6 myoblasts induced far stronger phosphorylation of phospholipase C gamma, SHC, and ERK proteins than could activation of FGFR-4 in L6 cells, and only FGFR-1 activation induced tyrosine phosphorylation of a characteristic 80-kD protein.

OM-RCA-01 has been shown to inhibit in vitro kinase activity of FGFR1 and has high affinity (Kd of 1.59 nM). In human renal carcinoma Caki-1 FGFR1-expressing cells, OM-RCA-01 potently inhibited FGF-mediated signaling and proliferation. In vivo, the tumors in untreated mice or mice treated with non-specific IgG continued their aggressive growth to reach the size of 2,000 cm3, at which point the mice were killed. In contrast, treatment with OM-RCA-01 not only significant arrested further growth of the tumors (P < 0.01) but also demonstrated differences in tumor volume compared with vehicle already on Day 13. A similar anti-tumor activity of OM-RCA-01 was observed when the antibody was given in low (1 mg/kg) or high (10 mg/kg) doses (P = 0.917). In Matrigel assay, OM-RCA-01 significantly inhibited FGF-induced endothelial cell migration, capillary-like tubular structure and mature vessels formation. Administration of 10 mg/kg antibody for up to 35 days resulted in minimal body weight loss and no observations of gross toxicity were made.

Over-expression of FGFs and their receptors is a feature of pancreatic cancer and correlates with poor prognosis, but whether their expression impacts on PSCs is unclear. At the invasive front of human pancreatic cancer, FGF2 and FGFR1 localise to the nucleus in activated PSCs but not cancer cells. In vitro, inhibiting FGFR1 and FGF2 in PSCs, using RNAi or chemical inhibition, resulted in significantly reduced cell proliferation, which was not seen in cancer cells. In physiomimetic organotypic co-cultures, FGFR inhibition prevented PSC as well as cancer cell invasion. FGFR inhibition resulted in cytoplasmic localisation of FGFR1 and FGF2, in contrast to vehicle-treated conditions where PSCs with nuclear FGFR1 and FGF2 led cancer cells to invade the underlying extra-cellular matrix. Strikingly, abrogation of nuclear FGFR1 and FGF2 in PSCs abolished cancer cell invasion. These findings suggest a novel therapeutic approach, where preventing nuclear FGF/FGFR mediated proliferation and invasion in PSCs leads to disruption of the tumour microenvironment, preventing pancreatic cancer cell invasion.

Leveraging the mitogenic potential of FGF2/FGFR1 signaling in stem cells for therapeutic applications necessitates a mechanistic understanding of how this receptor stimulates cell cycle progression. Using small interfering RNA (siRNA) depletion, antibody-inhibition, and small molecule inhibition, we establish that FGFR1 activity is rate limiting for self-renewal of hMSCs. We show that FGFR1 promotes stem cell proliferation through multiple mechanisms that unite to antagonize cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors. FGFR1 not only stimulates c-Myc to suppress transcription of the CDK inhibitors p21(Waf1) and p27(Kip1), thus promoting cell cycle progression but also increases the activity of protein kinase B (AKT) and the level of S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2), resulting in the nuclear exclusion and reduction of p21(Waf1). The in vivo importance of FGFR1 signaling for the control of proliferation in mesenchymal progenitor populations is underscored by defects in ventral mesoderm formation during development upon inhibition of its signaling. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that FGFR1 signaling mediates the continuation of MSC growth and establishes a receptor target for enhancing the expansion of mesenchymal progenitors while maintaining their multilineage potential.",

At 48, 72, and 120 h postinoculation (PI), embryos and chorioallantoic membranes (CAM) were sampled, fixed, and paraffin-wax embedded. Allantoic fluid was also collected and titrated in chicken embryo kidney cells (CEK). The sensitivity of IHC in detecting IBV antigens in the CAM of inoculated eggs matched the virus reisolation and detection in CEK. Using IHC, antigens of IBV were detected in nasal epithelium, trachea, lung, spleen, myocardial vasculature, liver, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, skin, sclera of the eye, spinal cord, as well as in brain neurons of the inoculated embryos. These results were consistent with virus isolation and denote the wide tissue tropism of IBV M41 in the chicken embryo. Most importantly, we found infection of vasculature and smooth muscle of the proventriculus which has not seen before with IBV strain M41.;IHC can be an additional useful tool for diagnosis of IBV infection in chickens and allows further studies to foster a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of infections with IBV strains of different virulence.

Related materials include few-layer-graphene (FLG), ultrathin graphite, graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), and graphene nanosheets (GNS). This review proposes a systematic nomenclature for this set of Graphene-Family Nanomaterials (GFNs) and discusses specific materials properties relevant for biomolecular and cellular interactions. We discuss several unique modes of interaction between GFNs and nucleic acids, lipid bilayers, and conjugated small molecule drugs and dyes. Some GFNs are produced as dry powders using thermal exfoliation, and in these cases, inhalation is a likely route of human exposure. Some GFNs have aerodynamic sizes that can lead to inhalation and substantial deposition in the human respiratory tract, which may impair lung defense and clearance leading to the formation of granulomas and lung fibrosis. The limited literature on in vitro toxicity suggests that GFNs can be either benign or toxic to cells, and it is hypothesized that the biological response will vary across the material family depending on layer number, lateral size, stiffness, hydrophobicity, surface functionalization, and dose. Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in target cells is a potential mechanism for toxicity, although the extremely high hydrophobic surface area of some GFNs may also lead to significant interactions with membrane lipids leading to direct physical toxicity or adsorption of biological molecules leading to indirect toxicity. Limited in vivo studies demonstrate systemic biodistribution and biopersistence of GFNs following intravenous delivery. Similar to other smooth, continuous, biopersistent implants or foreign bodies, GFNs have the potential to induce foreign body tumors. Long-term adverse health impacts must be considered in the design of GFNs for drug delivery, tissue engineering, and fluorescence-based biomolecular sensing. Future research is needed to explore fundamental biological responses to GFNs including systematic assessment of the physical and chemical material properties related to toxicity. Complete materials characterization and mechanistic toxicity studies are essential for safer design and manufacturing of GFNs in order to optimize biological applications with minimal risks for environmental health and safety.",

A single repeat of the murine filaggrin gene (Flg) was covalently linked to a RMR motif and cloned into a bacterial expression system for protein production. Purified FLG+RMR (mFLG+RMR) was applied in vitro to HEK-293T cells and a reconstructed human epidermis (RHE) tissue model. Immunochemistry demonstrated RMR-dependent cellular uptake of FLG+RMR in a dose- and time-dependent manner in HEK cells. Immunohistochemical staining of the RHE model identified penetration of FLG+RMR to the stratum granulosum, the epidermal layer at which FLG deficiency is thought to be pathologically relevant. In vivo application of FLG+RMR to FLG-deficient flaky tail (ft/ft) mice skin demonstrated internalization and processing of recombinant FLG+RMR to restore the normal phenotype. These results suggest that topically applied RMR-linked FLG monomers are able to penetrate epidermal tissue, be internalized into the appropriate cell type, and be processed to a size similar to wild-type functional barrier peptides to restore necessary barrier function, and prove to be therapeutic for patients with AD.

The complex of HH2 and CpG-ODN could induce much stronger Th1 cytokine and chemokine responses than HH2 or CpG-ODN alone. HH2-CpG-ODN immunized piglets showed higher B cell percentage in PBMCs than CpG-ODN alone.

Gene expression of FGFR-1 was developmentally regulated; expression was higher in prepubertal testes and decreased with sexual maturity. The transcript was found to be expressed in Leydig-enriched fractions, peritubular cells, Sertoli cells, and, to a lesser extent, germ cells. FSH as well as (Bu)2cAMP enhanced FGFR-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in cultured Sertoli cells, suggesting an involvement of the protein kinase-A pathway. Addition of basic FGF (bFGF), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), or interleukin-1 alpha resulted in a dose- and time-related increase in FGFR-1 mRNA levels. The effect of bFGF was specific, because it was neutralized by cotreatment with an anti-bFGF. We tested medium conditioned by germ cells and found a stimulation of the Sertoli cell FGFR-1 mRNA levels, which was abolished by immunodepletion of the conditioned medium with anti-TNF alpha antibodies. It is suggested that in Sertoli cells, bFGF action, when mediated by FGFR-1, is under a complex hormonal (FSH) and paracrine and/or autocrine control exerted at least by bFGF, TNF alpha, and interleukin-1 alpha.",

The FLG 29.1 cells were metabolically radiolabeled with [3H]glucosamine and [35S]sulfate, and the labeled glycoproteins were analyzed by anion exchange chromatography, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoprecipitation experiments. One of the major glycoproteins synthesized by the TPA-treated FLG 29.1 cells was sulfated, had an identical electrophoretic mobility to purified BSP, and could be immunoprecipitated with a specific antibody against human BSP (LF 6). Thus, this glycoprotein was tentatively identified as the BSP. Furthermore, mRNA for BSP was also detected in TPA-treated FLG 29.1 cells by RNA-polymerase chain reaction. Most BSP synthesized by FLG 29.1 cells remained cell-associated, and this is in contrast with those synthesized by osteoblasts, where the protein is rapidly released into the extracellular matrix. Immunocytochemistry using an anti-BSP antibody showed a prominent paranuclear (suggestive of Golgi apparatus) localization of BSP in the TPA-treated FLG 29.1 cells after permeabilization, while untreated cells were not significantly immunostained. Localization of BSP at the plasma membrane was also demonstrated in the TPA-treated FLG 29.1 cells by the fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Since TPA has been demonstrated to induce expression of various osteoclastic characteristics in FLG 29.1 cells, induction of BSP expression by TPA suggests that the protein may play a role during the differentiation process of osteoclasts or in functions of differentiated osteoclasts.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Increasing evidences suggest a close association between tumor metastasis and the inflammatory factors secreted by tumor microenvironment. It has been reported that epithelial mesenchymal-transition (EMT) plays a significant role during multiple types of tumor metastasis and progression induced by inflammatory factor from tumor microenvironment. Previous researches implied that fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) can promote tumor progression and cause poor prognosis in several types of malignant tumors via interacting with its receptor fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1). However, the effects of FGF1-FGFR1 on tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) are not yet completely understood. In the present study, we evaluated the effects and function of FGF1-FGFR1 axis on TSCC metastasis. In addition, we investigated whether the EMT pathway is involved in these effects, thus modulating the TSCC progression. The expression of FGFR1 was measured both in tongue cancer cell lines and tissues by qRT-PCR and western blot. We found that FGFR1 was up-regulated in TSCC tissues compared to non-neoplastic tongue tissues. Additionally, overexpression of FGFR1 is positively associated with poor differentiation and metastasis potential. Furthermore, the function of FGF1-FGFR1 was examined in TSCC cell line. The results implied that FGF1 can obviously promote Cal27 cells migration and invasion abilities through FGFR1, while the motile and invasive capabilities can be severely attenuated when knockdown the expression of FGFR1 by specific siRNAs. Further investigation results show that FGF1-FGFR1 axis promotes TSCC metastasis by modulating EMT pathway. However, this effect can be inhibited by blocking the FGF1-FGFR1 axis using FGFR1 specific siRNAs. In conclusion, our findings of the present study provide the evidences that FGF1-FGFR1 axis promotes the TSCC metastasis through the EMT pathway. ",

In contrast, lentiviral vector mediated GRP78 overexpression (LV-GRP78) strengthened resistance of PC12 cells to OGD injury and increased LC3 and Beclin1 expression. Moreover, knockdown of GRP78 in stable GRP78 overexpressing PC12 cells abolished the upregulation of LC3II/LC3I.

OGD compromised the barrier integrity as confirmed by decreases in transendothelial electric resistance and concomitant increases in flux of permeability markers sodium fluorescein and Evan's blue albumin across cocultures. Transfection of cells with constitutively active RhoA also increased flux and reduced transendothelial electric resistance, whereas inactivation of RhoA by anti-RhoA Ig electroporation exerted opposite effects.

The effect of neutrophils on the increase in BBB permeability associated with IR injury has yet to be modeled in vitro. To address these questions, the human brain endothelial cell line hCMEC/D3 was exposed to OGD with reoxygenation, and permeability was measured for a range of OGD exposure times (1-24h). One hour of exposure to OGD induced a reversible increase in permeability, unassociated with cytotoxicity (assessed from lactate dehydrogenase release). However, 12-24h OGD exposures induced sustained increases in permeability associated with cytotoxicity. The 1h permeability increase was inhibited with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitors l-NAME (10(-)(7)mol/l) and 1400W (10(-)(7)mol/l). Neutrophils (5x10(6)/ml) blocked the permeability increase associated with 1h OGD, whether applied during or after OGD exposure. Permeability remained low if neutrophils were activated with leukotriene (Lt)B(4) (10(-)(7)mol/l) or exposed to a transendothelial gradient of LtB(4), while neutrophil activation with phorbyl myristate acetate (4x10(-)(8)mol/l) induced a small increase.

This supports the idea that FGF-2 might act as an autocrine mitogen for adrenocortical cells. In the medulla FGFR-1 mRNA levels were low at the first 3 postnatal weeks and increased towards the adult.

FGFR-2 IIIc was abundant in the cancer cells from 83 of 117 PDAC cases, which correlated with decreased duration to development of liver metastasis after surgery. FGFR-2 IIIc-transfected cells exhibited increased proliferation in vitro and formed larger subcutaneous and orthotopic tumors, the latter producing more liver metastases. Moreover, FGF-2 exerted a more rapid stimulatory effect on the levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) in FGFR-2 IIIc stably transfected PANC-1 cells, compared with control cells. FGFR-2 IIIc-transfected cells also formed more spheres and contained more side population cells. Suppression of FGFR-2 IIIc expression inhibited the proliferation of PANC-1 cells, whereas an anti-FGFR-2 IIIc antibody inhibited the proliferation and migration of PANC-1 cells. Thus, high FGFR-2 IIIc levels in PDAC contribute to disease aggressiveness and confer to pancreatic cancer cells features suggestive of cancer stem cells, indicating that FGFR-2 IIIc may be a novel and important therapeutic target in PDAC.",

DCX expression is increased in subventricular zone (SVZ) cells migrating to the boundary of an ischemic lesion after induction of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in adult rats and mice. We tested the hypothesis that DCX, in addition to being a marker of migrating neuroblasts, serves to protect neuroblasts from conditions of stress, such as oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). Using gene transfer technology, we overexpressed DCX in rat SVZ and U-87 human glioma cells. The cells remained viable against severe OGD, up to 32 h exhibiting 1% apoptosis compared with 100% apoptosis in control. In addition, these genetically modified cells upregulated expression of E-, VE- and N-cadherin, molecules that promote endothelial survival signals via the VE-cadherin/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K)/AKT/beta-catenin pathway and inactivate the proapoptotic factor Bad. DCX overexpression also significantly increased cell migration in SVZ tissue explants and U-87 cells and significantly upregulated microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2) and nestin protein levels in SVZ and U-87 cells compared with wild-type control cells. Knocking down DCX expression in DCX overexpressing SVZ and U-87 cells with DCX small interfering RNA (siRNA), confirmed the specificity of DCX on cell survival against OGD, and the DCX induced upregulation of E-, VE- and N-cadherin, MAP2 and nestin. In NIH3T3 cells, DCX overexpression had no effect on cell survival against OGD, and indicating that the protective effects of DCX was restricted to brain cells e.g. SVZ and U-87 cells.

Scatchard analysis of 125I-labelled iodocyanopindolol to untreated (undifferentiated) or TPA-treated (differentiated) FLG 29.1 cells revealed the presence of a single high-affinity site with a Kd value around 24 pM and 8 pM respectively and with superimposable binding capacity (1.18 fmol/mg protein).

Pretreatment of untreated and TPA-treated FLG 29.1 cells with propranolol inhibited the catecholamine effect on cAMP accumulation, while pretreatment with clonidine had no effect.

However, the undesirable cardiotoxic effects of sunitinib, such as congestive heart failure and hypertension, limit its use in the clinical setting. As multiple receptor tyrosine kinases are inhibited by sunitinib, it raises a question as to which target mediates sunitinib-induced cardiotoxicity. Here, we reported that the injection of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) mRNA into one- to two-cell stage embryos protected against sunitinib-induced cardiotoxicity in zebrafish. In addition, FGF2 significantly prevented sunitinib-induced cardiotoxicity in cardiomyoblast H9c2 cells, possibly via activating the PLC-γ/c-Raf/CREB pathway. Importantly, FGF2 did not compromise the antitumor activity of sunitinib in Caki-1 and OS-RC-2 renal cell carcinoma cells. Molecular docking simulations further revealed an interaction between the tyrosine kinase domain of FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) and sunitinib. Taken together, our results clearly demonstrated that FGF2 inhibition plays an important role in sunitinib-induced cardiotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo. This study also provided a basis for further research on sunitinib-induced cardiotoxicity and may allow rational design of new sunitinib derivatives with fewer or weak cardiotoxic effects. ",

We here present a finding that ibudilast prevents oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced oligodendroglial injury. The oligodendrocyte-like cells (OLC), differentiated from the CG-4 cell line established from rat oligodendrocyte-type-2 astrocyte (O-2A) progenitor cells, were exposed to hypoxia in the absence of glucose for 12 h and subsequent reoxygenation for 2 h. Cell damage was evaluated by measuring activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released into the culture medium. OGD for 12 h induced 30 to 50% LDH release into the medium. OLC damage induced by deprivation of oxygen and glucose was prevented by ibudilast at concentrations of > or = 50 microM. The protection given by ibudilast against OGD-induced injury was enhanced by prostacyclin (PGI2). OGD-induced OLC injury was prevented by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2, 3-dione (CNQX), an inhibitor of non-NMDA GluR or deprivation of Ca2+ from culture medium. While ibudilast increased intracellular cAMP at concentrations of > or = 10 microM, at least 100 microM concentrations were needed to increase intracellular cGMP.

Glycoprotein non-metastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB) is known to be vital in bone formation. However, the effect of GPNMB on bone regeneration and the underlying molecular mechanism are still undefined. Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-mediating signaling is pivotal in bone formation and angiogenesis. Therefore, we assessed GPNMB function as a communicating molecule between osteoblasts and angiogenesis, and the possible correlation with FGFR-1 signaling. Recombinant GPNMB dose-dependently increased the differentiation of human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) into osteoblasts, as well as the mRNA levels of osteoblasts marker alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin (OCN). Furthermore, these increases depended on the activation of FGFR-1 signaling, as pretreatment with FGFR-1 siRNA or its inhibitor SU5402 dramatically dampened GPNMB-induced osteogenesis. Additionally, GPNMB triggered dose-dependently the proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (hUVECs), FGFR-1 phosphorylation, as well as capillary tube and vessels formation in vitro and in vivo. Blocking FGFR-1 signaling dampened GPNMB-induced angiogenic activity. Following construction of a rodent cranial defect model, scaffolds delivering GPNMB resulted in an evident increase in blood vessels and new bone formation; however, combined delivery of GPNMB and SU5402 abated these increase in defect sites. Taken together, these results suggest that GPNMB stimulates bone regeneration by inducing osteogenesis and angiogenesis via regulating FGFR-1 signaling. Consequently, our findings will clarify a new explanation about how GPNMB induces bone repair, and provide a potential target for bone regeneration therapeutics and bone engineering.",

Given that atheroma is associated with the proliferation of a range of cell types, including smooth muscle cells, it has been proposed that these growth factors may play a part in the genesis and/or maintenance of atheromatous lesions. The aim of our study was to examine the distribution of acidic and basic FGF and their known receptor, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR-1), in normal and atherosclerotic arteries.;Formalin fixed was embedded archival material from a wide range of vessels was examined using a three stage avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase technique and specific polyclonal antibodies to acidic and basic FGF and FGFR-1.;In normal arteries basic FGF immunoreactivity was found in medial smooth muscle cells and adventitial blood vessels, the luminal endothelium being non-reactive. Acidic FGF expression was observed predominantly in adventitial fibroblasts, while FGFR-1 expression was confined to the adventitial microvasculature. In early, simple, and advanced lesions acidic and basic FGF were expressed in macrophages and smooth muscle cells, the principal cell types involved in atherosclerotic lesion formation. Increased expression of basic FGF and FGFR-1 was particularly associated with neovascularisation of the atheromatous lesions.;Acidic and basic FGF are expressed in early, simple and advanced atherosclerotic plaques. This suggests that in vivo these growth factors may have a role in the genesis of this disease. Basic FGF and FGFR-1 may potentially be involved in plaque neovascularisation. Such FGF driven angiogenic events may be central to the life threatening complications of atheroma and provide new options for therapeutic intervention.",

Previous studies have indicated that acidic FGF is involved in liver regeneration and hepatic differentiation via the stem cell compartment, as well as in liver development (Marsden et al., Lab. Invest. 67:427-433, 1992). To further define the role of acidic FGF and its receptor systems in the liver, we examined the expression and cellular localization of FGF receptor-1 (flg) and FGF receptor-2 (bek) in the liver by Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization techniques during liver regeneration, hepatic differentiation, and ontogenesis. In the normal adult liver, flg is absent in hepatocytes, whereas a low level of bek can be detected. The transcripts for bek increased, while flg exhibited little change during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy. Both flg and bek were expressed at high levels in the developing liver. flg was expressed at a high level in embryonic liver and further increased after birth, whereas a significant increase of bek occurred at the postnatal stage of liver development. In the 2-acetylaminofluorene/partial hepatectomy model, both flg and bek are expressed at high levels during the period of active proliferation and differentiation of oval cells. In situ hybridization showed that flg was mainly localized in oval cells, whereas bek was highly expressed in both oval and Ito cells. The data suggest that bek is involved in the proliferation of mature hepatocyte proliferation during liver regeneration, while flg is characteristic of primitive hepatic cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Examination of the expression of FGF receptors (FGFRs) revealed that although PC12 cells express FGFR-1, -3, and -4, fnr-PC12 cells have a reduced level of expression of FGFR-1 but not FGFR-3 and -4. Transfection of FGFR-1 into fnr-PC12 cells efficiently restored aFGF-induced neurite outgrowth, whereas transfection of FGFR-3 was much less efficient. Transfection of a chimeric receptor consisting of the extracellular domain of FGFR-3 fused to the transmembrane and intracellular domain of FGFR-1, termed FR31b, efficiently restored aFGF-induced neurite outgrowth. This demonstrates that the difference between these two receptors in their ability to induce neurite outgrowth is attributable to differences in the signaling capacity of their cytoplasmic domains. Activation of the chimeric receptor by aFGF induced a stronger and more persistent increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins than did activation of FGFR-3 alone. In particular, the activation of MAP kinase by FR31b was more persistent than when activated by FGFR-3. This difference in signaling potential of FGFR-1 and -3 in fnr-PC12 cells may account for the difference in the potential for induction of neurite outgrowth. These results demonstrate that FGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells occurs mainly via FGFR-1 and not via the other FGFRs expressed in these cells.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (CMECs) on the neurogenesis of NSCs with or without oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). The NSCs acquired from primary culture were immunostained to prove cell purity. Survival and proliferation of NSCs were determined after the co-culture with CMECs for 7 days. After removing the CMECs, NSCs were randomly divided into two groups as follows: OGD and non-OGD groups. Both groups were maintained in differentiation culture for 4 days to evaluate the differentiation rate. Mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cells co-cultured with NSCs served as control group. NSCs co-cultured with CMECs had an increase in size (on the 7th day: 89.80±26.12 μm vs. 73.08±15.01 μm, P<0.001) (n=12) and number [on the 7th day: 6.33±5.61/high power objective (HP) vs. 2.23±1.61/HP, P<0.001] (n=12) as compared with those co-cultured with MEF cells. After further differentiation culture for 4 days, NSCs co-cultured with CMECs had an increase in neuronal differentiation rate in OGD and non-OGD groups, but not in the control group (15.16% and 16.07% vs. 8.81%; both P<0.001) (n=6). This study provided evidence that OGD could not alter the effects of CMECs in promoting the neuronal differentiation potential of NSCs.

The relative contribution of necrosis and apoptosis was dependent on the duration of the OGD. OGD-mediated apoptotic cell death is caspase-dependent because the addition of a pan-caspase inhibitor specifically blocked the apoptotic component of the OGD-mediated cell death. Moreover, we observed the activation of caspase-3, -7, and -9 after OGD in neurons and microglial cells. No activation of these caspases was observed in GFAP positive cells.

Following incubation of frozen sections at 37 degrees C in phosphate-buffered saline, FGF1 staining was also revealed in myoepithelial cells and basement membrane adjacent to carcinoma cells.

Cell lines transfected either with DHBV or HBV DNA and primary duck hepatocyte cell cultures were used. Virus production was analysed by PCR and a quantitative PCR was established for DHBV for determination of the inhibitory concentrations of the drug. 50% inhibition was achieved with an FLG concentration of 0.2 microg/ml (0.7 microM) and 90% inhibition was observed with an FLG concentration of 1.0 microg/ml (3.7 microM) using the DHBV transfected cell line. FLG showed an effect on DHBV production in primary duck hepatocyte cell cultures at concentrations down to 0.1 microg/ml (0.4 microM). However, the DHBV production returned to pre-treatment levels within a few days after cessation of treatment. HBV production in transfected cell lines was also inhibited by FLG. Both DHBV and HBV DNA-polymerases were inhibited by FLG triphosphate and 50% inhibition was observed at a concentration of 0.05 microg/ml (0.1 microM) for DHBV and 0.03 microg/ml (0.05 microM) for HBV.

This early lethality has obscured functions of FGFR-1 that might occur later in development. To circumvent these embryonic defects, we generated chimeras by injecting FGFR-1-deficient (R1-/-) ES cells into wild-type blastocysts. We found that the fgfr-1 gene plays an important role after gastrulation and that it acts in a cell-autonomous fashion. Embryos with a high contribution of R1-/- cells replicate the FGFR-1 null phenotype and die during gastrulation. In contrast, the majority of embryos with a low contribution of R1-/- cells complete gastrulation and display malformations of posterior structures at later stages of embryogenesis. These abnormalities include truncation of embryonic structures, limb bud malformation, partial duplication of the neural tube, tail distortion, and spina bifida caused by the amplification of neural tissue in the posterior portion of the spinal cord. Thus, FGFR-1 plays a role in neurulation, suggesting that there may be a connection between FGFR-1-mediated signal pathways and neural tube defects, the most common malformations in the human central nervous system.",

Because AMPK activation effectively induces autophagy, we tested the protective efficacy of PT1 on cardiomyocytes after oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) in vitro. Mouse neonatal cardiomyocytes were treated with PT1 after OGD/R. 3-[4-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-2-oxo-3-buten-1-yl]-3-hydroxy-1,3-dihydro-2H-indol-2-one (3HOI-BA-01), a novel small compound showing potent inhibitory effect on mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation, was also tested for its cardioprotective effect, based on the established relationship between mTOR signaling and autophagy. Cell survival and autophagy-related signal pathways were examined after treatment with these agents. Our data indicate that both PT1 and 3HOI-BA-01 enhance cell survival after OGD/R. As expected, both PT1 and 3HOI-BA-01 induced autophagy in cardiomyocytes through activating AMPK pathway and inhibiting mTOR signaling, respectively. Induction of autophagy by PT1 and 3HOI-BA-01 was responsible for their cardioprotective effect, since inhibition of autophagy abolished the protective efficacy. Furthermore, simultaneous administration of PT1 and 3HOI-BA-01 profoundly upregulated autophagy after OGD/R and significantly promoted survival of cardiomyocytes. In vivo administration of PT1 and 3HOI-BA-01 in a murine myocardial (I/R injury model remarkably reduced infarct size and induced autophagy. Taken together, our research suggests that PT1 and 3HOI-BA-01 could be promising therapeutic agents for myocardial ischemia. ",

AIF translocated to the nucleus in which it colocalized with DNA fragmentation and nuclear apoptotic morphology after exposure to glutamate or OGD in cultured neurons or after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) in mice. Small inhibitory RNA-mediated downregulation of AIF reduced glutamate- and OGD-induced neuronal apoptosis by 37 and 60%, respectively (p < 0.01). Moreover, Harlequin mutant mice, which express AIF at low levels (approximately 20% of wild-type mice), displayed smaller infarct volumes (-43%; p < 0.03) and showed dramatically reduced cell death in the ischemic penumbra after 45 min of MCAo compared with wild-type littermates. Inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and Bid reduced nuclear AIF translocation. These results provide the first evidence for a causal role of AIF in ischemic neuronal cell death. Therefore, caspase-independent cell death signaling may provide a promising novel target for therapeutic interventions in cerebrovascular diseases.",

In this study, we evaluated the roles of miR-210 in hypoxia-induced insults to neural cells. Treatment of neuro-2a cells with oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD) induced cell apoptosis in a time-dependent manner. In parallel, OGD time-dependently increased cellular miR-210 levels. Knocking down miR-210 expression using specific antisenses significantly attenuated OGD-induced neural apoptosis. Concurrently, OGD increased hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α mRNA and protein syntheses. Pretreatment with YC-1, an inhibitor of HIF-1α, reduced OGD-caused cell death. Sequentially, OGD specifically decreased antiapoptotic Bcl-2 mRNA and protein levels in neuro-2a cells. A search by a bioinformatic approach revealed that miR-210-specific binding elements exist in the 3'-untranslated region of Bcl-2 mRNA. Application of miR-210 antisenses simultaneously alleviated OGD-involved inhibition of Bcl-2 mRNA expression. In comparison, overexpression of miR-210 synergistically diminished OGD-caused inhibition of Bcl-2 mRNA expression and consequently induced greater cellular insults. Taken together, this study shows that OGD can induce miR-210 expression through activating HIF-1α. And miR-210 can mediate hypoxia-induced neural apoptosis by targeting Bcl-2.",

In the presence of N-cadherin, FGF-2 caused sustained activation of the MAPK-ERK pathway, leading to MMP-9 gene transcription and cellular invasion. N-cadherin prevented the FGF receptor (FGFR) from undergoing ligand-induced internalization, resulting in increased FGFR-1 stability. Association of FGFR-1 with N-cadherin was mediated by the first two Ig-like domains of FGFR-1.

Recent studies indicate that the miRNAs within the Dlk1-Dio3 genomic region are involved in the development of liver cancer, but the role of miR-1188 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the pathway by which it exerts its function remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that miR-1188 is significantly down-regulated in mouse hepatoma cells compared with normal liver tissues. Enhanced miR-1188 suppresses cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and inhibits the tumor growth of HCC cells in vivo. Moreover, overexpressed miR-1188 promotes apoptosis, enhances caspase-3 activity, and also up-regulates the expression of Bax and p53. MiR-1188 directly targets and negatively regulates Bcl-2 and Sp1. Silencing of Bcl-2 and Sp1 exactly copies the proapoptotic and anti-invasive effects of miR-1188, respectively. The expression of apoptosis- and invasion-related genes, such as Vegfa, Fgfr1, and Rprd1b, decreases after enhancement of miR-1188, as determined by gene expression profiling analysis.

Levels of FGF2 were increased in the medium of IPH P-ECs over controls, while there was no detectable difference in TGF-beta1, PDGF-BB, or EGF levels. No difference in FGF2-induced proliferation or FGF receptor type 1 (FGFR1) mRNA levels was detected between IPH and control PA-SMCs. Knockdown of FGF2 in P-EC using siRNA reduced the PA-SMC growth-stimulating effects of IPH P-EC medium by 60% and control P-EC medium by 10%. In situ hybridization showed FGF2 overproduction predominantly in the remodeled vascular endothelium of lungs from patients with IPH. Repeated intravenous FGF2-siRNA administration abolished lung FGF2 production, both preventing and nearly reversing a rat model of PH. Similarly, pharmacological FGFR1 inhibition with SU5402 reversed established PH in the same model.

The close relationship among different FGFRs has greatly increased the difficulty in generating specific immunochemical probes. As an alternative strategy, we constructed a fusion protein comprising keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) and an IgG1 Fc domain (HFc). The chimeric molecule was efficiently secreted from transfectants as a disulfide-linked dimer that bound KGFRs with high affinity. Moreover, the KGF-HFc, like native KGF, induced DNA synthesis by epithelial cells implying normal functional receptor activation. Because it retained the convenient detection properties of an immunoglobulin, it was possible to use the KGF-HFc in ligand-mediated histochemical analysis of KGFRs. Flow cytometry revealed KGF-HFc chimera detection of the KGFR, an alternative FGFR2 product, but not FGFR1 (flg) or FGFR2 (bek). Histochemical analysis of normal skin demonstrated the specific localization of KGFRs within the spinous layer, a zone of epithelial cell differentiation. KGFRs were also localized to epithelial cells within a specific region of the hair follicle, and they were not detectable in cells of the sweat gland. Tissue sections of soft palate and tonsil, two examples of nonkeratinizing epithelium, revealed staining of stratum spinosum and some staining of the basal cell layer as well. Neither salivary gland epithelium nor lymphoid cells were positive. The ciliated epithelium of the trachea exhibited KGFR expression in intermediate and basal cell layers. In striking contrast to the normal pattern of staining in the adjacent epithelium, a squamous cell carcinoma of skin lacked detectable KGFRs. Our present findings suggest that growth factor-Ig fusion proteins may be generally applicable in ligand-mediated histochemical detection and localization of growth factor receptors.",

In H9c2 cardiomyocytes, non-cytotoxic perifosine (0.1-0.5 μM) suppressed OGD/re-oxygenation-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, p53 mitochondrial translocation and cyclophilin D complexation, as well as mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) reduction. Molecularly, perifosine activated AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) signaling to increase intracellular NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) content in H9c2 cells. On the other hand, AMPK inhibition by AMPKα1 shRNA-knockdown in H9c2 cells significantly reduced perifosine-induced NADPH production, and alleviated perifosine-mediated anti-oxidant and cytoprotective activities against OGD/re-oxygenation. In primary murine cardiomyocytes, perifosine similarly activated AMPK signaling, and offered significant protection against OGD/re-oxygenation, which was largely attenuated with siRNA knockdown of AMPKα1. We demonstrate an unexpected function of perifosine (low-concentration) in protecting cardiomyocytes from OGD/re-oxygenation. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"In cerebral ischemia, studies of cell death have focused primarily on neurons, but recent work indicates that ischemia also causes damage to astrocytes. Activation of astrocytes is a typical brain response to stress stimuli and is evidenced by changes in cellular function and morphology, as well as upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein. The tumor-suppressor transcription factor p53 has recently been implicated as a mediator of ischemia-induced neuronal death, but very little is known about its role in the activation or the death of astrocytes. The present study investigated the role of p53 in astrocyte and neuronal toxicity using in-vitro and in-vivo ischemic stroke models. We showed that p53 is activated in ischemic brains and in oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced cell death in neurons and astrocytes. Inhibition of p53 activity using either pifithrin-α or small interference RNA interference reduced OGD-induced cell death and pifithrin-α reversed OGD-induced impairment of glutamate uptake in astrocytes, suggesting that p53 might play a key role in mediating neurotoxicity and gliotoxicity in ischemic brain injury. This study shows that p53 is activated in astrocytes during ischemia and that inhibition of the activity of this molecule prevents not only OGD-induced neuronal and astrocytic death but also astrocyte activation and impaired glutamate uptake. These findings suggest that p53 may be a valuable therapeutic target in ischemic brain injury. ",

We demonstrated that K6PC-5 increased intracellular sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) content and remarkably inhibited OGD/reoxygenation-induced death of myocardial cells (H9c2/HL-1 lines and primary murine myocardiocytes). SphK1 inhibitors, B-5354c and SKI-II, or SphK1-siRNA knockdown not only aggregated OGD/reoxygenation-induced cytotoxicity but also nullified the cytoprotection by K6PC-5. On the other hand, overexpression of SphK1 alleviated H9c2 cell death by OGD/reoxygenation, and K6PC-5-mediated cytoprotection was also enhanced in SphK1 overexpressed cells. Molecularly, OGD/reoxygenation activated the mitochondrial death pathway, evidenced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial membrane potential reduction, and p53-cyclophilin D (Cyp-D) association, which were all alleviated by K6PC-5 or overexpression of SphK1, but exacerbated by SphK1 knockdown. Furthermore, OGD/reoxygenation induced prodeath ceramide production in myocardial cells, which was largely suppressed by K6PC-5. In the meantime, adding a cell-permeable short-chain ceramide (C6) mimicked OGD/reoxygenation actions and induced ROS production and the mitochondrial death pathway in myocardial cells. Together, we conclude that K6PC-5 inhibits OGD/reoxygenation-induced myocardial cell death probably through activating SphK1. The results of the study indicate a potential benefit of K6PC-5 on ischemic heart disease. ",

Four-h OGD was induced by OGD by using a specialized and humidified chamber. To initiate OGD, culture medium was replaced with de-oxygenated and glucose-free extracellular solution-Locke's medium. After OGD treatment for 4 h, cells were then allowed to recover for 6 h or 20 h. Then lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay, Western blotting and flow cytometry were used to detect cell death, protein levels and apoptotic cells, respectively. For the PostC treatment, three cycles of 15-min OGD, followed by 15 min normal cultivation, were applied immediately after injurious 4-h OGD. Cells were then allowed to recover for 6 h or 20 h, and cell death was assessed by LDH release assay. Apoptotic cells were flow cytometrically evaluated after 4-h OGD, followed by re-oxygenation for 20 h (O4/R20). In addition, Western blotting was used to examine the expression of heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70), Bcl-2 and Bax. The ratio of Bcl-2 expression was (0.44±0.08)% and (0.76±0.10)%, and that of Bax expression was (0.51±0.05)% and (0.39±0.04)%, and that of HSP70 was (0.42±0.031)% and (0.72±0.045)% respectively in OGD group and PostC group. After O4/R6, the rate of neuron death in PostC group and OGD groups was (28.96±3.03)% and (37.02±4.47)%, respectively. Therefore, the PostC treatment could up-regulate the expression of HSP70 and Bcl-2, but down-regulate Bax expression. As compared with OGD group, OGD-induced neuron death and apoptosis were significantly decreased in PostC group (P<0.05). These findings suggest that PostC inhibited OGD-induced neuron death. This neuro-protective effect is likely achieved by anti-apoptotic mechanisms and is associated with over-expression of HSP70. ",

Although several FGF receptors (FGFRs) are expressed in the early embryo, their respective role in these processes remains poorly understood. We provide evidence that FGFR-1 and FGFR-4 signals elicit distinct responses both in naive and neuralized ectodermal cells. We show that naive ectodermal cells expressing a constitutively active chimeric torso-FGFR-1 (t-R1) are converted into mesoderm in a Ras-dependent manner, while those expressing torso-FGFR-4 (t-R4) differentiate into epidermis without significant activation of Erk-1. In neuralized ectoderm, expression of t-R4 causes the up-regulation of the midbrain markers En-2 and Wnt-1, but not of the hindbrain nor the spinal cord markers Krox20 and Hoxb9. Mutation of tyr(776) in the phospholipase C-(gamma) binding consensus sequence YLDL of t-R4 completely abolishes En-2 and Wnt-1 induction. In contrast to t-R4, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF)-dependent FGFR-1 activation in neuralized ectodermal cells expressing a chimeric PDGFR-FGFR-1 receptor results in the expression of Krox20 and Hoxb9. A similar effect is observed when an inducible form of oncogenic Raf is expressed, therefore implicating FGFR-1 and Raf in the transduction of FGF-caudalizing signals in neural tissue. Our results suggest that FGFR-1 and FGFR-4 transduce distinct signals in embryonic cells, and mainly differ in their ability to activate the Ras/MAPK pathway.",

RT-PCR analysis revealed expression of both the ligand bFGF and the FGF receptors, FGFR-1, FGFR-2, FGFR-3 and FGFR-4, in myoblasts and rhabdomyosarcomas; with FGFR-3 at comparably lower levels of detection. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeted against the translation start site and splice-donor acceptor sites of human bFGF and FGFR-1 did not exert proliferation-inhibitory effects in either cell type. Thus, unlike previous studies which demonstrated the importance of bFGF and FGFR-1 as major contributors in sustaining,the proliferation of normal and malignant cells of neuroectodermal origin, the data presented here, indicate that cells of mesenchymal origin may rely on additional, if not altogether different, growth factors and growth factor receptors for their proliferation.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Ischemic brain injury is widely modeled in vitro with paradigms of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), which leads to cell death. The prevention and attenuation of brain injury by the tetracycline antibiotic minocycline has been attributed largely to suppression of microglial activation, but its benefits in oligodendrocyte cells have not been well characterized. Using primary cultures of rat oligodendroglial precursor cells (OPC) exposed to OGD, we investigated the direct effects of minocycline on the survival, proliferation, and maturation of oligodendroglial lineage cells. OGD for 2 hr caused a decrease in the total number of OPC and the amount of proliferating progenitors by 50%, which was attenuated by inclusion of minocycline. The reduced numbers of immature oligodendroglial cells at 72 hr and of mature oligodendrocytes at 120 hr after OGD were partially restored by minocycline. In OPC, OGD caused an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and production of TUNEL-positive cell numbers, which was abolished by minocycline. Minocycline preferentially increased the expression of superoxide dismutase under OGD but not in control OPC. Minocycline also prevented the OGD-induced downregulation of the transcription factors Sox10 and Olig2 and of myelin-specific genes 2'3' cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (CNP) and myelin basic protein (MBP) in response to OGD. These studies demonstrate direct protective actions of minocycline on oligodendroglial-lineage cells, suggesting potential benefit in white matter injury involving OGD.",

While FGF-2 induces fibrosis, the role of FGF-1 in inflammation and fibrosis is less defined. We examined the expression of FGF-1 and FGF receptor (FGFR-1) to determine if renal diseases with varying etiologies of inflammation, including lupus nephritis (LN), acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) and acute rejection superimposed on chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN), showed varying patterns of expression. We also examined the expression of fibroblast-specific protein-1 (FSP-1), which has been linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and fibrosis, to determine whether it was linked to potential profibrotic and inflammatory FGF-1 mechanisms.;Proliferative LN (PLN) (N= 12), nonproliferative lupus nephritis (NPLN) (N= 5), AIN (N= 6), CAN (N= 4), and normal kidneys (N= 3) were studied. FGF, FGFR-1, and FSP-1 were localized by immunohistochemistry, and intensity scored on a 0 to 3+ scale. Double staining with CD68 and separate immunohistochemical staining for CD4 and CD8 with serial sections analysis were done to identify if T lymphocytes or macrophages showed staining for FGF-1 and FGFR-1 or FSP-1.;In normal kidneys, FGF-1 was expressed in mesangial cells (0.67 +/- 0.58), glomerular endothelial (0.67 +/- 0.58), visceral, and parietal epithelial cells (1.67 +/- 0.58). FGFR-1 showed a similar pattern of staining but also was expressed in tubular epithelium, and arterial endothelium and smooth muscle. Expression of FGF-1 was increased over normal in glomerular parenchymal cells only in CAN in podocytes (2.30 +/- 0.58 vs. 3.00 +/- 0.00) (P < 0.05) and parietal epithelial cells (1.67 +/- 0.58 vs. 2.25 +/- 0.50) (P < 0.05). Infiltrating glomerular and interstitial inflammatory cells in diseased glomeruli also expressed FGF-1 and FGFR-1. Tubular cells expressed slightly increased FGFR-1 in renal diseases vs. normal, whereas tubules remained negative for FGF-1 in diseased kidneys. FSP-1 expression was prominent in the interstitium in all kidneys with interstitial inflammation, and most prominent in CAN. Interstitial FSP-1+ cells were consistent with a myofibroblast-type morphology, and did not stain with CD-68. FSP-1 expression was closely associated with inflammatory cells expressing FGF-1 and FGFR-1. FSP-1 also showed positivity within crescents and occasional podocytes in PLN.;The expression of FGF-1 and FGFR-1 in infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages, and of FGFR-1 in tubules, is supportive, but does not prove causality, of the possibility that FGF-1 might have both autocrine and paracrine functions in renal inflammation. However, the initial stimulus for renal inflammation, whether immune complex, hypersensitivity or rejection, did not alter expression patterns of FGF-1 or its receptor. The colocalization of inflammatory infiltrates with interstitial fibrosis supports the possibility of a contribution of FGF-1 for chemotaxis and associated fibrosis, further supported by interstitial FSP-1 expression closely associated with these inflammatory cells expressing FGF-1 and FGFR-1.",

However, there is a paucity of literature describing the duration of OGD (and reoxygenation [RO]) required to best simulate BBB disruption in vivo. In this study we assessed BBB disruption in bEnd.3 cells after exposure to a range of OGD periods, and also after OGD + RO. Exposure of bEnd.3 monolayers to 4, 6, 16, or 24 hours of OGD resulted in a significant increase in permeability. The hyperpermeability after 16 or 24 hours was associated with decreased expression of tight junction proteins (occludin and claudin-5). Furthermore, there was a decrease in cell viability and increased expression of the pro-apoptotic protein, cleaved caspase-3. Exposure of bEnd.3 monolayers to 1 hour OGD+ 23 hours RO exacerbated hyperpermeability relative to 1 hour OGD, which was associated with decreased expression levels of occludin and ZO-1, but no change in cell viability or caspase-3. 4 hours OGD + 23 hours RO exacerbated hyperpermeability, decreased expression levels of tight junction proteins, decreased cell viability, and increased caspase-3 expression. Thus, bEnd.3 cells exhibit hyperpermeability, a loss of tight junction proteins, and undergo cell death, after exposure to prolonged periods of OGD. Moreover, they exhibit exacerbated hyperpermeability, a loss of tight junction proteins, and increased expression of caspase-3 after OGD + RO. These findings will facilitate the use of this cell line in studies of BBB disruption and for the testing of therapeutics. ",

Previous studies indicate that pranlukast reduces ischemic tissue injury partially through decreasing vascular permeability, but its effect on ischemic injury in endothelial cells is not known. Thus, in this study, we investigated the effect of pranlukast on ischemia-like injury induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in EA.hy926 cells, a human endothelial cell line, and the possible mechanisms. We found that cell viability was reduced, lactate dehydrogenase release was increased 4-8 hours after OGD, and necrosis was induced 8 hours after OGD. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased by 211%, 176%, and 128%, respectively, 0.5, 1, and 2 hours after OGD. Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) was translocated to the nuclei 4-8 hours after OGD. Pranlukast ameliorated the reduced viability, the increased lactate dehydrogenase release, and necrosis after OGD. It also reduced ROS production and inhibited NF-kappaB nuclear translocation after OGD. The ROS scavenger, edaravone, inhibited OGD-induced nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB as well. Edaravone and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (a specific NF-kappaB inhibitor) protected endothelial cells from the OGD-induced injury. However, zileuton, a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, did not affect the cell injury, ROS production, and NF-kappaB nuclear translocation after OGD. The exogenous leukotriene D4 did not induce cell injury, ROS production, and NF-kappaB translocation. Thus, we conclude that pranlukast protects endothelial cells from ischemia-like injury via decreasing ROS production and inhibiting NF-kappaB activation, which is leukotriene independent.",

Previous research has shown that oxidative stress, a result of excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), relates to pathophysiology of ischemic stroke, and causes oxidative damage to biomolecules, eventually leading to programmed cell death. Meanwhile, apigenin has been shown to exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer properties and neuroprotective action. Hence, this study was to investigate the potential mechanisms underlying the neural protection of apigenin on oxygen and glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) induced neuronal injury in differentiated PC12 cells. Cells were pretreated with apigenin for 6 h, and then subjected to OGD for 12 h followed by reperfusion for 24 h. The results showed that OGD/R significantly decreased cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, mRNA levels of antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes and Nrf2 protein expression, while elevated the release of LDH, cell apoptosis, intracellular ROS level, P53 protein expression and upregulated its downstream genes in PC12 cells. However, apigenin effectively inhibited these undesirable changes induced by OGD/R. Our findings demonstrate that this compound attenuates OGD/R induced neuronal injury mainly by virtue of its anti-apoptosis and antioxidative properties via affecting the expression of Nrf2 and P53, and their downstream target gene transcription.",

However, acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-1)-induced signaling renders some cells more sensitive and others resistant to the cytotoxic effects of ONOO(-). To determine whether alternatively spliced fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR-1) isoforms are responsible for this differential response, we have stably transfected FGFR-negative rat brain-derived resistant vessel endothelial cells (RVEC) with human cDNA sequences encoding either FGFR-1 alpha or FGFR-1 beta. FGF-1 treatment of RVEC(R-1 alpha) transfectants enhanced ONOO(-)-mediated cell death in a manner dependent upon FGFR-1 tyrosine kinase, MEK/Erk 1/2 kinase, and p38 MAP kinase activities and independent of Src-family kinase (SFK) activity. FGF-1 treatment of RVEC(R-1 beta) transfectants inhibited the cytotoxic effects of ONOO(-) in a manner dependent upon FGFR-1 tyrosine kinase, MEK/Erk 1/2 kinase, and SFK activities and independent of p38 MAP kinase activity. FGF-1-induced preactivation of both FGFR-1 tyrosine and Erk 1/2 kinases was detected in both RVEC(R-1 alpha) and RVEC(R-1 beta) transfectants. FGF-1-induced preactivation of p38 MAPK was restricted to RVEC(R-1 alpha) transfectants, whereas, ligand-induced preactivation of SFK was limited to RVEC(R-1 beta) transfectants. Collectively, these results both reemphasize the role of extracellular trophic factors and their receptor-mediated signaling pathways during cellular responses to oxidant stress and provide a first indication that the alternatively spliced FGFR-1 isoforms induce differential signal transduction pathways.",

We investigated the actions of PGE(2) on microvascular endothelial cells (capillary venular endothelial cells) with the purpose of delineating the signaling pathway leading to the acquisition of the angiogenic phenotype and to new vessel formation. PGE(2) (100 nM) produced activation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR-1), as measured by its phosphorylation, but not of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2. PGE(2) stimulated the EP3 subtype receptor, as deduced by abrogation of EP3 Galpha(i) subunit activity through pertussis toxin. Consistent with this result, in human umbilical venular endothelial cells missing the EP3 receptor, PGE(2) did not phosphorylate FGFR-1. Upon binding to its receptor, PGE(2) initiated an autocrine/paracrine signaling cascade involving the intracellular activation of c-Src, activation of matrix metalloproteinase (predominantly MMP2), which in turn caused the mobilization of membrane-anchored fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). In fact, in cells unable to release FGF-2 the transfection with both FGFR-1 and EP3 did not result in FGFR-1 phosphorylation in response to PGE(2). Relevance for the FGF2-FGFR-1 system was highlighted by confocal analysis, showing receptor internalization after cell exposure to the prostanoid. ERK1/2 appeared to be the distal signal involved, its phosphorylation being sensitive to either cSrc inhibitor or FGFR-1 blocker. Finally, PGE(2) stimulated cell migration and capillary formation in aortic rings, which were severely reduced by inhibitors of signaling molecules or by receptor antagonist. In conclusion, this study provides evidence for the involvement of FGFR-1 through FGF2 in eliciting PGE(2) angiogenic responses. This signaling pattern is similar to the autocrine-paracrine mechanism which operates in endothelial cells to support neovascular growth.",

To explore the precise mechanism, the present study further evaluated effects of piracetam on Oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced neuronal damage in rat primary cortical cells. The addition of piracetam to the cultured cells 12 h before OGD for 4 h significantly reduced neuronal damage as determined by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay and lactate dehydrogenase release experiments. Piracetam also lowered the levels of malondialdehyde, nitrogen monoxidum, and xanthine oxidase which was increased in the OGD cells, and enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, which were decreased in the OGD cells. We also demonstrated that piracetam could decrease glutamate and aspartate release when cortical cells were subjected to OGD. Furthermore, Western blot study demonstrated that piracetam attenuated the increased expression of P53 and BAX protein in OGD cells.

The different receptors were characterized and found to be functional as ligand-stimulatable kinases, after expression of the respective human cDNAs in porcine aortic endothelial cells. Substrates for the receptors were analyzed by ligand stimulation of [32P]orthophosphate-labeled cells and immunoprecipitation with phosphotyrosine antiserum. A number of phosphoproteins were induced in all the different types of cells, but components specifically induced after stimulation of FGFR-1 and PDGFR-beta expressing cells could also be detected. Examination of receptor-associated substrates by in vitro kinase assays revealed phosphoproteins of 65 and 85 kDa, which were associated with PDGFR-beta and FGFRchim, but not with FGFR-1. The 85-kDa phosphoprotein could correspond to the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase (PI3-K), since phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase activity was detected after ligand stimulation of FGFRchim- and PDGFR-beta- but not FGFR-1-expressing cells. In addition, ligand stimulation of FGFRchim- and PDGFR-beta-expressing cells, but not FGFR-1-expressing cells, led to induction of actin reorganization in the form of circular membrane ruffling. Thus, replacement of a discrete segment of the intracellular domain of the FGFR-1 with the corresponding stretch from the PDGFR-beta resulted in transfer of PDGFR-beta-specific signaling properties to the chimeric molecule.",

In this receptor (FGFR-1L) portions of the second and third immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domains are deleted. To determine whether FGFR-1L was functional, full-length variant (pSV/FGFR-1L) and wild-type (pSV/FGFR-1) receptors were stably transfected into rat L6 myoblasts cells. Transfected L6 clones expressed respective proteins and bound (125)I-labeled FGF-2 with K(d) values of 99 pm (FGFR-1) and 26 pm (FGFR-1L). FGF-1 and FGF-2 competed efficiently with (125)I-FGF-2 for binding to FGFR-1 and FGFR-1L, whereas FGF-4 was less efficient. FGF-1, FGF-2, and FGF-4 enhanced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity, increased steady-state c-fos mRNA levels, and stimulated proliferation through either receptor, whereas KGF was without effect. FGFR-1 expressing clones exhibited ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 (FRS2), a 90-kDa adaptor protein that links FGFR-1 activation to the MAPK cascade. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS2 was not evident with FGFR-1L. In addition, phospholipase C-gamma was not tyrosine phosphorylated via activated FGFR-1L. These findings indicate that FGFR-1L binds FGF-1 and FGF-2 with high affinity and is capable of mitogenic signaling, but may activate MAPK to occur via non-classical signaling intermediates.",

Here, FGF signaling network, cancer genetics/genomics of FGF receptors (FGFRs), and FGFR-targeted therapeutics will be reviewed. FGF signaling to RAS-MAPK branch and canonical WNT signaling cascade mutually regulate transcription programming. FGF signaling to PI3K-AKT branch and Hedgehog, Notch, TGFβ, and noncanonical WNT signaling cascades regulate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion. Gene amplification of FGFR1 occurs in lung cancer and estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, and that of FGFR2 in diffuse-type gastric cancer and triple-negative breast cancer. Chromosomal translocation of FGFR1 occurs in the 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, as with FGFR3 in multiple myeloma and peripheral T-cell lymphoma. FGFR1 and FGFR3 genes are fused to neighboring TACC1 and TACC3 genes, respectively, due to interstitial deletions in glioblastoma multiforme. Missense mutations of FGFR2 are found in endometrial uterine cancer and melanoma, and similar FGFR3 mutations in invasive bladder tumors, and FGFR4 mutations in rhabdomyosarcoma. Dovitinib, Ki23057, ponatinib, and AZD4547 are orally bioavailable FGFR inhibitors, which have demonstrated striking effects in preclinical model experiments. Dovitinib, ponatinib, and AZD4547 are currently in clinical trial as anticancer drugs. Because there are multiple mechanisms of actions for FGFR inhibitors to overcome drug resistance, FGFR-targeted therapy is a promising strategy for the treatment of refractory cancer. Whole exome/transcriptome sequencing will be introduced to the clinical laboratory as the companion diagnostic platform facilitating patient selection for FGFR-targeted therapeutics in the era of personalized medicine.

In order to elucidate the mechanisms underlying osteoblast/preosteoclast cell interactions, we developed an in vitro model of co-cultured human clonal cell lines of osteoclast precursors (FLG 29.1) and osteoblastic cells (Saos-2), and evaluated the migratory, adhesive, cytochemical, morphological, and biochemical properties of the co-cultured cells. In Boyden chemotactic chambers, FLG 29.1 cells exhibited a marked migratory response toward the Saos-2 cells. Moreover, they preferentially adhered to the osteoblastic monolayer. Direct co-culture of the two cell types induced: (1) positive staining for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase in FLG 29.1 cells; (2) a decrease of the alkaline phosphatase activity expressed by Saos-2 cells; (3) the appearance of typical ultrastructural features of mature osteoclasts in FLG 29.1 cells; (4) the release into the culture medium of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor. The addition of parathyroid hormone to the co-culture further potentiated the differentiation of the preosteoclasts, the cells tending to fuse into large multinucleated elements.

Moreover, the combination strategy also demonstrated synergistic indices against tumour growth and angiogenesis. Furthermore, auto-antibodies against mouse FGFR-1 were identified.

Expression of bFGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) from small yellow follicles was determined by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. The FGFR1 protein and mRNA were intensively expressed in the granulosa layer. After 8- to 24-h treatment with bFGF (0.1-100 ng/ml), the proliferation of cultured granulosa cells was remarkably enhanced in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The FGFR1 antagonist SU5402 inhibited bFGF-induced cell proliferation. This stimulating effect was further confirmed by 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine incorporation and terminal transferase dUTP nick end-labelling assay. Immunocytochemistry of protein kinases A (PKA) and C (PKC) showed that the pro-proliferation action of bFGF predominantly activated PKC expression. Meanwhile, the bFGF-induced cell proliferation was significantly promoted by PKC activator PMA and inhibited by PKC inhibitor H(7) (p < 0.05). In addition, the bFGF-elicited cell proliferation was accompanied with increased mRNA expression of the cell cycle-regulating genes including cyclins D1 and E1, cyclin-dependent kinases 2 and 6.

Therefore, we investigated the cardioprotective effects of moderate TH on oxygen-glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation (OGD/R)-induced injury in HL-1 cardiomyocytes.;Cardiac OGD/R injury was induced by exposing HL-1 cardiomyocytes to 0.2% oxygen in serum/glucose-free medium for 6h. OGD injured cells were subsequently re-oxygenated with 21% oxygen in complete medium. Two hypothermic protocols were investigated: Post-OGD cooling to 33.5°C for 24 h initiated at the start of re-oxygenation and intra-OGD cooling to 33.5°C for 24 h initiated after 3 h of OGD and maintained throughout the re-oxygenation phase. Cell viability was determined by LDH and cTnT releases. Mitochondria dysfunction was evaluated by intracellular ATP content and cellular metabolic activity was accessed by MTT reduction. Activation of caspase 3 was analyzed by Western blot.;OGD/R-induced injury resulted in increased cell death (higher LDH and cTnT releases), mitochondrial impairment (decreased ATP content), and decreased cellular metabolic activity (decreased MTT reduction). Only intra-OGD cooling attenuated both OGD and OGD-R-induced injuries (significantly decreased LDH and cTnT releases and increased ATP contents and MTT reduction). Furthermore, caspase 3 activation was abated by intra-OGD cooling. No protective effects were observed by post-OGD cooling.;Moderate TH initiated during OGD is a promising intervention for the protection of cardiomyocytes from OGD/R-induced injury. The attenuation of mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis by intra-OGD cooling are beneficial effects of hypothermia-induced cardioprotection, resulting in minimized myocardial cell death after OGD and OGD-R-induced injuries.",

To test the hypothesis that bFGF may play a role in human ovarian cancer cell growth, three ovarian cancer cell lines, A90, A121(P), and A121(A), were investigated for their ability to respond to bFGF as a mitogen, to express endogenous bFGF protein or message for FGF proteins, and to exhibit FGF receptor or its message. Addition of bFGF to cultures of all three cell lines maintained in chemically defined media resulted in a statistically significant increase in cell number. Cell extracts from A90, A121(P), and A121(A) contained an immunoreactive protein that comigrated with hr-bFGF by Western blot analysis. Several bands of higher molecular weight were also noted. Immunohistochemical staining for bFGF demonstrated a cytoplasmic distribution of bFGF in the three cell lines. Both high- and low-affinity binding sites for human recombinant bFGF (hr-bFGF) were expressed by all three lines. High-affinity sites varied from 2700 sites per cell (Kd = 29 pM) to 13,500 sites per cell (Kd = 71 pM). All three cell lines were screened for mRNA expression for seven FGF proteins and four FGF receptors. In all three lines, mRNA for FGF2 (bFGF) was detected by PCR analysis, and in two lines, mRNA for FGF1 (aFGF) and FGF5 were also found. The FGFR1 receptor subtype (flg) was common to all of the cell lines. Finally, suramin inhibited proliferation of A90 and A121 (P and A) with IC50's of 60 and 210 micrograms/ml, respectively. This is consistent with the A90 cell line having higher levels of endogenous bFGF and flg and therefore being more responsive to suramin inhibition than the A121 cell line. The results indicate that these ovarian cancer cell lines can produce bFGF as well as other members of the FGF family of genes and have the ability to respond to bFGF.",

However, experimental evidence also shows that ebselen causes cell death in several different cell types. Whether ebselen will have a beneficial or detrimental effect on cells under ischemic condition is not known. Herein, we studied the effect of ebselen on C6 glioma cells under oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), an in vitro ischemic model. We found that ebselen significantly enhanced cell death after 3 h of OGD as observed by lactase dehydrogenase (LDH) release and cellular morphological changes. Further studies revealed that depletion of cellular glutathione level by the combined action of ebselen and OGD played a role in enhanced cell death as demonstrated by the following evidence: (1) cellular GSH was significantly depleted by the combined effort of ebselen and OGD, compared to that of ebselen or OGD insult alone; (2) exogenous addition of N-acetyl cysteine completely diminished the cell damage induced by ebselen and OGD; (3) supplement of glucose, which provides cellular reducing agents and thus maintains cellular GSH level, to the OGD medium diminished C6 cell damage induced by ebselen. We conclude that depleting cellular glutathione plays an important role in ebselen-induced cell death with OGD.

Recently, we demonstrated that the human pre-osteoclastic cell line FLG 29.1 bears functional estrogen receptors. In this study we examined FLG 29.1 cells for the presence of cell surface binding sites for 17betaE2, and whether 17betaE2 could elicit cell signalling.

Stimulation of FLG 29.1 cells with low (1 nM) and high (1 microM) doses of 17betaE2 induced a prompt and significant (P < 0.05) increase of cellular pH, as measured in single cells using an image analysis system. In addition, both cAMP and cGMP were significantly increased by 17betaE2 with a dose-dependent response. Finally, a rapid increase of intracellular calcium ion concentration [Ca2+] was also induced by 1 nM 17betaE2, as measured in single cells using an image analysis system. Our findings strongly suggest a non-genomic action of 17betaE2 on osteoclast precursors.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The human hepatic Asialoglycoprotein Receptor (ASGP-R) consists of two different types of liver specific membrane glycoproteins that bind to terminal galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine residues of serum glycoproteins. The two different polypeptide chains are referred to as two receptor subunits, HH1 and HH2, which are both involved in the activity of the functional receptor. This receptor has served as a model for understanding receptor-mediated endocytosis and carbohydrate mediated recognition phenomena. Here models for the C-terminal extracellular region of both HH1 and HH2 subunit are presented. The standard homology building procedure was modified in order to make it suitable for the modeling problem at hand. The models for the extracellular regions of HH1 and HH2 were initially constructed by exploiting several fragments, belonging to proteins of known 3D structure, and showing high local sequence similarity with respect to the glycoproteins of interest. Putative binding sites were first hypothesized on the basis of the comparison with other complexes of lectins, the crystal structure of which was available in the Protein Data Bank. A model for the complex involving the HH2 subunit and the typical high affinity ligand N-acetylgalactosamine (NacGal) was refined as the first by a suitable combination of MD simulations and Energy Minimization calculations, since it seemed to quickly converge to a plausible structure. An intermediate model for HH1 was then rebuilt on the basis of the refined model for HH2. It was then submitted to a sequence of molecular dynamics simulations with templates which took into account the secondary structure prediction for a final refinement. The structures of small regions of the models, located around the binding sites, were compared with more recent crystallographic data regarding a complex involving the mutant of Mannose Binding Protein QPDWGH (1BCH entry in the Protein Data Bank) and NacGal. This mutant shows high local sequence similarity with HH1 and HH2 at the binding sites. On the basis of the above comparison, different locations of the binding sites were also considered. In addition to other expected interactions, two hydrophobic interactions were observed in the models with Trp residues (positions 243 in HH1 and 181 or 267 in HH2 respectively) and His residues (positions 256 in HHI and 184 in HH2.respectively). The quality of the models was evaluated by the Procheck program and they seemed plausible. This observation together with analogies found between binding sites of the models and IBCH supported the validity of the models. A further validation element arose by comparison between experimental binding data available in the literature about the homologous rat receptor subunits and theoretical interaction energies evaluated, by means of the DOCK 3.5 program, in models for the rat subunits obtained from the corresponding human ones. The new modeling procedure used here appears to be a well-suited method for structural analysis of small regions, located around the ligands, in proteins of unknown 3D structure.",

We have also reported that exogenous TK administration can suppress glutamate- or acidosis-induced neurotoxicity through the extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway. To further explore the neuroprotection mechanisms of TK, in the present study we performed immunoprecipitation analysis and identified a scaffolding protein Homer1b/c using MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Here, we tested the hypothesis that TK reduces cell injury induced by oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) through activating Homer1b/c. We found that TK increased the expression of Homer1b/c in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, TK facilitated the translocation of Homer1b/c to the plasma membrane under OGD/R condition by confocal microscope assays. We also observed that overexpression of Homer1b/c showed the neuroprotection against OGD/R-induced cell injury by enhancing cell survival, reducing LDH release, caspase-3 activity and cell apoptosis. However, the knockdown of Homer1b/c by small interfering RNA showed the opposite effects, indicating that Homer1b/c had protective effects against OGD/R-induced neuronal injury. More interestingly, TK exerted its much more significantly neuroprotective effects after Homer1b/c overexpression, whereas it exerted its reduced effects after Homer1b/c knockdown. In addition, TK pretreatment increased the phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 and Akt-GSK3β through Homer1b/c activation. The beneficial effects of Homer1b/c were abolished by the ERK1/2 or PI3K antagonist. Therefore, we propose novel signaling mechanisms involved in the anti-hypoxic function of TK through activation of Homer1b/c-ERK1/2 and Homer1b/c-PI3K-Akt signaling pathways.",

Alizarin red staining indicating calcium deposition was observed in the cornu ammonis (CA)1 and dentate gyrus regions in control hippocampal slices despite no specific labeling for cell death markers. Electron microscopy using the osmium/potassium dichromate method revealed scattered degenerated cells throughout the normally appearing CA1 region. They contained electron-dense precipitates within mitochondria, and electron probe microanalysis confirmed that they were calcifying mitochondria. Selective calcium deposition was noted within, but not beyond, mitochondria in these mineralized cells. They showed ultrastructural features of non-necrotic, non-apoptotic cell death and retained their compact ultrastructure, even after the majority of mitochondria were calcified. Unexpectedly, no intracellular calcification was noted in necrotic CA1 pyramidal cells after OGD, and there was no progression of calcification in OGD-lesioned slices. In addition, mineralized cells in both control and OGD-lesioned slices were closely associated with or completely engulfed by astrocytes but not microglia. These astrocytes were laden with heterogeneous cytoplasmic inclusions that appeared to be related with their phagocytic activity. These data demonstrate that microcalcification specifically associated with mitochondria might lead to a novel type of cell death and suggest that astrocytes may be involved in the phagocytosis of these mineralized cells and possibly in the regulation of ectopic calcification.",

However, accumulated evidence indicates that VHL may play additional roles in other cellular functions. We report here a novel hypoxia-inducible factor-independent function of VHL in cell motility control via regulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) endocytosis. In VHL null tumor cells or VHL knock-down cells, FGFR1 internalization is defective, leading to surface accumulation and abnormal activation of FGFR1. The enhanced FGFR1 activity directly correlates with increased cell migration. VHL disease mutants, in two of the mutation hot spots favoring development of renal cell carcinoma, failed to rescue the above phenotype. Interestingly, surface accumulation of the chemotactic receptor appears to be selective in VHL mutant cells, since other surface proteins such as epidermal growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, IGFR1, and c-Met are not affected. We demonstrate that 1) FGFR1 endocytosis is defective in the VHL mutant and is rescued by reexpression of wild-type VHL, 2) VHL is recruited to FGFR1-containing, but not EGFR-containing, endosomal vesicles, 3) VHL exhibits a functional relationship with Rab5a and dynamin 2 in FGFR1 internalization, and 4) the endocytic function of VHL is mediated through the metastasis suppressor Nm23, a protein known to regulate dynamin-dependent endocytosis.",

Cultured cortical neurons preconditioned by sublethal oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD) were less vulnerable to severe OGD than non-preconditioned neurons. Preconditioned neurons maintained elevated SUMO-1 conjugation levels (and, to a lesser extent those of SUMO-2/3) on western blots in contrast to non-preconditioned cells. Further, cortical neurons and SHSY5Y cells in which transfected SUMO-1 or SUMO-2 were over-expressed showed increased survival after severe OGD. In contrast, cell cultures subjected to depletion of endogenous SUMO-1 protein by RNAi had reduced survival after exposure to this form of in vitro ischemia and an attenuated protective response to preconditioning.

FGFR1-4 and FGFRL1 transcripts as well as IIIb/IIIc splice variants of FGFR1-3 were evaluated in 3 canine- and 6 human sarcoma cell lines and 19 spontaneous canine sarcomas by SYBRqPCR. FGFR1 protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Growth inhibitory effects of FGFR1 inhibitor PD166866 and dominant negative recombinant FGFR adenoviral expression constructs (dnFGFR) on tumor cell lines were analyzed. Profiling of multiple FGFR transcripts detected comparable co-expression in most of human and canine sarcoma cell lines and canine tumor specimens. This indicates existence of closely related regulation mechanisms for FGFR expression in sarcomas of both species. FGFR1 with splice variant IIIc was consistently expressed with highest transcript levels. In 88% of the spontaneous tumor samples a heterogeneous FGFR1 protein expression was observed. Significant growth inhibition and cell death was seen after infection with dnFGFR1 in canine and human sarcoma cells, but not with dnFGFR3 and 4.

However, this protective \"preconditioning\" response to isoflurane is specific to males, with females showing an increase in brain damage following isoflurane preconditioning and subsequent focal cerebral ischemia. Innate cell sex is emerging as an important player in neuronal cell death, but its role in the sexually dimorphic response to isoflurane preconditioning has not been investigated. We used an in vitro model of isoflurane preconditioning and ischemia (oxygen and glucose deprivation, OGD) to test the hypotheses that innate cell sex dictates the response to isoflurane preconditioning and that 17β-estradiol attenuates any protective effect from isoflurane preconditioning in neurons via nuclear estrogen receptors. Sex-segregated neuron cultures derived from postnatal day 0-1 mice were exposed to either 0% or 3% isoflurane preconditioning for 1 h. In separate experiments, 17β-estradiol and the non-selective estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 were added 24 h before preconditioning and then removed at the end of the preconditioning period. Twenty-three hours after preconditioning, all cultures underwent 2 h of OGD. Twenty-four hours following OGD, cell viability was quantified using calcein-AM fluorescence. We observed that isoflurane preconditioning increased cell survival following subsequent OGD regardless of innate cell sex, but that the presence of 17β-estradiol before and during isoflurane preconditioning attenuated this protection only in female neurons independent of nuclear estrogen receptors. We also found that independent of preconditioning treatment, female neurons were less sensitive to OGD compared with male neurons and that transient treatment with 17β-estradiol protected both male and female neurons from subsequent OGD. More studies are needed to determine how cell type, cell sex, and sex steroids like 17β-estradiol may impact on anesthetic preconditioning and subsequent ischemic outcomes in the brain.",

The drug targets multiple receptors, including VEGF-R1/-R2/-R3, TIE-2, FGFR-1, PDGFR-α/β, KIT, RET, RAF, p38 MAPK. Adverse events include asthenia, hypertension, diarrhea, and hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR), with the latter representing one of the most clinically significant untoward events. The incidence and risk of HFSR with regorafenib have not been systematically investigated.;We conducted a meta-analysis to ascertain the incidence and risk of developing HFSR in cancer patients treated with regorafenib. Electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science) and the ASCO website were searched for publications from January 1998-January 2013. Eligible studies were limited to Phase II/III clinical trials employing regorafenib (160 mg/day). The incidence, relative risk (RR), and 95 % CIs were calculated using random- or fixed-effects models based on the heterogeneity of included studies.;A total of 1,078 patients treated with regorafenib for mCRC, GIST, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were included. The overall incidence of all-grade and high-grade HFSR were 60.5 % (95 % CI: 48.3-71.6 %) and 20.4 % (95 % CI: 15.4-26.6 %), respectively. The RRs of all-grade and high-grade HFSR with regorafenib in comparison to controls were increased for all-grade (RR = 5.4, 95 % CI: 3.76-7.76, p < 0.001) and high-grade (RR = 41.99, 95 % CI: 5.88-299.93, p < 0.001) HFSR. The incidence of HFSR varied significantly with tumor type (p = 0.007), and was 71.4 % (95 % CI: 57.4-82.3 %) for RCC, 60.2 % (95 % CI: 52.3-67.6 %) for GIST, 50.0 % (95 % CI: 34.2-65.8 %) for HCC, and 46.6 % (95 % CI: 42.3-51.0 %) for mCRC.;The incidence and risk of development of HFSR with regorafenib is high, and may vary significantly with tumor type.

Protein expression of CD31, factor VIII (FVIII), FGF-1/2, FGFR1, FGFR3 and FGFR4 and FGFR3 mutation status were evaluated. Morphometric assessment of angiogenesis including microvessel count (MVC) and vascular surface area (VSA) was analysed. Correlation and survival analyses (overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS)) with univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. CD31 values (MVC and VSA) significantly correlated with OS and DFS. OS and DFS were significantly better in patients with FGFR3 overexpression. Multivariate analysis revealed FGFR3 protein expression and tumour grading (WHO classification 2004) as independent prognostic factors of OS and VSA of CD31 and FGFR3 protein expression of DFS. FGFR3 mutation status was correlated with VSA measured by FVIII. FGFR3 may be able to induce a pro-angiogenic phenotype in urothelial carcinomas and significantly influence prognosis.

The PO2 and pH levels in the astrocyte culture medium were compared between a physical OGD group, a chemical OGD group and a mixed OGD group. The mixed OGD group was able to maintain anaerobic conditions in astrocyte culture medium for 6 h, while the physical and the chemical groups failed to maintain such conditions. Astrocyte viability decreased and LDH release into in the medium increased as a function of exposure to OGD. Compared to the control group, the expression of active caspase-3 in the mixed OGD group increased within 2 h after OGD, but decreased after 2 h of OGD. Additionally, porimin mRNA levels did not significantly increase during the first 2 h of OGD, while bcl-2 mRNA levels decreased at 1 h. However, both porimin and bcl-2 mRNA levels increased after 2 h of OGD; interestingly, they both suddenly decreased at 4 h of OGD.

No significant signs of destruction were found in the cultures 1 h following 10 min OGD; moreover, clear increase in cell metabolic activity was determined by MTT/formazan assay. Ultrastructural analysis of CA1 stratum radiatum revealed an increase in the number of glial processes and the number of perforated and multiple synapses as compared to the control, where simple synapses were relatively more numerous. 4 h following 10 min OGD, manifestations of cell damage in the cultures appeared and become profound at 24 h after OGD. We suppose that mild (10 min) OGD leads to plastic changes in neurons and delayed cell damage. 30 and 60 min OGD resulted in more early and pronounced cell damage as compared to 10 min OGD.

OGD/reoxygenation-induced cell death was evaluated by LDH release into the culture medium. The level of LDH release was low (9.0% +/- 4.1%) immediately after 4 hr of OGD (0 hr of reoxygenation), was significantly increased to 28.6% +/- 6.6% at 3 hr of reoxygenation, and remained at similar levels at 6 and 20 hr of reoxygenation, suggesting that reoxygenation at least for 3 hr resulted in the loss of cell membrane integrity. After 4 hr of OGD followed by 3 hr of reoxygenation, dephosphorylation of phosphorylated CREB (pCREB), but not phosphorylated Akt (pAkt), was induced. Under these conditions, calpain- but not caspase-3-mediated alpha-spectrin breakdown product was increased, indicating that OGD/reoxygenation also induced an increase in calpain activity. The restoration of pCREB by protein phosphatase (PP)-1/2A inhibitors or the inhibition of excessive activation of calpain by calpain inhibitor did not reduce OGD/reoxygenation-induced LDH release. Cotreatment with PP-1/2A and calpain inhibitors reduced OGD/reoxygenation-induced LDH release. The present study suggests that a balance in the phosphorylation and proteolytic signaling is involved in the survival of NGF-differentiated PC12 cells.",

Here, miR-24, miR-125b, miR-195, and miR-214 were selected as representative cardio-miRs that are upregulated in human heart failure. To bridge the gap between miRNA studies in cardiology and oncology, the targets and functions of these miRNAs in cardiovascular diseases and cancers will be reviewed. ACVR1B, BCL2, BIM, eNOS, FGFR3, JPH2, MEN1, MYC, p16, and ST7L are miR-24 targets that have been experimentally validated in human cells. ARID3B, BAK1, BCL2, BMPR1B, ERBB2, FGFR2, IL6R, MUC1, SITR7, Smoothened, STAT3, TET2, and TP53 are representative miR-125b targets. ACVR2A, BCL2, CCND1, E2F3, GLUT3, MYB, RAF1, VEGF, WEE1, and WNT7A are representative miR-195 targets. BCL2L2, ß-catenin, BIM, CADM1, EZH2, FGFR1, NRAS, PTEN, TP53, and TWIST1 are representative miR-214 targets. miR-125b is a good cardio-miR that protects cardiomyocytes; miR-195 is a bad cardio-miR that elicits cardiomyopathy and heart failure; miR-24 and miR-214 are bi-functional cardio-miRs. By contrast, miR-24, miR-125b, miR-195, and miR-214 function as oncogenic or tumor suppressor miRNAs in a cancer (sub)type-dependent manner. Circulating miR-24 is elevated in diabetes, breast cancer and lung cancer. Circulating miR-195 is elevated in acute myocardial infarction, breast cancer, prostate cancer and colorectal adenoma. Circulating miR-125b and miR-214 are elevated in some cancers. Cardio-miRs and onco-miRs bear some similarities in functions and circulation profiles. miRNAs regulate WNT, FGF, Hedgehog and other signaling cascades that are involved in orchestration of embryogenesis and homeostasis as well as pathogenesis of human diseases. Because circulating miRNA profiles are modulated by genetic and environmental factors and are dysregulated by genetic and epigenetic alterations in somatic cells, circulating miRNA association studies (CMASs) within several thousands of cases each for common non-cancerous diseases and major cancers are necessary for miRNA-based diagnostics.

Using epidermal equivalents (HEEs) generated with keratinocytes isolated from non-lesional skin of patients with FLG wild type AD (WT/WT), FLG-mutated AD (FLG/WT), IV (FLG/FLG) or FLG WT control skin, we assessed the potential autocrine role of epidermal-derived eicosanoids in FLG-associated vs. FLG-WT AD pathogenesis. Ultrastructural analyses demonstrated abnormal stratum corneum lipid architecture in AD and IV HEEs, independent of FLG genotype. Both AD (FLG/WT) and IV (FLG/FLG) HEEs showed impaired late epidermal differentiation. Only AD (FLG/WT) HEEs exhibited significantly increased levels of inflammatory cytokines. Analyses of lipid mediators revealed increased arachidonic acid (AA) and 12-LOX metabolites. Whereas treatment of control HEEs with AA increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, 12-HETE attenuated expression of late differentiation markers. Thus, FLG mutations lead to alterations in epidermal eicosanoid metabolism that could serve as an autocrine trigger of inflammation and impaired epidermal late differentiation in AD.",

The preOC FLG 29.1 cells, known to be capable of irreversibly differentiating into multinucleated OC-like cells, displayed several features of primary OCs, including expression of specific integrins and the hyaluronan (HA) receptor CD44. OC-like FLG 29.1 cells adhered to and extensively migrated through membranes coated with fibronectin, vitronectin, and laminins, but, although strongly binding to HA, totally failed to move on this substrate. Moreover, soluble HA strongly inhibited OC-like FLG 29.1 cell migration on the permissive matrix substrates, and this behavior was dependent on its engagement with CD44, as it was fully restored by function-blocking anti-CD44 antibodies. HA did not modulate the cell-substrate binding affinity/avidity nor the expression levels of the corresponding integrins. MMP-9 was the major secreted metalloproteinase used by OC-like FLG 29.1 cells for migration, because this process was strongly inhibited by both TIMP-1 and GM6001, as well as by MMP-9-specific antisense oligonucleotides. After HA binding to CD44, a strong down-regulation of MMP-9 mRNA and protein was detected.

Confocal microscopy combined with 3D reconstruction was used to quantify ischemia-induced astrocyte volume changes in cortical slices of GFAP/EGFP transgenic mice. Twenty-minutes of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) or oxygen-glucose deprivation combined with acidification (OGD(pH 6.8)) revealed the presence of two distinct astrocytic populations, the first showing a large volume increase (HR astrocytes) and the second displaying a small volume increase (LR astrocytes). In addition, changes in resting membrane potential (V(m)), measured by the patch-clamp technique, supported the existence of two astrocytic populations responding differently to ischemia. Although one group markedly depolarized during OGD or OGD(pH 6.8), only small changes in V(m) toward more negative values were observed in the second group. Conversely, acidification (ACF(pH 6.8)) led to a uniform volume decrease in all astrocytes, accompanied by only a small depolarization. Interestingly, two differently responding populations were not detected during acidification. Differences in the expression of inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir4.1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and taurine levels in cortical astrocytes were detected using immunohistochemical methods. We conclude that two distinct populations of astrocytes are present in the cortex of GFAP/EGFP mice, based on volume and V(m) changes during exposure to OGD or OGD(pH 6.8).

Furthermore, they play important roles in the processes of regeneration, angiogenesis, and chemotaxis. The family of FGF receptors (FGFRs) comprises four members, FGFR-1 to -4, which exist in several differentially expressed splice variants. Except for FGFR-3, primary structures and expression of the three other FGFRs have been described in the rat system. Although expression studies with heterologous probes of FGFR-3 from mice have been performed in the rat system, these analyses were limited and the complete set of receptors has not yet been revealed. To understand the developmental functions of FGFR-3, it is important to elucidate the expression pattern in embryos of different stages. In this study, we have isolated a cDNA of FGFR-3 from rat brain. Expression analyses by RT-PCR of adult rat revealed expression in several tissues, however, expression levels were highest in lung and brain. During embryonic development, FGFR-3 displays a diffuse expression in most tissues at embryonic day 14 (E14), as observed by in situ hybridization experiments. In E18 the expression pattern is more restricted, showing strong signals in spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia, cortex, chondrocytes, and endothelial cells.

Here we used an in vitro model, oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) of rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, and analyzed changes in phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingomyelin (SM) metabolism. OGD (4-8 h) of PC12 cells triggered a dramatic reduction in PC and SM levels, and a significant increase in ceramide. OGD also caused increases in phosphatidylcholine-phospholipase C (PC-PLC) and phospholipase D (PLD) activities and PLD2 protein expression, and reduction in cytidine triphosphate:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase-alpha (CCTalpha, the rate-limiting enzyme in PC synthesis) protein expression and activity. Phospholipase A2 activity and expression were unaltered during OGD. Increased neutral sphingomyelinase activity during OGD could account for SM loss and increased ceramide. Surprisingly, treatment with PC-PLC inhibitor tricyclodecan-9-yl potassium xanthate (D609) aggravated cell death in PC12 cells during OGD. D609 was cytotoxic only during OGD; cell death could be prevented by inclusion of sera, glucose or oxygen. During OGD, D609 caused further loss of PC and SM, depletion of 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG), increase in ceramide and free fatty acids (FFA), cytochrome c release from mitochondria, increases in intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage and phosphatidylserine externalization, indicative of apoptotic cell death. Exogenous PC during OGD in PC12 cells with D609 attenuated PC, SM loss, restored DAG, attenuated ceramide levels, decreased cytochrome c release, PARP cleavage, annexin V binding, attenuated the increase in [Ca2+]i, FFA release, and significantly increased cell viability. Exogenous PC may have elicited these effects by restoring membrane PC levels. A tentative scheme depicting the mechanism of action of D609 (inhibiting PC-PLC, SM synthase, PC synthesis at the CDP-choline-1,2-diacylglycerol phosphocholine transferase (CPT) step and causing mitochondrial dysfunction) has been proposed based on our observations and literature.",

To identify the mechanisms of regulation of FGF actions during chondrogenesis and osteogenesis, we investigated, by immunohistochemistry, the spatiotemporal expression of the high-affinity FGF receptors (FGFR-1, -2, and -3) and coreceptors (syndecans-1, -2, and -4) in newborn rat condyle and calvaria during chondrogenesis and osteogenesis in vitro. During chondrogenesis at 4 days of culture, condyle chondrocytes showed weak FGFR-1, FGFR-2, and syndecan-1 immunoreactivity; stronger syndecan-2 expression; and marked FGFR-3 and syndecan-4 immunolabeling. At a later stage (i.e., 9 days of culture), FGFR-1, -2, and -3 were coexpressed with syndecan-4 in chondrocytes. Condyle progenitor cells located in the condyle perichondrium initially expressed strong syndecan-2 and -4 and weak syndecan-1 labeling, whereas no FGFR was detectable. When these cells differentiated into osteoblasts, they expressed syndecan-2 and -4 coincidently with FGFR-1, -2, and -3 at 9 days of culture. In newborn rat calvaria, syndecan-1, -2, and -4 were coexpressed mainly with FGFR-1 and -2 in osteoblasts. In the two models, treatment with FGF-2 (100 ng/mL) at 4-9 days of culture increased cell growth and decreased glycosaminoglycan or collagen synthesis, respectively, suggesting interactions of FGF-2 with distinct FGFRs and syndecans during chondrogenesis and osteogenesis. The coincident or distinct spatiotemporal expression pattern of FGFRs and syndecans in chondrocytes, progenitor cells, and osteoblasts represents a dynamic mechanism by which FGF effects on skeletal cells may be controlled in a coordinate manner during cartilage and bone formation in vitro.",

However, the mechanism of the neuroprotective effects of diazoxide remains unclear. This study highlights the anti-apoptotic effects of the drug, which are mediated by specific regulation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) in the process of oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells. Our data showed that pretreatment with diazoxide in SH-SY5Y cells following OGD concentration-dependently increased cell viability. Compared to cells induced by OGD alone, cells pretreated with diazoxide displayed reduced rates of apoptosis, increased mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm), and reduced AIF translocation to the cell nucleus. The protective effects of preconditioning with diazoxide were attenuated by 5-hydroxydecanoic acid (5-HD), a selective mitoK(ATP) channel antagonist. Meanwhile, cell death was blocked in OGD-induced cells stably transfected with the AIF-shRNA plasmid, and down-regulation of AIF reduced the diazoxide-mediated prevention of cell apoptosis as well as the loss of ΔΨm induced by OGD. Taken together, our results demonstrate for the first time that the AIF-mediated mitochondrial pathway plays a critical role in the protective effect of diazoxide against SH-SY5Y cell apoptosis induced by OGD.

Restriction enzyme analysis of mRNA revealed that transformation was associated with a switch in FGFR2 and FGFR3, from the IIIc to the IIIb isoform. There was widespread expression of FGFs, including FGF7, in all tissues but, FGF3 and FGF19 were expressed by malignant cell lines and cancer tissue but were not present in normal tissue. Using FGFR-specific shRNAi we demonstrated that reductions in FGFR2 inhibited proliferation of ovarian cancer cell lines in vitro (>50%, p < 0.006) and reduced cisplatin IC(50) (>60%, p < 0.0001). Cell cycle analysis revealed increased cisplatin sensitivity was associated with increased G(2)/M arrest and increased apoptosis. FGFR2 shRNAi reduced growth rates of ovarian tumor xenografts by 20% (p < 0.006) and when combined with cisplatin caused a 40% reduction in proliferation rates (p < 0.007). In contrast, RNAi-induced reductions in FGFR1 increased SKOV3 cell numbers, with associated changes in cell cycle but had no effect on ES2 cells. However, the cisplatin IC(50) was reduced (>50%, p < 0.0001) by FGFR1 shRNAi in both cell lines and there was increased apoptosis (46-50%) compared with control cells (35%) (p < 0.004). Together our data suggest that combining FGFR2 inhibitors with platinum-containing cytotoxic agents for the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer may yield increased antitumor activity.

In contrast, for phospholipase Cgamma(1) (PLCgamma(1)) and the adaptor molecule Shb to be maximally tyrosine-phosphorylated, cells had to be stimulated with both FGF-2 and heparin (100 ng/ml). Tyrosine residues 463 in the juxtamembrane domain and 766 in the C-terminal tail in FGFR-1 are known to bind Crk and PLCgamma(1), respectively. Analysis of tryptic phosphopeptide maps of FGFR-1 from cells stimulated with FGF-2 alone and FGF-2 together with heparin showed that FGF-2 alone stimulated a several-fold increase in tyrosine 463 in the juxtamembrane domain. In contrast, heparin had to be included in order for tyrosine 766 to be phosphorylated to the same fold level.

Preosteoclastic (FLG 29.1) cells were then added on top of the BBE cell monolayer and 10 nM insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I) was added below the supporting membrane. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy were used to evaluate the chemotactic responses of preosteoclastic FLG 29.1 cells towards the IGF-I generated gradient. IGF-I potently stimulated chemotaxis in the FLG 29.1 cells, as shown by the migration of the preosteoclastic cells across the underlying BBE and through the intercellular junctions between adjacent endothelial cells. Subsequently, FLG 29.1 cells penetrated the pores of the supporting membrane and reached the lower face of the membrane. Thus, IGF-I, which is abundantly present in the bone tissue microenvironment, may play a paracrine role in the recruitment of the circulating preosteoclasts from the vascular compartment into the bone tissue.

Receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3), a member of the RIP family of proteins, has been reported as an important necroptotic pathway mediator in regulating a variety of human diseases, such as myocardial ischemia, inflammatory bowel disease, and ischemic brain injury. Our previous study showed that RIP3 was expressed in rat retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), where it was significantly upregulated during the early stage of acute high intraocular pressure. Furthermore, RIP3 expression was co-localized with propidium iodide (PI)-positive staining (necrotic cells). These results suggested that RIP3 up-regulation might be involved in the necrosis of injured RGCs. In this study, we aimed to reveal the possible involvement of RIP3 in oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced retinal ganglion cell-5 (RGC-5) necroptosis.;RGC-5 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's-modified essential medium and necroptosis was induced by 8 h OGD. PI staining and flow cytometry were performed to detect RGC-5 necrosis. RIP3 expression was detected by western blot and flow cytometry was used to detect the effect of RIP3 on RGC-5 necroptosis following OGD in rip3 knockdown cells. Malondialdehyde (MDA) lipid peroxidation assay was performed to determine the degree of oxidative stress.;PI staining showed that necrosis was present in the early stage of OGD-induced RGC-5 cell death. The presence of RGC-5 necroptosis after OGD was detected by flow cytometry using necrostatin-1, a necroptosis inhibitor. Western blot demonstrated that RIP3 up-regulation may be involved in RGC-5 necroptosis. Flow cytometry revealed that the number of OGD-induced necrotic RGC-5 cells was reduced after rip3 knockdown.

To investigate the cellular and molecular neuroprotective mechanisms of NGF under ischemia, we used a unique oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) device. In this system we used pheochromocytoma PC12 cells to elucidate NGF neuroprotective effect. PC12 cells were exposed to OGD, followed by addition of glucose and oxygen (OGD reperfusion). Neuronal cell death induced in this model was measured by the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), activation of caspase-3 and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), measured with specific anti-phospho-antibodies. Pretreatment of the cultures with 50 ng/mL NGF, 18 h prior to OGD insult, conferred 30% neuroprotection. However, treatment of the cultures with NGF concomitantly with the OGD insult did not result in neuroprotection. Time-course experiments showed marked activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK isoforms during the OGD phase but not during OGD reperfusion. Pretreatment of the cultures with 50 ng/mL NGF, 18 h prior to OGD insult, resulted in 50% attenuation of OGD-induced activation of JNK1, and 20% and 50% attenuation of OGD-induced activation of p38alpha and beta, respectively. These findings support the notion that NGF confers neuroprotection from OGD insult, a phenomenon coincidentally related to differential inhibition of MAPK stress kinase isoforms, and provide the PC12 model as an in vitro OGD system to investigate molecular mechanisms of neurotoxicity and neuroprotection.",

We investigated the mechanisms of glutamate release in organotypic cerebrocortical slice cultures prepared from rat neonates, using oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) as an in vitro ischemia model. Slice cultures were submerged in glucose-free deoxygenated buffer for 20-60 min and glutamate released into the extracellular buffer was quantified. Cell injury was assessed by uptake of propidium iodide 24 h after OGD insult. OGD-induced time-dependent glutamate release and cell injury, both of which were potently inhibited by a sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (1 microM). Application of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel blockers or of an inhibitor of vacuolar-ATPase significantly reduced OGD-induced glutamate release and cell injury. On the contrary, inhibitors of glutamate transporters exacerbated OGD-induced glutamate release and cell injury. Volume sensitive organic anion channel blockers also augmented OGD-induced glutamate release and cell injury. In addition, OGD-induced glutamate release was markedly reduced in neuron-depleted slice cultures that were pretreated with 100 microM NMDA. These results suggest that vesicular release of neuronal origin constitutes a crucial component of extracellular glutamate increase during ischemic insults, which triggers neuronal injury.",

In this study we found that the expression of adipose tissue bacterial flagellin (FLG)-recognizing Toll-like receptor (TLR) 5 associated with liver fat content (r = 0.699, p = 0.003) and insulin sensitivity (r = -0.529, p = 0.016) in humans (n = 23). No such associations were found for lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-recognizing TLR4. To study the underlying molecular mechanisms of these associations, human HepG2 hepatoma cells were exposed in vitro to the conditioned culture media derived from FLG or LPS-challenged human adipocytes. The adipocyte-mediated effects were also compared to the effects of direct HepG2 exposure to FLG and LPS. We found that the media derived from FLG-treated adipocytes stimulated fat accumulation in HepG2 cells, whereas either media derived from LPS-treated adipocytes or direct FLG or LPS exposure did not. This is likely due to that FLG-treatment of adipocytes increased lipolysis and secretion of glycerol, which is known to serve a substrate for triglyceride synthesis in hepatocytes. Similarly, only FLG-media significantly decreased insulin signaling-related Akt phosphorylation, IRS1 expression and mitochondrial respiratory chain ATP5A. In conclusion, our results suggest that the FLG-induced TLR5 activation in adipocytes increases glycerol secretion from adipocytes and decreases insulin signaling and mitochondrial functions, and increases fat accumulation in hepatocytes. These mechanisms could, at least partly, explain the adipose tissue TLR5 expression associated with liver fat content in humans. ",

According to these guidelines, children suspected of having IBD should undergo an oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD), ileocolonoscopy, and (except in cases of definitive ulcerative colitis) adequate imaging of the small bowel. To audit and evaluate the diagnostic workup of paediatric patients with IBD in Europe, the Working Group created EUROKIDS, a prospective, Web-based registry of newly diagnosed paediatric patients with IBD.;Patients with IBD (ages 0-18 years) were registered in 44 centres in 18 countries. Data on diagnostic workup were analysed according to the year of diagnosis, type of IBD, and centre size. Diagnostic yield of OGD and ileal intubation were evaluated.;Between 2004 and 2009, 2087 newly diagnosed patients were correctly registered. Both OGD and ileocolonoscopy had been performed in 64% of all of the patients and increased significantly from year 1 (52 %) to 5 (71%, P  <  0.001). Small-bowel follow-through use decreased during the years (year 1 n = 213, year 5 n = 108; P < 0.001), whereas magnetic resonance imaging use increased (year 1 n  = 25, year 5 n  = 171; P < 0.001). Patients diagnosed as having Crohn disease (CD, 59%) and ulcerative colitis (58%) were more likely to have had a complete diagnostic workup than patients diagnosed as having IBD unclassified (45%). In CD, the diagnostic yield of OGD was 7.5% and the yield of ileal intubation was 13%.;The quality of diagnostic workup in paediatric patients with IBD increased steadily between 2004 and 2009. Small-bowel imaging by magnetic resonance imaging superseded the use of small-bowel follow-through. OGD and ileal intubation contributed to a definitive diagnosis of CD.",

To date, no known genes are known to be specifically expressed in the dedifferentiating cells and to be involved in lens regeneration. In this paper, we show that FGFR-1 expression and function is correlated with the process of lens regeneration from the dorsal iris. Following lentectomy, FGFR-1 protein is specifically present in the dedifferentiating pigment epithelial cells in the dorsal iris, but is absent from the ventral iris. Subsequently, FGFR-1 protein is present throughout the process of lens regeneration and fiber differentiation. Furthermore, we show that an FGFR-1-specific inhibitor is able to inhibit the process of transdifferentiation and lens regeneration. In this sense, FGFR-1 can be regarded as the first known lens regeneration-associated factor.",

Recently, we found that NBP can reduce the incidence of stroke and have protective action on cerebral microvessels, suggesting a direct action of NBP on endothelial cells. However, it is difficult to evaluate the direct action of NBP on endothelial cells in vivo because of the interactions of endothelial cells with other types of neuronal cells. Therefore, we investigated whether NBP protects against oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced cell injury in an immortalized human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in vitro. Cells were exposed to OGD, leading to endothelial damage. Endothelial injury was assessed by measuring MTT and the changes in chromatin morphology. Mitochondrial superoxide, mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial morphology were assessed using MitoSOX Red. Rhodamine 123 and MitoTracker, respectively. Nitrosative stress was assessed by measuring the production of peroxynitrite. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) is evaluated using SOD assay kit-WST. The expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) was assessed at the protein level by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. NBP at doses between 0.01 and 100 micromol/L dose-dependently protected against OGD-induced cell death. In addition, NBP attenuated OGD-induced mitochondria superoxide, cellular formation of peroxynitrite, and decrease in SOD activity, mitochondria fragmentation and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. In parallel, NBP enhanced OGD-induced HIF-1alpha expression. This study demonstrates that NBP can protect HUVEC against OGD-induced oxidative/nitrosative stress, mitochondrial damage and subsequent cell death. This protective effect is, at least in part, associated with its enhancement on OGD-induced HIF-1alpha expression.",

Here, we used genetically and chemically-induced mouse models of skin SCC to investigate the signaling pathways contributing to CSC function during disease progression. We found that CSC regulatory mechanisms change in advanced SCC, correlating with aggressive tumor growth and enhanced metastasis. β-Catenin and EGFR signaling, induced in early SCC CSC, were downregulated in advanced SCC. Instead, autocrine FGFR1 and PDGFRα signaling, which have not been previously associated with skin SCC CSC, were upregulated in late CSC and promoted tumor growth and metastasis, respectively. Finally, high-grade and recurrent human skin SCC recapitulated the signaling changes observed in advanced mouse SCC.

        "Doc_abstract":"EUK-207 is a synthetic superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetic that has been shown to reverse age-related learning deficits and brain oxidative stress in mice. In the present experiments, we tested the effects of EUK-207 on oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced cell death in cultured hippocampal slices and on several mechanisms that have been postulated to participate in this process. Cultured hippocampal slices were subjected to 1 h OGD followed by 3 or 24 h recovery in regular medium with glucose and oxygen. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in culture medium and propidium iodide (PI) uptake in slices were used to evaluate cell viability. When EUK-207 was applied either 1 or 2 h before OGD, OGD-induced LDH release was significantly reduced. When EUK-207 was applied 1 h before OGD and during 24 h recovery, PI uptake was also reduced. OGD-induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was evaluated with the fluorescent probe DCF. DCF fluorescence in slices increased steadily during OGD treatment, rapidly disappeared following return to regular medium before slowly increasing again during the 24 h recovery period. When measured 3 h after OGD, increased ROS levels were significantly reduced by EUK-207. OGD also increased lipid peroxidation levels and this effect was also reduced by EUK-207 6 h following OGD. Cytosolic cytochrome c and nuclear apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) were increased 3 h after OGD, and the translocation of AIF from mitochondria to nucleus was partly blocked by treatment with EUK-207. In conclusion, EUK-207 provides neuroprotection against OGD-induced cell death in cultured hippocampal slices. As EUK-207 prevents free radical formation and lipid peroxidation, the neuroprotection is related to elimination of free radical generation and lipid peroxidation, as well as to decreased activation of pro-apoptotic factors. Our data support the further clinical evaluation of this class of molecules for the prevention of ischemic cell damage.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The effects of glucose and O2 deprivation (OGD) on the survival of cortical and cerebellar neurons were examined to characterize the biochemical mechanisms involved in OGD and OGD followed by reoxygenation. To this aim, neurons were kept for different time periods in a hypoxic chamber with a controlled atmosphere of 95% N(2) and 5% CO2 in a glucose-free medium. After OGD, reoxygenation was achieved by exposing the cells to normal O2 and glucose levels. Neither MTT, an index of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, nor malondialdehyde (MDA) production, a parameter measuring lipid peroxidation, were affected by 1 hr of OGD in cortical neurons. When OGD was followed by 24 hr of reoxygenation, MTT levels were reduced by 40% and MDA was significantly increased, whereas cellular ATP content did not change. Cerebellar granule cells, on the other hand, did not show any reduction of mitochondrial activity after exposure to 1 hr OGD or to 1 hr OGD plus 24 hr of reoxygenation. When OGD was prolonged for 2 hr, a significant reduction of the mitochondrial activity and of cellular ATP content occurred, coupled to a significant MDA increase in cerebellar granule cells, whereas in cortical neurons a reduction of MTT levels after 2 hr OGD was not accompanied by a decrease of cellular ATP content nor by an increase of MDA production. Moreover, 24 hr of reoxygenation further reinforced lipid peroxidation, LDH release, propidium iodide positive neurons and the reduction of ATP content in cerebellar granule cells. The results of the present study collectively show that cortical and cerebellar neurons display different levels of vulnerability to reoxygenation followed by OGD. Furthermore, the impairment of mitochondrial activity and the consequent overproduction of free radicals in neurons were observed for the first time occurring not only during the reoxygenation phase, but already beginning during the OGD phase.",

In this study, we investigated the role of ENOPH1 in blood brain barrier (BBB) injury under ischemic conditions. Focal cerebral ischemia induced ENOPH1 mRNA and protein expression in ischemic hemispheric microvessels in rats. Exposure of cultured brain microvascular endothelial cells (bEND3 cells) to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) also induced ENOPH1 upregulation, which was accompanied by increased cell death and apoptosis reflected by increased 3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide formation, lactate dehydrogenase release and TUNEL staining. Knockdown of ENOPH1 expression with siRNA or overexpressing ENOPH1 with CRISPR-activated plasmids attenuated or potentiated OGD-induced endothelial cell death, respectively. Moreover, ENOPH1 knockdown or overexpression resulted in a significant reduction or augmentation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, apoptosis-associated proteins (caspase-3, PARP, Bcl-2 and Bax) and Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress proteins (Ire-1, Calnexin, GRP78 and PERK) in OGD-treated endothelial cells. OGD upregulated the expression of ENOPH1's downstream protein aci-reductone dioxygenase 1 (ADI1) and enhanced its interaction with ENOPH1. Interestingly, knockdown of ENOPH1 had no effect on OGD-induced ADI1 upregulation, while it potentiated OGD-induced ADI1 translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Lastly, knockdown of ENOPH1 significantly reduced OGD-induced endothelial monolayer permeability increase. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that ENOPH1 activation may contribute to OGD-induced endothelial cell death and BBB disruption through promoting ROS generation and the activation of apoptosis associated proteins, thus representing a new therapeutic target for ischemic stroke.

We hypothesize that inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), a protein whose activation can lead to cell death, participates in anesthetic post-conditioning-induced neuroprotection. SH-SY5Y cells, a human neuroblastoma cell line, were induced by retinoic acid to differentiate into terminal neuron-like cells. The cells were then subjected to a 1-h oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), a condition to simulate ischemia in vitro, and a 20-h simulated reperfusion. Isoflurane, sevoflurane or desflurane, three commonly used volatile anesthetics, were applied for 1 h during the early phase of simulated reperfusion. Cell injury was quantified by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Phospho-GSK3β at Ser9 and total GSK3β were quantified at 1 or 3 h after the OGD. OGD increased LDH release, suggesting that OGD induced cell injury. Post-treatment with isoflurane, sevoflurane or desflurane reduced this cell injury. This protection was apparent when 2% isoflurane was applied within 1 h after the onset of reperfusion. Isoflurane post-treatment also significantly increased the phosphorylation of GSK3β at Ser9 at 1 h after the OGD. GSK3β inhibitors reduced OGD and simulated reperfusion-induced LDH release. The combination of GSK3β inhibitors and isoflurane post-conditioning did not cause a greater protection than isoflurane post-conditioning alone. These results suggest that volatile anesthetic post-conditioning reduces OGD and simulated reperfusion-induced cell injury. Since phospho-GSK3β at Ser9 decreases GSK3β activity, our results suggest that volatile anesthetic post-conditioning in human neuron-like cells may be mediated by GSK3β inhibition.",

In contrast, tissue osteoclasts did not react with anti-SCF antibodies, and barely detectable levels of SCF mRNA and protein were found in FLG 29.1 cells. Conversely, a strong expression of membrane bound-SCF was found in primary cultured bone marrow stromal cells, in a stromal cell line (C433) derived from the mononuclear component of GCT of bone, and in a human cell line with osteoblast features (Saos-2). FLG 29.1 preosteoclast cells displayed about 29,000 binding sites/cell of a single class of high affinity c-kit receptors (Kd 6.12 x 10(-10) mol/L) with a molecular weight of about 140 kDa, along with a structurally normal c-kit mRNA. Proliferation of FLG 29.1 preosteoclast cells was stimulated by exogenous SCF, indicating that c-kit was capable of transducing growth signals. Finally, in vitro adhesion of FLG 29.1 cells to primary bone marrow stromal cells, GCT-derived stromal cells (C433), and Saos-2 osteoblast cells was significantly inhibited by an excess of soluble SCF or by monoclonal antibodies recognizing SCF binding sites on the c-kit receptor. These results indicate that c-kit is constitutively expressed on human osteoclasts and that it may be directly implicated in cell contact-dependent interaction of osteoclasts with other specialized or accessory cell populations of the bone microenvironment. Our observations suggest a role for SCF in human diseases characterized by abnormal bone resorption and remodeling.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The MET receptor tyrosine kinase, the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), has been implicated in cancer growth, invasion, migration, angiogenesis, and metastasis in a broad variety of human cancers, including human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recently, MET was suggested to be a potential target for the personalized treatment of HCC with an active HGF-MET signaling pathway. However, the mechanisms of resistance to MET inhibitors need to be elucidated to provide effective treatment. Here, we show that HCC cells exhibit different sensitivities to the MET inhibitor PHA665752, depending on the phosphorylation status of FGFR. Treatment of cells expressing both phospho-FGFR and phospho-MET with the inhibitor PHA665752 did not cause growth inhibition and cell death, whereas treatment with AZD4547, a pan-FGFR inhibitor, resulted in decreased colony formation and cleavage of caspase-3. Moreover, silencing of endogenous FGFR1 and FGFR2 by RNAi of HCC cells expressing phospho-FGFR, phospho-FGFR2, and phospho-MET overcame the resistance to PHA665752 treatment. Treatment of primary cancer cells from patients with HCC expressing both phospho-FGFR and phospho-MET with PHA665752 did not induce cell death, whereas AZD4547 treatment induced cell death through the cleavage of caspase-3. In addition, treatment of cells resistant to PHA665752 with AZD4547 abrogated the activation of downstream effectors of cell growth, proliferation, and survival. On the basis of these results, we conclude that the FGFR pathway is critical for HCC survival, and that targeting this pathway with AZD4547 may be beneficial for the treatment of patients with HCC-expressing phospho-FGFR and phospho-MET.",

Newborn Wister rats were decapitated under anesthesia, and hippocampal tissue was dissected. Cells were plated at 1.0 × 10(5) cells/mL on polylysine-treated 96-well and 6-well plates.

Our previous study found a significant NDRG2 up-regulation in reactive astrocytes of penumbra after transient focal cerebral ischemia, which was parallel to the enhancement of TUNEL-positive signals. However, it is still uncertain whether NDRG2 participates in cellular apoptosis induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury in brain. In this study, we investigated the role of NDRG2 in cellular apoptosis induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in IL-6-differentiated C6 glioma cells. The results showed that NDRG2 was up-regulated and translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after OGD exposure. NDRG2 over-expression exhibited an anti-proliferative effect and increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio after OGD exposure, while NDRG2 silencing promoted the cellular proliferation and attenuated the up-regulation of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. The pro-apoptotic effect of p53 was verified by the results in which p53 silencing greatly reduced the percentage of OGD-induced apoptotic cells. p53 silencing also reduced the OGD-induced NDRG2 up-regulation. However, over-expression of p53 did not further improve the NDRG2 up-regulation. In conclusion, NDRG2 is a p53-associated regulator of apoptosis in C6-originated astrocytes after OGD exposure. These findings bring insight to the roles of NDRG2 in ischemic-hypoxic injury and provide potential targets for future clinical therapies on stroke.",

Cell death was determined by 3-[4,5-dimethylthialzol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and cellular ATP assays. The expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and musashi-1 as markers of reactive astrogliosis was examined with immunochemical staining. mRNA expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were analyzed by RT-PCR and flow cytometry, respectively. OGD increased cytotoxicity in a time-dependent manner and decreased cellular ATP content concomitantly in hAs. Pretreatment and posttreatment with hDPSCs were associated with greater recovery from OGD-induced cytotoxicity in hAs compared with hMSCs. Similarly, CM-hDPSCs had a greater effect on OGD-induced cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Pre- and posttreatment with CM-hDPSCs or CM-hMSCs attenuated OGD-induced GFAP, nestin, and musashi-1 expression in hAs. Furthermore, treatment of cells with CM-hDPSCs and hMSCs blocked OGD-induced ROS production and interleukin-1ß upregulation. This study demonstrates for the first time that hDPSCs and CM-hDPSCs confer superior cytoprotection against cell death in an in vitro OGD model compared with hMSCs as shown by cell viability assay. Reactive gliosis, ROS production, and inflammatory mediators might contribute to this protective effect. Therefore, hDPSCs could represent an alternative source of cell therapy for ischemic stroke.",

        "Doc_abstract":"We have examined the cellular distribution of both FGF-2 and FGFR1 immunoreactivity and their mRNAs throughout the normal adult rat brain in order to reconcile numerous disparate findings in the published literature. The results confirm a widespread distribution of FGF-2 and FGFR1 in the rat brain, and different regions express distinct patterns of FGF-2 and FGFR1 mRNA and protein: neuronal and non-neuronal cells show different subcellular distributions that vary according to the area where they are located. The intensity of the staining and hybridization also varies according to the loci examined and the cell type involved. Astrocytes contain the highest levels of FGF-2 and FGFR1 mRNAs, and characteristically, possess high levels of immunoreactive FGF-2 within the nucleus. Amongst non-neuronal cells, oligodendrocytes do not synthesize or contain significant levels of FGF-2 immunoreactivity however, they do express FGFR1 mRNA. In these cells, immunoreactive FGFR1 is mainly associated with the myelin sheaths of neuronal fibers. In ventricular systems, ependymal cells synthesize and contain immunoreactive FGFR1. In contrast, only cells lining the lateral wall of the IIIrd ventricle express FGF-2 mRNA. Subependymal cells contain high levels of both FGF-2 and FGFR1 immunoreactivity. Neurons express low levels of FGF-2 mRNA and immunoreactive FGF-2 is localized predominantly to the perikaryon. However, selected populations of neurons, such as CA2 field of the hippocampus, show high levels of FGF-2 mRNA, in which the nucleus is strongly immunopositive. Similarly, high levels of FGFR1 mRNA are localized to select populations of neurons (e.g. amygdala). FGFR1 immunoreactivity is mainly associated with myelinated fiber tracts (e.g. striatum), and some neurons show immunoreactivity in the perikaryon (e.g. hippocampus), the nucleus (e.g. mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus), or in axonal projections (e.g. hypothalamus). Remarkably, in many of the areas studied, FGF-2 and FGFR1 mRNA and/or their translated protein do not co-localize in neurons (e.g. neo-cortices) or even in the same regions of the brain (e.g. substantia nigra). In other instances, mRNAs for both FGF-2 and FGFR1 colocalize (e.g. supraoptic nucleus). The brain, in contrast to peripheral tissues, contains high levels of FGF-2 and actively expresses its gene under normal physiological conditions. The highly specific anatomical distribution of immunoreactive FGF-2 in neuronal and non-neuronal brain cells, supports the notion that it plays a multifunctional role in the CNS under normal physiology. By correlating the localization and the synthesis of FGF-2 and one of its high affinity receptors, FGFR1, in the CNS, it should be possible to obtain a better understanding of the roles of FGF-2 in normal and pathological conditions.",

C6 glial cells were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) for 5 h and cell swelling was determined 90 min after the end of OGD. OGD-induced swelling was significantly blocked by both quercetin and myricetin although higher concentrations were required for quercetin. OGD-induced free radical production, a contributing factor in cell swelling, was significantly reduced by both myricetin and quercetin. However, depolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ(m)), the blockade of which generally reduces swelling, was significantly diminished by myricetin, but not quercetin. This indicated that quercetin could reduce swelling despite its inability to prevent depolarization of ΔΨ(m) possibly through other signaling pathways. Increased intracellular calcium ([Ca²+](i)) is an important characteristic of ischemic injury and is implicated in swelling. Both myricetin and quercetin attenuated the increase in [Ca²+](i). Further, a reduction in [Ca²+](i), through the use of nifedipine, nimodipine, verapamil, dantrolene, or BAPTA-AM, significantly reduced OGD-induced cell swelling indicating that one possible mechanism by which such flavonoids attenuate cell swelling may be through regulating [Ca²+](i). OGD-induced decrease in glutamate uptake was attenuated by myricetin, but not quercetin. Cyclosporin A, a blocker of the mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT) pore, but not FK506 (that does not block the mPT), attenuated the decline in glutamate uptake after OGD, indicating the involvement of the mPT in glutamate uptake. Our results indicated that while blockade of ΔΨ(m) may be sufficient to reduce swelling, it may not be a necessary factor, and that flavonoids reduce cell swelling by regulating [Ca²+](i). The differential effects of myricetin and quercetin on OGD-induced reduction on glutamate uptake may be due to their differential effects on mitochondria.",

Mutations in the gene encoding filaggrin (FLG) have been identified as the cause of ichthyosis vulgaris (IV) and have been shown to be major predisposing factors for atopic dermatitis (AD). Approximately 40 loss-of-function FLG mutations have been identified in patients with ichthyosis vulgaris (IV) and/or atopic dermatitis (AD) in Europe and Asia. Major differences exist in the spectra of FLG mutations observed between different ancestral groups. Notably, prevalent FLG mutations are distinct between European and Asian populations. Many cohort studies on FLG mutations in AD have revealed that approximately 25-50% of AD patients harbour filaggrin mutations as a predisposing factor. In addition, FLG mutations are significantly associated with AD-associated asthma. The risk for developing allergic rhinitis is also significantly higher with a FLG mutation, both with and without accompanying AD. Recent studies have hypothesized that skin barrier defects caused by FLG mutations allows allergens to penetrate the epidermis and to interact with antigen-presenting cells, leading to the development of atopic disorders including asthma. The restoration of skin barrier function seems a feasible and promising strategy for prophylactic treatment of AD patients with FLG mutations.",

Over-expression of PGC-1alpha can protect neuronal cells from oxidant-induced injury. The purpose of the current study is to investigate the role of PGC-1alpha in the oxygen (anoxia) deprivation (OGD) neurons. The PGC-1alpha mRNA and protein level between control and OGD neurons were examined by real-time PCR and Western blot. More PGC-1alpha expression was found in the OGD neurons compared with the normal group. Over-expression of PGC-1alpha suppressed cell apoptosis while inhibition of the PGC-1alpha expression induced cell apoptosis in OGD neurons. Furthermore, increase of PGC-1alpha resulted in activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, p38, and ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The blocking of the NMDA receptor by its antagonists MK-801 reduced PGC-1alpha mRNA expression in OGD neurons, while NMDA itself can directly induce the expression of PGC-1alpha in neuronal cells. At the same time, PD98059 (ERK MAPK inhibitor) and SB203580 (P38 MAPK inhibitor) also prevented the up-regulation of PGC-1alpha in OGD neurons and MK801 can inhibit the expression of P38 and ERK MAPK. These data suggested that the expression of PGC-1alpha was up-regulated in OGD mice cortical neurons, which protected the neurons against OGD injury. Moreover, this effect was correlated to the NMDA receptor and the ERK and P38 MAPK pathway. The protective effect of PGC-1alpha on OGD cortical neurons may be useful for stroke therapy.",

Although the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown, previous reports suggest that this protection can be realised by the fact that they act as ROS scavengers. In this study, expression of neuroglobin and cytoglobin was evaluated in a human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y) under conditions of anoxia or oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). The cells could survive prolonged anoxia without significant loss of viability. They became anoxia sensitive when deprived of glucose. OGD induced significant cell death after 16 h resulting in 54% dead cells after 32 h. Necrosis was the main process involved in OGD-induced cell death. After reoxygenation, apoptotic neurons became more abundant. Real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting revealed that neuroglobin and cytoglobin were upregulated, the former under OGD and the latter under anoxic conditions. Under OGD, cell survival was significantly reduced after inhibiting cytoglobin expression by transfection with antisense ODN. Moreover, cell survival was significantly enhanced by neuroglobin or cytoglobin overexpression. When neuroglobin or cytoglobin protein expression increased or decreased, the H(2)O(2) level was found to be lower or higher, respectively.

Extracellular concentrations of glutamate and glutamate uptake were assessed at the end of the ischemic injury by high-performance liquid chromatography and incorporation of L-[H]glutamate into cells, respectively. Free radical generation in cells was assessed 6 h after OGD during the reoxygenation period using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate, which reacts with intracellular radicals to be converted to its fluorescent product, 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin, in cell cytosol.;Twenty-four hours after OGD, sevoflurane, in a concentration-dependent manner, significantly reduced lactate dehydrogenase release and increased cell viability. At the end of OGD, sevoflurane was able to reduce the OGD-induced decrease in glutamate uptake. This effect was impaired in the presence of threo-3-methyl glutamate, a specific inhibitor of the glial transporter GLT1. Sevoflurane counteracted the increase in extracellular level of glutamate during OGD and the generation of reactive oxygen species during reoxygenation.;Sevoflurane had a neuroprotective effect in this in vitro model of ischemia-reoxygenation. This beneficial effect may be explained, at least in part, by sevoflurane-induced antiexcitotoxic properties during OGD, probably depending on GLT1, and by sevoflurane-induced decrease of reactive oxygen species generation during reoxygenation.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Therapeutic targeting of late-stage breast cancer is limited by an inadequate understanding of how tumor cell signaling evolves during metastatic progression and by the currently available small molecule inhibitors capable of targeting these processes. Herein, we demonstrate that both β3 integrin and fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1) are part of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program that is required to facilitate metastatic outgrowth in response to fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2). Mechanistically, β3 integrin physically disrupts an interaction between FGFR1 and E-cadherin, leading to a dramatic redistribution of FGFR1 subcellular localization, enhanced FGF2 signaling and increased three-dimensional (3D) outgrowth of metastatic breast cancer cells. This ability of β3 integrin to drive FGFR signaling requires the enzymatic activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Consistent with these mechanistic data, we demonstrate that FGFR, β3 integrin, and FAK constitute a molecular signature capable of predicting decreased survival of patients with the basal-like subtype of breast cancer. Importantly, covalent targeting of a conserved cysteine in the P-loop of FGFR1-4 with our newly developed small molecule, FIIN-4, more effectively blocks 3D metastatic outgrowth as compared with currently available FGFR inhibitors. In vivo application of FIIN-4 potently inhibited the growth of metastatic, patient-derived breast cancer xenografts and murine-derived metastases growing within the pulmonary microenvironment. Overall, the current studies demonstrate that FGFR1 works in concert with other EMT effector molecules to drive aberrant downstream signaling, and that these events can be effectively targeted using our novel therapeutics for the treatment of the most aggressive forms of breast cancer.

Although classified as benign, it has a tendency to recur (recurrent pleomorphic adenomas (RPA)), as well as the ability to undergo malignant transformation.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the participation of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-A, PDGF-B, PDGF-Rα, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2, Flg and BEK in PA, RPA and recurrent pleomorphic adenoma with malignant transformation (TRPA).;18 cases of PA, 16 cases of RPA and two cases of RPA with focal malignant transformation (TRPA) were analysed for growth factor expression utilising immunohistochemical techniques via tissue microarray.;There was a significant difference in PDGF-A, PDGF-B, PDGF-Rα, FGF-2, Flg and BEK expression in all groups. When comparing non-recurrent with recurrent tumours, PDGF-A, PDGF-B, PDGF-Rα, FGF-2, Flg and BEK reactivity in RPA was stronger than that observed in PA. All proteins were highly expressed in TRPA.;This research suggests that PDGF-A, PDGF-B, PDGF-Rα, FGF-2, BEK and Flg can be related to the recurrence of PA. In addition, this study shows that TRPA cells overexpress all growth factors, which has been reported in association with the malignant transformation.",

To define their sites of action, we examined the expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR-1) during burn wound healing in rat skin by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. In cryostat sections of intact skin, little or no staining was observed. After a burn, however, staining for FGFR-1 was found in newly forming epidermis. The suprabasal layer of such epidermis, composed mostly of regenerating keratinocytes, was stained intensely, whereas keratinocytes in newly forming hair follicles were devoid of staining. Staining gradually decreased week by week after wound closure and was hardly visible 10 weeks after the burn, when the thickness of the epidermis had returned to the normal level. Staining was also found in small blood vessels and capillaries of granulation tissues of the dermis. Western blot analysis using the same antiserum was performed in the newly forming epidermis 10 d after the burn. A single band was detected with an apparent molecular weight of 120 kDa, corresponding to the short membrane-bound form of rat FGFR-1. Our study indicates that FGFR-1 is expressed during wound healing, mainly in regenerating epidermis and to some extent in blood vessels of the dermis.

FGF signalingis mediated through four high-affinity tyrosine kinasereceptors, termed fibroblast growth-factor receptors(FGFRs) (3,4). The extracellular domain of FGFRsis usually composed of three immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains (I-III), a transmembrane region followedby a juxtamembrane domain, and a splittyrosine kinase catalytic domain. Several isoformsof FGFR-1, -2, and -3 have been identified, some of which exhibit different ligand-binding properties(3,5). Alternative splicing of the second half of Igdomain III of FGFR-1 results in three receptor variants,termed IIIa, IIIb, and IIIc. The IIIa splice variantyields a secreted receptor that is devoid of anysignaling capacity (5).

To define their sites of action in normal human skin and during wound healing, we determined the protein expression of the four known fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) in normal and wounded human skin by immunohistochemistry. Four receptors (FGFR-1 to FGFR-4) showed distinct patterns of expression in normal skin. Expression of FGFR-1 was widespread in the epidermis, appendages, arrector pili muscles, blood vessels, and dermal fibroblasts. Intense expression of FGFR-2 and FGFR-4 was seen in the arrector pili muscles and smooth muscle cells of vessels. In the epidermis, the basal layer showed immunoreactivity for FGFR-2, whereas the suprabasal layers and the inner layers of hair follicles showed strong immunoreactivity for FGFR-3. In wounded skin, there was strong expression of FGFR-1 and FGFR-3, and moderate expression of FGFR-2 and FGFR-4 in the basal layer in newly forming epidermis. In granulation tissues, neocapillaries expressed all four FGFRs, fibroblasts/myofibroblasts expressed FGFR-1 and FGFR-3, and mononuclear inflammatory cells expressed FGFR-1 and FGFR-3.

Microglial cells have been found to be very vulnerable to ischemia and OGD. It has been reported that isoflurane exposure can protect the mammalian brain from insults such as ischemic stroke; however, the effects of isoflurane on OGD-induced injury in microglia are as yet unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of isoflurane on OGD-induced injury in microglia. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) revealed that OGD did indeed induce cell death in microglia. However, isoflurane preconditioning attenuated OGD-induced cell death. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay demonstrated that isoflurane treatment alleviated OGD-induced apoptosis. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plays a considerable role in the induction of innate immune and inflammatory responses. Our results indicate that isoflurane preconditioning inhibits the upregulation of TLR4 as well as the activation of its downstream molecules, such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), in BV-2 microglia exposed to OGD. Importantly, we also found that isoflurane pretreatment significantly reduces the production of proinflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-β, and nitric oxide (NO).

Glutamate-induced cell death was more pronounced in DIV-9 and DIV-11 cells than that in DIV-7 neurons, and an application of 50µM glutamate was shown to induce approximately 40% cell death in DIV-9 neurons. Interestingly, treatment with mulberry C3G fraction did not provide a protective effect against glutamate-induced cell death in primary cortical neurons. On the other hand, treatment with mulberry C3G fraction maintained the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in primary cortical neurons exposed to OGD as assessed by the intensity of rhodamine-123 fluorescence. These results therefore suggest that the neuroprotective effects of mulberry C3G fraction are mediated by the maintenance of the MMP and mitochondrial function but not by attenuating glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in rat primary cortical neurons.",

In order to elucidate the mechanisms of MSC-induced neuroprotection, we used the in vitro oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) model of cerebral ischemia. Co-culture of primary cortical neurons with MSCs in a transwell co-culture system for 48 h prior to OGD-reduced neuronal cell death by 30-35%. Similar protection from apoptosis was observed with MSC-conditioned media when added 48 h or 30 min prior to OGD, or even after OGD. Western blot analysis revealed increased phosphorylation of STAT3 and Akt in neuronal cultures after treatment with MSC-conditioned media. Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway completely abolished the neuroprotective potential of MSC-conditioned media, suggesting that MSCs can improve neuronal survival by an Akt-dependent anti-apoptotic signaling cascade. Using mass spectrometry, we identified plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 as an active compound in MSC-conditioned media. Thus, paracrine factors secreted by MSCs protect neurons from apoptotic cell death in the OGD model of cerebral ischemia.",

However, the intracellular and molecular mechanisms behind this beneficial effect have not been specified. The aim of this study was to determine whether human erythropoietin (rhEPO) reduces the astrocytic swelling created by oxygen-glucose deprivation followed by reoxygenation (OGD/Reox) in vitro and whether this effect can be mediated through the modulation of aquaporin4 (AQP4) expression in the plasma membrane (PM) and phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (MAPK) pathway. Our results showed that OGD/Reox produced increase in cell volume, morphological swelling, and mitochondrial swelling. These changes were associated with the up-regulation of AQP4 in PM and the over-activation of MAPK. Silencing AQP4 expression using small interfering ribonucleic acid for AQP4 was found to block astrocytic swelling. Inhibition of the over-activation of MAPK mitigated the PM AQP4 overabundance and cellular swelling. As expected, treatment with rhEPO significantly reduced the OGD/Reox-induced increase in cell volume, morphological swelling, and mitochondrial swelling as well as the up-regulation of AQP4 in PM. In addition, cultures treated with the neutralizing anti-EPO antibody worsened the PM AQP4 abundance and cellular swelling, abolishing the protective effects mediated by rhEPO treatment. Furthermore, the over-activation of these MAPK after OGD/Reox was attenuated by rhEPO treatment significantly. In conclusion, our data strongly suggest that rhEPO can protect astrocytes from swelling caused by ischemia and reperfusion-like injury. This neuroprotective capacity is partially mediated by diminishing the MAPK-activity-dependent overabundance of AQP4 in PM.",

However, delivering the therapeutic gene to a sufficient number of tumor cells able to trigger a complete response remains a challenge. Target-specific delivery of adenovirus to fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) has been obtained in a variety of tumor models and has been shown to highly increase transduction efficiency. In the present paper we have tested the therapeutic outcome of retargeting the adenoviral vector, Ad-CYP2B1, to FGFRs, using an FGF2-Fab' conjugate, in pancreatic cancer models. First, we show a heterogeneous subcellular distribution of overexpressed FGFR-1 in pancreatic cancer cells. Higher transduction efficiency was observed in five of the six cell lines studied after FGF2-AdGFPLuc infection. Interestingly, an association between FGFR-1 membrane cell expression and viral entry was found. Moreover, tumors injected with FGF2-AdGFPLuc showed enhanced and persistent transgene expression. Importantly, we demonstrate the relevant enhanced cytotoxic effect of the FGF2-Ad-CYP2B]/CPA system in four of the six cell lines studied. Moreover, retargeting Ad-CYP2B1/CPA to FGFRs resulted in a potent antitumoral effect and in an increased survival rate, in two human pancreatic xenograft models. Thus, our results indicate that redirecting adenoviruses to FGFRs highly increases the potency of the suicide system CYP2B1/CPA. Consequently, it may constitute a promising approach to the treatment of patients with pancreatic tumors, in which a high proportion of FGF receptors precisely localize to the plasma membrane.",

There are four FGFR family members, FGFR-1-4, and understanding the ability of these receptors to transduce signals is central to understanding how they function in controlling differentiation and development. We have utilized signal transduction by FGF-1 in PC12 cells to compare the ability of FGFR-1 and FGFR-3 to elicit the neuronal phenotype. In PC12 cells FGFR-1 is much more potent in the induction of neurite outgrowth than FGFR-3. This correlated with the ability of FGFR-1 to induce robust and sustained activation of the Ras-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. In contrast, FGFR-3 could not induce strong sustained Ras-dependent signals. In this study, we analyzed the ability of FGFR-3 to induce the expression of sodium channels, peripherin, and Thy-1 in PC12 cells because all three of these proteins are known to be induced via Ras-independent pathways. We determined that FGFR-3 was capable of inducing several Ras-independent gene expression pathways important to the neuronal phenotype to a level equivalent of that induced by FGFR-1.

However, the direct association between FGFR-1 and SFK and the involvement of SFK in FGFR-1-dependent cell proliferation have been controversial. Structural variants of FGFR-1 are generated by alternative splicing which results in two major isoforms, containing either three (FGFR-1alpha) or two (FGFR-1beta) immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular region. To determine whether alternatively spliced FGFR-1 isoforms differentially activate SFK, we have examined FGF receptor-negative endothelial cells stably transfected with human cDNA encoding either FGFR-1alpha or FGFR-1beta. Transient activation of c-YES, the predominant SFK expressed in these endothelial cells, was restricted to FGFR-1beta transfectants following exposure to acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-1). Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that c-YES directly associated with FGFR-1beta. The Src homology (SH)2 domain (and not the SH3 domain) of c-YES was able to recognize tyrosine phosphorylated FGFR-1beta. FGFR-1beta-specific activation of c-YES was accompanied by its association with and activation of cortactin. FGF-1 treatment of both FGFR-1alpha and FGFR-1beta transfectants induced SFK-independent cellular proliferation and growth in low density cultures. At high density, under both anchorage-dependent and -independent conditions, FGF-1 failed to induce proliferation and growth of FGFR-1alpha transfectants. In contrast, FGF-1 induced proliferation, growth, and formation of cord-like structures in high density cultures of FGFR-1beta transfectants in an SFK-dependent manner. In vitro cord formation on Matrigel was restricted to FGFR-1beta transfectants in an SFK-dependent manner. Formation of vascular structures in vivo was limited to endothelial cells transfected with FGFR-1beta.

The computerized tomography scan of the brain revealed porencephalic cyst, cerebral calcifications and atrophy of right brain. The histopathology of the skin lesions showed lipomatous hamartoma and features of non scarring alopecia. The constellation of these findings and in adherence to the diagnostic criteria of ECCL proposed in 2009, we consider this report as a definite case of ECCL.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The aim of this study was to investigate changes in hemichannel activity during in vitro simulated ischemia [oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)] and the contribution of hemichannels to ischemia-reperfusion injury in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. Dye uptake assays showed that hemichannels opened as OGD progressed, peaking after 1 h, and then closed, returning to the pre-OGD state after 2 h of OGD. The increase in dye uptake after 1 h of OGD was inhibited by hemichannel blockers (lanthanum chloride and a connexin 43 mimetic peptide, Gap26). During OGD, intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) began to increase after 1 h and reached several micromolar after 2 h. After 1 h of OGD, Gap26 inhibited the increases in hemichannel activity and [Ca(2+)](i). In contrast, dantrolene [an endo(sarco)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release inhibitor] suppressed the increase in [Ca(2+)](i), but not in hemichannel activity. After 2 h of OGD, the combined administration of 2',4'-dichlorobenzamil and dantrolene reduced [Ca(2+)](i) to <1 microM and increased hemichannel activity to the level attained after 1 h of OGD. Simulated ischemia-reperfusion, induced by 1 h of OGD followed by 2 h of recovery, reduced cell viability to 54% of the control level. The addition of Gap26 to OGD medium improved viability to 80% of the control level. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that 1) hemichannels open transiently during OGD, 2) closure of hemichannels, but not their opening, is regulated by an increase in [Ca(2+)](i) during OGD, and 3) open hemichannels contribute to cell injury during recovery from OGD.",

To address this issue, in the present study we investigated whether estrogens were able to induce programmed cell death or apoptosis in osteoclast precursors. To this purpose, a preosteoclastic cell line (FLG 29.1) was cultured in the absence or presence of nanomolar concentrations of 17beta-estradiol (17betaE2). Using time-lapse videomicroscopy, it was shown that 17betaE2 induced FLG 29.1 cell apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, a significant increase in the activity of caspase 3 enzyme and in the number of nuclei undergoing DNA fragmentation was observed in FLG 29.1 cells treated with 17betaE2 compared to untreated cells. Finally, transmission electron microscopy of the treated cells showed typical apoptotic morphology. These data indicate that 17betaE2 is able to promote in vitro apoptosis in preosteoclastic cells and suggest that estrogenic molecules may exert in vivo a direct role in negatively modulating the pool of undifferentiated bone marrow cells capable ultimately of maturing into osteoclasts.",

Recently a subunit of F0F1-ATP synthase, oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein, was identified as a new estradiol-binding protein. Estradiol could directly modulate mitochondrial ATP synthase activity through this subunit. In addition, intracellular ATP levels play a role in apoptotic death, which is an energy-dependent process requiring functioning mitochondria. Here we examined the effect of 17 beta-estradiol on F0F1-ATP synthase directly (in permeabilized cells) and in intact osteoclastic FLG 29.1 cells, a model of inducible apoptosis. The baseline F0F1-ATP synthase activity of FLG 29.1 cells was 4.485 nmol/min per mg. Estradiol rapidly inhibited F0F1-ATP synthase activity in the physiological range (half-inhibition concentration, IC50, of 30 nmol/l). With 1 nmol/l of estradiol, the inhibition was already significant (8-10% inhibition, p < 0.01) and with 100 nmol/l residual enzyme activity was only 15% (85% inhibition, p < 0.01). In addition, the effect of estradiol appeared to be directed towards F0F1-ATP synthase, since succinate-sustained respiration, uncoupled from the electron transport chain, was unaffected by estradiol. We assayed F0F1-ATP synthase activity in FLG 29.1 cells during inducible apoptosis. No significant difference of ATP synthesis was detected in apoptotic cells versus controls. In conclusion, we showed a new non-genomic effect of estradiol on a key mitochondrial enzyme, which thereby directly modulates cellular energy metabolism.",

These receptors have differential ligand binding capacities and are coupled to diverse signalling pathways. In the present study, we have characterized the ability of FGFR-1-deficient mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells to bind FGF-2 and to proliferate in the absence or presence of exogenous FGF-2. Under the same conditions, we also analysed the differentiation of FGFR-1-deficient ES cells into three dimensional, post-implantation, embryonic tissues, known as embryoid bodies (EBs). We show that the targeted disruption of FGFR-1 leads to a reduced binding of FGF-2 which has no significant effect on the proliferation of undifferentiated ES cells. In addition, lack of functional FGFR-1 in differentiating EBs leads to a reduced expression of the endoderm marker gene alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). This deregulation of the AFP gene correlates with defects in the formation of the visceral endoderm, proper differentiation of the ectoderm and thus the organization of the columnar epithelium, and a block of cavitation. Although the addition of exogenous FGF-2 further reduced the expression of AFPmRNA in differentiating mutant EBs, corresponding morphological changes were not observed.

Although it has been suggested that the sphingolipid may act as a neuroprotector in the cell apoptosis induced by traumatic brain injury, the mechanisms involved in this action are unknown. In this study, the relationship between S1P and neuroprotective effect was studied in an in vitro model of ischemia, maintaining SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells under oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). When cells were treated with 1 microM S1P simultaneously with OGD and recovery, cell viability increases in a dose-response manner. S1P treatment reduces significantly both necrosis and apoptosis cell death. On the other hand, the treatment with specific PKC epsilon (V1-2), prevents S1P protective effect of OGD/recovery-induced necrosis. Moreover, S1P treatment provokes the translocation of PKC epsilon to the mitochondria. From these results, it is reasonable to assume that S1P protection from necrosis is mediated by PKC epsilon. We also studied the action of S1P on mitochondrial inner membrane potential and mitochondrial Ca(2+) levels during ischemia. In this regard, we must point out that S1P treatment reduces the OGD-induced membrane depolarization and also reduces the increase of Ca(2+) in mitochondria during OGD. Results also indicate that mitochondria from OGD treated cells have significantly less ability to resist swelling on Ca(2+) loading than those obtained in presence of oxygen and glucose. Nevertheless, when S1P was added, this resistance increases considerably. These findings suggest that S1P may have a potential role as a neuroprotective agent in brain injury.",

Filaggrin (FLG) loss-of-function is of great significance for barrier impairment in AD and ichthyosis vulgaris (IV), which is commonly associated with AD. The molecular background is, however, complex and various clusters of genes are altered, including inflammatory and epidermal-differentiation genes.;The objective was to study whether the functional and molecular alterations in AD and IV skin depend directly on FLG loss-of-function, and whether FLG genotype determines the type of downstream molecular pathway affected.;Patients with AD/IV (n = 43) and controls (n = 15) were recruited from two Swedish outpatient clinics and a Swedish AD family material with known FLG genotype. They were clinically examined and their medical history recorded using a standardized questionnaire. Blood samples and punch biopsies were taken and trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) and skin pH was assessed with standard techniques. In addition to FLG genotyping, the STS gene was analyzed to exclude X-linked recessive ichthyosis (XLI). Microarrays and quantitative real-time PCR were used to compare differences in gene expression depending on FLG genotype.

The authors have previously demonstrated that TACE is upregulated in rat forebrain slices exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). They have now used rat mixed cortical cultures exposed to OGD or glutamate to study (1) TACE expression and localization, and (2) the effects of TNF-alpha release on cell viability. OGD-or glutamate-caused TNF-alpha release, an effect that was blocked by the TACE inhibitor BB3103 (BB) (0.1-1 micromol/L; control: 1.67 +/- 0.59; OGD: 6.59 +/- 1.52; glutamate: 3.38 +/- 0.66; OGD +/- BB0.1: 3.23 +/- 0.67; OGD +/- BB1: 1.33 +/- 0.22 pg/mL, n = 6, P < 0.05). Assay of TACE activity as well as Western blot showed that TACE expression is increased in OGD-or glutamate-exposed cells. In control cultures, TACE immunoreactivity was present in some microglial cells, whereas, after OGD or glutamate, TACE immunostaining appeared in most microglial cells and in some astrocytes. Conversely, BB3103 (0.1 micromol/L) caused apoptosis after glutamate exposure as shown by annexin and Hoechst 33342 staining and caspase-3 activity, an effect mimicked by the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (caspase activity: glutamate: 5.1 +/- 0.1; glutamate + BB: 7.8 +/- 0.8; glutamate + MG: 11.9 +/- 0.5 pmol. min(-1) mg(-1) protein, n = 4, P < 0.05), suggesting that translocation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB mediates TNF-alpha-induced antiapoptotic effect. Taken together, these data demonstrate that, in rat mixed neuronal-glial cortical cultures exposed to OGD or glutamate, (1) TACE/ADAM17 activity accounts for the majority of TNF-alpha shedding, (2) an increase in glial TACE expression contributes to the rise in TNF-alpha, and (3) TNF-alpha release in this setting inhibits apoptosis via activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB.",

Astrocytes, which are specialized glial cells, exert numerous essential, complex functions in both healthy and diseased central nervous system (CNS) through a process known as reactive astrogilosis. Therefore, the maintenance of glial cell viability may be important because of its role as a key modulator of neuropathological events. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of anthocyanin on the survival of glial cells exposed to oxidative stress. Our results demonstrated that anthocyanin extracts from black soybean increased survival of U87 glioma cells in a dose dependent manner upon oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), accompanied by decrease levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). While treatment cells with anthocyanin extracts or OGD stress individually activated autophagy induction, the effect was significantly augmented by pretreatment cells with anthocyanin extracts prior to OGD. The contribution of autophagy induction to the protective effects of anthocyanin was verified by the observation that silencing the Atg5 expression, an essential regulator of autophagy induction, reversed the cytoprotective effect of anthocyanin extracts against OGD stress. Treatment of U87 cells with rapamycin, an autophagy inducer, increased cell survival upon OGD stress comparable to anthocyanin, indicating that autophagy functions as a survival mechanism against oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity in glial cells. Our results, therefore, provide a rationale for the use of anthocyanin as a preventive agent for brain dysfunction caused by oxidative damage, such as a stroke. ",

The full length fgfr1 gene was cloned by RT-PCR using brain tissue of BALB/c fetal mouse as template and inserted into PCR-Blunt vector, a truncated fgfr1 fragment was produced by site-directed mutagenesis for deleting intracellular phosphorylated domain, then was subcloned into a lentiviral vector and cotransfected into 293FT packaging cells together with envelope plasmid and packaging plasmid by lipofectamine 2000. Viruses were gathered and concentrated using ultracentrifuge, and then transfected into 293FT cells. Expression of EGFP was detected by fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry (FCM), and the truncated FGFR1 protein was detected by Western blot. The results demonstrated that mouse fgfr1 gene was cloned and the lentiviral expression vector LV-IRES-EGFP-Δfgfr1 and control vector LV-IRES-EGFP were successfully constructed.

Furthermore, a quantitative structure-activity relationship analysis of 41 analogs demonstrated that the specific structural substitutions alter their bioactivities. Molecular docking and dynamics simulation analysis indicated the hydrophobic interaction at the FGFR1-D12/D15 interaction was dominant. Evaluation for anti-gastric cancer efficacy of D12 and D15 indicated effective inhibition of cell proliferation, apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest.

OGD induced a time-dependent (0-6 h) increase in bromoenol lactone (BEL)-sensitive iPLA(2) activity, which was suppressed by specific short interfering (si)RNA knockdown of iPLA(2)-VIA. OGD was associated with an increase in iPLA(2)-VIA protein levels, whereas mRNA levels were unchanged. The levels of iPLA(2)-VIB mRNA and protein were not increased by OGD. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis identified a mouse iPLA(2)-VIA homolog to catalytically inactive 50-kDa iPLA(2)-VIA-ankyrin variants previously identified in humans. Both the mRNA and protein levels of this approximately 50-kDa variant were reduced significantly within 1 h following OGD. In C2C12 myoblasts, iPLA(2)-VIA seemed to predominantly reside at the endoplasmatic reticulum, where it accumulated further during OGD. A time-dependent reduction in cell viability during the early OGD period (3 h) was partially prevented by iPLA(2)-VIA knockdown or pharmacological inhibition (10 microM BEL), whereas iPLA(2)-VIA overexpression had no effect on cell viability.

To investigate the effect of hypoxia on the permeability changes, we used a cell culture model of the BBB consisting of a co-culture of brain capillary endothelial cells and glial cells. When endothelial cells from this co-culture model were submitted alone to hypoxic conditions, long exposures (48 h) were necessary to result in an increase in endothelial cell monolayer permeability to [3H]inulin. When endothelial cells were incubated in presence of glial cells, a huge increase in permeability occurred after 9 h of hypoxic conditions. Oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) resulted in a much shorter time (i.e. 2 h) required for an increase in permeability. We have demonstrated that this OGD-induced permeability increase involves a transcellular rather than a paracellular pathway. Conditioned medium experiments showed that glial cells secrete soluble permeability factors during OGD. However, endothelial cells have to be made sensitive by OGD in order to respond to these glial soluble factors.

In the present study, we investigated the protective effect of perampanel, an orally active noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonist, on BBB permeability in an in vitro ischemia model in murine brain endothelial cells (mBECs). The results showed that perampanel significantly attenuated oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced loss of cell viability, release of lactate dehydrogenase, and apoptotic cell death in a dose-dependent manner. Perampanel treatment did not alter the expression and surface distribution of various glutamate receptors. Furthermore, the results of calcium imaging showed that perampanel had no effect on OGD-induced increase in intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations. Treatment with perampanel markedly reduced the paracellular permeability of mBECs after OGD in different time points, as measured by transepithelial electrical resistance assay. In addition, the expression of claudin-5 at protein level, but not at mRNA level, was increased by perampanel treatment after OGD. Knockdown of claudin-5 partially prevented perampanel-induced protection in cell viability and BBB integrity in OGD-injured mBECs. These data show that the noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonist perampanel affords protection against ischemic stroke through caludin-5 mediated regulation of BBB permeability. ",

The basic fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family comprises at least 4 high affinity tyrosine kinase receptors that require syndecans for their function. Mounting evidence indicates that syndecans, that bind both bFGF and their FGFRs, will act as stimulators, whereas syndecans that only bind bFGF will act as inhibitors of signaling by sequestering the growth factor. Recent findings have highlighted the importance of syndecans in urological cancers. The aim of this study is to investigate the expression of bFGF, its receptors (R1 and R2) and syndecans (1-4) in invasive urothelial carcinoma and normal-looking urothelium by Western blotting, RT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry analyses. Interestingly, bFGF, FGFR1 and FGFR2 protein levels statistically increased in bladder cancer tissues. mRNA of FGFR1 and syndecans (1-4), showed a statistically significant increase while an mRNA increase in the other molecules analysed was not significant. bFGF, its receptors and syndecan immunostaining were mainly present in the urothelium both in normal-looking tissues and urothelial neoplastic cells.

Massive production of NO after inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression has been implicated in cell death. This study aimed to characterize bovine cerebral EC death in relation to iNOS expression after oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in vitro.;OGD in bovine cerebral ECs in culture was induced by deleting glucose in the medium and by incubating the cells in a temperature-controlled anaerobic chamber. The extent of cell death was assessed by trypan blue exclusion, MTT assay, and LDH release. ELISA, gel electrophoresis, and staining by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling were used to examine DNA fragmentation. The expression of iNOS mRNA and protein was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, respectively. Nitrotyrosine expression was confirmed with Western blot analysis and immunostaining.;Bovine cerebral EC death was dependent on the duration of OGD and showed selected biochemical, morphological, and pharmacological features suggestive of apoptosis. OGD also induced the expression of iNOS mRNA and protein in bovine cerebral ECs. Increased expression of nitrotyrosine, the product formed by peroxynitrite reaction with proteins, was also detected after OGD. The involvement of iNOS in EC death was suggested by partial reduction of cell death by NO synthase inhibitors, including L-N(G)-(1-iminoethyl)ornithine and nitro-L-arginine, and an NO scavenger, the Fe(2+)-N-methyl-D-glucamine dithiocarbamate complex.;OGD-induced bovine cerebral EC death involves an apoptotic process.

In the mouse, FGF receptor-1 (FGFR1) is expressed in an appropriate spatial and temporal manner to be orchestrating these functions. Mouse embryos homozygous for a mutated Fgfr1 allele (fgfr1(delta tmk)) die early in development, show abnormal growth and aberrant mesodermal patterning. We have performed a chimeric analysis to further study FGFR1 function in the morphogenesis and patterning of the mesodermal germ layer at gastrulation. At E9.5, fgfr1(delta tmk)/fgfr1(delta tmk) cells showed a marked deficiency in their ability to contribute to the extra-embryonic, cephalic, heart, axial and paraxial mesoderm, and to the endoderm of chimeric embryos. Analysis at earlier stages of development revealed that fgfr1(delta tmk)/fgfr1(delta tmk) cells accumulated within the primitive streak of chimeric embryos, and consequently failed to populate the anterior mesoderm and endodermal lineages at their inception. We suggest that the primary defect associated with the fgfr1(delta tmk) mutation is a deficiency in the ability of epiblast cells to traverse the primitive streak. fgfr1(delta tmk)/fgfr1(delta tmk) cells that accumulated within the primitive streak of chimeric embryos tended to form secondary neural tubes. These secondary neural tubes were entirely fgfr1(delta tmk)/fgfr1(delta tmk) cell derived. The adoption of ectopic neural fate suggests that normal morphogenetic movement through the streak is essential not only for proper mesodermal patterning but also for correct determination of mesodermal/neurectodermal cell fates.",

In this study, we investigated the effects of reperfusion after oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD) not only upon neuronal cell death, but also on ultrastructural and biochemical characteristics of postsynaptic density (PSD) protein, in the stratum lucidum of the CA3 area in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. After OGD/reperfusion, neurons were found to be damaged; the organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, dendrites, and synaptic terminals were swollen; and the PSD became thicker and irregular. Ethanolic phosphotungstic acid staining showed that the density of PSD was significantly decreased, and the thickness and length of the PSD were significantly increased in the OGD/reperfusion group compared to the control. The levels of PSD proteins, including PSD-95, NMDA receptor 1, NMDA receptor 2B, and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, were significantly decreased following OGD/reperfusion. These results suggest that OGD/reperfusion induces significant modifications to PSDs in the CA3 area of organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, both morphologically and biochemically, and this may contribute to neuronal cell death and synaptic dysfunction after OGD/reperfusion.",

E., Wang, C. C., Matsuka, Y., and Nishimura, I. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 23691-23697). However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this report, we have demonstrated that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) alone effectively induces mouse BMSC neuronal differentiation. These differentiated neuronal cells exhibit characteristic electrophysiological properties and elevated levels of the neuronal differentiation marker, growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43). To explore possible signaling pathways, we first analyzed the expression of various FGF receptors in mouse BMSCs. FGF receptor-1, -2, and -3 were detected, but only FGFR-1 was shown to be activated by bFGF. Small interfering RNA knock down of FGFR-1 in BMSCs significantly inhibited neuronal differentiation. Moreover, we have shown that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2) is persistently activated and blockage of ERK activity with the ERK-specific inhibitor U0126 prevents neuronal differentiation. It appears that activation of ERK cascade and neuronal differentiation of BMSCs induced by bFGF are independent of Ras activity but require functions of phospholipase C-gamma pathway. Lastly, we examined the role of the immediate-early transcription factors AP-1 and NF-kappaB and have found that phospholipase C-gamma-dependent c-Jun and ERK-dependent c-fos, but not the NF-kappaB, are strongly activated by bFGF, which in turn regulates the neuronal differentiation of BMSCs.",

Following lesions, there was an increase in FGF-2 and FGF receptor (FGFR) immunoreactivities in the area surrounding the lesion in all the treatment groups.

The group of rats that received FGF-2 combined with heparan sulfate showed a larger increase in the same cellular parameters. Our results suggest that the FGF-2/FGFR system is involved in the regulation of astrocytic reactivity and/or proliferation in the brain and its action is potentiated by heparan sulfate.

As an early (2 min) consequence of OGD, evoked synaptic potentials were lost, and K, Cl, P, and Mg concentrations decreased significantly in all morphological compartments. As exposure to in vitro OGD continued, a negative DC shift in interstitial voltage occurred ( approximately 5 min), whereas general elemental disruption worsened in cytoplasm and nucleus (5-42 min). Similar elemental changes were noted in mitochondria, except that Ca levels increased during the first 5 min of OGD and then decreased over the remaining experimental period (12-42 min). Compartmental water content decreased early (2 min), returned to control after 12 min of OGD, and then exceeded control levels at 42 min. After OGD (12 min), perfusion of hippocampal slices with control oxygenated solutions (reoxygenation) for 30 min did not restore synaptic function or improve disrupted elemental composition. Notably, reoxygenated CA1 cell compartments exhibited significantly elevated Ca levels relative to those associated with 42 min of OGD. When slices were incubated at 31 degreesC (hypothermia) during OGD/reoxygenation, neuronal dysfunction and elemental deregulation were minimal.

Since Kv7 potassium channels regulate dopamine release, we investigated the effects of their pharmacological modulation on dopamine efflux, measured by fast cyclic voltammetry (FCV), and neurotoxicity, in Wistar rat caudate brain slices undergoing oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). The Kv7 activators retigabine and ICA27243 delayed the onset, and decreased the peak level of dopamine efflux induced by OGD; and also decreased OGD-induced damage measured by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Retigabine also reduced OGD-induced necrotic cell death evaluated by lactate dehydrogenase activity assay. The Kv7 blocker linopirdine increased OGD-evoked dopamine efflux and OGD-induced damage, and attenuated the effects of retigabine. Quantitative-PCR experiments showed that OGD caused an ~6-fold decrease in Kv7.2 transcript, while levels of mRNAs encoding for other Kv7 subunits were unaffected; western blot experiments showed a parallel reduction in Kv7.2 protein levels. Retigabine also decreased the peak level of dopamine efflux induced by L-glutamate, and attenuated the loss of TTC staining induced by the excitotoxin.

The present study investigated the in vivo protective effect of geniposide on ischemia/reperfusion-injured rats by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and the inhibitory effects of geniposide and mechanisms against activation of microglial cells by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in vitro. Male SD rats were subjected to treatment with geniposide at 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg immediately after MCAO. Cerebral infarct volume and microglial cell activation were assessed following 24 h reperfusion. Cultured primary rat microglial cells were exposed to geniposide at the concentrations of 12.5, 25 and 50 μg/mL during 4 h of OGD. The effects of geniposide were evaluated in terms of (1) cell viability; (2) secretion of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 into culture media; (3) TLR4 mRNA expression; (4) protein expression of TLR4, p-ERK1/2, p-IκB, p-p38, nuclear and cytoplasmic fraction NF-κB p65; and (5) nuclear transfer of NF-κB p65. Geniposide reduced the infarct volume and inhibited the activation of microglial cells in ischemic penumbra in vivo. OGD increased cell viability and release of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10, these effects were suppressed by geniposide. Geniposide also attenuated the increases in the OGD-induced TLR4 mRNA and protein levels. In addition, geniposide at 25 and 50 μg/mL downregulated the phosphorylation of ERK, IκB and p38, as well as inhibited nuclear transcriptional activity triggered via NF-κB p65 in microglial cells by OGD.

Previous studies have suggested that propofol may be involved in neuroprotection by preventing brain edema. In this study, we examined the effects of propofol on edema and assessed its neuroprotective actions in an oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) model of cultured rat astrocytes. We assessed the effects of propofol on AQP4 expression and the possible role of the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway on this effect.;Neocortical astrocytes were exposed to OGD in an anaerobic chamber. After 6 h of OGD exposure, astrocytes were subsequently subjected to 24 h of reoxygenation. Propofol was added during the OGD phase of the model. Cell morphology was assessed by light microscopy. Astrocyte viability was assessed by measuring 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide absorbency (optical density value) and the percentage of lactate dehydrogenase released by injured astrocytes. AQP4 expression was evaluated with Western blot analysis. To investigate the possible mechanism of propofol's effects on AQP4 expression, cultured astrocytes were pretreated for 24 h with the PKC activator, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, before the propofol treatment/OGD 6 h/reoxygenation 24 h.;We found by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide testing that astrocyte viability began to decrease after about 4 h of OGD exposure and decreased to 60% after 6 h of OGD. When 6 h of OGD was followed by 24 h of reoxygenation, cell viability was further decreased. AQP4 expression was attenuated after 6 h of OGD exposure but was reversed and exceeded baseline levels after 24 h of reoxygenation. Propofol dose-dependently reduced cell death assessed by lactate dehydrogenase test (P < 0.05), and 10 muM propofol significantly down-regulated AQP4 expression in astrocytes after 6 h of OGD followed by 24 h of reoxygenation (P < 0.01).

Objective This study aimed to investigate the post-ischaemic neuroprotective effect of SMND-309, a novel metabolite of salvianolic acid, on differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. Materials and methods SH-SY5Y cells were differentiated by pre-treating with 5 μM all-trans-retinoic acid for 6 d. The differentiated SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) for 2 h and reperfusion (R) for 24 h to induce OGD/R injury. After OGD injury, differentiated SH-SY5Y cells were treated with or without SMND-309 (5, 10, 20 μM) for another 24 h. Cell viability was detected through Cell counting kit-8 assay and lactate dehydrogenase leakage assay. Apoptosis was evaluated through flow cytometry, caspase-3 activity assay. Changes in protein levels were assessed through Western blot. Results SMND-309 ameliorated the degree of injury in the differentiated SH-SY5Y cells by increasing cell viabilities (5 μM, 65.4% ± 4.1%; 10 μM, 69.8% ± 3.7%; 20 μM, 75.3% ± 5.1%) and by reducing LDH activity (20 μM, 2.5 fold) upon OGD/R stimulation. Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide staining results suggested that apoptotic rate of differentiated SH-SY5Y cells decreased from 43.8% induced by OGD/R injury to 19.2% when the cells were treated with 20 μM SMND-309. SMND-309 significantly increased the Bcl-2 level of the injured differentiated SH-SY5Y cells but decreased the caspase-3 activity of these cells by 1.6-fold. In contrast, SMND-309 did not affect the Bax level of these cells. SMND-309 evidently increased the protein expression of BDNF when Akt and CREB were activated. This function was antagonized by the addition of LY294002. Conclusion SMND-309 can prevent neuronal cell death in vitro. This process may be related to the activation of the PI3K/Akt/CREB-signalling pathway. ",

Activation of epsilonPKC increased in neuronal cultures in response to the ischemia-like insult of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). Isozyme-specific peptide activators or inhibitors of PKC were applied at various times before, during and after the OGD period. Neuron-astrocyte mixed cultures pretreated with a selective epsilonPKC activator peptide showed a significant reduction in neuronal injury after OGD and reperfusion, compared to cultures pretreated with control peptide. The epsilonPKC activator peptide counteracted the increased damage induced by pretreatment with the epsilonPKC-selective inhibitor peptide in relatively pure neuronal cultures subjected to OGD. Neither epsilonPKC activator nor inhibitor peptides affected injury of neurons when applied after OGD onset. In contrast, the betaIPKC-selective inhibitor peptide increased injury in astrocyte cultures exposed to OGD at all application times tested.

Beyond a shortage of essential metabolites, ischemia triggers many interconnected pathophysiological events, including excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis. Here, we investigated the neuroprotective mechanisms of JM-20, a novel synthetic molecule, focusing on the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt survival pathway and glial cell response as potential targets of JM-20. For this purpose, we used organotypic hippocampal slice cultures exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) to achieve ischemic/reperfusion damage in vitro. Treatment with JM-20 at 0.1 and 10 μM reduced PI incorporation (indicative of cell death) after OGD. OGD decreased the phosphorylation of Akt (pro-survival) and GSK 3β (pro-apoptotic), resulting in respective inhibition and activation of these proteins. Treatment with JM20 prevented the reduced phosphorylation of these proteins after OGD, representing a shift from pro-apoptotic to pro-survival signaling. The OGD-induced activation of caspase-3 was also attenuated by JM-20 treatment at 10 μM. Moreover, in cultures treated with JM-20 and exposed to OGD conditioning, we observed a decrease in activated microglia, as well as a decrease in interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α release into the culture medium, while the level of the anti-inflammatory IL-10 increased. GFAP immunostaining and IB4 labeling showed that JM-20 treatment significantly augmented GFAP immunoreactivity after OGD, when compared with cultures exposed to OGD only, suggesting the activation of astroglial cells. Our results confirm that JM-20 has a strong neuroprotective effect against ischemic injury and suggest that the mechanisms involved in this effect may include the modulation of reactive astrogliosis, as well as neuroinflammation and the anti-apoptotic cell signaling pathway.

Several FLG mutations, including 3321delA, E2422X, K4671X, S2554X, and R501X, occur frequently in Chinese and Japanese populations.

The R501X null mutation was detected in only one child with AD (0.1%). Children with AD had the 3321delA deletion significantly more frequently (2.4%) than the control subjects (0.0%, P<0.001). Children with AD also had a significantly higher combined allele frequency of the three FLG null mutations (2.6%) than the controls (0.0%, P<0.001). The 3321delA null mutation did not associate significantly with AD severity (P=0.842). When the patients with AD were divided into allergic AD and non-allergic AD patient groups, these two groups did not differ in terms of the frequency of 3321delA.;The Korean children had a lower frequency of FLG mutations than European populations.

Here we study the expression of the flg variant of FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) during lens development by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridisation. FGFR1 was expressed throughout lens development. Prominent FGFR1 immunoreactivity was associated with cell nuclei, particularly in differentiating lens fibres, suggesting internalisation and nuclear translocation of the receptor. FGFR1 immunoreactivity was also associated with basolateral membranes of cells in the equatorial region and at lens sutures. FGFR1 mRNA was only weakly expressed during early lens morphogenesis but expression increased with the onset of lens fibre differentiation. Once the lens acquired its distinct polarity, an anteroposterior gradient in both protein reactivity and mRNA signal was evident. Anteriorly, central epithelial cells showed weak expression for FGFR1, whereas more posteriorly, in the germinative and transitional zones of the lens where cells maximally proliferate and undergo early stages of fibre differentiation, respectively, expression was significantly stronger. The anteroposterior gradient of increased expression of FGFR1 in the lens coincides with the previously documented anteroposterior gradient of FGF stimulation. In lens epithelial explants, FGF stimulation was found to upregulate FGFR1 expression. Such upregulation may be an important mechanism for generating a high level of FGF stimulation and ensuring a fibre differentiation response. In postnatal rat lenses, there was a significant age-related decline in FGFR1 expression; this correlates with the reduced rate of lens fibre differentiation with age. Overall, these studies support the hypothesis that FGF and FGFR1 are important for regulation of lens fibre differentiation throughout lens development.",

The purpose of this study was to assess a non-selective opioid receptor agonist, biphalin, in decreasing reducing brain edema formation using both in vitro and in vivo models of stroke. For the in situ model of ischemia, hippocampal slices were exposed to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) conditions and we observed that hippocampal water content was increased, compared to normoxia. Treatment with the mu agonist, Tyr-D-Ala', N-CH, -Phe4, Glyol-Enkephalin (DAMGO), delta opioid agonists, D-pen(2), D-phe(5) enkephalin (DPDPE), and kappa agonist, U50 488, all significantly decreased brain slice water gain. Interestingly, the non-selective agonist, biphalin, exhibited a statistically significant (P<0.01) greater effect in decreasing water content in OGD-exposed hippocampal slices, compared with mu, delta, and kappa selective opioid agonists. Moreover, biphalin exhibited anti-edematous effects in a dose responsive manner. The non-selective opioid antagonist, naloxone, returned the water content nearly back to original OGD values for all opioid agonist treatments, supporting that these effects were mediated by an opioid receptor pathway. Furthermore, biphalin significantly decreased edema (53%) and infarct (48%) ratios, and neuronal recovery from stroke, compared with the vehicle-treated groups in a 12h permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of focal ischemia. Biphalin also significantly decreased the cell volume increase in primary neuronal cells exposed to OGD condition. These data suggest that opioid receptor activation may provide neuroprotection during stroke and further investigations are needed in the development of novel opioid agonist as efficacious treatments for brain ischemia.",

Type-1 interferons (IFNs) are a super-family of pleiotropic cytokines that regulate pro-inflammatory gene transcription via the classical Jak/Stat pathway; however their role in hypoxia-ischaemia and central nervous system neuro-inflammation remains unknown. Using an in vitro approach, this study investigated the role of type-1 IFN signalling in an inflammatory setting induced by oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD).;Human BE(2)M17 neuroblastoma cells or cells expressing a type-1 interferon-α receptor 1 (IFNAR1) shRNA or negative control shRNA knockdown construct were subjected to 4.5 h OGD and a time-course reperfusion period (0 to 24 h). Q-PCR was used to evaluate IFNα, IFNβ, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α cytokine expression levels. Phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)-1, STAT-3 and cleavage of caspase-3 was detected by western blot analysis. Post-OGD cellular viability was measured using a MTT assay.;Elevated IFNα and IFNβ expression was detected during reperfusion post-OGD in parental M17 cells. This correlated with enhanced phosphorylation of STAT-1, a downstream type-1 IFN signalling mediator. Significantly, ablation of type-1 IFN signalling, through IFNAR1 knockdown, reduced IFNα, IFNβ, IL-6 and TNF-α expression in response to OGD. In addition, MTT assay confirmed the IFNAR1 knockdown cells were protected against OGD compared to negative control cells with reduced pro-apoptotic cleaved caspase-3 levels.;This study confirms a role for type-1 IFN signalling in the neuro-inflammatory response following OGD in vitro and suggests its modulation through therapeutic blockade of IFNAR1 may be beneficial in reducing hypoxia-induced neuro-inflammation.",

We have previously shown that FGFR-1, but not of FGFR-4, ectopically expressed in BaF3 lymphoid cells allows for proliferation in response to FGFs, and that the intracellular signaling halves of these two receptors distinguish their mitogenic potentials (Wang et al., 1994). In order to map the residues which functionally distinguish these receptors, a panel of chimeric receptors whose cytodomains bear different contributions from FGFR-1 and FGFR-4 were constructed and characterized. The behavior of these chimeras implicate amino acids from both the kinase insert and kinase domains in receptor-mediated proliferation. Specifically, two tyrosine residues present in the short kinase insert domain of FGFR-1 and absent from FGFR-4 are a necessary, but not sufficient, component of a fully mitogenic receptor, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation in the kinase insert promotes a mitogenic signaling pathway. A strongly mitogenic receptor also requires one or two FGFR-1-specific residues from either of two regions within the kinase domain. One of these regions is within the kinase domain's activation loop, where FGFR-1, but not FGFR-4, bears a key aspartate residue. The mitogenic potentials of FGFR-1, FGFR-4, and the chimeric receptors strongly correlates with the magnitude of ligand-induced receptor autophosphorylation in BaF3 cells. We discuss mechanisms by which these few key amino acid differences may determine the levels of ligand-induced FGF receptor autophosphorylation and mitogenic potency.",

Research in perinatal stroke, a leading cause of lifelong disability, has implicated MG as targets for therapeutic intervention during stroke. Although MG responses are complex, work in developing rodents suggests that MG limit brain damage after stroke. However, little is known about how energy-limiting conditions affect MG survival and mobility (motility and migration) in developing brain tissues. Here, we used confocal time-lapse imaging to monitor MG viability and mobility during hypoxia or oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in hippocampal tissue slices derived from neonatal GFP-reporter mice (CX3CR1(GFP/+) ). We found that MG remain viable for at least 6 h of hypoxia but begin to die after 2 h of OGD, while both hypoxia and OGD reduce MG motility. Unexpectedly, some MG retain or recover motility during OGD and can engulf dead cells. Additionally, MG from younger neonates (P2-P3) are more resistant to OGD than those from older ones (P6-P7), indicating increasing vulnerability with developmental age. Finally, transient (2 h) OGD also increases MG death, and although motility is rapidly restored after transient OGD, it remains below control levels for many hours. Together, these results show that MG in neonatal mouse brain tissues are vulnerable to both transient and sustained OGD, and many MG die within hours after onset of OGD. Preventing MG death may, therefore, provide a strategy for promoting tissue restoration after stroke.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The unravelling of the genetic basis of the hypogonadotrophic hypogonadal disorders, including Kallmann syndrome (KS), has led to renewed interest into the developmental biology of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurones and, more generally, into the molecular mechanisms of reproduction. KS is characterised by the association of GnRH deficiency with diminished olfaction. Until recently, only two KS-associated genes were known: KAL1 and KAL2. KAL1 encodes the cell membrane and extracellular matrix-associated secreted protein anosmin-1 which is implicated in the X-linked form of KS. Anosmin-1 shows high affinity binding to heparan sulphate (HS) and its function remains the focus of ongoing investigation, although a role in axonal guidance and neuronal migration, which are processes essential for normal GnRH ontogeny and olfactory bulb histogenesis, has been suggested. KAL2, identified as the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) gene, has now been recognised to be the underlying genetic defect for an autosomal dominant form of KS. The diverse signalling pathways initiated upon FGFR activation can elicit pleiotropic cellular responses depending on the cellular context. Signalling through FGFR requires HS for receptor dimerisation and ligand binding. Current evidence supports a HS-dependent interaction between anosmin-1 and FGFR1, where anosmin-1 serves as a co-ligand activator enhancing the signal activity, the finer details of whose mechanism remain the subject of intense investigation. Recently, mutations in the genes encoding prokineticin 2 (PK2) and prokineticin receptor 2 (PKR2) were reported in a cohort of KS patients, further reinforcing the view of KS as a multigenic trait involving divergent pathways. Here, we review the historical and current understandings of KS and discuss the latest findings from the molecular and cellular studies of the KS-associated proteins, and describe the evidence that suggests convergence of several of these pathways during normal GnRH and olfactory neuronal ontogeny.",

The FGFs interact with a family of at least four closely related receptor tyrosine kinases that are products of individual genes. To investigate the role of FGFs in the growth and differentiation of embryonic tissues and to determine whether the individual FGF receptor genes might have specific functions, we compared the localization of mRNA for two FGF receptor genes, FGFR1 (the flg gene product) and FGFR2 (the bek gene product), during limb formation and organogenesis in mouse embryos (E9.5-E16.5). Although the two genes were coexpressed in some tissues, the differential expression of FGFR1 and FGFR2 in most embryonic tissues was striking. FGFR1 was expressed diffusely in mesenchyme of limb buds, somites and organ rudiments. In contrast, FGFR2 was expressed predominantly in the epithelial cells of embryonic skin and of developing organs. The differential expression of FGFR1 and FGFR2 in mesenchyme and epithelium respectively, suggests the receptor genes are independently regulated and that they mediate different functions of FGFs during development.",

During ischemia and traumatic brain injury (TBI), cellular disruption leading to mechanical insult results to the BBB being compromised. Oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) is the most commonly used in vitro model for ischemia. On the other hand, stretch injury is currently being used to model TBI in vitro. In this paper, the two methods are used alone or in combination, to assess their effects on cerebrovascular endothelial cells cEND in the presence or absence of astrocytic factors. Applying severe stretch and/or OGD to cEND cells in our experiments resulted to cell swelling and distortion. Damage to the cells induced release of lactate dehydrogenase enzyme (LDH) and nitric oxide (NO) into the cell culture medium. In addition, mRNA expression of inflammatory markers interleukin (I L)-6, IL-1α, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α also increased. These events could lead to the opening of calcium ion channels resulting to excitotoxicity. This could be demonstrated by increased calcium level in OGD-subjected cEND cells incubated with astrocyte-conditioned medium. Furthermore, reduction of cell membrane integrity decreased tight junction proteins claudin-5 and occludin expression. In addition, permeability of the endothelial cell monolayer increased. Also, since cell damage requires an increased uptake of glucose, expression of glucose transporter glut1 was found to increase at the mRNA level after OGD. Overall, the effects of OGD on cEND cells appear to be more prominent than that of stretch with regards to TJ proteins, NO, glut1 expression, and calcium level. Astrocytes potentiate these effects on calcium level in cEND cells. Combining both methods to model TBI in vitro shows a promising improvement to currently available models. ",

We tested the hypothesis that PPBP protects neurons by a mechanism involving activation of the transcription factor cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (CREB).;Primary cultured cortical neurons were exposed to 2 h of OGD and allowed to recover for 24 h, and PPBP treatment was initiated 15 min before the insult in the presence and absence of the sigma(1)-receptor antagonist rimcazole and inhibitors against protein kinases known to activate signal transduction cascades that result in CREB phosphorylation, such as H89 (protein kinase A inhibitor), LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor), U0126 (MEK1/2 inhibitor), or KN62 calmodulin kinase II inhibitor). Neuronal cell death was assayed by lactate dehydrogenase measurement 24 h after OGD. CREB phosphorylation was measured by immunoblot analysis at 30 min, 1 h, and 3 h of reoxygenation. Blots were quantitatively analyzed using Quantity One image analysis software.;PPBP increased CREB phosphorylation at 1 h after recovery from OGD, which was abolished by rimcazole (1.7 +/- 0.2 in PPBP and 0.8 +/- 0.1 in PPBP plus rimcazole with OGD compared with 0.9 +/- 0.1 in OGD alone, p-CREB/CREB). The PPBP-induced increase in CREB phosphorylation was blocked by H89 (0.5 +/- 0.07) but not U0126, KN62, or LY294002. PPBP treatment prevented OGD-induced cell death and pretreatment with H89 blocked this protection (0.18 +/- 0.02 in PPBP and 0.27 +/- 0.03 in PPBP plus H89 with OGD compared with 0.33 +/- 0.02 in OGD alone, lactate dehydrogenase assay). Pretreatment with LY294002, UO126, or KN62 had no effect on neuronal protection by PPBP.;These data suggest that the mechanism of neuroprotection by PPBP may be linked to CREB phosphorylation.",

Since phosphorylation and consequent inhibition of GSK-3beta by PI-3K/Akt and agonism of PPARgamma have shown to afford neuroprotection in several in vitro and in vivo models, we have studied the potential neuroprotective effect of NP00111 in an \"in vitro\" model of ischemia-reperfusion. NP00111, at the concentration of 10 microM, significantly protected adult rat hippocampal slices subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) for 1 h followed by 3 h re-oxygenation, measured as lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) released to the extracellular media. The protective effects of NP00111 were more pronounced during the re-oxygenation period in comparison to the OGD period. Other GSK-3beta inhibitors like lithium or AR-A014418 did not afford protection in this model. However, the PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone was protective at 3 microM. Protection afforded by NP00111 and rosiglitazone were prevented by the PPARgamma antagonist GW9662, suggesting that both NP00111 and rosiglitazone were preventing cell death caused by oxygen-glucose deprivation via activation of PPARgamma. NP00111 increased by two fold phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and its protective effects were lost when the hippocampal slices were co-incubated with the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor PD98059. In conclusion, the novel TDZD NP00111 was protective against OGD in rat hippocampal slices by a mechanism related to phosphorylation of ERK1/2 via activation of PPARgamma.",

This involves the maturation and death of epidermal keratinocytes as well as the assembly of a complex network of differentially and spatially expressed proteins, glycoproteins and lipids into the keratinocyte cell membrane and surrounding extracellular space. In 2006, the key role of the granular cell layer protein filaggrin (filament-aggregating protein) in maintaining the skin barrier was determined with the identification of loss-of-function mutations in the profilaggrin gene (FLG). These mutations have been shown to be the cause of ichthyosis vulgaris and a major risk factor for the development of atopic dermatitis, asthma associated with atopic dermatitis as well as systemic allergies. Mutations in the FLG gene are extremely common, occurring in approximately 9% of individuals from European populations. The remarkable discovery of these widespread mutations is expected to have a major impact on the classification and management of many patients with ichthyosis and atopic disease. It is also hoped that the genetic discovery of FLG mutations will lead to the future development of more specific, non-immunosuppressive treatments capable of restoring effective skin barrier function and alleviating or preventing disease in susceptible individuals.",

The purpose of this study was to determine whether FGFR-targeted gene therapy is feasible in this disorder. Accordingly, the effects of a conjugate consisting of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 linked to a Fab' fragment against the adenovirus knob region were evaluated in human pancreatic cancer cell lines treated with an adenoviral vector containing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (AdTK) gene. An adenoviral vector containing the firefly luciferase reporter gene (AdLuc) served to assess infection efficiency, and was initially tested in L6 rat myoblasts. In parental L6 cells that express exceedingly low levels of high-affinity FGFRs, transduction with AdLuc was enhanced 7- to 10-fold with the FGF2-Fab' conjugate, whereas in L6 cells transfected to express FGFR-1, it was enhanced 39- to 52-fold. The pancreatic cancer cell lines expressed variable levels of the four high-affinity FGF receptors, and exhibited 2- to 34-fold increases in gene transduction in the presence of the FGF2-Fab' conjugate. In the absence of FGF2-Fab' there was no correlation between surface binding of FGF2 and AdLuc transduction efficiency, whereas in the presence of FGF2-Fab', enhanced AdLuc transduction efficiency correlated with greater surface binding of FGF2. In the absence of AdTK, all the cell lines were insensitive to ganciclovir, whereas after AdTK transduction, only ASPC-1 and PANC-1 cells were resistant to ganciclovir even in the presence of FGF2-Fab'. Ganciclovir-mediated inhibition was dependent on the conjugate in CAPAN-1 and COLO-357 cells, but was independent of the conjugate in T3M4 and MIA-PaCa-2 cells. Real-time quantitative PCR of laser-captured cancer cells revealed high levels of various FGFR mRNA species in six of seven PDAC tumor samples. These findings indicate that transduction efficiency with FGF2-Fab' in pancreatic cancer cells is independent of native adenoviral transduction efficiency and is greatest in cells that exhibit concomitant expression of various high-affinity FGFRs. In view of the overexpression of high-affinity FGFRs in the cancer cells in PDAC, our findings also suggest that the combined use of AdTK, ganciclovir, and FGF2-Fab' may ultimately be a promising therapeutic approach in a subgroup of patients with PDAC.",

We investigated the potential interaction of ATM and NF-kappaB after oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in cerebral endothelial cells (CECs).;Primary cultures of mouse CECs were subjected to OGD in the absence or presence of ATM antisense oligonucleotides or the NF-kappaB inhibitor SN50. ATM expression was determined with the use of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, and NF-kappaB activity was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Cells were assessed for mitochondrial DNA damage with the use of long polymerase chain reaction and were assessed for caspase-3 and caspase-8 activity with the use of fluorogenic substrates. Cell death was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide and LDH release.;OGD stimulated ATM gene expression at the mRNA and protein level in CECs as early as 1 hour after OGD initiation. ATM gene knockdown with the use of an antisense oligonucleotide suppressed OGD-induced ATM protein expression, which was accompanied by an attenuation of NF-kappaB activation and the subsequent expression of downstream genes, including the antiapoptotic gene c-IAP2. ATM knockdown also accentuated OGD-induced mitochondrial DNA damage and the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-8, leading to enhanced CEC death.

Here, we investigated this mechanism by focusing on a DNA damage-sensor, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1). A 2-h oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by reoxygenation (Reox) induced apoptosis, rather than necrosis, in rat cortical neurons. During the Reox, PARP-1 was much activated and autopoly(ADP-ribosyl)ated, consuming the substrate, NAD+. Induction of apoptosis by OGD/Reox was suppressed by overexpression of Bcl-2, indicating mitochondrial impairment in this induction process. Mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), or membrane depolarization, and a release of proapoptotic proteins, i.e. cytochrome c, apoptosis-inducing factor and endonuclease G, from mitochondria were observed during the Reox. These apoptotic changes of mitochondria and the nucleus were attenuated by PARP-1 inhibitors, 1,5-dihydroxyisoquinoline and benzamide, and also by small interfering RNA specific for PARP-1. These results indicated that PARP-1 plays a principal role in inducing mitochondrial impairment that ultimately leads to apoptosis of neurons after cerebral ischemia.",

In recent study, HspB8 has been shown to protect the heart against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury via activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. However, whether this protective effect applied to brain I/R injury remained unexplored. To further test the mechanism of HspB8's effects in brain, we used oxygen-glucose deprivation followed by reperfusion (OGD/R), an in vitro model of ischemia to examine the involvement of PI3K/Akt signaling by treating mouse neuroblastoma cells (N2A cells) (untransfected or transfected with an HspB8 expression vector) with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 before OGD/R. Our results revealed that the apoptosis-suppressing effect of HspB8 was mediated by the PI3K/Akt pathway. Therefore, HspB8 protected the N2A cells against OGD/R insult, possibly by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. ",

As a preliminary step to assessing the potential for using bFGF or its analogs as therapeutic agents, the expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR-1) in the SN of normal and PD cases was investigated immunohistochemically. FGFR-1 immunoreactivity could be detected in DA neurons of the SN in young and old neurologically normal cases with an apparent decline with age.

Therefore, our study evaluated FGFR1-3 alterations as a putative therapeutic target in this subgroup. We analyzed 73 squamous differentiated bladder cancers (n = 10 pT2, n = 55 pT3, n = 8 pT4) for FGFR1-3 protein expression, FGFR1-3 copy number variations, FGFR3 chromosomal rearrangements (fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)) and FGFR3 mutations (SNapShot analysis). Only single cases displayed enhanced protein expression, most frequently FGFR3 overexpression (9.4% (6/64)). FISH showed no amplifications of FGFR1, 2 or 3. Break apart events were only slightly above the cut off in 12.1% (8/66) of cases and no FGFR3-TACC3 rearrangements could be proven by qPCR. FGFR3 mutations (p.S249C) were found in 8.5% (6/71) of tumors and were significantly associated with FGFR3 protein overexpression (p < 0.001), and unfavourable clinical outcome (p = 0.001). Our findings are consistent with the results of the TCGA data set for the \"squamous-like\" subtype of bladder cancer (n = 85), which revealed reduced overall expression of FGFR1 and FGFR2 in tumors compared to normal tissue, while expression of FGFR3 remained high. In the TCGA \"squamous-like\" subtype FGFR3 mutations were found in 4.9% and correlated with high FGFR3 RNA expression. Mutations of FGFR1 and FGFR2 were less frequent (2.4% and 1.2%).

As an important mediator for the non-genomic functions of estrogen, GPER1 (G Protein-coupled Estrogen Receptor 1) has been suggested to involve in the beneficial roles of estrogen in neural cells. Here our studies on primary hippocampal neurons have focused on GPER1 in an in vitro model of ischemia using oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). GPER1 expression in the primary hippocampal neurons was stimulated by the OGD treatments. Both E2 (estradiol) and E2-BSA (membrane impermeable estradiol by covalent conjugation of bovine serum albumin) attenuated OGD-induced cell death in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons. Importantly, this membrane-mediated estrogen function requires GPER1 protein. Knocking down of GPER1 diminished, while overexpression of GPER1 potentiated, the protective roles of E2/E2-BSA following OGD. Additionally, the downstream mechanisms employed by membrane-associated estrogen signaling were found to include PI3K/Akt-dependent Ask1 inhibition in the primary hippocampal neurons. Overall, these research results could enhance our understanding of the neuroprotective actions for estrogen, and provide a new therapeutic target for improving stroke outcome and ameliorating degenerative neurological diseases.

For two of these regions, 8p12 and 10q26, we previously reported the amplification of genes encoding FGF receptors, FGFRI/FLG and FGFR2/BEK, in about 12% of breast tumors. The PLAT gene, encoding the tissue-type plasminogen activator, is also located close to or within the 8p12 region. In the present study, we show that both FGFRI and PLAT can be amplified in breast as well as ovarian carcinomas. FGFRI amplification was detected in 14.5% of breast and 7.8% of ovarian tumors, whereas PLAT was found to be amplified in 15.6% and 19.4% of the tumors, respectively. Each gene could be amplified independently of the other. These data raised the question of which gene is selected for amplification at 8p12. In most cases, the levels of expression of FGFRI and PLAT in breast tumors were comparable to their level of expression in normal mammary tissue. However, FGFRI was expressed above the normal level in a certain number of cases.

Two reviewers screened all articles and included prognostic studies on the molecular biomarkers FGFR1-5 in any type of HNSCC. Relevant studies were assessed on risk of bias using the Quality in Prognostic Studies (QUIPS) tool. Data on FGFR aberrations and survival outcome were extracted from relevant studies. The prognostic value of FGFR aberrations was compared among studies.;The initial search yielded 1568 publications of which 12 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Four studies reported FGFR1 gene amplification (9.3-17.4 %) and FGFR1 protein overexpression (11.8 %) in HNSCC. FGFR1 protein expression by cancer-associated fibroblasts correlated with poor survival outcome in one study (p < 0.01). Eight studies reported high rates of FGFR4 Gly388Arg polymorphisms (32.5-54.2 %) and FGFR4 protein overexpression (16-35 %), with varying correlations with survival. So far, no studies assessed the prognostic role of FGFR2, FGFR3, or FGFR5 in HNSCC.;Significant risk of bias has been identified among included studies. Therefore, cautious interpretation of the results is recommended.;In conclusion, evidence was found for prognostic value of FGFR1 expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts in HNSCC. Prognostic evidence on the other FGFR family members in HNSCC is limited and conflicting. This emphasizes the need for future well-conducted prognostic studies.",

The retina was injured by making an incision through the choroid and retinal pigment epithelium that penetrated the subretinal space of each eye of an adult BALB/c mouse. Retinas were taken 6 hr, 12 hr, 1, 2, 4, 7, 10 and 16 days post-injury. Control animals were without injury. Northern blot analysis was performed to determine bFGF, CNTF and their receptor mRNA levels. A significant increase in bFGF and CNTF mRNAs was observed after injury, along with an increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression. More than 2-fold of upregulation of bFGF mRNA was seen as early as 6 hr after injury. This increase reached a maximum of more than 5-fold at day 2 post-injury and then declined slowly, and was still about 2.5-fold of the control level by day 16. Expression of CNTF showed a small increase of about 1.6-fold at 6 hr after injury. The upregulation reached a peak level of about 2.7-fold at day 4 after injury, then declined to control level by day 16. There was only a very small increase in FGFR-1 at 6, 12 and 24 hr after injury, and no significant increases in FGFR-1 at time points longer than 1 day post-injury. Expression of GFAP followed a time course similar to that of bFGF. We conclude that mechanical injury induces bFGF, CNTF, and GFAP expression in the mouse retina with time courses similar to the upregulation of these molecules in rat retina. Compared to the upregulation in rat retina, however, the injury-induced upregulation of bFGF and GFAP is much less in the mouse retina. In addition, there was only a very small induction of FGFR-1 expression in the mouse retina.

We observed rotational misorientation within the flake in the HRTEM images of 2, 4 and 6 layers of graphene sheets, giving rise to Moiré patterns. By filtering in the frequency domain using a Fourier transform, we reconstruct the graphene lattice of each sheet and determine the relative rotation between consecutive graphene layers up, to six separate sheets. Direct evidence is obtained for FLG sheets with packing that is different to the standard AB Bernal packing of bulk graphite. Furthermore, we observed periodic ripples in suspended graphene sheets in our TEM measurements.

This prospective study aimed to assess the pathological response after preoperative radiochemotherapy (5FU-Navelbine-radiotherapy) for large breast cancers. The expression of FGFR1 and FGF2 in tumor cells were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Tumors in which no staining was seen, were considered as negative for that protein.

We included in the present study all the 32 patients from the S14 cohort for whom the tissue blocks from the biopsy specimens were available with sufficient tumoral tissue. FGFR1 and FGF2 staining were observed respectively in 17 (56%) and 22 (68%) of the 32 tumoral biopsies. The expression of FGFR1 was associated with the hormone receptor positive status (p=0.0191).

Southern blot of RT-PCR products with a 32P-labeled cDNA probe for the human aromatase demonstrated that FLG 29.1 cells express aromatase mRNA. The enzyme activity, determined by measuring [3H]H2O release from [3H]androstenedione, obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetic with apparent Km and Vmax values ranging from 5 to 10 nM and from 200 to 400 fmol/mg protein/6 h.

After 24 h incubation of FLG 29.1 cells in the absence of these stimuli the aromatase mRNA and the protein were barely detectable.

Trehalose was found to inhibit protein aggregation caused by neurodegenerative diseases via induction of autophagy, whereas its effect is still elusive on ischemia-induced protein aggregation. In this study, we investigated this issue by using rat model of transient global ischemia and SH-SY5Y model of OGD. We found that pretreatment with trehalose inhibited transient global ischemia-induced neuronal death in the hippocampus CA1 neurons and OGD-induced death in SH-SY5Y cells, which was associated with inhibition of the formation of ubiquitin-labeled protein aggregates and preservation of proteasome activity. In vitro study showed that the protection of trehalose against OGD-induced cell death and protein aggregation in SH-SY5Y cells was reversed when proteasome activity was inhibited by MG-132. Further studies revealed that trehalose prevented OGD-induced reduction of proteasome activity via suppression of both oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Particularly, our results showed that trehalose inhibited OGD-induced autophagy. Therefore, we demonstrated that proteasome dysfunction contributed to protein aggregation caused by ischemic insults and trehalose prevented protein aggregation via preservation of proteasome activity, not via induction of autophagy.",

After cerebral ischemia and/or reperfusion, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species may be generated by inflammatory cells through several cellular pathways, which can lead to intracellular calcium influx and cell damage. Therefore, we investigated the mechanisms of action of nicotinamide in neuroprotection under conditions of hypoxia/reoxygenation. Results showed that nicotinamide significantly protected rat primary cortical cells from hypoxia by reducing lactate dehydrogenase release with 1 h of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) stress. ROS production and calcium influx in neuronal cells during OGD were dose-dependently diminished by up to 10 mM nicotinamide (p < 0.01). This effect was further examined with OGD/reoxygenation (H/R). Cells were stained with the fluorescent dye 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) or antibodies against anti-microtubule-associated protein-2 and cleaved caspase-3. Apoptotic cells were studied using Western blotting of cytochrome c and cleaved caspase-3. Results showed that vitamin B(3) reduced cell injury, caspase-3 cleavage and nuclear condensation (DAPI staining) in neuronal cells under H/R. In addition, nicotinamide diminished c-fos and zif268 immediate-early gene expressions following OGD. Taken together, these results indicate that the neuroprotective effect of nicotinamide might occur through these mechanisms in this in vitro ischemia/reperfusion model.",

In the present study, we investigated the anti-apoptotic effects of ex-4, as well as the potential mechanisms responsible for these effects in rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) under conditions of oxygen, glucose and serum deprivation (OGD). The apoptosis of the MSCs was induced by subjecting the cells to OGD conditions for 4 h and was detected by Annexin V/PI and Hoechst 33258 staining. The MSCs were pre-conditioned with ex-4 for 12 h prior to being subjected to OGD conditions, and the expression levels of an apoptotic marker (cleaved caspase-3), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers [phosphorylated (p-)protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), PERK, binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF-4) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP)], as well as those of a survival marker (Bcl-2) were measured by western blot analysis. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of ATF-4 and CHOP were determined by RT-qPCR. ELISA was used to examine the activity of intracellular cAMP. Moreover, the GLP-1R antagonist, exendin9-39 (ex9-39), the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, H89, and small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting rat ATF-4 and CHOP were co-incubated with the MSCs. The apoptotic rate was markedly diminished following pre-conditioning with ex-4 in a dose‑dependent manner (P<0.05). The ER stress markers, p-PERK, BIP, ATF-4 and CHOP, were upregulated in the cells subjected to OGD conditions. Ex-4 pre-conditioning significantly decreased the mRNA and protein levels of ATF-4 and CHOP (P<0.05), and increased the activity of intracellular cAMP (P<0.05). Furthermore, the anti-apoptotic effects of ex-4 were almost reversed by treatment with either H89 or ex9-39 (P<0.05); transfection with siRNA-CHOP significantly reduced the apoptotic rate of the MSCs and did not impair the cytoprotective effects of ex-4. Taken together, these findings suggest that ex-4 protects rat BM-MSCs from OGD-induced apoptosis through the activation of the PKA/cAMP pathway and the attenuation of the ER stress signaling pathway. Ex-4 may thus prove to be a therapeutic agent with the potential to improve the viability of MSCs in the ischemic milieu, and consequently, to optimize the therapeutic effects of MSC therapy in acute myocardial infarction.",

The reactivity of the selected scFvs with a recombinant FGFR3 was characterized by an enzyme immunoassay and surface plasmon resonance analysis and with RT112 bladder carcinoma cells by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. The capacity of the selected scFvs to block RT112 cell proliferation was determined.;We have isolated six human scFv antibody fragments directed against FGFR3. These human scFvs specifically bound FGFR3, but not the homologous molecule FGFR1. Biacore analysis was used to determine the affinity constants, which ranged from 12 to 40 nmol/L. Competition analysis showed that the FGF9 ligand was able to block the binding of two scFvs, 3C and 7D, to FGFR3, whereas FGF1 only blocked 7D. Immunoprecipitation and flow cytometric analysis confirmed the specificity of the antibodies to native membrane FGFR3. Two scFvs, 3C and 7D, gave an strong immunofluorescence staining of RT112 cells. Moreover, they recognized equally well wild-type and mutant FGFR3 containing the activating mutation S249C.

During cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, DRAM1 protein expression is increased, and autophagy is activated. However, the functional significance of DRAM1 and the relationship between DRAM1 and autophagy in brain I/R remains uncertain. The aim of this study is to investigate whether DRAM1 mediates autophagy activation in cerebral I/R injury and to explore its possible effects and mechanisms. We adopt the oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) Neuro-2a cell model to mimic cerebral I/R conditions in vitro, and RNA interference is used to knock down DRAM1 expression in this model. Cell viability assay is performed using the LIVE/DEAD viability/cytotoxicity kit. Cell phenotypic changes are analyzed through Western blot assays. Autophagy flux is monitored through the tandem red fluorescent protein-Green fluorescent protein-microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 (RFP-GFP-LC3) construct. The expression levels of DRAM1 and microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3II/I (LC3II/I) are strongly up-regulated in Neuro-2a cells after OGD/R treatment and peaked at the 12 h reperfusion time point. The autophagy-specific inhibitor 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) inhibits the expression of DRAM1 and LC3II/I and exacerbates OGD/R-induced cell injury. Furthermore, DRAM1 knockdown aggravates OGD/R-induced cell injury and significantly blocks autophagy through decreasing autophagosome-lysosome fusion. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that DRAM1 knockdown in Neuro-2a cells inhibits autophagy by blocking autophagosome-lysosome fusion and exacerbated OGD/R-induced cell injury. Thus, DRAM1 might constitute a new therapeutic target for I/R diseases.",

Mice underwent 2-h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and reperfusion, and the infarct volume was determined with TTC staining.

Similar changes were observed in OGD/R-treated N2a cells, but the mRNA level of Hax-1 was not changed. Furthermore, in OGD/R-treated N2a cells, knockdown of Omi significantly increased Hax-1 protein level.

The evaluation was made 1 and 5 days after exposure to wide-band noise with two increasing levels of acoustic energy. For both factors, the immunoreactivity was shown predominantly in the middle part of basilar papilla, in noise-exposed, but not control birds. It was localized in the cytoplasm of hair cells, nuclei of supporting cells and cytoplasm of ganglion cells. Strong immunoreactivity of bFGFR and NGFR was found both in control and noise-exposed animals, with the cell localization similar to that of growth factors. The increase in mRNA expression for bFGF and NGF was found in noise-exposed animals only after lower exposure to noise, on day 5 after exposure (p<0.01). A lack of increased expression after higher exposure could be excused by larger damage of hair cells followed by the increase of mRNA for beta-actin to which the results were referred.

We have previously shown that glutamate receptors mediate hypoxic-ischemic injury to oligodendroglial precursor cells (OPCs) in a model of PVL in the developing rodent brain. We used primary OPC cultures to examine the mechanism of cellular toxicity induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) to simulate brain ischemia. OPCs were more sensitive to OGD-induced toxicity than mature oligodendrocytes, and OPC toxicity was attenuated by nonselective [2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzo[f]quinoxaline (NBQX), 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione], alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-preferring (GYKI 52466), kainate-preferring (gamma-d-glutamylaminomethanesulfonic acid), or Ca2+-permeable AMPA/kainate receptor antagonists (joro spider toxin, JSTx) administered either during or after OGD. Furthermore, NBQX or JSTx blocked OGD-induced Ca2+ influx. Relevant to recurrent hypoxic-ischemic insults in developing white matter, we examined the effects of sublethal OGD preconditioning. A prior exposure of OPCs to sublethal OGD resulted in enhanced vulnerability to subsequent excitotoxic or OGD-induced injury associated with an increased Ca2+ influx. AMPA/kainate receptor blockade with NBQX or JSTx either during or after sublethal OGD prevented its priming effect. Furthermore, OGD preconditioning resulted in a down-regulation of the AMPA receptor subunit GluR2 on cell surface that increased Ca2+ permeability of the receptors. Overall, these data suggest that aberrantly enhanced activation of Ca2+-permeable AMPA/kainate receptors may be a major mechanism in acute and repeated hypoxic-ischemic injury to OPCs in disorders of developing cerebral white matter, such as PVL.",

Recently, it is well established that Hsp20 can enhance cardiac function and render cardioprotection. However, the potential benefits of Hsp20 and its phosphorylation form action on ischemic stroke and its underlying mechanism(s) are largely unknown.To investigate whether Hsp20 exerts protective effects in vitro ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, mouse neuroblastoma cells were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and reoxygenation. Expression mRNA and protein levels of Hsp20 were strongly downregulated in mouse N2A cells at the 0-hour and 6-hour recovery time points following 4 hours of OGD, and returned to basal level 12 and 24 hours after OGD treatment. The ratio of phosphorylated to total Hsp20 protein was not significantly affected by OGD treatment at the 0-hour and 6-hour recovery time points following 4 hours of OGD. However, markedly higher serine phosphorylation of Hsp20 was observed 12 and 24 hours after OGD treatment. Furthermore, overexpression of Hsp20 reduced OGD-induced apoptosis by reducing the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol. However, blockade of Hsp20 phosphorylation at Ser16 abrogated this anti-apoptotic effect.Our data demonstrate that increased Hsp20 expression in mouse N2A neuroblastoma cells protects against I/R injury, resulting in reduced apoptosis, which is by reducing the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol. Phosphorylation of Ser16 plays an important role in its protective effect. Thus, Hsp20 may constitute a new therapeutic target for cerebral ischemic diseases.",

Accordingly, astrocytic death due to various types of injury can critically influence neuronal survival. The exact pathway of cell death after brain ischemia is under debate. In the present study, we used astrocytes from rat primary culture treated with persistent oxygen-glucose-deprivation (OGD) as a model of ischemia to examine the pathway of cell death and the relevant mechanisms. We observed changes in the cellular morphology, the energy metabolism of astrocytes, and the percentage of apoptosis or oncosis of the astrocytes induced by OGD. Electron microscopy revealed the co-existence of ultrastructural features in both apoptosis and oncosis in individual cells. The cellular ATP content was gradually decreased and the percentages of apoptotic and oncotic cells were increased during OGD. After 4h of OGD, ATP depletion to less than 35% of the control was observed, and oncosis became the primary pathway for astrocytic death. Increased plasma membrane permeability due to oncosis was associated with increased calpain-mediated degradation of several cytoskeletal proteins, including paxillin, vinculin, vimentin and GFAP. Pre-treatment with the calpain inhibitor 3-(4-iodophenyl)-2-mercapto-(Z)-2-propenoic acid (PD150606) could delay the OGD-induced astrocytic oncosis. These results suggest that there is a narrow range of ATP that determines astrocytic oncotic death induced by persistent OGD and that calpain-mediated hydrolysis of the cytoskeletal-associated proteins may contribute to astrocytes oncosis.",

In regard to the hippocampus, previous studies have mainly focused on CA1 pyramidal neurons, which are very vulnerable to ischemia. But the dentate gyrus (DG), in which neuronal proliferation occurs, can also be damaged by ischemia. In this study, we explored the neuroprotective effect of postischemic hypothermia in different areas of the hippocampus after mild or severe ischemia. Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures were prepared from 6- to 8-day-old rats and maintained for 12 days. Cultures were exposed to 25 or 35 min of oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). Neuronal damage was quantified after 6, 24, 48, and 72 h by propidium iodide fluorescence. Mild hypothermia (33°C) was induced 1 h after the end of OGD and was maintained for a period of 24 h. Short OGD produced delayed neuronal damage in the CA1 area and in the DG and to a lesser extend in the CA3 area. Damage in CA1 pyramidal cells was totally prevented by hypothermia whereas neuroprotection was limited in the DG. Thirty-five-minute OGD induced more rapid and more severe cell death in the three regions. In this case, hypothermia induced 1 h after OGD was unable to protect CA1 pyramidal cells whereas hypothermia induced during OGD was able to prevent cell loss. This study provides evidence that neuroprotection by hypothermia is limited to specific areas and depends on the severity of the ischemia.",

Heparin or heparan sulfate proteoglycans are also essential cofactors for the interaction of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) with their receptor tyrosine kinases (FGFRs). Here we show that heparin is a growth factor-independent activating ligand for FGFR-4. Heparin stimulates FGFR-4 autophosphorylation on transfected myoblasts, fibroblasts and lymphoid cells, and is most potent on cells lacking surface heparan proteoglycan. Two functional analogs of heparin, fucoidan and dextran sulfate, are also activators of FGFR-4, while neither heparin nor its analogs can stimulate FGFR-1 in the absence of FGF. A mutation in the FGFR-4 ectodomain which impairs receptor activation by FGFs does not interfere with activation by heparin, demonstrating that receptor domains required for heparin or FGF activation are not identical. Heparin activation of FGFR-4 or of a chimeric receptor bearing FGFR-4 ectodomain and FGFR-1 cytodomain triggers downstream tyrosine phosphorylation of several signaling proteins, and induces proliferation of cells bearing the chimeric receptor. Consistent with these findings, a soluble FGFR-4 ectodomain has strong FGF-independent affinity for immobilized heparin resin, while soluble FGFR-1 requires FGF for stable heparin interaction. Heparin activation of FGFR-4 is the first example of a mammalian polysaccharide serving as a signaling ligand.",

In this study, the miR-134 expression level was manipulated both in oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-treated N2A neuroblastoma cells in vitro and mouse brain with MCAO-induced ischemic stroke in vivo, and its possible targets of heat shock protein A5 (HSPA5) and HSPA12B were determined by bioinformatics analysis and dual luciferase assay. The results showed that overexpression of miR-134 exacerbated cell death and apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, downregulating miR-134 levels reduced cell death and apoptosis. Furthermore, non-expression of miR-134 enhanced HSPA12B protein levels in OGD-treated N2A cells as well as in the ischemic region. It could attenuate brain infarction size and neural cell damage, and improve neurological outcomes in mice with ischemic stroke, whereas upregulation of miR-134 had the opposite effect. In addition, HSPA12B was validated to be a target of miR-134 and its short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) could block miR-134 inhibitor-induced neuroprotection in OGD-treated N2A cells. In conclusion, downregulation of miR-134 could induce neuroprotection against ischemic injury in vitro and in vivo by negatively upregulating HSPA12B protein expression. ",

All evaluable patients underwent (18)F-FLT PET/CT at baseline (FLT1) and after 1 cycle of NAC (FLT2); 43 patients were imaged at FLT1, FLT2, and after NAC completion (FLT3). The percentage change in maximum SUV (%ΔSUVmax) between FLT1 and FLT2 and FLT3 was calculated for the primary tumors. The predictive value of ΔSUVmax for pCR was determined using receiver-operating-characteristic curve analysis. The correlation between SUVmax and Ki-67 was also assessed.;Fifty-one of 90 recruited patients (median age, 54 y; stage IIA-IIIC) met the eligibility criteria for the primary objective analysis, with an additional 22 patients totaling 73 patients for secondary analyses. A pCR in the primary breast cancer was achieved in 9 of 51 patients. NAC resulted in a significant reduction in %SUVmax (mean Δ, 39%; 95% confidence interval, 31-46). There was a marginal difference in %ΔSUVmax_FLT1-FLT2 between pCR and no-pCR patient groups (Wilcoxon 1-sided P = 0.050). The area under the curve for ΔSUVmax in the prediction of pCR was 0.68 (90% confidence interval, 0.50-0.83; Delong 1-sided P = 0.05), with slightly better predictive value for percentage mean SUV (P = 0.02) and similar prediction for peak SUV (P = 0.04). There was a weak correlation with pretherapy SUVmax and Ki-67 (r = 0.29, P = 0.04), but the correlation between SUVmax and Ki-67 after completion of NAC was stronger (r = 0.68, P < 0.0001).;(18)F-FLT PET imaging of breast cancer after 1 cycle of NAC weakly predicted pCR in the setting of variable NAC regimens. Posttherapy (18)F-FLT uptake correlated with Ki-67 on surgical specimens. These results suggest some efficacy of (18)F-FLT as an indicator of early therapeutic response of breast cancer to NAC and support future multicenter studies to test (18)F-FLT PET in a more uniformly treated patient population.",

Here we identify mechanisms involved in microglial ischemic vulnerability. Using time-lapse imaging of cultured BV2 microglia, we show that simulated ischemia (oxygen-glucose deprivation; OGD) induces BV2 microglial cell death. Removal of extracellular Ca(2+) or application of Brilliant Blue G (BBG), a potent P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) antagonist, protected BV2 microglia from death. To validate and extend these in vitro findings, we assessed parenchymal microglia in freshly isolated hippocampal tissue slices from GFP-reporter mice (CX3CR1(GFP/+)). We confirmed that calcium removal or application of apyrase, an ATP-degrading enzyme, abolished OGD-induced microglial cell death in situ, consistent with involvement of ionotropic purinergic receptors. Indeed, whole cell recordings identified P2X7R-like currents in tissue microglia, and OGD-induced microglial cell death was inhibited by BBG. These pharmacological results were complemented by studies in tissue slices from P2X7R null mice, in which OGD-induced microglia cell death was reduced by nearly half. Together, these results indicate that stroke-like conditions induce calcium-dependent microglial cell death that is mediated in part by P2X7R. This is the first identification of a purinergic receptor regulating microglial survival in living brain tissues. From a therapeutic standpoint, these findings could help direct novel approaches to enhance microglial survival and function following stroke and other neuropathological conditions.",

To study the determinants of the host cell-specific phosphorylation of SNT1 by FGFR1 tyrosine kinase, we constructed a chimeric receptor FGFR2IIIb/R1 that consisted of an FGFR2IIIb ligand-binding ectodomain and an FGFR1 tyrosine kinase domain. The chimeric FGFR2IIIb/R1 kinase mediated robust phosphorylation of SNT1 immediately after transfection in mouse 3T3 cells where the FGFR1 kinase was residential, and in proliferative aged prostate tumor epithelial cells (DTE-R1/100) that ectopically expressed FGFR1 kinase. This is in contrast to the fact that the robust phosphorylation of SNT1 by ectopic FGFR1 kinase is an acquisition property in DTE premalignant prostate epithelial cells, which normally do not express FGFR1. The data suggest that the microenvironment of intracellular, rather than components in the extracellular compartment, of host cells is important in permitting FGFR1 kinase to strongly phosphorylate SNT1. Together with our previous data that the acquisition of SNT1 phosphorylation activity is concurrent with the acquisition of mitogenic activity of FGFR1 in prostate epithelial cells, the results here further demonstrate that the phosphorylation of SNT1 is host cell specific and that alterations induced by chronic exposure to ectopic FGFR1 kinase are involved in acquisition of SNT1 phosphorylation activity to the ectopic FGFR1 in prostate epithelial cells.",

The aims of this study were to determine the protective effects of the other noble gases, helium, neon, argon, krypton and xenon, on human tubular kidney HK2 cells in vitro. Cultured human renal tubular cells (HK2) were exposed to noble gas preconditioning (75% noble gas; 20% O(2); 5% CO(2)) for three hours or mock preconditioning. Twenty-four hours after gas exposure, cell injury was provoked with oxygen-glucose deprived (OGD) culture medium for three hours. Cell viability was assessed 24 h post-OGD by a 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay. Other cohorts of cultured cells were incubated in the absence of OGD in 75% noble gas, 20% O(2) and 5% CO(2) and cellular signals phospho-Akt (p-Akt), hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and Bcl-2 were assessed by Western blotting. OGD caused a reduction in cell viability to 0.382 +/- 0.1 from 1.0 +/- 0.15 at control (P < 0.01). Neon, argon and krypton showed no protection from injury (0.404 +/- 0.03; 0.428 +/- 0.02; 0.452 +/- 0.02; P > 0.05).

This study was devised to identify the causative mutations underlying defective bovine embryo development contained within three of these haplotypes (Brown Swiss haplotype 1 and Holstein haplotypes 2 and 3) by combining exome capture with next generation sequencing. Of the 68,476,640 sequence variations (SV) identified, only 1,311 genome-wide SNP were concordant with the haplotype status of 21 sequenced carriers. Validation genotyping of 36 candidate SNP identified only 1 variant that was concordant to Holstein haplotype 3 (HH3), while no variants located within the refined intervals for HH2 or BH1 were concordant. The variant strictly associated with HH3 is a non-synonymous SNP (T/C) within exon 24 of the Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes 2 (SMC2) on Chromosome 8 at position 95,410,507 (UMD3.1). This polymorphism changes amino acid 1135 from phenylalanine to serine and causes a non-neutral, non-tolerated, and evolutionarily unlikely substitution within the NTPase domain of the encoded protein. Because only exome capture sequencing was used, we could not rule out the possibility that the true causative mutation for HH3 might lie in a non-exonic genomic location. Given the essential role of SMC2 in DNA repair, chromosome condensation and segregation during cell division, our findings strongly support the non-synonymous SNP (T/C) in SMC2 as the likely causative mutation. The absence of concordant variations for HH2 or BH1 suggests either the underlying causative mutations lie within a non-exomic region or in exome regions not covered by the capture array. ",

The knockdown of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor‑γ (PPARγ) expression in these cells increased OGD/reperfusion‑induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), tumor necrosis factor‑α (TNF‑α) and interferon‑γ (IFN‑γ), and enhanced OGD/reperfusion‑induced downregulation of the expression of cluster of differentiation (CD) 206, at the mRNA and protein levels. Conversely, overexpression of PPARγ significantly attenuated OGD/reperfusion‑induced alterations in the expression of iNOS, TNF‑α, IFN‑γ and CD206 at the mRNA and protein levels.

Here, we studied whether LIF affects the proliferation of cultured primary rat astrocytes under OGD conditions by measuring EdU incorporation into astrocyte DNA and the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) mRNA and protein. Our findings show that low concentrations of LIF (5 and 10 ng/mL) significantly decreased EdU incorporation and downregulated the expression of PCNA mRNA and PCNA protein in astrocytes subjected to OGD.

Global cerebral ischemia was induced using the four-vessel occlusion (4-VO) model in rats. Induction of pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic factors, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and nitric oxide (NO), were assessed by ELISA, immunofluorescence, and the Griess assay, respectively. The miRNA expression profiles of OGD-activated BV-2 cells were subsequently compared with the profiles of resting cells in a miRNA microarray. BV-2 and primary rat microglial cells were transfected with miR-181c to evaluate its effects on TNF-α production after OGD. In addition, a luciferase reporter assay was conducted to confirm whether TNF-α is a direct target of miR-181c.;OGD induced BV-2 microglial activation in vitro, as indicated by the overproduction of TNF-α, IL-1β, and NO. Global cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury induced microglial activation and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus. OGD also downregulated miR-181c expression and upregulated TNF-α expression. Overproduction of TNF-α after OGD-induced microglial activation provoked neuronal apoptosis, whereas the ectopic expression of miR-181c partially protected neurons from cell death caused by OGD-activated microglia. RNAinterference-mediated knockdown of TNF-α phenocopied the effect of miR-181c-mediated neuronal protection, whereas overexpression of TNF-α blocked the miR-181c-dependent suppression of apoptosis. Further studies showed that miR-181c could directly target the 3'-untranslated region of TNF-α mRNA, suppressing its mRNA and protein expression.;Our data suggest a potential role for miR-181c in the regulation of TNF-α expression after ischemia/hypoxia and microglia-mediated neuronal injury.",

In this study, we investigated the role of XBP1 in rat primary hippocampal neurons subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation followed by reoxygenation (OGD/R) stress, an in vitro model of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Primary neurons subjected to OGD had increased levels of spliced XBP1 (XBP1s) mRNA. Interestingly, the level of XBP1s decreased during the initial reoxygenation stress period. The combination of OGD and the subsequent 20-h reoxygenation stress period significantly increased the apoptotic death of primary cells.

Mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) is the most important channel responsible for Ca(2+) influx into mitochondria and Ca(2+) signal plays a potential role in modulating mitophagy. However, the effect of MCU on mitophagy during the process of I/R injury remains unknown. This study constructed an in vitro I/R model by subjecting oxygen and glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/RP) model to SH-SY5Y cells to mimic the cerebral I/R injury and aimed to explore the exact effect of MCU on I/R induced mitophagy. The results showed that OGD/RP induced autophagy and mitophagy in SH-SY5Y cells. Ru360, the inhibitor of MCU, improved mitochondrial morphology and fuctional stability as well as cell viability, significantly reduced OGD/RP induced mitophagy as evidenced by the decrease in Beclin-1 and the increase in Tom20 and P62 expression. Whereas spermine, the agonist of MCU, had no significant impact on the expression of those mitophagy related proteins compared with OGD/RP group. This study indicates that inhibition of MCU can inhibit excessive mitophagy and protect the neurocytes from I/R injury. ",

To determine if mitochondrial O2(-) production was an important determinant in neuronal death resulting from OGD, metalloporphyrins with varying superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were tested for their ability to protect against mitochondrial aconitase inactivation and cell death. OGD-induced mitochondrial aconitase inactivation and cell death was inhibited by manganese tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (MnTBAP), manganese tetrakis (N-ethylpyridinium-2-yl) porphyrin (MnTE-2-PyP) and NMDA receptor antagonists. By contrast, NMDA- or kainate (KA)-induced mitochondrial aconitase inactivation and cell death was inhibited by MnTBAP, but not MnTE-2-PyP. Moreover, both MnTBAP and MnTE-2-PyP penetrated mitochondrial fractions of cortical cells. These data suggest that mitochondrial aconitase inactivation closely correlates with subsequent neuronal death following excitotoxicity produced by OGD or NMDA/KA exposure. Assessment of biological rather biochemical antioxidant activities better predicted neuroprotection by metalloporphyrins. Moreover, antioxidants that protect oxidant-sensitive mitochondrial targets such as aconitase may be useful as therapies for disease states involving excitotoxicity.",

Primary mouse endothelial cells have traditionally proven difficult to culture and as a consequence, few assays have been developed to dissect gene function and signal transduction pathways in these cells ex vivo. Having established methodology for the purification, short-term culture and transfection of primary blood (BEC) and lymphatic (LEC) vascular endothelial cells isolated from embryonic mouse skin, we sought to optimise robust assays able to measure embryonic LEC proliferation, migration and three-dimensional tube forming ability in vitro. In the course of developing these assays using the pro-lymphangiogenic growth factors FGF2 and VEGF-C, we identified previously unrecognised roles for FGFR1 signalling in lymphangiogenesis. The small molecule FGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor SU5402, but not inhibitors of VEGFR-2 (SU5416) or VEGFR-3 (MAZ51), inhibited FGF2 mediated LEC proliferation, demonstrating that FGF2 promotes proliferation directly via FGF receptors and independently of VEGF receptors in primary embryonic LEC. Further investigation revealed that FGFR1 was by far the predominant FGF receptor expressed by primary embryonic LEC and correspondingly, siRNA-mediated FGFR1 knockdown abrogated FGF2 mediated LEC proliferation. While FGF2 potently promoted LEC proliferation and migration, three dimensional tube formation assays revealed that VEGF-C primarily promoted LEC sprouting and elongation, illustrating that FGF2 and VEGF-C play distinct, cooperative roles in lymphatic vascular morphogenesis. These assays therefore provide useful tools able to dissect gene function in cellular events important for lymphangiogenesis and implicate FGFR1 as a key player in developmental lymphangiogenesis in vivo.",

The aims of this study were to observe the inhibitory effects of ginkgolide and bilobalide on the activation of microglial cells induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) and the specific mechanisms by which these effects are mediated. For detecting whether ginkgolide and bilobalide increased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner, BV2 cells were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation for 4 h followed by 3 h reoxygenation with various concentrations of drugs (6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 μg/ml). The extent of apoptosis effect of OGD/R with or without ginkgolide and bilobalide treatment were also measured by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining. Similarly, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 were detected using a specific Bio-Plex Pro™ Reagent Kit. The effects of ginkgolide and bilobalide on protein levels of TLR2/4, MyD88, p-TAK1, p-IKKβ, p-IkBα, NF-κB p65, Bcl-2, Bax, Bak, RIP3, cleaved-Caspase-3, cleaved PARP-1 and cellular localization of NF-κB p65 were evaluated by Western blot and double-labeled immunofluorescence staining, respectively. OGD/R significantly decreased the cell viability and increased the release of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α in BV2 microglia cells; these effects were suppressed by ginkgolide and bilobalide. Meanwhile, ginkgolide and bilobalide also attenuated the OGD/R-induced increases in TLR2, TLR4, MyD88, Bak, RIP3 levels and reversed cleaved caspase-3/caspase-3, Bax/Bcl-2 and cleaved PARP-1/PARP-1 ratio. Furthermore, ginkgolide and bilobalide also downregulated p-TAK1, p-IkBα, and p-IKKβ and inhibited the OGD/R-induced transfer of NF-κB p65 from cytoplasm to nucleus in BV2 microglia cells. The results showed that ginkgolide and bilobalide can inhibit OGD/R-induced production of inflammatory factors in BV2 microglia cells by regulating the TLRs/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathways and attenuating inflammatory response. The possible mechanism of anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of ginkgolides results from the synergistic reaction among each monomer constituents.",

OGD/R-induced autophagy coincided with decreases in Bcl-2 expression and increases in Beclin 1 expression. 15d-PGJ2 treatment upregulated Bcl-2 expression and decreased Beclin 1 expression, and inhibit the dissociation of Beclin1 from Bcl-2 significantly.

Previously, we documented the important regulatory roles of microRNAs in the cerebral vasculature, in particular the cerebral vascular endothelium. However, the functional significance and molecular mechanisms of other classes of non-coding RNAs in the regulation of cerebrovascular endothelial pathophysiology after stroke are completely unknown. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology, we profiled long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) expressional signatures in primary brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) after oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), an in vitro mimic of ischemic stroke conditions. After 16h of OGD exposure, the expression levels for 362 of the 10,677 lncRNAs analyzed changed significantly, including a total of 147 lncRNAs increased and 70 lncRNAs decreased by more than 2-fold. Among them, the most highly upregulated lncRNAs include Snhg12, Malat1, and lnc-OGD 1006, whereas the most highly downregulated lncRNAs include 281008D09Rik, Peg13, and lnc-OGD 3916. Alteration of the most highly upregulated/downregulated ODG-responsive lncRNAs was further confirmed in cultured BMECs after OGD as well as isolated cerebral microvessels in mice following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and 24h reperfusion by the quantitative real-time PCR approach. Moreover, promoter analysis of altered ODG-responsive endothelial lncRNA genes by bioinformatics showed substantial transcription factor binding sites on lncRNAs, implying potential transcriptional regulation of those lncRNAs. These findings are the first to identify OGD-responsive brain endothelial lncRNAs, which suggest potential pathological roles for these lncRNAs in mediating endothelial responses to ischemic stimuli. Endothelial-selective lncRNAs may function as a class of novel master regulators in cerebrovascular endothelial pathologies after ischemic stroke.",

The protective effects of a procyanidin type A trimer (trimer 1) isolated from a water soluble cinnamon extract (CE) were investigated on key features of ischemic injury, including cell swelling, increased free radical production, increased intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)), mitochondrial dysfunction, and the reduction in glutamate uptake. Astrocyte (glial) swelling is a major component of cytotoxic brain edema in ischemia and, along with vasogenic edema, may contribute to increased intracranial pressure, brain herniation, and additional ischemic injuries. C6 glial cultures were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) for 5 h, and cell swelling was determined at 90 min after the end of OGD. OGD-induced increases in glial swelling were significantly blocked by trimer 1, but not by the major nonpolyphenol fractions of CE including cinnamaldehyde and coumarin. Increased free radical production, a contributing factor in cell swelling following ischemic injury, was also significantly reduced by trimer 1. Mitochondrial dysfunction, another key feature of ischemic injury, is hypothesized to contribute to glial swelling. Depolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ(m)) was assessed using a fluorescent dye (tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester [TMRE]), and was significantly attenuated by trimer 1 as was OGD-induced increased [Ca(2+)](i). Taken together with our previous observation that blockers of [Ca(2+)](i) reduce cell swelling, our results indicate that trimer 1 may attenuate cell swelling by regulating [Ca(2+)](i). Trimer 1 also significantly attenuated the OGD-induced decrease in glutamate uptake. In addition, cyclosporin A, a blocker of the mitochondrial permeability pore (mPT), but not FK506 (that does not block the mPT), reduced the OGD-induced decline in glutamate uptake indicating a role of the mPT in such effects. Thus, the effects of trimer 1 in attenuating the reduction in glutamate uptake are likely mediated through their action on the mitochondria.",

Recently, it has been shown that HspB8 can enhance cardiac function and render cardioprotection. However, the potential benefits of HspB8 action on ischemic stroke and the underlying mechanism(s) are largely unknown. To investigate whether HspB8 exerts protective effects on in vitro ischemia/ reperfusion (I/R) injury, mouse neuroblastoma cells were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R). At first, we investigated and described the HspB8 expression and distribution in N2A cells exposed to OGD/R. Expressions of HspB8 were upregulated in mouse N2A cells after OGD/R, both at mRNA and protein levels. The level of HspB8 began increased after the OGD/R and peaked at 12 hour (12h) after the reperfusion, then declined at 24-hour time points, however, the level of HspB8 was still significantly increased compared to controls. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the expressed HspB8 was constitutively localized in the cytoplasm and at the periphery of the nucleus. Nuclear HspB8 levels increased after OGD/R compared with levels in the control, beginning as early as 4h reperfusion, the most conspicuous nuclear HspB8 staining was observed after 24h of reperfusion. Furthermore, overexpression of HspB8 reduced OGD/R -induced apoptosis by reducing the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that increased HspB8 expression and its nuclear shift in mouse N2A neuroblastoma cells protected against I/R injury, resulting in reduced apoptosis with the decrease of the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol. Therefore, HspB8 might play a fundamental role in opposing and alleviating I/R injury in primary myocardial cells, and it may constitute a new therapeutic target for cerebral ischemic diseases. ",

Furthermore, we discuss emerging therapeutic targets including novel oncogenic alterations (ROS1 rearrangements, FGFR1 amplifications, CMET amplifications, and others) and molecular features of the tumor microenvironment (including immune-checkpoint molecules such as CTLA4 and PD-1/PD-L1). We also discuss the potential role of advanced biomarker tests such as next-generation sequencing and \"liquid biopsies\" for patients with CNS metastases. ",

It is a major feature of many pathological conditions such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, cerebral hemorrhage, perinatal asphyxia and can lead to cell death due to energy depletion and increased free radical generation. The present study investigates the effect of hypoxia on the unfolded protein response of the cell (UPR), utilizing a 16-h oxygen-glucose deprivation protocol (OGD) in a PC12 cell line model. Expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94), key players of the UPR, was studied along with the expression of glucose-regulated protein 75 (GRP75), heat shock cognate 70 (HSC70), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, all with respect to the cell death mechanism(s). Cells subjected to OGD displayed upregulation of GRP78 and GRP94 and concurrent downregulation of GRP75. These findings were accompanied with minimal apoptotic cell death and induction of autophagy. The above observation warrants further investigation to elucidate whether autophagy acts as a pro-survival mechanism that upon severe and prolonged hypoxia acts as a concerted cell response leading to cell death. In our OGD model, hypoxia modulates UPR and induces autophagy. ",

This research utilizes the ECIS technique for monitoring the time-course impedimetric changes in normal and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)-protected cortical neurons under the ischemic insult of oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) created in a microperfusion environment. The neuronal apoptosis is reflected by the relatively low cell viability (28 ± 11.5 %) after 30-min OGD followed by 24 h of re-oxygenation. Also the hyperpolarization phase of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) occurs during 2 h of the re-oxygenation period. In contrast, cortical neurons treated with 50 and 100 ng/mL IGF-1 show higher survival rates of 45 ± 5.2 % and 49 ± 9.2 %, respectively, and no occurrence of the hyperpolarization of MMP during the re-oxygenation period. The ECIS results demonstrate that the measured impedance of cortical neurons decreased from 826 ± 86 kΩ to 224 ± 32 kΩ due to cell detachment under the insult of OGD. The measured impedance of IGF-1-protected cortical neurons slowly decreased to about 50 % of the original value (560 ± 45 kΩ for 50 ng/mL and 593 ± 44 kΩ for 100 ng/mL) compared to saline control of 232 ± 37 kΩ, which indicates improved cell adhesion under OGD conditions.

The HOTC is used not only for the study of the mechanisms of cell death, but also has been the cornerstone of synaptic physiology. Although the intact nature of the HOTC is one of its primary advantages, some studies require a dissociated preparation in order to distinguish cell type specific responses. Typically, primary dissociated neuronal cultures are prepared from embryonic tissue. Since the HOTC is prepared from postnatal pups, we wanted to establish a primary culture of hippocampus from postnatal pups to parallel our studies in the HOTC preparation. Mixed cultures were prepared by enzymatic dissociation of hippocampus from 7-day-old mouse pups. These cultures responded to OGD with a time course of delayed cell death that was similar to that reported in HOTC. Dual label immunocytochemical staining revealed that neurons, but not astrocytes, were dying from apoptosis following OGD. To examine this vulnerability further, we also prepared neuronal enriched cultures by treating mixed cultures with cytosine-β-d-arabinofuranoside (CBA). These neuronal cultures appear to be even more sensitive to OGD. In addition, we have established primary astrocyte-enriched cultures from the same age pups to examine the vulnerability of astrocytes to OGD. These three culture preparations are useful for comparison of the responses of the two major cell types in the same culture, and the enriched cultures will allow biochemical, electrophysiological and molecular studies of homogenous cell populations.",

A number of reports indicate that PYK2 is a redox sensitive kinase that must be activated by an estrogen-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the mechanism of PYK2 activation remains incompletely illustrated. Accumulating attention is focused on nitric oxide (NO, a free radical) which plays a critical role in cellular signal transduction through stimulus-coupled S-nitrosylation of cysteine residues. Here we reported that PYK2 over-expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells was S-nitrosylated (forming SNO-PYK2) by reacting with GSNO, an exogenous NO donor, at one critical cysteine residue (Cys534) with a biotin switch assay. Moreover, our results showed that S-nitrosylation and phosphorylation of PYK2 over-expressed in SH-SY5Y cells was significantly increased after oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). We further investigated whether the activation (phosphorylation) of PYK2 was associated with S-nitrosylation following SH-SY5Y cells OGD. Our results showed that the cysteine534 residue (site of S-nitrosylation) mutant PYK2 over-expressed in SH-SY5Y cells diminished S-nitrosylation of PYK2 and inhibited its phosphorylation induced by OGD. In addition, overexpression of the mutant PYK2 protein could prevent nuclear accumulation and abrogate neuronal cell death compared to wild type PYK2 in SH-SY5Y cells induced by OGD. These data suggest that the activation of PYK2 following OGD may be modulated by S-nitrosylation, which provides a new avenue for stroke therapy by targeting the post-translational modification machinery.

Consequently, CART knockdown exacerbated neuronal cell death induced by oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). It also showed that CART knockdown increased infarct size in a mouse middle cerebral artery occlusion model. CART's protective effects are most likely mediated through the ERK 1/2 pathway, since ERK 1/2 phosphorylation, not that of p38 or JNK is activated in CART-treated neurons after OGD. Furthermore, neuroprotection of CART is abolished by CART knockdown and by pretreatment with ERK antagonist PD98059 and U0126, but not with p38 or JNK antagonists SB203580 or SP600125.

However, the total dendritic length in surviving neurons was significantly increased after OGD with a peak at 6 h after re-oxygenation. The increase of dendritic length after OGD was mainly due to the sprouting rather than the extension of the dendrites. The dendritic outgrowth after 2 h of OGD was greater than that after 4 h of OGD. Application of NMDA receptor blocker MK-801 abolished OGD-induced dendritic outgrowth, whereas application of AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX had no significant effects.

Although most attention has focused on the neuronal effects of PC, the authors have recently shown that ischemic PC reduces ischemia-induced cerebrovascular damage. In vivo, it is difficult to ascertain whether this is a direct cerebrovascular effect of PC. This study, therefore, examined whether cerebral endothelial cells can be preconditioned in vitro in the absence of other cell types. Experiments were performed on an immortalized mouse brain endothelial cell line or primary cultures of mouse brain microvessel endothelial cells. Cells were exposed to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) of either short duration, as a PC stimulus, or a long duration (5 hours) with or without reoxygenation to induce endothelial damage. Endothelial injury was assessed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release and the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 at the protein and mRNA levels. Experiments indicated that 1 hour of OGD was the optimal PC stimuli and that a 1 or 3 day interval was the optimal time interval between the PC stimulus and the injurious event. Preconditioned cells had less lactate dehydrogenase release during OGD (+/- reoxygenation) and reduced intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression after OGD with reoxygenation. This study shows that cerebral endothelial cells can be directly preconditioned. The importance of this phenomenon in the overall effects of PC on the brain remains to be elucidated. Understanding the protective mechanisms elicited by PC may give insight into how to prevent ischemia-induced vascular damage (e.g., hemorrhagic transformation).",

To determine whether targeting FGFR1 in both of these AML subtypes can suppress leukemogenesis, we evaluated the effects of different FGFR1 inhibitors in a side-by-side comparison for their ability to affect in vitro proliferation in FGFR1 overexpressing murine and human cells lines. Three newly developed pan-FGFR inhibitors, AZD4547, BGJ398 and JNJ42756493, show a significantly improved efficacy over the more established FGFR inhibitors, PD173074 and TKI258. To examine whether targeting FGFR1 suppresses leukemogenesis in de novo AML in vivo, we created xenografts in immunocompromized mice from primary, de novo AML that showed > 3-fold increased expression of FGFR1. Using BGJ398, the most potent inhibitor identified in the in vitro studies, AML progression in these mice was significantly suppressed compared with vehicle treated animals and overall survival improved. Importantly, no difference in disease course or survival was seen in AML xenografts that did not show overexpression of FGFR1. These observations support the idea that FGFR1 is a driver oncogene in de novo, FGFR1-overexpressing AML and that molecularly targeted therapies using FGFR1 inhibitors may provide a valuable therapeutic regimen for all FGFR1-overexpressing AML.",

Immunoprecipitation of total cell extracts with FGF receptor (FGFR) 1-4 antibodies showed that U251MG glioma cells express only FGFR1. [125I]FGF-2 cross linking to nuclear extracts followed by FGFR1 immunoprecipitation showed that FGFR1 may account for the nuclear FGF-2 binding sites. Western blot analysis demonstrated the presence of 103, 118 kDa and small amounts of 145 kDa FGFR1 isoforms in the nuclei of glioma cells. All isoforms contain both the C- and N-terminal domains. Nuclear FGFR1 retains kinase activity. Immunocytochemistry using confocal microscopy showed specific FGFR1 immunoreactivity within the nuclear interior. In continuously proliferating glioma cells, nuclear FGFR1 is constitutively expressed, independent of cell density. In contrast, in nontransformed human astrocytes, nuclear FGFR1 levels fluctuate with the proliferative state of the cell. In quiescent, confluent astrocytes nuclear FGFR1 protein was depleted. An accumulation of nuclear FGFR1 was observed following the transition to a subconfluent, proliferating state. Transfection of a pcDNA3.1-FGFR1 expression vector into glioma cells that do not express FGFR1 resulted in the nuclear accumulation of FGFR1, increased cell proliferation, and stimulated transition from the G0/G1 to the S-phase of the cell cycle. The increased proliferative rate was resistant to inhibition by the cell-impermeable FGF binding antagonist, myoinositol hexakis [dihydrogen phosphate]. Our results suggest that the constitutive nuclear presence of FGFR1 contributes to the increased proliferation of glioma cells while the transient nuclear accumulation of FGFR1 in normal astrocytes may play a role in the transition to a reactive state.",

However, whether 17 beta E2 affects osteoclast differentiation or function directly or through its action on osteoblasts is unclear. To investigate this question we examined the human preosteoclastic cell line FLG 29.1 for evidence of functional estrogen receptors (ERs). Southern blotting of reverse transcription-PCR amplification products with a 32P-labeled cDNA probe for the human ER mRNA demonstrated that FLG 29.1 cells express ER mRNA. Binding of [3H]17 beta E2 to nuclear ERs was steroid specific with approximately 400 saturable, high affinity (Kd approximately 1 nM) binding sites per cell nucleus. Nuclear ERs covalently labeled with [3H]tamoxifen aziridine showed an apparent molecular weight of 65,000 by SDS/PAGE and Western blotting with the D75 monoclonal antibody to human ER. Pretreatment of cells with 0.1, 1.0, or 10 nM 17 beta E2 induced a dose- and time-dependent specific binding of progesterone to FGL 29.1 cells, and stimulation of the cells with 10 nM and 100 nM 17 beta E2 significantly (P < 0.05) reduced cell proliferation. Transcriptional activity of the ER gene was detected by transient transfection of cells with the pERE-BLCAT plasmid containing the estrogen response element for the vitellogenin A2 gene and the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene. Treatment of FLG 29.1 cells with 10 nM 17 beta E2 increased chloroamphenicol acetyltransferase expression from 5- to 29-fold compared to controls.

Whether T cells play a role in the migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells in these lesions is not known. We previously reported that some human T cells express FGF-1, a potent growth factor for vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. In this study, we extend this observation and examine the expression and function of FGF receptors on human T cells. Using reverse transcription-PCR, Northern analysis, and immunohistochemistry, we found that some human T cells also express high affinity FGF receptor 1 (FGFR-1) respond to FGF-1. In the presence of anti-CD3, exogenous FGF-1 functions as a costimulator for these T cells, while FGF-1 alone does not induce T cell proliferation. [3H]Thymidine incorporation is sevenfold higher in T cells costimulated with FGF-1 compared with stimulation with anti-CD3 alone. Using limiting dilution, we demonstrate that FGF-responsive T cells are present in normal peripheral blood at a mean frequency of 1:19780 (95% confidence limits, 1:15100-1:23000), and similar T cells are increased in the peripheral blood of heart transplant recipients (mean frequency, 1:4210; 95% confidence limits, 1:3420-1:6781). In addition, a subline of Jurkat, a human T cell tumor, expresses FGFR-1 receptor. The function of FGFR-1 receptor in Jurkat T cells is demonstrated by the production of IL-2 after stimulation with FGF-1 and anti-CD3. IL-2 levels are sevenfold higher in Jurkat T cells costimulated with FGF-1 compared with those stimulated with anti-CD3 alone. FGF-1 alone has no effect on Jurkat T cells. These findings thus provide evidence that a subset of human T cells expresses a receptor for vascular cell growth factors, and this receptor functions to increase IL-2 production consistent with costimulation. The potential role of FGF-responsive T cells in a variety of vascular and inflammatory lesions is discussed.",

Deep hypothermia (18°C) was given to PC12 cells while the model of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) induction for 1h.

In situations with energy failure, glutamate transport is impaired and high levels of this amino acid accumulate on the synaptic cleft. Our group has showed that guanosine exerts neuroprotection against neurotoxicity situations. The aim of this work is draw a post-ischemic profile of glutamate uptake and cell damage using an oxygen and glucose deprivation model (OGD) in hippocampal slices from young (P10) and adult (P60) rats, analyzing guanosine effect. OGD decreases glutamate uptake in both ages and recovery times, although decrease in cell viability was only observed 1 and 3 h after OGD in young and adult animals, respectively. Guanosine partially protected cell damage from 1 h in P10 and at 3 h in P60 rats and avoided glutamate uptake decrease from P10 rats at 3 h. The impairment of glutamate transporters since immediately after the insult observed here is probably due to an energetic failure; loss of cell viability was only observed from 1 h after OGD. The mechanism by which guanosine acts in the 'ischemic' model used here is still unknown, but evidence leads to its antiapoptotic effect.",

Central theme to cellular death is the activation of different classes of proteases such as caspases calpains and cathepsins. In the present study we investigated the involvement of these proteases, in the hypoxia-induced PC12 cell death. Rat PC12 is a model cell line for experimentation relevant to the nervous system and several protocols have been developed for either lethal hypoxia (oxygen and glucose deprivation OGD) or ischemic preconditioning (IPS). Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) treated PC12 differentiate to a sympathetic phenotype, expressing neurites and excitability. Lethal hypoxia was established by exposing undifferentiated and NGF-treated PC12 cells to a mixture of N(2)/CO(2) (93:5%) in DMEM depleted of glucose and sodium pyruvate for 16 h. The involvement of caspases, calpains and lysosomal cathepsins D and E to the cell death induced by lethal OGD was investigated employing protease specific inhibitors such as z-VAD-fmk for the caspases, MDL28170 for the calpains and pepstatin A for the cathepsins D and E. Our findings show that pepstatin A provides statistically significant protection from cell death of both naive and NGF treated PC12 cells exposed to lethal OGD. We propose that apart from the established processes of apoptosis and necrosis that are integral components of lethal OGD, the activation of cathepsins D and E launches additional cell death pathways in which these proteases are key partners.",

To verify sex-dependent differences in P450 aromatase function in astrocyte cell death following OGD, we developed a novel method that uses sex-specific and genotype-specific single pup primary astrocyte cultures from wild-type (WT) and aromatase-knockout (ArKO) mice. After determining sex by external and internal examination as well as PCR and genotype by PCR amplification of tail cDNA, we established cultures from 1-3-day-old male and female WT and ArKO mice pups and grew them to confluence in estrogen-free media. Cell death was measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. Our study shows that, while WT female astrocytes are more resistant to OGD than WT male cells, sex differences disappear in ArKO cells. Cell death is significantly increased in ArKO compared to WT in female astrocytes but not male cells. Therefore, P450 aromatase appears to be essential in endogenous neuroprotection in females, and this finding may have clinical implications.

Ghrelin stimulates GH release and induces positive energy balances. Previous studies have reported that ghrelin inhibits apoptosis in several cell types, but its antiapoptotic effect in neuronal cells is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the role of ghrelin in ischemic neuronal injury using primary hypothalamic neurons exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). Here we report that treatment of hypothalamic neurons with ghrelin inhibited OGD-induced cell death and apoptosis. Exposure of neurons to ghrelin caused rapid activation of ERK1/2. Ghrelin-induced activation of ERK1/2 and the antiapoptotic effect of ghrelin were blocked by chemical inhibition of MAPK, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase, protein kinase C, and protein kinase A. Ghrelin attenuated OGD-induced activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and p-38 but not ERK1/2. We also investigated ghrelin regulation of apoptosis at the mitochondrial level. Ghrelin protected cells from OGD insult by inhibiting reactive oxygen species generation and stabilizing mitochondrial transmembrane potential. In addition, ghrelin-treated cells showed an increased Bcl-2/Bax ratio, prevention of cytochrome c release, and inhibition of caspase-3 activation. Finally, in vivo administration of ghrelin significantly reduced infarct volume in an animal model of ischemia.

A Cbl TKB domain mutant, G306E, disrupted the phosphorylation of the FGFR-1 but not that of FRS2. In the tubular morphogenesis assay, cells expressing wild-type Cbl initially formed tubular structures. These showed decreased stability and converted into cell aggregates, possibly due to a failure to cease proliferating.

Children with AD were significantly more likely to be sensitized (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=6.18, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.94-12.98, P<0.001), but this effect was independent of FLG mutation carriage, TEWL, and AD phenotype (flexural vs. non-flexural).

S2 cell lines were significantly more sensitive (p < 0.001) to the FGFR inhibitors BGJ398 and AZD4547. BGJ398 decreased MAPK signaling in S2 but not in non-S2 cell lines. All cell lines expressed FGFR1 and FGFR2, but only S2 cell lines expressed FGFR3 and FGFR4. FGFR4 siRNA decreased proliferation by 44% or more in all five S2 cell lines (p < 0.05 for each cell line), a significantly greater decrease than seen with knockdown of FGFR1-3 with siRNA transfection. FGFR4 knockdown decreased MAPK signaling in S2 cell lines, but little effect was seen with knockdown of FGFR1-3. In conclusion, the S2 molecular subclass of HCC is sensitive to FGFR inhibition.

Ischemic injury in the CNS causes damage to astrocytes and the release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6. This current study investigates whether mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) inhibits oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced cell damage and inflammatory cytokine secretion by suppressing endoplasmic reticulum stress in rat primary astrocytes. We found that MANF alleviated OGD-induced astrocyte damage and rescued the cell viability, and the upregulation of GRP78 (endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress marker) and NF-κB p65 (one of the central mediators of proinflammatory pathways) induced by OGD were significantly reduced by preincubation of MANF. In addition, the increases of secretion and mRNA expression levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in astrocytes induced by OGD were significantly suppressed by MANF. These findings demonstrate that MANF shows the potential to alleviate cell damage and inflammation in rat primary astrocytes by suppressing ER stress, indicating that MANF plays an important role in astrocyte inflammation and functioning and may suggest a promising strategy for neuroprotection in the CNS.

We analysed 8p rearrangements in 48 breast, pancreatic and colon cancer cell lines by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and array comparative genomic hybridization, with a tiling path of 0.2 Mb resolution over 8p12 and 1 Mb resolution over chromosome 8. Selected breast lines (MDA-MB-134, MDA-MB-175, MDA-MB-361, T-47D and ZR-75-1) were analysed further. Most cell lines showed loss of 8p distal to a break that was between 31 Mb (5' to NRG1) and the centromere, but the translocations were accompanied by variable amplifications, deletions and inversions proximal to this break. The 8p12 translocation in T-47D was flanked by an inversion of 4 Mb, with a 100 kb deletion at the proximal end. The dicentric t(8;11) in ZR-75-1 carries multiple rearrangements including interstitial deletions, a triplicated translocation junction between NRG1 and a fragment of 11q (unconnected to CCND1), and two separate amplifications, of FGFR1 and CCND1 . We conclude that if there is a tumour suppressor gene on 8p it may be near 31 Mb, for example WRN; but the complexity of 8p rearrangements suggests that they target various genes proximal to 31 Mb including NRG1 and the amplicon centred around ZNF703/FLJ14299.",

Among these is a novel 150 kD superoxide dismutase-related membrane glycoprotein, originally identified by its reaction with the anti-osteoclast monoclonal antibody 121F. This antigen is uniquely restricted to osteoclasts in bone, universally present on osteoclasts from multiple species, induced during osteoclast differentiation in vitro and in ovo, and required at high levels for avian osteoclastic bone pit resorption. Expression of a comparable human antigen was investigated using human leukemic FLG 29.1 cells capable of differentiating towards an osteoclast-like phenotype. Phorbol ester, 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D3, and osteoblast-derived soluble factors elicited dose and time-dependent inductions of this antigen as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunocytochemical staining, coincident with their display of multiple other osteoclastic features. Synergistic interactions of these modulators led to further elevations in the ultimate expression levels of this antigen, although not to the full extent associated with in vivo-formed avian osteoclasts. The potent antiresorptive hormone 17beta-estradiol, but not its inactive alpha isomer, partially suppressed the phorbol ester-induced elevation of the 121F antibody-reactive antigen in FLG 29.1 cells as it does in avian osteoclast-like cells. Characterization of the human antigen isolated from FLG 29.1 cells by 121F immunoaffinity purification demonstrated that this regulated membrane component was synthesized by these human cells, more abundant following their differentiation into osteoclast-like cells, and similar biochemically and immunologically to the 150 kD integral membrane glycoprotein previously described from avian osteoclasts. Therefore, this report is the first documentation that human osteoclast-like FLG 29.1 cells express, in a developmentally regulated fashion, a homolog of the specific 150 kD avian osteoclast surface antigen that is related to superoxide dismutase, a protective free radical scavenging enzyme and is essential for osteoclastic bone resorption.",

A total of 78 pure DCIS cases, classified histologically as well, intermediately and poorly differentiated, were examined for LOH with 76 markers dispersed along all chromosome arms. LOH on chromosome 17 was more frequent in poorly differentiated DCIS (70%) Compared to well-differentiated DCIS (17%), whereas loss on chromosome 16 was associated with well- and intermediately differentiated DCIS (66%). For a subset we have done Southern blot-and CGH analysis. C-erbB2/neu was amplified in 30% of poorly differentiated DCIS. No amplification was found of c-myc, mdm2, bek, flg and the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-receptor. By CGH, most frequent alterations in poorly differentiated DCIS were gains on 8q and 17q22-24 and deletion on 17p, whereas in well-differentiated DCIS amplification on chromosome 1q and deletion on 16q were found. In conclusion, our data indicates that inactivation of a yet unknown tumour suppressor gene on chromosome 16q is implicated in the development of most well and intermediately differentiated DCIS whereas amplification and inactivation of various genes on chromosome 17 are implicated in the development of poorly differentiated DCIS. Furthermore these data show that there is a genetic basis for the classification of DCIS in a well and poorly differentiated type and support the evidence of different genetic routes to develop a specific type of carcinoma in situ of the breast.",

In 7-d-old rat pups, ligating the carotid artery 1 h before hypoxia damaged the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere; in contrast, ligating the artery 24 h before hypoxia provided complete neuroprotection. The protective effect of the 24 h artery ligation preconditioning model requires the activation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). We tested the hypothesis that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A/VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) signaling that leads to CREB activation is the shared pathway underlying the protective effect of preconditioning in neurons and endothelial cells. VEGF-A, VEGFR-1, or VEGFR-2 was inhibited by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) in vivo and by a VEGF-A neutralizing antibody or VEGFR-2 inhibitor in vitro. CREB phosphorylation (pCREB) and VEGF-A and VEGFR-2 expression were increased and colocalized in vascular endothelial cells and neurons in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex 24 h after ligation. The antisense ODN blockades of VEGF-A and VEGFR-2 decreased pCREB and reduced the protection of 24 h ligation preconditioning. Furthermore, oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) preconditioning upregulated VEGF-A, VEGFR-2, and pCREB levels and protected immortalized H19-7 neuronal cells and b.End3 vascular endothelial cells against 24 h OGD cell death. Blocking VEGF-A or VEGFR-2 reduced CREB activation and the effects of OGD preconditioning in neuronal cells and endothelial cells. Transfecting a serine-133 phosphorylation mutant CREB also inhibited the protective effect of OGD preconditioning. We conclude that VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 signaling leading to CREB phosphorylation is the shared pathway underlying the preconditioning-induced protective effect in neurons and vascular endothelial cells in the developing brain.",

We previously demonstrated the anti-angiogenic potential of two marine algal carotenoids, fucoxanthin and siphonaxanthin. In this study, we evaluated the molecular mechanisms of the anti-angiogenic activity of those two carotenoids using human umbilical vein endothelial cells. This study showed that both fucoxanthin and siphonaxanthin suppress the mRNA expression of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) and its receptor (FGFR-1) as well as their trans-activation factor, EGR-1. But, the mRNA expression of VEGFR-2 did not show significant effect by those two carotenoids. Further, those two marine algal carotenoids down-regulate the phosphorylation of FGF-2-mediated intracellular signaling proteins such as ERK1/2 and Akt. Inhibition of FGF-2-mediated intracellular signaling proteins by those carotenoids represses the migration of endothelial cells as well as their differentiation into tube-like structures on Matrigel. These results demonstrate for the first time the possible molecular mechanism underlying the anti-angiogenic effects of fucoxanthin and siphonaxanthin and suggest that these effects are due to the down-regulation of signal transduction by FGFR-1. Our findings imply a new insight into the novel bio-functional property of marine algal carotenoids which should improve current anti-angiogenic therapies in the treatment of cancer and other pro-angiogenic diseases.",

However, the mechanism of probenecid protects against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury remains unclear. In present study, we hypothesized that probenecid protected astrocytes from ischemia/reperfusion injury in vitro by modulating the inflammasome. Primary cultured neocortical astrocytes were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/RX) and probenecid was added in this model. Viability and nuclear morphology of astrocytes, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein expressions of NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor protein 3), caspase-1, and AQP4 (Aquaporins 4), as well as release of cellular HMGB1 and IL-1β were observed to evaluate the effect and mechanisms of probenecid on OGD/reoxygenated astrocytes. Probenecid did not affect cell viability at concentrations of 1, 5, 10, and 100μM but induced significant astrocytes death at 500μM. Probenecid inhibited cell death and ROS generation in astrocytes subjected to 6h of OGD and 24h of reoxygenation. The expression levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, and AQP4 increased after 6h of OGD, but probenecid treatment attenuated this increase. Moreover, the extracellular release of IL-1β and HMGB1 from OGD/reoxygenated astrocytes increased significantly. However, treatment by probenecid resulted in substantial reduction of these proteins levels in extracellular space.

However, the regulation of miR-134 on HSPA12B and their role in protecting neuronal cells from ischemic injury are unclear.

        "Doc_abstract":"It is becoming increasingly evident that the secretory activity of LHRH neurons is regulated not only by transsynaptic inputs but also by trophic molecules of glial and neuronal origin. The present experiments were undertaken to gain insights into the potential cell-cell mechanisms by which basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF alpha), two growth factors produced in the hypothalamus, may affect LHRH neuronal function. Northern blot analysis showed that the LHRH-producing cell line GT1-7 contains the messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding the type 1 fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR-1) but not that encoding the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors, which mediates the biological actions of both TGF alpha and EGF. Ligand-induced receptor phosphorylation experiments demonstrated that GT1-7 cells possess biologically active FGFR-1s but not EGF receptors. Exposure of the cells to bFGF resulted not only in FGFR-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, but also in tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C gamma, one of the initial enzymes in the intracellular signaling cascade initiated by FGFR activation. GT1-7 cells proliferated in response to this activation. Despite the presence of biologically active receptors, bFGF did not significantly stimulate release of the mature LHRH decapeptide. Instead, bFGF increased the steady-state levels of the mRNA encoding the LHRH precursor processing endoprotease PC2, with a time course comparable to that of phorbol esters, suggesting that, as shown in the companion paper, the actions of the growth factor on LHRH neurons involve facilitation of the initial step in LHRH prohormone processing. The increase in PC2 gene expression was not accompanied by changes in LHRH mRNA levels. Unlike these direct actions of bFGF on GT-1 cells, TGF alpha appears to act indirectly via astroglial intermediacy. Exposure of GT1-7 cells to TGF alpha or EGF failed to affect several parameters of cellular activity including LHRH release, LHRH and PC2 mRNA levels, and cell proliferation. In contrast, astrocyte culture medium conditioned by treatment with TGF alpha led to sustained stimulation of LHRH release with no changes in LHRH gene expression and a transient increase in PC2 mRNA levels. Although no definitive evidence for the presence of FGFR-1 in normal LHRH neurons could be obtained by either double immunohistochemistry or double in situ hybridization procedures, fetal LHRH neurons in primary culture responded to bFGF with neurite outgrowth. Thus, normal LHRH neurons may have an FGFR-1 content too low for detection by regular histochemical procedures, and/or detectable expression of the receptor may be confined to a much earlier developmental stage. The mitogenic effect of bFGF on GT1-7 cells supports this possibility and suggests a role for FGF in the cell proliferation events that precede acquisition of the LHRH neuronal phenotype. It appears that once this phenotype is established, bFGF may promote the differentiation of LHRH neurons. The results also suggest that the secretory capacity of LHRH neurons develops under a dual trophic influence, one on peptide processing exerted directly by bFGF on early neurons, and another on LHRH release, exerted by TGF alpha via the intermediacy of astroglial cells.",

However, it is also frequently mutated in various cancers and is now generating significant interest as a potential therapeutic target. Unfortunately, biochemical characterization of its role in disease, and further evaluation as a drug target is hampered by lack of a specific inhibitor. We aimed to discover new inhibitors for FGFR4 ab initio using a strategy combining in silico, in vitro and cell-based assays. We used the homologous FGFR1 to calculate docking scores of a chemically-diverse library of approximately 2000 potential kinase inhibitors. Nineteen potential inhibitors and ten randomly- selected negative controls were taken forward for in vitro FGFR4 kinase assays. All compounds with good docking scores significantly inhibited FGFR4 kinase activity, some with sub-micromolar (most potent being V4-015 with an IC(50) of 0.04 μM). Four of these compounds also demonstrated substantial activity in cellular assays using the FGFR4- overexpressing breast carcinoma cell line, MDA-MB453. Through immunoblot assays, these compounds were shown to block the phosphorylation of the FGFR4 adaptor protein, FGFR substrate protein-2α (FRS2α). The most potent compound to date, V4-015, suppressed proliferation of MDA-MB453 cells at sub-micromolar concentrations, activated the pro-apoptotic caspases 3/7 and inhibited cellular migration. While achieving complete selectivity of this compound for FGFR4 will require further lead optimization, this study has successfully identified new chemical scaffolds with unprecedented FGFR4 inhibition capacities that will support mechanism of action studies and future anti-cancer drug design.",

Full inactivation of Fgfr1 in the inner ear epithelium by Foxg1-Cre-mediated deletion leads to an 85% reduction in the number of auditory hair cells. The primary cause appears to be reduced precursor cell proliferation in the early cochlear duct.

However, the mechanisms by which PACAP protected microglia from ischemic/hypoxic injury via inhibition of microglia activation remain unclear.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of PACAP on the oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)/reoxygenation BV2 microglia and to explore the role of TLR4/myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MyD88)/nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathway in the neuroprotective effects of PACAP.;We conducted OGD/reoxygenation by placing BV2 microglia into an airtight chamber and in glucose-free medium. BV2 microglia cell viability was determined by MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide] assay. Western blot was utilized to detect TLR4, MyD88 expression, inhibitory protein of NF-kappaB (IkappaB) phosphorylation/degradation, NF-kappaB activation. Level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in culture medium was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry.;We found that pretreatment with PACAP to BV2 cells immediately before OGD/reoxygenation significantly alleviated microglia hypoxic injury. PACAP inhibited upregulation of TLR4, MyD88 and NF-kappaB in BV2 microglial cells exposed to OGD/reoxygenation. PACAP administration also significantly reduced the production of proinflammatory cytokines and apoptosis in BV2 microglia exposed to OGD/reoxygenation.;Pretreatment with PACAP inhibited activation of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappaB signaling pathway and decreased inflammatory cytokine levels, as well as apoptosis in microglia, thereby attenuating microglia hypoxic injury.

It inhibits proliferation of cultured cells, mainly through arresting the cells in the G1/S or G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Here, we report that indirubin-3'-monoxime is able to inhibit proliferation of NIH/3T3 cells by specifically inhibiting autophosphorylation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), blocking in this way the receptor-mediated cell signaling. Indirubin-3'-monoxime inhibits the activity of FGFR1 at a concentration lower than that required for inhibition of phosphorylation of CDK2 and retinoblastoma protein and cell proliferation stimulated by fetal calf serum. The ability of indirubin-3'-monoxime to inhibit FGFR1 signaling was similar to that of the FGFR1 inhibitor SU5402. In addition, we found that indirubin-3'-monoxime activates long-term p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity, which stimulates extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 in a way unrelated to the activity of FGFR1.

It was hypothesized that the octylpyridylporphyrin, MnTnOct-2-PyP5+, a lipophilic but equally potent antioxidant as the other two porphyrins, would be more efficacious in reducing OGD-induced cell death due to its higher bioavailability. Cell death was evaluated at 24 h using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and propidium iodide staining. At concentrations from 3-100 microM, all three porphyrins reduced cell death as compared to cultures exposed to OGD alone, the effects depending upon the concentrations and type of treatment. To assess the effect of lipophilicity the additional experiments were performed using submicromolar concentrations of MnTnOct-2-PyP5+ in an organotypic hippocampal slice model of OGD with propidium iodide and Sytox staining. When compared to oxygen and glucose deprivation alone, concentrations of MnTnOct-2-PyP5+ as low as 0.01 microM significantly (p<0.001; power 1.0) reduced neuronal cells similar to control. This is the first in vitro study on the mammalian cells which indicates that MnTnOct-2-PyP5+ is up to 3000-fold more efficacious than equally potent hydrophilic analogues, due entirely to its increased bioavailability.

NF-κB is an important transcription factor involved in I/R injury. However, the underlying mechanism of ginsenoside Rb3 in myocardial I/R injury remains poorly understood. In the current study, a model of myocardial I/R injury was induced via oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by reperfusion (OGD-Rep) in mouse cardiac myoblast H9c2 cells. Our data demonstrate that ginsenoside Rb3 suppresses OGD-Rep-induced cell apoptosis by the suppression of ROS generation. By detecting the NF-κB signaling pathway, we discover that the protective effect of ginsenoside Rb3 on the OGD-Rep injury is closely related to the inhibition of NF-κB activity. Ginsenoside Rb3 inhibits the upregulation of phospho-IκB-α and nuclear translocation of NF-κB subunit p65 which are induced by ORD-Rep injury. In addition, the extract also inhibits the OGD-Rep-induced increase in the expression of inflammation-related factors, such as IL-6, TNF-α, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), MMP-2 and MMP-9. However, LPS treatment alleviates the protective roles of ginsenoside Rb3 and activates the NF-κB pathway. Finally, the upstream factors of NF-κB were analyzed, including the Akt/Foxo3a and MAPK signaling pathways. We find that ginsenoside Rb3 pretreatment only decreases the phosphorylation of JNK induced by OGD-Rep injury, an indicator of the MAPK pathway. Importantly, an inhibitor of phospho-JNK, SP600125, protects against OGD-Rep induced apoptosis and inhibited NF-κB signaling pathway, similar to the roles of ginsenoside Rb3. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the protective effect of ginsenoside Rb3 on the OGD-Rep injury is attributed to the inhibition of JNK-mediated NF-κB activation, suggesting that ginsenoside Rb3 has the potential to serve as a novel therapeutic agent for myocardial I/R injury.

Here we sought to evaluate the negative effects of hyperglycemia on the cellular biology of NSCs following anoxia, and to test whether high glucose affects NSC recovery from ischemic injury.;In this study, we used immortalized adult neural stem cells lines and we induced in vitro ischemia by 6 h oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) in an anaerobic incubator. Reperfusion was performed by returning cells to normoxic conditions and the cells were then incubated in experimental medium with various concentrations of glucose (17.5, 27.75, 41.75, and 83.75 mM) for 24 h. We found that high glucose (≥27.75 mM) exposure induced apoptosis of NSCs in a dose-dependent manner after exposure to OGD, using an Annexin V/PI apoptosis detection kit. The cell viability and proliferative activity of NSCs following OGD in vitro, evaluated with both a Cell Counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and a 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assay, were inhibited by high glucose exposure. Cell cycle analysis showed that high glucose exposure increased the percentage of cells in G0/G1-phase, and reduced the percentage of cells in S-phase. Furthermore, high glucose exposure was found to significantly induce the activation of c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and suppress extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activity.;Our results demonstrate that high glucose induces apoptosis and inhibits proliferation of NSCs following OGD in vitro, which may be associated with the activation of JNK/p38 MAPK pathways and the delay of G1-S transition in the cells.",

Autophagic cell death is a type of programmed cell death that plays elusive roles in controlling neuronal damage and metabolic homeostasis. We therefore studied whether propofol could attenuate the formation of autophagosomes, and if so, whether the inhibition of autophagic cell death mediates the neuroprotective effects observed with propofol.;The cell model was established by depriving the cells of oxygen and glucose (OGD) for 6 hours, and the rat model of ischemia was introduced by a transient two-vessel occlusion for 10 minutes. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the formation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes in both neuronal PC12 cells and pyramidal rat hippocampal neurons after respective OGD and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) insults. A western blot analysis revealed that the autophagy-related proteins, such as microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3-II), Beclin-1 and class III PI3K, were also increased accordingly, but cytoprotective Bcl-2 protein was decreased. The negative effects of OGD and I/R, including the formation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes, the increase in LC3-II, Beclin-1 and class III PI3K expression and the decline in Bcl-2 production were all inhibited by propofol and specific inhibitors of autophagy, such as 3-methyladenine (3-MA), LY294002 and Bafilomycin A1 (Baf),. Furthermore, in vitro OGD cultures and in vivo I/R rats showed an increase in cell survival following the administration of propofol, as assessed by an MTT assay or histochemical analyses.;Our data suggest that propofol can markedly attenuate autophagic processes via the decreased expression of autophagy-related proteins in vitro and in vivo. This inhibition improves cell survival, which provides a novel explanation for the pleiotropic effects of propofol that benefit the nervous system.",

The 32P-labeled aFGF receptor was specifically immunoprecipitated by anti-FGF receptor (anti-flg/bek/cek gene product) antiserum. In contrast to other growth factor receptors/protein tyrosine kinases, the protein tyrosine kinase activity (autophosphorylation) of the aFGF receptor was stimulated (approximately 1.5-fold) by low concentrations of Mn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ (optimal concentrations of approximately 0.1, approximately 0.1, and 1 microM, respectively) but inhibited by higher concentrations of Mn2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and pyrophosphate (greater than or equal to 20, greater than or equal to 50, greater than or equal to 10, and greater than or equal to 100 microM, respectively). However, addition of Mn2+ and pyrophosphate at a ratio of 1:1 not only reversed the inhibitory effect but also enhanced the kinase activity about 3-4-fold. The apparent Km of ATP for intrinsic and ligand-stimulated protein kinase activity of the aFGF receptor was estimated to be 25 microM. The preferred exogenous substrates for the protein tyrosine kinase activity of the aFGF receptor were found to be myelin basic protein and histone.

In particular, oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) during ischemia and stroke results in extensive tissue injury and cell death.;Using time-resolved ribosome profiling, we assess gene expression levels in a neural cell line, PC12, during the first hour of OGD. The most substantial alterations are seen to occur within the first 20 minutes of OGD. While transcription of only 100 genes is significantly altered during one hour of OGD, the translation response affects approximately 3,000 genes. This response involves reprogramming of initiation and elongation rates, as well as the stringency of start codon recognition. Genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation are most affected. Detailed analysis of ribosome profiles reveals salient alterations of ribosome densities on individual mRNAs. The mRNA-specific alterations include increased translation of upstream open reading frames, site-specific ribosome pauses, and production of alternative protein isoforms with amino-terminal extensions. Detailed analysis of ribosomal profiles also reveals six mRNAs with translated ORFs occurring downstream of annotated coding regions and two examples of dual coding mRNAs, where two protein products are translated from the same long segment of mRNA, but in two different frames.;These findings uncover novel regulatory mechanisms of translational response to OGD in mammalian cells that are different from the classical pathways such as hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) signaling, while also revealing sophisticated organization of protein coding information in certain genes.",

In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective action of MLIF against oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced injury in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. MTT assay was used to assess cell viability, and flow cytometry assay and Hoechst staining were used to evaluate apoptosis. LDH assay was used to exam necrosis. The release of inflammatory cytokines was detected by ELISA. Levels of the apoptosis associated proteins were measured by western blot analysis. To identify the protein target of MLIF, pull-down assay and mass spectrometry were performed. We observed that MLIF enhanced cell survival and inhibited apoptosis and necrosis by inhibiting p-JNK, p53, c-caspase9 and c-caspase3 expression. In the microglia, OGD-induced secretion of inflammatory cytokines was markedly reduced in the presence of MLIF. Furthermore, we found that eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A2 (eEF1A2) is a downstream target of MLIF. Knockdown eEF1A2 using short interfering RNA (siRNA) almost completely abrogated the anti-apoptotic effect of MLIF in SH-SY5Y cells subjected to OGD, with an associated decrease in cell survival and an increase in expression of p-JNK and p53. These results indicate that MLIF ameliorates OGD-induced SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma injury by inhibiting the p-JNK/p53 apoptotic signaling pathway via eEF1A2. Our findings suggest that eEF1A2 may be a new therapeutic target for ischemic brain injury. ",

The vanilloid receptor (VR1) is present in regions of the brain (Mezey et al., 2000) that are highly susceptible to neurodegenerative insults, suggesting that this ion channel might contribute to the cellular processes involved in neuronal death. We tested the effects of VR1 ligands in the oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) model of cell death in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. The VR1 agonist capsaicin at concentrations that are selective for VR1 did not affect cell viability per se or the extent of neurodegeneration induced by the OGD insult. In contrast, the VR1 antagonist capsazepine (0.1-10 microm) significantly reduced the amount of OGD-induced cell death. However, capsazepine was still neuroprotective in slices prepared from VR1 knock-out mice, which exhibited the same degree of neurodegeneration to that observed in slices prepared from wild-type mice, excluding the possibility that it afforded neuroprotection through inhibition of VR1. Instead, capsazepine inhibited the hyperpolarization-activated nonspecific cation channel generated current I(h) in a concentration range similar to that which was neuroprotective. Furthermore, the specific I(h) blocker ZD-7288 was also neuroprotective, mirroring the effects of capsazepine, in that it was effective at preventing cell death when applied either during or after the OGD insult. These results demonstrate that capsazepine affords neuroprotection through inhibition of I(h) rather than inhibition of VR1.",

The effect of protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) and phosphatase inhibitors on hypoxia-induced phosphotyrosine was also studied. Capillary endothelial cells cultured in standard normoxic (pO2 = 20%) conditions were quiesced in low serum containing medium and then exposed to low oxygen tension or hypoxia (pO2 = 3%) in humidified, 5% CO2, 37 degrees C, tissue culture chambers, on a time-course of up to 24 h. DNA synthesis was potentiated by hypoxia in a time-dependent manner. This response positively correlated with the cumulative induction of phosphotyrosine and the downregulation of bFGFR (M(r) approximately 85 kDa). Protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors, herbimycin-A, and methyl 2,5-dihydroxycinnamate, unlike genistein, markedly blocked hypoxia-induced phosphotyrosine. Prolonged exposure of cells to phosphatase inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate, also blocked hypoxia-induced phosphotyrosine. The expression of HSP70, PKC alpha, and SHC were not markedly altered by hypoxia. Taken together, these data suggest that short-term hypoxia activates endothelial cell proliferation in part via tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins and changes in the expression of the FGF receptor. Thus, endothelial cell mitogenesis and neovascularization associated with low oxygen tension may be controlled by abrogating signaling pathways mediated by protein tyrosine kinase and phosphatases.",

Here, we dissect Fgfr1 function in mouse limb by conditional inactivation of Fgfr1 using two different Cre recombinase-expressing lines. Use of the T (brachyury)-cre line led to Fgfr1 inactivation in all limb bud mesenchyme (LBM) cells during limb initiation. This mutant reveals FGFR1 function in two phases of limb development. In a nascent limb bud, FGFR1 promotes the length of the proximodistal (PD) axis while restricting the dimensions of the other two axes. It also serves an unexpected role in limiting LBM cell number in this early phase. Later on during limb outgrowth, FGFR1 is essential for the expansion of skeletal precursor population by maintaining cell survival. Use of mice carrying the sonic hedgehog(cre) (Shh(cre)) allele led to Fgfr1 inactivation in posterior LBM cells. This mutant allows us to test the role of Fgfr1 in gene expression regulation without disturbing limb bud growth. Our data show that during autopod patterning, FGFR1 influences digit number and identity, probably through cell-autonomous regulation of Shh expression. Our study of these two Fgfr1 conditional mutants has elucidated the multiple roles of FGFR1 in limb bud establishment, growth and patterning.",

In ischemic CSF, OGD induced a selective and delayed cell death in the CA1 region, as assessed by propidium iodide uptake. Cell death was glutamate receptor dependent since blockade of the N-methyl-D-aspartate and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors mitigated cell damage. Hyperglycemia aggravates ischemic brain damage whereas glucose in artificial CSF prevents oxygen deprivation-induced damage. The authors demonstrate that glucose in ischemic CSF significantly exacerbates cell damage after oxygen deprivation. This new model of \"ischemia\" can be useful in future studies of the mechanisms and treatment of ischemic cell death, including studies using genetically modified mice.",

The purpose of the current study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of GlcNAc-Sal against oxygen-glucose deprivation-reperfusion (OGD-R)-induced neurotoxicity in vitro and global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (GCI-R) injury in vivo. Cell viability tests and Hoechst 33342 staining confirmed that GlcNAc-Sal pretreatment markedly attenuated OGD-R induced apoptotic cell death in immortalized mouse hippocampal HT22 cells. Western blot, immunofluorescence and PCR analyses revealed that GlcNAc-Sal pretreatment restored the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and inhibited the activation of caspase-3 and PARP induced by OGD-R treatment. Further analyses showed that GlcNAc-Sal pretreatment antagonized reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, iNOS-derived NO production and NO-related apoptotic cell death during OGD-R stimulation. GCI-R was induced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) and reperfusion in mice in vivo. Western blot analysis showed that GlcNAc-Sal pretreatment decreased the expression of caspase-3 and increased the expression of Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2)/Bax (Bcl-2-associated X protein) induced by GCI-R treatment. Our findings suggest that GlcNAc-Sal pretreatment prevents brain ischemia reperfusion injury by the direct or indirect suppression of cell apoptosis and GlcNAc-Sal could be developed as a broad-spectrum agent for the prevention and/or treatment of cerebral ischemic injury.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective action of PF in cultured rat cortical neurons.;Primary cultured cortical neurons of rats were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) insult. Cell survival was determined using MTT assay. HEK293 cells stably transfected with A1R (HEK293/A1R) were used for detailed analysis. Phosphorylation of the signaling proteins was evaluated by Western blot or immunoprecipitation. Receptor interactions were identified using co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence staining.;Paeoniflorin (10 nmol/L to 1 μmol/L) increased the survival of neurons subjected to OGD/R. Furthermore, paeoniflorin increased the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 in these neurons. These effects were blocked by PI3K inhibitor wortmannin or MEK inhibitor U0126. Paeoniflorin also increased the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 in HEK293/A1R cells. Both A1R antagonist DPCPX and EGFR inhibitor AG1478 not only blocked paeoniflorin-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt in HEK293/A1R cells, but also paeoniflorin-increased survival of neurons subjected to OGD/R. In addition, paeoniflorin increased the phosphorylation of Src kinase and activation of MMP-2 in HEK293/A1R cells. Both Src inhibitor PP2 and MMP-2/MMP-9 inhibitor BiPs not only blocked paeoniflorin-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (and Akt) in HEK293/A1R cells, but also paeoniflorin-increased survival of neurons subjected to OGD/R.;Paeoniflorin promotes the survival of cultured cortical neurons by increasing Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation via A1R-mediated transactivation of EGFR.",

Adult Wistar rats were exposed to 3 h of hypoxia for HPC, and then their CSF was taken out. Cultured hippocampal neurons from the neonate rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 6): normal control group, OGD group, normal CSF group and HPC CSF group. OGD group received 1.5 h of incubation in glucose-free Earle's solution containing 1 mmol/L Na2S2O4, and normal and HPC CSF groups were subjected to 1 d of corresponding CSF treatments followed by 1.5 h OGD. The apoptosis of neurons was analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscope and flow cytometry using Annexin V/PI double staining. Moreover, protein expressions of Bcl-2 and Bax were detected by immunofluorescence. The results showed that few apoptotic cells were observed in normal control group, whereas the number of apoptotic cells was greatly increased in OGD group. Both normal and HPC CSF could decrease the apoptosis of cultured hippocampal neurons injured by OGD (P < 0.01). Notably, the protective effect of HPC CSF was stronger than that of normal one (P < 0.01). Compared to OGD group, normal and HPC CSF groups both showed significantly higher levels of Bcl-2 (P < 0.01), and Bcl-2 expression level in HPC CSF group was even higher than that in normal CSF group (P < 0.01). Whereas the expressions of Bax in normal and HPC CSF groups were significantly lower than that in OGD group (P < 0.01), and the Bax expression in HPC CSF group was even lower than that in normal CSF group (P < 0.01).

Hypoxia induces the immediate early genes (IEGs) rapidly and transiently that may initiate a cascade of cellular responses that are necessary for survival and normal function. However, the protective effect of naloxone on ischemic/hypoxic neuronal cells was only partly studied. Thus, the effects of naloxone on oxygen- and glucose-deprivation (OGD) and OGD followed by reoxygenation (OGD/R) on the expression of IEGs were examined in PC12 cells. The result showed that lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released in the media was reduced by naloxone. The temporal response of IEG mRNA encoding c-fos, c-jun, nur77, and zif268 was induced with different degree of intensity following hypoxia, whereas the level of GAPDH mRNA was relatively constant. However, these signals of c-fos, c-jun, and nur77 by hypoxia were reduced significantly by naloxone. Treatment with OGD also activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The induction of c-fos, c-jun, nur77, and zif268 by hypoxia was inhibited by naloxone (0.1 microM) and MAPK inhibitors (10 microM of U0126, D98059, SB203580). However, naloxone increased the expression of ERK1/2 by OGD concomitantly diminished the LDH release.

To explore this possibility, the present study used organotypic hippocampal slice cultures subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and reoxygenation to examine whether 20-HETE is released by organotypic hippocampal slices after OGD and whether it contributes to neuronal death through the generation of ROS and activation of caspase-3. The production of 20-HETE increased twofold after OGD and reoxygenation. Blockade of the synthesis of 20-HETE with N-hydroxy-N'-(4-butyl-2-methylphenol)formamidine (HET0016) or its actions with a 20-HETE antagonist, 20-hydroxyeicosa-6(Z),15(Z)-dienoic acid, reduced cell death, as measured by the release of lactate dehydrogenase and propidium iodide uptake. Administration of a 20-HETE mimetic, 20-hydroxyeicosa-5(Z),14(Z)-dienoic acid (5,14-20-HEDE), had the opposite effect and increased injury after OGD. The death of neurons after OGD was associated with an increase in the production of ROS and activation of caspase-3. These effects were attenuated by HET0016 and potentiated after the administration of 5,14-20-HEDE. These findings indicate that the production of 20-HETE by hippocampal slices is increased after OGD and that inhibitors of the synthesis or actions of 20-HETE protect neurons from ischemic cell death.

In culture, exposure of primary cortical neurons to 2 h of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) resulted in delayed neuronal cell death that was dependent on activation of the death receptor, Fas. Cortical cultures derived from timp-3(-/-) mice displayed partial resistance against OGD-induced neuronal cell death and also displayed increased shedding of Fas ligand (FasL) into the culture media, compared to wild-type control cultures. Both the increased neuroprotection and increased FasL shedding in timp-3(-/-) cultures were reversed by addition of exogenous metalloproteinase inhibitors, recombinant TIMP-3 or GM6001. In vivo, timp-3(-/-) mice showed marked resistance to a brief (30 min) middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), but were not protected against more severe lesions induced by 90 min of MCAO. These studies demonstrate that TIMP-3 facilitates Fas-mediated neuronal cell death following OGD and plays a pro-apoptotic role in mild cerebral ischemia.",

Cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) has been implicated as the predominant H2S-producing enzyme in central nervous system. When SH-SY5Y cells were transfected to overexpress CBS, these cells were able to synthesize H2S when exposed to high levels of enzyme substrates but not substrate concentrations that may reflect normal physiological conditions. At the same time, these cells demonstrated exacerbated cell death when subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) together with high substrate concentrations, indicating that H2S production has a detrimental effect on cell survival. This effect could be abolished by CBS inhibition. The same effect was observed with primary astrocytes exposed to OGD and high substrates or sodium hydrosulfide. In addition, CBS was upregulated and activated by truncation in primary astrocytes subjected to OGD. When rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion, CBS activation was also observed. These results imply that in acute ischemic conditions, CBS is upregulated and activated by truncation causing an increased production of H2S, which exacerbate the ischemic injuries. Therefore, CBS inhibition may be a viable approach to stroke treatment. ",

The practitioners have practiced FLG for at least 1 year (range, 1-5 years). The practice includes daily reading of FLG books and daily practice of exercises lasting 1-2 hours. Selected normal healthy controls did not perform Qigong, yoga, t'ai chi, or any other type of mind-body practice, and had not followed any conventional physical exercise program for at least 1 year. Neutrophils were isolated from fresh blood and assayed for gene expression, using microarrays and RNase protection assay (RPA), as well as for function (phagocytosis) and survival (apoptosis).;The changes in gene expression of FLG practitioners in contrast to normal healthy controls were characterized by enhanced immunity, downregulation of cellular metabolism, and alteration of apoptotic genes in favor of a rapid resolution of inflammation. The lifespan of normal neutrophils was prolonged, while the inflammatory neutrophils displayed accelerated cell death in FLG practitioners as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Correlating with enhanced immunity reflected by microarray data, neutrophil phagocytosis was significantly increased in Qigong practitioners. Some of the altered genes observed by microarray were confirmed by RPA.;Qigong practice may regulate immunity, metabolic rate, and cell death, possibly at the transcriptional level. Our pilot study provides the first evidence that Qigong practice may exert transcriptional regulation at a genomic level.

One of the target genes, fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1), has been reported to be amplified in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive subtype breast cancer, and is considered one possible mechanism of endocrine resistance through cross-talk between ER and growth factor receptor signaling. We performed a comprehensive analysis of FGFR1 at the levels of gene copy number, transcript and protein expression, and examined the relationships between FGFR1 status and clinicopathological parameters, including prognosis in 307 ER-positive/HER2-negative primary breast cancer patients treated with standard care at our institute. Most notably, a high level of FGFR1 protein expression was observed in 85 patients (27.7%), and was positively associated with invasive tumor size (P = 0.039). Furthermore, univariate analysis revealed that high FGFR1 protein expression was significantly correlated with poor relapse-free survival rate (P = 0.0019, HR: 2.63, 95% confidence interval: 1.17-5.98), and showed a tendency towards an increase in recurrent events if the observation period extended beyond the 5 years of the standard endocrine treatment term. FGFR1 gain/amplification was found in 43 (14.0%) patients, which was only associated with higher nuclear grade (P = 0.010). No correlation was found between FGFR1 mRNA expression levels and any clinicopathological factors. Overall, the level of FGFR1 protein expression may be a biomarker of ER-positive/HER2-negative primary breast cancer with possible resistance to standard treatment, and may be a useful tool to identify more specific patients who would benefit from FGFR-1 targeted therapy.

The aim of our study was to explore the potential effect of IL-23 on cells of the neurovascular unit (NVU) under an oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) condition and the role of IL-23R in IL-23-mediated effect. OGD of primary cells of the NVU and permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) were used to produce experimental stroke in vitro and in vivo, respectively. IL-23 and IL-23R were detected by immunohistochemistry and western blot in pMCAO mice. Metabolic viability of cultured cells was assessed by MTT assay. The cell-associated proteins (Bcl-2, AQP4 and ET-1) were determined by western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Immunofluorescence staining and western blot were used to detect the IL-23R expression. The results showed that the expression of IL-23/IL-23R was elevated in pMCAO mice. IL-23 could aggravate neuron damage, astrocyte swelling, and further impair the integrity of blood-brain barrier induced by OGD. In addition, the effect of IL-23 on cells of the NVU is mediated by IL-23R and is likely IL-23R-expression-level dependent. However, there are no such biological properties for the IL-23p19 subunit alone. Our study provides the first evidence that IL-23 has a toxic effect on cells of the NVU under OGD stress, which is mediated by IL-23R. These results not only help us better understand the role of IL-23/IL-23R in brain ischemia, but also provide a potential therapeutic target in stroke. ",

The capacity of the recombinant HSPGs expressed in these cell lines to bind and present FGF-2 to the high-affinity receptor FGFR1 was addressed. This novel approach showed a minor difference in the binding and in the FGF-2 stimulating activity of rsCD44v3,8-10 HSPGs from fibroblasts and epithelial cells. However, FGF-2 binding of rsCD44v3,8-10 from IM9 and THP-1 cells was significantly lower, and stimulation of FGF-2 by rsCD44v3,8-10 from these two cell types could not be detected. We tested the possibility that the differences among cell types were related to the functional profile of endogenous HSPGs. The initial survey of a wider panel of cell types revealed high levels of HSPGs synthesis on the surface of 293 T, epithelial and IM9 cells, but low levels on the surface of other cells of hematopoietic origin. Surprisingly, native HSPGs from fibroblasts and epithelial cell lines promoted FGF-2 biological activity to vastly different extents, and cell surface HSPGs from IM9 cells induced an FGF-2 response.

Controls were conducted using primary antisera pre-adsorbed with the corresponding immunizing peptide.;All FGFR antisera showed strong labeling of inner retina [inner nuclear layer, inner plexiform layer and ganglion cell layer (INL, IPL and GCL respectively)] in rat and human retina, although there were distinct differences in individual patterns. FGFR-3 was particularly intense in ganglion cell bodies and dendrites, and was absent from photoreceptors and bipolar cells in vitro. FGFR-1 and FGFR-4 also labeled the outer nuclear layer (ONL), more intensely in adult than in young tissue, and FGFR-4 was especially prominent within inner segments. FGFR-2 and -3 were only weakly expressed in the ONL, but FGFR-2 showed specific labeling of cone outer segments in human retina. Candidate FGFR-signaling molecules also showed generally higher expression in the inner than outer retina in the different samples. Shc immunolabeling was apparent in the GCL and nascent photoreceptor outer segments in young and adult retina. SOS1 expression was much more intense than SOS2 in the ONL, although the latter showed selective intense staining of a sub-population in the INL and GCL. These ex vivo data were confirmed in cultures prepared from young rat retina. Pure photoreceptor cultures exhibited strong expression of FGFR-1 and -4, and faint expression of FGFR-2 and -3. In mixed inner retinal cultures, anti-FGFR-1 labeled neurons and Müller glia with equal intensity, while the other FGFR antisera showed preferential staining of neurons. FGFR-3 was strongly expressed by ganglion and amacrine cells but not by other types. Signaling molecules showed widespread expression, but of variable intensity, in all cells. All control experiments using corresponding peptide pre-adsorption led to complete removal of immunostaining.;Rat and human retinal cells showed a largely similar, widespread expression of multiple FGFR and candidate FGFR-related signaling molecules. Distinct differences in development, species, cell- and sub-cell type distribution were apparent, suggesting that specific FGFR/FGF ligands and transduction pathways may operate in different cells.",

We show that nuclear fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1) mediates cAMP-induced neuronal differentiation and regulates CREB and CREB binding protein (CBP) function in alpha-internexin-expressing human neuronal progenitor cells (HNPC). In proliferating HNPC, FGFR1 was associated with the cytoplasm and plasma membrane. Treatment with dB-cAMP induced nuclear accumulation of FGFR1 and caused neuronal differentiation, accompanied by outgrowth of neurites expressing MAP2 and neuron-specific neurofilament-L protein and enolase. HNPC transfected with nuclear/cytoplasmic FGFR1 or non-membrane FGFR1(SP-/NLS), engineered to accumulate exclusively in the cell nucleus, underwent neuronal differentiation in the absence of cAMP stimulation. In contrast, FGFR1/R4, with highly hydrophobic transmembrane domain of FGFR4, was membrane associated, did not enter the nucleus and failed to induce neuronal differentiation. Transfection of tyrosine kinase-deleted dominant negative receptor mutants, cytoplasmic/nuclear FGFR1(TK-) or nuclear FGFR1(SP-/NLS)(TK-), prevented cAMP-induced neurite outgrowth. Nuclear FGFR1 localized in speckle-like domains rich in phosphorylated histone 3 and splicing factors, regions known for active RNA transcription and processing, and activated the neurofilament-L gene promoter. FGFR1(SP-/NLS) transactivated CRE, up-regulated phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of CREB and stimulated the activity of CBP several-fold. Thus, cAMP-induced nuclear accumulation of FGFR1 provides a signal that triggers molecular events leading to neuronal differentiation.",

MMP regulates the production of high-energy phosphate and apoptotic cascading. Thus, MMP is an important parameter determining the fate of neurons. Differences in the time course of MMP according to the grading of the ischemic impact have not been clarified. MMP and intracellular ATP contents were monitored before and after short-term oxygen-glucose deprivation. A primary hippocampal culture seeded in a 35 mm fenestrated dish for fluorescence microscopy was mounted in a sealed chamber for an anaerobic incubation. A continuous flow of 100% nitrogen into the chamber and a replacement of glucose-free medium allowed the condition of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), thereby extrapolating ischemia. MMP was evaluated by the fluorescence of a voltage-dependent dye, JC-1, under fluorescence microscopy. The intracellular ATP content was evaluated in a hippocampal culture seeded in a 96-well plate by the luciferin-luciferase reaction after a designated period of OGD. During OGD, MMP decreased to 0.72+/-0.03 (normalized JC-1 fluorescence), then increased to the hyperpolarized level 1.99+/-0.12 during 60 min reoxygenation after 30 min OGD. MMP after 60 min OGD decreased and recovered occasionally during reoxygenation. After 90 min OGD and reoxygenation, MMP was reduced and never recovered. The intracellular ATP content was 8.1+/-6.6 and 3.2+/-1.9% after 30 min OGD and 30 min reoxygenation following 30 min OGD, respectively; 60 min OGD did not significantly change these levels (7.1+/-5.8, 2.6+/-0.5%). Hyperpolarization after OGD did not accompany ATP production. This observation suggests the inhibition of electron reentry into an inner membrane during reoxygenation and the disturbance of FoF1-ATP synthase. This pathological finding of an energy-producing system after OGD may provide a clue to explain post-ischemic energy failure.",

Recently, considerable attention has been focused on the cation-chloride cotransporters Na-K-Cl cotransporter isoform I (NKCC-1) and K-Cl cotransporter isoform II (KCC2), as they may play an important role in the disruption of ion gradients and subsequent ischemic damage. In this study, we examined the ability of cation-chloride transport inhibitors to influence the biochemical (i.e. ATP) and histological recovery of neurons in adult hippocampal slices exposed to OGD. In the hippocampus, 7 min of OGD caused a loss of ATP that recovered partially (approximately 50%) during 3 h of reoxygenation. Furosemide, which inhibits the NKCC-1 and KCC2 cotransporters, and bumetanide, a more specific NKCC-1 inhibitor, enhanced ATP recovery when measured 3 h after OGD. Furosemide and bumetanide also attenuated area CA1 neuronal injury after OGD. However, higher concentrations of these compounds appear to have additional non-specific toxic effects, limiting ATP recovery following OGD and promoting neuronal injury. The KCC2 cotransporter inhibitor DIOA and the Cl(-) ATPase inhibitor ethacrynic acid caused neuronal death even in the absence of OGD and promoted cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria, indicating non-specific toxicities of these compounds.",

Using in vivo and in vitro approaches, we investigated the involvement of the blood-brain barrier and the role of its cellular components.;Seven-minute occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery, used as in vivo IPC stimulus 4 days before permanent occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery, significantly reduced brain infarct size (8.45±0.7 versus 13.61±0.08 mm3 measured 7 days after injury) and preserved blood-brain barrier function (Evans blue leakage, 0.54±0.1 versus 0.89±0.1 ng/mg). Assessment of neuronal, endothelial, and glial gene expression revealed that IPC specifically increased glial fibrillary acidic protein mRNA, thus showing selective astrocyte activation in IPC-protected mice.;The blood-brain barrier was modeled by coculturing murine primary brain microvessel endothelial and astroglial cells. One-hour oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), delivered 24 hours before a 5-hour OGD, acted as an IPC stimulus, significantly attenuating the reduction in transendothelial electric resistance (199.17±11.7 versus 97.72±3.4 Ωcm2) and the increase in permeability coefficients for sodium fluorescein (0.98±0.11×10(-3) versus 1.8±0.36×10(-3) cm/min) and albumin (0.12±0.01×10(-3) versus 0.29±0.07×10(-3) cm/min) induced by severe OGD. IPC also prevented the 5-hour OGD-induced disorganization of the tight junction proteins ZO-1 and claudin-5. IPC on glial (but not endothelial) cells alone preserved transendothelial electric resistance, permeability coefficients, and ZO-1 localization after 5 hours of OGD. Astrocyte metabolic inhibition by fluorocitrate abolished IPC protection, confirming the critical role of astrocytes. IPC significantly increased glial fibrillary acidic protein, interleukin-6, vascular endothelial growth factor-a, and ciliary neurotrophic factor gene expression after OGD in glial cells, indicating that multiple pathways mediate the glial contribution to IPC.;Our data show that the blood-brain barrier can be directly preconditioned and that astrocytes are major mediators of IPC protection.",

One observation in this analysis was a widespread expression in the brain of all three FGFR mRNAs, according to the following rank order: FGFR1, diencephalon < telencephalon < mesencephalon and metencephalon < myelencephalon; FGFR2 and FGFR3, telencephalon < diencephalon < mesencephalon and metencephalon < myelencephalon. Another observation was an apparent cellular specificity in their basal expression. Thus, the FGFR1 mRNA was expressed mainly in large and weakly stained cells, whereas FGFR2 transcripts were expressed primarily in small and strongly stained cells and in cells of brain regions devoid of neuronal cells, such as the white matter. FGFR3 mRNA was always detected in small and strongly stained cells with scattered distribution and was not expressed in the white matter. However, FGFR2 mRNA was weakly expressed also in large cells localized in some nuclei of the lower brainstem, in the diagonal band, and in the septum. Furthermore, in the medial habenula and in the nuclei of the pons, there exists a high density of cells expressing both FGFR1 and FGFR2 (60-100%). With neurotoxic lesions involving 6-hydroxydopamine microinjections in the substantia nigra, reactive glial cells in the lesioned area and surrounding the cannula tract showed an increase in the expression of both FGFR1 and FGFR2 mRNAs, whereas no increased expression was found for FGFR3 mRNA. Taken together, these findings showed that these three FGF receptors exist in all subtypes of cells of each brain region. Their apparent cellular specificity suggests that these receptor subtypes can have a differential trophic role in the brain, reflecting the various biological activities shown by the ligands of the FGF family.",

Genotyping of the FLG mutations R501X and 2282del4 revealed wild-type alleles in all analysed samples.;The lack of filaggrin expression observed in the analysed corneal specimens from AD patients is not due to the two most common FLG mutations (R501X, 2282del4) but is most likely secondary to inflammation, as all keratitis specimens of non-AD patients showed lack of filaggrin expression as well.",

We examined whether CREB activation is a shared pathway underlying VEGF-A's protection in neurons and cerebral vascular endothelial cells. VEGF-A was used in a HI model of rat pups and in oxygen-glucose-deprivation (OGD) models of immortalized H19-7 neurons and b.End3 cerebral vascular endothelial cells. We found that VEGF-A activated VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), phosphorylated CREB in neurons and endothelial cells, and protected against HI, and inhibiting VEGFR-2 before VEGF-A reduced the protective effect of VEGF-A in rat pups. VEGF-A also up-regulated VEGFR-2 and phosphorylated CREB, and protected H19-7 neurons and b.End3 endothelial cells against OGD. Inhibiting VEGFR-2 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), respectively, reduced VEGF-A-induced CREB phosphorylation and protection of H19-7 and b.End3 cells against OGD. Transfecting H19-7 and b.End3 cells with a serine-133 phosphorylation mutant CREB also inhibited VEGF-A's protection of both types of cells.

Many antioxidants have been proven effective in ameliorating cerebral ischemia injury by inhibiting oxidative stress. DATS, an organosulfuric component of garlic oil, exhibits antioxidative effects. In present study, we used OGD model to investigate the neuroprotective effects of DATS and the mechanisms related to these effects. B35 neural cells exposed to OGD caused a decrease in cell viability and increases in the percentage of apoptotic cells and the level of intracellular cleaved caspase-3, all of which were markedly attenuated by DATS. Further, DATS treatment significantly increased Nrf2 expression and nuclear translocation, upregulated downstream gene HO-1 and inhibited intracellular ROS and MDA generation, all of which were markedly attenuated in cells transfected with Nrf2-specific siRNA. In addition, inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling by PI3K-specific siRNA not only decreased the expression level of Nrf2 and HO-1 proteins, but also diminished the antioxidative and neuroprotective effect of DATS. Taken together, these results indicate that DATS protects B35 neural cells against OGD-induced cell injury by inhibiting ROS production via upregulating the PI3K/Akt-mediated Nrf2 pathway, which further activates HO-1. Based on our results, DATS may be a potential candidate for intervention in hypoxic-ischemic brain injuries such as stroke. ",

To investigate the mechanism involved in ischemic stroke and to develop neuroprotective drugs/therapies, in vivo and in vitro, pharmacological models are needed. To investigate the cellular and molecular neuroprotective mechanisms of nerve growth factor (NGF), a member of the nervous system neurotrophin family of growth factors, under ischemia, we used an oxygen-glucose-deprivation (OGD) device and pheochromocytoma PC12 cells exposed to a paradigm of ischemic insult. Pretreatment of the cultures with 50 ng/mL of NGF, 18 h prior to OGD insult, conferred 30% of neuroprotection. Time-course experiments showed marked activation of the ERK, JNK, and p-38 MAPK isoforms during the OGD phase, but not during OGD reperfusion. Pretreatment of the cultures with 50 ng/mL of NGF, 18 h prior to OGD insult, resulted in 50% attenuation of OGD-induced activation of JNK 1, and 20% and 50% attenuation of OGD-induced activation of p-38 alpha and beta, respectively. The effect of NGF on gene expression in the PC12 ischemic model using Affymatrix Rat DNA-Microarray technology indicates that only 6% of the genes are differentially regulated (induced/suppressed) by OGD insult and/or NGF. These findings support the notion that pretreatment with NGF confers neuroprotection from OGD insult, a phenomenon coincidentally related to differential inhibition of MAPK stress kinase isoforms and differential gene expression. This ischemic model may be useful to investigate molecular mechanisms of OGD-induced neurotoxicity and NGF-induced neuroprotection, and to generate novel therapeutic concepts for stroke treatment.",

However, it is not known whether isoflurane application after ischemia provides neuroprotection.;Corticostriatal slices (400 microm) freshly prepared from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a 15-min oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD; to simulate ischemia in vitro). Isoflurane was applied after OGD. Brain slices were harvested 2 h after OGD for measuring 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) conversion to quantify cell injury. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were also subjected to middle cerebral arterial occlusion for 90 min and then treated with or without 2% isoflurane for 60 min started at the onset of reperfusion. The infarct volumes, neurologic deficit scores, and performance on rotarod were evaluated at 24 h after the onset of reperfusion.;Isoflurane applied immediately after the 15-min OGD for 30 min dose-dependently reversed the OGD-induced decrease of TTC conversion. The TTC conversion was 34 +/- 16% and 58 +/- 28% of the control, respectively, for OGD alone and OGD plus 2% isoflurane (P < 0.05, n = 12). Application of 2% isoflurane for 30 min started at 10 min after the OGD also reduced the OGD-decreased TTC conversion. The presence of 0.3 microm glibenclamide, a general adenosine 5'-triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel blocker, or 500 microm 5-hydroxydecanoic acid, a mitochondrial adenosine 5'-triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel blocker, during the application of 2% isoflurane abolished the isoflurane preservation of TTC conversion. Application of isoflurane during reperfusion also improved neurologic outcome after brain ischemia.;The results suggest that isoflurane administrated after OGD or brain ischemia provides neuroprotection. Mitochondrial adenosine 5'-triphosphate-sensitive potassium channels may be involved in this protection.",

The present study has further investigated the role of IL‑6, and explored potential signalling pathways in vitro. In vitro models were established by co‑culturing OGD‑injured PC12 cells with MSCs. Subsequently, the expression levels of the signalling molecules, Toll‑like receptor 2 (TLR2)/nuclear factor κB (NFκB), and IL‑6 were altered separately in this in vitro model by treatment with an agonist, antagonist, siRNA or overexpression adenovirus. The expression levels of B cell lymphoma‑associated X (Bax), TLR2, NFκB and IL‑6 were detected by western blot analysis, real‑time polymerase chain reaction or ELISA. The resting membrane potential (RMP) of the PC12 cells was analysed by whole‑cell patch‑clamp recordings. Compared with controls or the PC12 co‑culture group, the MSC co‑cultured group induced less expression of Bax, but more IL‑6 secretion. Up- or down-regulation of the TLR2/NFκB signalling pathway resulted in a corresponding increase or decrease in the IL‑6 expression level in the MSCs. Co‑culture with siIL‑6‑MSCs increased the expression levels of Bax and increased the RMP in the OGD PC12 cells. In conclusion, the release of IL‑6 from MSCs was regulated via the TLR2/NFκB signalling pathway. Endogenous IL‑6 reduced apoptosis and protected OGD‑injured PC12 cells when they were co‑cultured with MSCs. The present study has reported a novel immunomodulatory effect of the microenvironment of neural damage during MSC cytotherapy. ",

Their autocrine and nonautocrine activity in tumor progression of carcinoma was investigated in the NBT-II cell system. Cells were manipulated to either produce and be autocrine for FGF-1 or -2 or to only produce but not respond to these factors. The autocrine cells are highly invasive and tumorigenic and the determination of specific targets of FGF/fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling was assessed. In vitro studies showed that nonautocrine cells behave like epithelial parental cells, whereas autocrine cells have a mesenchymal phenotype correlated with the overexpression of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), the internalization of E-cadherin, and the redistribution of beta-catenin from the cell surface to the cytoplasm and nucleus. uPAR was defined as an early target, whereas E-cadherin and the leukocyte common antigen-related protein-tyrosine phosphatase (LAR-PTP) were later targets of FGF signaling, with FGFR1 activation more efficient than FGFR2 at modulating these targets. Behavior of autocrine cells was consistent with a decrease of tumor-suppressive activities of both E-cadherin and LAR-PTP. These molecular analyses show that the potential of these two growth factors in tumor progression is highly dependent on specific FGFR signaling and highlights its importance as a target for antitumor therapy.",

Some hippocampal GABAergic interneurons survive certain time after ischemia while ischemia-sensitive interneurons and pyramidal neurons are damaged. GABAergic signaling, nicotinic receptors expressing α7-subunit (α7nAChRs(+)) and connexin-36 (Cx36(+), electrotonic gapjunctions protein) contradictory modulate post-ischemic environment. We hypothesized that hippocampal ischemia-resistant GABAergic interneurons coexpressing glutamate decarboxylase-67 isoform (GAD67(+)), α7nAChRs(+), Cx36(+) are able to enhance neuronal viability. To check this hypothesis the histochemical and electrophysiological investigations have been performed using rat hippocampal organotypic culture in the condition of 30-min oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). Post-OGD reoxygenation (4h) revealed in CA1 pyramidal layer numerous damaged cells, decreased population spike amplitude and increased pair-pulse depression. In these conditions GAD67(+) interneurons displayed the OGD-resistance and significant increase of GABA synthesis/metabolism (GAD67-immunofluorescence, mitochondrial activity). The α7nAChRs(+) and Cx36(+) co-localizations were revealed in resistant GAD67(+) interneurons. Under OGD: GABAA-receptors (GABAARs) blockade increased cell damage and exacerbated the pair-pulse depression in CA1 pyramidal layer; α7nAChRs and Cx36-channels separate blockades sufficiently decreased cell damage while interneuronal GAD67-immunofluorescence and mitochondrial activity were similar to the control. Thus, hippocampal GABAergic interneurons co-expressing α7nAChRs and Cx36 remained resistant certain time after OGD and were able to modulate CA1 neuron survival through GABAARs, α7nAChRs and Cx36-channels activity. The enhancements of the neuronal viability together with GABA synthesis/metabolism normalization suggest cooperative neuroprotective mechanism that could be used for increase in efficiency of therapeutic strategies against post-ischemic pathology.",

Here, we report a detailed double-label immunohistochemical investigation of the localization patterns of FGF1 and its receptors FGFR1 and FGFR2 in adult and early postnatal mouse retinas. In adult retinas, FGF1 is localized to ganglion cells, horizontal cells, and photoreceptor inner and outer segments. FGFR1 is found in ganglion cells and Müller cells, whereas FGFR2 is primarily located in ganglion cells, the nuclei of Müller cells, and glycine-containing amacrine cells. During postnatal development, the patterns of FGF1, FGFR1, and FGFR2 immunostaining are similar to those in the adult, although transient FGF1-expressing cells have been detected in the proximal inner nuclear layer before eye opening. These patterns are consistent with a major involvement of FGF1, FGFR1, and FGFR2 in ganglion cell maturation (during development) and survival (in the adult). Moreover, FGF1 may affect amacrine cell development, whereas Müller cells appear to be regulated via both FGFR1 and FGFR2 throughout postnatal life. In immature retinas, large numbers of amacrine cells, including those containing calbindin and glycine, display both FGF1 and FGFR2 immunoreactivities in their nuclei, suggesting an action of FGF1 on FGFR2 leading to the maturation of these amacrine cells during a restricted period of postnatal development.",

Part of this hurdle implies the complex response to injury of the neurovascular unit increasing the cerebrovascular permeability at the level of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Previous studies reported neuroprotection in animal models upon activation of the nuclear receptor PPARalpha(peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor)alpha, but the cellular targets at the BBB level remain largely unexplored. Here, to study whether PPAR-alpha activation acts on BBB permeability, we adapted a mouse BBB cell model to ischaemic conditions at the stage of occlusion defined in vitro as oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). This model consists of a co-culture of brain capillary endothelial cells (ECs) on a filter insert placed upon a rat glial cell culture. The EC monolayer permeability increase induced by 4 h of OGD was significantly restricted after treatment with the PPAR-alpha agonist fenofibric acid (FA) 24 h before or at the onset of OGD. Treatments of separated ECs or glial cells showed that this protective effect was conferred by BBB ECs but not glial cells. Furthermore, co-cultures with ECs from PPAR-alpha-deficient mice revealed that FA had no effect on OGD-induced hyperpermeability. No transcriptional modulation of classical PPAR-alpha target genes such as SOD, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, ACO, CPT-1, PDK-4 or ET-1 was observed in wild type mouse ECs. In conclusion, these results suggest that part of the preventive PPAR-alpha-mediated protection may occur via BBB ECs by limiting hyperpermeability.",

Additionally, we hypothesized that increased buffering of intracellular calcium would shorten electrophysiological recovery after transient ischemia. Mouse hippocampal slices were exposed to 2 to 8 min of OGD. fEPSPs evoked by Schaffer collateral stimulation were recorded in the stratum radiatum, and whole cell current or voltage clamp recordings were performed in CA1 neurons. Transient ischemia led to increased presynaptic [Ca2+]i, (shown by calcium imaging), increased spontaneous miniature EPSP/Cs, and depressed evoked fEPSPs, partially mediated by adenosine. Buffering of intracellular Ca2+ during OGD by membrane-permeant chelators (BAPTA-AM or EGTA-AM) partially prevented fEPSP depression and promoted faster electrophysiological recovery when the OGD challenge was stopped. The blocker of BK channels, charybdotoxin (ChTX), also prevented fEPSP depression, but did not accelerate post-ischemic recovery. These results suggest that OGD leads to elevated presynaptic [Ca2+]i, which reduces evoked transmitter release; this effect can be reversed by increased intracellular Ca2+ buffering which also speeds recovery.

However, EETs levels were similar in both sexes and pharmacological inhibition of the hydrolase domain of sEH did not abolish the sex difference in cell death. Genetic knockout of sEH in mice abolished the sex difference observed in neurons isolated from these mice after OGD.;Cultured cortical neurons from females are more resistant to ischemia than neurons from males. Neurons from females have less sEH activity compared to neurons from males at baseline, although sEH levels were not measured after OGD. While pharmacological inhibition of the hydrolase domain of sEH does not affect cell death, knockout of the gene encoding sEH eradicates the sex difference seen in wild-type neurons, suggesting a role for further study of the lesser-known phosphatase domain of sEH and its role in sexual dimorphism in neuronal sensitivity to ischemia.",

Using organotypic cultures of rat hippocampal slices, we determined whether phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is activated in response to ischemic conditions (OGD; oxygen and glucose deprivation). The PLA2 activity in the pyramidal cell layer increased immediately following a 35-min exposure to OGD, which was likely to be mediated by selective activation of cytosolic Ca2+-dependent PLA2 subtype (cPLA2). This enhancement lasted for at least 24 h. Interestingly, no apparent increase was detected in the dentate gyrus. Twenty-four hours after the OGD exposure, neuronal death was detected mainly in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices. To examine whether the PLA2 activation is causally or protectively involved in the ischemic injury, we investigated the effect of pharmacological blockade of PLA2 on the OGD-induced neuronal death. The PLA2 inhibitor bromophenacyl bromide efficiently prevented the cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. Similar results were obtained for the selective cPLA2 inhibitor AACOCF3. However, the Ca2+-independent PLA2 inhibitor bromoenol lactone and the secretory PLA2 inhibitor LY311727 were virtually ineffective. These results suggest that cPLA2 plays a causative role in the neuronal death following OGD exposure. Thus, the present study may provide novel therapeutic targets for the development of neuroprotective agents.",

Molecular genetic studies have suggested that the activities of the transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), are closely linked to ischemia-induced neuronal death. However, the mechanisms through which HIF-1α functions remain poorly understood. In this study, primary cortical neurons were subjected to oxygen‑glucose deprivation (OGD) to establish a cell model of OGD/reperfusion (RP). HIF-1α mRNA and protein expression was measured by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. Cell proliferation was detected by MTT assay. Flow cytometric analysis was used to detect cell apoptosis and changes in mitochondrial mass. The expression of LC3-Ⅰ and LC3-Ⅱ was examined by western blot analysis. We found that HIF-1α increased cell proliferation and decreased cell apoptosis in our cell model of OGD/RP using cultured neonatal rat cortical neurons. The overexpression of HIF-1α significantly induced changes in mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial autophagy in cortical neurons. Moreover, the inhibition of HIF-1α markedly suppressed cell proliferation and mitochondrial autophagy. We also demonstrated that the HIF-1α-induced mitochondrial autophagy was accompanied by the inhibition of the mTOR pathway. This study provides direct in vitro evidence that HIF-1α overexpression triggers mitochondrial autophagy, thereby increasing neuronal survival.

        "Doc_abstract":"Perinatal hypoxia-ischemia (H-I) often manifests as cognitive and/or motor disturbances that appear early in development. Growing evidence indicates that neuroinflammation may exacerbate H-I injury. Resident microglia release proinflammatory cytokines and proteases in response to ischemia. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), in particular, activate cytokines and degrade basement membrane proteins. These actions ultimately permit entry of peripheral leukocytes into the CNS neuropil, enhancing neuroinflammation and cell death. Currently, the relative contributions of resident and peripheral immune cells to ischemic brain injury are unclear. The present study employed an ex vivo model of H-I through oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) to identify the cellular localization of MMP-9 in organotypic hippocampal slices from rat, and to determine whether inhibiting gelatin-degrading MMPs affords neuroprotection in the absence of peripheral immune cells. Immunohistochemistry revealed ubiquitous neuronal MMP-9 expression in both normoxic and hypoxic slices. Increased MMP-9 expression was detected in CD11b-positive microglia after 48 h exposure to OGD relative to normoxic controls. Consistent with these data, in situ zymography showed increased gelatinolytic activity after OGD. Gelatin-cleaved fluorescence localized to astrocytic processes and somata of various cellular morphologies. Treatment with either the MMP inhibitor AG3340 (prinomastat) or minocycline dampened OGD-induced gelatinolytic activity and neural injury, as measured by Fluoro-Jade staining, relative to vehicle controls. These results show that resident microglia, in the absence of peripheral immune cells, were sufficient to enhance neural injury after OGD in the organotypic hippocampal slice. Additionally, these effects were associated with upregulation or secretion of MMP-9, and were blocked after treatment with either the gelatinase-selective compound AG3340 or the anti-inflammatory compound minocycline. These data, coupled with the effectiveness of these compounds previously shown in vivo, support the selective targeting of gelatin-degrading MMPs and activated microglia as potential therapeutic approaches to combat neonatal H-I injury.",

However, the biological significance of this interaction remains largely elusive. In this study, we show that NCAM induces a specific, FGFR1-mediated cellular response that is remarkably different from that elicited by FGF-2. In contrast to FGF-induced degradation of endocytic FGFR1, NCAM promotes the stabilization of the receptor, which is recycled to the cell surface in a Rab11- and Src-dependent manner. In turn, FGFR1 recycling is required for NCAM-induced sustained activation of various effectors. Furthermore, NCAM, but not FGF-2, promotes cell migration, and this response depends on FGFR1 recycling and sustained Src activation. Our results implicate NCAM as a nonconventional ligand for FGFR1 that exerts a peculiar control on the intracellular trafficking of the receptor, resulting in a specific cellular response. Besides introducing a further level of complexity in the regulation of FGFR1 function, our findings highlight the link of FGFR recycling with sustained signaling and cell migration and the critical role of these events in dictating the cellular response evoked by receptor activation.",

C. nutans is a traditional herbal medicine widely used for snake bite, viral infection and cancer in Asian countries. However, its role in protecting stroke damage remains to be studied. Despite of growing evidence to support epigenetic regulation in the pathogenesis and recovery of stroke, a clear understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms is still lacking. In the present study, primary cortical neurons were subjected to in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-reoxygenation and hypoxic neuronal death was used to investigate the interaction between C. nutans and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Using pharmacological agents (HDAC inhibitor/activator), loss-of-function (HDAC siRNA) and gain-of-function (HDAC plasmid) approaches, we demonstrated an early induction of HDAC1/2/3/8 and HDAC6 in neurons after OGD insult. C. nutans extract selectively inhibited HDAC1 and HDAC6 expression and attenuated neuronal death. Results of reporter analysis further revealed that C. nutans suppressed HDAC1 and HDAC6 transcription. Besides ameliorating neuronal death, C. nutans also protected astrocytes and endothelial cells from hypoxic-induced cell death. In summary, results support ability for C. nutans to suppress post-hypoxic HDACs activation and mitigate against OGD-induced neuronal death. This study further opens a new avenue for the use of herbal medicines to regulate epigenetic control of brain injury. ",

Ying, N. Ling, and A. Baird. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1994. 91:9170-9174). These proteins circulate in blood and have been proposed to modulate the biological activity of the FGF family of proteins. Immunohistochemical studies now demonstrate that these soluble, truncated FGF receptors are also present in the basement membranes of retinal vascular endothelial cells. These immunoreactive proteins can be detected with antibodies raised to the extracellular domain of FGFR-1 but not with antibodies raised to either the juxtamembrane domain or the cytoplasmic domain of FGFR-1. Western blotting of human retinal extracts with the antibody raised to the extracellular domain of FGFR-1 detects specific, low molecular mass proteins at 85 kD and 55 kD, corresponding in size to the FGF-BPs, which are not detected with antibodies against the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. The interaction of this receptor with the extracellular matrix is not dependent on the presence of FGF-2. Immunoreactive receptors are still detected in vascular basement membranes after the removal of FGF-2 with heparitinase. In addition, the recombinant extracellular domain of FGFR-1 continues to bind to corneal endothelial cell matrix after endogenous FGF-2 has been removed with 2 M NaCl. Acid treatment, which has been shown to disrupt protein interactions with the extracellular matrix, leads to a significant reduction in the presence of the matrix form of the FGF receptor. This loss can be restored with exogenous incubations of the recombinant extracellular domain of FGFR-1. This report is the first demonstration that a truncated form of a high affinity growth factor receptor can be localized to the extracellular matrix. These findings add to the list of binding proteins associated with the extracellular matrix (IGFBP-5) and suggest a potentially new regulatory mechanism for controlling the biological availability of FGF, and other peptide growth factors, in the extracellular matrix.",

Furthermore, NMNAT1 overexpression regulated neuron survival via AMPK activation, as NMNAT1 overexpression enhanced AMPK activity in OGD-treated cortical neurons, and AMPK inhibitor blocked LV-NMNAT1-induced neuroprotection in OGD-treated cortical neurons. In addition, NMNAT1 overexpression could reduce brain infarction size and improve behavioral outcomes in mice with ischemic stroke. These results suggested that up-regulation of NMNAT1 could induce neuroprotection against ischemic injury through AMPK activation and indicated that NMNAT1 is a potential therapeutic target for stroke.",

Studies along the years have demonstrated its beneficial effect in various neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. The subject of this study was to evaluate whether berberine protects against delayed neuronal cell death in organotypic hippocampal culture (OHC) exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and the cell signaling mechanism related to its effect. Hippocampal slices were obtained from 6 to 8-days-old male Wistar rat and cultured for 14 days. Following, the cultures were exposed for 1h to OGD and then treated with Berberine (10 and 20μM). After 24h recovery, propidium iodide (PI) uptake was analyzed and a decrease was observed in PI uptake on OGD Ber-treated culture, which means a decrease in cellular death. Western blot analysis showed that proteins Akt, GSK3β, ERK and JNK appear to play a role in berberine-mediated neuroprotection. Furthermore, capase-3 activity of OGD Ber-treated culture was diminished by control level in a fluorimetry assay. These findings suggest that berberine-mediated neuroprotection after ischemia involves Akt/GSK3β/ERK 1/2 survival/apoptotic signaling pathway as well as JNK and caspase-3 activity inhibition. ",

Increasing evidence indicates that estrogen exerts protective effects through mitochondrial mechanisms. We previously found 17beta-estradiol (E2) to improve mitochondrial efficiency and reduce mitochondrial superoxide in brain blood vessels and endothelial cells. Thus we hypothesized E2 will preserve mitochondrial function and protect brain endothelial cells against ischemic damage. To test this, an in vitro ischemic model, oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)/reperfusion, was applied to immortalized mouse brain endothelial cells (bEnd.3). OGD/reperfusion-induced cell death was prevented by long-term (24, 48 h), but not short-term (0.5, 12 h), pretreatment with 10 nmol/L E2. Protective effects of E2 on endothelial cell viability were mimicked by an estrogen-receptor (ER) agonist selective for ERalpha (PPT), but not by one selective for ERbeta (DPN). In addition, E2 significantly decreased mitochondrial superoxide and preserved mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP levels in early stages of OGD/reperfusion. All of the E2 effects were blocked by the ER antagonist, ICI-182,780. These findings indicate that E2 can preserve endothelial mitochondrial function and provide protection against ischemic injury through ER-mediated mechanisms.",

This study investigated the mechanism by which in vitro ischemia (oxygen-glucose deprivation; OGD) affects canonical hypoxic HIF-1α stabilization. We validated the use of a reporter containing the oxygen-dependent degradation domain of HIF-1α fused to firefly luciferase (ODD-luc) to monitor quantitatively distinct biochemical events leading to hypoxic HIF-1α expression or stabilization in a human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y). When OGD was imposed following a 2-hr hypoxic stabilization of ODD-luc, the levels of the reporter were reduced, consistent with prior models proposing that OGD enhances HIF prolylhydroxylase (PHD) activity. Surprisingly, PHD inhibitors and proteasome inhibitors do not stabilize ODD-luc in OGD. Furthermore, OGD does not affect the half-life of ODD-luc protein following hypoxia, suggesting that OGD abrogates hypoxic HIF-1α induction by reducing HIF-1α synthesis rather than by enhancing its degradation. We observed ATP depletion under OGD vs. hypoxia and propose that ATP depletion enhances translational suppression, overcoming the selective synthesis of HIF concurrent with global decreases in protein synthesis in hypoxia. Taken together, these findings biochemically characterize a practical reporter for monitoring HIF-1α levels and support a novel model for HIF regulation in an in vitro model of human ischemia.",

In order to investigate the neuroprotective mechanisms by which relaxin may protect the brain, we investigated the possibility that relaxin protects astrocytes from hypoxia or oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD). Cultured astrocytes were pre-treated with either relaxin-2 or relaxin-3 and exposed to OGD for 24 or 48 hours. Following OGD exposure, viability assays showed that relaxin-treated cells exhibited a higher viability when compared to astrocytes that experienced OGD-alone. Next, to test whether relaxin reduced the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) astrocytes were exposed to the same conditions as the previous experiment and a commercially available ROS detection kit was used to detect ROS production. Astrocytes that were treated with relaxin-2 and relaxin-3 showed a marked decrease in ROS production when compared to control astrocytes that were exposed only to OGD. Finally, experiments were performed to determine whether or not the mitochondrial membrane potential was affected by relaxin treatment during 24 hour OGD. Mitochondrial membrane potential was higher in astrocytes that were treated with relaxin-2 and relaxin-3 compared to untreated OGD-alone astrocytes. Taken together, these data present novel findings that show relaxin protects astrocytes from ischemic conditions through the reduction of ROS production and the maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential.

N20.1 cells (mouse OLG cell line) were transferred into an anaerobic chamber for 3 hr in glucose-free and serum-free medium. After OGD incubation, OLG cultures were divided into the following groups: 1) OGD alone, 2) OLG cocultured with BMSCs, 3) treatment with the phosphoinostide 3-kinase (PI3k) inhibitor LY294002, 4) LY294002-treated OLGs with BMSC cocultured, and 5) anti-p75 antibody-treated OLGs. After an additional 3 hr of reoxygenation incubation, OLG viability and apoptosis were measured. The mRNA expression in the BMSCs and OLGs was analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Serine/threonine-specific protein kinase (Akt), phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), p75, and caspase 3 protein expressions in OLGs were measured by Western blot. Our results suggest that BMSCs produce growth factors, activate the Akt pathway, and increase the survival of OLGs. BMSCs also reduce p75 and caspase 3 expressions in the OGD-OLGs, which leads to decreased OLG apoptosis. BMSCs participate in OLG protection that may occur with promoting growth factors/PI3K/Akt and inhibiting the p75/caspase pathways.

In vivo, rats received 2.8 M D-glucose or arabinose (1 ml/100 g; i.p.) prior to undergoing two hours of middle cerebral artery occlusion and transcardiac fixation for electron microscopy. In vitro, brain endothelial cells were exposed to a PC impulse (short-term oxygen glucose deprivation; OGD) prior to an injurious event (5 hours OGD). Endothelial injury was assessed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release. Hyperglycemia during cerebral ischemia resulted in marked changes in endothelial morphology and mitochondrial swelling. Thus, in the ischemic hemisphere, there was no evidence of endothelial mitochondrial swelling in normoglycemic rats (mean profile width 0.22 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.17 +/- 0.01 microm in contralateral hemisphere) but there was marked swelling in hyperglycemic rats (0.44 +/- 0.02 microm). In vitro, cells preconditioned with one hour of OGD one day prior to 5 hours of OGD, showed reduced lactate dehydrogenase release (p < 0.05). In conclusion, hyperglycemia may have specific adverse effects on endothelial cell mitochondria during ischemia. Preventing those effects may help to ameliorate blood-brain barrier disruption on reperfusion.

However, their functions in cerebral ischemia remain largely unknown. Through an lncRNA array analysis in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), we have identified CAMK2D-associated transcript 1 (C2dat1) as a novel I/R-induced lncRNA that regulated the expression of CaMKIIδ in murine models of focal cerebral ischemia. C2dat1 mRNA was upregulated in a time-dependent manner in mouse cortical penumbra after focal ischemic brain injury, which was accompanied by increased expression of CaMKIIδ at transcript and protein levels. The expression patterns of C2dat1 and CAMK2D were confirmed in mouse Neuro-2a cells in response to in vitro ischemia (oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation, OGD/R). Knockdown of C2dat1 resulted in a significant blockade of CaMKIIδ expression, and potentiated OGD/R-induced cell death. Mechanistically, reduced CaMKIIδ expression upon silencing C2dat1 inhibited OGD/R-induced activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Further analysis showed that the downregulation of IKKα and IKKβ expression and phosphorylation, and subsequent inhibition of IκBα degradation accounted for the inhibition of the NF-κB signaling activity caused by silencing C2dat1. In summary, we discovered a novel I/R-induced lncRNA C2dat1 that modulates the expression of CaMKIIδ to impact neuronal survival, and may be a potential target for therapeutic intervention of ischemic brain injury.

We recorded transient reversal PERG and P-VEP in response to the stimulation of one eye at three spatial frequencies (2.2, 1.1 and 0.5 c/d).;Our results showed a statistically significant reduction in PERG amplitude in class 5, while the P-VEP amplitude was already reduced in class 2.;The electrofunctional tests were useful to detect small changes in the visual function of patients affected by initial stages of OGD. Therefore, P-VEP and PERG recordings appear to be a useful tool for early diagnosis of the optic nerve involvement in Graves' disease.",

Here, we show a new link between FGFR1 and the cell adhesion molecule neurofascin, which is important for neurite outgrowth. After overexpression in HEK293 cells, embryonal neurofascin isoform NF166 was able to associate with FGFR1, whereas the adult isoform NF186, differing from NF166 in additional extracellular sequences, was deficient. Pharmacological inhibitors and overexpression of dominant negative components of the FGFR signaling pathway pointed to the activation of FGFR1 after association with neurofascin in neurite outgrowth assays in chick tectal neurons and rat PC12-E2 cells. Both extra- and intracellular domains of embryonal neurofascin isoform NF166 were able to form complexes with FGFR1 independently. However, the cytosolic domain was both necessary and sufficient for the activation of FGFR1. Cytosolic serine residues 56 and 100 were shown to be essential for the neurite outgrowth-promoting activity of neurofascin, whereas both amino acid residues were dispensable for FGFR1 association. In conclusion, the data suggest a neurofascin intracellular domain, which activates FGFR1 for neurite outgrowth, whereas the extracellular domain functions as an additional, regulatory FGFR1 interaction domain in the course of development.",

OAZ1 is also involved in other major cellular events, including differentiation and apoptosis. Recent studies have shown that OAZ1 has tumor suppressor activities and its effects on cell proliferation and differentiation have been reported in several cancer cell lines. To explore the role of OAZ1 in human oral cancer, the effects of OAZ1 were studied on the proliferation and differentiation of human malignant oral cancer cell line, SCC15. MTT assay and flow cytometry analysis showed that stable OAZ1 expression in SCC15 significantly inhibited cell proliferation (P<0.001) and induced G0/G1 arrest with the G1‑phase cells increased from 55.83 to 65.26%. Morphological observation revealed the increased formation of epithelial islands. Further results from quantitative reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis proved the upregulation of several terminal differentiation marker genes (K10, FLG and LOR) in OAZ1‑expressed SCC15 cells. To elucidate the possible mechanism of LOR upregulation by OAZ1, further experiments were performed and it was found that the OAZ1 expression inhibited Smad nuclear interacting protein 1 (SNIP1) at the protein level and RNA interference of SNIP1 in SCC15 cells, which increased the expression of LOR. These results show that OAZ1 simultaneously inhibits the proliferation and induces the differentiation of oral cancer cells in humans. The effects on cellular differentiation depend partly on the degradation of SNIP1.",

Ovarian cancer represents a promising target for virotherapy, since the virus can be delivered locally into the peritoneal cavity. Both epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) are overexpressed in the majority of human tumors, including ovarian cancer. To generate adenoviral vectors with improved tumor specificity, we generated a panel of Ad5 vectors with altered tropism for EGFR and FGFR, rather than the natural Ad5 receptor, hCAR. We have included mutations within AB loop of the viral fiber knob (KO1 mutation) to preclude interaction with hCAR, combined with insertions in the HI loop to incorporate peptides that bind either EGFR (peptide YHWYGYTPQNVI, GE11) or FGFR1 (peptides MQLPLAT, M*, and LSPPRYP, LS). Viruses were produced to high titers, and the integrity of the fiber protein was validated by Western blotting. The KO1 mutation efficiently ablated hCAR interactions, and significantly increased transduction was observed in hCAR(low)/EGFR(high) cell lines using Ad5.GE11, while transduction levels using Ad5.M* or Ad5.LS were not increased. In the presence of physiological concentrations of human blood clotting factor X (hFX), significantly increased levels of transduction via the hFX-mediated pathway were observed in cell lines, but not in primary tumor cells derived from epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) ascites samples. Ad5-mediated transduction of EOC cells was completely abolished by the presence of 2.5% serum from patients, while, surprisingly, incorporation of the GE11 peptide resulted in significant evasion of neutralization in the same samples. We thus speculate that incorporation of the YHWYGYTPQNVI dodecapeptide within the fiber knob domain may provide a novel means of circumventing preexisting Ad5 immunity that warrants further investigation.

Danusertib (formerly PHA-739358) is a small ATP competitive molecule that inhibits aurora A, B and C kinases. Interestingly, danusertib also inhibits several receptor tyrosine kinases such as Abl, Ret, FGFR-1 and TrkA.

However, hematopoietic side effects are unwanted for neuroprotection, underlining the need for EPO-like compounds with selective neuroprotective actions. One such compound, devoid of hematopoietic bioactivity, is the chemically modified, EPO-derivative carbamylerythropoietin (CEPO). For comparison of the neuroprotective effects of CEPO and EPO, we subjected organotypic hippocampal slice cultures to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) or N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) excitotoxicity. Hippocampal slice cultures were pretreated for 24 h with 100 IU/ml EPO (=26 nM) or 26 nM CEPO before OGD or NMDA lesioning. Exposure to EPO and CEPO continued during OGD and for the next 24 h until histology, as well as during the 24 h exposure to NMDA. Neuronal cell death was quantified by cellular uptake of propidium iodide (PI), recorded before the start of OGD and NMDA exposure and 24 h after. In cultures exposed to OGD or NMDA, CEPO reduced PI uptake by 49+/-3 or 35+/-8%, respectively, compared to lesion-only controls. EPO reduced PI uptake by 33+/-5 and 15+/-8%, respectively, in the OGD and NMDA exposed cultures. To elucidate a possible mechanism involved in EPO and CEPO neuroprotection against OGD, the integrity of alpha-II-spectrin cytoskeletal protein was studied. Both EPO and CEPO significantly reduced formation of spectrin cleavage products in the OGD model. We conclude that CEPO is at least as efficient neuroprotectant as EPO when excitotoxicity is modeled in mouse hippocampal slice cultures.",

The current study was based on the observation that transplantation of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) promoted the neurological function improvement in stroked mice and meanwhile enhanced angiogenesis in the stroked hemisphere. Grafted hUCMSCs secreted human vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). Notch1 signaling was activated after stroke and also in the grafted hUCMSCs. To address the potential mechanism that might mediate such pro-angiogenic effect, we established a hUCMSC-neuron co-culture system. Neurons were subjected to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) injury before co-culturing to mimic the in vivo cell transplantation. Consistent with the in vivo data, co-culture medium claimed from hUCMSC-OGD neuron co-culture system significantly promoted the capillary-like tube formation of brain-derived endothelial cells. Moreover, coincident with our in vivo data, Notch 1 signaling activation was detected in hUCMSCs after co-cultured with OGD neurons as demonstrated by the up-regulation of key Notch1 signaling components Notch1 and Notch1 intercellular domain (NICD). In addition, OGD-neuron co-culture also increased the VEGF-A production by hUCMSCs. To verify whether Notch1 activation was involved in the pro-angiogenic effect, γ-secretase inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) was added into the co-culture medium before co-culture. It turned out that DAPT significantly prevented the Notch1 activation in hUCMSCs after co-culture with OGD neurons. More importantly, the pro-angiogenic effect of hUCMSCs was remarkably abolished by DAPT addition as demonstrated by inhibited capillary-like tube formation and less VEGF-A production. Regarding how Notch1 signaling was linked with VEGF-A secretion, we provided some clue that Notch1 effector Hes1 mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated by OGD-neuron co-culturing and down-regulated after additional treatment of DAPT. In summary, our data provided evidence that the VEGF-A secretion from hUCMSCs after being triggered by OGD neurons is Notch1 signaling associated. This might be a possible mechanism that contributes to the angiogenic effect of hUCMSC transplantation in stroked brain. ",

Thus, astrocytes show a remarkable resistance to short periods of ischemia that are well known to cause neuronal death. We have used a cell culture model of stroke, oxygen, and glucose deprivation (OGD), to clarify the mechanisms responsible for the exclusive resistance of astrocytes to ischemia. The expression of genes implicated in both ischemia-induced astrocyte death and post-ischemic survival was analysed by the RNA differential display technique. Our study revealed that the expression of the CEBP homologous protein (CHOP)-coding gene is promptly an intensely upregulated following astrocyte oxygen and glucose deprivation. CHOP mRNA induction was accompanied by the activation of other genes (grp78, grp95) that, alike CHOP, are involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. In addition, drugs that cause ER calcium depletion or protein N-glycosylation inhibition mimicked the effects of OGD on astrocyte survival, further supporting the involvement of ER in the astrocyte responses to OGD. Our experiments also demonstrated that upregulation of CHOP during the ER stress response is required for ischemia to cause astrocyte death. Not only the levels of CHOP mRNA and protein correlate perfectly with the degree of OGD-triggered cell injury, but also astrocyte death induced by OGD is significantly overcome by CHOP antisense oligonucleotide treatment. Nevertheless, we observed that astrocytes undergo apoptosis only when CHOP is permanently upregulated, and not when CHOP increases are transient. Finally, we found that the extent of CHOP induction is determined by the length of the ischemic stimulus. Taken together, our results indicate that permanent upregulation of CHOP is decisive for the induction of astrocyte death by OGD.",

Increased formation of reactive physiological dicarbonyl compound methylglyoxal (MGO) seems to be implicated in the development of diabetic vascular complication due to its protein glycation and oxidative stress effect. Edaravone, a novel radical scavenger, has been reported to display the advantageous effects on ischemic stroke both in animals and clinical trials; however, little is known about whether edaravone has protective effects on diabetic cerebrovascular injury. Using cultured human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC), protective effects of edaravone on MGO and MGO enhancing oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) induced injury were investigated. Cell injury was measured by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) formation, cell account, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and Rhodamine 123 staining. Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) formation and receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) expression were measured by western blotting. Cellular oxidative stress was measured by reactive oxygen species (ROS) release. Treatment of MGO for 24 h significantly induced HBMEC injury, which was inhibited by pretreatment of edaravone from 10-100 µmol/l. What's more, treatment of MGO enhanced AGEs accumulation, RAGE expression and ROS release in the cultured HBMEC, which were inhibited by 100 µmol/l edaravone. Finally, treatment of MGO for 24 h and then followed by 3 h OGD insult significantly enhanced cell injury when compared with OGD insult only, which was also protected by 100 µmol/l edaravone. Thus, edaravone protected HBMEC from MGO and MGO enhancing OGD-induced injury by inhibiting AGEs/RAGE/oxidative stress. ",

Then we demonstrated that Neuro2a cells stably expressing c-Fos exclusively in the mitochondria were more vulnerable to stressors such as OGD, rotenone (which is known to induce mitochondrial dysfunction) and hydrogen peroxide (a reactive oxygen species). Since mitochondrial dysfunction and the generation of reactive oxygen species are known to be caused by OGD, our findings indicate that mitochondrial c-Fos increases neuronal vulnerability to brain ischemia.

The role of the focal adhesion and extracellular-regulated kinases pathways in these effects were examined in both postconditioning and preconditioning.;Slices were obtained from P5 mouse. In postconditioning experiments, Dexmedetomidine (1 microm) was incubated 60 min after the end of OGD. In preconditioning experiments, dexmedetomidine was applied 3 h before OGD. Pharmacologic modulation of the studied pathways was achieved by using selective inhibitors of these cascades. Cell death was assessed 72 h after OGD using propidium iodide labeling and protein expression of activated caspase 3.;Maximum cell death increased with the duration of OGD. Dexmedetomidine induced a postconditioning effect in the CA1 (but not dentate gyrus) subfield area, which was significantly reduced by modulators of the focal adhesion and the extracellular-regulated kinases pathways. The combination of the inhibitors of the two pathways completely abolished the postconditioning effect of dexmedetomidine. The preconditioning effect of dexmedetomidine against ischemia-induced injury was observed in all hippocampal subfield areas. Results obtained with the pharmacologic modulation used for postconditioning also applied to dexmedetomidine-induced preconditioning.;Dexmedetomidine exhibits significant, but moderate, postconditioning properties against oxygen and glucose deprivation-induced injury.

Activin A (ActA), belonging to transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) super family, plays an important role in the hypoxic-ischemic brain injury through ActA/Smads pathway. While as an essential phosphorylation assistor in TGF-β signaling, the functions and mechanisms of smad anchor for receptor activation (SARA) in ischemic brain injury remain poorly understood. To solve this problem and explore the pathological processes of ischemic stroke, we used an Oxygen-Glucose deprivation (OGD) model in nerve growth factor-induced differentiated rattus PC12 pheochromocytoma cells and down regulated the expressions of SARA by RNA interference technology. Our results showed that the repression of SARA before OGD exposure reduced the expressions of Smad2, 3, 4 mRNA and the phosphorylation rate of Smad2 protein, but it did not affect the mRNA expressions of Smad7. After OGD treatment, ActA/Smads pathway was activated and the expression of SARA in the SARA pre-repression group was significantly up-regulated. The pre-repression of SARA increased the sensitivities of nerve-like cells to OGD damage. Moreover, the mRNA expression of Smad7 which was supposed to participate in the negative feedback of ActA/Smads pathway was also elevated due to OGD injury. Taken together, these results suggest a positive role of SARA in assisting the phosphorylation of Smad2 and maintaining the neuron protective effect of ActA/Smads pathway.",

However, the underlying mechanism of miR-134 in regulating cerebral ischemic injury remains poorly understood. The current study was designed to delineate the molecular basis of miR-134 in regulating cerebral ischemic injury. Using the oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model of hippocampal neuron ischemia in vitro, we found that the overexpression of miR-134 mediated by recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector infection significantly promoted neuron death induced by OGD/reoxygenation, whereas the inhibition of miR-134 provided protective effects against OGD/reoxygenation-induced cell death. Moreover, cyclic AMP (cAMP) response element-binding protein (CREB) as a putative target of miR-134 was downregulated and upregulated by miR-134 overexpression or inhibition, respectively. The direct interaction between miR-134 and the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of CREB mRNA was further confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Overexpression of miR-134 also inhibited the expression of the downstream gene of CREB, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2, whereas the inhibition of miR-134 upregulated the expression of BDNF and Bcl-2 in neurons after OGD/reoxygenation. Notably, the knockdown of CREB by CREB siRNA apparently abrogated the protective effect of anti-miR-134 on OGD/reoxygenation-induced cell death. Taken together, our study suggests that downregulation of miR-134 alleviates ischemic injury through enhancing CREB expression and downstream genes, providing a promising and potential therapeutic target for cerebral ischemic injury.

However, to achieve more potent and prolonged activity in such populations, a selective FGFR inhibitor is still needed. Here, we report the identification of CH5183284/Debio 1347, a selective and orally available FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 inhibitor that has a unique chemical scaffold. By interacting with unique residues in the ATP-binding site of FGFR1, FGFR2, or FGFR3, CH5183284/Debio 1347 selectively inhibits FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 but does not inhibit kinase insert domain receptor (KDR) or other kinases. Consistent with its high selectivity for FGFR enzymes, CH5183284/Debio 1347 displayed preferential antitumor activity against cancer cells with various FGFR genetic alterations in a panel of 327 cancer cell lines and in xenograft models. Because of its unique binding mode, CH5183284/Debio 1347 can inhibit FGFR2 harboring one type of the gatekeeper mutation that causes resistance to other FGFR inhibitors and block FGFR2 V564F-driven tumor growth.

Overproduction of several growth factors in a variety of human tumors and cell lines derived from these tumors has been reported. We have screened several cell lines derived from glioblastomas for anomalies in the expression of genes encoding transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha), TGF-beta, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and its high-affinity receptor, flg. Compared with normal human brain tissue, we observed a generalized elevation in the levels of expression of these genes in glioblastoma cell lines and an SV40-transformed human astroglial cell line. Overexpression of these genes does not appear to be merely a reflection of the proliferative state of transformed cells since some other human tumor cell lines, when analysed for the expression of TGF-beta and bFGF, did not show a significant increase in these transcripts. The specificity of the elevated transcription of TGF-alpha, TGF-beta, bFGF and flg in glioblastoma cell lines is further suggested by the fact that the transcription of the proto-oncogene c-erbB2, which is overproduced in breast tumor cell lines, was not elevated in glioblastoma cell lines.

This study was designed to determine whether endogenous glial progenitor cells derived from either the subventricular zone (SVZ) or the white matter (WM) contribute to WM repair in a neonatal rat model of ischemic periventricular leukomalacia (PVL). Additionally, the role of G protein-coupled receptor 17 (GPR17), recently shown to act as a sensor for WM damage, was explored to assess its potential recruitment and activation of endogenous glial progenitor cells for such WM self-repair. Our in vivo and in vitro models consisted of five-day-old neonatal rats or cultured glial progenitor cells derived from both the SVZ and WM of these rats, randomly divided into sham/control and induced ischemic PVL/oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) groups. The WM of all PVL rats showed either mild or severe histopathological changes, with significantly increased in vivo apoptosis and poor myelination compared to those of the sham group. Significantly more apoptotic and necrotic cells were also detected in the OGD glial progenitor cell cultures derived from the SVZ and WM at all time intervals. The glial progenitor cells were significantly increased in both the SVZ (NG2⁺/GPR17⁻/BrdU⁺) and WM (NG2⁺/GPR17⁺/BrdU⁺) within 72 h after PVL; preOLs were also increased significantly in both the SVZ (O4⁺/GPR17⁻/BrdU⁺) and WM (O4⁺/GPR17⁺/BrdU⁺) within 7d after PVL in vivo or OGD in vitro. However, the more differentiated CNPase⁺/GPR17⁻/BrdU⁺ and MBP⁺/GPR17⁻/BrdU⁺ OLs in the SVZ and WM remained significantly less than those in the sham groups up to 14d or 21d after OGD or PVL, respectively. Hence, both the WM and SVZ were found to be potential endogenous sources of glial progenitor cells for WM repair in PVL rats. However their endogenous self-repair capacity appeared to be limited, since the more mature OLs did not completely recover from experimental ischemia, even after 14-21d.",

Both PNQX and MK-801 displayed significant neuroprotective effects in all hippocampal subfields when present during and after OGD. When added just after OGD, only PNQX retained some neuroprotective effect. When added 2 h after OGD neither PNQX nor MK-801 had an effect. Transient global cerebral ischemia was induced in Mongolian gerbils by occlusion of both common carotid arteries for 4.5 min, with PNQX (10 mg/kg) being injected i.p. 30, 60 and 90 min after the insult. Subsequent analysis of brain sections stained for the neurodegeneration marker Fluoro-Jade B and immunostained for the astroglial marker glial fibrillary acidic protein revealed a significant PNQX-induced decrease in neuronal cell death and astroglial activation.

Nuclear FGFR1 and CBP interact with and regulate numerous genes on various chromosomes. FGFR1 dynamic oscillatory interactions with chromatin and with specific genes, underwrites gene regulation mediated by diverse developmental signals. Integrative Nuclear FGFR1 Signaling (INFS) effects the differentiation of stem cells and neural progenitor cells via the gene-controlling Feed-Forward-And-Gate mechanism. Nuclear accumulation of FGFR1 occurs in numerous cell types and disruption of INFS may play an important role in developmental disorders such as schizophrenia, and in metastatic diseases such as cancer. Enhancement of INFS may be used to coordinate the gene regulation needed to activate cell differentiation for regenerative purposes or to provide interruption of cancer stem cell proliferation.",

The pathogenesis of MAIDS-related lymphoma/cytopenia is unknown but it has been postulated to involve a defective marrow microenvironment or stroma. The basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF) of stromal origin is an important stimulator for hematopoietic progenitors of several lineages. Long-term bone marrow cultures (LTBMCs) were established and pure stromal cell cultures were used for in vitro infection hematopoietic reconstitution studies. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to analyze bFGF gene expression in stromal cells derived from either viral-infected marrow or uninfected marrow. RT-PCR analysis showed a 40% reduction in the expression of bFGF transcript expression from viral-infected stromal cells, however, the levels of bek and flg bFGF receptors remained unchanged indicating virus-infection only inhibited bFGF gene expression in stromal cells. Viral infection was associated with a progressive decrease in bFGF transcript expression 35% of control at day 7, 50% of control at day 14 and 60% of control at day 21 compared to the mock-infected cultures. In addition, for bek and flg the transcript expression in, in vitro-infected primary cultures were comparable to the mock-infected cultures and remained essentially unchanged throughout culture period. Western blot analysis revealed viral-infected stromal cells produced a 45% decrease in bFGF protein production. Reduction of bFGF protein was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescent staining. We report MuLV infection reduces bFGF transcript expression but not its surface-receptors (bek and flg) in infected stromal cells. Impaired hematopoiesis consistently exhibited from MuLV-infected stromal cultures was restored by exogenous bFGF; therefore, bFGF was responsible in restoration of normal marrow stromal support function. These results suggest a role for bFGF deficiency in the pathogenesis of MAIDS-related marrow failure.",

Though the neuroprotective effects of exogenous ActA on oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) injury have already been reported by us, the endogenous role of ActA remains poorly understood. To further define the role and mechanism of endogenous ActA and its signaling in response to acute ischemic damage, we used an OGD model in PC12 cells to simulate ischemic injury on neurons in vitro. Cells were pre-treated by monoclonal antibody against activin receptor type IIA (ActRII-Ab). We found that ActRII-Ab augments ischemic injury in PC12 cells. Further, the extracellular secretion of ActA as well as phosphorylation of smad3 in PC12 cells was also up-regulated by OGD, but suppressed by ActRII-Ab. Taken together, our results show that ActRII-Ab may augment ischemic injury via blocking of transmembrane signal transduction of ActA, which confirmed the existence of endogenous neuroprotective effects derived from the ActA/Smads pathway. ActRIIA plays an important role in transferring neuronal protective signals inside. It is highly possible that ActA transmembrance signaling is a part of the positive feed-back loop for extracellular ActA secretion. ",

Western blotting confirmed the presence of an 18,000-dalton protein which was localized in the lesions by immunohistochemical staining. All of the cells implicated in the progression of the disease (endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and myofibroblasts) contain the growth factor. Endothelial cells within the narrowed or occluded vessels, as well as fibroblasts surrounding these vessels, stained intensely positive. In situ hybridization using an antisense probe for human basic FGF and its receptor's (FGFR-1) mRNA established the major difference between normal and DC tissues: their levels are significantly higher than in the normal tissues. Thus the cells in DC also express both basic FGF and FGFR-1, suggesting a potential autocrine/paracrine role for basic FGF in the pathogenesis of DC. This finding is thus the first description of a nontumoral proliferative disease that can be directly associated with increased basic FGF mRNA.

Using an in vitro model of human BBB composed of brain microvascular endothelial cells and astrocytes, this study examined whether suppression of TNF-α, a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine, might attenuate ischaemia-mediated cerebral barrier damage. Radical decreases in transendothelial electrical resistance and concomitant increases in paracellular flux across co-cultures exposed to increasing periods of oxygen-glucose deprivation alone (0.5-20 h) or followed by 20 h of reperfusion (OGD ± R) confirmed the deleterious effects of ischaemic injury on cerebral barrier integrity and function which concurred with reductions in tight junction protein (claudin-5 and occludin) expressions. OGD ± R elevated TNF-α secretion, NADPH oxidase activity, O2(-) production, actin stress fibre formation, MMP-2/9 activities and apoptosis in both endothelial cells and astrocytes. Increases in MMP-2 activity were confined to its extracellular isoform and treatments with OGD+R in astrocytes where MMP-9 could not be detected at all. Co-exposure of individual cell lines or co-cultures to an anti-TNF-α antibody dramatically diminished the extent of OGD ± R-evoked oxidative stress, morphological changes, apoptosis, MMP-2/9 activities while improving the barrier function through upregulation of tight junction protein expressions.

The Tie probe hybridized very weakly with the vascular endothelium of capillaries of normal skin, while it was detected in larger arteries and veins as well as in capillaries around sweat glands. However, capillaries and medium-sized vessels within cutaneous and brain metastases of melanoma were strongly positive for Tie mRNA. In contrast, endothelial cells contained very little or no FGFR-1 transcripts, whereas abundant FGFR-1 mRNA was present in melanoma tumor cells and in fibrovascular stroma. In agreement with these findings, a Tie-specific amplified cDNA band was obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from melanoma metastases but not from normal skin.

An in vitro model of astrocyte swelling was created by 5h of oxygen-glucose deprivation and subsequent reperfusion (OGD/Rep). Astrocyte cultures were then treated with C-EPO or left as control cells. Here we show that increases in astrocyte volume, morphological cell swelling, and changes in ultrastructure after OGD/Rep were significantly mitigated by treatment with C-EPO (10 ng/ml). The decreases in AQP-4 phosphorylation after OGD/Rep were remarkably recovered by C-EPO treatment. The OGD/Rep-induced upregulations of AQP-4 mRNA and protein were also prevented by C-EPO treatment. Additional treatment with phorbol myristate acetate, an activator of protein kinase C (PKC), enhanced C-EPO-mediated neuroprotective effects, while that of H-7, an inhibitor of PKC, blocked these protections.

        "Doc_abstract":"Several studies have shown that high corticosteroid hormone levels increase neuronal vulnerability. Here we evaluate the consequences of in vivo acute or repeated restraint stress on cellular viability in rat hippocampal slices suffering an in vitro model of ischemia. Cellular injury was quantified by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and neuron-specific enolase released into the medium. Acute stress did not affect cellular death when oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) was applied both immediately or 24h after restraint. The exposure to OGD, followed by reoxygenation, resulted in increased LDH in the medium. Repeated stress potentiated the effect of OGD both, on LDH and neuron-specific enolase released to the medium. There was no effect of repeated stress on the release of S100B, an astrocytic protein. Additionally, no effect of repeated stress was observed on glutamate uptake by the tissue. These results suggest that repeated stress increases the vulnerability of hippocampal cells to an in vitro model of ischemia, potentiating cellular damage, and that the cells damaged by the exposure to repeated stress+OGD are mostly neurons. The uptake of glutamate was not observed to participate in the mechanisms responsible for rendering the neurons more susceptible to ischemic damage after repeated stress.",

We investigated whether hippocampal neurons may lack sufficient redox-buffering capacity to protect against ROS attacks. Using organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs) transiently exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and gerbils suffering from a two-vessel occlusion (2VO) as complementary ex vivo and in vivo models, we have elucidated whether the intrinsic redox systems interfere with ischemia-induced neurodegeneration. Cell- type-specific immunohistological staining of hippocampal slice cultures revealed that pyramidal neurons, in contrast to astrocytes and microglia, express free thiols only weakly. In addition, free thiol levels were extensively decreased throughout the hippocampal formation immediately after OGD, but recovered within 24 hr after reperfusion. In parallel, progressive glia activation and proliferation were observed. Increased neuronal exposure to ROS was monitored by dihydroethidium oxidation in hippocampal pyramidal cell layers immediately after OGD. Coadministration of reduction equivalents (α-lipoic acid) and thiol-stimulating agents (enalapril, ambroxol) decreased ischemia-induced neuronal damage in OGD-treated OHSCs and in gerbils exposed to 2VO, whereas single drug applications remained ineffective. In summary, limited redox buffering capacities of pyramidal neurons may underlie their exceptional vulnerability to cerebral ischemia. Consistently, multidrug treatments supporting endogenous redox systems may offer a strategy to promote valid neuroprotection.",

This study aims to investigate whether this reversed operation of glutamate transporters has any functional meanings for astrocytes themselves. Oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD) of neuron/astrocyte co-cultures resulted in the massive death of neurons, and the cell death was significantly reduced by treatment with either AP5 or DHK. In cultured astrocytes with little GLT-1 expression, OGD produced Na(+) overload, resulting in the reversal of astrocytic Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchanger (NCX). The reversed NCX then caused Ca(2+) overload leading to the damage of astrocytes. In contrast, the OGD-induced Na(+) overload and astrocytic damage were significantly attenuated in PACAP-treated astrocytes with increased GLT-1 expression, and the attenuation was antagonized by treatment with DHK.

The expression of the inducible isoform (iNOS) of NO synthase (NOS) has been demonstrated not only in blood and glial cells using in vivo models of brain ischemia-reperfusion but also in neurons in rat forebrain slices exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). We have used this experimental model to study the effect of OGD on the neuronal isoform of NOS (nNOS) and iNOS. In OGD-exposed rat forebrain slices, a decrease in the calcium-dependent NOS activity was found 180 min after the OGD period, which was parallel to the increase during this period in calcium-independent NOS activity. Both dexamethasone and cycloheximide, which completely inhibited the induction of the calcium-independent NOS activity, caused a 40-70% recovery in calcium-dependent NOS activity when compared with slices collected immediately after OGD. The NO scavenger oxyhemoglobin produced complete recovery of calcium-dependent NOS activity, suggesting that NO formed after OGD is responsible for this down-regulation. Consistently, exposure to the NO donor (Z)-1-[(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino]diazen-1-iu m-1,2-diolate (DETA-NONOate) for 180 min caused a decrease in the calcium-dependent NOS activity present in control rat forebrain slices. Furthermore, OGD and DETA-NONOate caused a decrease in level of both nNOS mRNA and protein. In summary, our results indicate that iNOS expression down-regulates nNOS activity in rat brain slices exposed to OGD. These studies suggest important and complex interactions between NOS isoforms, the elucidation of which may provide further insights into the physiological and pathophysiological events that occur during and after cerebral ischemia.",

However, the property of astrocyte responses to in vitro ischemic injury is not clear; whether 5-LOX, CysLTs, and their receptors are also involved in the responses of ischemic astrocytes remains unknown. In the present study, we performed oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by recovery to induce ischemic-like injury in the cultured rat astrocytes. We found that 1-h OGD did not injure astrocytes (sub-lethal OGD) but induced astrocyte proliferation 48 and 72 h after recovery; whereas 4-h OGD moderately injured the cells (moderate OGD) and led to death 24-72 h after recovery. Inhibition of phospholipase A(2) and 5-LOX attenuated both the proliferation and death. Sub-lethal and moderate OGD enhanced the production of CysLTs that was inhibited by 5-LOX inhibitors. Sub-lethal OGD increased the expressions of CysLT(1) receptor mRNA and protein, while moderate OGD induced the expression of CysLT(2) receptor mRNA. Exogenously applied leukotriene D(4) (LTD(4)) induced astrocyte proliferation at 1-10 nM and astrocyte death at 100-1,000 nM. The CysLT(1) receptor antagonist montelukast attenuated astrocyte proliferation, the CysLT(2) receptor antagonist BAY cysLT2 reversed astrocyte death, and the dual CysLT receptor antagonist BAY u9773 exhibited both effects. In addition, LTD(4) (100 nM) increased the expression of CysLT(2) receptor mRNA.

Based on our pilot experiments, plant natural product formononetin enhanced the survival of rat cardiomyocyte H9c2 cells during oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) and reoxygenation. For mechanistic studies, we focused on two major cellular factors, namely, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), in the regulation of mPTP opening. We found that formononetin suppressed the formation of ROS and superoxide in a concentration-dependent manner. Formononetin also rescued OGD/reoxygenation-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity. Further studies suggested that formononetin induced Akt activation and GSK-3β (Ser9) phosphorylation, thereby reducing GSK-3β activity towards mPTP opening. PI3K and PKC inhibitors abolished the effects of formononetin on mPTP opening and GSK-3β phosphorylation. Immunoprecipitation experiments further revealed that formononetin increased the binding of phosphor-GSK-3β to adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) while it disrupted the complex of ANT with cyclophilin D. Moreover, immunofluorescence revealed that phospho-GSK-3β (Ser9) was mainly deposited in the space between mitochondria and cell nucleus. Collectively, these results indicated that formononetin protected cardiomyocytes from OGD/reoxygenation injury via inhibiting ROS formation and promoting GSK-3β phosphorylation. ",

A membrane-based estrogen receptor, ER-α36, has been identified. Postmenopausal-levels of E2 act through ER-α36 to induce osteoclast apoptosis due to a prolonged activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) signaling. We hypothesized that ER-α36 may play a role in the neuroprotective activities of estrogen and tamoxifen. Here, we studied ER-α36 expression in the brain, as well as its neuroprotective effects against oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) in PC12 cells. We found that ER-α36 was expressed in both rat and human brain. In addition, OGD-induced cell death was prevented by l nmol/L 17β-estradiol (E2β). E2β activates the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway in PC12 cells under basal and OGD conditions by interacting with ER-α36 and also induces ER-α36 expression. Low-dose of tamoxifen up-regulated ER-α36 expression and enhanced neuronal survival in an ovariectomized ischemic stroke model. Furthermore, low-dose of tamoxifen enhanced neuroprotective effects by modulating activates or suppress ER-α36.

Previously, we have reported induction of neuronal pentraxin 1 (NP1), a novel neuronal protein of long-pentraxin family, following HI neuronal injury. Here, we investigated how this specific signal is propagated to cause the HI neuronal death. We used wild-type (WT) and NP1 knockout (NP1-KO) mouse hippocampal cultures, modeled in vitro following exposure to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD), and in vivo neonatal (P9-10) mouse model of HI brain injury. Our results show induction of NP1 in primary hippocampal neurons following OGD exposure (4-8 h) and in the ipsilateral hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions at 24-48 h post-HI compared to the contralateral side. We also found increased PTEN activity concurrent with OGD time-dependent (4-8 h) dephosphorylation of Akt (Ser473) and GSK-3β (Ser9). OGD also caused a time-dependent decrease in the phosphorylation of Bad (Ser136), and Bax protein levels. Immunofluorescence staining and subcellular fractionation analyses revealed increased mitochondrial translocation of Bad and Bax proteins from cytoplasm following OGD (4 h) and simultaneously increased release of Cyt C from mitochondria followed by activation of caspase-3. NP1 protein was immunoprecipitated with Bad and Bax proteins; OGD caused increased interactions of NP1 with Bad and Bax, thereby, facilitating their mitochondrial translocation and dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ(m)). This NP1 induction preceded the increased mitochondrial release of cytochrome C (Cyt C) into the cytosol, activation of caspase-3 and OGD time-dependent cell death in WT primary hippocampal neurons. In contrast, in NP1-KO neurons there was no translocation of Bad and Bax from cytosol to the mitochondria, and no evidence of ΔΨ(m) loss, increased Cyt C release and caspase-3 activation following OGD; which resulted in significantly reduced neuronal death. Our results indicate a regulatory role of NP1 in Bad/Bax-dependent mitochondrial release of Cyt C and caspase-3 activation. Together our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism by which NP1 regulates mitochondria-driven hippocampal cell death; suggesting NP1 as a potential therapeutic target against HI brain injury in neonates.",

Culturing primary hippocampal cells were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation and re-oxygenation (OGD/R) model, as a model of cerebral I/R in vitro. Methods CCK-8 assay was used to test the effect of propofol on cell viability. We examined the effect of propofol on mitochondrial ultrastructure and mitochondrial fission evoked by OGD/R with transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescence assay.

We demonstrated that in cortical neuronal cultures exposed to a 180 min OGD, AMN082 (0.01-1 µM) in a concentration- and time-dependent way attenuated the OGD-induced changes in the LDH release and MTT reduction assays. AMN082 (0.5 and 1 µM) produced also neuroprotective effects against KA-evoked neurotoxicity both in cortical and hippocampal cultures. Of particular importance was the finding that AMN082 attenuated excitotoxic neuronal injury after delayed application (30 min after OGD, or 30 min-1 h after KA). In both models of neurotoxicity, namely OGD- and KA-induced injury, the neuroprotective effects of AMN082 (1 µM) were reversed by the selective mGlu7 antagonist, 6-(4-Methoxyphenyl)-5-methyl-3-(4-pyridinyl)-isoxazolo[4,5-c]pyridin-4(5H)-one hydrochloride (MMPIP, 1 µM), suggesting the mGlu7-dependent mechanism of neuroprotective effects of AMN082. Next, we showed that AMN082 (0.5 and 1 µM) attenuated the OGD-induced increase in the number of necrotic nuclei as well inhibited the OGD-evoked calpain activation, suggesting the participation of these processes in the mechanism of AMN082-mediated protection. Additionally, we showed that protection evoked by AMN082 (1 µM) in KA model was connected with the inhibition of toxin-induced caspase-3 activity, and this effect was abolished by the mGlu7 receptor antagonist.

Moreover, MET expression in the tumors was significantly correlated with high PD-L2 expression and increased PD-1(+) TILs (P=0.001 for both). Increased numbers of CD8(+) or PD-1(+) TILs were significantly associated with prolonged disease-free survival of these patients, whereas PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression had no significant prognostic implications.;PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression in pulmonary SqCC is associated with an increased number of CD8(+) TILs and increased MET expression, which might provide therapeutic insight into targeting the PD-1/PD-Ls pathway in pulmonary SqCC.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The activation of microglia after spinal cord injury (SCI) contributes to secondary damage by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators, leading to cell death of oligodendrocytes and neurons. Here, we show that matrix metalloprotease-3 (MMP-3) produced and secreted in the endothelial cells of blood vessels after SCI mediates microglial activation. MMP-3 was produced and secreted in bEnd.3 cells, a mouse brain-derived endothelial cell line, by oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/RO). OGD/RO-induced MMP-3 expression and activity was also significantly inhibited by ghrelin, which was dependent on the ghrelin receptor GHS-R1a. Furthermore, the secreted MMP-3 from OGD/RO-induced bEnd.3 cells activated BV-2 cells, a murine microglial cell line. We also found that microglial activation after SCI was attenuated in MMP-3 knockout (KO) mice compared with wild type (WT) mice. Both p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation and pro-nerve growth factor (proNGF) production were more inhibited in MMP-3 KO than WT mice at 5d after injury. When WT mice were treated with Mmp-3 siRNA after injury, MMP-3 activity, microglial activation, p38MAPK activation and proNGF expression were significantly inhibited. Ghrelin treatment also significantly inhibited MMP-3 expression and activation after SCI, which was dependent on GHS-R1a. Finally, RhoA activation and oligodendrocyte cell death after injury were attenuated by Mmp-3 siRNA or ghrelin treatment compared with vehicle control. Thus, our study indicates that MMP-3 produced in blood vessel endothelial cells after SCI serves as an endogenous molecule for microglial activation followed by p38MAPK activation and proNGF production, and further indicates that the protective effect of ghrelin on oligodendrocytes cell death may be at least partly mediated by the inhibition of MMP-3-induced microglial activation after SCI.

This cDNA, designated cl44, encodes a product of 803 amino acid residues and was readily distinguishable from known FGF receptors. During the course of our studies, Partanen et al. (Partanen, J., Makela, T. P., Eerola, E., Korhonen, J., Hirvonen, H., Claesson, W. L., and Alitalo, K.

Its amino acid sequence is identical to that of cl44 with the exception of 1 residue. The 5'-untranslated sequences of the two cDNAs diverged far upstream of the initiation codon. A myoblast line, L6E9, which lacks FGF receptors, was utilized to express high levels of FGFR4. We found, in contrast to Partenen et al., who reported only binding of acidic FGF, that FGFR4 bound both acidic and basic FGF with dissociation constants of 10-15 and 120 pM, respectively. No detectable binding of keratinocyte growth factor was observed. In studies aimed to determine whether FGF receptors contribute to the development of human tumors, we screened RNAs prepared from cell lines derived from a variety of solid tumors. High levels of the cl44 transcript were detected in 8 of 14 and 6 of 9 human mammary and kidney carcinomas, respectively, but only infrequently in other types of tumors. In contrast, FGFR1 was found to be frequently expressed in kidney, but not in breast tumor cells, suggesting a possible role for FGFR4 in human mammary cancer.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Microglia of the central nervous system have a dual role in the ability to influence the survival of neighboring cells. During inflammatory cell activation, microglia can lead to the disposal of toxic cellular products and permit tissue regeneration, but microglia also may lead to cellular destruction with phagocytic removal. For these reasons, it is essential to elucidate not only the underlying pathways that control microglial activation and proliferation, but also the factors that determine microglial survival. In this regard, we investigated in the EOC 2 microglial cell line with an oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) injury model of oxidative stress the role of the \"O\" class forkhead transcription factor FoxO3a that in some scenarios is closely linked to immune system function. We demonstrate that FoxO3a is a necessary element in the control of early and late apoptotic injury programs that involve membrane phosphatidylserine externalization and nuclear DNA degradation, since transient knockdown of FoxO3a in microglia preserves cellular survival 24 hours following OGD exposure. However, prior to the onset of apoptotic injury, FoxO3a facilitates the activation and proliferation of microglia as early as 3 hours following OGD exposure that occurs in conjunction with the trafficking of the unphosphorylated and active post-translational form of FoxO3a from the cytoplasm to the cell nucleus. FoxO3a also can modulate apoptotic mitochondrial signal transduction pathways in microglia, since transient knockdown of FoxO3a prevents mitochondrial membrane depolarization as well as the release of cytochrome c during OGD. Control of this apoptotic cascade also extends to progressive caspase activation as early as 1 hour following OGD exposure. The presence of FoxO3a is necessary for the expression of cleaved (active) caspase 3, 8, and 9, since loss of FoxO3a abrogates the induction of caspase activity. Interestingly, elimination of FoxO3a reduced caspase 9 activity to a lesser extent than that noted with caspase 3 and 8 activities, suggesting that FoxO3a in relation to caspase 9 may be more reliant upon other signal transduction pathways potentially independent from caspase 3 and 8.",

Hypothermia is supposed to mitigate the effects of deleterious genes and proteins and promote the activity of protective genes and proteins in the ischemic brain. Metallothionein (MT)-1/2 is thought to be a crucial factor for metal homeostasis, immune function, and apoptosis. This protein was found to exert protective effects in models of brain injury as well. In the present study, we investigated the effect of hypothermia on MT expression and the underlying mechanisms.;Cultured bEnd.3 brain endothelial cells were exposed to oxygen glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD+R). Reverse transcription PCR and western blot analyses were performed to measure the expression of MT, transcription factors, and methylation regulating factors. Transcription factor binding assays were also performed. Methylation profiles of the promoter area were obtained with pyrosequencing.;Hypothermia protected bEnd.3 cells from OGD+R. When the cells were exposed to OGD+R, MT expression was induced. Hypothermia augmented MT levels. While OGD+R-induced MT expression was mainly associated with metal regulatory transcription factor 1 (MTF-1), MT expression promoted by hypothermia was primarily mediated by the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Significantly increased STAT3 phosphorylation at Ser727 was observed with hypothermia, and JSI-124, a STAT-3 inhibitor, suppressed MT expression. The DNA demethylating drug 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) enhanced MT expression. Some of the CpG sites in the promoter MT=> it should be \"the CpG sites in the MT promoter\" showed different methylation profiles and some methylation regulating factors had different expressional profiles in the presence of OGD+R and hypothermia.;We demonstrated that hypothermia is a potent inducer of MT gene transcription in brain endothelial cells, and enhanced MT expression might contribute to protection against ischemia.

Optimal growth of the cells was achieved in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with insulin, transferrin, 2-mercaptoethanol, 2-ethanolamine, sodium selenite, and oleic acid in type-I collagen-coated dishes. Both FGF-1 and FGF-2 stimulated cell growth and inhibited differentiation as measured by inhibition of alkaline phosphatase activity of the cells. An immunohistochemical analysis of FGF-1 and FGF-2 revealed that immunoreactive FGF-1 and FGF-2 were detected predominantly in the cytoplasm of growing cells. In addition, perinuclear FGF-1 staining and nuclear FGF-2 staining were observed in the same growing cells. In contrast, a faint diffuse staining of FGF-1 and FGF-2 was detected in cytoplasm of the confluent differentiated cells. The 2.15 M NaCl eluate from HAC of the cell extracts exhibited growth-promoting activities for the PLC, and it also stimulated the growth of human umbilical vein-derived endothelial cells and inhibited binding of [125I]-FGF to its receptors, indicating the cells produced FGFs or FGF-like growth factors.

The evidence also implicates Golgi as a sensor and common downstream-effector of stress signals in cell death pathways, and it undergoes disassembly and fragmentation during apoptosis in several neurological disorders. It has also been reported that during apoptotic cell death, there is a cross talk between ER, mitochondria, and Golgi. Thus, we hypothesized that Golgi might trigger death signals during oxidative stress through its own machinery. The current study found that GOLPH3, an outer membrane protein of the Golgi complex, was significantly upregulated in N2A cells upon oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R), positioning from the compact perinuclear ribbon to dispersed vesicle-like structures throughout the cytoplasm. Additionally, elevated GOLPH3 promoted a stress-induced conversion of the LC3 subunit I to II and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in long-term OGD/R groups. The collective data indicated that GOLPH3 not only acted as a sensor of Golgi stress for its prompt upregulation during oxidative stress but also as an initiator that triggered and propagated specific Golgi stress signals to downstream effectors. This affected ROS production and stress-related autophagy and finally controlled the entry into apoptosis. The data also supported the hypothesis that the Golgi apparatus could be an ideal target for stroke, neurodegenerative diseases, or cancer therapy through its own functional proteins. ",

In addition to functioning as neurotransmitter receptors to modulate synaptic activity, pathological mGluR5 signaling has been implicated in a number of disease processes including Fragile X, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, epilepsy, and drug addiction. The expression of mGluR5 in astrocytes has been shown to be increased in several acute and chronic neurodegenerative conditions, but little is known about the functional relevance of mGluR5 up-regulation in astrocytes following injury.;In the current study, we investigated primary mouse cortical astrocyte cell death in response to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) and found that OGD induced both necrotic and apoptotic cell death of astrocytes. OGD resulted in an increase in astrocytic mGluR5 protein expression, inositol phosphate formation and extracellular regulated kinase (ERK1/2) phosphorylation, but only inositol phosphate formation was blocked with the mGluR5 selective antagonist MPEP. Cortical astrocytes derived from mGluR5 knockout mice exhibited resistance to OGD-stimulated apoptosis, but a lack of mGluR5 expression did not confer protection against necrotic cell death. The antagonism of the inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate receptor also reduced apoptotic cell death in wild-type astrocytes, but did not provide any additional protection to astrocytes derived from mGluR5 null mice. Moreover, the disruption of Homer protein interactions with mGluR5 also reduced astrocyte apoptosis.;Taken together these observations indicated that mGluR5 up-regulation contributed selectively to the apoptosis of astrocytes via the activation of phospholipase C and the release of calcium from intracellular stores as well as via the association with Homer proteins.",

Activating mutations and/or overexpression of FGFR3 are common in urothelial tumours with low malignant potential and low-stage and -grade urothelial carcinomas (UCs) and are associated with a lower risk of progression and better survival in some subgroups. FGFR1 is not mutated in UC, but overexpression is frequent in all grades and stages and recent data indicate a role in urothelial epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that FGFR inhibition has cytotoxic and/or cytostatic effects in FGFR-dependent bladder cancer cells and FGFR-targeted agents are currently being investigated in clinical studies for the treatment of UC. Urine-based tests detecting common FGFR3 mutations are also under development for surveillance of low-grade and -stage tumours and for general population screening.

The activated FGFR-1 couples to Ras through two adaptor proteins, FRS2 and Shc. In FGF-2 treated proliferating EC, FRS2 as well as Shc are tyrosine phosphorylated and interact with Grb2. In contrast, in FGF-2 treated differentiating cells, Shc, but not FRS2, is engaged in Grb2-interactions. Sustained MAP kinase activity has previously been implicated in differentiation. In FGF stimulated proliferating and differentiating endothelial cells, the MAP kinase Erk2 is activated in a sustained manner. Inhibition of MEK and MAP kinase activity by PD98059 treatment of cells, still allows EC tube formation. The FGFR-1 mediates activation of protein kinase C (PKC) through direct binding and activation of phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-gamma), and has also been shown to activate the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Src. Treatment of the cells with the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide does not prevent tube formation. In contrast, Src kinase activity is a prerequisite for EC differentiation, since treatment of the cells with PP1, a Src family specific inhibitor, abrogates tube formation. In differentiating EC, FGF-2 induces complex formation between Src and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). These data indicate that the Ras pathway is initiated via Shc or FRS2, dependent on the cellular program. Blocking the function of Src family kinases, attenuates differentiation.",

We have previously shown that in cells irreversibly committed to DNA synthesis by FGF-1, approximately 15% of cell surface FGFR-1 traffics to a perinuclear locale as a structurally intact and functional tyrosine kinase (Prudovsky, I., Savion, N., Zhan, X., Friesel, R., Xu, J., Hou, J., McKeehan, W. L., and Maciag, T. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 31720-31724). In order to define the structural requirement for association of FGFR-1 with the nucleus, the expression and trafficking of FGFR-1 in FGFR-1alpha and FGFR-1beta L6 myoblast transfectants was studied. Although FGFR-1alpha was expressed as p145 and p125 forms, FGFR-1beta was expressed as p120 and p100 forms in the L6 myoblast transfectants. Tunicamycin and N-glyconase experiments suggest that these forms of FGFR-1alpha and FGFR-1beta are the result of differential glycosylation. However, only the p145 form of FGFR-1alpha and the p120 form of FGFR-1beta were able to bind FGF-1 and activate tyrosine phosphorylation. Pulse-chase analysis of FGFR-1 biosynthesis suggests that the p125 and p100 proteins are the precursor forms of p145 FGFR-1alpha and p120 FGFR-1beta, respectively. Because ligand-chase analysis demonstrated that FGFR-1beta L6 myoblast transfectants exhibited a reduced efficiency of nuclear translocation of exogenous FGF-1 when compared with FGFR-1alpha transfectants, the intracellular trafficking of the FGFR-1alpha and FGFR-1beta isoforms was studied using an in vitro kinase assay to amplify immunoprecipitated FGFR-1. Indeed, the appearance of the FGFR-1alpha but not FGFR-1beta isoform in the nuclear fraction of L6 myoblast transfectants suggests that the distal Ig-like loop in FGFR-1alpha mediates the differential nuclear association of FGFR-1alpha as a structurally intact and functional tyrosine kinase. Further, the FGFR-1beta L6 myoblast transfectants but not the FGFR-1alpha myoblast transfectants exhibited a pronounced morphologic change in response to exogenous FGF-1. Because this phenotype change involves the induction of a rounded cellular shape, it is possible that the FGFR-1alpha and FGFR-1beta may ultimately exhibit differential trafficking to adhesion sites.",

Sub-apoptotic doses of alpha-TOS caused down-regulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1) selectively in MM cells, while the effect on FGFR2 was only marginal. FGF1 and FGF2 enhanced MM cell proliferation that was suppressed by alpha-TOS. Over-expression of E2F1, a transcriptional factor of FGFR1, but not its dominant-negative counterpart, partially blocked the inhibitory activity of alpha-TOS on MM cell proliferation.

These receptors are therefore potential therapeutic targets in the development of inhibitors to this pathway. To identify the most relevant targets, we simultaneously investigated FGFR1-4 expression using a prostate cancer tissue microarray (TMA) and in laser capture microdissected (LCM) prostate epithelial cells. In malignant prostates (n = 138) we observed significant FGFR1 and FGFR4 protein over-expression in comparison with benign prostates (n = 58; p < 0.0001). FGFR1 was expressed at high levels in the majority of tumours (69% of grade 3 or less, 74% of grade 4 and 70% of grade 5), while FGFR4 was strongly expressed in 83% of grade 5 cancers but in only 25% of grade 1-3 cancers (p < 0.0001). At the transcript level we observed a similar pattern, with FGFR1 and FGFR4 mRNA over-expressed in malignant epithelial cells compared to benign cells (p < 0.0005 and p < 0.05, respectively). While total FGFR2 was increased in some cancers, there was no association between expression and tumour grade or stage. Transcript analysis, however, revealed a switch in the predominant isoform expressed from FGFR2IIIb to FGFR2IIIc among malignant epithelial cells. In contrast, protein and transcript expression of FGFR3 was very similar between benign and cancer biopsies. The functional effect of targeting FGFR4 in prostate cancer cells has not previously been investigated. In in vitro experiments, suppression of FGFR4 by RNA interference effectively blocked prostate cancer cell proliferation (p < 0.0001) and invasion (p < 0.001) in response to exogenous stimulation. This effect was evident regardless of whether the cells expressed the FGFR4 Arg388 or Gly388 allele. In parallel experiments, FGFR3 suppression had no discernible effect on cancer cell behaviour. These results suggest evidence of selective over-expression of FGFR1 and FGFR4 in clinical prostate cancer and support the notion of targeted inhibition of these receptors to disrupt FGF signalling.",

This included 16 patients with suspected small bowel Crohn disease (CD) (10 newly diagnosed; 6 known cases), 6 with obscure or occult gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), 3 with Peutz-Jegher polyposis (PJP), 2 with protein-losing enteropathy and 1 with recurrent abdominal pain. All of the patients had preceding upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (OGD) and ileocolonoscopy, and 24 had a barium meal and follow-through (BMFT). Images were downloaded and analysed and results compared with the endoscopic and radiological findings.;Three patients were unable to swallow the capsule (1 CD, 1 PJP and 1 GIB). Two of these patients (1 GIB, 1 PJP) had the capsule placed in the stomach endoscopically and completed the WCE uneventfully thereafter. In 3 patients (CD group) the capsule remained in the stomach and/or proximal duodenum and no small bowel images were obtained. Hence, 24 patients had successful completion of the WCE through the small bowel, 23 of whom had clinically relevant findings identified. In all patients with CD who had successful WCE studies (12/16), small bowel disease was identified (11/12 active disease, 1/12 chronic disease). A possible small bowel bleeding source was identified in all 6 patients with GIB. Two patients with GIB also underwent push enteroscopy and 1 of these had a bleeding source identified. The 2 patients with protein-losing enteropathy had extensive patchy lymphangiectasia of the jejunum and ileum, not detected at OGD. The patient with abdominal pain had an intussusception of the upper jejunum. The 2 PJP patients had small bowel polyps identified, which were not detected at BMFT. WCE was more sensitive for small bowel pathology than both BMFT (19 vs 5; 26% sensitivity compared with WCE) and endoscopic investigations (23 vs 10; 43.4% sensitivity compared with WCE). Two patients with CD had delayed capsule transit.;WCE led to a positive alteration in management in 18/24 (75%) of patients whose small bowel was examined by WCE and in 18/28 (64.3%) who were admitted to the study. WCE was safe, well tolerated, and more sensitive than radiological and standard endoscopic modalities in the detection of small bowel CD distribution, GIB source, and presence of polyps in children.",

Human vascular SMCs and endothelial cells were cultured and FGF receptor-1 (FGFR-1) and EGF receptor (EGFR) expression were detected by immunohistochemical staining. Cells were grown in 24-well plates. Variable amounts of testing drugs (bFGF, HBEGF, SAP, bFGF-SAP, or HBEGF-SAP) were added to quadruplicate wells after 24 h. Cells without drugs were used as control. The total number of cells was counted at 72 h using a hemocytometer. The cultured human vascular SMCs and endothelial cells expressed both FGFR-1 and EGFR with predominant perinuclear localization. bFGF and HBEGF demonstrated equally potent mitogenic effects on SMC proliferation. SAP alone showed a limited cytotoxic effect on both SMCs and endothelial cells. bFGF had a more potent effect on endothelial cell proliferation than HBEGF. bFGF-SAP was equally cytotoxic for both SMCs and endothelial cells, while HBEGF-SAP had a more selectively cytotoxic effect on SMCs than on endothelial cells. These data suggest that the mitogenic effects of bFGF and HBEGF and the cytotoxic effects of bFGF-SAP and HBEGF-SAP may both be mediated by their corresponding growth factor receptors.

Using a neonatal mouse model of HI, mRNA, and protein expression of TRAIL, DR5 and the TRAIL decoy receptors osteoprotegerin (OPG), mDcTRAILR1, and mDcTRAILR2 were determined. In vitro, mRNA expression of these genes was measured in primary neurons and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) after inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α/IFN-γ) treatment and/or oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). The toxicity of these various paradigms was also measured. The expression of TRAIL, DR5, OPG, and mDcTRAILR2 was significantly increased after HI.

TRAIL protein was expressed primarily in microglia and astroglia, whereas DR5 co-localized with neurons and OPCs in vivo. OGD enhanced TNF-α/IFN-γ toxicity in both neuronal and OPC cultures. Recombinant TRAIL exerted toxicity alone or in combination with OGD and TNF-α/IFN-γ in primary neurons but not in OPC cultures. The marked increases in the expression of TRAIL and its receptors after cytokine exposure and OGD in primary neurons and OPCs were similar to those found in our animal model of neonatal HI. The toxicity of TRAIL in primary neurons suggests that TRAIL signaling participates in neonatal brain injury after inflammation and HI. ",

In the present study, we used a genetic model to investigate the physiological functions of SUR2-containing K(ATP) channels in mediating vasodilation to hypoxia, oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) or metabolic inhibition, and functional recovery following these insults. Data indicate that SUR2B is the only SUR isoform expressed in murine cerebral artery smooth muscle cells. Pressurized SUR2 wild-type (SUR2(wt)) and SUR2 null (SUR2(nl)) mouse cerebral arteries developed similar levels of myogenic tone and dilated similarly to hypoxia (<10 mmHg Po(2)). In contrast, vasodilation induced by pinacidil, a K(ATP) channel opener, was ∼71% smaller in SUR2(nl) arteries. Human cerebral arteries also expressed SUR2B, developed myogenic tone, and dilated in response to hypoxia and pinacidil. OGD, oligomycin B (a mitochondrial ATP synthase blocker), and CCCP (a mitochondrial uncoupler) all induced vasodilations that were ∼39-61% smaller in SUR2(nl) than in SUR2(wt) arteries. The restoration of oxygen and glucose following OGD or removal of oligomycin B and CCCP resulted in partial recovery of tone in both SUR2(wt) and SUR2(nl) cerebral arteries. However, SUR(nl) arteries regained ∼60-82% more tone than did SUR2(wt) arteries. These data indicate that SUR2-containing K(ATP) channels are functional molecular targets for OGD, but not hypoxic, vasodilation in cerebral arteries. In addition, OGD activation of SUR2-containing K(ATP) channels may contribute to postischemic loss of myogenic tone.",

For in vitro studies, we examined the levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-2 in the culture medium or primary culture of BMECs injured by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). Then, we elucidated the protective effects of IGF-1 on cortical neurons injured by OGD and the possible mechanism. In addition, we investigated the effect of BMEC-conditioned medium on IGF-1 receptor expression in neurons. The results showed that IGF-1 expression increased in serum and brain tissue, whereas IGFBP-2 expression decreased in brain tissue of MCAO-injured rats. In primary culture of BMECs, the expression levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-2 were significantly higher under OGD conditions in culture. IGF-1 administration improved neuron viability upon normoxia or OGD, and upregulated p-Akt expression. This effect was reversed by LY294002, a specific inhibitor of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt signaling pathway. Furthermore, conditioned medium from OGD-treated BMECs substantially suppressed neuron viability and the expression of IGF-1 receptor simultaneously. These data demonstrate that therapeutic strategies that prioritize the early recovery of the IGF-1 system in BMECs might be promising in ischemic injury.",

This is an important question for regenerative medicine to treat stroke since other types of cell death such as necrosis are also prominent in the stroke brain apart from apoptosis. We report here that treatment with 17-N-Allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG), an Hsp90 inhibitor, protected neural progenitor cells (NPCs) against oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) induced cell death in a dose dependent fashion. Cell death assays indicated that 17AAG not only ameliorated apoptosis, but also necrosis mediated by OGD. This NPC protection was confirmed by exposing cells to oxidative stress, a major stress signal prevalent in the stroke brain. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that 17AAG activated PI3K/Akt and MAPK cell protective pathways. More interestingly, these two pathways were activated in vivo by 17AAG and 17AAG treatment reduced infarct volume in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) stroke model. These data suggest that 17AAG protects cells against major cell death pathways and thus might be used as a pharmacological conditioning agent for regenerative medicine for stroke. ",

In this study using an oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) model in PC12 cells, we show that 2-day pretreatment with green tea polyphenols (GTPP) and their active ingredient, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), protects cells from subsequent OGD/R-induced cell death. A synergistic interaction was observed between GTPP constituents, with unfractionated GTPP more potently preconditioning cells than EGCG. GTPP-induced preconditioning required the 67-kDa laminin receptor (67LR), to which EGCG binds with high affinity. 67LR also mediated the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via activation of NADPH oxidase. An exogenous ROS-generating system bypassed 67LR to induce preconditioning, suggesting that sublethal levels of ROS are indeed an important mediator in GTPP-induced preconditioning. This role for ROS was further supported by the fact that antioxidants blocked GTPP-induced preconditioning. Additionally, ROS induced an activation and translocation of protein kinase C (PKC), particularly PKCε from the cytosol to the membrane/mitochondria, which was also blocked by antioxidants. The crucial role of PKC in GTPP-induced preconditioning was supported by use of its specific inhibitors. Preconditioning was increased by conditional overexpression of PKCε and decreased by its knock-out with siRNA. Collectively, these results suggest that GTPP stimulates 67LR and thereby induces NADPH oxidase-dependent generation of ROS, which in turn induces activation of PKC, particularly prosurvival isoenzyme PKCε, resulting in preconditioning against cell death induced by OGD/R.",

Similarly, a 30 min exposure to the group I mGlu receptor agonist DHPG (10 microM) significantly reduced OGD neurotoxicity 24 h later (pharmacological preconditioning). Ischemic tolerance did not develop when either the selective mGlu1 antagonists LY367385 and 3-MATIDA or the AMPA/KA antagonist CNQX were present in the incubation medium during exposure to sublethal OGD. Neither the NMDA antagonist MK801 nor the mGlu5 antagonist MPEP affected the preconditioning process. On the other hand, pharmacological preconditioning was prevented not only by LY367385 or CNQX, but also by MPEP. In preconditioned slices, the toxic responses to AMPA or NMDA were reduced. The neurotoxicty of 100 microM DHPG in slices simultaneously exposed to a mild (20 min) OGD was differentially altered in the two preconditioning paradigms. After ischemic preconditioning, DHPG neurotoxicity was reduced in a manner that was sensitive to LY367385 but not to MPEP, whereas after pharmacological preconditioning it was enhanced in a manner that was sensitive to MPEP but not to LY367385.

It is proposed that switching of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunits on CA1 neurons during an in vitro model of ischemia, oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD), leads to an enhanced permeability of AMPARs to Ca(2+), resulting in delayed cell death. However, it is unclear whether the same mechanisms exist in CA3 neurons and whether this underlies the differential sensitivity to ischemia. Here, we investigated the consequences of OGD for AMPAR function in CA3 neurons using electrophysiological recordings in rat hippocampal slices. Following a 15 min OGD protocol, a substantial depression of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission was observed at CA3 associational/commissural and mossy fiber synapses but not CA1 Schaffer collateral synapses. The depression of synaptic transmission following OGD was prevented by metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) or A(3) receptor antagonists, indicating a role for both glutamate and adenosine release. Inhibition of PLC, PKC, or chelation of intracellular Ca(2+) also prevented the depression of synaptic transmission. Inclusion of peptides to interrupt the interaction between GluA2 and PICK1 or dynamin and amphiphysin prevented the depression of transmission, suggesting a dynamin and PICK1-dependent internalization of AMPARs after OGD. We also show that a reduction in surface and total AMPAR protein levels after OGD was prevented by mGluR1 or A(3) receptor antagonists, indicating that AMPARs are degraded following internalization. Thus, we describe a novel mechanism for the removal of AMPARs in CA3 pyramidal neurons following OGD that has the potential to reduce excitotoxicity and promote neuroprotection.",

However, it is unknown whether RVT can attenuate ischemia-induced early impairment of neuronal excitability. To address this question, we simulated ischemic conditions by applying oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) to acute rat hippocampal slices and examined the effect of RVT on OGD-induced pyramidal neuron excitability impairment using whole-cell patch clamp recording. 100 microM RVT largely inhibited the 15 min OGD-induced progressive membrane potential (Vm) depolarization and the reduction in evoked action potential frequency and amplitude in pyramidal neurons. In a parallel neuronal viability study using TO-PRO-3 iodide staining, 20 min OGD induced irreversible CA1 pyramidal neuronal death which was significantly reduced by 100 microM RVT. No similar effects were found with PQQ treatment, an antioxidant also showing potent neuroprotection in the rat rMCAO ischemia model. This suggests that antioxidant action per se, is unlikely accounting for the observed early effects of RVT. RVT also markedly reduced the frequency and amplitude of AMPA mediated spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) in pyramidal neurons, which is also an early consequence of OGD. RVT effects on neuronal excitability were inhibited by the large-conductance potassium channel (BK channel) inhibitor paxilline. Together, these studies demonstrate that RVT attenuates OGD-induced neuronal impairment occurring early in the simulated ischemia slice model by enhancing the activation of BK channel and reducing the OGD-enhanced AMPA/NMDA receptor mediated neuronal EPSCs.",

Hippocampal slice cultures prepared from 9 day old rats were preconditioned with hypoxia (95% N(2), 5% CO(2) for 15 min, HPC), 1% isoflurane for 15 min (APC) or their combination (CPC) for 15 min. A day later cultures were deprived of O(2) and glucose (OGD) to produce neuronal injury. Cell death was assessed 48 h after OGD. mRNA encoding 119 signal transduction genes was quantified with cDNA micro arrays. Intracellular Ca(2+) in CA1 region was measured with fura-2 during preconditioning. The cell-permeable Ca(2+) buffer BAPTA-AM, the IP(3) receptor antagonist Xestospongin C and RNA silencing were used to investigate preconditioning mechanisms. CPC decreased CA1, CA3 and dentate region death by 64-86% following OGD, more than HPC or APC alone (P<0.01). Gene expression following CPC was an amalgam of gene expression in HPC and APC, with simultaneous increases in growth/development and survival/apoptosis regulation genes. Intracellular Ca(2+) chelation and RNA silencing of IP(3) receptors prevented preconditioning neuroprotection and gene responses. We conclude that combined isoflurane-hypoxia preconditioning augments neuroprotection compared to single agents in immature rat hippocampal slice cultures. The mechanism involves genes for growth, development, apoptosis regulation and cell survival as well as IP(3) receptors and intracellular Ca(2+).",

To elucidate the mechanisms involved, we focused on two characteristic events: nuclear translocation of N-terminal fragment of profilaggrin and caspase-14-dependent degradation of the inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase (ICAD). First, we demonstrated that epidermal mesotrypsin liberated a 55-kDa N-terminal fragment of profilaggrin (FLG-N) and FLG-N was translocated into the nucleus. Interestingly, these cells became TUNEL positive. Mutation in the mesotrypsin-susceptible Arg-rich region between FLG-N and the first filaggrin domain abolished these changes. Furthermore, caspase-14 caused limited proteolysis of ICAD, followed by accumulation of caspase-activated DNase (CAD) in TUNEL-positive nuclei. Knockdown of both proteases resulted in a significant increase of remnant nuclei in a skin equivalent model. Immunohistochemical study revealed that both caspase-14 and mesotrypsin were markedly downregulated in parakeratotic areas of lesional skin from patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Collectively, our results indicate that at least two pathways are involved in the DNA degradation process during keratinocyte terminal differentiation. ",

This study aimed to explore whether magnesium was transported via a TRPM7 channel into the intracellular space of rat hippocampal neurons after 1 h of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and acute chemical ischemia (CI) by using methods of the Mg(2+) fluorescent probe Mag-Fura-2 to detect intracellular magnesium concentration ([Mg(2+)](i)) and flame atomic absorption spectrometry to measure extracellular magnesium concentration ([Mg(2+)](o)). The results showed that the neuronal [Mg(2+)](i) was 1.51-fold higher after 1 h of OGD at a basal level, and the increase of neuronal [Mg(2+)](i) reached a peak after 1 h of OGD and was kept for 60 min with re-oxygenation. Meanwhile, the [Mg(2+)](o) decreased after 1 h of OGD and recovered to the pre-ischemic level within 15 min after re-oxygenation. In the case of CI, the [Mg(2+)](i) peak immediately appeared in hippocampal neurons. This increase of [Mg(2+)](i) declined by removing extracellular magnesium in OGD or CI. Furthermore, by using Gd(3+) or 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate to inhibit TRPM7 channels, the [Mg(2+)](i) increase, which was induced by OGD or CI, was attenuated without altering the basal level of [Mg(2+)](i). By silencing TRPM7 with shRNA in hippocampal neurons, it was found that not only was the increase of [Mg(2+)](i) induced by OGD or CI but also the basal levels of [Mg(2+)](i) were attenuated. In contrast, overexpression of TRPM7 in HEK293 cells exaggerated both the basal levels and increased [Mg(2+)](i) after 1 h of OGD/CI. These results suggest that anoxia induced the increase of [Mg(2+)](i) via TRPM7 channels in rat hippocampal neurons.",

Observations from clinical samples indicate that such resistance correlates with an increase in Src, EGFR, and PI3K/Akt activities and a decrease in PTEN activity. Furthermore, Akt survival signaling activation is also found in tumors treated by toxic chemotherapeutic agents. Because cotreatment with a PI3K inhibitor is a promising strategy to delay acquired resistance by preventing secondary gene activation, we therefore investigated the effects of a newly identified compound, (-)-Liriopein B (LB), on PI3K/Akt signaling activity in breast cancer cells. Our results showed that nontoxic doses of LB are able to inhibit AKT activation in both luminal-like MCF-7 and basal-like MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Low doses of LB also inhibited cell migration, invasion, and cancer-stem cell sphere formation. Suppression of EGF-induced EGFR and ERK1/2 activation by LB might contribute in part to retardation of cancer progression. Furthermore, LB increases sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 cells to gefitinib in vitro, suggesting that EGFR may not be the only target of LB. Finally, a small scale in vitro kinase assay screen demonstrated that LB has a potent inhibitory effect on multiple kinases, including PI3K, Src, EGFR, Tie2, lck, lyn, RTK5, FGFR1, Abl, and Flt. In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time that the compound LB improves tumor therapeutic efficacy and suggests LB as a promising candidate for studying new leads in the development of kinase inhibitors.

Our data demonstrated that induction of both PGHS-2 mRNA and protein reached peak levels ( approximately 10 fold) after 6 h OGD.

The present study further evaluated effects of DDPH on OGD (Oxygen and glucose deprivation)-induced neuronal damage in rat primary hippocampal cells. The addition of DDPH to the cultured cells 12 h before OGD for 4 h significantly reduced neuronal damage as determined by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay and LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) release experiments.

An anti-apoptotic effect of AG in neuronal cells has recently been reported. However, whether there is a neuroprotective effect of unacylated ghrelin (UAG), the most abundant form of ghrelin in plasma, is still unknown. Therefore, we investigated whether UAG was neuroprotective against ischemic neuronal injury using primary cultured rat cortical neurons exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). Both AG and UAG inhibited OGD-induced apoptosis. Exposure of cells to the receptor-specific antagonist D-Lys-3-GHRH-6 abolished the protective effects of AG against OGD, whereas those of UAG were preserved, suggesting the involvement of a receptor that is distinct from GHS-R1a. Chemical inhibition of MAPK and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) blocked the anti-apoptotic effects of AG and UAG. Ghrelin siRNA enhanced apoptosis either during OGD or even in normoxic conditions. The protective effects of AG and UAG were accompanied by an increased phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, Akt, and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta). Furthermore, treatment of cells with AG or UAG resulted in nuclear translocation of beta-catenin. In addition, both AG and UAG increased the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, prevented cytochrome c release, and inhibited caspase-3 activation. The data indicate that, independent of acylation, ghrelin can function as a neuroprotective agent that inhibits apoptotic pathways. These effects may be mediated via activation of the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways. Our data also suggest that PI3K/Akt-mediated inactivation of GSK-3beta and stabilization of beta-catenin contribute to the anti-apoptotic effects of ghrelin.",

A strong association has previously been made between malignancy in human astrocytic tumors and increased expression of certain fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family members, including basic and acidic FGF. The influence of endogenous basic FGF on glioblastoma cell growth in vitro was evaluated using basic FGF-specific antisense oligonucleotides. These studies indicated that human glioblastoma cell growth in vitro, can be inhibited by suppressing basic FGF expression. Human astrocytomas also exhibited changes in FGF receptor (FGFR) expression during the course of their progression from a benign to a malignant phenotype. FGFR2 (bek) expression was abundant in normal white matter and in all low grade astrocytomas, but was not observed in glioblastomas. Conversely, FGFR1 (flg) expression was absent or barely detectable in normal white matter, but was significantly elevated in glioblastomas. Glioblastomas also expressed an alternatively spliced form of FGFR1 containing two immunoglobulin-like disulfide loops (FGFR1 beta), whereas normal human adult and fetal brain expressed a form of the receptor containing three immunoglobulin-like disulfide loops (FGFR1 alpha). Intermediate grades of astrocytic tumors exhibited a gradual loss of FGFR2 and a shift in expression from FGFR1 alpha to FGFR1 beta as they progressed from a benign to a malignant phenotype. The underlying cytogenetic changes that contribute to these alterations are not entirely understood, but abnormalities in the p53 tumor suppressor gene may influence expression of bFGF as well as the FGFR. These results suggest that alterations in FGFR signal transduction pathways may play a critical role in the malignant progression of astrocytic tumors.",

In the present study, we fused XIAP (BIR3-RING) to the protein transduction domain (PTD) of antennapedia homeodomain of Drosophila (Antp HD), and then used the oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced hippocampal slices injury in vitro, and the rat transient middle cerebral artery ischemia (tMCAO) models in vivo, to explore the anti-apoptotic effect of this recombinant protein. The results showed that the PTD could efficiently mediate the transduction of BIR3-RING into the hippocampal slices and rat brains.

Intraperitoneal injection of PTD-BIR3-RING could attenuate terminal deoynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) positive cells and decrease cleaved caspase-3 in the ischemic bounder zone compared with the control animals (p < 0.05).

This study aimed to investigate the effects of ruscogenin on BBB dysfunction and the underlying mechanisms in middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R)-injured mice and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-injured mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells (bEnd.3). The results demonstrated that administration of ruscogenin (10 mg/kg) decreased the brain infarction and edema, improved neurological deficits, increased cerebral brain flow (CBF), ameliorated histopathological damage, reduced evans blue (EB) leakage and upregulated the expression of tight junctions (TJs) in MCAO/R-injured mice. Meanwhile, ruscogenin (0.1-10 µM) treatment increased cell viability and trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) value, decreased sodium fluorescein leakage, and modulated the TJs expression in OGD/R-induced bEnd.3 cells. Moreover, ruscogenin also inhibited the expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and caspase-1, and markedly suppressed the expression of Nucleotide-binding domain (NOD)-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) and thiredoxin-interactive protein (TXNIP) in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, ruscogenin decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and inhibited the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in OGD/R-induced bEnd.3 cells. Our findings provide some new insights into its potential application for the prevention and treatment of ischemic stroke. ",

Estrogen reduces oxidative stress and protects brain endothelial cells from ischemic insult. The aim of this study was to determine the protective effects of estrogen on TJ disruption and to examine the roles of classical estrogen receptor (ER) subtypes, ERα- and ERβ, in estrogen effects in brain endothelial cells (bEnd.3) exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) injury. Estrogen pretreatment prevented OGD/R-induced decreases in cell viability and TJ protein levels. ERα- and ERβ-specific agonists also reduced TJ disruption. Knockdown of ERα or ERβ expression partially inhibited the effects of estrogen, but completely reversed the effects of corresponding ER subtype-specific agonists on the outcomes of OGD/R. During the early reperfusion period, activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α/vascular endothelial growth factor was associated with decreased expression of occludin and claudin-5, respectively, and these changes in TJ protein levels were differentially regulated by ER subtype-specific agonists. Our results suggest that ERα and ERβ activation reduce TJ disruption via inhibition of signaling molecules after ischemic injury and that targeting each ER subtype can be a useful strategy for protecting the BBB from ischemic stroke in postmenopausal women.

The mechanism by which TG2 modulates disease progression have not been elucidated. In this study we investigate the role of TG2 in the cellular response to ischemia and hypoxia. TG2 is up-regulated in neurons exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), and increased TG2 expression protects neurons against OGD-induced cell death independent of its transamidating activity. We identified hypoxia inducible factor 1beta (HIF1beta) as a TG2 binding partner. HIF1beta and HIF1alpha together form the heterodimeric transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1). TG2 and the transaminase-inactive mutant C277S-TG2 inhibited a HIF-dependent transcription reporter assay under hypoxic conditions without affecting nuclear protein levels for HIF1alpha or HIF1beta, their ability to form the HIF1 heterodimeric transcription factor, or HIF1 binding to its DNA response element. Interestingly, TG2 attenuates the up-regulation of the HIF-dependent proapoptotic gene Bnip3 in response to OGD but had no effect on the expression of VEGF, which has been linked to prosurvival processes. This study demonstrates for the first time that TG2 protects against OGD, interacts with HIF1beta, and attenuates the HIF1 hypoxic response pathway. These results indicate that TG2 may play an important role in protecting against the delayed neuronal cell death in ischemia and stroke.",

The major side effect of intensive therapy in both type 1 and type 2 diabetics is recurrent hypoglycemic episodes (RH). Our previous study in a rat model of insulin-requiring diabetes indicated that RH exacerbates cerebral ischemic damage. Studies related to RH in hypoglycemia unawareness suggest that RH may be deleterious to outcome following cerebral ischemia owing to systemic effects, since hormonal response to hypoglycemia is impaired following RH. The goal of the present study was to determine if RH increases oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced damage in hippocampal organotypic slices, which are devoid of systemic influence. Hippocampal slices cultured in ex vivo conditions for 9-10 days were exposed to ten 30-min episodes of \"hypoglucose\" (to mimic the hypoglycemic condition) medium (1.06 mM) twice a day. Slices were exposed to OGD 12h after the last hypo/normo-glucose exposure. OGD in control slices resulted in 60% neuronal death. The percentage of cell death in RH-treated slices was significantly higher by 24% than in control slices. The results demonstrate that RH can affect brain cells in the absence of humoral influence. In conclusion, the previous exposure of hippocampal slices to RH exacerbates OGD-induced damage. Understanding the mechanism by which RH increases ischemic damage in diabetics will help improve outcome following stroke.",

We examined the distinct contributions of FGFR1 and S4 in shaping the endothelial response to FGF2. S4 determined the kinetics and magnitude of FGF2-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling by promoting the macropinocytosis of the FGFR1-S4-FGF2 signaling complex. Internalization of the S4 receptor complex was independent of clathrin and dynamin, proceeded from lipid raft-enriched membranes, and required activation of the guanosine triphosphatases RhoG and Rab5. Genetic knockout of S4, disruption of S4 function, or inhibition of Rab5 led to increased endocytosis and MAPK signaling. These data define the mechanism by which FGFR1 and S4 coordinate downstream signaling upon FGF2 stimulation: FGFR1 initiates MAPK signaling, whereas S4-dependent FGFR1 macropinocytosis modulates the kinetics of MAPK activation.

Overexpression of the TK14 protein by transfection of COS-1 cells with the corresponding cDNA in a simian virus 40-based expression vector leads to the appearance of new cell-surface binding sites for both acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors.

In concert with the neonatal \"transition\" from proliferative to hypertrophic growth, ventricular remodeling of the nonmyocyte compartment is characterized by increased extracellular matrix synthesis/deposition and capillary angiogenesis. A role for locally generated and bioactive ventricular acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) in these processes is proposed and substantiated by the following: 1) colocalization of aFGF peptide and fibroblast growth factor receptor (flg) transcripts to the developing fetal cardiomyocyte by immunohistochemistry, immunoelectron microscopy, and in situ hybridization, 2) continued localization of aFGF peptide and transcripts to the neonatal/mature cardiomyocyte, and 3) localization of flg immunoreactivity and transcripts to specific neonatal ventricular nonmuscle cell types. Specific ventricular cell types at distinct developmental stages appear to be responsive to ventricular myocyte-derived aFGF (myocytes in the fetal heart and nonmyocytes/endothelial cells in the neonatal heart). These data indicate that expression of aFGF and one of its receptors (flg) are most pronounced in the fetal to early neonatal ventricle, the presence of both suggesting an autocrine/paracrine growth regulatory function. As the animal matures, ventricular capillary angiogenesis may be facilitated by \"release\" of cardiomyocyte-derived fibroblast growth factors into the surrounding extracellular space/matrix functioning as a \"paracrine\" angiogenic stimuli. Therefore, the results of our study suggest that myocyte-derived aFGF may function to increase the fetal ventricular cardiomyocyte population in absolute number as well as to facilitate the subsequent increase in capillary angiogenesis that occurs during cardiomyocyte maturation and ventricular remodeling.",

Direct treatment of brain slices with IL-4 (without cell addition) was protective against OGD and induced an M2 phenotype in the slice. In vivo, intracerebral injection of LPS or IL-4 in mice induced microglial phenotypes similar to the phenotypes observed in brain slices and in cultured cells. After injury induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion, microglial cells did not adopt classical M1/M2 phenotypes, suggesting that another subtype of regulatory phenotype was induced. This study highlights functional differences between macrophages and microglia, in response to brain injury with fundamentally different outcomes, even if both populations were able to adopt M1 or M2 phenotypes. These data suggest that macrophages infiltrating the brain from the periphery after an injury may be cytotoxic, independently of their phenotype, while microglia may be protective.",

The perlecan c-terminal fragment LG3 is generated at increased levels by proteolytic processing as long as 3 days after ischemia. It has previously been shown that oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), reperfusion and interleukin-1 α (IL-1α) stimulate brain cells to yield increased levels of LG3. This LG3, in turn, is neuroprotective against OGD, and may therefore represent one of the brain's defenses against ischemic injury. Here, we investigate whether, in neurons, this increased LG3 is the result of increased perlecan generation and cellular release, increased protease release (to generate LG3 from previous extracellularly deposited perlecan) or both. We found that pre-synthesized perlecan may be exocytosed by neurons during OGD and de novo synthesis of perlecan is increased during reperfusion, even 24 h after OGD. Furthermore, while cathepsin L activity was seen to be marginally important to generate LG3 during normoxic conditions, cathepsin B activity was found to be important to generate increased levels of LG3 following OGD and reperfusion. On the other hand, IL-1α treatment raised levels of cathepsin L in neuronal media, and both cathepsin L and cathepsin B were demonstrated to be important for increasing LG3 levels after IL-1α treatment.",

Changes in CaMKII activity were detected in various ischemia models. It is tempting to know whether and how CaMKII takes a role in NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated postischemic long-term potentiation (NMDA i-LTP). Here, we monitored changes in NMDAR-mediated field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (NMDA fEPSPs) at different time points following ischemia onset in vitro oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) ischemia model. We found that 10 min OGD treatment induced significant i-LTP in NMDA fEPSPs, whereas shorter (3 min) or longer (25 min) OGD treatment failed to induce prominent NMDA i-LTP. CaMKII activity or CaMKII autophosphorylation displays a similar bifurcated trend at different time points following onset of ischemia both in vitro OGD or in vivo photothrombotic lesion (PT) models, suggesting a correlation of increased CaMKII activity or CaMKII autophosphorylation with NMDA i-LTP. Disturbing the association between CaMKII and GluN2B subunit of NMDARs with short cell-permeable peptides Tat-GluN2B reversed NMDA i-LTP induced by OGD treatment.

In this study, we investigated the molecular causes of this defect with regard to the putative correlations among NAD(P)H oxidase, plasminogen-plasmin system components, and matrix metalloproteinases. Hence, the activities of NAD(P)H oxidase, matrix metalloproteinase-2, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), and superoxide anion levels, were assessed in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) alone or OGD followed by reperfusion (OGD + R). The integrity of an in vitro model of BBB comprising HBMECs and astrocytes was studied by measuring transendothelial electrical resistance and the paracellular flux of albumin. OGD with or without reperfusion (OGD ± R) radically perturbed barrier function while concurrently enhancing uPA, tPA and NAD(P)H oxidase activities and superoxide anion release in HBMECs. Pharmacological inactivation of NAD(P)H oxidase attenuated OGD ± R-mediated BBB damage through modulation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and tPA, but not uPA activity. Overactivation of NAD(P)H oxidase in HBMECs via cDNA electroporation of its p22-phox subunit confirmed the involvement of tPA in oxidase-mediated BBB disruption. Interestingly, blockade of uPA or uPA receptor preserved normal BBB function by neutralizing both NAD(P)H oxidase and matrix metalloproteinase-2 activities. Hence, selective targeting of uPA after ischaemic strokes may protect cerebral barrier integrity and function by concomitantly attenuating basement membrane degradation and oxidative stress. ",

Paradoxically, endogenous neuroprotective mechanisms can be triggered by preconditioning with thrombin (thrombin preconditioning, TPC), leading to tolerance to cerebral ischemia. Here we studied the role of thrombin's endogenous potent inhibitor, protease nexin-1 (PN-1), in ischemia and in tolerance to cerebral ischemia induced by TPC. Cerebral ischemia was modelled in vitro in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures from rats or genetically engineered mice lacking PN-1 or with the reporter gene lacZ knocked into the PN-1 locus PN-1HAPN-1-lacZ/HAPN-1-lacZ (PN-1 KI) exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). We observed increased thrombin enzyme activity in culture homogenates 24 h after OGD. Lack of PN-1 increased neuronal death in the CA1, suggesting that endogenous PN-1 inhibits thrombin-induced neuronal damage after ischemia. OGD enhanced β-galactosidase activity, reflecting PN-1 expression, at one and 24 h, most strikingly in the stratum radiatum, a glial cell layer adjacent to the CA1 layer of ischemia sensitive neurons. TPC, 24 h before OGD, additionally increased PN-1 expression 1 h after OGD, compared to OGD alone. TPC failed to induce tolerance in cultures from PN-1(-/-) mice confirming PN-1 as an important TPC target. PN-1 upregulation after TPC was blocked by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor, L-JNKI1, known to block TPC.

Recently, we demonstrated that Gly14-HN (HNG), a variant of HN in which the 14th amino acid serine is replaced with glycine, can decrease apoptotic neuronal death and reduce infarct volume in a focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion mouse model. In this study, we postulate that the mechanism of HNG's neuroprotective effect is mediated by the PI3K/Akt pathway. Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) was performed in cultured mouse primary cortical neurons for 60 min. The effect of HNG and PI3K/Akt inhibitors on OGD-induced cell death was examined at 24 h after reperfusion. HNG increased cell viability after OGD in primary cortical neurons, whereas the PI3K/Akt inhibitors wortmannin and Akti-1/2 attenuated the protective effect of HNG. HNG rapidly increased Akt phosphorylation, an effect that was inhibited by wortmannin and Akti-1/2. Mouse brains were injected intraventricularly with HNG before being subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). HNG treatment significantly elevated p-Akt levels after cerebral I/R injury and decreased infarct volume. The protective effect of HNG on infarct size was attenuated by wortmannin and Akti-1/2. Taken as a whole, these results suggest that PI3K/Akt activation mediates HNG's protective effect against hypoxia/ischemia reperfusion injury.",

Ectopic expression of constitutively active FGFR1 mutant (caFGFR1) at low levels in prostate epithelial cells induces low- to intermediate-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) within 6-8 months and high-grade PIN in 20-25 months. Depression of the FGFR2 signaling in the prostate also disturbs homeostasis in the prostate and induces prostate hyperplasia. To study whether PIN lesions induced by the caFGFR1 were expression-level dependent, and whether expression of the caFGFR1 and depression of the FGFR2 signaling in the prostate synergistically disturbed prostate homeostasis, we generated two new strains of ARR2PBi-caFGFR1 transgenic mice, which highly expressed caFGFR1 in prostatic epithelial cells. The mice were crossed with KDNR mice to generate ARR2PBi-caFGFR1/KDNR bigenic mice. The ARR2PBi-caFGFR1 mice developed high-grade PIN within 8 months, which was significantly faster than the mice expressing caFGFR1 at low levels. In addition, depression of the FGFR2 signaling clearly promoted perturbation of cellular homeostasis induced by the caFGFR1. The results demonstrated that the PIN development in caFGFR1 transgenic mice was caFGFR1 dosage-dependent, and indicated that the ectopic FGFR1 and the resident FGFR2 in epithelial cells had opposite impacts on intercompartmental homeostasis in the prostate.

In situ hybridization probes were employed to evaluate the prevalence of amplification of HER2, TOP2A, EGFR, CCND1, MYC, ESR1, and FGFR1 genes. aCGH analysis demonstrated that MPCs significantly differed from IDC-NSTs at the genomic level. Gains of 1q, 2q, 4p, 6p, 6q23.2-q27, 7p, 7q, 8p, 8q, 9p, 10p, 11q, 12p, 12q, 16p, 17p, 17q, 19p, 20p, 20q, and 21q, and losses of 1p, 2p, 6q11.1-q16.3, 6q21-q22.1, 9p, 11p, 15q, and 19q were more prevalent in MPCs. High-level gains/amplifications of 8p12-p11, 8q12, 8q13, 8q21, 8q23, 8q24, 17q21, 17q23, and 20q13 were significantly associated with MPCs. A comparison between 24 MPCs and a series of 48 grade and ER-matched IDC-NSTs revealed that high cyclin D1 expression, high proliferation rates, and MYC (8q24) amplification were significantly associated with MPCs. Our results demonstrate that MPCs have distinct histological features and molecular genetic profiles supporting the contention that they constitute a distinct pathological entity.",

An upregulation of KRT5 and KRT17 in both lesional and non-lesional AD skin was observed (p<0.05) whereas KRT2e, KRT14, IVL and FLG expression were significantly increased only in lesional AD skin (p<0.05). Additionally, the expression levels of KRT5, KRT14, KRT17 and IVL in CAD were strongly correlated.

However, the effect of HB-EGF on neuronal cells is largely unexplored. In this study, we examined the effect of HB-EGF on neurite outgrowth in pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells as well as the neuroprotective effect of HB-EGF on injured PC12 cells exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), which mimics ischemic conditions. We found that HB-EGF significantly promotes PC12 cell neurite outgrowth and that this effect was blocked by EGF receptor (EGFR) inhibition or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibition, but not by tyrosine kinase inhibition. In the face of OGD injury, HB-EGF preserves cell viability and decreases apoptosis and LDH release in PC12 cells. HB-EGF-mediated cytoprotection was abolished by EGFR inhibition and MAPK inhibition. We conclude that HB-EGF, through its interaction with the EGF receptor, activates the MAPK signaling pathway in PC12 cells under basal or injury conditions, leading to enhanced neurite outgrowth and neuroprotection against ischemic injury.",

The extent to which this differentiation depends on paracrine signaling from other brain cells is not clear. This study explored if oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) can trigger expression of phenotype-specific markers in rat microglia/macrophages in primary culture, in absence/low abundance of other brain cells. Time pattern of these changes was assessed and compared to time-pattern that has been revealed in vivo previously. Effects of phenotype-specific cytokines on viability of astrocytes in primary culture during anoxia were also explored.;Primary cultures of rat microglia/macrophages were exposed to 2h OGD and then incubated further under normal conditions; this was considered as a recovery period. Expression of mRNA for specific markers and secretion of phenotype-specific cytokines were explored at different time points by real time PCR and ELISA, respectively. Effects of cytokines that were secreted by microglia in primary culture after OGD on viability of astrocytes were determined.;Expression and secretion of M2 phenotype-specific markers and/or cytokines after OGD increased early after OGD and then decreased in the later stages of the recovery period. Expression and secretion of M1 phenotype-specific markers and cytokines did not show a common time pattern, but there was a tendency for an increase during the recovery period. All M1 phenotype-specific and two out of the three tested M2 phenotype-specific cytokines revealed protective effects on astrocytes during near-anoxia by a marked reduction of apoptosis.;Time-pattern of expression/secretion of phenotype-specific markers suggested that polarization of the brain microglia/macrophages in vitro to M2 and M1 phenotypes were largely independent and likely dependent on signaling from other brain cells, respectively. Time-pattern of polarization to the M2 phenotype partially resembled time-pattern that has been seen in vivo. Effects of M1 phenotype-specific cytokines on primary culture of astrocytes were protective, thus largely opposite to effects that have been observed in vivo.",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) counteracts the effects of angiotensin (Ang-II) by transforming it into Ang-(1-7), thus reducing the ligand for the AT1 receptor and increasing stimulation of the Mas receptor. Triple transgenic mice, SARA, which specifically overexpress ACE2 in neurons of R+A+ mice were used to study the role of ACE2 in ischemic stroke using oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) of brain slices as an in vitro model. We examined tissue swelling, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cell death in the cerebral cortex (CX) and the hippocampal CA1 region during OGD. Expression levels of NADPH oxidase (Nox) isoforms, Nox2 and Nox4 were measured using western blots. Results show that SARA mice and R+A+ mice treated with the Mas receptor agonist Ang-(1-7) had less swelling, cell death, and ROS production in CX and CA1 areas compared to those in R+A+ animals. Treatment of slices from SARA mice with the Mas antagonist A779 eliminated this protection. Finally, western blots revealed less Nox2 and Nox4 expression in SARA mice compared with R+A+ mice both before and after OGD. We suggest that reduced brain swelling and cell death observed in SARA animals exposed to OGD result from diminished ROS production coupled with lower expression of Nox isoforms. Thus, the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor pathway plays a protective role in brain ischemic damage by counteracting the detrimental effects of Ang-II-induced ROS production. ",

Upon cell stimulation, fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1), a typically plasma membrane-associated protein, is released from ER membranes into the cytosol and translocates to the cell nucleus by an importin-beta-mediated transport pathway along with its ligand, FGF-2. The nuclear accumulation of FGFR1 is activated by changes in cell contacts and by stimulation of cells with growth factors, neurotransmitters and hormones as well as by a variety of different second messengers and thus was named integrative nuclear FGFR1 signaling (INFS). In the nucleus, FGFR1 localizes specifically within nuclear matrix-attached speckle-domains, which are known to be sites for RNA Pol II-mediated transcription and co-transcriptional pre-mRNA processing. In these domains, nuclear FGFR1 colocalizes with RNA transcription sites, splicing factors, modified histones, phosphorylated RNA Pol II, and signaling kinases. Within the nucleus, FGFR1 serves as a general transcriptional regulator, as indicated by its association with the majority of active nuclear centers of RNA synthesis and processing, by the ability of nuclear FGFR1 to activate structurally distinct genes located on different chromosomes and by its stimulation of multi-gene programs for cell growth and differentiation. We propose that FGFR1 is part of a universal \"feed-forward-and-gate\" signaling module in which classical signaling cascades initiated by specific membrane receptors transmit signals to sequence specific transcription factors (ssTFs), while INFS elicited by the same stimuli feeds the signal forward to the common coactivator, CREB-binding protein (CBP). Activation of CBP by INFS, along with the activation of ssTFs by classical signaling cascades brings about coordinated responses from structurally different genes located at different genomic loci.",

Neurons were treated for 3 days with 500 μM DZ or feeding medium and then exposed to 3 h of continuous normoxia in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium with glucose or with 3 h of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by normoxia and feeding medium. The OGD decreased viability by 50%, depolarized mitochondria, and reduced mitochondrial respiration, whereas DZ treatment improved viability and mitochondrial respiration, and suppressed reactive oxygen species production, but did not restore mitochondrial membrane potential after OGD. Neuroprotection by DZ was associated with increased phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt), mTOR, and the major mTOR downstream substrate, S6 Kinase (S6K). The mTOR inhibitors rapamycin and Torin-1, as well as S6K-targeted siRNA abolished the protective effects of DZ. The effects of DZ on mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species production were not affected by rapamycin. Preconditioning with DZ also changed mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates. We conclude that in addition to reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial membrane depolarization, DZ protects against OGD by activation of the Akt-mTOR-S6K pathway and by changes in mitochondrial respiration. Ischemic strokes have limited therapeutic options. Diazoxide (DZ) preconditioning can reduce neuronal damage. Using oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), we studied Akt/mTOR/S6K signaling and mitochondrial respiration in neuronal preconditioning. We found DZ protects neurons against OGD via the Akt/mTOR/S6K pathway and alters the mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate.

The mechanisms of action of these cells, however, require further study, as do clinically relevant questions such as timing and route of cell administration. Here, we explored the effects of GRPs on neonatal hypoxia-ischemia during acute and subacute stages, using an in vitro transwell co-culture system with organotypic brain slices exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). OGD-exposed slices that were then co-cultured with GRPs without direct cell contact had decreased tissue injury and cortical cell death, as evaluated by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and propidium iodide (PI) staining. This effect was more pronounced when cells were added during the subacute phase of the injury. Furthermore, GRPs reduced the amount of glutamate in the slice supernatant and changed the proliferation pattern of endogenous progenitor cells in brain slices. In summary, we show that GRPs exert a neuroprotective effect on neonatal hypoxia-ischemia without the need for direct cell-cell contact, thus confirming the rising view that beneficial actions of stem cells are more likely attributable to trophic or immunomodulatory support rather than to long-term integration.

Erythropoietin (EPO), a hematopoietic growth factor, increases oxygen availability during hypoxia/ischemia and is associated with neuroprotection following hypoxia-ischemia in laboratory models of stroke. However, EPO has failed to translate in a clinical setting. Thus, it is critical to elucidate the key players in EPO-induced neuroprotection. Our preliminary studies have shown that EPO, as a downstream gene of HIF, inhibits HIF-1α in a dose-dependent manner in an in vitro model of hypoxia-ischemia. This study is designed to elucidate the primary mediator of EPO-induced HIF-1α inhibition and subsequent cell survival/neuroprotection. Oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) of nerve growth factor-differentiated rat pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cells were used to model hypoxia-ischemia in an in vitro environment. The profile of HIF-1α, HIF-2α and prolyl hydroxylase domain 2 (PHD-2) expression; HIF-1α and prolyl hydroxylase (PHD-2) mRNA levels; matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9; and cell death was evaluated in the presence and absence of either EPO or PHD-2 inhibitor during OGD. Our findings showed that EPO treatment resulted in an increase in PHD-2 transcription and translation, inhibition of HIF-1α expression, reactive oxygen species formation, and MMP-9 activity, resulting in increased cell survival after OGD. We also observed that EPO-induced cell survival/neuroprotection was reversed by siRNA silencing of PHD-2. This led to the conclusion that PHD-2 is a key mediator of EPO-induced HIF-1α inhibition and subsequent neuroprotection in an in vitro model of hypoxia-ischemia. ",

A possible autocrine role for this growth factor has been investigated in rat thyroid follicular cells both in vitro and in vivo. We report here the synthesis and localisation of basic FGF and one of its high affinity receptors (flg) in FRTL-5 cells, shown by Northern hybridization analysis, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Two major species of basic FGF mRNA of approximately 2.2 and 7.0 kilobases and one major species of flg mRNA of approximately 4.2 kilobases were identified in FRTL-5 cells. The basic FGF immunoreactivity observed histologically was attributed to a heparin-binding protein of approximately 20 kilodaltons mol wt. The physiological relevance of basic FGF to the thyroid is underlined by the demonstration of significant stores of immunoreactive protein, predominantly in the basement membrane of thyroid follicular cells, in paraffin sections of the normal rat thyroid, although basic FGF mRNA was not detected by in situ or Northern hybridization analysis. The mitogenic response of FRTL-5 cells to human recombinant basic FGF has been further characterized, and the factor shown to stimulate with an ED50 of 4 ng/ml. The mitogenic effects of exogenously supplied and endogenously produced basic FGF were shown to be potentiated by heparin. Examination of the mitogenic activity of both exogenous and endogenous basic FGF and its immunoneutralization in vitro suggests that locally produced basic FGF may be an important autocrine regulator of thyroid follicular cell growth.",

Fluorescence diminished diffusely along longitudinal wall but remained bright at cell poles (or cross walls); newly formed cross walls did not fluoresce. In agreement, reverse labeling (preincubation in unlabeled antibody, followed by staining on the slide with homologous FLG) showed that stainability of longitudinal wall increased gradually and diffusely with increased time of incubation, whereas polar wall remained nonfluorescent or stained only faintly; newly formed poles (or cross walls), on the other hand, stained brightly. These observations were confirmed by electron microscopy, after immunoferritin labeling.

In addition to its recognized antithrombotic action, SDX has endothelial protective potential, which is independent of the coagulation/fibrinolysis system. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of the endothelioprotective action of the drug are still unresolved. The aim of the present study was to determine whether treatment with SDX at concentrations of 0.125-0.5 lipase releasing unit (LRU)/ml have on the expression and activity of antioxidant enzymes in ischemic endothelial cells and how these effects might be related to the antiapoptotic properties of SDX. In the present study, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were subjected to ischemia-simulating conditions (combined oxygen and glucose deprivation, OGD) for 6h to determine the protective effects of SDX. SDX (0.25 and 0.5LRU/ml) in OGD significantly increased the cell viability and prevented mitochondrial depolarization in the HUVECs. Moreover, SDX protected the HUVECs against OGD-induced apoptosis. At concentrations of 0.25 and 0.5LRU/ml, the drug increased both superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) mRNA/protein expression together with a significant attenuation of oxidative stress in ischemic HUVECs. Our findings also demonstrate that an increase in both SOD and GPx activity is involved in the protective effect of SDX on ischemic endothelial cells. Altogether, these results suggest that SDX has a positive effect on ischemia-induced endothelial damage because of its antioxidant and antiapoptotic properties. ",

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma frequently (90% of the time) overexpresses fibroblast growth factor ligands (FGF-1 and FGF-2) and alternatively spliced high-affinity receptors (FGFR-1beta) (FGFR-1alpha was previously found in normal pancreatic tissue). To study the significance of this observation in vitro, PANC-1 cells were stably transfected via the pMEXneo vector containing FGFR-1alpha (PANC-1alpha) or FGFR-1beta (PANC-1beta) isoforms. Cells were treated with 1 mg/ml of 5-fluorouracil. Cells were evaluated for growth inhibition, apoptosis (propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry, caspase 3 activation) and for Bcl-x(L)/BAX expression (by Western blot analysis). In vivo, 7 x 10(6) cells of each isoform were injected into nude Balb/c mice for xenograft formation (N = 10). Compared to PANC-1beta (9%) in vitro, 5-fluorouracil-induced death was significantly (P < 0.05) increased in PANC-1alpha (20%) at 24 hours. Increased cell death in PANC-1alpha was mediated by activated caspase 3 and was correlated with decreased expression of Bcl-x(L)/BAX. In vivo, PANC-1beta readily demonstrated formation of tumor xenograft at 2 weeks, whereas PANC-1alpha did not form tumors. Alternative splicing of FGFR-1 to the beta isoform appears to correlate with pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell growth in vivo and resistance to chemotherapy. Inhibition of FGFR-1 splicing or overexpression of FGFR-1alpha inhibits pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell growth in vivo and restores cytotoxic responses to chemotherapy, thereby suggesting the basis of rational interventional strategies for this devastating tumor.",

Of DGK isozymes, DGKζ localizes to the nucleus in various cells such as neurons. We previously reported that DGKζ translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons after 20 min of transient forebrain ischemia. In this study, we examined the underlying mechanism of DGKζ translocation using hippocampal slices exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) to simulate an ischemic model of the brain. DGKζ-immunoreactivity gradually changed from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in CA1 pyramidal neurons after 20 min of OGD and was never detected in the nucleus after reoxygenation. Intriguingly, DGKζ was detected in the nucleus at 10 min OGD whereas the following 60 min reoxygenation induced complete cytoplasmic translocation of DGKζ. Morphometric analysis revealed that DGKζ cytoplasmic translocation correlated with nuclear shrinkage indicative of an early process of neuronal degeneration. The translocation under OGD conditions was blocked by NMDA receptor (NMDAR) inhibitor, and was induced by activation of NMDAR. Chelation of the extracellular Ca(2+) blocked the translocation under OGD conditions. These results show that DGKζ cytoplasmic translocation is triggered by activation of NMDAR with subsequent extracellular Ca(2+) influx. Furthermore, inhibition of PKC activity under OGD conditions led to nuclear retention of DGKζ in about one-third of the neurons, suggesting that PKC activity partially regulates DGKζ cytoplasmic translocation. These findings provide clues to guide further investigation of glutamate excitotoxicity mechanisms in hippocampal neurons.",

OGD reduced neuronal viability (%naive controls, mean +/- SE, n = 24-96, P < 0.05) to 44 +/- 1%, but 3-day pretreatment with RST (5 microM) increased survival to 82 +/- 2% (P < 0.05). One-day RST treatment was not protective. RST-induced neuroprotection was abolished by mevalonate or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), but not by cholesterol coapplication. Furthermore, RST-induced decreases in neuronal cholesterol levels were abolished by mevalonate but not by GGPP. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were reduced in RST-preconditioned neurons after OGD, and this effect was also reversed by both mevalonate and GGPP. These data suggested that GGPP, but not cholesterol depletion, were responsible for the induction of neuroprotection. Therefore, we tested whether 3-day treatments with perillic acid, a nonspecific inhibitor of both geranylgeranyl transferase (GGT) GGT 1 and Rab GGT, and the GGT 1-specific inhibitor GGTI-286 would reproduce the effects of RST. Perillic acid, but not GGTI-286, elicited robust neuronal preconditioning against OGD. RST, GGTI-286, and perillic acid all decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and lactate dehydrogenase activity in the cultured neurons, but only RST and perillic acid reduced neuronal ATP and membrane Rab3a protein levels. In conclusion, RST preconditions cultured neurons against OGD via depletion of GGPP, leading to decreased geranylgeranylation of proteins that are probably not isoprenylated by GGT 1. Reduced neuronal ATP levels and ROS production after OGD may be directly involved in the mechanism of neuroprotection.",

Neuronal death was first evident in the CA1 region 24 h after the injury as assessed by propidium iodide (PI) labeling, and continued to extend to the CA3/4 region up to 72 h. At 6 days post-OGD, PI labeling was weak and diffuse with no clear demarcation of pyknotic nuclei. To characterize biochemical changes produced by OGD, cellular efflux of three key amino acid neurotransmitters was evaluated. OGD elicited large increases in the release of GABA and aspartate (55- and 4.5-fold increase over basal, respectively), while there were no detectable changes in extracellular glutamate levels. In order to ascertain the existence of the synaptic pool of glutamate, sister cultures were treated with sodium azide. This evoked a strong increase in glutamate release, suggesting the intactness of the glutamate system. Further studies revealed a time-dependent activation of caspase 3 following OGD, shown by immunoblot analysis as well as by confocal laser scanning microscopy. While we did not observe the activation of caspases 1, 2, or 8 in our model, the activation of caspase 9 was evident, peaking at 12 h post-OGD. Despite no apparent increase in glutamate release by ischemic slices, treatment with a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist or an alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) antagonist significantly reduced neuronal death. Furthermore, a pan-caspase inhibitor (zVAD-fmk), but not the caspase 3 inhibitor (DEVD-fmk), provided partial neuroprotection. Inhibition of a Ca(2+)-dependent cysteine protease, calpain, by MDL28170 also elicited partial neuroprotective effects.",

The brain was rapidly removed, and the dissected hippocampus was sliced in cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) transversely to its longitudinal axis (400 mum thick) with a Rotorslicer DTY-7700. Slices were placed on a nylon mesh in a recording chamber at 34 degrees C and humidified gas mixture (95% O2/5% CO2) was applied to the chamber at a flow rate of 200 ml/min. After 2 h of incubation, slices were randomly exposed to 2%, 4%, 6% sevoflurane or 6% sevoflurane combined with mitochondrial K(ATP) channel blocker (5-hydroxydecanoic acid, 5-HD) under normal condition (95% O2/5% CO2) for 30 min. Fifteen minutes later, slices were exposed to 14-minute OGD followed by 1-hour reoxygenation, and the changes of orthodromic population spike (OPS) at the end of reoxygenation were measured. The changes of ultrastructure of CA1 area in the group of 14-minute OGD followed by 1-hour reoxygenation were detected with electron microscope. The results showed that sevoflurane preconditioning delayed the abolishing time of OPS (P<0.01) and significantly increased the recovery rate and the recovery amplitude of OPS compared with the OGD group. The recovery rate of OPS was 71.4% both in 4% and 6% sevoflurane preconditioning groups (P<0.05 vs OGD group), accordingly the recovery amplitude of OPS was (61.0 +/- 42.3)% and (78.7 +/- 21.1)% (P<0.01), respectively. The protective effect of 6% sevoflurane was blocked by 5-HD. Ultrastructural observation in the hippocampal CA1 region of the OGD group showed severe edema of the pyramidal cells, crimpled or ruptured nucleus membranes, aggregation of chromatin, and swelling of mitochondria, whereas these changes were less prominent in 4% and 6% sevoflurane groups. These results suggest that sevoflurane preconditioning is capable to protect neurons from OGD injury in vitro and that the protective effect is related to the activation of mitochondrial K(ATP) channels.",

Here, by using real-time PCR and ELISA, we identified the distribution of active GLP-1Rs in the rat primary cortical neurons. After establishment of an in vitro ischemia model by oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD), neurons were treated with various dosages of Ex-4. The MTT assay showed that the relative survival rate increased with the dosage of Ex-4 ranging from 0.2 to 0.8 μg/ml (P<0.001, vs. OGD group). The apoptosis rate was reduced from (49.47±2.70)% to (14.61±0.81)% after Ex-4 treatment (0.4 μg/ml) 12h after OGD (P<0.001). Moreover, immunofluorescence staining indicated that Ex-4 increased glucose-regulated proteins 78 (GRP78) and reduced C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP). Western blot analysis demonstrated that, after neurons were treated with Ex-4, GRP78 was up-regulated over time (P<0.01, vs. OGD group), while CHOP levels rose to a peak 8h after OGD and then decreased (P<0.05, vs. OGD group). This effect was changed by both the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H89 (P<0.01, P<0.05, respectively, vs. Ex-4 group) and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 (P<0.01, P<0.01, respectively, vs. Ex-4 group) but not by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor U0126. Our study also revealed that, compared with the Ex-4 group, inhibition of the PKA signaling pathway significantly decreased the survival rate of neurons, down-regulated the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and up-regulated the Bax expression 3h after ODG (P<0.05, P<0.01, respectively), while neither PI3K nor MAPK inhibition exerted such effects. Furthermore, Western blotting exhibited that PKA expression was elevated in the presence or absence of OGD insults (P<0.05).

The present study has investigated the neuroprotective potential, as well as the possible underlying molecular mechanisms, exerted by retigabine and flupirtine in rat organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs) exposed to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), oxygen and glucose deprivation followed by reoxygenation (OGD), or serum withdrawal (SW). Region-specific vulnerability of hippocampal subfields occurred with each of these injury models. Specifically, CA1 was the most susceptible region to both NMDA and OGD-induced neurodegeneration, whereas selective cell death in the dentate gyrus (DG) occurred upon OHSCs exposure to SW. The NMDA antagonist MK-801 (10-30 microM), despite blocking NMDA- and OGD-induced cell death, failed to prevent SW-induced neurodegeneration. Interestingly, retigabine (0.01-10 microM) and flupirtine (0.01-10 microM) dose-dependently prevented DG neuronal death induced by SW, with IC50 s of 0.4 microM and 0.7 microM, respectively. By contrast, retigabine and flupirtine (each at 10 microM) were less effective in counteracting NMDA- or OGD-induced toxicity in the CA1 region. Both retigabine and flupirtine (0.1-10 microM) reduced SW-induced ROS production in the DG with IC50 s of approximately 1 microM. This suggested that antioxidant actions of these compounds participated in OHSC neuroprotection during SW. By contrast, activation of KCNQ K+ channels seemed not to be involved in retigabine-induced OHSCs neuroprotection during SW, since linopirdine (20 microM) and XE-991 (10 microM), two KCNQ blockers, failed to reverse retigabine-induced neuronal rescue.",

Carnitine metabolism directly supports mitochondrial metabolism by shuttling long chain fatty acids across the inner mitochondrial membrane for beta-oxidation. Our previous studies have shown that HI disrupts carnitine homeostasis in neonatal rats and that L-carnitine can be neuroprotective. Thus, this study was undertaken to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which HI alters carnitine metabolism and to begin to elucidate the mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effect of L-carnitine (LCAR) supplementation. Utilizing neonatal rat hippocampal slice cultures we found that oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) decreased the levels of free carnitines (FC) and increased the acylcarnitine (AC): FC ratio. These changes in carnitine homeostasis correlated with decreases in the protein levels of carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT) 1 and 2. LCAR supplementation prevented the decrease in CPT1 and CPT2, enhanced both FC and the AC∶FC ratio and increased slice culture metabolic viability, the mitochondrial membrane potential prior to OGD and prevented the subsequent loss of neurons during later stages of reperfusion through a reduction in apoptotic cell death. Finally, we found that LCAR supplementation preserved the structural integrity and synaptic transmission within the hippocampus after OGD. Thus, we conclude that LCAR supplementation preserves the key enzymes responsible for maintaining carnitine homeostasis and preserves both cell viability and synaptic transmission after OGD.",

Ischaemia was modelled by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and permeability was measured by transepithelial electrical resistance. Endocannabinoids or endocannabinoid-like compounds were assessed for their ability to modulate baseline permeability or OGD-induced hyperpermeability. Target sites of action were investigated using receptor antagonists and subsequently identified with real-time PCR.;Anandamide (10 μM) and oleoylethanolamide (OEA, 10 μM) decreased BBB permeability (i.e. increased resistance).

Many of the important genes associated with G1 regulation have been shown to play a key role in proliferation, differentiation and oncogenic transformation and programmed cell death (apoptosis). Currently, a variety of \"cytostatic\" agents that affects G1 progression and/or G1/S transition are being evaluated in clinical trials. Flavopiridol is a potent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). UCN-01 was originally found to be a PKC-selective protein kinase antagonist. More recent studies have revealed that this agent can also inhibit several CDKs and the checkpoint kinase CHK1. FR901228, MS-27-275 and SAHA are histone deacetylase inhibitors that induce changes in the transcription of specific genes via the hyperacetylation of histones. The proteasome inhibitor PS-341 disrupts the degradation process of intracellular proteins, including cell cycle regulatory proteins such as cyclins. R115777, SCH66336 and BMS-214662 are non-peptidic farnesyl transferase inhibitors that prevent p21 ras oncogene activation. Rapamycin derivative CCI-779 downregulates signals through S6 kinase and FRAP (FKBP-rapamycin associating protein), affecting the expression levels of mRNAs important for progression from G1 to S phase. 17-Allylaminogeldanamycin targets the Hsp-90 (heat shock protein-90) family of cellular chaperones regulating the function of signaling proteins. TNP-470 (AGM-1470), a fumagillin derivative shows antiangiogenic action through binding to MetAP-2 (methionine aminopeptidase-2). The antitumor sulfonamide E7070, causing a cellular accumulation in the G1 phase, has been shown to suppress the activation of CDK2 and cyclin E expression in HCT116 colorectal cancer cell line highly sensitive to the drug. With respect to several growth factor receptors such as EGFR, PDGFR, bFGFR and VEGFR, potent and specific inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases have been also examined as hopeful drug candidates.

DNA fragmentation, mitochondrial transmembrane potential, mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activity were observed after subjecting cerebellar granule neurons to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD).;The results showed that OGD induced typical cell apoptosis change, DNA ladder and apoptosis-related alterations in mitochondrial functions including depression of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (its maximal protection ratio was 73.26%) and release of cytochrome c (its maximal inhibition ratio was 42.52%) and the subsequent activation of caspase-3 (its maximal protection ratio was 59.32%) in cytoplasm. Melatonin reduced DNA damage and inhibited release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and activation of caspase-3. Melatonin can strongly prevent the OGD-induced loss of the mitochondria membrane potential.;Our findings suggested that the direct inhibition of mitochondrial pathway might essentially contribute to its anti-apoptotic effects in neuronal ischemia-reperfusion.",

It was found that isoquercetin administered prior to the insult could prevent OGD/R-induced intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca(2+)]i) increase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and cell viability decrease. For the first time, isoquercetin is described as a neuroprotective agent that potentially explains the alleviation and prevention from OGD/R-induced injury in neurons. Mechanistic studies showed that the neuroprotective effect of isoquercetin was carried out by anti-inflammatory signaling pathway of inhibiting protein expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), and mRNA expression of TNF-α and IL-6, accompanied by the anti-apoptotic signaling pathway of deactivation of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK), Jun kinase (JNK) and p38, and inhibition of activity of caspase-3.

Activating alterations in a variety of potential oncogenic driver genes have also been identified in NSCLC, including ROS1, RET, MET, HER2, and BRAF. Together with EGFR and ALK, these mutations account for ∼20% of NSCLCs. The identification of these oncogenic drivers has led to the design of rationally targeted therapies that have produced superior clinical outcomes in tumours harbouring these mutations. Many patients, however, have de novo or acquired resistance to these therapies. In addition, most NSCLCs are genetically complex tumours harbouring multiple potential activating events. For these patients, disease subsets are likely to be defined by combination strategies involving a number of targeted agents. These targets include FGFR1, PTEN, MET, MEK, PD-1/PD-L1, and NaPi2b. In light of the myriad new biomarkers and targeted agents, multiplex testing strategies will be invaluable in identifying the appropriate patients for each therapy and enabling targeted agents to be channelled to the patients most likely to gain benefit.

Biochemically, ARQ 087 exhibited IC50 values of 1.8 nM for FGFR2, and 4.5 nM for FGFR1 and 3. In cells, inhibition of FGFR2 auto-phosphorylation and other proteins downstream in the FGFR pathway (FRS2α, AKT, ERK) was evident by the response to ARQ 087 treatment. Cell proliferation studies demonstrated ARQ 087 has anti-proliferative activity in cell lines driven by FGFR dysregulation, including amplifications, fusions, and mutations. Cell cycle studies in cell lines with high levels of FGFR2 protein showed a positive relationship between ARQ 087 induced G1 cell cycle arrest and subsequent induction of apoptosis.

Therefore, we established an in vitro NVU model to investigate the effects of BCP on oxygen-glucose deprivation and re-oxygenation (OGD/R)-induced injury. This model involved the co-culture of brain microvascular endothelial cells, neurons, and astrocytes. BCP (10 μmol/L) was applied for 24 h prior to OGD/R and maintained throughout OGD/R. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and neuronal apoptosis were analyzed. BCP pre-treatment prior to the initiation of OGD/R significantly (i) decreased BBB permeability and neuronal apoptosis, (ii) mitigated oxidative stress damage and the release of inflammatory cytokines, (iii) down-regulated Bax expression, metalloproteinase-9 activity and expression, and (iv) up-regulated claudin-5, occludin, ZO-1, growth-associated protein-43 and Bcl-2 expression. Thus, BCP pre-treatment exerted multiple protective effects on NVU in the context of OGD/R-induced injury. These protective effects potentially occur via reductions in oxidative stress damage and inflammatory cytokines that induce BBB breakdown, subsequently resulting in reduced neuronal apoptosis.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of lidocaine on SE-stimulated activation of PBMCs from AD patients. PBMCs were isolated from ten AD patients and stimulated by staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) or staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) in the presence or absence of lidocaine in various concentrations. Cellular proliferation and the release of representative TH1- and TH2-type cytokines were measured. The effect of lidocaine on filaggrin (FLG) expression in HaCaT cells co-cultured with SE-activated PBMCs was also examined. Our results demonstrated that lidocaine dose-dependently inhibited the proliferative response and the release of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, TNF-α, and IFN-γ from SEA- and SEB-stimulated PBMCs and also blocked the down-regulation of FLG expression in HaCaT cells co-cultured with SEA- and SEB-activated PBMCs.

However, the precise mechanism for an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under pathological conditions is not yet fully understood. We have recently demonstrated an implication of phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), a tumor suppressor, in ROS generation and neuronal apoptosis induced by staurosporine. These findings raised further interest whether PTEN functions as a common mediator of oxidative stress in neurodegenerative processes. To address this issue, neural cells were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and to the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium iodide (MPP(+)), which mimic cerebral ischemia and Parkinson's disease, respectively. OGD for 4 h followed by 16 h of reoxygenation or incubation with MPP(+) (250 microM) for 48 h induced 33% and 45% neuronal death in rat hippocampal and in human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y neurons, respectively, accompanied by a gradual increase in the intracellular level of ROS. The increase in ROS by OGD and by MPP(+) did not cause oxidative inactivation of PTEN and thus, PTEN remains constitutively active. In support, the protein level of PTEN was not reduced in both cell cultures after challenging with OGD or MPP(+). Importantly, the elevated intracellular ROS levels and the neuronal death caused by OGD or by MPP(+) toxicity were significantly inhibited when PTEN was downregulated by a specific antisense oligonucleotide or by siRNA. Because SOD2 protein level is not altered either by knockdown of PTEN nor by an inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signalling, we suggest that SOD2 do not contribute to the pathomechanism of oxidative stress induced by PTEN or by inhibiting the related Akt signalling. The present study highlights PTEN as a crucial and common mediator of ROS generation and neuronal death and suggests that PTEN could become a potential therapeutic target for interfering with neurodegeneration.",

We thus attempted to confirm neuroprotective effects of NSP on astrocytes in the ischemic state and then explored the relative mechanisms. Astrocytes from neonatal rats were treated with oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by reoxygenation (OGD/R). To confirm the neuroprotective effects of NSP, we measured the cell survival rate, relative lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release; we also performed morphological methods, namely Hoechst 33342 staining and Annexin V assay. To explore the potential mechanisms of NSP, the release of nitric oxide (NO) and TNF-α related to NSP administration were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The proteins related to the NF-κB, ERK1/2, and PI3K/Akt pathways were investigated by Western blotting. To verify the cause-and-effect relationship between neuroprotection and the NF-κB pathway, a NF-κB pathway inhibitor sc3060 was employed to observe the effects of NSP-induced neuroprotection. We found that NSP significantly increased the cell survival rate and reduced LDH release in OGD/R-treated astrocytes. It also reduced NO/TNF-α release. Western blotting showed that the protein levels of p-IKKBα/β and P65 were upregulated by the OGD/R treatment and such effects were significantly inhibited by NSP administration. The NSP-induced inhibition could be significantly reversed by administration of the NF-κB pathway inhibitor sc3060, whereas, expressions of p-ERK1, p-ERK2, and p-AKT were upregulated by the OGD/R treatment; however, their levels were unchanged by NSP administration. Our results thus verified the neuroprotective effects of NSP in ischemic astrocytes. The potential mechanisms include inhibition of the release of NO/TNF-α and repression of the NF-κB signaling pathways. Our data also indicated that NSP has little influence on the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways. ",

In this study, we investigated the effects of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) on the firing properties of UBCs and granule cells and spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) of Purkinje cells using whole-cell recordings. Short-term OGD induced increases in spontaneous firing of UBCs by causing membrane depolarization via the activation of NMDA receptors. UBC firing indirectly affected Purkinje cells by altering parallel fiber inputs of a subset granule cells, resulting in a marked increase in sEPSCs in Purkinje cells in vestibulo-cerebellar lobules IX-X, but not in lobules IV-VI, which have fewer UBCs. Similarly, the frequency and amplitude of sEPSCs in Purkinje cells were significantly greater in lobules IX-X than in IV-VI, even in control conditions.

Our results show that both LPS and OGD induced the up-regulation of TSPO expression on BV-2 microglia by RT-PCR, western blot and immunocytochemistry.

        "Doc_abstract":"Astrocytic glutamate transporters are considered an important target for neuroprotective therapies as the function of these transporters is abnormal in stroke and other neurological disorders associated with excitotoxicity. Recently, Rothstein et al., [Rothstein JD, Patel S, Regan MR, Haenggeli C, Huang YH, Bergles DE, Jin L, Dykes Hoberg M, Vidensky S, Chung DS, Toan SV, Bruijn LI, Su ZZ, Gupta P, Fisher PB (2005) Beta-lactam antibiotics offer neuroprotection by increasing glutamate transporter expression. Nature 433:73-77] reported that beta-lactam antibiotics (including ceftriaxone, which easily crosses the blood-brain barrier) increase glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) expression and reduce cell death resulting from oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in dissociated embryonic cortical cultures. To determine whether a similar neuroprotective mechanism operates in more mature neurons, which show a different pattern of response to ischemia than primary cultures, we exposed acute hippocampal slices obtained from rats treated with ceftriaxone for 5 days (200 mg/kg; i.p.) to OGD. Whole-cell patch clamp recording of glutamate-induced N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) currents from CA1 pyramidal neurons showed a larger potentiation of these currents after application of 15 microM dl-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartic acid (TBOA; a potent blocker of glutamate transporters) in ceftriaxone-injected animals than in untreated animals, indicating increased glutamate transporter activity. Western blot analysis did not reveal GLT-1 upregulation in the hippocampus. Delay to OGD-induced hypoxic spreading depression (HSD) recorded in slices obtained from ceftriaxone-treated rats was longer (6.3+/-0.2 vs. 5.2+/-0.2 min; P<0.001) than that in the control group, demonstrating a neuroprotective action of the antibiotic in this model. The effect of ceftriaxone was also tested in organotypic hippocampal slices obtained from P7-9 rats (>14 days in vitro). OGD or glutamate (3.5-5.0 mM) damaged CA1 pyramidal neurons as assessed by propidium iodide (PI) fluorescence. Similar damage was observed after pre-treatment with ceftriaxone (10-200 microM; 5 days) and ceftriaxone exposure did not result in GLT-1 upregulation as assayed by Western blot. Treatment of slice cultures with dibutyryl cAMP (100-250 microM; 5 days) increased GLT-1 expression but did not reduce cell damage induced by OGD or glutamate. Thus we confirm the neuroprotective effect of antibiotic exposure on OGD-induced injury, but suggest that this action is related to independent modulation of transporter activity rather than to the level of GLT-1 protein expression. In addition, our results indicate that the protective effects of beta-lactam antibiotics are highly dependent on the experimental model.",

LY294002 induced increased propidium iodide (PI) uptake and caspase 3/7 activity in both regions, with a faster onset in DG.

When the apoptotic process is blocked, a form of programmed necrosis called necroptosis occurs. Apoptosis and necroptosis may share some regulatory mechanisms. Recent studies indicated that receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1), an Hsp90-associated kinase, is an important regulatory switch between apoptosis and necroptosis. In this study, we showed that oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) combined with a caspase inhibitor zVAD (OGD/zVAD)-induced RIP1 protein expression in a time-dependent manner. We found that geldanamycin (GA), a benzoquinone ansamycin, protected against neuronal injury induced by OGD/zVAD treatment in cultured primary neurons. More importantly, GA decreased RIP1 protein level in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. In this study, we found that GA also decreased the Hsp90 protein level, which caused instability of RIP1 protein, resulting in decreased RIP1 protein level but not RIP1 mRNA level after GA treatment. We concluded that the GA-mediated protection against OGD/zVAD-induced neuronal injury was associated with enhanced RIP1 protein instability by decreasing Hsp90 protein level. GA and its derivatives may be promising for the prevention of neuronal injury during ischemic injury.",

Silencing of TSP-1 expression may contribute to the postischemic angiogenesis. Upregulation of TSP-1, in contrast, may terminate the postischemic angiogenesis. A possible mechanism that silences TSP-1 expression is the DNA methylation of its promoter region. DNA methylation has been reported following cerebral ischemia. The present study aimed to explore whether methylation of the promoter region of TSP-1 regulates its expression after oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in murine cerebral endothelial cells (CECs) in vitro. Sublethal OGD increased the extent of methylation of the promoter region of TSP-1 with a concurrent decrease in TSP-1 mRNA and protein expression in CECs. After reoxygenation, demethylation of the TSP-1 promoter region led to the restoration of TSP-1 mRNA and protein expression. The extent of methylation of the promoter region of TSP-1 was inversely correlated with the extent of TSP-1 gene expression at mRNA and protein levels after OGD. Oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced reduction in the TSP-1 mRNA level was not accompanied by a change in mRNA stability. These findings raise the possibility that OGD downregulation of TSP-1 expression is at least in part due to methylation of its promoter region.",

Here we showed that ASICs and PICK1 played key roles in OGD-Rep process. In wild-type cultured cortical neurons, not only the amplitude of ASICs current and the calcium transients induced by acidosis were both increased after OGD-Rep, but also the total protein levels of ASIC1 and ASIC2a were up-regulated progressively after ischemia insults, indicating that ASICs play a vital role in neuronal ischemia. However, these activities were reversed with PICK1-knockout after OGD-Rep, accompanied with the dramatically down-regulating the protein abundances of ASIC1 and ASIC2a, which suggested the neuroprotection activity in brain ischemia by PICK1-knockout.

AS-IV exerted significant neuroprotective effects against OGD/R by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, thereby attenuating oxidative stress and neuronal cell death. We found that AS-IV treatment in cortical neurons resulted in NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling activation, evidenced by Nrf2 Ser-40 phosphorylation, and its nuclear localization, as well as transcription of antioxidant-responsive element (ARE)-regulated genes: heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1) and sulphiredoxin 1 (SRXN-1). Knockdown of Nrf2 through lentiviral shRNAs prevented AS-IV-induced ARE genes transcription, and abolished its anti-oxidant and neuroprotective activities. Further, we discovered that AS-IV stimulated heparin-binding-epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) release to trans-activate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in cortical neurons. Blockage or silencing EGFR prevented Nrf2 activation by AS-IV, thus inhibiting AS-IV-mediated anti-oxidant and neuroprotective activities against OGD/R. In summary, AS-IV protects cortical neurons against OGD/R damages through activating of EGFR-Nrf2 signaling. ",

Here, the requirement for FGF signaling in forming midline cell types and commissural axon tracts of the cerebral hemispheres is examined. Fgfr1, but not Fgfr3, is found to be essential for establishing all three commissural tracts. In an Fgfr1 mutant, commissural neurons are present and initially project their axons, but these fail to cross the midline that separates the hemispheres. Moreover, midline patterning defects are observed in the mutant. These defects include the loss of the septum and three specialized glial cell types, the indusium griseum glia, midline zipper glia, and glial wedge. Our findings demonstrate that FGF signaling is required for generating telencephalic midline structures, in particular septal and glial cell types and all three cerebral commissures.

Three days after implantation, the pellets containing rhBMP-2 were surrounded by fibroblastic mesenchymal cells; on day 7, cartilage tissue appeared; on day 10, hypertrophic chondrocytes and a small amount of mineralized tissue were observed; and, on day 14, the amount of mineralized tissue increased. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that FGF-4 expression appeared at early stages (days 3 and 7) and its expression decreased at later stages (days 10, 14, and 21), whereas FGFRs were expressed continuously. In situ hybridization revealed that, on days 3 and 7, FGF-4, and FGFR subtypes 1 and 2 (FGFR-1 and FGFR-2) were expressed in mesenchymal cells and chondrocytes, and in the area of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) expression.

Adult neurogenesis requires several neurotrophic factors to sustain and regulate the proliferation and differentiation of the adult stem cell population. In the present review, we examine the cellular and functional aspects of a trophic system mediated by fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and its receptors (FGFRs) related to neurogenesis in the SVZ and SGZ of the adult rat brain. In the SVZ, FGF-2 is expressed in GFAP-positive cells of SVZ but is not present in proliferating precursor cells, which instead express FGFR-1 and FGFR-2, but not FGFR-3 mRNA, although expressed in the SVZ, and FGFR-4. Therefore, it seems that in the SVZ FGF-2 may be released by GFAP-positive cells, different from the precursor cell lineage, and via volume transmission it reaches the proliferating precursor cells. FGFR-1 mRNA is also expressed in the SGZ and is localized in BrdU-labeled precursor cells, whereas FGFR-2 and FGFR-3 mRNA, although expressed in the SGZ, are not located within proliferating precursor cells. An aged-related decline of proliferating precursor cells in the SVZ and DG of old rats has been well documented, and there is the suggestion that in part it could be the consequence of alterations in growth factor expression levels. Thus, the old precursors may respond to growth factors, suggesting that during aging the basic components for neuronal precursor cell proliferation are retained and the capacity to increase neurogenesis after appropriate stimulation is still preserved. In conclusion, the trophic system mediated by FGF-2 and its receptors contributes to create an important micro-environmental niche that promotes neurogenesis in the adult and aged brain.",

This protective effect is hypothesized to be mediated by phytoestrogens contained in soy, because some of these compounds have neuroprotective effects in in vitro models of cell death. We tested the ability of the soy phytoestrogens genistein, daidzein, and the daidzein metabolite equol to protect embryonic rat primary cortical neurons from ischemic-like injury in vitro at doses typical of circulating concentrations in human populations (0.1-1 microM). All three phytoestrogens inhibited lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release from cells exposed to glutamate toxicity or the calcium-ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin. In cells exposed to hypoxia or oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), pretreatment with the phytoestrogens inhibited cell death in an estrogen receptor (ER) dependent manner. Although OGD results in multiple modes of cell death, examination of alpha-spectrin cleavage and caspase-3 activation revealed that the phytoestrogens were able to inhibit apoptotic cell death in this model. In addition, blockade of phosphoinositide 3-kinase prevented the protective effects of genistein and daidzein, and blockade of mitogen-activated protein kinase prevented genistein-dependent neuroprotection. These results suggest that pretreatment with dietary levels of soy phytoestrogens can mimic neuroprotective effects observed with estrogen and appear to use the same ER-kinase pathways to inhibit apoptotic cell death.",

The protective effects of P188 were tested in PCNs in vitro exposed to OGD, as well as in cerebral ischemia in vivo. Cell death and viability were detected with LDH and MTT assay, and mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed using fluorescence microscopy. The apoptosis and autophagy of PCNs were investigated by expressions of cyt-c, caspase-3, light chain 3 (LC3), and Beclin-1. In addition, a mouse middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was used to produce focal ischemia, and mice were treated with P188 and rapamycin after MCAO 10 min. The infarct volume, neurological scores, and phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) were evaluated. The in vitro results showed that P188 prevented OGD-induced primary cerebrocortical neuron death and inhibited loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, the release of mitochondrial apoptogenic factor cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytoplasm, and activation of caspase-3. P188 suppressed the activation of autophagy by decreasing LC3-II and Beclin-1 levels under OGD accordingly. Moreover, the in vivo results showed that P188 and rapamycin remarkably reduced the infarct volume and neurological deficits in the MCAO mouse model of cerebral ischemia, respectively. Both P188 and rapamycin induced phosphorylation of mTOR and reversed the decreased level upon MCAO. These data indicate that P188 prevents neuronal cell death resulting from ischemic brain injury and that its neuroprotective effects are mediated by preventing mitochondrial membrane integrity damage and autophagic activation. Given that it has low toxicity, P188 might become a potential novel therapy for ischemic injury. ",

However, hibernation, a model of natural tolerance to cerebral ischemia, is associated with downregulation of Akt. We previously established a model of ischemic tolerance in a PC12 cell line and using this model we now addressed the question whether ischemic tolerance also downregulates Akt in PC12 cells. Kinetic studies showed decreased Akt phosphorylation in tolerized cells. Similarly, phosphorylated levels of three major targets of Akt and well-known proapoptotic factors, the glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), a Forkhead family member, FoxO4, and the protein murine double minute 2 (MDM2), all inactivated upon phosphorylation by Akt, were decreased in preconditioned cells. In addition, pharmacological blockade of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway reduced cell death induced by oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and increased the protective effect of preconditioning (PC). Furthermore, decreasing availability of P-Akt by transfecting PC12 cells with constructs of inactive Akt also resulted in protection against OGD and potentiation of the protective effect of PC. Depending on the environment, GSK-3, FOXO-4, and MDM2 can trigger apoptotic responses or cell cycle arrest, and thus, in a situation of reduced energy, driving the cells into a state of quiescence might be neuroprotective. This work suggests that in the context of tolerance downregulation of Akt is beneficial.",

Plasma levels of semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase/vascular adhesion protein 1 (SSAO/VAP-1, also known as Primary Amine Oxidase -PrAO) are increased in both stroke and AD patients and contribute to the vascular damage. During inflammation, its enzymatic activity mediates leukocyte recruitment to the injured tissue, inducing damage in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and neuronal tissue. We hypothesized that by altering cerebrovascular function, SSAO/VAP-1 might play a role in the stroke-AD transition. Therefore, we evaluated the protective effect of the novel multitarget-directed ligand DPH-4, initially designed for AD therapy, on the BBB.;A human microvascular brain endothelial cell line expressing human SSAO/VAP-1 was generated, as the expression of SSAO/VAP-1 is lost in cultured cells. To simulate ischaemic damage, these cells were subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and re-oxygenation conditions. The protective role of DPH-4 was then evaluated in the presence of methylamine, an SSAO substrate, and/or β-amyloid (Aβ).;Under our conditions, DPH-4 protected brain endothelial cells from OGD and re-oxygenation-induced damage, and also decreased SSAO-dependent leukocyte adhesion. DPH-4 was also effective at preventing the damage induced by OGD and re-oxygenation in the presence of Aβ as a model of AD pathology.;From these results, we concluded that the multitarget compound DPH-4 might be of therapeutic benefit to delay the onset and/or progression of the neurological pathologies associated with stroke and AD, which appear to be linked.",

To study the role of glycosylation in the secretion of K-FGF, we mutated the human K-fgf cDNA to eliminate the glycosylation signal and the mutated cDNA was cloned into a mammalian expression vector. Studies of immunoprecipitation from the conditioned medium of cells expressing this plasmid revealed that the lack of glycosylation did not impair secretion, however the unglycosylated protein was immediately cleaved into two NH2-terminally truncated peptides of 13 and 15 kD, which appeared to be more biologically active than the wild-type protein. These two proteins also showed higher heparin binding affinity than that of wt K-FGF. We have expressed in bacteria the larger of these two proteins (K140), in which the NH2-terminal 36 amino acids present in the mature form of K-FGF have been deleted. Mitogenicity assays on several cell lines showed that purified recombinant K140 had approximately five times higher biological activity than wild-type recombinant K-FGF. Studies of receptor binding showed that K140 had higher affinity than wt K-FGF for two of the four members of FGF receptor's family, specifically for FGFR-1 (flg) and FGFR-2 (bek). K140 also had increased heparin binding ability, but this property does not appear to be responsible for the increased affinity for FGF receptors. Thus removal of the NH2-terminal 36 amino acids from the mature K-FGF produces growth factor molecules with an altered conformation, resulting in higher heparin affinity, and more efficient binding to FGF receptors. Although it is not clear whether cleavage of K-FGF to generate K140 occurs in vivo, this could represent a novel mechanism of modulation of growth factor activity.",

We examined the expression of PlGF in cerebral ischemia, utilizing a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model in the rat.

To elucidate the effects of PlGF in cerebral ischemic injury, we investigated the effects of varying concentrations of PlGF upon neurons in an in vitro model of OGD. The effects of PlGF upon neuronal vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) expression were examined. We detected PlGF immunoreactivity mainly in the microvessels and interstitum of rat brain cortex after cerebral ischemic injury. In primary BMECs, PlGF expression and release were significantly higher under OGD conditions in culture. In primary cultures of rat cortical neurons, PlGF administration reduced cell death in an in vitro model of OGD. VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 were expressed in primary cortical neurons as measured by Western blotting. VEGFR-2 expression in primary neurons was significantly higher following PlGF administration.

Although tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) contributes to the brain damage found after cerebral ischemia, its expression and neuroprotective role in models of IPC have also been described. Regarding the role of TNF-alpha convertase (TACE/ADAM17), we have recently shown its upregulation in rat brain after IPC induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and that subsequent TNF-alpha release accounts for at least part of the neuroprotection found in this model. We have now used an in vitro model of IPC using rat cortical cultures exposed to sublethal oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) to investigate TACE expression and activity after IPC and the subsequent mechanisms of ischemic tolerance. OGD-induced cell death was significantly reduced in cells exposed to IPC by sublethal OGD 24 hr before, an effect that was inhibited by the TACE inhibitor BB3103 (1 microm) and anti-TNF-alpha antibody (2 microg/ml) and that was mimicked by TNF-alpha (10 pg/ml) preincubation. Western blot analysis showed that TACE expression is increased after IPC. IPC caused TNF-alpha release, an effect that was blocked by the selective TACE inhibitor BB-3103. In addition, IPC diminished the increase in extracellular glutamate caused by OGD and increased cellular glutamate uptake and expression of EAAT2 and EAAT3 glutamate transporters; however, only EAAT3 upregulation was mediated by increased TNF-alpha. These data demonstrate that neuroprotection induced by IPC involves upregulation of glutamate uptake partly mediated by TACE overexpression.",

Cerebral stroke is a major health issue, and vulnerability to stroke damage is regional within the brain. Thus, we set out to determine whether K(ATP) channels protect cortical neurons against ischemic insults. Experiments were performed using Kir6.2(-/-) K(ATP) channel knockout and Kir6.2(+/+) wildtype mice. We compared results obtained in Kir6.2(-/-) and wildtype mice to evaluate the protective role of K(ATP) channels against focal ischemia in vivo, and, using cortical slices, against anoxic stress in vitro. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of K(ATP) channels in the cortex of wildtype, but not Kir6.2(-/-), mice. Results from in vivo and in vitro experimental models indicate that Kir6.2-containing K(ATP) channels in the cortex provide protection from neuronal death. Briefly, in vivo focal ischemia (15 min) induced severe neurological deficits and large cortical infarcts in Kir6.2(-/-) mice, but not in wildtype mice. Imaging analyses of cortical slices exposed briefly to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) revealed a substantial number of damaged cells (propidium iodide-labeled) in the Kir6.2(-/-) OGD group, but few degenerating neurons in the wildtype OGD group, or in the wildtype and Kir6.2(-/-) control groups. Slices from the three control groups had far more surviving cells (anti-NeuN antibody-labeled) than slices from the Kir6.2(-/-) OGD group. These findings suggest that stimulation of endogenous cortical K(ATP) channels may provide a useful strategy for limiting the damage that results from cerebral ischemic stroke.",

Previous studies have indicated that oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) induces neuronal apoptosis via TRPM7. Annexin 1 and myosin IIA have been identified as TRPM7 kinase substrates; however, the role of annexin 1 in OGD/R-induced neuron apoptosis remains unclear. Here, we report that OGD/R induces nuclear translocation of annexin 1 in primary cultured neurons. Interestingly, ablation of the TRPM7 kinase or a point mutation in Ser(5) interferes with TRPM7 kinase-annexin 1 binding, decreasing annexin 1 nuclear translocation, and thereby reducing neuronal apoptosis. Furthermore, mutation of Arg(205), which intercepts annexin 1-formyl peptide receptor binding, also decreased annexin 1 nuclear translocation. Coimmunoprecipitation indicated that annexin 1 is moved as cargo through the cytoplasm by myosin IIA. However, inhibiting myosin IIA can decrease annexin 1 nuclear translocation. Moreover, blocking myosin IIA function by antagonist injection into the lateral ventricle was found to improve learning and memory in rats after middle cerebral artery occlusion and could also improve cell viability after OGD/R. Last, we determined that the annexin 1-myosin IIA complex is recognized and translocated by the importin α/β heterodimer. Therefore, TRPM7 kinase modulates OGD/R-induced neuronal apoptosis via annexin 1 carried by myosin IIA, while nuclear formyl peptide receptor (FPR)-annexin 1 binding and importin β are involved in nuclear translocation.",

Porphyrins were chosen based on conventional and unconventional criteria. Metalloporphyrin catalytic antioxidants possessing a redox-sensitive metal core can exhibit potent and wide-ranging catalytic antioxidant abilities, which are conventionally believed to underlie neuroprotection. We report here that a recent-generation potent peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst, FP-15, protected a majority of neurons against OGD and NMDA toxicity, without suppressing NMDA-mediated intracellular Ca2+ (Cai2+) elevations or whole-cell currents. We have previously shown that neuroprotection against OGD and NMDA toxicity correlated with an ability to suppress neurotoxic Cai2+ elevations and not antioxidant ability. We now evaluate if this unconventional mechanism extends to inert metal-free porphyrins. Neuron cultures were completely protected against OGD and NMDA toxicity by H2-meso-tetrakis(3-benzoic acid)porphyrin (H2-TBAP(3)) or H2-meso-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin (H2-TPPS(4)), although only H2-TPPS(4) suppressed (completely) NMDA-induced Cai2+ rises.

        "Doc_abstract":"Understanding the role of astrocytes in stroke is assuming increasing prominence, not only as an important component on its own within the neurovascular unit, but also because astrocytes can influence neuronal outcome. Ischemia may induce astrogliosis and other phenotypic changes, but these remain poorly understood, in part due to limitations in reproducing these changes in vitro. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP-differentiated cultured astrocytes are more representative of the in vivo astroglial cell phenotype, and were much more susceptible than undifferentiated astrocytes to an ischemic-like stress, oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). OGD altered the expression/distribution and activity of glial glutamate transporters, impaired cellular glutamate uptake and decreased intracellular levels of glutathione preferentially in differentiated astrocytes. Resistance to OGD was conferred by inhibiting caspase-3 with DEVD-CHO and oxidative stress by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). The resistance of undifferentiated astrocytes to OGD may result from a transient but selective morphological transformation into Alzheimer type II astrocytes, an intermediary stage prior to transforming into reactive astrocytes. Co-culture of neurons with OGD-exposed astrocytes resulted in neurotoxicity, but at surprisingly lower levels with dying differentiated astrocytes. The antioxidant NAC or the 5-LOX inhibitor AA861 added upon co-culture delayed (day 1) but did not prevent neurotoxicity (day 3). Astrocytes undergoing apoptosis as a result of ischemia may represent a transient neuroprotective mechanism via ischemia-induced release of glutathione, but oxidative stress was responsible for neuronal demise when ischemia compromised astrocyte supportive functions.

In this study, postconditioning was investigated by first exposing rat organotypic hippocampal slices to 30min oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), which promotes selective CA1 pyramidal cell death, and 5min later to either a brief period (3min) of OGD or to a low dose (10microM) of 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) for 30min. Both protocols attenuated CA1 neuronal injury, as revealed 24h later by measuring the intensity of propidium iodide fluorescence in this region. The beneficial effects were observed when DHPG postconditioning was applied up to 15min after OGD, but not at later time points, and was not additive with the neuroprotective effects of a preconditioning DHPG treatment. The attenuation of the OGD-induced CA1 injury evoked by postconditioning was prevented when mGlu1 and mGlu5 receptor antagonists and inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt activity were present in the incubation medium during the 5min recovery period after OGD and the 30min exposure to DHPG. The PI3K inhibitor was also able to prevent the reduction of NMDA toxicity induced by the DHPG treatment. Finally, DHPG increased the phosphorylation of Akt in a transient and mGlu1/mGlu5-dependent manner. Our results show that activation of the mGlu1/mGlu5-PI3K-Akt signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the mechanisms of postconditioning evoked by DHPG and point to this strategy as a possible novel therapeutic tool for stroke and cerebral ischemia.",

Our results demonstrate a limited number of large sites and numerous smaller sites of FGFR1 in the nuclear interior. The larger sites showed virtually complete colocalization (>90%) with splicing factor rich nuclear speckles while the smaller sites showed very limited overlap (<20%). Similar results were found for several other proliferating cell lines grown in culture. An in situ transcription assay was used to determine colocalization with transcription sites by incorporating 5-bromouridine triphosphate (BrUTP) followed by dual staining for BrUTP and FGFR1. These results combined with those from using an antibody against the large subunit of RNA polymerase II suggest a significant degree of colocalization (26-38%) over both the large and small sites. No colocalization was detected with sites of DNA replication. The spatial arrangements of FGFR1 sites and colocalization with nuclear speckles were maintained following extraction for nuclear matrix. Moreover, immunoblots indicated a significant enrichment of FGFR1 in the nuclear matrix fraction. Our findings suggest an involvement of a nuclear matrix bound FGFR1 in transcriptional and RNA processing events in the cell nucleus.

We show that Cre-mediated deletion of Fgfr1 in limb mesenchyme, beginning at a time point slightly after the first sign of initial budding, primarily affects formation of the first one or two digits. In contrast, deletion of Fgfr1 at an earlier stage, prior to thickening of limb mesenchyme, results in more severe defects, characterized by malformation of the AER, diminished Shh expression and the absence of the majority of the autopod skeletal elements. We show that FGFR1 deficiency does not affect cell proliferation. Instead, it triggers cell death and leads to alterations in expression of a number of genes involved in apoptosis and digit patterning, including increased expression of Bmp4, Dkk1 and Alx4, and downregulation of MKP3.

In this study, we investigated the differential contribution of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) isoforms to the regulation of hypoxic EPO expression in cultured astrocytes. In addition, using an in vitro model of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), we studied the role of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha in the generation of paracrine protective signals by astrocytes that modulate the survival of neurons exposed to OGD. Expression of HIF-1alpha or HIF-2alpha was abrogated by infecting astrocytes with lentiviral particles encoding small interference RNA specific for HIF-1alpha or HIF-2alpha (siHIF-1alpha or siHIF-2alpha). Astrocytes infected with siHIF-1alpha showed abrogated hypoxic induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) but normal EPO induction. In contrast, reduction of HIF-2alpha expression by siHIF-2alpha led to a drastic decrease of EPO hypoxic expression, but it did not affect LDH or VEGF upregulation. To further test whether HIF-2 is sufficient to drive EPO upregulation, we expressed oxygen-insensitive mutant forms of HIF-1alpha (mtHIF-1alpha) (P402A/P577A) and HIF-2alpha (mtHIF-2alpha) (P405A/P530A). Expression of mtHIF-2alpha but not mtHIF-1alpha in normoxic astrocytes resulted in a significant upregulation of EPO mRNA and protein. Accordingly, HIF-2alpha but not HIF-1alpha was found to be associated with the EPO hypoxia-response element by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Interestingly, conditioned medium from astrocytes challenged by sublethal OGD improved neuronal survival to OGD; however, this effect was abolished during the downregulation of astrocytic HIF-2alpha using siHIF-2alpha. These results indicate that HIF-2alpha mediates the transcriptional activation of EPO expression in astrocytes, and this pathway may promote astrocytic paracrine-dependent neuronal survival during ischemia.",

In situ hybridization using [35S]-labeled riboprobe demonstrated distinct autoradiographic signals for FGF-2 mRNA in glandular epithelial and stromal cells in endometrium throughout the menstrual cycle, with the strongest hybridization signal in stromal cells of the proliferative endometrium relative to that of the secretory endometrium. Moreover, RNAse protection assay revealed that the mRNA encoding FGF-2 and FGF-R1 was significantly higher in proliferative than in secretory endometrium (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). Immunohistochemistry using anti-flg antibody showed that the intensity of FGF-R1 staining was markedly diminished in the stromal cells of secretory endometrium, which corresponded with the reduced FGF-2 mRNA expression. In contrast, the endometrial glandular epithelial cells showed intense localization of FGF-R1 protein throughout the menstrual cycle, which paralleled FGF-2 mRNA expression. Colocalization of FGF-2 and FGF-R1 in stroma and stimulation of DNA synthesis and phospholipase C activation by FGF-2 in these cells demonstrates that FGF-2 acts in an autocrine manner in endometrial stroma.

ATP has been shown to be released by astrocytes in response to a number of stimuli under nonischemic conditions. In this study, using a luciferin-luciferase assay, we found that mouse astrocytes in primary culture also exhibit massive release of ATP in response to ischemic stress mimicked by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). Using a biosensor technique, the local ATP concentration at the surface of single astrocytes was found to increase to around 4 muM. The OGD-induced ATP release was inhibited by Gd(3+) and arachidonic acid but not by blockers of volume-sensitive outwardly rectifying Cl(-) channels, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), multidrug resistance-related protein (MRP), connexin or pannexin hemichannels, P2X(7) receptors, and exocytotic vesicular transport. In cell-attached patches on single astrocytes, OGD caused activation of maxi-anion channels that were sensitive to Gd(3+) and arachidonic acid. The channel was found to be permeable to ATP(4-) with a permeability ratio of P(ATP)/P(Cl) = 0.11. Thus, it is concluded that ischemic stress induces ATP release from astrocytes and that the maxi-anion channel may serve as a major ATP-releasing pathway under ischemic conditions.",

We therefore sought to determine whether changes in alternative splicing of FGF receptors occur in human prostate cancer.;RNAs from normal prostate and clinically localized or metastatic prostate cancers were analyzed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by digestion of products with restriction enzymes specific for each FGF receptor isoform and quantitation of the relative amounts of each isoform after electrophoresis. For FGFR-2, this was correlated with immunohistochemistry to determine the localization of the protein product.;FGFR-1 is expressed exclusively as the IIIc isoform in prostate cancer while FGFR-3 is expressed predominantly as the IIIb isoform, similar to the expression pattern in normal prostatic epithelial cells. In contrast, there was variable expression of the FGFR-2 IIIb and IIIc isoforms. In the majority of cases the FGFR-2 IIIb isoform was the predominant or exclusive isoform expressed, similar to normal epithelial cells, but in a subset of cases the IIIc isoform was increased, indicating a change in alternative splicing of FGFR-2 in some cases.;In most cases of prostate cancer there are no changes in alternative splicing of FGF receptors, but in a subgroup there is increased expression of the FGFR-2 IIIc isoform.

The dynamic agonist modulation of the FGFR1-5-HT1A heteroreceptor complexes and their recruitment of β-arrestin is now determined in cellular models with focus on its impact on 5-HT1AR and FGFR1 homodimerization in the heteroreceptor complexes based on BRET(2) assays. The findings show that coagonist treatment with 8-OH-DPAT and FGF2 but not treatment with the 5-HT1A agonist alone markedly increases the BRETmax values and significantly reduces the BRET50 values of 5HT1A homodimerization. The effects of FGF2 or FGF20 with or without the 5-HT1A agonist were also studied on the FGFR1 homodimerization of the heteroreceptor complexes. FGF2 produced a marked and rapid increase in FGFR1 homodimerization which partially declined over a 10min period. Cotreatment with FGF2 and 5-HT1A agonist blocked this decline in FGFR1 homodimerization.

In gerbils, direct application of KYNA (100 nM, through reverse microdialysis in the hippocampus) completely prevented the increase in Glu output induced by transient (5 min) occlusion of the carotids.

Polymorphonuclear neutrophils significantly increased BBB permeability under OGD conditions via proteolysis of extracellular matrix proteins. This was associated with PMN degranulation.

Whilst this deprives brain tissue of a valuable energy source, the concomitant production of adenosine mitigates the damaging effects of energy failure by suppressing neuronal activity. However, the production of adenosine and other metabolites, and their loss across the blood-brain barrier, deprives the brain of substrates for the purine salvage pathway, the primary means by which the brain makes ATP. Because of this, cerebral ATP levels remain depressed after brain injury. To test whether manipulating cellular ATP levels in brain tissue could affect functional neuronal outcomes in response to oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD), we examined the effects of creatine and d-ribose and adenine (RibAde). In hippocampal slices creatine delayed ATP breakdown, reduced adenosine release, retarded both the depression of synaptic transmission and the anoxic depolarization caused by OGD, and improved the recovery of transmission. In contrast, RibAde increased cellular ATP, caused increased OGD-induced adenosine release and accelerated the depression of synaptic transmission, but did not improve functional recovery. However, RibAde improved the viability of cerebellar granule cells when administered after OGD. Our data indicate that RibAde may be effective in promoting recovery of brain tissue after injury, potentially via enhancement of salvage-mediated ATP production. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Ligand-induced dimerization and transphosphorylation are thought to be important events by which receptor tyrosine kinases generate cellular signals. We have investigated the ability of signalling-defective, truncated fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors (FGFR-1 and FGFR-2) to block the FGF response in cells that express both types of endogenous FGF receptors. When these dominant negative receptors are expressed in NIH 3T3 cells transformed by the secreted FGF-4, the transformed properties of the cells can be reverted to various degrees, with better reversion phenotype correlating with higher levels of truncated receptor expression. Furthermore, truncated FGFR-2 is significantly more efficient at producing reversion than FGFR-1, indicating that FGF-4 preferentially utilizes the FGFR-2 signalling pathway. NIH 3T3 clones expressing these truncated receptors are more resistant to FGF-induced mitogenesis and also exhibit reduced tyrosine phosphorylation upon treatment with FGF. The block in FGF-signalling, however, can be overcome by the addition of excess growth factor. The truncated receptors have binding affinities that are four- to eightfold lower than those of wild-type receptors, as measured by Scatchard analysis. We also observed a partial specificity in the responses of truncated-receptor-expressing clones to FGF-2 or FGF-4. Our results suggest that the block to signal transduction produced by kinase-negative FGF receptors is achieved through a combination of dominant negative effects and competition for growth factor binding with functional receptors.",

Without high phosphotransfer specificity between cognate HKs and RRs, cross-phosphorylation or cross-talk between different TCSs may occur and diminish responses to appropriate stimuli. Some mechanisms to reduce cross-talk involve HKs controlling levels of cognate RR phosphorylation. Conceivably, some RRs may have evolved HK-independent strategies to insulate themselves from cross-talk with acetyl phosphate (AcP) or other small phosphodonor metabolites. Initial steps in flagellar biosynthesis in Campylobacter jejuni stimulate phosphotransfer from the FlgS HK to the FlgR RR to promote σ(54)-dependent flagellar gene expression. We discovered that the FlgR C-terminal domain (CTD), which commonly functions as a DNA-binding domain in the NtrC RR family, is a specificity determinant to limit in vivo cross-talk from AcP. FlgR lacking the CTD (FlgR(ΔCTD)) used FlgS or AcP as an in vivo phosphodonor and could be reprogrammed in ΔflgS mutants to respond to cellular nutritional status via AcP levels. Even though exclusive AcP-mediated activation of FlgR(ΔCTD) promoted WT flagellar gene expression, proper flagellar biosynthesis was impaired. We propose that the FlgR CTD prevents phosphotransfer from AcP so that FlgR is solely responsive to FlgS to promote proper flagellar gene expression and flagellation. In addition to mechanisms limiting cross-talk between noncognate HKs and RRs, our work suggests that RRs can possess domains that prevent in vivo cross-talk between RRs and the endogenous metabolite AcP to ensure signaling specificity.",

Among the various integrin-centered signaling pathways discovered so far, we demonstrated that the modulation of the electrical potential of the plasma membrane (V(REST)) is an early integrin-mediated signal, which is related to neurite emission in neuroblastoma cells. This modulation is sustained by the activation of HERG K(+) channels, encoded by the ether-à-go-go-related gene (herg). The involvement of integrin-mediated signaling is being discovered in the hemopoietic system: in particular, osteoclasts are generated as well as induced to differentiate by interaction of osteoclast progenitors with the stromal cells, through the involvement of integrin receptors. We studied the effects of cell interaction with the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin (FN) in a human leukemic preosteoclastic cell line (FLG 29.1 cells), which has been demonstrated to express HERG currents. We report here that FLG 29.1 cells indeed adhere to purified FN through integrin receptors, and that this adhesion induces an osteoclast phenotype in these cells, as evidenced by the appearance of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, as well as by the increased expression of CD51/alpha(v)beta(3) integrin and calcitonin receptor. An early activation of HERG current (I(HERG)), without any increase in herg RNA or modifications of HERG protein was also observed in FN-adhering cells. This activation is apparently sustained by the beta(1) integrin subunit activation, through the involvement of a pertussis-toxin sensitive G(i) protein, and appears to be a determinant signal for the up-regulation of alpha(v)beta(3) integrin, as well as for the increased expression of calcitonin receptor.",

As an alternative, we expressed structural subdomains and isoforms of the flg receptor gene in bacteria and baculoviral-infected insect cells. We developed and characterized a panel of 16 isoform and domain-specific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. The panel of antibodies was used to distinguish mature glycosylated ligand-binding and kinase-active and -inactive recombinant isoforms in baculoviral insect cells and transfected mammalian cells and natural isoforms in rat prostate and human liver cells. The results revealed a cell type-specific expression of the flg gene and isoforms that result from combinations of splice variations. Reactive epitopes of monoclonal antibodies against both the three (alpha) and two (beta) immunoglobulin-like disulfide loop extracellular domain isoforms were mapped by cross-reactivity with synthetic polypeptide sequences and deletion mutants expressed in bacteria. The native alpha and beta receptor isoforms differed in display of shared epitopes and suggested that the NH2-terminal Loop I and COOH-terminal Loops II and III of the alpha isoform are interactive. Although the common Loops II and III appear qualitatively sufficient for ligand binding, the results suggest that tertiary relationships among loops in the three and two loop isoforms are distinct and, therefore, the two isoforms may have distinct activities.

It was preferentially effective in FGFR-activated cancer cells, including bladder cancer cell lines expressing FGFR3-TACC3 fusion proteins (RT-112, RT-4). MPT0L145 decreased the phosphorylation of FGFR1, FGFR3 and their downstream proteins (FRS2, ERK and Akt). Mechanistically, cDNA microarray analysis revealed that MPT0L145 decreased genes associated cell cycle progression, and increased genes associated with autophagy pathway. Accordingly, the data revealed that MPT0L145 induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and decreased protein levels of cyclin E. Moreover, we provided the evidence that autophagy contributes to FGFR inhibitor-related cell death. Finally, MPT0L145 exhibited comparable antitumor activity to cisplatin with better safety in a RT-112 xenograft model.

Adult rat optic nerves were exposed to 60 min of either anoxia or OGD. Compound action potential area recovered to 22+/-6% of control after 60 min of anoxia, and to 4+/-1% after 60 min of OGD. Ca(2+)-free (+EGTA) perfusate allowed complete recovery after OGD (108+/-42%). Tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 microM) was less protective (45+/-6%). Both anoxia and OGD induced breakdown of neurofilament 160 (NF160) and NF200 revealed by the appearance of multiple lower molecular weight bands mainly in the 75-100 kDa range. Zero-Ca(2+)/EGTA completely prevented NF breakdown. TTX only partially reduced NF160 degradation. Non-phosphorylated NF200 appeared after reperfusion post-anoxia or OGD, and was also greatly reduced by zero-Ca(2+) or TTX. Calpain inhibitors (10 microM calpain inhibitor I or 50 microM MDL 28,170) significantly reduced NF160 and NF200 breakdown/dephosphorylation, but did not improve electrophysiological recovery. Significant calpain-mediated breakdown of NF160 and NF200 indicates structural damage to the axonal cytoskeleton, which was completely Ca(2+)-dependent. While pharmacological inhibition of calpain alone greatly reduced NF proteolysis, there was no concomitant improvement in function.

Here we show that in tumor cells MT1-MMP downregulates fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) signaling by reducing the amount of FGF-2 bound to the cell surface with high and low affinity. FGF-2 induces weaker activation of ERK1/2 MAP kinase in MT1-MMP expressing cells than in cells devoid of MT1-MMP. This effect is abolished in cells that express proteolytically inactive MT1-MMP but persists in cells expressing MT1-MMP mutants devoid of hemopexin-like or cytoplasmic domain, showing that FGF-2 signaling is downregulated by MT1-MMP proteolytic activity. MT1-MMP expression results in downregulation of FGFR-1 and -4, and in decreased amount of cell surface-associated FGF-2. In addition, MT1-MMP strongly reduces the amount of FGF-2 bound to the cell surface with low affinity. Because FGF-2 association with low-affinity binding sites is a prerequisite for binding to its high-affinity receptors, downregulation of low-affinity binding to the cell surface results in decreased FGF-2 signaling. Consistent with this conclusion, FGF-2 induction of tumor cell migration and invasion in vitro is stronger in cells devoid of MT1- MMP than in MT1-MMP expressing cells. Thus, MT1-MMP controls FGF-2 signaling by a proteolytic mechanism that decreases the cell's biological response to FGF-2.",

However, significant reductions in thromboembolism and intracerebral hemorrhage have been shown with the antithrombin dabigatran compared with warfarin. As thrombin has been implicated in microvessel injury during cerebral ischemia, we hypothesized that dabigatran decreases the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage by direct inhibition of the thrombin-mediated increase in cerebral endothelial cell permeability. Primary murine brain endothelial cells (mBECs) were exposed to murine thrombin before measuring permeability to 4-kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran. Thrombin increased mBEC permeability in a concentration-dependent manner, without significant endothelial cell death. Pretreatment of mBECs with dabigatran completely abrogated the effect of thrombin on permeability. Neither the expressions of the endothelial cell β1-integrins nor the tight junction protein claudin-5 were affected by thrombin exposure. Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) also increased permeability; this effect was abrogated by treatment with dabigatran, as was the additive effect of thrombin and OGD on permeability. Taken together, these results indicate that dabigatran could contribute to a lower risk of intracerebral hemorrhage during embolism-associated ischemia from AF by protection of the microvessel permeability barrier from local thrombin challenge.

Using these cells, we conducted high-throughput screening of chemicals and identified a specific kinase inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) that acted in a stage-dependent manner to promote the terminal differentiation of pancreatic endocrine cells, including β cells, from the intermediate stage of pancreatic endocrine progenitors while blocking the early development of pancreatic progenitors. This FGFR1 inhibitor augmented the expression of functional β cell markers (SLC30A8 and ABCC8) and improved glucose-stimulated INS secretion.

Rubia cordifolia (RC), Fagonia cretica linn (FC) and Tinospora cordifolia (TC) have been reported to contain a wide variety of antioxidants and have been in use in the eastern system of medicine for various disorders. However, their mechanism of action was largely unknown. We therefore selected these herbs for the present study to test their neuroprotective ability and the associated mechanism in rat hippocampal slices subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD).;Hippocampal Slices were subjected to OGD (oxygen glucose deprivation) and divided into 3 groups: control, OGD and OGD + drug treated. Cytosolic Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu-Zn SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), nitric oxide (NO) was measured as nitrite (NO2) in the supernatant and protein assays were performed in the respective groups at various time intervals. EPR was used to establish the antioxidant effect of RC, FC and TC with respect to superoxide anion (O2.-), hydroxyl radicals (. OH), nitric oxide (NO) radical and peroxynitrite anion (ONOO) generated from pyrogallol, menadione, DETA-NO and Sin-1 respectively. RT-PCR was performed for the three groups for GCLC, iNOS, Cu-Zn SOD and GAPDH gene expression.;All the three herbs were effective in elevating the GSH levels, expression of the gamma-glutamylcysteine ligase and Cu-Zn SOD genes. The herbs also exhibited strong free radical scavenging properties against reactive oxygen and nitrogen species as studied by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. In addition all the three herbs significantly diminished the expression of iNOS gene after 48 hours which plays a major role in neuronal injury during hypoxia/ischemia.;RC, FC and TC therefore attenuate oxidative stress mediated cell injury during OGD and exert the above effects at both the cytosolic as well as at gene expression level and may be an effective therapeutic tool against ischemic brain damage.",

        "Doc_abstract":"During ischaemia neurons depolarize and release the neurotransmitter L-glutamate, which accumulates extracellularly and binds to postsynaptic receptors. This initiates a sequence of events thought to culminate in immediate and delayed neuronal death. However, there is growing evidence that during ischaemia the development of spreading depression (SD) can be an important determinant of the degree and extent of ischaemic damage. In contrast, SD without metabolic compromise (as occurs in migraine aura) causes no discernible damage to brain tissue. SD is a profound depolarization of neurons and glia that propagates like a wave across brain tissue. Brain cell swelling, an early event of both the excitotoxic process and of SD, can be assessed by imaging associated intrinsic optical signals (IOSs). We demonstrate here that IOS imaging clearly demarcates the ignition site and migration of SD across the submerged hippocampal slice of the rat. If SD is induced by elevating [K+]O, the tissue fully recovers, but in slices that are metabolically compromised at 37.5 degrees C by oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD) or by ouabain exposure, cellular damage develops only where SD has propagated. Specifically, the evoked CA1 field potential is permanently lost, the cell bodies of involved neurons swell and their dendritic regions increase in opacity. In contrast to OGD, bath application of L-glutamate (6-10 mM) at 37.5 degrees C evokes a non-propagating LT increase in CA1 that reverses without obvious cellular damage. Moreover, application of 2-20 mM glutamate or various glutamate agonists fail to evoke SD in the submerged hippocampal slice. We propose that SD and OGD together (but not alone) constitute a 'one-two punch', causing acute neuronal death in the slice that is not replicated by elevated glutamate. These findings support the proposal that SD generation during stroke promotes and extends acute ischaemic damage.",

In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms associated with the MUC4-induced invasion and metastasis in pancreatic cancer. Stable silencing of MUC4 in multiple pancreatic cancer cells resulted in the downregulation of N-cadherin and its interacting partner fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) through downregulation of partly by pFAK, pMKK7, pJNK and pc-Jun pathway and partly through PI-3K/Akt pathway. The downregulation of FGFR1 in turn led to downregulation of pAkt, pERK1/2, pNF-κB, pIkBα, uPA, MMP-9, vimentin, N-cadherin, Twist, Slug and Zeb1 and upregulation of E-cadherin, Occludin, Cytokeratin-18 and Caspase-9 in MUC4 knockdown BXPC3 and Capan1 cells compared with scramble vector transfected cells. Further, downregulation of FGFR1 was associated with a significant change in morphology and reorganization of the actin-cytoskeleton, leading to a significant decrease in motility (P < 0.00001) and invasion (P < 0.0001) in vitro and decreased tumorigenicity and incidence of metastasis in vivo upon orthotopic implantation in the athymic mice.

Increasing evidences further indicate combined BMSCs with certain agent such as simvastatin may have improved therapeutic effect. Sodium Ferulate (SF) and n-butylidenephthalide (BP), two main components of Radix Angelica Sinensis, are proved to be the important regulators of stem cells in cell migration, differentiation and pluripotency maintenance. This study aimed to investigate whether combined BMSCs with SF and BP had better therapeutic effect in the treatment of stroke, and also the underlying molecular basis. The results showed that combination treatment notably reduced neurological injury after stroke and increased the expression of astrocyte-derived vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and von Willebrand factor-positive vascular density in ischemic boundary zone as evaluated by immunofluorescence staining. After treatment of BMSCs plus SF and BP, astrocytes showed increased expression of VEGF and BDNF by up-regulating AKT/ mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) expression in oxygen-glucose deprived (OGD) environment. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) incubated with the conditional medium (CM) derived from OGD astrocytes treated with BMSCs plus SF and BP showed significantly increased migration and tube formation compared with those incubated with the CM derived from OGD astrocytes treated with BMSC alone. These results demonstrate that combination treatment enhances the expression of astrocyte-derived VEGF and BDNF which contribute to angiogenesis after cerebral ischemia, and the underlying mechanism is associated with activation of astrocytic AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.

CA1 pyramidal cells are selectively vulnerable to ischemia and die one to 3 days after 10 min of ischemia. In these cells, bFGF mRNA was induced by 6 hours, reached a maximal level by 24 h after ischemia, and subsequently decreased. Message for the FGF receptor, flg, was present in the pyramidal cells layer, and vanished almost completely in parallel with neuronal death. In the granule cell layer of dentate gyrus, the expression of bFGF mRNA increased more rapidly. It was maximal by 6 h and returned to the basal level by 3 days. In the hilus of the dentate gyrus, bFGF expression was maximal at 24 h and returned to control levels by 3 days. Despite the rapid changes in expression of bFGF mRNA, there was no significant change of bFGF immunoreactivity in either the CA1 pyramidal cell layer or in the granule cell layer of dentate gyrus within 3 days after ischemia. The apparent failure of the message to be efficiently translated supports the idea that translation is impaired under conditions where ischemia leads to delayed neuronal cell death. Expression of bFGF mRNA, FGFR mRNA and bFGF immunoreactivity increased dramatically in a broad area of CA1 subfield from 7 days until 30 days after ischemia because of increased expression by reactive glial cells.

Glomerular endothelial cells were exposed to 8-h oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by 4- and 8-h reoxygenation-glucose repletion. After 4-h reoxygenation-glucose repletion, transendothelial permeability to Ficoll-70 was reduced, and transendothelial resistance increased, by 17β-estradiol vs. vehicle treatment during OGD (OGD-vehicle: 91.0 ± 11.8%, OGD-estrogen: 102.6 ± 10.8%, P < 0.05). This effect was reversed by coadministration of G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30) antagonist G15 with 17β-estradiol (OGD-estrogen-G15: 89.5 ± 6.9, P < 0.05 compared with 17β-estradiol). To provide preliminary confirmation of this result in vivo, Ficoll-70 was administered to mice 24 h after cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR).

        "Doc_abstract":"Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion is known to activate endogenous neural stem/progenitor cell (NS/PC) proliferation, but the mechanisms leading to NS/PC proliferation remain unknown. Astrocytes are vital components of the neurogenic niche and play a crucial role in regulating NS/PC proliferation and differentiation. After focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), astrocytes release a damage-associated molecular-pattern molecule called high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). Since HMGB1 is critical for NS/PC proliferation during brain development, we modeled I/R using glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) in vitro and examined the effect of HMGB1 released by astrocytes on NS/PC proliferation. Further, we determined the role of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in this process. Using conditioned media from OGD/R astrocytes with or without RNA interference for HMGB1, as well as with anti-HMGB1 antibodies, we evaluated the effect of astrocyte-derived HMGB1 on NS/PC proliferation. Using the potent PI3K/Akt inhibitor, LY294002, we explored the likely mechanism of HMGB1-induced NS/PC proliferation. OGD/R astrocyte-conditioned media (ACM) increased NS/PC proliferation, and HMGB1 RNA interference prevented this effect. Using an HMGB1 neutralizing antibody in OGD/R ACM also abrogated NS/PC proliferation. LY294002 effectively reduced phospho-Akt levels and reduced NS/PC proliferation induced by HMGB1 in vitro. Our data demonstrate that HMGB1 released by OGD/R astrocytes promotes NS/PC proliferation through activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Local HMGB1 release may induce endogenous NS/PC to proliferate following cerebral I/R and suggests that HMGB1 may play a pivotal role in brain tissue repair after an ischemic event. ",

Stress-associated molecules typically linked to Parkinson's disease such as the mitochondrial kinase, PTEN-inducible putative kinase 1 (PINK1), and another E3 ligase, Parkin, are upregulated in brains from CHIP knockout (KO) animals. Utilizing a novel biotin-avidin capture technique, we found that the oxidation status of Parkin and the mitochondrial fission protein, dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), are altered in a CHIP-dependent manner. We also found that following oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), the expression of CHIP, PINK1, and the autophagic marker, LC3, increase and there is activation of the redox-sensitive kinase p66(shc). Under conditions of OGD, CHIP relocalizes from the cytosol to mitochondria. Mitochondria from CHIP KO mice have profound impairments in stress response induced by calcium overload, resulting in accelerated permeability transition activity. While CHIP-deficient neurons are morphologically intact, they are more susceptible to OGD consistent with a previously unknown neuroprotective role for CHIP in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis.;CHIP relocalization to the mitochondria is essential for the regulation of mitochondrial integrity and neuronal survival following OGD.;CHIP is an essential regulator of neuronal bioenergetics and redox tone. Altering the expression of this protein has profound effects on neuronal survival when cells are exposed to OGD.",

However, the role of this exchanger in excitotoxicity and ischemia-induced neuronal injury is still controversial and has never been studied in the same neuronal subtypes.;We investigated the effects of bepridil and 3',4'-dichlorobenzamil (DCB), 2 blockers of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger, in rat striatal spiny neurons by utilizing intracellular recordings in brain slice preparations to compare the action of these drugs on the membrane potential changes induced either by oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) or by excitatory amino acids (EAAs).;Bepridil (3 to 100 micromol/L) and DCB (3 to 100 micromol/L) caused a dose-dependent enhancement of the OGD-induced depolarization measured in striatal neurons. The EC(50) values for these effects were 31 micromol/L and 29 micromol/L, respectively. At these concentrations neither bepridil nor DCB altered the resting membrane properties of the recorded cells (membrane potential, input resistance, and current-voltage relationship). The effects of bepridil and DCB on the OGD-induced membrane depolarization persisted in the presence of D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (50 micromol/L) plus 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (20 micromol/L), which suggests that they were not mediated by an enhanced release of EAAs. Neither tetrodotoxin (1 micromol/L) nor nifedipine (10 micromol/L) affect the actions of these 2 blockers of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger, which indicates that voltage-dependent Na(+) channels and L-type Ca(2+) channels were not involved in the enhancement of the OGD-induced depolarization. Conversely, the OGD-induced membrane depolarization was not altered by 5-(N, N-hexamethylene) amiloride (1 to 3 micromol/L), an inhibitor of the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger, which suggests that this antiporter did not play a prominent role in the OGD-induced membrane depolarization recorded from striatal neurons. Bepridil (3 to 100 micromol/L) and DCB (3 to 100 micromol/L) did not modify the amplitude of the excitatory postsynaptic potentials evoked by cortical stimulation. Moreover, these blockers did not affect membrane depolarizations caused by brief applications of glutamate (0.3 to 1 mmol/L), AMPA (0. 3 to 1 micromol/L), and NMDA (10 to 30 micromol/L).;These results provide pharmacological evidence that the activation of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger exerts a protective role during the early phase of OGD in striatal neurons, although it does not shape the amplitude and the duration of the electrophysiological responses of these cells to EAA.",

However, the exact mechanisms of action of Srxn1 in cerebral ischemia have not yet been fully elucidated. Therefore, in the present study, rat primary cortical astrocytes transfected with a lentiviral vector encoding short hairpin RNA (shRNA) were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) for 4 h or to 100 µM hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for 6 h, in order to construct an in vitro model of cerebral ischemia-induced damage. We found that following exposure to OGD or H2O2, the knockdown of Srxn1 resulted in a decrease in cell viability, as shown by MTS assay, an increase in cell damage, as shown by lactate dehydrogenase assay and an increase in cellular apoptosis, as shown by Hoechst 33342 staining and flow cytometry. Furthermore, we found that following exposure to OGD or H2O2, the knockdown of Srxn1 resulted in a decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δψm) as indicated by JC-1 staining, an increase in the cytoplasmic expression of cytochrome c (Cyt.C), caspase-3, caspase-9, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and Bax protein at the protein level, but a decrease in the expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein; these effects were tightly associated with the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. However, we found that there was no obvious change in the intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) levels and caspase-12 expression following the knockdown of Srxn1. Taken together, the results from the present study demonstrate that Srxn1 protects primary rat cortical astrocytes from OGD- or H2O2-induced apoptosis and that involves the activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, which suggests that Srxn1 may be a potential target in the treatment of cerebral ischemia.",

However, the exact interrelation between the postischemic time delay and the degree of mild hypothermia by which to achieve neuroprotective effects on ischemic insults of different severity has not yet been elucidated systematically. To determine optimal neuroprotection, we studied the interaction between these variables in a recently modified hippocampal slice model.;We investigated the recovery of energy metabolism and protein synthesis (PSR) in hippocampal slices from mature fetal guinea pigs after 20, 30, or 40 minutes of oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). Hypothermia of varying degrees was induced immediately or 2 or 4 hours after OGD and lasted for 12 hours. Prolonged inhibition of PSR after ischemia has been shown to be a sensitive marker of neuronal cell damage.;Hypothermia initiated immediately after OGD significantly improved the recovery of energy metabolism and PSR. If there was a 2-hour delay in the onset of hypothermia, neuroprotection depended on the degree of hypothermia. Reduction of the incubation temperature to 31C diminished the disturbances of energy metabolism and PSR, whereas lowering the bath temperature to only 34C was not effective. Hypothermia induced 4 hours after OGD did not have any influence on the recovery of energy metabolism and PSR.;We conclude that the effects of mild hypothermia on metabolic disturbances in hippocampal slices of mature fetal guinea pigs depended on the intervention delay and the degree of cooling. The shorter the postischemic intervention delay and the greater the degree of hypothermia, the better the neuroprotective effect seems to be.",

This DNA complex (GS24-NFκB) contains a DNA decoy which inhibits NF-κB activity, and a DNA aptamer (GS-24), a ligand of transferrin receptor (TfR), which allows for targeted delivery of the DNA decoy into cells. The results indicate that GS24-NFκB was successfully delivered into a murine brain-derived endothelial cell line, bEND5, and inhibited inflammatory responses induced by tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) or oxygen-glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation (OGD/R) via down-regulation of the nuclear NF-κB subunit, p65, as well as its downstream inflammatory cytokines, inter-cellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1). The inhibitory effect of the GS24-NFκB was demonstrated by a significant reduction in TNF-α or OGD/R induced monocyte adhesion to the bEND5 cells after GS24-NFκB treatment. Intravenous (i.v.) injection of GS24-'NFκB (15mg/kg) was able to inhibit the levels of phoseph-p65 and VCAM-1 in brain endothelial cells in a mouse lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory model in vivo.

The supernatant of concanavalin A-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (conditioned medium) generated Langhans type-MGC and foreign body type-MGC from monocytes. Conditioned medium from any three groups had the same ability to form MGC from normal monocytes. On the other hand, MGC were more highly formed using monocytes from sarcoidosis patients than from other groups. When macrophages induced by treatment of monocytes with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) were used, the rate of MGC formation in sarcoidosis patients was about threefold or fourfold as much as that in OGD patients or healthy controls, respectively. Oxidized ATP inhibited MGC formation in all groups. The susceptibility of monocytes cultured in conditioned medium for 24 h to 2'- and 3'-o-(4-benzoyl-benzoyl)ATP-mediated cytolysis was significantly higher in sarcoidosis patients than other groups.

ENMD-2076 inhibited the growth in vitro of a wide range of human solid tumor and hematopoietic cancer cell lines with IC(50) values ranging from 0.025 to 0.7 μmol/L. ENMD-2076 was also shown to induce regression or complete inhibition of tumor growth in vivo at well-tolerated doses in tumor xenograft models derived from breast, colon, melanoma, leukemia, and multiple myeloma cell lines. Pharmacodynamic experiments in vivo showed that in addition to inhibiting Aurora A, single doses of ENMD-2076 had sustained inhibitory effects on the activation of Flt3 as well as the angiogenic tyrosine kinases, VEGFR2/KDR and FGFR1 and 2. ENMD-2076 was shown to prevent the formation of new blood vessels and regress formed vessels in vivo at doses equivalent to those that gave substantial activity in tumor xenograft models.

Cells predominantly of the 'contractile' phenotype expressed low numbers of high affinity EGF and bFGF receptors (EGFr: 1.09 +/- 0.18 fmol/10(6) cells; bFGFr: 0.32 +/- 0.07 fmol/10(6) cells). Upon modulation from the 'contractile' phenotype, the expression of these cell surface receptors increased greatly: 8- and 11-fold with respect to EGF and bFGF receptors. Cell surface receptors binding [125I]-PDGF-BB were largely unaltered. The elevated bFGF receptor number appeared dependent on SMC modulation from the 'contractile' phenotype and serum; the latter factor did not influence EGF receptor numbers. In both instances the increase in receptor numbers was independent of the proliferation status of the cells. Cells expressing high levels of the growth factor receptors also rapidly entered the cell cycle, proliferated, and exhibited growth factor-specific changes in shape in the presence of these growth factors. Because the effects on growth factor receptor numbers were observed in confluent cells, such alterations, are likely to play a significant role in vessel remodelling following balloon catheter angioplasty, in atherosclerotic vessels and the vascular hypertrophy associated with hypertension.",

Current models typically rely on a single stress episode to induce neuroprotection whereas the clinical reality is that patients may experience multiple transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) prior to suffering a stroke. We sought to develop a neuron-enriched preconditioning model using multiple oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) episodes to assess the endogenous protective mechanisms neurons implement at the metabolic and cellular level. We found that neurons exposed to a five minute period of glucose deprivation recovered oxygen utilization and lactate production using novel microphysiometry techniques. Using the non-toxic and energetically favorable five minute exposure, we developed a preconditioning paradigm where neurons are exposed to this brief OGD for three consecutive days. These cells experienced a 45% greater survival following an otherwise lethal event and exhibited a longer lasting window of protection in comparison to our previous in vitro preconditioning model using a single stress. As in other models, preconditioned cells exhibited mild caspase activation, an increase in oxidized proteins and a requirement for reactive oxygen species for neuroprotection. Heat shock protein 70 was upregulated during preconditioning, yet the majority of this protein was released extracellularly. We believe coupling this neuron-enriched multi-day model with microphysiometry will allow us to assess neuronal specific real-time metabolic adaptations necessary for preconditioning.",

Ischemia induces significant alterations in cellular redox status that plays a critical role in cell survival/death pathways. We investigated the effects of Hsp70 overexpression on cellular redox status in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells under both hypoxic and ischemic conditions with 3 different approaches: reactive oxygen species (ROS) measurement by a fluorescence probe, redox environment evaluation by a hydroxylamine spin probe, and redox status assessment by the glutathione/glutathione disulfide (GSH/GSSG) ratio. Results from each of these approaches showed that the redox status in Hsp70 cells was more reducing than that in control cells under either hypoxic or oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) conditions. In order to determine the mechanisms that mediated the alterations in redox state in Hsp70 cells, we measured the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR), two GSH-related antioxidant enzymes. We found that OGD exposure increased GPx and GR activities 47% and 55% from their basal levels (no stress) in Hsp70 cells, compared to only 18% and 0% increase in control cells, respectively.

Primary mouse astrocyte cultures were infected with an HDJ-2 encoding retroviral vector or control retrovirus lacking HDJ-2. Expression of HDJ-2 was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining and immunoblotting. Injury paradigms to mimic ischemia were glucose deprivation (GD) for 24 hours and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) for 8 hours. Cell death was determined by trypan blue exclusion and cell counting. Overexpression of HDJ-2 alone significantly reduced astrocyte injury after both GD and OGD, independent of an elevation in HSP70. To further search for the mechanism of HDJ-2 protection, cultured astrocytes allowed to recover 16 hours after 8 hours GD were labeled with a monoclonal antiubiquitin antibody that recognizes both free ubiquitin and ubiquitinated proteins. The immunolabeling pattern changed from a relatively even distribution in both nuclei and cytoplasm in control cells to heterogeneous aggregates and marked reduction of nuclear staining in most of the cells after GD. When HDJ-2 was overexpressed, the number of cells with evidence of protein aggregation was significantly reduced. Thus, blocking protein aggregation may be an important mechanism by which HDJ-2 protects cells from damage.",

Dysplastic renal tissue is characterized by primitive tubular epithelium associated with increased mesenchyme. Several polypeptide growth factors (GF), which interact with target cells through a cell-surface membrane receptor, have been reported to be involved in the regulation of urothelial cell growth in normal and neoplastic states. Recent reports have demonstrated that basic fibroblast GF (bFGF, FGF-2) is a mitogen for renal proximal-tubule epithelial cells. Keratinocyte GF (KGF, FGF-7), which belongs to the FGF family, is believed to be a paracrine mediator of epithelial-cell proliferation. The aim of this study was to investigate the immunoactivity of bFGF and KGF and their receptors in the dysplastic kidney in order to further understand the pathogenesis of RD. Specimens of dysplastic upper poles of duplex kidneys were surgically resected from ten patients. Age-matched control material included six kidney specimens taken at autopsy from patients without evidence of urologic disease. Indirect immunohistochemistry was performed using the Strept-ABC method with four antibodies: bFGF, KGF, FGF receptor (flg), and KGF receptor (bek). There was absent or weak bFGF, KGF, flg, and bek immunoreactivity in normal kidneys. In the dysplastic kidneys, there was strong immunoreactivity of bFGF and KGF and their receptors in the epithelium of primitive tubules.

Specifically, the protective effect of the pharmacologic alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR) agonist PNU282987 was analyzed in organotypic hippocampal cultures (OHCs) subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) in vitro as well as in photothrombotic stroke in vivo.;OHCs exposed to OGD followed by reoxygenation elicited cell death, measured by propidium iodide and 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide staining. Activation of α7 nAChR by PNU282987, after OGD, reduced cell death, reactive oxygen species production, and tumor necrosis factor release. This was associated with induction of HO-1 expression, an effect reversed by α-bungarotoxin and by tin-protoporphyrin IX. The protective effect of PNU282987 was lost in microglial-depleted OHCs as well as in OHCs from Nrf2-deficient-versus-wild-type mice, an effect associated with suppression of HO-1 expression in microglia.

An oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model was constructed using mouse N2A neuroblastoma cells (N2A). Western blot analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were employed to detect protein and miRNA expression levels. miR-21 and miR-24 were analyzed in the plasma from 68 patients with acute cerebral infarction (ACI) and 21 healthy individuals. In the present study, it was identified that plasma miR-21 and miR-24 were lower in ACI patients than in the controls (P<0.05). A positive correlation was demonstrated between plasma miR-21 and miR-24, and a negative correlation was revealed between miR-21, miR-24 and the National Institutes of Health Scales Score (NIHSS) within the first day following stroke. In addition, the expression of miR-21 and miR-24 was upregulated by 3.3- and 4.9-fold, respectively, when the reoxygenation time persisted up to 24 h following 3 h of OGD. The expression of Bcl-2 was upregulated following gain of miR-21 function, while X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) was downregulated after gain of miR-24 function in N2A cells. The data suggested that miR-21 may have an antiapoptotic effect in N2A neuroblastoma cells following OGD and reoxygenation, while miR-24 may have a pro-apoptotic effect. Therefore, these microRNAs may be potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of post-ischemic injury and may act as diagnostic markers during the early stage of ACI. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Thrombin and factor Xa (FXa) are agonists for G protein-coupled receptors (GPRCs) and may contribute to vascular lesion formation by stimulating proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Mitogenic signaling of GPCRs requires transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). In rat SMCs, thrombin transactivates the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) via a pathway that involves heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) as ligand for EGFR. The purpose of this study was to investigate in human SMCs the role of receptor transactivation in the mitogenic response to thrombin and FXa. Thrombin (10 nmol/L) and FXa (100 nmol/L) cause a 3.3- and 2.6-fold increase in DNA synthesis, respectively. In human SMCs, neither thrombin nor FXa causes EGFR phosphorylation, and blockade of EGFR kinase does not inhibit DNA synthesis. However, DNA synthesis and phosphorylation of fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR-1) induced by thrombin or FXa are inhibited by antibodies neutralizing basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) or by heparin. Hirudin inhibits thrombin-, but not FXa-induced mitogenesis, indicating that FXa acts independently of thrombin. We further demonstrate by ELISA that upon thrombin and FXa stimulation, bFGF is released and binds to the extracellular matrix. Our data suggest that in human vascular SMCs, both thrombin and FXa rapidly release bFGF into the pericellular matrix. This is followed by transactivation of the FGFR-1 and increased proliferation. Heparin may inhibit the mitogenic effects of thrombin and FXa in human SMCs by preventing bFGF binding to FGFR-1.",

The role of microglia in this inflammatory response has not been studied extensively. We used an in vitro model of murine microglia to investigate changes in microglial cytokine release and injury during early development. Isolated microglia were subjected to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activation or injury by glucose deprivation (GD), serum deprivation (SD), or combined oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) for varying durations. The extent and the type of cell death were determined by trypan blue, terminal deoxynucleotidyl end-nick labeling, and annexin staining. Early-culture microglia (2-3 d in purified culture) showed significantly more apoptotic cell death after SD, GD, and OGD compared with microglia maintained in culture for 14-17 d. Measurements of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and IL-1beta in culture media demonstrated that OGD induced greater release of both TNF-alpha and IL-1beta than LPS activation, with early-culture microglia producing more TNF-alpha compared with late-culture microglia. Microglia that are cultured for a short time are more sensitive to ischemia-like injury in vitro than those that are cultured for longer durations and may contribute to worsening brain injury by increased release of inflammatory cytokines. Inhibition of microglial activation and decreasing proinflammatory cytokine release may be targets for reduction of neonatal hypoxic/ischemic brain injury.",

The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanism of DHI in heart and brain co-protection effects to determine whether AVP plays key role in this course. In the present study, we found that both the supernatant from oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and reperfused primary rat neuronal cells (PRNCs) and AVP treatment caused significant reduction in cell viability and mitochondrial activity in primary rat cardiac myocytes (RCMs). Besides, DHI had the same protective effects with conivaptan, a dual vasopressin V1A and V2 receptor antagonist, in reducing the RCM damage induced by overdose AVP. DHI significantly decreased the injury of both PRNCs and RCMs. Meanwhile, the AVP level was elevated dramatically in OGD and reperfusion PRNCs, and DHI was able to decrease the AVP expression in the injured PRNCs. Therefore, our present results suggested that OGD and reperfusion PRNCs might induce myocyte injury by elevating the AVP expression in PRNCs. The ability of DHI to reinstate AVP level may be one of the mechanisms of its brain and heart co-protection effects. ",

Cultured hippocampal neurons were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) for 2h followed by a 24-h reoxygenation. GSRd exhibited remarkable neuroprotection when presented during OGD and reoxygenation, which may be ascribed to its antioxidative properties by reducing the intracellular reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde production; increasing glutathione content; and enhancing the antioxidant enzymatic activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. Additionally, GSRd could stabilize the mitochondrial membrane potential and attenuate apoptotic death of hippocampal neurons after OGD exposure. These findings suggested that GSRd may be a potential neuroprotective agent for cerebral ischemic injury and should encourage further in vivo studies on stroke to explore the potential neuroprotective efficacy of GSRd.",

In order to identify underlying genetic alterations and molecular mechanisms, we examined three family members affected by multinodular DNETs as well as 100 sporadic tumors from 96 patients, which had been referred to us as DNETs. We performed whole-exome sequencing on 46 tumors and targeted sequencing for hotspot FGFR1 mutations and BRAF p.V600E was used on the remaining samples. FISH, copy number variation assays and Sanger sequencing were used to validate the findings. By whole-exome sequencing of the familial cases, we identified a novel germline FGFR1 mutation, p.R661P. Somatic activating FGFR1 mutations (p.N546K or p.K656E) were observed in the tumor samples and further evidence for functional relevance was obtained by in silico modeling. The FGFR1 p.K656E mutation was confirmed to be in cis with the germline p.R661P variant. In 43 sporadic cases, in which the diagnosis of DNET could be confirmed on central blinded neuropathology review, FGFR1 alterations were also frequent and mainly comprised intragenic tyrosine kinase FGFR1 duplication and multiple mutants in cis (25/43; 58.1 %) while BRAF p.V600E alterations were absent (0/43). In contrast, in 53 cases, in which the diagnosis of DNET was not confirmed, FGFR1 alterations were less common (10/53; 19 %; p < 0.0001) and hotspot BRAF p.V600E (12/53; 22.6 %) (p < 0.001) prevailed. We observed overexpression of phospho-ERK in FGFR1 p.R661P and p.N546K mutant expressing HEK293 cells as well as FGFR1 mutated tumor samples, supporting enhanced MAP kinase pathway activation under these conditions. In conclusion, constitutional and somatic FGFR1 alterations and MAP kinase pathway activation are key events in the pathogenesis of DNET.

In several cultured cell lines, FGFR1 transmits a potent mitogenic signal, whereas FGFR3 has little or no mitogenic activity. However, in other in vitro assays the FGFR3 intracellular domain is comparable with that of FGFR1. In vivo, FGFR3 negatively regulates chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, and activating mutations are the molecular etiology of achondroplasia. By contrast, FGFR1 transmits a proliferative signal in various cell types in vivo. These observations suggest that inhibition of the proliferating chondrocyte could be a unique property of FGFR3 or, alternatively, a unique property of the proliferating chondrocyte. To test this hypothesis, FGFR1 signaling was activated in the growth plate in cells that normally express FGFR3. Comparison of transgenic mice with an activated FGFR1 signaling pathway with an achondroplasia-like mouse that expresses a similarly activated FGFR3 signaling pathway demonstrated that both transgenes result in a similar achondroplasia-like dwarfism. These data demonstrate that suppression of mitogenic activity by FGFR signaling is a property that is unique to growth plate chondrocytes. Surprisingly, we observed that in transgenic mice expressing an activated FGFR, some synovial joints failed to develop and were replaced by cartilage. The defects in the digit joints phenocopied the symphalangism that occurs in Apert syndrome and the number of affected joints was dependent on transgene dose. In contrast to the phenotype in the growth plate, the joint phenotype was more severe in transgenic mice with an activated FGFR1 signaling pathway. The failure of joint development resulted from expanded chondrification in the presumptive joint space, suggesting a crucial role for FGF signaling in regulating the transition of condensed mesenchyme to cartilage and in defining the boundary of skeletal elements.",

Recently, new studies have indicated that miRNAs are involved in certain angiogenic settings and signaling pathways use these non-coding RNAs to promote or suppress angiogenic processes. Herein, VEGFR2 and FGFR1 were identified as miR-129-1 and miR-133 targets using bioinformatic algorithms, respectively. Afterwards, using luciferase reporter assay and gene expression analysis at both mRNA and protein levels, VEGFR2 and FGFR1 were validated as miR-129-1 and miR-133 targets. In addition, we showed that miR-129-1 and miR-133 suppress angiogenesis properties such as proliferation rate, cell viability, and migration activity of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in vitro. We conclude that these miRNAs can suppress key factors of angiogenesis by directly targeting them. These results have important therapeutic implications for a variety of diseases involving deregulation of angiogenesis, including cancer. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"The extracellular matrix microenvironment regulates cell phenotype and function. One mechanism by which this is achieved is the transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases by specific matrix molecules. Here, we demonstrate that the provisional matrix protein, fibronectin (FN), activates fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor-1 (FGFR1) independent of FGF ligand in liver endothelial cells. FN activation of FGFR1 requires β1 integrin, as evidenced by neutralizing antibody and siRNA-based studies. Complementary genetic and pharmacologic approaches identify that the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src is required for FN transactivation of FGFR1. Whereas FGF ligand-induced phosphorylation of FGFR1 preferentially activates ERK, FN-induced phosphorylation of FGFR1 preferentially activates AKT, indicating differential downstream signaling of FGFR1 in response to alternate stimuli. Mutation analysis of known tyrosine residues of FGFR1 reveals that tyrosine 653/654 and 766 residues are required for FN-FGFR1 activation of AKT and chemotaxis. Thus, our study mechanistically dissects a new signaling pathway by which FN achieves endothelial cell chemotaxis, demonstrates how differential phosphorylation profiles of FGFR1 can achieve alternate downstream signals, and, more broadly, highlights the diversity of mechanisms by which the extracellular matrix microenvironment regulates cell behavior through transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases.",

Several cell models were used to investigate FGFR1 inhibition in vitro and in combination with cisplatin and irradiation. Mouse intraperitoneal xenotransplant models were used for in vivo validation.;FGFR1, FGF2, and FGF18 were overexpressed in mesothelioma. Stimulation with FGF2 led to increased cell proliferation, migration, and transition to a more sarcomatoid phenotype in subsets of mesothelioma cell lines. In contrast, inhibition of FGFR1 by a specific kinase inhibitor or a dominant-negative FGFR1 construct led to significantly decreased proliferation, clonogenicity, migration, spheroid formation, and G1 cell cycle arrest in several mesothelioma cell lines, accompanied by apoptosis induction and decreased mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activity. Reduced tumor growth, proliferation, mitogenic signaling, and apoptosis induction were observed in vivo.

Both cell lines and primary cultures have been useful for analysis of transitional steps in the chondroblast (CB) and osteoblast (OB) lineages. One striking feature is that OBs and CBs share expression of some molecules, including newer markers such as epsilon BP (galectin-3), while also having unique markers. The fact that hypertrophic chondrocytes appear able to downregulate cartilage markers and upregulate OB markers also points to an interesting lineage relationship that needs to be explored further. Recently, we have focused on the osteoprogenitors that divide and differentiate into mature OBs forming bone nodules in fetal rat calvaria cell cultures. We use cellular, immunocytochemical, and molecular approaches, including PCR on small numbers of cells, to discriminate stages. Nodule formation is characterized by loss of proliferative capacity and sequential increased marker expression, that is, alkaline phosphatase (AP), followed by bone sialoprotein (BSP), and osteocalcin. Upregulation of collagen type I and biphasic expression of osteopontin, with two peaks corresponding to proliferation and differentiation stages, also occurs. A variety of other molecules are also upregulated in the mature OB, including epsilon BP and CD44s. By replica plating and PCR, we have begun to study the expression of the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for potential regulatory molecules (e.g., PTHrP) and their receptors (e.g., PTHR, FGFR-1, and PDGFR alpha) and have found all to be modulated during the progression from committed osteoprogenitor to mature OB.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Proliferation assays confirmed that MCF-7 cells were highly responsive to FGF-2 complexed with GAGB, whereas migration assays indicated that FGF-1/HSGAGA combinations were stimulatory for the highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction for the levels of FGF receptor (FGFR) isoforms revealed that MCF-7 cells have greater levels of FGFR1 and that MDA-MB-231 cells have greater relative levels of FGFR2. Cross-linking demonstrated that FGF-2/HSGAGB primarily activated FGFR1, which in turn up-regulated the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase; in contrast, FGF-1/HSGAGA led to the phosphorylation of equal proportions of both FGFR1 and FGFR2, which in turn led to the up-regulation of Src and p125(FAK). MDA-MB-231 cells were particularly responsive to vitronectin substrates in the presence of FGF-1/HSGAGA, and blocking antibodies established that they used the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin to bind to it.

From a perspective of the healthcare system, Markov models were built to simulate the life experience of the target population. The models projected discounted lifetime costs ($), quality adjusted life year (QALY), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) indicating the cost-effectiveness of each strategy against a Singapore willingness-to-pay of $46,200/QALY. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to identify the influential variables and their associated thresholds, and to quantify the influence of parameter uncertainties respectively.;With an ICER of $44,098/QALY, the annual OGD surveillance was the optimal strategy while the 2-yearly surveillance was the most cost-effective strategy (ICER = $25,949/QALY). The screening-based strategies were either extendedly dominated or cost-ineffective. The cost-effectiveness heterogeneity of the four strategies was observed across age-gender subgroups. Eight influential parameters were identified each with their specific thresholds to define the choice of optimal strategy. Accounting for the model uncertainties, the probability that the annual surveillance is the optimal strategy in Singapore was 44.5%.;Endoscopic surveillance is potentially cost-effective in the prevention of GC for populations at low to intermediate risk. Regarding program implementation, a detailed analysis of influential factors and their associated thresholds is necessary.

Short-term (two week) hormonal therapy with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole substantially reduced proliferation as measured by Ki67 immunohistochemistry in one tumor, whereas the second was essentially unchanged. Extensive molecular and genetic work-up of the two tumors yielded divergent lesions in the two tumors: an activating KRAS mutation in the responsive tumor and an amplification of the fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1) locus in the treatment-refractory tumor. These findings provide an insight to possible mechanisms of resistance to antiestrogen therapy in ER+ breast cancers. First, they illustrate the necessity of clinically approved assays to identify FGFR1 gene amplification, which occur in approximately 5% of breast tumors and have been linked to antiestrogen resistance. It is quite possible that the addition of FGFR inhibitors to ER-targeted therapy will yield a superior antitumor effect and improved patient outcome. Second, they suggest that the role of activating mutations in RAS, although rare in breast cancer, may need to be explored in the context of ER+ breast tumors.",

Alterations of astrocytes were evaluated with astroglia markers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). The formation of autophagosomes in astrocytes was examined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The expression of autophagy-related proteins were examined with immunoblotting. The role of autophagy in OGD or focal cerebral ischemia-induced death of astrocytes was assessed by pharmacological inhibition of autophagy with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or bafilomycin A(1) (Baf). The results showed that GFAP staining was reduced in the infarct brain areas 3-12 h following pMCAO. Cerebral ischemia or OGD induced activation of autophagy in astrocytes as evidenced by the increased formation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes and monodansylcadaverine (MDC)-labeled vesicles; the increased production of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3-II ); the upregulation of Beclin 1, lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2) and lysosomal cathepsin B expression; and the decreased levels of cytoprotective Bcl-2 protein in primary astrocytes. 3-MA inhibited OGD-induced the increase in LC3-II and the decline in Bcl-2. Furthermore, 3-MA and Baf slightly but significantly attenuated OGD-induced death of astrocytes. 3-MA also significantly increased the number of GFAP-positive cells and the protein levels of GFAP in the ischemic cortex core 12 h following pMCAO.

A middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion model with Sprague Dawley (SD) rats was established. For I/R intervention, the rats were treated with the 12/15-LOX-derived product 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) for 30 min before cerebral artery occlusion. Primary cortical neurons from SD rats were used to establish an OGD cell model. 12-HETE or a 12/15-LOX antisense oligonucleotide (asON-12/15-LOX) was added to OGD-treated neurons. Western blots, immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays detected protein. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyzed the expression of the PPARγ target genes. PPARγ-DNA binding activity was determined by peroxisome proliferator responsive element luciferase reporter vectors. 12/15-LOX total protein increased significantly with I/R, and expression of 12-HETE was also upregulated. 12-HETE treatment increased PPARγ protein expression and inhibited inducible nitric oxide synthase protein expression, which was upregulated with I/R. PPARγ nuclear protein and 12/15-LOX total protein expression in OGD-treated neurons increased significantly. 12-HETE treatment increased the expression of PPARγ nuclear protein, upregulated the mRNA levels of PPARγ target genes (lipoprotein lipase and acyl-CoA oxidase) and enhanced PPARγ-DNA binding activity. asON-12/15-LOX treatment inhibited 12/15-LOX and PPARγ protein expression and lipoprotein lipase mRNA. Cerebral I/R injury in rats and OGD treatment in neurons promoted 12/15-LOX expression, and 12-HETE activated PPARγ.

In this study, we compared the neuroprotective effect of prolonged hypothermia initiated between 0 and 8 h after reoxygenation using an in vitro model of simulated global brain ischemia. Organotypic hippocampal slices were prepared from 5-day-old Wistar rat pups and cultured for 1 week prior to analysis. Ischemia was simulated by normothermic oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). Hypothermia (33 degrees C) was initiated 0-8 h after reoxygenation and maintained until 24 h post-injury. CA1 regional cell death was quantified by propidium iodide (PI) fluorescence. Release of 14-3-3 beta protein was evaluated as a potential surrogate maker for neuroprotection. Hypothermia initiated 0, 1, 2, or 4 h after 30 min OGD reduced 24 h CA1 regional PI fluorescence by 47 +/- 34%, 85 +/- 4%, 88 +/- 3%, and 88 +/- 5% (P < 0.05 for all versus normothermic reoxygenation). Direct comparison of hypothermia initiated 4 or 8 h after reoxygenation revealed equivalent neuroprotection following 15 and 30 min OGD, but neither was protective after 60 min OGD. Hypothermia initiated 4 or 8 h after 30 min OGD reduced 14-3-3 beta release by 73 +/- 11% and 92 +/- 4%, respectively (P < 0.01 for both versus normothermic reoxygenation). In this model, the neuroprotective effect of prolonged post-ischemic hypothermia is both optimal and equivalent when initiated between 1 and 8 h after reoxygenation.

SU6668 was given p.o. (200 mg/kg, daily) as a single agent or in combination with paclitaxel i.v. (6 mg/kg/dose every other day or 20 mg/kg/dose weekly). Tumor burden was evaluated at the end of the treatment period as ascites volume and tumor cells, VEGF, FGF-2, and PDGF levels in ascites, and involvement of the organ of the peritoneal cavity. Response was evaluated as percentage increment of life span (%ILS).;SU6668 affected ascites formation and tumor burden in the peritoneal cavity of nude mice bearing HOC22 and HOC79 xenografts. Decreased levels of VEGF and PDGF in ascites paralleled this effect. The overall survival of the mice bearing HOC xenograft (HOC79 less response than HOC22) was significantly increased by the treatment with SU6668. The magnitude of the effects depended on the length of treatment and tumor burden at the beginning of treatment. The combination of SU6668 with paclitaxel significantly prolonged the survival of mice bearing HOC79, compared with single therapies. SU6668-based combination therapy was more effective with paclitaxel given at the optimal dose and schedule (20 mg/kg every 7 days for 3 doses) than at the same total dose but split (6 mg/kg every 2 days for 10 doses). However, a similar outcome was observed when giving high-dose paclitaxel (20 mg/kg every 7 days for 3 doses) in monotherapy or split low-dose paclitaxel (6 mg/kg every 2 days for 10 doses) but in combination with SU6668. The addition of paclitaxel, by either schedule, to SU6668 treatment inhibited tumor spread in the peritoneal organs (omentum, pancreas, and diaphragm) even at low doses of paclitaxel. A greater effect was observed with prolonged treatments.;This study shows that SU6668 in combination with paclitaxel inhibits ovarian carcinoma progression in the peritoneal cavity, by blocking ascites formation and tumor spread.

The OGD condition was induced by including 2mM sodium dithionite (Na(2)S(2)O(4)) in glucose-free DMEM medium. The concentration of QUE in this study ranged from 3μM to 81μM. OPCs were identified by immunocytochemical staining. Cell viability was analyzed using the water soluble tetrazolium salt-8 (WST-8) and lactate dehydrogenase assay (LDH). The morphological changes of the nucleus were measured using Hoechst 33258 nuclear staining, and the ratio of apoptotic cells was determined by FITC annexin V- and propidium iodide (PI) flow cytometry assay kit. In addition, the levels of pro-apoptotic proteins such as cleaved-caspase-3 and Bax and the anti-apoptotic proteins p-Akt and Bcl-2 were quantified using western blotting. The results showed that the OPC cell survival rate was significantly increased by incubation in conditioned medium supplemented with QUE as measured by the WST-8 assay, while the LDH release rate was significantly decreased as analyzed by the LDH assay. Furthermore, apoptosis assay showed that the apoptosis ratio of OPCs was also dramatically reduced by QUE. Western blotting showed that the expression levels of Bax and cleaved-caspase-3 proteins were down-regulated, while Bcl-2 and p-Akt were up-regulated. Further study showed that the increase in p-Akt by QUE was reduced by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. These results indicated that QUE effectively protected OPCs from OGD-induced injury and that the mechanism might be related to the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.",

We examined the interface between `higher` thalamus and the hypothalamus the using live brain slices where variation in blood flow is not a factor. Whole-cell current clamp recording of 18 thalamic neurons in response to 10 min O2/glucose deprivation (OGD) revealed a rapid anoxic depolarization (AD) from which thalamic neurons do not recover. Newly acquired neurons could not be patched following AD, confirming significant regional thalamic injury. Coinciding with AD, light transmittance (LT) imaging during whole-cell recording showed an elevated LT front that initiated in midline thalamus and that propagated into adjacent hypothalamus. However, hypothalamic neurons patched in paraventricular nucleus (PVN, n= 8 magnocellular and 12 parvocellular neurons) and suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN, n= 18) only slowly depolarized as AD passed through these regions. And with return to control aCSF, hypothalamic neurons repolarized and recovered their input resistance and action potential amplitude. Moreover, newly acquired hypothalamic neurons could be readily patched following exposure to OGD, with resting parameters similar to neurons not previously exposed to OGD. Thalamic susceptibility and hypothalamic resilience were also observed following ouabain exposure which blocks the Na(+)/K(+) pump, evoking depolarization similar to OGD in all neuronal types tested. Finally, brief exposure to elevated [K(+)]o caused spreading depression (SD, a milder, AD-like event) only in thalamic neurons so SD generation is regionally correlated with strong AD. Therefore the thalamus-hypothalamus interface represents a discrete boundary where neuronal vulnerability to ischemia is high in thalamus (like more rostral neocortex, striatum, hippocampus). In contrast hypothalamic neurons are comparatively resistant, generating weaker and recoverable anoxic depolarization similar to brainstem neurons, possibly the result of a Na/K pump that better functions during ischemia.

        "Doc_abstract":"The molecular mechanisms responsible for increasing iron and neurodegeneration in brain ischemia are an interesting area of research which could open new therapeutic approaches. Previous evidence has shown that activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) through RelA acetylation on Lys310 is the prerequisite for p50/RelA-mediated apoptosis in cellular and animal models of brain ischemia. We hypothesized that the increase of iron through a NF-κB-regulated 1B isoform of the divalent metal transporter-1 (1B/DMT1) might contribute to post-ischemic neuronal damage. Both in mice subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and in neuronally differentiated SK-N-SH cells exposed to oxygen-glucose-deprivation (OGD), 1A/DMT1 was only barely expressed while the 1B/DMT1 without iron-response-element (-IRE) protein and mRNA were early up-regulated. Either OGD or over-expression of 1B/(-)IRE DMT1 isoform significantly increased iron uptake, as detected by total reflection X-ray fluorescence, and iron-dependent cell death. Iron chelation by deferoxamine treatment or (-)IRE DMT1 RNA silencing displayed significant neuroprotection against OGD which concomitantly decreased intracellular iron levels. We found evidence that 1B/(-)IRE DMT1 was a target gene for RelA activation and acetylation on Lys310 residue during ischemia. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of the 1B/DMT1 promoter showed there was increased interaction with RelA and acetylation of H3 histone during OGD exposure of cortical neurons. Over-expression of wild-type RelA increased 1B/DMT1 promoter-luciferase activity, the (-)IRE DMT1 protein, as well as neuronal death. Expression of the acetylation-resistant RelA-K310R construct, which carried a mutation from lysine 310 to arginine, but not the acetyl-mimic mutant RelA-K310Q, down-regulated the 1B/DMT1 promoter, consequently offering neuroprotection. Our data showed that 1B/(-)IRE DMT1 expression and intracellular iron influx are early downstream responses to NF-κB/RelA activation and acetylation during brain ischemia and contribute to the pathogenesis of stroke-induced neuronal damage.",

Neuronal cell viability significantly decreased after 6h and 12h of reoxygenation in Group IV (P < 0.05). Electron microscopy showed the presence of many autophagic vacuoles and the formation of autolysosomes in the neurons; the number of autophagic vacuoles decreased transiently at 6h, while a new autophagic flux and a large number of empty autophagic vacuoles were observed at 12h. In Group IV, a large number of autophagic vacuoles were present at 0.5h and 2h of reoxygenation, which gradually decreased with increasing reoxygenation time. No significant differences in the expression of the LC3II protein were detected between the Group II and IV prior to 6h of reoxygenation, and LC3II expression showed an overall rise-decline pattern. However, LC3II protein expression increased in Group II at 12h of reoxygenation, whereas a continuous decline was observed in Group IV.

Thus, the aim of this study was to determine if ROS is involved in the activation of autophagy in HI-mediated neonatal brain injury and to determine if this is a protective or deleterious pathway. Initial electron microscopy data demonstrated that autophagosome formation is elevated in P7 hippocampal slice cultures exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). This corresponded with increased levels of LC3II mRNA and protein. The autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenine (3-MA) effectively reduced LC3II levels and autophagosome formation in hippocampal slice cultures exposed to OGD. Neuronal cell death was significantly attenuated. Finally, we found that the pharmacologic inhibition of NADPH oxidase using apocynin or gp91ds-tat decreased autophagy in hippocampal slice cultures and the rat brain respectively.

To determine whether the effects of NGF rely upon novel Integrative Nuclear FGF Receptor-1 (FGFR1) Signaling (INFS) we utilized the PC12 clonal cell line, a long-standing benchmark model of sympathetic neuronal differentiation. We demonstrate that NGF increases expression of the fgfr1 gene and promotes trafficking of FGFR1 protein from cytoplasm to nucleus by inhibiting FGFR1 nuclear export. Nuclear-targeted dominant negative FGFR1 antagonizes NGF-induced neurite outgrowth, doublecortin (dcx) expression and activation of the tyrosine hydroxylase (th) gene promoter, while active constitutive nuclear FGFR1 mimics the effects of NGF. NGF increases the expression of dcx, th, βIII tubulin, nurr1 and nur77, fgfr1and fibroblast growth factor-2 (fgf-2) genes, while enhancing binding of FGFR1and Nur77/Nurr1 to those genes. NGF activates transcription from isolated NurRE and NBRE motifs. Nuclear FGFR1 transduces NGF activation of the Nur dimer and raises basal activity of the Nur monomer.

        "Doc_abstract":"Inappropriate fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling is involved in most tissue-specific pathologies including cancer. Previously we showed that inappropriate expression and chronic activity of FGF receptor (FGFR) 1 in hepatocytes accelerated diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-initiated hepatocarcinogenesis. Here we showed that although widely expressed FGF1 and FGF2 are frequently upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), germline deletion of both FGF1 and FGF2 had no effect on DEN-initiated hepatocarcinogenesis. Thus overexpression of FGF1 or FGF2 may be a consequence rather than contributor to hepatoma progression. FGF21 is the first of 22 homologues whose expression has been reported to be preferentially in the liver. We showed that similar to FGF1 and FGF2, FGF21 mRNA was upregulated in neoplastic and regenerating liver after partial hepatectomy (PH) and CCl4 administration. In situ hybridization analysis confirmed that in contrast to FGF1 and FGF2, expression of FGF21 mRNA was limited to hepatocytes. Forced overexpression of FGF21 in hepatocytes by gene targeting had no apparent impact on normal liver development and compensatory response to injury. Surprisingly, overexpression of FGF21 delayed the appearance of DEN-induced liver tumors. At 8 and 10 mo, only 10% and 30% of transgenic mice, respectively, developed adenomas compared to 50% (all adenomas) and 80% (60% adenoma/20% HCC) in the wild-type (WT) mice. However, the incidence and burden of HCC at 10 mo and later was equal in the FGF21 transgenic and WT mice. We propose that FGF21 may delay development of adenomas through activation of resident hepatocyte FGFR4 at early times, but counteracts the delay by acceleration of progression to HCC through interaction with ectopic FGFR1 once it appears in hepatoma cells. This indicates a dual function of FGF21 that may reflect changes in FGFR isotype during progression of differentiated hepatoma cells.",

To this end, microglia of the central nervous system serve a complex function not only to dispense of foreign organisms and injured cells of the brain, but also to foster tissue repair and reorganization during neuronal and vascular cell insults. We therefore examined the ability of EPO to modulate microglial cell survival and the underlying signal transduction pathways that govern microglial integrity during oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)--induced oxidative stress. We demonstrate in the microglial cell line EOC 2 that EPO provides direct microglial protection against early and late apoptotic programs of membrane phosphatidylserine exposure and genomic DNA degradation. Furthermore, expression and activation of Akt1 is vital to the cytoprotective capacity of EPO, since pharmacological inhibition of the PI 3-K pathway or gene silencing of Akt1 expression eliminates the ability of EPO to protect microglial cells. Through Akt1 dependent mechanisms that can be abrogated through the gene silencing of Akt1, maintenance of microglial cell integrity during OGD by EPO is closely integrated with the phosphorylation and inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta activity as well as the intracellular trafficking of beta-catenin and nuclear factor-kappaB. Further work that continues to elucidate the ability of EPO to target the intricate pathways that determine inflammatory cell function and integrity may lay the ground work for new therapeutic avenues for neurodegenerative disease.",

All genetic markers were genotyped using TaqMan real-time PCR. Chi-square test was used to compare genotypes, allele frequencies, and haplotype differences between groups. Binary logistic regression analyzed the significance of many covariates and the incidence of non-union. Statistical analysis revealed open fracture to be a risk factor for non-union development (p < 0.001, OR 3.6 [1.70-7.67]). A significant association of haplotype GTAA in BMP4 (p = 0.01) and FGFR1 rs13317 (p = 0.005) with NU could be observed. Also, uneventful healing showed association with FAM5C rs1342913 (p = 0.04).

Known family members are PARP-1, PARP-2, PARP-3, vPARP, tankyrase 1 and tankyrase 2, each of them with a possible specific role in cell biology. The most studied member of the family is PARP-1, which is abundantly present in the nucleus and is involved in the maintenance of genomic stability. In pathological conditions, highly reactive radical species may cause DNA damage and PARP-1 hyperactivation. This may lead to necrotic cell death through massive NAD consumption. We show that following middle cerebral artery occlusion, rats treated with PARP inhibitors displayed reduced brain infarct volumes. Similarly, PARP inhibitors reduced neuronal death induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) or excitotoxins in primary cultures of murine cortical cells. On the contrary, PARP inhibitors did not attenuate the OGD-induced selective loss of CA1 pyramidal cells in rat organotypic hippocampal slices. In addition, they were not neuroprotective against transient bilateral carotid occlusion in gerbils. We observed that post-ischemic brain damage was predominally necrotic in cultured cortical cells, whereas a caspase-dependent apoptotic process was responsible for the CA1 pyramidal cell loss in hippocampal slices. Hence, it appears reasonable to propose PARP inhibitors as useful therapeutic agents in pathological brain conditions were necrosis predominates.",

Nuclear factor erythroid 2‑related factor 2 (Nrf‑2) signaling is important in antioxidative stress, and the role of Nrf‑2 signaling in the enhanced neuroprotection of NSCs by resveratrol following stroke also remains to be elucidated. In the present study, NSCs were pretreated with resveratrol prior to oxygen‑glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) in vitro. The survival, apoptosis and proliferation of the NSCs were assessed using an MTT assay, Hoechst 33258 staining of nuclei and flow cytometry, respectively.

In addition, the protein expression levels of Nrf2, HO‑1 and NQO1 were significantly upregulated.

Cortical slices were divided into two groups: a group in which oxidative stress was induced by oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), and a group of non-deprived controls (nOGD). Interestingly, exercise by itself increased superoxide dismutase activity (nOGD, SED vs. TRA animals) with no effect on pro-oxidative markers. In fact, TRA-OGD slices showed lowered levels of lactate dehydrogenase when compared with SED-OGD controls, reinforcing the idea that exercise affords a neuroprotective effect.

While the neuroprotection conferred by progesterone was not affected by SU-10603, an inhibitor of cytochrome P45017α, finasteride, a 5α-reductase inhibitor that blocks the conversion of progesterone to allopregnanolone, partially reversed the neuroprotection induced by progesterone. The progesterone metabolite, allopregnanolone attenuated neuronal injury induced by OGD/reoxygenation. Pretreatment with letrozole, a cytochrome P450 aromatase inhibitor or 4-hydroxyphenyl-1-naphthol, a 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 inhibitor showed no effect on testosterone-mediated neuroprotection, while finasteride completely abolished the protective action of testosterone. Treatment with 5α-dihydrotestosterone significantly suppressed neuronal injury. Pretreatment with mifepristone, a progesterone receptor antagonist and hydroxyflutamid, an androgen receptor antagonist significantly diminished the neuroprotective effects of progesterone and testosterone, respectively.

Recent studies have associated PK2 and prokineticin receptors (PKR) with human diseases, but because their role in neuropathology is still debated we examined whether prokineticins exert a protective or deleterious role in models of cerebral ischemia and ischemic tolerance in vitro. In order to mimic cerebral ischemia, we exposed primary murine cortical cell cultures or rat organotypic hippocampal slices to appropriate periods of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), which leads to neuronal damage 24 h later. Ischemic tolerance was induced by exposing hippocampal slices to a preconditioning subtoxic pharmacological stimulus (3 μM NMDA for 1 h) 24 h before the exposure to OGD. Bv8 (10-100 nM) attenuated OGD injury in cortical cultures and hippocampal slices, and the effect was prevented by the PKR antagonist PC7. The development of OGD tolerance was associated with an increase in the expression of PK2, PKR1 and PKR2 mRNA and proteins and was prevented by addition of the antagonist PC7 into the medium during preconditioning. Both Bv8 at protective concentrations and the NMDA preconditioning stimulus promoted the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt. These findings indicate that the prokineticin system can be up-regulated by a defensive preconditioning subtoxic NMDA stimulus and that PK2 may act as an endogenous neuroprotective factor through the activation of the ERK1/2 and Akt transduction pathways.

Although AAV uses the ubiquitously expressed cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) as a receptor, the transduction efficiency of AAV vectors varies greatly in different cells and tissues in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate here that cell surface expression of HSPG alone is insufficient for AAV infection, and that AAV also requires human fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) as a co-receptor for successful viral entry into the host cell. We document that cells that do not express either HSPG or FGFR1 fail to bind AAV and, consequently, are resistant to infection by AAV. These non-permissive cells are successfully transduced by AAV vectors after stable transfections with cDNAs encoding the murine HSPG and the human FGFR1. Furthermore, AAV infection of permissive cells, known to express both FGFR1 and the epidermal growth factor receptor, is abrogated by treatment of cells with basic fibroblast growth factor, but not with epidermal growth factor. The identification of FGFR1 as a co-receptor for AAV should provide new insights not only into its role in the life cycle of AAV, but also in the optimal use of AAV vectors in human gene therapy.",

The role of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in neuronal differentiation has been previously studied; however, the signaling pathway involved in this process remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the signaling pathway in the bFGF-induced neuronal differentiation of canine BMSCs. bFGF induced the mRNA expression of the neuron marker, microtubule associated protein-2 (MAP2) and the neuron-like morphological change in canine BMSCs. In the presence of inhibitors of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt, i.e., SU5402, LY294002, and MK2206, respectively, bFGF failed to induce the MAP2 mRNA expression and the neuron-like morphological change. bFGF induced Akt phosphorylation, but it was attenuated by the FGFR inhibitor SU5402 and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. In canine BMSCs, expression of FGFR-1 and FGFR-2 was confirmed, but only FGFR-2 activation was detected by cross-linking and immunoprecipitation analysis. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of FGFR-2 in canine BMSCs resulted in the attenuation of bFGF-induced Akt phosphorylation. These results suggest that the FGFR-2/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is involved in the bFGF-induced neuronal differentiation of canine BMSCs. ",

Here, we generated mice with both Fgfr1 deleted in the MM and Fgfr2(LR/LR) point mutations (Fgfr1(Mes-/-)Fgfrf2(LR/LR)). Unlike mice lacking both Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 in the MM, these mice had no obvious MM defects but had cranially displaced or duplex ureteric buds, probably as a result of decreased Bmp4 expression. Fgfr1(Mes-/-)Fgfr2(LR/LR) mice also had subsequent defects in ureteric morphogenesis, including dilated, hyperproliferative tips and decreased branching. Ultimately, they developed progressive renal cystic dysplasia associated with abnormally oriented cell division. Furthermore, mutants had increased and ectopic expression of Ret and its downstream targets in ureteric trunks, and exhibited upregulation of Ret/Etv4/5 signaling effectors, including Met, Myb, Cxcr4, and Crlf1. These defects were associated with reduced expression of Bmp4 in mesenchymal cells near mutant ureteric bud tips. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Fgfr2/Frs2α signaling in the MM promotes Bmp4 expression, which represses Ret levels and signaling in the ureteric bud to ensure normal ureteric morphogenesis.",

In mice homozygous for a hypomorphic allele of Fgfr1, neural crest cells migrating from the hindbrain mostly fail to enter the second branchial arch.

By means of Bioluminescence Energy Resonance Transfer (BRET) as a sign of FGFR1 homodimerization, we evaluated in HEK293T cells the effects of all known FGF agonist ligands on homodimer formation. A significant correlation between BRET(2) signaling and ERK1/2 phosphorylation was observed, leading to a further characterization of the binding and signaling properties of the FGF subfamilies. FGF agonist ligand-FGFR1 binding interactions appear as the main mechanism for the control of FGFR1 homodimerization and MAPK signaling which demonstrated a high correlation. The bioinformatic analysis demonstrates the interface of the two pro-triplets SSS (Ser-Ser-Ser) and YGS (Tyr-Gly-Ser) located in the extracellular and intracellular domain of the FGFR1. These pro-triplets are postulated participate in the FGFR1 homodimerization interface interaction.

Inhibition of smooth muscle cell bFGF expression provokes apoptosis, suggesting that endogenous bFGF generates an anti-apoptotic signal. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the survival function of endogenous bFGF requires signaling through FGFR. A recombinant adenovirus encoding a truncated murine FGFR-1 lacking the kinase domain (DN-FGFR) efficiently expressed the transgene in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells. The truncated receptor acted in a dominant negative fashion to effectively prevent receptor-mediated signaling, assessed by phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAP kinase. Expression of DN-FGFR provoked apoptosis of SMC in a dose-dependent fashion that was insensitive to recombinant bFGF but could be rescued by platelet derived growth factor or epidermal growth factor. Heterologous growth factor rescue was inhibited by PD98059, an inhibitor of MEK (MAP kinase-kinase). These data demonstrate that inhibition of FGF receptor activation results in apoptosis and suggest that an intact autocrine FGF signaling loop is required for vascular smooth muscle cell survival in vitro.

We found that the product of the tuberous sclerosis complex 1 gene (TSC1), hamartin, is selectively induced by ischemia in hippocampal CA3 neurons. In CA1 neurons, hamartin was unaffected by ischemia but was upregulated by IPC preceding ischemia, which protects the otherwise vulnerable CA1 cells. Suppression of hamartin expression with TSC1 shRNA viral vectors both in vitro and in vivo increased the vulnerability of neurons to cell death following oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) and ischemia. In vivo, suppression of TSC1 expression increased locomotor activity and decreased habituation in a hippocampal-dependent task.

All four receptors classes could be detected in breast cell lines; however, FGFR-4 and FGFR-2 appeared to be expressed at a higher level in breast cancer cell lines than in normal epithelial cells. Surprisingly, FGFR-3 localized in the cell nucleus by immunofluorescence. A second antibody to a separate epitope confirmed this finding and showed that the form of FGFR-3 present must contain an intact kinase domain as well as the growth factor binding domain. Western analysis of fractionated cells revealed the presence of two forms of FGFR-3 of 135 and 110 kDa. The 110-kDa form was predominantly found in the nucleus, whereas the 135 kDa form was sometimes found in the nucleus. RT-PCR analysis of FGFR-3 mRNA showed the presence of a splice variant in which exons 7 and 8 are deleted. This results in the translation of FGFR-3 missing the transmembrane domain but with an intact kinase domain, which could be a soluble, intracellular receptor. Transfection experiments showed that FGFR-3 containing this deletion and no signal peptide gave an identical nuclear staining pattern to that seen in breast epithelial cells. We conclude that two forms of FGFR-3 are present in breast epithelial cells; a full-length 135-kDa receptor, which has a conventional membrane localization, and a novel soluble form of 110 kDa.",

Auditory hair cells emerge from a Sox2-positive sensory patch in the inner ear epithelium, which is progressively restricted during development. This restriction depends on the action of signaling molecules. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling is important during sensory specification: attenuation of Fgfr1 disrupts cochlear hair cell formation; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here we report that in the absence of FGFR1 signaling, the expression of Sox2 within the sensory patch is not maintained. Despite the down-regulation of the prosensory domain markers, p27(Kip1), Hey2, and Hes5, progenitors can still exit the cell cycle to form the zone of non-proliferating cells (ZNPC), however the number of cells that form sensory cells is reduced. Analysis of a mutant Fgfr1 allele, unable to bind to the adaptor protein, Frs2/3, indicates that Sox2 maintenance can be regulated by MAP kinase. We suggest that FGF signaling, through the activation of MAP kinase, is necessary for the maintenance of sensory progenitors and commits precursors to sensory cell differentiation in the mammalian cochlea.

Because neurons are selectively vulnerable to ischemic injury, many studies have focused on neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction in ischemia.

Astrocytes carry out a number of functions that are critical to normal nervous system function, including uptake of neurotransmitters, regulation of pH and ion concentrations, and metabolic support of neurons. Mitochondria are important for many of these actions.

Mice with genetic reduction of fibroblast growth factor 2 (Fgf2) or Fgf receptor 1 (Fgfr1) exhibit dramatically improved remyelination following experimental demyelination with cuprizone. The current studies are the first to test neurobehavioral outcomes with these gene deletions that improved remyelination. The cuprizone protocols used did not produce overt abnormalities but did reduce bilateral sensorimotor coordination (complex wheel task) and increase sociability (two chamber apparatus with novel mouse). A significant effect of genotype was observed on the complex wheel task but not in the sociability apparatus. Specifically, complex wheel velocities for Fgf2 nulls improved significantly after removal of cuprizone from the diet. This improvement in Fgf2 null mice occurred following either acute (6 weeks) or chronic (12 weeks) demyelination. Plp/CreERT:Fgfr1(fl/fl) mice administered tamoxifen at 10 weeks of cuprizone treatment to induce Fgfr1 knockdown also showed improved recovery of running velocities on the complex wheels.

Understanding the mechanism of the angiogenic signaling pathway and neovascularization for breast cancer cell proliferation and growth would help to develop molecular interventions and achieve disease free survival. Our hypothesis is that the surviving cancer cell(s) after radiotherapy can initiate angiogenic signaling pathway in the neighboring endothelial cells resulting in neovascularization for breast cancer cell growth. The angiogenic signaling pathway is initiated by angiogenic factors, VEGF and FGF-2, through activation of a transcriptional regulator NF-κB, which in turn is triggered by therapeutic doses of radiation exposure Human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7 cells) were exposed to Cesium-137 ((137)Cs) γ rays to a total dose of 2 Gy at a dose rate of 1.03 Gy/min. The results of mobility shift assay showed that radiation at clinical doses (2 Gy) could induce NF-κB DNA-binding activity. Then, we examined the communication of angiogenic signals from irradiated MCF-7 cells to vascular endothelial cells. At the protein level, the western blot showed induction of angiogenic factors VEGF and FGF-2 in MCF-7 cells irradiated with 2 Gy. Inhibition of NF-κB activation attenuated VEGF and FGF-2 levels. These factors are secreted into the medium. The levels of VEGF and FGF-2 in the extra cellular medium were both increased, after 2 Gy exposures. We also observed corresponding expression of VEGFR2 and FGFR1 in non-irradiated endothelial cells that were co-cultured with irradiated MCF-7 cells. In support of this, in vitro tube formation assays provided evidence that irradiated MCF-7 cells transmit signals to potentiate cultured non-irradiated endothelial cells to form tube networks, which is the hallmark of neovascularization. Inhibition of NF-κB activation attenuated irradiated MCF-7-induced tube network formation. The data provide evidence that the radiation exposure is responsible for tumor growth and maintenance by inducing an angiogenic signaling pathway through activation of NF-κB.",

The results showed that single administration of YQFM (1.342 g/kg, i.p.) could reduce the brain infarction and improve the neurological deficits and the cerebral blood flow (CBF) after MCAO for 24 h in mice. Moreover, incubation with YQFM (100, 200, and 400 μg/mL) could increase the cell viability, decrease the caspase-3 activity, and inhibit the cell apoptosis in OGD-induced PC12 cells for 12 h. In addition, YQFM treatment could significantly modulate cleaved caspase-3 and Bcl-2 expressions and inhibit the expressions of ER stress-related marker proteins and signaling pathways in vivo and in vitro.

Concurrently, the level of FGFR2 gene expression is reduced and lost altogether in over 30% of cells, whereas all malignant cells abnormally express FGFR1, which is normally confined to stromal cells (S. Feng et al., Cancer Res., 57:5369-5378, 1997). To determine the relative roles of the FGFR2 and FGFR1 kinases in growth of malignant cells, we transfected malignant prostate epithelial cells with the wild-type FGFR2IIIb kinase and an artificial chimeric construct (FGFR2IIIb/R1) composed of the FGFR2IIIb ectodomain and the FGFR1 kinase domain. Population growth kinetics, in both the absence and presence of FGF-7, which binds only the FGFR2IIIb ectodomain, were then examined in the transfected cell populations. In contrast to the untransfected malignant tumor cells and those expressing the FGFR2IIIb/R1 chimera, FGF-7 caused a dose-dependent net inhibition of the population growth rates of cells expressing the full-length FGFR2IIIb kinase. The results suggest that although the FGFR2 kinase can mediate positive mitogenic effects, it mediates a net restriction on the growth of prostate tumor epithelial cells relative to FGFR1. Highly malignant prostate tumor cells, which have lost the FGFR2 tyrosine kinase, retain the cellular response mechanisms to it.

Comprehensive genomic profiling was performed using a hybrid-capture, adaptor ligation-based next generation sequencing assay to a mean coverage depth of 564X. The results were analyzed for all classes of genomic alterations (GA) including base substitutions, insertions and deletions, select rearrangements, and copy number changes. Clinically relevant genomic alterations were defined as those indicating possible treatment with anti-cancer drugs on the market or in registered clinical trials.;Samples were obtained from breast (11), lymph nodes (3), chest wall (2), liver (2), soft tissue (2), bone (1), and pleura (1). The median age of the 22 pmucBC patients was 57 years (range 32-79 years). Three pmucBCs were grade 1, 17 were grade 2, and 2 were grade 3. Twenty-one (95 %) pmucBC were ER+, 18 (82 %) were PR+, and 3 (14 %) were HER2+ by IHC and/or FISH. A total of 132 GA were identified (6.0 GA per tumor), including 53 CRGA, for a mean of 2.4 GA per tumor. Amplification of FGFR1 or ZNF703, located within the same amplicon, was found in 8 of 22 cases (36 %). This enrichment of FGFR1 amplification in 36 % of pmucBC versus 11 % of non-mucinous ER+ BC (601 cases) was significant (p < 0.005). Other frequently altered genes of interest in pmucBC were CCND1 and the FGF3/FGF4/FGF19 amplicon (27 %), often co-amplified together. ERBB2/HER2 alterations were identified in 5 pmucBC (23 %): ERBB2 amplification was found in 3 of 3 cases (100 %) that were HER2+ by IHC and/or FISH; 1 pmucBC was negative for HER2 overexpression by IHC, but positive for amplification by CGP; and 2 pmucBC harbored the ERBB2 substitutions D769Y and V777L (one sample also featured ERBB2 amplification). The enrichment of ERBB2 GA in metastatic pmucBC versus non-metastatic primary pmucBC was significant (p = 0.03). CRGA were also found in 20 additional genes including PIK3CA (5), BRCA1 (1), TSC2 (1), STK11 (1), AKT3 (1), and ESR1 (1).;Metastatic pmucBC is a distinct form of breast cancer that features a relatively high frequency of CRGA, including a significant enrichment of FGFR1 alterations and a high frequency of ERBB2 alterations when compared with non-metastatic pmucBC.

We demonstrated that flaky tail mice possess loss of function mutation in Filaggrin (Flg) which is one of the major component of stratum corneum, and showed skin barrier abnormality, although our genetically engineered Flg null mice did not develop dermatitis spontaneously. As a result of segregation of ft and ma mutations, we identified that ma mutation is responsible for the dermatitis phenotype in flaky tail mice, and Tmem79 nonsense mutation (Tmem79(ma)) is corresponding to the ma mutation. Tmem79 is expressed in outermost cell of stratum granulosum layer, and ma mice showed abnormal lamellar granule secretory system and abnormal formation of stratum corneum. Thus, Tmem79(ma/ma) mice provides a useful mouse model for spontaneous dermatitis caused by skin barrier gene deficiency. Further analysis for Tmem79(ma/ma) mice would elucidate important mechanisms for development of atopic dermatitis.",

We analyzed the binding of miR-100 to the 3'UTR of FGFR3 mRNA and its effects on FGFR3 translation by bioinformatics analysis and by luciferase-reporter assay, respectively. We modified miR-100 levels in a human nucleus pulposus SV40 cell line (HNPSV), and examined the effects on the expression of FGFR3 and MMP13, by RT-qPCR, Western blot and ELISA.;The levels of FGFR1 and miR-100 were significantly higher, while the levels of FGFR3 were significantly lower, in LDD discs, compared to the control non-LDD discs. The levels of FGFR3, but not the levels of FGFR1, inversely correlated with the levels of miR-100. Moreover, miR-100 was found to bind to the 3'UTR of FGFR3 mRNA to prevent its translation. In miR-100-modified HNPSV cells, we found that miR-100 decreased FGFR3 levels, and increased MMP13 levels.;miR-100 may activate MMP13 through 3'UTR-suppressoin of FGFR3 mRNA to facilitate development of LDD.",

The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling network plays a ubiquitous role in normal cell growth, survival, differentiation, and angiogenesis, but has also been implicated in tumor development. Elucidation of the roles and relationships within the diverse FGF family and of their links to tumor growth and progression will be critical in designing new drug therapies to target FGF receptor (FGFR) pathways. Recent studies have shown that FGF can act synergistically with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to amplify tumor angiogenesis, highlighting that targeting of both the FGF and VEGF pathways may be more efficient in suppressing tumor growth and angiogenesis than targeting either factor alone. In addition, through inducing tumor cell survival, FGF has the potential to overcome chemotherapy resistance highlighting that chemotherapy may be more effective when used in combination with FGF inhibitor therapy. Furthermore, FGFRs have variable activity in promoting angiogenesis, with the FGFR-1 subgroup being associated with tumor progression and the FGFR-2 subgroup being associated with either early tumor development or decreased tumor progression. This review highlights the growing knowledge of FGFs in tumor cell growth and survival, including an overview of FGF intracellular signaling pathways, the role of FGFs in angiogenesis, patterns of FGF and FGFR expression in various tumor types, and the role of FGFs in tumor progression.",

Most of the preclinical trials have been performed in young and healthy laboratory animals, even though age and hypertension are major risk factors for stroke. To determine the influence of age on the properties of BM MNCs after cerebral ischemia, we compared the efficacy of aged and young BM MNC in an in vitro model of cerebral hypoxia and in an adapted in vivo model of stroke. Human BM MNCs were obtained from healthy young or aged donors and either co-cultured with rat hippocampal slices exposed to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD), or transplanted intravenously 24 h after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in aged (18 months) spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Efficacy was examined by quantification of hippocampal cell death, or respectively, by neurofunctional tests and MR investigations. Co-cultivation with young, but not with aged BM MNCs significantly reduced the hippocampal cell death after OGD. Transplantation of both young and old BM MNCs did not reduce functional deficits or ischemic lesion volume after stroke in aged SHR. These results suggest a significant impact of age on the therapeutic efficacy of BM MNCs after cerebral ischemia.",

Cell apoptosis and protein expression of SGK1 were analyzed. To examine SGK1 function, we overexpressed SGK1 in rat hippocampal neurons. Finally we examined the involvement of PI3K/Akt/GSK3β signaling by treating the cells (untransfected or transfected with expression vector encoding SGK1) with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Findings were confirmed in vivo in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion.;I/R caused a time-dependent increase in apoptosis, both in vitro and in vivo. SGK1 protein levels decreased significantly under the same conditions. Overexpression of SGK1 reduced apoptosis following OGD or I/R compared to cells transfected with empty vector and subjected to the same treatment, or sham-operated animals.

        "Doc_abstract":"C5a receptors are found in the central nervous system (CNS), on both neurons and glia. However, the origin of the C5a, which activates these receptors, is unclear. In the present study, we show that primary cultured mouse cortical neurons constitutively express C5, the precursor of C5a, and express the classical receptor for C5a, CD88. With cell ischemia caused by 12 h glucose deprivation, or oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), neurons demonstrated increased apoptosis, up-regulation of CD88, and increased levels of C5a in the media. Exogenous murine C5a (100 nM) added to the neuronal cultures resulted in apoptosis, without affecting cell necrosis. Pretreatment of the cells with the specific CD88 receptor antagonist PMX53 (100 nM) significantly blocked ischemia-induced apoptosis (∼50%), and neurons from CD88(-/-) mice were similarly protected. In a murine model of stroke, using middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), we found that C5a levels in the brain increased; this also occurred in cerebral slice cultures exposed to OGD. CD88(-/-) mice subjected to MCAO had significantly reduced infarct volumes and improved neurological scores. Taken together, our results demonstrate that neurons in the CNS have the capability to generate C5a following ischemic stress, and this has the potential to activate their C5a receptors, with deleterious consequences.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Oxidative stress is a hallmark of ischemic stroke pathogenesis causing neuronal malfunction and cell death. Up-regulation of anti-oxidative genes through activation of the NF-E2-related transcription factor 2 (Nrf2) is one of the key mechanisms in cellular defense against oxidative stress. Fumaric acid esters (FAEs) represent a class of anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory molecules that are already in clinical use for multiple sclerosis therapy. Purpose of this study was to investigate whether FAEs promote neuronal survival upon ischemia, and analyze putative underlying molecular mechanisms in neurons. Murine organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, and two neuronal cell lines were treated with dimethyl fumarate (DMF) and monomethyl fumarate (MMF). Ischemic conditions were generated by exposing cells and slice cultures to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), and cell death was determined through propidium iodide staining. Treatment with both DMF and MMF immediately after OGD during reoxygenation strongly reduced cell death in hippocampal cultures ex vivo. Both DMF and MMF promoted neuronal survival in HT-22 and SH-SY5Y cell lines exposed to ischemic stress. DMF but not MMF activated the anti-oxidative Nrf2 pathway in neurons. Accordingly, Nrf2 knockdown in murine neurons abrogated the protective effect of DMF but not MMF. Moreover, FAEs did not activate the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway suggesting that this pathway may not significantly contribute to FAE mediated neuroprotection. Our results may provide the basis for a new therapeutic approach to treat ischemic pathologies such as stroke with a drug that already has a broad safety record in humans. ",

Here, we investigated the effects of hASCs-E in several experimental models of stroke in vitro (oxygen and glucose deprivation, OGD) and in vivo (transient or permanent focal cerebral ischemia and intracerebral hemorrhage, ICH). Ischemia was induced in vitro in Neuro2A cells, and the hASCs-E was applied 24h before the OGD or concurrently. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by unilateral intraluminal thread occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in rats for 90min or permanently, or by unilateral MCA microsurgical direct electrocoagulation in mice. The ICH model was induced with an intracerebral injection of collagenase in rats. The hASCs-E was intraperitoneally administered 1h after the stroke insults. Treatment of the hASCs-E led to a substantially high viability in the lactate dehydrogenase and WST-1 assays in the in vitro ischemic model. The cerebral ischemic and ICH model treated with hASCs-E showed decreased ischemic volume and reduced brain water content and hemorrhage volume. The ICH model treated with hASCs-E exhibited better performance on the modified limb placing test. The expression of many genes related to inflammation, immune response, and cell-death was changed substantially in the ischemic rats or neuronal cells treated with the hASCs-E. These results reveal a neuroprotective role of hASCs-E in animal models of stroke, and suggest the feasible application of stem cell-based, noninvasive therapy for treating stroke.",
