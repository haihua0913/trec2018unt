Mutations in the PTCH1 (PTCH) gene are responsible for NBCCS and are related in tumors associated with this syndrome. Mutations in the SMO gene have been identified in basal cell carcinoma and in medulloblastoma, both of which are features of NBCCS. To clarify the role of PTCH1 and SMO in KCOTs, we undertook mutational analysis of PTCH1 and SMO in 20 sporadic and 10 NBCCS-associated KCOTs, and for SMO, 20 additional cases of KCOTs with known PTCH1 status were also included. Eleven novel (1 of which occurred twice) and 5 known PTCH1 mutations were identified. However, no pathogenic mutation was detected in SMO. Our findings suggest that mutations are rare in SMO, but frequent in PTCH1 in sporadic and NBCCS-associated KCOTs.;NBCCS, nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome; KCOTs, keratocystic odontogenic tumors; BCCs, basal cell carcinomas.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is a common invasive skin lesion in Caucasians. Odontogenic keratocysts (OKs) are developmental, non-inflammatory oral cysts. They can be sporadic and/or multiple and are locally destructive. Basal cell naevus syndrome (BCNS) comprises both multiple BCCs and multiple OKs, in addition to several other systemic manifestations. The genetic defect underlying this autosomal dominant syndrome is a germ line mutation in the Sonic Hedgehog receptor PATCHED (PTCH) gene. For this study, a rabbit anti-peptide PTCH antiserum was produced. Immunohistochemistry procedures were performed using PTCH antibody and commercially produced GLI-1 antibody (downstream member in the hedgehog pathway) to stain 11 BCNS-OKs, eight sporadic OKs, two BCNS-BCCs, and six sporadic BCCs. Most of these lesions had been previously screened for PTCH mutation. Most BCCs (n=7) demonstrated moderate staining, with the heaviest staining in the outer palisading cell layer, except a BCNS-BCC which had mutation proximal to the sequence used for production of immunogenic peptide; this demonstrated only weak staining. Although moderate to heavy staining with PTCH antibody was demonstrated in the epithelium of both types of OK (n=19), a quite different pattern of staining of the basal cell layer was observed in the two patient groups. In BCNS, OK staining was heaviest in basal epithelial layers. In contrast, staining in non-BCNS odontogenic keratocysts was exclusively located in the superficial epithelial layers. Up-regulation of PTCH and GLI-1 protein was demonstrated in both BCCs and OKs. The pattern of PTCH expression matched the PTCH transcript pattern previously reported in BCCs and appeared sufficiently characteristic in OKs to allow differentiation between syndromic and non-syndromic cysts.",

Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PTCH1 are responsible for this autosomal dominant syndrome. In NBCCS patients, as in the general population, ultraviolet exposure is a major risk factor for BCC development. However these patients also develop BCCs in sun-protected areas of the skin, suggesting the existence of other mechanisms for BCC predisposition in NBCCS patients. As increasing evidence supports the idea that the stroma influences carcinoma development, we hypothesized that NBCCS fibroblasts could facilitate BCC occurence of the patients. WT (n = 3) and NBCCS fibroblasts bearing either nonsense (n = 3) or missense (n = 3) PTCH1 mutations were cultured in dermal equivalents made of a collagen matrix and their transcriptomes were compared by whole genome microarray analyses. Strikingly, NBCCS fibroblasts over-expressed mRNAs encoding pro-tumoral factors such as Matrix Metalloproteinases 1 and 3 and tenascin C. They also over-expressed mRNA of pro-proliferative diffusible factors such as fibroblast growth factor 7 and the stromal cell-derived factor 1 alpha, known for its expression in carcinoma associated fibroblasts. These data indicate that the PTCH1(+/-) genotype of healthy NBCCS fibroblasts results in phenotypic traits highly reminiscent of those of BCC associated fibroblasts, a clue to the yet mysterious proneness to non photo-exposed BCCs in NBCCS patients.",

For a deeper study, PTCH1 mutation screening from peripheral blood samples were performed by both bidirectional sequencing and multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) techniques. The proband and his mother carry 25 pb duplication in exon 10 (c.1375dupl25bp) that causes a reading frameshift with a premature stop codon.

The diagnosis of NBCCS was suspected based on the clinical examination, patient and family medical histories, and histopathological characteristics of the tumor. Radiotherapy was withheld. The diagnosis of NBCCS was confirmed by DNA testing, which revealed a novel mutation in the PTCH gene. This is the first report of an African-American child with MB diagnosed with NBCCS prior to radiotherapy. Although only a small number of patients with MB have NBCCS, the diagnosis must be considered because radiotherapy in such patients can lead to the formation of BCCs and other intracranial neoplasms within the irradiated field.

PTCH1, the human homolog of the Drosophila patched gene, was identified as a gene responsible for BCNS. The PTCH1 protein is a Hedgehog (Hh) protein receptor and is pivotal for early development, stem cell maintenance and/or differentiation. We analyzed the six Japanese families with BCNS and identified six germline mutations in the PTCH1 gene. One family had a nonsense mutation (c.1196G>A), one had a 1-bp deletion (c.2029delA), two had 2-bp deletions (c.239_240delGA and c.1670_1671delCA) and one had a 58-bp duplication (c.1138_1195dup). They caused premature termination, resulting in the truncation of the PTCH1 protein. Analysis of a high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mapping array showed a large approximately 1.2-Mb deletion, including the PTCH1 gene in one allele, in a family in which PTCH1 mutations were not identified at the sequence level. These data indicated that all the six families who were diagnosed with BCNS had mutations in the PTCH1 gene and that a single copy of a PTCH1 mutation causes BCNS.",

Here, we summarize information related to the pathogenesis of this neoplasm, discuss pathways that crosstalk with Shh signaling, and the importance of the primary cilium in this neoplastic process. The identification of the basic/translational components of Shh signaling has led to the discovery of potential mechanism-driven druggable targets and subsequent clinical trials have confirmed their remarkable efficacy in treating BCCs, particularly in patients with nevoid BCC syndrome (NBCCS), an autosomal dominant disorder in which patients inherit a germline mutation in the tumor-suppressor gene Patched (Ptch). Patients with NBCCS develop dozens to hundreds of BCCs due to derepression of the downstream G-protein-coupled receptor Smoothened (SMO). Ptch mutations permit transposition of SMO to the primary cilium followed by enhanced expression of transcription factors Glis that drive cell proliferation and tumor growth. Clinical trials with the SMO inhibitor, vismodegib, showed remarkable efficacy in patients with NBCCS, which finally led to its FDA approval in 2012.",

Recently, it has been shown that ultraviolet (UV) B exposure produced more BCCs in ptch knockout mice than wild mice.;To Investigate the role of UV in development of BCCs in NBCCS, cellular sensitivity to killing by UVB and removal of UVB-induced oxidative DNA damage were examined using fibroblasts derived from patients with NBCCS under physiologically relevant doses of UVB exposure.;Three patients with NBCCS, a 59-year-old male patient, an 18-year-old boy and a 13-year-old boy were examined by photobiological analysis. Cellular sensitivity to killing by UVB and UVC and removal of oxidative DNA damage caused by UVB were tested using fibroblasts derived from these patients. We measured cellular 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) after UVB exposure up to 24 h after UVB exposure using high-performance liquid chromatography.;All three cell strains derived from the patients with NBCCS were hypersensitive to killing by UVB (D10: 50-70% of normal) but not by UVC. After UVB exposure, the production of 8-OHdG increased dose dependently up to 3200 J m-2 in both NBCCS cells and normal cells. In normal cells, 8-OHdG after UVB exposure returned to its basal level during 24 h, whereas in NBCCS cells the amount of 8-OHdG after 800 J m-2 of UVB exposure did not return to its basal level even after 24 h. The result indicates the removal of 8-OHdG could be impaired in NBCCS cells. Ability in removal of thymine dimers of NBCCS cells was similar to that of normal cells.;Hypersensitivity to UVB can be one of the diagnostic tools of NBCCS for those whose clinical features have not yet completed. Hypersensitivity to cell killing and the impairment of removal of 8-OHdG after UVB exposure may play some role in developing BCCs and other tumours in NBCCS.",

Medulloblastomas, primitive neuroectodermal tumours (PNETs) arising in childhood, occur in about 3-5% of NBCCS patients and a subset of PNETs was previously found with allelic imbalance at 9q22-q23, the region containing the gene for NBCCS (PTCH). We have analysed tumour DNA samples from 37 unrelated patients with sporadic PNETs and five medulloblastoma cell lines for PTCH mutations using an exon-by-exon single strand conformation polymorphism assay. We found three missense mutations, which affect conserved residues in transmembrane domains of the gene product and in the extracellular loop implicated in binding sonic hedgehog, one 2 bp deletion and an exon skipping splice site mutation. Most mutations were associated with the absence of the wild-type allele and were found in tumours exhibiting loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at loci flanking PTCH. The finding of LOH at 9q22-q23 in most mutated tumours while present in only three out of 26 tumours, in which a mutation was not identified, implicates PTCH as the target gene in PNETs with LOH at 9q22-q23 and deficient PTCH in the development of a subset of these tumours. Since all observed mutations were absent in the germ-line, a sporadic medulloblastoma developing as the first symptom of NBCCS is likely to be a very uncommon event.",

In this study, we determined the whole genomic organizations of the PTCHgene and developed a new set of more accurate primers for the analysis of mutations in PTCH. Using these primers, we examined 8 Japanese NBCCS patients for mutations in all PTCH exons by direct sequencing of the PCR products. As a result, we identified 5 novel PTCH mutations in 6 out of 8 patients including 2 sisters as well as 5 polymorphisms, two of them, 1704G>C and 2928G>C were novel. Four of these mutations, 900delC, 1247insT, 1999delC and 933+5G>T, cause protein truncation due to the insertion or deletion of a single nucleotide or aberrant splicing. The remaining mutation, 1514G>A was a missense alteration (G509D). Interestingly, the amino acid substitution, G509V, has been reported previously in an NBCCS patient, suggesting an important role of this amino acid residue in the function of PTCH protein. The difference in the detection rate of PTCH mutations among NBCCS between previous reports and ours is due to the difference either in ethnicity or in the detection methods.",

Therefore ODC is a potentially important target for chemoprevention of basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), the majority of which have mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene known as patched (PTCH). To assess this possibility, we first overexpressed ODC in the skin of Ptch1+/- mice using a keratin 6 (K6) promoter that directs constitutive ODC expression in the outer root sheath of the hair follicle. UVB irradiation of these mice accelerated induction of BCCs as compared with their Ptch1+/- littermates. To further verify the role of ODC in BCC tumorigenesis, we used an antizyme (AZ) approach to inhibit ODC activity in the Ptch1+/- mice. Ptch1+/- mice with AZ overexpression driven by the K6 promoter were resistant to the induction of BCCs by UVB. Furthermore, oral administration of the suicidal ODC inhibitor alpha-difluoromethylornithine reduced UVB-induced BCCs in Ptch1+/- mice. These results demonstrate the crucial importance of ODC for the induction of BCCs and indicate that chemopreventive strategies directed at inhibiting this enzyme may be useful in reducing BCCs in human populations.",

However, due to embryonic lethality associated with the Ptc1 null mutation, its normal function in embryonic and adult skin remains unknown. Here we describe the epidermal phenotypes of a spontaneous and viable allele of Ptc1, Ptc1(mes), in which the C-terminal domain (CTD) is truncated. Ptc1(mes/mes) embryos display normal epidermal and hair follicle development. Postnatal Ptc1(mes/mes) skin displays severe basal cell layer hyperplasia and increased proliferation, while stratification of the suprabasal layers is mostly normal. Interestingly, truncation of the Ptc1 CTD did not result in skin tumors. However, long term labeling studies revealed a greater than three-fold increase in label-retaining cells in the interfollicular epidermis of Ptc1(mes/mes) adults, indicating possible expansion of the epidermal stem cell compartment. Increased expression of regulators of epidermal homeostasis, c-Myc and p63, was also observed in Ptc1(mes/mes) adult skin. These results suggest that the CTD of Ptc1 is involved in regulating epidermal homeostasis in mature skin.",

We identified 28 mutations that are distributed throughout the entire gene, and most (86%) cause protein truncation. As part of this analysis, we demonstrate that failure of one NBCCS family to show clear linkage to chromosome 9q22.3-31 is most likely due to germinal mosaicism. We have identified three families bearing identical mutations with variable phenotypes, suggesting phenotypic variability in NBCCS is a complex genetic event. No phenotype genotype correlation between the position of truncation mutations and major clinical features was evident. Two missense mutations have been identified, and their location within transmembrane domains supports the notion that PTCH may have a transport function.

We investigated the detailed clinical manifestations of 157 patients ranging in age from 9 months to 77 years old (mean: 33.1 years). We then compared the frequency and age of onset for various tumors developed in Japanese NBCCS patients with patients from the three countries listed above in which NBCCS studies were previously conducted. Our most significant finding was the low frequency of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in Japanese patients. Frequency of BCC in patients over 20 years of age was 51.4%, a much lower rate compared to the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom (91%, 85%, and 73%, respectively). The mean age of BCC onset was 37.4 years of age, a much older age compared to the above-mentioned countries.

About 70% sporadic BCCs bear somatic mutations in the PATCHED1 tumor suppressor gene which encodes the receptor for the Sonic Hedgehog morphogen (SHH). PATCHED1 germinal mutations are associated with the dominant Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome (NBCCS), a major hallmark of which is a high susceptibility to BCCs. Although the vast majority of sporadic BCCs arises exclusively in sun exposed skin areas, 40 to 50% BCCs from NBCCS patients develop in non photo-exposed skin. Since overwhelming evidences indicate that microenvironment may both be modified by- and influence the- epithelial tumor, we hypothesized that NBCCS fibroblasts could contribute to BCCs in NBCCS patients, notably those developing in non photo-exposed skin areas. The functional impact of NBCCS fibroblasts was then assessed in organotypic skin cultures with control keratinocytes. Onset of epidermal differentiation was delayed in the presence of primary NBCCS fibroblasts. Unexpectedly, keratinocyte proliferation was severely reduced and showed high levels of nuclear P53 in both organotypic skin cultures and in fibroblast-led conditioning experiments. However, in spite of increased levels of senescence associated β-galactosidase activity in keratinocytes cultured in the presence of medium conditioned by NBCCS fibroblasts, we failed to observe activation of P16 and P21 and then of bona fide features of senescence. Constitutive extinction of P53 in WT keratinocytes resulted in an invasive phenotype in the presence of NBCCS fibroblasts. Finally, we found that expression of SHH was limited to fibroblasts but was dependent on the presence of keratinocytes. Inhibition of SHH binding resulted in improved epidermal morphogenesis. Altogether, these data suggest that the repertoire of diffusible factors (including SHH) expressed by primary NBCCS fibroblasts generate a stress affecting keratinocytes behavior and epidermal homeostasis. Our findings suggest that defects in dermo/epidermal interactions could contribute to BCC susceptibility in NBCCS patients. ",

We also sought to confirm the findings by sequencing the PTCH1 gene from DNA extracted from the paraffin-embedded tissue of these cases. Seven cases of paraffin-embedded CEOT specimens were analyzed with immunohistochemistry. Immunoreactivity for Sonic hedgehog pathway proteins was evaluated using antibodies to the receptor PTCH as well as to the transcription factors Gli1 and Gli2. A keratocystic odontogenic tumor (KOT) from a 12year-old with NBCCS served as our positive control. Normal salivary gland tissue served as our negative control. PTCH gene sequencing was completed using PCR. Immunoreactivity to PTCH was seen in 6/7 cases, to Gli1 in 6/7 cases and to Gli2 in 6/7 cases. All three proteins were positive in the syndromic KOT and all proteins were negative in normal salivary tissue. Gene sequencing revealed five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of which two resulted in missense mutations. A missense mutation was also detected in the KOT.

NBCCS is a rare autosomal dominantly inherited disease mainly characterized by multiple basal cell carcinomas, KCOTs of the jaws and a variety of other tumors. PTCH1 mutation can be found both in sporadic or NBCCS associated KCOTs. The aim of the current study was to assess whether a combined clinical and bio-molecular approach could be suitable for the detection of NBCCS among patients with a diagnosis of keratocystic odontogenic tumors (KCOTs). The authors collected keratocystic odontogenic tumors recorded in the database of the Pathology Department of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia during the period 1991-2011. Through interviews and examinations, family pedigrees were drawn for all patients affected by these odontogenic lesions. We found out that 18 of the 70 patients with KCOTs and/or multiple basal cell carcinomas actually met the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of NBCCS. A wide inter- and intra-familial phenotypic variability was evident in the families. Ameloblastomas (AMLs) were reported in two probands that are also carriers of the PCTH1 germline mutations. Nine germline mutations in the PTCH1 gene, 5 of them novel, were evident in 14 tested probands. The clinical evaluation of the keratocystic odontogenic tumors can be used as screening for the detection of families at risk of NBCCS.

Another NBCCS-associated cancer is medulloblastoma, a common central nervous system tumor in children. Most medulloblastomas, however, occur without indication of an inherited predisposition. We have examined 24 sporadic medulloblastomas for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at loci flanking as well as within PTCH.

Microsatellite analysis indicated LOH of PTCH in 5 of 24 tumors, and in three of these cases a mutation of the remaining allele was identified. Two of the mutations were duplication insertions, and the third consisted of a single base deletion. It is interesting that all three mutations occur in exon 17 of the PTCH gene.

The present study is aimed at evaluating whether deregulation of PTCH mRNA expression is a general feature of BCCs of varying histological growth pattern and malignant potential. Irrespective of histological subtype, PTCH mRNA was overexpressed consistently as determined by in situ hybridization in all of the sporadic (n = 16) and hereditary (n = 20) tumors examined. PTCH expression was found in all of the tumor cells but appeared stronger in the peripheral palisading cells. PTCH mRNA was not detected in adjacent nontumor epidermal cells or in other parts of the epidermis. In the majority of tumors (20 of 36), nuclear immunostaining for p53 was found in scattered cells, whereas seven tumors completely lacked p53 immunoreactivity.

In addition, a subset of 45 primary breast tumours was analysed for mutations in the PTCH coding region and 48 samples in previously implicated exons of human smoothened, but no mutations were found. Although our results do not exclude the presence of clonal alterations of these genes in a small proportion of breast carcinomas, these data do not support the existence of frequent mutations in genes encoding major protein partners of this signalling pathway.

Mutations in some of these genes have been shown to cause cancer. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of the skin is the most common cancer in humans. More than 750000 new cases are diagnosed annually, and the incidence is rising. BCCs are slow-growing, locally invasive tumors that rarely metastasize but can result in extensive morbidity through local recurrence and tissue destruction. Epidemiologic studies suggest that sunlight (particularly UVB radiation) is a strong risk factor for BCC formation, although other factors are also involved. The nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS), a rare genetic disorder, is characterized by predisposition to BCCs and other tumors as well as to a wide range of developmental defects. NBCCS maps to chromosome 9q22.3, and loss of heterozygosity at this site in both sporadic and hereditary BCCs suggests that it functions as a tumor suppressor. The gene for NBCCS was recently cloned and is the human homologue of the Drosophila gene \"patched.\" Genetic studies in Drosophila show that patched is part of the hedgehog signaling pathway, which is important in determining embryonic patterning and cell fate in multiple structures of the developing embryo. Human patched is mutated in both hereditary and sporadic BCCs, and inactivation of this gene is probably a necessary, if not sufficient, step for BCC formation. Delineation of the biochemical pathway in which patched functions may lead to rational medical therapy for BCCs and possibly for other tumors associated with NBCCS.",

The gene responsible for NBCCS is PTCH1. The development of meningioma in NBCCS patients is a rare event. Here, we report two cases of NBCCS in which meningiomas did develop. The first patient carried a germline mutation in one allele of PTCH1, c.290dupA (p.N97KfsX43). In addition, the meningioma sample carried a somatic mutation, c.307delG (p.Val103LeufsX15), in the other allele of the same gene, suggesting a second hit. This is the first case of NBCCS-associated meningioma explained by the standard two-hit hypothesis. The second patient had a germline nonsense mutation in the SUFU gene, c.550C>T (p.Q184X). SUFU is located downstream of PTCH1 in the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway. This is the second time a germline mutation in SUFU has been found to cause NBCCS. Together with the previous report describing three cases of non-NBCCS medulloblastoma carrying a germline mutation in this gene, individuals with a SUFU germline mutation are expected to have a markedly high risk of developing medulloblastoma and probably meningioma.",

Hahn et al., Cell, 85: 841-851, 1996; R. L. Johnson et al., Science (Washington DC), 272: 1668-1671, 1996). In addition to multiple BCCs, patients with nevoid BCC syndrome have a predisposition for the development of primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) of the central nervous system. We have analyzed 9 sporadic BCCs and 37 PNETs for mutation and expression of the PTCH gene. PTCH mutations were found in 3 BCCs (33.3%) and in 5 PNETs (14%), including 1 of 5 cerebral PNETs, 2 of 15 medulloblastomas, and 2 of 17 desmoplastic medulloblastomas. The sequence changes in six of these tumors (four PNETs, two BCCs) were mutations predicted to result in truncated proteins. Missense mutations were detected in one PNET and one BCC each. In addition, novel sequence polymorphisms were found in exon 2, intron 5, intron 10, and intron 14 of PTCH. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed increased PTCH expression levels compared to nonneoplastic brain tissue and normal skin in the majority of PNETs and BCCs investigated. Our data suggest that genetic alterations of PTCH are not only of significance in hereditary and sporadic BCCs but are also involved in the molecular pathogenesis of a subset of sporadic central nervous system PNETs.",

Like squamous cell carcinomas, they are also believed to be ultraviolet (UV)-induced, but several data suggest that some differences might exist in the mechanisms of their UV induction. The originating cells may arise from interfollicular basal cells, hair follicles or sebaceous glands, thus from a deeper zone than the SCC ones, which probably means exposure to different doses or wavelengths of UV. The p53 gene and the patched gene (PTCH) are major targets of UV for BCC induction. Mutations in p53 are present in about 56% of human BCC, even small early lesions. The \"UV signature\" is observed in 65% of them. Mutations in the PTCH play also a major role in BCC development, being responsible for hereditary BCCs in Gorlin's syndrome, sporadic BCC, and BCCs isolated from xeroderma pigmentosum, although with a lower incidence of \"UV signature\". Smoothened-activating mutations and PTCH2 mutations are also involved in BCC formation. Transgenic mice overexpressing Smoothened or Sonic hedgehog in the skin spontaneously produce skin lesions resembling human BCCs, but contrary to findings in the hairless albino mouse and with SCC, no data on experimental UV induction of BCCs are available.",

To determine whether certain tumorigenic fingerprints and potentially predisposing patched (PTCH) tumor suppressor single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are distributed differently among sporadic BCC patients, we compared the PTCH mutation spectra in early-onset BCC (first lesion at age < 35 years), regular BCC (first lesion at age > or = 35 years and < 10 lesions), and multiple BCC (> or = 10 lesions). The PTCH gene was mutated in 29 of 60 cases (48%). Most of the PTCH mutations bore the UV fingerprint (i.e., C --> T or tandem CC --> TT transitions at dipyrimidine sites). However, neither the proportion nor the spectra of exonic PTCH mutations differed significantly among the three groups. A large number of SNPs (IVS10+99C/T, IVS11-51G/C, 1665T/C, 1686C/T, IVS15+9G/C, IVS16-80G/C, IVS17+21G/A, and 3944C/T or its combinations) were also detected, but again their incidence did not differ significantly among the groups. Interestingly, expression of the IVS16-80G/C and the IVS17+21G/A genotype did not achieve the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in patients with regular and/or early-onset BCC. These data suggest that a (UV-) mutated PTCH gene is important for sporadic BCC formation independent of clinical phenotype and that the IVS16-80G/C and/or IVS17+21G/A SNP site might be important for tumorigenesis in certain BCC patients.",

Such a response is well-documented in Caucasian NBCCS patients with medulloblastoma. The propositus was diagnosed with medulloblastoma at the age of 2 years and underwent surgery, chemotherapy, and craniospinal irradiation. At the age of 6 years, he was diagnosed with NBCCS following his presentation with a large odontogenic keratocyst of the mandible, pits of the palms and soles and numerous BCCs in the area of the back and neck that had been irradiated previously for medulloblastoma. Examination of other relatives showed that the propositus' mother also had NBCCS but was more mildly affected; in particular, she had no BCCs. This case illustrates complex gene-environment interaction, in that increased skin pigmentation in African-Americans is presumably protective against ultraviolet, but not ionizing, radiation. This case and other similar cases in the literature show the importance of considering NBCCS in the differential diagnosis of any patient who presents with a medulloblastoma, especially before the age of 5 years, and of examining other close relatives for signs of NBCCS to determine the patient's at-risk status. Finally, for individuals who are radiosensitive, protocols that utilize chemotherapy in lieu of radiotherapy should be considered.",

It is characterized by developmental defects and a predisposition to the development of certain tumours, such as basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma and meningioma, and potentially fetal rhabdomyomas and embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas. This study aimed to analyse PTCH status in an NBCCS patient with fetal rhabdomyoma and to investigate whether deregulation of hedgehog signalling, as shown by altered expression of hedgehog pathway components and/or genetic imbalances, is a general finding in sporadic rhabdomyomas and rhabdomyosarcomas. The NBCCS patient had a novel PTCH germ-line mutation, 1370insT, and developed a fetal rhabdomyoma that harboured a 30 bp in-frame deletion in the second allele resulting in homozygous inactivation of PTCH. Sporadic rhabdomyomas and rhabdomyosarcomas showed overexpression of PTCH (43/43) and GLI1 (41/43) mRNA, as determined by in situ hybridization, indicating ongoing active hedgehog signalling. Immunohistochemical staining revealed a subgroup of fetal rhabdomyomas and embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas (12/34) lacking PTCH immunoreactivity. Four of nine informative fetal rhabdomyomas and embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas showed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the PTCH region with two of these (one fetal rhabdomyoma and one embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma) also showing LOH in the SUFU region. These findings suggest that haploinsufficiency for the two tumour suppressor genes PTCH and SUFU, which are both active in the same signalling pathway, may be important for tumour development.

The sensitivity of three different methods, including direct bisulphite sequencing PCR, MethyLight and high-resolution melting (HRM), was applied and compared. We found that HRM analysis of DNA from fresh tissue [rather than formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPE)] was the most sensitive method to detect methylation. Low-level methylation of the PTCH promoter was detected in five out of 16 analysed BCCs (31%) on DNA from fresh tissue but only in two (13%) samples on short-time stored FFPE DNA from the very same tumors. In contrast, we were unable to detect methylation by HRM on long-time stored DNA in any of the remaining 40 BCC samples.

To clarify the role of PTCH1 in OKCs, mutational analysis was undertaken in eight sporadic and four NBCCS-associated OKCs and six PTCH1 mutations were identified in two sporadic and three NBCCS-associated cases. The epithelial cell proliferation as assessed by Ki67 labeling was studied in a total cohort of 62 OKCs (42 sporadic and 20 syndromic cases) with known PTCH1 status.

Furthermore, OKCs harboring PTCH1 truncation-causing mutations showed an even greater Ki67 labeling index than those with non-truncation-causing mutations.

Analysis of Drosophila mutants indicates that patched interacts with the hedgehog signalling pathway, repressing the expression of various hedgehog target genes including wingless, decapentaplegic and patched itself. Using single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) to screen human patched in 37 sporadic BCCs, we detected mutations in one-third of the tumours. Direct sequencing of two BCCs without SSCP variants revealed mutations in those tumours as well suggesting that inactivation of patched is probably a necessary step in BCC development.

To investigate whether azathioprine-associated mutagenesis contributes to the high incidence of skin tumours in organ transplant recipients (OTRs), we analysed PTCH gene mutations in 60 basal cell carcinomas (BCC); 39 from OTRs receiving azathioprine and 21 from individuals never exposed to azathioprine. PTCH was mutated in 55% of all tumours, independent of azathioprine treatment. In both the azathioprine and non-azathioprine groups, transitions at dipyrimidine sequences, considered to indicate mutation by ultraviolet-B radiation, occurred frequently in tumours from chronically sun-exposed skin. In BCC from non-sun-exposed skin of azathioprine-treated patients, there was an over-representation of unusual G:C to A:T transitions at non-dipyrimidine sites. These were exclusive to the azathioprine-exposed group and all in the same TGTC sequence context at different positions within PTCH. Meta-analysis of 247 BCCs from published studies indicated that these mutations are rare in sporadic BCC and had never previously been reported in this specific sequence context. This study of post-transplant BCC provides the first indication that azathioprine exposure may be associated with PTCH mutations, particularly in tumours from non-sun-exposed skin.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS), also known as Gorlin syndrome, is a hereditary condition characterized by a wide range of developmental abnormalities and a predisposition to neoplasms. The estimated prevalence varies from 1/57,000 to 1/256,000, with a male-to-female ratio of 1:1. Main clinical manifestations include multiple basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), odontogenic keratocysts of the jaws, hyperkeratosis of palms and soles, skeletal abnormalities, intracranial ectopic calcifications, and facial dysmorphism (macrocephaly, cleft lip/palate and severe eye anomalies). Intellectual deficit is present in up to 5% of cases. BCCs (varying clinically from flesh-colored papules to ulcerating plaques and in diameter from 1 to 10 mm) are most commonly located on the face, back and chest. The number of BBCs varies from a few to several thousand. Recurrent jaw cysts occur in 90% of patients. Skeletal abnormalities (affecting the shape of the ribs, vertebral column bones, and the skull) are frequent. Ocular, genitourinary and cardiovascular disorders may occur. About 5-10% of NBCCS patients develop the brain malignancy medulloblastoma, which may be a potential cause of early death. NBCCS is caused by mutations in the PTCH1 gene and is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with complete penetrance and variable expressivity. Clinical diagnosis relies on specific criteria. Gene mutation analysis confirms the diagnosis. Genetic counseling is mandatory. Antenatal diagnosis is feasible by means of ultrasound scans and analysis of DNA extracted from fetal cells (obtained by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling). Main differential diagnoses include Bazex syndrome, trichoepithelioma papulosum multiplex and Torre's syndrome (Muir-Torre's syndrome). Management requires a multidisciplinary approach. Keratocysts are treated by surgical removal. Surgery for BBCs is indicated when the number of lesions is limited; other treatments include laser ablation, photodynamic therapy and topical chemotherapy. Radiotherapy should be avoided. Vitamin A analogs may play a preventive role against development of new BCCs. Life expectancy in NBCCS is not significantly altered but morbidity from complications can be substantial. Regular follow-up by a multi-specialist team (dermatologist, neurologist and odontologist) should be offered. Patients with NBCCS should strictly avoid an excessive sun exposure.",

The Sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway is implicated in the etiology of the most common human cancer, the basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Mutations in the receptor of SHH, the patched gene (PTCH), have been characterized in sporadic BCCs as well as those from patients with the rare genetic syndrome nevoid BCC.

When the transcripts were examined, all mutations resulted in aberrant splicing, including exon skipping or the activation of cryptic splice sites. This is the first extensive report of NBCCS focusing on splice site mutations, and it highlights the importance of analyzing transcripts especially for mutations lying outside the GT-AG splicing consensus site.

The population investigated comprised 126 BCC patients who were enrolled on the basis of specific criteria (multiple and/or familial BCC and/or onset before the age of 40 years and/or association with another tumor)--and 151 controls matched for ethnicity, age, and sex. MC1R variants appeared as a moderate risk factor for BCC (odds ratio (OR) for one and two variants, 2.17 [1.28-3.68] and 7.72 [3.42-17.38], respectively), independently of pigmentation characteristics (OR = 2.53 [1.34-4.8]). Interestingly, in addition to the predictable red hair color (RHC) alleles, two non-RHC alleles (V60L and V92M) were also closely associated with BCC risk (OR 3.21 [1.91-5.38] and 2.87 [1.5-5.48], respectively), which differs from the situation in the Celtic population. In addition, the PTCH c.3944C/C genotype was also associated with BCC risk (OR 1.94 [1.2-3.1]), especially in the subgroup of patients with multiple tumors (OR 2.16 [1.3-3.6]). Thus, our data show that MC1R and PTCH variants are associated with BCC risk in the French population.

Most BCCs are caused by mutational inactivation of the tumor suppressor Patched (PTCH), which results in activation of Smoothened (SMO) and of the Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway. Recent studies indicate that BCC progression involves a crosstalk between Hh signaling, vitamin D derivatives and the vitamin D receptor (Vdr) signaling pathway. This has been demonstrated in BCC-bearing Ptch mutant mice and BCC cell lines, in which both vitamin D3 and its active metabolite calcitriol (1alpha-25(OH)2D3) exert antitumor effects. Interestingly, the antitumor effects are mainly ascribed to an inhibition of Hh signaling. Furthermore, as evident from studies in Vdr deficient mice, calcitriol may also repress the activity of Hh signaling in a Vdr-dependent fashion thereby establishing an additional inhibitory feedback on Hh signaling activity. In this chapter, we discuss the current understanding and controversial findings of the inhibition of Hh signaling by vitamin D derivatives and the implication of these findings for BCC carcinogenesis.",

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1) is a nuclear enzyme that plays a multifunctional role in DNA damage signaling and repair. In healthy and fertile PARP-1-null mice, radiation exposure reveals an extreme sensitivity and a high genomic instability. To test for interactions between PARP-1 and sonic hedgehog signaling, PARP-1-null mice were crossed to Ptc1 heterozygous mice. PARP-1 deletion further accelerated medulloblastoma development in irradiated Ptc1(+/-) mice, showing that PARP-1 inactivation sensitizes cerebellar cells to radiation tumorigenic effects. In addition to increased formation and slowed down kinetics of disappearance of gamma-H2AX foci, we observed increased apoptosis in PARP-1-deficient granule cell progenitors after irradiation. Double-mutant mice were also strikingly more susceptible to BCC, with >50% of animals developing multiple, large, infiltrative tumors within 30 weeks of age.

The sheer numbers of such lesions in these patients makes traditional therapeutic modalities like surgery, impractical. Topical photodynamic therapy (PDT) with δ-5-amino levulinic acid has increasingly been recognised as and safe and effective choice in the treatment of BCC. The probability of local control of BCC treated by PDT depends strongly on lesion thickness, thick nodular lesions being less responsive. Response to treatment is monitored by the reduction in the lesional size, but histopathological confirmation of regression is often required.;We used systemic photodynamic therapy with Porfimer Sodium (Photofrin(®), Axcan Pharma Inc., Quebec, Canada), a systemic photosensitizer for treating multiple BCC in seven patients with NBCCS. Treatment response was monitored using a high resolution 20MHz ultrasound.;There was a substantial reduction in the number of superficial basal cell carcinomas with complete US regression after one treatment. A 74.2% reduction was seen in the size of thick lesions treated with external light. Thick nodular lesions in two patients treated with interstitial optical diffuser fibres in addition to external light showed 87.6% reduction in size as measured by high resolution ultrasound.;Our preliminary results indicate that systemic photodynamic therapy using Photofrin and external light either alone or with interstitial optical diffuser fibres; may be effective in treatment of multiple, thick and nodular BCC lesions in Naevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. Further studies are needed to confirm our observations. We found high resolution ultrasound an effective alternative to histopathological analysis in monitoring the response to treatment.",

Microscopic nodular BCC-like tumors were also enhanced by irradiation during active hair-follicle growth phases. Interestingly, histologic examination of the tumors revealed a qualitative difference in BCC tumorigenesis depending on hair growth phase at the time of exposure. In fact, in addition to typical BCC-like tumors, we observed development of a distinct basal cell tumor subtype characterized by anti-cytokeratin 14 and anti-smooth muscle actin reactivity. These tumors showed relatively short latency and rapid growth and were strictly dependent on age at irradiation, as they occurred only in mice irradiated in early anagen phase. Examination of anatomic and immunohistochemical relationships revealed a close relation of these tumors with the follicular outer root sheath of anagen skin. In contrast, there are strong indications for the derivation of typical, smooth muscle actin-negative BCC-like tumors from cell progenitors of interfollicular epidermis.

To monitor splicing events of the PTCH gene, we designed oligonucleotide arrays on which exon probes and exon-exon junction probes as well as a couple of intron probes for the PTCH gene were placed in duplicate. Probe intensities were normalized on the basis of the total expression of PTCH and probe sensitivity. Tissue-specific regulation of AS identified with the microarrays closely correlated with the results obtained by RT-PCR. Of note, the novel exon, exon 12b, was specifically expressed in the brain and heart, especially in the cerebellum. Additionally, using these microarrays, we were able to detect disease-associated aberrant splicings of the PTCH gene in two patients with NBCCS. In both cases, cryptic splice donor sites located either in an exon or in an intron were activated because of the partial disruption of the consensus sequence for the authentic splice donor sites due to point mutations.

The identification of t(9;16)(q22;p13) as a primary chromosomal abnormality in a subset of BCCs (we found it in 3 of 22 tumors) is especially intriguing against the background that the PTCH gene, which when mutated in the germ line presumably gives rise to the autosomal dominant basal cell nevus or Gorlin's syndrome, maps to chromosome band 9q22. None of the genes rearranged in the BCC-specific t(9;16)(q22;p13) translocation have been identified, but we hypothesize that the translocation represents the cytogenetic corollary of a tumorigenic recombination of PTCH with an as yet unknown gene in 16p13. If so, this would be the first time that a tumor suppressor gene causally involved in a hereditary cancer is shown to be frequently rearranged through a specific translocation in sporadic carcinomas of the same type.",

Ten patients were included in the study: 4 had Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), 4 had basal cell naevus syndrome (BCN), and there was 1 case each of porokeratosis of Mibelli (PM) and familial epitheliomatosis of Ferguson-Smith (EFS). All recorded carcinomas had been cured before treatment was initiated. The number of epitheliomas which developed during treatment with etretinate was compared with the number of epitheliomas recorded during the months or years preceding this treatment or during trial periods without treatment. The results obtained were very encouraging: 1. In patients with XP the actinic keratosis rapidly regressed, and the dryness of the skin was markedly reduced during the 5 years under etretinate. During the period without etretinate skin dryness and multiple actinic keratosis soon reappeared, as did, in one case, numerous basal cell carcinomas (BCC). However, etretinate did not prevent the occurrence of a malignant melanoma and of a few lesions of lentigo and naevus. 2. In the first case of BCN concerning two sisters, one treated the other untreated, less BCC lesions and, mainly, less BCN lesions were recorded in the sister treated than in the untreated sister. In the second case of BCN 28 BCC lesions developed while the patient was under observation without any treatment during 6 months, whereas only 31 BCC lesions had been recorded during 6 years under etretinate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Additional analysis of PTCH mutations in the subset of eight basal call carcinomas (BCC) revealed a very high mutation frequency of this gene (90%) which exceeded that detected in the p53 gene in the same tumors (38%). PTCH mutations were predominantly UV-specific C>T transitions. This mutation pattern is different from that reported in BCC from normal donors where PTCH mutation frequency is 27% and mutations are frequently deletions and insertions. These findings suggest that PTCH mutations represent an earlier event in BCC development than p53 alterations and that the inability of XP patients to repair UV-induced PTCH mutations might significantly contribute to the early and frequent appearance of BCC observed in these patients.",

All lesions were evaluated preoperatively with an instrument measuring electrical impedance (IMP). Methods for determining transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and laser Doppler (LD) were also used. Measurements were also made in healthy skin on the contralateral side as reference. The diagnosis was confirmed by histological examination.;We found clear differences between the lesions and their reference values, using all three bioengineering techniques for NBCC and SBCC. The biophysical parameters of all types vary with anatomical location. Since most of the NBCC were located on the face and most SBCC on the trunk, their baseline impedance characteristics (i.e., impedance indices magnitude index (MIX) and imaginary part index (IMIX)) differed significantly. We therefore compared delta (a difference between the reference and tumour) MIX and IMIX of NBCC and SBCC instead of the absolute figures. We found no significant differences in TEWL, blood flow and IMP between the two types of BCC and attribute this to biological variation and electromagnetic noise.;As with LD and TEWL, definite differences in IMP were detected between healthy skin and BCC lesions. However, at this stage of development of the bioimpedance technique, we were unable to distinguish between the two types of BCC.

Thus far only the point mutations in the P53 gene from squamous cell carcinomas and BCCs, and in PTCH gene from BCC of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) patients appear to be unambiguously attributable to solar UV radiation.

Ovarian fibromas in NBCCS before puberty are very rare. We report a 6-year-old prepubescent girl with NBCCS showing skeletal abnormalities, medulloblastoma, and ovarian fibromas. The patient was referred to our hospital owing to abdominal distension. On admission, a huge elastic hard tumor was palpable and computed tomography showed a huge tumor of the left ovary. We performed a left salpingo-oophorectomy and diagnosed the tumor as a benign fibroma. Further examination of the computed tomography images showed skeletal abnormalities. In addition, the patient had a history of medulloblastoma at the age of 4 years. Therefore, we diagnosed NBCCS. A genetic examination indicated a novel 1 bp deletion in exon 18 (c.3055delG). Sequence analysis of exon 18 using DNA from the ovarian tumor revealed a mutant allele (c.3055delG) dominant to the wild-type allele, thus suggesting loss of heterozygosity in the PTCH1 gene, which is known to be associated with NBCCS. Conclusion On the basis of our experience, physicians treating pediatric ovarian tumors should be aware that such huge benign ovarian tumors may be a phenotype of NBCCS, as shown in our patient. In addition, genetic examination focusing on the PTCH1 gene might be important for diagnosis of NBCCS in pediatric patients. ",

These 'markers' have in common that they are all expressed in actively proliferating cells, particularly in neoplasms. The findings were compared with their expression in dentigerous and radicular cysts. While there was some variability in the reported results, probably because of technical inconsistencies and the use of different antibodies, a definite trend emerged. In general PCNA, Ki67 and p53 positivity occurred more frequently and more intensely in the OKCs, and in the syndrome-related more than the solitary, compared with the other cyst types. In the OKCs the positivity was expressed mostly in the suprabasal layers of epithelium whereas in the other cysts types it was mainly in the basal layer that positivity was observed. Other studies showed that the gene for the NBCCS (PTCH), a tumour suppressor gene, mapped to chromosome 9q22.3. PTCH gene mutation has been shown to be an important step in the pathogenesis of the OKC and was thought to have a role in the development of the sporadic as well as the syndrome-related OKCs. The 'two-hits' hypothesis was invoked in support of the view that syndrome-related basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and OKCs probably arise from precursor cells that contain an inherited 'first hit'. Only a single mutation was then required in the somatic cell to cause homozygous inactivation and neoplastic progression. Sporadic OKCs might arise from susceptible cells in which two somatic mutations or 'hits' have occurred, one of which manifests as allelic loss.

However, the radiation-related risk for skin cancer among atomic bomb survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is primarily derived from the excess risk of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), with no demonstrable excess in squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma. The BCCs in this cohort are therefore unusual in being potentially attributable to two types of radiation-UV and ionizing (IR). BCCs have been associated with PTCH and/or p53 tumor suppressor gene alterations. To investigate the roles of these genes in relation to IR and UV exposures, we analyzed both genes in BCC samples from atomic bomb survivors. We examined 47 tumors, of which 70% had non-silent base-substitution p53 mutations independent of IR or UV exposure. However, the distribution of mutation type depends on UV and/or IR exposure. For example, C-to-T transitions at CpG sites adjacent to pyrimidine-pyrimidine (PyPy) sequences were more prevalent in tumors from UV-exposed than UV-shielded body areas and CpG-mutations at non-PyPy sequences were more prevalent in tumors from UV-shielded body areas with high-IR (>or=1 Gy) than low-IR (<0.2 Gy) exposure. And notably, although p53 deletion-frequencies demonstrated no IR-dose associations, deletions at the PTCH locus were more frequent (79% versus 44%) in tumors with high-IR than low-IR exposure. Moreover, 60% of high-IR tumors harbored both p53 and PTCH abnormalities compared with 23% of low-IR tumors. Therefore, alteration of both genes is likely to play a role in radiation-induced basal cell carcinogenesis.",

We aimed to discern the importance of PTCH1 mutations in sporadic KCOTs.;PTCH1 mutational analysis was performed with 19 new sporadic KCOT cases by direct sequencing of epithelial lining samples separated from fibrous capsules. Using this approach, we further reexamined 9 sporadic KCOTs that were previously reported to lack PTCH1 mutations by our group.;Nineteen PTCH1 mutations were detected in patient samples from 16/19 new cases (84%) all these mutations were absent in fibrous tissues and peripheral blood specimens from the same patients. We also identified four PTCH1 mutations in 3/9 patients (33%) that were previously undetected.;These data indicated that PTCH1 mutations occur in sporadic KCOTs at a higher rate than previously suspected, owing to the masking effects of the attached stromal tissues in the test samples. These results suggest that the PTCH1 gene plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of sporadic KCOTs, which is comparable to that observed in NBCCS patients.",

To clarify the role of SHH signaling in OKCs, the expression of SHH, PTC, SMO, and GLI-1 and mutations of PTC were examined in 18 sporadic, 4 BCNS-associated OKCs and 7 control gingivae. SHH, PTC, SMO, and GLI-1 were detected in all OKC and gingiva samples by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Immunoreactivity for SHH and GLI-1 was markedly higher in epithelial components than in subepithelial cells, while immunoreactivity for PTC and SMO was similar in epithelial components and subepithelial cells in OKCs. The positive rate of PTC and SMO expression in subepithelial cells of OKCs was significantly higher than that in gingivae. The positive rate of GLI-1 expression in subepithelial cells of BCNS-associated OKCs was significantly higher than that in primary OKCs. These results suggest that the SHH signaling might be involved in the pathophysiologic nature of OKCs. While mutations of the PTC gene could not be detected in 4 BCNS-associated OKCs by direct DNA sequencing, 3 of 5 primary and 4 of 4 recurrent OKCs had several mutations of this gene.

The determinants of the variability in tumor onset and histology are unknown. We investigated the effects of the time-point and dosage of Ptch inactivation on tumor spectrum using conditional Ptch-knockout mice. Ptch heterozygosity induced prenatally resulted in the formation of RMS, which was accompanied by the silencing of the remaining wild-type Ptch allele. In contrast, RMS was observed neither after mono- nor biallelic postnatal deletion of Ptch. Postnatal biallelic deletion of Ptch led to BCC precancerous lesions of the gastrointestinal epithelium and mesenteric tumors. Hamartomatous gastrointestinal cystic tumors were induced by monoallelic, but not biallelic Ptch mutations, independently of the time-point of mutation induction. These data suggest that the expressivity of Ptch deficiency is largely determined by the time-point, the gene dose and mode of Ptch inactivation. Furthermore, they point to key differences in the tumorigenic mechanisms underlying adult and childhood tumors. The latter ones are unique among all tumors since their occurrence decreases rather than increases with age. A better understanding of mechanisms underlying this ontological restriction is of potential therapeutic value.",

Mice in which one copy of Ptch1 is inactivated show increased susceptibility to spontaneous tumor development and hypersensitivity to radiation-induced tumorigenesis, providing an ideal in vivo model to study the typical pathologies associated with basal cell nevus syndrome. We therefore examined BCC development in control and irradiated Ptch1(neo67/+) mice. We show that unirradiated mice develop putative BCC precursor lesions, i.e., basaloid hyperproliferation areas arising from both follicular and interfollicular epithelium, and that these lesions progress to nodular and infiltrative BCCs only in irradiated mice. Data of BCC incidence, multiplicity, and latency support the notion of epidermal hyperproliferations, nodular and infiltrative BCC-like tumors representing different stages of tumor development. This is additionally supported by the pattern of p53 protein expression observed in BCC subtypes and by the finding of retention of the normal remaining Ptch1 allele in all nodular, circumscribed BCCs analyzed compared with its constant loss in infiltrative BCCs. Our data suggest chronological tumor progression from basaloid hyperproliferations to nodular and then infiltrative BCC occurring in a stepwise fashion through the accumulation of sequential genetic alterations.",

MPF activation and its subcellular localization are dependent on the phosphorylation state of its components, cdc2 and cyclin B1. In a two-hybrid screen using a bait protein to mimic phosphorylated cyclin B1, we identified a novel interaction between cyclin B1 and patched1 (ptc1), a tumor suppressor associated with basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Ptc1 interacted specifically with constitutively phosphorylated cyclin B1 derivatives and was able to alter their normal subcellular localization. Furthermore, addition of the ptc1 ligand, sonic hedgehog (shh), disrupts this interaction and allows cyclin B1 to localize to the nucleus. Expression of ptc1 in 293T cells was inhibitory to cell proliferation; this inhibition could be relieved by coexpression of a cyclin B1 derivative that constitutively localizes to the nucleus and that could not interact with ptc1 due to phosphorylation-site mutations to ALA: In addition, we demonstrate that endogenous ptc1 and endogenous cyclin B1 interact in vivo. The findings reported here demonstrate that ptc1 participates in determining the subcellular localization of cyclin B1 and suggest a link between the tumor suppressor activity of ptc1 and the regulation of cell division.

In this study, we directly sequenced the PTCH gene in 20 sporadic medulloblastoma DNA samples. A nonsense mutation (Q694X) and a splice site alteration (2875+1G>A) were identified in two of the samples. The mutations are predicted to result in a truncated PTCH protein and aberrant splicing, respectively. In both cases, only the mutant alleles were identified, indicating that the mutations were associated with loss of the wild-type PTCH allele in the tumor cells. Several novel variants, including 1653T>C, 1672C>T, and 2292C>T, were also found in these tumor samples.

No abnormalities in the human homologue of the Drosophila segment polarity gene patched (PTCH), glutathione S-transferases T1 and M1, or cytochrome P450 1A1 were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based molecular analysis. There was, however, actinic damage of the skin in sun-exposed areas. The patient was diagnosed as having hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) at the age of 51 years, based upon leucocyte morphology as assessed by light and electron microscopy, tartrate-resistant acid leucocyte phosphatase (TRAP) staining, fluorescence activated cell scanning of peripheral blood leucocytes and bone marrow histology. As the leukaemia slowly progressed over a 3-month period, the patient developed four further BCCs. Given that HCL is characterized by a profound defect in T-cell function, it is conceivable that T-cell immune dysregulation can contribute to the pathogenesis of BCC, possibly enhancing the aetiological effect of ultraviolet irradiation.",

BCC has been associated with UV-induced mutations of the PTC and p53 tumor suppressor genes, and to polymorphisms in the melanocortin-1 receptor and XPD genes. Mortality rates due to BCC are low, but its increasing incidence and prolonged morbidity means the disease is costly to treat. Early recognition and effective treatment are therefore important, to reduce the incidence of BCC and lighten the economic burden of its management. This paper reviews current treatments for BCC, including excision and curettage, electrodessication, surgery, cryosurgery, radiotherapy, and treatment with 5-fluorouracil and intralesional/perilesional cytokines. It also deals with two new treatment modalities, photodynamic therapy and imiquimod 5% cream, an immune response modifier that effectively resolves BCC lesions.",

All three cell lines showed cellular morphology similar to that of BCC tumors and could be propagated for at least 20 passages. In addition, similar to BCC tumors, all cell lines had lost the wildtype Ptch1 allele, expressed BCC molecular markers, and responded similarly to cyclopamine, a small molecule inhibitor of Hedgehog signaling. Finally, we describe an efficient electroporation technique for DNA transfection into the BCC cell lines and show that they have activated Hedgehog signaling activity, albeit at a level lower than that of murine BCCs in vivo. These data indicate that the cell lines are bona fide long-term cultures of BCC cells and that DNA plasmids can be introduced into the BCC cell lines with relatively high transfection efficiency using a modified electroporation technique.",

NBCCS is an autosomal dominantly inherited disease with an estimated prevalence of 1:150,000 and diagnosis of this syndrome is often an accidental finding of radiological investigations. The purpose of this study was to report the varied radiological and dermatological manifestations of our patients affected with NBCCS and to present this rare syndrome as a differential diagnosis of skeletal anomalies.;Between 1994 and 2005 the demographic, clinical, radiological and histological data of 8 patients with NBCCS were retrospectively analyzed. Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome was diagnosed in the event of two major or one major and two minor criteria. The major criteria are more than 2 basal cell carcinoma, odontogenic keratocysts, three or more palmar pits, and calcification of the falx cerebri.;Between 1994 and 2005 8 patients (3 females and 5 males) with NBCCS were treated in our departments. The average age at the time of diagnosis of NBCCS was 49.9 years. All patients had a minimum of two major criteria. The major criteria with the most frequency were the basal cell carcinoma (6 patients) and the odontogenic keratocysts (5 patients), followed by the calcification of the falx cerebri and palmoplantar pits (4 patients). There was no gender-related or age-related predilection and only one patient was affected with pain in his fingers which radiologically correlated to small cystic bone lesions (\"flame-shaped lucencies\").;Due to limitations in identification of mutations in the PTCH1 gene, clinical and radiological examination still remains a very important factor in the treatment of patients suffering from NBCCS. The knowledge of the varied skeletal manifestations and constellations is therefore essential and correlates with therapeutic consequences. Often chest, rib, spine, skull, and jaw X-rays show the way. Due to the risk of the development of an associated medulloblastoma, neurological surveillance in 6-month intervals in addition to an annual MRI of the cerebrum up to an age of 7 is strongly recommended.",

Causative mutations for NBCCS occur in the PTCH1 gene on chromosome 9q22.3-q31, which encodes the principle receptor for the Hedgehog signalling pathway. We have investigated the molecular basis of craniofacial defects seen in NBCCS using a transgenic mouse model expressing Shh in basal epithelium under a Keratin-14 promoter. These mice have an absence of flat bones within the skull vault, hypertelorism, open-bite malocclusion, cleft palate and arrested tooth development. Significantly, increased Hedgehog signal transduction in these mice can influence cell fate within the craniofacial region. In medial edge epithelium of the palate, Shh activity prevents apoptosis and subsequent palatal shelf fusion. In contrast, high levels of Shh in odontogenic epithelium arrests tooth development at the bud stage, secondary to a lack of cell proliferation in this region. These findings illustrate the importance of appropriately regulated Hedgehog signalling during early craniofacial development and demonstrate that oro-facial clefting and hypodontia seen in NBCCS can occur as a direct consequence of increased Shh signal activity within embryonic epithelial tissues.",

BCC, the most common type of human cancer, is driven by the aberrant activation of hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Ptch, a tumor suppressor gene of Hh signaling pathway, and Smoothened play a key role in the development of radiation-induced BCCs in animal models. Epidemiological studies provide evidence that humans exposed to radiation as observed among the long-term, large scale cohorts of atomic bomb survivors, bone marrow transplant recipients, patients with tinea capitis and radiologic workers enhances risk of BCCs. Overall, this risk is higher in Caucasians than other races. People who were exposed early in life develop more BCCs. The enhanced IR correlation with BCC and not other common cutaneous malignancies is intriguing. The mechanism underlying these observations remains undefined. Understanding interactions between radiation-induced signaling pathways and those which drive BCC development may be important in unraveling the mechanism associated with this enhanced risk. Recent studies showed that Vismodegib, a Smoothened inhibitor, is effective in treating radiation-induced BCCs in humans, suggesting that common strategies are required for the intervention of BCCs development irrespective of their etiology.

The possibility of underlying genetic abnormalities in these familial BCCs has not been explored previously. The present study investigated a possible genetic abnormality in two members of a family with multiple nonsyndromic BCCs. The possibility of Gorlin syndrome in this family was excluded by both the absence of any clinical and radiological features and the lack of mutation in PTCH1. Notably, whole-genome comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) identified a microdeletion in chromosome 22q11.1 in both of the studied cases. A tiling path CGH array of the 22q11.1 region confirmed this microdeletion and mapped it between 14.46 and 14.5 Mb on chromosome 22q.

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) offers a non-invasive treatment option for patients with this condition, in which ionizing radiation is contraindicated. This study evaluates PDT as a treatment modality for Gorlin Syndrome and compares the treatment response of Gorlin-related basal cell carcinomas with that of the sporadic lesions.;In this un-randomized study, basal cell carcinomas in 25 Gorlin syndrome patients (with 36 lesions) and 145 sporadic patients (with 189 lesions) were treated by photodynamic therapy, using δ-5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) as a photosensitizer and 100Jcm(-2) of red light (630±15nm). The maximum thickness of the BCC was measured by 20MHz pulsed ultrasound prior to treatment and again 4-6 weeks and 12 months following treatment. The response of Gorlin syndrome lesions was compared to those in the overall sporadic population and then to a subpopulation matched as closely as possible for age, lesion thickness and site.;For both populations, the average pre-treatment BCC thickness by US was 1.5mm (overall range 0.3-5.3), and the average thickness at 4-6 weeks post-treatment was 0.5mm (overall range 0-4.3). Those BCC less than 1.5mm thick prior to treatment were significantly more likely to have no US evidence of disease at 4-6 weeks than and were more likely to be controlled at 12 months.;The average response to ALA PDT of Gorlin syndrome-related BCC closely resembles that for the sporadic population, with the same wide range of responses for a given dose.

An early event in BCC formation, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the Patched 1 (Ptch1) locus, can be used as a tool to address whether this tumour is monoclonal.;To determine whether superficial BCC is monoclonal by analysing individually microdissected superficial BCC nests and looking for the same pattern of LOH in each.;Six cases of superficial BCC were analysed for LOH at the Ptch1 gene locus using the D9S287 microsatellite marker. Identical allelic patterns were sought in each nest from a given tumour. These patterns were no allelic loss, loss of the shorter allele or loss of the longer allele, each with a respective probability of occurrence, as estimated from published findings.;All cases were informative. Four cases showed no LOH in each nest and two showed loss of the same allele. If these nests arose independently, then the probability of this result was between 4 x 10-11 and 2 x 10-14. The lack of LOH, seen in four cases, could be due to monoclonal expansion of a cell retaining both D9S287 alleles, or due to a polyclonal proliferation. Therefore, a separate analysis excluding these cases was done, giving a probability of between 2.2 x 10-4 and 1.0 x 10-7.;These probabilities were so extreme that it was unlikely that the nests arose independently, thus providing the first molecular evidence that superficial BCC is monoclonal.",

Surgical extirpation is currently the standard of care for BCC, which is associated with several advantages and disadvantages. Procedures such as surgical excision used to treat superficial BCC (sBCC) and nodular BCC (nBCC) may have high 5-year recurrence rates if tumors are not completely excised. Curettage with electrodesiccation is a common method for treating primary BCC. However, multiple cycles are recommended and the procedure can have unsatisfactory cosmetic results (e.g. scarring and hypopigmentation). Mohs micrographic surgery has a low rate of disease recurrence but is a specialized procedure usually limited to specific indications (e.g. high-risk tumors). Cryosurgery and photodynamic therapy require multiple cycles and are associated with variable cosmetic outcomes and recurrence rates. As with any procedure, potential risks and patient quality-of-life issues need to be considered. In addition, substantial patient and healthcare provider inconvenience limit the practical utility of some modalities. Pharmacologic interventions provide another treatment option as adjunctive or monotherapy.

The authors have therefore cultured skin fibroblasts from 5 NBCCS patients and measured their radiosensitivity in terms of clonogenic survival. Our results showed that, compared with 6 normal controls, the NBCCS cells were hypersensitive to X-rays. The average D0 (the inverse of the slope of the survival curve) for the NBCCS cells was 98 rads, compared with 142 rads for the normal controls and 44 rads for an ataxia telangiectasia (AT) strain. The average D10 values (the dose required to reduce survival to 10%) were 258, 351, and 123 rads for the NBCCS, normal, and AT strains, respectively. Unscheduled DNA synthesis measurements showed that NBCCS cells were not defective in excision repair of X-ray-damaged DNA. Pulse labeling index measurements showed that NBCCS cells were abnormally inhibited in the initiation of DNA synthesis following X-irradiation. The mechanisms underlying the radiosensitivity of NBCCS differ in several respects from those of AT.

In order to further define the region containing the NBCC gene, we have analyzed 137 individuals from eight families for linkage, using 11 markers from the region. Eight markers showed statistically significant evidence for linkage to NBCC. Three markers (D9S180, ALDOB, and D9S173) showed no definite recombination with the disease locus. All families showed some evidence for linkage to markers in this region. On the basis of the inspection of individual recombinants and previously published information about map location, we suggest the following order for the markers: D9S119-D9S12-D9S197-D9S196-(NBCC,D9S180 -D9S173,ALDOB)-D9S109- D9S127-(D9S53,D9S29).

The retinas of PtchlacZ+/- mice exhibit abnormal cell cycle regulation, which culminates in photoreceptor dysplasia and Müller cell-derived gliosis. In BCNS, the intraretinal glial response results in epiretinal membrane (ERM) formation, a proliferative and contractile response on the retinal surface.

Transition of SP to basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and, albeit rarely, to metastatic adenocarcinoma may occur. Allelic deletions of the human homologue of the drosophila patched gene (PTCH) occur in both NS and BCC. To search for genetic changes in SP, a microdissection-based genetic analysis using polymorphic markers at 9q22 (PTCH; D9S15, D9S303, D9S287, D9S252) as well as markers at 9p21 flanking the tumor suppressor gene p16 (IFNA, D9S171) was performed. Glandular epithelium consisting of two rows of cells as well as adjacent normal tissue or inflammatory infiltrates in the stroma, when present, was dissected and subjected to single-step DNA extraction and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis. Two of 10 informative SP cases showed LOH at 9q22 (PTCH). Three of 7 informative SP cases showed allelic deletions at 9p21 (p16). Allelic loss at 9q22 is consistent with the clinical observation of transition of SP to BCC. The finding of frequent allelic loss at 9p21 is unlikely to be related to the rare transition of SP to metastatic adenocarcinoma.

The function of this domain is poorly understood, but some proteins that contain sterol sensors are involved in cholesterol homeostasis. In the SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), sterols inhibit the protein's activity through this domain. Mutations in two highly conserved residues in the SCAP sterol sensor have been identified that confer resistance to sterol regulation. We introduced the analogous mutations in the sterol sensor motif of fly Ptc and mouse Ptc1 and examined their effect on protein activity. In contrast to SCAP, the sterol sensor mutations had different affects on Drosophila Ptc; Ptc Y442C retained function, while Ptc D584N conferred dominant negative activity. In the wing imaginal disc, Ptc D584N overexpression induced Hedgehog targets by stabilizing Cubitus interruptus and inducing decapentaplegic. However, Ptc D584N did not induce collier, a gene that requires high levels of Hedgehog signaling. In mouse Ptc1, the Y438C and D585N mutations did not stimulate signaling in Shh-responsive cell lines but did complement murine ptc1(-/-) cells.

Three type 2C Ser/Thr phosphatases (PTCs), Ptc1, Ptc2, and Ptc3, have been isolated as negative regulators of this pathway. Previously, multicopy expression of PTC1 and PTC3 was shown to suppress lethality of the sln1Delta strain due to hyperactivation of the HOG pathway. In this work, we show that PTC2 also suppresses sln1Delta lethality. Furthermore, the phosphatase activity of these PTCs was needed for suppression, as mutation of a conserved Asp residue, likely to coordinate a metal ion, inactivated PTCs. Further analysis of Ptc1 function in vivo showed that it inactivates the MAPK, Hog1, but not the MEK, Pbs2. In the wild type, Hog1 kinase activity increased transiently, approximately 12-fold in response to osmotic stress, while overexpression of PTC1 limited activation to approximately 3-fold. In contrast, overexpression of PTC1 did not inhibit phosphorylation of Hog1 Tyr in the phosphorylation lip, suggesting that Ptc1 does not act on Pbs2. Deletion of PTC1 also strongly affected Hog1, leading to high basal Hog1 activity and sustained Hog1 activity in response to osmotic stress, the latter being consistent with a role for Ptc1 in adaptation. In vitro, Ptc1 but not the metal binding site mutant, Ptc1D58N, inactivated Hog1 by dephosphorylating the phosphothreonine but not the phosphotyrosine residue in the phosphorylation lip. Consistent with its role as a negative regulator of Hog1, which accumulates in the nucleus upon activation, Ptc1 was found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Thus, one function of Ptc1 is to inactivate Hog1.",

We have found, in comparison with normal skin, that basal cell carcinomas have increased levels of mRNA for PTC1, GLI1, HIP, WNT2B, and WNT5a; decreased levels of mRNA for c-MYC, c-FOS, and WNT4; and unchanged levels of mRNA for PTC2, GLI2, WNT7B, and BMP2 and 4.

A nonconservative Pro/Leu nucleotide polymorphism within PTCH exon 23 at codon 1315 was recently reported to be potentially important for the development of breast epithelial cell cancers. Objectives Accordingly, the status of PTCH codon 1315 was analysed for a possible association with the development of nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) in a pilot study. Because skin cancer risk is affected by specific population-dependent phenotypes such as skin and hair colour, codon 1315 was also analysed for normal allele frequency variation in human populations having differing extents of eumelanin vs. phaeomelanin.;The single nucleotide polymorphism in codon 1315 of the human PTCH gene was analysed in genomic DNA from six different populations comprising 472 blood samples and from 170 patients in four different categories with NMSC. Polymerase chain reaction and pyrosequencing were used to determine the allele frequencies. Allelic loss was furthermore determined in tumours following microdissection.;The Pro/Pro genotype frequency ranged from 30% to 65% between populations, with a significant trend for a reduced frequency of the Pro/Pro genotype in populations having lighter pigmentation (P = 0.020). Pro/Pro frequency showed an increasing trend with increasing tumour case severity (P = 0.027). In 260 samples from 180 Swedish patients with NMSC and a control group of 96 healthy ethnically matched volunteers, no statistically significant pairwise differences between groups were detected in the PTCH codon 1315 allelic distribution, neither was a difference seen for multiple or early onset cases of BCC in the Swedish population. In Swedish patients with single tumours, allelic loss (loss of heterozygosity) was observed in 20 of 30 (67%) patients with BCC and four of 22 (18%) patients with SCC, with no preference in the allele lost. In contrast, the Pro/Pro genotype was frequent in seven U.S. patients having multiple independent BCCs. One of these patients was heterozygous, enabling allelic loss studies. Of 20 independent tumours, 11 had lost an allele; 10 of the 11 had lost Leu, suggesting nonrandom loss that favoured retention of Pro (P = 0.0059).;Our results indicate an association between the eumelanin-to-phaeomelanin shift and a shift from the Pro/Pro genotype to Leu-containing genotypes. Failure to lose Pro during the shift to phaeomelanin may be associated with an increased population risk for BCC and increased individual risk for multiple BCC. During development of a tumour, the effect of Pro may be magnified by loss of the Leu allele.",

Haploinsufficiency for the PTC locus is likely to give rise to developmental abnormalities characterized by symmetrical defects and malformed spine and ribs. Postnatal loss of the normal PTC allele leads to multiple basal cell carcinomas and other cancers.

In contrast, stem cells within the interfollicular epidermis do not efficiently form tumors. Notably, we observed that innervated Gli1-expressing progenitors within mechanosensory touch dome epithelia are highly tumorigenic. Sensory nerves activate Hedgehog signaling in normal touch domes, while denervation attenuates touch dome-derived tumors.

Analogously, skin carcinogenesis-susceptible (Car-S) mice are elective for studies of papilloma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) induction. We previously reported a striking effect of gender on BCC induction in Ptch1(+/-) mice, with total resistance of females; likewise, Car-S females show increased skin tumor resistance relative to males. Here, we investigated the protective role of endogenous estrogen in skin keratinocyte tumorigenesis. Control (CN) and ovariectomized Ptch1(+/-) or Car-S females were irradiated for BCC induction or topically treated with chemical carcinogens for SCC induction. Susceptibility to BCC or SCC was dramatically increased in ovariectomized Ptch1(+/-) and Car-S females and restored to levels observed in males. Remarkably, progression of initially benign papillomas to malignant SCC occurred only in ovariectomized Car-S females. We explored the mechanisms underlying tumor progression and report overexpression of estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha, downregulation of ERbeta and upregulation of cyclin D1 in papillomas from ovariectomized Car-S relative to papillomas from CN females. Thus, an imbalanced ERalpha/ERbeta expression may be associated with estrogen-mediated modulation of non-melanoma skin carcinogenesis, with a key role played by cyclin D1.

Inhibitors of this pathway that are currently in clinical trials inhibit Smo. However, mutations in Smo can result in resistance to these inhibitors. To target most BCCs and avoid acquired resistance because of Smo mutations, inhibiting the Shh-pathway downstream of Smo is critical. Attractive downstream targets would be at the level of Gli proteins, the transcriptional activators of this pathway in BCCs. Previously it has been shown that Gli1 and Gli2, when phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA), are targeted for proteosomal degradation. Here we show that PKA activation via the cAMP agonist forskolin is sufficient to completely abolish oncogenic Smo activity in vitro. In an inducible BCC mouse model due to a Smo mutation that confers resistance to current Smo inhibitors, topical forskolin treatment significantly reduced Gli1 mRNA levels and resulted in strongly suppressed BCC tumor growth. Our data show that forskolin inhibits the growth of even those BCCs that are resistant to Smo inhibitors and provide a proof-of-principle framework for the development of topically applied human skin-permeable novel pharmacologic inhibitors of oncogenic Shh-signaling through PKA activation.",

The data upon which this review is based has been retrieved from published case reports in Korean dental and medical literature between the years 1981 to 2002. We found 33 subjects who met the diagnostic criteria for NBCCS. Relative frequencies of associated complications are presented and compared with those of the English literature. Odontogenic keratocyst (OKC) and palmar and/or plantar pits, and hypertelorism were the most frequently observed anomalies. OKCs are often the first signs of NBCCS and can be detected in patients younger than 20 years of age. However, the incidence and clinical manifestations of NBCCS in Korean individuals were found to be rather different from those of other countries. The relatively low frequency of basal cell carcinomas and falx calcification among the major criteria were two major differences. The frequencies of the minor criteria concur in general with the ranges given by some others. It is concluded that these differences may be attributed to genetic and geographic differences.",

Patients with basal cell nevus syndrome (Gorlin syndrome) are highly susceptible to developing many BCCs as a result of a constitutive inactivating mutation in one allele of PATCHED 1, which encodes a tumor suppressor that is a major inhibitor of Hedgehog signaling. Dysregulated Hedgehog signaling is a common feature of both hereditary and sporadic BCCs. Recently, we showed remarkable anti-BCC chemopreventive efficacy of tazarotene, a retinoid with retinoic acid receptor (RAR) beta/gamma specificity, in Ptch1+/- mice when treatment was commenced before carcinogenic insults. In this study, we assessed whether the effect of tazarotene against BCC carcinogenesis is sustained after its withdrawal and whether tazarotene is effective against preexisting microscopic BCC lesions. We found that BCCs did not reappear for at least 5 months after topical drug treatment was stopped and that already developed, microscopic BCCs were susceptible to tazarotene inhibition. In vitro, tazarotene inhibited a murine BCC keratinocyte cell line, ASZ001, suggesting that its effect in vivo is by direct action on the actual tumor cells. Down-regulation of Gli1, a target gene of Hedgehog signaling and up-regulation of CRABPII, a target gene of retinoid signaling, were observed with tazarotene treatment. Finally, we investigated the effects of topical applications of other retinoid-related compounds on BCC tumorigenesis in vivo. Tazarotene was the most effective of the preparations studied, and its effect most likely was mediated by RARgamma activation. Furthermore, inhibition of basal RAR signaling in the skin promoted BCC carcinogenesis, suggesting that endogenous RAR signaling restrains BCC growth.",

The gene for this disorder, NBCCS, maps to chromosome 9q22.3, and loss of heterozygosity at this site in both sporadic and hereditary basal cell carcinomas suggests that it functions as a tumor suppressor. NBCCS was positionally cloned and shown to be the human homologue of the Drosophila gene, patched. Drosophila patched is part of the hedgehog signaling pathway, important in determining embryonic patterning and cell fate in multiple structures of the developing embryo.

Interferon (IFN)-based therapy is quite effective in BCC treatment, but the molecular basis is not well understood. Here we report a novel mechanism by which IFNalpha mediates apoptosis in BCCs. In the presence of IFNalpha, we observed increased apoptosis in a BCC cell line ASZ001, in which PTC is null, and therefore with constitutive activation of the sonic hedgehog pathway. We demonstrate that SMO agonist Ag-1.4 mediates activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) phosphorylation, which is abrogated by IFNalpha in sonic hedgehog responsive C3H10T1/2 cells. In transient transfection experiments, we demonstrate that IFNalpha inhibits Erk phosphorylation and serum response element activation induced by expression of SMO, Gli1, PDGFRalpha and activated Raf, but not activated mitogen-activated Erk-regulating kinase (Mek), suggesting that IFNalpha targets mainly on Mek function. We further show that IFNalpha induces expression of Fas in BCC cells through interfering with Mek function. The role of the Fas-L/Fas signaling axis in IFNalpha-mediated apoptosis is demonstrated by the fact that addition of Fas-L neutralizing antibodies, just as caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK, effectively prevents IFNalpha-mediated apoptosis. Thus, our data indicate that IFNalpha-based BCC therapy induces Fas expression and apoptosis through interfering with Mek function.",

The human homolog of the Drosophila PTCH was recently cloned and mapped to the BCNS locus on 9q22.3, a chromosomal region commonly deleted in TCCs. We first examined the steady state mRNA transcription of the PTCH, SMOH and GLI3 genes of the HH signal transduction pathway in TCC cell lines and normal urothelium. Normal urothelium and TCC cell lines express these three genes within the PTCH signal transduction pathway. We then screened for PTCH mutations in 'hot spot' exons 6, 8, 13 and 16 by PCR/SSCP analysis of genomic DNAs from 54 TCC tumor samples and control autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes. DNA sequence analysis confirmed TCC-specific mutations in two of 54 patients (3.7%). These mutations resulted a single amino acid substitution and two frame shifts. One tumor had PTCH mutations in exon 16 as well as exon 13 and one tumor had a mutation in exon 13 alone. Both TCC tumors that contained PTCH mutations had a loss of heterozygosity at 9q. Although the PTCH protein has an unknown function in urothelial cells, the detection of the PTCH, SMOH and GLI3 transcripts in normal urothelium and TCC cell lines and rare PTCH mutations in tumor samples suggest that the HH pathway may have a role in controlling the proliferation of urothelial cells and that PTCH mutations may contribute to the development of a subset of TCCs.",

BCC is generally a disorder of white individuals, especially those with fair skin. UV radiation is the most important risk factor in the development of BCC. Short-wavelength UVB radiation (290-320 nm, sunburn rays) is believed to play a greater role in BCC formation than long-wavelength UVA radiation (320-400 nm, tanning rays). A latency period of 20-50 years is typical between the time of UV damage and the clinical onset of BCC. Therefore, in most cases BCC develops on chronically sun-exposed skin in elderly people, most commonly in the area of head and neck. UVB radiation damages DNA and its repair system and alters the immune system resulting in a progressive genetic alterations and formation of neoplasm. UV-induced mutations in the TP53 tumor-suppressor gene have been found in about 50% of BCC cases. The mutations that activate the Hedgehog intercellular signaling pathway genes, including PTCH, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Smoothened (Smo) play a significant role in cutaneous carcinogenesis. Epidemiologic studies demonstrate the higher incidence of the BCC in more equatorial latitudes than in polar latitudes. Other risk factors for the development of BCC include sun bed use, family history of skin cancers, skin type 1 and 2, immunosuppression, previous radiotherapy, and chronic exposure to toxic substances such as inorganic arsenic. Although rarely metastatic, its malignant nature is sometimes emphasized by the local tissue destruction, disfigurement, and even death if left untreated. Due to extremely high incidence of BCC medical professionals should be aware of the importance of the public education on the etiology of this tumor and the importance of the UV protection.",

Mutations of the Shh receptor PATCHED (PTCH) are associated with medulloblastomas, which have not been found to have loss of PTCH heterozygosity. We address whether patched (Ptc) heterozygosity fundamentally alters granule cell differentiation and contributes to tumorigenesis by increasing proliferation and/or decreasing apoptosis in Ptc+/- mice. Our data show that postnatal Ptc+/- mouse granule cell precursor growth is not globally altered. However, many older Ptc+/- mice display abnormal cerebellar regions containing persistently proliferating granule cell precursors. Since fewer Ptc+/- mice form medulloblastomas, these granule cell rests represent a developmentally disrupted, but uncommitted stage of tumorigenesis. Although Ptc+/- mouse medulloblastomas express neurodevelopmental genes, they diverge from granule cell differentiation in their discordant coexpression of postmitotic markers despite their ongoing growth. Like human medulloblastomas, mouse tumors with reduced levels of the neurotrophin-3 receptor, trkC/Ntrk3, display decreased apoptosis in vivo, illustrating the role of TrkC in regulating tumor cell survival. These results indicate that Ptc heterozygosity contributes to tumorigenesis by predisposing a subset of granule cell precursors to the formation of proliferative rests and subsequent dysregulation of developmental gene expression.",

SHH binding to a 12-pass transmembrane receptor, Patched (PTCH), leads to freeing of Smoothened (SMO) and subsequent activation of GLI transcription factors. In the present study, we analyzed the expression of SHH, PTCH, SMO, and GLI1 in 31 follicular thyroid adenomas (FTA), 8 anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATC), and 51 papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) by immunohistochemical staining. More than 65% of FTA, PTC, and ATC specimens stained positive for SHH, PTCH, SMO, and GLI. However, the expression of the genes encoding these four molecules did not correlate with any clinicopathologic parameters, including the age, gender, the status of BRAF gene mutation, tumor stage, local invasion, and metastasis. Three thyroid tumor cell lines (KAT-18, WRO82, and SW1736) all expressed the genes encoding these four molecules. 5-Bromo-2-deoxyuridine labeling and MTT cell proliferation assays revealed that cyclopamine (CP), an inhibitor of the SHH pathway, was able to inhibit the proliferation of KAT-18 and WRO82 cells more effectively than SW1736 cells. CP led to the arrest of cell cycle or apoptosis. Knockdown of SHH and GLI expression by miRNA constructs that target SHH or GLI mRNA in KAT-18 and SW1736 cells led to the inhibition of cell proliferation. Our results suggest that the SHH pathway is widely activated in thyroid neoplasms and may have potential as an early marker of thyroid cancer or as a potential therapeutic target for thyroid cancer treatment.",

We provide functional evidence for its direct in vivo interaction with the Hh-bound Ptc receptor during signal transmission. Because loss of l(2)tid causes neoplastic transformation of Hh-responsive cells, we suggest that Tid47 may at least act as a guardian of the Hh signaling gradient by regulating Ptc homeostasis in the tissue. Finally, we show that the expression of htid-1, the human counterpart of l(2)tid, is altered in human BCCs.

Loss of heterozygosity for the PTCH region was found several years ago in the epithelial lining of odontogenic keratocysts, the cyst type with highly increased incidence in nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. This finding confirmed the expectations that the gene responsible for the syndrome would have a decisive role in the genesis of these cysts even when they are not syndrome related. Suggestive temporal distribution of Shh signaling, recently observed during tooth development, lead us to investigate PTCH association with dentigerous cysts, the other major noninflammatory cyst of odontogenic origin. We report here that PTCH appears to be inactivated in dentigerous cysts, suggesting that it is responsible for their genesis as well. More generally, if our similar observations of incomplete heterozygosity in this region for dermoid cysts can be interpreted as loss of heterozygosity, PTCH alterations may prove to be a necessary, and perhaps the initiating event, in formation and growth of various noninflammatory cysts.

Furthermore, heterozygous PTCH knockout mice develop trichoblastoma-like tumors. This suggests an involvement of the PTCH gene in the pathogenesis of human trichoblastomas. However, trichoblastomas arising in nevus sebaceus did not show loss of heterozygosity at the PTCH locus (9q22.3) in a previous study. Sequencing of the PTCH gene and analysis of sporadic human trichoblastomas have not been performed yet. We therefore screened 10 sporadic trichoblastomas and 1 trichoblastoma arising within a nevus sebaceus for PTCH mutations. After microdissection of the tumors, single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP)/heteroduplex analysis of exons 2 to 23 of PTCH was performed, and polymerase chain reaction products with aberrant band patterns were sequenced. One trichoblastoma revealed a silent mutation at codon 562 in exon 12. Another trichoblastoma showed a somatic C > T single nucleotide substitution at codon 1,315 (exon 23), which was not present in corresponding normal epidermis. This mutation at codon 1,315 represents an already described PTCH germline polymorphism and results in a heterozygous Pro to Leu substitution in the tumor. The Pro/Leu polymorphism in germline is associated with a higher risk for breast cancer, but a potential contribution to the tumorigenesis of trichoblastoma is unknown. We detected no classical PTCH mutations in the investigated trichoblastomas.

Ptch1 heterozygous mice mimic the predisposition to BCC and MB development of patients affected by nevoid BCC syndrome that inherit a mutant Patched (Ptch1) allele. To examine the impact of genetic background on development of BCCs and other tumors we used two outbred mouse lines characterized by extremely high, carcinogenesis-susceptible (Car-S), and low, carcinogenesis-resistant (Car-R), susceptibility to skin carcinogenesis. Crosses between Ptch1(neo67/+) mice and Car-S (F1S) or Car-R mice (F1R) were exposed to ionizing radiation. F1SPtch1(neo67/+) mice were highly susceptible to radiation-induced BCCs, whereas F1RPtch1(neo67/+) mice were completely resistant, indicating that tumor penetrance can be modulated by genetic background. Development of microscopic and macroscopic BCC lesions was influenced by Car-S and Car-R genotypes, suggesting a genetic-background effect on both initiation and progression of BCC. Susceptibility was additionally increased in N2 backcross mice (Car-S x F1SPtch1(neo67/+)), showing a contribution from recessive-acting Car-S modifiers. The modifying effects of Car-S-derived susceptibility alleles were tissue specific. In fact, despite higher susceptibility to BCC induction, Car-S-derived lines had lower MB incidence compared with CD1Ptch1(neo67/+) mice. BCC-associated somatic events were not influenced by genetic background, as shown by similar rate of wild-type Ptch1 loss in BCCs from F1SPtch1(neo67/+) (93%) and CD1Ptch1(neo67/+) mice (100%). Finally, microsatellite analysis of BCCs showed Ptch1 loss through interstitial deletion. These results are relevant to humans, in which BCC is the commonest malignancy, because this model system may be used to study genes modifying BCC development.",

We have analyzed the hptc gene, postulated to be a tumor suppressor gene, in 22 BCCs from patients with the hyperphotosensitive genodermatosis xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). Patients with XP are deficient in the repair of UV-induced DNA lesions and are characterized by their predisposition to cancers in sun-exposed skin. Analysis using PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism of the hptc gene identified 19 alterations in 16 of 22 (73%) of the BCCs examined. Only two (11%) deletions of the hptc gene were found in XP BCCs compared with >30% rearrangement observed in non-XP sporadic BCCs, and 17 of 19 (89%) were base substitutions. Among the 17 base substitutions, 11 (65%) were CC --> TT tandem mutations, and 4 (23%) were C --> T substitutions, all targeted at bipyrimidine sites. Hence, a significantly higher number (15 of 19; 79%) of UV-specific alterations are seen in XP tumors, in contrast to non-XP sporadic BCCs. Interestingly, we have found that in 7 of 14 (50%) XP BCCs analyzed, both hptc and the tumor suppressor gene p53 are mutated. Not only have our data indicated the key role played by hptc in the development of BCCs, they also have substantiated the link between unrepaired UV-induced DNA lesions and skin carcinogenesis, as exemplified by the UV-specific alterations of different genes in the same tumors.",

In the search for other tumor suppressors, interest has focused on the deletion events at the 17p13.3 locus, the most common genetic defect in medulloblastoma. This chromosomal region contains HYPERMETHYLATED IN CANCER 1 (HIC1), a transcriptional repressor that is a frequent target of epigenetic gene silencing in medulloblastoma. Here we use a mouse model of Ptch1 heterozygosity to reveal a critical tumor suppressor function for Hic1 in medulloblastoma. When compared with Ptch1 heterozygous mutants, compound Ptch1/Hic1 heterozygotes display a fourfold increased incidence of medulloblastoma. We show that Hic1 is a direct transcriptional repressor of Atonal Homolog 1 (Atoh1), a proneural transcription factor essential for cerebellar development, and show that ATOH1 expression is required for human medulloblastoma cell growth in vitro. Given that Atoh1 is also a putative target of Hh signaling, we conclude that the Hic1 and Ptch1 tumor suppressors cooperate to silence Atoh1 expression during a critical phase in GCP differentiation in which malignant transformation may lead to medulloblastoma.",

Together with the previously identified ptc1+ gene, the enzymes encoded by these genes account for approximately 90% of the measurable PP2C activity in fission yeast cells. No obvious growth defects result from individual disruptions of ptc genes, but a delta ptc1 delta ptc3 double mutant displays aberrant cell morphology and temperature-sensitive cell lysis that is further accentuated in a delta ptc1 delta ptc2 delta ptc3 triple mutant. These phenotypes are almost completely suppressed by the presence of osmotic stabilizers, strongly indicating that PP2C has an important role in osmoregulation. Genetic suppression of delta ptc1 delta ptc3 lethality identified two loci, mutations of which render cells hypersensitive to high-osmolarity media. One locus is identical to wis1+, encoding a MAP kinase kinase (MEK) homolog. The Wis1 sequence is most closely related to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae MEK encoded by PBS2, which is required for osmoregulation. These data indicate that divergent yeasts have functionally conserved MAP kinase pathways, which are required to increase intracellular osmotic concentrations in response to osmotic stress. Moreover, our observations implicate PP2C enzymes as also having an important role in signal transduction processes involved in osmoregulation, probably acting to negatively regulate the osmosensing signal that is transmitted through Wis1 MAP kinase kinase.",

The effect of the mitogen was followed during 5 days after stimulation by determining the incorporation of 3H-TdR, the increase of cell number, and the mitotic index. NBCCS and control lymphocytes showed equal sensitivity to UV light in terms of UDS and reduced response to PHA. On the contrary, the mitotic index and the number of cells in stimulated cultures were significantly lower in the affected subjects.

In one case, a series of cephalograms performed during a period of 20 years allowed the slow and continuous recording of a ponticulus posticus formation.;Besides the predisposition to developing neoplasms, NBCCS also affects bone development. Some diagnostic criteria for NBCCS rely on certain osseous transformations either in hard tissues, e.g. keratocystic odontogenic tumor in jaws, or in soft tissues, e.g. calcification of the falx cerebri. Furthermore, the physiognomy can be affected by skeletal alterations, e.g. frontal bossing or hypertelorism. Given this wide spectrum of osseous involvement in NBCCS, the high prevalence rate of ponticulus posticus should be added to the relevant diagnostic findings of the skull and vertebral column.

The basally expressed TLR3 are functional in PTC cells as evidenced by the ability of double-strand RNA (polyinosine-polycytidylic acid) to significantly increase the activity of transfected NF-kappaB and IFN-beta luciferase reporter genes and the levels of two end products of TLR3 signaling, IFN-beta and CXCL10. Phenylmethimazole (C10), a drug that decreases TLR3 expression and signaling in FRTL-5 thyrocytes, decreases TLR3 levels and signaling in PTC cells in a concentration-dependent manner. C10 also decreased Wnt5a RNA levels coordinate with decreases in TLR3. E-cadherin RNA levels, whose suppression may be associated with high Wnt5a, increased with C10 treatment. C10 simultaneously decreased PTC proliferation and cell migration but had no effect on the growth and migration of FC, AC, or FRTL-5 cells. C10 decreases high basal phosphorylation of Tyr705 and Ser727 on Stat3 in PTC cells and inhibits IL-6-induced Stat3 phosphorylation. IL-6-induced Stat3 phosphorylation is important both in up-regulating Wnt5a levels and in cell growth. In sum, high Wnt5a levels in PTC cells may be related to high TLR3 levels and signaling; and the ability of phenylmethimazole (C10) to decrease growth and migration of PTC cells may be related to its suppressive effect on TLR3 and Wnt5a signaling, particularly Stat3 activation.",

Several lines of evidence, including transgenic mice experiments, suggest that the critical cellular effect is stimulation of proliferation mediated by the transcriptional effector GLI1.

At the molecular level, basal cell carcinomas are characterized by aberrant activation of sonic hedgehog signaling, usually due to mutations either in the ptch or smoh genes. In addition, about half of the cases carry mutations in the tp53 tumor suppressor gene, which are often UVB-associated C-->T transition mutations. Clinically, basal cell carcinomas may show a high degree of phenotypical variability. In particular, tumors occurring in atypical locations, showing an unusual clinical appearance, or imitating other skin diseases may cause diagnostic problems.

Gorlin syndrome is the main consideration and the gene most commonly mutated is PTCH1, a key regulator of the Hedgehog developmental pathway. Recently, loss of function of another gene in the same pathway, SUFU, has been found to explain a subset of families. Understanding the pathogenesis of familial BCCs has advanced the understanding of the biology of sporadic tumours and led to targeted therapy trials. The management of familial BCCs remains a challenge due to significant unmet needs for non-surgical treatments and a high burden of disease for the individual.

Activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway underlies a number of types of common human cancers, yet little is known concerning endocrine signaling in such tumors. Here, we investigated endocrine signaling in a murine model of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of the skin, the most common cancer. BCCs were generated by the activation of Hh signaling resulting from the specific deletion of the Ptch1 gene in the developing epidermis. Subsequently, a severe growth deficiency was observed in the murine BCC model, and we identified a deficiency of circulating IGF1 (Igf1). We demonstrate that Hh pathway activation in murine BCC induces IGF binding proteins, thereby regulating Igf1 sequestration into the skin and skewing Igf endocrine signaling. Significantly, these results show that Hh-induced tumors can have endocrine effects on normal tissues that in turn can greatly impact the host. This study not only identifies that Igf is important in Hh-associated skin tumors but also exemplifies the need to consider endocrine signaling when interpreting complex in vivo tumor models.",

The clonal nature of BCC has long been a subject for debate because of the tumour growth pattern. Despite a morphologically multifocal appearance, genetic analysis and three-dimensional reconstructions of tumours have favoured a unicellular origin. We have utilized the X-chromosome inactivation assay in order to examine clonality in 13 cases of BCC. Four parts of each individual tumour plus isolated samples of stroma were analysed following laser-assisted microdissection. In 12/13 tumours, the epithelial component of the tumour showed a monoclonal pattern suggesting a unicellular origin. Surprisingly, one tumour showed evidence of being composed of at least two non-related monoclonal clones. This finding was supported by the analysis of the ptch and p53 gene. Clonality analysis of tumour stroma showed both mono- and polyclonal patterns. A prerequisite for this assay is that the extent of skewing is determined and compensated for in each case. Owing to the mosaic pattern of normal human epidermis, accurate coefficients are difficult to obtain; we, therefore, performed all analyses both with and without considering skewing. This study concludes that BCC are monoclonal neoplastic growths of epithelial cells, embedded in a connective tissue stroma at least in part of polyclonal origin. The study results show that what appears to be one tumour may occasionally constitute two or more independent tumours intermingled or adjacent to each other, possibly reflecting a local predisposition to malignant transformation.",

Previous studies, including those from our laboratory, have shown that the forkhead box transcription factor Foxf1 is highly expressed in RMS of human and murine origin. We report on a more common role of Foxf1 in Ptch1-associated tumorigenesis, since we found a striking up-regulation of Foxf1 expression in Ptch1-associated BCC and MB compared with the respective non-neoplastic tissue. This overexpression was accompanied by increased levels of the Hedgehog target gene Gli1 as well as the putative Foxf1 targets Bmi1 and Notch2 in these tumors. We also describe a striking Foxf1 activation in Ptch1 null embryos. In contrast, basal expression levels of Foxf1, Gli1, Bmi1 and Notch2 were detected in a variety of adult mouse tissues, such as liver, kidney, spleen, lung, heart and brain.

The PTCH1 protein works as a negative regulator of the HH-signaling pathway by repressing downstream signaling by the coreceptor smoothened (SMOH). Mutations in PTCH1 lead to constitutive expression of HH target genes and a relationship between mutated PTCH1 and the most common tumor form in the Western world, Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) has been clearly established. We here show that PTCH1 is transcriptionally regulated by three independent promoters generating transcripts with alternative first exons. We demonstrate that only one of two putative Gli-binding sites that were identified in the promoter region of PTCH1 is functional, and that the transactivating Gli proteins, GLI1, Gli2 and GLI3, bind and enhance transcription through this site. Moreover, a strong repression of both basal and induced PTCH1 transcription was observed following expression of a truncated version of GLI3. Most interestingly, the upstream components in the HH-signaling cascade, Sonic HH (SHH) and SMOH, solely operate through the functional Gli-binding site because mutation of the Gli-binding site resulted in the disappearance of the enhanced transcription induced by the Gli proteins, as well as by SHH or SMOH. This finding suggests that transcriptional activation of the PTCH1 gene mediated via the HH-signaling pathway is dependent on the single functional Gli-binding site.",

The authors studied the relative incidence of Hürthle cell PTC and the relationship of Hürthle cell PTC to other variants of thyroid carcinoma. Three hundred eighty consecutive cases of thyroid carcinoma were reviewed to identify cases with focal or extensive areas of Hürthle cell PTC, classic PTC, Hürthle cell carcinoma (ie, non-Hürthle cell PTC), and follicular carcinoma. In addition, the status of lymphoid infiltrate in the tumor, stromal invasion with desmoplastic reaction, vascular invasion, and distant and lymph node metastasis were noted by microscopic examination, review of clinical charts, or both. A total of 24 (HCs) and 42 PTCs with Hürthle cells were identified. The latter category was divided into pure Hürthle cell PTC or extensive Hürthle cell (HPTC) (28 cases) and PTC or Hürthle cell carcinoma with focal areas of Hürthle cell PTC (14 cases). The Hürthle cell PTC/Hürthle cell carcinoma ratio was lower than that of PTC/follicular carcinoma (39:289) (P = 0.001). Follicular or solid structures were present in all HPTCs. HPTCs were associated with frequent stromal intrathyroid and extrathyroid invasion, but they tended to have a lower rate of lymph node metastasis (8/28) compared with classic PTC with stromal invasion (108:200) (P = 0.12) and a lower rate of distant metastasis (2:28) compared with Hürthle cell carcinoma (15:24) (P = 0.02) or follicular carcinoma (13:39) (P = 0.04). Warthin-like Hürthle cell PTC (10 cases) was associated with extrathyroid invasion in five cases. In Hürthle cell PTC associated with tall cell variant (10 cases), areas of gradual transition between Hürthle cell PTC and tall cell variant were identified. The latter variant showed the highest rate of extrathyroid stromal and vascular invasion with distant metastasis and patient death compared with all Hürthle cell PTCs and classic PTCs. In conclusion, Hürthle cell PTC is frequently associated with tall cell variant. It has a higher potential for extrathyroid invasion than classic PTC and has vascular invasion and distant metastasis characteristics intermediate between those of classic PTC and Hürthle cell carcinoma with or follicular carcinoma. Hürthle cell PTC tends to show a greater likelihood of extrathyroid invasion when associated with Warthin-like features and tall cell variant PTC, and higher vascular invasion and distant metastasis when associated with tall cell variant.",

We have previously demonstrated that the putative leucine zipper in the N-terminal region of H4 can mediate oligomerization of the PTC1 oncoprotein in vitro. In this study, we further demonstrated that the PTC1 oncoprotein forms a dimer in vivo, and the leucine zipper is responsible for this dimerization. The H4 leucine zipper-mediated dimerization is essential for tyrosine hyperphosphorylation and the transforming activity of the PTC1 oncoprotein. Introducing a loss-of-function PTC1 mutant into PTC1-transformed NIH3T3 cells suppressed the transforming activity of PTC1 and reversed the transformed phenotype of these cells, presumably by forming inactive heterodimers between the two forms of PTC1. Taken together, these data indicate that constitutive dimerization of the PTC1 oncoprotein is essential for PTC1 transforming activity and suggest that constitutive oligomerization acquired by rearrangement or by point mutations may be a general mechanism for the activation of receptor tyrosine kinase oncogenes.",

Podoplanin is a mucin-type transmembrane protein found in podocytes of human kidneys homologous to T1α-2. The expression of podoplanin in some other non-endothelial tissues raised our interest in studying this antibody in tissues of odontogenic origin. Recently, we reported podoplanin expression in sporadic cases of KCOT.

The staining intensity was strong and did not differ from that for KCOT in previously reported sporadic cases. Strong nuclear P63 expression was detected in basal cell layers and diminished in suprabasal layers.;KCOTs exhibited enhanced podoplanin expression in a clinical setting of NBCCS. Although the biological functions of podoplanin have not yet been fully recognized, the overexpression of this protein is capable of promoting the formation of elongated cell extensions, and increasing adhesion and migration of inflammatory cells.

Transfection with v-myc or with an activated mouse pro-I gene (which specifies sensitivity to promotion of neoplastic transformation in JB6 mouse epidermal cells) specifically conferred partial immortality on the BCNS fibroblasts by substantially extending their population doubling levels by more than 19 population doublings. This suggests that either v-myc or pro-I gene can cooperate with BCNS gene(s) to produce an extension of lifespan or partial immortality. However, the transfected BCNS fibroblasts that escaped senescence were anchorage-dependent even after exposure to the tumor promoters 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), epidermal growth factor (EGF) or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). These observations indicate that BCNS fibroblasts differ from their normal counterparts in susceptibility to extended growth and may therefore be pre-neoplastic.

PTCH has also been shown to mutate in both familial and sporadic basal cell carcinomas. However, mutations of the gene seem to be rare in squamous cell carcinomas. In order to characterize the role of the gene in the broader spectrum of sporadic skin malignant and pre-malignant lesions, we performed a polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis of genomic DNA extracted from 105 adult patients (46 females and 59 males). There were 66 patients with basal cell carcinomas, 30 with squamous cell carcinomas, 2 with malignant melanomas and 7 patients with precancerous lesions. Two tissue samples were collected from each patient, one from the central portion of the tumor and another from normal skin. Using primers that encompass the entire exon 1, exon 8 and exon 18, where most of the mutations have been detected, we were unable to demonstrate any band shift. Three samples suspected to present aberrant migrating bands were excised from the gel and sequenced directly. In addition, we sequenced 12 other cases, including tumors and corresponding normal samples. A wild-type sequence was found in all 15 cases. Although our results do not exclude the presence of clonal alterations of the PTCH gene in skin cancers or mutations in other exons that were not screened, the present data do not support the presence of frequent mutations reported for non-melanoma skin cancer of other populations.",

Yet, fundamental differences in the development of the two different entities have been and are currently unveiled. The constitutive activation of the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway by acquired mutations in the PTCH and SMO genes appears to represent the early basal cell carcinoma developmental determinant. Although other signaling pathways are also affected, small hedgehog inhibitory molecules evolve as the most promising basal cell carcinoma treatment options systemically as well as topically in current clinical trials. For squamous cell carcinoma development mutations in the p53 gene, especially UV-induced mutations, have been identified as early events. Yet, other signaling pathways including epidermal growth factor receptor, RAS, Fyn, or p16INK4a signaling may play significant roles in squamous cell carcinoma development.

We present 10 previously unreported individuals with 9q22.3 deletions that include PTCH1. While 7 of the 10 patients (7 females, 3 males) did not meet strict clinical criteria for BCNS at the time of molecular diagnosis, almost all of the patients were too young to exhibit many of the diagnostic features. A number of the patients exhibited metopic craniosynostosis, severe obstructive hydrocephalus, and macrosomia, which are not typically observed in BCNS. All individuals older than a few months of age also had developmental delays and/or intellectual disability. Only facial features typical of BCNS, except in those with prominent midforeheads secondary to metopic craniosynostosis, were shared among the 10 patients. The deletions in these individuals ranged from 352  kb to 20.5  Mb in size, the largest spanning 9q21.33 through 9q31.2. There was significant overlap of the deleted segments among most of the patients. The smallest common regions shared among the deletions were identified in order to localize putative candidate genes that are potentially responsible for each of the non-BCNS features. These were a 929  kb region for metopic craniosynostosis, a 1.08  Mb region for obstructive hydrocephalus, and a 1.84  Mb region for macrosomia.

Depending on the challenge and the context, constitutively expressed COX-1 or the transiently induced COX-2 isoform are of relevance. Moreover, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of skin is a prominent example of epithelial neoplasia that consistently overexpresses COX-2 in the parenchyme and the mesenchyme of premalignant and malignant lesions, while COX-1 expression remains unaltered. Pharmacological, clinical, and experimental animal studies as well as a few epidemiological studies document the importance of PG signaling in non-melanoma skin cancer including SCC and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in humans and mice. Increased levels of PGE(2) and PGF(2α) in premalignant and/or malignant epithelial skin cancers are due to the constitutive upregulation of enzymes involved in PG biosynthesis, such as COX-2, and downregulation of the tumor suppressor gene 15-hydroxy-prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH), which is involved in the inactivation of PG, thus counteracting the activities of COX. Most remarkably, genetic studies show that mice which are deficient in COX-2 or COX-1 are protected from the development of SCC when applying the multi-stage chemical carcinogenesis protocol. Conversely, the forced overexpression of COX-2 in the proliferative basal compartment of the stratified skin epidermis results in spontaneous hyperplasia and dysplasia in transgenic mice and furthermore a sensitization for cancer development by conferring an auto-promoted skin phenotype. In multi-stage carcinogenesis, it also becomes clear that aberrant COX-2 overexpression and activity are causally involved in tumor promotion and tumor progression rather than initiation. In contrast, using as inducer of carcinogenesis the complete carcinogen UV B light, depletion of COX-2 but not of COX-1 makes mouse skin resistant for SCC, indicating that here, only COX-2 is essential. Depending on the type of challenge, COX-2-dependent signaling contributes to the pre-invasive growth of the skin epidermis by a delayed onset of terminal differentiation, or stimulation of hyperproliferation and survival. With respect to BCC, the genetic ablation of COX-2 but also of COX-1 leads to a strongly reduced tumor burden in the skin of Patched (Ptch)1(+/-) mice, which due to the deletion of a Ptch1 allele, spontaneously develop BCC resembling human familial basal cell nevus syndrome and sporadic BCC. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and the COX-2-selective inhibitors (COXibs) exhibit impressive efficacy inhibiting tumor burden in various mouse models of SCC and BCC. Most importantly, in humans the interruption of COX-2 signaling is an effective strategy to treat and chemo-prevent non-melanoma skin cancer in individuals who are at high risk for the disease. However, any potential beneficial effect of this medicine has to be balanced against the adverse effects that are known to be associated with these drugs in a subset of patients.",

Despite the aberrant signaling role of the Hedgehog pathway, little is known about the genetic mechanisms underlying basal cell carcinomas. Towards a better understanding of global genetic events, we have employed the Affymetrix Mapping 10K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray technique for \"fingerprinting\" genomewide allelic imbalance in 14 basal cell carcinoma-blood pair samples. This rapid high-resolution SNP genotyping technique has revealed a somatic recombination event-uniparental disomy, leading to a loss of heterozygosity (LOH), as a key alternative genetic mechanism to allelic imbalances in basal cell carcinomas. A highly conserved LOH region at 9q21-q31 was found in 13 of 14 (93%) basal cell carcinomas. Further statistical and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses confirmed that the 9q LOH was a result of uniparental disomy in 5 of 13 (38%) basal cell carcinomas. De novo mutations in the Patched 1 gene (PTCH) were found in 9 of 13 (69%) basal cell carcinomas with 9q LOH. A second important locus, containing LOH at 6q23-q27 was found in 5 of 14 (36%) basal cell carcinomas, suggesting that the presence of an additional putative tumor suppressor gene may be contributing to basal cell carcinoma development. This study shows that the rate of 9q LOH in basal cell carcinomas has been previously underestimated. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence that uniparental disomy due to somatic recombination constitutes one of the mechanisms of LOH in basal cell carcinoma tumorigenesis.",

Melanin is a natural skin protective factor against UV radiation. Skin cancers associated with long-term exposure to UV radiation are: basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM). The high risk of BCC development is related to acute and repeated exposure to UV causing sunburn. Molecular studies of BBC demonstrated disorders in sonic hedgehog (SHH) cell signaling regulation pathway, associated with the suppressor protein patched homolog 1 gene (PTCH1) mutations. The risk of the BCC development is related to the polymorphism of melanokortin-1 receptor gene (MC1R). Tumor P53 gene mutations observed in BCC cells has been classified as secondary genetic changes. In SCC cells UV-induced mutations were mostly related to P53 gene. Increased expression of cyclooxigenase- 2 gene (COX-2) plays a significant role in the development of SCC. Other pathogenetic factors include intensification of the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-1 α (IL-1α), IL-1β and IL-6). Currently, the role of UVB has been recognized in the pathogenesis of CMM. In CMM cells the following gene mutations were noted: cyclindependent kinase inhibitor 2A INK4A (p16INK4A), cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), Ras, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and proto-oncogene B-Raf (BRAF).

Do raków skóry, których rozwój jest związany z długotrwałym narażeniem na promieniowanie UV, zalicza się niebarwnikowe raki skóry (non-melanoma skin cancers – NMSC) – raka podstawnokomórkowego (basal cell carcinoma – BCC) i raka kolczystokomórkowego (squamous cell carcinoma – SCC) oraz czerniaka złośliwego skóry (cutaneous malignant melanoma – CMM). Wysokie ryzyko rozwoju BCC związane jest z ostrą i wielokrotną ekspozycją na UV, powodującą oparzenia słoneczne. Badania molekularne BCC wykazały zaburzenia na szlaku regulacji sygnalizacji komórkowej sonic hedgehog (SHH), które były związane z mutacjami genu supresorowego PTCH1 (protein patched homolog 1). Ryzyko rozwoju BCC jest również związane z polimorfizmem genu receptora melanokortyny-1 (MC1R). Obserwowane w komórkach BCC mutacje genu P53 klasyfikowano jako wtórne zmiany genetyczne. W komórkach SCC mutacje indukowane UV najczęściej dotyczyły genu P53. W rozwoju SCC istotne znaczenie ma zwiększona ekspresja genu enzymu cyklooksygenazy-2 (COX-2).

        "Doc_abstract":"Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and a subset of medulloblastomas are characterized by loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor gene, PTCH1. PTCH1 normally functions by repressing the activity of the Smoothened (SMO) receptor. Inactivating PTCH1 mutations result in constitutive Hedgehog pathway activity through uncontrolled SMO signaling. Targeting this pathway with vismodegib, a novel SMO inhibitor, results in impressive tumor regression in patients harboring genetic defects in this pathway. However, a secondary mutation in SMO has been reported in medulloblastoma patients following relapse on vismodegib to date. This mutation preserves pathway activity, but appears to confer resistance by interfering with drug binding. Here we report for the first time on the molecular mechanisms of resistance to vismodegib in two BCC cases. The first case, showing progression after 2 months of continuous vismodegib (primary resistance), exhibited the new SMO G497W mutation. The second case, showing a complete clinical response after 5 months of treatment and a subsequent progression after 11 months on vismodegib (secondary resistance), exhibited a PTCH1 nonsense mutation in both the pre- and the post-treatment specimens, and the SMO D473Y mutation in the post-treatment specimens only. In silico analysis demonstrated that SMO(G497W) undergoes a conformational rearrangement resulting in a partial obstruction of the protein drug entry site, whereas the SMO D473Y mutation induces a direct effect on the binding site geometry leading to a total disruption of a stabilizing hydrogen bond network. Thus, the G497W and D473Y SMO mutations may represent two different mechanisms leading to primary and secondary resistance to vismodegib, respectively.",

KCOTs are usually the first manifestation of Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome (NBCCS), an autosomal dominant disorder also known as Gorlin's syndrome and they are most frequently observed familial symptom regardless of patients' nationality. In addition, the recurrence rate and multiplicity of KCOTs is relatively high as compared to that of other sporadic carcinomas. KCOT has been considered as a non-hereditary lesion and its familial onset is an extremely rare event in non-NBCCS cases. Here, we describe previously unreported non-syndromic multiple KCOT cases in identical twins in a Japanese family. The subjects were female Japanese identical twins who were 26 and 27 years old, respectively, at the time of diagnosis for KCOT. They had no major or minor features of NBCCS other than KCOT. Although there were lesions that were likely to be dentigerous cysts based on radiographic findings, one of them was KCOT. This case report highlights the importance of precise diagnosis, choice of surgical method and careful observation for multiplicity or familial onset in sporadic KCOT cases without NBCCS. ",

Ionizing radiation synergize with Ptc1 mutation to induce medulloblastoma only in neonatally exposed mice. To explore the mechanisms underlying age-dependent susceptibility, we irradiated Ptc(neo67/+) mice at postnatal day 1 (P1) or 10 (P10). We observed a dramatic difference in medulloblastoma incidence, which ranged from 81% in the cerebellum irradiated at P1 to 3% in the cerebellum irradiated at P10. A striking difference was also detected in the frequency of cerebellar preneoplastic lesions (100 versus 14%). Our data also show significantly lower induction of apoptosis in the cerebellum of medulloblastoma-susceptible (P1) compared to -resistant (P10) mice, strongly suggesting that medulloblastoma formation in Ptc1 mutants may be associated with resistance to radiation-induced cell killing. Furthermore, in marked contrast with P10 mice, cerebellum at P1 displays substantially increased activation of the cell survival-promoting Akt/Pkb protein, and markedly decreased p53 levels in response to radiation-induced genotoxic stress. Overall, these results show that developing cerebellar granule neuron precursors' (CGNPs) radiosensitivity to radiation-induced cell death increases with progressing development and inversely correlates with their ability to neoplastically transform.",

Gradually decreasing dosage levels were employed. During the initial courses of therapy, high doses (2.0-3.0 mg/kg/day) were intended as chemotherapy. In these patients only 6 of 40 (15%) lesions underwent complete clinical regression. In subsequent courses aimed at chemoprevention, the dose was progressively reduced from 1.5 to 0.25 mg/kg/day. During therapy, no new lesions were observed in the patient with the arsenical exposure. The NBCCS patient developed 1 new lesion during therapy at 1.0 mg/kg/day, 1 new lesion at 0.5 mg/kg/day and 5 new lesions at 0.25 mg/kg/day. Treatment was discontinued and the patient with the arsenic exposure developed his first new tumor 17 months afterwards; in contrast, the NBCCS patient developed 29 tumors within 13 months. These findings suggest that long-term therapy with isotretinoin is needed for the continuation of the cancer chemopreventive effect. However, the need for continuous rather than intermittent maintenance therapy, and the determination of the optimal dose for this purpose may depend on the etiology of the multiple carcinomas and on the tolerability of the lowest effective dose by the individual patient. With these encouraging data, it now appears appropriate to expand this pilot study and perform larger trials to determine the usefulness of isotretinoin in the chemoprevention of basal cell carcinoma in patients with multiple tumors.",

The effect of hedgehog signaling on the proliferation of endometrial carcinoma cell lines was also examined.;The expression of Shh, Ptch, Smo, and Gli1 was very weak in normal endometrium, but was increased in endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma stepwisely with significant differences. There was no marked difference in the expression of these molecules in carcinomas according to stages and histologic grades. Treatment with cyclopamine, a specific inhibitor of the hedgehog pathway, for endometrial carcinoma Ishikawa and HHUA cells suppressed growth by 56% and 67%, respectively, compared with the control. The addition of recombinant Shh peptide to HHUA cells enhanced their proliferation by 41%. The silencing of Gli1 using small interfering RNA (siGli1) resulted in the growth suppression and down-regulation of Ptch expression. In addition, the cyclopamine/siGli1-induced growth suppression was associated with the down-regulation of cyclins D1 and A and N-myc. No somatic mutations for ptch and smo genes were detected in the endometrial carcinoma cases examined.;The abnormal activation of this pathway is involved in the proliferation of endometrial carcinoma cells possibly in an auto-/paracrine fashion, suggesting the possibility of the hedgehog pathway being a novel candidate for molecular targeting.",

We interrogated 705 epithelial cancer cell lines for growth             response to the Smo inhibitor cyclopamine and for expressed HH pathway-regulated             species in a linked genetic database. Ptch and Smo mutations that respectively             conferred Smo inhibitor response or resistance were undetected. Previous studies             revealed HH pathway activation in lung cancers.

These studies were conducted to determine if molecular profiling can enhance our understanding of Hurthle cell neoplasms.;Thirteen Hurthle cell tumors (9 adenomas, 4 carcinomas) were analyzed with the Affymetrix HU-95 gene chips. Molecular profiles obtained were compared to 14 follicular adenomas (FAs), 7 follicular carcinomas (FCs), 10 PTCs, 11 follicular variant PTCs, and 9 hyperplastic nodules. Hierarchical cluster analysis defined potential groupings and differences among samples.;Hurthle cell carcinomas grouped with FCs 100% of the time. Surprisingly, Hurthle cell adenomas clustered with FCs when compared to FAs and FCs in 8/9 (88%) cases. All 13 Hurthle cell lesions migrated as a distinct group separate from PTCs and FVPTCs. Finally, all Hurthle cell lesions clustered with FCs, rather than PTCs, when compared to both groups.;Molecular profiles of Hurthle cell adenomas and carcinomas are more similar to FCs than benign lesions or PTCs. Although Hurthle cell adenomas generally behave in a benign fashion, the molecular signature of these lesions suggests a more malignant phenotype.",

In the experiment, 1800 44-week-old Hy-line brown laying hens were divided into 5 groups with 6 replicates per group and 60 hens per replicate. The experiment lasted for 12 weeks. The layers in the control group (control) were given a basal diet with 0.36% non-phytate P (NPP), while the treatment groups received diets containing 360 U of exogenous phytase/kg with 0.26% NPP (EP) or 360 phytase U of PTC/kg diet with 0.26% (PTC1), 0.21% (PTC2) or 0.16% (PTC3) NPP. 3. The results showed that there was no significant difference in egg production, average daily feed intake, feed efficiency, rate of broken or soft-shell egg production or egg mass among the treatments. There was no significant difference in eggshell thickness or eggshell strength. On the other hand, no differences in any of the bone variables were found between treatments. The faecal P percentage content in EP, PTC1, PTC2 and PTC3 groups was significantly lower than the control group. 4. In summary, the PTC could be used in the feed of laying hens instead of EP to reduce P excretion without effecting production and bone mineralisation.",

He had previously been diagnosed with basal cell naevus syndrome but had withdrawn from follow-up. His foot showed a deep ulcerating defect accompanied by profound necrosis extending to the metatarsophalangeal joints. There was a nodular skin defect over the first metatarsophalangeal joint, which was shown by histopathology to be a basal cell carcinoma, and the ulcer was bordered by a raised wall. Further physical examination revealed more than 200 dermal lesions which were identified by the dermatologist who was called in for consultation as basal cell carcinomas; multiple depressions due to abnormal local keratinisation were also seen on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. These findings led to a diagnosis of 'basal cell naevus syndrome'. The patient was treated by amputation of the lower leg followed by excision and curettage of the remaining basal cell carcinomas. At the time of the last follow-up, the patient was being checked periodically in the dermatology outpatient clinic. Basal cell naevus syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant hereditary disease. The prevalence is estimated to be between 1 in 57,000 and 1 in 164,000. Basal cell naevus syndrome is generally caused by a mutation in the 'patched homolog' (PTCH)-I gene, located on chromosome 9q22.3. Although the syndrome affects multiple organ systems, the most characteristic of this disorder is the appearance of multiple basal cell carcinomas.",

A high prevalence of RET gene rearrangements (62.3%) with a significant predominance of ELE1/RET (PTC3) over H4/RET (PTC1) rearrangements was found in PTCs of the first post-Chernobyl decade. NTRK1 rearrangements were rare (3.3%). In 3.3%, we observed novel types of RET rearrangements: GOLGA5/ RET (PTC5), HTIF/RET (PTC6), RFG7/RET (PTC7), and an as yet undefined RFGX/RET.RET rearrangements, preferentially ELE1/RET, are related to rapid tumor development. At longer intervals after exposure to ionizing radiation, the prevalence of RET rearrangements declines with a shift from ELE1/RET to H4/RET, most significantly in female patients. The prevalence of specific types of rearrangements is independent of age at irradiation. A significantly higher prevalence of ELE1/RET was observed in the most heavily contaminated Oblasts, Gomel and Brest, suggesting a preferential formation of this type of rearrangement after high thyroid doses. RET rearrangement is related to aggressive growth: Rearrangement-positive PTCs were in a more advanced pT category and more frequently in the pN1 category at presentation than rearrangement-negative PTCs. ELE1/RET is related to the solid variant of PTC, H4/RET more frequently to typical papillary structures. The genotype/phenotype evaluation of post-Chernobyl PTCs reveals a characteristic spectrum of gene rearrangements that lead to typical phenotypes with important biological and clinical implications.",

PTC, the most frequent thyroid carcinoma histotype, is associated with gene rearrangements that generate RET/PTC and TRK oncogenes and with BRAF-V600E and RAS gene mutations. These last two genetic lesions are also present in a fraction of PDTCs. The ERK1/2 pathway, downstream of the known oncogenes activated in PTC, has a central role in thyroid carcinogenesis. In this study, we demonstrate that the BRAF-V600E, RET/PTC, and TRK oncogenes upregulate the ERK1/2 pathway's attenuator cytoplasmic dual-phase phosphatase DUSP6/MKP3 in thyroid cells. We also show DUSP6 overexpression at the mRNA and protein levels in all the analysed PTC cell lines. Furthermore, DUSP6 mRNA was significantly higher in PTC and PDTC in comparison with normal thyroid tissues both in expression profile datasets and in patients' surgical samples analysed by real-time RT-PCR. Immunohistochemical and western blot analyses showed that DUSP6 was also overexpressed at the protein level in most PTC and PDTC surgical samples tested, but not in ATC, and revealed a positive correlation trend with ERK1/2 pathway activation. Finally, DUSP6 silencing reduced the neoplastic properties of four PTC cell lines, thus suggesting that DUSP6 may have a pro-tumorigenic role in thyroid carcinogenesis.",

In this article we describe the synthesis of more polar BCN derivatives and their properties for selective cellular glycan labelling. The new polar derivatives [amino-BCN, glutarylamino-BCN and bis(hydroxymethyl)-BCN] display reaction rates similar to those of BCN and are less cell-permeable. The labelling specificity in HEK293 cells is greater than that of BCN, as determined by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Interestingly, amino-BCN appears to be highly specific for the Golgi apparatus.

We report a high prevalence of BRAF(V599E) mutation in sporadic PTC and in PTC-derived cell lines. The BRAF(V599E) mutation was detected in 23 of 50 PTC (46%) and in three of four PTC-derived cell lines. The prevalence of the BRAF(V599E) mutation in PTC is the highest reported to date in human carcinomas, being only exceeded by melanoma. PTC with RET/PTC rearrangement as well as the TPC-1 cell line (the only one harboring RET/PTC rearrangement) did not show the BRAF(V599E) mutation. BRAF(V599E) mutation was not detected in any of 23 nodular goiters, 51 follicular adenomas and 18 follicular carcinomas. A distinct mutation in BRAF (codon K600E) was detected in a follicular adenoma. Activating mutations in RAS genes were detected in 15% of FA, 33% of FTC and 7% of PTC. BRAF(V599E) mutation did not coexist with alterations in any of the RAS genes in any of the tumors. These results suggest that BRAF(V599E) mutation is frequent in the etiopathogenesis of PTC. The BRAF(V599E) mutation appears to be an alternative event to RET/PTC rearrangement rather than to RAS mutations, which are rare in PTC. BRAF(V599E) may represent an alternative pathway to oncogenic MAPK activation in PTCs without RET/PTC activation.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Mutations are defined as stable and irreversible modifications of the normal genetic message due to small changes in the number or type of bases, or to large modifications of the genome such as deletions, insertions or chromosome rearrangements. These lesions are due to either polymerase errors during normal DNA replication or unrepaired DNA lesions, which will give rise to mutations through a mutagenic pathway. The molecular process leading to mutagenesis depends largely on the type of DNA lesions. Base modifications, such as 8-oxo-guanine or thymine glycol, both induced by ionizing radiations (IR), are readily replicated leading to direct mutations, usually base-pair substitutions. The 8-oxo-G gives rise predominantly to G to T transversions, the type of mutations found in ras or p53 gene from IR-induced tumors. Bulky adducts produced by chemical carcinogens or UV-irradiation are usually repaired by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway which is able to detect structural distortion in the normal double-strand DNA backbone. These lesions represent a blockage to DNA and RNA polymerases as well as some signal for p53 accumulation in the damaged cell. In the absence of repair, these lesions could be eventually replicated owing to the induction of specific proteins at least in bacteria during the SOS process. The precise nature of the error-prone replication across an unexcised DNA lesion in the template is not fully understood in detailed biochemical terms, in mammalian cells. IR basically produce a very large number of DNA lesions from unique base modifications to single- or double-strand breaks and even complex DNA lesions due to the passage of very high energy particles or to a local re-emission of numerous radicals. The breakage of the double-helix is a difficult lesion to repair. Either it will result in cell death or, after an incorrect recombinational pathway, it will induce frameshifts, large deletions or chromosomal rearrangements. Most of the IR-induced mutations are recessive ones, requiring therefore a second genetic event in order to exhibit any harmful effect and a long latency period before the development of a radiation-induced tumor. The fact that IR essentially induced deletions and chromosomal translocations renders very difficult the use of the p53 gene as a marker for mutation analysis. In agreement with the type of lesions induced by IR, it is interesting to point out that the presence has been observed, in a vast majority of radiation-induced papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC), of an activated ret proto-oncogene originated by the fusion of the tyrosine kinase 3' domain of this gene with the 5' domain of four different genes. These ret chimeric genes which are due to intra- or inter-chromosomal translocations, were called RET/PTC1 to PTC5. The RET/PTC rearrangements were found in PTC from children contaminated by the Chernobyl fall-out as well as in tumours from patients with a history of therapeutic external radiation, with a frequency of 60-84%. This frequency was only 15% in 'spontaneous' PTC. The type of ret chimeric gene predominantly originated by the accidental or therapeutic IR was different. Indeed, PTC1 was present in 75% of the tumours linked to a therapeutic radiation and PTC3 in 75% of the Chernobyl ones. The other forms of RET/PTC were observed in only a minority of the post-Chernobyl PTC (< 20%). The difference in the frequency of PTC1 and PTC3 in both types of PTC, is statistically significant (P < 10(-5), Fischer's exact test). In two of the post-therapeutic radiation PTC, RET/PTC1 and PTC3 were simultaneously present. A PTC1 gene was also observed in 45% of the adenomas appearing after therapeutic radiation. The long-period of latency between exposure to IR and the appearance of thyroid tumours is probably due to the conversion of a heterozygote genotype of IR-induced mutations to a homozygote one. It will be interesting to use this time lag in accidental or therapeutic-irradiated p",

After irradiation of cells with 4 or 2 + 2 J/m2 UV light, lymphocytes from seven BCNS patients had a similar number of aberrant cells compared with normal controls, while cells from three EV patients showed a significantly increased number of cells containing aberrations, particularly chromatid-type aberrations, compared to controls (p < 0.03, Student's t-test). Similar results were observed whether the cells were irradiated with single or double doses of UV light. In addition, lymphocytes from EV patients had significantly lower mitotic indices than controls whether the cultures were irradiated with UV light or unirradiated (p < 0.05; Student's t-test). After irradiation with 100, 100 + 100 or 50 + 50 cGy gamma-rays, the mean chromosome aberration frequencies from nine BCNS patients and two EV patients were not significantly different from the controls. The spontaneous chromosome aberration frequencies were similar for the patients and the controls. Our data indicate that BCNS and EV lymphocytes irradiated with gamma-rays have a normal DNA repair response. However, cells from EV patients have an abnormal repair response to UV light induced DNA damage. This abnormality is probably caused by deficiency in DNA repair and it is consistent with the patients' sensitivity to UV light induced cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas.",

In Japanese patients, one of 11 papillary thyroid carcinomas, four of 19 follicular adenomas and one of two adenomatous goiters were positive for the transcript, indicating that the involvement of retTPC/PTC is not specific to papillary thyroid carcinomas. In several independent RT-PCR experiments using different portions of the same positive carcinoma tissue, retTPC/PTC transcript was always detected. On the other hand, the transcript was not always positive in different RNA samples from benign cases, suggesting that positive carcinomas are probably composed of clonal cell populations all expressing retTPC/PTC, whereas adenomas and adenomatous goiter comprise heterogeneous populations: both positive and negative for retTPC/PTC transcript.

A genetic screen in search of mutations in protein kinase-encoding genes able to suppress multiple phenotypic traits caused by the ptc1 deletion yielded a single gene, MKK1, coding for a MAPK kinase (MAPKK) known to activate the cell-wall integrity (CWI) Slt2 MAPK. In contrast, mutation of the MKK1 paralog, MKK2, had a less significant effect. Deletion of MKK1 abolished the increased phosphorylation of Slt2 induced by the absence of Ptc1 both under basal and CWI pathway stimulatory conditions. We demonstrate that Ptc1 acts at the level of the MAPKKs of the CWI pathway, but only the Mkk1 kinase activity is essential for ptc1 mutants to display high Slt2 activation. We also show that Ptc1 is able to dephosphorylate Mkk1 in vitro. Our results reveal the preeminent role of Mkk1 in signaling through the CWI pathway and strongly suggest that hyperactivation of Slt2 caused by upregulation of Mkk1 is at the basis of most of the phenotypic defects associated with lack of Ptc1 function.

Patched1 (Ptc1) was one of the first such loci, and Ptc1 haploinsufficiency has been asserted to lead to medulloblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma in mice.;To study the role of Ptc1 in cerebellar tumor development and to create a preclinical therapeutic platform, we have generated a conditional Ptc1 haploinsufficiency model of medulloblastoma by inactivating Ptc1 in Pax7-expressing cells of the cerebellum.;These mice developed exclusively medulloblastoma. We show that despite the presence of transcription of Ptc1, Ptc1 protein is nearly undetectable or absent in tumors. Our results suggest that Ptc1 loss of function is complete, but achieved at the protein level rather than by the classic genetic two-hit mechanism or a strict half-dosage genetic haploinsufficiency mechanism. Furthermore, we found that bortezomib, a 26S proteasome inhibitor, had a significant anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo, which was accompanied by restoration of Ptc1 protein and downregulation of the hedgehog signaling pathway. The same effect was seen for both human and mouse medulloblastoma tumor cell growth.;These results suggest that proteasome inhibition is a potential new therapeutic approach in medulloblastoma.",

SRF is involved in various cellular processes such as expression of immediate early and tissue-specific genes, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The expression of SRF in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and its role have not been investigated, forming the basis for this study. Surgical specimens of 63 conventional PTCs along with 30 follicular adenoma, 30 adenomatous hyperplasia and 9 anaplastic carcinoma specimens were obtained from the surgical archives. The expression of SRF was determined by the use of immunohistochemical staining. We also investigated the expression level of SRF and an SRF target gene, c-fos in fresh PTC tissues and thyroid cancer cell lines (NPA, FRO and ARO) by Western blot analyses. In addition, we examined the role of SRF in PTC by overexpresion of SRF in the NPA cell line. SRF was mainly expressed in cancer cells, showing a strong nuclear and/or cytoplasmic staining in PTC. SRF was expressed in 50 of 63 cases of papillary carcinoma (79%), 18 of 30 cases of follicular adenoma (60%), 10 of 30 cases of nodular hyperplasia (33%) and 6 of 9 cases of anaplastic carcinoma (67%). The expression level of SRF was significantly up-regulated in PTC (combined staining score of 5.21+/-0.43) and anaplastic carcinoma (5.67+/-1.45) compared to that of follicular adenoma (2.30+/-0.44) (P<0.001), or adenomatous goiter (1.13+/-0.28) (P<0.001). Western blot analyses showed an increased expression of the spliced form of SRF protein and c-Fos protein in PTC as compared to non-tumor thyroid tissues. SRF expression correlated with the tumor size of the PTCs (P<0.05). Overexpression of SRF in papillary carcinoma cells enhanced cell motility and invasiveness.

Protein expressions of the up-regulated genes in PTC were examined in thyroid tissues by immunohistochemistry.;Sixty-four genes were overexpressed in PTC tissue relative to normal thyroid tissue and healthy peripheral blood cells. The genes that were up-regulated in PTC were involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA damage response, angiogenesis, and oncogenesis. Among these genes, basic fibroblast growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor were identified by immunochemical methods as proteins that are specifically expressed at high levels in thyroid neoplasms. Basic fibroblast growth factor, which has been identified as a biomarker for PTC, was overexpressed in 54% of PTC cases, 67% of follicular thyroid carcinomas, and 36% of benign thyroid neoplasms. Platelet-derived growth factor was overexpressed in 81% of PTC cases and 100% of follicular carcinomas, but was immunonegative in normal thyroid tissues and benign thyroid neoplasms.;Platelet-derived growth factor may be a potential biomarker for PTC and follicular carcinoma.

Thus borderline malignancy in our new classification includes some of the formerly malignant tumors and they are 1) papillary microcarcinoma, 2) encapsulated conventional PTC (EncPTC), 3) encapsulated follicular variant PTC (EnFVPTC), 4) well differentiated tumor of uncertain malignant potential (WDT-UMP), 5) follicular tumors of uncertain malignant potential (FT-UMP), and 6) capsular invasion only follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC).  Review of the literature revealed that those thyroid tumors have consistently excellent outcome.  Well differentiated follicular cell adenocarcinoma (WDA) in our classification includes common type PTC and low-risk follicular carcinoma (FTC).

Whole slide immunohistochemistry was performed and scored by automated digital image analysis. Non-neoplastic thyroid, follicular adenomas, follicular carcinomas, and medullary carcinomas were negative for TROP-2 immunostaining. The majority of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) specimens (94/114, 82.5%) were positive for TROP-2; however, the pattern of staining differed significantly between the histopathological variants. All papillary microcarcinomas (mPTC), PTC classic variant (PTC cv), and tall cell variant (PTC tcv) were TROP-2 positive, with mainly diffuse staining. In contrast, less than half of the PTC follicular variant specimens were positive for TROP-2, with only focal immunoreactivity. TROP-2 could identify PTC cv with 98.1% sensitivity and 97.5% specificity. ROC curve analysis found that the presence of >10% of TROP-2 positive cells in a tumour supported a diagnosis of PTC. The study of intratumoural heterogeneity showed that low-volume cytological samples of PTC cv could be adequately assessed by TROP-2 immunostaining. The TROP-2 H-score (intensity multiplied by proportion) was significantly associated with PTC variant and capsular invasion in encapsulated PTC follicular variant (p<0.001). None of the baseline (age, gender) and clinical (tumour size, nodal disease, stage) parameters were correlated with TROP-2 expression. In conclusion, TROP-2 membranous staining is a very sensitive and specific marker for PTC cv, PTC tcv, and mPTC, with high overall specificity for PTC. ",

We hypothesize that such HCPTCs behave in a fashion analogous to other papillary carcinomas, while Hürthle cell carcinomas (HCCs) behave similarly to follicular carcinomas.;At the conclusion of this article, participants should be able to discuss HCTs and to identify HCPTCS using molecular techniques.;A retrospective chart review was carried out on 56 patients with HCTs. All pathological specimens were analyzed for ret/PTC gene rearrangements. Hürthle cell adenoma (HCA) was defined as an HCT that did not exhibit capsular and/or vascular invasion and that lacked a ret/PTC gene rearrangement when evaluated by immunohistochemical and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis. An HCC was defined as an HCT with capsular and/or vascular invasion that lacked a ret/PTC gene rearrangement, and an HCPTC was defined as any HCT that harbored a ret/PTC gene rearrangement.;The subclassification of the 56 HCTs was as follows: 21 HCAs, 15 HCCs, and 20 HCPTCs. No patients with HCA or HCC were ret/PTC positive. Five of the 6 patients with definite lymph node metastasis were in the HCPTC group, demonstrating that molecular analysis helps to explain biological behavior.;Hürthle cell neoplasms can now be classified using histopathological as well as molecular criteria.

All classical PTC, PTC TCF, and TCV ≥ 1 cm in size were included.;A total of 453 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria (288 classical PTC, 31 PTC TCF, and 134 TCV). Classical PTC patients were younger than their PTC TCF and TCV counterparts (p<0.0002). There was an increase in tumor size from classical PTC to PTC TCF and TCV (p=0.05).

The characterization of these genetic interactions strengthens the relevant role of Ptc1 in downregulating the Slt2-mediated CWI pathway. We show that under stress conditions activating the CWI pathway the ptc1 mutant displays hyperphosphorylated Cdc28 kinase and that these cells accumulate with duplicated DNA content, indicative of a G2-M arrest. Clb2-associated Cdc28 activity was also reduced in ptc1 cells. These alterations are attenuated by mutation of the MKK1 gene, encoding a MAP kinase kinase upstream Slt2. Therefore, our data show that Ptc1 is required for proper G2-M cell cycle transition after activation of the CWI pathway. ",

Cells lacking the PTC1 gene initially produce buds without a mitochondrial compartment; however, these buds later receive part of the mitochondrial network from the mother cell. Thus, the loss of PTC1 causes a delay, but not a complete block, in mitochondrial transport. PTC1 encodes a serine/threonine phosphatase in the high-osmolarity glycerol response (HOG) pathway. The mitochondrial inheritance delay in the ptc1 mutant is not attributable to changes in intracellular glycerol concentrations or defects in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Moreover, epistasis experiments with ptc1delta and mutations in HOG pathway kinases reveal that PTC1 is not acting through the HOG pathway to control the timing of mitochondrial inheritance. Instead, PTC1 may be acting either directly or through a different signaling pathway to affect the mitochondrial transport machinery in the cell. These studies indicate that the timing of mitochondrial transport in wild-type cells is genetically controlled and provide new evidence that mitochondrial inheritance does not depend on a physical link between the mitochondrial network and the incipient bud site.",

We reported that, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, overexpression of the Ptc3p isoform resulted in increased lithium tolerance in the hypersensitive hal3 background. We have found that the tolerance induced by PTC3 overexpression is also observed in wild-type cells and that this is most probably the result of increased expression of the ENA1 Na(+)-ATPase mediated by the Hog1 MAP kinase pathway. This effect does not require a catalytically active protein. Surprisingly, deletion of PTC3 (similarly to that of PTC2, PTC4 or PTC5) does not confer a lithium-sensitive phenotype, but mutation of PTC1 does. Lack of PTC1 in an ena1-4 background did not result in additive lithium sensitivity and the ptc1 mutant showed a decreased expression of the ENA1 gene in cells stressed with LiCl. In agreement, under these conditions, the ptc1 mutant was less effective in extruding Li(+) and accumulated higher concentrations of this cation. Deletion of PTC1 in a hal3 background did not exacerbate the halosensitive phenotype of the hal3 strain. In addition, induction from the ENA1 promoter under LiCl stress decreased similarly (50%) in hal3, ptc1 and ptc1 hal3 mutants. Finally, mutation of PTC1 virtually abolishes the increased tolerance to toxic cations provided by overexpression of Hal3p. These results indicate that Ptc1p modulates the function of Ena1p by regulating the Hal3/Ppz1,2 pathway.

Activating germline or somatic mutations of genes encoding Hh pathway components are found in Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) and Medulloblastoma (MB). Ligand-dependent Hedgehog hyperactivation, due to autocrine or paracrine mechanisms, is also observed in a large number of malignancies of the breast, colon, skin, bladder, pancreas and other tissues. The key tumorigenic role of Hedgehog has prompted effort aimed at identifying inhibitors of this signaling. To date, only the antagonists of the membrane transducer Smo have been approved for therapy or are under clinical trials in patients with BCC and MB linked to Ptch or Smo mutations. Despite the good initial response, patients treated with Smo antagonists have eventually developed resistance due to the occurrence of compensating mechanisms. Furthermore, Smo antagonists are not effective in tumors where the Hedgehog hyperactivation is due to mutations of pathway components downstream of Smo, or in case of non-canonical, Smo-independent activation of the Gli transcription factors. For all these reasons, the research of Hh inhibitors acting downstream of Smo is becoming an area of intensive investigation. In this review we illustrate the progresses made in the identification of effective Hedgehog inhibitors and their application in cancer, with a special emphasis on the newly identified downstream inhibitors. We describe in detail the Gli inhibitors and illustrate their mode of action and applications in experimental and/or clinical settings. ",

Six hundred and fifty two patients (153 men; 499 women) with PTC were identified. PTC accounted for 72.8% of primary thyroid cancers. Conventional papillary carcinoma (n = 300) accounted for 46% of PTC and papillary microcarcinoma 27.8% (n = 181). The frequencies of the common histological variants were follicular (17.6%, n =115), tall cell (4%, n = 26), and diffuse sclerosing (1.8%, n = 12). Uncommon histological variants including solid (n = 5), diffuse follicular (n = 5), papillary carcinoma with focal insular component (n = 3), columnar cell (n = 2), papillary carcinoma with fasciitis-like stroma (n = 2), and oncocytic (n = 1) were also noted. Histological variants of PTC had different age presentation, tumor size, frequencies of lymph node metastases, calcification, metaplastic bone, and psammoma bodies, when compared with conventional PTC.

PTCH1 is a member of hedgehog signaling, which is a highly conserved pathway in vertebrates, composed of hedgehog, SMO, and GLI proteins as well as PTCH1. Given that hedgehog signaling regulates cell growth and development, disorder of this pathway gives rise to not only developmental anomalies but also diverse tumors such as those seen in Gorlin syndrome. We recently reported, for the first time, a nationwide survey of Gorlin syndrome in Japan, noting that the frequency was 1/235,800 in the Japanese population, and that the frequency of basal cell carcinomas was significantly lower in Japan than in the USA and Europe, suggesting that ethnicity and genetic background contribute to these differences.

However, relatively little is known about the mechanism underlying programmed tapetal cell development and degradation. Here, we report a key regulator in monocot rice (Oryza sativa), PERSISTANT TAPETAL CELL1 (PTC1), which controls programmed tapetal development and functional pollen formation. The evolutionary significance of PTC1 was revealed by partial genetic complementation of the homologous mutation MALE STERILITY1 (MS1) in the dicot Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). PTC1 encodes a PHD-finger (for plant homeodomain) protein, which is expressed specifically in tapetal cells and microspores during anther development in stages 8 and 9, when the wild-type tapetal cells initiate a typical apoptosis-like cell death. Even though ptc1 mutants show phenotypic similarity to ms1 in a lack of tapetal DNA fragmentation, delayed tapetal degeneration, as well as abnormal pollen wall formation and aborted microspore development, the ptc1 mutant displays a previously unreported phenotype of uncontrolled tapetal proliferation and subsequent commencement of necrosis-like tapetal death. Microarray analysis indicated that 2,417 tapetum- and microspore-expressed genes, which are principally associated with tapetal development, degeneration, and pollen wall formation, had changed expression in ptc1 anthers. Moreover, the regulatory role of PTC1 in anther development was revealed by comparison with MS1 and other rice anther developmental regulators. These findings suggest a diversified and conserved switch of PTC1/MS1 in regulating programmed male reproductive development in both dicots and monocots, which provides new insights in plant anther development.",

We characterized and visualized the BCN stabilized o/w emulsions by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM). Due to the sustainability and low environmental impact of chitosan, the BCN-based emulsions open up opportunities for the development of an environmental friendly new interface material as well as the novel type of microreactor utilizing bacterial cells network.",

Consequently, the generation of peripheral T and B cells is abrogated. Cells of the myeloid lineage develop normally in Ptch mutant mice.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) in the signal transduction leading to Erk activation in PTC cells. In normal thyroid cells, CaMKII and Erk were in the inactive form in the absence of stimulation. In primary PTC cultures and in PTC cell lines harboring the oncogenes RET/PTC-1 or BRaf(V600E), CaMKII was active also in the absence of any stimulation. Inhibition of calmodulin or phospholipase C (PLC) attenuated the level of CaMKII activation. Expression of recombinant RET/PTC-3, BRaf(V600E), or Ras(V12) induced CaMKII activation. Inhibition of CaMKII attenuated Erk activation and DNA synthesis in thyroid papillary carcinoma (TPC-1), a cell line harboring RET/PTC-1, suggesting that CaMKII is a component of the Erk signal cascade in this cell line. In conclusion, PTCs contain an active PLC/Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent signal inducing constitutive activation of CaMKII. This kinase is activated by BRaf(V600E), oncogenic Ras, and by RET/PTC. CaMKII participates to the activation of the Erk pathway by oncogenic Ras and RET/PTC and contributes to their signal output, thus modulating tumor cell proliferation.",

RET functions as a multicompetent receptor complex that includes alphaGFRs and RET. Somatic rearrangements of RET designated as RET/PTC (from papillary thyroid carcinoma) were identified in papillary thyroid carcinoma before RET was recognized as the susceptibility gene for MEN2. There are now at least at least 15 types of RET/PTC rearrangements involving RET and 10 different genes. RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3 are by far the most common rearrangements. All of the rearrangements are due to DNA damage and result in the fusion of the RET tyrosine-kinase (RET-TK) domain to the 5'-terminal region of heterologous genes. RET/PTC rearrangements are very common in radiation-induced tumors but have been detected in variable proportions of sporadic (i.e., non-radiation associated) papillary carcinomas. It is estimated that up to approximately half the papillary thyroid carcinomas in the United States and Canada harbor RET/PTC rearrangements, most commonly RET/PTC-1, followed by RET/PTC-3 and occasionally RET/PTC-2. The cause of these rearrangements in sporadic papillary carcinomas is not known, but the close association between their presence and the papillary carcinoma phenotype indicates that they play a causative role in tumor development. The proposed mechanisms of RET/PTC-induced tumorigenesis and the clinical and pathologic implications of RET/PTC activation are discussed.",

It is also found in a subset of papillary microcarcinomas, consistent with a role in tumor initiation. PTCs with BRAFT1799A are often invasive and present at a more advanced stage. BRAFT1799A is found with high prevalence in tall-cell variant PTCs and in poorly differentiated and undifferentiated carcinomas arising from PTCs. To explore the role of BRAFV600E in thyroid cancer pathogenesis, we targeted its expression to thyroid cells of transgenic FVB/N mice with a bovine thyroglobulin promoter. Two Tg-BRAFV600E lines (Tg-BRAF2 and Tg-BRAF3) were propagated for detailed analysis. Tg-BRAF2 and Tg-BRAF3 mice had increased thyroid-stimulating hormone levels (>7- and approximately 2-fold, respectively). This likely resulted from decreased expression of thyroid peroxidase, sodium iodine symporter, and thyroglobulin. All lines seemed to successfully compensate for thyroid dysfunction, as serum thyroxine/triiodothyronine and somatic growth were normal. Thyroid glands of transgenic mice were markedly enlarged by 5 weeks of age. In Tg-BRAF2 mice, PTCs were present at 12 and 22 weeks in 14 of 15 and 13 of 14 animals, respectively, with 83% exhibiting tall-cell features, 83% areas of invasion, and 48% foci of poorly differentiated carcinoma. Tg-BRAF3 mice also developed PTCs, albeit with lower prevalence (3 of 12 and 4 of 9 at 12 and 22 weeks, respectively). Tg-BRAF2 mice had a 30% decrease in survival at 5 months. In summary, thyroid-specific expression of BRAFV600E induces goiter and invasive PTC, which transitions to poorly differentiated carcinomas. This closely recapitulates the phenotype of BRAF-positive PTCs in humans and supports a key role for this oncogene in its pathogenesis.",

Although several proteins have been identified to be substrates of RET/PTC kinases, the pathogenic roles played by RET/PTC in malignant and benign thyroid diseases and the molecular mechanisms that are involved are not fully understood. We found that RET/PTC expression phosphorylates the Y701 residue of STAT1, a type II interferon (IFN)-responsive protein. RET/PTC-mediated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) phosphorylation requires RET/PTC kinase activity to be intact but other tyrosine kinases, such as Janus kinases or c-Src, are not involved. RET/PTC-induced STAT1 transcriptional activation was not inhibited by suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 or -3, or protein inhibitors of activated STAT3 [(protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS3)], but PIAS1 strongly repressed the RET/PTC-induced transcriptional activity of STAT1. RET/PTC-induced STAT1 activation caused IFN regulatory factor-1 expression. We found that STAT1 and IFN regulatory factor-1 cooperated to significantly increase transcription from type IV IFN-gamma responsive promoters of class II transactivator genes. Significantly, cells stably expressing RET/PTC expressed class II transactivator and showed enhanced de novo membrane expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II proteins. Furthermore, RET/PTC1-bearing papillary thyroid carcinoma cells strongly expressed MHC class II (human leukocyte-associated antigen-DR alpha) genes, whereas the surrounding normal tissues did not. Thus, RET/PTC is able to phosphorylate and activate STAT1. This may lead to enhanced MHC class II expression, which may explain why the tissues surrounding RET/PTC-positive cancers are infiltrated with lymphocytes. Such immune response-promoting activity of RET/PTC may also relate to the development of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.",

The V599E mutation is highly prevalent in PTC with a papillary or mixed papillary follicular growth pattern, and the K600E mutation is apparently restricted to the follicular variant of PTC. It is usually accepted that thyroid malignancies may follow a progression path from well-differentiated to poorly differentiated (PDC) and undifferentiated (UC) carcinomas. One would expect that at least some of the less differentiated carcinomas would harbour the genetic alterations of pre-existing well-differentiated tumours. In order to find the prevalence of BRAF mutations in PDC and UC, we screened a series of 19 PDCs and 17 UCs, as well as 3 UC-derived cell lines, for both mutation types. The group of PDCs was restricted to the so-called insular and insular-like PDCs, thus excluding PTCs with solid, insular or trabecular foci of growth and PDCs displaying typical PTC nuclei. No BRAF mutations were detected in any of the 19 cases of PDC, whereas 6 of the UCs (35%) and one UC-derived cell line presented the BRAFV599E mutation. The BRAFK600E mutation was not detected in any case. We conclude that UC may progress from BRAFV599E-mutated PTC. The absence of BRAF mutations in our series of PDC supports the assumption that pure insular and insular-like PDCs are more closely related to follicular carcinoma than to PTC.",

This thyroid-specific rearrangement causes aberrant expression of RET/PTC and results in constitutive ligand-independent activation of RET kinase. However, it is unclear how RET/PTC activates the specific signaling pathways for cellular transformation. In this study, we show that RET/PTC associates with signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and activates it by the specific phosphorylation of the tyrosine 705 residue. Activation of STAT3 requires the intrinsic kinase activity of RET/PTC; Janus tyrosine kinase and c-Src kinase are not involved in the RET/PTC-mediated activation of STAT3. RET/PTC-induced activation of STAT3 induces the STAT3-responsive genes, vascular endothelial growth factor, cyclin D1, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1. In addition, RET/PTC-mediated cellular transformation and proliferation of transformed cells require tyrosine 705 phosphorylation of STAT3 in NIH3T3 cells. We conclude that STAT3 activation by the RET/PTC tyrosine kinase is one of the critical signaling pathways for the regulation of specific genes, such as cyclin D1, vascular endothelial growth factor, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and for cellular transformation.",

Here, we show that the transcription factors Gli2 and Gli3, mediators of Shh signaling, are required for the development of the ventral cell fates but make distinct contributions to controlling cell fates at different locations along the rostral-caudal axis. Mutants lacking Patched1 (Ptc1), the putative receptor of Shh, were used to analyze Gli functions. Ptc1(-/-) mutants develop floor plate, motor neuron, and V3 interneuron progenitors in lateral and dorsal regions, suggesting that the normal role of Ptc1 is to suppress ventral cell development in dorsal neural tube. The Ptc1(-/-) phenotype is rescued, with restoration of dorsal cell types, by the lack of Gli2, but only in the caudal neural tube. In triple mutants of Gli2, Gli3, and Ptc1, dorsal and lateral cell fates are restored in the entire neural tube. These observations suggest that Gli2 is essential for ventral specification in the caudal neural tube, and that in more rostral regions, only Gli3 can promote development of ventral cells if Gli2 is absent. Thus, Shh signaling is mediated by overlapping but distinct functions of Gli2 and Gli3, and their relative contributions vary along the rostral-caudal axis.",

This different behavior of cancer cells originating from one organ was investigated by layering multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) consisting of various kinds of human thyroid cells onto confluent monolayers of human venous endothelial cells (HEC). The MCTS and HEC were cocultured in an incubation chamber fixed under a microscope, and the behavior of the cells was investigated. In this way significant differences between FTC, PTC, and follicular adenoma cells (FTA) were observed regarding their in vitro behavior upon interaction with HEC. FTC cells required 20 min for adhesion and another hour until they migrated out of a spheroid, whereas PTC- and FTA-MCTS were adhesive after 2 h or later, and their cells did not start migration until 5 h of incubation. Furthermore, one FTC-spheroid triggered about 100 endothelial cells to enter the replication cycle, while no spheroid consisting of either PTC or FTA cells induced more than 20 endothelial cells to start proliferation. During these processes, the cells of the MCTS and the endothelial cells contacted each other directly and remained viable. The results show that FTC cells interact faster and more intensively with human endothelial cells than PTC and FTA cells. Thus the study suggests that an enhanced capability of the FTC cells to interact with venous endothelial cells might favor the clinically observed hematogenous spreading of follicular thyroid carcinomas.",

Falcine calcification was graded into dense, fine but definite, and faint. 85 people with BCNS had nearly 100% incidence of falcine calcification in adults. 83 first degree unaffected relatives showed no excess over \"normal\" incidence of falcine calcification. In the 970 casualty patients some falcine calcification was common (> 20%) in males over 30 and in females over 50 years of age. It occurred earlier and was more common in males than in females.

In conclusion, falcine calcification should be regarded as the fourth major feature and a very important diagnostic feature of BCNS.

Large cell size, pseudoinclusions, nuclear grooves, and multiple well-defined vacuoles in atypical histiocytoid cells favor PTC over benign histiocytes.

The application of electron microscopy, immunohistology, and other adjunctive pathological techniques is effective in refining the differential diagnosis between primary thymic carcinoma (PTC) and several other histological simulators. However, the distinction between PTC and carcinomas that involve the thymic region by metastasis from other sites is a difficult one, and ultimately must be predicated on detailed clinical and radiographic information.

Although multiple studies have contributed to a better understanding of the genetic alterations underlying this frequently arising disease, the downstream molecular effectors that impact PTC pathogenesis remain to be further defined. Here, we report that the regulator of cell fate specification, PROX1, becomes inactivated in PTC through mRNA downregulation and cytoplasmic mislocalization. Expression studies in clinical specimens revealed that aberrantly activated NOTCH signaling promoted PROX1 downregulation and that cytoplasmic mislocalization significantly altered PROX1 protein stability. Importantly, restoration of PROX1 activity in thyroid carcinoma cells revealed that PROX1 not only enhanced Wnt/β-catenin signaling but also regulated several genes known to be associated with PTC, including thyroid cancer protein (TC)-1, SERPINA1, and FABP4. Furthermore, PROX1 reexpression suppressed the malignant phenotypes of thyroid carcinoma cells, such as proliferation, motility, adhesion, invasion, anchorage-independent growth, and polyploidy. Moreover, animal xenograft studies demonstrated that restoration of PROX1 severely impeded tumor formation and suppressed the invasiveness and the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of PTC cells. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that NOTCH-induced PROX1 inactivation significantly promotes the malignant behavior of thyroid carcinoma and suggest that PROX1 reactivation may represent a potential therapeutic strategy to attenuate disease progression.",

Although BRAF(V600E) inhibitors are available, lack of response has been frequently observed. To study the mechanism underlying intrinsic resistance to the mutant BRAF(V600E) selective inhibitor vemurafenib, we established short-term primary cell cultures of human metastatic/recurrent BRAF(V600E)-PTC, intrathyroidal BRAF(V600E)-PTC, and normal thyroid (NT). We also generated an early intervention model of human BRAF(V600E)-PTC orthotopic mouse. We find that metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cells elicit paracrine-signaling which trigger migration of pericytes, blood endothelial cells and lymphatic endothelial cells as compared to BRAF(WT)-PTC cells, and show a higher rate of invasion. We further show that vemurafenib therapy significantly suppresses these aberrant functions in non-metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cells but lesser in metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cells as compared to vehicle treatment. These results concur with similar folds of down-regulation of tumor microenvironment-associated pro-metastatic molecules, with no effects in BRAF(WT)-PTC and NT cells. Our early intervention preclinical trial shows that vemurafenib delays tumor growth in the orthotopic BRAF(WT/V600E)-PTC mice. Importantly, we identify high copy number gain of MCL1 (chromosome 1q) and loss of CDKN2A (P16, chromosome 9p) in metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cells which are associated with resistance to vemurafenib treatment. Critically, we demonstrate that combined vemurafenib therapy with BCL2/MCL1 inhibitor increases metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cell death and ameliorates response to vemurafenib treatment as compared to single agent treatment. In conclusion, short-term PTC and NT cultures offer a predictive model for evaluating therapeutic response in patients with PTC. Our PTC pre-clinical model suggests that combined targeted therapy might be an important therapeutic strategy for metastatic and refractory BRAF(V600E)-positive PTC.",

PTCH, a 12-pass transmembrane protein, is a receptor for Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling proteins. Shh proteins activate transcription of target genes, including PTCH, via GLI transcription factors. Here we identified seven and five isoforms of human and mouse PTCH mRNA, respectively, which are generated by the complex alternative use of five exons as the first exon (exons 1a to 1e in the 5'-to-3' order). Although expression profiles of these isoforms were highly variable among human tissues, three of them, PTCHa, PTCHb, and PTCHd, were predominantly expressed in most tissues, PTCHd being most ubiquitous. In contrast, PTCHb was always predominant and reached a maximum at E10.5 during mouse development. These three mRNA isoforms encode three PTCH proteins with distinct N-termini, PTCH(L), PTCH(M), and PTCH(S). The expression of these three isoforms was regulated by GLI transcription factors, and at least two functional GLI-binding sequences were identified, one in exon 1a and the other between exon 1a and exon 1b. PTCH(L) and PTCH(M) were equally active in terms of suppressing GLI-mediated transcription and inducing apoptosis. PTCH(S) protein (encoded by PTCHd), lacking the first transmembrane domain, was more unstable than the other two, resulting in a reduced activity. This study may shed light on the mechanism whereby a single PTCH gene plays a role in both tumor cell growth and embryonic development.",

The tumor incidence decreases dramatically when Ptch is mutated in Myf5- or Pax3-expressing cells. No RMS develop from Myogenin/Mef2c-expressing cells. This suggests that Hh/Ptch-associated RMS are derived from Delta1-positive, Myf5-negative, Myogenin-negative and Pax3-negative mesodermal progenitors that can undergo myogenic differentiation but lack stable lineage commitment. Additional preliminary genetic data and data on mesodermal progenitors further imply an interplay of Hh/Ptch and Delta/Notch signaling activity during RMS initiation. In contrast, Wnt signals supposedly suppress RMS formation because RMS multiplicity decreases after inactivation of the Wnt-inhibitor Wif1.

However, concern has emerged about the late effects of cancer therapy, especially radiation-related second cancers. Studies of childhood cancer patients with inherited cancer syndromes can provide insights into the interaction between radiation and genetic susceptibility to multiple cancers. Children with retinoblastoma (Rb), neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), and nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) are at substantial risk of developing radiation-related second and third cancers. A radiation dose-response for bone and soft-tissue sarcomas has been observed in hereditary Rb patients, with many of these cancers occurring in the radiation field. Studies of NF1 patients irradiated for optic pathway gliomas have reported increased risks of developing another cancer associated with radiotherapy. High relative risks for second and third cancers were observed for a cohort of 200 LFS family members, especially children, possibly related to radiotherapy. Children with NBCCS are very sensitive to radiation and develop multiple basal cell cancers in irradiated areas. Clinicians following these patients should be aware of their increased genetic susceptibility to multiple primary malignancies enhanced by sensitivity to ionizing radiation.",

The biological reasons for these irregularities are obscure, but evidence has been presented that they might be linked to RET÷PTC gene translocation. In the present study, we have investigated the hypothesis that the NM irregularities in PTC might be linked to alterations in the expression of lamin B receptor (LBR), a component of the inner NM responsible for the distribution of Lamin B and associated chromatin. Fisher AH et al. already reported on the lack of LBR in PTC, a finding in contrast with the observation that a reduced expression of LBR because of gene mutation is responsible for the lack of nuclear segmentation of granulocytes in Pelger-Huët anomaly. In the present study, we confirmed the lack of immunohistochemical staining for LBR in PTC nuclei, in contrast to a positive staining in intestinal epithelium and stromal cells. However, Western blot and RT-PCR analysis demonstrated a strongly positive reaction in PTC extracts, thus proving an expression of LBR higher in PTC cases and cells than in follicular carcinoma cells. In conclusion, our data suggest that LBR is heavily expressed in PTC cells, but an abnormal folding of the protein might explain its lack of immunohistochemical reactivity and be associated with the anomalous folding of the NM.",

We previously demonstrated that the hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway was aberrantly up-regulated in a mouse model that phenocopies the human MEN-1 syndrome, Men1l/l;RipCre, and that inhibition of this pathway suppresses MEN-1 tumor cell proliferation. We hypothesized that the HH signaling pathway is similarly upregulated in human PNETs. We performed immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for PTCH1 in human fresh and archival PNET specimens to examine whether human sporadic and MEN-1-associated PNETs revealed similar abnormalities as in our mouse model and correlated the results with clinical and demographic factors of the study cohort. PTCH1 staining was positive in 12 of 22 PNET patients (55%). Four of 5 MEN-1 patients stained for PTCH1 (p = 0.32 as compared with sporadic disease patients). Nine of 16 patients with metastatic disease stained for PTCH1 as compared with zero of 3 with localized disease only (p = 0.21). No demographic or clinical features appeared to be predictive of PTCH 1 positivity and PTCH 1 positivity per se was not predictive of clinical outcome. PTCH1, a marker of HH pathway up regulation, is detectable in both primary and metastatic tumors in more than 50% of PNET patients. Although no clinical or demographic factors predict PTCH1 positivity and PTCH1 positivity does not predict clinical outcome, the frequency of expression alone indicates that perturbation of this pathway with agents such as Vismodegib, an inhibitor of Smoothened (SMO), should be examined in future clinical trials.

        "Doc_abstract":"Dysregulation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway is central to the development of certain tumor types, including medulloblastoma and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Patched1 (Ptch1) and Suppressor of fused (Sufu) are two essential negative regulators of the pathway with tumor suppressor activity. Ptch1(+/-) mice are predisposed to developing medulloblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma, while Sufu(+/-) mice develop a skin phenotype characterized by basaloid epidermal proliferations. Here, we have studied tumor development in Sufu(+/-)Ptch1(+/-) mice to determine the effect of compound heterozygosity on the onset, incidence, and spectrum of tumors. We found significantly more (2.3-fold) basaloid proliferations in Sufu(+/-)Ptch1(+/-) compared to Sufu(+/-) female, but not male, mice. For medulloblastoma, the cumulative 1-yr incidence was 1.5-fold higher in Sufu(+/-)Ptch1(+/-) compared to Ptch1(+/-) female mice but this strong trend was not statistically significant. Together this suggests a weak genetic interaction of the two tumor suppressor genes. We noted a few rhabdomyosarcomas and pancreatic cysts in the Sufu(+/-)Ptch1(+/-) mice, but the numbers were not significantly different from the single heterozygous mice. Hydrocephalus developed in approximately 20% of the Ptch1(+/-) and Sufu(+/-)Ptch1(+/-) but not in Sufu(+/-) mice. Interestingly, most of the medulloblastomas from the Sufu(+/-)Ptch1(+/-) mice had lost expression of the remaining Ptch1 wild-type allele but not the Sufu wild-type allele. On the contrary, Sufu as well as Gli1 and Gli2 expression was upregulated in the medulloblastomas compared to adult cerebellum in Ptch1(+/-) and Sufu(+/-)Ptch1(+/-) mice. This suggests that Sufu expression may be regulated by Hedgehog pathway activity and could constitute another negative feedback loop in the pathway.",

During early fin development in zebrafish, a subset of cells in the posterior margin of pectoral fin buds express shh. We have shown that regulation of shh in pectoral fin buds is consistent with a role in mediating the activity of a structure analogous to the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) (Akimenko and Ekker (1995) Dev. Biol. 170, 243-247). During growth of the bony rays of both paired and unpaired fins, and during fin regeneration, there does not seem to be a region equivalent to the ZPA and one would predict that shh would play a different role, if any, during these processes specific to fish fins. We have examined the expression of shh in the developing fins of 4-week old larvae and in regenerating fins of adults. A subset of cells in the basal layer of the epidermis in close proximity to the newly formed dermal bone structures of the fin rays, the lepidotrichia, express shh, and ptc1 which is thought to encode the receptor of the SHH signal. The expression domain of ptc1 is broader than that of shh and adjacent blastemal cells releasing the dermal bone matrix also express ptc1. Further observations indicate that the bmp2 gene, in addition to being expressed in the same cells of the basal layer of the epidermis as shh, is also expressed in a subset of the ptc1-expressing cells of the blastema. Amputations of caudal fins immediately after the first branching point of the lepidotrichia, and global administration of all-trans-retinoic acid, two procedures known to cause fusion of adjacent rays, result in a transient decrease in the expression of shh, ptc1 and bmp2. The effects of retinoic acid on shh expression occur within minutes after the onset of treatment suggesting direct regulation of shh by retinoic acid. These observations suggest a role for shh, ptc1 and bmp2 in patterning of the dermoskeleton of developing and regenerating teleost fins.",

To investigate the roles of RET rearrangement in the carcinogenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma, we have studied RET activation and p53 overexpression in various thyroid lesions of the Japanese population by immunohistochemical technique. RET activation and p53 overexpression were studied in 40 papillary carcinomas, 6 poorly differentiated carcinomas, 4 undifferentiated carcinomas, 2 medullary carcinomas, 2 follicular carcinomas and 19 follicular adenomas. RET activation was observed in 12 out of 40 papillary carcinomas, while no immunoreactivity of RET was detected in other lesions. P53 overexpression was observed in only 1 of 40 papillary carcinomas, but in 2 poorly differentiated carcinomas and 4 undifferentiated carcinomas. The prevalence of RET/PTC activation in papillary carcinoma among the Japanese population was higher than in previous reports.

Restoration of miR-101 expression significantly inhibited cell proliferation in the K1 PTC cell line. Moreover, algorithm-based and experimental strategies verified Rac1 as a direct target of miR-101 in the K1 cell line.

Accordingly, this study aimed to investigate the potential involvement of miR-663 in PTC. In this study, miR-663 expression level was measured via quantitative real-time PCR in 91 pairs of human PTC and adjacent normal tissues and in two human PTC cell lines. The effect of miR-663 on PTC cell invasion and migration were studied by transwell and wound healing assays. In addition, the miR-663 target was searched and the underlying mechanism was clarified by reporter assay and rescue experiment. The current study confirmed that miR-663 expression was inhibited in PTC tissue samples and PTC cell lines. There were statistically significant differences in expression of miR-663 with regard to age and tumor size. Upregulation of miR-663 suppressed PTC cell invasion and migration. Further study showed that transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1) was the direct target of miR-663 and mediated the effect of miR-663 on PTC development. By targeting TGFβ1, miR-663 efficiently regulates the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).

Expression of the Ptch-Smo receptor complex on in vitro NCCs was also shown. In whole embryos, the expression of Shh mRNA and protein was seen in the ocular region, and of Ptch, Smo and Gli/Sufu system on cephalic NCCs. Anti-Smo MO or Ptch-mutated plasmid (Ptch1(Δloop2)) impaired cephalic NCC migration/distribution, with fewer cells invading the optic region and with higher cell density at the homolateral mesencephalic level. Beads embedded with cyclopamine (Smo-blocking) or Shh (ectopic signal) supported the role of Shh as an in vivo guide molecule for cephalic NCCs. Ethanol exposure perturbed in vitro and in vivo NCC migration. Early stage embryos treated with ethanol, in a model reproducing Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, showed later disruptions of craniofacial development associated with abnormal in situ expression of Shh morphogen. The results show the Shh/Ptch/Smo-dependent migration of NCCs toward the optic vesicle, with the support of specific inactivation with genetic and pharmacological tools. They also help to understand mechanisms of accurate distribution of embryonic cells and of their perturbation by a commonly consumed teratogen, and demonstrate, in addition to its other known developmental functions, a new biological activity of cellular guidance for Shh.

In this report, we demonstrate that although ptp2 has no obvious phenotype by itself, it has a profound effect on cell growth when combined with mutations in a novel protein phosphatase gene. Using a colony color sectoring assay, we isolated 25 mutants in which the expression of PTP1 or PTP2 is required for growth. Complementation tests of the mutants showed that they have a mutation in one of three genes. Cloning and sequence determination of one of these gene, PTC1, indicated that it encodes a homolog of the mammalian protein serine/threonine phosphatase 2C (PP2C). The amino acid sequence of the PTC1 product is approximately 35% identical to PP2C. Disruption of PTC1 indicated that the PTC1 function is nonessential. In contrast, ptc1 ptp2 double mutants showed a marked growth defect. To examine whether PTC1 encodes an active protein phosphatase, a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-PTC1 fusion gene was constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli.

Oncogenic potential in thyrocytes results from replacing the 5' portion by regulatory parts of other genes, leading to constitutive TK expression. In Italy, human papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) shows a frequent activation (50%) of the TK receptor genes NTRK1 and RET. Both genes undergo oncogenic rearrangements by the same mechanism. We previously reported high frequency (6/11) of rearrangement of the RET protooncogene in Chinese PTCs. Wide differences in the frequency (0-10.9%) of the NTRK1 rearrangement in PTCs have been reported in different populations. To investigate the frequency of TRK protooncogene rearrangement in Chinese thyroid tumors, we performed reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to amplify specific TRK rearrangement transcripts. We examined thyroid tumors of 40 patients, including 14 papillary carcinomas, 4 follicular carcinomas, 1 Hurthle cell carcinoma, 1 insular carcinoma, and 20 nodular goiters. NF874 NIH3T3, NF723 NIH3T3, NF861 NIH3T3, and NF881 NIH3T3 were used as controls for TRK-T3, TRK-T2, TRK-T1, and TRK, respectively. No known TRK protooncogene rearrangements were detected among the 40 thyroid tumors in our studies. We suggest that the TK receptor NTRK1 activation seems less important than RET activation in PTCs in the Chinese population.",

A persistent duct can lead to thyroglossal duct cyst (TGDC). Histologically, TGDC contains an epithelial lining of squamous or pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium and ectopic thyroid gland tissue in the duct wall. TGD-associated malignancy is rare, and the majority is papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). A total of 242 patients with a diagnosis of TGD-associated lesions were identified in our institute. Two hundred and seventeen cases were diagnosed as TGDC. Sixty-eight of 217 (31.3 %) cases of TGDC had ectopic thyroid tissue in the cystic wall. Thirty-nine cases had preoperative fine needle aspiration (FNA). Of these cases, 37 of 39 (94.9 %) demonstrated macrophages and 19 (48.7 %) also showed cells of squamous and/or columnar epithelial lining. Only two cases showed rare thyroid follicular cells. Thyroid carcinoma was identified in 18 of 242 (7.4 %) cases. All cases were diagnosed as PTC including 12 cases of classic PTC (66.7 %), 3 cases of follicular variant (16.7 %), 2 cases of tall cell variant (11.1 %), and 1 case of classic PTC with focal tall cell features (5.6 %). Nine cases had TGD component (either epithelial lining cysts or ectopic thyroid tissue). Ten patients also underwent total thyroidectomy (67 %). Of these patients, four had no tumor and one had an incidental medullary carcinoma. Five of 10 (50 %) cases had incidental PTC with a size range of 0.1-0.3 cm. Five patients had follow-up by imaging studies; no suspicious or nodular lesions were found in the thyroid. In conclusion, we report an institutional case cohort of 242 patients with TGD-associated lesions, including 217 TGDC and 18 cases of PTC. Only seven cases fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of TGD-associated PTC, i.e., the presence of components of TGD and a normal thyroid. In the remaining 11 cases, we could not differentiate with certainty between pyramidal primary thyroid PTC/Delphian node metastasis or TGD-associated PTC.",

The carcinomatous component grew in the form of anastomosing narrow tubules, clustered glands, solid sheets with or without squamous differentiation, and/or papillae, and exhibited the typical nuclear features of PTC. The abundant stroma had a nodular fasciitis-like quality and was composed of short fascicles of spindle cells separated by varying amounts of mucoid matrix, collagen, and extravasated red blood cells; this was interpreted as an exuberant mesenchymal reaction to the carcinoma. The importance of recognizing this variant of PTC is that, when one encounters a fibroproliferative lesion of the thyroid, a diligent search should be made for papillary carcinoma. This variant also must be distinguished from the vastly more aggressive papillary carcinomas with anaplastic transformation and the so-called carcinosarcomas.",

Chromosome 9q is often partially deleted in bladder cancer, lung cancer, and basal cell carcinoma. However, little data are available on allelic loss on chromosome 9 in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). One hundred and nine nonpapillary RCCs were studied for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 13 loci on chromosome 9 by using the fluorescent multiplex-polymerase chain reaction method to compare DNA from tumor samples and peripheral blood lymphocytes. At the loci tested, LOH was found in from 2.3% (9q31, D9S938) to 17% (9q22, 1AJL) of informative cases, and 27 (24.8%) of the 109 RCCs had LOH at 1 or more loci of chromosome 9. LOH was more often detected at 9q22 within the PTCH gene (17%) when compared with LOH at the other 12 loci (P = 0.0172). Regarding the relationship with clinical parameters, however, there were no statistically significant associations between this LOH and tumor stage or grade. Among the 109 tumors, 6 (5.5%) showed replication errors.

The aim of this study was to compare the expression of CK17 in patients with PTC with that observed in normal thyroid tissue and benign thyroid lesions, and to examine the relationship between CK17 expression and clinicopathologic characteristics of patients with PTC. CK17 protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays containing thyroid tissue samples from 108 PTCs, 16 nodular goiters, and 81 healthy controls. Sixty-five of the 108 (60.2%) PTC tissue samples exhibited positive CK17 expression, whereas all nodular goiters and normal thyroid tissue samples showed a complete absence of CK17 immunoreactivity. The difference in frequency of CK17 positivity between PTC (65/108, 60.2%), normal thyroid tissue (0/81, 0.0%), and benign thyroid lesions (0/16, 0.0%) was statistically significant (P<0.001). Positive CK17 expression in PTC was significantly associated with the presence of lymph node metastasis (P=0.024) and higher pN stage (P=0.028).

To this end, we show results on the in vitro interactions between F9 murine embryonal carcinoma cells (EC cells) and primary cultures of murine PTCs, using contact-dependent and contact-independent 2D co-cultures. In these circumstances, when EC cells interact with PTCs they change their migratory behavior and matrix-metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) was up-regulated in PTCs. Additionally, among a variety of cytokines implicated in tumor-stroma cross-talk, we have examined in more detail the influence of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). In this regard, it was observed that this cytokine induced a MMP-9 secretion by PTCs in a pattern dependent on its concentration, whereas does not increase the migration capacity of cancer cells. All together, our results provide evidence for a role played by peritubular myoid cells and cancer-cell secreted TNF- α for a change in the tumor microenvironment during the early stages of EC progression.

Both are autosomal dominantly inherited disorders. Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome is characterized by the early onset of multiple basal cell carcinomas as as well as developmental defects and a predisposition for other benign and malignant tumors. The syndrome is caused by germline mutations in the PTCH tumor suppressor gene. Cowden syndrome is associated with pathognomonic mucocutaneous lesions, such as facial trichilemmomas, acral keratoses, and mucocutaneous papillomatosis. In addition, Cowden patients are predisposed to carcinomas of the thyroid, breast and endometrium. Cowden syndrome is caused by germline mutations in the PTEN tumor suppressor gene. Identification of the genes causing hereditary tumor syndromes as well as generation of genetically engineered mouse models have greatly advanced our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of these diseases.

Ribonucleic acid extracted from frozen tissue was reverse transcribed; PCR was performed to amplify ret/PTC-1, 2, and -3. The TPC-1 cell line was the positive control for ret/PTC-1. All tumors were characterized morphologically. Clinical data were collected. The 57 papillary and 3 follicular carcinomas were resected from 44 female patients and 15 males. The average age at diagnosis was 46.2 yr (range. 24-83 yr). Three patients had a history of neck irradiation. At diagnosis, 11 patients had extrathyroidal tumor extension, 20 had lymph node metastases, and 1 had lung metastasis. Thirteen patients had tall cell papillary carcinomas; 3 tumors had focal insular or anaplastic dedifferentiation. The average follow-up was 13.4 months, during which 4 patients had recurrent disease. No deaths occurred. One papillary carcinoma (1.7%) was positive for ret/PTC-1, none was positive for ret/PTC-2, and 2(3.4%) were positive for ret/PTC-3.

FNA revealed a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with Hürthle cells demonstrating abnormal chromatin patterns, nuclear enlargement, pleomorphism, intranuclear cytoplasmic invaginations, and foci of papillary aggregates. Because of the degree of nuclear atypia and suspicion for concurrent papillary thyroid carcinoma, a total thyroidectomy was performed revealing a papillary arrangement of Hürthle cells with classic PTC nuclear changes and associated Hashimoto's thyroiditis. This report discusses cytopathological features of a rare variant of PTC (oncocytic subtype) in the background of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

Here, we investigated the clinical significance of Ep-ICD subcellular localization index (ESLI) in distinguishing aggressive papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) from non-aggressive cases.;Using domain specific antibodies against the intracellular (Ep-ICD) and extracellular (EpEx) domains of epithelial cell adhesion molecule, 200 archived tissues from a new cohort of patients with benign thyroid disease as well as malignant aggressive and non aggressive PTC were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). ESLI was defined as sum of the IHC scores for accumulation of nuclear and cytoplasmic Ep-ICD and loss of membranous EpEx; ESLI = [Ep-ICD(nuc) + Ep-ICD(cyt) + loss of membranous EpEx].;For the benign thyroid tissues, non-aggressive PTC and aggressive PTC, the mean ESLI scores were 4.5, 6.7 and 11 respectively. Immunofluorescence double staining confirmed increased nuclear Ep-ICD accumulation and decreased membrane EpEx expression in aggressive PTC. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.841, 70.2% sensitivity and 83.9% specificity for nuclear Ep-ICD for differentiating aggressive PTC from non-aggressive PTC. ESLI distinguished aggressive PTC from non-aggressive cases with improved AUC of 0.924, 88.4% sensitivity and 85.5% specificity. Our study confirms nuclear accumulation of Ep-ICD and loss of membranous EpEx occurs in aggressive PTC underscoring the potential of Ep-ICD and ESLI to serve as diagnostic markers for aggressive PTC. Kaplan Meier survival analysis revealed significantly reduced disease free survival (DFS) for ESLI positive (cutoff >10) PTC (p<0.05), mean DFS=133 months as compared to 210 months for patients who did not show positive ESLI.;ESLI scoring improves the identification of aggressive PTC and thereby may serve as a useful index for defining aggressiveness and poor prognosis among PTC patients.",

Accumulating evidences have confirmed the important roles of CXCR7 in tumor cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Our previous study demonstrated CXCR7 modulated proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion of PTC cells. In this study, we evaluated the effect of expression of CXCR7 in PTC cells on angiogenesis and whether its expression had an influence on the tumor growth of PTC in vivo. We evaluated the effect of CXCR7 on interleukin-8 (IL-8) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion, angiogenesis, and tumor growth by ELISA, endothelial tube formation assay, and a xenograft tumor model in nude mice. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess expression of CD34 in tumor of mice. In vitro and in vivo studies in PTC cells suggested that the alteration of CXCR7 expression was correlated with angiogenesis and tumor growth. Moreover, CXCR7 mediated the expression of IL-8 and VEGF, which might be involved in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis. These findings suggest that CXCR7 affects the growth of PTC cells and participates in the tumorigenesis of PTC, probably through regulating angiogenesis by the proangiogenic VEGF or IL-8. ",

Here, we test whether the oncoprotein RET/PTC could be responsible for this effect, since RET/PTC rearrangements are quite prevalent in PTC and RET/PTC activates PLCgamma, an upstream modulator of PKCs. At 3 h after induction of RET/PTC1 or RET/PTC3 expression, there was evidence of PKCepsilon activation. Activation was restricted to PKCepsilon, as acute expression of RET/PTC did not change the subcellular distribution of other PKC isozymes expressed in PCCL3 cells. Prolonged RET/PTC expression (2-6 days) produced an isozyme-specific change in PKCepsilon subcellular localization and a decrease in total PKCepsilon levels. The expression of RET/PTC3(Y541F), which does not interact with PLCgamma, but signals normally through other RET effectors, had no effect on PKCepsilon distribution at any of the time points examined. However, downregulation of total PKCepsilon levels was only partially prevented by expression of RET/PTC(Y541F). Cells with decreased PKCepsilon following prolonged expression of RET/PTC were relatively resistant to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Based on our previous observation that PCCL3 cells expressing a dominant-negative PKCepsilon are also markedly resistant to apoptosis, we propose that selective downregulation of PKCepsilon following prolonged RET/PTC activation promotes cell survival and clonal expansion.",

Fatty acid synthase (FASN) and c-Met are overexpressed in many types of human cancers. Recent studies have suggested a functional interaction between FASN and c-Met.

In this study, we evaluated the expressions of FASN and phosphorylated (p)-c-Met by using immunohistochemistry in thyroid carcinomas of follicular origin, from 32 patients. The adjacent non-neoplastic thyroid tissue was also evaluated for comparison. Immunoreactive intensity and extensiveness were semi-quantified. The overexpression of FASN was observed in a subset of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) including the classical type and tall cell, follicular, trabecular/insular and diffuse sclerosing variants, a subset of follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTC), and the PTC and FTC components in anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATC). No overexpression was observed in the ATCs per se and the columnar cell, solid, and cribriform variants of PTCs. All Hürthle cell variant FTCs and non-neoplastic Hürthle cells demonstrated positive staining for FASN while the non-neoplastic follicular cells without Hürthle cell change were negative. An association in overexpression between FASN and p-c-Met was observed in the majority of carcinomas as well as in the non-neoplastic Hürthle cells. In conclusion, overexpressions of FASN and p-c-Met were observed in a subset of thyroid carcinomas of follicular origin, which may be of values for targeted therapy and predicting prognosis while the positive immunostaining for these immunomarkers may be nonspecific for Hürthle cell thyroid carcinomas.",

Although the expression pattern of XPtc1 was similar to that of other vertebrates, expression domains specific to Xenopus could be detected in the hypochord, dorsal mesencephalon, otic vesicles and pituitary anlage. Unlike other vertebrate Ptc1 homologues, somitic expression of XPtc1 is confined to a central cell layer. In contrast to the tissue-specific expression characteristics of XPtc1, XSmo expression appears to be ubiquitously activated in early embryonic stages but condenses in the terminal regions of the embryo at tailbud stage. In many tissues and organs of the adult, XPtc1 and XSmo are found to display similar expression levels.",

To assess the role of mast cells in human thyroid cancer, we compared the density of tryptase-positive mast cells in 96 papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) versus normal thyroid tissue from 14 healthy individuals. Mast cell density was higher in 95% of PTCs (n=91) than in control tissue. Mast cell infiltrate correlated with extrathyroidal extension (P=0.0005) of PTCs. We show that thyroid cancer cell-line-derived soluble factors induce mast cell activation and chemoattraction in vitro. Different mast cell lines (HMC-1 and LAD2) and primary human lung mast cells induced thyroid cancer cell invasive ability, survival and DNA synthesis in vitro. The latter effect was mainly mediated by three mast-cell-derived mediators: histamine, and chemokines CXCL1/GROα and CXCL10/IP10. We show that xenografts of thyroid carcinoma cells (8505-C) could recruit mast cells injected into the tail vein of mice. Co-injection of human mast cells accelerated the growth of thyroid cancer cell (8505-C) xenografts in athymic mice. This effect was mediated by increased tumor vascularization and proliferation, and was reverted by treating mice with sodium cromoglycate (Cromolyn), a specific mast cell inhibitor. In conclusion, our study data suggest that mast cells are recruited into thyroid carcinomas and promote proliferation, survival and invasive ability of cancer cells, thereby contributing to thyroid carcinoma growth and invasiveness.",

In the first case, CT-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) was performed on a paratracheal mass representing extrathyroidal invasion of a right thyroid lobe tumor. The aspirate showed papillary fronds and cells in honeycombed arrangements with fine chromatin, enlarged nuclei, nuclear grooves, and intranuclear inclusions in a background of mucus and blood; a diagnosis of PTC was rendered initially. However, examination of histologic sections of the mass showed nests of malignant squamous cells with interspersed mucous cells and extracellular mucin, concordant with MEC, as well as PTC. A retrospective review of the FNA specimen identified MEC. In the second case, ultrasound-guided FNA was performed on a right thyroid lobe nodule. The aspirate contained two populations of epithelial cells: larger cells showing foci of both squamous and glandular differentiation that were interpreted as MEC and smaller follicular cells with nuclear changes characteristic of PTC; both were addressed in the diagnostic report. Primary MEC of the thyroid is a rare neoplasm typically exhibiting indolent clinical behavior, although our first case demonstrated extensive local invasion. It is thought to arise from squamous metaplasia associated with PTC, Hashimoto thyroiditis, or other inflammatory or neoplastic processes. In thyroid FNAs, the presence of neoplastic mucous cells and extracellular mucin plus malignant squamous cells is diagnostic of MEC.

We have previously shown that GPC3, another member of the glypican family, inhibits Hh signaling by competing with Patched 1 (Ptc1) for Hh binding. Furthermore, we showed that GPC3 binds to Hh through its core protein but not to Ptc1. In this paper, we demonstrate that GPC5 increases the binding of Sonic Hh to Ptc1. We also show that GPC5 binds to both Hh and Ptc1 through its glycosaminoglycan chains and that, unlike GPC3, GPC5 localizes to the primary cilia. Interestingly, we found that the heparan sulfate chains of GPC5 display a significantly higher degree of sulfation than those of GPC3.

RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3 are the most prevalent variants. We have found RET rearrangements in 35.8% of TCV (14 of 39 cases). Whereas the prevalences of RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3 were almost equal in classic and follicular PTC, all of the TCV-positive cases expressed the RET/PTC3 rearrangement. These findings prompted us to compare RET/PTC3 and RET/PTC1 in an in vitro thyroid model system. We have expressed the two oncogenes in PC Cl 3 rat thyroid epithelial cells and found that RET/PTC3 is endowed with a strikingly more potent mitogenic effect than RET/PTC1. Mechanistically, this difference correlated with an increased signaling activity of RET/PTC3.

Expression of RET/PTC oncogenes promotes neoplastic transformation of cultured thyroid cells and of thyroid glands in transgenic mice. Notwithstanding these oncogenic effects, we have found that the expression of two RET/PTC oncogenes (H4-RET and RFG-RET) induces apoptosis of rat thyroid PC CL 3 cells. Promotion of thyroid cell death depends on the kinase activity of RET/PTC and on the phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue (tyrosine 1062) that maps in the carboxy-terminus of the RET protein. Tyrosine 1062 is essential for RET/PTC-mediated activation of the Ras/ERK pathway. Inhibition of Ras/ERK by a dominant negative Ras or by the MEKI inhibitor, PD98059, obstructed RET/PTC-mediated apoptosis. We also show that signals transmitted by tyrosine 1062 mediate proapoptotic events like Bcl-2 down regulation and Bax upregulation, and that adoptive overexpression of Bcl-2 overcomes RET/PTC-induced apoptosis. Thus, gene rearrangements that generate RET/PTC oncogenes subvert RET function by converting it into a chronically active kinase that is constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine 1062. In turn, Y1062 phosphorylation transmits not only mitogenic but also proapoptotic signals to thyroid cells.",

Using trypan blue analysis, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated digoxigenin-dUTP nick-end labeling assay, we also detected the apoptosis of Hep3B cells resulting from the transfection of pCS2-Gli1 expression vector combined with 5-FU treatment. The motility of the cells was detected by scratch wound closure assay. The expression and subcellular location of PTC1 protein in Hep3B cells treated by 5-FU were also investigated by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescent microscopy. The results indicated that the expression of SHh pathway target molecules at both messenger RNA and protein levels are evidently down-regulated in Hep3B cells treated with 5-FU. The overexpression of Gli1 restores cell viability and, to some extent, the migration abilities inhibited by 5-FU. Furthermore, 5-FU treatment affects the subcellular localization of PTC1 protein, a key member in SHh signaling pathway. Our data showed that the down-regulation of SHh signaling pathway activity was involved in 5-FU-induced apoptosis and the inhibition of motility in hedgehog-activated HCC cell lines.

Formation of nitrotyrosine, a biomarker for peroxynitrate formation from NO in vivo, was analyzed in primary human PTC.;The production of nitrite/nitrate and VEGF-D in K1 cells was increased by treatment with the NO donor, (Z)-1-[N-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (DETA NONOate). The NO synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester inhibited the increase in nitrate/nitrite and eliminated the increase in VEGF-D. High-grade nitrotyrosine staining was observed in 51.8% (29 of 56) of PTCs. Nitrotyrosine levels were significantly correlated with VEGF-D immunoreactivity and lymph node metastasis.;Our data showed a role for NO in stimulating VEGF-D expression in vitro.

RET/PTC expression has been demonstrated to inhibit transcription of thyroid-specific genes. To study the signal transduction pathways responsible for this, we generated PCCL3 thyroid cells with doxycycline-inducible expression of RET/PTC3, RET/PTC3(Y541F), or PTC2/PDZ. Acute expression of RET/PTC(Y541F) appropriately interacted with Shc, an intermediate in the activation of the Ras pathway, but failed to activate PLCgamma. By contrast, PTC2/PDZ failed to bind Shc, but interacted normally with PLCgamma. Acute expression of RET/PTC3 or RET/PTC3(Y541F), but not PTC2/PDZ, inhibited TSH-induced Tg and NIS expression, suggesting that activation of Shc-Ras, but not PLCgamma, is required for RET/PTC-induced dedifferentiation. Accordingly, acute expression of H-Ras(V12) or of a constitutively active MEK1 also blocked TSH-induced expression of Tg and NIS. Moreover, MEK inhibitors restored Tg and NIS levels. In conclusion, activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK pathway through Shc mediates RET/PTC-induced thyroid cell dedifferentiation. This suggests that inhibition of this pathway may promote redifferentiation in poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas with constitutive activation of either Ras or RET/PTC.",

In PTC, oncogene activation is known to occur at a high frequency. However, the potential roles of tumor suppressor genes in thyroid carcinogenesis remain unclear. LDOC1 was first identified as a gene encoding a leucine zipper protein whose expression was decreased in a series of pancreatic and gastric cancer cell lines. In this study, we aimed to determine the status of LDOC1 in PTC and identify its mechanistic role in PTC pathogenesis.;LDOC1 expression was evaluated in fresh samples and stored specimens of human PTC and contralateral normal tissues by performing quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and immunohistochemical staining. The correlation to nuclear p65 content in the stored specimens was analyzed. Moreover, the basal level of LDOC1 in two human PTC-derived cell lines (BCPAP and TPC-1) compared with normal thyroid tissue was determined. Human LDOC1 cDNA was inserted into a lentiviral vector and transduced into TPC-1 cells. TPC-1 cells overexpressing LDOC1/GFP (Lv-LDOC1) or negative control GFP (Lv-NC) were stimulated with TNFα or recombinant TGF-β1, and then cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and apoptosis were assessed. Western blotting was used to examine the expression of p65, IκBα, c-Myc, Bax, and Bcl-xL, and a luciferase reporter assay was used to measure NF-κB activity stimulated by TNFα. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t tests or ANOVA and Newman-Keuls multiple comparison tests. Pearson chi-square test was used to analyze possible associations.;LDOC1 expression was significantly downregulated in PTC specimens as compared with the expression in normal thyroid tissues, and this downregulation was associated with an increase in tumor size (P < 0.05). There is a correlation between LDOC1 and nuclear P65 expression in human PTC tissues (P < 0.01). Lentivirus-mediated restoration of LDOC1 expression in TPC-1 cells characterized by low level of LDOC1 expression suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis by inhibiting NF-κB activation, and LDOC1-overexpressing TPC-1 cells recovered responsiveness to TGF-β1 antiproliferative signaling.;LDOC1 might function as a tumor suppressor gene in PTC by inhibiting NF-κΒ signaling, and thus might represent a promising therapeutic target in patients with PTC.",

Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry and immunoblotting. Invasion and migration studies were performed using 8-μm Transwell plates.;FoxM1 was overexpressed in 28.4% of PTC and significantly associated with activated matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) (P = 0.0004), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) (P = 0.0024), and B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-XL) (P = 0.0014) expression. Treatment of PTC cell lines with thiostrepton, an inhibitor of FoxM1, resulted in inhibition of cell viability via induction of apoptosis. In addition, thiostrepton treatment of PTC cells or expression of FoxM1-specific small interfering RNA down-regulated expression of FoxM1 accompanied with decreased MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression. Furthermore, inhibition of FoxM1 attenuated migration and invasion of PTC cells. Interestingly, overexpression of FoxM1 rescued the effects of thiostrepton in PTC cell lines. Finally, treatment of PTC cell line xenografts with thiostrepton resulted in growth inhibition of tumors in nude mice via down-regulation of FoxM1 and MMP-9 and MMP-2.;Altogether, this is the first study showing that FoxM1 and its associated signaling pathway play a critical role in the pathogenesis of PTC and may be a potential target for therapeutic intervention for treatment of these cancers.",

The presence and/or absence of PTC-associated morphologic features and their mimics were evaluated. One aspirate showed papillary-like fragments with honeycomb architecture. One aspirate contained rare syncytial-type fragments which were accompanied by honeycomb sheets of follicular cells and moderate amount of colloid. Intranuclear grooves presented occasionally in virtually all 22 aspirates. The grooves were noted mainly within round nuclei and appeared thin and/or incomplete. Rare intranuclear pseudoinclusions were detected in one otherwise benign-appearing aspirates. Eight aspirates contained various numbers of histiocytes, as well as atypical polygonal, epithelioid, elongate, or spindle cells in which intranuclear grooves were occasionally seen. Conspicuous fragments of fibrocollagenous tissue with entrapped follicular cells were detected in one aspirate. The corresponding histological specimen revealed counterpart of the cytological findings described. Other features associated with PTC were inconspicuous. The findings demonstrated that the following factors may contribute to the false suspicion of PTC: (1) misinterpretation of papillary-like tissue fragments with honeycomb arrangement and fragments offibrocollagenous tissue with entrapped follicular cells; (2) overinterpretation of suboptimal intranuclear grooves and rare intranuclear pseudoinclusion in the absence of the other features of PTC; (3) misinterpretation of the polygonal, epithelioid, elongate, or spindle cells that actually represented atypical cyst lining cells.",

We thus determined these mutations and their biological and clinical implications in thyroid carcinomas in the present study. The TERT promoter was sequenced in 10 thyroid cancer cell lines and 144 tumors from 20 patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), 51 with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), 36 with follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC), and 37 with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). We identified C228T or C250T mutation in 6/8 of ATC cell lines, as well as in tumor tissue from 10/20, 13/51, 8/36 and 0/37 patients with ATC, PTC, FTC and MTC, respectively. In PTC patients, these mutations were exclusively present in the group with age >45 years (P<0.0001), and highly correlated shorter telomeres (P<0.0001) and distant metastasis (P=0.028). The previous radioactivity exposure did not induce the mutation. The presence of C228T or C250T was an independent predictor associated with shorter disease-related survival (DRS) in the entire cohort (P<0.0001), as well as among patients >45 years (P=0.021). ATC patients carrying the mutation survived shorter than those without mutations, although not statistically significant (P=0.129). The TERT promoter mutation was associated with overall survival (P=0.038) and DRS (P=0.058) of FTC patients. Taken together, age- and shorter telomere-dependent TERT promoter mutations occur frequently in follicular cell-derived thyroid carcinoma (ATC, PTC and FTC) but not in parafollicular cell-originated MTC, and may serve as a marker for aggressive disease and poor outcome.

We examined 92 human thyroid tissues, including nodular hyperplasia, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, follicular tumor, Hürthle cell tumor, and papillary carcinoma to observe the distribution of primary cilia. The distribution and length of primary cilia facing the follicular lumen were uniform across variable-sized follicles in the normal thyroid gland. However, most Hürthle cells found in benign and malignant thyroid diseases were devoid of primary cilia. Conventional variant of papillary carcinoma (PTC) displayed longer primary cilia than those of healthy tissue, whereas both the frequency and length of primary cilia were decreased in oncocytic variant of PTC. In addition, ciliogenesis was markedly defective in primary Hürthle cell tumors, including Hürthle cell adenomas and carcinomas, which showed higher level of autophagosome biogenesis. Remarkably, inhibition of autophagosome formation by Atg5 silencing or treatment with pharmacological inhibitors of autophagosome formation restored ciliogenesis in the Hürthle cell carcinoma cell line XTC.UC1 which exhibits a high basal autophagic flux. Moreover, the inhibition of autophagy promoted the accumulation of two factors critical for ciliogenesis, IFT88 and ARL13B.

We additionally reviewed the medical records of patients who initially underwent surgery for Graves' disease (GD) or follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) during the same period. The concurrent occurrence rate of PTC in MTC patients was compared with that in GD and FTC patients.;Ten of 53 (19%) MTC patients displayed the concomitant PTC. In all 10 cases, the MTC and PTC components were separated by normal thyroid tissue, with the maximal diameters of PTC being less than 1.0 cm in the majority of patients. The rates of concurrent PTC in patients with MTC, GD and FTC were 19%, 15% and 19%, respectively, which were not significantly different.;Our results suggest that the occurrence of concurrent MTC/PTC is generally a simple reflection of incidental papillary microcarcinoma.",

MMP-1, membrane-type-1 MMP (MT1-MMP), and tissue inhibitor of MMP-1 (TIMP-1) have all been implicated, but the site of production and importance are disputed. In vitro, normal thyroid cells secrete TIMP-1, while thyroid cancer cells secrete TIMP-1 and MMP-1. However, previous pathological studies identified MMP-1 and TIMP-1 only in the stroma surrounding thyroid carcinoma. These data suggest that thyroid carcinoma or tumor-associated inflammatory cells might secrete a factor(s) which stimulates MMP-1 or TIMP-1 expression by surrounding tissues. We hypothesized that MMP-1, MT1-MMP, and TIMP-1 would be directly expressed by thyroid carcinoma and might promote invasion or metastasis. We used immunohistochemistry to determine the expression of MMP-1, MT1-MMP, and TIMP-1 in 32 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), 10 follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) and 13 benign thyroid lesions from children and adolescents. The intensity of staining was graded from absent (grade 0) to intense (grade 3). Average MMP-1 expression (mean relative intensity units+/-SE) was significantly greater among PTC (1.97+/-0.15; p=0.004) and FTC (2.2+/-0.25; p=0.006) compared to benign lesions (1.30+/-0.15); but there was no relationship between MMP-1 expression and invasion, metastasis, or recurrence. Expression of MT1-MMP and TIMP-1 was similar for benign and malignant lesions; but recurrent PTC expressed lower levels of TIMP-1 when compared to non-recurrent PTC (p=0.049). Only the expression of TIMP-1 correlated with the presence of tumor-associated lymphocytes (r=0.35, p=0.032).

Eighty patients underwent surgery between 1998 and 2004. Intraoperative and postoperative pathologic studies were performed at the Institute of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Kyiv.;Pathologic analysis revealed 45 thyroid carcinomas, including 43 papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) (95.6%) and 2 follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTCs) (4.4%). TNM classification (5th edition) of the PTCs included 8 T1 tumors (18.6%), 16 T2 tumors (37.2%), and 19 T4 tumors (44.2%). Fifteen PTCs (34.9%) were N1a,N1b, and 3 PTCs (7.0%) were M1. Among the PTCs, 8 exhibited the classical papillary histologic pattern (18.6%), 14 exhibited a follicular histologic pattern (32.6%), 5 exhibited a solid histologic pattern (11.6%), and 16 exhibited a mixed histologic pattern (37.2%). Both FTCs had a microfollicular-solid structure. Eleven of 20 cohort members who underwent surgery before the first screening had PTCs. Regional metastases (63.6%) and distant metastases (18.2%) were more common in this group.;Multifocal growth, lymphatic and blood vessel invasion, extrathyroid spread, and regional and distant metastases were more frequent in less differentiated PTCs (>30% solid structure). Small carcinomas (</=10 mm) comprised 23.3% of PTCs, and most of those (8 of 10 small carcinomas; 80%) were of the papillary-follicular subtype and therefore were more differentiated. The solid subtype of PTC was associated with shorter latency, especially in individuals who were diagnosed before the first screening. The histology of post-Chornobyl cancers is changing with time.",

The present study is aimed to investigate the role of microRNA (miR)-449 in the progression of PTC. Our results revealed that miR-449 was underexpressed in the collected PTC specimens compared with non-cancerous PTC tissues. Overexpression of miR-449 induced a cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and inhibited PTC cell growth in vitro. Further studies revealed that RET proto-oncogene (RET) is a novel miR-449 target, due to miR-449 bound directly to its 3'-untranslated region and miR-449 mimic reduced the protein expression of RET. Similar to the effects of miR-449 overexpression, RET downregulation inhibited cell growth, whereas RET overexpression reversed the inhibitive effect of miR-449 mimic. Furthermore, miR-449 overexpression inhibited the nuclear translocation of β-catenin and reduced the expression of several downstream genes, including c-Myc, cyclin D1, T cell-specific transcription factor (TCF) and lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF-1), and inactivated the β-catenin pathway in TPC-1 cells. Moreover, overexpression of β-catenin prevented miR-449-reduced cell cycle arrest and cell viability. In xenograft animal experiments, miR-449 overexpression effectively suppressed the tumor growth of PTC. Taken together, our research indicated that miR-449 functions as an anti-oncogene by targeting RET, and that miR-449 overexpression inhibited the growth of PTC by inactivating the β-catenin pathway. Thus, miR-449 may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PTC.",

The effects of the mutation on the growth and differentiation of thyroid cells were demonstrated by ectopic expression of wild-type (WT) and mutant proteins in PCCL3 normal rat thyroid cells, followed by tests of cell proliferation, activation of cell growth pathways, and transcription of TTF-1 target genes. All statistical tests were two-sided.;A missense mutation (1016C>T) was identified in TITF-1/NKX2.1 that led to a mutant TTF-1 protein (A339V) in four of the 20 MNG/PTC patients (20%). These patients developed substantially more advanced tumors than MNG/PTC or PTC patients without the mutation (P = .022, Fisher exact test). Notably, this germline mutation was dominantly inherited in two families, with some members bearing the mutation affected with MNG, associated with either PTC or colon cancer.

        "Doc_abstract":"The diffuse sclerosing variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (DSV-PTC) is an uncommon tumor making up about 2% of all papillary thyroid carcinomas. Previous studies have not comprehensively evaluated these tumors in a large series of patients.;Twenty-two cases of DSV-PTC diagnosed between 1970 and 2000 were identified in the files of the AFIP. Histologic and immunohistochemical features were evaluated and patient follow-up was obtained.;The tumors affected 14 females and 8 males, aged 6 to 49 yr (mean, 18 yr), with males presenting at a mean older age than females (24 vs 14 yr). Symptoms included an enlarging mass in the thyroid, present for a mean of 9.5 mo. While a dominant tumor was identified in a single lobe, bilateral disease was common (n = 16). The dominant mass ranged in size from 1.7 to 5.8 cm in diameter (mean, 3.8 cm). Histologically, all cases demonstrated a papillary carcinoma (conventional, solid, or follicular pattern) diffusely involving the gland. Extrathyroidal extension, lymphocytic thyroiditis, squamous metaplasia, increased fibrosis/sclerosis, and psammoma bodies were present to a variable degree. Both the papillary carcinoma and squamous metaplasia cells were strongly immunoreactive with CK19, thyroglobulin, and TTF-1. An increased number of S-100 protein immunoreactive dendritic cells were recognized. p53 was increased (>15%) in the tumor cells in 12 patients, while Ki-67 was increased in the tumor cells in two patients. Perithyroidal and cervical lymph node metastasis occurred in 18 (82%) patients. All metastases demonstrated histologic features similar to the primary. Complete resection (thyroidectomy in 18 patients) with lymph node dissection, yielded a 95% 5-yr survival without evidence of disease. One patient died of disease after a malignant transformation of the squamous metaplasia into squamous cell carcinoma.;The recognition of DSV-PTC can be made with the following features: classic to solid foci of PTC, lymphocytic thyroiditis, squamous metaplasia, increased fibrosis, and innumerable psammoma bodies. DSV-PTC is more biologically aggressive than conventional PTC, but the patients' survival is not significantly different. This diagnosis should lead the clinician to aggressively manage these patients (thyroidectomy and lymph node dissection) in an effort to achieve an excellent long-term clinical outcome.",

These mutations have a significantly higher prevalence in aggressive thyroid tumors, including widely invasive oncocytic carcinomas, poorly differentiated carcinomas, and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas. Interestingly, in some studies, TERT mutations were found to be more common in tumors with a BRAF(V600E) mutation. However, mutational analysis of TERT promoter mutations in thyroid tumors has not been previously performed for patients in Korea, where the BRAF(V600E) mutation in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is particularly prevalent. This study analyzed TERT promoter mutations in various thyroid tumors and examined their relationship with clinicopathologic factors and the BRAF(V600E) mutation in PTC cases.;Using 242 preoperative fine-needle aspiration biopsy specimens (including 207 PTCs) with confirmed histopathological diagnosis of the biopsied thyroid nodules, the TERT promoter status (C228T and C250T) was analyzed, and the relationship with clinicopathologic factors and the BRAF(V600E) mutation in PTC cases was examined.;Of 242 patients, 14.5% (30/207), 26.7% (4/15), 50% (1/2), and 60% (2/5) of PTCs, follicular thyroid carcinomas, poorly differentiated carcinomas, and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas harbored a TERT(C228T) mutation, respectively. The TERT(C228T) mutation was associated with recurrence (p = 0.03). However, no association with other clinicopathologic factors in PTC was found. Coexistence of TERT(C228T) and BRAF(V600E) mutations was found in 13.0% of PTCs and was significantly associated with older age and advanced stage compared with the group negative for either mutation. The TERT(C228T) mutation status was an independent prognostic factor for recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio = 3.08 [confidence interval 1.042-9.079]; p = 0.042) in patients with PTC in multivariate analysis.;Identification of TERT promoter mutations in preoperative fine-needle aspiration biopsy specimens may help in better characterizing the prognosis and triaging thyroid cancer patients for appropriate treatment.",

Our aim was to identify the signaling pathways that are involved in tumor-stromal cell interactions in human papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Immunohistochemical analyses were performed with 127 archived formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded thyroid tissue samples that included 70 cases of PTC, 35 cases of nodular goiter (NG), and 22 cases of normal thyroid tissues. The results showed that the expression levels of Notch1, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β1), and p-Smad3 in PTC cells and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) in the stroma of PTC were all significantly higher than in NG and normal thyroid tissues. Further analysis showed that in PTC, higher expression levels of Notch1 and TGF-β1 were closely related with lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05), whereas for α-SMA and p-Smad3, the percent expression increased significantly with advanced tumor stages (P < 0.05). Correlation analysis revealed that TGF-β1 expression increased with increased Notch1 and p-Smad3 levels in PTC cells (P < 0.05). Moreover, a significant correlation was found between higher TGF-β1 expression in PTC cells and increased α-SMA levels in the fibroblasts surrounding the cancer cells (P < 0.05). We identified TGF-β1 as an important factor from PTC cells that act in a paracrine manner to influence the activation of stromal fibroblasts. These data suggest that the activation of Notch and TGF-β/Smad3 pathways in cancer cells influence tumor growth. Moreover, cancer cell-derived-TGF-β ligands also affect stromal cells in a paracrine fashion and enhance tumor growth. ",

E7 is an oncoprotein derived from the human papillomavirus 16 responsible for most cervical carcinoma in women. Both transgenic mice develop thyroid hyperplasia followed by solid differentiated carcinoma in older animals. To understand the different steps leading to carcinoma, we analyzed thyroid gene expression in both strains at different ages by microarray technology. Important biological processes were differentially regulated in the two tumor types. In E7 thyroids, cell cycle was the most up-regulated process, an observation consistent with the huge size of these tumors. In RP3 thyroids, contrary to E7 tumors, several human PTC characteristics were observed: overexpression of many immune-related genes, regulation of human PTC markers, up-regulation of EGF-like growth factors and significant regulation of angiogenesis and extracellular matrix remodeling-related genes. However, similarities were incomplete; they did not concern the overall gene expression and were not conserved in old animals. Therefore, RP3 tumors are partial and transient models of human PTC. They constitute a good model, especially in young animals, to study the respective role of the biological processes shared with human PTC and will allow testing drugs targeting these validated variables.",

RCS is based on hybridization of radioactively labeled cDNA probes made from the biopsies to replica membranes with 15 000 clones from a PTC cDNA library. Among the genes overexpressed in PTC, and especially in clinically aggressive tumors with histologic evidence of poorly differentiated or undifferentiated areas, a novel gene named NATH was found. NATH has two mRNA species, 4.6 and 5.8 kb, both harboring the same open reading frame encoding a putative protein of 866 amino acids. The NATH protein is homologous to yeast N-acetyltransferase (NAT)1 and to mouse NARG1 (mNAT1) and contains four tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, suggesting that NATH may be part of a multiprotein complex. Overlapping RT-PCR fragments from several PTC biopsies confirmed the NATH mRNA sequence. Northern blots, semiquantitative RT-PCR experiments, TaqMan real-time RT-PCR experiments, and in situ hybridization verified the overexpression of NATH mRNA localized to tumor cells in PTC biopsies. NATH was expressed at a low level in most human adult tissues, including the normal thyroid gland. Increased NATH expression was seen especially in a Burkitt lymphoma cell line and in adult human testis. Recombinant in vitro expression showed that NATH protein was located mainly in the cytoplasm, and was present as a single protein band of the expected 105 kDa molecular weight. Heterologous expression of NATH in the papillary carcinoma cell line (NPA) and 293 cells did not alter the cellular proliferation rate. The biological function of NATH remains to be elucidated, but the overexpression in classic PTC and especially in poorly differentiated or undifferentiated components may indicate a function in the progression of papillary thyroid carcinomas.",

Here, we show that RET/PTC stimulates the beta-catenin pathway. By stimulating PI3K/AKT and Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), RET/PTC promotes glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) phosphorylation, thereby reducing GSK3beta-mediated NH(2)-terminal beta-catenin (Ser33/Ser37/Thr41) phosphorylation. In addition, RET/PTC physically interacts with beta-catenin and increases its phosphotyrosine content. The increased free pool of S/T(nonphospho)/Y(phospho)beta-catenin is stabilized as a result of the reduced binding affinity for the Axin/GSK3beta complex and activates the transcription factor T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor. Moreover, through the ERK pathway, RET/PTC stimulates cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation and promotes the formation of a beta-catenin-CREB-CREB-binding protein/p300 transcriptional complex. Transcriptional complexes containing beta-catenin are recruited to the cyclin D1 promoter and a cyclin D1 gene promoter reporter is active in RET/PTC-expressing cells. Silencing of beta-catenin by small interfering RNA inhibits proliferation of RET/PTC-transformed PC Cl3 thyrocytes, whereas a constitutively active form of beta-catenin stimulates autonomous proliferation of thyroid cells. Thus, multiple signaling events downstream from RET/PTC converge on beta-catenin to stimulate cell proliferation.",

Second, germ-line point mutations are responsible for the development of medullary thyroid carcinomas and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2). There are several conflicting reports on the influences of RET expression and RET/PTC rearrangements on the clinical outcome of thyroid cancers. Therefore, the wild-type RET gene expression and RET/PTC-1, RET/PTC-2, RET/PTC-3 rearrangements were examined in thyroid carcinomas and other thyroid diseases.;Thirty-six papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs), 8 follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTCs), 4 anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATC), 7 follicular adenomas (FAs), 23 hyperplasias, 6 normal thyroid tissues, and 39 normal portions from each tumor were included in this study. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemical analyses were used to identify the RET gene and RET/PTC rearrangements.;From the RT-PCR analysis, 68.9% of the PTCs, a single case of FTC, and 22.2% of the hyperplasias expressed the RET gene. No RET gene expression was observed in ATCs, FAs, or normal thyroid tissues. One RET/PTC-1 and one RET/PTC-2 rearrangement were detected in the PTCs. No RET/PTC-3 rearrangement was detected in any specimen. The immunohistochemical results revealed that 66.7% of PTCs, 28.6% of FAs, and 18.2% of hyperplastic thyroid tissue specimens showed high levels of RET protein expression. Neither the normal thyroid tissues nor the FTCs and ATC, showed high levels of RET protein expression. The two methods are agreed in PTC and hyperplastic nodules, but not in FA and FTC.;PTCs among Koreans rarely showed RET/PTC rearrangements, but commonly showed increased RET gene expression.

It is identified most frequently in classical PTC and in tall cell variant. Moreover, BRAF mutation is described more often in older patients, whereas in young patients RET/PTC rearrangements dominate. In PTC cases with BRAF mutation V600E the prognosis is poorer, with more cancer invasiveness, metastasis and recurrence.

The pkc1-4 allele also conferred a temperature-sensitive (ts) growth defect. Extragenic suppressors were isolated that suppress both the ts and hyperrecombination phenotypes conferred by the pkc1-4 mutation. Eight of these suppressors for into two complementation groups, designated KCS1 and KCS2. KCS1 was cloned and found to encode a novel protein with homology to the basic leucine zipper family of transcription factors. KCS2 is allelic with PTC1, a previously identified type 2C serine/threonine protein phosphatase. Although mutation of either KCS1 or PTC1 causes little apparent phenotype, the kcs1 delta ptc1 delta double mutant fails to grow at 30 degrees. Furthermore, the ptc1 deletion mutation is synthetically lethal in combination with a mutation in MPK1, which encodes a MAPK homologue proposed to act in the PKC1 pathway.

In the present study, we aimed to detect differences in the outcomes between PTC and FTC in Mansoura University Hospital in Egypt.;A total of 558 patients with histologically proven thyroid carcinomas from January 2003 to December 2012 were retrospectively enrolled. The clinical and pathological data of patients were reviewed.;Large primary tumor size, lymph node involvement, extrathyroid extension, and distant metastasis were significant poor prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) in old PTC patients. Cox hazard analysis showed that the patient's age, extra thyroid extension, and distant metastasis were the only independent prognostic factors. In FTC patients, only the distant metastasis and degree of tumor invasion were significant poor prognostic factors in OS univariate analysis. However, these factors were nonsignificant in multivariate analysis. The 10-year OS rates were 97% and 89% for PTC and FTC, respectively (P=0.003). The 10-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 77.2% in PTC vs. 65% in FTC (P=0.179).;The significant prognostic factors vary between the two types of DTCs.

Activating mutations of the BRAF oncogene commonly occur in papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) but not in other types of benign and malignant thyroid lesions. Mutational analysis of FNAs could enhance selection of thyroid nodules for surgical removal.;Ninety-five excised PTCs along with 49 corresponding FNAs were evaluated for BRAF mutations by a newly developed assay that uses a novel primer extension method (MutectorR assay) and by direct sequencing. An additional 42 FNAs from thyroid nodules that were excised based on a suspicion of malignancy were also evaluated.;BRAF mutations were identified in 36 of the 95 (38%) excised PTCs. By histological subtype, BRAF mutations were more common in conventional PTCs than in the follicular variant (67% versus 12%; P < 0.0001; chi(2)). Analysis of the preoperative FNAs accurately reflected BRAF status of the resected PTC in 46 of the 49 paired samples (94% concordance). In FNA samples grouped according to the preoperative cytologic findings (malignant, n = 25; benign, n = 11; and indeterminate, n = 55), a BRAF mutation confirmed the diagnosis of PTC in 72% of carcinomas within the malignant group, and it established the diagnosis of PTC in 16% of carcinomas within the indeterminate group. BRAF mutations were not detected in FNAs from 32 benign thyroid lesions. Direct sequencing and the MutectorR assay yielded completely concordant results.;BRAF mutations are common in conventional PTCs, and they are specific for PTC.

The clinical manifestations, laboratory results and pathologic features were analyzed, with literature review.;The main clinical manifestations of PTC included neck mass (11/11), hypercalcemia (11/11) and hyperparathyroidism (11/11). Most patients also had osteoporosis (10/11). In contrast, PA often manifested as hypercalcemia (40/40) and hyperparathyroidism (40/40). Histologic examination of PTC showed that the tumor cells contained clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm and separated by dense bands of fibrosis. The tumor mass was surrounded by thick fibrous capsule. Foci of capsular invasion and vascular permeation were identified at the tumor periphery in all cases. Cellular atypia was not conspicuous but mitotic figures and coagulative necrosis were easily identified. On the other hand, PA were composed of tumor cells with clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm, forming glands, trabeculae or nests. Most of them (35/40) had intact fibrous capsule. Mitotic figures were rarely encountered and tumor necrosis was absent. Immunohistochemical study showed that the tumor cells in PTC were positive for CK19 (11/11), chromogranin A (9/11), synaptophysin (7/11) and parathyroid hormone (11/11). They were negative for thyroglobulin, TTF-1 and calcitonin. The Ki-67 index was less than 10% (range = 2% to 9%).

Although Indian hedgehog (IHH) is known to control hypertophic differentiation of chondrocytes during this process, the role of hedgehog signaling in the earlier stages of chondrogenesis is less clear. We have conditionally inactivated the hedgehog receptor Ptc1 in undifferentiated limb mesenchyme of the mouse limb using Prx1-Cre, thus inducing constitutively active ligand-independent hedgehog signaling. In addition to major patterning defects, we observed a marked disruption to the cartilage elements in the limbs of Prx1-Cre:Ptc1(c/c) embryos. Using an in vitro micromass culture system we show that this defect lies downstream of mesenchymal cell condensation and likely upstream of chondrocyte differentiation. Despite early increases in levels of chondrogenic genes, soon after mesenchymal condensation the stromal layer of Prx1-Cre:Ptc1(c/c)-derived micromass cultures is characterized by a loss of cell integrity, which is associated with increased cell death and a striking decrease in Alcian blue staining cartilage nodules. Furthermore, inhibition of the hedgehog pathway activation using cyclopamine was sufficient to essentially overcome this chondrogenic defect in both micromass and ex vivo explant assays of Prx1-Cre:Ptc1(c/c) limbs. These data demonstrate for the first time the inhibitory effect of cell autonomously activated hedgehog signaling on chondrogenesis, and stress the importance of PTC1 in maintaining strict control of signaling levels during this phase of skeletal development.",

Immunohistochemistry was performed on 23 cases of Hashimoto's thyroiditis with focal or diffuse Hürthle cell change and PTC-like nuclear alterations, 37 PTC and 18 normal thyroids. Focal expression of galectin3 (GAL3), CITED1, cytokeratin 19 (CK19), HBME1 and fibronectin-1 (FN1) was seen in 87%, 65%, 43%, 26% and 17% of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, respectively, only in thyrocytes showing PTC-like nuclear alterations.

Nearly half the PTCs contained CD4+ (9 of 21, 43%), CD8+ (8 of 21, 38%), or CD19+ (10 of 21, 48%) lymphocytes. Only one PTC (1 of 21, 5%) contained CD56+ lymphocytes, and none contained all four cell types. By dual staining, none of these lymphocytes were proliferating (Ki-67+). However, PTCs containing either CD8+ cells (n = 8) or a combination of CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ cells (n = 5) contained more numerous proliferating lymphocytes than did PTCs containing any other combination (14.2-fold increase, P = 0.03 and 13.1-fold increase, P = 0.003, respectively). During follow-up, none of the PTCs containing either CD8+ lymphocytes or the combination of CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ lymphocytes recurred. However, the cohort is too small and the follow-up inadequate to provide accurate information on the clinical impact of these immunological findings. We conclude that the immune response against PTC is important and also complex, involving more than one type of lymphocyte.",

They include several types, among which the papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and the anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) are the best known. The two hystotypes display significant biological and clinical differences: PTC is a well differentiated form of tumour with a high incidence and a good prognosis, while the ATC is less frequent but represents one of the most aggressive endocrine tumours with morphological features of an undifferentiated type. To date, as far as we know, no conclusive studies, useful to design arrays of molecular markers, have been published illustrating the phenotypic and proteomic differences between these two tumours. The aim of this work was to perform a comparative analysis of two thyroid cancer cell lines, derived respectively from papillary (BCPAP) and anaplastic (8505C) thyroid carcinomas. The comparative analysis included cell behaviour assays and proteomic analysis by 2D-PAGE and mass spectrometry. The results have highlighted a new proteomic signature for the anaplastic carcinoma-derived cells, consistent with their high proliferation rate, motility propensity and metabolic shift, in relation to the well-differentiated PTC cells.",

In some cases the histiocytic component of a cystic thyroid nodule can occur as large tissue fragments with marked nuclear atypia, including elongated nuclei with chromatin clearing, nuclear grooves, and membrane thickening. These nuclear changes mimic cytologic features of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), thus leading to diagnostic difficulty in interpretation of FNAB specimens of benign cystic thyroid nodules. We evaluated ethanol-fixed Papanicolaou-stained smears of 273 cases of FNAB thyroid specimens from goitrous nodules with cystic change. Twenty cases were selected due to the presence of large aggregates of histiocytic cells with the above-mentioned nuclear atypia. An immunostain for histiocytic cells using CD68 was performed on alcohol-fixed slides. Histiocytic cells in tissue fragments with nuclear atypia mimicking PTC nuclei showed strong cytoplasmic staining for CD68; thyroid follicular cells stained negative for CD68. We conclude that histiocytic cells in cystic goitrous nodules can show nuclear features, which appear similar to PTC nuclei. Immunostaining for CD68 may be of value in differentiating between benign cystic thyroid nodules with histiocytic aggregates that mimic cytologic features of papillary carcinoma, and PTC with cystic change.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of High Mobility Group A2 (HMGA2) mRNA expression to distinguish benign from malignant thyroid tumors in cytological and histological specimens. RNA samples from 170 thyroid formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues and 226 fine needle aspiration (FNA) specimens were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The FFPE tissues included 34 follicular adenomas, 10 Hürthle cell adenomas (HA), 6 hyperplastic nodules, 4 atypical adenomas, 44 classic papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC), 29 follicular variant of PTC, 23 follicular thyroid carcinomas, 17 Hürthle cell carcinomas (HC), and 3 anaplastic thyroid carcinomas. The FNA specimens included 55 follicular adenomas, 34 HA, 20 hyperplastic nodules, 8 Hashimoto thyroiditis, 32 PTC, 24 follicular variant of PTC, 30 follicular thyroid carcinomas, 21 HC, and 2 anaplastic thyroid carcinomas. HMGA2 mRNA levels were expressed as relative fold change after normalizing with a calibrator. HMGA2 expression in thyroid carcinomas (16.8-fold for FFPE and 18.2-fold for FNA) was significantly higher than in benign lesions (0.8-fold for FFPE and 0.8-fold for FNA). HMGA2 expression in HC was relatively low (1.8-fold for FFPE and 8.5-fold for FNA) compared with the other types of carcinomas. HMGA2 expression values of 4.5-fold and 5.9-fold were used as cutoff points for FFPE and FNA (excluding HA and HC), respectively, to separate benign and malignant thyroid tumors, with 97.5% clinical specificity and 79.8% sensitivity for FFPE, and 95.2% clinical specificity and 88.6% sensitivity for the FNA specimens. Conventional RT-PCR supported the qRT-PCR results. Detection of HMGA2 mRNA expression by qRT-PCR may be a useful tool to assist in the diagnosis of well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas. The 1-step qRT-PCR method is a sensitive, accurate, and reliable technique for gene expression analysis of thyroid tumors.",

The aim of this study was to determine the expression pattern and the extent of Hh-signaling molecules in squamous cell carcinoma of uterine cervix and its precursor lesions. A total of 106 uterine cervical cancers and related lesions (37 squamous cell carcinomas, 23 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) III, 10 CIN II, four CIN I, 32 normal cervical epithelia) were immunohistochemically analyzed with anti-Shh, Indian Hh (Ihh), Patched (PTCH), Smoothened (Smo), Gli-1, Gli-2, Gli-3 antibodies on paraffin blocks. The results showed that the expression of all the Hh-signaling molecules was greatly enhanced in uterine cervical tumors, including carcinoma and its precursor lesions. The staining pattern was mainly cytoplasmic except for Gli-1/2, whose expression was observed in both cytoplasm and nucleus. In case of Ihh, PTCH, Smo and Gli-1, their expression in normal epithelium was completely absent or rare. The expression of all the seven Hh-signaling molecules mentioned above was significantly increased in CIN II/III and carcinoma, compared with that in normal epithelium (P < 0.05). The expression of Shh was increased by double; the first increase occurred in normal epithelium-CIN transition, and the second, during the progression of CIN to carcinoma. These results strongly suggest that the Hh-signaling pathways were extensively activated in carcinoma and CIN of uterine cervix. In conclusion, the Hh-signaling pathways may be involved in carcinogenesis of squamous cell carcinoma of uterine cervix and can be considered as a potential therapeutic target.",

In contrast to the indolent nature of PTC, anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) shows an extremely poor prognosis and has not responded to any therapeutic modalities.

Additionally, the cancer stem cell (CSC) theory has been widely accepted in the pathogenesis of ATC.;To explore the expression of various CSC markers in thyroid carcinoma tissues and analyse their clinical significance.;133 patients with PTC and 25 patients with ATC were enrolled. Immunohistochemistry for aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1), CD133, CXCR4, ATP-binding cassette (ABC)G2, multidrug resistance associated protein-1 (MRP1), lung resistance protein-1 (LRP), P-glycoprotein 1 (P-Gp1), SOX2, SOX9 and Oct4 was performed using tissue microarray.;CSC marker expression was significantly high in ATC, particularly chemoresistance markers such as ABCG2, MRP1, LRP and CXCR4. In PTC, ABCG2 was highly positive in more advanced pathological stages and was associated with lymph node involvement, with borderline significance. In ATC, high expression of CXCR4 correlated with distant metastasis, and LRP showed a tendency to correlate with lymph node metastasis.

Mice heterozygous for Patched-1 (Ptc1+/-) that are either heterozygous or nullizygous for Kip1 developed medulloblastoma rapidly and with high penetrance. All tumors from Ptc1+/-;Kip1+/- or Ptc1+/-;Kip1-/- mice failed to express the wild-type Ptc1 allele, consistent with its role as a canonical \"two-hit\" tumor suppressor. In contrast, expression of the wild-type p27(Kip1) protein was invariably maintained in medulloblastomas arising in Ptc1+/-;Kip1+/- mice, indicating that Kip1 is haploinsufficient for tumor suppression. Although medulloblastomas occurring in Ptc1+/- mice were histopathologically heterogeneous and contained intermixed regions of both rapidly proliferating and nondividing more differentiated cells, tumors that also lacked Kip1 were uniformly less differentiated, more highly proliferative, and invasive. Molecular analysis showed that the latter medulloblastomas exhibited constitutive activation of the Sonic hedgehog signaling pathway without loss of functional p53. Apart from gains or losses of single chromosomes, with gain of chromosome 6 being the most frequent, no other chromosomal anomalies were identified by spectral karyotyping, and half of the medulloblastomas so examined retained a normal karyotype.

BRAF is activated by point mutation, and were it to occur at a high frequency in Chernobyl-related tumors, it would challenge the dominant role of double-strand breaks in radiation-induced PTC. In a previous study, we detected the BRAF V600E mutation in 46% (23 of 50) of sporadic adult PTC. Using the same methodology, we have analyzed 34 post-Chernobyl PTC and detected RET/PTC rearrangements in 14 (41%) and BRAF mutations (V600E) in four (12%). These two alterations did not coexist in any PTCs. The mean age at exposure of patients with PTC showing BRAF mutation was higher than that of patients with tumors without BRAF mutation irrespective of their RET status. We have also analyzed 17 sporadic cases of childhood PTC and found that only one (6%) harbored the BRAF V600E mutation. We conclude that the frequency of BRAF mutations is significantly lower (P = 0.0008) in post-Chernobyl PTC than in adult sporadic PTC, whereas no significant difference was found between post-Chernobyl and sporadic childhood PTCs.",

Following our demonstration that the PLA(2) group IV isoform alpha (PLA(2)IV alpha) controls TSH-independent growth of normal thyroid (PCCl(3)) cells, we have investigated the mitogenic role of PLA(2)IV alpha in rat thyroid cells transformed by the RET/PTC oncogenes (PC-PTC cells). We now report that PLA(2)IV alpha acts downstream of the RET/PTC oncogenes in a novel pathway controlling RET-dependent cell proliferation. In addition, we show that PLA(2)IV alpha is in its phosphorylated/active form not only in RET/PTC-transformed cells and in cells derived from human papillary carcinomas but also in lysates from tumor tissues, thus relating constitutive activation of PLA(2)IV alpha to RET/PTC-dependent tumorigenesis. Moreover, p38 stress-activated protein kinase is the downstream effector of RET/PTC that is responsible for PLA(2)IV alpha phosphorylation and activity. In summary, our data elucidate a novel mechanism in the control of thyroid tumor cell growth that is induced by the RET/PTC oncogenes and which is distinguishable from that of other oncogenes, such as BRAF. This mechanism is mediated by PLA(2)IV alpha and should be amenable to targeted pharmacologic intervention.",

ALOX5 protein and mRNA were upregulated in PTC compared to matched, normal thyroid tissue, and ALOX5 expression correlated with invasive tumor histopathology. Evidence suggests that PTC invasion is mediated through the induction of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that can degrade and remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM). A correlation between MMP-9 and ALOX5 protein expression was established by immunohistochemical analysis of PTC and normal thyroid tissues using a tissue array. Transfection of ALOX5 into a PTC cell line (BCPAP) increased MMP-9 secretion and cell invasion across an ECM barrier. The ALOX5 product, 5(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid also increased MMP-9 protein expression by BCPAP in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibitors of MMP-9 and ALOX5 reversed ALOX5-enhanced invasion.

Loss of Nbp2 results in cell death at high temperatures and in sensitivity to calcofluor white. Cell death at high temperature is thought not to be due to a weakened cell wall. Additionally, we have isolated several type-2C serine threonine protein phosphatases (PTCs) as multicopy suppressors and MAP kinase-kinase (MAPKK), related to the yeast PKC MAPK pathway, as deletion suppressors of the nbp2Delta mutant. Screening for deletion suppressors is a new genetic approach to identify and characterize additional proteins in the Nbp2-dependent pathway. Genetic analyses suggested that Ptc1, which interacts with Nbp2 by the two-hybrid system, acts downstream of Nbp2 and that cells lacking the function of Nbp2 prefer to lose Mkk1, but the PKC MAPK pathway itself is indispensable when Nbp2 is deleted at high temperature.",

FASN is overexpressed in variety of human cancers, but its role has not been elucidated in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC).;Our objective was to investigate the role of FASN and its relationship with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT activation in a large series of PTC in a tissue microarray format followed by studies using PTC cell lines and Nude mice.;Analysis of apoptosis and cell cycle were evaluated by flow cytometry and DNA fragmentation assays. FASN and phospho-AKT protein expression was determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting.;Our data show that expression of FASN is associated with activated AKT (phospho-AKT) in a subset of PTC. Treatment of PTC cell lines (NPA-187, ONCO-DG-1, and B-CPAP) with C-75, an inhibitor of FASN, suppresses growth and induces apoptosis in all cell lines. Treatment of PTC cells with C-75 or expression of FASN small interfering RNA causes down-regulation of FASN and inactivation of AKT activity. Furthermore, treatment of PTC cell lines with C-75 results in apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway involving the proapoptotic factor Bad, activation of Bax, activation of caspases, and down-regulation of antiapoptotic proteins. Finally, treatment of NPA-187 xenografts with C-75 results in growth inhibition of tumors in Nude mice via down-regulation of FASN expression and inactivation of AKT.;Our results suggest that FASN and activated AKT pathway may be a potential target for therapeutic intervention for the treatment of PTC.",

With the obtained DEGs, we performed gene functional interaction (FI) network analysis. Then we conducted Venn diagram analysis to identify the intersection and specific DEGs of the four types of thyroid carcinomas. The intersections DEGs were performed by functional enrichment and transcription factor (TF) prediction analyses. These specific DEGs were performed by pathway enrichment analysis. There were respectively 323, 318, 118 and 1005 DEGs identified in PTC, OTC, FTC and ATC. Twelve sub-network modules were extracted based on gene FI network analysis and eight thyroid carcinoma-associated DEGs were involved in the network, such as TIMP1. Based on the Venn diagram analysis, 27 common DEGs were identified, such as HMGB3 which was regulated by TF of NKX3-1. There were 149 PTC-specific DEGs (like CLDN1), 160 OTC-specific DEGs, 94 FTC-specific DEGs (like PPARG), and 789 ATC-specific DEGs (like CDK1). They were enriched in some pathways, such as Cell cycle, Citrate cycle, and Oxidative phosphorylation.

The present study has investigated the expression, subcellular localization, phosphorylation, and activity of p38-MAPKs in normal and tumoural human thyroid tissues and in thyroid cell lines. The expression and nucleo-cytosolic compartmentalization of the alpha-isoform of p38-MAPKs (p38alpha-MAPK) were studied by western blotting in the WRO and B-CPAP cell lines, which are derived from human follicular and papillary thyroid carcinomas, respectively, and in the non-transformed rat thyroid cell lines FRTL-5 and PCCL3. Immunohistochemistry was used to study the expression and subcellular localization of p38alpha-MAPK, and of the phosphorylated forms of p38-MAPKs (P-p38-MAPKs) in human toxic adenomas (TAs), follicular adenomas (FAs), papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs), and follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTCs). The activity of p38-MAPKs in PTCs and FTCs was revealed by immunohistochemical detection of their typical phosphorylated substrate, MAPK-activated protein kinase 2/3 (MK2/3). p38alpha-MAPK was expressed in all cell lines and this expression was restricted to the cytosolic compartment. p38 MAPK activity was involved in regulating DNA synthesis in B-CPAP cells. p38alpha-MAPK and P-p38-MAPKs were strongly expressed in PTC and FTC cells, although only in the cytoplasm, whereas they were only very weakly expressed in FA cells, and absent in adjacent normal tissues. They were also expressed at a high level in TAs, but they were found in both nucleus and cytoplasm. Finally, phospho-MK2/3 immunostaining followed very similar patterns to those of p38alpha-MAPK and P-p38-MAPKs in PTCs and FTCs. Taken together, these results show for the first time that the p38-MAPK signalling cascade is functional in two types of differentiated carcinoma of the thyroid. The observation that p38-MAPK hyper-expression occurs in FTC, but not in FA, may provide an additional diagnostic tool for malignancy in some thyroid nodules.",

We observed neoexpression of p75 NTR in PTC, particularly in conventional PTC and in other variants of PTC displaying a papillary growth pattern, rather than in FVPTC. No immunoexpression of p75 NTR was observed in normal thyroid nor in nonneoplastic thyroid lesions. The cellular localization of p75 NTR immunoexpression was also significantly associated with the growth pattern of PTC, being much more frequently detected in an apical localization in PTC with papillary architecture than in PTC with a follicular or solid growth pattern. This apical localization of p75 NTR was significantly associated with the presence of BRAF V600E. No significant differences were detected between normal thyroid, nonneoplastic lesions, and PTC (or any PTC variant) regarding expression/activation of TrkA, thus suggesting that by itself and in contrast to p75 NTR, TrkA is not altered during PTC development.",

In this study, we assessed the protein expression and loss using antibodies against CD56 in normal follicular thyroid epithelium, follicular thyroid lesions, and follicular thyroid neoplasms in an attempt to evaluate its diagnostic value. A total of 185 cases were studied with tissues from 75 carcinomas (72 papillary, 2 follicular, 1 Hürthle cell) and 35 adenomas (32 follicular and 3 Hürthle cell) evaluated by immunohistochemistry for the expression of this marker. Non-neoplastic thyroids included 65 cases: nodular hyperplasia (n=25), thyrotoxic hyperplasia (Grave's disease) (n=5), lymphocytic thyroiditis (n=19), and Hashimoto's thyroiditis (n=6). Ten cases of normal thyroids from radical laryngectomies for laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas were also studied. The marker pattern and intensity of staining were scored. Positive expression of the markers in 10% or more of follicular epithelium within the tumor or lesional cells was considered positive. An expression of <10% was considered to be negative. Diffuse CD56 expression was consistently present in normal, lesional, and neoplastic follicular epithelium, except for PTC, including the follicular variant. We concluded that CD56 is of value to distinguish PTC from other thyroid follicular pathology/histology with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 100%. We suggest that CD56 is extremely useful in the diagnosis of PTC, including the follicular variant, and to distinguish it from other follicular cell-derived thyroid tumors/lesions. Application of CD56 by a group of expert pathologists on a larger series of follicular thyroid neoplasms of uncertain malignant potentials may potentially provide an objective diagnostic tool.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The tall-cell variant (TCV) of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is considered a more aggressive variant of PTC, with a poor prognosis. This is largely due to the tendency for TCV to present at an older age and with extrathyroidal extension (ETE). When these two variables are controlled for, it is unclear whether tall-cell histology alone portends a poor prognosis. Because previous studies have been underpowered to adequately answer this question, we hypothesized that TCV may have poorer prognosis than PTC. Our objective was to utilize a large cancer registry to obtain sufficient power to differentiate between outcomes in cases of TCV and PTC.;Using the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, we identified 278 TCV patients and 2522 classical PTC patients with sufficient information for a detailed matched-pair analysis. Each TCV patient was matched with a PTC patient for age, sex, extent of ETE, regional and distant metastases, surgical and adjuvant therapy, and year of diagnosis. The TCV cohort was then compared against all PTC cases and matched PTC cases.;Compared with classical PTC, TCV patients presented at an older age (54.3 years vs. 46.3 years, p < 0.0001) had a higher rate of ETE (53.6% vs. 30.2%, p < 0.0001) and poorer 5-year disease-specific survival (81.9% vs. 97.8%, p < 0.0001). In the matched-pair analysis comparing TCV patients to the matched PTC cohort, 5-year disease-specific survival was poorer in the TCV cohort (81.9% vs. 91.3%, p = 0.049). The number of deaths in the TCV cohort was higher than in the matched PTC cohort (p = 0.043).;TCV exhibits poorer survival than classical PTC. When the major prognostic factors for thyroid cancer are controlled for, including age and ETE, tall-cell histology alone remains a significant prognostic factor for disease-specific death.",

GLI encodes a zinc finger protein that is activated by Sonic Hedgehog signaling. Mutations in this pathway induce GLI expression in basal cell carcinoma, and expression of GLI in mice is sufficient to induce these skin tumors. We used microarrays to identify transcripts regulated by GLI or c-MYC after retroviral transduction and short-term culture of epithelial RK3E cells. Although each of these oncogenes induces malignant transformation of RK3E, two distinct sets of genes were identified. Of approximately 17,500 transcripts represented on the microarrays, GLI up-regulated the expression of 158 and repressed the expression of 52. In contrast, transcripts regulated by c-MYC were mainly repressed (424 of 682 regulated transcripts). Transcripts induced by the GLI transgene are likewise expressed in association with endogenous GLI in Ptch-deficient murine fibroblasts or in human skin tumors, but are not up-regulated in RK3E cells transformed by c-MYC, KLF4, or HRAS1. Unlike these other oncogenes, GLI induced the expression of mesenchymal cell markers including Snail, a zinc finger protein implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition in development and during tumor progression. A novel GLI-estrogen receptor fusion protein rapidly induced Snail mRNA expression in a manner like Ptch, a known direct transcriptional target gene. Induction of Snail expression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition by GLI may account for certain histopathological features of basal cell carcinoma, such as the absence of a well-defined, intraepithelial precursor lesion. In addition, consistent expression of the newly identified GLI-induced transcripts within GLI-expressing tumors in vivo indicates that oncogene-specific transcriptional profiles may be useful diagnostic tools for analysis of human tumors.",

Clinical biological characteristic of the histological variants was investigated. Sixty cases of PTC were selected. As the important parts of micro ecosystems, ECM, MMPs, CAMs and cytokine were investigated in use of tissue chip and method of immunohistochemistry. In addition, a group of cases of thyroid carcinoma including PTC was analyzed, follicular thyroid carcinoma and medulla thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and their reports of PET-CT as the initiation.;The variants could be divided into three groups in terms of the rate of cervical lymph node metastasis. The high-metastases group included diffuse sclerosing variant, tall cell variant, column cell variant and diffuse follicular variant. The low-metastases group included macrofollicular variant and papillary microcarcinomas. Others are included in the moderate-metastases group. The rate of cervical lymph node metastasis of each group were 83.0% , 55.5% and 34.1% (P < 0. 05), respectively. The 10-year-survival were 75.3% , 95.8% and 100.0% , respectively.

The positive rate of LN, FN, MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-2, CD, Integrinbeta-1, ICAM-1, EGFR, TGFR-beta, VEGF-C and E-Cad in metastasis ranged from 51.6% (Integrinbeta-1) to 98.3% (CD), and that in primartumor ranged from 46.7% (FN) to 98.3% (ICAM-1). The expression of E-cad in primartumor was lower than that in normal tissues (P < 0.05). The sensitivity of PET-CT was 100% and the specificity was 85.7%.;The characteristic has significant difference among the variants. Individual treatment should be performed in terms of different variants. Furthermore, some molecules play an important role in the lymph node metastasis of PTC and may be considered as the focus of future study.

PTC patients were more likely to present with local invasion and to have local recurrence (9.65% vs 0% for both variables). There were no significant differences in patient age, gender, vascular invasion, lymph node or distant metastases, surgical treatment, radioactive iodine therapy, remission, or mortality.;FVPTC presented with larger original tumor size and higher tumor stage but a lower local invasion rate and recurrence rate than patients with PTC despite similar therapies. These data suggest that FVPTC and PTC carry similar prognoses in early stages and that FVPTC may have a reduced predilection for local invasion.

PTC and cervical lymphatic metastasis were diagnosed after ultrasound examinations.

She was followed for 22 months with no sign of recurrence detected.;In this report, an unusual case of PTC was presented. The patient had not only regional lymphatic metastasis, but also had a massive metastasis in the uterine corpus, which was initially misdiagnosed as ovarian carcinoma. This case is of interest because of its rarity and exceptionally good prognosis.

In the 31 Japanese childhood cases, BRAF(T1796A) was found in only one instance (3.2%), and no RAS mutations were detected.

Similarly, BRAF mutations were positive only in PTC, but with a higher prevalence (24/43 positives, 55.8%). All but one BRAF mutation resulted in the prototypic substitution of valine 600 with a glutamic acid. In one case, a somatic in-frame insertion of three bases at codon 599 resulted in the insertion of an additional valine. RET/PTC expression and BRAF mutations were mutually exclusive. Screening of the RAS gene allowed identification of oncogenic mutations in 1/3 (33.3%) FA and 3/4 (75%) FTC. None of the PTCs was positive for RAS.;These data indicate that BRAF mutations are the most frequent genetic event in PTC and that RAS mutations, besides being a genetic hallmark of follicular tumours, are rare or completely absent in PTC from our area.

RET/PTC (rearranged in transformation/papillary thyroid carcinomas) gene rearrangements are the most frequent genetic alterations identified in papillary thyroid carcinoma. Although the oncogenic potential of RET/PTC is related to intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, the substrates for this enzyme are yet to be identified. In this report, we show that phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), a pivotal serine/threonine kinase in growth factor-signaling pathways, is a target of RET/PTC. RET/PTC and PDK1 colocalize in the cytoplasm. RET/PTC phosphorylates a specific tyrosine (Y9) residue located in the N-terminal region of PDK1. Y9 phosphorylation of PDK1 by RET/PTC requires an intact catalytic kinase domain. The short (iso 9) and long forms (iso 51) of the RET/PTC kinases (RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3) induce Y9 phosphorylation of PDK1. Moreover, Y9 phosphorylation of PDK1 by RET/PTC does not require phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or Src activity. RET/PTC-induced phosphorylation of the Y9 residue results in increased PDK1 activity, decrease of cellular p53 levels, and repression of p53-dependent transactivation. In conclusion, RET/PTC-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PDK1 may be one of the mechanisms by which it acts as an oncogenic tyrosine kinase in thyroid carcinogenesis.",

The majority of RET/PTC identified consists of two types which results from the inversion of chromosome 10: RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3. The prevalence of RET/PTC in papillary thyroid carcinomas of thyroid varies widely from a few to about 80% with the highest frequency in tumors arising in children after ionizing radiation. In Polish population the frequency of RET rearrangements in papillary cancers is 27%, although, it was reported to be twice higher in young patients (50% in patients younger than 21 at operation). Correlation with clinical outcome as well as prognostic value of RET/PTC is controversial. Some authors suggest that it predicts metastases, others found rearranged RET in more favourable, slow growing tumors.

Specifically, by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) we evaluated TAZ mRNA levels in tissue specimens (n=61) of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and herein we show that the PTC samples express much higher TAZ mRNA levels with respect to the normal thyroid tissue (p<0.001). TAZ expression was also evaluated in normal (n=10) and pathological human thyroids (n=17) by immunohistochemical analysis and the increase of TAZ protein levels in PTC was confirmed. To further analyse the molecular mechanisms underlying TAZ overexpression in PTC, we used an inducible system consisting of FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells expressing a conditional RAS oncoprotein and we show that the activation of the RAS signalling pathway is involved in TAZ deregulation. These observations suggest that the activated effectors of the RAS/RAF/MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)/ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) signalling pathway are involved in the increased expression of TAZ, supporting the idea that this may also occur in thyroid papillary carcinoma. Moreover, we demonstrated that the overexpression of TAZ is able to confer growth advantage to thyroid cells in culture and to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In conclusion, these findings support a potential role for TAZ in the pathogenesis of papillary thyroid carcinomas.",

The follicular epithelium in CLT can be markedly atypical, with cytologic changes ranging from oncocytic morphology to clearing and overlapping. At the molecular level, the association between CLT and PTC is more controversial. In order to further characterize the molecular changes in CLT, this study examined the BRAF gene in 27 patient samples with CLT and without carcinoma and 28 samples with CLT and carcinoma (12 conventional papillary carcinomas, 13 follicular variants, and 3 tall cell variants). Microdissection, PCR, and sequencing of exon 15 of the BRAF gene were performed. BRAF mutations were uncommon in the cases studied with only two microscopic and two clinically sized PTCs had BRAF mutations (14%). There was no evidence of BRAF mutation in any of the areas with atypical follicular epithelium in CLT.

        "Doc_abstract":"Human papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) has a relatively benign prognosis despite a high frequency of lymphatic metastasis. This suggests that local anticancer factors, generated in lymph nodes, control PTC progression. The cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), may be one such factor. We have previously shown that a human PTC cell line (NP-PTC) has high affinity TNF-alpha receptors. We now report on the action of TNF-alpha in these cells. TNF-alpha decreased [3H]thymidine incorporation as well as cellular DNA content and cell number in a dose-dependent manner. The abundance of phosphodiesterase and manganous superoxide dismutase mRNA species was increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner in the NP-PTC cells after TNF-alpha treatment. TNF-alpha activated NF-kappa B, a nuclear factor thought to mediate multiple actions of TNF-alpha, in these cells with a maximum effect observed after 30 min of treatment. Thus, TNF-alpha has an antiproliferative action on NP-PTC cells, despite its ability to induce the accumulation of mRNA that encodes an enzyme (manganous superoxide dismutase), thought to be cytoprotective. The net antiproliferative effect must therefore be explained by a balance of protective and tumoricidal or static effects that ultimately result in control of tumor spread. These antiproliferative effects may be in part mediated by NF-kappa B and PDE.",

Twelve papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) without ETE and NMP were also analyzed. Cases with paraffin tissues were subjected to mass spectrometry genotyping encompassing the most significant oncogenes in TC: 111 mutations in RET, BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, KRAS, PIK3CA, and AKT1, and other related genes were surveyed.;Eighty-one (10%) of 829 patients in the database had ETE and no NMP. There was a much higher frequency of poorly differentiated and anaplastic carcinomas (12/29, 41%) in patients with gross ETE than in those with METE (3/52, 6%) (p < 0.01). There was a higher disease-specific survival (DSS) in patients with METE than in those with gross ETE (p < 0.0001).

(ii) High mitotic activity and/or tumor necrosis confers worse DSS even in patients stratified for gross ETE in trachea/esophagus.

MiR-34a is best known as a tumor suppressor through repression of growth factors and oncogenes. Growth arrest specific1 (GAS1) protein is a tumor suppressor that inhibits cancer cell proliferation and induces apoptosis through inhibition of RET receptor tyrosine kinase. Both miR-34a and GAS1 are frequently down-regulated in various tumors. However, it has been reported that while GAS1 is down-regulated in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), miR-34a is up-regulated in this specific type of cancer, although their potential roles in PTC tumorigenesis have not been examined to date. A computational search revealed that miR-34a putatively binds to the 3'-UTR of GAS1 gene. In the present study, we confirmed previous findings that miR-34a is up-regulated and GAS1 down-regulated in PTC tissues. Further studies indicated that GAS1 is directly targeted by miR-34a. Overexpression of miR-34a promoted PTC cell proliferation and colony formation and inhibited apoptosis, whereas knockdown of miR-34a showed the opposite effects. Silencing of GAS1 had similar growth-promoting effects as overexpression of miR-34a. Furthermore, miR-34a overexpression led to activation of PI3K/Akt/Bad signaling pathway in PTC cells, and depletion of Akt reversed the pro-growth, anti-apoptotic effects of miR-34a. Taken together, our results demonstrate that miR-34a regulates GAS1 expression to promote proliferation and suppress apoptosis in PTC cells via PI3K/Akt/Bad pathway.

An important signal in some of these programs in Drosophila and vertebrates is the secreted Hedgehog (Hh) protein, which primarily functions as an inducer of morphogenetic signals. The Hh signal plays a decisive role in such critical developmental processes as neurulation and somite and limb formation. The Hh signalling pathway exhibits a novel mechanism of signal reception and transduction. In the absence of the Hh signal, the membrane protein Patched (Ptc) represses the constitutive signalling activity of a second membrane protein, Smoothened (Smo), by virtue of its ability to form a Ptc-Smo complex. Hence, mutations within the ptc gene that result in the failure of Ptc to inhibit Smo lead to constitutive activity of the Hh signalling pathway and to cancer, such as basal cell carcinoma. For activation of Hh-target genes, the N-terminal signalling domain of Hh binds to the Ptc-Smo receptor complex to activate two parallel signalling pathways. Furthermore, Hh limits its own range of action by impeding its diffusion through (i) covalent linkage of its N-terminal signalling moiety to cholesterol, mediated by the cholesterol transferase activity of its C-terminal moiety, and (ii) induction of, and sequestration by, its antagonist, Ptc.",

Considering that alterations in this pathway have been described in sporadic and nevoid basal cell syndrome-associated KOT, we tested the hypothesis that OOC is also associated with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the PTCH gene. Seven samples of OOC and seven of KOT were included in the study. D9S287, D9S196, and D9S127 microsatellite markers located in the region of PTCH gene, at chromosome 9q, were investigated for LOH.

PTCH1 germline mutations cause Gorlin syndrome, a disorder characterized by developmental abnormalities and tumor susceptibility. The autosomal dominant inheritance, and the evidence for PTCH1 haploinsufficiency, suggests that fine-tuning systems of protein patched homolog 1 (PTC1) levels exist to properly regulate the pathway. Given the role of 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) in protein expression, our aim was to thoroughly explore cis-regulatory elements in the 5'UTR of PTCH1 transcript 1b. The (CGG)n polymorphism was the main potential regulatory element studied so far but with inconsistent results and no clear association between repeat number and disease risk. Using luciferase reporter constructs in human cell lines here we show that the number of CGG repeats has no strong impact on gene expression, both at mRNA and protein levels. We observed variability in the length of 5'UTR and changes in abundance of the associated transcripts after pathway activation. We show that upstream AUG codons (uAUGs) present only in longer 5'UTRs could negatively regulate the amount of PTC1 isoform L (PTC1-L). The existence of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) observed using different approaches and mapped in the region comprising the CGG repeats, would counteract the effect of the uAUGs and enable synthesis of PTC1-L under stressful conditions, such as during hypoxia. Higher relative translation efficiency of PTCH1b mRNA in HEK 293T cultured hypoxia was observed by polysomal profiling and Western blot analyses. All our results point to an exceptionally complex and so far unexplored role of 5'UTR PTCH1b cis-element features in the regulation of the Hedgehog-Gli signaling pathway. ",

From March 1999 to April 2002, a total of 14 hypofunctioning nodules in 9 patients with GD underwent FNA; 3 patients had received RAI treatment. Three cases were diagnosed as suspicious for PTC and 11 as benign. Three patients with the diagnosis of suspicious for PTC on FNA underwent surgery and were found to have papillary carcinoma. We assessed all cases to find key cytologic features that can differentiate between nodules with reactive/reparative nuclear atypia from PTC arising in GD. The cytologic features assessed included cellularity, amount of colloid, monotony of the cell population, oncocytic features, cell crowding, lymphocytic infiltration, nuclear elongation, nuclear grooves, pale powdery chromatin, presence of small eccentric nucleoli, and random nuclear atypia. Each feature was semiquantitatively graded on a sliding scale of 0 to 4, with 0 representing absence and 4 representing a predominance of the feature. The mean value of each feature was calculated and the benign and malignant lesions were compared using the unpaired t-test. Four features were found to be statistically significant in the diagnosis of PTC as compared to the benign nodules in GD. The nuclei of PTC in GD show prominent nuclear elongation, pale powdery chromatin, intranuclear grooves, and small eccentric nucleoli. All other features studied were not found to be statistically significant. There does exist an overlap between the cytologic features of benign nodules and PTC arising in GD. However, adherence to strict diagnostic criteria (nuclear elongation, pale powdery chromatin, intranuclear grooves, and small eccentric nucleoli) can enable the diagnosis of PTC arising in GD.",

Although several PTC-specific miRNA profiles have been reported, only few upregulated miRNAs are broadly recognized, while less consistent data are available about downregulated miRNAs. In this study we investigated miRNA deregulation in PTC by miRNA microarray, analysis of a public dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), literature review and meta-analysis based on a univocal miRNA identifier derived from miRBase v21. A list of 18 miRNAs differentially expressed between PTC and normal thyroid was identified and validated in the TCGA dataset. Furthermore, we compared our signature with miRNA profiles derived from 15 studies selected from literature. Then, to select possibly functionally relevant miRNA, we integrated our miRNA signature with those from two in vitro cell models based on the PTC-driving oncogene RET/PTC1. Through this strategy, we identified commonly deregulated miRNAs, including miR-451a, which emerged also by our meta-analysis as the most frequently reported downregulated miRNA. We showed that lower expression of miR-451a correlates with aggressive clinical-pathological features of PTC as tall cell variant, advanced stage and extrathyroid extension. In addition, we demonstrated that ectopic expression of miR-451a impairs proliferation and migration of two PTC-derived cell lines, reduces the protein levels of its recognized targets MIF, c-MYC and AKT1 and attenuates AKT/mTOR pathway activation.Overall, our study provide both an updated overview of miRNA deregulation in PTC and the first functional evidence that miR-451a exerts tumor suppressor functions in this neoplasia.

In this study, we retrieved 2 thyroidectomy specimens of ATC with coexisting well differentiated thyroid carcinomas (DTCs) including one papillary carcinoma (PTC) and one follicular carcinoma (FTC).

Intense expressions of nestin, CD133 and CD44, and no expression of E-cadherin were observed in both ATCs. In contrast, the PTC and FTC, and non-neoplastic thyroid tissue in both cases were negative for nestin and positive for E-cadherin. The expressions of CD133 and CD44 were variable in the PTC, FTC, and non-neoplastic thyroid tissue and were at a lower level of expression of these markers in the overall pattern. The results confirmed EMT, demonstrated the stem cell phenotype in ATC, and revealed the difference in expression of these markers between ATC and DTCs/non-neoplastic thyroid tissue.

Activation of protein kinase B (PKB) and its downstream signaling pathways appears to be an important event in thyroid tumorigenesis. In this study, we found that the thyroid-specific oncogenic RET/PTC tyrosine kinase is able to phosphorylate PKB in vitro and in vivo. RET/PTC-transfected cells showed tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous and exogenous PKB, which was independent of phosphorylation of T308 and S473 regulated by the upstream kinases phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 and -2, respectively. The PKB Y315 residue, which is known to be phosphorylated by Src tyrosine kinase, was also a major site of phosphorylation by RET/PTC. RET/PTC-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation results in the activation of PKB kinase activity. The activation of PKB by RET/PTC blocked the activity of the forkhead transcription factor, FKHRL1, but a Y315F mutant of PKB failed to inhibit FKHRL1 activity. In summary, these observations suggest that RET/PTC is able to phosphorylate the Y315 residue of PKB, an event that results in maximal activation of PKB for RET/PTC-induced thyroid tumorigenesis.",

Here we describe a patient with disseminated lung metastases of the clear cell variant of PTC who presented in the euthyroid state despite discontinuance of levothyroxine after total thyroidectomy.;A 49-year-old woman underwent total thyroidectomy for the clear cell variant of PTC in March 2002. Levothyroxine replacement was initiated after total thyroidectomy, but the patient was lost to follow-up 5 years after the operation. She did not take any levothyroxine for 4 years. Upon presentation to our institution, her initial thyroid function tests were a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of 4.51 mIU/L (0.30-5.00), total triiodothyronine of 82 ng/dL (60-181), and free thyroxine of 1.21 ng/dL (0.89-1.76). The results of workups, including thyroid ultrasonography, chest computed tomography (CT) scan, and fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET)/CT, revealed that she had multiple metastases in the cervical lymph nodes and both lungs. She received 0.9 mg of recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) for 2 consecutive days followed by administration of 200 mCi 131I. A therapeutic whole body scan after 131I administration demonstrated intense uptake in the whole lung fields, suggesting functioning lung metastases.;It is extremely rare for metastatic PTC, even though it is a well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma, to produce a sufficient amount of thyroid hormones to result in euthyroid state after total thyroidectomy. To our knowledge, this is the first report of functioning lung metastases of the clear cell variant of PTC after total thyroidectomy that produced enough thyroid hormone to restore a euthyroid state.;Functioning metastases from recurred PTC, particularly of the clear cell variant, are very rare. When they occur, rhTSH is required to prepare these patients for treatment with ablative doses of radioactive iodine (131I).",

Papillary thyroid carcinomas showed a tendency to higher LOH frequency from patients older than 45 years of age compared to younger ones (9/23 v. 4/17) although it was not statistically significant.;We conclude that papillary thyroid cancers, particularly those diagnosed in patients older than 45 years of age, do exhibit LOH at least with the same frequency as follicular cancers.

        "Doc_abstract":"Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) arises from the thyroid follicular epithelium and represents the most frequent thyroid malignancy. PTC is associated with gene rearrangements generating RET/PTC and TRK oncogenes, and to the BRAFV600E activating point mutation. A role of tumor-suppressor genes in the pathogenesis of PTC has not been assessed yet. The tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP3) gene, encoding a metalloproteinases inhibitor and capable of inhibiting growth, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis of several cancers, was found to be silenced by promoter methylation in a consistent fraction of PTCs, in association with tumor aggressiveness and BRAFV600E mutation, thus suggesting an oncosuppressor role. To explore this possibility, in this study we performed gene expression and functional studies. Analysis of gene expression data produced in our laboratory as well as meta-analysis of publicly available data sets confirmed the downregulation of TIMP3 gene expression in PTC with respect to normal thyroid. The functional consequences of TIMP3 downregulation were investigated in the PTC-derived NIM1 cell line, in which the expression of TIMP3 is silenced. Restoration of TIMP3 expression by exposure to soluble TIMP3 protein or by complementary DNA transfection had no effect on the growth rate of NIM1 cells. Instead, it affected the adhesive, migratory and invasive capabilities of NIM1 cells by modulating several proteins involved in these processes. A striking effect was observed in vivo, as TIMP3 reduced the tumorigenicity of NIM1 cells by repressing angiogenesis and macrophage infiltration. Our data indicate that the loss of TIMP3 expression exerts a functional role in the pathogenesis of PTC.",

Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) mRNA expression were quantified by Real Time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).;In BCN rats, we observed the onset of an overt condition of hypogonadism, characterized by reduced T plasma level, reduced ventral prostate weight, reduced testis function (including testis weight and number of Leydig cells), with an inadequate compensatory increase of luteinizing hormone. BCN induced massive penile hypoxia, decreased muscle/fiber ratio, nNOS, eNOS, PDE5 expression, increased sensitivity to the nitric oxide donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), and reduced the relaxant response to acetylcholine (Ach), as well as unresponsiveness to acute Tad dosing. In BCN rats, chronic Tad-administration normalizes penile oxygenation, smooth muscle loss, PDE5 expression, SNP sensitivity, and the responsiveness to the acute Tad administration. Chronic Tad treatment was ineffective in counteracting the reduction of nNOS and eNOS expression, along with Ach responsiveness. T supplementation, in combination with Tad, reverted some of the aforementioned alterations, restoring smooth muscle content, eNOS expression, as well as the relaxant response of penile strips to Ach, but not nNOS expression.;BCN was associated with hypogonadism, probably of central origin.

Many genes modulations observed in PTC are amplified in ATC. This illustrates the fact that ATC mostly derived from PTC. A molecular signature of aggressiveness composed of 9 genes clearly separates the two tumors. Moreover, this study demonstrates gene regulations corresponding to the ATC or PTC phenotypes like inflammatory reaction, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion, high proliferation rate, dedifferentiation, calcification and fibrosis processes, high glucose metabolism and glycolysis, lactate generation and chemoresistance.

We compared the original FNA diagnoses with reclassified diagnoses based on 2007 National Cancer Institute (NCI)/Bethesda recommendations, and reviewed FNA cytologic features. Original FNA diagnoses included colloid nodule (7%, 3/44), atypical follicular cells (5%, 2/44), follicular lesion (11%, 5/44), follicular neoplasm (16%, 7/44), suspicious for malignancy/PTC (27%, 12/44), and papillary thyroid carcinoma (34%, 15/44). Reclassified diagnoses included indeterminate (5%, 2/44), colloid nodule (7%, 3/44), atypical cells of undetermined significance [ACUS] (7%, 3/44), Hurthle cell neoplasm (2%, 1/44), follicular neoplasm (7%, 3/44), suspicious for malignancy/PTC (25%, 11/44), and PTC (48%, 21/44).

We frequently observed cytologic features of PTC, such as nuclear grooves and fine chromatin; conversely, intranuclear inclusions, though present in 77% cases, were scant. Our review findings suggest that lack of characteristic cytologic features of PTC,coexistence with other thyroid lesions, and small tumor size arethe major obstacles to FNA diagnosis of FVPTC.

To investigate the frequency of MHC Class II antigen expression in PTC and to identify the effects of MHC Class II antigen expression on clinical outcomes in PTC patients, the expression of HLA-DR/-DQ antigen was analyzed in surgical specimens from 77 PTCs and 44 benign nodules (23 nodular hyperplasias, 21 follicular adenomas).

Multivariate analyses clearly showed that HLA-DR(+) or HLA-DQ(+) PTC has a low risk of recurrence (HLA-DR OR = 0.22, CI, 0.06-0.9; p = 0.03, HLA-DQ OR = 0.25, CI, 0.07-0.9, p = 0.03).

The tumor represents the most common type of endocrine malignancy; however, its tumorigenesis is not fully elucidated.

Expression profiles of SNX family members of PTC showed a significant quantity of transcripts of SNX5. Further immunohistochemical analysis with an SNX5-specific monoclonal antibody established in this study consistently demonstrated the preferential expression of SNX5 in PTC (94.2%, 113/120 cases) as indicated by studies on 440 cases of various tumors. In contrast, other major carcinomas originating from the lung (2.6%, 1/38 cases), breast (5.1%, 2/39 cases), and intestine (4.2%, 1/24 cases) scarcely expressed SNX5. When we investigated models of murine thyroid tumors induced by the administration of carcinogens, high expression of Snx5 was also observed in well-differentiated thyroid tumors, further implying that the tumorigenesis of the thyroid gland was tightly associated with the abundance of SNX5/Snx5. Moreover epithelial cells expressing excess SNX5 showed high levels of Caspase-2 of an initiator caspase.

Immunohistochemical results were confirmed by Western blot analysis. For PTC, positive immunostaining was observed in 107 of 111 (96.4%) cases and was diffusely present in either cytoplasm and nucleus, or only cytoplasm or only nucleus of cancer cells at varying intensities. Staining tended to be stronger in the periphery of cancer cell nests. Positive reaction was also found in 44 of 117 (37.6%) cases of FA. However, the extent and intensity of c-Met immunostaining in FA were far less than those in PTC (p < 0.0001). Forty-four PTC cases (39.6%) exhibited LNM, and the extent and intensity of c-Met expression were significantly correlated with both LNM (p < 0.0001) and pathological stage (p < 0.0001). No significant correlation of c-Met expression with age, sex or tumor size was found. Our findings suggest that PTC expresses c-Met protein much more strongly and intensively than does FA, and that strong and intense overexpression of c-Met protein may be an indicator of the presence of lymph node metastasis and advanced pathological stage of papillary thyroid carcinoma.",

Little is known about tubulolobular carcinoma. The purpose of this study was to compare the frequency of prognostic factors in pure tubular carcinoma (PTC) and tubulolobular carcinoma (TLC). We studied 90 cases of pure PTC and 17 cases of TLC. The following results were found for PTC: size 0.5 to 1.8 cm (mean, 1.2 cm); multifocality in 18 of 90 cases (20%); axillary lymph-node dissection performed in 51 patients; positive axillary lymph nodes in six of 51 cases (12%); recurrences in one of 90 cases (1%), local. The following results were found for TLC: size 0.6 to 2 cm (mean, 1.3 cm); multifocality in five of 17 cases (29%); axillary lymph-node dissection performed in 14 patients; positive axillary lymph nodes in six of 14 cases (43%); recurrences in two of 17 cases (12%); one local and one systemic, each after mastectomy. The relationship between multifocality and positive axillary lymph nodes was as follows: In PTC, the percentage of positive axillary lymph nodes in multifocal cases was 33%, and in nonmultifocal cases, 7%; in TLC, the percentage of positive axillary lymph nodes in multifocal cases was 60% and in nonmultifocal cases, 33%. In conclusion, multifocality and positive axillary lymph nodes were more frequent in TLC than in PTC. Multifocality appeared to predispose to positive lymph nodes in both PTC and TLC. The distribution of prognostic factors suggest that TLC is a higher-grade lesion than PTC. Long-term follow-up is needed to correlate multifocality with recurrence after breast conserving therapy.",

Our aim was to study the biologic behavior and the impact on survival of PTC subtypes in childhood. From 1968 to 2002, 42 sporadic pediatric PTCs were subclassified into PTC, not otherwise specified and PTC variants. In all cases, sex, age at diagnosis, age of menarche, side, size, TNM/pTNM classification, neoplastic microfoci, vascular invasion, status of the non-neoplastic parenchyma, and treatment (surgery and nonsurgical therapies) were registered. Follow-up was carried on up to May 2005. PTC, solid/trabecular variant was the most frequent subtype. Both extrathyroid local invasion (P < 0.04) and distant metastases (P < 0.01) at onset were significantly associated with PTC, not otherwise specified. After a median follow-up of 16 years, for the whole series overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 100% and 77%, respectively. The solid/trabecular variant was at a significantly increased risk of relapse (PFS 50%, P < 0.01). The occurrence of poorly differentiated tall cell morphology did not influence survival. Sensitivity to hormonal manipulation was maintained over time. In conclusion, although overall survival was not influenced by PTC subtypes, the solid/trabecular variant of PTC was at a significantly higher risk of relapse. At variance with adults, presence of the tall cell morphology did not carry a worst prognostic significance.",

Recently, let-7 microRNA was found to reduce RAS levels in lung cancer, acting as a tumor suppressor gene. Here, we report that RET/PTC3 oncogenic activation in PCCL3 rat thyroid cells markedly reduces let-7f expression. Moreover, stable transfection of let-7 microRNA in TPC-1 cells, which harbor RET/PTC1 rearrangement, inhibits MAPK activation. As a result, let-7f was capable of reducing TPC-1 cell growth, and this might be explained, at least in part, by decreased messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of cell cycle stimulators such as MYC and CCND1 (cyclin D1) and increased P21 cell cycle inhibitor mRNA. In addition, let-7 enhanced transcriptional expression of molecular markers of thyroid differentiation such as TITF1 and TG. Thus, reduced expression of let-7f might be an essential molecular event in RET/PTC malignant transformation. Moreover, let-7f effects on thyroid growth and differentiation might attenuate neoplastic process of RET/PTC papillary thyroid oncogenesis through impairment of MAPK signaling pathway activation. This is the first functional demonstration of an association of let-7 with thyroid cancer cell growth and differentiation.",

We observed that CXCR4 expression correlated with the transforming ability of the oncoprotein and depended on the integrity of the RET/PTC-RAS/ERK signaling pathway. We found that CXCR4 was expressed in RET/PTC-positive human thyroid cancer cell lines, but not in normal thyroid cells. Furthermore, we found CXCR4 expression in human thyroid carcinomas, but not in normal thyroid samples by immunohistochemistry. Since CXCR4 has been recently implicated in tumor proliferation, motility and invasiveness, we asked whether treatment with SDF-1alpha was able to induce a biological response in thyroid cells. We observed that SDF-1alpha induced S-phase entry and survival of thyroid cells. Invasion through a reconstituted extracellular matrix was also supported by SDF-1alpha and inhibited by a blocking antibody to CXCR4. Taken together, these results suggest that human thyroid cancers bearing RET/PTC rearrangements may use the CXCR4/SDF-1alpha receptor-ligand pathway to proliferate, survive and migrate.",

A hierarchical clustering analysis was performed to examine the groups for potential differences. The combined PTC and FVPTC groups had a distinct gene expression profile compared with the benign lesions. The sensitivity for a diagnosis of carcinoma was 93%, with a 100% specificity (one FVPTC clustered with the benign nodules). Cancer gene profiles contained both known (Met and galectin-3) and previously unidentified genes. Gene profiling is a reliable means of distinguishing PTC, FVPTC, and benign tumors of the thyroid.

Molecular, hormonal and histopathalogical basis of this association has been hypothesized, however a definite causal association has not been proved till date. This review aims to study the basis of this association and clinical features and management of HT concurrent with PTC. There are no distinctive clinical or radiological features that categorically differentiates HT concurrent with PTC from PTC or which can pick up a nodule harboring PTC in setting of HT. Smaller nodule size and radiological features like hypoechogenecity; hyper vascularity and calcification in a clinical setting of hypothyroidism have a higher odds ratio for malignancy and merit further investigations. PTC associated with HT has been seen to be less aggressive with earlier presentation with lesser chances of extra thyroidal extension and lymph nodal metastasis. The management and follow up of PTC in HT is no different from that of PTC alone. The prognosis of PTC concurrent with HT is better compared to age and stage matched PTC in terms of lower recurrence and disease free and overall survival. ",

Ninety-seven papillary carcinomas were studied; in all cases, frozen tissue was available for nucleic acid extraction. Of 96 unselected cases, 42% were positive for BRAF, 18% for RET/PTC, and 15% for RAS mutations. Morphologic features were evaluated in detail in 61 cases and 6 characteristic nuclear features and 3 additional microscopic features were assessed quantitatively. At least 4 nuclear features were found in each tumor, with nuclear pseudoinclusions being the least frequent finding in all mutation groups. BRAF mutations were associated with older patient age, typical papillary appearance or the tall cell variant, a higher rate of extrathyroidal extension, and more advanced tumor stage at presentation. RET/PTC rearrangements presented at younger age and had predominantly typical papillary histology, frequent psammoma bodies, and a high rate of lymph node metastases. Tumors with RAS mutations were exclusively the follicular variant of papillary carcinoma and correlated with significantly less prominent nuclear features and low rate of lymph node metastases.

In surgical tissue specimens from 32 patients with thyroid cancers, we found high immunoreactivity for ANXA1 in papillary (PTC) and follicular (FTC) thyroid cancers while in undifferentiated thyroid cancers (UTC) the expression of the protein was barely detectable. Control thyroid tissue resulted positive for ANXA1. In summary, 70% of UTC examined weakly expressed ANXA1, whereas 65% of PTC or FTC specimens tested showed high expression of the protein. Thus ANXA1 expression may correlate with the tumorigenesis suggesting that the protein may represent an effective differentiation marker in thyroid cancer.",

Using certain search arguments and previously defined criteria, 37 studies reporting experiments with the BRAF mutation in pre-operative FNA of the thyroid were selected from the electronic databases PUBMED, MEDLINE, SCOPUS and LILACS, in order to gather evidence with regard to the possible contribution of BRAF in the management of thyroid carcinoma. There were no cases positive for BRAF in follicular carcinomas (FTCs), Hürthle cell carcinomas (HCCs) or medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTCs). Among the 11 cases of anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATC), three showed positive results for the BRAF mutation. The number of cases positive for BRAF among the benign lesions was not significant. The average prevalence of BRAF-positive cases in papillary carcinomas (PTC) was 58.6%, while in follicular variants of papillary carcinoma (FVPTC), the average prevalence was 29.6%. For lesions diagnosed as indeterminate or suspicious, the average prevalence of BRAF positivity in PTC was 48.5%.

MicroRNA (miRNA) deregulation was extensively studied in PTCs and FTCs. However, very limited information is available for FVPTC. The aim of this study was to assess miRNA expression in FVPTC with the most comprehensive miRNA array panel and to correlate it with the clinicopathological data.;Forty-four papillary thyroid carcinomas (17 FVPTC, 27 classic PTC) and eight normal thyroid tissue samples were analyzed for expression of 748 miRNAs using Human Microarray Assays on the ABI 7900 platform (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). In addition, an independent set of 61 tumor and normal samples was studied for expression of novel miRNA markers detected in this study.;Overall, the miRNA expression profile demonstrated similar trends between FVPTC and classic PTC. Fourteen miRNAs were deregulated in FVPTC with a fold change of more than five (up/down), including miRNAs known to be upregulated in PTC (miR-146b-3p, -146-5p, -221, -222 and miR-222-5p) and novel miRNAs (miR-375, -551b, 181-2-3p, 99b-3p). However, the levels of miRNA expression were different between these tumor types and some miRNAs were uniquely dysregulated in FVPTC allowing separation of these tumors on the unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis. Upregulation of novel miR-375 was confirmed in a large independent set of follicular cell derived neoplasms and benign nodules and demonstrated specific upregulation for PTC. Two miRNAs (miR-181a-2-3p, miR-99b-3p) were associated with an adverse outcome in FVPTC patients by a Kaplan-Meier (p < 0.05) and multivariate Cox regression analysis (p < 0.05).;Despite high similarity in miRNA expression between FVPTC and classic PTC, several miRNAs were uniquely expressed in each tumor type, supporting their histopathologic differences. Highly upregulated miRNA identified in this study (miR-375) can serve as a novel marker of papillary thyroid carcinoma, and miR-181a-2-3p and miR-99b-3p can predict relapse-free survival in patients with FVPTC thus potentially providing important diagnostic and predictive value.",

Between October 2003 and December 2013, 1.420 consecutive patients diagnosed by histology as having differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) and treated with radioactive iodide (RAI) were retrospectively investigated. Of these, 4 patients were diagnosed by histology as having simultaneous MTC and PTC. The clinical and pathology characteristics of these patients are described. The prevalence of simultaneous MTC and PTC of these 4 patients in our clinic was 0.28% of all patients with DTC. The age of the 4 patients ranged from 44 to 63 years and were three females and one male. These patients are currently alive without disease from either of the two types of cancer. In two of these patients, MTC was located in the left and PTC in the right thyroid lobe. One patient had MTC in the right lobe and PTC in both lobes. The remaining patient had both cancers in the left lobe as a mixed tumor. We are able to present the pathology of only 2 of these 4 patients. In these 2 patients MTC was located in the left and PTC in the right thyroid lobe, one of them was female and the other was male, aged 44 and 49, respectively.

HH-dependent signaling increases levels of GLI transcriptional activators and decreases processing of GLI3 to a shorter transcriptional repressor. Previously, we showed that Shh-deficiency interrupts early inductive events during renal development in a manner dependent on GLI3 repressor. Here we identify a novel function for GLI3 repressor in controlling nephron number. During renal morphogenesis, HH signaling activity, assayed by expression of Ptc1-lacZ, is localized to ureteric cells of the medulla, but is undetectable in the cortex. Targeted inactivation of Smo, the HH effector, in the ureteric cell lineage causes no detectable abnormality in renal morphogenesis. The functional significance of absent HH signaling activity in cortical ureteric cells was determined by targeted deletion of Ptc1, the SMO inhibitor, in the ureteric cell lineage. Ptc1(-/-UB) mice demonstrate ectopic Ptc1-lacZ expression in ureteric branch tips and renal hypoplasia characterized by reduced kidney size and a paucity of mature and intermediate nephrogenic structures. Ureteric tip cells are remarkable for abnormal morphology and impaired expression of Ret and Wnt11, markers of tip cell differentiation. A finding of renal hypoplasia in Gli3(-/-) mice suggests a pathogenic role for reduced GLI3 repressor in the Ptc1(-/-UB) mice. Indeed, constitutive expression of GLI3 repressor via the Gli3(Delta699) allele in Ptc1(-/-UB) mice restores the normal pattern of HH signaling, and expression of Ret and Wnt11 and rescued the renal phenotype. Thus, GLI3 repressor controls nephron number by regulating ureteric tip cell expression of Wnt11 and Ret.",

Among the genetic aberrations described in PTC, the BRAF V600E mutation and ret/PTC activation occur most commonly. Several studies have investigated the genetic alteration status of multifocal thyroid tumours, with discordant results. To address the question of clonality this study examined disparate geographical and morphological areas from a single PTC (classic PTC, insular and anaplastic foci, and tumour cells adjacent to vascular invasion and lymphocytic infiltrate) for the presence of ret/PTC 1 or BRAF mutations. Moreover, we wanted to investigate the consistency of miRNA signatures within disparate areas of a tumour, and geographical data was further correlated with expression profiles of 330 different miRNAs. Putative miRNA gene targets were predicted for differentially regulated miRNAs and immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue sections in an effort to investigate phenotypic variations in microvascular density (MVD), and cytokeratin and p53 protein expression levels.;All of the morphological areas proved negative for ret/PTC 1 rearrangement. Two distinct foci with classic morphology harboured the BRAF mutation. All other regions, including the insular and anaplastic areas were negative for the mutation. MiRNA profiles were found to distinguish tumours containing the BRAF mutation from the other tumour types, and to differentiate between the more aggressive insular & anaplastic tumours, and the classic variant. Our data corroborated miRNAs previously discovered in this carcinoma, and additional miRNAs linked to various processes involved in tumour growth and proliferation.;The initial genetic alteration analysis indicated that pluriform PTC did not necessarily evolve from classic PTC progenitor foci. Analysis of miRNA profiles however provided an interesting variation on the clonality question. While hierarchical clustering analysis of miRNA expression supported the hypothesis that discrete areas did not evolve from clonal expansion of tumour cells, it did not exclude the possibility of independent mutational events suggesting both phenomena might occur simultaneously within a tumour to enhance cancer progression in geographical micro-environments within a tumour.",

A monoclonal antibody was raised against a unique keratan sulfate (KS) determinant and used to differentially screen benign and malignant thyroid tissue for the expression of components carrying these moieties. In a total of 349 cases of benign and malignant thyroid lesions, 100% of the 115 PTC cases examined (including various histological subtypes) were found to contain KS-bearing molecules, whereas these were virtually absent from benign tissues and other thyroid tumors, with the exception of 21% of the follicular carcinoma cases analyzed. A composite immunoaffinity chromatography, immunochemistry, and mass spectrometric approach revealed that the PTC-specific KS-bearing macromolecules were unique glycoforms of thyroglobulin and transferrin. Combined, reciprocal immunoprecipitation and Western blotting further indicated that the former glycoform predominated and that most of the transferrin produced by PTC was glycanated with KS moieties. Fluorescent keratanase II-based fingerprinting of the KS moieties bound to these isoforms further demonstrated several PTC-specific peculiarities: 1) that a considerable portion of the moieties was covalently attached via a novel core protein linkage structure; 2) they had an unusual extended average length; 3) an unusual relative ratio of highly sulfated disaccharides terminating with alpha (2-3)-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid capping residues; and 4) a novel unidentified oligosaccharide moiety at the nonreducing terminus. Comparative analysis of the relative distribution of transferrin in benign versus PTC tissues highlighted a marked malignancy-associated abundance of the molecule, with a >75% frequency in expression in PTC. These findings demonstrate that PTC cells synthesize unique post-translationally modified thyroglobulin and transferrin variants in situ that may be directly exploitable for diagnosis, through histological and noninvasive cytological procedures; for devising novel strategies for antibody-guided imaging of this tumor in vivo; and for postsurgery follow-up of PTC patients.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Thyroid carcinoma is the most frequent endocrine cancer accounting for 5-10% of thyroid nodules. Papillary histotype (PTC) is the most prevalent form accounting for 80% of all thyroid carcinoma. Although much is known about its epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical, and biological behavior, the only documented risk factor for PTC is the ionizing radiation exposure. Rearrangements of the Rearranged during Transfection (RET) proto-oncogene are found in PTC and have been shown to play a pathogenic role. The first RET rearrangement, named RET/PTC, was discovered in 1987. This rearrangement constitutively activates the transcription of the RET tyrosine-kinase domain in follicular cell, thus triggering the signaling along the MAPK pathway and an uncontrolled proliferation. Up to now, 13 different types of RET/PTC rearrangements have been reported but the two most common are RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3. Ionizing radiations are responsible for the generation of RET/PTC rearrangements, as supported by in vitro studies and by the evidence that RET/PTC, and particularly RET/PTC3, are highly prevalent in radiation induced PTC. However, many thyroid tumors without any history of radiation exposure harbor similar RET rearrangements. The overall prevalence of RET/PTC rearrangements varies from 20 to 70% of PTCs and they are more frequent in childhood than in adulthood thyroid cancer. Controversial data have been reported on the relationship between RET/PTC rearrangements and the PTC prognosis. RET/PTC3 is usually associated with a more aggressive phenotype and in particular with a greater tumor size, the solid variant, and a more advanced stage at diagnosis which are all poor prognostic factors. In contrast, RET/PTC1 rearrangement does not correlate with any clinical-pathological characteristics of PTC. Moreover, the RET protein and mRNA expression level did not show any correlation with the outcome of patients with PTC and no correlation between RET/PTC rearrangements and the expression level of the thyroid differentiation genes was observed. Recently, a diagnostic role of RET/PTC rearrangements has been proposed. It can be searched for in the mRNA extracted from cytological sample especially in case with indeterminate cytology. However, both the fact that it can be present in a not negligible percentage of benign cases and the technical challenge in extracting mRNA from cytological material makes this procedure not applicable at routine level, at least for the moment.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Cytokeratin19 (CK19) has been reported as a useful marker of thyroid tumors. We evaluated its value for differential diagnosis of thyroid neoplastic lesions and assessed its usefulness for predicting aggressive behavior of papillary thyroid carcinomas by correlating immunohistochemical results with clinicopathological features of the patients. A total of 351 thyroid tissue samples included 27 follicular adenomas (FTA), 18 follicular carcinomas (FTC), 147 papillary carcinomas (71 of follicular type-PTCfv and 76 of classical type-PTCcl) and 33 cases of anaplastic carcinoma with 126 adjacent thyroid tissues. Diagnostic usefulness of CK19 was determined by ROC analysis, while its value as a predictive marker of PTC was tested by univariate and multivariate analysis. According to ROC analysis, CK19 can discriminate both types of PTC from other neoplasias of the thyroid gland (p < 0.05). Although greatest accuracy was gained for the identification of PTCcl (91.07 %), this marker was also helpful for distinguishing PTCfv from FTA and FTC (accuracy 71.43 and 65.17 %, respectively). Regarding the univariate set of tests, high expression of CK19 correlated significantly with age, multifocality, extrathyroidal extension, pT status and pTNM stage of PTC (p < 0.05 for all). Multivariate analyses confirmed the significant association of high CK19 expression with extrathyroidal extension of PTC as well as with pTNM stage (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). CK19 is a useful marker for the identification of both types of PTC. High expression of this protein predicts the aggressive behavior of PTC and can help in the identification of a particular subgroup of PTC patients with a potentially worse prognosis.",

We have previously shown that downregulation of PTCH1 is distinctive for this type of colorectal cancer. In several other tumor types, somatic inactivating PTCH1 mutations have been shown to lead to aberrant Hedgehog signaling, but in colorectal cancer the role of PTCH1 mutations has not been thoroughly studied. Here, we have analyzed the mutation status of PTCH1 in a series of 33 colorectal serrated adenocarcinomas by sequencing all 23 coding exons. We detected 11 previously known SNPs and eight new alterations. The latter included five synonymous changes and two previously unknown missense variations, somatic M319V, and germline V1231A. V1231A was also present in population controls and likely represents polymorphism. The somatic M319V variant does not appear to be an attractive candidate for a disease-associated mutation because in silico analyses did not support the pathogenic nature of the change. A somatic, intronic 1-bp deletion was detected in a short poly(T) stretch in two microsatellite unstable tumors. None of the three changes had predicted effect on splicing when analyzed in silico. Our results did not reveal any clearly deleterious inactivating PTCH1 mutations in our collection of colorectal serrated adenocarcinomas. This suggests that other mechanisms are involved in the observed downregulation of the PTCH1 gene. These might include, e.g., constantly active MAPK signaling by KRAS or BRAF mutations or silencing of PTCH1 by hypermethylation, and further studies are needed to reveal these mechanisms.",

Laser-capture microdissection allowed us to isolate homogeneous cell populations from human PTC surgical samples. Tumor, peritumor, or normal host tissue of the same sample were separately dissected and analyzed by RT-PCR and Western blot. Estrogen receptor-α mRNA was more expressed in cancer-microdissected cells from human PTC, as compared with microdissected cells obtained from surrounding normal host tissue (450 vs 12, P = 0.001). A similar pattern was observed with Western blot for the ER-a protein. By contrast, ER-β mRNA expression was not detected among the microdissected tissue fractions. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy-derived specimens showed a similar expression pattern to ER. Moreover, human PTC cell line BCPAP and cancer stem cells from PTC, analyzed under hypoxic conditions, showed a hypoxia-driven increase in ER-α expression.

The Tg-E7 model was less heterogeneous, with a dominant goitrous pattern. The solid tumour already described in the RET/PTC3 models associated with cribriform patterns, suggested 'PTC spindle cell changes' as in humans PTC rather than the equivalent of the solid human PTC.

The serpentine protein Smoothened (Smo) is essential for cells to respond to the Hedeghog (Hh) signal; oncogenic forms of Smo have been isolated from human basal cell carcinomas. Despite similarities with ligand binding G-protein coupled receptors, the molecular basis of Smo activity and its regulation remains unclear. In non-responding cells, Smo is suppressed by the activity of another multipass membrane spanning protein Ptc, which acts as the Hh receptor. In Drosophila, binding of Hh to Ptc has been shown to cause an accumulation of phosphorylated Smo protein and a concomitant stabilisation of the activated form of the Ci transcription factor. Here, we identify domains essential for Smo activity and investigate the sub-cellular distribution of the wild type protein in vivo. We find that deletion of the amino terminus and the juxtamembrane region of the carboxy terminus of the protein result in the loss of normal Smo activity. Using Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) and horseradish peroxidase fusion proteins we show that Smo accumulates in the plasma membrane of cells in which Ptc activity is abrogated by Hh but is targeted to the degradative pathway in cells where Ptc is active. We further demonstrate that Smo accumulation is likely to be a cause, rather than a consequence, of Hh signal transduction.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Exposition of the skin with solar ultraviolet radiation (UV) is the main cause of skin cancer development. The consistently increasing incidences of melanocytic and nonmelanocytic skin tumors are believed to be at least in part associated with recreational sun exposure. Epidemiological data indicate that excessive or cumulative sunlight exposition takes place years and decades before the resulting malignancies arise. The most important defense mechanisms that protect human skin against UV radiation involve melanin synthesis and active repair mechanisms. DNA is the major target of direct or indirect UV-induced cellular damage. Low pigmentation capacity in white Caucasians and rare congenital defects in DNA repair are mainly responsible for protection failures. The important function of nucleotide excision DNA repair (NER) to protect against skin cancer becomes obvious by the rare genetic disease xeroderma pigmentosum, in which diverse NER genes are mutated. In animal models, it has been demonstrated that UVB is more effective to induce skin cancer than UVA. UV-induced DNA photoproducts are able to cause specific mutations (UV-signature) in susceptible genes for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). In SCC development, UV-signature mutations in the p513 tumor suppressor gene are the most common event, as precancerous lesions reveal approximately 80% and SCCs > 90% UV-specific p53 mutations. Mutations in Hedgehog pathway related genes, especially PTCH1, are well known to represent the most significant pathogenic event in BCC. However, specific UV-induced mutations can be found only in approximately 50% of sporadic BCCs. Thus, cumulative UVB radiation can not be considered to be the single etiologic risk factor for BCC development. During the last decades, experimental animal models, including genetically engineered mice, the Xiphophorus hybrid fish, the south american oppossum and human skin xenografts, have further elucidated the important role of the DNA repair system in the multi-step process of UV-induced melanomagenesis. An increasing body of evidence now indicates that nucleotide excision repair is not the only DNA repair pathway that is involved in UV-induced tumorigenesis of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer. An interesting new perspective in DNA damage and repair research lies in the participation of mammalian mismatch repair (MMR) in UV damage correction. As MMR enzyme hMSH2 displays a p53 target gene, is induced by UVB radiation and is involved in NER pathways, studies have now been initiated to elucidate the physiological and pathophysiological role of MMR in malignant melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer development.",

In about 25% of papillary thyroid carcinomas, this gene was shown to rearrange with RET to give rise to the transforming sequence PTC. The analysis of different cell hybrids containing subfragments of chromosome 10, in conjunction with pulse field gel electrophoresis, established that H4 is mapped distally to RET at a distance not less than 280 kb.

In the first patient, histology, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy demonstrated an MTC in the one nodule and PTC in two additional lesions. Non-neoplastic thyroid parenchyma separated the three nodules. Metastasis from PTC was diagnosed in a regional lymph node. Genetic analysis of both tumour components showed a distinctive mutational pattern: in the MTC a Cys634Arg substitution in exon 11 of the RET gene and in the two PTC foci a Val600Glu substitution in exon 15 of the BRAF gene. The other two patients are members of a large multigenerational family affected with familial MTC due to a germline mutation of the RET gene (Ala891Ser). Both patients harboured, besides medullary cancer and C-cell hyperplasia, distinct foci of papillary thyroid cancer, which was positive for Val600Glu BRAF mutation. Review of the literature disclosed 18 similar lesions reported and allowed the identification of different patterns of clinical presentation and biological behaviour. So far, the pathogenesis of these peculiar cases of thyroid malignancy has been completely unknown, but an underlying common genetic drive has been hypothesised.

It is specifically overexpressed in thyroid tumour cells and is currently used as a preoperative diagnostic marker of thyroid malignancy. Gal-3 expression is downregulated by wt-p53 at the transcriptional level. In well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas (WDTCs) there is an unexplained paradoxical concomitant expression of Gal-3 and wt-p53. HIPK2 is a co-regulator of different transcription factors, and modulates basic cellular processes mainly through the activation of wt-p53. Since we demonstrated that HIPK2 is involved in p53-mediated Gal-3 downregulation, we asked whether HIPK2 deficiency might be responsible for such paradoxical Gal-3 overexpression in WDTC.;We analyzed HIPK2 protein and mRNA levels, as well as loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the HIPK2 locus (7q32-34), in thyroid tissue samples. HIPK2 protein levels were high in all follicular hyperplasias (FHs) analyzed. Conversely, HIPK2 was undetectable in 91.7% of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) and in 60.0% of follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTCs). HIPK2 mRNA levels were upregulated in FH compared to normal thyroid tissue (NTT), while PTC showed mean HIPK2 mRNA levels lower than FH and, in 61.5% of cases, also lower than NTT. We found LOH at HIPK-2 gene locus in 37.5% of PTCs, 14.3% of FTCs and 18.2% of follicular adenomas. To causally link these data with Gal-3 upregulation, we performed in vitro experiments, using the PTC-derived K1 cells, in which HIPK2 expression was manipulated by RNA interference (RNAi) or plasmid-mediated overexpression. HIPK2 RNAi was associated with Gal-3 upregulation, while HIPK2 overexpression with Gal-3 downregulation.;Our results indicate that HIPK2 expression and function are impaired in WDTCs, in particular in PTCs, and that this event explains Gal-3 overexpression typically observed in these types of tumours. Therefore, HIPK2 can be considered as a new tumour suppressor gene for thyroid cancers.",

KLF17 expression in PTC and adjacent liver tissues was studied by polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, and the association between KLF17 expression and the clinicopathological features of PTC was studied in 50 patients. By using RNA interference against KLF17, the correlation between KLF17 expression and malignant potential was examined by downregulating KLF17 expression in TPC‑1 cells, and the effects of KLF17 downregulation on cell proliferation and motility were analyzed. Furthermore, the association between KLF17 expression and the surgical outcomes of PTC patients were analyzed. Downregulated expression of KLF17 was associated with a shorter overall survival time in clinical patients (P<0.05). Low KLF17 expression was significantly associated with tumor stage, tumor size, nodal stage and metastasis stage in PTC (P<0.05). The reduced expression of KLF17 promoted the motility and proliferation ability of TPC‑1 cells by altering the expression of tight junction protein 1 and Snai1, and activating the AKT pathway by upregulating inhibitor of DNA binding 1.

The objective of this study was to compare the FNA specimens of TCV with those of usual variant of PTC (UV-PTC) and to define a set of distinguishing cytologic features. Thirty FNA specimens of histologically proven TCV were compared with 32 FNA specimens of histologically proven UV-PTC.

These features were semiquantitatively measured on a sliding scale of 0-4 in both air-dried Diff-Quik-stained and ethanol-fixed Papanicolaou-stained preparations. TCV showed distinctive cytologic features, which can distinguish them from UV-PTC. These included EL/TC, OC, and DCB and were also found to be statistically significant (P < 0.0001). No significant differences were noted for PG and NG. The NIs in TCV cases were qualitatively different than those in UV-PTC. In TCV there were multiple inclusions within the same nucleus imparting a \"soap bubble appearance\" to the nucleus. This feature was seen in almost all cases of TCV and was rarely seen in usual PTC.

We determined whether the presence of the BRAF(V600E) mutation or allelic loss of Rap1GAP related to changes in Rap1GAP protein expression. To determine the consequences of Rap1GAP loss, we targeted Rap1GAP in culture using small interfering RNA.;A highly specific Rap1GAP antibody was applied to sections of 55 human thyroid tissues. Genomic DNA was analyzed for the presence of the BRAF(V600E) mutation, and loss of Rap1GAP. Rap1GAP expression in rat thyroid cells was abolished using small interfering RNA.;We observed that down-regulation of Rap1GAP in benign lesions and PTCs was common. Rap1GAP expression was more severely decreased in PTCs. Loss of Rap1GAP expression was observed in multiple histological variants of PTCs. Approximately 20% of PTCs and adenomas exhibited allelic loss of Rap1GAP. Loss of Rap1GAP was not associated with the presence of the BRAF(V600E) mutation. In vitro, loss of Rap1GAP was sufficient to increase Rap1 activity in thyroid cells.;These data indicate that loss of Rap1GAP is a frequent event in PTC.

Inhibition of mTOR activity led to downregulation of cyclin D1, a gene regulated by messenger RNA translation via phosphorylation of 4E-BP1. Torin2 treatment also inhibited cell viability and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis via activation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in PTC cells. Finally, Torin2 treatment induces anticancer effect on PTC xenograft tumor growth in nude mice via inhibition of mTORC1 and mTORC2 and its associated pathways. Our results suggest that coexpression of mTORC1 and mTORC2 is seen frequently in the clinical PTC samples and dual targeting of mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity may be an attractive therapeutic target for treatment of PTC.",

Studies have proved that lncRNAs play important regulatory roles in gene expression and contribute to oncogenesis and cancer metastasis. However, the expression level of lncRNAs and their clinicopathologic significance in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) have not been well studied. In this study, we investigated the expression level of a novel lncRNA NONHSAT037832 in PTC and paired noncancerous thyroid tissues as well as some cell lines by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The association between the expression level of NONHSAT037832 and clinicopathologic characteristics of patients with PTC was further analyzed. Three receiver operating characteristic curves (ROCs) were established to evaluate the diagnostic value of NONHSAT037832. The results suggested that the expression level of NONHSAT037832 was significantly decreased in PTC compared with paired noncancerous tissues (P < 0.01). And, NONHSAT037832 was also significantly downregulated in two PTC cell lines (K1 and IHH-4) compared to normal thyroid follicular epithelial cell line Nthy-ori 3-1 (P < 0.01). Downregulated NONHSAT037832 was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.015) and tumor size (P = 0.032). The ROCs revealed that NONHSAT037832 had a high diagnostic value for differentiating between PTC and noncancerous diseases as well as identifying PTC with lymph node metastasis and larger tumors (≥3 cm). The area under curve was up to 0.897 (95%CI = 0.852-0.942, P = 0.000), 0.641 (95%CI = 0.519-0.762, P = 0.033), and 0.702 (95%CI = 0.567-0.827, P = 0.008), respectively.

Recently, we have characterized the novel tumor suppressor gene RASSF1 located in this locus. The RASSF1A isoform is epigenetically inactivated in a variety of human primary tumors. In this study, we investigated the expression and methylation status of the RASSF1 gene in thyroid carcinoma. In nine thyroid cancer cell lines, the RASSF1A promoter CpG island was methylated completely, and expression was absent. Treatment of these cell lines with the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine reactivated the transcription of RASSF1A. The methylation status of the RASSF1A promoter was analyzed in 38 primary thyroid tumors, including 1 poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma, 5 medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), 10 follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC), 9 undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma (UTC), and 13 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). In 71% of thyroid carcinomas, the RASSF1A CpG island was hypermethylated. Methylation frequency was higher in the aggressive forms of thyroid carcinoma and was found in 80% of MTC, in 78% of UTC, and in 70% of FTC, compared with 62% in the more benign PTC. RASSF1A inactivation was detected in all stages of thyroid carcinoma scored by Tumor-Node-Metastasis classification. Additionally, we analyzed the methylation frequency of the CpG island of cell cycle inhibitor p16(INK4a) in the same thyroid tumors. The p16 gene was inactivated in 56 and 25% of cell lines and primary tumors, respectively. p16 methylation was detected in 56% of UTC, 10% of FTC, and 25% of PTC but not in MTC. In UTC, which belongs to the most aggressive carcinomas in humans, the most common combined inactivation of RASSF1A and p16 was detected. In general, 90% of tumors with p16 inactivation were also silenced for RASSF1A expression. However, RASSF1A hypermethylation was detected three times more frequently in thyroid cancers. Thus, RASSF1A inactivation may play a crucial role in the malignancy of thyroid carcinoma.",

In papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), coexpression of transcripts encoding for both proEGFcyt and proEGFdel23 correlated with poor differentiation of PTC. To determine potential roles of the cytoplasmic proEGF domain in human thyroid cells, we generated stable transfectants of the human follicular thyroid carcinoma cell line FTC-133 overexpressing the normal cytoplasmic domain proEGFcyt, a truncated proEGFcyt composed of the peptide sequence encoded by exons 22 and 23 (proEGF22.23) and proEGFdel23. The proEGFcyt and proEGF22.23 transfectants displayed significantly reduced proliferation rates, an enlarged cellular phenotype, and alterations in the distribution and post-translational modification of the microtubular system. These transfectants also displayed increased production of microtubule-associated proteins 1b and 2c, which was absent in FTC-133-proEGFdel23 or FTC-133-empty plasmid transfectants. This is the first evidence of an involvement of proEGF cytoplasmic domain in microtubular stability in the human thyroid carcinoma cell line FTC-133 and may suggest a specific role for the cytoplasmic domain of membrane-anchored proEGF, particularly exon 23, in thyroid carcinoma. The up-regulation of proEGFdel23 in poorly differentiated PTC and the exclusive detection of both proEGF isoforms in undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma may indicate an involvement of this novel truncated proEGFdel23 cytoplasmic domain during dedifferentiation processes of human thyroid cells.",

Pathway analysis was used to evaluate the signaling pathway that differentially expressed genes were involved in. In addition, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) and Western blot were used to verify the top differentially expression genes.;Comparative analysis revealed that the expression level of 1149 genes was changed in response to CXCR7 transfection. After unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis, 270 differentially expressed genes were filtered, of them 156 genes were up-regulated whereas 114 genes were down-regulated in K1-CXCR7 cells. GO enrichment analysis revealed the differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in biopolymer metabolic process, signal transduction and protein metabolism. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in ECM-receptor interaction, Focal adhesion, MAPK signaling pathway and Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway. More importantly, the expression level of genes closely associated with tumor growth and metastasis was altered significantly in K1-CXCR7 cells, including up-regulated genes FN1, COL1A1, COL4A1, PDGFRB, LTB, CXCL12, MMP-11, MT1-MMP and down-regulated genes ITGA7, and Notch-1.;Gene expression profiling analysis of papillary thyroid carcinoma can further delineate the mechanistic insights on how CXCR7 regulating papillary thyroid carcinoma growth and metastasis.

During normal development, GNPs divide in response to Sonic hedgehog (SHH), a ligand that binds to the patched (PTCH) receptor on GNPs. If one copy of the Ptch gene is lost, as in human Gorlin's syndrome and in Ptch(+/-) mice, MBs may form. Proper transduction of the SHH signal critically depends on primary cilia. Loss of primary cilia results in improper signal reception and failure to properly activate SHH target genes. KIF3a, part of a kinesin motor, is required for formation of primary cilia. Here, we use tamoxifen-induced ablation of Kif3a in GNPs of postnatal Ptch(+/-) mouse cerebella to show that KIF3a is necessary for MB formation. To investigate the importance of primary cilia in established tumors, we deleted Kif3a from cultured cells and from tumor cell grafts. The loss of Kif3a from established tumors led to their growth arrest and regression. MBs behave as if they are addicted to the presence of primary cilia. These results underscore the potential utility of agents that disrupt cilia for the treatment of Hh pathway-related MBs.",

We analyzed the mutational state of 116 PTC and we compared gene expression profiles of PTC-ga(+) and PTC-ga(-) from data of a 200 gene macroarray and quantitative PCR. Seventy five PTC were PTC-ga(+) and 41 were PTC-ga(-). Unsupervised analyses of macroarray data by hierarchical clustering led to a complete segregation of PTC-ga(+) and PTC-ga(-). In a series of 42 genes previously recognized as PTC 'marker' genes, 22 were found to be expressed at a comparable level in PTC-ga(-) and normal tissue. Thyroid-specific genes, TPO, TG, DIO1, and DIO2 were under-expressed in PTC-ga(+) but expressed at a normal level in PTC-ga(-). A few genes including DUOX1 and DUOX2 were selectively dys-regulated in PTC-ga(-). Tumor grade of PTC-ga(-) was lower than that of PTC-ga(+). There was a strong association between the mutational state and histiotype of PTC; 81% of PTC follicular variants were corresponded to PTC-ga(-), whereas 84% of PTC of classical form were PTC-ga(+).

PTC express high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor (Flt-1). PTC with the most intense expression of VEGF have the greatest recurrence risk. We hypothesized that blockade of VEGF would inhibit PTC growth. To test this, we used systemic VEGF monoclonal antibody (VEGF-MAb) to treat PTC xenografts in nude mice. Treated animals (n = 9) received 200 microg VEGF-MAb by daily i.p. injection for 10 wk, while control animals (n = 9) received vehicle alone. Tumor size was significantly reduced in the treatment group (0.28 +/- 0.06 vs 1.05 +/- 0.25 g, p = 0.008). VEGF immunostaining was more intense (2.57 +/- 0.30 vs 1.75 +/- 0.25, p = 0.06) and the number of p53 positive cells was increased (1.66 +/- 0.24 vs 0.83 +/- 0.31, p = 0.048) in treated tumors. Animal weight was similar in both groups (29.1 +/- 1.1 vs 27.4 +/- 1.1 g, p = 0.30). In conclusion, systemic VEGF-MAb significantly reduced the growth of PTC, suggesting that VEGF-MAb might be useful for treatment of resistant PTC.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Background. Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the commonest thyroid malignancy originating from the follicle cells in the thyroid. Despite a good overall prognosis, certain high-risk cases as in those with lymph node metastasis (LNM) have progressive disease and poorer prognosis. MicroRNAs are a class of non-protein-coding, 19-24 nucleotides single-stranded RNAs which regulate gene expression and these molecules have been shown to play a role in LNM. The integrated analysis of miRNAs and gene expression profiles together with transcription factors (TFs) has been shown to improve the identification of functional miRNA-target gene-TF relationships, providing a more complete view of molecular events underlying metastasis process. Objectives. We reanalyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets on PTC to identify differentially expressed miRNAs/genes in PTC patients with LNM-positive (LNM-P) versus lymph node negative (LNN) PTC patients and to investigate the miRNA-gene-TF regulatory circuit that regulate LNM in PTC. Results. PTC patients with LNM (PTC LNM-P) have a significantly shorter disease-free survival rate compared to PTC patients without LNM (PTC LNN) (Log-rank Mantel Cox test, p = 0.0049). We identified 181 significantly differentially expressed miRNAs in PTC LNM-P versus PTC LNN; 110 were upregulated and 71 were downregulated. The five topmost deregulated miRNAs were hsa-miR-146b, hsa-miR-375, hsa-miR-31, hsa-miR-7-2 and hsa-miR-204. In addition, 395 miRNAs were differentially expressed between PTC LNM-P and normal thyroid while 400 miRNAs were differentially expressed between PTC LNN and normal thyroid. We found four significant enrichment pathways potentially involved in metastasis to the lymph nodes, namely oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), leukocyte transendothelial migration and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. OxPhos was the most significantly perturbed pathway (p = 4.70E-06) involving downregulation of 90 OxPhos-related genes. Significant interaction of hsa-miR-301b with HLF, HIF and REL/NFkB transcription factors were identified exclusively in PTC LNM-P versus PTC LNN. Conclusion. We found evidence of five miRNAs differentially expressed in PTC LNM-P. Alteration in OxPhos pathway could be the central event in metastasis to the lymph node in PTC. We postulate that hsa-miR-301b might be involved in regulating LNM in PTC via interactions with HLF, HIF and REL/NFkB. To the best of our knowledge, the roles of these TFs have been studied in PTC but the precise role of this miRNA with these TFs in LNM in PTC has not been investigated. ",

Chromosomal rearrangements involving the RET gene, known as RET/PTC, are prevalent in thyroid papillary carcinomas from patients with radiation history. We studied the generation of RET/PTC in HTori-3 immortalized human thyroid cells exposed to a range of doses of gamma-radiation and harvested 2, 5-6, and 9 d later. RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3 were detected by RT-PCR followed by Southern blotting and hybridization with internal oligonucleotide probes. No RET/PTC was found in cells harvested 2 and 5-6 d after irradiation, whereas 59 RET/PTC events were detected in cells collected 9 d after exposure. The average rate of RET/PTC induction was 0.1 x 10(-6) after exposure to 0.1 Gy, 1.6 x 10(-6) after 1 Gy, 3.0 x 10(-6) after 5 Gy, and 0.9 x 10(-6) after 10 Gy. When adjusted for cell survival, the rate after 10 Gy was comparable with those after 5 Gy. RET/PTC1 was more common than RET/PTC3 after each dose, comprising 80% of all rearrangements. In this study, we demonstrate a dose-dependent induction of RET/PTC rearrangements in human thyroid cells after exposure to 0.1-10 Gy gamma-radiation. This provides additional evidence for a direct link between this genetic event and radiation exposure and offers a powerful experimental system for studying radiation-induced carcinogenesis in the thyroid gland.",

Immunohistochemical stain for p63 was negative in all conventional PTCs, but 14 (28.6%) cases of DSVPC showed p63 expression (p = 0.000). p53 was expressed in 38 (76.0%) cases of conventional PTC and 21 (42.9%) cases of DSVPC (p = 0.001). Galectin-3 was expressed in all 50 cases of conventional PTC, but eight (16.3%) cases of DSVPC did not express galectin-3 (p = 0.003). EMA was expressed more in DSVPC (40.8%) than in conventional PTC (20.0%, p = 0.024). In univariate analyses, Bcl-2 positivity (p = 0.016) and EMA negativity (p = 0.036) in DSVPC were associated with shorter time interval to tumor recurrence, but there was no significance for the two in multivariate analyses. DSVPC, a rare variant of PTC, has different immunohistochemical features from the conventional PTC, showing higher expression rate of p63 and lower expression rate of p53. It also shows galectin-3 negativity and EMA positivity.",

Originally, 10 cases with features of PTC were diagnosed as either follicular neoplasm or colloid nodule with or without HT. Histologically, 1 of 13 cases was a cystic variant and 7 of 13 cases were follicular variants of papillary carcinoma. It is important to be aware of the coexistence of PTC and HT.

We report three cases of thyroid MEC found in continuity with, and clearly arising from de-differentiation of, well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas (WDTCs).;The cases presented here included two women (aged 22 and 52) and one man (aged 58). One of these cases arose in conjunction with PTC, one with follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC), and one with Hurthle cell carcinoma (HCC). In all three cases, there was a gradual transition in morphology between the areas of typical WDTC and the areas showing MEC differentiation. In addition, immunohistochemistry demonstrated a gradual loss of thyroid specific markers (thyroid transcription factor-1, thyroglobulin) mirroring the change in morphology.;We conclude that thyroid MEC can arise from metaplastic de-differentiation of WDTC, including FTC or HCC in addition to PTC.

Sanger sequencing of SUFU in 23 additional PTCH1-negative Gorlin syndrome families identified a SUFU mutation in a second family.

        "Doc_abstract":"Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma are the rare progeny of precancerous lesions that usually remain stable or regress. For SCC the sequence appears to include TP53 mutant clones in normal skin; dysplasia; carcinoma in situ; and SCC. When such lesions are contiguous, their TP53 mutations are consistent with a single clonal lineage. The set of TP53 mutations in tumours is more restricted than in precancers, suggesting additional selection. Melanoma lies at the end of a continuum including mole, dysplastic naevus, radial growth melanoma and vertical growth. The genetics of melanoma is less clear. Basal cell carcinomas seem to arise without a precancer and contain mutations in TP53 and PTCH. Childhood sunlight exposure directs the location and frequency of precancers. For melanoma, its effects on intermittently exposed body sites are superimposed on the effect at sites chronically exposed. SCC precancers and tumours, BCC tumours and melanoma cell lines contain UV induced mutations. Sun exposed skin of normal individuals contains thousands of small clones of TP53 mutated cells. Predisposition to sunlight induced precancer is a multigenic trait involving factors such as hair and skin color, DNA repair proficiency and mole type and number. These each contribute a relative risk on the order of two to four. Familial predisposition to dysplastic naevi carries a larger risk. The cell of origin for melanoma is uncontroversial, and the proposed hair follicle origin of BCC is consistent with the presence of stem cells in the bulge region. The origin of SCCs and the arrangement of interfollicular stem cell compartments are less clear. Clonal expansion of the initial mutated cell may also be driven by sunlight. When a mutation confers apoptosis resistance, as TP53 mutations do, subsequent UV exposure will be more likely to kill normal cells than mutants. The latter can expand into a clone, only one cell of which need be mutated again. Immunosuppressant drugs may have the same effect as UV, facilitating the clonal expansion of precancers. In the absence of exogenous influences, mutant clones and precancers tend to regress. There is little evidence that regression of precancers is immunological, though regression of melanoma appears to be. The chemotherapeutic agent 5-FU causes regression of dysplasias by removing initiated cells, perhaps by enhancing apoptosis. In contrast, retinoic acid temporarily suppresses clonal expansion. Most sunscreens are mutagenic, with as yet unknown consequences. Mice develop dysplasias and SCCs after UV irradiation. Initiation and clonal expansion of dysplasias is UV driven, but conversion to SCC and subsequent growth involve spontaneous events. With chemical carcinogens mice develop papillomas that usually regress and thus are precancers. Tumour promotion yields abundant low risk papillomas that contain Hras1 mutations but rarely progress to SCC. High risk papillomas are infrequent but do convert to SCC, particularly if re-treated with mutagens. Conversion to SCC is associated with TP53 mutations. The mechanisms of multiple mutation and clonal expansion observed in human and mouse systems, respectively, are beginning to converge into a coherent understanding of precancerous events in skin.",

Hedgehog signaling members including PTCH1, GLI1, GLI2, and GLI3 were found co-localized with p63 expression in most hyperplastic basal cells, but rarely in normal basal cells, suggesting Hedgehog involvement in basal cell hyperplasia formation. Both CK-14 and CK-8 markers were found co-localized in the majority of hyperplastic basal cells, but relatively few in the normal basal cells, indicating a Hedgehog-promoted transitory differentiation. Furthermore, CK-14 and PTCH1 were found co-localized with CD44 in the hyerplastic basal cells, in a way similar to the CD44 co-localization with PTCH1 and GLI1 in the cancer cells. Together, the present study indicated Hedgehog involvement in forming basal cell hyperplasia and its progressing towards cancer, presumably by transforming the normal basal stem cells into the cancer stem cells where persistent Hedgehog activation might be mandatory for tumorigenesis.",

Multiple genetic surveys have been performed in PTCs, however, we are not aware of any such studies in aneuploid PTCs. In order to contribute to a better comprehension of the genetic basis of this neoplasm's more aggressive behaviour in 17 aneuploid PTCs we performed a comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis, studied the BRAF and RAS mutational status, searched for RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3 rearrangements and determined their expression profile. Array results were validated by TaqMan and immunohistochemistry. CGH revealed multiple non-random chromosomal abnormalities. BRAFV600E and RAS mutations were found in 41.2% and 33% of the carcinomas respectively. None of the studied cases presented RET/PTC1 or RET/PTC3 rearrangement. When comparing array data with the chromosomal, mutational and clinical data we found that: a) loss of control of cellular transcription was of major relevance in this group of neoplasms, HMGA2 being one of the most overexpressed genes; b) gene expression correlated with the mutational status of PTCs, as in BRAF+ cases cMET and FN1 were concomitantly overexpressed; and c) death from disease and distant metastasis was associated to the overexpression of DDR2 and to the down-regulation of genes involved in immune, inflammatory response, signal transduction and cell adhesion processes. In conclusion we have identified in aneuploid PTCs a group of significantly altered molecules that may represent preferential targets for the development of new more efficient therapies in this type of cancer.",

Studies on these tumors may therefore increase our understanding of normal germ cell development within different environments and cell lines derived from these lesions may also constitute an important vehicle for studying neoplasia and differentiation. Recently, we investigated the status of the PTCH1 locus in a large set of sporadic non-inflammatory, developmental cystic lesions. Our data showed allelic loss of microsatellite markers in close vicinity to the PTCH1 locus in both odontogenic keratocysts and dentigerous cysts as well as in ovarian dermoid cysts (ODC). In this study, we closely examined the status of the PTCH1 gene in ODCs. Although about 25% of cysts demonstrated LOH at the PTCH1 locus, no nonsense or missense mutations in the coding region of PTCH1 were detected in genomic DNA isolated from any of the ODCs examined by direct sequencing. Staining with PTCH1 and GLI1 antibodies showed that proteins were present in virtually all epithelial linings, with variable staining intensity not correlated with LOH and generally weaker for GLI1. However, cDNA microarray analysis performed on cell lines derived from ODCs did not show any significant alteration in the expression of the analyzed target genes of PTCH1 signaling in any of the cell lines examined, except for CyclinD1 (and several other genes generally not associated with PTCH1 signaling).",

        "Doc_abstract":"The Dicer1, Dcr-1 homolog (Drosophila) gene encodes a type III ribonuclease required for the canonical maturation and functioning of microRNAs (miRNAs). Subsets of miRNAs are known to regulate normal cerebellar granule cell development, in addition to the growth and progression of medulloblastoma, a neoplasm that often originates from granule cell precursors. Multiple independent studies have also demonstrated that deregulation of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh)-Patched (Ptch) signaling, through miRNAs, is causative of granule cell pathologies. In the present study, we investigated the genetic interplay between miRNA biogenesis and Shh-Ptch signaling in granule cells of the cerebellum by way of the Cre/lox recombination system in genetically engineered models of Mus musculus (mouse). We demonstrate that, although the miRNA biogenesis and Shh-Ptch-signaling pathways, respectively, regulate the opposing growth processes of cerebellar hypoplasia and hyperplasia leading to medulloblastoma, their concurrent deregulation was nonadditive and did not bring the growth phenotypes toward an expected equilibrium. Instead, mice developed either hypoplasia or medulloblastoma, but of a greater severity. Furthermore, some genotypes were bistable, whereby subsets of mice developed hypoplasia or medulloblastoma. This implies that miRNAs and Shh-Ptch signaling regulate an important developmental transition in granule cells of the cerebellum. We also conclusively show that the Dicer1 gene encodes a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor gene for Ptch1-induced medulloblastoma, with the monoallielic loss of Dicer1 more severe than biallelic loss. These findings exemplify how genetic interplay between pathways may produce nonadditive effects with a substantial and unpredictable impact on biology. Furthermore, these findings suggest that the functional dosage of Dicer1 may nonadditively influence a wide range of Shh-Ptch-dependent pathologies. ",

We report the detection of a novel BRAF triplet deletion in a case of PTC displaying a predominantly solid growth pattern. The deletion leads to the replacement of a valine and a lysine by a glutamate in the BRAF activation segment (BRAF(VK600-1E)), thus mimicking partially the 2 BRAF mutations previously described. Our study reinforces the existence of a close relationship between the occurrence of some types of BRAF mutation and some PTC histotypes.

Follicular adenomas and carcinomas show frequently the presence of mutations in one of the three ras genes. Papillary carcinomas show frequently a specific gene rearrangement which gives rise to the formation of several types of so-called RET/PTC chimeric genes. This lesions occur in almost 50% of papillary cancers and consist in the juxtaposition of the 3' or tyrosine kinase domain of the RET gene (which codes for a receptor protein not normally expressed in follicular thyroid cells) with the 5' domain of ubiquitously expressed genes, which provide the promoter and dimerization functions, necessary for the constitutive activation of RET/PTC proteins. Anaplastic carcinomas are frequently associated with mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor.

Utilizing TNF-alpha receptor-specific agonist monoclonal antibodies, we demonstrated that the TNF-alpha receptor p55 mediated the antiproliferative action of TNF-alpha, while the p75 receptor did not affect cell proliferation in the NP cell line. The resistant PTC cell lines, however, showed a graded loss of p55 receptor-mediated antiproliferation and a concomitant activation of a p75 receptor-mediated growth stimulation. Shedding of TNF receptors is an important mechanism of TNF-alpha receptor metabolism. The p55 receptor mediated the TNF-alpha-induced up-regulation of the shedding of the p75 TNF-alpha receptor. The p75 receptor mediated the TNF-alpha-induced down-regulation of the shedding of the p55 receptor. However, the shedding of the p75 receptor was decreased and the shedding of the p55 receptor was increased in the resistant R60 cell line compared with the NP cell line, in the presence and absence of TNF-alpha. In contrast, IFN-gamma increased shedding of both p55 and p75 TNF-alpha receptors in NP and R60 cell lines with equal potency. Furthermore, the resistant PTC cell lines have increased basal manganous superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) expression and blunted induction of MnSOD mRNA upon short-term. TNF-alpha treatment (less than 2 h of treatment). The results indicate that a decrease in signal transduction via the p55 TNF-alpha receptor and concomitant increase in signal transduction via the p75 TNF-alpha receptor are involved in the development of PTC cell resistance.",

Eight patients presented with pelvic-related symptoms whereas 2 were incidentally discovered during pregnancy, all with disease confined to the ovary. There were 8 papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) (2 classic and 6 follicular variant) and 2 poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas. Two of the 10 thyroid carcinomas relapsed after an initial diagnosis of \"benign\" struma. Both occurred in young women with ovarian cysts discovered during pregnancy. The cystectomy from 1 patient showed thyroid follicles with nuclear features of the follicular variant of PTC whereas the cyst from the second patient showed thyroid follicles with subtle nuclear features, suggestive but not diagnostic of PTC. Both patients presented with disseminated PTC 3 and 4 years after the initial diagnosis, involving the pelvis in both cases and also the liver parenchyma in 1 case. The 2 patients received radioactive iodine therapy after thyroidectomy and are both alive with disease 6 years after diagnosis. The criteria separating hyperplastic nodules from well-differentiated follicular variant of PTC in the thyroid gland seem to be applicable to thyroid-type carcinomas arising in SO. The propensity for adverse clinical behavior does not seem to be related to the grade or histologic type of carcinoma in this small series. The hormonal milieu during pregnancy may lead to progression of malignant SO and such patients should be closely followed, particularly if their treatment consists of cystectomy alone.",

Human PTC [PTC/TIL (PTC with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes) and PTC/PTC (PTC without tumor infiltrating lymphocytes)], Graves' disease (GD), and normal thyroid (N) tissues were xenografted sc into 22 SCID and 21 nude mice. Blood samples were taken every 2 weeks for measurement of human IgG and thyroid antibodies. Seven weeks after xenografting, xenografted thyroid tissues were analyzed for thyrocyte HLA-DR and ICAM-1 expression. SCID mice xenografted with PTC/TIL (PTC/TIL-SCID) manifested IgG production for 6 weeks, but nude mice showed diminished and disappearing IgG production from these xenografts. Thyroperoxidase (TPO)-antibody (Ab)(TPO-Ab) was not detectable in PTC/TIL-SCID despite the presence of TPO-Ab in some donors. Thyroglobulin-Ab (Tg-Ab) was detectable in all mice of PTC/TIL-SCID. Thyrocyte HLA-DR expression from PTC-SCID was markedly increased, compared with that from nude mice xenografts or from N xenografts in SCID mice. In addition, thyrocyte HLA-DR expression from PTC-nude was markedly increased, compared with the expression seen in GD-nude and N-nude xenografts. ICAM-1 expression on TEC from PTC xenografts in the SCID mouse was markedly increased, compared with N xenografts. ICAM-1 expression on TEC from PTC did not show any difference between SCID and nude mice. ICAM-1 expression on TEC from PTC xenografts in the nude mice was markedly increased, compared with those from GD and N xenografts. In conclusion, TIL in PTC produce Tg-Ab but do not produce TPO-Ab. HLA-DR expression on TEC from PTC is strongly constitutive, but it is also affected by TIL. TIL might have some role in control of PTC through partial expression of HLA-DR on TEC. ICAM-1 expression on TEC from PTC seems to be entirely constitutive, and it is not affected by the presence of local lymphocytes, in contrast to autoimmune thyroid disease.",

All ultrasound-guided FNA biopsies clinically suspected to indicate a lymph node metastasis and specimens with lymphocytes were excluded from the data.;Of the 291 patients identified for evaluation of recurrence, 250 had papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), 10 had follicular carcinoma, 22 had medullary carcinoma, 7 had Hürthle cell carcinoma, and 2 had a previous thyroidectomy for an unknown type of thyroid carcinoma. For all FNAs that were clinically suspicious or intermediate for recurrence, the rate of positivity was 71.8% (209 patients). All cases diagnosed as \"positive for PTC\" or \"suspicious for PTC\" on TB FNA were found to have soft tissue metastasis on follow-up surgical resection. This resulted in a negative predictive value of 88.4% and a positive predictive value of 100%. The average time between thyroidectomy and TB FNA was 73.5 months. Of the patients with a previous diagnosis of PTC, those with suspicious/positive cytology were more likely to be women, to be older at thyroidectomy, to have documented metastasis to other sites as well as extrathyroidal extension and multifocal primary disease as compared with nondiagnostic/negative cytology cases. Patient age ≥45 years, primary tumor size at thyroidectomy, and surgical resection margin status had no statistical significance for predicting risk of TB recurrence.;TB recurrence of PTC is most likely to occur in patients who have the following clinicopathologic parameters: documented metastasis to any site, extrathyroidal extension, and increased number of primary cancer foci.",

RET/PTC oncoproteins lack extracellular or transmembrane domains, and activation takes place through constitutive dimerization mediated through coiled-coil motifs in the NH(2) terminus of the chimeric protein. Based on the observation that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitor PKI166 decreased RET/PTC kinase autophosphorylation and activation of downstream effectors in thyroid cells, despite lacking activity on the purified RET kinase, we proceeded to examine possible functional interactions between RET/PTC and EGFR. Conditional activation of RET/PTC oncoproteins in thyroid PCCL3 cells markedly induced expression and phosphorylation of EGFR, which was mediated in part through mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. RET and EGFR were found to coimmunoprecipitate. The ability of RET to form a complex with EGFR was not dependent on recruitment of Shc or on their respective kinase activities. Ligand-induced activation of EGFR resulted in phosphorylation of a kinase-dead RET, an effect that was entirely blocked by PKI166. These effects were biologically relevant, as the EGFR kinase inhibitors PKI166, gefitinib, and AEE788 inhibited cell growth induced by various constitutively active mutants of RET in thyroid cancer cells as well as NIH3T3 cells. These data indicate that EGFR contributes to RET kinase activation, signaling, and growth stimulation and may therefore be an attractive therapeutic target in RET-induced neoplasms.",

Eighteen EPONs were retrieved from our surgical pathology files and reviewed for defining morphologic features. Cases having the typical nuclear features of PTC were excluded. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CK19, HBME1, and CD56 was carried out. Microdissection, polymerase chain reaction, and sequencing of exon 15 of the BRAF gene were completed. Cases were evaluated for rearranged in transformation/papillary thyroid carcinoma RET/PTC rearrangement by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). The majority of the tumors exhibited a distinctive histologic appearance. They were composed of true papillae lined by a single layer of predominantly cuboidal cells with oncocytic cytoplasm; hobnailing was typically prominent. Three tumors showed taller cells with uniformly apical nuclei and no hobnailing. Ten of 18 cases showed vascular and/or capsular invasion; hence, if the diagnostic criteria used to evaluate follicular neoplasms are applied, more than half of the tumors would be considered minimally invasive carcinomas. No cases were immunoreactive with antibodies to HBME1, whereas only 1 of 13 was immunoreactive for CK19. Six of 7 interpretable cases were immunoreactive for CD56. No BRAF point mutations or RET/PTC rearrangements were identified in the examined cases. All patients were alive at the time of last follow-up and no locally recurrent disease had been reported; however, 1 case was remarkable for a lymph node metastasis.

Several phenotypes of DS might arise from a reduced response of trisomic cells to the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) growth factor. If all trisomic cells show a similar reduced response to SHH, then up-regulation of the pathway in trisomic cells might ameliorate multiple DS phenotypes. We crossed Ptch1tm1Mps/+ mice, in which the canonical SHH pathway is expected to be up-regulated in every SHH-responsive cell due to the loss of function of one allele of the pathway suppressor, Ptch1, to the Ts65Dn DS model and assessed the progeny for possible rescue of multiple DS-related phenotypes. Down-regulation of Ptch produced several previously unreported effects on development by itself, complicating interpretation of some phenotypes, and a number of structural or behavioral effects of trisomy were not compensated by SHH signaling. However, a deficit in a nest-building task was partially restored in Ts;Ptch+/- mice, as were the structural anomalies of the cerebellum seen in Ts65Dn mice.

The BRAF mutation (V599E) was detected in 38% of the samples that were PTC on histopathology; RET/PTC was found in 18% of the PTC cases. In all the cases, the presence of the genetic alteration was confirmed in the surgically resected tumor. The identification of BRAF mutation and RET/PTC refined the diagnosis of PTC in five of 15 samples that were considered either indeterminate or insufficient at cytology. No mutation was found in aspirates of follicular adenomas and nontoxic nodular goiters. These results indicate that BRAF mutation and RET/PTC rearrangements are molecular markers of PTC that can be applied to FNA in adjunct to traditional cytology.",

According to the literature, the application of ancillary techniques on cytology comes in handy as a challenging aid in ruling out a malignant outcome on both conventional and liquid-based cytological preparations. However, the evaluation of somatic mutations, including BRAFV600E, usually performed by DNA techniques, may have some limitations in a worldwide diffusion. In this perspective, few authors emphasized the morphological search for BRAFV600E mutations harbored in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and characterized by specific architectural and cellular findings (i.e. eosinophilic cells defined as 'plump cells' and sickle-shaped nuclei). Hence, the detection of eosinophilic cytoplasm of mutated PTC cells seems to suggest the possible involvement of the 'Warburg effect' pioneering the ability of cancer cells to convert glucose into lactic acid. The recent yields of immunohistochemical expression of monocarboxylate transporters in mutated PTCs may suggest the accumulation of lactate in these plump cells. Equally importantly, the detection of these morphological findings using fine-needle aspiration cytology may be helpful in triaging thyroid lesions and limiting costs. Additionally, it may lead to the stratification of the malignant risk and personalized management in cases with multifocal lesions. ",

The genetic events in the familial C-cell-derived tumors are known and genotype-phenotype correlations are well established. In contrast, the case for a familial predisposition of non-medullary thyroid carcinoma is only now beginning to emerge. Although the majority of papillary (PTC) and follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTC) are sporadic, familial tumors account for over 5% of cases. The presence of multifocal papillary carcinoma is a common feature of FNMTC. The familial follicular cell-derived tumors or non-medullary thyroid carcinomas encompass a heterogeneous group of diseases, including diverse syndromic-associated tumors and non-syndromic tumors. Based on clinico-pathologic findings, FNMTC is divided into two groups. The first includes familial syndromes characterized by a predominance of non-thyroidal tumors, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS), Carney complex type 1, and Werner syndrome. The second group includes familial syndromes characterized by a predominance of NMTC, such as pure familial (f) PTC with or without oxyphilia, fPTC with papillary renal cell carcinoma, and fPTC with multinodular goiter. Some characteristic morphologic findings should alert the pathologist of a possible familial cancer syndrome, which may lead to further molecular genetic evaluation.",

Due to image quality, 21 patients were finally suitable for further analysis. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) of normal thyroid tissues and PTCs for 21 patients were calculated. Tumor aggressiveness was defined by surgical histopathology. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the difference in ADCs among groups of normal thyroid tissues and PTCs with and without features of tumor aggressiveness. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to assess the discriminative specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of and determine the cutoff value for the ADC in stratifying PTCs with tumor aggressiveness.;There was no significant difference in ADC values between normal thyroid tissues and PTCs. However, ADC values of PTCs with extrathyroidal extension (ETE; 1.53±0.25×10(-3) mm2/s) were significantly lower than corresponding values from PTCs without ETE (2.37±0.67×10(-3) mm2/s; p<0.005). ADC values identified 3 papillary carcinoma patients with extrathyroidal extension that would have otherwise been candidates for observation based on ultrasound evaluations. The cutoff value of ADC to discriminate PTCs with and without ETE was determined at 1.85×10(-3) mm2/s with a sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 85%, and ROC curve area of 0.85.;ADC value derived from DW-MRI before surgery has the potential to stratify ETE in patients with PTCs.",

However, it is important to identify PTC characteristics that indicate high risk for recurrence and metastasis. To date, overexpression of the membrane mucin, MUC1, has been investigated as a key molecular event in the pathogenesis of aggressive PTC. However, other membrane-associated mucins, matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-13 (TIMP-3), have not been studied yet. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression levels of MUC4, MUC15, MMP-13, and TIMP-3 and their prognostic significance in PTC.;We analyzed MUC4, MUC15, MMP-13, and TIMP-3 expression in 10 PTC and 10 normal thyroid tissue samples using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Tissue array blocks were obtained from 98 PTC cases. Tumor regions and nontumor regions were analyzed in tissue array blocks and immunohistochemistry studies were conducted using sectioned slides. Semiquantitative scores were correlated with clinicopathological factors of 98 PTC patients.;MUC4- and MUC15-specific mRNA was increased by 78-fold and 4.75-fold, respectively, in PTC samples compared with normal thyroid tissues. MMP-13 and TIMP-3 gene expression levels were decreased by approximately 0.39-fold and 0.53-fold, respectively. By immunohistochemistry, MUC4 and MUC15 expression levels were increased in PTC samples compared with normal thyroid tissues (p < 0.001). MMP-13 and TIMP-3 expression levels were decreased in PTC samples compared with normal thyroid tissues (p < 0.001). High MUC4 scores were significantly correlated with small tumor size and papillary thyroid microcarcinoma subtype. High MUC15 scores were significantly correlated with age (≥45 years), distant metastasis, and multifocality.;MUC4 and MUC15 were overexpressed in PTC, and high MUC15 expression was associated with high malignant potential.

Telomerase has been shown in stem cells and found to be activated in tumor tissues and immortalized cells. We wanted to test whether the expression of the telomerase complex subunits correlate with the enzyme activity in human thyroid tissue. Hence, we determined the expression of hTERT, hTR and TP1 mRNA by RT-PCR and compared the results to telomerase activity as detected by the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay. Fifteen benign goiters (G), 11 follicular carcinomas (FTC) including 2 oncocytic follicular carcinomas (also called Hurthle cell carcinoma, oFTC), 12 papillary carcinomas (PTC) including 3 microcarcinomas (mPTC), and 12 undifferentiated anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (UTC) were investigated. Experienced pathologists performed histological and pTNM classification in each specimen. RT-PCR analysis revealed that TP1 was ubiquitously expressed in all G and carcinomas. hTR was expressed in 4 out of 15 G, in 2 out of 3 mPTC, in 5 out of 9 PTC, in 5 out of 9 FTC, in all oFTC and in 9 out of 12 UTC samples. Regarding all carcinomas, no statistically significant correlation was observed between hTR-expression and tumor stage, lymph node or distant metastasis. hTERT-expression was associated with malignancy and tumor stage. All mPTC and 13 out of 15 G did not express hTERT, whereas all samples of pT3-4 tumor stage of FTC, PTC, UTC and all oFTC were positive for hTERT. No telomerase activity could be detected in G. Telomerase activity in carcinoma was only measurable in tissues that expressed the catalytic subunit hTERT. Our data indicate that telomerase activity is up-regulated in neoplastic cells. In contrast to TP1 and hTR, hTERT and telomerase activity may be of help in identifying invasive tumors and may be additional markers for classification of benign goiter and malignant thyroid carcinoma.",

PTC represents 80-90% of all thyroid cancers and over the past five years, more than 200 manuscripts have been published about the relationship between \"B-Raf(V600E) and thyroid cancer\". B-Raf(V600E) genetically arises from a transversion point mutation (valine-to-glutamate substitution at amino acid residue-600, V600E) and leads to over activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway. The MAPK pathway is essential for transmitting proliferation signals generated by cell surface receptors and cytoplasmic signaling elements to the nucleus. In many cancers, including thyroid cancer, B-Raf(V600E) appears to play a crucial role in cell proliferation, survival and de-differentiation. In thyroid cancer, the V600E mutation occurs with greater frequently in aggressive subtypes of PTC, and in individuals that present at advanced stages of disease with extra-thyroidal extension and/or lymph node metastases. B-Raf(V600E) is considered a marker of aggressive disease in both PTC (>1 cm) and micro-PTC (</=1 cm), and interestingly, is associated with both loss of I-131 avidity and PTC recurrence. Though treatment of patients with thyroid cancer is usually successful and most patients are rendered disease-free, to date there are no effective therapies for patients with invasive, non-radioiodine sensitive tumors or metastatic disease. In this article we will review the relation between B-Raf(V600E) and PTC, as well as both non-selective and selective pharmacological agents currently under investigation for treatment of B-Raf(V600E) positive PTC.",

Thus, here we report the identification of somatic mutations for Chinese PTC using 402 tumor-normal pairs (Discovery: 91 pairs via exome sequencing; validation: 311 pairs via Sanger sequencing). We observed three distinct mutational signatures, evidently different from the two mutational signatures among Caucasian PTCs. Ten significantly mutated genes were identified, most previously uncharacterized. Notably, we found that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) GAS8-AS1 is the secondary most frequently altered gene and acts as a novel tumor suppressor in PTC. As a mutation hotspot, the c.713A>G/714T>C dinucleotide substitution was found among 89.1% patients with GAS8-AS1 mutations and associated with advanced PTC disease (P = 0.009). Interestingly, the wild-type lncRNA GAS8-AS1 (A713T714) showed consistently higher capability to inhibit cancer cell growth compared to the mutated lncRNA (G713C714). Further studies also elucidated the oncogene nature of the G protein-coupled receptor LPAR4 and its c.872T>G (p.Ile291Ser) mutation in PTC malignant transformation. The BRAF c.1799T>A (p.Val600Glu) substitution was present in 59.0% Chinese PTCs, more frequently observed in patients with lymph node metastasis (P = 1.6 × 10(-4)).

To determine if PTC-associated gene expression could predict lymph node involvement, a separate cohort of 130 primary PTC (54 metastatic and 76 nonmetastatic) was investigated. The BRAF(V600E) mutational status was compared with qPCR data to identify genes that might be regulated by abnormal BRAF/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling.;We identified and validated new PTC-associated transcripts. Three genes (CST6, CXCL14, and DHRS3) are strongly associated with PTC. Immunohistochemical analysis of CXCL14 confirmed the qPCR data and showed protein expression in PTC epithelial cells. We also observed that CST6, CXCL14, DHRS3, and SPP1 were associated with PTC lymph node metastasis, with CST6, CXCL14, and SPP1 being positively correlated with metastasis and DHRS3 being negatively correlated. Finally, we found a strong correlation between CST6 and CXCL14 expression and BRAF(V600E) mutational status, suggesting that these genes may be induced subsequently to BRAF activation and therefore may be downstream in the BRAF/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway.;CST6, CXCL14, DHRS3, and SPP1 may play a role in PTC pathogenesis and progression and are possible molecular targets for PTC therapy.",

Oncogenic activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase encoding RET gene occurs typically by gene rearrangement in papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) and by missense mutation in medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTC). These genetic alterations lead to the expression of deregulated products characterized by ligand-independent activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase of Ret. Such features suggest the possibility of using specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors to block the Ret oncoproteins signaling. The present report summarizes the cellular effects of the arylidene 2-indolinone Ret inhibitor RPI-1 (formerly Cpd1) on the human PTC cell line TPC-1 which spontaneously harbors the RET/PTC1 oncogene. The results provide evidence that RPI-1 is able to inhibit cell growth and to interfere with Ret/ptc1-driven signaling.

The transversion is frequently detected in the conventional type, Warthin-like and tall cell variants, but is rare in the follicular variant of PTC. Conventional PTC is often presented with tumors of mixed architecture, which besides the papillary structures also contain areas with follicular and solid morphology in which the details of BRAF mutational status are unknown. We set out to differentially investigate the presence of mutated BRAF in the individual structural components microdissected from 44 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded PTC tissues from 40 patients. The mutation was detected in at least 1 structural component in 23 tumors (52%). Different structural components of the same tumor had identical BRAF status in 41/44 tumors (93%). In 3 tumors the BRAF(T1799A) mutation was found only in the papillary, but not in the follicular component. Mutational patterns identical to those in the primary tumors were found in 11/12 lymph node metastases (92%, including both BRAF(T1799A)-positive and -negative cases). The high concordance of the BRAF mutational status in structurally distinct areas suggests a rather homogeneous distribution of neoplastic epithelial cells in a conventional PTC tumor in most cases. These results imply the reliability of preoperative molecular diagnosis of PTC regardless of the type of tumor component at the site of biopsy sampling and suggest that the majority of patients with BRAF mutation-positive PTC may benefit from the targeted pharmacotherapy.",

We have previously reported that GPC3 inhibits Hedgehog (Hh) signaling by competing with Patched (Ptc) for Hh binding. We also showed that GPC3 binds with high affinity to Hh through its core protein, but that it does not interact with Ptc. Several members of the glypican family, including GPC3, are subjected to an endoproteolytic cleavage by the furin-like convertase family of endoproteases. Surprisingly, however, we have found that a mutant GPC3 that cannot be processed by convertases is as potent as wild-type GPC3 in stimulating Wnt activity in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines and 293T cells and in promoting hepatocellular carcinoma growth. In this study, we show that processing by convertases is essential for GPC3-induced inhibition of Hh signaling. Moreover, we show that a convertase-resistant GPC3 stimulates Hh signaling by increasing the binding of this growth factor to Ptc. Consistent with this, we show that the convertase-resistant mutant binds to both Hh and Ptc through its heparan sulfate (HS) chains. Unexpectedly, we found that the mutant core protein does not bind to Hh. We also report that the convertase-resistant mutant GPC3 carries HS chains with a significantly higher degree of sulfation than those of wild-type GPC3. We propose that the structural changes generated by the lack of cleavage determine a change in the sulfation of the HS chains and that these hypersulfated chains mediate the interaction of the mutant GPC3 with Ptc.

Little also is known about why Hedgehog (HH) signaling is activated in some GIST. HH binds to and inactivates the receptor protein patched homolog (PTCH).;Ptch was conditionally inactivated in mice (to achieve constitutive HH signaling) using a Cre recombinase regulated by the lysozyme M promoter.

Tumors were characterized by in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, immunoblot, and quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analyses. Cell transformation was assessed by soft agar assay.;Loss of Ptch from lysozyme M-expressing cells resulted in the development of tumors of GIST-like localization and histology; these were reduced when mice were given imatinib, a drug that targets KIT and PDGFRA. The Hh signaling pathway was activated in the tumor cells, and Pdgfrα, but not Kit, was overexpressed and activated. Lineage tracing revealed that Cre-expressing intestinal cells were Kit-negative. These cells sometimes expressed Pdgfrα and were located near Kit-positive interstitial cells of Cajal.

Here, gradients of extracellular matrix molecules are formed synthetically by the combination of a surface nanopatterning technique called block copolymer nanolithography (BCN) and a biofunctionalisation technique. A modified substrate dip-coating process of BCN allows for the formation of precise molecular gradients of cyclic RGDfK peptide patches at interfaces, which are presented to cells for testing cell adhesion and polarisation. Surfaces formed by BCN consist of hexagonally ordered gold dot patterns with a gradient in particle spacing. Each dot serves as a chemical anchor for the binding of cyclic RGDfK peptides, which are specifically recognised by alpha(v)beta(3) integrins. Due to steric hindrance only up to one integrin binds to one functionalised gold dot which forms a peptide patch spacing. We demonstrate how cell morphology, adhesion area, actin and vinculin distribution as well as cell body polarisation are influenced by the peptide patch spacing gradient. As a consequence, these gradients of adhesive ligands induce cell orientation towards smaller particle spacing when the gradient strength is 15nm/mm at least. This implicates that an adherent cell's sensitivity to differentiate between ligand patch spacing is approximately 1nm across the cell body.",

Twenty-seven of 196 (13.8%) MTC cases showed an association with PTC and in particular 21 of 190 (11.05%) with an incidental mPTC.

We also analyzed the epidemiologic, clinical, and pathologic features of MTC associated and not associated with PTC without finding any difference. In particular the outcome of the MTC did not appear to be influenced by the presence of the PTC and the specific radioiodine treatments. Moreover, although we cannot completely exclude a shared pathogenic event as the cause of both MTC and PTC, the molecular analysis of RET gene alterations did not show any common mutation.",

Pathologic features recorded included tumor size, presence of extrathyroid extension (ETE), and metastases. Prognostic scores were calculated according to the MACIS system.;Differences in patient demographics, preoperative cytologic findings, tumor pathologic features, and prognostic risk categories between conventional and FV PTC were studied.;There were no differences in patient age or sex. Cytologic findings from FV PTC were significantly more likely to be reported in a lower-risk category than those from conventional PTC for (1) malignant vs lower-risk category (22 [56%] vs 2 [8%]); (2) suspected malignant or malignant vs lower-risk category (26 [66%] vs 6 [23%]); and (3) follicular neoplasm or higher-risk category vs lower-risk category (34 [87%] vs 10 [38%]) (P < .001 for all 3 comparisons). There was also a significantly higher likelihood of false-negative cytologic findings among FV PTC cases (5 [19%] vs 1 [3%]) (P = .03).

One possibility is that they form in response to injury induced by fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). Other hypotheses are that the chemically-altered colloid produced by PTC induces MGCs to act as colloidophages, or else MGCs are a non-specific immune response ingesting neoplastic follicle cells. We assigned 172 cases of PTC a semi-quantitative score for MGCs. Cases with \"many\" MGCs were immunohistochemically stained for AEI/AEIII, CD68, and CD163 to assess for epithelial vs histiocytic differentiation, and for thyroglobulin and TTF-1 to assess for MGC ingestion of colloid or thyroid follicle cells respectively. Overall, we identified MGCs in 100/172 (58.1%) PTC specimens; in 45 (26.2%), \"many\" MGCs were found, while in 55 (31.9%) MGCs were \"few.\" The mean sizes of PTC in cases with many as opposed to rare/no MGCs was 2.50 cm vs 1.8 [P = 0.003]. The cases of PTC with many MGCs had higher multifocality (26/45 vs 51/127 [P = 0.06]), extrathyroidal extension (21/45 vs 36/127 [P = 0.03]), and recurrence (8/45 vs 9/127 [P = 0.08]), than did cases with rare or no MGCs.

These results indicate that MGCs in PTC are of histiocytic origin.

Using a liver cancer model induced by diethylnitrosamine (DEN) which mimics the process from liver injury, abnormal hepatocyte proliferation, and hepatocirrhosis to hepatocyte canceration, we investigated the abnormal activation of the Shh pathway by examining the expression of Shh, patched-1 (Ptch), smoothened (SMO), and glioma-associated oncogene-1 (Gli1) genes. During this process, the expression of CDK1 and cyclin B1 protein, which are two components of the M-phase promoting factor (MPF) controlling G2/M transition, was also examined to explore the potential relationship between Shh activation and cell cycle progression. We observed that the cells with Shh, Ptch, and Gli1 protein expression were mainly distributed in hyperplastic nodule, cancerous node, the epithelia of interlobular bile duct, and precancerous tissues. A gradually increasing tendency of the positive expression rate of Shh, Ptch, and Gli1 proteins in the process from the beginning normal tissue to the final cancer formation was revealed. The cyclin B1 and CDK1 expression level was higher in the DEN-induced rats as compared with normal rats, and their expression was mainly distributed in the portal area of the liver, hyperplastic nodule, cancerous node, and precancerous tissues. Our results suggested that the Shh signaling pathway is activated during liver carcinogenesis, and activated Shh signaling promotes the cell proliferation by facilitating the G2/M transition through increasing the expression of cyclin B1 and CDK1 protein, which eventually results in the development of liver cancer. Better understanding of the Shh signaling pathway in HCC may contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies in inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting cell cycle arrest.",

However, its prevalence has been reported variably and its relation to clinical outcome has been controversial. The characteristic nuclear features of PTC usually render the diagnosis, but problem arises with equivocal cytologic features that are present focally. Although there remains some controversy, CK19 has been reported to be a useful ancillary tool for diagnosis of PTC. To evaluate the expression rate of RET/PTC rearrangement and CK19 in PTCs in a Korean population, we studied 115 papillary thyroid carcinomas in 3 mm-core tissue microarray based immunohistochemical analysis. The prevalence of Ret protein expression was 62.6% and the CK19 immunoreactivity was 80.9%. There was no statistically significant association between the Ret positivity and CK19 immunoreactivity, although the percent agreement of the two was relatively high. The clinicopathological variables did not correlate with the expression of Ret. In conclusion, the prevalence of Ret protein expression and its clinicopathological implications in a Korean population are not much different from those reported in previous studies. However, its detection via immunohistochemistry can be a useful diagnostic tool for diagnosing papillary thyroid carcinoma in conjunction with CK19.",

Caveolin-1 expression decreased in the following order: clPTC, fvPTC, FTC, PT and FTA. The diagnostic accuracy of AV09019 was better than that of sc894 for discriminating: FTA from FTC, FTA or FTC from the follicular variant of PTC, total PTC from nonmalignant tissue, and malignant tumors from nonmalignant tissue. Spearman's analysis revealed positive correlations of caveolin-1 expression and extrathyroidal invasion (p< 0.05) in PTC for both antibodies.

However, there are caveats associated with the use of the molecular approach in fine-needle aspiration (FNA), particularly for RET/PTC, that should be taken into consideration. It has been claimed that a clonal or sporadic presence of this abnormality in follicular cells can distinguish between malignant and benign nodules. Nevertheless, the most commonly used PCR-based techniques lack the capacity to quantify the number of abnormal cells. Because fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is the most sensitive method for detecting gene rearrangement in a single cell, we compared results from FISH and conventional RT-PCR obtained in FNA of a large cohort of consecutive patients with suspicious nodules and investigated the feasibility of setting a FISH-FNA threshold capable of distinguishing non-clonal from clonal molecular events. For this purpose, a home brew break-apart probe, able to recognize the physical breakage of RET, was designed. While a ≥3% FISH signal for broken RET was sufficient to distinguish nodules with abnormal follicular cells, only samples with a ≥6.8% break-apart FISH signal also exhibited positive RT-PCR results. On histological analysis, all nodules meeting the ≥6.8% threshold proved to be malignant. These data corroborate the power of FISH when compared with RT-PCR in quantifying the presence of RET/PTC in FNA and validate the RT-PCR efficiency in detecting clonal RET/PTC alterations. ",

To elucidate the mechanisms underlying such progression and identify novel diagnostic markers, we aimed to discover the underlying gene associated with PTC. Integrated analysis of microarray datasets was performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between PTCs and normal tissues. GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were then performed to uncover the functions of DEGs. Furthermore, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs was constructed. Five GEO datasets were obtained. Totally, 154 DEGs across the studies were identified, including 26 upregulated and 128 downregulated DEGs. In the PPI network, MLLT1, DLG2, and EFEMP1 were the hub proteins, in which DLG2 and EFEMP1 were involved in tumor progression. Among the top 10 up- and downregulated genes, the dysregulation genes of TPO, CDH16, and MPPED2 may be closely related to the tumorigenesis of PTC. By integrated analysis of multiple gene expression profiles, we propose that the dysregulation genes of TPO and MPPED2 will be the promising diagnostic markers for PTCs. ",

The signaling molecules (Ptc 1, Gli 1 and Sox9) of the hedgehog pathway were investigated. A rat model of articular cartilage defect was used to evaluate cartilage repair after transplantation with dedifferentiated chondrocytes. After Shh gene transfer, the hedgehog pathway was upregulated in dedifferentiated chondrocytes. Real time-PCR and western blot analysis verified the stronger expression of Ptc1, Gli1 and Sox9 in Shh transfected cells. Shh upregulates the Shh signaling pathway and multiple cytokines (bone morphogenetic protein 2 and insulin-like growth factor 1) in dedifferentiated chondrocytes. After transplantation in the joint, histologic analysis of the regenerative tissues revealed that significantly better cartilage repair in rats transplanted with Shh transfected cells.

The goal of the current study was to compare the immunohistochemical expression of PAX8 with HBME-1 and cytokeratin 19 (CK19) expression on cell block preparations of PTC and benign thyroid nodules (BTN).;Thirty-two cases of PTC and 20 cases of BTN diagnosed on fine-needle aspiration were included.

HBME-1 and CK19 were found to have high sensitivity (0.78 and 0.75, respectively) and specificity (0.95 for both) for PTC. Statistically significant differences in staining intensity and distribution were noted for the PAX8 antibody (negative [1 of 32 cases] to weakly positive [20 of 32 cases] in 65.6% of PAX8-positive PTCs, and intermediate to strong in 100% of BTNs).;In contrast to PAX8, HBME-1 and CK19 were found to have a high degree of both sensitivity and specificity for PTC. The results of the current study demonstrate that strong PAX8 staining appears to be typical of BTNs, whereas negative to weakly positive staining is noted in PTC.

We thus evaluated CBX7 expression in various snap-frozen and paraffin-embedded thyroid carcinoma tissues of different degrees of malignancy by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. CBX7 expression progressively decreased with malignancy grade and neoplasia stage. Indeed, it decreased in an increasing percentage of cases going from benign adenomas to papillary (PTC), follicular, and anaplastic (ATC) thyroid carcinomas. This finding coincides with results obtained in rat and mouse models of thyroid carcinogenesis. CBX7 loss of heterozygosity occurred in 36.8% of PTC and in 68.7% of ATC. Restoration of CBX7 expression in thyroid cancer cells reduced growth rate, with a retention in the G(1) phase of the cell cycle, suggesting that CBX7 can contribute to the proliferation of the transformed thyroid cells.

In contrast to other type 2C phosphatases, the cellular role of this isoform is poorly understood. We present here a comprehensive characterization of this gene product. Cells lacking Ptc6 are sensitive to zinc ions, and somewhat tolerant to cell-wall damaging agents and to Li(+). Ptc6 mutants are sensitive to rapamycin, albeit to lesser extent than ptc1 cells. This phenotype is not rescued by overexpression of PTC1 and mutation of ptc6 does not reproduce the characteristic genetic interactions of the ptc1 mutation with components of the TOR pathway, thus suggesting different cellular roles for both isoforms. We show here that the rapamycin-sensitive phenotype of ptc6 cells is unrelated to the reported role of Pt6 in controlling pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. Lack of Ptc6 results in substantial attenuation of the transcriptional response to rapamycin, particularly in the subset of repressed genes encoding ribosomal proteins or involved in rRNA processing. In contrast, repressed genes involved in translation are Ptc6-independent. These effects cannot be attributed to the regulation of the Sch9 kinase, but they could involve modulation of the binding of the Ifh1 co-activator to specific gene promoters.",

We examined the prognostic significance of the tumor size (T), extrathyroid extension (Ex), age 55 years or older (Age), male gender (Gender), clinical node metastasis (N), and extranodal tumor extension (LN-Ex) for each outcome on multivariate analysis. Age, Gender, T > 2 cm, N, and Ex were independent predictors of lymph node recurrence. Age, Ex, T > 2 cm, and N were independent prognostic factors for lung recurrence. Ex, T > 4 cm, and N independently predicted bone recurrence. Of these, N ≥ 3 cm had the strongest prognostic value for lymph node, lung, and bone recurrences. In contrast, Age was the strongest predictor for carcinoma death. LN-Ex also had a prognostic value for carcinoma death, although it was not a predictor of carcinoma recurrence. Ex, N ≥ 3 cm, and T > 2 cm also had a prognostic impact on carcinoma death.;Large lymph node metastasis showed a strong prognostic impact on carcinoma recurrence not only to the lymph nodes but also to the lung and bone, and carcinoma death. Extrathyroid extension also independently predicted these recurrences and carcinoma death, although hazard ratios were lower than for large node metastasis. Age 55 years or older, in contrast, was the strongest predictor of carcinoma death. Extranodal tumor extension did not independently affect recurrence, but it had prognostic significance for carcinoma death. These findings suggest that recurring PTC lesions of older patients and/or extranodal tumor extensions are difficult to control and very progressive.",

To help resolve this issue, we assessed methylation status using two different techniques in papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) and follicular adenomas (FA) and carcinomas (FTC), comparing adjacent non-neoplastic thyroid tissue.;A series of 15 FA, 18 FTC and 17 PTC were assessed by: (1) measurement of methylation levels of long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE-1) using a combined bisulfite restriction analysis polymerase chain reaction protocol and (2) immunostaining with an anti-5-methylcytidine antibody that detects methylated DNA regardless of the DNA sequence. Immunostaining was scored by image analysis.;Methylation levels of LINE-1 in FA, FTC and PTC were not significantly different from adjacent normal tissue. There was no significant difference in methylation levels of LINE-1 between FA, FTC and PTC (p = 0.44). By immunohistochemical staining for methylation, the 5-methylcytidine score was significantly higher in tumours than in normal tissue counterparts, for FA (p < 0.001), FTC (p = 0.04) and PTC (p = 0.02). PTC showed the highest 5-methylcytidine expression amongst all tumours which was significantly different from FTC (p = 0.015), but not FA (p = 0.09). There was no correlation in methylation level between LINE-1 and 5-methylcytidine scores for each group and overall.;Well-differentiated thyroid neoplasms (FA, FTC and PTC) were not found by two independent methods to undergo global hypomethylation as part of an oncogenic sequence from normal tissue to carcinoma. Instead, hypermethylation was detected in all types of tumours, implying that this epigenetic event may contribute to oncogenic development of thyroid neoplasms (both benign and malignant).",

We identified microsomal prostaglandin E2 synthase-1 (mPGES-1) as a RET/PTC-inducible gene through subtraction hybridization cloning and expression profiling with custom microarrays. The inducible prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) biosynthetic enzymes cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and mPGES-1 are up-regulated in many cancers. COX-2 is overexpressed in thyroid malignancies compared with benign nodules and normal thyroid tissues. Eicosanoids may promote tumorigenesis through effects on tumor cell growth, immune surveillance, and angiogenesis. Conditional RET/PTC1 or RET/PTC3 expression in PCCL3 thyroid cells markedly induced mPGES-1 and COX-2. PGE2 was the principal prostanoid and up-regulated (by approximately 60-fold), whereas hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid metabolites were decreased, consistent with shunting of prostanoid biosynthesis toward PGE2 by coactivation of the two enzymes. RET/PTC activated mPGES-1 gene transcription. Based on experiments with kinase inhibitors, with PCCL3 cell lines with doxycycline-inducible expression of RET/PTC mutants with substitutions of critical tyrosine residues in the kinase domain, and lines with inducible expression of activated mutants of H-RAS and MEK1, RET/PTC was found to regulate mPGES-1 through Shc-RAS-MEK-ERK. These data show a direct relationship between activation of a tyrosine kinase receptor oncogene and regulation of PGE2 biosynthesis. As enzymes involved in prostanoid biosynthesis can be targeted with pharmacological inhibitors, these findings may have therapeutic implications.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential applicability of one of the MCM proteins, MCM3, as a proliferation marker in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) with correlation to clinicopathological parameters. We performed the immunohistochemical analysis for MCM3 and Ki-67 in 60 cases of PTC and Western blot analysis for MCM3 expression in 6 PTCs and normal thyroid tissues. The comparison of MCM3 labeling index (LI) to tumor size (P=0.031) and extrathyroidal extension (P=0.037) was statistically significant while that of Ki-67 LI to them was not. Moreover, a significant association was not observed between MCM3 and Ki-67, but the MCM3 LI was considerably higher. Western blot analyses revealed that the MCM3 protein expression levels were overexpressed in all PTCs. On the contrary, the levels of MCM3 were very low or absent in all normal thyroid tissues.

Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) was consistently positive on the apical membrane of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC), was weakly expressed in follicular carcinomas (FC) and resulted negative in normal thyrocytes and in benign conditions. The 3-D microscopy model showed that the WGA staining pattern in light microscopy corresponds to a continuous layer on the luminal surface of both papillary and tubular structures of PTC cells. The other lectins under evaluation did not provide any significant result. In conclusion, in PTC the apical border of thyrocytes showed a strong, specific and consistent staining with WGA.

Even though several genetic lesions have been already described in human thyroid cancer, particularly in the papillary histotype, the mechanisms underlying the development of these neoplasias are still far from being completely elucidated. Some years ago, several studies were undertaken to analyze the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) in thyroid carcinoma to evaluate a possible role of their deregulation in the process of carcinogenesis. These studies showed an aberrant microRNA expression profile that distinguishes unequivocally among PTC, ATC, and normal thyroid tissue.

Papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) and follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTC) are well-differentiated thyroid cancers (WDTC) accounting for 95% of all thyroid cancer cases, with survival rates of almost 100% when diagnosed early. Since PTC and FTC have different modes of metastasis, they require different treatment strategies. Standard diagnosis by fine needle aspiration with cytopathological examination can be inaccurate in approximately 10-30% of all cases and difficult to definitively classify as WDTC. Currently, there is no single or panel of biomarkers available for thyroid cancer diagnosis and classification. This study identified novel biomarkers for thyroid cancer diagnosis and classification using proteomics, which may be translated into a biomarker panel for clinical application. Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry were used to identify potential biomarkers in papillary and follicular thyroid carcinoma cell lines, and the biomarkers were validated in five PTC and five FTC tissues, with their adjacent normal tissues from Thai patients. Eight biomarkers could distinguish PTC from normal tissues, namely enolase 1, triose phosphate isomerase, cathepsin D, annexin A2, cofilin 1, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), copine 1 and heat shock protein 27 kDa (HSP27). These biomarkers can also discriminate FTC from normal tissues, except for annexin A2. On the contrary, annexin A2, cofilin 1, PCNA and HSP27 can be used to classify the types of WDTC. These findings have potential for use as a novel multi-marker panel for more accurate diagnosis and classification to better guide physicians on thyroid cancer treatment. Moreover, our results suggest the involvement of proteins in cell growth and proliferation, and the p53 pathway in the carcinogenesis of WDTC, which may lead to targeted therapy for thyroid cancer.",

Medulloblastoma and RMS are also present in the murine model for Ptch1 deficiency. Tumours in heterozygous Ptch1(neo67/+) mice consistently exhibit elevated transcript levels of the proto-oncogene Gli1, of Ptch1 itself, and of the insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2). The present study has investigated additional molecular changes in RMSs of Ptch1 mutant mice by means of microarray analysis and protein expression analysis. The data show activation of the cell survival-promoting Akt/protein kinase B (Pkb). Furthermore, RMSs express increased levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and of genes and proteins known to inhibit cell proliferation, including Gadd45a and p27kip1. Taken together, the data suggest that the formation of RMSs in Ptch1 mutants is associated with the ability of tumour cells to resist apoptosis.",

PTC metastases, although rare, most frequently occur in the lungs and bone. Therefore, differentiating thyroid etiology of malignant effusions from other sites becomes clinically significant in patient management. This study examines morphologic and immunocytochemical findings in 5 cases of malignant effusions with PTC involvement.;The electronic database at the University of Michigan was searched from January 1, 1995 to December 31, 2014 for malignant pleural effusions with PTC involvement. Clinicopathologic data were obtained from electronic medical records. Cytologic slides were reviewed.;Five cases of malignant effusions due to PTC were identified. Characteristic cytologic features of PTC, including ovoid nuclei, irregular nuclear contours, and psammomatous calcifications, were seen. However, the predominant cytologic feature observed was moderate amounts of delicate to vacuolated cytoplasm within the tumor cells. A review of immunocytochemistry demonstrated that all 5 cases showed patchy to diffuse TTF-1 positivity and diffuse positivity for Pax-8. Thyroglobulin only showed focal to patchy positivity in 3 of 5 cases.;Given the morphologic features found in our case series, an immunocytochemical workup for the evaluation of involvement of an effusion by a thyroid primary is crucial for accurate diagnosis and appropriate clinical treatment.",

In adults it represents about 20% of PTCs, featuring a high-risk neoplasm, with a 4-fold risk of relapse and a 20-fold relapse-related risk of death. Out of 42 cases of pediatric PTCs, we found 3 cases of PTC-TC (7%) with clinical data at onset and follow-up up to June 2014. They were 3 females aged 13, 15, and 15 years. Local extrathyroid extension was present in 2 cases. Neither nodal nor distant metastases were found. Two patients underwent hemithyroidectomy and 1 patient a total thyroidectomy, followed in all cases by life-long suppressive hormonal therapy. On follow-up, the patients were alive and well after 29, 24, and 29 years, respectively. The rarity of PTC-TC in children was confirmed. The behavior was indolent after a median follow-up of about 29 years, following treatment with hemithyroidectomy in 2 cases and controlled by suppressive hormonal therapy. The results of this series, albeit small, suggest that TC morphology in PTC does not carry the same negative prognostic significance in children as it does in adults. A conservative approach should therefore be considered for these 'pediatric type' cases of this tumor type. ",

Taken together, these data provide new evidence of a novel role for uPAR induction (as a consequence of constitutive ERK1/2 activation) as a central component in PTC pathogenesis, and highlight the potential of uPAR as a therapeutic target.",

Recent studies have suggested that the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is necessary for tumor progression and metastases. Little is known concerning the role of Twist1 and EMT in thyroid cancer. In the present work, the expression levels of Twist1 and one marker of EMT, vimentin, were measured in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The results showed Twist1 expression to be correlated only with cancer lymph node metastases (P = 0.004) and not with other clinicopathological indicators. Moreover, Twist1 expression was positively correlated with the expression of vimentin (r = 0.408, P = 0.003). In vitro studies further indicated that reducing Twist1 expression using short hairpin RNA against Twist1 can decrease the invasive and metastatic properties of PTC cells and that the down-regulation of Twist1 can reverse EMT by increasing the expression of E-cadherin and down-regulating the expression of vimentin in the PTC cell line IHH-4. To investigate the effects on Twist1, the PTC cell lines TPC-1 and BCPAP were treated with TNF-α, resulting in Twist1 up-regulation that was dependent on NF-κB activation. After the inhibition of NF-κB activity with Bay11-7082, the Twist1 mRNA and protein levels could not be increased. The decline in the Twist1 mRNA and protein levels rendered the cancer cells less invasive. Thus, we conclude that Twist1 plays an important role in the EMT of PTC via the NF-κB pathway.",

Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections were prepared for immunohistochemical staining of the NIS protein and semi-quantitative analysis. The NIS protein was expressed in the basolateral membrane of the normal epithelium, while PTC and nodular goiter cells expressed NIS in the cytoplasm and basolateral membrane. The expression levels of the NIS protein were higher in the adjacent normal tissues compared with those of the surrounding nodular goiter tissues (P=0.002) and expression levels of the NIS protein were higher in PTC tissues compared with the surrounding nodular goiter tissues (P=0.008).

Malignant tumors maintain immortality by expressing a specific DNA repair enzyme, telomerase, that replaces this DNA. We hypothesized that tumors which express telomerase would have the highest recurrence risk and we tested this by determining telomerase expression in 27 papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC), 5 follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTC) and 13 benign thyroid lesions from children and adolescents. Patients were 6-21 yr of age (mean+/-SE=16.6+/-4.1 yr) and followed from 0-14.1 yr (mean+/-SE=4.71+/-3.5 yr). Original tumors were sectioned, and immunostained for telomerase. Telomerase-specific staining was determined by two independent, blind examiners and graded from absent (Grade 0) to intense (Grade 3). Telomerase was detected in a similar majority of benign (11/13, 85%) and malignant tumors (24/32, 75%). However, the intensity of telomerase expression was greater among FTC (mean+/-SE=2.4+/-0.5 relative intensity) followed by PTC (mean+/-SE=1.9+/-1.0 relative intensity) and benign tumors (mean+/-SE=1.8+/-1.0 relative intensity). Autoimmune lesions had lower telomerase expression (mean+/-SE=1.25+/-0.5 relative intensity) compared to FTC (p=0.01), PTC (p=0.06) and benign lesions (p=0.15). Among PTC, 19 (70%) expressed telomerase, and 8 (30%) did not. Direct invasion (no.=4, 21%), distant metastasis (no.=2, 10%) and recurrence (no.=7, 37%) developed exclusively in PTC that expressed telomerase (p=0.02). Disease-free survival was also shorter for PTC that expressed telomerase (p=0.06). Recurrence developed in 1/2 (50%) FTC that expressed telomerase.

MTT and migration assay were used to evaluate the effects of PDE5 inhibitors on proliferation and migration of TPC-1, BCPAP, and 8505C cells. In a first series of 36 PTCs, we found higher expression levels of PDE5A in tumors versus non-tumor (normal) tissues. PTCs with BRAF mutation showed higher levels of mRNA compared with those without mutation. No significant differences were detected between subgroups with low and intermediate ATA risk. Upregulation of PDE5 was also detected in tumor tissue proteins. Similar results were obtained analyzing the second cohort of 50 PTCs. Moreover, all tumor tissues with high PDE5 levels showed reduction of Thyroglobulin, TSH receptor, Thyroperoxidase, and NIS transcripts. In thyroid cancer cells in vitro, sildenafil and tadalafil determined a reduction of proliferation and cellular migration. Our findings demonstrate for the first time an overexpression of PDE5 in PTCs, and the ability of PDE5 inhibitors to block the proliferation of thyroid cancer cells in culture, therefore, suggesting that specific inhibition of PDE5 may be proposed for the treatment of these tumors.

These discoveries reduced the fraction of PTC cases with unknown oncogenic driver from 25% to 3.5%. Combined analyses of genomic variants, gene expression, and methylation demonstrated that different driver groups lead to different pathologies with distinct signaling and differentiation characteristics. Similarly, we identified distinct molecular subgroups of BRAF-mutant tumors, and multidimensional analyses highlighted a potential involvement of oncomiRs in less-differentiated subgroups. Our results propose a reclassification of thyroid cancers into molecular subtypes that better reflect their underlying signaling and differentiation properties, which has the potential to improve their pathological classification and better inform the management of the disease.

Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signalling plays an important role in vertebrate development, including somitogenesis and thus ventral body wall formation. Patched (PTCH), a cell membrane receptor for SHH, is expressed in somites and Patched knockout mice display somite dysfunction. Another transmembrane receptor, Smoothened (SMO), is also expressed in somites and transduces the SHH signal regulated by PTCH. We designed this study to test the hypothesis that SHH signalling is downregulated during the critical period of early embryogenesis in the Cd-induced omphalocele chick model.;After 60 h of incubation, chicks were exposed to either chick saline or 50 μL of 50 μM cadmium acetate and divided into two groups: control and Cd (n = 24 for each group). Chicks were harvested 1, 4, and 8 h post-treatment. Real-time RT-PCR was performed to evaluate the relative mRNA expression level of SHH, PTCH and SMO.

Immunohistochemistry revealed that the intensity of SHH, PTCH and SMO was markedly diminished at 4 h in Cd-treated embryos compared to controls.;Disturbance of the SHH signalling pathway as evidenced by SHH, PTCH and SMO downregulation during the narrow window of early embryogenesis may result in somite maldevelopment, contributing to the omphalocele phenotype in the Cd chick model.",

        "Doc_abstract":"TERT is the catalytic subunit of telomerase which plays an essential part in cellular immortality by maintaining telomere integrity. TERT is commonly over-expressed in human malignancies, indicating its key role in cell transformation. The chromosome 5p15.33 TERT-CLPTM1L region has been associated with susceptibility of multiple cancers via a genome-wide association approach. However, the involvement of this locus in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) etiology is still largely unknown. We analyzed 15 haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (htSNPs) of the TERT-CLPTM1L region in a two stage case-control design. After genotyping 2300 PTC patients and frequency-matched 2300 unaffected controls, we found that TERT rs2736100 genetic variant is significantly associated with elevated PTC risk. Ex vivo reporter gene assays indicated that the PTC susceptibility rs2736100 polymorphism locating in a potential TERT intronic enhancer has a genotype-specific effect on TERT expression. Correlations between rs2736100 genotypes and tissue-specific TERT expression supported the regulatory function of this genetic variant in vivo. Our data demonstrated that the functional TERT rs2736100 SNP as a novel genetic component of PTC etiology. This study, together with recent studies in other cancers, unequivocally establishes an essential role of TERT in cancers. ",

We evaluated the relationship between BRAF((V600E)) and tumor, host, and environmental factors in PTCs from all geographical areas of Sicily. By PCR, BRAF((V600E)) was investigated in a series of 323 PTCs diagnosed in 2002-2005. The correlation between clinicopathological tumor, host, and environmental characteristics and the presence of BRAF((V600E)) were evaluated by both univariate and multivariate analyses. BRAF((V600E)) was found in 38.6% PTCs, with a 52% frequency in the classical PTCs and 26.4% in the tall cell variant. Univariate analysis indicated that BRAF((V600E)) was associated with greater tumor size (P=0.0048), extra-thyroid invasion (P<0.0001), and cervical lymph nodal metastases (P=0.0001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed that BRAF((V600E)) was an independent predictor of extra-thyroid invasion (P=0.0001) and cervical lymph nodal metastasis (P=0.0005). The association between BRAF((V600E)) and extra-thyroid invasion was also found in micro-PTCs (P=0.006). In 60 classical PTCs, BRAF((V600E)) was positively correlated with matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression (P=0.0047), suggesting a possible mechanism for BRAF((V600E)) effect on PTC invasiveness. No association was found between BRAF((V600E)) and patient age, gender, or iodine intake. In contrast, a strong association was found with residency in Eastern Sicily (P<0.0001 compared with Western Sicily).

To this group, carcinomas measuring less than 1 cm (the so-called microcarcinomas) as well as those above 1 cm belong. Analyzing a case series from our own experience, this paper focuses on the current pre-operative diagnostic challenges that can lead to PTC incidental discovery. For this retrospective study, 287 patients with a PTC diagnosis were selected. For each, the following variables were analysed: sex, age, ultrasound (US) appearance, number of thyroid nodules, PTC size, PTC variants and presence of other associated pathology. Pre-operative fine needle aspiration (FNA) results were classified according to the five-tiered SIAPEC system. For 281 patients, the US-guided FNA results were available. Cytohistological correlation was evaluated in terms of FNA sensitivity and false negative rate. An incidental PTC was found in 45.2 % of patients. The majority of these were due to unsuccessful US detection of malignant nodules (103 cases); incorrect cytological diagnosis was responsible for the other 24 cases. The most powerful clinical confounding factors were: multinodular background versus single nodule presentations (p < 0.001) and histotype (follicular vs conventional variant, p < 0.05). Of course, tumour size remains a strongly influential feature on pre-operative diagnosis, with greater difficulties arising for carcinomas <5 mm. Moreover, FNA sensitivity was lower also in large PTCs (>2 cm) due to tumour heterogeneity. Although with limitations related to the tumour's intrinsic features and the thyroid background, US-guided FNA, especially if performed by a dedicated multidisciplinary team, is a powerful diagnostic tool for detecting malignant thyroid nodules. To the state of the art, we propose a practical clinical-pathological cut-off for this procedure, setting it at 5 mm.",

Kap1542 and Kap637 had low activity and no androgen induction; Kap224 had a basal activity that was 4- to 5-fold higher than that of Kap1542, but was only slightly induced by DHT. Kap147 had a basal activity that was 2- to 3-fold higher than that of Kap1542 and was induced by DHT 4- to 6-fold. Kap77 abolished basal promoter activity but was still induced by DHT. Results showed that, in vitro, Kap147 was a minimal androgen-regulated promoter. Transient transfection in different cells demonstrated that Kap147 specifically initiated reporter gene expression in PTCs. Sequence analysis revealed two potential AREs located at positions -124 and -39 of Kap147. Mutational assays showed that only the ARE at -124 was involved in androgen response in OK cells.

        "Doc_abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to review the features and behaviour of the odontogenic keratocyst (OKC), now officially known as the keratocystic odontogenic tumour (KCOT); to analyze a series of histologically confirmed KCOT cases; and to review and discuss the redesignation of KCOT and the implications for treatment. Redesignation of the OKC as the KCOT by the World Health Organization (WHO) is based on the well-known aggressive behaviour of this lesion, its histology and new information regarding its genetics. Abnormal function of PTCH, a tumour suppressor gene, is noted to be involved in both nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome and sporadic KCOTs. Normally, PTCH forms a receptor complex with the oncogene SMO for the SHH ligand. PTCH binding to SMO inhibits growth-signal transduction. SHH binding to PTCH releases inhibition of the signal transduction pathway. If normal functioning of PTCH is lost, the proliferation-stimulating effects of SMO are permitted to predominate. A review of the literature was conducted and results were tabulated to determine whether treatment modality is related to recurrence rate. More aggressive treatment - resection or enucleation supplemented with Carnoy\"s solution with or without peripheral ostectomy - results in a lower recurrence rate than enucleation alone or marsupialization. Notably, the recurrence rate after marsupialization followed by enucleation is not significantly higher than that following the so-called aggressive modalities. Our case series consists of 21 patients treated for KCOTs. Results were organized to demonstrate recurrence as it relates to size of lesion and time since treatment and incidence as it relates to patient age and location in the jaws. In our series, the average KCOT surface area measured radiographically was 14 cm<sup>2</sup>. Most lesions were within the 0-15 cm<sup>2</sup> range and lesions in this range resulted in the greatest number and proportion of recurrences. The recurrence rate of 29% in our case series was consistent with previously established data; all recurrences occurred within 2 years post-intervention. The incidence of primary lesions was highest in the age group 70-79 years; most lesions occurred in the posterior mandible. WHO\"s reclassification of the OKC as the KCOT based on behaviour, histology and genetics underscores the aggressive nature of the lesion and should motivate clinicians to manage the disease in a correspondingly aggressive manner. The most effective interventions for the KCOT are either enucleation with Carnoy\"s solution, or marsupialization with later cystectomy. Future treatment may involve molecular-based modalities, which may reduce or eliminate the need for aggressive surgical management.",

TMZ resistant GBM cells have increased PTCH1 mRNA and reduced protein. Knockdown of Dicer, a Type III RNAase, indicated that miRNAs can explain the decreased PTCH1 in TMZ resistant cells. Computational studies, real-time PCR, reporter gene studies, western blots, target protector oligos and ectopic expression identified miR-9 as the target of PTCH1 in resistant GBM cells with concomitant activation of SHH signaling. MiR-9 mediated increases in the drug efflux transporters, MDR1 and ABCG2. MiR-9 was increased in the tissues from GBM patients and in an early passage GBM cell line from a patient with recurrent GBM but not from a naïve patient. Pharmacological inhibition of SHH signaling sensitized the GBM cells to TMZ. Taken together, miR-9 targets PTCH1 in GBM cells by a SHH-independent method in GBM cells for TMZ resistance. The identified pathways could lead to new strategies to target GBM with combinations of drugs. ",

This molecule could modulate cellular adhesion and thereby influence tumor invasion and metastasis. Little is known of MUC1 gene expression in thyroid tissues. We investigated whether MUC1 mucin gene alteration and/or expression correlated with thyroid tumor progression by studying 21 fresh thyroid tissue specimens comprising 10 macrofollicular adenomas and 11 papillary carcinomas. Normal adjacent tissue from the same patients was also studied. To determine the integrity and expression of the MUC1 mucin gene, a complementary DNA (cDNA) probe was used for Southern blot analysis of DNA and Northern blot analysis of RNA. A detailed immunohistochemical analysis of MUC1 protein expression was performed with DF3 monoclonal antibody, and was compared with other tumor characteristics and clinical manifestations at diagnosis. Of the 14 tumors informative (heterozygous) with the pMUC10 polymorphic probe, 2 (14%) showed loss of heterozygosity (1 adenoma and 1 carcinoma). Overexpression of MUC1 RNA, compared with normal thyroid tissue, was observed in 6 of the 11 papillary carcinomas and in none of the 10 adenomas. Immunostaining of the corresponding formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections detected MUC1 mucin protein at the apical domain of follicular cells. Most of the lining was thin in normal tissue and follicular adenomas, but the protein was more irregularly and less strongly expressed in adenomas. In carcinomas the epithelial mucin produced by the MUC1 gene was present irregularly as a thin and/or thick lining at the apical domain of tumor cells. In addition, 5 of the 6 samples with MUC1 mRNA overexpression showed intracytoplasmic staining. Moreover, intracytoplasmic MUC1 mucin staining was found in 75% of \"high-risk\" papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) (PTC with extrathyroid extension at initial diagnosis and/or lymph node involvement), and in only 28.5% of \"low-risk\" PTC (purely intrathyroidal carcinomas).",

Three main rearranged forms of RET have been described: RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3, which arise from a paracentric inversion of the long arm of chromosome 10, and RET/PTC2, which originates from a 10;17 translocation. We have developed a dual-color FISH approach to detect RET/PTC rearrangements in interphase nuclei of thyroid lesions. By using a pool of three cosmids encompassing the RET chromosome region and a chromosome 10 centromeric probe, we could discriminate between the presence of an inversion (RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3) or a translocation (RET/PTC2). We have investigated a series of thyroid tissue samples from Italian and French patients corresponding to a total of 69 PTCs and 22 benign lesions. Among PTCs, 13 (18.8%) showed a RET rearrangement, and 11 (15.9%) of these carried an inversion (RET/PTC1 or RET/PTC3) in more than 10% of the nuclei examined. Activated forms of RET were also observed in three adenomas. RT-PCR analysis on the same samples confirmed the presence and the type of rearrangement predicted using FISH analysis. An interesting difference in the frequency and type of RET rearrangements was detected between the Italian and the French patients. Furthermore, we identified a putative novel type of rearrangement in at least one PTC sample. Several PTCs carried a significant number of cells characterized by a trisomy or a tetrasomy of chromosome 10. Overall, the FISH approach in interphase nuclei represents a powerful tool for detecting, at the single cell level, RET/PTC rearrangements and other anomalies involving the RET chromosome region.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the low-osmolar CM iopromide and the iso-osmolar CM iodixanol on oxygen consumption (QO2) in freshly isolated proximal tubular cells (PTC) from kidneys ablated from elderly humans undergoing nephrectomy for renal carcinomas and from normoglycemic or streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Materials PTC were isolated from human kidneys, or kidneys of normoglycemic or streptozotocin-diabetic rats. QO2 was measured with Clark-type microelectrodes in a gas-tight chamber with and without each CM (10 mg I/mL medium). L-NAME was used to inhibit nitric oxide (NO) production caused by nitric oxide synthase. Results Both CM reduced QO2 in human PTC (about -35%) which was prevented by L-NAME. PTC from normoglycemic rats were unaffected by iopromide, whereas iodixanol decreased QO2 (-34%). Both CM decreased QO2 in PTC from diabetic rats (-38% and -36%, respectively). L-NAME only prevented the effect of iopromide in the diabetic rat PTC. Conclusions These observations demonstrate that CM can induce NO release from isolated PTC in vitro, which affects QO2. Our results suggest that the induction of NO release and subsequent effect on the cellular oxygen metabolism are dependent on several factors, including CM type and pre-existing risk factors for the development of CM-induced nephropathy.

We have developed a simple and rapid reverse transcriptase nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR) method enabling the detection of gene expression from single 5 microns sections of formalin-fixed paraffin wax-embedded archival material. We have applied this approach to detect expression of the RET tyrosine kinase domain, allowing identification of RET activation resulting from any rearrangement, whether characterised or not, or from overexpression. A retrospective study was performed on 22 adult and 21 childhood papillary carcinomas. Thirteen of 22 (59%) adult and 10 of 21 (48%) childhood carcinomas showed evidence of RET activation, demonstrating a major role for the RET oncogene in UK thyroid papillary carcinogenesis. This study also shows a similar frequency of RET activation in both children and adults. The use of a technique that allows reliable amplification of RNA from archival material, using primers chosen in different exons so that amplified products are readily distinguished from genomic DNA, will allow correlation of translocations and chromosomal rearrangements with a variety of specific tumour types.",

The prevalence of these mutations in other types of thyroid cancers and benign nodules is unknown. In this study, we analyzed the occurrence of EIF1AX mutations in exons 2, 5, and 6 of the gene in a series of 266 thyroid tumors and hyperplastic nodules by either Sanger or next-generation sequencing (ThyroSeq v.2). In addition, 647 thyroid fine-needle aspiration (FNA) samples with indeterminate cytology were analyzed. Using surgically removed samples, EIF1AX mutations were detected in 3/86 (2.3%) PTC, 1/4 (25%) ATC, 0/53 follicular carcinomas, 0/12 medullary carcinomas, 2/27 (7.4%) follicular adenomas, and 1/80 (1.3%) hyperplastic nodules. Among five mutation-positive FNA samples with surgical follow-up, one nodule was PTC and others were benign follicular adenomas or hyperplastic nodules. Overall, among 33 mutations identified, A113_splice mutation at the intron 5/exon 6 splice site of EIF1AX was the most common. All four carcinomas harbored A113_splice mutation and three of them had one or more coexisting mutations, typically RAS All PTC carrying EIF1AX mutations were encapsulated follicular variants. In summary, this study shows that EIF1AX mutations occur not only in thyroid carcinomas, but also in benign nodules. The most common mutation hotspot is the A113_splice, followed by a cluster of mutations in exon 2. When found in thyroid FNA samples, EIF1AX mutations confer ~20% risk of cancer; the risk is likely to be higher in nodules carrying a A113_splice mutation and when EIF1AX coexists with RAS mutations.

After identification with FGFR-3 and Col II, the cells were incubated with different concentrations of cyclopamine (cyclo), the specific inhibitor of Ihh signaling pathway. The morphologic changes of the cells were observed under the inverted phase contrast microscope. The mRNA expression levels of Ihh, parathyroid hormonerelated peptide (PTHrP), protein Patched (Ptch), Bcl-2 and p21 were detected by RT-PCR. The protein expression levels of Ihh and Ptch were measured by Western blot. MTT assay was used to examine the effects of cyclo on proliferation of PSCs. Apoptosis rate of PSCs was examined by Annexin V/PI assay of flow cytometric analyses. After PSCs were incubated with cyclo, obvious morphologic changes were observed as compared with the control group. The mRNA expression levels of PTHrP, Ptch and Bcl-2 were decreased to varying degrees in a cyclo dose-dependent manner. However, the expression levels of Ihh and p21 mRNA were increased. The protein expression of Ptch and Ihh had the same change as the mRNA expression. Meanwhile, cyclo could obviously inhibit the proliferation and promote the apoptosis of PSCs. The results indicated that Ihh signaling pathway plays an important role in regulating the proliferation and apoptosis of PSCs, which is probably mediated by Bcl-2 and p21.",

However, it is essential for a B lymphocyte to produce only one kind of antibody and therefore to ensure that the heavy and light chain polypeptides are expressed exclusively from the corresponding functional alleles, whereas no protein is made from the nonproductively rearranged alleles. At the post-transcriptional level, a well-studied mRNA quality control mechanism, termed nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), recognizes and degrades PTC-containing mRNAs in a translation-dependent manner. In addition, transcriptional silencing of PTC-containing Ig-mu and Ig-gamma heavy chain reporter genes was observed in HeLa cells. To investigate the silencing of nonproductively rearranged Ig genes in a more physiological context, we analyzed a monoclonal line of immortalized murine pro-B cells harboring one productively (PTC-) and one nonproductively (PTC+) rearranged Ig-mu heavy chain allele. We show that the steady-state abundance of PTC+ mRNA was approximately 40-fold lower when compared to that of the PTC- mRNA. However, both the PTC+ and PTC- allele seemed to be equally well transcribed since the abundances of PTC+ and PTC- pre-mRNA were very similar and chromatin immunoprecipitations revealed comparable occupancy of RNA polymerase II and acetylated histone H3 on both alleles. Altogether, we found no evidence for transcriptional silencing of the PTC+ allele in this pro-B cell line; hence, the efficient down-regulation of the PTC+ Ig-mu mRNA results entirely from NMD.",

The requirement for BRAF in RET/PTC-mediated MAPK activation and gene expression has not been tested functionally. There are three RAF isoforms: ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF. Compared with the others, ARAF is a much weaker stimulator of MAPK. To determine the key RAF isoform mediating RET/PTC-induced ERK phosphorylation, we stably transfected doxycycline-inducible RET/PTC3-expressing thyroid PCCL3 cells with small interfering RNA vectors to induce selective knockdown of BRAF or CRAF. Conditional RET/PTC3 expression induced comparable ERK phosphorylation in CRAF knockdown and control cells but negligible ERK phosphorylation in BRAF knockdown cells. Selective knockdown of BRAF prevented RET/PTC-dependent down-regulation of the sodium iodide symporter, a gene that confers key biological effects of RET/PTC in PTCs. Moreover, microarray analysis revealed numerous RET/PTC-regulated genes showing requirement of BRAF for appropriate expression. These data indicate that BRAF is required for RET/PTC-induced MAPK activation in thyroid cells and support the notion that BRAF inactivation may be an attractive target for PTCs.",

Activation of GLIs must be tightly regulated as they modulate target genes which control tissue patterning, stem cell maintenance, and differentiation during development. However, dysregulation or mutations in HH signaling leads to genomic instability (GI) and various cancers, for example, germline mutation in PTCH1 lead to Gorlin syndrome, a condition where patients develop numerous basal cell carcinomas and rarely rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). Activating mutations in SMO have also been recognized in sporadic cases of medulloblastoma and SMO is overexpressed in many other cancers. Recently, studies in several human cancers have shown that GLI1 expression is independent from HH ligand and canonical intracellular signaling through PTCH and SMO. In fact, this aberrantly regulated GLI1 has been linked to several non-canonical oncogenic growth signals such as Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), avian myelocytomatosis virus oncogene cellular homolog (C-MYC), transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), wingless-type MMTV integration site family (WNT) and β-catenin. Recent studies from our lab and other independent studies demonstrate that aberrantly expressed GLI1 influences the integrity of several DNA damage response and repair signals, and if altered, these networks can contribute to GI and impact tumor response to chemo- and radiation therapies. Furthermore, the ineffectiveness of SMO inhibitors in clinical studies argues for the development of GLI1-specific inhibitors in order to develop effective therapeutic modalities to treat these tumors. In this review, we focus on summarizing current understanding of the molecular, biochemical and cellular basis for aberrant GLI1 expression and discuss GLI1-mediated HH signaling on DNA damage responses, carcinogenesis and chemoresistance.

However, its diagnostic accuracy is limited by the narrow choice of cytopathologic markers indicative of invasive/metastatic powers of a tumor. The aim of this study was to identify features that may serve as such indicators. We have examined FNA smears of 50 histologically proven papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) cases applying computer-assisted morphometry to assess patterns formed by PTC cells. Cytokeratine (CK) 8 immunocytochemistry was used to verify the epithelial origin of cells under study. All analyzed smears contained blood, histiocyte-like cells and CK8-positive follicular cells occurring both as single cells and in monolayer cell sheets. In 60% of cases we revealed cell sheets displaying two distinct cell patterns. The first one (pattern R) consisted of moderately pleomorphic, rather regularly arranged cells having an amphophilic cytoplasm. The second one (pattern I) was formed by highly pleomorphic cells with a basophilic cytoplasm. Patterns R and I were clearly different in cell size and shape as well as in nuclear size and shape. These patterns were never observed within the same cell sheet indicating that they may be formed by different subclones of tumor cells. Thus, it can be concluded that PTC frequently displays two definitely different cell patterns. We think that these patterns have a potential to serve as indicators for early events of an invasive/metastatic process. It remains to be seen whether the simultaneous occurrence of these patterns is a PTC-specific feature.",

Whenever there was a dissociation between the expression of type 1 and type 2 Lewis antigens, MUC1 appeared closely related to type 1 and independent from type 2 histo-blood group antigens. We conclude that MUC1 plays a pivotal, though not exclusive, role in the glycosylation features of well differentiated thyroid carcinomas.

On the one side, there are occult papillary carcinomas (PTC), slow growing and clinically silent, and on the other side, rapidly growing anaplastic carcinomas (ATC), which are among the most lethal human neoplasms. We have analysed the microRNA (miR) profile of ATC in comparison to the normal thyroid using a microarray (miRNACHIP microarray). By this approach, we found an aberrant miR expression profile that clearly differentiates ATC from normal thyroid tissues and from PTC analysed in previous studies. In particular, a significant decrease in miR-30d, miR-125b, miR-26a and miR-30a-5p was detected in ATC in comparison to normal thyroid tissue. These results were further confirmed by northern blots, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analyses and in situ hybridization. The overexpression of these four miRs in two human ATC-derived cell lines suggests a critical role of miR-125b and miR-26a downregulation in thyroid carcinogenesis, since a cell growth inhibition was achieved. Conversely, no effect on cell growth was observed after the overexpression of miR-30d and miR-30a-5p in the same cells. In conclusion, these data indicate a miR signature associated with ATC and suggest the miR deregulation as an important event in thyroid cell transformation.",

That said, high-resolution ultrasound provides a safe and affordable way of identifying and characterizing thyroid nodules and guiding percutaneous biopsies. Although no single sonographic feature is pathognomonic for PTC, certain features should raise suspicion and the combination of several features may be even more suggestive. In this pictorial essay, we describe the high-resolution sonographic features of pathologically proven PTCs. The nodule number, echo texture, internal architecture, calcifications, margins, contours, vascularity, and lymph nodes are considered.

Twenty benign thyroid lesions and 10 PTC served as control cases. A high (47%) prevalence of RET/PTC rearrangements was found in HTT. By contrast, neither B-raf nor N-ras mutations were found in HTT. These findings suggest that, although RET/PTC, N-ras, and B-raf proteins may act along the same signalling cascade, the biological and morphological outcome of their oncogenic activation is not completely overlapping.

Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) has been implicated in tumor cell apoptosis, transformation, invasion, and metastasis; however, its role in thyroid nodules is undetermined. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between expression of IGF-1 and thyroid nodule, and evaluate the role of IGF-1 in differential diagnosis and pathogenetic function of benign and malignant thyroid nodules. Sixty-two paraffin-embedded thyroid tissues from patients with thyroid nodules were selected, including 18 follicular adenomas (FA), 17 nodular goiters, 13 papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC), 2 follicular thyroid carcinomas, and 12 normal controls. IGF-1 and IGF-1R protein and mRNA expression was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), respectively. Grouping comparisons were employed among the above groups based on the clinical and pathological subtypes. IGF-1 and IGF-1R expression was significantly higher in FA, nodular goiters, and PTC than that in the controls (all P < 0.01). Similarly, IGF-1 mRNA expression was also significantly higher in FA (P < 0.05), nodular goiters (P < 0.01), and PTC (P < 0.01) compared with the controls. IGF-1R mRNA expression was also significantly higher in FA, nodular goiters, and PTC (all P < 0.01) compared with the controls. Compared with FA and nodular goiters, PTC showed significantly higher IGF-1 and IGF-1R protein (P < 0.01, P < 0.05, respectively) and mRNA expression (P < 0.01, P < 0.05, respectively). IGF-1 probably plays an important role in the genesis and development of certain solid cold thyroid nodules, including PTC, nodular goiters, and FA. Detection of IGF-1 and IGF-1R expression in thyroid tissues by IHC or qRT-PCR is hard to distinguish malignant from benign lesions.",

This mutation appears to be particularly prevalent in PTC with a predominantly papillary architecture. Another BRAF mutation (K601E) was detected in a follicular adenoma and in some cases of the follicular variant of PTC. The few studies on record provided controversial data on the relationship between the occurrence of BRAF mutations and clinicopathologic parameters such as gender, age and tumour staging. In an attempt to clarify such controversies we decided to enlarge our previous series to 315 tumours or tumour-like lesions diagnosed in 280 patients, including a thorough analysis of several clinicopathologic features. The BRAF(V600E) mutation was exclusively detected in PTC with a papillary or mixed follicular/papillary architecture both of the conventional type (46%) and of other histotypes, such as microcarcinoma (43%), Warthin-like PTC (75%) and oncocytic variant of PTC (55%). The BRAF(K601E) mutation was detected in four of the 54 cases of the follicular variant of PTC (7%). The mean age of patients with conventional PTC harbouring BRAF(V600E) (46.7 years) was significantly higher (P<0.0001) than that of patients with conventional PTC without BRAF(V600E) (29.5 years).

The common risk factors of PTC include ionizing radiation, positive family history, and thyroid nodular disease. PTC was identified in Europeans by conducting a genome-wide association study, and a strong association signal with PTC was observed in rs944289 and NKX2-1 (located at the 14q13.3 locus), which was probably the genetic risk factor of PTC. This study aimed to examine the association of this gene with PTC in Chinese. A total of 354 patients with PTC and 360 healthy control subjects from the Han population of Northern China were recruited in the study. These individuals were genotyped to determine rs12589672, rs12894724, rs2076751, and rs944289. The association of rs944289 with PTC was obtained (C vs. T, P = 0.027, OR = 1.264, 95% CI = 1.026 - 1.557; and C/C - C/T vs. T/T, P = 0.034, OR = 1.474, 95% CI = 1.028 - 2.112). Conducting a subgroup analysis, we found a marginal difference in the allele frequency distribution of rs944289 (adjusted P = 0.062) between the patients with PTC and multi-nodular goiter and the control subjects. We also observed an interaction (P = 0.029; OR = 2.578, 95% CI = 1.104 - 6.023) between rs944289 and diabetes in patients with PTC. In conclusion, rs944289 was associated with an increased risk of PTC in the Han population of Northern China, but no clear association was observed in either of the tag single nucleotide polymorphisms of NKX2-1.",

In this study, we highlight the diagnostic and management issues associated with the unintended consequences of ultrasonography (US)-guided FNA.;Fourteen thyroid glands (11 women and 3 men, ages 33-64 years) with vanishing tumors were prospectively identified between 2009 and 2012 upon surgical resection. Cytology and histopathology slides were reviewed, and second opinions were obtained when necessary.;The cytology of the 14 vanishing tumors was suspicious/positive for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) in 5, indeterminate (atypia of unknown significance) in 5, benign in 2, follicular neoplasm in 1, and nondiagnostic in 1 nodule. Upon thyroidectomy, the vanishing tumors ranged in size from 0.4 to 3.5 cm (median 0.7 cm). Microscopically, the nodules showed cystic degeneration, organizing hemorrhage, granulation tissue, fibrosis, and microcalcifications. In seven tumors, a few residual malignant cells (PTC in five) or residual benign follicles (hemorrhagic cyst in two) at the periphery of the vanishing tumors helped with the final diagnosis. The remaining seven tumors were completely replaced by FNA-induced secondary changes, and had the cytology diagnosis of benign in one, follicular neoplasm in one, and suspicious/positive for PTC in five. Of the latter five, two showed additional separate foci of PTC, while three vanishing tumors (0.5, 1.2, and 1.6 cm) had no residual malignant cells and no additional carcinoma leading to a final diagnosis of negative for malignancy.;US-guided FNA may lead to complete obliteration of thyroid nodules, rendering final diagnosis upon thyroidectomy difficult or impossible. In these unusual circumstances, the possibility that the surgical pathology may be nonrepresentative should be considered if the cytologic features on FNA are sufficient by themselves to support a definitive diagnosis of PTC.",

These cells have been found in reactive and neoplastic conditions. Three cases of PTC lymphomas have so far been reported. All of them were complicated by a myelomonocytic leukemia leading to the assumption of a functional relationship between PTC and the myeloid system. The immunologic phenotype of PTC, as revealed on frozen tumor tissue sections, comprised the expression of CD5 (T1), CD4 (T4), and HLA-DR, but not CD8 (T8) and CD2 (T11) and suggested an affiliation to the T cell system. Extending our previous report on one of these cases we here present the first study on the immunological marker profile of suspended PTC. The employment of unfractionated or PTC-enriched tumor cell suspensions rendered possible the application of a panel of monoclonal antibodies (moAbs) on both fixed and unfixed cells and enabled us to allocate various markers either to the intracytoplasmic or surface domain of this cell type. Our results suggest that PTC from our case rest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. They express the transferrin receptor, but not the Il-2 receptor (CD25) or the nuclear antigen Ki-67. No T cell antigen was demonstrated on the surface of unfixed suspended PTC. Under these conditions only HLA-DR and a predominantly monocytic antigen (CD36/moAb 5F1) were identified. Fixed cells, however, showed a weak cytoplasmic reactivity for CD5 and two myelomonocytic antigens (CD15/moAb 1G10 and CD14/moAb My4). Our findings do not sustain positive evidence for a T cell nature of PTC. Whether their phenotypical pattern indicates terminal differentiation with concomitant loss of T cell antigens or points to a cytogenetic relationship of PTC to the myeloid system, remains speculative. Until the cytogenesis of PTC is clarified we propose the noncommitted term \"plasmacytoid T-zone cells\" for this elusive cell type.",

Here we applied a rigorous combined approach to assess both the individual and epistatic contributions of genetic factors to PTC susceptibility, based on one of the largest series of thyroid cancer cases described to date. In addition to identifying the involvement of TSHR variation in classic PTC, our pioneer study of epistasis revealed a significant interaction between variants in STK17B and PAX8. The interaction was detected by MD-MBR (p = 0.00010) and confirmed by other methods, and then replicated in a second independent series of patients (MD-MBR p = 0.017). Furthermore, we demonstrated an inverse correlation between expression of PAX8 and STK17B in a set of cell lines derived from human thyroid carcinomas. Overall, our work sheds additional light on the genetic basis of thyroid cancer susceptibility, and suggests a new direction for the exploration of the inherited genetic contribution to disease using association studies.",

These B cells appear to belong to the marginal zone (MZ) and B1 B-cell subsets and provide protection to the blood and lymph, respectively. Some are specific for self-antigens, suggesting that they are selected based on specificity for self but have a protective role against foreign pathogens. One of these specificities is for phosphatidylcholine (PtC). Anti-PtC B cells comprise 5-8% of the B1 repertoire and are protective against bacterial pathogens. In general, they are restricted to the expression of two VH/Vkappa combinations, VH11/Vkappa9 and VH12/Vkappa4/5H. This review focuses on the differentiation of VH12 anti-PtC B cells. They undergo a series of positive selection events beginning at the pre-B-cell stage that enriches for those with a VHCDR3 and L chain required for PtC binding and eliminating the majority of VH12 B cells that lack the ability to bind PtC. Thus, positive selection focuses the VH12 repertoire toward PtC, ensuring that anti-PtC VH12 B cells are a significant component of the B1-cell repertoire in all individuals.",

In light of the new finding that most PTC consist of a mixture of tumor cells with wild-type and mutant BRAF, we examined the associations between the percentage of BRAF(V600E) alleles and both the clinicopathological parameters at time of diagnosis and the disease outcome in a large series of PTCs.;Tumors from 168 patients with PTC were genotyped for BRAF(V600E) using BigDye Terminator sequencing and pyrosequencing, and the clinical parameters were analyzed. The associations between clinicopathological characteristics, including disease recurrence at follow-up (median 5.1 yr) and the percentage of mutant BRAF alleles were assessed.;The observed prevalence of BRAF(V600E) was higher when using pyrosequencing then when using BigDye Terminator sequencing (53.6 vs. 36.9%). In the PTC positive for BRAF(V600E), the percentage of mutant alleles ranged from 5.1 to 44.7% of the total BRAF alleles, with a median of 20.6%. The presence or the percentage of BRAF(V600E) alleles did not correlate significantly with sex, multicentricity, lymph node metastasis, or tumor stage. The percentage of BRAF(V600E) alleles directly correlated with age at diagnosis and tumor volume (R(2) = 0.223, P = 0.039, and R(2) = 0.166, P < 0.001, respectively). The percentage of BRAF(V600E) alleles (P = 0.014), tumor volume (P = 0.012), and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.008) predicted the disease outcome. The odds ratio of recurrence for PTC with BRAF(V600E) alleles of 30% or greater, compared with that for PTC with BRAF(V600E) alleles of less than 30%, was 5.31 (P = 0.002).;A high percentage of BRAF(V600E) alleles defines a PTC molecular subtype and predicts a poorer disease outcome.

Conflicting results are reported regarding the prognostic role of RET/PTC activation.;To investigate the prognostic meaning of RET/PTC rearrangement on the long term outcome of PTC.;We have studied the expression of the RET encoded protein in 127 papillary thyroid carcinomas by immunohistochemistry using a polyclonal antibody against the tyrosine-kinase domain of the RET protein.

Among them, RET was highly expressed in 65 (51.2%) cases and moderately expressed in 17 (13.4%). RET expression was absent in 45 (35.4%) cases. No correlation was found between RET expression and other parameters such as sex, age at diagnosis, tumor class and histological variant.

PTCs included 27 classical (PTCC) and 16 follicular variants (PTCFV). A statistically significant association was found between tumor type and cyclin D1 staining, distribution, and intensity. There were fewer cyclin D1-positive FAs than PTCs (52% vs. 88% respectively; P<0.001) and stain distribution was greater in PTC than FA (P=0.032). More PTCs were positive than FCAs (88% vs. 61%, respectively; P=0.013). All significant comparisons remained significant after adjusting for tumor size. FA did not differ from FCA in staining/intensity. There were fewer cyclin D1-positive FAs than PTCC (52% vs. 89%, respectively; P=0.003) and PTCFV (52% vs. 88%, respectively; P=0.023). FCA also differed significantly from PTCC in staining (61% vs. 89%, respectively; P=0.044) and intensity (P=0.024). In terms of cyclin D1 intensity, FA had significantly less intense staining than PTCC (P=0.004). No significant associations were found between PTC nodal status and any cyclin D1 characteristic. In conclusion, cyclin D1 shows heterogeneity in distribution and intensity in benign and malignant thyroid tumors, which disqualifies it as a primary diagnostic marker in these tumors; however, it may be helpful in distinguishing FA from PTC, especially PTCFV.

A subset of thyroid tumors have loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 10q22-23, a region harboring the gene responsible for Cowden disease, an autosomal dominant hamartoma syndrome associated with thyroid and breast tumors. PTEN/MMAC1/TEP1 codes for a dual-specificity phosphatase and is likely a tumor suppressor gene. We sought to determine the PTEN status in a series of epithelial thyroid neoplasms. We studied 95 sporadic thyroid tumors, of which 39 were papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs), 12 were follicular carcinomas, 9 were anaplastic carcinomas, 5 were Hürthle cell carcinomas, 21 were nonfunctioning follicular adenomas, and 9 were Hürthle cell adenomas. Direct sequencing of PCR-amplified products was performed for all nine exons of PTEN. Two polymorphic markers, one located in intron 8 and another, a dinucleotide repeat marker, AFMa086wg9, located within intron 2, were analyzed in paired blood-tumor DNA samples to assess hemizygous deletions of PTEN. We found a somatic frameshift mutation in one PTC, which was expected to generate a premature stop codon 2 amino acids downstream. Twenty-six % of informative benign tumors (four follicular adenomas and three Hürthle cell adenomas) and only 3 of 49 (6.1%) informative malignant tumors (one PTC, one follicular carcinoma, and one anaplastic carcinoma) showed evidence of hemizygous deletion of PTEN (P = 0.046). We conclude that a subset of thyroid tumors have somatic deletions of the PTEN gene, predominantly the benign forms, and that small intragenic mutations of PTEN are infrequent in thyroid tumors. We speculate that other mechanisms of PTEN inactivation, rather than small intragenic mutations, might occur in the hemizygously deleted samples and act as the \"Knudson second hit.\" Alternatively, other tumor suppressor genes mapping to chromosome 10q22-23 could be the actual targets for such deletions and thus represent the various hits in the pathway of multistep carcinogenesis.",

Absence of SDHB expression in tumors derived from tissues susceptible to SDH deficiency is not fully elucidated.;Three unrelated SDHD patients, two with pituitary adenoma (PA) and one with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), and three SDHB patients affected by renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) were identified from four European centers. SDHA/SDHB immunohistochemistry (IHC), SDHx mutation analysis, and loss of heterozygosity analysis of the involved SDHx gene were performed on all tumors. A cohort of 348 tumors of unknown SDHx mutational status, including renal tumors, PTCs, PAs, neuroblastic tumors, seminomas, and adenomatoid tumors, was investigated by SDHB IHC.;Of the six index patients, all RCCs and one PA displayed SDHB immunonegativity in contrast to the other PA and PTC. All immunonegative tumors demonstrated loss of the WT allele, indicating bi-allelic inactivation of the germline mutated gene. Of 348 tumors, one clear cell RCC exhibited partial loss of SDHB expression.;These findings strengthen the etiological association of SDHx genes with pituitary neoplasia and provide evidence against a link between PTC and SDHx mutations.

Follicular carcinoma (FTC) is considered more malignant than papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is one of the most lethal human cancers. Opioid Growth Factor (OGF; chemical term - [Met5]-enkephalin) and its receptor, OGFr, form an inhibitory axis regulating cell proliferation. Both the peptide and receptor have been detected in a wide variety of cancers, and OGF is currently used clinically as a biotherapy for some non-thyroid neoplasias. This study addressed the question of whether the OGF-OGFr axis is present and functional in human thyroid follicular cell - derived cancer.;Utilizing human ATC (KAT-18), PTC (KTC-1), and FTC (WRO 82-1) cell lines, immunohistochemistry was employed to ascertain the presence and location of OGF and OGFr. The growth characteristics in the presence of OGF or the opioid antagonist naltrexone (NTX), and the specificity of opioid peptides for proliferation of ATC, were established in KAT-18 cells. Dependence on peptide and receptor were investigated using neutralization studies with antibodies and siRNA experiments, respectively. The mechanism of peptide action on DNA synthesis and cell survival was ascertained. The ubiquity of the OGF-OGFr axis in thyroid follicular cell-derived cancer was assessed in KTC-1 (PTC) and WRO 82-1 (FTC) tumor cells.;OGF and OGFr were present in KAT-18 cells. Concentrations of 10-6 M OGF inhibited cell replication up to 30%, whereas NTX increased cell growth up to 35% relative to cultures treated with sterile water. OGF treatment reduced cell number by as much as 38% in KAT-18 ATC in a dose-dependent and receptor-mediated manner. OGF antibodies neutralized the inhibitory effects of OGF, and siRNA knockdown of OGFr negated growth inhibition by OGF. Cell survival was not altered by OGF, but DNA synthesis as recorded by BrdU incorporation was depressed by 28% in OGF-treated cultures compared to those exposed to sterile water. The OGF-OGFr axis was detected and functional in PTC (KTC-1) and FTC (WRO 82-1) cell lines.;These data suggest that OGF and OGFr are present in follicular-derived thyroid cancers, and that OGF serves in a tonically active inhibitory manner to maintain homeostasis of cell proliferation.

Analysis of the mutant phenotype demonstrates that both segment and parasegment borders are included in the duplicated pattern of ptc mutants. We have cloned the ptc gene and deduced that the product is a 1286 amino acid protein with at least seven putative transmembrane alpha helices. ptc RNA is expressed in embryos in broad stripes of segmental periodicity that later split into two stripes per segment primordium. The pattern of expression does not directly predict the transformation seen in ptc mutant embryos, suggesting that ptc participates in cell interactions that establish pattern within the segment.",

Based on this database a pooled analysis of data on the rates of RET/PTC1, RET/PTC3 and RET/PTC in total was conducted. Statistical approach involves a simple pooling, as well as calculations on the models of random and fixed effects. Since almost all the strata were characterized by heterogeneity, simple pooling and random effect models were adequate. Calculations using both models led to almost identical results. For rates of RET/PTC1, RET/PTC3 and RET/PTC in total with respect to formed carcinoma striations the following values (pooling, in %) were obtained: sporadic, total--13.2; 8.9; 21.2; sporadic, adults--13.3; 9.9; 21.1; sporadic, children--22.4; 17.5; 44.5; radiogenic, total--20.9; 20.3; 40.4; radiotherapy (exposure in childhood)--31.1; 11.8; 42.5; children affected after the Chernobyl accident--19.9; 23.6; 46.1; radiological incidents (exposure in adulthood)--19.9; 7.7; 18.4. Statistically proven is the reliability of differences of carcinoma indicators for children compared with adults (both sporadic and radiogenic tumors) and for radiogenic cancer compared with sporadic. The greatest increase in rate after irradiation was found for RET/PTC1, previously characterized in vitro as one of radiogenic types of RET/PTC.",

Unlike well differentiated tumors, PDCs are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The general prevalence of RET/PTC rearrangement in thyroid PDC and its impact on patient outcome are unknown. To address these issues and to identify prognostically relevant clinicopathologic parameters, we have investigated a series of 62 PDCs. RET/PTC rearrangement, analyzed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry using antibodies specific for the tyrosine kinase and juxtamembrane portions of the RET protein, was identified in 8/62 (12.9%) PDCs. RET/PTC was more common in cases with histologic evidence indicating coexistence with or possible evolution from a well differentiated papillary carcinoma (5 of 25 tumors, 20%) but did not correlate with other clinicopathologic parameters. The relatively low prevalence of RET activation in PDCs argues against a major role for RET/PTC in the progression from well to poorly differentiated thyroid tumor phenotypes. Survival analysis demonstrates that poor survival in PDC is associated with old age, male sex, invasion of extrathyroidal soft tissues, coexistence in the same tumor of oncocytic features with insular growth pattern, and distant metastases but not RET activation.",

Using gene set enrichment analysis and in vitro and in vivo functional studies, we identified and validated a B-Raf(V600E) gene set signature associated with tumor progression in PTCs. An independent cohort of B-Raf(V600E)-positive PTCs showed significantly higher expression levels of many extracellular matrix genes compared with controls. We performed extensive in vitro and in vivo validations on thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), because it has been previously shown to be important in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis and metastasis and is present in abundance in tumor stroma. Knockdown of B-Raf(V600E) resulted in TSP-1 down-regulation and a reduction of adhesion and migration/invasion of human thyroid cancer cells. Knockdown of TSP-1 resulted in a similar phenotype. B-Raf(V600E) cells in which either B-Raf(V600E) or TSP-1 were knocked down were implanted orthotopically into the thyroids of immunocompromised mice, resulting in significant reduction in tumor size and fewer pulmonary metastases from the primary carcinoma as compared with the control cells. Treatment of orthotopic thyroid tumors, initiated 1 week after tumor cell implantation with PLX4720, an orally available selective inhibitor of B-Raf(V600E), caused a significant tumor growth delay and decreased distant metastases, without evidence of toxicity. In conclusion, B-Raf(V600E) plays an important role in PTC progression through genes (i.e., TSP-1) important in tumor invasion and metastasis. Testing of a patient's thyroid cancer for B-Raf(V600E) will yield important information about potential tumor aggressiveness and also allow for future use of targeted therapies with selective B-Raf(V600E) inhibitors, such as PLX4720.",

In the univariate analysis, the young patients showed poorer extrathyroidal locoregional and distant recurrence rates than the middle-aged patients, but not cause-specific survival rates. In the multivariate analysis, age < 30 years was an independent or marginal predictor of extrathyroidal locoregional and distant recurrence, but not of carcinoma-related death.

Both patients demonstrated sustained clinical responses to sunitinib over a duration of 4 years. In case 1, (PTC) PET confirmed evidence of a partial metabolic response, and IHC and western blot analysis demonstrated inhibition of the RET kinase pathway posttreatment. In case 2, (FTC) PET confirmed stable disease after sunitinib. IHC staining of the tumour showed low total phosphorylated tyrosine staining at baseline which did not change after treatment.

        "Doc_abstract":"This study aimed at investigating new mechanisms of carcinogenesis in thyroid cancer at the molecular level and at finding potential protein markers involved in the initiation of the different histological subtypes. For this, we performed differential proteome analysis on primary cultured thyrocytes (PT) and transformed thyrocytes (TT) derived from 238Pu alpha-particle irradiation using 2-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Image analysis showed that one protein was very strongly expressed in TT; 55 proteins were weaker, different in intensity, including 26 spots that were increased in PT, and 29 spots were decreased. The hot spot was identified as maspin, a unique member of the serpin family considered to be a class II tumor suppressor gene. To clarify the role of maspin in thyroid carcinogenesis we searched for protein expression in 20 normal (tumor-free) tissues, as well as in 20 follicular adenomas (FAD), 20 papillary carcinomas (PTC), 20 follicular carcinomas (FTC), 20 poorly differentiated carcinomas (PDTC), and 20 undifferentiated carcinomas (UTC). Maspin protein expression was detectable in none of the cases of normal tumor-free thyroid tissue, nor in FAD, FTC, PDTC and UTC. In contrast 14 of 20 PTC (70%) showed a moderate or strong cytoplasmic staining; 4 of these 14 cases had a moderate cytoplasmic and nuclear staining. In conclusion, we hypothesize that maspin protein expression is a special feature in the cascade of PTC genesis and that the way of initiating PTC is different from other thyroid carcinoma types.",

The results show that PTC concentrations used in these experiments do not induce SSB in DNA molecule during incubation for 2 hours at 37 degrees C.

However, we identified anecdotal discordance between VE1 IHC and sequencing results and therefore analyzed VE1 staining by two different IHC methods (Leica Bond and Ventana BenchMark) in whole tissue sections from 480 colorectal carcinomas (323 BRAF wild-type, 142 BRAF V600E mutation, and 15 BRAF non-V600E mutation). We also compared the results with melanomas and papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC). With the Bond method, among 142 BRAF V600E-mutated colorectal carcinomas, 77 (54%) had diffuse VE1 staining and 48 (33%) had heterogeneous staining, but 17 (12%) were negative. Among 323 BRAF wild-type colorectal carcinomas, 196 (61%) were negative, but 127 (39%) had staining, including 7 with diffuse staining. When positivity was defined as staining in ≥ 20% of tumor cells, VE1 IHC had sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 93% for BRAF V600E mutation. With the Ventana method, among 57 BRAF V600E-mutated colorectal carcinomas, 36 (63%) had diffuse VE1 staining, whereas 6 (11%) had no or weak (<20% of tumor cells) staining.

In contrast with colorectal carcinoma, Bond and Ventana VE1 IHC in melanoma and PTC were highly concordant with sequencing results. We conclude that VE1 IHC produces suboptimal results in colorectal carcinoma and should not be used to guide patient management.",

Oncogenes have reported to be related not only in carcinogenesis but also in tumor prognosis, tumor type, differentiation and site of tumor in epithelial malignant tumors such as thyroid, breast, ovarian, and stomach cancer.

Sections stained with H&E were evaluated for each case and after confirming the diagnosis of PTC, oncoprotein expressions were determined by immunohistochemical analysis. The differences of oncoprotein expressions in PTC compared with control group were statistically significant. Cyclin D1 and p53 expressions were significantly increased in PTC. The expressions of bcl-2 and c-erbB-2 in PTC were found as increased, but the correlation between these proteins and poor prognostic parameters were not significant.

However, the recognition of follicular variant PTC raises the possibility of similar malignancy arising in struma ovarii. We examined 13 cases of struma ovarii to determine if these lesions can exhibit histological, immunohistochemical, and/or molecular features of follicular variant PTC. Ten of these had atypical histology, cytologic features of PTC, and all ten showed diffuse positivity for CK19; eight of these were also positive for HMBE-1. Mutational analysis for BRAF identified no V600E mutations. However, seven of the ten cases with features of follicular variant PTC exhibited a rearranged in transformation (RET)/PTC rearrangement by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The three cases considered to be benign based on histologic and cytologic criteria were negative for CK19 and HBME-1 by immunohistochemistry, and had no evidence of BRAF mutation or ret/PTC-1 and ret/PTC-3 rearrangements. These results indicate that follicular variant PTC can occur in struma ovarii and that such lesions exhibit the same morphologic and immunohistochemical profile as follicular variant PTC in thyroid.

To investigate how environmental and host factors interplay to modify PTC risk, we genotyped 83 cases and 324 matched controls sampled from children living in the area contaminated by fallout from the Chernobyl power plant accident for 19 polymorphisms previously associated with PTC, thyroid biology or radiation-induced second primary tumors. Significant association with PTC was found for rs1801516 (D1853N) in ATM (odds ratio (OR) = 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16, 0.73) and rs1867277 in the promoter region of FOXE1 (OR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.03, 2.34). Analysis of additional polymorphisms confirmed the association between these two genes and PTC. Our findings suggest that both DNA double-strand break repair pathway and thyroid morphogenesis pathway or dysregulation of thyroid differentiated state maintenance are involved in the etiology of PTC, and that the studied genetic polymorphisms and radiation dose appear to act as independent multiplicative risk factors for PTC.

We have proposed a molecular test based on the expression level of a series of 19 genes, capable of discriminating malignant from benign tumors [15]. A prospective study aiming at the clinical validation of the molecular test has been performed on a cohort of 730 patients with a thyroid nodule. In patients subjected to tumor resection (≈ 220), the preoperative molecular diagnosis (generated on FNAB material from analyses of the expression level of the 19 genes) was compared to the postoperative diagnosis given by the pathologist (used as reference). Treatment and follow-up of the serious forms of thyroid cancer should benefit by the early identification of tumors with a metastatic potential using molecular characteristics differentiating invasive and non-invasive thyroid carcinomas.

We first assessed the expression of miRNAs in patients with PTC, patients with benign nodules and healthy controls using a miRCURY LNA Array (n = 3 for each group). Expression of circulating miR-124-3p, miR-9-3p and miR-5691 was significantly up-regulated, while miR-4701 and miR-196b-5p were down-regulated in PTC patients. The dysregulation of miR-124-3p, miR-9-3p, miR-4701 and miR-196b-5p was further validated by qRT-PCR in fifty participants from each group. The expression of circulating miR-124-3p and miR-9-3p was significantly up-regulated in PTC patients. Both miR-124-3p and miR-9-3p could distinguish PTC from benign nodules with high sensitivity and specificity. There were no significant differences in the expression of circulating miR-4701 and miR-196b-5p between PTC patients and healthy controls.

The genetic findings were correlated with the MACIS clinical prognostic score and with individual clinical parameters. Three of the patients had been exposed to radiation in childhood or adolescence. Four of the PTCs contained RET/PTC1, confirmed by sequencing, and none contained RET/PTC2 or RET/PTC3. The prevalence of RET rearrangements overall was 8%, but in the subgroup of 3 radiation-exposed patients it was 66.6%. Interestingly, RET tyrosine kinase domain messenger ribonucleic acid was detectable in 70% of PTCs using RET exon 12/13 primers and was detectable in 24% of PTCs using RET exon 15/17 primers. RT-PCR for calcitonin and RET extracellular domain, however, was negative. There was no association between the presence or absence of RET/PTC in the patient's tumor and clinical parameters. We conclude that RET/PTC1 is the predominant rearrangement in PTCs from adults with a history of external irradiation in childhood.

A significant number of B1 B cells recognize phosphatidylcholine (PtC), a common phospholipid component of cell membrane. We report here that unlike macrophages, B1 B cells have a unique PtC-specific phagocytic function. In the presence of both PtC-coated and non-PtC control fluorescent nano-particles, B1 B cells from healthy lean mice selectively engulfed PtC-coated beads, whereas B1 B cells from HFD-fed obese mice non-discriminately phagocytosed both PtC-coated and control beads.

To determine the relationship between Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and all stages of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) with or without local lymph node metastasis (LNM). Methods. We conducted a retrospective study of thyroidectomies from 2008-2013 in First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. We categorized patients according to the presence of histopathologically proven HT. The prevalence of mPTC (maximum diameter ≤ 10 mm) and crPTC (clinical relevant PTC) and local LNM rates were compared. Results. We evaluated 6,432 consecutive thyroidectomies. In total, 1,328 specimens were confirmed as HT. The prevalence of PTC in this HT cohort was 43.8%, significantly higher than non-HT group. After adjustment of gender and age, the prevalence of PTC was still higher in HT group. HT was a risk factor for PTC in multivariate analysis with odds ratio 2.725 (95% CI, 2.390-3.109) (P < 0.001). However, no correlation was found between HT and LNM of PTC. Conclusion. HT was associated with an increased prevalence of all stages of PTC, independent of tumor size, gender, and age. In contrast, locally advanced disease defined by LNM was unrelated to HT. These data suggest an association of HT with low risk PTC and a potential protective immunologic effect from further disease progression. ",

In recent years, several progresses have been made on the molecular characterization of PTC, in general, and in the genetic alterations underlying the histotype diversity of this type of cancer, in particular. This holds true regarding alterations on nuclear DNA as well as mitochondrial DNA.

Rare tracheal tumors at the level of the thyroid can be misinterpreted as invasive thyroid cancer upon initial diagnosis. We present a series of tumors within the tracheal wall that were initially misdiagnosed as isolated, but aggressive, thyroid cancer, and later diagnosed to be different histopathologic entities.;The series consisted of four women and five men, all but two age 60 or older, who were initially diagnosed with tracheal invasion from differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). Eight had obstructive airway symptoms and one experienced gagging and choking sensations. Preoperatively, the patients underwent fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and imaging studies. A complete resection of the involved airway in combination with the thyroid gland was performed in all patients.;In this series of patients, the final diagnosis was tracheal stenosis, recurrent laryngeal nerve schwannoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) with benign intratracheal thyroid tissue, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma, each in one patient. Two patients had a tracheal chondrosarcoma, and two patients had collision tumors (PTC with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma). All patients were misunderstood preoperatively as having isolated DTC with aggressive involvement of the trachea. An accurate diagnosis in these cases was difficult due to misleading FNA readings, thought due to the FNA needle passing through the thyroid before reaching the trachea or a tumor that abuts both structures on imaging. Primary tracheal tumors and a nontumorous lesion, as well as benign thyroidal masses, mimicked invasive thyroid carcinoma in this preoperative setting.;Various entities other than thyroid cancer can masquerade as invasive thyroid cancer. In patients with an FNA showing thyroid tissue or suggesting PTC, but also have obstructive or other airway symptoms, physician awareness is needed to consider the distinct possibility of a primary tracheal lesion.

Elucidating the molecular network that is altered in PTC may lead to the identification of the critical insight into the pathogenesis of PTC. Thus far, little is known regarding the global metabolomic alterations of PTC. Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry-based metabolomics was used to analyze metabolomic alterations in matched PTC and normal thyroid tissues obtained from the patients. Multivariate statistical analyses were employed to determine the significant metabolomic differences. The mRNA levels of the associated metabolic enzyme genes were further assayed with reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. Principal component analysis, partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and orthogonal PLS-DA models were established, which could clearly separate human normal thyroid and PTC samples, and identified that metabolites in carbohydrate metabolism, including glucose, fructose, galactose, mannose, 2-keto-D-gluconic acid and rhamnose, consistently decreased, while metabolites in nucleotide metabolism, including malonic acid and inosine, and lipid metabolism, including cholesterol and arachidonic acid, significantly altered in PTC. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of metabolic enzyme genes, including glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase 1, lactate dehydrogenase A, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2, significantly increased in PTC. Based on the metabolomic and mRNA data, various metabolites may be used for increased synthesis of nucleotides and oncogenic lipids in PTC, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of PTC.

The diameter of the tumor cell nuclei ranged from 5.6 to 7.2 microns. Many nodules had nuclei displaying a fine chromatin pattern somewhat resembling those of PTC, but these were present in <20% of the tumor cells.

Clinical follow-up from 1 to 19 years revealed no evidence of metastases in any of the cases. It is unlikely that the papillary structures in the study cases represent degenerative changes in view of the proliferative activity we have demonstrated in them.

The v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) valine (V) to glutamic acid (E) substitution at codon 600 (BRAF(V600E)) is the most effective diagnostic/prognostic marker and is used mainly for papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs). Although BRAF(V600E) represents 95% of all BRAF mutations, uncommon BRAF mutations have been identified in thyroid carcinomas. For the current study, the authors evaluated morphologic (plump pink cells and sickle-shaped nuclei) anti-BRAF(V600E) antibody (VE1) immunocytochemical and molecular findings of BRAF mutations in PTCs and in the follicular variant of PTC (FVPC).;Between January 2013 and June 2014, there were 150 cytologic samples with surgical follow-up at the authors' institution. BRAF mutations, which were identified using liquid-based cytology, were classified into wild-type BRAF, BRAF(V600E), and uncommon BRAF mutations. All clinicopathologic correlations between BRAF and FVPCs were analyzed.;Forty-four of 150 samples were identified as benign histologic lesions, and the authors focused on the 106 cytologic samples from patients who had malignant outcomes (60 PTCs and 46 FVPCs). The series included 16 follicular neoplasms, 36 samples diagnosed as suspicious of malignancy, and 54 samples diagnosed as positive for malignancy. The BRAF(V600E) mutation was detected in 17.4% of FVPCs and in 66.6% of PTCs, whereas uncommon BRAF mutations were detected only in FVPCs. Plump pink cells and VE1 expression were not identified in samples that had uncommon BRAF mutations. VE1 immunocytochemistry yielded positive results in all 36 samples that had the BRAF(V600E) mutation.;Uncommon BRAF mutations were observed only in FVPCs and were linked to less aggressive behavior.

Peritubular capillary (PTC) endothelium expresses the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II antigens in the resting phase, as does the glomerular capillary endothelium, suggesting that these cells may be major immune targets. However, the role of PTCs in renal allo- and xeno-graft rejection is unclear. In this review, we discuss injury and subsequent remodeling of PTCs in both humoral- and cell-mediated rejection in allo- and xeno-grafts. Recent evidence suggests that PTC injury and endothelial cell death occur during both cell- and humoral-mediated rejection. Severe PTC rejection contributes to deterioration of graft function and acute graft loss. The mild but recurrent form of PTC rejection is associated with progressive interstitial fibrosis and chronic rejection. Following endothelial injury, the remaining PTC endothelium activates with up-regulation of allo-antigens and adhesion molecules, and down-regulation of anti-coagulant proteins. Subsequent to this, more severe rejection and graft dysfunction occur. Therefore, a careful analysis of cellular- and antibody-mediated rejection in PTCs is important in the diagnosis of rejection, prediction of graft prognosis, and in further development of new anti-rejection therapies.",

To identify the putative thyroid 17p13 TSG we mapped thyroid tumor loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at high resolution within this region. We examined 20 typical follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTC), 19 Hurthle cell carcinomas (HCC), 15 papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC), and 7 follicular adenomas (FA) for LOH at 17p13 using 18 probes. Complete clinical follow-up data were available for all patients. We confirmed a high 17p13 LOH rate in FTC (18 of 20) and HCC (13 of 19) and showed an association between 17p13 LOH and advanced tumor grade. Only 4 of 15 PTC and 1 of 7 FA displayed 17p13 LOH. In the HCC we identified a narrow minimal common deleted region between D17S1308 (285 kb from the p-telomer) and D17S695 (696 kb from the p-telomer). This region was flanked centromerically by a breakpoint cluster, further suggesting nonrandom deletion. All but 1 of the PTC and FA with 17p LOH and 50% of the affected FTC also showed LOH in this region. These data suggest that a TSG, involved in HCC pathogenesis, is contained within the D17S1308-D17S695 interval. There are several potential candidate TSGs in this region that are worthy of further study.",

To our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluates chromosomal and nucleotide instability in the same PTC tumor specimens. Four of 15 samples (27%) had aberrations detected by CGH.

No MSI was detected in any of the PTC samples (n=16), and all samples examined by immunohistochemistry (n=9) expressed the DNA repair enzymes hmlh1 and hmsh2. All PTC samples with abnormal CGH had vascular invasion or invasion of the thyroid capsule, and there was a significant correlation between the presence of chromosomal aberrations and capsular/vascular invasion (P=0.026).

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs with diverse regulatory capacities in eukaryotes and have been frequently implied in human cancer. Despite current progress, however, a panoramic overview concerning miRNA regulatory networks in PTC is still lacking. Here, we analyzed the expression datasets of PTC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Data Portal and demonstrate for the first time that immune responses are significantly enriched and under specific regulation in the direct miRNA--target network among distinctive PTC variants to different extents. Additionally, considering the unconventional properties of miRNAs, we explore the protein-coding competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) and the modulatory networks in PTC and unexpectedly disclose concerted regulation of immune responses from these networks. Interestingly, miRNAs from these conventional and unconventional networks share general similarities and differences but tend to be disparate as regulatory activities increase, coordinately tuning the immune responses that in part account for PTC tumor biology. Together, our systematic results uncover the intensive regulation of immune responses underlain by miRNA-mediated networks in PTC, opening up new avenues in the management of thyroid cancer.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate thyroid carcinoma (TC) incidence trends in Australia, with particular reference to the roles of iodine nutrition, ionizing radiation, and ascertainment bias. Data from Australia's regional cancer registries were used to determine national TC incidence and mortality trends for the period 1982-1997. There were 9,053 new diagnoses of TC. Papillary, follicular, medullary, anaplastic, and \"other diagnoses,\" accounted for 65.8%, 17.8%, 4.6%, 1.3%, and 10.5% of registered cases, respectively. TC incidence rates increased by 6.7% per year for females and 4.4% per year for males between 1982-1997 (p < 0.001). The increase was primarily because of a 10.7% per year and 8.3% per year rise in PTC incidence for females and males respectively (p < 0.001). The increase in PTC incidence was most significant for the population residing on Australia's eastern seaboard. The greatest relative and absolute increase in PTC (24.7% per year) occurred in Tasmania. These findings are consistent with a true increase in underlying PTC incidence rates.

The clinical-pathological factors and disease outcome over 190 months were assessed; immunohistochemical subcellular localization of PD-L1 was correlated with disease free survival (DFS) using Kaplan Meier survival and Cox multivariate regression analysis. Increased PD-L1 immunostaining was predominantly localized in cytoplasm and occasionally in plasma membrane of tumor cells. Among all combined stages of PTC, patients with increased PD-L1 membrane or cytoplasmic positivity had significantly shorter median DFS (36 months and 49 months respectively) as compared to those with PD-L1 negative tumors (DFS, both 186 months with p < 0.001 and p < 0.01 respectively). Comparison of PD-L1+ and PD-L1- patients with matched staging showed increased cytoplasmic positivity in all four stages of PTC that correlated with a greater risk of recurrence and a poor prognosis, but increased membrane positivity significantly correlated with a greater risk of metastasis or death only in Stage IV patients. In conclusion, PD-L1 positive expression in PTC correlates with a greater risk of recurrence and shortened disease free survival supporting its potential application as a prognostic marker for PTC.

Common fragile sites frequently coincide with the location of genes involved in carcinogenic chromosomal translocations, suggesting their role in cancer formation. However, there has been no direct evidence linking breakage at fragile sites to the formation of a cancer-specific translocation. Here, we studied the involvement of fragile sites in the formation of RET/PTC rearrangements, which are frequently found in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). These rearrangements are commonly associated with radiation exposure; however, most of the tumors found in adults are not linked to radiation. In this study, we provide structural and biochemical evidence that the RET, CCDC6 and NCOA4 genes participating in two major types of RET/PTC rearrangements, are located in common fragile sites FRA10C and FRA10G, and undergo DNA breakage after exposure to fragile site-inducing chemicals. Moreover, exposure of human thyroid cells to these chemicals results in the formation of cancer-specific RET/PTC rearrangements. These results provide the direct evidence for the involvement of chromosomal fragile sites in the generation of cancer-specific rearrangements in human cells.",

Thirty patients (eight men and 22 women) whose FNA was compatible with benign lesion and 26 patients (eight men and 18 women) whose FNA was compatible with PTC were included in the study. Fine-needle aspiration materials were stained for AgNOR detection according to a specific protocol. One hundred nuclei per individual have been evaluated, and AgNOR number and NORa/TNa proportions of individual cells were measured and calculated by using a computer program. Patients with PTC had significantly (p<0.001) higher AgNOR count (4.6 ± 1.2%) than in the patients with benign lesions (2.0 ± 0.5%). Additionally, patients with PTC had significantly (p<0.001) higher NORa/TNa (13.4 ± 2.4) than in the patients with benign lesion (5.7 ± 1.0). Modified method of AgNOR staining is an easy and reliable method for evaluating proliferation activity of cells in malignant and benign thyroid lesions and it may contribute to routine cytopathology in inconclusive situations.",

Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and photoconversion analyses revealed that PTC+ transcripts are specifically retained at the transcription site. Remarkably, the retained PTC+ transcripts are mainly unspliced, and this RNA retention is dependent upon two important NMD factors, UPF1 and SMG6, since their depletion led to the release of the PTC+ transcripts. Finally, ChIP analysis showed a physical association of UPF1 and SMG6 with both the PTC+ and the PTC- reporter genes in vivo.

Further mechanistic studies revealed that sex-determining region Y-box 17 (Sox17) is directly targeted by miR-595. We then demonstrated that IL-22 regulated migration and invasion of PTC cells via inhibiting Sox17 expression. Interestingly, in PTC cell lines and PTC tissues, expression of IL-22 and miR-595 was upregulated and Sox17 downregulated compared with normal thyroid, and their expression levels were closely correlated.

Bone marrow (BM)-derived cells can contribute to repair of the renal PTC network after ischemic injury. However, the cell fate and the regulation of renal BM-derived cell engraftment in comparison with somatic cells during disease progression are unclear. This study characterized the time course and regulation of PTC endothelial cell injury in adriamycin (ADR)-induced nephropathy in mice, a model of chronic, irreversible, progressive renal disease. Enhanced green fluorescence protein-positive BM cells that coexpressed two endothelial cell markers, von Willebrand factor and CD31, were found to engraft into the PTC of chimeric ADR-injected mice in a time-dependent manner. The number of BM-derived PTC endothelial cells peaked 2 wk after ADR injection, then declined dramatically thereafter. In these mice, apoptosis was evident in BM-derived PTC endothelial cells, and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and TGF-beta1/Smad signaling pathways were activated. Blocking both the p38 MAPK and TGF-beta1/Smad signaling pathways by administration of a p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) and a TGF-beta receptor 1 inhibitor (ALK5I) to ADR-injected mice rescued BM-derived PTC endothelial cells from apoptosis, reduced the loss of PTC, and restored kidney function. Investigation into the signaling pathways that regulate the differentiation and survival of BM-derived cells that engraft into the kidney in the proinflammatory setting of progressive renal disease is vital for the successful development of cell-based therapies to promote renal regeneration and repair.",

The present study was undertaken to examine the expression of Hedgehog signalling pathway in gliomas to elucidate its prognostic value in this tumour.;Surgical specimens were obtained from 118 patients with primary gliomas. The expression of sonic hedgehog (Shh), its receptor patched (Ptch), and downstream transcription factor Gli1 was evaluated using immunohistochemical staining. Kaplan– Meier survival and Cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate the prognosis of patients.;Immunostaining revealed that the activation of Hedgehog signalling pathway was significantly associated with the Karnofsky performance scale (KPS) score and World Health Organization (WHO) grade of patients with gliomas. Especially, the positive expression rates of Shh, Ptch and Gli1 were significantly higher in patients with higher grade (P = 0.008, 0.008 and 0.01) and lower KPS score (P = 0.009, 0.009 and 0.02). Statistical analysis showed that patients expressing Shh, Ptch and Gli1 have poorer overall survival rates than those not expressing these proteins. Cox multi-factor analysis showed that KPS (P = 0.02), WHO grade (P = 0.008), Shh (P = 0.01), Ptch (P = 0.01) and Gli1 (P = 0.03) were independent prognosis factors for human gliomas.;These results provide convincing evidence that the Shh-Ptch1-Gli1 signalling pathway is activated in human gliomas and correlates with clinicopathologic features as well as with prognostic parameters of the tumours.

The present study was to further investigate and establish this role of CCDC67 in PTC.;The expression of CCDC67, both at mRNA and protein levels, was sharply down-regulated in PTC compared with normal thyroid tissues. Lower CCDC67 expression was significantly associated with aggressive tumor behaviors, such as advanced tumor stages and lymph node metastasis, as well as BRAF mutation. Introduced expression of CCDC67 in TPC-1 cells robustly inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation and migration, induced G1 phase cell cycle arrest, and increased cell apoptosis.;Primary PTC tumors and matched normal thyroid tissues were obtained from 200 unselected patients at the initial surgery for detection of CCDC67 mRNA and protein by RT-PCR and Western blotting analyses, respectively. Genomic DNA sequencing was performed to detect BRAF mutation in PTC tumors. Clinicopathological data were retrospectively reviewed for correlation analyses. PTC cell line TPC-1 with stable transfection of CCDC67 was used to investigate the functions of CCDC67.;This large study demonstrates down-regulation of CCDC67 in PTC, an inverse relationship between CCDC67 expression and PTC aggressiveness and BRAF mutation, and a robust inhibitory effect of CCDC67 on PTC cellular activities.

By using Ret/ptc2 short isoform (iso9), we have previously demonstrated that Tyr586 (Tyr1062 of protoRet) is the docking site for both the PTB and the SH2 domains of Shc. To determine the relevance of this interaction for the transforming activity of Ret/ptc oncogenes, we have generated and characterized novel Ret/ptc mutants unable to activate Shc: Ret/ptc2 long isoform (iso51)-Y586F and both isoforms of Ret/ptc2-N583A. These mutants neither activate Shc nor transform NIH3T3 cells. Since Tyr1062 shows features of a multifunctional docking site, we have used a Shc mutant (Shc Y317F) to directly assess Shc role. We have demonstrated that in our cell system Shc Y317F behaves like a dominant interfering mutant on the activation of the Grb2-Sos pathway by endogenous Shc triggered by Ret/ptc2. A strong reduction of the transforming activity of Ret/ptc2 in presence of this mutant was also demonstrated. Our data suggest that Shc activation play a key role in the transforming pathways triggered by Ret/ptc oncoproteins. Moreover, we have shown that coexpression of the Shc-Y317F mutant with Ret/ptc2 specifically causes apoptosis, and that the surviving cells lose the long-term expression of one of the two genes.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Proliferation and apoptosis are opposing processes by which the cell numbers are kept in a delicate balance, essential for tissue homeostasis, whereas uncontrolled growth of cells is a hallmark of cancer. Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is the commonest type of thyroid cancer, with some PTC following an indolent course, whereas the other ones are more aggressive.;To evaluate respective contribution of proliferation and apoptosis in the tumorigenesis of PTC by automated analysis.;We investigated the immunolabeling of phosphorylated histone H3 (pHH3), cyclin D1, active caspase-3, and bcl-2 in thirteen cases each of metastatic PTC, follicular variant of PTC (FVPTC), papillary microcarcinoma (PMC) and well differentiated tumor of uncertain malignant potential (WDT-UMP). FVPTC cases comprised seven encapsulated and six unencapsulated cases.;Proliferation, as assessed by pHH3 and cyclin D1 immunolabeling, was increased in all PTC variants, including the putative precursor lesion WDT-UMP, compared to normal thyroid tissue. pHH3 was immunolabeled in more cells of metastatic PTC than of PMC and of encapsulated FVPTC. Surprisingly, metastatic PTC and unencapsulated FVPTC also demonstrated more cleaved caspase-3 immunolabeled cells than the other types. In contrast, increased expression of bcl-2 protein was seen in normal thyroid areas, encapsulated FVPTC and PMC as compared to metastatic PTC. Metastatic PTC shows higher proliferation than other types of PTC but unexpectedly also higher apoptotic levels. Similar results were also seen with unencapsulated FVPTC, thus suggesting that unencapsulated FVPTC has a potential for adverse outcome. Bcl-2 was immunolabeled in a low percentage of cells in WDT-UMP.;The expression of the proliferative protein pHH3 together with the apoptotic marker cleaved caspase-3 may indicate an aggressive behaviour of PTC and loss of apoptosis inhibition by bcl-2 protein can further amplify the role of these proteins in tumor progression. Both cyclin D1 and bcl-2 could prove to be interesting markers of PTC precursor lesions. Automated/digital image quantification approach helps in refining the diagnostic accuracy.",

Results from the read-through analysis of COS7 cells carrying the nonsense mutation pDsRed-EGFPmtag-Y445X treated by PTC 124 showed EGFP transcript level was increased in the COS7 cells treated by PTC124 in a dose-dependent manner. This novel reporter system was applicable to the majority of different PTC patterns and could be used to quantify efficiency of read-through within a single cell or select cells carrying PTC. ",

We used BRAF-induced papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) mouse models to examine the role of TAMs in PTC progression. Following conditional activation of BRAF(V600E) in murine thyroids there is an increased expression of the TAM chemoattractants Csf-1 and Ccl-2. This is followed by the development of PTCs that are densely infiltrated with TAMs that express Csf-1r and Ccr2. Targeting CCR2-expressing cells during BRAF-induction reduced TAM density and impaired PTC development. This strategy also induced smaller tumors, decreased proliferation and restored a thyroid follicular architecture in established PTCs. In PTCs from mice that lacked CSF-1 or that received a c-FMS/CSF-1R kinase inhibitor, TAM recruitment and PTC progression was impaired, recapitulating the effects of targeting CCR2-expressing cells. Our data demonstrate that TAMs are pro-tumorigenic in advanced PTCs and that they can be targeted pharmacologically, which may be potentially useful for patients with advanced thyroid cancers.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Medullary and papillary thyroid carcinoma (MTC and PTC) are two types of thyroid cancer that can originate from activating mutations or rearrangements in the RET gene. Therapeutic options are limited in recurrent disease, but because RET is a tyrosine kinase (TK) receptor involved in cellular growth and proliferation, treatment with a TK inhibitor might be promising. Several TK inhibitors have been tested in clinical trials, but it is unknown which inhibitor is most effective and whether there is any specificity for particular RET mutations.;We aimed to compare the effect of four TK inhibitors (axitinib, sunitinib, vandetanib, and XL184) on cell proliferation, RET expression and autophosphorylation, and ERK activation in cell lines expressing a MEN2A (MTC-TT), a MEN2B (MZ-CRC-1) mutation, and a RET/PTC (TPC-1) rearrangement.;The three cell lines were cultured and treated with the four TK inhibitors. Effects on cell proliferation and RET and ERK expression and activation were determined.;XL184 and vandetanib most effectively inhibited cell proliferation, RET autophosphorylation in combination with a reduction of RET expression, and ERK phosphorylation in MTC-TT and MZ-CRC-1, respectively. TPC-1 cells showed a decrease in RET autophosphorylation after treatment with XL184, but no effect was observed on ERK activation.;There is indeed specificity for different RET mutations, with XL184 being the most potent inhibitor in MEN2A and PTC and vandetanib the most effective in MEN2B in vitro. No TK inhibitor was superior for all the cell lines tested, indicating that mutation-specific therapies could be beneficial in treating MTC and PTC.",
