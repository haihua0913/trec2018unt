We have evaluated the expression of FLT3 by RNase protection assay and Western blotting in 161 primary bone marrow (BM) samples from patients with leukemia. FLT3 RNA was found to be expressed at a higher level than in normal BM controls in 33 of 33 B-lineage acute leukemias, 11 of 12 acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs), and 3 of 11 T-cell acute leukemias (T-ALLs). Expression of FLT3 RNA was also observed in some cases of blast crisis CML. The FLT3 signal resulted from expression on the leukemic blasts, and was not caused by increased FLT3 expression on normal CD34+ stem/progenitor cells in the leukemic samples. To determine if FLT3 protein was also overexpressed, proteins were extracted from leukemic BM samples and screened by Western blotting with anti-FLT3 antisera. FLT3 protein was not detected in normal BM controls, but was found in 14 of 14 B-lineage ALLs, 36 of 41 AMLs, and 1 of 4 T-ALLs. Stimulation of patient samples with FLT3 ligand resulted in autophosphorylation of the FLT3 receptor, suggesting the receptor is functional in these cells. These data show that FLT3 RNA and protein are aberrantly expressed by AML and ALL cells in that CD34 expression and FLT3 expression are no longer synchronous, and suggest the possibility that overexpression of FLT3 could play a role in the survival and/or proliferation of malignant clones in acute myeloid and lymphoid leukemias.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Defining differentiation pathways is central to understanding the pathogenesis of hematopoietic disorders, including leukemia. The function of the receptor tyrosine kinase Flk2 (Flt3) in promoting myeloid development remains poorly defined, despite being commonly mutated in acute myeloid leukemia. We investigated the effect of Flk2 deficiency on myelopoiesis, focusing on specification of progenitors between HSC and mature cells. We provide evidence that Flk2 is critical for proliferative expansion of multipotent progenitors that are common precursors for all lymphoid and myeloid lineages, including megakaryocyte/erythroid (MegE) cells. Flk2 deficiency impaired the generation of both lymphoid and myeloid progenitors by abrogating propagation of their common upstream precursor. At steady state, downstream compensatory mechanisms masked the effect of Flk2 deficiency on mature myeloid output, whereas transplantation of purified progenitors revealed impaired generation of all mature lineages. Flk2 deficiency did not affect lineage choice, thus dissociating the role of Flk2 in promoting cell expansion and regulating cell fate. Surprisingly, despite impairing myeloid development, Flk2 deficiency afforded protection against myeloablative insult. This survival advantage was attributed to reduced cell cycling and proliferation of progenitors in Flk2-deficient mice. Our data support the existence of a common Flk2(+) intermediate for all hematopoietic lineages and provide insight into how activating Flk2 mutations promote hematopoietic malignancy by non-Flk2-expressing myeloid cells.

        "Doc_abstract":"The hematopoietic class III receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) Flt3 (Flk2, STK1) has recently received much attention as a potential drug target. Activation of Flt3 by different types of mutations plays an important role for proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, and prevention of differentiation of leukemic blasts in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). At least one type of such mutations - an internal tandem duplication in the Flt3 juxtamembrane domain (Flt3-ITD) - has been associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Signal transduction of Flt3 involves activation of several conserved pathways, including the RAS/MAP-Kinase and the phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt signaling cascades. Transforming versions of Flt3 exhibit altered signaling, for example a very pronounced activation of STAT5, ultimately resulting in alternate profiles of gene expression and cell transformation. Selective inhibitors of Flt3 tyrosine kinase activity have the potential to suppress aberrant Flt3 signaling. Although highly homologous to other class III RTKs, Flt3 is resistant to the phenylaminopyrimidine STI571 (Gleevec, Imatinib), a potent inhibitor of other RTKs in the family, such as the PDGFbeta-receptor or c-Kit. STI571 binding to Flt3 is prevented by the phenylalanine 691 side-chain in the ATP binding center and mutating this site to threonine renders the corresponding Flt3 mutant sensitive to STI571. Compounds of several other structural families, including the quinoxaline AG1296, the bis(1H-2-indolyl)-1-methanone D-65476, the indolinones SU5416 and SU11248, the indolocarbazoles PKC412 and CEP-701, and the piperazonyl quinazoline CT53518, are potent inhibitors of Flt3 kinase. They exhibit different selectivity profiles, both with respect to other kinases and among wildtype Flt3 and its activated versions. These compounds hold promise as novel drugs against AML and as probes for understanding activation mechanisms and signaling pathways in the class III RTK family.",

FLT3 is also expressed on leukemia blasts in most cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In order to determine the frequency of FLT3 oncogene mutations, we analyzed genomic DNA of adult de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) were used for FLT3 exons 11, 14, and 15, followed by direct DNA sequencing. Two different types of functionally important FLT 3 mutations have been identified. Those mutations were unique to patients with inv(16), t(15:17) or t(8;21) and comprised fifteen cases with internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation in the juxtamembrane domain and eleven cases with point mutation (exon 20, Asp835Tyr). The high frequency of the flt3 proto-oncogene mutations in acute myeloid leukemia AML suggests a key role for the receptor function. The association of FLT3 mutations with chromosomal abnormalities invites speculation as to the link between these two changes in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemiaAML. Furthermore, CSGE method has shown to be a rapid and sensitive screening method for detection of nucleotide alteration in FLT3 gene. Finally, this study reports, for the first time in Saudi Arabia, mutations in the human FLT3 gene in acute myeloid leukemia AML patients.",

High levels of FLT3 expression were detected in 92% of the cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) tested, ranging from the M1 to the M5 stages of differentiation assessed in the French-American-British classification. Immature (MO) AML cells, biphenotypic leukemias, and AML with megakaryocytic differentiation (M7 subtype) also expressed the FLT3 transcript. FLT3 was also expressed at high levels in acute lymphoid leukemias of T and B origins. Finally, it was not expressed in chronic myeloid leukemias in chronic phase, whereas it was expressed in most blast crisis samples.

All cases were also tested for their proliferative response to human FLT3 ligand (FL) and KIT ligand (KL) and for colony formation in the presence of single or associated cytokines. Among 16 AML cases tested, 10/16 expressed FLT3 receptor and 12/16 expressed KIT receptor, without any correlation with FAB subtype. FL and KL stimulated the proliferation of leukemic blasts in 11/16 AML cases (including five FLT3 or KIT receptor-negative cases), with an additive effect when added simultaneously. By contrast, some receptor-expressing AMLs did not display significant proliferative responses to their respective ligands. FL and KL as single factors induced or significantly increased the colony formation by clonogenic precursor cells respectively in eight and six of 13 cases tested. In some cases growth factor association significantly enhanced colony growth.

Using non-parametric test, the differences between groups were analyzed. Then the correlation between STK1 level and clinical characteristics was explored by a way of chi-square test. The results indicated that the serum TK1 level in complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) AML patients decreased in varying degree as compared to pretreatment (P < 0.05), while there was no significant difference of TK1 level in non-remission (NR) ones (P > 0.05).

FLT3 is therefore an attractive drug target. However, the molecular mechanisms by which FLT3 mutations lead to cell transformation in AML remain unclear. To develop a better understanding of FLT3 signaling as well as its downstream effectors, we performed detailed phosphoproteomic analysis of FLT3 signaling in human leukemia cells. We identified over 1000 tyrosine phosphorylation sites from about 750 proteins in both AML (wild type and mutant FLT3) and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (normal and amplification of FLT3) cell lines. Furthermore, using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), we were able to quantified over 400 phosphorylation sites (pTyr, pSer, and pThr) that were responsive to FLT3 inhibition in FLT3 driven human leukemia cell lines. We also extended this phosphoproteomic analysis on bone marrow from primary AML patient samples, and identify over 200 tyrosine and 800 serine/threonine phosphorylation sites in vivo. This study showed that oncogenic FLT3 regulates proteins involving diverse cellular processes and affects multiple signaling pathways in human leukemia that we previously appreciated, such as Fc epsilon RI-mediated signaling, BCR, and CD40 signaling pathways.

The mutated form of the receptor is constitutively activated and known to play an important role in AML, but the activation state of the overexpressed wild-type (wt) receptor is, at present, unknown. In this study, we examined the activation state of the wild-type receptor in AML. We found that the wild-type receptor was constitutively phosphorylated/activated in 8 of 12 primary AML samples and 4 of 13 leukemia cell lines. To explain why wtFLT3 is often activated, we investigated the expression of its ligand, FL, by these same cells. Coexpression of FL with FLT3 was a universal finding in both primary AML samples and leukemic-derived cell lines. To further prove that autocrine signaling was accounting for the activation, we showed that conditioned media but not fresh media was able to activate FLT3. In addition, an antibody that blocks binding of ligand to the receptor blocks FLT3 activation. Finally, depletion of FL from conditioned media is able to block the activation of FLT3. Taken together, these findings represent strong evidence that wtFLT3 is often constitutively activated in AML and thus, like its mutated form, might contribute to the altered signaling that characterizes leukemogenesis.",

Our previous data demonstrated specific up-regulation of miR-155 in FLT3-ITD+ AML. miR-155 is known to be directly implicated in normal hematopoiesis and in some pathologies such as myeloid hyperplasia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.;To investigate about the potential influence of miR-155 de-regulation in FLT3-mutated AML we generated a transcription factors regulatory network and combined this with data from multiple sources that predict miR-155 interactions. From these analyses, we derived a sub-network, called \"miR-155 module\" that describes functional relationship among miR-155 and transcription factors in FLT3-mutated AML. We found that \"miR-155 module\" is characterized by the presence of six transcription factors as central hubs: four miR-155 regulators (JUN, RUNX1, FOSb, JUNB) and two targets of miR-155 (SPI1, CEBPB) all known to be \"master\" genes of myelopoiesis. We found, in FLT3-mutated AML, a significant down-regulation of miR-155 target genes CEBPB and SPI1 and up-regulation of miR-155 regulator genes JUN and RUNX1. We also showed that PKC412-related FLT3 inhibition, in MV4-11 cell line, causes down-regulation of miR-155 and increased level of mRNA and protein of miR-155 target SPI1. We showed in experiments of miR-155 mimic in K562 cell line, a high increase of miR-155 and an inverse correlation with the mRNA levels of its targets SPI1 and CEBPB. Moreover silencing of miR-155 in primary AMLs causes mRNA up-regulation of its target SPI1 and CEBPB.;Our results suggest that activating mutation of FLT3 in AML can lead, through the induction of JUN, to an increased expression of miR-155, which then causes down-regulation of SPI1 and CEBPB and consequently may causes block of myeloid differentiation.",

To define the role of Flt3 in AML with high Hoxa9/Meis1, we treated mice with Hoxa9/Meis1-induced AML with the Flt3 inhibitor AC220, used an Flt3-ligand (FL-/-) knockout model, and investigated whether overexpression of Flt3 could induce leukemia together with overexpression of Hoxa9. Flt3 inhibition by AC220 did not delay AML development in mice transplanted with bone marrow cells overexpressing Hoxa9 and Meis1. In addition, Hoxa9/Meis1 cells induced AML in FL-/- mice as rapid as in wild-type mice. However, FL-/- mice had reduced organ infiltration compared with wild-type mice, suggesting some Flt3-dependent effect on leukemic invasiveness. Interestingly, leukemic Hoxa9/Meis1 cells from sick mice expressed high levels of Flt3 regardless of presence of its ligand, showing that Flt3 is a passive marker on these cells. In line with this, combined engineered overexpression of Flt3 and Hoxa9 did not accelerate the progression to AML.

The well-described involvement of this ligand-receptor pair in physiological hematopoiesis raised the question whether FL and FLT3 also play a role in the pathobiology of leukemia. Following the early discovery of high receptor expression by myeloid leukemia cells, several investigators have focused their attention on these cells, both primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and continuous human myeloid leukemia cell lines. Regardless of the morphological FAB subtype, the vast majority of AML cases were FLT3-positive both at the mRNA and protein level; among the myeloid cell lines, predominantly the monocytic and myelocytic cell lines were FLT3-positive whereas the erythrocytic and megakaryocytic cell lines were FLT3-negative. Virtually all cell lines studied expressed FL transcripts; the finding that some cell lines displayed both ligand and receptor indicates the possibility of autocrine, intracrine or paracrine stimulatory loops. In vitro growth assays showed that FL caused a proliferative response in a high percentage of AML cases. Only constitutively growth factor-dependent myelocytic cell lines increased their proliferation upon incubation with FL whereas all growth factor-independent cell lines were refractory to FL stimulation. Combinations of FL with various cytokines (e.g. G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-3, M-CSF, PIXY-321, SCF) had synergistic or additive mitogenic effects. Finally, FL had significant anti-apoptotic, survival-promoting effects on primary AML cells and myeloid cell lines under serum-free culture conditions. On the strength of the above findings, it can be concluded that the FL-FLT3 signaling system may play a certain, albeit probably not causal role in the development of human leukemias. Dissection of the exact molecular pathways that lead to proliferation and/or anti-apoptosis of myeloid leukemia cells as well as the detailed elucidation of the possible contribution of the FL-FLT3 genes to leukemogenesis remain future challenges.",

It is mutated in about 1/3 of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, either by internal tandem duplications (ITD) of the juxtamembrane domain or by point mutations usually involving the kinase domain (KD). Both types of mutation constitutively activate FLT3. Many studies have shown that AML patients with FLT3/ITD mutations have poor cure rates due to relapse. This has led to the development of a number of small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) with activity against FLT3. Many of these are still in preclinical development, but several have entered clinical phase I and II trials as monotherapy in patients with relapsed AML. Patients with FLT3 mutations in these trials have shown clinical responses, most often a clearing of peripheral blasts, but rarely major reductions of bone marrow blasts. Several studies have shown that FLT3 was successfully inhibited in most patients. However, complete remissions have rarely been achieved in these trials. The difference in responses of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients to BCR-ABL inhibitors compared to FLT3 mutant AML patients to FLT3 inhibitors may be reflective of treating a single gene disease in CML versus multiply altered gene disease in AML. This has led to clinical testing of FLT3 TKI in combination with conventional chemotherapy, with trial designs based on preclinical testing showing synergistic effects between these agents in inducing cytotoxic responses. Several combination trials are ongoing or planned in both relapsed and newly diagnosed FLT3-mutant AML patients.",

Although FLT3 inhibitors have shown considerable promise for the treatment of AML, they ultimately fail to achieve long-term remissions as monotherapy. To identify genetic targets that can sensitize AML cells to killing by FLT3 inhibitors, we performed a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi)-based screen that identified ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) as being synthetic lethal with FLT3 inhibitor therapy. We found that inactivating ATM or its downstream effector glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) sensitizes AML cells to FLT3 inhibitor induced apoptosis. Examination of the cellular metabolome showed that FLT3 inhibition by itself causes profound alterations in central carbon metabolism, resulting in impaired production of the antioxidant factor glutathione, which was further impaired by ATM or G6PD inactivation. Moreover, FLT3 inhibition elicited severe mitochondrial oxidative stress that is causative in apoptosis and is exacerbated by ATM/G6PD inhibition. The use of an agent that intensifies mitochondrial oxidative stress in combination with a FLT3 inhibitor augmented elimination of AML cells in vitro and in vivo, revealing a therapeutic strategy for the improved treatment of FLT3 mutated AML.",

FLT3 is not only of utmost interest regarding physiological processes of hematopoietic cells but also with regard to pathological aspects, namely leukemogenesis and diagnosis, prognosis and therapy of leukemia. Activating mutations of the receptor have been recognized as the most common genetic abnormality in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), occurring in about 30% of adult cases.

Subsequent development has brought forth narrow-spectrum inhibitors with potent in-vivo activity and reasonable clinical tolerance, but many patients still progress with prolonged use.;The optimal role for targeting FLT3 may depend on multimodality therapy and will likely require hematopoietic transplant. The incorporation of ABL kinase inhibitors into acute lymphoblastic leukemia management should serve as a model for incorporation of FLT3-targeted agents into clinical care.

Abrogation of Axl activation by soluble Axl chimeric protein (Axl-Fc) or small interfering RNA (siRNA) diminishes constitutive FLT3 phosphorylation in FLT3-ITD(+) AML. In addition, inhibition of Axl activation by Axl-Fc interferes with the physical interaction between Axl and FLT3. We found that Axl-Fc, a pharmacologic Axl inhibitor, or siRNA targeting Axl inhibits cell growth, induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis, and relieves a block in myeloid differentiation of FLT3-ITD(+) AML in vitro. Axl-Fc also suppresses the growth of human FLT3-ITD(+) AML in vivo.

Flt3(ITD) mutations and Tet2 loss cooperatively remodeled DNA methylation and gene expression to an extent not seen with either mutant allele alone, including at the Gata2 locus. Re-expression of Gata2 induced differentiation in AML stem cells and attenuated leukemogenesis.

We analyzed the regulation of LAA in FLT3-wild-type (WT)- and FLT3-ITD(+) myeloid cells to identify potential targets for antigen-specific immunotherapy for AML patients. Antigens, such as PR-3, RHAMM, Survivin, WT-1 and PRAME, were upregulated by constitutively active FLT3-ITD as well as FLT3-WT activated by FLT3 ligand (FL). Cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) clones against PR-3, RHAMM, Survivin and an AML-directed CTL clone recognized AML cell lines and primary AML blasts expressing FLT3-ITD, as well as FLT3-WT(+) myeloid dendritic cells in the presence of FL. Downregulation of FLT3 led to the abolishment of CTL recognition. Comparing our findings concerning LAA upregulation by the FLT3 kinase with those already made for the Bcr-Abl kinase, we found analogies in the LAA expression pattern.

Long-term inhibition of FLT3 activity in these patients has been elusive. To provide a more complete understanding of FLT3 biology, a mass spectroscopy-based screen was performed to search for FLT3-interacting proteins. The screen identified dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (DOCK2), which is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho GTPases, and its expression is limited to hematolymphoid cells. We show that DOCK2 is expressed in leukemia cell lines and primary AML samples, and DOCK2 co-immunoprecipitates with wild-type FLT3 and FLT3/ITD. Knockdown (KD) of DOCK2 by shRNA selectively reduced cell proliferation and colony formation in leukemia cell lines with increased FLT3 activity, and greatly sensitized these cells to cytarabine treatment, alone and in combination with FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors. DOCK2 KD in an FLT3/ITD-positive leukemia cell line also significantly prolonged survival in a mouse xenograft model. These findings suggest that DOCK2 is a potential therapeutic target for novel AML treatments, as this protein regulates the survival of leukemia cells with elevated FLT3 activity and sensitizes FLT3/ITD leukemic cells to conventional antileukemic agents.Leukemia advance online publication, 4 November 2016; doi:10.1038/leu.2016.284.",

Despite promising in vitro studies, where most FLT3 inhibitors show potent efficacy at nanomolar concentrations, clinical responses in AML patients are moderate and temporary. Furthermore, under prolonged therapy, FLT3 mutation-positive leukemic cells rapidly develop resistance to FLT3 inhibitors when used as monotherapy. Considering that there is no uniform mechanism of resistance triggered by FLT3 inhibitors, it will be necessary to develop new agents that target FLT3, and that can be used consecutively or in combination with conventional cytotoxic therapeutics.

Here we show that the mTOR effectors, 4EBP1, p70S6K and rpS6, are highly activated in cultured and primary FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Introduction of FLT3-ITD expressing constitutively activated FLT3 kinase further activates mTOR and its downstream effectors in BaF3 cells. We also found that mTOR signaling contributes to tumor cell survival, as demonstrated by pharmacologic inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR, or total silencing of the mTOR gene. Furthermore, inhibition of FLT3 kinase results in downregulation of mTOR signaling associated with decreased survival of FLT3-mutated AML cells. These findings suggest that mTOR signaling operates downstream of activated FLT3 kinase thus contributing to tumor cell survival, and may represent a promising therapeutic target for AML patients with mutated-FLT3.",

Several FLT3 inhibitors are undergoing investigation, while their clinical efficacies were lower than expected and several resistant mechanisms to FLT3 inhibitors have been demonstrated. Although most AML cells harboring FLT3 mutation co-express wild-type (Wt)-FLT3, it is not fully understood how Wt-FLT3 expression is associated with the resistance to FLT3 inhibitors. In this study, we elucidated a resistant mechanism by which FL-dependent Wt-FLT3 activation reduced inhibitory effects of FLT3 inhibitors. We demonstrated that FL-stimulation much more strongly reduced growth inhibitory effects of FLT3 inhibitors on Wt- and mutant-FLT3 co-expressing cells than sole mutant-FLT3 expressing cells both in vitro and in vivo. It was also confirmed that FL impaired the anti-leukemia effects of FLT3 inhibitors on primary AML cells. We elucidated that FL impeded the inhibitory effects of FLT3 inhibitors mainly through the activation of Wt-FLT3, but not mutated FLT3, in the Wt- and ITD-FLT3 co-expressing cells. Furthermore, FL-induced activation of Wt-FLT3-MAPK axis was the dominant pathway for the resistance, and the glycosylation of Wt-FLT3 was also vital for FL-dependent kinase activation and following resistance to FLT3 inhibitors. Thus, we clarified the importance of co-expressing Wt-FLT3 in resistance to FLT3 inhibitors. These findings provide us with important implications for clinical application and new strategies to improve clinical outcomes of FLT3 inhibitors.",

Among the most commonly mis-spliced genes (>70% of AML patients) were 2, NOTCH2 and FLT3, that encode myeloid cell surface proteins. The splice variants of NOTCH2 and FLT3 resulted from complete or partial exon skipping and utilization of cryptic splice sites. Longitudinal analyses suggested that NOTCH2 and FLT3 aberrant splicing correlated with disease status. Correlation analyses between splice variants of these genes and clinical features of patients showed an association between NOTCH2-Va splice variant and overall survival of patients. Our results suggest that NOTCH2 and FLT3 mis-splicing is a common characteristic of AML and has the potential to generate transcripts encoding proteins with altered function.

Mutation screening of FLT3 exon 20 in AML patients (n = 110) revealed 2 patients with a novel mutation (Y842C) within the highly conserved activation loop of FLT3. FLT3-Y842C-transfected 32D cells showed constitutive FLT3 tyrosine phosphorylation and interleukin 3 (IL-3)-independent growth. Treatment with PKC412 led to inhibition of proliferation and apoptotic cell death. Primary AML blasts bearing FLT3-Y842C mutations showed constitutive FLT3 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT-5) tyrosine phosphorylation. Ex vivo PKC412 treatment of primary blasts resulted in suppression of constitutive FLT3 and STAT-5 activation and apoptotic cell death. Inspection of the FLT3 structure revealed that Y842 is the key residue in regulating the switch from the closed to the open (= active) conformation of the FLT3 activation loop. Overall, our data suggest that mutations at Y842 represent a significant new activating mutation in AML blasts. Since FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as PKC412 are currently being investigated in clinical trials in AML, extended sequence analysis of FLT3 may be helpful in defining the spectrum of TKI-sensitive FLT3 mutations in AML.",

We investigated the interaction of FLT3 and p53 pathways after their simultaneous blockade using the selective FLT3 inhibitor FI-700 and the MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3 in AML. We found that FI-700 immediately reduced antiapoptotic Mcl-1 levels and enhanced Nutlin-induced p53-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis in FLT3/internal tandem duplication cells through the Mcl-1/Noxa axis. FI-700 induced proteasome-mediated degradation of Mcl-1, resulting in the reduced ability of Mcl-1 to sequester proapoptotic Bim. Nutlin-3 induced Noxa, which displaced Bim from Mcl-1. The FI-700/Nutlin-3 combination profoundly activated Bax and induced apoptosis.

G-749 is a novel FLT3 inhibitor that showed potent and sustained inhibition of the FLT3 wild type and mutants including FLT3-ITD, FLT3-D835Y, FLT3-ITD/N676D, and FLT3-ITD/F691L in cellular assays. G-749 retained its inhibitory potency in various drug-resistance milieus such as patient plasma, FLT3 ligand surge, and stromal protection. Furthermore, it displayed potent antileukemic activity in bone marrow blasts from AML patients regardless of FLT3 mutation status, including those with little or only minor responses to AC220 or PKC412. Oral administration of G-749 yielded complete tumor regression and increased life span in animal models. Thus, G-749 appears to be a promising next-generation drug candidate for the treatment of relapsed and refractory AML patients with various FLT3-ITD/FLT3-TKD mutants and further shows the ability to overcome drug resistance.

By correlating the presence of RUNX1 mutations with cytogenetic and molecular aberration in a large cohort of AML M0 (N = 90) at diagnosis, we detected RUNX1 mutations in 46% of cases, with all trisomy 13 cases (n = 18) being affected. No mutations of NRAS or KIT were detected in the RUNX1-mutated group and FLT3 mutations were equally distributed between RUNX1-mutated and unmutated samples. Likewise, a high incidence of RUNX1 mutations (80%) was detected in cases with trisomy 13 from other French-American-British (FAB) subgroups (n = 20). As FLT3 is localized on chromosome 13, we hypothesized that RUNX1 mutations might cooperate with trisomy 13 in leukemogenesis by increasing FLT3 transcript levels. Quantitation of FLT3 transcript levels revealed a highly significant (P < .001) about 5-fold increase in AML with RUNX1 mutations and trisomy 13 compared with samples without trisomy 13.

No data currently exist regarding FLT3 mutations in Southeast Asian patients. In this study, the incidence and type of FLT3 mutation in a large series of Thai AML patients were determined. FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations were observed in 24.6%, FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain mutations in 3.1%, and dual mutations in 2.7% of 256 newly diagnosed Thai AML patients. ITD mutations were mostly restricted to the juxtamembrane domain, and the in-frame ITD length varied from 21 to 201 base pairs. Six types of point mutations were identified, including Asp835Tyr, Asp835His, Asp835Glu, Asp835Ala, Ile836, and a novel mutation, Asp835Del/Ile836Val, which resulted in the loss of aspartic acid and substitution of isoleucine by valine. A rare leukemia karyotype, trisomy 11, was found to coexist with this novel FLT3 mutation, whereas the majority of patients with FLT3 mutations had a normal karyotype. Overall, FLT3 mutation was associated with a significantly higher white blood cell count and older age than the wild-type FLT3. In conclusion, the incidence of FLT3 mutation in Thailand is as high as that of western countries. The clinical significance of the novel mutation requires further studies in a larger population.",

To explore the efficacy of combining a FLT3 inhibitor with standard AML chemotherapy drugs, we tested the effect of combining the FLT3 inhibitor SU11248 with cytarabine or daunorubicin on the proliferation and survival of cell lines expressing either mutant (FLT3 ITD or FLT3 D835V) or wild-type (WT) FLT3. SU11248 had additive-to-synergistic inhibitory effects on FLT3-dependent leukemic cell proliferation when combined with cytarabine or daunorubicin. The synergistic interaction of SU11248 and the traditional antileukemic agents was more pronounced for induction of apoptosis. SU11248 inhibited the proliferation of primary AML myeloblasts expressing mutant FLT3 ITD but not WT FLT3 protein. Combining SU11248 and cytarabine synergistically inhibited the proliferation of primary AML myeloblasts expressing FLT3 ITD but not WT FLT3 protein.

FLT3 is mutated in approximately one-third of cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with normal karyotype. The mutations are most commonly internal tandem duplications found in the juxtamembrane domain of the FLT3 receptor. There are also cases of point mutations within the tyrosine kinase domain. The presence of a FLT3 mutation confers a poorer prognosis in disease-free survival and overall survival. Patients with an FLT3 mutation have poorer outcomes even with a concomitant nucleophosmin1 (NMP1) mutation, which is normally a good prognostic factor. These observations raise the question about how best to treat patients with AML who have FLT3 mutations. There are some retrospective data that allogeneic stem cell transplantation should be offered to patients with FLT3 mutations who have achieved a first remission, but prospective trials are lacking. There are a number of FLT3 inhibitors that are in various stages of clinical testing.

Fourteen of these cases (74%) demonstrated near-complete loss of HLA-DR expression, while the other five cases showed partial loss of HLA-DR. A total of 16 of the cases (84%) demonstrated internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the Flt3 gene. When compared to a selected set of AMLs lacking this nuclear morphology, AML-cuplike was significantly more likely to lack HLA-DR and CD34 expression, to express CD123 without CD133, to have a normal karyotype, and to harbor the Flt3 ITD. To characterize AML-cuplike in an unselected series of AMLs, we analyzed 42 consecutive nonpromyelocytic/nonmonocytic AMLs diagnosed in our laboratory during a 6-month period in 2002. Strikingly, in this unselected series, there was a statistically significant coincidence of invaginated nuclear morphology, loss of HLA-DR, and presence of the Flt3 ITD beyond that expected if these three features were unrelated, suggesting that AMLs with these three features may represent a distinct AML subset.",

The single patient whose blasts failed to differentiate had a preexisting C/EBPα mutation and another developed a C/EBPα mutation at disease progression, suggesting a mechanism of resistance to FLT3 inhibition. In vitro, in primary blasts cocultured with human BM stroma, FLT3 inhibition with quizartinib induced cell-cycle arrest and differentiation rather than apoptosis.

        "Doc_abstract":"Internal tandem duplication in the FLT3 gene (FLT3/ITD), which is found in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), causes resistance to FLT3 inhibitors. We found that RUNX1, a transcription factor that regulates normal hematopoiesis, is up-regulated in patients with FLT3/ITD(+) AML. While RUNX1 can function as a tumor suppressor, recent data have shown that RUNX1 is required for AML cell survival. In the present study, we investigated the functional role of RUNX1 in FLT3/ITD signaling. FLT3/ITD induced growth factor-independent proliferation and impaired G-CSF mediated myeloid differentiation in 32D hematopoietic cells, coincident with up-regulation of RUNX1 expression. Silencing of RUNX1 expression significantly decreased proliferation and secondary colony formation, and partially abrogated the impaired myeloid differentiation of FLT3/ITD(+) 32D cells. Although the number of FLT3/ITD(+) 32D cells declined after incubation with the FLT3/ITD inhibitor AC220, the cells became refractory to AC220, concomitant with up-regulation of RUNX1. Silencing of RUNX1 abrogated the emergence and proliferation of AC220-resistant FLT3/ITD(+) 32D cells in the presence of AC220. Our data indicate that FLT3/ITD deregulates cell proliferation and differentiation and confers resistance to AC220 by up-regulating RUNX1 expression. These findings suggest an oncogenic role for RUNX1 in FLT3/ITD(+) cells and that inhibition of RUNX1 function represents a potential therapeutic strategy in patients with refractory FLT3/ITD(+) AML.

As we speculated that an anomalous organ distribution of AML cells could affect cell survival and thus result in an altered fraction surviving chemotherapy, we examined a possible correlation between patient prognosis and CXCR-4 expression in AML patients. We found that patients with a high CXCR-4 expression in the CD34(+) subset had a significantly reduced survival and a higher probability of relapse, resulting in a median relapse-free survival (RFS) of only 8.3 months. CXCR-4 expression was significantly higher in fetal liver tyrosine kinase-3 (Flt3)/internal tandem duplication (ITD) AML than in Flt3/wild-type (wt) AML. Covariate analysis indicated that the prognostic significance of Flt3/ITDs with respect to RFS was no more apparent when analyzed in conjunction with the expression of CXCR-4 in the CD34(+) subset, suggesting that the poor prognosis of Flt3/ITD AML might be subordinate to the increased CXCR-4 expression. Using a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSF-R)-expressing 32D cell line, we observed that SDF-1/CXCR-4 interaction is required for the survival of myeloid differentiating cells, and it also induces a block in G-CSF-induced myeloid differentiation. These data suggest that the SDF-1/CXCR-4 axis may influence therapy responsiveness and defines unfavorable prognosis in AML.",

Clinical results with FLT3 inhibitor monotherapy have shown that bone marrow responses are commonly less pronounced than peripheral blood responses. We investigated the role of p53 in bone marrow stromal cells in stromal cell-mediated resistance to FLT3 inhibition in FLT3 mutant AML. While the FLT3 inhibitor FI-700 induced apoptosis in FLT3 mutant AML cells, apoptosis induction was diminished under stromal coculture conditions. Protection appeared to be mediated, in part, by CXCL12 (SDF-1)/CXCR4 signaling. The protective effect of stromal cells was significantly reduced by pre-exposure to the HDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3a. p53 activation by Nutlin-3a was not cytotoxic to stromal cells, but reduced CXCL12 mRNA levels and secretion of CXCL12 partially through p53-mediated HIF-1α down-regulation. Results show that p53 activation in stroma cells blunts stroma cell-mediated resistance to FLT3 inhibition, in part through down-regulation of CXCL12. This is the first report of Nutlin effect on the bone marrow environment.

A previous study demonstrated aberrant expression of CD7 on blasts in de novo AML cases with FLT3/ITD mutations. Our study goals are to expand the evaluation of this association to a larger group of patients; to evaluate the association of aberrant CD7 expression in AMLs with D835 mutation, not previously done; to evaluate if aberrant CD7 expression may serve as a surrogate marker for predicting FLT3 mutational status; to evaluate if combined FLT3 with NPM1 mutational status has a better correlation with CD7 expression. The FLT3 mutational analysis was performed on DNA extracted from 149 previously diagnosed AML cases with cytogenetics and flow cytometry evaluation available. Of 149 patients, 28 were positive for FLT3; CD7 was positive in 13 of 20 ITD-positive cases, 5 of 6 D835-positive cases, and 1 of 2 ITD/D835-positive cases. The association of CD7 positivity and FLT3 positivity was found to be significant. However, CD7 expression has a low positive predictive value of 30% and a negative predictive value of 90%. Because of the low positive predictive value, CD7 expression cannot be used as a surrogate marker for FLT3 positivity; even though the negative predictive value is higher, some cases that are FLT3 positive may be missed if CD7 expression would be used for screening.

In this study we show that FLT3 activation inhibits the activity of the tumor suppressor, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Using BaF3 cells transduced with wildtype or mutant FLT3, we show that FLT3-induced PP2A inhibition sensitizes cells to the pharmacological PP2A activators, FTY720 and AAL(S). FTY720 and AAL(S) induced cell death and inhibited colony formation of FLT3 activated cells. Furthermore, PP2A activators reduced the phosphorylation of ERK and AKT, downstream targets shared by both FLT3 and PP2A, in FLT3/ITD+ BaF3 and MV4-11 cell lines. PP2A activity was lower in primary human bone marrow derived AML blasts compared to normal bone marrow, with blasts from FLT3-ITD patients displaying lower PP2A activity than WT-FLT3 blasts. Reduced PP2A activity was associated with hyperphosphorylation of the PP2A catalytic subunit, and reduced expression of PP2A structural and regulatory subunits. AML patient blasts were also sensitive to cell death induced by FTY720 and AAL(S), but these compounds had minimal effect on normal CD34+ bone marrow derived monocytes. Finally, PP2A activating compounds displayed synergistic effects when used in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitors in FLT3-ITD+ cells. A combination of Sorafenib and FTY720 was also synergistic in the presence of a protective stromal microenvironment. Thus combining a PP2A activating compound and a FLT3 inhibitor may be a novel therapeutic approach for treating AML.",

An internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the juxtamembrane (JM) domain-coding sequence of the FLT3 gene (FLT3/ITD) is found in 20% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is strongly associated with leukocytosis and a poor prognosis. On the other hand, mutations of the c-KIT gene, which have been found in mast cell leukemia and AML, are clustered in 2 distinct regions, the JM domain and D816 within the activation loop. This study was designed to analyze the mutation of D835 of FLT3, which corresponds to D816 of c-KIT, in a large series of human hematologic malignancies. Several kinds of missense mutations were found in 30 of the 429 (7.0%) AML cases, 1 of the 29 (3.4%) myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cases, and 1 of the 36 (2.8%) acute lymphocytic leukemia patients. The D835Y mutation was most frequently found (22 of the 32 D835 mutations), followed by the D835V (5), and D835H (1), D835E (1), and D835N (1) mutations. Of note is that D835 mutations occurred independently of FLT3/ITD. An analysis in the 201 patients newly diagnosed with AML (excluding M3) revealed that, in contrast to the FLT3/ITD mutation (n = 46), D835 mutations (n = 8) were not significantly related to the leukocytosis, but tended to worsen disease-free survival. All D835-mutant FLT3 were constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated and transformed 32D cells, suggesting these mutations were constitutively active. These results demonstrate that the FLT3 gene is the target most frequently mutated to become constitutively active in AML.",

Pharmacological targeting of the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway has been shown to promote apoptosis of primary AML cells and to sensitize blasts to neoplastic drugs (Frelin, Blood 2005, 105, 804). The Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), which sustains proliferation of normal hematopoietic progenitors is frequently overexpressed or mutated in AML patients. Using Ba/F3 murine pre-B cells transfected with various mutants of FLT3 (ITD, D835V, D835Y) and the MV4-11 human AML line, we show that normal or oncogenic stimulation of FLT3 led to activation of NF-kappaB. Pharmacological inhibition of either FLT3 with AG1296 or NF-kappaB with the small molecule inhibitor of IkappaB kinase-2 AS602868 reduced viability and triggered cell death. Moreover, AS602868 was also found to interfere directly with FLT3 kinase activation. AS602868 thus appears to target two different kinases that play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AML, making it particularly attractive as a new therapeutical approach for AML.",

Here, we report the co-crystal structure of the kinase domain of FLT3 in complex with quizartinib. FLT3 with quizartinib bound adopts an \"Abl-like\" inactive conformation with the activation loop stabilized in the \"DFG-out\" orientation and folded back onto the kinase domain. This conformation is similar to that observed for the uncomplexed intracellular domain of FLT3 as well as for related receptor tyrosine kinases, except for a localized induced fit in the activation loop. The co-crystal structure reveals the interactions between quizartinib and the active site of FLT3 that are key for achieving its high potency against both wild-type FLT3 as well as a FLT3 variant observed in many AML patients. This co-complex further provides a structural rationale for quizartinib-resistance mutations. ",

Therefore, targeting mutated FLT3 is an attractive therapeutic strategy, and early clinical trials testing FLT3 TK inhibitors (TKI) showed measurable clinical responses. Most of these responses were transient; however, in a subset of patients blast recurrence was preceded by an interval of prolonged remission. The etiology of clinical resistance to FLT3-TKI in AML is unclear but is of major significance for the development of future therapeutic strategies. We searched for mechanisms of resistance in 6 patients with AML who had relapses upon PKC412 treatment. In an index AML patient, an algorithm of analyses was applied using clinical material. In vivo and in vitro investigation of primary blasts at relapse revealed persistent TK phosphorylation of FLT3 despite sufficient PKC412 serum levels. Through additional molecular analyses, we identified a single amino acid substitution at position 676 (N676K) within the FLT3 kinase domain as the sole cause of resistance to PKC412 in this patient. Reconstitution experiments expressing the N676K mutant in 32D cells demonstrated that FLT3-ITD-N676K was sufficient to confer an intermediate level of resistance to PKC412 in vitro.

STAT5 and ERK1/2, downstream targets of FLT3 in the signaling pathway, are inhibited in response to FLT3 inhibition. In primary leukemia blasts from AML patients harboring FLT3/ITD mutations, FLT3 is also inhibited, with an associated cytotoxic response.

We determined that a regulator of Dnmts, miR-29b, is downregulated in bone marrow of dKI AML mice. Bortezomib exerted a dose-dependent increase in miR-29b expression in AML blasts ex vivo, followed by decreased Dnmts, reduced proliferation, and increased apoptosis. In vivo, bortezomib was not active against dKI AML, yet liposomal-encapsulated bortezomib, as a single agent, reversed downregulation of miR-29b in vivo and induced a long-term (90-day) disease-free remission in 80% of dKI AML mice that exhibited high leukemic burden at the start of therapy, yet showed no signs of relapse at autopsy.

We hypothesized that other novel mutations of FLT3 could also contribute to leukemogenesis. We genotyped 109 cases of AML and identified two novel gain-of-function mutations. The first mutation, N841 H, is similar to previously described mutations involving amino-acid substitutions of codon 841. The other novel mutation, FLT3 K663Q, is the first AML-associated gain-of-function mutation located outside the JM and AL domains. Of note, this mutation was potently inhibited by Sunitinib (SU11248), a previously described FLT3 kinase inhibitor. Sunitinib reduced the proliferation and induced apoptosis of transformed Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3 K663Q. The potency of Sunitinib against FLT3 K663Q was similar to its potency against FLT3 ITD mutations. We conclude that FLT3 mutations in AML can involve novel regions of the TK1.

Such AML subtypes are known to be associated with unfavorable prognosis. To treat FLT3-overexpressing AML, we developed a novel targeted nanoparticle system: FLT3 ligand (FLT3L)-conjugated G7 poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) nanosized dendriplex encapsulating miR-150, a pivotal tumor suppressor and negative regulator of FLT3 We show that the FLT3L-guided miR-150 nanoparticles selectively and efficiently target FLT3-overexpressing AML cells and significantly inhibit viability/growth and promote apoptosis of the AML cells. Our proof-of-concept animal model studies demonstrate that the FLT3L-guided miR-150 nanoparticles tend to concentrate in bone marrow, and significantly inhibit progression of FLT3-overexpressing AML in vivo, while exhibiting no obvious side effects on normal hematopoiesis.

There are several FLT3 inhibitors presently in clinical trials with sufficient efficacy and toxicity features to warrant further testing in combination with standard therapies. However, the transient and partial responses observed in AML patients treated with FLT3 inhibitors, coupled with the discovery of drug-resistant leukemic blast cells in AML patients, have made resistance to FLT3 inhibitors a growing concern. In this study, we provide an overview of the role of mutant FLT3 in AML, FLT3 inhibitors under clinical and preclinical investigation, mechanisms of resistance to FLT3 inhibitors, and possible therapeutic approaches to overcoming this resistance.",

After excluding patients with FLT3 internal tandem duplications, we compared treatment outcome of 16 de novo CN-AML patients with FLT3-TKD with that of 123 patients with wild-type FLT3 (FLT3-WT), less than 60 years of age and similarly treated on Cancer and Leukemia Group B protocols. All FLT3-TKD(+) patients and 85% of FLT3-WT patients achieved a complete remission (P = .13). Disease-free survival (DFS) of FLT3-TKD(+) patients was worse than DFS of FLT3-WT patients (P = .01; estimated 3-year DFS rates, 31% vs 60%, respectively). In a multivariable analysis, FLT3-TKD was associated with worse DFS (P = .02) independent of NPM1 status and percentage of bone marrow blasts. To gain further biologic insights, a gene-expression signature differentiating FLT3-TKD(+) from FLT3-WT patients was identified. The signature (333 probe sets) included overexpression of VNN1, C3AR1, PTPN6, and multiple other genes involved in monocarboxylate transport activity, and underexpression of genes involved in signal transduction regulation. These associations with outcome, other prognostic markers, and the elucidated expression signature enhance our understanding of FLT3-TKD-associated biology and may lead to development of novel therapies that improve clinical outcome of CN-AML patients with FLT3-TKD.",

The FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) and the D835 activating mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the genomic DNA of Korean patients with AML at diagnosis and during follow-up. There were 226 patients with AML enrolled between March 1996 and August 2005. The incidence of ITD and TKD at diagnosis was 13% (29/226) and 3% (6/226). When compared to Western and other Asian patients with AML, Korean patients had a lower frequency by about two-thirds of ITD and TKD. Among the non-M3 cases (N=203), the patients with an ITD had a significantly shorter event-free survival when compared with those without an ITD (p=0.0079). Among 54 relapsed patients, 9 patients had the FLT3 ITD at diagnosis. Six patients demonstrated a reappearance of the ITD and 3 patients remained negative at relapse. One patient, among 45 patients who relapsed, had a negative baseline ITD but acquired a de novo ITD at relapse. There were 101 samples from 93 patients in remission; they were all negative for an ITD. Among 34 patients who failed to achieve a remission, five patients had a persistent ITD and one patient had a de novo ITD. These results support the concept of resistance of FLT3 ITD leukemic clones to chemotherapy. Therefore, effective therapy with FLT3 targeting agents may improve the prognosis of non-M3 AML patients with the FLT3 mutation.",

All but one of the FLT3 (46 of 47) mutations were internal tandem duplications (ITDs) within exons 11 and 12. In the remaining case, a novel internal tandem triplication was found in exon 11. FLT3 ITDs were associated with higher white blood cell counts, higher peripheral blast percentages, normal cytogenetics, and less disease resistance. All RAS mutations (28 of 28) were missense point mutations in codons 12, 13, or 61. RAS mutations were associated with lower peripheral blast and bone marrow blast percentages. Only 2 of 47 patients with FLT3 ITDs also had a RAS mutation, indicating a significant negative association between FLT3 and RAS mutations (P =.0013). Most TP53 mutations (11 of 12) were missense point mutations in exons 5 to 8 and were associated with abnormal cytogenetics, especially abnormalities in both chromosomes 5 and 7. FLT3 and RAS mutations were not associated with inferior clinical outcomes, but TP53 mutations were associated with a worse overall survival (median 1 versus 8 months, P =.0007).

Arsenic trioxide (ATO) and MEK inhibition were recently reported to interact synergistically to induce apoptosis in AML cells. In this study, we aimed to clarify whether ATO and Flt3 inhibition would be a more specific and efficient therapy for Flt3-ITD cells. We demonstrate that the combination of ATO and an Flt3 inhibitor, AG1296, profoundly inhibits the growth of Flt3-ITD cells and induces their apoptosis. We further revealed that this combined treatment potently inhibits the ERK activity that might be responsible for cell growth. Moreover, using the Chou-Talalay method, we observed a synergistic growth-inhibitory effect for ATO and AG1296 in Flt3-ITD cells (BaF3-Flt3-ITD, MV4-11, and PL-21 cells), but not in Flt3 wild-type cells (RS4-11 and NB4 cells), for almost all dose ranges tested.

These mutations occur in the juxtamembrane (FLT3 length mutations; FLT3-LMs) and the second tyrosine kinase domain of FLT3-TKD and confer interleukin 3 (IL-3)-independent growth to Ba/F3 cells. In the mouse bone marrow transplantation model, FLT3-LMs induce a myeloproliferative syndrome stressing their transforming activity in vivo. In this study, we analyzed the pro-proliferative and antiapoptotic potential of FLT3 in FLT3-LM/TKD-mutation-transformed Ba/F3 cells and AML-derived cell lines. The PTK inhibitor SU5614 has inhibitory activity for FLT3 and selectively induces growth arrest, apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest in Ba/F3 and AML cell lines expressing a constitutively activated FLT3. In addition, the compound reverts the antiapoptotic and pro-proliferative activity of FLT3 ligand (FL) in FL-dependent cells. No cytotoxic activity of SU5614 was found in leukemic cell lines that express a nonactivated FLT3 or no FLT3 protein. At the biochemical level, SU5614 down-regulated the activity of the hyperphosphorylated FLT3 receptor and its downstream targets, signal transducer and activator of (STAT) 3, STAT5, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and the STAT5 target genes BCL-X(L) and p21. Our results show that SU5614 is a PTK inhibitor of FLT3 and has antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity in AML-derived cell lines that endogenously express an activated FLT3 receptor.

An FLT3 inhibitor (PKC412) inhibited the growth of Ba/F3-FLT3N841I cells (IC(50) 10 nM), but not of wild-type Ba/F3 cells cultured with IL-3. PKC412 also reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of the mutant receptor and inhibited STAT5 phosphorylation. Examination of the FLT3 autoinhibited structure showed that N841 is the key residue in a hydrogen-bonding network that likely stabilizes the activation loop. These results suggest that mutations at N841 represent a significant new activating mutation in patients with AML and that patients with such mutations may respond to small-molecule FLT3 inhibitors such as PKC412.",

The presence of FLT3 mutations confers a poor prognosis. Thus, pharmacological inhibitors of FLT3 are of therapeutic interest for AML. Gö6976 is an indolocarbazole with a similar structural backbone to staurosporine. In the present study, we demonstrated that Gö6976 displays a potent inhibitory activity against recombinant FLT3 using an in vitro kinase assay, with an IC50 value of 0.7nM. Gö6976 markedly inhibited the proliferation of human leukemia cells having FLT3-ITD such as MV4-11 and MOLM13. We also observed that Gö6976 showed minimal toxicity for human normal CD34(+) cells. Gö6976 suppressed the phosphorylation of FLT3 and downstream signaling molecules such as STAT3/5, Erk1/2, and Akt in MV4-11 and MOLM13 cells. Interestingly, induction of apoptosis by Gö6976 was associated with rapid and pronounced down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein survivin and MCL-1. Suppression of survivin protein expression by Gö6976 was due to the inhibition of transcription via the suppression of STAT3/5. On the other hand, Gö6976 induced proteasome-mediated degradation of MCL-1. Previously described FLT3 inhibitors such as PKC412 are bound by the human plasma protein, α1-acid glycoprotein, resulting in diminished inhibitory activity against FLT3. In contrast, we found that Gö6976 potently inhibited phosphorylation of FLT3 and exerted cytotoxicity in the presence of human serum. In conclusion, Gö6976 is a potent FLT3 inhibitor that displays a significant antiproliferative activity against leukemia cells with FLT3-ITD through the profound down-regulation of survivin and MCL-1.

The data show that approximately 25% (6 of 25) of hyperdiploid ALL samples possess FLT3 mutations, whereas only 1 of 29 TEL/AML1-rearranged samples harbored mutations (P =.04, Fisher exact test). Three mutations are novel in-frame deletions within a 7-amino acid region of the receptor juxtamembrane domain. Finally, 3 samples from patients whose disease would relapse harbored FLT3 mutations.

Therefore, a deeper understanding of FLT3 signaling will facilitate identification of additional pharmacological targets in FLT3-driven AML. In this report, we identify HOXB2 and HOXB3 as novel regulators of oncogenic FLT3-ITD-driven AML. We show that HOXB2 and HOXB3 expression is upregulated in a group of AML patients carrying FLT3-ITD. Overexpression of HOXB2 or HOXB3 in mouse pro-B cells resulted in decreased FLT3-ITD-dependent cell proliferation as well as colony formation and increased apoptosis. Expression of HOXB2 or HOXB3 resulted in a significant decrease in FLT3-ITD-induced AKT, ERK, p38 and STAT5 phosphorylation.

A recent study suggested that NOD/LtSz-scid IL2Rgammac null (NSG) mice have enhanced AML cell engraftment, but this relied on technically challenging neonatal injections. Here, we performed extensive analysis of AML engraftment in adult NSG mice using tail vein injection. Of the 35 AML samples analyzed, 66% showed bone marrow engraftment over 0.1%. Further, 37% showed high levels of engraftment (>10%), with some as high as 95%. A 2-44-fold expansion of AML cells was often seen. Secondary and tertiary recipients showed consistent engraftment, with most showing further AML cell expansion. Engraftment did not correlate with French-American-British subtype or cytogenetic abnormalities. However, samples with FLT3 mutations showed a higher probability of engraftment than FLT3 wild type. Importantly, animals developed organomegaly and a wasting illness consistent with advanced leukemia.

The juxtamembrane mutation of FLT3 is the strongest independent marker for disease relapse and is associated with elevated Bcl-2 protein and p53 hyper-phosphorylation in AML. DNA damage forms the basic mechanism of cancer cell eradication in current therapy of AML. Hdm2 and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 members are among the most intensely induced genes immediately after chemotherapy and Hdm2 is proposed a role in receptor tyrosine kinase regulation. Thus we examined the DNA damage related modulation of these proteins in relation to FLT3 mutational status and induction of apoptosis.;Within one hour after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), the AML cells (NB4, MV4-11, HL-60, primary AML cells) showed an increase in Flt3 protein independent of mRNA levels, while the Hdm2 protein decreased. The FLT3 mutant MV4-11 cells were resistant to IR accompanied by presence of both Mcl-1 and Hdm2 protein three hours after IR. In contrast, the FLT3 wild type NB4 cells responded to IR with apoptosis and pre-apoptotic Mcl-1 down regulation. Daunorubicin (DNR) induced continuing down regulation of Hdm2 and Mcl-1 in both cell lines followed by apoptosis.;Both IR and DNR treatment resulted in concerted protein modulations of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3. Cell death induction was associated with persistent attenuation of Mcl-1 and Hdm2. These observations suggest that defining the pathway(s) modulating Flt3, Hdm2 and Mcl-1 may propose new strategies to optimize therapy for the relapse prone FLT3 mutated AML patients.",

Here, we review the functions, signaling activities, mechanism of transformation, and therapeutic targeting of two prototypic tyrosine kinase oncogenes, BCR-ABL and FLT3, associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), respectively. BCR-ABL is generated by the Philadelphia chromosome translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, creating a chimeric oncogene in which the BCR and c-ABL genes are fused. The product of this oncogene, BCR-ABL, has elevated ABL tyrosine kinase activity and transforms hematopoietic cells by exerting a wide variety of biological effects, including reduction in growth factor dependence, enhanced viability, and altered adhesion of chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) cells. Elevated tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL is critical for activating downstream signalling cascades and for all aspects of transformation, explaining the remarkable clinical efficacy of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate (STI571). By comparison, FLT3 is mutated in about one third of all cases of AML, most often through a mechanism that involves an internal tandem duplication (ITD) of a small number of amino acid residues in the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor. As is the case for BCR-ABL, these mutations activate the kinase activity constitutively, activate multiple signaling pathways, and result in an augmentation of proliferation and viability. Transformation by FLT3-ITD can readily be observed in murine models, and FLT3 cooperates with other types of oncogenes to create a fully transformed acute leukemia. FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors are currently being evaluated in clinical trials and may be very useful therapeutic agents in AML.",

We report that AKN-028, a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is a potent FMS-like receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitor (IC(50)=6 nM), causing dose-dependent inhibition of FLT3 autophosphorylation. Inhibition of KIT autophosphorylation was shown in a human megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line overexpressing KIT. In a panel of 17 cell lines, AKN-028 showed cytotoxic activity in all five AML cell lines included. AKN-028 triggered apoptosis in MV4-11 by activation of caspase 3. In primary AML samples (n=15), AKN-028 induced a clear dose-dependent cytotoxic response (mean IC(50) 1 μM). However, no correlation between antileukemic activity and FLT3 mutation status, or to the quantitative expression of FLT3, was observed. Combination studies showed synergistic activity when cytarabine or daunorubicin was added simultaneously or 24 h before AKN-028. In mice, AKN-028 demonstrated high oral bioavailability and antileukemic effect in primary AML and MV4-11 cells, with no major toxicity observed in the experiment. In conclusion, AKN-028 is a novel TKI with significant preclinical antileukemic activity in AML. Possible sequence-dependent synergy with standard AML drugs and good oral bioavailability has made it a candidate drug for clinical trials (ongoing).",

TG02 is anti-proliferative in a broad range of tumor cell lines, inducing G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Primary cultures of progenitor cells derived from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and polycythemia vera patients are very sensitive to TG02. Comparison with reference inhibitors that block only one of the main targets of TG02 demonstrate the benefit of combined CDK and JAK2/FLT3 inhibition in cell lines as well as primary cells. In vivo, TG02 exhibits favorable pharmacokinetics after oral dosing in xenograft models and accumulates in tumor tissues, inducing an effective blockade of both CDK and STAT signaling.

Internal tandem duplication (ITD) and also point mutations affecting aspartic acid 835 (D835) are reported. A previous study demonstrated aberrant expression of CD7 on blasts in de novo AML cases with FLT3/ITD mutations. Our study goals are to expand the evaluation of this association to a larger group of patients; to evaluate the association of aberrant CD7 expression in AMLs with D835 mutation, not previously done; to evaluate if aberrant CD7 expression may serve as a surrogate marker for predicting FLT3 mutational status; to evaluate if combined FLT3 with NPM1 mutational status has a better correlation with CD7 expression. The FLT3 mutational analysis was performed on DNA extracted from 149 previously diagnosed AML cases with cytogenetics and flow cytometry evaluation available. Of 149 patients, 28 were positive for FLT3; CD7 was positive in 13 of 20 ITD-positive cases, 5 of 6 D835-positive cases, and 1 of 2 ITD/D835-positive cases. The association of CD7 positivity and FLT3 positivity was found to be significant. However, CD7 expression has a low positive predictive value of 30% and a negative predictive value of 90%. Because of the low positive predictive value, CD7 expression cannot be used as a surrogate marker for FLT3 positivity; even though the negative predictive value is higher, some cases that are FLT3 positive may be missed if CD7 expression would be used for screening.",

Recent researches reveal a role of FLT3 in monocyte differentiation in hematopoiesis. We analyzed the clinical impact of FLT3 alterations in adult AML patients excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) who received induction chemotherapy according to morphologic classification. Retrospective review of medical records from three centers in Korea between 1997 and 2007 was performed. Polymerase chain reaction was performed on genomic DNA derived from blood samples of patients before induction chemotherapy for FLT3-ITD detection. We assessed overall survival (OS), first disease-free survival (1-DFS), and response to induction chemotherapy. One hundred eighty-four patients (median age 49.1 years, range 16.0-76.5) with AML excluding APL received induction chemotherapy from three centers. FLT3-ITD was detected in 22 patients. One hundred forty-one patients were below age 60. One hundred seventy-nine patients received induction chemotherapy with cytarabine and idarubicin (AId) regimen. One hundred nineteen patients achieved complete remission (CR) after first induction chemotherapy. FLT3-ITD was not related to achievement of CR. 1-DFS was longer in patients without FLT3-ITD (median 1-DFS 16.5 vs. 8.5 months, p = 0.025). 1-DFS was not different according to FLT3-ITD status in nonmonocyte lineage leukemia (p = 0.355), while 1-DFS was shorter in monocyte lineage leukemia for FLT3-ITD positive patients (20.9 vs. 2.4 months, p < 0.001). FLT3-ITD had no impact on OS except for monocyte lineage, where OS was significantly shorter in FLT3-ITD positive group (39.4 vs. 6.0 months, p = 0.026). Moreover FLT3-ITD was stronger prognostic factors in monocyte lineage AML than risk stratification based on cytogenetics. Status of FLT3-ITD should be analyzed differently in AML patients according to morphologic profile. FLT3-ITD is a predictive and prognostic marker only in monocyte lineage patients. This result suggests an existence of distinct subset of monocyte lineage AML with leukemogenesis involving FLT3 activating pathway.",

In addition, 25% of AML patients harbour a FLT3-ITD mutation, associated with inferior outcome due to increased relapse rate. Relapse might be propagated by interactions between AML blasts and the bone marrow microenvironment. Besides cellular elements of the microenvironment (e.g. mesenchymal stromal cells), bone marrow hypoxia has emerged as an additional crucial component. Hence, effects of hypoxia on FLT3 expression and biology could provide novel insight into AML biology. Here we show that 25% of AML patients down-regulate FLT3 expression on blasts in response to in vitro hypoxia (1% O2), which was independent of its mutational state. While virtually no AML cell lines regulate FLT3 in response to hypoxia, the down-regulation could be observed in Ba/F3 cells stably transfected with different FLT3 mutants. Hypoxia-mediated down-regulation was specific for FLT3, reversible and proteasome-dependent; with FLT3 half-life being significantly shorter at hypoxia. Also, PI-3K inhibition could partially abrogate down-regulation of FLT3. Hypoxia-mediated down-regulation of FLT3 conferred resistance against cytarabine in vitro. In conclusion, FLT3 expression in AML is dependent on the oxygen partial pressure, but response to hypoxia differs. ",

Single cell network profiling (SCNP) is a multiparametric flow cytometry based assay that simultaneously measures, in a quantitative fashion and at the single cell level, both extracellular surface marker levels and changes in intracellular signaling proteins in response to extracellular modulators. We previously reported an initial characterization of FLT3 ITD-mediated signaling using SCNP. Herein SCNP was applied sequentially to two separate cohorts of samples collected from elderly AML patients at diagnosis. In the first (training) study, AML samples carrying unmutated, wild-type FLT3 (FLT3 WT) displayed a wide range of induced signaling, with a fraction having signaling profiles comparable to FLT3 ITD AML samples. Conversely, the FLT3 ITD AML samples displayed more homogeneous induced signaling, with the exception of patients with low (<40%) mutational load, which had profiles comparable to FLT3 WT AML samples. This observation was then confirmed in an independent (verification) cohort. Data from the second cohort were also used to assess the association between SCNP data and disease-free survival (DFS) in the context of FLT3 and nucleophosmin (NPM1) mutational status among patients who achieved complete remission (CR) to induction chemotherapy. The combination of SCNP read outs together with FLT3 and NPM1 molecular status improved the DFS prediction accuracy of the latter.

However, responses are not durable and resistance develops within months. In this study, we outline a two-step model of resistance whereby extrinsic microenvironmental proteins FLT3 ligand (FL) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) protect FLT3-ITD+ MOLM14 cells from AC220, providing time for subsequent accumulation of ligand-independent resistance mechanisms. FL directly attenuated AC220 inhibition of FLT3, consistent with previous reports. Conversely, FGF2 promoted resistance through activation of FGFR1 and downstream MAPK effectors; these resistant cells responded synergistically to combinatorial inhibition of FGFR1 and FLT3. Removing FL or FGF2 from ligand-dependent resistant cultures transiently restored sensitivity to AC220, but accelerated acquisition of secondary resistance via reactivation of FLT3 and RAS/MAPK signaling. FLT3-ITD AML patients treated with AC220 developed increased FGF2 expression in marrow stromal cells, which peaked prior to overt clinical relapse and detection of resistance mutations. Overall, these results support a strategy of early combination therapy to target early survival signals from the bone marrow microenvironment, in particular FGF2, to improve the depth of response in FLT3-ITD AML.

The plasma inhibitory activity (PIA) for FLT3 correlates with clinical activity in patients treated with CEP-701 and PKC412. Using the PIA assay, along with in vitro phosphorylation and cytotoxicity assays in leukemia cells, we compared PKC412 and its metabolite, CGP52421, with CEP-701. While both drugs could effectively inhibit FLT3 in vitro, CEP-701 was more cytotoxic to primary samples at comparable levels of FLT3 inhibition. PKC412 appears to be more selective than CEP-701 and therefore less effective at inducing cytotoxicity in primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples in vitro. However, the PKC412 metabolite CGP52421 is less selective than its parent compound, PKC412, and is more cytotoxic against primary blast samples at comparable levels of FLT3 inhibition. The plasma inhibitory activity assay represents a useful correlative tool in the development of small-molecule inhibitors. Our application of this assay has revealed that the metabolite CGP52421 may contribute a significant portion of the antileukemia activity observed in patients receiving oral PKC412.

PKC412 elicits massive apoptosis without markedly affecting cell cycle patterns in AML cell lines with FLT3 mutations (MV4-11 and MOLM13), whereas it induces G2 arrest but not apoptosis in AML cell lines without FLT3 mutations (THP-1 and U937). In MV4-11 and MOLM13 cells, PKC412 inactivates Myt-1 and activates CDC25c, leading to the activation of CDC2. Activated CDC2 phosphorylates Bad at serine-128 and facilitates its translocation to the mitochondria, where Bad triggers apoptosis. In contrast, PKC412 inactivates CDC2 by inducing serine-216 phosphorylation and subsequent cytoplasmic sequestration of CDC25c in THP-1 and U937 cells. As a result, cells are arrested in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, but do not undergo apoptosis because Bad is not activated.

The results were examined based on a comparison with previously known prognostic factors, and the treatment outcomes analyzed according to the existence of the mutations in relation to the event free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), and complete remission (CR) rates.;D835 and IDT mutations were detected in 4.7% (4/84) and 19.0% (16/84), respectively, of the AML patients.

The EFS and OS rates were also significantly lower in the FLT3 gene mutation group, especially in AML with normal karyotypes.;FLT3 gene mutations were observed in 23.8% of AML patients and appeared to have a prognostic implication on patient survival. Accordingly, the presence of FLT3 gene mutations, which could be tested easily by using PCR/RFLP methods, should be investigated routinely at the time of diagnosis.",

In the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), the JAK2V617F alone cannot explain the phenotypic heterogeneity. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), clinical variability exists within distinct subgroups. Thus, the search for novel molecular markers continues. Recently, mutations of the tet oncogene family member 2 (TET2) and Casitas B-cell lymphoma (CBL) genes became the focus of interest. With diverse genetic methods, TET2 on chromosome 4q24 was identified as candidate tumor suppressor gene. Sequencing studies revealed heterogeneous mutations in 10-25% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), MDS, and MPNs, while the frequency might be higher in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). The prognostic impact is being explored. The CBL gene is involved in the degradation of tyrosine kinases. In rare cases of human AML (<2%), CBL mutants were identified, with a higher frequency in core binding factor leukemias. Presence of these mutations was suggested to be involved in aberrant FLT3 expression. In the MPNs, a 2-8% frequency of CBL mutations was reported. These novel mutations deepened insights in the mechanisms of leukemogenesis, might contribute to the identification of new therapeutic targets, and improve diagnostics in the myeloid malignancies.",

We investigated the association between this phenotype and hematologic findings, disease markers, and mutations in NPM1 exon 12, FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD), and tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) genes. Cup-like nuclei were found in 44 patients (21.2 %) diagnosed with AML.

However, FLT3-ITD or TKD mutation alone (nine cases, p = 0.228) was not associated, and NPM1 mutation alone (14 cases, p = 0.036) was weakly associated with cup-like nuclei. Mutation of both NPM1 and FLT3-ITD or TKD (17 cases, p < 0.001) was strongly correlated with the cup-like nuclear morphology.

We demonstrate that statins can impair FLT3 glycosylation, thus leading to loss of surface expression and induction of cell death, as well as mitigation of TKI resistance. Immunofluorescence microscopy confirms a reduction in surface localization and an increase in intracellular FLT3/internal tandem duplication (ITD) accumulation. This aberrant localization was associated with increased STAT5 activation but inhibition of both MAPK and AKT phosphorylation. Growth inhibition studies indicate that FLT3/ITD-expressing cells were killed with an IC(50) within a range of 0.2-2μM fluvastatin. Several mechanisms of resistance could be circumvented by fluvastatin treatment. An increase in the IC(50) for inhibition of phosphorylated FLT3/ITD by lestaurtinib caused by exogenous FLT3 ligand, resistance to sorafenib caused by the D835Y or FLT3/ITD N676K mutations, and activation of the IL-3 compensatory pathway were all negated by fluvastatin treatment. Finally, fluvastatin treatment in vivo reduced engraftment of BaF3 FLT3/ITD cells in Balb/c mice.

RNA interference and MTS assays were used to study the interaction of PKC412, FLT3 inhibitor and TGFβ1.;A direct relationship between FLT3 activity and DLX1/2 expression was revealed by both inhibition and up-regulation of FLT3 signaling in MV4;11 and RS4;11 cell lines, respectively, in isolated blast cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia, and in reverse-phase protein array assays of samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Mechanistically, the link between FLT3 and DLX1 expression appears to involve MAPK signaling through the ERK and JNK pathways. To determine whether elevated DLX1 had a functional consequence, we explored the reported inhibition by DLX1 on TGFβ/Smad signaling. Indeed, TGFβ responses were blunted by FLT3 activation in a DLX1-dependent manner and FLT3 inhibition resulted in a time-dependent increase in nuclear phospho-Smad2.;These findings suggest that alterations in DLX1/2 contribute to the biological consequences of FLT3 activation.",

Twelve patients showed clearance or near clearance of bone marrow myeloblasts after 27 (range 21-84) days with evidence of differentiation of leukemia cells. The sorafenib response was lost in most patients after 72 (range 54-287) days but the FLT3 and downstream effectors remained suppressed. Gene expression profiling showed that leukemia cells that have become sorafenib resistant expressed several genes including ALDH1A1, JAK3, and MMP15, whose functions were unknown in AML. Nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice transplanted with leukemia cells from patients before and during sorafenib resistance recapitulated the clinical results. Both ITD and tyrosine kinase domain mutations at D835 were identified in leukemia initiating cells (LICs) from samples before sorafenib treatment. LICs bearing the D835 mutant have expanded during sorafenib treatment and dominated during the subsequent clinical resistance.

Our analysis revealed that there are distinct subtypes of t-AML that have a characteristic gene expression pattern. Common to each of the subgroups are gene expression patterns typical of arrested differentiation in early progenitor cells. Leukemias with a -5/del(5q) have a higher expression of genes involved in cell cycle control (CCNA2, CCNE2, CDC2), checkpoints (BUB1), or growth (MYC), and loss of expression of the gene encoding IFN consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP). A second subgroup of t-AML is characterized by down-regulation of transcription factors involved in early hematopoiesis (TAL1, GATA1, and EKLF) and overexpression of proteins involved in signaling pathways in myeloid cells (FLT3) and cell survival (BCL2).

Recent work has shown that FLT3 activating mutations can collaborate with a Nup98-HoxD13 mutation to induce an aggressive acute leukemia. The leukemic initiating population in this model displayed properties of both lymphoid and myeloid precursors, making it a useful tool to study the role of FLT3 in lineage plasticity. Through a variety of assays, the leukemic initiating population was shown to be restricted to myeloid differentiation, suggesting that the B-lineage properties in these cells are due to the priming of lymphoid transcription programs in multipotent progenitors rather than a true capacity for B-cell maturation. The development of an undifferentiated myeloid leukemia in this model, also has implications for the role of FLT3 in the inhibition of myeloid differentiation.

In this study, we investigated in both subcutaneous and orthotopic AML mouse models, the mechanisms of action of three FLT3 and/or CDK4/6 inhibitors: AMG925 (Amgen), sorafenib (Bayer and Onyx), and quizartinib (Ambit Biosciences). A composite model was developed to integrate the plasma pharmacokinetics of these three compounds on their respective molecular targets, the coupling between the target pathways, as well as the resulting effects on tumor burden reduction in the subcutaneous xenograft model. A sequential modeling approach was used, wherein model structures and estimated parameters from upstream processes (e.g. PK, cellular signaling) were fixed for modeling subsequent downstream processes (cellular signaling, tumor burden). Pooled data analysis was employed for the plasma PK and cellular signaling modeling, while population modeling was applied to the tumor burden modeling. The resulting model allows the decomposition of the relative contributions of FLT3(ITD) and CDK4/6 inhibition on downstream signaling and tumor burden.

However, the prevalence and prognostic impact of RTK aberrations in pediatric t(8;21) AML remains undetermined. Here, we found the kinase domain mutations of the KIT gene in 8 (17.4%) of 46 patients with t(8;21) AML among newly diagnosed pediatric patients with AML treated on the AML99 protocol in Japan. Significant differences between patients with or without KIT mutations were observed in the 4-year overall survival (50.0% versus 97.4%, P = .001), disease-free survival (37.5% versus 94.7%, P < .001) and relapse rate (47.0% versus 2.7%, P < .001). Furthermore, FLT3 internal tandem duplication was found in only 2 (4.3%) patients. These results suggested that KIT mutations are strongly associated with a poor prognosis in pediatric t(8;21) AML.",

In humans, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) express MCL-1 at the highest level in response to FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) signaling. We here show that this FLT3-dependent stem cell maintenance system also plays a critical role in survival of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The CD34(+)CD38(-) LSC fraction expresses high levels of FLT3 as well as MCL-1, even compared with normal HSCs. Treatment with FLT3 ligand induced further MCL-1 up-regulation in LSCs in all AML cases tested. Interestingly, the group of samples expressing the highest levels of MCL-1 constituted AML with FLT3-internal tandem duplications (ITD). In FLT3-ITD AML cell lines, cells expressed a high level of MCL-1, and an inhibition of MCL-1 induced their apoptotic cell death. A tyrosine kinase inhibitor suppressed MCL-1 expression, and induced apoptosis that was reversed by the enforced MCL-1 expression. Finally, transduction of FLT3-ITD into HSCs strongly activated MCL-1 expression through its signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5)-docking domains. This effect was completely abrogated when STAT5 activation was blocked. Thus, the acquisition of FLT3-ITD ensures LSC survival by up-regulating MCL-1 via constitutive STAT5 activation that is independent of wild-type FLT3 signaling.",

This study aimed to discover if clonal evolution from heterozygous to homozygous mutations by mitotic recombination provides a mechanism for relapse. DNA from 27 paired diagnostic and relapsed AML samples were analyzed using genotyping arrays. Newly acquired segmental UPDs were observed at relapse in 11 AML samples (40%). Six were segmental UPDs of chromosome 13q, which were shown to lead to a change from heterozygosity to homozygosity for internal tandem duplication mutation of FLT3 (FLT3 ITD). Three further AML samples had evidence of acquired segmental UPD of 13q in a subclone of the relapsed leukemia. One patient acquired segmental UPD of 19q that led to homozygosity for a CEBPA mutation 207C>T. Finally, a single patient with AML acquired segmental UPD of chromosome 4q, for which the candidate gene is unknown.

It worked synergistically with FLT3 inhibitors to suppress leukemia growth in vitro and in xenograft mouse models. Mechanistically, the effect was mediated by protein synthesis inhibition and reduction of short-lived proteins, including total and phosphorylated forms of FLT3 and its downstream signaling proteins.

Potential therapeutic benefit can arise from the combination of two structurally diverse inhibitors that target-but bind differently to-the same protein or from two inhibitors with completely different mechanisms of action. Thus, there is a need for identification and development of novel FLT3 inhibitors that have the ability to positively combine with PKC412 or standard chemotherapeutic agents used to treat AML as a way to suppress the development of drug resistance and consequently prolong disease remission. Here, we report the effects of the novel type II ATP-competitive inhibitors, HG-7-85-01 and HG-7-86-01, which potently and selectively target mutant FLT3 protein kinase activity and inhibit the proliferation of cells harboring FLT3-ITD or FLT3 kinase domain point mutants via induction of apoptosis and cell cycle inhibition.

We investigated the hypothesis that previously observed Bcl-2 family member overexpression suppresses wild-type p53 activity in AML. We demonstrate that wild-type p53 protein is expressed in primary leukemic blasts from patients with de novo AML using 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and phospho-specific flow cytometry. We found that p53 was heterogeneously expressed and phosphorylated in AML patient samples and could accumulate following DNA damage. Overexpression of antiapoptosis protein Bcl-2 in AML cells was directly correlated with p53 expression and phosphorylation on serine residues 15, 46, and 392. Within those patients with the highest levels of Bcl-2 expression, we identified a mutation in FLT3 that duplicated phosphorylation site Y591. The presence of this mutation correlated with greater than normal Bcl-2 expression and with previously observed profiles of potentiated STAT and MAPK signaling. These results support the hypothesis that Flt3-mediated signaling in AML enables accumulation of Bcl-2 and maintains a downstream block to p53 pathway apoptosis. Bcl-2 inhibition might therefore improve the efficacy of existing AML therapies by inactivating this suppression of wild-type p53 activity.",

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) has been used in several clinical trials for the treatment of nonpromyelocytic AML with limited clinical activity observed. FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) used as monotherapy also achieve limited clinical responses and are thus far unable to affect cure rates in AML patients. We explored the efficacy of combining ATRA and FLT3 TKIs to eliminate FLT3/internal tandem duplication (ITD)(+) LSCs. Our studies reveal highly synergistic drug activity, preferentially inducing apoptosis in FLT3/ITD(+) cell lines and patient samples. Colony-forming unit assays further demonstrate decreased clonogenicity of FLT3/ITD(+) cells upon treatment with ATRA and TKI. Most importantly, the drug combination depletes FLT3/ITD(+) LSCs in a genetic mouse model of AML, and prolongs survival of leukemic mice. Furthermore, engraftment of primary FLT3/ITD(+) patient samples is reduced in mice following treatment with FLT3 TKI and ATRA in combination, with evidence of cellular differentiation occurring in vivo. Mechanistically, we provide evidence that the synergism of ATRA and FLT3 TKIs is at least in part due to the observation that FLT3 TKI treatment upregulates the antiapoptotic protein Bcl6, limiting the drug's apoptotic effect. However, cotreatment with ATRA reduces Bcl6 expression to baseline levels through suppression of interleukin-6 receptor signaling. These studies provide evidence of the potential of this drug combination to eliminate FLT3/ITD(+) LSCs and reduce the rate of relapse in AML patients with FLT3 mutations. ",

FLT3 activation leads to antiapoptotic and proliferative signals, but little is known about the impact of FLT3/ITDs on differentiation. This study was designed to investigate the effect of FLT3/ITD expression on the differentiation of the 32Dcl3 (32D) myeloblastic cell line to neutrophils in response to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Expression of FLT3/ITD completely blocked morphologic differentiation and induction of myeloperoxidase (MPO), lysozyme, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein epsilon (C/EBPepsilon) in response to G-CSF. Wild-type FLT3 and vector-transfected 32D cells were able to differentiate, although the maturation of FLT3-transfected cells was delayed by FLT3 ligand (FL) stimulation. CEP-701, a potent FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, overcame the morphologic block in differentiation caused by FLT3/ITD expression and allowed G-CSF induction of myeloid maturation markers. These findings suggest that blocking differentiation may be one of the mechanisms by which FLT3/ITDs contribute to leukemogenesis.

Here, we analyzed the role of c-Cbl in Flt3 signal transduction and myeloid transformation. C-Cbl physically interacted with Flt3 and was tyrosine phosphorylated in the presence of Flt3-ligand (FL). Overexpression of a dominant-negative form of c-Cbl (Cbl-70Z) inhibited FL-induced Flt3 ubiquitylation and internalization, indicating involvement of c-Cbl in Flt3 signaling. DNA sequencing of AML bone marrow revealed a case with a c-Cbl point mutation (Cbl-R420Q). Cbl-R420Q inhibited Flt3 internalization and ubiquitylation. Coexpression of Cbl-R420Q or Cbl-70Z with Flt3 induced cytokine-independent growth and survival of 32Dcl3 cells in the absence of FL. Also, the mutant Cbl proteins altered the amplitude and duration of Flt3-dependent signaling events. Our results indicate an important role of Cbl proteins in Flt3 signal modulation.

We hypothesized that a gene encoding tescalcin (TESC), known to be upregulated at leukemia progression during continuous sorafenib treatment and activate an Na(+)/H(+) exchanger type-1 (NHE1), may underlie tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance. TESC was highly expressed in FLT3-ITD(+) AML lines MOLM-13 and MV4-11, and its knockdown by small-interfering RNA lowered intracellular pH (pHi) and induced apoptosis. The results were recapitulated by treatment with an NHE1 inhibitor, 5-(N,N-hexamethylene) amiloride (HMA). Induction of sorafenib resistance in the MOLM-13 cell line (M13-RE) significantly increased its sensitivity to HMA. The later also enhanced suppression of FLT3 signaling by sorafenib in otherwise resistant cell lines. HMA treatment of MOLM-13 and MV4-11 as well as primary FLT3-ITD(+) AML cells significantly reduced leukemia initiation in anti-CD122-primed NOD/SCID mouse xenotransplantation.

        "Doc_abstract":"Nuclear receptor co-repressor (N-CoR) is the key component of generic co-repressor complex essential for the transcriptional control of genes involved in cellular hemostasis. We have recently reported that N-CoR actively represses Flt3, a key factor of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) self-renewal and growth, and that de-repression of Flt3 by the misfolded N-CoR plays an important role in the pathogenesis of promyelocytic and monocytic acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The leukemic cells derived from the promyelocytic and monocytic AML are distinctly characterized by the ectopic reactivation of stem cell phenotypes in relatively committed myeloid compartment. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is not known. Here, we report that N-CoR function is essential for the commitment of primitive hematopoietic cells to the cells of myeloid lineage and that loss of N-CoR function due to misfolding is linked to the ectopic reactivation of generic stem cell phenotypes in promyelocytic and monocytic AML. Analysis of N-CoR and Flt3 transcripts in mouse hematopoietic cells revealed a positive correlation between N-CoR level and the commitment of myeloid cells and an inverse correlation between N-CoR and Flt3 levels in primitive as well as committed myeloid cells. Enforced N-CoR expression in mouse HSCs inhibited their growth and self-renewal potentials and promoted maturation toward cells of myeloid lineage, suggesting a role of N-CoR in the commitment of cells of myeloid lineage. In contrast to AML cells with natively folded N-CoR, primary and secondary promyelocytic and monocytic AML cells harboring the misfolded N-CoR were highly positive for Flt3 and myeloid antigen-based HSC marker CD34. Genetic and therapeutic restoration of N-CoR conformation significantly down-regulated the CD34 levels in monocytic AML cells, suggesting an important role of N-CoR in the suppression of CD34-based HSC phenotypes. These findings collectively suggest that N-CoR is crucial for the commitment of primitive hematopoietic cells to cells of myeloid lineage and that misfolded N-CoR may contribute to transformation of committed myeloid cells through the ectopic reactivation of Flt3/CD34-based stem cell phenotypes in promyelocytic and monocytic AML. Moreover, these findings provide novel mechanistic insights into the formation of leukemic stem cells in subsets of AML and identify the misfolded N-CoR as a subtype-specific biomarker of AML. ",

The results showed that the c-KIT mutation was found in 2 cases out of 14 AML patients with t (8; 21) (14.3%), among them 1 case had c-KIT D816V mutation, the other had c-KIT D816Y mutation. The FLT3-ITD mutation was detect in 1 out of 14 patients (7.1%), but JAK2 mutation could not be detected in all 14 cases. In conclusion, tyrosine kinase mutation relates to AML with t (8; 21), patients with tyrosine kinase mutation may have higher relapse, extramedullary infiltration and poor prognosis. The screening c-KIT, FLT3 mutations may play an important role in evaluating prognosis and guiding treatment of t (8; 21) AML.",

We found that activation of FLT3 in human AML inhibits CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) function by ERK1/2-mediated phosphorylation, which may explain the differentiation block of leukemic blasts. In MV4;11 cells, pharmacological inhibition of either FLT3 or MEK1 leads to granulocytic differentiation. Differentiation of MV4;11 cells was also observed when C/EBPalpha mutated at serine 21 to alanine (S21A) was stably expressed. In contrast, there was no effect when serine 21 was mutated to aspartate (S21D), which mimics phosphorylation of C/EBPalpha. Thus, our results suggest that therapies targeting the MEK/ERK cascade or development of protein therapies based on transduction of constitutively active C/EBPalpha may prove effective in treatment of FLT3 mutant leukemias resistant to the FLT3 inhibitor therapies.",

In such patients, FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are only partially effective and do not eliminate the leukemia stem cells (LSCs) that are assumed to be the source of treatment failure. Here, we show that the NAD-dependent SIRT1 deacetylase is selectively overexpressed in primary human FLT3-ITD AML LSCs. This SIRT1 overexpression is related to enhanced expression of the USP22 deubiquitinase induced by c-MYC, leading to reduced SIRT1 ubiquitination and enhanced stability. Inhibition of SIRT1 expression or activity reduced the growth of FLT3-ITD AML LSCs and significantly enhanced TKI-mediated killing of the cells. Therefore, these results identify a c-MYC-related network that enhances SIRT1 protein expression in human FLT3-ITD AML LSCs and contributes to their maintenance. Inhibition of this oncogenic network could be an attractive approach for targeting FLT3-ITD AML LSCs to improve treatment outcomes. ",

Here we describe the role of Grb10 in FLT3-ITD-mediated AML. We observed that Grb10 physically associates with FLT3 in response to FLT3-ligand (FL) stimulation through FLT3 phospho-tyrosine 572 and 793 residues and constitutively associates with oncogenic FLT3-ITD. Furthermore endogenous Grb10-FLT3 association was observed in OCI-AML-5 cells. Grb10 expression did not alter FLT3 receptor activation or stability in Ba/F3-FLT3 cells. However, expression of Grb10 enhanced FL-induced Akt phosphorylation without affecting Erk or p38 phosphorylation in Ba/F3-FLT3-WT and Ba/F3-FLT3-ITD. Selective Grb10 depletion reduced Akt phosphorylation in Ba/F3-FLT3-WT and OCI-AML-5 cells. Grb10 transduces signal from FLT3 by direct interaction with p85 and Ba/F3-FLT3-ITD cells expressing Grb10 exhibits higher STAT5 activation. Grb10 regulates the cell cycle by increasing cell population in S-phase. Expression of Grb10 furthermore resulted in an increased proliferation and survival of Ba/F3-FLT3-ITD cells as well as increased colony formation in semisolid culture. Grb10 expression was significantly increased in AML patients compared to healthy controls and was also elevated in patients carrying FLT3-ITD mutants. The elevated Grb10 expression partially correlated to relapse as well as to poor prognosis. These results suggest that Grb10 binds to both normal and oncogenic FLT3 and induces PI3K-Akt and STAT5 signaling pathways resulting in an enhanced proliferation, survival and colony formation of hematopoietic cells.",

We studied 82 adults <60 years of age with primary AML and normal cytogenetics, who received uniform high-dose therapy and found FLT3 ITD in 23 (28%) patients. When the 23 FLT3 ITD+ cases were compared with the 59 cases with wild-type (WT) FLT3, disease-free survival (DFS) was inferior (P = 0.03), yet overall survival (OS) was not different (P = 0.14). However, 8 (35%) of 23 FLT3 ITD/+ cases also lacked a FLT3 WT allele (FLT3(ITD-R)) as determined by PCR and loss of heterozygosity. Thus, three genotypic groups were identified: normal FLT3(WT/WT), heterozygous FLT3(ITD/WT), and hemizygous FLT3(ITD/-). DFS and OS were significantly inferior for patients with FLT3(ITD/-) (P = 0.0017 and P = 0.0014, respectively). Although DFS and OS for FLT3(WT/WT) and FLT3(ITD/WT) groups did not differ (P = 0.32 and P = 0.98, respectively), OS of the FLT3(ITD/-) group was worse than the FLT3(WT/WT) (P = 0.0005) and FLT3(ITD/WT) (P = 0.008) groups. We propose a model in which FLT3(ITD/-) represents a dominant positive, gain-of-function mutation providing AML cells with a greater growth advantage compared with cells having the FLT3(WT/WT) or FLT3(ITD/WT) genotypes. In conclusion, we have identified the FLT3(ITD/-) genotype as an adverse prognostic factor in de novo AML with normal cytogenetics. A poor prognosis of the relatively young FLT3(ITD/-) adults (median age, 37 years), despite treatment with current dose-intensive regimens, suggests that new treatment modalities, such as therapy with a FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, are clearly needed for this group of patients.",

Serial samples from 19 MDS/CMML cases that progressed to AML were analyzed for ASXL1/TET2/IDH1/2 mutations; seventeen cases presented mutations of at least one of these genes. However, there was no consistent pattern in mutation acquisition during disease progression. This report concerns the analysis of the largest number of gene mutations in CN-AML studied to date, and provides insight into the mutational profile of CN-AML.",

We studied cytotoxic interactions of a FLT3 inhibitor, PKC412, with eight conventional antileukemic agents (cytarabine, doxorubicin, idarubicin, mitoxantrone, etoposide, 4-hydroperoxy-cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and vincristine) using three leukemia cell lines carrying FLT3 mutations (MOLM13, MOLM14 and MV4-11) and five leukemia cell lines without FLT3 mutations (KOPB-26, THP-1, BALL-1, KG-1 and U937). PKC412 showed synergistic effects with all agents studied except methotrexate for FLT3-mutated cell lines in isobologram analysis. In contrast, PKC412 was rather antagonistic to most drugs, except for 4-hydroperoxy-cyclophosphamide and vincristine, in leukemia cell lines without FLT3 mutations. Cell-cycle analysis revealed that PKC412 induced G1 arrest in leukemia cell lines carrying FLT3 mutations, whereas it arrested cells in G2/M phase in the absence of FLT3 mutations, which may underlie the divergent cytotoxic interactions. These results suggest that the simultaneous administration of PKC412 and other agents except methotrexate is clinically effective against FLT3 mutation-positive leukemias, whereas it would be of little benefit for FLT3 mutation-negative leukemias. Our findings may be of help for the design of PKC412-based combination chemotherapy.",

To elucidate whether these mutations cause aberrant signal transduction in AML, we used gene expression profiling in a series of 110 newly diagnosed AML patients with normal karyotype. The different algorithms used for data analysis revealed highly concordant sets of genes, indicating that the identified gene signatures are specific for each analysed subgroup. Whereas samples with FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD could be separated with up to 100% accuracy, this did not apply for NRAS-PM and wild-type samples, suggesting that only FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD are associated with an apparent signature in AML. The set of discriminating genes included several known genes, which are involved in cell cycle control (CDC14A, WEE1), gene transcription (HOXB5, FOXA1), and signal transduction (SMG1).

The aim of this study was therefore to establish a PTP expression profile in AML cells and to explore the possible role of FLT3 ITD (Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 with internal tandem duplication), an important oncoprotein in AML for PTP gene expression. PTP mRNA expression was analyzed in AML cells from patients and in cell lines using a RT-qPCR platform for detection of transcripts of 92 PTP genes. PTP mRNA expression was also analyzed based on a public microarray data set for AML patients. Highly expressed PTPs in AML belong to all PTP subfamilies. Very abundantly expressed PTP genes include PTPRC, PTPN2, PTPN6, PTPN22, DUSP1, DUSP6, DUSP10, PTP4A1, PTP4A2, PTEN, and ACP1. PTP expression was further correlated with the presence of FLT3 ITD, focusing on a set of highly expressed dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs). Elevated expression of DUSP6 in patients harboring FLT3 ITD was detected in this analysis. The mechanism and functional role of FLT3 ITD-mediated upregulation of DUSP6 was then explored using pharmacological inhibitors of FLT3 ITD signal transduction and si/shRNA technology in human and murine cell lines. High DUSP6 expression was causally associated with the presence of FLT3 ITD and dependent on FLT3 ITD kinase activity and ERK signaling. DUSP6 depletion moderately increased ERK1/2 activity but attenuated FLT3 ITD-dependent cell proliferation of 32D cells.

Two patients had both IDH1 and IDH2 mutations. All but one IDH1 mutation caused substitutions of residue R132; IDH2 mutations caused changes of R140 (n = 48) or R172 (n = 22). IDH mutations were associated with older age (P < .001; effect conferred by IDH2 only); lower WBC (P = .04); higher platelets (P < .001); cytogenetically normal (CN) -AML (P< .001); and NPM1 mutations, in particular with the genotype of mutated NPM1 without FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD; P < .001). In patients with CN-AML with the latter genotype, IDH mutations adversely impacted relapse-free survival (RFS; P = .02) and overall survival (P = .03), whereas outcome was not affected in patients with CN-AML who lacked this genotype. In CN-AML, multivariable analyses revealed a significant interaction between IDH mutation and the genotype of mutated NPM1 without FLT3-ITD (ie, the adverse impact of IDH mutation [RFS]; P = .046 was restricted to this patient subset).;IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are recurring genetic changes in AML. They constitute a poor prognostic factor in CN-AML with mutated NPM1 without FLT3-ITD, which allows refined risk stratification of this AML subset.",

Concurrent acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is rare, with most cases involving lymph nodes or spleen, and no cutaneous involvement. We report the case of a 59-year-old man who presented with fever, malaise, and fatigue. The CBC showed leukocytosis (30.4 × 10/L, 9% blasts), anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Bone marrow biopsy was diagnosed with AML, not otherwise specified, with mutations of FLT3 and IDH2 (R140Q). The patient developed skin rash on the right flank with the clinical differential diagnosis of herpes simplex virus or varicella-zoster virus infection/reactivation versus leukemia cutis. A skin biopsy showed leukemia cutis in mid and deep dermis. Immunohistochemistry positive for CD4, CD33, CD117, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) supported myeloid and monocytic differentiation. Clusters of Langerhans cells positive for S100, CD1a, CD4, langerin and aberrant CD33 and MPO were found admixed with the AML cells. Langerhans cells were negative for BRAF V600E by immunohistochemistry. The diagnosis of leukemia cutis and concomitant LCH was established. The aberrant expression of CD33 and MPO shared by AML and LCH suggests a possible relationship among these 2 lesions. No LCH or Langerhans cell differentiation was found in the bone marrow. The patient achieved complete remission 4 months after chemotherapy and the skin lesions resolved. To our knowledge, we present for the first time a case of concomitant cutaneous LCH and leukemia cutis.",

SAR103168 was a potent Src inhibitor, with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 0.65 ± 0.02 nM (at 100 μM ATP), targeting the auto-phosphorylation of the kinase domain (Src(260-535)) and activity of the phosphorylated kinase. Phosphorylation of Src, Lyn and Src downstream signaling pathways (PYK2, P-130CAS, FAK, JNK and MAPK) were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. SAR103168 inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT5 in KG1 cells and fresh cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). SAR103168 inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in acute and chronic myeloid leukemic cells at nanomolar IC50. SAR103168 induced anti-proliferation of leukemic progenitors (CFU-L) from 29 patients with AML, and > 85% of AML patient samples were sensitive to SAR103168. These antagonist activities of SAR103168 were independent of FLT3 expression. SAR103168 treatment was effective in 50% of high-risk patient samples carrying chromosome 7 abnormalities or complex rearrangement. SAR103168 administration (intravenous or oral) impaired tumor growth and induced tumor regression in animals bearing human AML leukemic cells, correlating with potent inhibition of Src downstream signaling pathways in AML tumors. SAR103168 showed potent anti-tumor activity in SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency) mice bearing AML (KG1, EOL-1, Kasumi-1, CTV1) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (K562) tumors.

We evaluated the associations of these mutations with clinical outcomes in patients.;We compared the mutational status of the NPM1, FLT3, CEBPA, MLL, and NRAS genes in leukemia cells with the clinical outcome in 872 adults younger than 60 years of age with cytogenetically normal AML.

In this study, we examined the effect of stromal niche cells on CD34(+) progenitors from patients with FLT3-ITD(+) or wild-type FLT3 (FLT3-WT) AML treated with the TKIs SU5614 or sorafenib. TKIs effectively and specifically inhibited FLT3 and increased the fraction of undivided progenitors in both FLT3-ITD(+) and FLT3-WT samples. Treatment with SU5614 and sorafenib also reduced the number of mature leukemic progenitors, whereas contact with stroma protected against this cell loss. In contrast, primitive long-term progenitors from both FLT3-ITD(+) and FLT3-WT AML were resistant to TKIs. Additional contact with niche cells significantly expanded long-term FLT3-ITD(+) but not FLT3-WT progenitors in the presence of SU5614 but not that of sorafenib. Thus, TKIs with first-generation inhibitors fail to eradicate early leukemic stem/progenitor cells in FLT3-ITD(+) AML. Further, we defined a specific interaction between FLT3-ITD(+) progenitors and niche cells that enables the maintenance of leukemic progenitors in the presence of TKI. Collectively, our findings suggest that molecular therapy may have unpredicted effects on leukemic progenitors, underscoring the necessity of developing strategies to selectively eliminate the malignant stem cell clone.",

Ponatinib (AP24534) is a multikinase inhibitor with in vitro and clinical activity in tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia, irrespective of BCR-ABL KD mutation. Ponatinib has demonstrated early clinical efficacy in chemotherapy-resistant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in FLT3. We assessed the in vitro activity of ponatinib against clinically relevant FLT3-ITD mutant isoforms that confer resistance to AC220 or sorafenib. Substitution of the FLT3 \"gatekeeper\" phenylalanine with leucine (F691L) conferred mild resistance to ponatinib, but substitutions at the FLT3 activation loop (AL) residue D835 conferred a high degree of resistance. Saturation mutagenesis of FLT3-ITD exclusively identified FLT3 AL mutations at positions D835, D839, and Y842. The switch control inhibitor DCC-2036 was similarly inactive against FLT3 AL mutations. On the basis of its in vitro activity against FLT3 TKI-resistant F691 substitutions, further clinical evaluation of ponatinib in TKI-naïve and select TKI-resistant FLT3-ITD+ AML patients is warranted. Alternative strategies will be required for patients with TKI-resistant FLT3-ITD D835 mutations.",

Myeloid progenitors differentiate into professional antigen presenting cells (APC) under the essential influence of GM-CSF along with additional cytokines. Twelve cases of human AML were tested for ability to be differentiated toward a professional APC phenotype in short-term culture with addition of GM-CSF and the following recombinant proteins: TNFalpha, IL-4, CD40 ligand, Flt3 ligand and SCF. Significant upregulation of CD80 (B7-1) and enhancement of alloantigen presentation was seen with the addition of GM-CSF and TNFalpha alone or with additional cytokines. The combination of GM-CSF and TNFalpha, either alone or in combination with an additional cytokine, resulted in enhancing alloantigen presentation by at least two-fold over the media control group in 10/12 patients studied, and resulted in CD80 expression of greater than 15% in 11/12 patients studied. In AML cultures with GM-CSF and TNFalpha, coexpression of CD80 and either CD34 or an aberrant surface marker (CD56) was seen. In one case, sorted CD80, cells retained a characteristic cytogenetic marker and CD34 expression, proving their derivation from an AML precursor. These studies verify other reports of in vitro differentiation of human AML precursors into enhanced APC, suggesting that this phenomenon could be utilized for immunotherapy strategies aimed at enhancing presentation of leukemia antigens to T cells.",

Analysis was performed on six genes known to be mutated in AML (RUNX1, FLT3, KIT, CEBPA, PTPN11 and NRAS) and an additional two candidate genes (CCND3 and FES) in a panel of 175 primary human AML samples that included all French-American-British types except M3, and all cytogenetic risk groups. One hundred and fifteen mutations were identified in 97 (55%) patients comprising 81 patients (46%) with one mutation, 14 patients (8%) with two mutations and two patients (1%) with three mutations. Fifty-five of 88 (63%) patients with normal karyotype AML had at least one mutation. Correlation was observed between KIT mutation and 'favourable risk' cytogenetics (P <0.001), CEBPA mutation and 'intermediate risk' cytogenetics (P=0.045), and PTPN11 mutation and 'poor risk' disease (P <0.001). The frequency of individual gene mutation was in accordance with previously published studies. Three novel mutations of FLT3 were detected (Y589D, D839G, Y842H) that would have been overlooked by conventional gel electrophoresis. A 51-bp deletion was detected in CCND3 in a patient with normal karyotype AML.

        "Doc_abstract":"For the last twenty years, significant progress in Molecular and Cellular Biology has resulted in a better characterization and understanding of the biology and prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These achievements have provided new opportunities for the development of innovative, more effective therapies. Novel agents potentially useful in the treatment of patients with AML include new formulations of established drugs, newer nucleoside analogs, molecular target drugs, monoclonal antibodies and other agents. Three newer nucleoside analogs, clofarabine, troxacitabine and sapacitabine have been recently investigated in patients with AML. Two methylation inhibitors, 5-azacyticline and decitabine are pyrimidine nucleoside analogs of cytidine which can be incorporated into RNA and/or DNA. Lower doses of these agents are active in AML and have been extensively investigated, especially in secondary AML and AML in elderly patients. Tipifarnib and lonafarnib are orally available farnesyltransferase inhibitors with in vitro and in vivo activity against AML. In recent years, FLT3 inhibitors, lestaurinib, tandutinib and PKC 412 have been developed and tested in AML. The preclinical observations and clinical studies indicate that FLT3 inhibitors are promising agents in the treatment of FLT3 mutated AML patients, especially when used in combinations with chemotherapy. Several newer MDR inhibitors, including valspodar (PSC-833) and zosuquidar trihydrochloride have been also tested for the treatment of relapsed AML. This article reviews the various classes of AML targets and drugs that are under early phase clinical evaluation, especially those that are likely to enter clinical practice in the near future.",

One passage of human AML cells in NOD/SCID mice did not appear to select for increased virulence, as measured by serial transplantation efficiency.

Of these cases, 79% showed at least one nonsynonymous mutation, and cases of AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities showed a lower frequency of mutations versus AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (P<0.001). Mutational analysis further demonstrated that TP53 mutations are associated with complex karyotype AML, whereas ASXL1 and U2AF1 mutations are associated with AML with myelodysplasia-related changes. Furthermore, U2AF1 mutations were specifically associated with trilineage morphologic dysplasia. Univariate analysis demonstrated that U2AF1 and TP53 mutations are associated with absence of clinical remission, poor overall survival (OS), and poor disease-free survival (DFS; P<0.0001), whereas TET2 and ASXL1 mutations are associated with poor OS (P<0.03).

We have generated an AML mouse model using knockin mouse strains to study cooperation of an internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation in the Flt3 gene with commonly observed CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPα) mutations. This study provides evidence that FLT3 ITD cooperates in leukemogenesis by enhancing the generation of leukemia-initiating granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) otherwise prevented by a block in differentiation and skewed lineage priming induced by biallelic C/EBPα mutations. These cellular changes are accompanied by an upregulation of hematopoietic stem cell and STAT5 target genes. By gene expression analysis in premalignant populations, we further show a role of FLT3 ITD in activating genes involved in survival/transformation and chemoresistance.

In 672 normal karyotype AML patients FLT3-ITD, but not FLT3-TKD mutations were associated with a worse relapse free and overall survival in multivariate analysis. In paired diagnosis-relapse samples FLT3-ITD showed higher stability (70%) compared to FLT3-TKD (30%). In vitro, FLT3-ITD induced a strong activating phenotype in Ba/F3 cells. In contrast, FLT3-TKD mutations and other point mutations--including two novel mutations--showed a weaker but clear gain-of-function phenotype with gradual increase in proliferation and protection from apoptosis. The pro-proliferative capacity of the investigated FLT3 mutants was associated with cell surface expression and tyrosine 591 phosphorylation of the FLT3 receptor. Western blot experiments revealed STAT5 activation only in FLT3-ITD positive cell lines, in contrast to FLT3-non-ITD mutants, which displayed an enhanced signal of AKT and MAPK activation. Gene expression analysis revealed distinct difference between FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD for STAT5 target gene expression as well as deregulation of SOCS2, ENPP2, PRUNE2 and ART3. FLT3-ITD and FLT3 point mutations show a gain-of-function phenotype with distinct signalling properties in vitro.

Changes in FoxM1 expression were detected after MV4-11 cells, which have an internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 gene (FLT3-ITD), and control THP1 cells (encoding wild-type FLT3) were treated with the FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor AC220 (quizartinib) or FLT3 ligand (FL). Finally, we determined the apoptosis rates after the addition of the FoxM1 inhibitor thiostrepton (TST) to AML cells with or without FLT3-ITD. The expression of FoxM1 in AML patients was correlated with the presence of FLT3-ITD, genetic groups, and possibly overall survival. Inhibition of FLT3-ITD by AC220 down-regulated FoxM1 expression in MV4-11 cells, and stimulation of FLT3 by FL up-regulated FoxM1 expression in MV4-11 and THP1 cells.

The biological and clinical characteristics of relapsed AML are analyzed here.;Most relevant literature in English language on relapsed AML from 1990 to 2004 was considered paying particular attention to the heterogeneity of the disease and prognostic factors at the time of relapse; therapeutic results in terms of second complete remission (CR) with conventional chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation and new agents are also summarized.;Molecular relapse is a current indication for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL); however, data are emerging for the treatment of molecular relapse in AML other than APL, such as AML with t(8;21) and AML with inv(16). Age, duration of first remission and cytogenetics are the most relevant prognostic factors in relapsed AML. Promising therapeutic results have been reported for the antiCD33 monoclonal antibody conjugated with calicheamicin and the new nucleoside analog clofarabine; preliminary studies indicate that FLT3, farnesyl-transferase and bcl-2 inhibitors are active in relapsed AML.;All relapsed elderly patients and young adults with CR1 lasting for less than 12 months are ideal candidates for experimental therapies.

FLT3 ITD mutations result in constitutive kinase activation and are thought to be pathogenetically relevant, implicating FLT3 as a plausible therapeutic target. MLN518 (formerly CT53518) is a small molecule inhibitor of the FLT3, KIT, and platelet-derived growth-factor receptor (PDGFR) tyrosine kinases with significant activity in murine models of FLT3 ITD-positive leukemia. Given the importance of FLT3 and KIT for normal hematopoietic progenitor cells, we analyzed the effect of MLN518 on murine hematopoiesis under steady-state conditions, after chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression, and during bone marrow transplantation. In these assays, we show that MLN518 has mild toxicity toward normal hematopoiesis at concentrations that are effective in treating FLT3 ITD-positive leukemia in mice. We also demonstrate that MLN518 preferentially inhibits the growth of blast colonies from FLT3 ITD-positive compared with ITD-negative patients with AML, at concentrations that do not significantly affect colony formation by normal human progenitor cells. In analogy to imatinib mesylate in BCR-ABL-positive acute leukemia, MLN518-induced remissions may not be durable.

The multi-targeted kinase inhibitor sorafenib is efficacious in AML with FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD), but resistance to therapy is an important clinical problem. It is unclear whether AML lacking FLT3-ITD responds to sorafenib. Using AML cell lines, we have shown that a low concentration of sorafenib induces opposing effects depending on the oncogenic background. In FLT3-ITD positive cells sorafenib blocks Erk activity and cell proliferation, and triggers apoptosis. However, in cells lacking FLT3-ITD, sorafenib paradoxically activates Erk2, and stimulates cellular proliferation and metabolic activity. Thus, depending on the genetic context, sorafenib is a beneficial inhibitor or paradoxical activator of mitogenic signaling pathways in AML. These results harbor important consequences in planning clinical trials in AML. ",

Different clinical and biological features at diagnosis have been reported as useful for the prediction of clinical outcome; however, in most AML cases induction therapy must be initiated as soon as possible, therefore, the possibility of stratifying patients at diagnosis is generally not taken into account, with the exception of acute promyelocytic leukemia in which morphology, immunophenotype, and molecular biology allow a rapid diagnosis and the adoption of specific therapy. As a consequence, prognostic factors in AML are more useful for the prediction of relapse, rather than for the stratification of induction therapy. Most relevant studies, based on large multicenter trials have definitively demonstrated that age and cytogenetics at diagnosis are the most important prognostic determinants for patients with AML. Early blast clearance after induction chemotherapy represents a further important factor of potential utility into clinical practice. Finally, biologic parameters, such as mutations of FLT3 and nucleophosmin, have been reported as useful for the prognostic categorization mainly in patients with intermediate cytogenetics and can also represent potential targets for new therapeutic agents.",

We developed an amplicon-based ultra-deep-sequencing (UDS) approach for FLT3 mutational screening. We exploited this highly sensitive technology for the retrospective screening of diagnosis, relapse and follow-up samples of 5 out of 256 cytogenetically normal (CN-) AML who were FLT3 wild-type at presentation, but tested ITD+ at relapse or disease progression. Our study revealed that all patients carried a small ITD+ clone at diagnosis, which was undetectable by routine analysis (0,2-2% abundance). The dynamics of ITD+ clones from diagnosis to disease progression, assessed by UDS, reflected clonal evolution under treatment pressure. UDS appears as a valuable tool for FLT3 mutational screening and for the assessment of minimal residual disease (MRD) during follow-up, by detecting small ITD+ clones that may survive chemotherapy, evolve over time and definitely worsen the prognosis of CN-AML patients.

We report here the development and characterization of a fully human anti-FLT3 neutralizing antibody (IMC-EB10) isolated from a human Fab phage display library. IMCEB10 (immunoglobulin G1 [IgG1], kappa) binds with high affinity (KD=158 pM) to soluble FLT3 in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and to FLT3 receptor expressed on the surfaces of human leukemia cell lines. IMC-EB10 blocks the binding of FLT3 ligand (FL) to soluble FLT3 in ELISA and competes with FL for binding to cell-surface FLT3 receptor. IMC-EB10 treatment inhibits FL-induced phosphorylation of FLT3 in EOL-1 and EM3 leukemia cells and FL-independent constitutive activation of ITD-mutant FLT3 in BaF3-ITD and MV4;11 cells. Activation of the downstream signaling proteins mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and AKT is also inhibited in these cell lines by antibody treatment. The antibody inhibits FL-stimulated proliferation of EOL-1 cells and ligand-independent proliferation of BaF3-ITD cells.

Because we noted that in vivo FLT3 inhibition by lestaurtinib was less effective in the relapsed patients compared with the newly diagnosed patients, we investigated whether plasma FLT3 ligand (FL) levels could influence the efficacy of FLT3 inhibition in these patients. After intensive chemotherapy, FL levels rose to a mean of 488 pg/mL on day 15 of induction therapy for newly diagnosed patients, whereas they rose to a mean of 1148 pg/mL in the relapsed patients. FL levels rose even higher with successive courses of chemotherapy, to a mean of 3251 pg/mL after the fourth course. In vitro, exogenous FL at concentrations similar to those observed in patients mitigated FLT3 inhibition and cytotoxicity for each of 5 different FLT3 inhibitors (lestaurtinib, midostaurin, sorafenib, KW-2449, and AC220). The dramatic increase in FL level after chemotherapy represents a possible obstacle to inhibiting FLT3 in this clinical setting. These findings could have important implications regarding the design and outcome of trials of FLT3 inhibitors and furthermore suggest a rationale for targeting FL as a therapeutic strategy.",

Point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) are observed as primary mutations or are acquired as secondary mutations in FLT3 with internal tandem duplications (ITDs) after treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Although dozens of potent inhibitors against FLT3 ITD have been reported, activating TKD point mutations, especially at residues F691 and D835, remain the leading cause for therapy resistance, highlighting the consistent need for new potent inhibitors. Herein we report the identification and characterization of novel quinoxaline-based FLT3 inhibitors. We used the pharmacophore features of diverse known inhibitors as a starting point for a new optimization algorithm for type II TKIs, starting from an in silico library pharmacophore search and induced-fit docking in the known FLT3 structure. This led to the design of a set of diverse quinoxalinebisarylureas, which were profiled in an FLT3 kinase activity assay. The most promising compounds were further evaluated in a zebrafish embryo phenotype assay. ",

These duplications have been reported to lead to autophosphorylation of the receptor. In this study we investigated the effect of such mutations in the Flt3 gene on the in vitro proliferation of human acute myeloid leukemia cells. The mutations were detected in 10 out of 59 AML bone marrow samples analyzed and were not restricted to a specific FAB class or cytogenetic aberration. PCR analysis of those samples showed all mutations to be present in exon 11 of the gene. Whilst samples without a mutation of the Flt3 gene showed an increased cell production in response to either IL-3 and G-CSF or IL-6, SCF, TPO and Flt3L in long-term stroma supported cultures, mutant samples failed to do so. As we could not find a relationship between the absence of a response and either FAB class or cytogenetic aberrations, we interpret these results as an indication that the internal tandem duplications in the Flt3 gene are the prime cause of this unresponsiveness.

In 2001, the World Health Organization (WHO), in conjunction with the Society for Hematopathology and the European Association of Hematopathology, published a new classification for myeloid neoplasms. A number of chromosomal abnormalities are used to predict outcome and stratify therapeutic risk groups in children with AML. Recently, alterations in receptor tyrosine kinases, tyrosine phosphatases and in oncogenes such as RAS have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AML. This article aims to review the recent development in diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of AML. Better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of AML has led to the development of target-specific therapies. Some of the new classes of drugs include monoclonal antibody directed against the CD33 antigen, farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTI), and FMSlike tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitors. The role of allogenic SCT, particularly whether it should be done during first CR or reserved for second remission, remains the most controversial issue in pediatric AML.

As the number of clinically relevant somatic mutations in AML increases, it becomes increasingly attractive to incorporate FLT3 ITD testing into multiplex assays for many somatic mutations simultaneously, using next-generation sequencing (NGS). However, the performance of most NGS analysis tools for identifying medium-size insertions such as FLT3 ITD mutations is largely unknown. We used a multigene, targeted NGS assay to obtain deep sequence coverage (>1000-fold) of FLT3 and 26 other genes from 22 FLT3 ITD-positive and 29 ITD-negative specimens to examine the performance of several commonly used NGS analysis tools for identifying FLT3 ITD mutations. ITD mutations were present in hybridization-capture sequencing data, and Pindel was the only tool out of the seven tested that reliably detected these insertions. Pindel had 100% sensitivity (95% CI = 83% to 100%) and 100% specificity (95% CI = 88% to 100%) in our samples; Pindel provided accurate ITD insertion sizes and was able to detect ITD alleles present at estimated frequencies as low as 1%.

To better understand FLT3 signaling in leukemogenesis, we have examined the changes in gene expression induced by FLT3/ITD or constitutively activated wild-type FLT3 expression. Microarrays were used with RNA harvested before and after inhibition of FLT3 signaling. Pim-1 was found to be one of the most significantly down-regulated genes upon FLT3 inhibition. Pim-1 is a proto-oncogene and is known to be up-regulated by signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), which itself is a downstream target of FLT3 signaling. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) confirmed the microarray results and demonstrated approximately 10-fold decreases in Pim-1 expression in response to FLT3 inhibition. Pim-1 protein also decreased rapidly in parallel with decreasing autophosphorylation activity of FLT3. Enforced expression of either the 44-kDa or 33-kDa Pim-1 isotypes resulted in increased resistance to FLT3 inhibition-mediated cytotoxicity and apoptosis. In contrast, expression of a dominant-negative Pim-1 construct accelerated cytotoxicity in response to FLT3 inhibition and inhibited colony growth of FLT3/ITD-transformed BaF3 cells. These findings demonstrate that constitutively activated FLT3 signaling up-regulates Pim-1 expression in leukemia cells. This up-regulation contributes to the proliferative and antiapoptotic pathways induced by FLT3 signaling.",

We employed a PIM1 inhibitor, AR00459339 (Array Biopharma Inc.), to investigate the effect of PIM1 inhibition in FLT3-mutant AML. Like FLT3 inhibitors, AR00459339 was preferentially cytotoxic to FLT3-ITD cells, as demonstrated in the MV4-11, Molm-14, and TF/ITD cell lines, as well as 12 FLT3-ITD primary samples. Unlike FLT3 inhibitors, AR00459339 did not suppress phosphorylation of FLT3, but did promote the de-phosphorylation of downstream FLT3 targets, STAT5, AKT, and BAD. Combining AR00459339 with a FLT3 inhibitor resulted in additive to mildly synergistic cytotoxic effects. AR00459339 was cytotoxic to FLT3-ITD samples from patients with secondary resistance to FLT3 inhibitors, suggesting a novel benefit to combining these agents.

Furthermore, we evaluated the prognostic impacts of each sole mutation and the combinations of mutations and/or cytogenetics, and demonstrated that AML patients could be clearly stratified into five risk groups for overall survival by including the mutation status of DNMT3A, MLL-PTD and TP53 genes in the risk classification system of the European LeukemiaNet.

The FLT3-ITD mutation could, therefore, be a potential molecular prognostic marker important for risk-stratified treatment options. We amplified the FLT3 gene at exon 14 and 15 in 52 AML patients (aged between 2 months and 74 years) from 4 referral centers (a university hospital and 3 regional hospitals in Northeast Thailand), using a simple PCR method. FLT3-ITD mutations were found in 10 patients (19.2%), being more common in adults than in children (21.1% vs. 14.3%) and more prevalent in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (AML-M3) than AML-non M3 (4 of 10 AML-M3 vs. 6 of 42 AML- non M3 patients). Duplication sequences varied in size-between 27 and 171 nucleotides (median=63.5) and in their location. FLT3-ITD mutations with common duplication sequences accounted for a significant percentage in AML patients in northeastern Thailand. This simple PCR method is feasible for routine laboratory practice and these data could help tailor use of the national protocol for AML.",

These alterations have been associated with a poor prognosis. In our study, we analyzed the prevalence and the potential prognostic impact of these aberrations in a large unselected and well-defined cohort of 956 patients with AML. Results were correlated with cytogenetic data and clinical outcome. MLL PTD was detected by RT-PCR, subsequent nucleotide sequencing, and Southern blotting. The overall incidence was found to be 5.0% (48/956), whereas FLT3 ITD was detected in 19.2% (184/956). Sixteen cases were positive for both alterations. The rate of MLL PTD in FLT3 ITD positive patients was significantly higher than that in FLT3 ITD negative patients [16/184 (8.7%); 32/772 (4.1%); P = 0.025]. However, both aberrations were highly increased in patients with normal karyotype (MLL PTD 35/431, P = 0.004; FLT3 ITD 132/334, P < 0.001). When restricted to this subgroup, the rate of MLL PTD in patients with FLT3 mutations was not significantly increased. No statistically significant differences were detected between patients positive for MLL PTD and patients negative for MLL PTD in the rate of complete remissions or the overall survival, although we did see a significantly shorter disease-free survival in patients age 60 or younger. In conclusion, although there is an overlap in the mutational spectrum in AML with FLT3 ITD and MLL PTD mutations, our data do not support a common mechanistic basis. Although associated with inferior disease-free survival, the results of this study do not unequivocally support the notion that MLL PTD mutations represent an independent prognostic factor.",

The receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 is highly expressed in these leukemias. In vitro studies have shown that pediatric MLL-rearranged ALL cells are sensitive to FLT3 inhibitors and clinical trials are ongoing to measure their therapeutic efficacy. We sought to determine the contribution of Flt3 in the pathogenesis of MLL-rearranged leukemias using a myeloid leukemia mouse model. Bone marrow from Flt3 null mice transduced with MLL-ENL or MLL-CBP was transplanted into host mice and Flt3 (-/-) leukemias were compared to their Flt3 wild type counterparts. Flt3 deficiency did not delay disease onset and had minimal impact on leukemia characteristics. To determine the anti-leukemic effect of FLT3 inhibition we studied the sensitivity of MLL-ENL leukemia cells to the FLT3 inhibitor PKC412 ex vivo. As previously reported for human MLL-rearranged leukemias, murine MLL-ENL leukemia cells with higher Flt3 levels were more sensitive to the cytotoxicity of PKC412. Interestingly, Flt3 deficient leukemia samples also displayed some sensitivity to PKC412. Our findings demonstrate that myeloid leukemias induced by MLL-rearranged genes are not dependent upon Flt3 signaling. They also highlight the discrepancy between the sensitivity of cells to Flt3 inhibition in vitro and the lack of contribution of Flt3 to the pathogenesis of MLL-rearranged leukemias in vivo. ",

Upon FLT3 inhibition, CDC25A mRNA and protein were rapidly down-regulated, while levels of other cell cycle proteins remained unchanged. This regulation was dependent on STAT5, arguing for FLT3-ITD-dependent transcriptional regulation of CDC25A. CDC25 inhibitors triggered proliferation arrest and cell death of FLT3-ITD as well as FLT3-ITD/TKD AC-220 resistant cells, but not of FLT3-wt cells. Consistently, RNA interference-mediated knock-down of CDC25A reduced the proliferation of FLT3-ITD cell lines. Finally, the clonogenic capacity of primary FLT3-ITD AML cells was reduced by the CDC25 inhibitor IRC-083864, while FLT3-wt AML and normal CD34+ myeloid cells were unaffected. In good agreement, in a cohort of 100 samples from AML patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics, high levels of CDC25A mRNA were predictive of higher clonogenic potential in FLT3-ITD+ samples, not in FLT3-wt ones.Importantly, pharmacological inhibition as well as RNA interference-mediated knock-down of CDC25A also induced monocytic differentiation of FLT3-ITD positive cells, as judged by cell surface markers expression, morphological modifications, and C/EBPα phosphorylation. CDC25 inhibition also re-induced monocytic differentiation in primary AML blasts carrying the FLT3-ITD mutation, but not in blasts expressing wild type FLT3.

At diagnosis, seven patients were identified to contain FLT3-ITD mutations and one patient to harbor the D835 mutation. Five patients remained FLT3-ITD positive throughout the disease course (+/+). Three patients lost the FLT3 gene mutation at first (one FLT3-ITD, one D835 mutation), or second relapse (one FLT3-ITD) (+/-). One additional patient lost a small FLT3-ITD positive clone at relapse and at the same time gained an apparently unrelated FLT3-ITD positive clone. One patient without FLT3 mutation at diagnosis relapsed with an FLT3-ITD mutation (-/+). A shorter median duration of first remission (6 months versus 11.5 months) and a higher relapse rate after salvage therapy (e.g. allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation) resulted in a lower leukemia-free survival in the FLT3 mutated group (11% versus 31%). The loss of a clone with a mutation in the FLT3 gene at relapse did not improve the prognosis.",

Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are relatively resistant to current chemotherapy and likely contribute to disease relapse and progression. Consequently, the identification of drugs that can efficiently eradicate LSCs is an important priority. In the present study, we investigated the antileukemia activity of the compound TDZD-8. Analysis of primary AML, blast crisis CML (bcCML), ALL, and chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL) specimens showed rapid induction of cell death upon treatment with TDZD-8. In addition, for myeloid leukemias, cytotoxicity was observed for phenotypically primitive cells, in vitro colony-forming progenitors, and LSCs as defined by xenotransplantation assays. In contrast, no significant toxicity was observed for normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Notably, cell death was frequently evident within 2 hours or less of TDZD-8 exposure. Cellular and molecular studies indicate that the mechanism by which TDZD-8 induces cell death involves rapid loss of membrane integrity, depletion of free thiols, and inhibition of both the PKC and FLT3 signaling pathways. We conclude that TDZD-8 uses a unique and previously unknown mechanism to rapidly target leukemia cells, including malignant stem and progenitor populations.",

SU11248 is an oral multitargeted kinase inhibitor with selectivity for fms-related tyrosine kinase 3/Flk2 (FLT3), platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha/beta, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1/2, and KIT receptor tyrosine kinases. FLT3 is a promising candidate for targeted therapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), because activating mutations occur in up to 30% of patients. We conducted an innovative single-dose clinical study with a primary objective to demonstrate inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation by SU11248 in AML.;Twenty-nine AML patients each received a single dose of SU11248, escalated from 50 to 350 mg, in increments of 50 mg and cohorts of three to six patients. FLT3 phosphorylation and plasma pharmacokinetics were evaluated at seven time points over 48 h after SU11248 administration, and FLT3 genotype was determined. Study drug-related adverse events occurred in 31% of patients, mainly grade 1 or 2 diarrhea and nausea, at higher dose levels.;Inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation was apparent in 50% of FLT3-wild-type (WT) patients and in 100% of FLT3-mutant patients. FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutants showed increased sensitivity relative to FLT3-WT, consistent with preclinical predictions. The primary end point, strong inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation in >50% patients, was reached in 200 mg and higher dose cohorts. Downstream signaling pathways were also inhibited; signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) was reduced primarily in internal tandem duplication patients and at late time points in FLT3-WT patients, whereas extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity was reduced in the majority of patients, independent of FLT3 inhibition.;This novel translational study bridges preclinical models to the patient setting and provides the first evidence of anti-FLT3 activity in patients.

Two classes of Flt3 mutations occur: internal tandem duplications (ITDs) in the juxtamembrane and point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD). We and others have shown that Flt3-ITD induced aberrant signaling including strong activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) and repression of CCAAT/estradiol-binding protein alpha (c/EBPalpha) and Pu.1. Here, we compared the signaling properties of Flt3-ITD versus Flt3-TKD in myeloid progenitor cells. We demonstrate that Flt3-TKD mutations induced autonomous growth of 32D cells in suspension cultures. However, in contrast to Flt3-ITD and similar to wild-type Flt3 (Flt3-WT), Flt3-TKD cannot support colony formation in semisolid media. Also, in contrast to Flt3-ITD, neither Flt3-WT nor Flt3-TKD induced activation or induction of STAT5 target genes. Flt3-TKD also failed to repress c/EBPalpha and Pu.1. No significant differences were observed in receptor autophosphorylation and the phosphorylation of Erk-1 and -2, Akt, and Shc. Importantly, TKD but not ITD mutations were a log power more sensitive toward the tyrosine kinase inhibitor protein kinase C 412 (PKC412) than Flt3-WT.

In 190 patients without the M3 French-American-British (FAB) subtype who were treated with the protocol of the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group, multivariate analyses showed that the NPM1 mutation was a favorable factor for achieving complete remission but was associated with a high relapse rate. Sequential analysis using 39 paired samples obtained at diagnosis and relapse showed that NPM1 mutations were lost at relapse in 2 of the 17 patients who had NPM1 mutations at diagnosis.

Here we show that T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK), a mitotic kinase highly expressed in and correlated with more aggressive phenotype in several types of cancer, is expressed in AML but not in normal CD34+ cells and that TOPK knockdown decreased cell viability and induced apoptosis. Treatment of AML cells with TOPK inhibitor (OTS514) resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability with lower IC50 in FLT3-mutated cells, including blasts obtained from patients relapsed after FLT3-inhibitor treatment. Using a MV4-11-engrafted mouse model, we found that mice treated with 7.5 mg/kg IV daily for 3 weeks survived significantly longer than vehicle treated mice (median survival 46 vs 29 days, P < 0.001). Importantly, we identified TOPK as a FLT3-ITD and CEBPA regulated kinase, and that modulating TOPK expression or activity resulted in significant decrease of FLT3 expression and CEBPA phosphorylation.

Two distinct types of FLT3 mutations are most common: internal tandem duplication (ITD) of sequences coding for the juxtamembrane domain and point mutations at codon 835 (Asp835) within the kinase domain. Both types of mutations constitutively activate the tyrosine kinase activity of FLT3 in experimental systems and result in factor-independent proliferation of Ba/F3 and 32D cells. Recently, novel mutations within the activation loop were identified in patients with AML: deletion of isoleucine 836 (Ile836del) and an exchange of isoleucine 836 to methionine plus an arginine insertion (Ile836Met+Arg). To examine whether the Ile836 mutations result in constitutive activation of the FLT3 receptor, we introduced both mutant FLT3 cDNAs transiently into HEK 293 cells. Both mutant FLT3 receptors were constitutively autophosphorylated in the absence of ligand and kinase activity led to constitutive activation of downstream signaling cascades as determined by activation of the STAT5 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 5) pathway. When stably expressed in the growth factor-dependent cell lines Ba/F3 and 32D, both deletion and insertion mutants led to factor-independent proliferation, indicating that both mutants have transforming capabilities. We then examined the sensitivity of the FLT3 ITD, FLT3 Asp835Tyr, and the novel FLT3 receptor mutants toward the kinase inhibitors AG1296, PKC412, and SU5614. We show that these FLT3 kinase inhibitors have distinct inhibitory potencies against different activating FLT3 receptor mutants.

Homing of AML cells to the marrow was the same between engrafters and nonengrafters. FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) and nucleophosmin mutations occurred at a similar frequency in engrafters and nonengrafters. The only variable that was related to engraftment ability was the karyotypically defined risk stratification of individual AML cases. Of interest, follow-up of younger patients with intermediate-risk AML revealed a significant difference in overall survival between NOD/SCID engrafting and nonengrafting AMLs. Hence, the ability of AML to engraft in the NOD/SCID assay seems to be an inherent property of AML cells, independent of homing, conditioning, or cell frequency/source, which is directly related to prognosis.

FLT3 inhibitors such as sorafenib may improve outcome, but only few patients display long-term responses, prompting the search for underlying resistance mechanisms and therapeutic strategies to overcome them. Here we identified that the nuclear factor of activated T cells, NFATc1, is frequently overexpressed in FLT3-ITD-positive (FLT3-ITD+) AML. NFATc1 knockdown using inducible short hairpin RNA or pharmacological NFAT inhibition with cyclosporine A (CsA) or VIVIT significantly augmented sorafenib-induced apoptosis of FLT3-ITD+ cells. CsA also potently overcame sorafenib resistance in FLT3-ITD+ cell lines and primary AML. Vice versa, de novo expression of a constitutively nuclear NFATc1-mutant mediated instant and robust sorafenib resistance in vitro. Intriguingly, FLT3-ITD+ AML patients (n=26) who received CsA as part of their rescue chemotherapy displayed a superior outcome when compared with wild-type FLT3 (FLT3-WT) AML patients. Our data unveil NFATc1 as a novel mediator of sorafenib resistance in FLT3-ITD+ AML. CsA counteracts sorafenib resistance and may improve treatment outcome in AML by means of inhibiting NFAT.",

To a major part this is attributed to drug resistance of FLT3-ITD-positive leukemic cells. Against this background, we have devised an antibody array approach to identify proteins, which are differentially expressed by hematopoietic cells in relation to activated FLT3 signaling. Selective upregulation of antiapoptotic myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) was found in FLT3-ITD-positive cell lines and primary mononuclear cells from AML patients as compared with FLT3-wild-type controls. Upregulation of MCL-1 was dependent on FLT3 signaling as confirmed by its reversion upon pharmacological inhibition of FLT3 activity by the kinase inhibitor PKC412 as well as siRNA-mediated suppression of FLT3. Heterologously expressed MCL-1 substituted for FLT3 signaling by conferring resistance of hematopoietic cells to antileukemia drugs such as cytarabine and daunorubicin, and to the proapoptotic BH3 mimetic ABT-737. Conversely, suppression of endogenous MCL-1 by siRNA or by flavopiridol treatment sensitized FLT3-ITD-expressing hematopoietic cells to cytotoxic and targeted therapeutics. In conclusion, MCL-1 is an essential effector of FLT3-ITD-mediated drug resistance. Therapeutic targeting of MCL-1 is a promising strategy to overcome drug resistance in FLT3-ITD-positive AML.",

However, although the WHO defines important biologically and clinically relevant entities, the prognostic value of some of the well-defined cytogenetic subgroups is partially masked in the WHO classification. Moreover, in the recent past a number of novel molecular aberrations with marked prognostic value, which are not yet incorporated in the WHO classifications have been identified. These molecular abnormalities include mutations (e.g., in FLT3, c-KIT, and NPM1), partial duplications (e.g., of MLL and FLT3), and abnormal expression of pathogenetic genes (e.g., EVI1, WT1, BCL2, MDR1, BAALC, and ERG). In addition, novel molecular approaches in genomics, like monitoring the expression levels of thousands of genes in parallel using DNA microarray technology, open possibilities for further refinement of prognostication of AML.

        "Doc_abstract":"Clinical responses achieved with FLT3 kinase inhibitors in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are typically transient and partial. Thus, there is a need for identification of molecular mechanisms of clinical resistance to these drugs. In response, we characterized MOLM13 AML cell lines made resistant to two structurally-independent FLT3 inhibitors.;MOLM13 cells were made drug resistant via prolonged exposure to midostaurin and HG-7-85-01, respectively. Cell proliferation was determined by Trypan blue exclusion. Protein expression was assessed by immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and flow cytometry. Cycloheximide was used to determine protein half-life. RT-PCR was performed to determine FLT3 mRNA levels, and FISH analysis was performed to determine FLT3 gene expression.;We found that MOLM13 cells readily developed cross-resistance when exposed to either midostaurin or HG-7-85-01. Resistance in both lines was associated with dramatically elevated levels of cell surface FLT3 and elevated levels of phosphor-MAPK, but not phospho-STAT5. The increase in FLT3-ITD expression was at least in part due to reduced turnover of the receptor, with prolonged half-life. Importantly, the drug-resistant phenotype could be rapidly reversed upon withdrawal of either inhibitor. Consistent with this phenotype, no significant evidence of FLT3 gene amplification, kinase domain mutations, or elevated levels of mRNA was observed, suggesting that protein turnover may be part of an auto-regulatory pathway initiated by FLT3 kinase activity. Interestingly, FLT3 inhibitor resistance also correlated with resistance to cytosine arabinoside. Over-expression of FLT3 protein in response to kinase inhibitors may be part of a novel mechanism that could contribute to clinical resistance.",

Compounds inhibited colony formation of all cell lines in a dose-dependent fashion. Inhibitory concentrations for 50% of the colony formation/survival (IC50) for BIBF1000 were <100 nmol/L for 3 of 11, <or=500 nmol/L for 6 of 11, and <1,000 nmol/L for 10 of 11 leukemic cell lines, with one cell line being resistant in the dose range <1,000 nmol/L.

The cells from the four cell lines MUTZ-2 (AML M2-derived), OCI/AML5 (AML M4), TF-1 (AML M6) and UT-7 (AML M7) undergo apoptosis quickly in the absence of cytokines in serum-free medium: half-lives of serum- and factor-deprived cells ranged from 14 to 64 h. Here, we analyzed the survival-promoting and apoptosis-inhibiting properties of FLT3 ligand (FL) using the viable cell count as an indicator of programmed cell death. The receptor for FL belongs to the class III family of receptor tyrosine kinases which also includes c-kit, the receptor for stem cell factor (SCF). FL extended the survival of cell lines MUTZ-2 and OCI/AML5, but was not effective for cell lines TF-1 and UT-7. In OCI/AML5, the action of FL was evident both in first promoting survival and then stimulating proliferation slightly. In MUTZ-2, depending on the concentration used, FL extended survival by 64-135% compared with control cells. SCF alone prolonged cell survival of MUTZ-2 as well, however, FL and the combination of FL+SCF was significantly more active.

We have investigated DNA repair in FLT3-ITD and wild-type (WT) cells. Using the comet assay, we have demonstrated that the FLT3 inhibitor PKC412 significantly inhibits repair of DNA damage in the MV4-11-FLT3-ITD cell line and FLT3-ITD patient samples but not in the HL-60-FLT3-WT cell line or FLT3-WT patient samples. Following the discovery that transcript levels of the DNA repair gene RAD51 are significantly correlated with FLT3 transcript levels in FLT3-ITD patients, we further investigated the role of RAD51 in FLT3-ITD-AML. The reduction in DNA repair in PKC412-treated FLT3-ITD cells was shown to be associated with downregulation of RAD51 mRNA and protein expression and correlates with the maintenance of phosphorylated H2AX levels, implying that PKC412 inhibits the homologous recombination double-strand break repair pathway in FLT3-ITD cells. Using FLT3-short interfering RNA (siRNA), we also demonstrated that genetic silencing of FLT3 results in RAD51 downregulation in FLT3-ITD cells but not in FLT3-WT cells. This work suggests that the use of FLT3 inhibitors such as PKC412 may reverse the drug-resistant phenotype of FLT3-ITD-AML cells by inhibiting repair of chemotherapy-induced genotoxic damage and thereby reduce the risk of disease relapse.",

Therefore, we investigated interactions of Flt3 and some Src family tyrosine kinases (SFKs), which are expressed predominantly or exclusively in hematopoietic cells and known to be involved in signal transduction by various RTKs. Employing sets of wt and mutant Flt3 and Hck, we analyzed protein binding as well as Flt3 phosphorylation and maturation in HEK-293 cells cotransfected with expression constructs encoding both binding partners. Kinase-inactive Hck-K269R was recruited to phosphotyrosine residues located in the juxtamembrane (JM) region of activated Flt3 via its SH2 domain. Several of the JM domain tyrosines were phophorylated by Hck and other SFKs. As apparent from the distribution of mature and hypoglycosylated Flt3, SFKs interfered with Flt3 maturation in a kinase-dependent manner.

We previously reported that bone marrow-derived stromal cells inhibit chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here we demonstrate that the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3465 antagonized stromal-derived factor 1alpha (SDF-1alpha)-induced and stroma-induced chemotaxis and inhibited SDF-1alpha-induced activation of prosurvival signaling pathways in leukemic cells. Further, CXCR4 inhibition partially abrogated the protective effects of stromal cells on chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in AML cells. Fetal liver tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) gene mutations activate CXCR4 signaling, and coculture with stromal cells significantly diminished antileukemia effects of FLT3 inhibitors in cells with mutated FLT3. Notably, CXCR4 inhibition increased the sensitivity of FLT3-mutated leukemic cells to the apoptogenic effects of the FLT3 inhibitor sorafenib. In vivo studies demonstrated that AMD3465, alone or in combination with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, induced mobilization of AML cells and progenitor cells into circulation and enhanced antileukemic effects of chemotherapy and sorafenib, resulting in markedly reduced leukemia burden and prolonged survival of the animals. These findings indicate that SDF-1alpha/CXCR4 interactions contribute to the resistance of leukemic cells to signal transduction inhibitor- and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in systems mimicking the physiologic microenvironment. Disruption of these interactions with CXCR4 inhibitors represents a novel strategy of sensitizing leukemic cells by targeting their protective bone marrow microenvironment.",

Here, we have determined the growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic mechanisms of 2 small molecule inhibitors of FLT3, AG1295 or PKC412, in hematopoietic progenitor cells, human leukemic cell lines, and primary AML cells expressing FLT3-ITD. Inactivation of the PI3-kinase pathway, but not of Ras-mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling, was essential to elicit cytotoxic responses. Both compounds induced up-regulation of proapoptotic BH3-only proteins Bim and Puma, and subsequent cell death.

For these reasons FLT3 soon appeared as a promising target for the therapeutic intervention for this severe and aggressive malignancy; the recent determination of the crystal structure of the autoinhibited form of FLT3 gave new trend for the design and the synthesis of potent inhibitors. Small molecules tyrosine kinase inhibitors represent one of the largest drug family currently targeted by pharmaceutical companies for the treatment of cancer. Exciting examples of such molecules have reached advanced clinical trials and have been recently approved by FDA for the treatment of different solid or haematological tumors. Usually TK inhibitors share common features, namely two hydrophobic/aromatic regions bearing one or more hydrogen bonding substituents. These two regions can be connected by different spacers and almost all the molecules contain a component resembling the ATP purine structure. This review will deal with FLT3 synthetic inhibitors, reporting not only the most important molecules that are in clinical trials, but also the new compounds that have appeared in literature in the last few years.

This is the largest cohort of pediatric AML patients reported thus far screened for all four mutations. Of the children with AML, 40% had a mutation in KIT (11.3%), RAS (18%) or FLT3/ITD (11.1%), and 70% of cases of core-binding factor (CBF) leukemia were associated with a mutation of KIT or RAS. Mutations in RAS or FLT3/ITD were frequently found in association with a normal karyotype. Patients with a FLT3/ITD mutation had a significantly worse clinical outcome. However, the presence of a KIT or RAS mutation did not significantly influence clinical outcome. We demonstrate that KIT exon 8 mutations result in constitutive ligand-independent kinase activation that can be inhibited by clinically relevant concentrations of imatinib.

Here, using leukemic cell lines containing activated forms of each of these receptors, we show that ponatinib potently inhibits receptor phosphorylation and cellular proliferation with IC50 values comparable to those required for inhibition of BCR-ABL (0.3 to 20 nmol/L). The activity of ponatinib against the FLT3-ITD mutant, found in up to 30% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, was particularly notable. In MV4-11 (FLT3-ITD(+/+)) but not RS4;11 (FLT3-ITD(-/-)) AML cells, ponatinib inhibited FLT3 signaling and induced apoptosis at concentrations of less than 10 nmol/L. In an MV4-11 mouse xenograft model, once daily oral dosing of ponatinib led to a dose-dependent inhibition of signaling and tumor regression. Ponatinib inhibited viability of primary leukemic blasts from a FLT3-ITD positive AML patient (IC50 4 nmol/L) but not those isolated from 3 patients with AML expressing native FLT3.

However, not all studies confirm this association, so it is still a matter of debate. Moreover, their association with other molecular abnormalities is less studied. We have investigated the presence of FLT3-ITD and D835 mutations in AML patients and their correlation with clinical and biological disease characteristics. The presence of ITD was analyzed in diagnostic samples of 176 AML patients and the D835 mutation in 135 of these patients. In all these patients, the presence of four well-known molecular abnormalities were also simultaneously characterized: PML/RARalpha, AML1/ETO, CBFbeta/MYH11 and MLL rearrangements. In all, 41 (23%) patients harbored FLT3 mutations, with 34 (19.3%) of them positive for the ITD, and seven (5%) positive for the D835 mutation. Of the acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients, 16 (27%) showed FLT3 mutations, more frequently in M3 hypogranular cases (62% versus 17%, P=0.001) and cases with the short (bcr3) PML-RARalpha isoform (69%, P=0.002). In contrast, FLT3 was never altered in patients with inv(16), t(8;21) or 11q23 abnormalities. FLT3 mutations were significantly associated with some negative prognostic features at diagnosis (leukocytosis, high blast-cell percentage, and elevated LDH values), but they were not associated with different disease-free or overall survival. Therefore, we confirm a high frequency of FLT3 mutations in APL and in adult AML without recurrent cytogenetic translocations. In addition, they were not found as independent prognostic factors although associated with several adverse features at diagnosis.",

Besides these major cytogenetic abnormalities, gene mutations also constitute key events in AML pathogenesis.

To gain more insight in this understanding, we clustered these alterations in three groups: (1) mutations affecting genes that contribute to cell proliferation (FLT3, c-KIT, RAS, protein tyrosine standard phosphatase nonreceptor 11); (2) mutations affecting genes involved in myeloid differentiation (AML1 and CEBPA) and (3) mutations affecting genes implicated in cell cycle regulation or apoptosis (P53, NPM1).

Internal tandem duplications (ITDs) of the Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) receptor are the most common mutations in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Both ITDs and pgp positivity confer an adverse clinical prognosis. FLT3 inhibitors induce variable apoptosis in cell lines transfected with FLT3 ITDs. We studied the effect of herbimycin A, AG1296 and PKC412 on primary AML blasts. All compounds showed significantly higher cell kill after 48-h incubation in samples with an ITD compared with wild type (Herbimicin P < 0.001; AG1296 P = 0.001, PKC412, P = 0.002). Pgp-positive samples were significantly less sensitive to herbimycin and AG1296 than pgp-negative samples, although neither molecule inhibited the efflux function of pgp. The concurrent incubation with the pgp inhibitor PSC833 resulted in an enhanced cell kill in 4/5 ITD pgp-positive samples versus two of nine ITD pgp-negative samples. PKC412 inhibited pgp function and induced cell death in FLT3 ITD/pgp-positive samples. We conclude that AML samples with a FLT3 ITD are more susceptible to these inhibitors than wild-type samples. However, the expression of pgp in cells with FLT3 ITDs can reduce their sensitivity to FLT3 inhibitors and therefore pgp expression should be assessed in clinical trials of FLT3 inhibitors.",

Meanwhile, the recent development of massively parallel sequencing technologies has provided a new opportunity to discover genetic changes across entire genomes or proteincoding sequences.

In total, 80 somatic mutations or 4.2 mutations per sample were identified. Many of the recurrent mutations identified in this study involved previously reported targets in AML, such as FLT3, CEBPA, KIT, CBL, NRAS, WT1 and EZH2. On the other hand, several genes were newly identified in the current study, including BCORL1 and major cohesin components such as SMC3 and RAD21.

Although there has been some success in identifying tyrosine kinase inhibitors that block the function of FLT3 ITD, there remains a continued need for effective treatment of this disease. We have identified the psychotropic drug pimozide as an effective inhibitor of STAT5 function. Pimozide inhibits the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5, leading to the death of AML cells through the induction of apoptosis. Pimozide shows a combinatorial effect with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors midostaurin (PKC412) and sunitinib in the inhibition of STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation and the induction of apoptosis. Significantly, pimozide reduces the tumor burden in a mouse model of FLT3-driven AML.

FLT3 mutations were first reported as internal tandem duplication (FLT3/ITD) of the juxtamembrane domain-coding sequence; subsequently, a missense point mutation at the D835 residue and point mutations, deletions, and insertions in the codons surrounding D835 within a FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3/KDMs) have been found.

Several large-scale studies have confirmed that FLT3/ITD is strongly associated with leukocytosis and a poor prognosis. Therefore, routine screening for FLT3 mutations is recommended to stratify patients into distinct risk groups.

SU5416 is a small molecule inhibitor of VEGF receptors, c-kit and FLT3 and therefore provides a novel opportunity to target both angiogenesis and proliferation in AML. SU5416 was assessed in a phase II hematological malignancy trial in the US, where partial responses were observed in two of 33 patients. Since AML provides a unique platform to evaluate mechanism of action of small molecule inhibitors, investigation of the effect of SU5416 on FLT3 expression and phosphorylation in blood and bone marrow was an additional focus of this trial. Phosphorylated FLT3 was detected by immunoprecipitation/Western analysis in peripheral blood samples from 17 of 22 patients, and seven exhibited strong inhibition of phosphorylation immediately following a 1h SU5416 infusion, demonstrating that SU5416 can modulate RTK phosphorylation in humans. Although no clear correlation with clinical response was observed, analysis of patient plasma drug levels suggested that a threshold SU5416 concentration of 15 microM was associated with FLT3 inhibition. This observation was supported by data from an ex vivo model where AML cells were spiked into human blood, established to mimic the clinical setting and enable more rigorous analysis of effect of SU5416. In addition, FLT3 protein levels were downregulated in patient bone marrow samples, analyzed by an RIA assay. To identify putative predictors of response, patient plasma was analyzed for levels of secreted ligands of SU5416 targets; SCF and FLT3 ligand. Baseline levels of SCF in patients with stable or progressive disease were significantly higher than those in normal donors, whereas FLT3 ligand levels in patients who exhibited progressive disease were significantly lower than those in normal donors.

SRC has long been recognized as an important oncogene, but little attention has been given to its other family members. In this report, we have studied the role of FYN in FLT3 signaling in respect to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We observed that FYN displays a strong association with wild-type FLT3 as well as oncogenic FLT3-ITD and is dependent on the kinase activity of FLT3 and the SH2 domain of FYN. We identified multiple FYN binding sites in FLT3, which partially overlapped with SRC binding sites. To understand the role of FYN in FLT3 signaling, we generated FYN overexpressing cells. We observed that expression of FYN resulted in slightly enhanced phosphorylation of AKT, ERK1/2 and p38 in response to ligand stimulation. Furthermore, FYN expression led to a slight increase in FLT3-ITD-dependent cell proliferation, but potent enhancement of STAT5 phosphorylation as well as colony formation. We also observed that FYN expression is deregulated in AML patient samples and that higher expression of FYN, in combination with FLT3-ITD mutation, resulted in enrichment of the STAT5 signaling pathway and correlated with poor prognosis in AML. Taken together our data suggest that FYN cooperates with oncogenic FLT3-ITD in cellular transformation by selective activation of the STAT5 pathway. Therefore, inhibition of FYN, in combination with FLT3 inhibition, will most likely be beneficial for this group of AML patients. ",

We have performed a thorough prognostic evaluation of these genetic markers in patients with pediatric AML enrolled in the Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO) 1993 or NOPHO 2004 protocols. Mutation status and expression levels were analyzed in 185 and 149 patients, respectively. Presence of FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) was associated with significantly inferior event-free survival (EFS), whereas presence of an NPM1 mutation in the absence of FLT3-ITD correlated with significantly improved EFS. Furthermore, high levels of ERG and BAALC transcripts were associated with inferior EFS. No significant correlation with survival was seen for mutations in CEBPA and WT1 or with gene expression levels of MN1, FLT3, and WT1. In multivariate analysis, the presence of FLT3-ITD and high BAALC expression were identified as independent prognostic markers of inferior EFS. We conclude that analysis of the mutational status of FLT3 and NPM1 at diagnosis is important for prognostic stratification of patients with pediatric AML and that determination of the BAALC gene expression level can add valuable information.",

The small molecule inhibitor, PKC412, targets mutant FLT3 and is currently in late-stage clinical trials. However, the identification of PKC412-resistant leukemic blast cells in the bone marrow of AML patients has propelled the development of novel and structurally distinct FLT3 inhibitors that have the potential to override drug resistance and more efficiently prevent disease progression or recurrence. Here, we present the novel first-generation \"type II\" FLT3 inhibitors, AFG206, AFG210, and AHL196, and the second-generation \"type II\" derivatives and AST487 analogs, AUZ454 and ATH686. All agents potently and selectively target mutant FLT3 protein kinase activity and inhibit the proliferation of cells harboring FLT3 mutants via induction of apoptosis and cell cycle inhibition. Cross-resistance between \"type I\" inhibitors, PKC412 and AAE871, was demonstrated. While cross-resistance was also observed between \"type I\" and first-generation \"type II\" FLT3 inhibitors, the high potency of the second-generation \"type II\" inhibitors was sufficient to potently kill \"type I\" inhibitor-resistant mutant FLT3-expressing cells. The increased potency observed for the second-generation \"type II\" inhibitors was observed to be due to an improved interaction with the ATP pocket of FLT3, specifically associated with introduction of a piperazine moiety and placement of an amino group in position 2 of the pyrimidine ring. Thus, we present 2 structurally novel classes of FLT3 inhibitors characterized by high selectivity and potency toward mutant FLT3 as a molecular target. In addition, presentation of the antileukemic effects of \"type II\" inhibitors, such as AUZ454 and ATH686, highlights a new class of highly potent FLT3 inhibitors able to override drug resistance that less potent \"type I\" inhibitors and \"type II\" first-generation FLT3 inhibitors cannot.",

These proteins are overexpressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts and we hypothesized that Pim kinase inhibition would affect AML cell survival. Imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine compound, SGI-1776 inhibits Pim-1, Pim-2 and Pim-3, and was evaluated in AML-cell line, -xenograft model, and -primary blasts. Treatment of AML cells with SGI-1776 results in a concentration-dependent induction of apoptosis and we investigated its effect on Pim kinase functions. Phosphorylation of traditional Pim kinase targets, c-Myc(Ser62) and 4E-BP1 (Thr36/Thr47), were both decreased in actively cycling AML cell lines MV-4-11, MOLM-13 and OCI-AML-3. Levels of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), XIAP, and proapoptotic Bak and Bax were unchanged; however, a significant reduction in Mcl-1 was observed. This was correlated with inhibition of global RNA and protein synthesis and MCL-1 transcript decline after SGI-1776 treatment. These data suggest that SGI-1776 mechanism in AML involves Mcl-1 protein reduction. Consistent with cell line data, xenograft model studies with mice bearing MV-4-11 tumors showed efficacy with SGI-1776.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs of 19-25 nucleotides in length that have been linked to the development of cancer. Here, we investigated the role of miRNAs in the biology of NPMc+ AML. The miRNA expression was evaluated in 85 adult de novo AML patients characterized for subcellular localization/mutation status of NPM1 and FLT3 mutations using a custom microarray platform. Data were analyzed by using univariate t test within BRB tools. We identified a strong miRNA signature that distinguishes NPMc+ mutated (n = 55) from the cytoplasmic-negative (NPM1 unmutated) cases (n = 30) and includes the up-regulation of miR-10a, miR-10b, several let-7 and miR-29 family members. Many of the down-regulated miRNAs including miR-204 and miR-128a are predicted to target several HOX genes. Indeed, we confirmed that miR-204 targets HOXA10 and MEIS1, suggesting that the HOX up-regulation observed in NPMc+ AML may be due in part by loss of HOX regulators-miRNAs. FLT3-ITD+ samples were characterized by up-regulation of miR-155. Further experiments demonstrated that the up-regulation of miR-155 was independent from FLT3 signaling. Our results identify a unique miRNA signature associated with NPMc+ AML and provide evidence that support a role for miRNAs in the regulation of HOX genes in this leukemia subtype. Moreover, we found that miR-155 was strongly but independently associated with FLT3-ITD mutations.",

At the latter checkpoint, MRD levels quantified by RQ-PCR in AML with fusion genes also have the strongest prognostic power. In addition, highly predictive initial expression levels have been identified by RQ-PCR. Both methods are capable of early detection of relapse. Through the use of all available markers including NPM1 mutations and FLT3 mutations in addition to fusion genes, RQ-PCR-based MRD assessment is possible in more than half of patients, whereas MFC is applicable to most AML cases.

Using methylation-specific PCR MSP, we analyzed the methylation profile of 45 cases of AML and 43 cases of MDS. We also studied the distribution of MTHFR A1298C and MTHFR C677T polymorphisms and FLT3 mutations in AML patients and correlated the results with hypermethylation in the SNK/PLK2 CpG island. The SNK/PLK2 CpG island was hypermethylated in 68.9% and 88.4% of AML and MDS cases, respectively. Cases with hypermethylation had a trend towards more favorable overall survival (OS). There was no association between different MTHFR genotypes and susceptibility to develop AML. SNK/PLK2 hypermethylation combined with the MTHFR AA1298 genotype was associated with a tendency for a better OS. Similarly, patients with SNK/PLK2 hypermethylation combined with the MTHFR CT677 polymorphism had a better OS (HR = 0.34; p = 0.017). SNK/PLK2 methylation associated with unmutated FLT3 cases had a trend for better OS compared to patients with mutated FLT3 gene. SNK/PLK2 is a novel epigenetically regulated gene in AML and MDS, and methylation occurs at high frequency in both diseases.

We show that in mice, premalignant myeloid cells harboring a Kras(G12D) allele retained low levels of Ras signaling owing to negative feedback involving Spry4 that prevented transformation. In humans, SPRY4 is located on chromosome 5q, a region affected by large heterozygous deletions that are associated with aggressive disease in which gain-of-function mutations in the RAS pathway are rare. These 5q deletions often co-occur with chromosome 17 alterations involving the deletion of NF1 (another RAS negative regulator) and TP53. Accordingly, combined suppression of Spry4, Nf1 and p53 produces high levels of Ras signaling and drives AML in mice. Thus, SPRY4 is a tumor suppressor at 5q whose disruption contributes to a lethal AML subtype that appears to acquire RAS pathway activation through a loss of negative regulators. ",

Those patients harboring mutations in the FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase have a particularly poor prognosis; however, significant excitement has been generated by the emergence of a variety of targeted inhibitors capable of suppressing FLT3 signaling in vivo. Here we will review results from preclinical studies and early clinical trials evaluating both first- and second-generation FLT3 inhibitors. Early FLT3 inhibitors (including sunitinib, midostaurin, and lestaurtinib) demonstrated significant promise in preclinical models of FLT3 mutant AML. Unfortunately, many of these compounds failed to achieve robust and sustained FLT3 inhibition in early clinical trials, at best resulting in only transient decreases in peripheral blast counts. These results have prompted the development of second-generation FLT3 inhibitors, epitomized by the novel agent quizartinib. These second-generation inhibitors have demonstrated enhanced FLT3 specificity and have been generally well tolerated in early clinical trials. Several FLT3 inhibitors have reached phase III clinical trials, and a variety of phase I/II trials exploring a role for these novel compounds in conjunction with conventional chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are ongoing. Finally, molecular insights provided by FLT3 inhibitors have shed light upon the variety of mechanisms underlying the acquisition of resistance and have provided a rationale supporting the use of combinatorial regimens with other emerging targeted therapies.

Activation of signal transduction in AML may occur through a variety of genetic alterations affecting different signaling molecules, such as the FLT3 and KIT receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and members of the RAS family of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins. These mutant signaling proteins are attractive therapeutic targets; however, developing targeted therapies for each genotypic variant and determining the relationships between different genotypes and critical functional dependencies of the leukemic cells remain major challenges. As the large number of mutant signaling proteins that have been identified in AML are likely to reflect activation of a more limited number of downstream effector pathways, such as the RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT cascades, targeting these unifying pathways may represent a more broadly applicable therapeutic strategy. Furthermore, integrative genomic studies combining DNA sequencing, DNA copy number analysis, transcriptional profiling, and functional genetic approaches hold great promise for identifying additional signaling abnormalities in AML that are relevant to leukemogenesis and can be exploited therapeutically.

Activation of proteins by phosphorylation of tyrosine residues is a common mechanism in leukemia development. Therefore, specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have been developed for AML therapy and are currently under investigation. The staurosporine derivate PKC412 (Midostaurin) was found to be an effective inhibitor of the FLT3-RTK and is currently undergoing clinical trials for FLT3-mutated AML patients. Since resistance towards TKIs has been observed in vitro and in clinical trials, we have generated a PKC412-resistant clone (MV4-11r) of the human myelomonoblastic cell line MV4-11, which carries a homozygous FLT3-ITD mutation. MV4-11r displayed higher vitality after addition of PKC412 compared with MV4-11 with a pronounced reduction of apoptotic cells. Cytogenetic characterization revealed the acquisition of additional aberrations in the resistant cell line such as clonal alterations at chromosome 13q with additional FLT3 signals. Microarray analysis revealed significant expression changes in several genes prior to and after incubation with PKC412. The expression status of candidate genes being regulated by FLT-ITD like JAG1, p53, MCL-1, C-KIT, and FLT3/-L was confirmed by real-time PCR. In summary, resistance against PKC412 appears to be mediated by up-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes and down-regulation of proapoptotic signals as well as genes that are involved in normal and malignant hematopoiesis.",

The frequency of spontaneous colony formation was significantly high in CML in MC (55%) and AML French-American-British (FAB) subtype M4 (48%) compared with M2 (16%). No spontaneous colony was formed in any of the patients with M1 and M3. The frequency of proliferative response to various HGF alone and in combination according to FAB subtype and CML in MC was as follows: that to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was lowest in M1 and CML in MC (50%) compared with other FAB subtypes (>or=86%), that to granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) was lowest in CML in MC (44%) compared with FAB subtypes (>or=74%), and that to interleukin-3 (IL-3) was lowest in CML in MC (30%) compared with FAB subtypes (>or=78%). SCF and FL stimulated blast colony formation in 11% and 17% of patients with M3, respectively, but there was no response to both, and in 60% and 57% of patients with CML in MC, respectively, with 14% showing a response to both. The frequency of proliferative response to both SCF and FL increased in the order of M1 (33%), M2 (63%), M4-5 (95%), and M6 (100%). The results are summarized as follows: absence of spontaneous colony formation and response to HGF other than SCF and FL, designated as HGF-dependent growth (M3); spontaneous colony formation and lowest response to HGF, designated as autonomous growth (CML in MC); and spontaneous colony formation and highest response to HGF including SCF and FL, designated as autocrine growth (M4-6).

Iodinin showed selective toxicity to AML and acute promyelocytic (APL) leukemia cells, with EC50 values for cell death up to  40 times lower for leukemia cells when compared with normal cells. Iodinin also successfully induced cell death in patient-derived leukemia cells or cell lines with  features associated with poor prognostic such as FLT3 internal tandem duplications or mutated/deficient p53. The cell death had typical apoptotic morphology, and activation of apoptotic signaling proteins like caspase-3. Molecular modeling suggested that iodinin could intercalate between bases in the DNA in a way similar to the anti-cancer drug daunorubicin (DNR), causing DNA-strand breaks. Iodinin induced apoptosis in several therapy-resistant AML-patient blasts, but to a low degree in peripheral blood leukocytes, and in contrast to DNR, not in rat cardiomyoblasts. The low activity towards normal cell types that are usually affected by anti-leukemia therapy suggests that iodinin and related compounds represent promising structures in the development of anti-cancer therapy.",

Internal tandem duplications of the juxtamembrane region of FLT3 (FLT3/ITD) constitutively activate survival and proliferation pathways, and are associated with a poor prognosis in AML. We suspected that alteration of small non-coding microRNA (miRNA) expression in these leukemia cells is involved in the transformation process and used miRNA microarrays to determine the miRNA signature from total RNA harvested from FLT3/ITD expressing FDC-P1 cells (FD-FLT3/ITD). This revealed that a limited set of miRNAs appeared to be affected by expression of FLT3/ITD compared to the control group consisting of FDC-P1 parental cells transfected with an empty vector (FD-EV). Among differentially expressed miRNAs, we selected miR-16, miR-21 and miR-223 to validate the microarray data by quantitative real-time RT-PCR showing a high degree of correlation. We further analyzed miR-16 expression with FLT3 inhibitors in FLT3/ITD expressing cells. MiR-16 was found to be one of most significantly down-regulated miRNAs in FLT3/ITD expressing cells and was up-regulated upon FLT3 inhibition. The data suggests that miR-16 is acting as a tumour suppressor gene in FLT3/ITD-mediated leukemic transformation. Whilst miR-16 has been reported to target multiple mRNAs, computer models from public bioinformatic resources predicted a potential regulatory mechanism between miR-16 and Pim-1 mRNA. In support of this interaction, miR-16 was shown to suppress Pim-1 reporter gene expression. Further, our data demonstrated that over-expression of miR-16 mimics suppressed Pim-1 expression in FD-FLT3/ITD cells suggesting that increased miR-16 expression contributes to depletion of Pim-1 after FLT3 inhibition and that miR-16 repression may be associated with up-regulated Pim-1 in FLT3/ITD expressing cells.",

The ITD mutation in FLT3 exon 14, 15 of bone marrow mononuclear cells was detected by genomic DNA-PCR, the TKD point mutation in FLT3 exon 20 was detected by genomic DNA-PCR combined with restriction endonuclease digest. The results indicated that among 131 newly diagnosed AML patients, 21 patients (16.0%) showed FLT3-ITD positive, 3 patients (2.3%) showed FLT3-TKD positive. None was found harboring both mutations. The WBC and bone marrow blast counts in FLT3-ITD positive patients seemed both higher than those in patients with wild-type FLT3 (FLT3-wt), but there was significant difference only in WBC count (p<0.05). The complete remission (CR) rate in FLT3-ITD positive patients was 47.6%, which was significantly lower than that in FLT3-wt patients (88.1%, p<0.05). There was no statistical difference in CR rate between FLT3-ITD positive and negative patients in 20 cases of M3; the CR rate in FLT3-ITD positive patients with non M(3) was 37.5 (6/16) which was obviously lower than that in FLT3-wt patients with non M3 (90.6%, 48/53) (p<0.05). 3 FLT3-ITD positive patients with CR relapsed after CR for 14 (2-20) months with relapse rate 50% (3/6) which was higher than that in FLT3-wt patients (29.2%, 14/48). It is concluded that FLT3 mutation is common in AML patients, while FLT3-ITD mutation is more frequent than FLT3-TKD mutation. The AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutation have a poor prognosis, while FLT3-TKD point mutation does not significantly influences prognosis of the patients.

Traditionally, AML classification and risk stratification relied on cytogenetic studies; however, molecular detection of gene mutations is playing an increasingly important role in classification, risk stratification, and management of AML. Molecular testing does not take the place of cytogenetic testing results, but plays a complementary role to help refine prognosis, especially within specific AML subgroups. With the exception of acute promyelocytic leukemia, AML therapy is not targeted but the intensity of therapy is driven by the prognostic subgroup. Many prognostic scoring systems classify patients into favorable, poor, or intermediate prognostic subgroups based on clinical and genetic features. Current standard of care combines cytogenetic results with targeted testing for mutations in FLT3, NPM1, CEBPA, and KIT to determine the prognostic subgroup. Other gene mutations have also been demonstrated to predict prognosis and may play a role in future risk stratification, although some of these have not been confirmed in multiple studies or established as standard of care. This paper will review the contribution of cytogenetic results to prognosis in AML and then will focus on molecular mutations that have a prognostic or possible therapeutic impact. ",

FLT3-ITD is associated with leukocytosis and a poor prognosis, especially in patients with normal karyotype. Recently, there have been three reports on point mutations at codon 835 of the FLT3 gene (D835 mutations) in adult AML.

Targeting FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase has shown encouraging results in treating FLT3-mutated AML. Responses, however, are not sustained and acquired resistance has been a clinical challenge. Treatment options to overcome resistance are currently the focus of research. We report here the preclinical evaluation of AMG 925, a potent, selective, and bioavailable FLT3/cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) dual kinase inhibitor. AMG 925 inhibited AML xenograft tumor growth by 96% to 99% without significant body weight loss. The antitumor activity of AMG 925 correlated with the inhibition of STAT5 and RB phosphorylation, the pharmacodynamic markers for inhibition of FLT3 and CDK4, respectively. In addition, AMG 925 was also found to inhibit FLT3 mutants (e.g., D835Y) that are resistant to the current FLT3 inhibitors (e.g., AC220 and sorafenib). CDK4 is a cyclin D-dependent kinase that plays an essential central role in regulating cell proliferation in response to external growth signals. A critical role of the CDK4-RB pathway in cancer development has been well established. CDK4-specific inhibitors are being developed for treating RB-positive cancer. AMG 925, which combines inhibition of two kinases essential for proliferation and survival of FLT3-mutated AML cells, may improve and prolong clinical responses.",

We show defects in the response of mutant FLT3 AML cells to the S-phase drug clofarabine that could account for the apparent contradiction.;We studied responses of AML cells to clofarabine in vitro.;When treated with a short pulse of clofarabine, FLT3-ITD-harboring MOLM-13 and MV4.11 cells undergo similar damage levels (gammaH2AX foci) to wild-type cells but have a better repair capability than wild-type cells. However, whereas the wild-type cells undergo rapid S-phase arrest, the S-phase checkpoint fails in mutant cells. Cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage in S phase is effected via loss of the transcriptional regulator cdc25A. This loss is reduced or absent in clofarabine-treated FLT3 mutant cells. Furthermore, cdc25A message levels are maintained by the FLT3-ITD, such that message is reduced by 87.5% on exposure to FLT3 small interfering RNA. Primary FLT3-ITD samples from untreated patients also display impaired cell cycle arrest and show enhanced sensitivity on prolonged treatment with clofarabine compared with wild-type samples.;There is a reversal of phenotype in mutant FLT3 cells dependent on the length of exposure to clofarabine. Efficient DNA repair may render the cells resistant to a short pulse of the drug, but a failure of cell cycle checkpoint(s) in S phase renders the cells sensitive to prolonged exposure.",

Fourteen patients had de novo AML and 4 patients had a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Fifteen patients had a progressive clinical course with refractory or relapsed disease. The median overall survival was 5 months (range, 2 to 48 months). Only 1 patient achieved complete remission after undergoing stem cell transplantation.

The Gnn gene is conserved in mice and humans. Expression of fusion constructs between GFP and Gnn cDNA isoforms in HEK-293 cells showed that Gnn proteins are located mainly in the cytoplasm. Immunoblotting experiments demonstrated the presence of multiple Gnn protein isoforms in most organs, with the lowest levels of expression of the protein detected in bone marrow and spleen. The Evi12-containing leukemia cell line NFS107 showed high levels of expression of a approximately 150-kDa Gnn isoform (Gnn107) that was not observed in control cell lines. Overexpression may be due to the viral insertion in Evi12. The Gnn107 protein is probably encoded by a Gnn cDNA isoform that is expressed exclusively in NFS107 cells and that includes sequences of TU12B1-TY, a putative protein with homology to 5'-nucleotidase enzymes. Interestingly, using Affymetrix gene expression data of a cohort of 285 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we found that GNN/TU12B1-TY expression was specifically increased in two AML clusters. One cluster consisted of all AML patients with a t(8;21) translocation, and the second cluster consisted of AML patients with a normal karyotype carrying a FLT3 internal tandem duplication.

The expression of CD97, an EGF-TM7 receptor, has been linked to invasive behavior in thyroid and colorectal cancer. Here, we have investigated the association of CD97 with FLT3-ITD and its functional consequences in AML.Higher CD97 expression levels have been detected in 208 out of 385 primary AML samples. This was accompanied by a significantly increased bone marrow blast count as well as by mutations in the FLT3 gene. FLT3-ITD expressing cell lines as MV4-11 and MOLM-13 revealed significantly higher CD97 levels than FLT3 wildtype EOL-1, OCI-AML3 and HL-60 cells which were clearly decreased by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors PKC412 and SU5614. CD97 knock down by short hairpin RNA in MV4-11 cells resulted in inhibited trans-well migration towards fetal calf serum (FCS) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) being at least in part Rho-A dependent. Moreover, knock down of CD97 led to an altered mechanical phenotype, reduced adhesion to a stromal layer and lower wildtype FLT3 expression.Our results, thus, constitute the first evidence for the functional relevance of CD97 expression in FLT3-ITD AML cells rendering it a potential new theragnostic target.

FLT3/ITD and FLT3/D835 mutations were analyzed in 113 Serbian adult AML patients using polymerase chain reaction. Twenty patients were found to be FLT3/ITD positive (17.7%). The mutations occurred most frequently in M5 and M0 subtypes of AML. They were mainly associated with the normal karyotype. All patients harboring FLT3/ITD had a higher number of white blood cells than patients without it (p = 0.027). FLT3/ITD mutations were associated with lower complete remission (CR) rate (chi (2 )= 5.706; p = 0.017) and shorter overall survival (OS; Log rank = 8.76; p = 0.0031). As for disease-free survival, the difference between FLT3/ITD-positive and FLT3/ITD-negative patients was not statistically significant (Log rank = 0.78; p = 0.3764). In multivariate analysis, the presence of FLT3/ITD mutations was the most significant prognostic factor for both OS and CR rate (p = 0.0287; relative risk = 1.73; 95% CI = 1.06-2.82). However, in the group of patients with the intermediate-risk karyotype, the mere presence of FLT3/ITD was not associated with inferior clinical outcome. FLT3/D835 point mutation was found in four patients (3.5%) only. Follow-up of the FLT3/ITD-positive patients revealed stability of this mutation during the course of the disease. However, changes in the pattern of FLT3/D835 mutations in initial and relapsed AML were observed. Our results indicate an association of FLT3/ITD with the adverse outcome in AML patients treated with standard induction chemotherapy. Because FLT3/ITD mutation is a target for specific therapeutic inhibition, its early detection could be helpful in clinical practice.",

We used high density genome-wide genotyping and gene expression profiling to reveal acquired cryptic abnormalities in acute myeloid leukemia. By genome-wide genotyping of 137 cases of primary acute myeloid leukemia, we disclosed a recurrent focal amplification on chromosome 14q32, which included the genes BCL11B, CCNK, C14orf177 and SETD3, in two cases. In the affected cases, the BCL11B gene showed consistently high mRNA expression, whereas the expression of the other genes was unperturbed. Fluorescence in situ hybridization on 40 cases of acute myeloid leukemia with high BCL11B mRNA expression [2.5-fold above median; 40 out of 530 cases (7.5%)] revealed 14q32 abnormalities in two additional cases. In the four BCL11B-rearranged cases the 14q32 locus was fused to different partner chromosomes. In fact, in two cases, we demonstrated that the focal 14q32 amplifications were integrated into transcriptionally active loci. The translocations involving BCL11B result in increased expression of full-length BCL11B protein. The BCL11B-rearranged acute myeloid leukemias expressed both myeloid and T-cell markers. These biphenotypic acute leukemias all carried FLT3 internal tandem duplications, a characteristic marker of acute myeloid leukemia. BCL11B mRNA expression in acute myeloid leukemia appeared to be strongly associated with expression of other T-cell-specific genes. Myeloid 32D(GCSF-R) cells ectopically expressing Bcl11b showed decreased proliferation rate and less maturation. In conclusion, by an integrated approach involving high-throughput genome-wide genotyping and gene expression profiling we identified BCL11B as a candidate oncogene in acute myeloid leukemia. ",

Thirty-eight mutations were detected in 36 patients (29%): 36 nucleotide substitutions, mostly affecting amino-acid residue R882 and two frameshift deletions. DNMT3A mutations were significantly associated with the French-American-British subtypes M4/M5 and the presence of NPM1 mutations. In the whole cohort, DNMT3A mutated patients had a shorter event-free survival (5-year EFS: 13% vs 32%, P = 0.02) and overall survival (5-year OS: 23% vs 45%, P = 0.02) compared with DNMT3A wild-type patients.

Mononuclear cells were collected from bone marrow on time points established according to the AML-BFM 2004 INTERIM protocol. Collected cells were isolated on Ficoll gradient, and RNA and DNA were isolated using TRIZOL reagent. To synthesize cDNA an amount of 1 mg of total RNA was used. To perform quantitative RT-PCR and RQ-PCR reactions 4 fusion gene transcripts (AML1-ETO, CBFb-MYH11, PML-RARA /subtype bcrl and bcr3/) were used according to the protocol established by Europe Against Cancer Program. An expression of WT1 gene was tested additionally. An analysis of ABL control gene was used to normalize of achieved results. Determination of duplication of FLT3 gene in DNA sample was performed with starters complementary to JM region. Genotyping was performed in 75 patients with acute myeloid leukemia so far. AML1-ETO fusion gene transcript was found in 14 patients (19%). PML-RARA (subtype bcr3) and CBFB-MYH11 gene transcripts were detected in 3 (4%) and 3 (4%) patients, respectively. Duplication of FLT3 gene was found in 4 (5.3%) cases. Between 67 tested children over expression of WT1 was present in 51 patients (76%). Analysis of MRD level in subsequent time points showed systematic decrease of number of fusion gene transcript copies and gene WT1 expression. To establish the rate of molecular marker presence in AML in children and the influence of the presence of MRD on the treatment results as well, the study has to be conducted on a larger group of patients with longer follow-up.",

Using Genescan analysis, we found that FLT3/ITD levels at first relapse were significantly higher than those at diagnosis (mean +/- SE, 40.5% +/- 4.8% versus 17.9% +/- 3.6%, P <.001). The increase in mutation levels at relapse as compared with diagnosis did not correlate with the difference in blast cell percentages at both stages (P =.777).

        "Doc_abstract":"Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) is an important growth factor receptor in hematopoiesis. Gain-of-function mutations of the receptor contribute to the transformation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Src-like adaptor protein (SLAP) is an interaction partner of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl that can regulate receptor tyrosine kinases-mediated signal transduction. In this study, we analyzed the role of SLAP in signal transduction downstream of the type III receptor tyrosine kinase Flt3. The results show that upon ligand stimulation SLAP stably associates with Flt3 through multiple phosphotyrosine residues in Flt3. SLAP constitutively interacts with oncogenic Flt3-ITD and co-localizes with Flt3 near the cell membrane. This association initiates Cbl-dependent receptor ubiquitination and degradation. Depletion of SLAP expression by shRNA in Flt3-transfected Ba/F3 cells resulted in a weaker activation of FL-induced PI3K-Akt and MAPK signaling. Meta-analysis of microarray data from patient samples suggests that SLAP mRNA is differentially expressed in different cancers and its expression was significantly increased in patients carrying the Flt3-ITD mutation. Thus, our data suggest a novel role of SLAP in different cancers and in modulation of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling apart from its conventional role in regulation of receptor stability.",

As regards the immunophenotype characteristics the FLT3/ITD(+) group very often expressed monocytic markers (CD36 and CD11b) and less commonly immature markers (CD34 and CD117). A promyelocytic-like immunophenotype pattern was also detected in a minority of these patients(4/36).;The FLT3/ITD(+) patients had a shorter overall survival, a shorter event-free survival and a higher probability of relapse. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was investigated in the FLT3/ITD(+) patients using flow cytometry. This technique had a sensitivity of 62% and a specificity of 83% in relapse prediction. Minimal residual disease analysis was hampered by the low number of patients with detectable aberrant immunophenotype.;A high frequency of changes in the phenotype and/or genotype pattern between diagnosis and relapse was detected (5/6). FLT3/ITD is a frequent molecular lesion in de novo adult AML and seems to be associated with a monocytic differentiation, a high leukocyte count and a poor prognosis. Immunophenotype and genotype patterns observed at relapse suggest that the FLT3/ITD(+) blasts may be genetically unstable and prone to clonal evolution.

A FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation, found in approximately a quarter of patients with de novo AML, imparts a particularly poor prognosis. Patients with FLT3-ITD AML often present with more aggressive disease and have a significantly higher propensity for relapse after remission. The therapeutic approach for these patients has traditionally included intensive induction chemotherapy, followed by consolidative chemotherapy or hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). In recent years, multiple small molecule inhibitors of the FLT3 tyrosine kinase have been studied preclinically and in clinical trials. The earlier generation of these agents, often non-specific and impacting a variety of tyrosine kinases, produced at best transient peripheral blood responses in early clinical trials. Additionally, the combination of FLT3 inhibitors with cytotoxic regimens has not, as of yet, demonstrated an improvement in overall survival. Nevertheless, multiple current trials, including those with sorafenib, lestaurtinib, and midostaurin, continue to study the combination of FLT3 inhibitors with standard chemotherapy. Factors such as sustained FLT3 inhibition, protein binding, pharmacokinetics, and the presence of elevated FLT3-ligand levels appear to significantly impact the potency of these agents in vivo. In recent years, the development of more specific and potent agents has generated hope that FLT3 inhibitors may play a more prominent role in the treatment of FLT3-ITD AML in the near future. Nevertheless, questions remain regarding the optimal timing and schedule for incorporation of FLT3 inhibitors. The suitability, type, and timing of allogeneic HCT in the therapeutic approach for these patients are also issues which require further study and definition. Recent retrospective data appears to support the efficacy of allogeneic HCT in first complete remission, possibly due to a graft versus leukemia effect. However, larger prospective studies are necessary to further elucidate the role of HCT and its potential combination with FLT3 inhibitor therapy. We are hopeful that current clinical investigation will lead to an optimization and improvement of outcomes for these patients.",

Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is characterized commonly by a fusion between the PML gene and the RARA gene, genes targetable by arsenic (ATO) and retinoic acid (ATRA), respectively. A mutation in GATA1, common in AML of Down syndrome (ML-DS), renders cells more susceptible to cytarabine and anthracyclines, thus permitting targeted dose reductions to preserve high survival rates while reducing toxicity. In all other patients, Ras pathway mutations, KMT2A and other methyltransferase mutations, FLT3 mutations, and KIT mutations are all relatively common in childhood AML and all are potentially \"druggable\". The focus of this review is on those therapies likely to be clinically available in the near future. The preclinical and clinical data providing a rationale for testing in children of specific agents in children is discussed. Whether the expression of a potential target is sufficient to predict response to a targeted therapy is an open question in childhood AML.

In the context of cancer, detailed signaling studies have resulted in the development of some of the most frequently used means of therapy, with several well established examples such as the small molecule inhibitors imatinib and dasatinib in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. Impaired function of receptor tyrosine kinases is implicated in various types of tumors, and much effort is put into mapping the many interactions and downstream pathways. Here we discuss the hematopoietic growth factor receptors c-Kit and Flt3 and their downstream signaling in normal as well as malignant cells. Both receptors are members of the same family of tyrosine kinases and crucial mediators of stem-and progenitor-cell proliferation and survival in response to ligand stimuli from the surrounding microenvironment. Gain-of-function mutations/alterations render the receptors constitutively and ligand-independently activated, resulting in aberrant signaling which is a crucial driving force in tumorigenesis. Frequently found mutations in c-Kit and Flt3 are point mutations of aspartic acid 816 and 835 respectively, in the activation loop of the kinase domains. Several other point mutations have been identified, but in the case of Flt3, the most common alterations are internal tandem duplications (ITDs) in the juxtamembrane region, reported in approximately 30% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). During the last couple of years, the increasing understanding of c-Kit and Flt3 signaling has also revealed the complexity of these receptor systems. The impact of gain-of-function mutations of c-Kit and Flt3 in different malignancies is well established and shown to be of clinical relevance in both prognosis and therapy. Many inhibitors of both c-Kit or Flt3 or of their downstream substrates are in clinical trials with encouraging results, and targeted therapy using a combination of such inhibitors is considered a promising approach for future treatments.",

Further, GEP allowed for detecting new biologically and prognostically relevant subclasses within the defined subgroups, mainly in the normal karyotype AML. These new classifiers cross the borders of traditionally defined prognostic parameters, and some of these gene expression signatures were independently validated by different study groups. The development of treatment-specific sensitivity assays being able to predict the individual patient's response to targeted therapy is another interesting perspective.

        "Doc_abstract":"Activating fetal liver tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) mutations represent the most common genetic aberrations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Most commonly, they occur as internal tandem duplications in the juxtamembrane domain (Flt3-ITD) that transform myeloid cells in vitro and in vivo and that induce aberrant signaling and biologic functions. We identified RGS2, a regulator of G-protein signaling, as a gene specifically repressed by Flt3-ITD. Here we demonstrate an important role of RGS2 in Flt3-ITD-mediated transformation. RGS2 was repressed after forced expression of activating Flt3 mutations in 2 myeloid cell lines (32Dcl3 and NB4). Furthermore, RGS2 was repressed in Flt3-mutation-positive AML cases in comparison to Flt3-mutation-negative cases, especially in Flt3-ITD-positive cases with a high ITD-to-wild-type (WT) ratio. Coexpression of RGS2 with Flt3-ITD inhibited Flt3-ITD-induced autonomous proliferation and clonal growth of 32D cells. RGS2 also inhibited Flt3-ITD-induced phosphorylation of Akt and glycogen synthase kinase beta (Gsk3-beta) without influencing signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) activation. In addition, RGS2 reinduced the expression of Flt3-ITD-repressed CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (c/EBPalpha) and antagonized the Flt3-ITD-induced differentiation block in 32D cells. Expression analyses in myeloid cell lines revealed induction of RGS2 during granulocytic but not during monocytic differentiation. Taken together, RGS2 is a novel mediator of myeloid differentiation, and its repression is an important event in Flt3-ITD-induced transformation.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Pediatric acute myeloid leukemia is a heterogeneous disease characterized by non-random genetic aberrations related to outcome. The genetic subtype is currently detected by different diagnostic procedures which differ in success rate and/or specificity.;We examined the potential of gene expression profiles to classify pediatric acute myeloid leukemia. Gene expression microarray data of 237 children with acute myeloid leukemia were collected and a double-loop cross validation approach was used to generate a subtype-predictive gene expression profile in the discovery cohort (n=157) which was then tested for its true predictive value in the independent validation cohort (n=80). The classifier consisted of 75 probe sets, representing the top 15 discriminating probe sets for MLL-rearranged, t(8;21)(q22;q22), inv(16)(p13q22), t(15;17)(q21;q22) and t(7;12)(q36;p13)-positive acute myeloid leukemia.;These cytogenetic subtypes represent approximately 40% of cases of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia and were predicted with 92% and 99% accuracy in the discovery and independent validation cohort, respectively. However, for NPM1, CEBPA, MLL(-PTD), FLT3(-ITD), KIT, PTPN11 and N/K-RAS gene expression signatures had limited predictive value. This may be caused by a limited frequency of these mutations and by underlying cytogenetics. This latter is exemplified by the fact that different gene expression signatures were discovered for FLT3-ITD in patients with normal cytogenetics and in those with t(15;17)(q21;q22)-positive acute myeloid leukemia, which pointed to HOXB-upregulation being specific for FLT3-ITD(+) cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia.;In conclusion, gene expression profiling correctly predicted the most prevalent cytogenetic subtypes of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia with high accuracy. In clinical practice, this gene expression signature may replace multiple diagnostic tests for approximately 40% of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia cases whereas only for the remaining cases (predicted as 'acute myeloid leukemia-other') are additional tests indicated. Moreover, the discriminative genes reveal new insights into the biology of acute myeloid leukemia subtypes that warrants follow-up as potential targets for new therapies.",

We here present a novel low molecular weight kinase inhibitor, AKN-032, targeting the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) and discovered in a new type of screening funnel combining the target therapy approach with sequential cellular screens. AKN-032 was identified among 150 selected hits from three different high throughput kinase screens. Further characterization showed inhibitory activity on FLT3 enzyme with an IC(50) of 70 nM. Western blot analysis revealed reduced autophosphorylation of the FLT3-receptor in AML cell line MV4-11 cells after exposure to AKN-032. Flow cytometry disclosed cytotoxic activity against MV4-11, but not against non-malignant 3T3-L1 fibroblast cells. Using a fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay, AKN-032 was tested against 15 cell lines and displayed a potent cytotoxic activity in AML cell lines MV4-11 (IC(50)=0.4 μM) and Kasumi-1 (IC(50)=2.3 μM). AKN-032 was also highly cytotoxic in tumor cells from AML patients in vitro. Furthermore, AKN-032 demonstrated significant antileukemic effect in a relatively resistant in vivo hollow fiber mouse model. No major toxicity was observed in the animals. In conclusion, AKN-032 is a promising new kinase inhibitor with significant in vivo and in vitro activity in AML. Results from the hollow fiber mouse assay suggest a favorable toxicity profile. Future studies will focus on pharmacokinetic properties, toxicity as well as further clarifying the mechanisms of action of AKN-032 in AML.",

This has made FLT3-activating mutations an attractive drug target because they are probable driver mutations of this disease. As more potent FLT3 inhibitors are developed, a predictable development of resistance-conferring point mutations, commonly at residue D835, has been observed. Crenolanib is a highly selective and potent FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with activity against the internal tandem duplication (FLT3/ITD) mutants and the FLT3/D835 point mutants. We tested crenolanib against a panel of D835 mutant cell lines and primary patient blasts and observed superior cytotoxic effects when compared with other available FLT3 TKIs such as quizartinib and sorafenib. Another potential advantage of crenolanib is its reduced inhibition of c-Kit compared with quizartinib. In progenitor cell assays, crenolanib was less disruptive of erythroid colony growth, which may result in relatively less myelosuppression than quizartinib. Finally, correlative data from an ongoing clinical trial demonstrate that acute myeloid leukemia patients can achieve sufficient levels of crenolanib to inhibit both FLT3/ITD and resistance-conferring FLT3/D835 mutants in vivo. Crenolanib is thus an important next-generation FLT3 TKI.",

This mutation causes constitutive activation of FLT3 and is associated with poor prognosis. The high relapse rate of FLT3/ITD-positive AML might be partly because of insufficient eradication of slow-cycling leukaemic stem cells in the bone marrow microenvironment. β1 integrin mediates haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell homing along with their retention in the bone marrow and also inhibits haematopoietic proliferation and differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of FLT3/ITD kinase activity by a FLT3 selective inhibitor named FI-700 decreases affinity of α4β1 integrin to soluble VCAM-1. α4β1 integrin deactivation by FI-700 is independent of Rap1, which is the critical regulator of integrin inside-out signalling. In addition, selective inhibition of FLT3/ITD induces Pyk2 dephosphorylation together with the inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. Both wild-type and ITD-FLT3 proteins co-immunoprecipitated with β1 integrin and Pyk2 indicating the signal crosstalk between FLT3, β1 integrin and Pyk2. These results collectively indicated that the inhibition of FLT3 kinase might contribute not only to the induction of apoptosis, but also to the leukaemia cell detachment from the bone marrow microenvironment in the treatment of AML.",

At diagnosis, 15 aberrations (CNAs, n = 10; UPDs, n = 5) were identified in 13 patients (25%), whereas at relapse, 56 genomic alterations (CNAs, n = 46; UPDs, n = 10) were detected in 29 patients (55%) indicating an increase in genomic complexity.

We sought the first independent validation of the prognostic value of this signature. Using oligonucleotide microarrays to measure gene expression in samples from uniformly treated adults with karyotypically normal AML, we performed cluster analysis based on the previously identified signature. We also developed a well-defined classification rule using the signature to predict outcome for individual patients. Cluster analysis confirmed the prognostic utility of the signature: patient clusters differed in overall (P = .001) and disease-free (P = .001) survival. The signature-based classifier identified groups with differences in overall (P = .02) and disease-free (P = .05) survival. A strong association of the outcome classifier with the prognostically adverse FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3 ITD) potentially explained the prognostic significance of the signature. However, in the subgroup of patients without FLT3 ITD there was a moderate difference in survival for the classifier-derived groups.

Studies have shown that inhibitors of PI3K/AKT signaling, such as wortmannin and LY294002, are able to inhibit CML and AML cell proliferation and synergize with targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We investigated the ability of BAG956, a dual PI3K/PDK-1 inhibitor, to be used in combination with inhibitors of BCR-ABL and mutant FLT3, as well as with the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, and the rapamycin derivative, RAD001. BAG956 was shown to block AKT phosphorylation induced by BCR-ABL-, and induce apoptosis of BCR-ABL-expressing cell lines and patient bone marrow cells at concentrations that also inhibit PI3K signaling. Enhancement of the inhibitory effects of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, imatinib and nilotinib, by BAG956 was demonstrated against BCR-ABL expressing cells both in vitro and in vivo. We have also shown that BAG956 is effective against mutant FLT3-expressing cell lines and AML patient bone marrow cells. Enhancement of the inhibitory effects of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PKC412, by BAG956 was demonstrated against mutant FLT3-expressing cells. Finally, BAG956 and rapamycin/RAD001 were shown to combine in a nonantagonistic fashion against BCR-ABL- and mutant FLT3-expressing cells both in vitro and in vivo.",

Uncovering novel regions of aUPD has the potential to identify previously unknown mutational targets. We therefore aimed to develop a map of the regions of aUPD in AML. Here, we have analyzed a large set of diagnostic AML samples (n = 454) from young adults (age: 15-55 years) using genotype arrays. Acquired UPD was found in 17% of the samples with a nonrandom distribution particularly affecting chromosome arms 13q, 11p, and 11q. Novel recurrent regions of aUPD were uncovered at 2p, 17p, 2q, 17q, 1p, and Xq. Overall, aUPDs were observed across all cytogenetic risk groups, although samples with aUPD13q (5.4% of samples) belonged exclusively to the intermediate-risk group as defined by cytogenetics. All cases with a high FLT3-ITD level, measured previously, had aUPD13q covering the FLT3 gene. Significantly, none of the samples with FLT3-ITD(-)/FLT3-TKD(+) mutation exhibited aUPD13q. Of the 119 aUPDs observed, the majority (87%) were due to mitotic recombination while only 13% were due to nondisjunction. This study demonstrates aUPD is a frequent and significant finding in AML and pinpoints regions that may contain novel mutational targets.",

Most frequent chromosomal aberrations were trisomy 22 (18%) and trisomy 8 (16%). Overall, 84% of patients harbored at least 1 gene mutation, with RAS being affected in 53% (45% NRAS; 13% KRAS) of the cases, followed by KIT (37%) and FLT3 (17%; FLT3-TKD [14%], FLT3-ITD [5%]). None of the secondary genetic lesions influenced achievement of complete remission. In multivariable analyses, KIT mutation (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.67; P = .04], log(10)(WBC) (HR = 1.33; P = .02), and trisomy 22 (HR = 0.54; P = .08) were relevant factors for relapse-free survival; for overall survival, FLT3 mutation (HR = 2.56; P = .006), trisomy 22 (HR = 0.45; P = .07), trisomy 8 (HR = 2.26; P = .02), age (difference of 10 years, HR = 1.46; P = .01), and therapy-related AML (HR = 2.13; P = .14) revealed as prognostic factors.

While clinical investigation of these agents has been largely limited to adults, clinical trials for paediatric cancer patients with many of these agents are now underway. This paper reviews the current status of molecularly-targeted therapies for paediatric malignancies, with special attention given to one class of agents, inhibitors of the FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase. FLT3 is expressed and activated in many human leukemias, including a significant percentage of pediatric AML and infant and childhood ALL, especially in the setting of MLL gene rearrangement. Activating mutations of FLT3 portend a poor prognosis in pediatric AML. Activated FLT3 can be effectively and selectively targeted by small molecule inhibitors, and these agents have shown promise in early phase clinical trials in adults with AML. Limited preclinical data with FLT3 inhibitors in MLL-rearranged ALL have also been reported. Challenges and future directions for the use of FLT3 inhibitors and other targeted agents in paediatric cancer are discussed.",

Whilst FLT3/ITD+ cells are more susceptible to the cytotoxic effects of FLT3 inhibitors than wild type (WT) cells, the sensitivity of FLT3/TKD+ cells to therapeutic agents is unclear, as is the importance of the mutant level. We therefore studied the effect of cytarabine and the FLT3 inhibitor lestaurtinib, either alone or in combination, on in vitro survival of blast cells from 36 cases of AML (14 FLT3/WT, 11 FLT3/ITD+ and 11 FLT3/TKD+). All three groups showed similar sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of cytarabine but FLT3/ITD mutant level was inversely correlated with cytarabine cytotoxicity (P = 0.04) whereas FLT3/TKD mutant level had no impact. FLT3/TKD+ cells showed a similar response to lestaurtinib as FLT3/WT cells, whereas FLT3/ITD+ cells were more sensitive (P = 0.004). There was no correlation between mutant level and lestaurtinib sensitivity for either FLT3/ITD+ or FLT3/TKD+ cells. Synergistic cytotoxicity of lestaurtinib plus cytarabine was demonstrated in all three groups. These results suggest that FLT3/TKD+ and FLT3/WT cases should not be differentiated when considering patients for treatment with FLT3 inhibitors.",

Favorable genotype in CN-AML could thus be defined by the association of NPM1m or CEBPAm with neither FLT3-ITD nor IDH1m. In IDH2m CN-AML patients, we observed a higher risk of induction failure, a higher RR and a shorter OS. In multivariate analysis, age, WBC count, the four-gene favorable genotype and IDH2m were independently associated with a higher RR and a shorter OS.;Contrarily to what is reported in gliomas, IDH1m and IDH2m in AML are associated with a poor prognosis.

A better understanding of the molecular consequences of FLT3 activation would allow improved therapeutic strategies in these patients. Canine lymphoproliferative diseases, including lymphoma and acute leukemias, share evolutionarily conserved chromosomal aberrations and exhibit conserved mutations within key oncogenes when compared to their human counterparts. A small percentage of canine acute lymphocytic leukemias (ALL) also exhibit FLT3 ITD mutations.;We molecularly characterized FLT3 mutations in two dogs and one cell line, by DNA sequencing, gene expression analysis via quantitative real-time PCR, and sensitivity to the FLT3 inhibitor lestaurtinib via in vitro proliferation assays. FLT 3 and downstream mediators of FLT3 activation were assessed by Western blotting.;The canine B-cell leukemia cell line, GL-1, and neoplastic cells from 2/7 dogs diagnosed cytologically with ALL were found to have FLT3 ITD mutations and FLT3 mRNA up-regulation. Lestaurtinib, a small molecule FLT3 inhibitor, significantly inhibited the growth of GL-1 cells, while not affecting the growth of two other canine lymphoid cell lines without the FLT3 mutation. Finally, western blots were used to confirm the conserved downstream mediators of FLT3 activating mutations.;These results show that ALL and FLT3 biology is conserved between canine and human patients, supporting the notion that canine ALL, in conjunction with the GL-1 cell line, will be useful in the development of a relevant large animal model to aid in the study of human FLT3 mutant leukemias.",

FLT3/TKD mutations are generally missense mutations or in-frame alterations of residues D835 and I836 within the activation loop of the FLT3 protein. D835 mutations have been reported to occur in ≈ 7% of AML patients. Mutations have also been reported in exon 4 of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) in ≈9% of AML patients. Mutations in FLT3/TKD and IDH1 genes were studied in AML patients from Pakistan and correlated with the laboratory findings. FLT3/TKD mutations were found in 7%, while IDH1 mutations were found in 10% Pakistani AML patients. Neither of these mutations was significantly correlated with age and sex, although the incidence of these mutations was higher in female patients.

Multiple submicroscopic genetic alterations with prognostic significance have been discovered, including internal tandem duplication of the FLT3 gene, mutations in the NPM1 gene, partial tandem duplication of the MLL gene, high expression of the BAALC gene, and mutations in the CEBPA gene. Application of gene-expression profiling has also identified a gene-expression signature that appears to separate cytogenetically normal AML patients into prognostic subgroups, although gene-expression signature-based classifiers predicting outcome for individual patients with greater accuracy are needed. These and similar future findings are likely to have a major impact on the clinical management of cytogenetically normal AML not only in prognostication but also in selection of appropriate treatment, since many of the identified genetic alterations already constitute or will potentially become targets for specific therapeutic intervention.

On univariate analysis, patients with mutated FLT3 were less likely to achieve a CR to first salvage compared to FLT3-WT patients (24% vs. 41%; P=0.09). Furthermore, survival was longer for the FLT3-WT patients achieving a second CR after salvage compared to FLT3-mutated patients (P=0.017). Overall, patients with mutated FLT3 had a shorter survival from the time of relapse compared to those with FLT3-WT (P<0.001).

Despite remarkable improvement in the treatment outcomes of these diseases over the past several decades, the prognosis for certain high-risk groups of leukemia and for relapsed disease remains poor. However, recent insights into different types of 'driver' lesions of leukemogenesis, such as the aberrant activation of signaling pathways and various epigenetic modifications, have led to the discovery of novel agents that specifically target the mechanism of transformation. In parallel, emerging approaches in cancer immunotherapy have led to newer therapies that can exploit and harness cytotoxic immunity directed against malignant cells. This review details the rationale and implementation of recent and specifically targeted therapies in acute pediatric leukemia. Topics covered include the inhibition of critical cell signaling pathways [BCR-ABL, FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and Janus-associated kinase (JAK)], proteasome inhibition, inhibition of epigenetic regulators of gene expression [DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, and disruptor of telomeric signaling-1 (DOT1L) inhibitors], monoclonal antibodies and immunoconjugated toxins, bispecific T-cell engaging (BiTE) antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor-modified (CAR) T cells.

DATA SOURCES/EXTRACTION: Data were analyzed from 7 recently published papers.;NPM1 gene mutations tend to occur more frequently in women, and also tend to be associated with a higher white blood cell count. There is no significant age difference. NPM1-mutated AML is preferentially associated with AML with monocytic differentiation (in particular FAB M5b), lack of CD34, normal cytogenetics, FLT3 gene mutations, and a trend toward favorable clinical outcome, especially in patients without FLT3 gene mutation. NPM1 gene mutations cause a frame shift in the C-terminus of exon 12, disrupting the NPM nucleolar-localization signal or generating a leucine-rich nuclear export motif, resulting in abnormal cytoplasmic accumulation of NPM. Several methods are suitable for detecting NPM1 gene mutation, including molecular and immunohistochemical studies. These mutations may contribute to leukemogenesis, at least in part, through disruption of the p14(ARF) (alternative reading frame) MDM2-p53 pathway and centrosomal duplication.;Detection of NPM1 gene mutations may allow dissection of the heterogeneous group of AML with normal karyotype into prognostically different subgroups.

Nonetheless, constitutively active mutant FLT3 (FLT3-ITD) causally contributes to transformation and is associated with poor prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) can counteract deregulated gene expression profiles and decrease oncoprotein stability, which renders them candidate drugs for AML treatment. However, these drugs have pleiotropic effects and it is often unclear how they correct oncogenic transcriptomes and proteomes. We report here that treatment of AML cells with the HDACi LBH589 induces the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBCH8 and degradation of FLT3-ITD. Gain- and loss-of-function approaches show that UBCH8 and the ubiquitin-ligase SIAH1 physically interact with and target FLT3-ITD for proteasomal degradation. These ubiquitinylating enzymes though have a significantly lesser effect on wild-type FLT3. Furthermore, physiological and pharmacological stimulation of FLT3 phosphorylation, inhibition of FLT3-ITD autophosphorylation and analysis of kinase-inactive FLT3-ITD revealed that tyrosine phosphorylation determines degradation of FLT3 and FLT3-ITD by the proteasome. These results provide novel insights into antileukemic activities of HDACi and position UBCH8, which have been implicated primarily in processes in the nucleus, as a previously unrecognized important modulator of FLT3-ITD stability and leukemic cell survival.",

The total coding region of TET2 was analyzed by direct sequencing in 215 CN-AML patients younger than 60 years from multicenter treatment trials AML-SHG 0199 (ClinicalTrials Identifier NCT00209833) and 0295. Associations were analyzed in the context of other molecular markers, such as CEBPA, DNMT3A, NMP1, FLT3, IDH1/2, RAS, and WT1. To investigate the order of appearance of TET2 and concomitant mutations, targeted deep resequencing was performed in six patients. At least one sequence variation with impact on TET2 protein sequence was found in 13 of the 215 CN-AML patients (6%). Patients with TET2 mutations tended to be older (P = 0.078) and had higher platelet counts (P = 0.041). TET2-mutated patients were more likely to have concomitant NPM1 (11 of 13; P = 0.047) and DNMT3A (10 of 13; P = 0.001) mutations but were mutually exclusive to partial tandem duplication of the MLL gene (MLL-PTD) and IDH1/2 mutations. TET2 mutations were identified as subclones in four of the six investigated patients by deep sequencing.

Here, we have characterized a new class of activating point mutations (PMs) that cluster in a 16-amino acid stretch of the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 (FLT3-JM-PMs). Expression of 4 FLT3-JM-PMs in interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent Ba/F3 cells led to factor-independent growth, hyperresponsiveness to FLT3 ligand, and resistance to apoptotic cell death. FLT3-JM-PM receptors were autophosphorylated and showed a higher constitutive dimerization rate compared with the FLT3-wild-type (WT) receptor. As a molecular mechanism, we could show activation of STAT5 and up-regulation of Bcl-x(L) by all FLT3-JM-PMs. The FLT3 inhibitor PKC412 abrogated the factor-independent growth of FLT3-JM-PM-expressing cells. Compared with FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD mutants, the FLT3-JM-PMs showed a weaker transforming potential related to lower autophosphorylation of the receptor and its downstream target STAT5. Mapping of the FLT3-JM-PMs on the crystal structure of FLT3 showed that these mutations reduce the stability of the autoinhibitory JM domain, and provides a structural basis for the transforming capacity of this new class of gain-of-function mutations of FLT3.",

FLT3-LM are highly correlated with AML with normal karyotype and other cytogenetic aberrations of the prognostically intermediate group. This group is supposed to be a mixed group of AML with differences in the underlying pathogenesis. For more individualized treatment options it would be helpful to better characterize this large AML group not only by molecular mutations but also use these markers for the definition of minimal residual disease (MRD). However, so far the cytogenetically intermediate AML has been lacking suitable markers for PCR-based MRD detection like the fusion genes in the prognostically favourable subgroups. The suitability of the FLT3-LM as a target for PCR-based MRD was discussed controversially as it seemed to be a rather unstable marker. Thus, we aimed at the evaluation of FLT3-LM as a marker for residual disease in a large cohort of AML. Paired samples of 97 patients with AML at diagnosis and at relapse were analyzed. It could be shown that in only four cases a loss of the length mutation was detected. This is in the range of other well-characterized AML relapsing with a different geno- and/or phenotype. In contrast, a change in the ratio of the mutated allele in comparison to the wild-type allele was frequently observed. In detail, the FLT3-LM showed a tendency to accumulate during disease progression and was found more frequently at relapse than at diagnosis. In addition, 45 patients were analyzed at different time points during and after therapy. Using conventional PCR it clearly could be shown that for most of the patients positive at presentation FLT3-LM is a reliable PCR marker for monitoring treatment response. Even an early detection of relapse was possible in some cases.",

Recent genomic data from AML cases using digital sequencing, temporal comparisons, xenograft cloning, and single-cell analysis indicate that most, if not all, AML cases emerge through branching evolution. According to a review of the current literature, the balanced translocations (t[15;17], t[8;21], and inv[16]) and nucleotide variants in DNMT3A and TET2 most commonly occur in the founding clone at diagnosis. These mutations are rarely gained or lost at relapse, and the latter 2 mutations are observed in elderly subjects with mosaic hematopoiesis antedating overt leukemia. In contrast, +8, +13, +22, -X, -Y, and nucleotide variants in FLT3, NRAS/KRAS, WT1, and KIT frequently occur in subclones and are observed either to emerge or to be lost at relapse.

Furthermore, AML cells undergo extensive clonal evolution, and the mutations in signaling genes are often secondary events. To elucidate how chronic growth factor signaling alters the transcriptional network in AML, we performed a system-wide multi-omics study of primary cells from patients suffering from AML with internal tandem duplications in the FLT3 transmembrane domain (FLT3-ITD). This strategy revealed cooperation between the MAP kinase (MAPK) inducible transcription factor AP-1 and RUNX1 as a major driver of a common, FLT3-ITD-specific gene expression and chromatin signature, demonstrating a major impact of MAPK signaling pathways in shaping the epigenome of FLT3-ITD AML.

The concentrations that inhibited 50% growth were approximately 0.3 and 1.2 microM, respectively, as measured by thymidine uptake on day 2 of culture. AZD6244 potently down-regulated the levels of phospho-ERK1/2 and its downstream effector, p-p70S6K, in the MV4-11 and MOLM13 cells as measured by Western blot analysis. Interestingly, when AZD6244 was combined with sunitinib, a FLT3 kinase inhibitor, growth inhibition and apoptosis of both MV4-11 and MOLM13 cells were synergistically enhanced in association with further down-regulation of phospho-ERK1/2 and p-p70S6K in these cells.

FLT3 mutation analysis was performed on 90 cases of JAK2-negative MPN or MDS/MPN and 62 cases of JAK2-positive MPN. One FLT3 internal tandem duplication mutation was identified in the JAK2-negative group (1.1%), and none were identified in the JAK2-positive group, confirming the absence of FLT3 mutations in JAK2-positive specimens. The FLT3-positive MPN patient was diagnosed with MPN, unclassifiable, and was later found to have myeloid sarcoma; thus, FLT3 mutation was not seen in the usual types of MPN in our series.

Our serial studies on 51 samples with the FLT3 gene mutation indicated that the ITD was frequently (47/51) clustered in the tyrosine-rich stretch from codon 589 to 599 and rarely (3/51) in its downstream region, both of which are located within the juxtamembrane (JM) domain. One remaining sample had an insertion into the JM domain of nucleotides of unknown origin. To elucidate the biological relevance of the ITD or the insertion, we expressed various types of mutant FLT3 in Cos 7 cells. All mutant FLT3 studied were ligand-independently dimerized and their tyrosine residues were phosphorylated. The Y589 of FLT3 was essential for the phosphorylation in the wild FLT3, but a Y589F conversion did not affect the phosphorylation status of the mutant FLT3. These findings suggest that the elongation of the JM domain rather than increase of tyrosine residues causes gain-of-function of FLT3. Thus, ITD is a novel modality of somatic mutation which activates its product. Since the DNA corresponding to codon 593 to 602 potentially forms a palindromic intermediate, we propose that a DNA-replication error might be associated with generating the ITD of the FLT3 gene.",

Imidazoacridinone C-1311, a DNA-reactive inhibitor of topoisomerase II, has been previously shown to be a potent and selective inhibitor of recombinant FLT3. Here, we expand those findings by studying its effect on leukemia cells with wild-type FLT3, FLT3-ITD mutant and no FLT3 receptor. While brief C-1311 exposure blocked wild-type and FLT3-ITD activity, profound and sustained inhibition was achieved only for FLT3-ITD mutants. C-1311 inhibited FLT3 downstream pathways (MAPK and AKT) independent of FLT3 status, yet translation to decreased viability was significant in FLT3-ITD cells. RNA interference against FLT3-ITD reduced cytotoxic effect and apoptosis induced by C-1311, indicating selective inhibition of FLT3-ITD crucial for high efficacy of drug against activated leukemia cells. Cellular responses in treated FLT3-ITD mutants included G1 and G2/M phase arrest, moderate inhibition of Bcl-2, caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage, and depolarization of mitochondria. Consistent with selective decrease in FLT3-ITD activity, C-1311 remarkably reduced antiapoptotic survivin mRNA and protein expression, correlating well with enhanced apoptosis of FLT3-ITD cells. No survivin decrease and respectively lower level of apoptosis was found in wild-type and null-FLT3 cells. Combination of C-1311 with cytarabine or doxorubicin again showed distinct synergistic activity in FLT3-ITD-positive cells. The ability of C-1311 to selectively target constitutively active FLT3, suggests a favorable therapeutic index for AML carrying FLT3-ITD mutations. Thus further preclinical and clinical studies addressing its potency against FLT3-ITD kinase is well justified. ",

Circulating blasts are cleared from the peripheral blood, while bone marrow blasts are either unaffected or are cleared from the marrow at a much slower rate. We used an in vitro model of FLT3-ITD AML blasts co-cultured with normal human bone marrow stromal cells to investigate the basis for this dichotomous response pattern to FLT3 inhibitors. We have found that in blasts on stroma, potent FLT3 inhibition predominantly results in cell cycle arrest rather than apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic effect is mediated through a combination of direct cell-cell contact and soluble factors. The addition of exogenous FLT3 ligand (FL) augments the protection, primarily by shifting the 50% inhibitory concentration for FLT3 inhibition upwards. Cytokine-activated extracellular regulated kinase (ERK), rather than STAT5, appears to be the most important downstream signalling protein mediating the protective effect, and inhibition of MEK significantly abrogates stromal-mediated resistance. These findings explain the phenomenon of peripheral blood versus bone marrow blast responses and suggest that the combination of potent FLT3 inhibition and MEK inhibition is a promising strategy for the treatment of FLT3-ITD AML.

Tracking mutant alleles to determine clonality from diagnosis to relapse or from primary site to metastases in a sensitive and quantitative manner is most often performed using next-generation sequencing. Such methods determine clonal frequencies by extrapolation of allele frequencies in sequencing data of DNA from the metagenome of bulk tumor samples using a set of assumptions. The computational framework that is usually used assumes specific patterns in the order of acquisition of unique mutational events and heterozygosity of mutations in single cells. However, these assumptions are not accurate for all mutant loci in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples. To assess whether current models of clonal diversity within individual AML samples are appropriate for common mutations, we developed protocols to directly genotype AML single cells. Single-cell analysis demonstrates that mutations of FLT3 and NPM1 occur in both homozygous and heterozygous states, distributed among at least nine distinct clonal populations in all samples analyzed. There appears to be convergent evolution and differential evolutionary trajectories for cells containing mutations at different loci. This work suggests an underlying tumor heterogeneity beyond what is currently understood in AML, which may be important in the development of therapeutic approaches to eliminate leukemic cell burden and control clonal evolution-induced relapse.

Remarkably, unsupervised expression profiling showed that 86% of high BRE-expressing patients were confined to a previously unrecognized cluster. High BRE expression was mutually exclusive with FLT3 ITD, CEBPA, IDH1, and IDH2 mutations, EVI1 overexpression, and favorable karyotypes. In contrast, high BRE expression co-occurred strongly with FAB M5 morphology and MLL-AF9 fusions. Within the group of MLL-AF9-positive patients, high BRE expression predicted superior survival, while normal BRE expression predicted extremely poor survival (5-year overall survival of 80% vs 0%, respectively, P = .0002). Both the co-occurrence of high BRE expression with MLL-AF9 and its prognostic impact were confirmed in an independent cohort of 436 AML patients.

Transforming FLT3ITD signal transduction causes formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inactivation of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) DEP-1/PTPRJ, a negative regulator of FLT3 signaling. Here we addressed the underlying mechanisms and biological consequences. NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) messenger RNA and protein expression was found to be elevated in FLT3ITD-positive cells and to depend on FLT3ITD signaling and STAT5-mediated activation of the NOX4 promoter. NOX4 knockdown reduced ROS levels, restored DEP-1 PTP activity and attenuated FLT3ITD-driven transformation. Moreover, Nox4 knockout (Nox4(-/-)) murine hematopoietic progenitor cells were refractory to FLT3ITD-mediated transformation in vitro. Development of a myeloproliferative-like disease (MPD) caused by FLT3ITD-transformed 32D cells in C3H/HeJ mice, and of a leukemia-like disease in mice transplanted with MLL-AF9/ FLT3ITD-transformed murine hematopoietic stem cells were strongly attenuated by NOX4 downregulation. NOX4-targeting compounds were found to counteract proliferation of FLT3ITD-positive AML blasts and MPD development in mice. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism of oncoprotein-driven PTP oxidation, and suggest that interference with FLT3ITD-STAT5-NOX4-mediated overproduction of ROS and PTP inactivation may have therapeutic potential in a subset of AML.

Expression of the neural cell-adhesion molecule (CD56) is also associated with a significantly shorter complete remission duration and survival in patients with t(8;21)-AML. Patients with t(8;21)-AML expressing CD56 have been reported to exhibit a higher incidence of granulocytic sarcoma (GS), and t(8;21)-AML with GS results in a less favorable prognosis than AML with this translocation alone.

        "Doc_abstract":"Among activating class III receptor tyrosine kinase (Flt3) mutations, internal tandem duplications of Flt3 (Flt3-ITD) are detected in about 25% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In contrast, mutations within the tyrosine kinase domain of Flt3 (Flt3-TKD mutations) are less frequent (approximately 7%), and there are only limited data on the frequency of recently demonstrated activating Flt3 point mutation at codon 592 (Flt3-V592A mutation). We evaluated a new approach for rapid screening of Flt3-TKD and Flt3-V592A mutations using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) principle in a group of 122 patients. Based on individual Flt3-TKD mutations, we designed patient-specific primers to perform a highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for rapid detection of minimal residual disease (MRD). We also used a model system with MonoMac-6 cells carrying the Flt3-V592A mutation to establish a mutation-specific real-time PCR approach also for this molecular aberration. We identified 9 cases (8%) of Flt3-TKD mutations (5 cases of mutation D835Y, 3 cases of mutation D835H, and 1 case of mutation Del836), and no cases of Flt3-V592A mutation. Screening for Flt3-TKD mutations with fluorescent probes is equivalent to conventional screening using standard PCR followed by EcoRV restriction. We present a real-time PCR protocol that can be used for MRD analyses based on individual Flt3-TKD mutations. Examples of MRD analyses are presented for all 3 subtypes of Flt3-TKD mutation identified in this study. In summary, we demonstrate new methodological approaches for rapid screening of Flt3 point mutations and for detection of MRD based on patient-specific Flt3-TKD mutations.",

We have previously reported a relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ABCB1, encoding the multi-drug transporter P-glycoprotein, and overall survival (OS) in normal karyotype (NK)-AML. Here we extended this material, enabling subgroup analysis based on FLT3 and NPM1 status, to further elucidate the influence of ABCB1 SNPs. De novo NK-AML patients (n = 201) were analysed for 1199G>A, 1236C>T, 2677G>T/A and 3435C>T, and correlations to outcome were investigated. FLT3 wild-type 1236C/C patients have significantly shorter OS compared to patients carrying the variant allele; medians 20 vs. 49 months, respectively, P = 0·017. There was also an inferior outcome in FLT3 wild-type 2677G/G patients compared to patients carrying the variant allele, median OS 20 vs. 35 months, respectively, P = 0·039. This was confirmed in Cox regression analysis. Our results indicate that ABCB1 1236C>T and 2677G>T may be used as prognostic markers to distinguish relatively high risk patients in the intermediate risk FLT3 wild-type group, which may contribute to future individualizing of treatment strategies.

Recurrent genomic rearrangements are detected in half of pediatric AML by karyotype. NUcleoPorin 98 (NUP98) gene is rearranged with 31 different fusion partner genes. These rearrangements are frequently undetected by conventional cytogenetics, as the NUP98 gene is located at the end of the chromosome 11 short arm (11p15). By screening a series of 574 pediatric AML, we detected a NUP98 rearrangement in 22 cases (3.8%), a frequency similar to CBFB-MYH11 fusion gene (4.0%). The most frequent NUP98 fusion gene partner is NSD1. These cases are homogeneous regarding their biological and clinical characteristics, and associated with bad prognosis only improved by bone marrow transplantation. We detailed the biological characteristics of these AML by exome sequencing which demonstrated few recurrent mutations (FLT3 ITD, WT1, CEBPA, NBPF14, BCR and ODF1). The analysis of the clonal structure in these cases suggests that the mutation order in the NUP98-rearranged pediatric AML begins with the NUP98 rearrangement leading to epigenetic dysregulations then followed by mutations of critical hematopoietic transcription factors and finally, activation of the FLT3 signaling pathway.Leukemia advance online publication, 8 November 2016; doi:10.1038/leu.2016.267.",

Current treatment strategies for acute myeloid leukemia are based on both patient-related parameters such as age and performance status as well as the intrinsic characteristics of particular disease subtypes. Subtyping of acute myeloid leukemia requires an integration of information from the patient's clinical history (such as any prior preleukemic myeloid neoplasm or cytotoxic potentially leukemogenic therapy), the leukemia morphology, cytogenetic findings, and the mutation status of particular genes (NPM1, FLT3, and CEBPA). In recent years, a barrage of information has become available regarding gene mutations that occur in acute myeloid leukemia and their influence on prognosis. Future therapies for acute myeloid leukemia will increasingly rely on the genetic signatures of individual leukemias and will adjust therapy to the predicted disease aggressiveness as well as employ therapies targeted against particular deregulated genetic pathways. This article reviews current standards for diagnosing and classifying acute myeloid leukemia according to the 2008 WHO Classification. Data that have subsequently accumulated regarding newly characterized gene mutations are also presented. It is anticipated that future leukemia classifications will employ a combination of karyotypic features and the gene mutation pattern to stratify patients to increasingly tailored treatment plans.",

HSPs are regarded as possible therapeutic targets in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). We used bioinformatical approaches to characterize the HSP profile in AML cells from 75 consecutive patients, in addition to the effect of the HSP90 inhibitor 17-DMAG. Patients harbouring a FLT3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) were extensively overrepresented in the cluster with high HSP levels, indicating a strong dependence of HSPs in stabilizing FLT3-ITD encoded oncoproteins. FLT3 ligation further increased the levels of HSP90 and its co-chaperone HSP70. HSP90 inhibition had a stronger pro-apoptotic effect for AML cells with FLT3-ITD than for cells with wild-type FLT3, whereas the anti-proliferative effect of HSP90 inhibition was similar for the two patient subsets. HSP90 inhibition altered the constitutive cytokine release profile in an anti-angiogenic direction independent of FLT3 mutational status: (i) pro-angiogenic CXCL8, MMP-2 and MMP-9 showed a stronger decrease than anti-angiogenic CXCL9-11, (ii) the Tie-2 agonist Ang-1 showed a stronger decrease than the potentially antagonistic Ang-2, and (iii) VEGF and HGF levels were decreased.

CD200 was found in 136/244 (56%) patients, in 41 of whom (30%) with high intensity of expression (MFI ≥ 11). CD200 was more frequent in secondary compared to de novo leukemia (p = 0.0006), in CD34 positive cases (p = 0.00001), in Bcl2 overexpressing cases (p = 0.01), in those wild-type Flt3 (p = 0.004) and with favorable or unfavorable compared to intermediate karyotype (p = 0.0003). CD200+ patients have a two-fold lower probability to attain complete remission, both in univariate (p = 0.006) and multivariate (p = 0.04) analysis. The negative impact of CD200 was found also in overall survival (p = 0.02) and was correlated with the intensity of expression of the molecule (p = 0.024). CD200 has an additive negative impact on survival in patients with unfavorable cytogenetic (p = 0.046) and in secondary leukemia (p = 0.05), and is associate with a worsening of outcome in patients with favorable biological markers, such as mutated NPM (p = 0.02), wild-type Flt3 (p = 0.034), negativity of CD34 (p = 0.03) and of CD56 (p = 0.03).

In particular, FLT3 internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD) are characterized by an unfavorable prognosis and allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allogeneic SCT) in first complete remission is recommended. In case of imminent or frank relapse following allogeneic SCT, treatment with FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) constitutes a promising clinical approach to induce hematologic remission without conventional chemotherapy.;We retrospectively analyzed the response to induction chemotherapy and the outcome of 76 patients with FLT3-ITD-positive AML including 50 patients who underwent allogeneic SCT. Furthermore, efficacy of TKI treatment was evaluated in 18 patients (median age 54 years, range 21-74) with relapsed or refractory FLT3-ITD-positive AML.;Response to induction chemotherapy in 76 FLT3-ITD-positive AML patients was characterized by a complete remission (CR) rate of 68%. In total, 50 of 76 patients (66%) underwent allogeneic SCT including 40 patients (80%) in CR. Relapse of AML was observed in 21 of 47 patients (45%) after allogeneic SCT with a median relapse-free survival (RFS) of 13 months (range 3-224) for patients with CR prior to or at day +30 after SCT. Myeloablative conditioning resulted in an improved median RFS of 29 months (4-217) as compared to a reduced intensity conditioning protocol prior to allogeneic SCT with a RFS of 8 months (1-197, P = 0.048), respectively. Median OS of FLT3-ITD-positive AML was 17 months (5-225) for patients who received an allogeneic SCT as compared to 9 months (1-184) for patients who did not undergo SCT. Response of FLT3-ITD-positive AML to sorafenib was characterized by only 3 of 18 patients achieving a bone marrow response (17%), while there was no response to second-line treatment with ponatinib.;This \"real-life\" data reflect the continuing challenge of FLT3-ITD-positive AML and confirm the poor outcome even after allogeneic SCT.

In the absence of ligand, immunoblotting showed weak phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT3, ERKs 1 and 2 and the receptor itself, and there was approximately 70% of maximal growth in a proliferation assay. All signals were significantly enhanced in the presence of G-CSF. Retroviral transduction of mutant receptor into primary hematopoietic CD34+ cells induced G-CSF independent myeloid differentiation as assessed by the development of neutrophils and surface expression of CD11b and CD14.

High efficacy of the HDACi pracinostat treating AML and synergy with the JAK2/FLT3 inhibitor pacritinib is demonstrated. Both compounds inhibit JAK-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling in AML cells with JAK2(V617F) mutations, but also diminish FLT3 signaling, particularly in FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplication) cell lines. In vitro, this combination led to decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. The synergy translated in vivo in two different AML models, the SET-2 megakaryoblastic AML mouse model carrying a JAK2(V617F) mutation, and the MOLM-13 model of FLT3-ITD-driven AML. Pracinostat and pacritinib in combination showed synergy on tumor growth, reduction of metastases and synergistically decreased JAK2 or FLT signaling, depending on the cellular context. In addition, several plasma cytokines/growth factors/chemokines triggered by the tumor growth were normalized, providing a rationale for combination therapy with an HDACi and a JAK2/FLT3 inhibitor for the treatment of AML patients, particularly those with FLT3 or JAK2 mutations.",

MYST3-CREBBP cases clustered together and clearly differentiated from samples with PML-RARalpha, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, and CBFbeta-MYH11 rearrangements. The relative expression of 46 genes, selected according to their differential expression in the high-density array study, was analyzed by low-density arrays in an additional series of 40 patients, which included 7 MYST3-CREBBP AML cases. Thus, genes such as prolactin (PRL) and proto-oncogene RET were confirmed to be specifically overexpressed in MYST3-CREBBP samples whereas genes such as CCND2, STAT5A, and STAT5B were differentially underexpressed in this AML category. Interestingly, MYST3-CREBBP AML exhibited a characteristic pattern of HOX expression, with up-regulation of HOXA9, HOXA10, and cofactor MEIS1 and marked down-regulation of other homeobox genes. This profile, with overexpression of FLT3, HOXA9, MEIS1, AKR7A2, CHD3, and APBA2, partially resembles that of AML with MLL rearrangement. In summary, this study shows the distinctive gene expression profile of MYST3-CREBBP AML, with overexpression of RET and PRL and a specific pattern of HOX gene expression.",

FLT3-ITD-expressing murine and human myeloid cell lines, HF6/FLT3-ITD and K562/FLT3-ITD cells, respectively, were developed in order to clarify whether FLT3-ITD is involved in the resistance to cytotoxic agents in AML. Both of these cell lines were specifically resistant to the pyrimidine analogue cytosine arabinoside (ara-C), an essential agent for AML, accompanied by the downregulation of equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1), a transporter responsible for the cellular uptake of ara-C. The ENT1 promoter activity and the cellular uptake of ara-C were reduced in K562/FLT3-ITD cells, and rescued by pretreating the cells with PKC412, a FLT3 inhibitor. In addition, the expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha subunit (HIF1A) transcripts was upregulated in K562/FLT3-ITD cells, and the induction of HIF-1alpha reduced the promoter activity of ENT1 gene in K562 cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that FLT3-ITD specifically induces ara-C resistance in leukemic cells by the repression of ENT1 expression, possibly through the upregulation of HIF-1alpha, while also partially accounting for the poor prognosis of AML with FLT3-ITD due to resistance to the standard chemotherapy protocols which include ara-C.",

Crenolanib is also an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha and beta and is in clinical trials in both gastrointestinal stromal tumors and gliomas. Methods We tested crenolanib interactions with the multidrug resistance-associated ATP-binding cassette proteins ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), ABCG2 (breast cancer resistance protein) and ABCC1 (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1), which are expressed on AML cells and other cancer cells and are important components of the blood-brain barrier. Results We found that crenolanib is a substrate of ABCB1, as evidenced by approximate five-fold resistance of ABCB1-overexpressing cells to crenolanib, reversal of this resistance by the ABCB1-specific inhibitor PSC-833 and stimulation of ABCB1 ATPase activity by crenolanib. In contrast, crenolanib was not a substrate of ABCG2 or ABCC1. Additionally, it did not inhibit substrate transport by ABCB1, ABCG2 or ABCC1, at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. Finally, incubation of the FLT3-ITD AML cell lines MV4-11 and MOLM-14 with crenolanib at a pharmacologically relevant concentration of 500 nM did not induce upregulation of ABCB1 cell surface expression. Conclusions Thus ABCB1 expression confers resistance to crenolanib and likely limits crenolanib penetration of the central nervous system, but crenolanib at therapeutic concentrations should not alter cellular exposure to ABC protein substrate chemotherapy drugs.

Examining the anti- and proapoptotic proteins in constitutively activated FLT3 signalling in BaF3/ITD and MV4-11 cells, we found that the level of Bcl-2 antagonist of cell death (BAD) phosphorylation was greatly decreased in response to FLT3 inhibition. Both Ser-112 and Ser-136 of BAD are rapidly dephosphorylated after treatment with the FLT3 inhibitor CEP-701 in BaF3/ITD and MV4-11 cells. In confirmation of the cell line data, BAD was highly phosphorylated in both constitutively activated wild-type and mutant FLT3 primary AML samples, and rapidly dephosphorylated after treatment of the primary samples with CEP-701. Upstream proteins known to phosphorylate BAD include Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (Erk/ MAPK), Pim-1 and Pim-2. We and other groups have shown that constitutively activated FLT3 induces multiple signalling pathways, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, Erk/MAPK and Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (Jak/STAT). Thus, BAD may be a nexus point upon which these multiple signalling pathways converge in FLT3-mediated cell survival. In support of this, siRNA knockdown of BAD expression in MV4-11 cells conferred resistance to CEP-701-mediated apoptosis. Our data suggests that Pim-1 is one of the principal kinases mediating the anti-apoptotic function of FLT3/ITD signalling via the phosphorylation of BAD.",

Recently, several studies have suggested that the T-cell and DC potential of CLP is limited or absent, and/or that CLP contains significant myeloid potential. Here, we show that the originally identified CLP population can be divided into functionally distinct subsets based on the expression of the tyrosine kinase receptor, Flk2. The Flk2(+) subset contains robust in vivo and in vitro T-cell, B-cell, DC, and NK potential, but lacks myeloid potential and, therefore, represents an oligopotent, lymphoid-restricted progenitor. This population of cells does not appear to be B cell-biased and robustly reconstitutes both B and T lineages in vivo, consistent with its being a physiologic progenitor of both of these subsets. Thus, Flk2 expression defines a homogeneous, readily obtainable subset of bone marrow CLP that is completely lymphoid-committed and can differentiate equivalently well into both B and T lineages.",

Among these are targeted therapeutics such as kinase inhibitors and oligonucleotide constructs. These aim to suppress the production or activity of proteins, such as FLT3 and BCL2, among others, and thus disrupt related signaling cascades essential for leukemogenesis and proliferation. In addition, other agents like flavopiridol appear to target the myeloid blast by various mechanisms including suppression of cyclin-dependent kinases and interference with nucleotide synthesis. Another class of novel therapies includes inhibitors of histone deacetylase, which cause growth arrest and apoptosis through histone acetylation and resultant conformational changes.

Recent studies showed that PI3K/Akt signaling is frequently activated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient blasts and strongly contributes to proliferation, survival and drug resistance of these cells. Upregulation of the PI3K/Akt network in AML may be due to several reasons, including FLT3, Ras or c-Kit mutations. Small molecules designed to selectively target key components of this signal transduction cascade induce apoptosis and/or markedly increase conventional drug sensitivity of AML blasts in vitro. Thus, inhibitory molecules are currently being developed for clinical use either as single agents or in combination with conventional therapies. However, the PI3K/Akt pathway is important for many physiological cellular functions and, in particular, for insulin signaling, so that its blockade in vivo might cause severe systemic side effects.

Fusion genes involving ABL, ARG, PDGFRs, JAK2, SYK, TRKC, and FGFRs, and gain-of-function mutations of FLT3, KIT and JAK2 have been detected at various rates in myeloproliferative disease and acute myeloid leukemia. Furthermore, abnormal overexpression of tyrosine kinases such as FLT3 has also been reported. These gene products are constitutively activated and potentially transform hematopoietic cells by augmentation of proliferation and enhanced viability. Since the fusion or mutation of tyrosine kinase is a primary and central event in chronic myeloproliferative diseases, targeting the kinase activity has been thought to be an ideal intervention to treat these diseases. The clinical success of imatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia has made this idea a reality, and has accelerated the development of new tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Challenging studies with TKIs have also been reported for acute myeloid leukemia. This review will focus on recent trials of TKIs against oncogenic tyrosine kinases (ABL, PDGFRs, FLT3 and KIT) in myeloid malignancies.",

We analyzed diagnostic bone marrow specimens from 91 pediatric patients with AML treated on Children's Cancer Group (CCG)-2891 for the presence of the Flt3/ITD and correlated its presence with clinical outcome. Fifteen of 91 samples (16.5%) were positive for the Flt3/ITD. Flt3/ITD-positive patients had a median diagnostic white count of 73 800 compared with 28 400 for the Flt3/ITD-negative patients (P =.05). The size of the duplication ranged from 21 to 174 base pairs (bp). Nucleotide sequencing of the abnormal polymerase chain reaction products demonstrated that all duplications involved exon 11 of the Flt3 gene and also preserved the reading frame. Lineage restriction analysis revealed that Flt3/ITD was not present in the lymphocytes, suggesting a lack of stem cell involvement for this mutation. None of the Flt3/ITD-positive patients had unfavorable cytogenetic markers, and there was no predominance of a particular FAB class. The remission induction rate was 40% in Flt3/ITD-positive patients compared with 74% in Flt3/ITD-negative ones (P =.005). The Kaplan-Meier estimates of event-free survival at 8 years for patients with and without Flt3/ITD were 7% and 44%, respectively (P =.002).

Two distinct groups of FLT3 mutations are found: internal tandem duplications (ITDs) of the juxtamembrane region and point mutations within the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD). Recently, point mutations within the activation loop of FLT3 have also been described in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). FLT3-ITD has been shown to induce a myeloproliferative syndrome in a murine bone marrow transplantation model. The phenotype of FLT3-TKD in mice has not yet been investigated. We transduced murine bone marrow with retrovirus-expressing FLT3-TKD mutants or FLT3-ITD and transplanted these cells into lethally irradiated mice. Mice that received a transplant of FLT3-ITD developed an oligoclonal myeloproliferative disease as previously described. In contrast, FLT3-TKD mutants induced an oligoclonal lymphoid disorder with longer latency and distinct hematologic manifestations: importantly, induction of the lymphoid phenotype was not due to a low number of transplanted cells. The lymphoid manifestation and longer latency of FLT3-TKD compared with FLT3-ITD mutants together with the lack of influence of FLT3-TKD mutations on the clinical outcome of patients with AML suggest differences in cell signaling between FLT3-TKD mutants and FLT3-ITDs. Indeed strong signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 (STAT5) activation could only be demonstrated for FLT3-ITDs.",

In multivariate analysis, controlled for prognostic baseline characteristics and daunorubicin dose, CD25(POS) patients had inferior complete remission rates (P = .0005) and overall survival (P < .0001) compared with CD25(NEG) cases. In a subset of 396 patients, we integrated CD25 expression with somatic mutation status to determine whether CD25 impacted outcome independent of prognostic mutations. CD25 was positively correlated with internal tandem duplications in FLT3 (FLT3-ITD), DNMT3A, and NPM1 mutations. The adverse prognostic impact of FLT3-ITD(POS) AML was restricted to CD25(POS) patients. CD25 expression improved AML prognostication independent of integrated, cytogenetic and mutational data, such that it reallocated 11% of patients with intermediate-risk disease to the unfavorable-risk group. Gene expression analysis revealed that CD25(POS) status correlated with the expression of previously reported leukemia stem cell signatures.

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) two classes of activating FLT3 mutations are known: internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD) in the juxtamembrane domain and point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3-TKD). Recently, a third class of activating mutations was discovered, single point mutations in the juxtamembrane domain (FLT3-JM-PM). Since the crystal structure of the inactive conformation of FLT3 has recently been resolved the role of the juxtamembrane (JM) domain, serving as a key autoinhibitory element regulating kinase activity, was elucidated. Mutations in the JM domain seem to perturb the autoinhibitory activity of the JM domain thereby inducing autonomous activation of the kinase. These findings have important clinical implications. Routine screenings for mutations in FLT3 in leukemia diagnostics should also analyze point mutations in the JM domain of FLT3 and patients harbouring FLT3-JM-PM might benefit from experimental therapeutic approaches with FLT3 inhibitors. The identification of FLT3-JM-PM is a remarkable example how single point mutations in the structurally important JM domain can turn RTKs into oncogenes.",

It is still controversial whether the MLL fusion protein is sufficient to induce acute leukemia without additional genetic alterations, although carcinogenesis in general is known to result from more than 1 genetic disorder accumulating during a lifetime. Here we demonstrate that the fusion partner-mediated homo-oligomerization of MLL-SEPT6 is essential to immortalize hematopoietic progenitors in vitro. MLL-SEPT6 induced myeloproliferative disease with long latency in mice, but not acute leukemia, implying that secondary genotoxic events are required to develop leukemia. We developed in vitro and in vivo model systems of leukemogenesis by MLL fusion proteins, where activated FMS-like receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) together with MLL-SEPT6 not only transformed hematopoietic progenitors in vitro but also induced acute biphenotypic or myeloid leukemia with short latency in vivo. In these systems, MLL-ENL, another type of the fusion product that seems to act as a monomer, also induced the transformation in vitro and leukemogenesis in vivo in concert with activated FLT3. These findings show direct evidence for a multistep leukemogenesis mediated by MLL fusion proteins and may be applicable to development of direct MLL fusion-targeted therapy.",

Cytarabine uptake into cells was mediated mainly by hENT1, hENT2 and hCNT1. hENT1-mediated uptake of cytarabine was transiently abolished by the FLT3 inhibitor PKC412, and this effect was associated with decreased hENT1 mRNA and protein levels. Noticeably, the cytotoxicity of cytarabine was lower when cells were first exposed to FLT3 inhibitors (PKC412 or AC220), probably due to decreased hENT1 activity, but we observed a higher cytotoxic effect if FLT3 inhibitors were administered after cytarabine.FLT3 regulates hENT1 activity and thereby affects cytarabine cytotoxicity. The sequence of administration of cytarabine and FLT3 inhibitors is important to maintain their efficacy.",

The serine threonine kinase Pim-1 is a pro-survival oncogene transcriptionally upregulated by FLT3-ITD that also promotes its signaling in a positive feedback loop. Thus inhibiting Pim-1 represents an attractive approach in targeting FLT3-ITD cells. Indeed, co-treatment with the pan-Pim kinase inhibitor AZD1208 or expression of a kinase-dead Pim-1 mutant sensitized FLT3-ITD cell lines to apoptosis triggered by chemotherapy drugs including the topoisomerase 2 inhibitors daunorubicin, etoposide and mitoxantrone, but not the nucleoside analog cytarabine. AZD1208 sensitized primary AML cells with FLT3-ITD to topoisomerase 2 inhibitors, but did not sensitize AML cells with wild-type FLT3 or remission bone marrow cells, supporting a favorable therapeutic index. Mechanistically, the enhanced apoptosis observed with AZD1208 and topoisomerase 2 inhibitor combination treatment was associated with increased DNA double-strand breaks and increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and co-treatment with the ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine rescued FLT3-ITD cells from AZD1208 sensitization to topoisomerase 2 inhibitors.

We analyzed the clinical course of 34 AML+13 patients enrolled in the German AMLCG-1999 and SAL trials and performed exome sequencing, targeted candidate gene sequencing and gene expression profiling. Relapse-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS) of AML+13 patients were inferior compared to other ELN Intermediate-II patients (n=855) (median RFS, 7.8 vs 14.1 months, P = .006; median OS 9.3 vs. 14.8 months, P = .004). Besides the known high frequency of RUNX1 mutations (75%), we identified mutations in spliceosome components in 88%, including SRSF2 codon 95 mutations in 81%. Recurring mutations were detected in ASXL1 (44%) and BCOR (25%). Two patients carried mutations in CEBPZ, suggesting that CEBPZ is a novel recurrently mutated gene in AML. Gene expression analysis revealed a homogeneous expression profile including upregulation of FOXO1 and FLT3 and downregulation of SPRY2.

PATIENTS AND METHODS MN1 expression was measured in 119 untreated primary CN-AML adults younger than 60 years by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Patients were also tested for FLT3, NPM1, CEBPA, and WT1 mutations, MLL partial tandem duplications, and BAALC and ERG expression. Gene- and microRNA-expression profiles were attained by performing genome-wide microarray assays. Patients were intensively treated on two first-line Cancer and Leukemia Group B clinical trials. Results Higher MN1 expression associated with NPM1 wild-type (P < .001), increased BAALC expression (P = .004), and less extramedullary involvement (P = .01). In multivariable analyses, higher MN1 expression associated with a lower complete remission rate (P = .005) after adjustment for WBC; shorter disease-free survival (P = .01) after adjustment for WT1 mutations, FLT3 internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD), and high ERG expression; and shorter survival (P = .04) after adjustment for WT1 and NPM1 mutations, FLT3-ITD, and WBC. Gene- and microRNA-expression profiles suggested that high MN1 expressers share features with high BAALC expressers and patients with wild-type NPM1. Higher MN1 expression also appears to be associated with genes and microRNAs that are active in aberrant macrophage/monocytoid function and differentiation. CONCLUSION MN1 expression independently predicts outcome in CN-AML patients. The MN1 gene- and microRNA-expression signatures suggest biologic features that could be exploited as therapeutic targets.",

We have identified Gadd45alpha as a downregulated gene in response to constitutive signaling from two FLT3 mutants (FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD) commonly found in AML, and a leukemogenic GM-CSF receptor trans-membrane mutant (GMR-V449E). GADD45A mRNA downregulation is also associated with FLT3-ITD(+) AML. Sustained ERK1/2 signaling contributes significantly to receptor-mediated downregulation of Gadd45alpha mRNA in FDB1 cells expressing activated receptor mutants, and in the FLT3-ITD(+) cell line MV4;11. Knockdown of Gadd45alpha with shRNA led to increased growth and survival of FDB1 cells and enforced expression of Gadd45alpha in FDB1 cells expressing FLT3-ITD or GMR-V449E resulted in reduced growth and viability. Gadd45alpha overexpression in FLT3-ITD(+) AML cell lines also resulted in reduced growth associated with increased apoptosis and G(1)/S cell cycle arrest. Overexpression of Gadd45alpha in FDB1 cells expressing GMR-V449E was sufficient to induce changes associated with myeloid differentiation suggesting Gadd45alpha downregulation contributes to the maintenance of receptor-induced myeloid differentiation block.

W51 expression resulted in a strong proliferative advantage and enhanced erythropoiesis as determined by immunophenotyping, colony assays, and molecular analyses. In MS-5 stromal cocultures, numerous early cobblestone areas (CAs) were generated within 10 to 14 days. Such W51-associated early CAs disappeared by 4 weeks, yet retained self-renewal properties as demonstrated by generation of secondary and tertiary CAs upon replating. This phenotype appears related to the expression of W51 since it was abolished by exposure to the FLT3 inhibitor, AG1295, but not to the c-kit inhibitor PD16. Wild-type Flt3-overexpressing CD34+ cells exposed to high levels of its physiologic ligand did not produce early CAs, highlighting differences in intracellular signaling between wild-type Flt3 and W51. W51-associated signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (Stat5) activation plays a major role in this phenotype, although additional downstream targets of W51 may be relevant.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can improve cure rates, however relapse is still common. Recent studies demonstrate the activity of FLT3 inhibitors, including sorafenib, in targeting the underlying mutation.;We conducted a retrospective study of 15 pediatric patients with FLT3/ITD+ AML treated with sorafenib within 18 months after receiving HSCT. Sorafenib was administered either as prophylaxis in patients considered at very high risk for relapse (n = 6) or at the time of disease recurrence (n = 9).;Sorafenib was initiated at a median of 100 days post HSCT. Overall, 11/15 (73%) of patients experienced medically significant toxicities. Among patients who experienced toxicity, 6/11 (55%) received treatment at doses above what was later determined to be the maximum tolerated dose of sorafenib for pediatric leukemia. Importantly, sorafenib did not appear to exacerbate graft versus host disease. Our findings suggest that sorafenib may be of particular efficacy in patients with minimal residual disease (MRD); all patients who received sorafenib for MRD immediately prior to transplant or with emergence post-HSCT are alive and remain in complete remission at a median of 48 months post HSCT.;Our case series suggests that sorafenib administration is feasible and tolerable in pediatric FLT3/ITD+ AML patients early post HSCT. Ongoing prospective controlled studies are needed to further define the dosing of sorafenib in the post-HSCT period and to determine the optimal context for this treatment approach.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The nuclear receptor co-repressor (N-CoR) is a key component of the generic co-repressor complex that plays an important role in the control of cellular growth and differentiation. As shown by us recently, the growth suppressive function of N-CoR largely relies on its capacity to repress Flt3, a key regulator of cellular gorwth during normal and malignant hematopoesis. We further demonstrated how de-repression of Flt3 due to the misfolded conformation dependent loss (MCDL) of N-CoR contributed to malignant growth in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the molecular mechanism underlying the MCDL of N-CoR and its implication in AML pathogenesis is not fully understood. Here, we report that Akt-induced phosphorylation of N-CoR at the consensus Akt motif is crucial for its misfolding and subsequent loss in AML (AML-M5). N-CoR displayed significantly higher level of serine specific phosphorylation in almost all AML-M5 derived cells and was subjected to processing by AML-M5 specific aberrant protease activity. To identify the kinase linked to N-CoR phosphorylation, a library of activated kinases was screened with the extracts of AML cells; leading to the identification of Akt as the putative kinase linked to N-CoR phosphorylation. Consistent with this finding, a constitutively active Akt consistently phosphorylated N-CoR leading to its misfolding; while the therapeutic and genetic ablation of Akt largely abrogated the MCDL of N-CoR in AML-M5 cells. Site directed mutagenic analysis of N-CoR identified serine 1450 as the crucial residue whose phosphorylation by Akt was essential for the misfolding and loss of N-CoR protein. Moreover, Akt-induced phosphorylation of N-CoR contributed to the de-repression of Flt3, suggesting a cross talk between Akt signaling and N-CoR misfolding pathway in the pathogenesis of AML-M5. The N-CoR misfolding pathway could be the common downstream thread of pleiotropic Akt signaling activated by various oncogenic insults in some subtypes of leukemia and solid tumors. ",

ASXL1 mutations (n=26, 21%) were associated with a higher proportion of marrow dysgranulopoiesis (mutant vs. wild-type: 75% vs. 55%, p=0.030) and were mostly found in intermediate cytogenetic AML (23/26) in which they predicted inferior 2-year overall survival (OS, mutant vs. wild-type: 14% vs. 37%, p=0.030). TP53 mutations (n=28, 22%) were mostly found in complex karyotype AML (26/28) and predicted poor outcome within unfavorable cytogenetic risk AML (mutant vs. wild-type: 9% vs. 40%, p=0.040). In multivariate analysis, the presence of either ASXL1 or TP53 mutation was the only independent factor associated with shorter OS (HR, 95%CI: 2.53, 1.40-4.60, p=0.002) while MLD, MDS-related cytogenetics and previous MDS history did not influence OS.

Towards this, we selected a naïve antibody phage display library on both recombinant FLT3 receptor protein and FLT3-expressing leukemia cells using a tailored selection scheme that was designed to isolate antagonistic phage antibodies that not only interfere with receptor/ligand binding but also trigger receptor internalization upon cell surface binding. Phage antibodies were screened first for their ability to bind to cell surface receptor and induce receptor internalization, followed by their activity in blocking ligand-receptor interaction and neutralizing ligand-stimulated receptor activation and cell proliferation. We identified three fully human antibodies, EB10, A2IN, and D4-3, which bound specifically to both soluble and cell surface-expressed FLT3. All three antibodies were shown to be internalized upon binding to cell surface-expressed receptor in a time-dependent fashion. EB10 and D4-3 blocked ligand binding to the receptor with IC(50)s of 14 and 7 nM, respectively. Further, EB10 and D4-3 inhibited FLT3 ligand-induced receptor phosphorylation and cell proliferation in EOL-1 leukemia cells.

RT-PCR was used to determine the expressions of FIT3-ITD and mdr1 gene in bone marrow samples from 81 new diagnosed pediatric patients with AML, the cytogenetics and immunophenotypes of bone marrow cells were routinely examined. The results indicated that the FLT3-ITDs were detected in 8 out of 81 pediatric patients (9.88%) and all mutations detected were hybrid, while less frequently this mutation was detected in adult patients. Although they were irrelevant with sex and immunophenotypes, the mutations seemed predominant in older pediatric patients. The leukocyte counts and bone marrow blast cell counts in pediatric patients with FLT3-ITD at diagnosis were higher than those in pediatric patients without FLT3-ITD (p = 0.001 and p = 0.041 respectively), but the normal chromosomes were found in most pediatric patients with FLT-ITD. The patients with FLT3-ITD had lower induction remission rate (only 25%), but the patients without FLT3-ITD had higher remission rate (76.1%). According results detected by RT-PCR, the mdr1 gene was found in 27 pediatric patients, but only 3 out of 8 pediatric patients with FLT3-ITD were detected to express both FLT3-ITD and mdr1, which suggests unrelation between FLT3-ITD occurrence and mdr1 expression. It is concluded that the FLT3-ITD is frequent mutation in pediatric patients with AML, the prognosis is worse and the induction remission rate is lower in these patients, but the FLT3-ITD not relates with the mdr1, which suggests that the common MDR modulators may be un effective for therapy of the patients with FLT3-ITD.",

The present study addressed the role of Tyk2 in FLT3-ITD signaling in a murine bone marrow transplantation (BMT) model. Transplantation of wild-type bone marrow cells transduced with the FLT3-ITD gene induced lethal myeloproliferative disease (MPD) in the recipient mice at a median latency of 89 days. Interestingly, some mice presented the proliferation of B- or T-lymphoid blasts in various organs, a presentation that resembled acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Mice that received Tyk2-deficient bone marrow cells transduced with FLT3-ITD developed lethal MPD with a disease latency (median, 100 days) and pathologic picture similar to those of mice that received wild-type bone marrow cells.

PATIENTS AND METHODS In the phase I part of the study, 10 patients with relapsed AML were treated with escalating doses of sorafenib with chemotherapy to establish the feasibility of the combination. We then treated 51 patients (median age, 53 years; range, 18 to 65 years) who had previously untreated AML with cytarabine at 1.5 g/m(2) by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion daily for 4 days (3 days if > 60 years of age), idarubicin at 12 mg/m(2) IV daily for 3 days, and sorafenib at 400 mg orally twice daily for 7 days. RESULTS Overall, 38 (75%) patients have achieved a complete remission (CR), including 14 (93%) of 15 patients with mutated FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3; the 15th patient had complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery [CRp]) and 24 (66%) of 36 patients with FLT3 wild-type (WT) disease (three additional FLT3-WT patients had CRp). FLT3-mutated patients were more likely to achieve a CR than FLT3-WT patients (P = .033). With a median follow-up of 54 weeks (range, 8 to 87 weeks), the probability of survival at 1 year is 74%. Among the FLT3-mutated patients, 10 have relapsed and five remain in CR with a median follow-up of 62 weeks (range, 10 to 76 weeks).

        "Doc_abstract":"Mutations in codon D816 of the KIT gene represent a recurrent genetic alteration in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To clarify the biologic implication of activation loop mutations of the KIT gene, 1940 randomly selected AML patients were analyzed. In total, 33 (1.7%) of 1940 patients were positive for D816 mutations. Of these 33 patients, 8 (24.2%) had a t(8;21), which was significantly higher compared with the subgroup without D816 mutations. Analyses of genetic subgroups showed that KIT-D816 mutations were associated with t(8;21)/AML1-ETO and other rare AML1 translocations. In contrast, other activating mutations like FLT3 and NRAS mutations were very rarely detected in AML1-rearranged leukemia. KIT mutations had an independent negative impact on overall (median 304 vs 1836 days; P = .006) and event-free survival (median 244 vs 744 days; P = .003) in patients with t(8;21) but not in patients with a normal karyotype. The KIT-D816V receptor expressed in Ba/F3 cells was resistant to growth inhibition by the selective PTK inhibitors imatinib and SU5614 but fully sensitive to PKC412. Our findings clearly indicate that activating mutations of receptor tyrosine kinases are associated with distinct genetic subtypes in AML. The KIT-D816 mutations confer a poor prognosis to AML1-ETO-positive AML and should therefore be included in the diagnostic workup. Patients with KIT-D816-positive/AML1-ETO-positive AML might benefit from early intensification of treatment or combination of conventional chemotherapy with KIT PTK inhibitors.",

While NPM1 mutations are associated with favourable prognosis in younger AML patients, Flt3-ITD mutations reflect an unfavourable prognostic factor in these patients. So far, especially NPM1 mutations have not yet been evaluated exclusively in older patients.;We retrospectively analysed the prevalence of NPM1 and Flt3-ITD mutations and its association with complete remission (CR), and survival in 99 elderly patients (median age 71 yr, range 60-85 yr) newly diagnosed for AML. Primary treatment approach was curative in 54, and palliative in 38 patients, while seven patients received best supportive care only. The mean follow-up of surviving patients was 600 d.;Sixty-seven patients were tested negative for NPM1 and Flt3-ITD mutations (group 1), 16 patients carried only a NPM1 mutation (group 2) and nine patients had only a Flt3-ITD mutation (group 3) while additional seven patients were positive for both aberrations (group 4). We can demonstrate a significant higher rate of CR comparing wildtype vs. NPM1 positive patients (40.5% for group 1 vs. 80.0% for group 2, P = 0.03) for patients receiving curative therapy. Interestingly, there is no significant difference in overall survival between group 1 and group 2 (Log-rank test P = 0.22, median 440 d vs. 1125 d). In contrast, patients carrying a Flt3-ITD mutation had a significant worse overall survival compared to wildtype patients (P = 0.03, median 210 d for group 3 + 4 vs. 634 d for group 1 + 2) while no difference of CR rate could be observed (42.8% vs. 48.9%, P = 0.91).;As elderly but medically fit patients with AML carrying a NPM1 mutation have a high CR rate, age itself should not be a barrier for induction treatment. However, new therapeutic concepts of postremission therapy (e.g. allogeneic stem cell transplantation after dose-reduced conditioning) should be considered for these patients in first CR.",

Limiting dilution analysis of sorted EPLM from Flt3L-treated mice showed that B-lymphocyte progenitor activity was reduced 20-fold, but that myeloid and T-cell progenitor activity was largely preserved.

In this study, we identified GTP-14564 as a specific kinase inhibitor for ITD-FLT3 and investigated the molecular basis of its specificity. GTP-14564 inhibited the growth of interleukin-3-independent Ba/F3 expressing ITD-FLT3 at 1 microM, whereas a 30-fold higher concentration of GTP-14564 was required to inhibit FLT3 ligand-dependent growth of Ba/F3 expressing wild type FLT3 (wt-FLT3). However, this inhibitor suppressed the kinase activities of wt-FLT3 and ITD-FLT3 equally, suggesting that the signaling pathways for proliferation differ between wt-FLT3 and ITD-FLT3. Analysis of downstream targets of FLT3 using GTP-14564 revealed STAT5 activation to be essential for growth signaling of ITD-FLT3. In contrast, wt-FLT3 appeared to mainly use the MAPK pathway rather than the STAT5 pathway to transmit a proliferative signal. Further analysis demonstrated that the first two tyrosines in an ITD were critical for STAT5 activation and growth induction but that all of the tyrosines in the juxtamembrane region were dispensable in terms of the proliferation signals of wt-FLT3. These results indicate that an ITD mutation in FLT3 elicits an aberrant STAT5 activation that results in increased sensitivity to GTP-14564. Thus, FLT3-targeted inhibition is an attractive approach, with the potential for selective cytotoxicity, to the treatment of ITD-FLT3-positive acute myeloid leukemia.",

Nevertheless, approximately two thirds of patients relapse due to persisting leukemic blasts. The persistence of these cells, below the threshold of morphological detection, is termed minimal residual disease (MRD) and various methods are used for its detection. These methods include classical cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization, qualitative and quantitative RT-PCR and multiparametric flow cytometry. Currently, less than half of the AML patients have a specific marker detectable by RT-PCR techniques. The major specific molecular markers are involvement of the MLL gene with up to 50 different partners and partial tandem duplications, the core binding factor leukemias with AML1/ETO and CBFbeta/MYH11 rearrangements, PML/RARalpha in acute promyelocytic leukemia, internal tandem duplications and mutations of FLT3 and some other rare translocations. In addition, several other genes show abnormal expression levels in AML, including the Wilms tumor gene, the PRAME gene and Ig/TCR rearrangements. Most of these genetic abnormalities can be detected by qualitative but more importantly by quantitative RT-PCR. The kinetics of disappearance of molecular markers in AML differs between the various types of leukemias, although at least a 2 log reduction of transcript after induction chemotherapy is necessary for long-term remission in all types. Conversely, the change of PCR from negativity to positivity is highly predictive of relapse. Whereas in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, multiparametric flow cytometry is an established method for MRD detection, this is less so in AML. The reason is the absence of well-characterized leukemia-specific antigens and the existence of phenotypic changes at relapse. On the other hand, this method is convenient due to its simplicity and universal applicability. In conclusion, several methods can be used for MRD detection in AML patients; each has its pros and cons. Several issues still remain to be settled including the choice of the best method and the timing for MRD monitoring and above all the practical clinical implications of MRD in the various types of AML.",

Low-density array analysis revealed the synergistic interaction involved in downregulation of cell cycle and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway genes. CCND1 and c-Mos were the most significantly inhibited targets on both transcriptional and translational levels. Treatment with short hairpin RNAs targeting either CCND1 or c-Mos further sensitized MV4-11 cells to ABT-869.

Flt3-activating mutations have been associated with poor prognosis and decreased overall survival of AML patients, thus Flt3 constitutes an ideal target for drug treatment of such disease. Unfortunately, the monotherapy with small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors in clinical trials shows that remission is not permanent, presumably by resistance of Flt3 mutants to inhibitors. An alternative approach for treatment is based on the cooperation between Flt3 and additional intracellular pathways for AML transformation in some patients. Thus, the inhibition of both Flt3 and such pathways may be exploited for successful treatment of the disease. We investigated the importance of Flt3-activating mutations for the constitutive activation of intracellular pathways in primary AML cells, and their effect on cell survival. We found that the main compounds involved in the differentiation, proliferation and survival of AML (MAPK/AKT/STAT) were constitutively activated. However, only four samples showed internal tandem duplications (ITDs) for Flt3. Surprisingly, contrary to previous reports, we found that inhibition of ITD/Flt3 activity did not prevent the phosphorylation of ERK, STAT5 or Akt in some primary AML cells. In parallel, we found that in these cells, Flt3 and ERK or Akt cooperate to regulate cell survival. Our results support the hypothesis that the optimal therapeutic treatment of AML may require not only the oncogenic tyrosine kinase, but also the appropriate combination of different specific inhibitors, thus providing a more effective approach to reverse leukaemogenesis. Thus, we propose that each AML patient should have an individually tailored combination treatment.",

New molecular markers could help to refine cytogenetic stratification.;We assessed P-glycoprotein (Pgp) activity and Flt3 internal tandem duplication (ITD+) because of their known prognostic value and because they might lead to targeted therapy. We did a multivariate analysis on 171 patients with adult AML treated in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer protocols.;ITD+ and high Pgp activity (Pgp+) were found in 26 of 171 (15%) and 55 of 171 (32%) of all patients, respectively. ITD and Pgp activities were negative in 94 of 171 (55%, Pgp-ITD- group), mutually exclusive in 73 of 171 (43%, Pgp-ITD+ and Pgp+ITD- groups), and only 4 of 171 (2%, Pgp+ITD+ group) patients were positive for both. In multivariate analyses, Pgp+ITD+ (P < 0.0001) and age (P = 0.0022) were independent prognostic factors for the achievement of complete remission (CR). Overall survival (OS), CR achievement (P < 0.0001), WHO performance status (P = 0.0007), and Pgp+ITD+ status (P = 0.0014) were also independent prognostic factors. In 95 patients with intermediate cytogenetics, the CR rates of ITD+ patients were 40% versus 62% for ITD- (P = 0.099) and 41% versus 67% (P = 0.014) for Pgp+ versus Pgp- patients.

In order to elucidate the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the Ara-C resistance induced by FLT3-ITD, we performed a microarray gene expression analysis of the human leukemic cell line K562 transduced with FLT3-ITD (K562/FLT3-ITD) and identified RUNX3 as a downstream target of FLT3-ITD. The transcriptional induction of the RUNX3 expression by FLT3-ITD was noted on a Luciferase assay. The knockdown of the RUNX3 expression in the K562/FLT3-ITD cells increased the sensitivity to Ara-C, and the exogenous expression of RUNX3 per se resulted in the enhancement of Ara-C resistance in the K562 cells. A relationship between the FLT3-ITD-induced RUNX3 expression and Ara-C resistance was also observed in AML cells with an endogenous FLT3-ITD expression. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that RUNX3 is a prerequisite for Ara-C resistance via FLT3-ITD signaling. ",

Since survival is poor once relapse occurs, new genetic tools above karyotype at diagnosis are needed to predict leukemia free survival. Recently, Flt3/ITD has been reported as an independent marker for clinical outcome in most studies concerning adult AML patients. To assess the prognostic relevance of activating mutations of Flt3, pretreatment samples of 100 not-M3 AML patients, all of them subjected to an intensive chemotherapy regimen, were analyzed for Flt3/ITD; 25/100 patients had one or more Flt3-ITD. Flt3/ITD patients had higher WBC count (P = 0.005), a lower incidence of a preceding MDS (P = 0.004) and most of them had a normal karyotype. Flt3/ITD had no impact on CR achievement while karyotype remained the most powerful prognostic factor (HR 2.8 95% CI 1.2 6.3). However, post-remission outcome was significantly worsened by the presence of Flt3/ITD. Median RFS of the Flt3/ITD patients was 5 vs. 27 months compared to the patients with wild-type Flt3 (P = 0.0002); moreover, Flt3/ITD patients had a significantly poorer post-remission survival (11 vs. 38 months, P = 0.01). On multivariate analysis, the presence of Flt3-ITD significantly affected relapse free survival and post-remission survival (HR 3.1 and 2.1, respectively). Thus, post-remission outcome highly depends on Flt3 status. Flt3 mutations identify patients at high risk of relapse, who should prospectively receive, according to age, either more aggressive or alternative therapeutic approaches.",

Internal tandem duplications in the hematopoietic growth factor receptor Flt3 have been shown to separate a subset of high risk patients from intermediate or low risk cases. In an attempt to further characterize the heterogeneity of prognosis among the cytogenetic intermediate risk group of AML, we investigated the overall survival, failure-free survival, initial therapy response and relapse rates of 103 patients with de novo AML in relation to autonomous proliferation and the proliferative response to a panel of 10 cytokines in a short-term thymidine incorporation assay. To exclude perturbation of the responses by other (known) risk factors our final intermediate risk population was comprised of patients with intermediate risk cytogenetics, having an age of 60 years of younger and not showing tandem duplications in the Flt3 gene. Among this intermediate risk group, only the responses to M-CSF and IL-1alpha were found to be predictive for therapy outcome. Results obtained by a 7-day culture with these cytokines revealed two subpopulations characterized by a good and a poor prognosis, respectively. The complete remission rates in these subpopulations were similar, but the relapse rates, failure-free survival and overall survival differed.

Five independent lines of vav-FLT3-ITD transgenic mice developed a myeloproliferative disease with high penetrance and a disease latency of 6-12 months. The phenotype was characterized by splenomegaly, megakaryocytic hyperplasia, and marked thrombocythemia, but without leukocytosis, polycythemia, or marrow fibrosis, displaying features reminiscent of the human disease essential thrombocythemia (ET). Clonal immature B- or T-lymphoid disease was observed in two additional founder mice, respectively, that could be secondarily transplanted to recipient mice that rapidly developed lymphoid disease. Treatment of these mice with the FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PKC412, resulted in suppression of disease and a statistically significant prolongation of survival. These results demonstrate that FLT3-ITD is capable of inducing myeloproliferative as well as lymphoid disease, and indicate that small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be an effective treatment for lymphoid malignancies in humans that are associated with activating mutations in FLT3.",

We extensively analyzed the expression of Flt3 in human (h) hematopoiesis. Strikingly, in both the bone marrow and the cord blood, the human hematopoietic stem cell population capable of long-term reconstitution in xenogeneic hosts uniformly expressed Flt3. Furthermore, human Flt3 is expressed not only in early lymphoid progenitors, but also in progenitors continuously along the granulocyte/macrophage pathway, including the common myeloid progenitor and the granulocyte/macrophage progenitor. We further found that human Flt3 signaling prevents stem and progenitors from spontaneous apoptotic cell death at least through up-regulating Mcl-1, an indispensable survival factor for hematopoiesis. Thus, the distribution of Flt3 expression is considerably different in human and mouse hematopoiesis, and human FLT3 signaling might play an important role in cell survival, especially at stem and progenitor cells that are critical cellular targets for acute myelogenous leukemia transformation.",

Mutations in FLT3, NPM1, and CEBPA provide prognostic information and have been integrated into clinical diagnostics and clinical practice. Comprehensive next-generation sequencing studies have given insight into AML pathogenesis. These insights are leading to refined prognostic stratification and suggest differentially tailored treatment based on integrated genetic profiles.

In AML with favorable cytogenetic changes, KIT gene mutation has been known as a worse prognostic marker. Even in AML with normal cytogenetics, numerous molecular genetic alterations have been identified including internal tandem duplication of the FLT3 gene (FLT3-ITD), mutations in the NPM1 gene, mutations in the CEBPA gene, and partial tandem duplication of the MLL gene. Of these, FLT3-ITD has the most important prognostic implication. Insights into the molecular pathogenesis of AML have led to the development of more specific targeted agents. Currently, a number of agents have been explored in AML, including immunoconjugate of anti-CD33 antibody and cytotoxic agent (gemtuzumab ozogamicin: GO), tyrosine kinase inhibitors and farnesyl transferase inhibitor. These agents have shown promise in small studies. Large phase III studies will reveal whether these are effective in inducing complete remission and prolonging survival. Combining targeted agents with each other or with chemotherapy may improve the response rates. GO is the most promising drug, which has been evaluated in randomized trials by several major cooperative groups to determine whether the addition of GO improves the complete remission rate and overall survival.

Tetracycline-inducible Bcl-2/Bcl-xL dual knockdown markedly sensitized acute myeloid leukemia cells to the dual TORC1/2 inhibitor INK128 in vitro as well as in vivo. Moreover, INK128 co-administered with the Bcl-2/xL antagonist ABT-737 sharply induced cell death in multiple acute myeloid leukemia cell lines, including TKI-resistant FLT3-ITD mutants and primary acute myeloid leukemia blasts carrying various genetic aberrations e.g., FLT3, IDH2, NPM1, and Kras, while exerting minimal toxicity toward normal hematopoietic CD34(+) cells. Combined treatment was particularly active against CD34(+)/CD38(-)/CD123(+) primitive leukemic progenitor cells. The INK128/ABT-737 regimen was also effective in the presence of a protective stromal microenvironment. Notably, INK128 was more potent than the TORC1 inhibitor rapamycin in down-regulating Mcl-1, diminishing AKT and 4EBP1 phosphorylation, and potentiating ABT-737 activity. Mcl-1 ectopic expression dramatically attenuated INK128/ABT-737 lethality, indicating an important functional role for Mcl-1 down-regulation in INK128/ABT-737 actions. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that combined treatment markedly diminished Bax, Bak, and Bim binding to all major anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 members (Bcl-2/Bcl-xL/Mcl-1), while Bax/Bak knockdown reduced cell death. Finally, INK128/ABT-737 co-administration sharply attenuated leukemia growth and significantly prolonged survival in a systemic acute myeloid leukemia xenograft model. Analysis of subcutaneous acute myeloid leukemia-derived tumors revealed significant decrease in 4EBP1 phosphorylation and Mcl-1 protein level, consistent with results obtained in vitro. These findings demonstrate that co-administration of dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitors and BH3-mimetics exhibits potent anti-leukemic activity in vitro and in vivo, arguing that this strategy warrants attention in acute myeloid leukemia.

It would therefore be useful to identify therapeutic agents that target leukaemic stem cells. We devised a flow cytometric chemosensitivity assay allowing 48 h culture of leukaemic blasts in a defined microenvironment followed by enumeration of viable CD34+CD38-CD123+ leukaemic stem and progenitor cells (LSPC). The assay was used to investigate the LSPC response to cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) and to the FLT3 inhibitor AG1296. There was a 3.6-fold increase in Ara-C-treated LSPC survival under defined 'niche-like' conditions compared to culture without microenvironmental support. Nine AML samples with internal tandem duplications of FLT3 (FLT3/ITDs) were treated with AG1296. Three samples were very sensitive (>50% kill) and 4 were moderately sensitive (10-50% kill) in bulk suspension culture without microenvironmental support. However, under defined 'niche-like' conditions, the survival of LSPC was enhanced rather than inhibited by AG1296 treatment. We conclude that an interaction between LSPC and a defined in vitro microenvironment models a chemoresistant niche.

In blasts from acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients, 2 classes of FLT3 activating mutations have been identified: internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in the juxtamembrane domain (25%-30% of patients) and point mutations in the kinase domain activation loop (7%-8% of patients). FLT3-ITD mutations are the most common molecular defect identified in AML and have been shown to be an independent prognostic factor for decreased survival. FLT3-ITD is therefore an attractive molecular target for therapy. SU11248 is a recently described selective inhibitor with selectivity for split kinase domain RTKs, including platelet-derived growth factor receptors, vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, and KIT. We show that SU11248 also has potent activity against wild-type FLT3 (FLT3-WT), FLT3-ITD, and FLT3 activation loop (FLT3-Asp835) mutants in phosphorylation assays. SU11248 inhibits FLT3-driven phosphorylation and induces apoptosis in vitro. In addition, SU11248 inhibits FLT3-induced VEGF production. The in vivo efficacy of SU11248 was investigated in 2 FLT3-ITD models: a subcutaneous tumor xenograft model and a bone marrow engraftment model. We show that SU11248 (20 mg/kg/d) dramatically regresses FLT3-ITD tumors in the subcutaneous tumor xenograft model and prolongs survival in the bone marrow engraftment model. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis in subcutaneous tumors showed that a single administration of an efficacious drug dose potently inhibits FLT3-ITD phosphorylation for up to 16 hours following a single dose. These results suggest that further exploration of SU11248 activity in AML patients is warranted.",

So far, the differential impact of resistance gene expression on treatment outcome in AML is not clear. Therefore, we examined MDR1, MRP1 and LRP gene expression at diagnosis in 331 adult AML patients in the context of other known prognostic factors, such as age, disease status, cytogenetics and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-internal tandem duplication mutational status. Median observation time was longer than 5 years [64.1 months (40.0-87.6)]. MDR1 expression proved to be an independent prognostic factor for outcome of induction therapy (P <0.001) and overall survival (P=0.02), whereas MRP1 expression was an independent predictor for disease-free survival (P=0.01) in the multivariate analysis. This prognostic impact of both resistance genes was also found in patients with intermediate risk cytogenetics. LRP expression, however, had no impact on treatment outcome in AML.

SOCS6 (suppressor of cytokine signaling 6) is a member of the SOCS family of E3 ubiquitin ligases that can regulate receptor tyrosine kinase signal transduction. In this study, we analyzed the role of SOCS6 in Flt3 signal transduction. The results show that ligand stimulation of Flt3 can induce association of SOCS6 and Flt3 and tyrosine phosphorylation of SOCS6. Phosphopeptide fishing indicated that SOCS6 binds directly to phosphotyrosines 591 and 919 of Flt3. By using stably transfected Ba/F3 cells with Flt3 and/or SOCS6, we show that the presence of SOCS6 can enhance ubiquitination of Flt3, as well as internalization and degradation of the receptor. The presence of SOCS6 also induces weaker activation of Erk1/2, but not Akt, in transfected Ba/F3 and UT-7 cells and in OCI-AML-5 cells. The absence of SOCS6 promotes Ba/F3 and UT-7 cell proliferation induced by oncogenic internal tandem duplications of Flt3. Taken together, these results suggest that SOCS6 negatively regulates Flt3 activation, the downstream Erk signaling pathway, and cell proliferation.",

To study resistance to TKIs targeting FLT3, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is frequently mutated in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), we developed resistant human cell lines through prolonged coculture with FLT3 TKIs. FLT3 TKI-resistant cell lines and primary samples still exhibit inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation on FLT3 TKI treatment. However, FLT3 TKI-resistant cell lines and primary samples often show continued activation of downstream PI3K/Akt and/or Ras/MEK/MAPK signaling pathways as well as continued expression of genes involved in FLT3-mediated cellular transformation. Inhibition of these signaling pathways restores partial sensitivity to FLT3 TKIs. Mutational screening of FLT3 TKI-resistant cell lines revealed activating N-Ras mutations in 2 cell lines that were not present in the parental FLT3 TKI-sensitive cell line. Taken together, these data indicate that FLT3 TKI-resistant cells most frequently become FLT3 independent because of activation of parallel signaling pathways that provide compensatory survival/proliferation signals when FLT3 is inhibited. Anti-FLT3 mAb treatment was still cytotoxic to FLT3 TKI-resistant clones.

In contrast to the oncogenic role of miR-22 reported in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and breast cancer, here we show that miR-22 is an essential anti-tumour gatekeeper in de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) where it is significantly downregulated. Forced expression of miR-22 significantly suppresses leukaemic cell viability and growth in vitro, and substantially inhibits leukaemia development and maintenance in vivo. Mechanistically, miR-22 targets multiple oncogenes, including CRTC1, FLT3 and MYCBP, and thus represses the CREB and MYC pathways. The downregulation of miR-22 in AML is caused by TET1/GFI1/EZH2/SIN3A-mediated epigenetic repression and/or DNA copy-number loss. Furthermore, nanoparticles carrying miR-22 oligos significantly inhibit leukaemia progression in vivo. Together, our study uncovers a TET1/GFI1/EZH2/SIN3A/miR-22/CREB-MYC signalling circuit and thereby provides insights into epigenetic/genetic mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AML, and also highlights the clinical potential of miR-22-based AML therapy.

However, there has been little progress in the treatment of older adults. This disappointing observation is important because the median age of patients with AML is about 70 years. Approximately 60%-80% of younger adults with AML achieve complete remission (CR) with the cytotoxic agents cytarabine and an anthracycline such as daunorubicin or idarubicin or the anthracenedione mitoxantrone. However, only 30%-40% of such patients are alive and disease-free at 5 years. Among older adults, CR is achieved in 40%-55%, but there are very few long-term survivors. Many studies have evaluated the impact of alternative doses and schedules, as well as additional cytotoxic drugs, on the prognosis for this group of patients. The outcome has not improved substantially beyond that achieved with conventional doses of an anthracycline and cytarabine followed by high-dose cytarabine consolidation.Several factors identified at diagnosis can predict outcome. The most important of these is the karyotype of the leukemic cells. Another critical factor is the presence of transmembrane transporter proteins, which confer multidrug resistance and mutations in or overexpression of specific genes such as WT1, C/EBPalpha, BAX, and BCL-2/BAX ratio, BAALC, EVI1, KIT and FLT3. The development of specific agents directed at gene mutations, signal transduction pathways and unique cell surface antigens provide the foundation for new therapeutic strategies. Such agents include the immunoconjugate gemtuzumab ozogamicin, multidrug resistance inhibitors, farnesyltransferase inhibitors, histone deacetylase and proteosome inhibitors, antiangiogenesis agents, FLT3 inhibitors, apoptosis inhibitors, and nucleoside analogs.

In addition to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, therapeutic strategies that modulate the expression of FLT3-ITD are also promising. We show that AML samples bearing FLT3-ITD mutations are more sensitive to proteasome inhibitors than wild-type samples and this sensitivity is strongly correlated with a higher FLT3-ITD allelic burden. Using pharmacologic inhibitors of autophagy, specific downregulation of key autophagy proteins including Vps34, autophagy gene (Atg)5, Atg12, Atg13, biochemical, and microscopy studies, we demonstrated that proteasome inhibitors induced cytotoxic autophagy in AML cells. FLT3-ITD molecules were detectable within autophagosomes after bortezomib treatment indicating that autophagy induction was responsible for the early degradation of FLT3-ITD, which preceded the inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), PI3K/AKT, and STAT5 pathways, and subsequent activation of cell death. Moreover, proteasome inhibitors overcome resistance to quizartinib induced by mutations in the kinase domain of FLT3, suggesting that these compounds may prevent the emergence of mutant clones arising from tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatments. In xenograft mice models, bortezomib stimulated the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, indicating induction of autophagy in vivo, downregulated FLT3-ITD protein expression and improved overall survival. Therefore, selecting patients according to FLT3-ITD mutations could be a new way to detect a significant clinical activity of proteasome inhibitors in AML patients. ",

Here we show that Pim2 can complement Flt3-Wt signaling and induce transformation similar to Flt3-ITD in myeloid cells. Our data demonstrate that Pim2 is necessary but not sufficient for Flt3-ITD-induced transformation of 32D cells and primary bone marrow cells as assessed by colony assays. Pim2-induced clonogenic growth of FL-treated 32D-Flt3-Wt cells. Proliferation of 32D-Flt3-Wt cells was significantly enhanced in FL-treated Pim2-overexpressing cells. This increase was associated with enhanced S-phase cell cycle progression. Pim2-overexpressing cells were resistant to apoptosis induced by growth factor deprivation or treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (PKC412). The Flt3 point mutant D835Y, which is not able to support colony growth of myeloid cells, also induced clonogenic growth in the presence of Pim2. In conclusion, Pim2 is an important target of Flt3-ITD-induced transformation, and overexpression of Pim2 together with Flt3-Wt or D835Y receptor mimics Flt3-ITD-mediated transformation.

This pilot study describes the first attempt to characterize non-cycling cells from a small series of human FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutation positive samples. CD34+ AML cells from patients with FLT3 mutation positive AML were cultured on murine stroma. In expansion cultures, non-cycling cells were found to retain CD34+ expression in contrast to dividing cells. Leukaemic gene rearrangements could be detected in non-cycling cells, indicating their leukaemic origin. Significantly, the FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation was found in the non-cycling fraction of four out of five cases. Exposure to the FLT3-directed inhibitor TKI258 clearly inhibited the growth of AML CD34+ cells in short-term cultures and colony-forming unit assays. Crucially, non-cycling cells were not eradicated, with the exception of one case, which exhibited exquisite sensitivity to the compound. Moreover, in longer-term cultures, TKI258-treated non-cycling cells showed no growth impairment compared to treatment-naive non-cycling cells. These findings suggest that non-cycling cells in AML may constitute a disease reservoir that is resistant to TK inhibition. Further studies with a larger sample size and other inhibitors are warranted.",

Two critical features necessary for maximizing TKI tolerability and response duration are kinase selectivity and invulnerability to resistance-conferring kinase domain (KD) mutations in the intended target. No prior TKI has demonstrated both of these properties. Aiming to maximize selectivity, medicinal chemists have largely sought to create TKIs that bind to an inactive (type II) kinase conformation. Here we demonstrate that the investigational type I TKI crenolanib is a potent inhibitor of Fms tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) internal tandem duplication, a validated therapeutic target in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as well as all secondary KD mutants previously shown to confer resistance to the first highly active FLT3 TKI quizartinib. Moreover, crenolanib is highly selective for FLT3 relative to the closely related protein tyrosine kinase KIT, demonstrating that simultaneous FLT3/KIT inhibition, a prominent feature of other clinically active FLT3 TKIs, is not required for AML cell cytotoxicity in vitro and may contribute to undesirable toxicity in patients. A saturation mutagenesis screen of FLT3-internal tandem duplication failed to recover any resistant colonies in the presence of a crenolanib concentration well below what has been safely achieved in humans, suggesting that crenolanib has the potential to suppress KD mutation-mediated clinical resistance. Crenolanib represents the first TKI to exhibit both kinase selectivity and invulnerability to resistance-conferring KD mutations, which is unexpected of a type I inhibitor. Crenolanib has significant promise for achieving deep and durable responses in FLT3-mutant AML, and may have a profound impact upon future medicinal chemistry efforts in oncology. ",

PATIENTS AND METHODS Diagnostic bone marrow or blood samples from 358 patients were analyzed for IDH1 and IDH2 mutations by DNA polymerase chain reaction amplification/sequencing. FLT3, NPM1, CEBPA, WT1, and MLL mutational analyses and gene- and microRNA-expression profiling were performed centrally. Results IDH mutations were found in 33% of the patients. IDH1 mutations were detected in 49 patients (14%; 47 with R132). IDH2 mutations, previously unreported in AML, were detected in 69 patients (19%; 13 with R172 and 56 with R140). R172 IDH2 mutations were mutually exclusive with all other prognostic mutations analyzed. Younger age (< 60 years), molecular low-risk (NPM1-mutated/FLT3-internal tandem duplication-negative) IDH1-mutated patients had shorter disease-free survival than molecular low-risk IDH1/IDH2-wild-type (wt) patients (P = .046). R172 IDH2-mutated patients had lower complete remission rates than IDH1/IDH2wt patients (P = .007). Distinctive microarray gene- and microRNA-expression profiles accurately predicted R172 IDH2 mutations. The highest expressed gene and microRNAs in R172 IDH2-mutated patients compared with the IDH1/IDH2wt patients were APP (previously associated with complex karyotype AML) and miR-1 and miR-133 (involved in embryonal stem-cell differentiation), respectively. CONCLUSION IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are recurrent in CN-AML and have an unfavorable impact on outcome. The R172 IDH2 mutations, previously unreported in AML, characterize a novel subset of CN-AML patients lacking other prognostic mutations and associate with unique gene- and microRNA-expression profiles that may lead to the discovery of novel, therapeutically targetable leukemogenic mechanisms.",

The exact developmental stages at which hematopoietic progenitors express Flt3, are responsive to its ligand, and subsequently develop to DCs, are not known. Here we show that common lymphoid and common myeloid progenitors, as well as steady state DCs in thymus, spleen, and epidermis, express Flt3. The receptor is down-regulated once definitive B cell, T cell, and megakaryocyte/erythrocyte commitment occurs, and Flt3 is not detectable on other steady state hematopoietic cell populations. Upon in vivo Flt3 ligand (Flt3L) administration, Flt3+ progenitor cells and their progeny DCs are expanded, whereas Flt3- downstream progenitors are not, or are only slightly increased. Transplantation of common lymphoid and common myeloid progenitors and subsequent Flt3L injection increases progeny DCs of both precursor populations. These findings provide a definitive map of Flt3 expression in the hematopoietic hierarchy and directly demonstrate that Flt3L can drive DC development along both the lymphoid and myeloid developmental pathways from Flt3+ progenitors to Flt3+ DCs.",

Activating mutations of FLT3 are present in approximately one-third of acute myeloid leukaemia patients and are associated with adverse clinical outcome, while many non-mutated cases also show evidence of FLT3 activation. FLT3 thus represents a potentially exciting molecular therapeutic target. A number of small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors with anti-FLT3 activity have been developed and several of these compounds have entered early phase clinical trials where clinical anti-leukaemic activity has been demonstrated. The depth and duration of clinical responses to FLT3 inhibitor monotherapy have been modest, however, and a number of mechanisms by which blasts may acquire resistance have been proposed. Based on preclinical evidence of synergy with conventional chemotherapy, several combination trials are now underway. FLT3 inhibition may also be effective used in combination with other molecularly targeted agents, in postchemotherapy stem-cell-directed maintenance therapy and in MLL-rearranged infant acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.",

The present study explored the expression of CDw131 in 105 de novo cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The levels of CDw131 expression were used to identify two AML subgroups characterized by low (75/105) and high (30/105) expression of this receptor chain. It was observed that (i) the level of CDw131 expression strictly correlated with the level of CD116 (GM-CSFalpha receptor chain) and CD123 (IL-3Ralpha chain); (ii) AMLs with high CDw131 expression were characterized by low CD34 expression and usually high CD11b, CD14 expression; (iii) AMLs with high CDw131 expression frequently co-expressed receptors for angiogenic growth factors (vascular endothelial growth factor R2, Tie-2); (iv) AMLs with high CDw131 expression were more cycling than those with low CDw131 expression; (v) AMLs with high CDw131 frequently displayed Feline Murine Sarcoma (FMS-related) tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internal tandem duplication and constitutively activated Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription-5 (STAT5). In conclusion, the analysis of the level of CDw131 expression enabled the identification of a subset of AMLs characterized by a high cycling status, the expression of myelo-monocytic markers, mutated FLT3 and the co-expression of receptors for angiogenic growth factors.

Such an approach redefined cytogenetic/genetic categories in 2 groups: (1) low-risk, including good/intermediate K-MRD(-) with 4-year RFS and OS of 58% and 73%, respectively; and (2) high risk, including poor-risk K, FLT3-ITD mutated cases, good/intermediate K-MRD(+) categories, with RFS and OS of 22% and 17%, respectively (P < .001 for all comparisons).

We have investigated the therapeutic potential of the novel Akt inhibitor, perifosine, on human AML cells. Perifosine is a synthetic alkylphospholipid, a new class of antitumor agents, which target plasma membrane and inhibit signal transduction networks. Perifosine was tested on THP-1 and MV 4-11 cell lines, as well as primary leukemia cells. Perifosine treatment induced cell death by apoptosis in AML cell lines. Perifosine caused Akt and ERK 1/2 dephosphorylation as well as caspase activation. In THP-1 cells, the proapoptotic effect of perifosine was partly dependent on the Fas/FasL system and c-jun-N-kinase activation. In MV 4-11 cells, perifosine downregulated phosphorylated Akt, but not phosphorylated FLT3. Moreover, perifosine reduced the clonogenic activity of AML, but not normal, CD34(+) cells, and markedly increased blast cell sensitivity to etoposide. Our findings indicate that perifosine, either alone or in combination with existing drugs, might be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of those AML cases characterized by upregulation of the PI3K-Akt survival pathway.",

Among these new drugs are farnesyltransferase inhibitors and receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors including FLT3 and VEGF inhibitors. These agents have been tested in patients with solid tumors and hematologic malignancies such as AML and MDS. Most of the studies in MDS are still in early stages of development. The DNA hypomethylating compounds azacytidine and decitabine may reduce hypermethylation and induce re-expression of key tumor suppressor genes in MDS. Biochemical compounds with histone deacetylase inhibitory activity, such as valproic acid (VPA), have been tested as antineoplastic agents. Finally, new vaccination strategies are developing in MDS patients based on the identification of MDS-associated antigens.

They are associated with a poor prognosis of the disease. In this study, we characterized the oncogenic potential and signaling properties of Flt3 mutations. We constructed chimeric molecules that consisted of the murine Flt3 backbone and a 510-base pair human Flt3 fragment, which contained either 4 different ITD mutants or the wild-type coding sequence. Flt3 isoforms containing ITD mutations (Flt3-ITD) induced factor-independent growth and resistance to radiation-induced apoptosis in 32D cells. Cells containing Flt3-ITD, but not those containing wild-type Flt3 (Flt3-WT), formed colonies in methylcellulose. Injection of 32D/Flt3-ITD induced rapid development of a leukemia-type disease in syngeneic mice. Flt3-ITD mutations exhibited constitutive autophosphorylation of the immature form of the Flt3 receptor. Analysis of the involved signal transduction pathways revealed that Flt3-ITD only slightly activated the MAP kinases Erk1 and 2 and the protein kinase B (Akt) in the absence of ligand and retained ligand-induced activation of these enzymes. However, Flt3-ITD led to strong factor-independent activation of STAT5. The relative importance of the STAT5 and Ras pathways for ITD-induced colony formation was assessed by transfection of dominant negative (dn) forms of these proteins: transfection of dnSTAT5 inhibited colony formation by 50%. Despite its weak constitutive activation by Flt3-ITD, dnRas also strongly inhibited Flt3-ITD-mediated colony formation. Taken together, Flt3-ITD mutations induce factor-independent growth and leukemogenesis of 32D cells that are mediated by the Ras and STAT5 pathways. (Blood. 2000;96:3907-3914)",

We found 103 of 165 identified mutations were overlapped with other mutations, and most overlap-mutations consisted of class I and class II mutations. Although overlap-mutations within the same class were found in seven patients, five of them additionally had the other class mutation. These results suggest that most overlap-mutations within the same class might be the consequence of acquiring an additional mutation after the completion both of class I and class II mutations. However, mutated genes overlapped with the same class were limited in N-RAS, TP53, MLL-PTD, and NPM1, suggesting the possibility that these irregular overlap-mutations might cooperatively participate in the development of AML. Notably, TP53 mutation was overlapped with both class I and class II mutations, and associated with morphologic multilineage dysplasia and complex karyotype. The genotype consisting of complex karyotype and TP53 mutation was an unfavorable prognostic factor in entire AML patients, indicating this genotype generates a disease entity in de novo AML.

Subsequent preclinical studies with bortezomib in AML cells have shown drug-induced miR-29b up-regulation, resulting in loss of transcriptional activation for several genes relevant to myeloid leukemogenesis, including DNA methyltransferases and receptor tyrosine kinases. Thus, a phase 1 trial of bortezomib and decitabine was developed. Nineteen poor-risk AML patients (median age 70 years; range, 32-84 years) enrolled. Induction with decitabine (20 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1-10) plus bortezomib (escalated up to the target 1.3 mg/m(2) on days 5, 8, 12, and 15) was tolerable, but bortezomib-related neuropathy developed after repetitive cycles. Of previously untreated patients (age ≥ 65 years), 5 of 10 had CR (complete remission, n = 4) or incomplete CR (CRi, n = 1); 7 of 19 overall had CR/CRi. Pharmacodynamic analysis showed FLT3 down-regulation on day 26 of cycle 1 (P = .02).

Detection of ITD-positive minor clones at the initial diagnosis and during the minimal residual disease stage may be essential. We previously designed a delta-PCR strategy to improve the sensitivity to 0.1% ITD-positive leukemia cells and showed that minor mutants with an allele burden of <1% can be clinically significant. In this study, we report on tandem duplication PCR (TD-PCR), a modified inverse PCR assay, and demonstrate a limit of detection of a few molecules of ITD mutants. The TD-PCR was initially designed to confirm ITD mutation of an amplicon, which was undetectable by capillary electrophoresis and was incidentally isolated by a molecular fraction collecting tool. Subsequently, TD-PCR detected ITD mutation in 2 of 77 patients previously reported as negative for ITD mutation by a standard PCR assay. TD-PCR can also potentially be applied to monitor minimal residual disease with high analytic sensitivity in a portion of ITD-positive acute myeloid leukemia patients. Further studies using TD-PCR to detect ITD mutants at diagnosis may clarify the clinical significance of those ITD mutants with extremely low allele burden. ",

Coexpression analysis of AC133 and defined antigens on CD34+ BM cells revealed that the majority of the CD164+, CD135+, CD117+, CD38low, CD33+, and CD71low cells resides in the AC133+ population. In contrast, most of the CD10+ and CD19+ B cell progenitors and a fraction of the CD71high population are AC133-, indicating that CD34+AC133+ cells are enriched in primitive and myeloid progenitor cells, whereas CD34+AC133- cells mainly consist of B cell and late erythroid progenitors. This corresponds to the highly reduced percentage of CD10+ B cells and the absence of CD71high erythroid progenitors on AC133+ selected BM cells. A portion of 0.2-0.7% of the AC133+ selected cells do not coexpress CD34. These cells are very small and define a uniform CD71-, CD117-, CD10-, CD38low, CD135+, HLA-DRhigh, CD45+ population with unknown delineation. Four color analysis on CD34+CD38- BM cells revealed that virtually all of these primitive cells express AC133. Using an improved liposome-enhanced labeling technique for the staining of weakly expressed antigens, subsets of this population could be identified which express the angiopoietin receptors TIE (67.6%) and TEK (36.8%), the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors FLT1 (7%), FLT4 (3.2%), and KDR (10.4%), or the receptor tyrosine kinases HER-2 (15.4%) and FLT3 (CD135; 77.6%).

Several FLT3 kinase inhibitors have shown impressive activity in clinical evaluation, however clinical responses are usually transient and clinical effects are rapidly lost due to drug resistance. One of the resistance mechanisms in the AML refractory patients involves FLT3-ligand induced reactivation of AKT and/or ERK signaling via FLT3 wt kinase. Via a screen of numerous AKT kinase inhibitors, we identified the well-established orally available AKT inhibitor, A674563, as a dual suppressor of AKT and FLT3-ITD. A674563 suppressed FLT3-ITD positive AML both in vitro and in vivo. More importantly, compared to other FLT3 inhibitors, A674563 is able to overcome FLT3 ligand-induced drug resistance through simultaneous inhibition of FLT3-ITD- and AKT-mediated signaling.

We determined whether baseline and/or early changes in the methylation of long interspersed element (LINE)-1 or CDH13 correlate with bone marrow blast clearance, hematological response, or survival in patients with AML treated with azacitidine.;An open label, phase I/II trial was performed in 40 AML patients (median bone marrow blast count was 42%) unfit for intensive chemotherapy treated with azacitidine 75 mg/m(2)/day subcutaneously for 5 days every 4 weeks. Bone marrow mononuclear cell samples were taken on day 0 (pretreatment) and day 15 during the first treatment cycle; LINE-1 and CDH13 methylation levels were quantified by methylation-specific, semiquantitative, real-time polymerase chain reaction.;Treatment with azacitidine significantly reduced LINE-1 but not CDH13 methylation levels over the first cycle (P < 0.0001). Absolute LINE-1 methylation levels tended to be lower on day 0 (P = 0.06) and day 15 of cycle 1 (P = 0.03) in patients who went on to achieve subsequent complete remission, partial remission or hematological improvement versus patients with stable disease. However, the decrease in LINE-1 methylation over the first treatment cycle did not correlate with subsequent response (P = 0.31). Baseline methylation levels of LINE-1 or CDH13 did not correlate with disease-related prognostic factors, including cytogenetic risk, relapsed/refractory AML, or presence of NPM1 or FLT3 mutations.

The ligand for FLT3 is expressed by marrow stromal cells and other cells and synergizes with other growth factors to stimulate proliferation of stem cells, progenitor cells, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells. Mutations of FLT3 have been detected in about 30% of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and a small number of patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. Patients with FLT3 mutations tend to have a poor prognosis. The mutations most often involve small tandem duplications of amino acids within the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor and result in constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. Expression of a mutant FLT3 receptor in murine marrow cells results in a lethal myeloproliferative syndrome and preliminary studies suggest that mutant FLT3 cooperates with other leukemia oncogenes to confer a more aggressive phenotype.

We studied genetic changes occurring over time in cancers presenting with a relatively simple karyotype, namely two related core-binding factor (CBF) acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs), to assess how specific chromosomal changes are selected based on tumor subtype and acquired somatic mutations. Expression profiles for DNA replication/repair genes and the mutation status of KRAS, NRAS, FLT3, and KIT were compared with the karyotypic changes at diagnosis and relapse(s) in 94 cases of inv(16)(p13.1q22)-AML and 82 cases of t(8;21)(q22;q22)-AML. The majority of both AML types demonstrated a simple aneuploid pattern of cytogenetic progression, with highly distinctive patterns of chromosome copy number changes, such as +22 and +13 exclusively in inv(16)-AML and -Y and -X in t(8;21)-AML. Selection of certain cytogenetic changes correlated with particular somatic mutations, such as +8 with RAS mutation, and absence of kinase pathway mutations in t(8;21)-AML with localized deletions at chromosome band 9q22. Alterations in transcript levels of mitotic spindle kinases such as CHEK1, AURKA, and AURKB were associated with the aneuploid progression pattern, particularly in t(8;21) cases. Despite the similarity in the initiating genetics of the two CBF AML types, highly tumor-specific patterns of limited aneuploidy are noted that persist and continue to accumulate at relapse. Thus, activation of genetic instability, possibly through mitotic spindle dysregulation, leads rapidly to the selection of advantageous single chromosome aneuploidy.",

The favorable impact of NPM1 mutations on OS and EFS clearly emerged in the large group (264 [66.8%] of 395 cases) of normal-karyotype AML without FLT3-LM. This positive effect was lost in the presence of a concomitant FLT3-LM, since survival of the NPM1+/FLT3-LM+ double positive was similar to NPM1-/FLT3-LM+ cases. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that NPM1+/FLT3-LM- mutations are an independent predictor for a favorable outcome in AML with normal karyotype.",

        "Doc_abstract":"In recent years, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) has become increasingly common in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) due to improved donor availability and the use of nonmyeloablative regimens. However, despite the potential clinical gains with allo-HSCT, the post-transplantation outcomes for many patients, especially those with high-risk disease, remain dismal. Patients with AML who have internal tandem duplication mutations in the tyrosine kinase receptor FLT3 (FLT3-ITD) face particularly poor outcomes, even after allo-HSCT, which appears to only partially mitigate the poor prognosis associated with this mutation. Experimental treatments to reduce the likelihood of relapse and improve survival following allo-HSCT include maintenance with FLT3-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), several of which are currently being evaluated in clinical studies. Preliminary data and case reports suggest that FLT3 TKIs can be effective in the post-transplantation setting, particularly for patients with FLT3-ITD mutations. Improvements in donor matching, transplantation procedures, and supportive care have allowed a greater number of patients to undergo allo-HSCT than ever before. For these patients, it is essential to identify effective post-transplantation therapies to reduce the risk of relapse and improve disease-free survival. ",

The different tumor types expressed very different numbers of receptor tyrosine kinases: whereas brain tumors and testicular cancer expressed 50 receptor tyrosine kinases, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples expressed only 20 different ones. Specimens of similar tumor origin exhibited characteristic receptor tyrosine kinase expression patterns and were grouped together in hierarchical cluster analyses. When we focused on specific tumor entities, receptor tyrosine kinases were identified that were disease and/or stage specific. Leukemic blasts from AML bone marrow samples differed significantly in receptor tyrosine kinase expression compared with normal bone marrow and purified CD34+ cells. Among the differentially expressed receptor tyrosine kinases, we found FLT3, c-kit, CSF1 receptor, EPHB6, leukocyte tyrosine kinase, and ptk7 to be highly overexpressed in AML samples. Whereas expression changes of some of these were associated with altered differentiation patterns (e.g., CSF1 receptor), others, such as FLT3, were genuinely overexpressed in leukemic blasts.

Cytogenetics-based stratification improves survival. Patients with AML and normal cytogenetics, the largest single subgroup, have had a very heterogeneous outcome with standard chemotherapy in multiple clinical trials. Hence it is difficult to recommend a \"one size fits all\" kind of treatment for this heterogeneous population of AML patients. New emerging data from preclinical, retrospective, and large, randomized controlled studies indicate that in addition to cytogenetic abnormalities, many other molecular aberrations are operative in the response to treatment as well as in the risk of relapse. Such molecular markers are being tested for developing targeted therapies and may help in improved stratification of patients in the selection of post-remission therapy. Emerging evidence reveals that at the submicroscopic level, AML with normal cytogenetics may carry poor prognostic genetic lesions or \"molecular signatures\" as is the case with FLT3 mutations and overexpression of BAALC, ERG or MN1, or may have aberrations that predict better risk as is the case with isolated NPM1 or CEBPA mutations. Later studies have tried to explore the interaction of various prognostically important genes in this group of AML patients. The utility of the evolving data for bedside management of such patients is expected to improve with the wider application of modern tools, using the proposed clinical outcome models, and probably by development of a risk-scoring system based on the relative risk associated with each molecular aberration. The goals include identifying those patients most likely to benefit from upfront allogeneic HSCT and sparing good-prognosis patients from unnecessary transplant-related morbidity. The following is an outline of the most common molecular changes, their impact on the outcome of AML patients with normal cytogenetics and challenges in their wide scale application in risk stratification.",

All cytokine receptors examined were expressed at varying levels, whereas the levels of IL-3Rα, GM-CSFRα, IL-2Rα, γc, c-kit, and G-CSFR exhibited a wide spectrum of ≥10,000 sites/cell. In terms of their French-American-British classification types, GM-CSFRα and c-fms were preferentially expressed in M4/M5 patients, G-CSF in M3 patients, and IL-2Rα in non-M3 patients. Elevated levels of IL-3Rα, GM-CSFRα, and IL-2Rα correlated with leukocytosis. In patients ≤60 years old, higher levels of these 3 receptors correlated with poor responses to conventional chemotherapy, but only IL-2Rα was associated with a shorter overall survival. By incorporating IL-2Rα status into cytogenetic risk stratification, we could sort out a significantly adverse-risk cohort from the cytogenetically intermediate-risk group. Analyses with various phenotypical risk markers revealed the expression of IL-2Rα as an independent prognostic indicator in patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics. These findings were not observed in patients >60 years old. Our results indicate that several cytokine receptors were associated with certain cellular and clinical features, but IL-2Rα alone had prognostic value that provides an additional marker to improve current risk evaluation in AML patients ≤60 years old.

Twenty gene mutations including class I, class II, class III of epigenetic regulators (IDH1, IDH2, TET2, DNMT3A, MLL-PTD, ASXL1, and EZH2), and class IV (tumor suppressor genes) were analyzed in 67 patients with AML-M0. Mutational analysis was performed with polymerase chain reaction-based assays followed by direct sequencing. The most frequent gene mutations from our data were FLT3-ITD/FLT3-TKD (28.4%), followed by mutations in IDH1/IDH2 (28.8%), RUNX1 (23.9%), N-RAS/K-RAS (12.3%), TET2 (8.2%), DNMT3A (8.1%), MLL-PTD (7.8%), and ASXL1 (6.3%). Seventy-nine percent (53/67) of patients had at least one gene mutation. Class I genes (49.3%) were the most common mutated genes, which were mutually exclusive. Class III genes of epigenetic regulators were also frequent (43.9%). In multivariate analysis, old age [hazard ratio (HR) 1.029, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.013-1.044, P=.001) was the independent adverse factor for overall survival, and RUNX1 mutation (HR 2.326, 95% CI 0.978-5.533, P=.056) had a trend toward inferior survival. In conclusion, our study showed a high frequency of FLT3, RUNX1, and IDH mutations in AML-M0, suggesting that these mutations played a role in the pathogenesis and served as potential therapeutic targets in this rare and unfavorable subtype of AML.

Further, among elderly patients, aggressive therapy options are often limited due to other medical conditions and decreased tolerance of these patients to conventional chemotherapy. Internal tandem duplications (ITD) of the FLT3 juxtamembrane domain occur in 20-30% of AML patients and predict poor outcome. First clinical data with the FLT3 inhibitor tandutinib demonstrated antileukemic activity in approximately half of the patients--predominantly with FLT3 ITD positive AML. But the data also show that optimal use of tandutinib will require combination therapy with cytotoxic agents. Notably, single agent tandutinib has not been associated with myelosuppression, mucositis or cardiac toxicity--the dose limiting toxicities of AML chemotherapy. We determined the feasibility of combining tandutinib with the standard \"3 + 7\" induction regimen in AML and show that, in contrast to other structurally unrelated FLT3 inhibitors recently evaluated in clinical trials, the use of tandutinib displayed application sequence independent synergistic antileukemic effects in combination with cytarabine and daunorubicin. Strong synergistic antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects were thereby predominantly seen on FLT3 ITD positive blasts. Further we demonstrate, that addition of tandutinib may allow dose reduction of chemotherapy without loss of overall antileukemic activity--resulting in a potential decrease of side effects. This approach might be an interesting novel strategy especially in the treatment of elderly/comorbid patients.

Forty- five patients were screened for mutations in DNMT3A (R882), IDH1 (R132) and IDH2 (R140 and R172) genes by direct sequencing. Of the 45 patients screened, DNMT3A and IDH mutations were observed in 6 (13.3%) and 7 (15.4%), respectively. Patients with isolated DNMT3A mutations were seen in 4 cases (9%), isolated IDH mutations in 5 (11.1%), while interestingly, two cases showed both DNMT3A and IDH mutations (4.3%). Nucleotide sequencing of DNMT3A revealed missense mutations (R882H and R882C), while that of IDH revealed R172K, R140Q, R132H and R132S. Both DNMT3A and IDH mutations were observed only in adults, with a higher frequency in males. DNMT3A and IDH mutations were significantly associated with NPM1, while trends towards higher coexistence with FLT3 mutations were observed.

We examined the release of Ang-1 and Ang-2 by AML cells cultured alone and in cocultures with stromal cells. Detectable Ang-1 release from AML cells was observed for most patients (62/91), whereas Ang-2 release was detected only for a minority (23/91). Coculture of AML and stromal cells led to increased Ang-1 levels. Furthermore, the role of the angiopoietin system was investigated by characterizing whether the differences in angiopoietin expression in AML patients can be related to nucleophosmin (NPM1) mutations. We compared the gene expression profiles of AML cells derived from 19 patients with FLT3 mutations and normal cytogenetics with and without NPM1 mutations and observed increased expression of Ang-1 in patients with NPM1 mutations. Finally, we found significantly higher Ang-2 levels in serum of AML patients compared with healthy controls. Our results suggest that AML cells are a major source of Ang-1 in leukemic bone marrow, especially in patients with NPM1 mutations, but the local levels are also influenced by stromal cells. Local Ang-2 release from AML cells is less common, but high systemic levels of Ang-2 may affect bone marrow angioregulation.",

ETV6 has been reported to fuse to various partner genes, including TK and transcription factors. Both ETV6/FLT3 and reciprocal FLT3/ETV6 transcripts were detected in the patient mRNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. At the protein level, however, only ETV6/FLT3 products were expressed. Among them, one retains the helix-loop-helix (HLH) oligomerization domain of ETV6 and the JM as well as TK domain of FLT3.

Thus, it will be crucial to carefully characterize the activity of every single compound against different activating and resistance FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations. Here we tested the efficacy of sunitinib and sorafenib to inhibit primary FLT3 activating mutations (ITD and D835Y) and of secondary resistance mutations.;Ba/F3 cell lines stably expressing oncogenic FLT3 mutations were used to calculate cellular IC(50) values for sunitinib and sorafenib using cell proliferation assays.

Cell death was measured by propidium-iodide staining and flow cytometry.;Sorafenib inhibits FLT3-ITD more potent than FLT3-D835Y, while sunitinib is equally effective against both mutant forms of FLT3. Importantly, sensitivity toward sorafenib and sunitinib varies between the different secondary FLT3-ITD resistance mutations.;These results establish sensitivity profiles for the FLT3 inhibitors sunitinib and sorafenib.

Here we describe the clinical application of MiSeq, a next-generation sequencing platform to screen mutational hotspots in 54 cancer-related genes including genes relevant in acute myeloid leukemia (NRAS, KRAS, FLT3, NPM1, DNMT3A, IDH1/2, JAK2, KIT and EZH2). We sequenced 63 samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome using MiSeq and compared the results with those obtained using another next-generation sequencing platform, Ion-Torrent Personal Genome Machine and other conventional testing platforms. MiSeq detected a total of 100 single nucleotide variants and 23 NPM1 insertions that were confirmed by Ion Torrent or conventional platforms, indicating complete concordance. FLT3-internal tandem duplications (n=10) were not detected; however, re-analysis of the MiSeq output by Pindel, an indel detection algorithm, did detect them. Dilution studies of cancer cell-line DNA showed that the quantitative accuracy of mutation detection was up to an allelic frequency of 1.5% with a high level of inter- and intra-run assay reproducibility, suggesting potential utility for monitoring response to therapy, clonal heterogeneity and evolution. Examples demonstrating the advantages of MiSeq over conventional platforms for disease monitoring are provided. Easy work-flow, high throughput multiplexing capability, 4-day turnaround time and simultaneous assessment of routinely tested and emerging markers make MiSeq highly applicable for clinical molecular testing in acute myeloid leukemia.

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of two age-adjusted regimens containing AraC and cyclophosphamide applied for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML.;We retrospectively analyzed 60 patients (24 male, 36 female; median age 56 years) with relapsed or refractory AML who were treated with a combination of AraC and cyclophosphamide monocentrically between October 2000 and January 2013. Two different protocols containing either high-dose (hAC) or intermediate-dose cytarabin (iAC) have been applied dependent on age and performance status.;We demonstrate an overall response rate (CR + PR) induced by hAC and iAC of 56.7 %. Importantly, a complete remission rate (CR + CRp) of 52.2 % was found in patients who received the hAC regimen while only 8.8 % of patients achieved a CR following the iAC protocol (p < 0.001). The rate of refractory disease was 26.1 and 47.1 %, respectively. High-risk cytogenetics, i.e., a complex aberrant or monosomal karyotype had no effect on achievement of CR after hAC. In addition, there was no impact of activating FLT3 mutations on response to treatment according to the hAC regimen. In the cohort of patients treated with the iAC protocol, treatment-related mortality of 11.8 % within 60 days was observed but none of the patients who received the hAC regimen died within the first 2 months following chemotherapy. The toxicity profile was acceptable at both cytarabine dose levels. Importantly, 19 patients (82.6 %) of the hAC cohort underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as consecutive treatment.;The hAC regimen represents a promising therapeutic approach to induce a second CR in younger patients with relapsed or refractory AML prior to HSCT without using anthracyclines.",

Patients were grouped according to presence or absence of NPM1 mutations (NPM1(mut)) and FLT3 internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD). Double-negative patients were evaluated for mutations of the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α gene (CEBPα). The influence of genotypes on relapse, non-relapse mortality, leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS), and a prognostic classification combining NPM1/FLT3-ITD profile and classical risk factors were calculated. Two-year OS from HSCT was 81 ± 5% in NPM1(mut)/FLT3(wt), 75 ± 3% in NPM1(wt)/FLT3(wt), 66 ± 3% in NPM1(mut)/FLT3-ITD, and 54 ± 7% in NPM1(wt)/FLT3-ITD (P = .003). Analysis of CEBPα among patients with NPM1(wt)/FLT3(wt) revealed excellent results both in patients with CEBPα(mut) and with a triple negative genotype (2-year OS: 100%/77 ± 3%). In a Cox-model of predefined variables, age, FLT3-ITD and >1 course of chemotherapy to reach CR were risk factors associated with inferior outcome, regardless of NPM1 mutational status, variations of transplant protocols, or development of graft-versus-host disease.

In a screen of 82 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples, 45 (55%) showed activated ERK and thus were further analyzed for mutations in B-RAF and C-RAF. Two C-RAF germ-line mutations, S427G and I448V, were identified in patients with therapy-related AML in the absence of alterations in RAS and FLT3. Both exchanges were located within the kinase domain of C-RAF. In vitro and in vivo kinase assays revealed significantly increased activity for (S427G)C-RAF but not for (I448V)C-RAF. The involvement of the S427G C-RAF mutation in constitutive activation of ERK was further confirmed through demonstration of activating phosphorylations on C-RAF, MEK, and ERK in neoplastic cells, but not in nonneoplastic cells. Transformation and survival assays showed oncogenic and antiapoptotic properties for both mutations. Screening healthy individuals revealed a <1/400 frequency of these mutations and, in the case of I448V, inheritance was observed over three generations with another mutation carrier suffering from cancer. Taken together, these data are the first to relate C-RAF mutations to human malignancies. As both mutations are of germ-line origin, they might constitute a novel tumor-predisposing factor.",

Src homology-2 (SH2)-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) is a negative regulator of the JAK/STAT pathway. Transcriptional silencing of SHP-1 plays a critical role in the development and progression of cancers through STAT3 activation. 5-Azacytidine (5-Aza) is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor that causes DNA demethylation resulting in re-expression of silenced SHP-1. Lestaurtinib (CEP-701) is a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that potently inhibits FLT3 tyrosine kinase and induces hematological remission in AML patients harboring the internal tandem duplication of the FLT3 gene (FLT3-ITD). However, the majority of patients in clinical trials developed resistance to CEP-701. Therefore, the aim of this study, was to assess the effect of re-expression of SHP-1 on sensitivity to CEP-701 in resistant AML cells.;Resistant cells harboring the FLT3-ITD were developed by overexposure of MV4-11 to CEP-701, and the effects of 5-Aza treatment were investigated. Apoptosis and cytotoxicity of CEP-701 were determined using Annexin V and MTS assays, respectively. Gene expression was performed by quantitative real-time PCR. STATs activity was examined by western blotting and the methylation profile of SHP-1 was studied using MS-PCR and pyrosequencing analysis. Repeated-measures ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for statistical analysis.;The cytotoxic dose of CEP-701 on resistant cells was significantly higher in comparison with parental and MV4-11R-cep + 5-Aza cells (p = 0.004). The resistant cells showed a significant higher viability and lower apoptosis compared with other cells (p < 0.001). Expression of SHP-1 was 7-fold higher in MV4-11R-cep + 5-Aza cells compared to parental and resistant cells (p = 0.011). STAT3 was activated in resistant cells. Methylation of SHP-1 was significantly decreased in MV4-11R-cep + 5-Aza cells (p = 0.002).;The restoration of SHP-1 expression induces sensitivity towards CEP-701 and could serve as a target in the treatment of AML. Our findings support the hypothesis that, the tumor-suppressor effect of SHP-1 is lost due to epigenetic silencing and its re-expression might play an important role in re-inducing sensitivity to TKIs. Thus, SHP-1 is a plausible candidate for a role in the development of CEP-701 resistance in FLT3-ITD+ AML patients.",

Internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the FLT3 gene and partial tandem duplication of the MLL gene were found in 24% and 4%, respectively. Promoter hypermethylation of the P15, CDH1, ER and MDR1 genes was observed in 71%, 64%, 40% and 4%, respectively. Compared with normal bone marrow, the chemotherapy resistance protein MRP1 and apoptosis related genes BAX and CASPASE3 were found to be overexpressed in AML blasts. Univariate analysis revealed that the most important determinants of prognosis were presence of balanced translocations, age, white blood cell count and extramedullary disease, in order of statistical significance. In a multivariate analysis, balanced translocations retained their prognostic significance and FLT3 ITD as well as high gene expression of MDR1 were negative prognostic factors.

After accounting for age, similar findings were observed in the second study. For patients <60 years old, complete response was associated with the presence of intact apoptotic pathways. In patients > or =60 years old, nonresponse was associated with FLT3 ligand-mediated increase in phosphorylated Akt and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Results were independent of cytogenetics, FLT3 mutational status, and diagnosis of secondary AML.;These data emphasize the value of performing quantitative SCNP under modulated conditions as a basis for the development of tests highly predictive for response to induction chemotherapy.

We validated our prognostic findings in an independent set of 104 patients.;We identified at least one somatic alteration in 97.3% of the patients. We found that internal tandem duplication in FLT3 (FLT3-ITD), partial tandem duplication in MLL (MLL-PTD), and mutations in ASXL1 and PHF6 were associated with reduced overall survival (P=0.001 for FLT3-ITD, P=0.009 for MLL-PTD, P=0.05 for ASXL1, and P=0.006 for PHF6); CEBPA and IDH2 mutations were associated with improved overall survival (P=0.05 for CEBPA and P=0.01 for IDH2). The favorable effect of NPM1 mutations was restricted to patients with co-occurring NPM1 and IDH1 or IDH2 mutations. We identified genetic predictors of outcome that improved risk stratification among patients with AML, independently of age, white-cell count, induction dose, and post-remission therapy, and validated the significance of these predictors in an independent cohort. High-dose daunorubicin, as compared with standard-dose daunorubicin, improved the rate of survival among patients with DNMT3A or NPM1 mutations or MLL translocations (P=0.001) but not among patients with wild-type DNMT3A, NPM1, and MLL (P=0.67).;We found that DNMT3A and NPM1 mutations and MLL translocations predicted an improved outcome with high-dose induction chemotherapy in patients with AML.

        "Doc_abstract":"The incidence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) increases with age, and the majority of cases occur in adults aged >55 years. The prognosis of AML in older adults is generally poor; however, AML is a heterogeneous disease regardless of age, and prognosis depends on cytogenetic changes, genetic mutations, and patient characteristics. Several lines of evidence support offering treatment to the vast majority of older patients, and the survival benefit associated with this approach generally outweighs the risk of toxicity. Response and long-term survival using intensive induction regimens are significantly lower in older patients, although a small proportion of patients can achieve durable remissions. Selection of patients for intensive induction therapy requires comprehensive assessment of disease characteristics, performance status, and comorbidities. In unfit patients, options for treatment include hypomethylating agents, low-dose ara-C, or consideration of a clinical trial if available. The incorporation of novel therapies into treatment, such as FLT3 inhibitors and antibody-drug conjugates, offers significant promise in older patients, although, thus far, increased responses using novel agents have often not translated to improved survival outcomes. The development of reduced-intensity conditioning regimens and improvements in supportive care has increased the use of allogeneic stem cell transplant (ASCT) in older patients. Selection of patients for ASCT requires an estimation of the trade-off between toxicity and risk of relapse. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Continuous human leukemia-lymphoma (LL) cell lines represent a rich resource of abundant, accessible and manipulable living cells contributing significantly to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of hematopoietic tumors. In particular, classical and molecular cytogenetics have benefitted enormously from the availability of LL cell lines with specific chromosomal abnormalities. Such aberrations may be the portal to the discovery of novel oncogene rearrangements for which positive cell lines provide a resource for both discovery and functional studies. The new continuous leukemia cell line MUTZ-11 was established in 1994 from the peripheral blood of a 60-year-old woman with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) M4 (following 2 years with myelodysplastic syndromes). DNA fingerprinting confirmed the authenticity and derivation of the cell line. The immunoprofile as determined by flow cytometry was as follows: positive for myelocytic markers (CD13, CD15, CD33, CD65 and CD68), negative for T-cell (except for CD4 and CD7), B-cell and erythroid-megakaryocytic markers. The cell line is constitutively cytokine-dependent and growth depends on externally added cytokines. With regard to cytokine receptor expression, the cell line was found to be positive for GM-CSFRalpha (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor, CD116), Kit (CD117) and IL-3Ralpha (interleukin-3 receptor, CD123). The cytokine response profiles as determined by [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation assay were: 2-to-12 fold growth stimulation of MUTZ-11 by GM-CSF, IFN-alpha (interferon), IFN-beta, IFN-gamma, IL-3 and SCF (stem cell factor); growth inhibition by TGF-beta1 (transforming growth factor), TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor) and TNF-beta. Cytogenetic analysis showed the following consensus karyotype: 46, XX, der(16)t(16;17)(p13.3;q23)x2. Previous molecular biological analysis documented that MUTZ-11 cells carry both an FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) and an MLL partial tandem duplication (PTD). The scientific significance of MUTZ-11 lies (i). in the absolute cytokine-dependency and the proliferative response to various cytokines, (ii). in the unique cytogenetic (disomic t(16;17)) and (iii). molecular biological alterations (FLT3 ITD + MLL PTD). In summary, the new cytokine-dependent AML-derived cell line MUTZ-11 displays unique novel features and emphasizes the need for comprehensive analysis of new LL cell lines which may lead to the discovery of important pathogenetic alterations.",

In the current study, the authors sought to assess the value of FLT3/ITD mutation status as a prognostic genetic marker for patients with MDS.;FLT3/ITD mutation status was evaluated by performing DNA polymerase chain reaction assays on 198 bone marrow samples obtained from patients with MDS at initial diagnosis. All aberrant products were sequenced, and GeneScan analysis was performed to measure FLT3/ITD mutant levels.;Five patients (2.5%)--2 of the 99 patients who had refractory anemia with excess blasts and 3 of the 51 patients who had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia--had FLT3/ITD mutations. FLT3/ITD was not observed in any of the 48 patients who had refractory anemia (with or without ringed sideroblasts). There was no significant difference in clinicohematologic characteristics, cytogenetic characteristics, or International Prognostic Scoring System score between the FLT3/ITD-positive group and the FLT3/ITD-negative group. Four of the 5 patients carrying the FLT3/ITD mutation experienced progression of disease to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), compared with 70 of the 193 patients who did not have FLT3/ITD (P = 0.066). In addition, progression to AML was more rapid in patients with FLT3/ITD-positive disease than in patients with FLT3/ITD-negative disease (mean +/- standard error, 3.0 +/- 0.5 months vs. 62.8 +/- 5.6 months; P < 0.0001).

On multivariate analysis, FLT3/ITD was identified as an independent predictor of reduced time to development of AML (P = 0.0001) and reduced overall survival (P = 0.002).;The results of the current study demonstrate that FLT3/ITD is associated with a high risk of transformation to AML, rapid progression of AML, and poor survival in patients with MDS.",

Here, we provide evidence that transplantation of more differentiated progenitor cells can be used to more rapidly correct lymphoid deficiencies in unconditioned immunocompromised mice. Transplantation of flk2+ multipotent progenitors led to robust B and T cell reconstitution that was maintained for at least 16 weeks. Antigenic challenge at 16 weeks post-transplantation revealed that reconstituted lymphocytes maintained a functional repertoire. In contrast to the persistent lymphocytic engraftment, myeloid chimerism was lost by 12 weeks post-transplantation consistent with the fact that flk2+ progenitors are non-self-renewing. Thus, while more differentiated progenitors are capable of rescuing lymphoid deficiencies, transplantation of HSCs must be used for the correction of non-lymphoid disorders, and, we propose, very long-term immune reconstitution. Based on recent evidence, we discuss novel strategies to achieve the replacement of abnormal HSCs without the use of cytotoxic conditioning regimens.",

When expressed in MPPs, Flt3-ITD collaborated with Runx1 mutation to induce high-penetrance aggressive leukemias that were exclusively of the myeloid phenotype. Flt3-ITDs preferentially expanded MPPs with reduced lymphoid and increased myeloid transcriptional priming while compromising early B and T lymphopoiesis. Flt3-ITD-induced myeloid lineage bias involved upregulation of the transcription factor Pu.1, which is a direct target gene of Stat3, an aberrantly activated target of Flt3-ITDs, further establishing how lineage bias can be inflicted on MPPs through aberrant GFR signaling. Collectively, these findings provide new insights into how oncogenic mutations might subvert the normal process of lineage commitment and dictate the phenotype of resulting malignancies. ",

To develop a FLT3-targeted therapy, we examined tyrosine kinase inhibitors for in vitro growth suppression of the transformed 32D cells.

Interestingly, blockade of JAK2/STAT5 signaling by the specific JAK2 inhibitor AZ960 stimulated cell cycling in CD34(+) /CD38(-) cells in conjunction with downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(waf1) and sensitized these cells to the growth inhibition mediated by cytarabine and the FLT3 kinase inhibitor. Moreover, exposure of CD34(+) /CD38(-) cells to AZ960 potently induced apoptosis in parallel with downregulation of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL, as measured by Western blot analysis.

In this study, we show that an oncogenic mutant of the ubiquitin ligase casitas B-lineage lymphoma (CBL; CBLΔexon8), which is found in acute myeloid leukemia patients, predominantly cooperates with receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) class III receptors (PDGFRA, PDGFRB, KIT, and FLT3), but not with non-class III RTKs or cytokine receptors, to induce IL-3-independent growth of Ba/F3 cells. In cells coexpressing RTK class III/CBLΔexon8, receptor internalization was delayed, and cells were protected from apoptosis after cytokine withdrawal. Ligand-stimulated Ba/F3 cells and acute myeloid leukemia cell lines coexpressing the CBL deletion mutant and FLT3 showed enhanced AKT phosphorylation. Combined pharmacologic inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway and FLT3 had an additive effect on cell proliferation. The transforming potential of the CBL mutant was completely abolished by the mutation of the CBL PTB domain and was decreased by the mutation of tyrosines 589 and 591 in the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3.

        "Doc_abstract":"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a complex disease caused by deregulation of multiple signaling pathways. Mutations in class III receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) have been implicated in alteration of cell signals concerning the growth and differentiation of leukemic cells. Point mutations, insertions, or deletions of RTKs as well as chromosomal translocations induce constitutive activation of the receptor, leading to uncontrolled proliferation of undifferentiated myeloid blasts. Aberrations can occur in all domains of RTKs causing either the ligand-independent activation or mimicking the activated conformation. The World Health Organization recommended including RTK mutations in the AML classification since their detection in routine laboratory diagnostics is a major factor for prognostic stratification of patients. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods are well-validated for the detection of fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutations and can easily be applied for other RTKs. However, when methodological limitations are reached, accessory techniques can be applied. For a higher resolution and more quantitative approach compared to agarose gel electrophoresis, PCR fragments can be separated by capillary electrophoresis. Furthermore, high-resolution melting and denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography are reliable presequencing screening methods that reduce the sample amount for Sanger sequencing. Because traditional DNA sequencing is time-consuming, next-generation sequencing (NGS) is an innovative modern possibility to analyze a high amount of samples simultaneously in a short period of time. At present, standardized procedures for NGS are not established, but when this barrier is resolved, it will provide a new platform for rapid and reliable laboratory diagnostic of RTK mutations in patients with AML. In this article, the biological and physiological role of RTK mutations in AML as well as possible laboratory methods for their detection will be reviewed. ",

PTPN11 lesions rarely occur in other subtypes. Within the FAB-M5 group no clear association of PTPN11 mutations with any clinical variable was evident.

The most common FLT3 mutations in acute myeloid leukemia are internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in the juxtamembrane domain (23%) and point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (10%). The mutation substituting the aspartic acid at position 838 (equivalent to the human aspartic acid residue at position 835) with a tyrosine (referred to as FLT3/D835Y hereafter) is the most frequent kinase domain mutation, converting aspartic acid to tyrosine. Although both of these mutations constitutively activate FLT3, patients with an ITD mutation have a significantly poorer prognosis. To elucidate the mechanisms behind this prognostic difference, we have generated a knock-in mouse model with a D838Y point mutation in FLT3 that corresponds to the FLT3/D835Y mutation described in humans. Compared with FLT3/ITD knock-in mice, the FLT3/D835Y knock-in mice survive significantly longer. The majority of these mice develop myeloproliferative neoplasms with a less-aggressive phenotype. In addition, FLT3/D835Y mice have distinct hematopoietic development patterns. Unlike the tremendous depletion of the hematopoietic stem cell compartment we have observed in FLT3/ITD mice, FLT3/D835Y mutant mice are not depleted in hematopoietic stem cells. Further comparisons of these FLT3/D835Y knock-in mice with FLT3/ITD mice should provide an ideal platform for dissecting the molecular mechanisms that underlie the prognostic differences between the two different types of FLT3 mutations.

Gene expression profile analysis of the resistant and parental cells suggests that the highest ranked molecular and cellular functions of the differentially expressed genes are related to mitochondrial dysfunction. Both murine and human resistant cell lines display a longer doubling time, along with a significant inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain activity and substantial upregulation of glycolysis. The sorafenib-resistant cells exhibit increased expression of a majority of glycolytic enzymes, including hexokinase 2, which is also highly expressed in the mitochondrial fraction and is associated with resistance to apoptotic cell death. The sorafenib-resistant cells are collaterally sensitive to a number of glycolytic inhibitors including 2-deoxyglucose and 3-bromopyruvate propylester.

In older patients, diseases requiring cytotoxic treatment are more difficult and less successful to manage because comorbid conditions and poor performance status are more prevalent, decreasing the tolerance to therapy and increasing the frequency of side effects. This age effect is highlighted by the dramatically less favorable outcome in older than younger patients with acute myeloid leukemia with similar \"favorable\" cytogenetic changes. In addition, in acute and subacute myeloid leukemia in older patients, the disease is intrinsically more resistant to therapy. Overexpression of drug resistance genes and unfavorable genetic mutations are more prevalent in older patients and provide evidence that acute myeloid leukemia is often qualitatively different in these patients. The gradient of age effects is continuous; the frequency of poor outcome increasing by decade (or less). The decline in survival becomes especially steep as quinquagenarians (50-year-olds) age to nonagenarians (90-year-olds). Although improved drug schedules have led to significant improvements in event-free survival in younger patients, these improvements have been far less evident in older patients.

This model has significant implications for the development of novel therapies, but its clinical relevance has yet to be determined.;To identify an LSC gene expression signature and test its association with clinical outcomes in AML.;Retrospective study of global gene expression (microarray) profiles of LSC-enriched subpopulations from primary AML and normal patient samples, which were obtained at a US medical center between April 2005 and July 2007, and validation data sets of global transcriptional profiles of AML tumors from 4 independent cohorts (n = 1047).;Identification of genes discriminating LSC-enriched populations from other subpopulations in AML tumors; and association of LSC-specific genes with overall, event-free, and relapse-free survival and with therapeutic response.;Expression levels of 52 genes distinguished LSC-enriched populations from other subpopulations in cell-sorted AML samples. An LSC score summarizing expression of these genes in bulk primary AML tumor samples was associated with clinical outcomes in the 4 independent patient cohorts. High LSC scores were associated with worse overall, event-free, and relapse-free survival among patients with either normal karyotypes or chromosomal abnormalities. For the largest cohort of patients with normal karyotypes (n = 163), the LSC score was significantly associated with overall survival as a continuous variable (hazard ratio [HR], 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.22; log-likelihood P <.001).

In another cohort with available data on event-free survival for 70 patients with normal karyotypes, the risk of an event by 3 years was 48% (95% CI, 27%-63%) in the low LSC score group vs 81% (95% CI, 60%-91%) in the high LSC score group (HR, 2.4 [95% CI, 1.3-4.5]; log-rank P = .006).

A significant proliferative response to MGDF alone (proliferation index > 1.5) was observed in nine of 23 cases; the responding cases belonged to all FAB subtypes. However, the greatest response (proliferation index > 7) was found in one M6 and in one M7 case. MGDF also enhanced interleukin 3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), c-kit ligand (KL) and FLT3 ligand (FL) stimulated blast cell proliferation. MGDF as a single factor induced or significantly enhanced colony formation by clonogenic precursor cells in 12 of 14 AML cases. MGDF strongly increased KL-induced leukemic colony growth in seven cases, whereas it only moderately enhanced IL-3- or GM-CSF-induced colony growth. The analysis of tyrosine phosphorylated protein(s) upon MGDF stimulation in fresh AML cells was also performed. The results demonstrated a band of approximately 90 kDa phosphorylated protein(s) upon MGDF stimulation in AML responsive cases, but not in unresponsive ones. Taken together the present findings suggest that, in a consistent proportion of AML cases, MGDF stimulates blast cell growth and induces tyrosine protein phosphorylation.",

We previously showed that MYB was a direct activator of FLT3 expression within the context of acute myeloid leukaemia. During normal haematopoiesis, increasing levels of FLT3 expression determine a strict hierarchy within the haematopoietic stem and early progenitor compartment, which associates with lymphoid and myeloid commitment potential. We use the conditional deletion of the Myb gene to investigate the influence of MYB in Flt3 transcriptional regulation within the haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) hierarchy. In accordance with previous report, in vivo deletion of Myb resulted in rapid biased differentiation of HSC with concomitant loss of proliferation capacity. We find that loss of MYB activity also coincided with decreased FLT3 expression. At the chromatin level, the Flt3 promoter is primed in immature HSC, but occupancy of further intronic elements determines expression. Binding to these locations, MYB and C/EBPα need functional cooperation to activate transcription of the locus. This cooperation is cell context dependent and indicates that MYB and C/EBPα activities are inter-dependent in controlling Flt3 expression to influence lineage commitment of multipotential progenitors.

Aberrant PTK activity resulting from gene mutation (often accompanying chromosome translocation) or overexpression of these enzymes plays an etiologic role in several clonal hematopoietic malignancies. Other than the causative effect of PTK product of the bcr/abl fusion gene on chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), more evidence suggests that mutated tyrosine kinases are pivotal in the pathogenesis of most of other chronic myeloproliferative disorders, such as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). And the exciting results in several dependent groups in 2005 showed that a single nucleotide JAK2 somatic mutation (JAK2V617F mutation) was found to be involved in the pathogenesis of polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (CIMF). In the leukogenesis of acute myeloid leukemias (AML), the losing of the control of the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells was principally the results of the aberrant PTK activity, such as FLT3 and C-kit overexpression. It works together with the loss of function mutation genes in promoting progenitor cell differentiation to confer AML's phenotypes.

FLT3-ITD receptors exhibit constitutive tyrosine kinase activity in the absence of FLT3 ligand (FL) binding, and when expressed in cytokine-dependent cell lines and primary hematopoietic cells suppress programmed cell death and increase cell division. However, the signaling pathways important for transformation, in particular the nuclear targets, are unknown. Here we demonstrate that FLT3-ITD expression in Ba/F3 cells results in activation of Akt and concomitant phosphorylation of the Forkhead family member Foxo3a. Phosphorylation of Foxo proteins through FLT3-ITD signaling promotes their translocation from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, which requires the presence of conserved Akt phosphorylation sites in Forkhead transcription factors and PI3K activity. Induction of Foxo3a phosphorylation by FLT3-ITD receptors in Ba/F3 cells correlates with the suppression of Foxo-target genes p27Kip1 and the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bim. Specifically, FLT3-ITD expression prevents Foxo3a-mediated apoptosis and upregulation of p27Kip1 and Bim gene expression. These data indicate that the oncogenic tyrosine kinase FLT3 can negatively regulate Foxo transcription factors, thereby promoting cell survival and proliferation.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of suppression of FLT3 induced by small hairpin interfering RNA (shRNA) on myeloproliferation and apoptosis in an acute monocytic leukemia (AMOL) cell line THP-1.;FLT3-targeted small hairpin interfering RNA (FLT3-shRNA) was designed and synthesized by transcription system in vitro was transfected into THP-1 cells. Firstly FLT3 mRNA level was detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and FLT3 protein level was detected by flow cytometry (FCM) to verify the efficacy on FLT3-shRNA interference at 48 h after transfection. Cell growth viability was measured at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h after treatment with CCK-8. The distribution of cell cycle was assayed by FCM, and apoptosis was analyzed by DNA Ladder and Annexin V-FITC Staining at 48 h.;FLT3 targeted shRNAs was synthesized successfully and the concentration of 15 nmol/L for 48 h could obtain desirable downregulation of FLT3 expression, the inhibitory percentages of FLT3 mRNA and protein were (72.95 +/- 2.07)% and (65.39 +/- 5.57)%, respectively. The suppression of FLT3 induced by FLT3-shRNA resulted in marked inhibition of cell growth and the inhibitory percentages were (36.66 +/- 3.67)% at 48 h, (35.56 +/- 0.73)% at 72 h. FLT3-shRNA induced the inhibition of cell cycle from G(0)/G(1) phase to S phase, the percentage of sub-G(0)/G(1) phase (65.71 +/- 4.47)% was higher than those in the PBS-control group (52.23 +/- 2.98)%, NC-shRNA control group (51.81 +/- 1.44)%, P < 0.01; the percentage of S phase (25.11 +/- 2.70)% was lower than those in the PBS-control group (34.41 +/- 4.07)% and NC-shRNA control group (32.50 +/- 1.46)%, P < 0.05. Furthermore treatment with FLT3-shRNA for 48 h resulted in clear apoptosis ladder, the percentage of early apoptosis detected by Annexin V-FITC was (18.59 +/- 2.07)% which was significantly higher than that in the PBS-control group (4.00 +/- 0.50)% and the NC-shRNA control group (6.06 +/- 0.70)%, P < 0.001.;The suppression of FLT3 induced by the shRNA can effectively inhibit cell proliferation, and apoptosis induction on THP-1 cells, which indicates that this approach may bear the therapeutic potential on childhood AMOL.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Knowledge of the molecular events that govern human thyroid tumorigenesis has grown considerably in the past ten years. Key genetic alterations and new oncogenic pathways have been identified. Molecular genetic aberrations in thyroid carcinomas bear noteworthy resemblance to those in acute myelogenous leukemias. Thyroid carcinomas and myeloid leukemias both possess transcription factor gene rearrangements-PPARgamma-related translocations in thyroid carcinoma and RARalpha-related and CBF-related translocations (amongst others) in myeloid leukemia. PPARgamma and RARalpha are closely related members ofthe same nuclear receptor subfamily, and the PML-RARalpha and PAX8-PPARgamma fusion proteins both function as dominant negative inhibitors of their wild-type parent proteins. Thyroid carcinomas and myeloid leukemias also both harbor NRAS mutations (15-25% of both cancers) and receptor tyrosine kinase mutations--RET mutations in thyroid carcinomas and FLT3 mutations in myeloid leukemias. The NRAS and tyrosine receptor kinase mutations are not observed in the same thyroid carcinoma or leukemia patients, suggesting that multiple initiating pathways exist in both. Lastly, thyroid carcinomas and myeloid leukemias possess p53 mutations at relatively low frequency (10-15%) in patients who tend to be older and have more aggressive, therapy resistant disease. Such parallels are unlikely to occur by chance alone and argue that common mechanisms underlie these diverse epithelial and hematologic cancers. The comparison of thyroid carcinomas and myeloid leukemias may highlight areas of thyroid cancer investigation worthy of further focus. For example, few collaborating mutations have been defined in thyroid carcinomas even though they play a clear role in myeloid leukemias, as exemplified by RARalpha rearrangements and FLT3 mutations that together dictate the promyleocytic leukemia phenotype. Functional interactions between collaborating mutations are possible at multiple levels, and it is tempting to speculate that some thyroid carcinomas might develop through an unique combination or co-activation of RET and RAS and/or RET and PPARgamma (and/or other) signaling systems. In fact, the ELE1-RET (PTC3) fusion protein contains the ELE1 nuclear receptor co-activator domain and it appears to physically associate with and inhibit wild-type PPARgamma in some papillary carcinomas. The similarities of the fusion proteins in thyroid carcinoma and myeloid leukemia suggest that a more directed search for fusion genes in non-thyroid carcinomas is warranted. In fact, novel fusion genes have been identified recently in aggressive midline, secretory breast, and renal cell carcinomas, although the epithelial nature of the latter is not well-documented. Interestingly, these cancers all tend to present more frequently in adolescence and young adulthood in a manner similar to thyroid and myeloid malignancies that have fusion genes. The analyses of cancers that present earlier in life may enhance fusion gene recognition in other carcinoma types. Definition and biologic characterization of the precursor cells that give rise to thyroid carcinoma will also be important. Myeloid leukemias are thought to arise from stem/progenitor cells that acquire disturbed self-renewal and differentiation capacities but retain characteristics of the myeloid lineages. Although the presence of comparable stem/progenitor cells in the thyroid are not defined, distinct thyroid cancer lineages and patterns of differentiation exist and candidate stem/progenitor cells such as the p63-immunoreactive solid cell nests are apparent. A last important area is development of molecular-based therapies for thyroid carcinoma patients resistant to standard radio-iodine treatment. Treatments for such cancers are limited and pathways defined by thyroid cancer mutations are prime targets for pharmacologic interventions with molecular inhibitors. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors and nuclear receptor ligands have proven dramatically effective in some myeloid leukemia patients. Various molecular inhibitors are being investigated now in thyroid cancer models. Such developments predict that the thyroid cancer model will continue to provide biologic insights into human carcinoma biology and that improved pathologic diagnosis and treatment for thyroid cancer patients sit on the not too distant horizon."},

        "Doc_abstract":"Acute myeloid leukemia with t(8;21)(q22;q22) is a distinct type of leukemia considered to have a favorable prognosis. However, some patients rapidly succumb to disease despite chemotherapy. We studied 56 patients with acute myeloid leukemia associated with t(8;21) and correlated clinicopathologic, cytogenetic and molecular findings with outcome to identify markers of prognosis. In a subset of patients, we also assessed the status of the c-KIT, FLT3 and RAS genes. There were 31 men and 25 women, with a median age of 38 years (range 4-76). The follow-up period ranged from 17 to 104 months (median 52). At the last follow-up, 29 patients had died, 25 patients were in complete remission and two patients were alive with disease. The median survial was 38 months. The 5-year overall survival rate of newly diagnosed patients was 56%. Most patients (39/56, 70%) had chromosomal aberrations in addition to t(8;21), with loss of a sex chromosome (39%) being most common followed by del(9q)(q21-22) (11%) and trisomy 8 (7%). These aberrations, however, did not predict survival. C-KIT (D816V or D816Y), FLT3 (ITD or D835) and RAS mutations were detected in 26, 10 and 7%, respectively, of cases assessed. The 5-year overall survival rate of patients with mutated leukemia was 20%. No mutations were observed in three patients who died within 7 months of diagnosis. Leukocytosis or CD56 expression did not correlate with a poor survival nor did the levels of CD19 expression predict c-KIT mutation status.

The ligand for FLT3, FL, is active in both soluble and membrane-bound forms. We examined expression of FL and FLT3 mRNA in a panel of some 110 continuous human leukemia-lymphoma cell lines from all major hematopoietic cell lineages by Northern blot analysis. FLT3 mRNA is expressed primarily in pre-B cell lines, myeloid and monocytic cell lines whereas FL mRNA was detected in most cell lines from all cell lineages. Analysis of FLT3 receptor protein expression examined with a specific anti-FLT3 monoclonal antibody and flow cytometry in 17 cell lines confirmed the results obtained at the mRNA level.

        "Doc_abstract":"FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitors have shown activity in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Secondary mutations in target kinases can cause clinical resistance to therapeutic kinase inhibition. We have previously shown that sensitivity toward tyrosine kinase inhibitors varies between different activating FLT3 mutations. We therefore intended to determine whether different FLT3 inhibitors would produce distinct profiles of secondary, FLT3 resistance mutations. Using a cell-based screening approach, we generated FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD)-expressing cell lines resistant to the FLT3 inhibitors SU5614, PKC412, and sorafenib. Interestingly, the profile of resistance mutations emerging with SU5614 was limited to exchanges in the second part of the kinase domain (TK2) with exchanges of D835 predominating. In contrast, PKC412 exclusively produced mutations within tyrosine kinase domain 1 (TK1) at position N676. A mutation at N676 recently has been reported in a case of PKC412-resistant AML. TK1 mutations exhibited a differential response to SU5614, sorafenib, and sunitinib but strongly impaired response to PKC412. TK2 exchanges identified with SU5614 were sensitive to PKC412, sunitinib, or sorafenib, with the exception of Y842D, which caused a strong resistance to sorafenib. Of note, sorafenib also produced a highly distinct profile of resistance mutations with no overlap to SU5614 or PKC412, including F691L in TK1 and exchanges at position Y842 of TK2. Thus, different FLT3 kinase inhibitors generate distinct, nonoverlapping resistance profiles. This is in contrast to Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors such as imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib, which display overlapping resistance profiles. Therefore, combinations of FLT3 inhibitors may be useful to prevent FLT3 resistance mutations in the setting of FLT3-ITD-positive AML.",

We examined whether mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathway could be the genetic events that cause acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) harboring t(8;21). Mutations in the second tyrosine kinase domain, juxtamembrane (JM) domain and exon 8 of the C-KIT gene were observed in 10, one and three of 37 AML patients with t(8;21), respectively. Three patients showed an internal tandem duplication in the JM domain of the FLT3 gene. One patient had a mutation in the K-Ras gene at codon 12. As the occurrence of these mutations was mutually exclusive, a total of 18 (49%) patients showed mutations in the RTK pathway. These results suggest that activating mutations in the RTK pathway play a role in part as an additional event leading to the development of t(8;21) AML. The 6-year cumulative incidence of relapse in patients with RTK pathway mutations was 79.8%, compared with 13.5% in patients lacking such mutations (P=0.0029). Furthermore, the 6-year relapse-free survival in patients with mutations was 18% compared to 60% in those without mutations (P=0.0340), indicating that RTK mutations are associated with the clinical outcome in t(8;21) AML.",

FLT3, NPM1, CEBPA, c-kit and WT1 mutations were also included in analysis. The results showed that IDH2 mutation was found in 14 (7.29%) of 192 patients. There were 9 AML patients with R140Q mutation, 1 patient with R140W mutation, and 1 patient with R172K mutation. IDH2 aberrations significantly more were detected in French-American-British (FAB) M5 (P < 0.005) than other types. There was no statistical difference in age, sex, WBC, platelet count, bone marrow blasts count, hemoglobin as compared with IDH2 wild-type. For immunotype analysis, IDH2 mutation patients were more likely to express CD34 and CD13, less CD36. IDH2 mutation combined with FLT3/ITD mutation was found in 7 cases, with CEBPA mutation in 4 cases, with NPM1 mutation in 4 cases, with Dnmt3a mutation in 5 cases, neither with c-kit, IDH1 or WT1 mutation for no one, which revealed a significant interaction between IDH2 mutation and the FLT3/ITD positive genotype, Dnmt3a mutated, and IDH1 wild-type. IDH2 mutation was detected in 5 (8.47%) of 59 CN-AML. There was no significant difference of IDH2 mutation incidence between the normal and abnormal karyotype. The CR rate was higher in IDH2 R140 mutated patients than wild-type ones, but there was no significant in the two group. It is concluded that the rate of IDH2 mutation is 7.29% in Chinese AML patients and 7.81% in CN-AML. IDH2 mutation is significantly associated with AML-M5, FLT3/ITD, Dnmt3a, IDH1 wild-type and fusion gene wild-type, but not with age, leucocyte and platelet counts in peripheral blood, karyotype, NPM1, CEBPA, c-kit or WT1 mutation.

As there was considerable heterogeneity in LSPC response to Mylotarg treatment, various factors potentially underpinning the differential response were assessed. LSPC that overexpressed CD33 (P=0.01), which were P-glycoprotein-negative (P=0.008) and with internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the FLT3 gene (FLT3/ITD) status (P=0.006) responded better to Mylotarg treatment.

In multivariate analysis, LSPC burden and FLT3 status were found to be predictors of LSPC chemosensitivity to Mylotarg treatment (P<0.0001).

Thus, when CEBPA mutations were considered, ID1 expression lost its prognostic impact. Likewise, the negative impact of ID1(high) status on relapse-free survival (RFS) was lost when CEBPA mutations were included in the analysis.

        "Doc_abstract":"Inhibition of the mutated fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) receptor tyrosine kinase is a promising therapeutic strategy in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). However, development of resistance to FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), such as PKC412A, has been described recently. This observation may have an increasing impact on the duration of response and relapse rates in upcoming clinical trials employing FLT3-TKI. Herein we investigated two representatives of a novel class of FLT3-TKI: Bis(1H-indol-2-yl)methanones. Both compounds effectively induced apoptosis in FLT3-internal tandem duplicate (ITD)-transfected murine myeloid cells and in primary FLT3-ITD positive blasts. Combination of both compounds with chemotherapy revealed synergistic effects in apoptosis assays. The compounds did not show significant toxicity in human bone marrow cells derived from healthy donors. Compound102 overcame resistance to PKC412 within a non-myelotoxic dose-range. Western Blotting experiments of 32D-FLT3-ITD cells showed dose-dependent dephosphorylation of FLT3-ITD and of its downstream targets STAT5, AKT and ERK upon incubation with either compound. In conclusion, bis(1H-indol-2-yl)methanones overcome resistance mediated by FLT3-ITD mutations at position N676 and show strong efficacy in FLT3-ITD-positive cells alone as well as in combination with chemotherapy. We propose that further development of methanone compounds overcoming resistance to currently established FLT3-TKIs is an important step forward to an anticipated need within our future therapeutic algorithm in FLT3-ITD-positive AML.",

Genes TP53, RUNX1, CBL, IDH1/2, NRAS, NPM1, and FLT3 were analyzed for mutations in all patients. We identified 36 recurrent cytogenetic aberrations (more than five events). Mutations in TP53, 9pUPD, and del7q (targeting CUX1 locus) were significantly associated with sAML, while NPM1 and FLT3 mutations associated with dnAML. Patients with sAML carrying TP53 mutations demonstrated lower 1-year OS rate than those with wild-type TP53 (14.3% ± 9.4% vs. 35.4% ± 7.2%; P = 0.002), while complex karyotype, del7q (CUX1) and del7p (IKZF1) showed no significant effect on OS. Multivariate analysis confirmed that mutant TP53 was the only independent adverse prognostic factor for OS in sAML (hazard ratio 2.67; 95% CI: 1.33-5.37; P = 0.006). Patients with dnAML and complex karyotype carried sAML-associated defects (TP53 defects in 54.5%, deletions targeting FOXP1 and ETV6 loci in 45.4% of the cases). We identified several co-occurring lesions associated with either sAML or dnAML diagnosis. Our data suggest that distinct genetic lesions drive leukemogenesis in sAML. High karyotype complexity of sAML patients does not influence OS. Somatic mutations in TP53 are the only independent adverse prognostic factor in sAML.

The detection rate of NPM1 mutations in 220 AML patients was 16.4%, including 107 (14.2%) with the French-American-British (FAB) subtype M2, 43 (2.3%) with M3, and 52 (30.8%) with M4/M5. Only one case each with an NPM1 mutation was detected in four M0, seven M1, five M6, and two M7 cases. Eight patients were followed up after treatment, and five patients in hematologic remission continued to test negative for NPM1 mutations within 2-14 months of follow-up. Sequence analysis revealed that all the 36 positive cases were heterozygous for the mutation with 4-bp insertions at nt 959; the 36 cases included 29 (80.6%) cases with type A, four (11.1%) cases with type B, and one rare DD-3 mutation. We also detected two new mutations, namely, CTCG and CAAG insertions, named BJ-01 and BJ-02, respectively. Further, 38.9% (14/36) patients with NPM1 mutations simultaneously exhibited internal tandem duplications in the FLT3 gene, and 66.7% (22/33) patients did not express CD34.

We analyzed the prevalence and the potential prognostic impact of FLT3 mutations in 979 AML patients. Results were correlated with cytogenetic data and the clinical response. FLT3-ITD mutations were found in 20.4% and FLT3-TKD mutations in 7.7% of the patients. Each mutation was associated with similar clinical characteristics and was more prevalent in patients with normal karyotype. Significantly more FLT3 aberrations were found in patients with FAB M5, and fewer were found in patients with FAB M2 and M6. Although less frequent in patients with cytogenetic aberrations, FLT3-ITDs were found in 13 of 42 patients with t(15;17) and in 9 of 10 patients with t(6;9). The prevalence of the ITD allele on the DNA level was heterogeneous, ranging from faint mutant bands in some patients to predominant mutant bands in others. Based on quantitative analysis, the mutant-wild-type (wt) ratio ranged from 0.03 to 32.56 (median, 0.78). Patients with a high mutant/wt ratio (ie, greater than 0.78) had significantly shorter overall and disease-free survival, whereas survival in patients with ratios below 0.78 did not differ from those without FLT3 aberrations. Multivariate analysis confirmed a high mutant/wt ratio to be a strong independent prognostic factor. Taken together, these data confirm that FLT mutations represent a common alteration in adult AML. Constitutive activation may be associated with monocytoid differentiation. A high mutant/wt ratio in ITD-positive patients appears to have a major impact on the prognostic relevance.",

        "Doc_abstract":"FLT3 is a member of the type III receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family. These receptors all contain an intrinsic tyrosine kinase domain that is critical to signaling. Aberrant expression of the FLT3 gene has been documented in both adult and childhood leukemias including AML, ALL and CML. In addition, 17-27% of pediatric and adult patients with AML have small internal tandem duplication mutations in FLT3. Patients expressing the mutant form of the receptor have been shown to have a decreased chance for cure. Our previous study, using a constitutively activated FLT3, demonstrated transformation of Ba/F3 cells and leukemic development in an animal model. Thus, there is accumulating evidence for a role for FLT3 in human leukemias. This has prompted us to search for inhibitors of FLT3 as a possible therapeutic approach in these patients. AG1296 is a compound of the tyrphostin class that is known to selectively inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of the PDGF and KIT receptors. Since FLT3 is a close relative of KIT, we wanted to test the possible inhibitory activity of AG1296 on FLT3. In transfected Ba/F3 cells, AG1296 selectively and potently inhibited autophosphorylation of FL-stimulated wild-type and constitutively activated FLT3. Treatment by AG1296 abolished IL-3-independent proliferation of Ba/F3 cells expressing the constitutively activated FLT3 and thus, reversed the transformation mediated by activated FLT3. Inhibition of FLT3 activity by AG1296 in cells transformed by activated FLT3 resulted in apoptotic cell death, with no deleterious effect on their parental counterparts. Addition of IL-3 rescued the growth of cells expressing activated FLT3 in the presence of AG1296. This demonstrates that the inhibition is specific to the FLT3 pathway in that it leaves the kinases of the IL-3 pathway and other kinases further downstream involved in proliferation intact. Several proteins phosphorylated by the activated FLT3 signaling pathway, including STAT 5A, STAT 5B and CBL, were no longer phosphorylated when these cells were treated with AG1296. The activity against FLT3 suggests a potential therapeutic application for AG1296 or similar drugs in the treatment of leukemias involving deregulated FLT3 tyrosine kinase activity and as a tool for studying the biology of FLT3.",

In the current study, we sought to determine the feasibility of utilization of HRMA for the detection of larger sequence aberrations, using internal tandem duplications (ITD) in the juxtamembrane domain of the FLT3 gene as a model system. This gene is important in the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors and ITDs in this gene have been identified in a subset of poor-prognosis acute myelogenous leukemias (AML). DNA extracted from 62 AML samples was analyzed on a prototype high-resolution melting instrument. The samples interrogated for the FLT3 ITDs were subjected to post-amplification denaturation with frequent and regular fluorescence acquisition. The fluorescence versus temperature melting graphs generated were analyzed for deviation from the profiles reproducibly obtained for the wild-type samples. Results by HRMA were compared to results obtained using capillary electrophoresis-based fragment analysis, temperature gradient capillary electrophoresis detection, and sequencing of ITDs. FLT3 ITDs were detected in 13 of 62 AML samples with 100% concordance between the detection methods.

        "Doc_abstract":"The class III receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3/FLK2 (FLT3; CD135) represents an important molecule involved in early steps of hematopoiesis. Here we compare cell-surface expression of FLT3 on bone marrow (BM) and cord blood (CB) cells using monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) specific for the extracellular domain of human FLT3. Flow cytometric analysis of MACS-purified BM and CB cells showed that 63% to 82% of BM CD34+ and 88% to 95% of the CB CD34+ cells coexpress FLT3. Clonogenic assays and morphological characterization of FACS-sorted BM CD34+ cells demonstrate that colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) and immature myelo-monocytic precursor cells are enriched in the subpopulation staining most brightly with the FLT3 MoAb whereas the majority of the burst-forming units-erythroid (BTU-E) and small cells with lymphoid morphology are found in the FLT3- population. In contrast, statistically indistinguishable proportions of CFU-granulocyte-erythrocyte-megakaryocyte-macrophage (CFU-GEMM) and more primitive cobblestone area forming cells (CAFC) were detected in both fractions, albeit the FLT3+ fraction consistently showed more CAFC activity than the FLT3- fraction. Although in both, BM and CB the majority of CD34+CD117+ (KIT+), CD34+CD90+ (Thy-1+), and CD34+CD109+ cells coexpress FLT3, three-color phenotypic analyses are consistent with the functional findings and suggest that the most primitive cells defined as CD34+CD38-, CD34+CD71low, CD34+HLA-DR-, CD34+CD117low, CD34+CD90+, and CD34+CD109+ express low levels of cell-surface FLT3 and were therefore not enriched to a statistically significant extent with the bright versus negative sorting scheme. Thus, clear segregation of the most primitive progenitors from BM CD34+ cells was confounded by low apparent levels of FLT3 cell-surface expression on these cells, whereas myeloid progenitors unambiguously segregated with the FLT3 brightest cells and erythroid progenitors with the FLT3 dimmest. Additional phenotypic analyses using MoAbs against progenitor/stem cell markers including the mucinlike molecule MGC-24v (CD164), the receptor tyrosine kinases TIE, FMS (CD115), and KIT (CD117) further illustrate the differences in surface antigen expression profiles of BM and CB CD34+ cells. Notably, CD115 is rarely detected on CB CD34+ cells, whereas 20% to 25% of the BM CD34+FLT3+ cells are CD115+. Furthermore, 80% to 95% of the CB CD34+CD117+ but only 60% to 75% of the BM CD34+CD117+ cells coexpress FLT3. Only a negligible amount of CD34+CD19+ are detected in CB, while in BM 20% to 30% of CD34+CD19+ presumed pro/pre-B cells coexpress FLT3. In contrast, the majority of the CD34+CD164+ and CD34+TIE+ subsets in both CB and BM coexpress FLT3. Analysis of unseparated cells showed that FLT3 expression is not restricted to CD34+ subsets. About 65% to 70% of lymphocyte-gated BM CD34-FLT3+ cells are positive for the monocytic marker CD115 whereas 25% to 30% of these cells consist of CD10 expressing B-cell precursors. Finally, CD34- monocytes in BM, CB, and PB express FLT3 whereas granulocytes are FLT3-. Our data show that detectable FLT3 appears first at low levels on the surface of primitive multilineage progenitor cells and disappears during defined stages of B-cell development, but is upregulated and maintained during monocytic maturation.",

In acute myeloid leukemia cells carrying the FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation, we observed high rates of FLT3-ITD-dependent CHK1 Ser 280 phosphorylation. Pharmacological inhibition and RNA interference identified Pim1/2, not Akt, as effectors of this phosphorylation. Pim1 catalyzed Ser 280 phosphorylation in vitro and ectopic expression of Pim1/2-induced CHK1 phosphorylation. Ser 280 phosphorylation did not modify CHK1 localization, but facilitated its cell cycle and resistance functions in leukemic cells. FLT3, PIM or CHK1 inhibitors synergized with DNA-damaging agents to induce apoptosis, allowing cells to bypass the etoposide-induced G2/M arrest. Consistently, etoposide-induced CHK1-dependent phosphorylations of CDC25C on Ser 216 and histone H3 on Thr11 were decreased upon FLT3 inhibition. Accordingly, ectopic expression of CHK1 improved the resistance of FLT3-ITD cells and maintained histone H3 phosphorylation in response to DNA damage, whereas expression of unphosphorylated Ser 280Ala mutant did not. Finally, FLT3- and Pim-dependent phosphorylation of CHK1 on Ser 280 was confirmed in primary blasts from patients. These results identify a new pathway involved in the resistance of FLT3-ITD leukemic cells to genotoxic agents, and they constitute the first report of CHK1 Ser 280 regulation in myeloid malignancies.

Acute leukemia has poor prognosis, mainly due to relapse. Standard FLT3-ITD diagnostic techniques are based on genomic polymerase chain reaction and have recently incorporated GeneScan (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) to identify variations of the FLT3 gene. As this is an average-based assay utilized in a heterogeneous leukemic cell population, we hypothesized that cells of acute leukemia, considered FLT3-ITD-negative by standard methods, could possess a fraction of FLT3-ITD-positive cells. The present study employed single cell mutation analysis to evaluate the FLT3-ITD status in newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (n = 5) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (n = 3) patients. A total of 541 single leukemic cells and 36 mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers were analyzed. Seven patients, considered FLT3-ITD-negative according to bulk DNA analysis, appeared to possess a small fraction of FLT3-ITD-positive cells based on single cell analysis. Moreover, this approach revealed the heterogeneity of the tumor as evident by different FLT3-ITD mutations present in the same patient. The presence of a minor clone carrying FLT3-ITD in almost all patients tested provides evidence that this lesion is a common late event in leukemogenesis. Additionally, 3 relapsed patients demonstrated loss of heterozygosity of the normal allele, affecting 25%-100% of the cells found to be FLT3-ITD-positive.

However, in the thymus a major subset of DCs expressing CD8α and langerin (CD207) appears to stand apart from all other DCs in that it is thought to derive from progenitors with lymphoid potential. Using mice expressing a fluorescent reporter and a diphtheria toxin receptor under the control of the cd207 gene, we demonstrated that CD207(+) CD8α(+) thymic DCs do not share a common origin with T cells but originate from intrathymic precursors that express markers that are normally present on all (CD11c(+) and MHCII molecules) or on some (CD207, CD135, CD8α, CX3CR1) DC subsets. Those intrathymic myeloid-type precursors correspond to CD44(+) CD25(-) double-negative 1c (DN1c) cells and are continuously renewed from bone marrow-derived canonical DC precursors. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the earliest intrathymic precursors of CD8α(+) thymic DCs correspond to myeloid-type DN1c cells and support the view that under physiological conditions myeloid-restricted progenitors generate the whole constellation of DCs present in the body including the thymus.",

FLT3 is expressed at high levels in 70-100% of cases of AML and in virtually all cases of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia. FLT3 is regarded as a molecular target in the development of novel therapies for acute leukemia patients. Currently, many small-molecule FLT3 inhibitors have been developed, but clinical trials have resulted in limited antileukemia effects because of off-target toxicities and drug resistance. The development of anti-FLT3 Abs might overcome these difficulties and enhance the antileukemia efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors. In the present study, we demonstrate the isolation of novel human mAbs against FLT3 with antagonistic or agonistic activities. An antagonistic Ab, designated A2, continuously inhibits FLT3 ligand (FL)-induced phosphorylation of FLT3 and MAPK. A2 cooperatively induces apoptosis with daunorubicin, even in the presence of FL. An agonistic Ab, designated 3E6, surprisingly induces the phosphorylation of FLT3 and MAPK, and supports the growth of a factor-dependent cell line independently of FL addition. In addition, A2 showed complement-dependent cytotoxicity activity, but was devoid of Ab-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. Finally, we evaluated Ab internalization in a cell line. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry analyses revealed that A2 is efficiently internalized. Collectively, these data demonstrate that A2 is a potent human Ab that might be capable of delivering cytotoxic reagents and that has antagonistic effects on FLT3 signaling. In addition, 3E6 might be a potential scaffold for novel dendritic cell-based immunotherapies.",

FLT3-ITD expressing cell lines have been shown to generate increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). However, the molecular basis of how FLT3-ITD-driven ROS leads to the aggressive form of AML is not clearly understood. Our group has previously reported that inhibition of FLT3-ITD signaling results in post-translational down-regulation of p22(phox), a small membrane-bound subunit of the NADPH oxidase (NOX) complex. Here we demonstrated that 32D cells, a myeloblast-like cell line transfected with FLT3-ITD, have a higher protein level of p22(phox) and p22(phox)-interacting NOX isoforms than 32D cells transfected with the wild type FLT3 receptor (FLT3-WT). The inhibition of NOX proteins, p22(phox), and NOX protein knockdowns caused a reduction in ROS, as measured with a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-specific dye, peroxy orange 1 (PO1), and nuclear H2O2, as measured with nuclear peroxy emerald 1 (NucPE1). These reductions in the level of H2O2 following the NOX knockdowns were accompanied by a decrease in the number of DNA DSBs. We showed that 32D cells that express FLT3-ITD have a higher level of both oxidized DNA and DNA DSBs than their wild type counterparts. We also observed that NOX4 and p22(phox) localize to the nuclear membrane in MV4-11 cells expressing FLT3-ITD. Taken together these data indicate that NOX and p22(phox) mediate the ROS production from FLT3-ITD that signal to the nucleus causing genomic instability. ",

In this study we compared 18 samples with FIt3/ITDs and 63 AML samples without these mutations with respect to clinical prognosis, cytokine responsiveness, progenitor cell content and repopulation in the NOD/SCID mouse. We found that in patients with a mutation CR rates are reduced (P=0.03) and relapse rates are increased (P=0.01), indicating the prognostic importance of FIt3/ITDs. This is also emphasized by the finding that in patients under the age of 60 years, as well as in older patients the event-free survival was more unfavorable for the mutant patients (P=0.003 and P=0.03, respectively). At diagnosis FIt3/ITD and non-mutant AML bone marrow samples did not differ in their progenitor/stem cell frequencies. Cobblestone area forming cell (CAFC) subsets showed a similar frequency distribution in mutant and non-mutant samples. In 7-day liquid cultures, FIt3/ITD samples showed a reduced growth in response to a variety of myeloid growth factors. In contrast, FIt3/ITD samples displayed a higher ability to engraft the NOD/SCID bone marrow with leukemic cells. Together these data show that the FIt3/ITD represents an important diagnostic marker for patient prognosis, and that the presence of these mutations is associated with altered proliferative ability of progenitors in vivo and in vitro.",

Herein, we report a case of de novo acute monocytic leukemia (M5b) with t(11;17)(q23;q25). MLL involvement was revealed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, and an MLL/SEP9 fusion transcript was detected by RT-PCR. Sequencing analysis further showed that, in contrast to originally reported cases, MLL exon 8 was fused not with SEPT9 exon 3 but with exon 2, which codes for the unique N-terminal region of the SEPT9_v1 isoform, the region implicated in the regulation of gene expression and cell proliferation. We did not detect any mutation of FLT3, which was expressed at a relatively low level in the leukemic cells. Relapsing after a very short complete remission, the leukemia progressed rapidly and became fatal in spite of intensive therapies including hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

The FLT3 gene encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor that plays a key role in controlling survival, proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. Mutations in this gene are critical in causing a deregulation of the delicate balance between cell proliferation and differentiation. In this review, we provide an update on the structure, synthesis and activation of the FLT3 receptor and the subsequent activation of multiple downstream signaling pathways. We also review activating FLT3 mutations that are frequently identified in acute myeloid leukemia, cause activation of more complex downstream signaling pathways and promote leukemogenesis.

However, approximately 50% of adult AMLs have normal cytogenetics (NC-AMLs), and represent a heterogeneous and poorly understood group. We analysed gene expression in 55 AML samples including 53 cases from adult patients with NC-AML (n = 36), trisomy 8, t(15;17), t(8;21), t(11;19), 7q deletion, and two cell lines using 9000-gene DNA microarrays. Global hierarchical clustering showed that NC-AMLs are a heterogeneous group. Supervised analysis distinguished two subgroups of NC-AML: one subgroup constituted a homogeneous NC cluster ('pure NC-AML'), and the other NC-AMLs were close to the AML cases with translocations ('translocation like'). Gene expression signatures were also derived for patients with trisomy 8, as well as FLT3 and MLL gene duplications. Importantly, samples from 24 NC-AML patients who could be evaluated for clinical outcome were analysed. In all, 43 genes that discriminated two classes of patients with significantly different prognosis were identified. The poor prognosis class contained a majority of 'pure NC-AMLs', whereas the 'translocation-like' AMLs were in the good prognosis class. Discriminator genes included genes involved in drug resistance (TOP2B), protein transport (MTX2, SLC35A2), and cell signalling (MAPK1, PRKAB2). Our results demonstrate the transcriptional heterogeneity of NC-AMLs, and suggest the existence of 'translocation-like' NC-AMLs and of a gene expression signature that may predict response to chemotherapy.",

Like most other bone marrow failure syndromes, it is associated with a marked propensity to transform into a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute leukemia, with a cumulative rate of transformation to MDS/leukemia that exceeds 20%. The genetic (and/or epigenetic) changes that contribute to malignant transformation in SCN are largely unknown. In this study, we performed mutational profiling of 14 genes previously implicated in leukemogenesis using 14 MDS/leukemia samples from patients with SCN. We used high-throughput exon-based resequencing of whole-genome-amplified genomic DNA with a semiautomated method to detect mutations. The sensitivity and specificity of the sequencing pipeline was validated by determining the frequency of mutations in these 14 genes using 188 de novo AML samples. As expected, mutations of tyrosine kinase genes (FLT3, KIT, and JAK2) were common in de novo AML, with a cumulative frequency of 30%. In contrast, no mutations in these genes were detected in the SCN samples; instead, mutations of CSF3R, encoding the G-CSF receptor, were common. These data support the hypothesis that mutations of CSF3R may provide the \"activated tyrosine kinase signal\" that is thought to be important for leukemogenesis.",

Lestaurtinib, midostaurin, sorafenib, and quizartinib were selected among the FLT3 inhibitor drugs that are currently used in clinics for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. The drugs were loaded onto nanoparticle surface using a conjugation strategy based on hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions with the Pluronic co-polymer used as nanoparticle surface coating. Optical absorption characterization of the particles in solution showed that FLT3 inhibitor-incorporated gold nanoparticles were uniformly distributed and chemically stable regardless of the drug content. Drug loading study revealed a high drug content in the case of midostaurin drug which also showed increased stability. Drug release test in simulated cancer cell conditions demonstrated more than 56 % release of the entrapped drug, a result that correlates well with the superior cytotoxicity of the nano-conjugates comparatively with the free drug.;This is a pioneering study regarding the efficient loading of gold nanoparticles with selected FLT3 inhibitors.

A total of 4 types of IDH1 mutations were identified (c.395G→A, p.R132H, n = 4; c.394C→A, p.R132S, n = 1; c.394C→G, p.R132G, n = 1; c.315C→T, n = 1).

        "Doc_abstract":"Elucidation of the molecular genetic basis of leukaemias has relied on the cloning and characterization of recurring chromosomal translocations. A common theme in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) associated with balanced reciprocal translocations is the involvement of transcription factors as one or both of the fusion partners. Transcription factors commonly involved in chromosomal translocations include core binding factor (CBF), retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha), ETS family of transcription factors and homeobox gene (HOX) family members. In addition, the recruitment of transcriptional co-activators and co-repressors by these transcription factors suggests that these proteins also may play a critical role in leukaemogenesis. In support of this hypothesis' at least three fusions associated with leukaemias and involving transcriptional co-activators CBP and p300 have been recently cloned. However expression of transcription factor fusion proteins is not sufficient to induce a leukaemic phenotype, as evidenced in part by the long latencies required for disease development in the murine models of the disease. An emerging paradigm is the co-operation between constitutively activated tyrosine kinase molecules, such as FLT3, and transcription factor fusions in the pathogenesis of AML. In such a model, the activated tyrosine kinase confers proliferation and/or anti-apoptotic activity to the hematopoietic cells, while the transcription factor fusion impairs normal differentiation pathways with limited effect on cellular proliferation.",

Two different types of functionally important FLT3 mutations have been identified. Internal tandem duplication mutations arise from duplications of the juxtamembrane portion of the gene and result in constitutive activation of the FLT3 protein. This alteration has been identified in approximately 20% to 30% of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and appears to be associated with a worse prognosis. The second type of FLT3 mutation, missense mutations at aspartic acid residue 835, occurs in approximately 7.0% of acute myelogenous leukemia cases. These mutations also appear to be activating and to portend a worse prognosis. Identification of FLT3 mutations is important because it provides prognostic information and may play a pivotal role in determining appropriate treatment options. We have developed an assay to identify both internal tandem duplication and D835 FLT3 mutations in a single multiplex polymerase chain reaction. After amplification, the polymerase chain reaction products are analyzed by capillary electrophoresis for length mutations and resistance to EcoRV digestion.

Detection of minor clones or minimal residual clones with ITD mutations is desirable, but is challenging when the mutant signal determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and capillary electrophoresis is weak. In this study, we applied delta-PCR, which is a triple-primer strategy, to ensure PCR specificity and improve the sensitivity to 0.1% leukemic cells with ITD mutation. We also applied a reference peak to calculate ITD allelic burdens of <2% threshold of technical limitation for evaluating the relative ratio of 2 signals by capillary electrophoresis. Delta-PCR was able to detect single or multiple ITD mutations with an allelic burden (peak height ratio of mutant allele and wild-type allele) ranging from 0.4% to >100% among all 31 cases with previous documented ITD mutations. In one of the 3 cases with previously reported negative ITD mutation in the initial diagnostic specimen and ITD-positive results in the follow-up specimens, an ITD of 0.04% allele burden was retrospectively detected in the initial diagnosis specimen using delta-PCR. We also demonstrated that minor ITD mutant clones with an allelic burden of <1% present at diagnosis may become a dominant clone at the later refractory status, suggesting that detection of leukemic clones with allelic burdens of <1% may be clinically significant.

In clinical practice karyotyping and molecular analysis of NPM1, cEBPa and FLT3-ITD are required for treatment stratification and potentially genotype specific treatment. Some markers such as NPM1 not only offer prognostic information but can also serve as markers of minimal residual disease and thus have the potential to guide therapy in the future.The basis of curative treatment is intensive combination chemotherapy comprizing cytarabine and an anthracycline (\"7 + 3\" regimen). The prolonged duration of aplasia can be reduced significantly by accelerated therapy (\"S-HAM\" regimen). Following achievement of a complete remission patients with a low risk of relapse - based on genetic and clinical features - receive chemotherapy based consolidation therapy whereas high risk patients - and potentially also those with an intermediate risk - receive an allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Whereas adding the rather unspecific tyrosinekinase inhibitor sorafenib to standard treatment in unselected AML patients has not improved overall survival (OS), the addition of midostaurin to standard therapy in the selected group FLT3 mutated patients has resulted in a moderate but significant OS benefit.Real world data show that in patients below 50 years a cure rate of ca. 50 % can be achieved. However less than 10 % of patients above the age of 70 will be alive after five years even after intensive treatment. Therefore when curative and intensive treatment is deemed impossible the therapeutic standard in elderly and unfit patients used to be low-dose cytarabine with an average OS of 4 months. This has now been replaced by a new standard of care of hypomethylating agents - azacytidine and decitabine - which both achieve higher remission rates and show strong trends towards a prolonged OS of between 8 and 10 months.The paradigm for genotype-specific therapy is acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL - or AML M3 in the former FAB classification). This entity used to be a problematic AML subgroup because of its frequent coagulation disturbances and potentially fatal bleeding problems. Today patients with APL can be treated with a chemotherapy free combination of ATRA - a differentiating agent - and Arsenic Trioxide - an apoptosis inducing agent. In patients with a leukocyte count < 10 000 / µl a cure rate of > 90 % can now be achieved.",

With the view to evaluate the role of FLT3 mutation in APL, 54 patients (median age 28 years, range11-57 years, male to female ratio 1.2:1, median TLC 8.4 x 10(9)/l, range 1-170 x 10(9)/l) were studied by reverse transcriptase-PCR. Forty-two patients (77%) achieved first remission (CR1). Ten (18.5%) of the 54 patients had internal tandem duplication of exons 11 and 12 of the FLT3 gene. The median TLC count was significantly higher in FLT3 positive cases (Median TLC 55.0 x 10(9)/l) as compared to FLT3 negative cases (Median TLC 6.8 x 10(9)/l) (p = 0.001). Induction CR was much lower (40%) in FLT3/ITD positive cases as compared to 86% of FLT3/ITD negative cases (p = 0.005). Early deaths too were significantly associated with FLT3/ITD positive cases (50 vs. 16% p = 0.033). The difference in the occurrence of bcr1 and bcr3 isoforms was not statistically significant between the two groups. The data suggest that the presence of FLT3/ITD in APL patients confers a poor prognosis.",

On the basis of the structure of PCI-32765 (ibrutinib), a BTK kinase inhibitor that was recently reported to bear FLT3 kinase activity through a structure-guided drug design approach, we have discovered compound 18 (CHMFL-FLT3-122), which displayed an IC50 of 40 nM against FLT3 kinase and achieved selectivity over BTK kinase (over 10-fold). It significantly inhibited the proliferation of FLT3-ITD positive AML cancer cell lines MV4-11 (GI50 = 22 nM), MOLM13/14 (GI50 = 21 nM/42 nM). More importantly, 18 demonstrated 170-fold selectivity between FLT3 kinase and c-KIT kinase (GI50 = 11 nM versus 1900 nM) in the TEL-fusion isogenic BaF3 cells indicating a potential to avoid the FLT3/c-KIT dual inhibition induced myelosuppression toxicity. In the cellular context it strongly affected FLT3-ITD mediated signaling pathways and induced apoptosis by arresting the cell cycle into the G0/G1 phase. In the in vivo studies 18 demonstrated a good bioavailability (30%) and significantly suppressed the tumor growth in MV4-11 cell inoculated xenograft model (50 mg/kg) without exhibiting obvious toxicity. Compound 18 might be a potential drug candidate for FLT3-ITD positive AML. ",

We examined different mouse bone marrow (BM) hemopoietic precursor populations for the surface expression of Flt3 and tested them for early DC and p-preDC precursor activity. Most DC precursor activity, other than that given by multipotent hemopoietic stem cells, was within the downstream precursors expressing Flt3.

In contrast, only a small proportion of the common myeloid precursors (CMPs) expressed Flt3, but the precursor activity for both DCs and p-preDCs was within this minor Flt3+ CMP fraction. The granulocyte and macrophage precursors and pro-B cells did not express Flt3 and had no DC or p-preDC precursor activity.

The role of consolidation chemotherapy consisting of middle-dosage Ara-C (MD-Ara-C) on long term survival was evaluated.;Of 143 patients, 112 (78.3%) achieved CR after the first course of HAD/HAI induction treatment, and early death occurred in only one case. Notably, the CR rate of patients with an initial WBC count ≥100×10(9)/L was not significantly different from those with an initial WBC count<100× 10(9)/L (70.4% vs 80.2%, P=0.266). The CR rate for the patients with favorable, intermediate and unfavorable integrated genetics risk factors was 93.7%, 71.4% and 61.3%, respectively, the difference between groups was statistically significant (P=0.001). Patients with FLT3-ITD mutation obtained similar CR rate (70.6%) to that of patients with FLT3 wild type (79.3%, P=0.528).The estimated 5-year OS rate and 5-year RFS rate for all patients was 40.0% and 37.0%, respectively, with a median follow-up of 24 (range 1-104) months.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors eliminate the bulk of CML-CP cells, but fail to eradicate leukemia stem cells (LSCs) and leukemia progenitor cells (LPCs) displaying innate and acquired resistance, respectively. These cells may accumulate genomic instability, leading to disease relapse and/or malignant progression to a fatal blast phase. In the present study, we show that Rac2 GTPase alters mitochondrial membrane potential and electron flow through the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III (MRC-cIII), thereby generating high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in CML-CP LSCs and primitive LPCs. MRC-cIII-generated ROS promote oxidative DNA damage to trigger genomic instability, resulting in an accumulation of chromosomal aberrations and tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant BCR-ABL1 mutants. JAK2(V617F) and FLT3(ITD)-positive polycythemia vera cells and acute myeloid leukemia cells also produce ROS via MRC-cIII. In the present study, inhibition of Rac2 by genetic deletion or a small-molecule inhibitor and down-regulation of mitochondrial ROS by disruption of MRC-cIII, expression of mitochondria-targeted catalase, or addition of ROS-scavenging mitochondria-targeted peptide aptamer reduced genomic instability.

Based on these data, we propose an instructive, demand-regulated, cytokine-driven IPC and DC regeneration model, where high Flt3-ligand levels initiate a self-sustaining, Flt3-STAT3 and -PU.1-mediated IPC and DC differentiation program in Flt3(+)-hematopoietic progenitor cells.",

However, Rag deficiency does not prevent B-cell leukemogenesis in p53/NHEJ mutant mice, revealing that p53 and NHEJ also suppress Rag-independent mechanisms of B-cell leukemogenesis. Using several cytogenomic approaches, we identified a novel class of activating mutations in Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3), a receptor tyrosine kinase important for normal hematopoiesis in Rag/p53/NHEJ triple-mutant (TM) B-cell leukemias. These mutant Flt3 alleles were created by complex genomic rearrangements with Moloney leukemia virus (MuLV)-related endogenous retroviral (ERV) elements, generating ERV-Flt3 fusion genes encoding an N-terminally truncated mutant form of Flt3 (trFlt3) that was transcribed from ERV long terminal repeats. trFlt3 protein lacked most of the Flt3 extracellular domain and induced ligand-independent STAT5 phosphorylation and proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Furthermore, expression of trFlt3 in p53/NHEJ mutant hematopoietic progenitor cells promoted development of clinically aggressive B-cell leukemia. Thus, repetitive MuLV-related ERV sequences can participate in aberrant end-joining events that promote development of aggressive B-cell leukemia.",

In cells expressing wild-type (WT) p53, the HDM2 protein binds to p53 and blocks its activity. Inhibition of HDM2:p53 interaction activates p53 and causes apoptosis or cell-cycle arrest. Here, we investigated the ability of the novel HDM2 inhibitor CGM097 to potently and selectively kill WT p53-expressing AML cells. The antileukemic effects of CGM097 were studied using cell-based proliferation assays (human AML cell lines, primary AML patient cells, and normal bone marrow samples), apoptosis, and cell-cycle assays, ELISA, immunoblotting, and an AML patient-derived in vivo mouse model. CGM097 potently and selectively inhibited the proliferation of human AML cell lines and the majority of primary AML cells expressing WT p53, but not mutant p53, in a target-specific manner. Several patient samples that harbored mutant p53 were comparatively unresponsive to CGM097. Synergy was observed when CGM097 was combined with FLT3 inhibition against oncogenic FLT3-expressing cells cultured both in the absence as well as the presence of cytoprotective stromal-secreted cytokines, as well as when combined with MEK inhibition in cells with activated MAPK signaling. Finally, CGM097 was effective in reducing leukemia burden in vivo.

In the present study, we show that Lnk interacts physically with both wild-type FLT3 (FLT3-WT) and FLT3-ITD through the SH2 domains. We have identified the tyrosine residues 572, 591, and 919 of FLT3 as phosphorylation sites involved in direct binding to Lnk. Lnk itself was tyrosine phosphorylated by both FLT3 ligand (FL)-activated FLT3-WT and constitutively activated FLT3-ITD. Both shRNA-mediated depletion and forced overexpression of Lnk demonstrated that activation signals emanating from both forms of FLT3 are under negative regulation by Lnk. Moreover, Lnk inhibited 32D cell proliferation driven by different FLT3 variants. Analysis of primary BM cells from Lnk-knockout mice showed that Lnk suppresses the expansion of FL-stimulated hematopoietic progenitors, including lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitors. The results of the present study show that through direct binding to FLT3, Lnk suppresses FLT3-WT/ITD-dependent signaling pathways involved in the proliferation of hematopoietic cells. Therefore, modulation of Lnk expression levels may provide a unique therapeutic approach for FLT3-ITD-associated hematopoietic disease.",

Given that Meis1 is a co-factor for Hox genes, we hypothesized that the combined expression of HOXA4 and MEIS1 might add prognostic information in these patients. When diagnostic samples from 246 AML patients were divided into three main groups based on gene expression levels of HOXA4 combined with MEIS1 we found that within the group of patients exhibiting low levels of HOXA4, those with a high expression of MEIS1 had a significantly worse outcome than those exhibiting low MEIS1 expression (P = 0.025). Moreover, this prediction was independent of cytogenetics, mutational status of the NPM1 and FLT3 genes as well as upon WBC and age. To evaluate the possible contribution of regulatory events underlying these observations, 157 patient samples were subjected to promoter hypermethylation analysis. We observed that 77% were HOXA4- and 15%MEIS1 hypermethylated and that this epigenetic alteration was highly correlated to the gene expression level (MEIS1: P = 0.001; HOXA4: P = 0.007). Finally, we found a higher expression level and a higher frequency of hypermethylation of HOXA4 among patients with NPM1 mutations.

The discovery that some of these genes were located at the breakpoints of chromosome rearrangements in human malignancies, such as the MYC gene in Burkitt's lymphoma and the ABL gene in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has suggested that chromosome abnormalities were causally implicated in the pathogenesis of human diseases. Numerous nonrandom somatically acquired chromosomal translocations or inversions have been identified in human leukemias. The molecular cloning of the genes located at the breakpoints of these rearrangements allowed to identify more than 100 new oncogenes, the products of which affect normal programs of cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Chromosome translocations can lead to the deregulated expression of a normal gene product, but in most cases of leukemia, chromosome rearrangements result in the expression of a chimeric fusion protein. Oncogene products associated with acute leukemias are often transcription factors while tyrosine kinases and antiapoptotic proteins are more commonly activated or overexpressed in chronic leukemias and in lymphomas. Recent data indicated that gene rearrangements were not the sole gene alterations occurring in human leukemia since point mutations could also affect the function of transcription factors playing a key role in hematopoiesis such as C/EBP alpha, GATA1 and AML1. But the most exciting finding was the discovery of activating point mutations in tyrosine kinase receptors such as FLT3 and c-KIT in acute leukemia. Treatment of leukemia could therefore benefit from new therapeutic approaches targeting the function of specific oncogene products as already demonstrated for CML and acute promyelocytic leukemia.",

However, age-specific molecular alterations are becoming more evident and may signify the need to age-stratify treatment regimens. The NCI/COG TARGET-AML initiative used whole exome capture sequencing (WXS) to interrogate the genomic landscape of matched trios representing specimens collected upon diagnosis, remission, and relapse from 20 cases of de novo childhood AML. One hundred forty-five somatic variants at diagnosis (median 6 mutations/patient) and 149 variants at relapse (median 6.5 mutations) were identified and verified by orthogonal methodologies. Recurrent somatic variants [in (greater than or equal to) 2 patients] were identified for 10 genes (FLT3, NRAS, PTPN11, WT1, TET2, DHX15, DHX30, KIT, ETV6, KRAS), with variable persistence at relapse. The variant allele fraction (VAF), used to measure the prevalence of somatic mutations, varied widely at diagnosis. Mutations that persisted from diagnosis to relapse had a significantly higher diagnostic VAF compared with those that resolved at relapse (median VAF 0.43 vs. 0.24, P < 0.001). Further analysis revealed that 90% of the diagnostic variants with VAF >0.4 persisted to relapse compared with 28% with VAF <0.2 (P < 0.001). This study demonstrates significant variability in the mutational profile and clonal evolution of pediatric AML from diagnosis to relapse. Furthermore, mutations with high VAF at diagnosis, representing variants shared across a leukemic clonal structure, may constrain the genomic landscape at relapse and help to define key pathways for therapeutic targeting.

The molecular mechanisms involved in the development of CD4+CD56+HN are largely unresolved. Moreover, recurrent chromosomal alterations have not yet been precisely defined in CD4+CD56+HN and c-AML. In the present study an integrated genomic analysis using expression profiling and array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was performed on lesional skin biopsy samples of patients with CD4+CD56+HN and c-AML. Our results demonstrate that CD4+CD56+HN and c-AML show distinct gene-expression profiles and distinct patterns of chromosomal aberrations. CD4+CD56+HN is characterized by recurrent deletion of regions on chromosome 4 (4q34), chromosome 9 (9p13-p11 and 9q12-q34), and chromosome 13 (13q12-q31) that contain several tumor suppressor genes with diminished expression (Rb1, LATS2). Elevated expression of the oncogenes HES6, RUNX2, and FLT3 was found but was not associated with genomic amplification.

To determine the frequency and co-occurrence of mutations in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we performed targeted re-sequencing of 115 genes across 155 diagnostic samples (44 adult and 111 childhood cases). NOTCH1 and CDKN2A/B were mutated/deleted in more than half of the cases, while an additional 37 genes were mutated/deleted in 4% to 20% of cases. We found that IL7R-JAK pathway genes were mutated in 27.7% of cases, with JAK3 mutations being the most frequent event in this group. Copy number variations were also detected, including deletions of CREBBP or CTCF and duplication of MYB. FLT3 mutations were rare, but a novel extracellular mutation in FLT3 was detected and confirmed to be transforming. Furthermore, we identified complex patterns of pairwise associations, including a significant association between mutations in IL7R-JAK genes and epigenetic regulators (WT1, PRC2, PHF6). Our analyses showed that IL7R-JAK genetic lesions did not confer adverse prognosis in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases enrolled in the UK ALL2003 trial. Overall, these results identify interconnections between the T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia genome and disease biology, and suggest a potential clinical application for JAK inhibitors in a significant proportion of patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

The FLT3 inhibitor CEP-701 selectively kills these cells, but is unlikely to be curative if used as monotherapy. To identify potentially synergistic combination strategies, we studied CEP-701 and six standard chemotherapeutic agents in three sequences of exposure (S1: chemotherapy followed by CEP-701, S2: simultaneous exposure to both; and S3: CEP-701 followed by chemotherapy) using MLL-rearranged ALL cell lines and patient bone marrow samples. MTT cytotoxicity and annexin V binding apoptosis assays were used to assess antileukemic effects. Combination indices (CI) were calculated for each combination (CI<0.9 - synergistic; CI 0.9-1.1 - additive; CI>1.1 - antagonistic). A striking pattern of sequence-dependent synergy was observed: S1 was markedly synergistic (mean CI=0.59+/-0.10), S2 was additive (mean CI=0.99+/-0.09) and S3 was antagonistic (mean CI=1.23+/-0.10).

The physiologic functions of the TAM receptors in innate immune control, natural killer (NK) cell differentiation, efferocytosis, clearance of apoptotic debris, and hemostasis have previously been described and more recent data implicate TAM kinases as important regulators of erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. The TAM receptors are aberrantly or ectopically expressed in many hematologic malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia, B- and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and multiple myeloma. TAM receptors contribute to leukemic phenotypes through activation of pro-survival signaling pathways and interplay with other oncogenic proteins such as FLT3, LYN, and FGFR3. The TAM receptors also contribute to resistance to both cytotoxic chemotherapeutics and targeted agents, making them attractive therapeutic targets. A number of translational strategies for TAM inhibition are in development, including small molecule inhibitors, ligand traps, and monoclonal antibodies. Emerging areas of research include modulation of TAM receptors to enhance anti-tumor immunity, potential roles for TYRO-3 in leukemogenesis, and the function of the bone marrow microenvironment in mediating resistance to TAM inhibition.",

Besides the loss of DC progenitors, pan-hematopoietic Cbfb-deficient mice also lack CD105(+) erythroid progenitors, leading to severe anemia at 3 to 4 months of age. Instead, Cbfb deficiency results in aberrant progenitor differentiation toward granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs), resulting in a myeloproliferative phenotype with accumulation of GMPs in the periphery and cellular infiltration of the liver. Expression of the transcription factor Irf8 is severely reduced in Cbfb-deficient progenitors, and overexpression of Irf8 restors DC differentiation. These results demonstrate that Runx proteins and Cbfβ restrict granulocyte lineage commitment to facilitate multilineage hematopoietic differentiation and thus identify their novel tumor suppressor function in myeloid leukemia.

To evaluate their prognostic significance, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. Eleven studies covering a total of 1063 subjects were included in this review. Incidence of ITD and TKD mutations was 12-38% and 2-20%, respectively. In 9 of 11 studies, ITD was associated with high WBC count at the time of diagnosis, which is a known prognostic indicator in APL. Patients with ITD had inferior 3-year overall survival compared to patients without ITD (risk ratio 1.42, 95% CI: 1.04-1.95). Similarly, ITD was also associated with adverse 3-year disease-free survival (risk ratio 1.48, 95% CI: 1.02-2.15). There were only two studies that evaluated the association of TKD mutation in APL; both showed a trend towards worse survival in patients with mutated TKD. In conclusion, FLT3 ITD is associated with high WBC at diagnosis in patients with APL. Although the available literature is limited to observational studies, our systematic review suggests that FLT3 mutations, especially ITD, can adversely affect overall survival and disease-free survival in APL.",

We investigated if FL and its receptor, Flt3, functionally interact with CXCL12/CXCR4 to regulate hematopoietic cell migration. FL stimulated chemokinetic activity when used alone, but synergistically enhanced short-term migration of CD34+ cells, Ba/F3 cells expressing human Flt3 (Ba/F3-Flt3), and human RS4;11 acute leukemia cells, induced by CXCL12. Moreover, overexpression of constitutively activated internal tandem duplication (ITD)-Flt3 mutants in Ba/F3 cells dramatically enhanced migration toward CXCL12. In Ba/F3-Flt3 cells, synergistic cell migration to FL plus CXCL12 was associated with enhanced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase p42/p44 (MAPK(p42/p44)), cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB), and Akt, and was partially inhibited by pretreatment of cells with selective inhibitors for MAPK(p42/p44), protein kinase A (PKA), or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), implicating these pathways in migration to FL plus CXCL12. In contrast, prolonged exposure of CD34+ or Ba/F3-Flt3 cells to FL down-regulated CXCR4 expression, inhibited CXCL12-mediated phosphorylation of MAPK(p42/p44), CREB, and Akt, and impaired migration toward CXCL12. These findings suggest that FL/Flt3 may facilitate hematopoietic cell migration/homing and mobilization by enhancing or inhibiting CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling pathways and that the FL/Flt3 axis participates in trafficking of normal and transformed hematopoietic cells.",

Furthermore, the PIG-A-null phenotype is readily detected by flow cytometry. Using PIG-A, we have now provided the first in vitro measurement of μ in myeloid cells, using cultures of CD34+ cells that are transduced with either the AML-ETO or the MLL-AF9 fusion genes and expanded with cytokines. For the AML-ETO cultures, the median μ value was ∼9.4×10(-7) (range ∼3.6-23×10(-7)) per cell division. In contrast, few spontaneous mutations were observed in the MLL-AF9 cultures. Knockdown of p53 or introduction of mutant NRAS or FLT3 alleles did not have much of an effect on μ.

To elucidate these mechanisms and identify other disease targets, a kinome analysis screened 439 recombinant kinases at 100 nM pacritinib concentration. For kinases with >50% inhibition, pacritinib was titrated from 1 to 100 nM. JAK2, JAK2V617F, FLT3, colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor, and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 achieved half-maximal inhibitory concentrations <50 nM. Pacritinib did not inhibit JAK1 (82% control at 100 nM).

Proviral integration-mediated elevated expression of the meningioma 1 (MN1) oncogene suggested MN1 acting as cooperating event in mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (MLL) and eleven nineteen leukemia (ENL)-induced murine leukemia. Indeed, co-expression of MN1 with MLL-ENL enhanced transformation in vivo, and resulted in a significantly reduced latency for induction of an aggressive acute leukemia when compared with MN1 or MLL-ENL alone. In addition, co-expression of MN1 increased the granulocyte macrophage progenitor cell population with leukemia-initiating properties as shown in secondary transplantation experiments. Gene expression profiling experiments identified putative downstream MN1 targets, of which FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) and CD34 were upregulated in both MN1-overexpressing murine leukemias and in pediatric acute leukemias with high MN1 levels. Interestingly, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated MN1 knockdown resulted in cell cycle arrest and impaired clonogenic growth of human leukemia cell lines with high MN1 levels. Our work shows for the first time that high MN1 levels are important for the growth of leukemic cells, and that increased MN1 expression can synergize with MLL-ENL and probably other transforming fusion genes in leukemia induction through a distinct gene expression program that is able to expand the leukemia-initiating cell population.",

In leukemia, it is well described that activating internal tandem duplications (ITD) mutations in receptor tyrosine kinases like cKit or Flt3 confer to the pathogenesis of cancer. Here, we analyzed whether Wnt-signaling plays a role in cKit-ITD mediated transformation. Stably transfected 32D cells with cKit-ITD cells had higher beta-Catenin protein levels compared to the cKit-WT. Analysis of beta-Catenin mRNA and protein levels revealed that beta-Catenin was regulated at post-transcriptional level in cKit-ITD as well as Flt3-ITD compared to the wildtype. Signaling analyses revealed higher-phosphorylation of GSK3beta by oncogenic cKit-ITD. Moreover, activation of Wnt signaling was confirmed by constitutive activation of c-myc luciferase by cKit-ITD cells. Importantly, using dominant negative TCF4, we show that activation of Wnt signaling plays an important role in cKit mediated transformation of myeloid cells. Application of specific receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors for Flt3 or cKit result in a decrease of beta-Catenin that underwent with a decrease of GSK3beta phosphorylation, suggesting an indirect mechanism of beta-Catenin regulation by oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases in both ITD mutations.

Nevertheless, the role and safety of this antibody target-therapy in first-line chemotherapy in patients younger than 65 years has not yet been defined.;The primary goal of this prospective phase II pilot study was to evaluate the efficacy and the safety profile of FLAI plus GO as induction regimen. Thirty consecutive AML patients were included. All patients were younger than 65 with a median age of 53 years and CD33 expression exceeded 20% in all cases. The M/F ratio was 16/14 and 21/30 (70%) of patients were poor-risk at diagnosis. The induction regimen (FLAI-GO) included fludarabine (30mg/m(2)) and Ara-C (2g/m(2)) on days 1-5, idarubicin (10mg/m(2)) on days 1, 3, and 5 and GO (3mg/m(2)) on day 6. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) was planned for all high risk AML patients in first complete remission (CR) after consolidation with intermediate doses of Ara-C and idarubicin (IDAC-IDA). Cytogenetic, multidrug-resistance phenotype, FLT3 mutation status, and WT1 quantitative expression analyses were performed at diagnosis in all patients. WT1 expression and cytogenetic (in positive cases) analyses were performed after induction to detect and follow minimal residual disease.;Patients were evaluated for response rate, treatment-related adverse events, overall survival and relapse free survival. After induction with FLAI-GO, CR rate was 90% (26 of 29 evaluable pts); one patient achieved partial remission and two were resistant. There was only one case of death during induction (DDI). After FLAI-GO, the mean value of WT1 dropped from 4200+/-2777 copies/10(4)ABL to 192+/-399 copies/10(4)ABL. The toxicity of FLAI-GO was acceptable; 57% of patients experienced transient and reversible GO infusion-related adverse events (especially fever and chills), but no cases of veno-occlusive disease occurred during CHT or after HSCT. After a median follow-up of 16 months (range 2-25), 24/30 (80%) patients are alive (24/24 in CR). The probability of 1-year OS and RFS was 90 and 85%, respectively. Allogeneic and autologus HSCT was performed in 19 (63%) and 4 (13%) patients, respectively.;These preliminary results suggest that FLAI-GO is an effective and well tolerated induction regimen for CD33 positive AML patients younger than 65 years, with a high complete response rate, favourable safety profile, low DDI. These results encourage the testing of this regimen in a multicenter prospective trial.",

        "Doc_abstract":"flt3/flk-2 ligand (FL) is a cytokine that exhibits synergistic activities in combination with other early acting factors on subpopulations of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. In addition to normal hematopoietic precursors, expression of the FL receptor, flt3R, has been frequently demonstrated on the blast cells from patients with acute B-lineage lymphoblastic, myeloid, and biphenotypic (also known as hybrid or mixed) leukemias. Because many of these leukemic cell types express FL, the possibility has been raised that altered regulation of FL-mediated signaling might contribute to malignant transformation or expansion of the leukemic clone. In humans, FL is predominantly synthesized as a transmembrane protein that must undergo proteolytic cleavage to generate a soluble form. To investigate the consequences of constitutively expressing the analogous murine FL isoform in murine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, lethally irradiated syngeneic mice (18 total) were engrafted with post-5-fluorouracil-treated bone marrow cells transduced ex vivo with a recombinant retroviral vector (MSCV-FL) encoding murine transmembrane FL. Compared with control mice (8 total), MSCV-FL mice presented with a mild macrocytic anemia but were otherwise healthy for more than 5 months posttransplant (until 22 weeks). Subsequently, all primary MSCV-FL recipients observed for up to 1 year plus 83% (20 of 24) of secondary MSCV-FL animals that had received bone marrow from asymptomatic primary hosts reconstituted for 4 to 5 months developed transplantable hematologic malignancies (with mean latency periods of 30 and 23 weeks, respectively). Phenotypic and molecular analyses indicated that the tumor cells expressed flt3R and displayed B-cell and/or myeloid markers. These data, establishing that dysregulated expression of FL in primitive hematopoietic cells predisposes flt3R+ precursors to leukemic transformation, underscore a potential role of this cytokine/receptor combination in certain human leukemias.",

The most frequent mechanism of activation is disruption of the juxtamembrane autoregulatory domain by internal tandem duplications (ITDs). FLT3-ITDs confer factor-independent growth to hematopoietic cells and induce a myeloproliferative syndrome in murine bone marrow transplant models. We and others have observed that FLT3-ITD activates STAT5 and its downstream effectors, whereas ligand-stimulated wild-type FLT3 (FLT3WT) does not. In vitro mapping of tyrosine phosphorylation sites in FLT3-ITD identified 2 candidate STAT5 docking sites within the juxtamembrane domain that are disrupted by the ITD. Tyrosine to phenylalanine substitution of residues 589 and 591 in the context of the FLT3-ITD did not affect tyrosine kinase activity, but abrogated STAT5 activation. Furthermore, FLT3-ITD-Y589/591F was incapable of inducing a myeloproliferative phenotype when transduced into primary murine bone marrow cells, whereas FLT3-ITD induced myeloproliferative disease with a median latency of 50 days. Thus, the conformational change in the FLT3 juxtamembrane domain induced by the ITD activates the kinase through dysregulation of autoinhibition and results in qualitative differences in signal transduction through STAT5 that are essential for the transforming potential of FLT3-ITD in vivo.",

This progress had led to the development of small molecules that specifically inhibit the abnormally activated kinase. The first example of such targeted therapy is imatinib-mesylate, an inhibitor of the BCR-ABL fusion gene that is found in more than 90% of patients with Philadelphia positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and in 20-30% of those with Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The excellent clinical results obtained with imatinib in CML have completely changed the therapeutic approach to this disease, and imatinib is now the gold standard for treatment of newly diagnosed CML. This has instigated a tremendous effort to develop targeted PTK therapy based on the presence of over 40 chromosomal translocations that lead to deregulation of 12 different PTK associated with various hematologic malignancies. That deregulated PTK are also involved in the pathogenesis of acute leukemia is underlined by the frequent occurrence of mutations leading to constitutive activation of the FLT3. Experimental as well as clinical evidence supports a model of acute leukemia based on the co-operation of constitutive active PTK with mutations of transcriptional regulators. Here we review the general impact of mutated PTK on the pathogenesis of various hematologic malignancies.

Our limited understanding of MLL-AF4-mediated transformation reflects the absence of human models reproducing this leukemia. Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) constitute likely targets for transformation. We previously reported that MLL-AF4 enhanced hematopoietic engraftment and clonogenic potential in cord blood (CB)-derived CD34+ HSPCs but was not sufficient for leukemogenesis, suggesting that additional oncogenic lesions are required for MLL-AF4-mediated transformation. MLL-AF4+ pro-B-ALL display enormous levels of FLT3, and occasionally FLT3-activating mutations, thus representing a candidate cooperating event in MLL-AF4+ pro-B-ALL. We have explored whether FLT3.TKD (tyrosine kinase domain) mutation or increased expression of FLT3.WT (wild type) cooperates with MLL-AF4 to immortalize/transform CB-CD34+ HSPCs. In vivo, FLT3.TKD/FLT3.WT alone, or in combination with MLL-AF4, enhances hematopoietic repopulating function of CB-CD34+ HSPCs without impairing migration or hematopoietic differentiation. None of the animals transplanted with MLL-AF4+FLT3.TKD/WT-CD34+ HSPCs showed any sign of disease after 16 weeks. In vitro, enforced expression of FLT3.TKD/FLT3.WT conveys a transient overexpansion of MLL-AF4-expressing CD34+ HSPCs associated to higher proportion of cycling cells coupled to lower apoptotic levels, but does not augment clonogenic potential nor confer stable replating. Together, FLT3 activation does not suffice to immortalize/transform MLL-AF4-expressing CB-CD34+ HSPCs, suggesting the need of alternative (epi)-genetic cooperating oncogenic lesions. ",

In the present study, we examined the effect of a ligand for Flt3 (FL), whose receptor tyrosine kinase is closely related to c-kit, in combination with IL-6/sIL-6R on human hematopoiesis in vitro. In serum-containing methylcellulose clonal culture of cord blood CD34(+) cells, whereas FL alone stimulated only granulocyte-macrophage (GM) colony formation, erythroid bursts and mixed colonies in addition to GM colonies were induced by FL with IL-6/sIL-6R, but not IL-6/sIL-6R alone. In suspension culture, CD34(+) cells generated a small number of myeloid cells in the presence of FL or IL-6/sIL-6R alone. However, the addition of IL-6/sIL-6R to the culture with FL induced the generation of a significant number of erythroid cells and megakaryocytes in addition to myeloid cells. The combination of FL and IL-6/sIL-6R also induced a remarkable expansion of GM colony- and erythroid burst-forming cells and multipotential progenitors, although FL or IL-6/sIL-6R alone induced the generation of only a small number of progenitors for GM colonies. The synergistic effects of FL and IL-6/sIL-6R were confirmed in serum-free clonal and suspension cultures. In addition, the addition of anti-human gp130 monoclonal antibodies abrogated the synergistic action. These results indicate that Flt3 signal, as well as c-kit signal, synergizes with gp130 signal to stimulate human myelopoiesis, erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis, and the expansion of primitive multipotential hematopoietic progenitor cells.",

However, many children still die of their disease or of treatment-related toxicities. Even in patients that are cured, there can be significant and, not uncommonly debilitating, acute and late complications of treatment. Improved understanding of the molecular and cellular biology of leukemia and the increasing availability of high-throughput genomic techniques have facilitated the development of molecularly targeted therapies that have the potential to be more effective and less toxic than the standard approaches. In this article, we review the progress to date with agents that are showing promise in the treatment of childhood acute leukemia, including monoclonal antibodies, inhibitors of kinases and other signaling molecules (e.g., BCR-ABL, FLT3, farnesyltransferase, mTOR and γ-secretase), agents that target epigenetic regulation of gene expression (DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and histone deacetylase inhibitors) and proteasome inhibitors. For the specific agents in each of these classes, we summarize the published preclinical data and the clinical trials that have been completed, are in progress or are being planned for children with acute leukemia. Finally, we discuss potential challenges to the success of molecularly targeted therapy, including proper target identification, adequate targeting of leukemia stem cells, developing synergistic and tolerable combinations of agents and designing adequately powered clinical trials to test efficacy in molecularly defined subsets of patients.",

Three major types of treatment (excluding cellular therapy) are currently available in onco-hematology: conventional chemotherapy, small molecules for targeted therapy and monoclonal antibodies. Conventional chemotherapy with optimization of doses and multidrug-based regimens allowed to substantially improve survival of patients and keeps a place of choice in treatment of these diseases. Targeted treatments came from the cytogenetic and molecular characterization of hemopathies. Thus, the kinase Bcr-Abl, as a result of the translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11), has been successfully targeted by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in chronic myeloid leukemia and Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Molecular abnormalities like internal-tandem duplication/point activating mutations in FLT3 in some acute myeloblastic leukemia or epigenetic dysregulations in some blood malignancies can also be targeted by small molecules. Hematopoietic malignant cells are phenotypically characterized by expression of cluster of differentiation (CD) on their surface. These CD are detected by flow cytometry using specific antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies targeting different CD have been developed for treatment. Rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody, was the first monoclonal antibody successfully developed for treatment of malignant hematologic diseases. Since rituximab, many other monoclonal antibodies are being developed. Trends in malignant hematologic diseases presented here will include treatments, which have at least entered phase I/II clinical trials in adult or childhood leukemia. They include some novel drugs of conventional chemotherapy like second-generation nucleoside analogues. We will give an overview of the small molecules targeting the different cellular pathways and we will highlight those appearing as the most promising like novel TKIs.

Bone marrow neoangiogenesis is mediated by several growth factors, such as VEGF-A, VEGF-C, angiopoietin-1 and -2, FGF, HGF, TGF-β and others secreted by leukemic cells. The prognostic relevance of microvessel density, and expression of VEGF-A and -C has been demonstrated especially in acute myeloid leukemia. In the last years, several classes of angiogenesis inhibitors have been developed blocking several angiogenic pathways. These include drugs that inhibit the VEGF (with or without blockade of FLT3) and the mTor signalling cascade. Besides, thalidomide and lenalidomide although possessing a pleiotrophic mode of action including antiangiogenic properities have been evaluated in the treatment of human leukemias. In the current review we analyze the results of clinical trials employing these antiangiogenic drugs. Since the clinical efficacy of these compounds used as monotherapy is often limited, confined to certain subgroups of patients and frequently short lived, several trials combining standard chemotherapy with these agents have been initiated in order to demonstrate an additional benefit to standard therapy. Furthermore the introduction of new antiangiogenic drugs such as inhibitors of the angiopoietin and HGF/cMET pathway is on the horizon. Utilizing cocktails of inhibitors of several angiogenic pathways may represent a new possibility to augment the efficacy of antiangiogenic therapy in the future.",

In vivo studies were then performed to assess the response of LSCs to therapeutic insult. Treatment of animals with the ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate induced specific modulation of blasts and progenitor cells but not stem- cell populations, thereby recapitulating events inferred to occur in human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients. In addition, challenge of leukemic mice with total body irradiation was selectively toxic to normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), suggesting that LSCs are resistant to apoptosis and/or senescence in vivo.

The internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the juxtamembrane region of this receptor is the most prevalent mutation in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The silencing mediator of retinoic and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) co-repressor recruits histone deacetylases (HDAC) and mediates transcriptional repression by interacting with various transcription factors. We recently reported that Flt3-ITD interferes with the transcriptional and biological action of promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger transcriptional repressor by dissociating it from SMRT. In this study, we aimed to clarify whether the repressional activity of other well-known oncoproteins, such as AML1/Runx1 (AML1), is also affected by Flt3-ITD. We verified that the repression activity of AML1B, the isoform of AML1, is dependent on HDAC activity by using HDAC inbitor trichostatin A in GAL4 reporter assays. Mammalian two-hybrid assays demonstrated that this protein interacts with SMRT. Furthermore, this AML1B-SMRT interaction was disrupted by the overexpression of Flt3-ITD, leading to the reduction of AML1B repression activity. Additionally, we showed AML1B repression target, p21 (WAF1/CIP1), was aberrantly expressed in Flt3-ITD stably expressed BaF3 cells.

We have demonstrated that tumor cells pour their DNA, RNA, and protein content into circulation because of turnover and breakdown of cell structures. Proteins in solution most likely circulate as complexes, which protects them from degradation. We describe a cell-free, bead-based method that takes advantage of this phenomenon. Our approach is based on immunoprecipitation of the protein of interest on the surface of beads, followed by detection of the protein or its modification (phosphorylation) using a secondary antibody labeled with phycoerythrin at a 1:1 ratio. Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3, which is mutated in majority of cases of acute myeloid leukemia, is used as an example. This method could be applied to the quantitation of several other proteins without the need for intact cells.",

This gene rearrangement is associated with a good outcome presenting a high response rate to chemotherapy. In spite of its potential clinical relevance, the t(12;21) translocation usually goes undetected with conventional cytogenetic procedures. In the present study we utilized an objective flow cytometric approach (multiparametric quantitative analysis) for the phenotypic characterization of this type of ALL. We studied a total of 74 precursor B-ALL children, including 21 t(12;21)+ and 53 t(12;21)- cases. Our results show that the t(12;21)(p13;q22)+ ALLs display a higher intensity of CD10 (P = 0.0016) and HLADR (P = 0.005) expression together with lower levels of the CD20 (P = 0.01), CD45 (P = 0.01), CD135 (P = 0.003) and CD34 (P = 0.03) antigens as compared to the t(12;21) cases. Moreover, as regards CD34 expression, we observed a more heterogeneous antigen expression within individual patients with higher coefficients of variation (median of 202 vs 88, P = 0.0001). A multi-variate analysis disclosed that with the immunophenotypic approach used identification of t(12;21)+ cases can be achieved with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 100%. We conclude that childhood precursor B-ALL carrying the t(12;21) translocation display characteristic phenotypic features which could provide a rapid, simple, sensitive and specific screening method to select for those cases that should undergo confirmatory molecular analysis.",

The mutation landscape in MDS is shaped by gene aberrations involved in DNA methylation (TET2, DNMT3A, IDH1/2), histone modification (ASXL1, EZH2), the RNA splicing machinery (SF3B1, SRSF2, ZRSR2, U2AF1/2), transcription (RUNX1, TP53, BCOR, PHF6, NCOR, CEBPA, GATA2), tyrosine kinase receptor signaling (JAK2, MPL, FLT3, GNAS, KIT), RAS pathways (KRAS, NRAS, CBL, NF1, PTPN11), DNA repair (ATM, BRCC3, DLRE1C, FANCL), and cohesion complexes (STAG2, CTCF, SMC1A, RAD21).

A preleukemic step is characterized by an acute proliferation of proerythroblasts due to the arrest of differentiation provoked by Spi-1/PU.1. Later on, a blastic crisis occurs associated with somatic oncogenic mutations in the stem cell factor (SCF) receptor kit. To gain insights into the mechanisms of the leukemic progression, we performed proteomic profiling analyses of proerythroblasts isolated at the 2 stages of the disease. Our results indicate that the level of ezrin, a membrane cytoskeletal crosslinker, is increased in the leukemic cells. We show that Kit oncogenic forms are responsible for ezrin phosphorylation and that phosphorylation rather than overexpression is essential in the leukemic proerythroblasts. Using expression of dominant-negative forms of ezrin, we show that phosphorylation of ezrin on residue Y353 participates in apoptosis resistance, whereas phosphorylation on residue Y145 promotes proliferation of the leukemic cells in vitro and in vivo. Another recurrent oncogenic form of tyrosine kinases (Flt3) most frequently involved in human myeloid leukemia was also able to phosphorylate ezrin.

The purpose of this study was to identify downstream targets of NADPH oxidase (Nox)-derived ROS signalling in acute myeloid leukaemia cells, by performing a proteomic analysis utilizing two-dimensional phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. The majority of the targets identified were cytoskeletal-associated proteins including Ezrin, a known regulator of the cytoskeleton, which was examined further. The study demonstrated that inhibition of Nox enzymes, using diphenyleneiodonium chloride in the acute myeloid leukaemia cell line MOLM-13, resulted in a decrease in Ezrin tyrosine phosphorylation and also triggered a shift in Ezrin sub-cellular localization as detected by immunofluorescence. The change in Ezrin localization coincided with altered cell morphology, observed using scanning electron microscopy and a decreased ability to migrate through a polycarbonate transwell membrane. Similar effects were observed upon inhibition of the oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 using the staurosporine derivate PKC412, implicating a role for FLT3 as an upstream regulator of Ezrin. Our results indicate that FLT3 drives production of ROS by Nox, which stimulates changes in Ezrin tyrosine phosphorylation and localization via redox regulation of Src.

This inhibition was due to induction of the G0-G1 arrest. A marked up-regulation of p27 by suppression of its protein degradation and an abrogation of constitutive signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 phosphorylation were revealed in arrested leukemia cells after FL stimulation. Importantly, FL treatment rendered not only cell lines but also primary leukemia cells with MLL rearrangement resistant to chemotherapeutic agents. MLL-rearranged leukemia cells adhering to the bone marrow stromal cell line, which expresses FL as the membrane-bound form, were induced to quiescent state resistant to chemotherapeutic agents, but their chemosensitivity was significantly restored in the presence of neutralizing anti-FL antibody.

In the present study, we show that SU11657, a small multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with Flt3 affinity, suppressed in vitro natural IFN-producing and DC development in Flt3L-supplemented mouse whole bone marrow cell cultures in a dose-dependant manner, while DC development in GM-CSF-supplemented cultures was not affected. In vivo SU11657 application led to a significant decrease of both natural IFN-producing and DCs, comparable to the reduction observed in Flt3L(-/-) mice. Conversely, Flt3L plasma levels increased massively in inhibitor-treated animals, likely via a regulatory feedback loop, without being able to compensate for pharmacological Flt3 inhibition. No obvious toxicity was observed, and hemopoietic progenitor cell and stem cell function remained intact as assessed by myeloid colony-forming unit activity and in vivo bone marrow repopulation assays. Furthermore, upon treatment discontinuation, IFN-producing and DCs recovered to normal levels, proving that treatment effects were transient.

        "Doc_abstract":"Conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) have been reported to participate in the pathophysiology of acute lung injury (ALI). Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) signaling represents a highly specific pathway for the manipulation of cDCs in vivo. The purpose of this study was to clarify the effect of FLT3 signaling on the accumulation and maturation of pulmonary cDCs, and whether inhibition of FLT3 signaling may attenuate acute lung inflammation and lung injury. C57BL/6 mice were pretreated with FLT3-ligand (FLT3L) and lestaurtinib separately for five consecutive days. A murine model of ALI was subsequently generated by intra-tracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lung specimens were harvested 24 h later. Flow cytometry was conducted to measure the accumulation and maturation of pulmonary cDCs. IL-6, IFN-γ, IL-4, MPO activity and transcription factor T-bet/GATA-3 mRNA ratio were quantified to evaluate lung inflammation. Lung injury was estimated by lung wet weight/body weight ratio (LWW/BW) and histopathological analysis. LPS challenge resulted in rapid accumulation and maturation of pulmonary cDCs. FLT3L pretreatment further stimulated the accumulation and maturation of pulmonary cDCs, leading to a markedly increased LWW/BW and aggravated lung histopathology. Meanwhile, lung MPO activity, T-bet/GATA-3 mRNA ratio and concentrations of IL-6 and IFN-γ were elevated by FLT3L administration. In contrast, lestaurtinib pretreatment inhibited the accumulation and maturation of pulmonary cDCs, leading to a significantly decreased LWW/BW and improved lung histopathology. Lestaurtinib administration also suppressed lung MPO activity, T-bet/GATA-3 mRNA ratio and production of IL-6 and IFN-γ. Our findings show that FLT3 signaling ameliorates ALI by regulating the accumulation and maturation of pulmonary cDCs, suggesting an innovative pharmacotherapy for ALI.",

Leukemic colony formation was found in approximately 70 to 80% of the patients in the presence of at least one of the above CSFs. Although IL-11 alone did not support L-CFU, the growth of these progenitors in the presence of other cytokines was enhanced by IL-11 in 16 out of 33 patients and it showed a synergistic action with G-CSF in 12 of them. This synergistic action occurred in seven out of nine M5 patients (French-American-British (FAB) classification). A single cell clone-sorting experiment clearly demonstrated that this synergistic effect was operative at the single progenitor cell level. The number of leukemic cells proliferating in the presence of G-CSF+IL-11 was significantly higher than in the presence of G-CSF alone, suggesting that IL-11 recruited dormant leukemic progenitors into the cell cycle. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that all types of AML blast cells (M0 approximately M6) ubiquitously expressed gp130, although the level of expression was significantly higher in M5 cells. In contrast, expression of the IL-11 receptor alpha chain (IL-11Ralpha) varied between FAB types. Blast cells obtained from M1, M3 and M5 patients showed higher levels of expression, with M5 cells showing the strongest expression. Interestingly, the leukemic progenitor cells for which proliferation was synergistically enhanced by IL-11 had significantly higher expression of both IL-11Ralpha and gp130. These results suggest that administration of IL-11 in vivo may stimulate the proliferation of leukemic progenitor cells, particularly M5 cells, in the presence of G-CSF, and that the responsiveness of L-CFU to IL-11 may be predicted by a simple receptor assay.",

To identify mutations contributing to leukemogenesis in DS-ALL, we undertook sequencing of candidate genes, including FLT3, RAS, PTPN11, BRAF, and JAK2. Sequencing of the JAK2 pseudokinase domain identified a specific, acquired mutation, JAK2R683, in 12 (28%) of 42 DS-ALL cases. Functional studies of the common JAK2R683G mutation in murine Ba/F3 cells showed growth factor independence and constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. High-resolution SNP array analysis of 9 DS-ALL cases identified additional submicroscopic deletions in key genes, including ETV6, CDKN2A, and PAX5.

Here we use a reporter based on Ikaros regulatory elements to separate early progenitors in wild-type and Ikaros-null mice. We found previously undetected Ikaros-null lympho-myeloid progenitors lacking the receptor tyrosine kinase Flt3 that were capable of myeloid but not lymphoid differentiation. In contrast, lack of Ikaros in the common myeloid progenitor resulted in increased formation of erythro-megakaryocytes at the expense of myeloid progenitors.

Internal tandem duplications (ITDs) are found in approximately 25% and point mutations within the second tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) in approximately 7% of AML patients. Patients carrying the FLT3-ITD but not the FLT3-TKD mutation have a significantly worse prognosis. Therefore, both FLT3 mutations seem to exert different biologic functions. FLT3-ITD but not FLT3-TKD has been shown to induce robust activation of the STAT5 signaling pathway. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms leading to differential STAT5 activation and show that FLT3-ITD but not FLT3-TKD uses SRC to activate STAT5. Coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down experiments revealed an exclusive interaction between SRC but not other Src family kinases and FLT3-ITD, which is mediated by the SRC SH2 domain. We identified tyrosines 589 and 591 of FLT3-ITD to be essential for SRC binding and subsequent STAT5 activation. Using site-specific Abs, we found that both residues were significantly more strongly phosphorylated in FLT3-ITD compared with FLT3-TKD. SRC inhibition and knock-down blocked STAT5 activation and proliferation induced by FLT3-ITD but not by FLT3-TKD. We conclude that SRC might be a therapeutic target in FLT3-ITD(+) AML.",

The protein was constitutively phosphorylated in all cases analysed. Polymerase chain reaction detected no internal tandem duplication or point mutations. The signal transduction apparatus, after stimulation with the specific ligand, was preserved. We then investigated the effect of specific FLT3 inhibition on signal transduction and survival. The PKC412 inhibitor specifically inhibited ligand-induced phosphorylation; the same inhibitor reduced the survival of leukaemic cells when compared with untreated cells.

In total, 7 different chromosomes were involved with 7q and 11q each affected in 10% of aCML cases.

Most variants were missense substitutions in the RING or linker domains that abrogated CBL ubiquitin ligase activity and conferred a proliferative advantage to 32D cells overexpressing FLT3.

C57BL/6 mice were sensitized and subsequently exposed to ovalbumin (OVA) on 5 consecutive days. Newly produced cells were labeled with a thymidine analog. Clonogenic activity and interleukin 5 (IL-5) release from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALf) CD34(+) cells were evaluated by using cell-culture techniques.

CD34(+)/IL-5R alpha(+) cells in the first stage of cell differentiation were found only in BM, arguing that early commitment of CD34(+) cells into the eosinophil lineage is restricted to the BM compartment. Allergen exposure induces a shift in differentiation of BM, blood, and BALf eosinophillineage-committed CD34(+) cells toward mature eosinophils and recruitment of these cells via blood into airway.

The first subset was CD25(-) and more than 90% expressed either flt3, IL-7Ralpha, or both. The CD25(-)LSK(-) population had T cell, B cell, and NK cell potential in vivo, and most of this activity was localized in the flt3(+) subset, irrespective of the expression of IL-7Ralpha. Although lymphoid potential of flt3(+)LSK(-) cells in vivo was 3-fold lower than that of lin(-)Sca1(low)kit(low)IL7Ralpha(+) common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs), their cloning efficiency in vitro was 10-fold lower than that of CLPs. Furthermore, although the myeloid potential of flt3(+)LSK(-) cells was 10-fold lower than that of CLPs in the absence of M-CSF, the relative myeloid potential of both populations was similar in its presence. These observations suggest differential growth factor requirements of both populations. The second subset of LSK(-) cells was homogeneously CD25(+)flt3(-)IL7Ralpha(+) and could be generated from both CD25(-)LSK(-) cells and from CLPs, but did not engraft in immunodeficient Rag1(-/-) or Rag1(-/-)gamma(c)(-/-) hosts.

Using peptide-based CXCR4 inhibitors derived from the chemokine viral macrophage inflammatory protein II, we tested the hypothesis that the inhibition of CXCR4 increases sensitivity to chemotherapy by interfering with stromal/leukemia cell interactions. First, leukemic cells expressing varying amounts of surface CXCR4 were examined for their chemotactic response to SDF-1alpha or stromal cells, alone or in the presence of different CXCR4 inhibitors. Results showed that the polypeptide RCP168 had the strongest antagonistic effect on the SDF-1alpha- or stromal cell-induced chemotaxis of leukemic cells. Furthermore, RCP168 blocked the binding of anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody 12G5 to surface CXCR4 in a concentration-dependent manner and inhibited SDF-1alpha-induced AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation. Finally, RCP168 significantly enhanced chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in stroma-cocultured Jurkat, primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and in a subset of acute myelogenous leukemia cells harboring Flt3 mutation. Equivalent results were obtained with the small-molecule CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3465. Our data therefore suggest that the SDF-1alpha/CXCR4 interaction contributes to the resistance of leukemia cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Disruption of these interactions by the peptide CXCR4 inhibitor RCP168 represents a novel strategy for targeting leukemic cells within the bone marrow microenvironment.",

Treatment of JEA2 cells with interleukin (IL)-7 induces CBLB phosphorylation as well. FL and IL-7, respectively, induce and increase association of tyrosine-phosphorylated SHC and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase with CBLB. In these cells, CBLB constitutively binds the GRB2 adaptor predominantly through its N-terminal SH3 domain, to form a complex that is distinct from the GRB2.CBL and GRB2.SOS1 complexes.

        "Doc_abstract":"Several trends are emerging in the treatment and investigation of acute leukemia in adults; in this review both of these aspects are addressed. Chemotherapy forms the mainstay of treatment for acute myeloblastic leukemia. In the past year, groups reported on the value of dose intensification in patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia under the age of 60 years and on the role of intensive chemotherapy combined with growth factors in the treatment of elderly patients. Similarly, the role of autologous bone marrow transplantation for older patients has been studied. Improvements in the treatment of patients with acute leukemia are likely to come from a recognition and understanding of the biologic attributes of the leukemic cell. Failure to cure leukemia is likely due to failure to eradicate the leukemic clone. Mechanisms of drug resistance acting before the drug reaches its target (proximal resistance) and after the drug interacts with its target (distal resistance) are gaining greater importance in understanding treatment failures. Advances have been made in identifying new mechanisms that are involved in proximal as well as distal drug resistance. Genetic changes both at the cytogenetic and the molecular level identify different FAB subgroups and groups of patients with good and bad prognostic features. Finally, reports are reviewed of two new factors that stimulate the growth of acute myeloblastic leukemia cells (thrombopoietin and Flt3 ligand) and a factor that inhibits the autocrine growth characteristics of acute myeloblastic leukemia cells (interleukin-10). The results of these interface and basic studies offer the hope of identifying groups of patients with different therapeutic needs and suggest ways to develop therapies aimed at the biology of the leukemic cell.",

In lymphoid malignancies the highlight has been the introduction of rituximab, with significant improvements in the management of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The last 10 years has experienced a rapidly expanding interest and acceptance that leukaemic stem cells, including an improved ability to target them, may hold the key to improved response and reduced relapse rates across both myeloid and lymphoid disease.

We examined its effect on differentiation, proliferation, and gene expression in primary human CD34+ hematopoietic cells. Colony-forming cell (CFC) assays in semisolid medium combined with morphologic examination and flow cytometric immunophenotyping revealed that NUP98-HOXA9 increased the numbers of erythroid precursors and impaired both myeloid and erythroid differentiation. In continuous liquid culture, cells transduced with NUP98-HOXA9 exhibited a biphasic growth curve with initial growth inhibition followed by enhanced long-term proliferation, suggesting an increase in the numbers of primitive self-renewing cells. This was confirmed by a dramatic increase in the numbers of long-term culture-initiating cells, the most primitive hematopoietic cells detectable in vitro. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of NUP98-HOXA9 on hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation, oligonucleotide microarray analysis was done at several time points over 16 days, starting at 6 hours posttransduction. The early growth suppression was preceded by up-regulation of IFNbeta1 and accompanied by marked up-regulation of IFN-induced genes, peaking at 3 days posttransduction. In contrast, oncogenes such as homeobox transcription factors, FLT3, KIT, and WT1 peaked at 8 days or beyond, coinciding with increased proliferation. In addition, several putative tumor suppressors and genes associated with hematopoietic differentiation were repressed at later time points. These findings provide a comprehensive picture of the changes in proliferation, differentiation, and global gene expression that underlie the leukemic transformation of human hematopoietic cells by NUP98-HOXA9.",

Intervening in aberrant signaling pathway provides a rational approach for in vivo targeting of AML cells. Constitutive NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity was observed in 16 of 22 (73%) investigated AML cases and was, in general, associated with resistance to spontaneous apoptosis. Indeed, inhibition of NF-kappaB activity by the NF-kappaB inhibitor SN-50 peptide resulted in enhanced chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. In the majority of cases, constitutive NF-kappaB activity was mediated by a Ras/PI3 kinase (PI3-K)/protein kinase B (PKB)-mediated pathway. The PI3-K inhibitor Ly294002 and the Ras inhibitor L-744832 both inhibited PKB phosphorylation and NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity. The constitutive activation of Ras GTP-ase was caused by mutations in the gene encoding for N-Ras in 29% of the cases. The constitutive NF-kappaB activity could so far not be ascribed to the autocrine production of growth factors or to mutations in the Flt3 receptor, since anti-GM-CSF, -IL-1, -IL6, -TNFalpha or the tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1296 did not affect the NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity.

Both FLT3 mutations (internal tandem duplications and codon 835/836 kinase domain mutations) and increased white cell count at diagnosis were associated with inferior overall survival, but in multivariate analyses only FLT3 mutations remained significant (hazard ratio 6.647, P=0.005). Maintenance therapy was significantly associated with improved remission duration (hazard ratio 0.281, P<0.001) and disease-free survival (hazard ratio 0.290, P<0.001).;The combination of all-trans-retinoic acid and just two cycles of idarubicin followed by triple maintenance produced durable remissions in most patients, but patients with high-risk disease, especially those with FLT3 mutations, require additional agents or alternative treatment approaches. The significant reduction in relapse seen after the addition of maintenance to the protocol supports a role for maintenance in the context of relatively low chemotherapy exposure during consolidation.

The development of FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) is a promising strategy, but resistance that arises during the course of treatment caused by secondary mutations within the mutated gene itself poses a significant challenge. In an effort to predict FLT3 resistance mutations that might develop in patients, we used saturation mutagenesis of FLT3/ITD followed by selection of transfected cells in FLT3 TKI. We identified F621L, A627P, F691L and Y842C mutations in FLT3/ITD that confer varying levels of resistance to FLT3 TKI. Western blotting confirmed that some FLT3 TKI were ineffective at inhibiting FLT3 autophosphorylation and signaling through MAP kinase, STAT5 and AKT in some mutants. Balb/c mice transplanted with the FLT3/ITD Y842C mutation confirmed resistance to sorafenib in vivo but not to lestaurtinib. These results indicate a growing number of FLT3 mutations that are likely to be encountered in patients. Such knowledge, combined with known remaining sensitivity to other FLT3 TKI, will be important to establish as secondary drug treatments that can be substituted when these mutants are encountered.",

Leukemic cells in patients with myeloid neoplasms can differentiate into DCs in vivo (referred to as in vivo leukemic DCs), which are postulated to affect anti-leukemia immune responses. We established a reproducible culture system of in vitro FLT3 ligand-mediated DC (FL-DC) differentiation from murine lineage(-) Sca-1(+) c-Kit(high) cells (LSKs), which made it possible to analyse the effects of target genes on steady-state DC differentiation from hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Using this system, we analysed the effects of various myeloid neoplasm-related gene abnormalities, termed class I and class II mutations, on FL-DC differentiation from LSKs. All class II mutations uniformly impaired FL-DC differentiation maintaining a plasmacytoid DC (pDC)/conventional DC (cDC) ratio comparable to the control cells. In contrast, class I mutations differentially affected FL-DC differentiation from LSKs. FLT3-ITD and a constitutively active form of Ras (CA-N-Ras) yielded more FL-DCs than the control, whereas the other class I mutations tested yielded less FL-DCs. Both FLT3-ITD and FLT3-tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutation showed a comparable pDC/cDC ratio as the control. CA-N-Ras, c-Kit-TKD, TEL/PDGFRβ, and FIP1L1/PDGFRα showed a severe decrease in the pDC/cDC ratio. CA-STAT5 and CA-MEK1 severely inhibited pDC differentiation. FLT3-ITD, CA-N-Ras, and TEL/PDGFRβ aberrantly induced programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1)-expressing DCs. In conclusion, we have established a simple, efficient, and reproducible in vitro FL-DC differentiation system from LSKs.

Numerous studies have implicated Lyn in growth factor receptor signal amplification, while a number also suggest that Lyn participates in negative regulation of growth factor signaling. Indeed Lyn-deficient mice are hyper-responsive to myeloid growth factors and develop a myeloproliferative disorder that predisposes the mice to macrophage tumours, with loss of negative regulation through SHP-1 and SHIP-1 thought to be the major contributing factor to this phenotype.

In response to MCMV infection in vivo, delayed NK cell activation was observed, but no intrinsic defects in NK cell activation or function were identified. Rather, coculture experiments demonstrated that NK cells are suboptimally activated by wmfl DCs, which showed impaired cytokine production in response to MCMV or synthetic TLR7 and TLR9 ligands. The wmfl mutation was identified in the gene encoding the Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3). Flt3 ligand (Flt3L) is transiently induced in the serum upon infection or TLR activation. However, antibody blockade reveals no acute requirement for Flt3L, suggesting that the Flt3L --> Flt3 axis programs the development of DCs, making them competent to support NK effector function.

However, their precise roles and potential interactions in promoting early lymphoid commitment and development remain unclear. Here we show that most if not all murine Lin(-/lo)Sca1(+)c-kit(+) bone marrow (BM) cells generating B220(+)CD19(+) proB-cells in response to FL and interleukin-7 (IL-7) also have a myeloid potential. In contrast to FL + IL-7, KL + IL-7 could not promote proB-cell formation from Lin(-/lo)Sca1(+)c-kit(+) cells. However, KL potently enhanced FL + IL-7-stimulated proB-cell formation, in part through enhanced recruitment of FL + IL-7-unresponsive Lin(-/lo)Sca1(+)c-kit(+) progenitors, and in part by enhancing the growth of proB-cells. The enhanced recruitment (4-fold) in response to KL occurred exclusively from the Lin(-/lo)Sca1(+)c-kit(+)flt3(-) long-term repopulating stem cell population, whereas KL had no effect on FL + IL-7-stimulated recruitment of Lin(-/lo)Sca1(+)c-kit(+)flt3(+) short-term repopulating cells. The progeny of FL + IL-7-stimulated Lin(-/lo)Sca1(+)c-kit(+) cells lacked in vitro and in vivo myeloid potential, but efficiently reconstituted both B and T lymphopoiesis. In agreement with this FL, but not KL, efficiently induced expression of B220 and IL-7 receptor-alpha on Lin(-/lo)Sca1(+)c-kit(+)flt3(+) cells.

Oncogenic mutations of RAS pathway genes (NRAS, KRAS, FLT3, n=4) and deactivating mutations of major epigenetic regulators (CREBBP, EP300, each n=2 and ARID4B, EZH2, MACROD2, MLL2, each n=1) were prominent in these cases and virtually absent in non-recurrent cases (n=6) or other pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases (n=18). In relapse nucleotide variations were detected in cell fate determining transcription factors (GLIS1, AKNA). Structural genomic alterations affected genes regulating B-cell development (IKZF1, PBX1, RUNX1). Eleven novel translocations involved the genes ART4, C12orf60, MACROD2, TBL1XR1, LRRN4, KIAA1467, and ELMO1/MIR1200. Typically, patients harbored only single structural variations, except for one patient who displayed massive rearrangements in the context of a germline tumor suppressor TP53 mutation and a Li-Fraumeni syndrome-like family history. Another patient harbored a germline mutation in the DNA repair factor ATM. In summary, the relapse patients of our cohort were characterized by somatic mutations affecting the RAS pathway, epigenetic and developmental programs and germline mutations in DNA repair pathways.

Within the bone marrow progenitor compartment, PU.1 is highly expressed in the hematopoietic stem cell, the common lymphoid progenitor, and a proportion of common myeloid progenitors (CMPs). Based on Flt3 and PU.1 expression, the CMP could be divided into three subpopulations, Flt3(+) PU.1(hi), Flt3(-) PU.1(hi), and Flt3(-) PU.1(lo) CMPs. Colony-forming assays and in vivo lineage reconstitution demonstrated that the Flt3(+) PU.1(hi) and Flt3(-) PU.1(hi) CMPs were efficient precursors for granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMPs), whereas the Flt3(-) PU.1(lo) CMPs were highly enriched for committed megakaryocyte/erythrocyte progenitors (MEPs). CMPs have been shown to rapidly differentiate into GMPs and MEPs in vitro. Interestingly, short-term culture revealed that the Flt3(+) PU.1(hi) and Flt3(-) PU.1(hi) CMPs rapidly became CD16/32(high) (reminiscent of GMPs) in culture, whereas the Flt3(-) PU.1(lo) CMPs were the immediate precursors of the MEP.

We have examined the action of flt3/flk2 ligand (FL) on physiologic suppression of self-renewal during growth factor-induced differentiation of M1 leukemic cells. Unstimulated M1 cells expressed high levels of flt3 receptor mRNA and protein, with approximately 20,000 molecules present at the cell surface. Consistent with data obtained from normal macrophage populations, expression of both mRNA and protein for flt3 receptor was suppressed as cells were induced to differentiate into mature macrophages in response to leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Although FL alone had no detectable action on unstimulated M1 cells, an effect was revealed during LIF-induced differentiation. FL overcame LIF-induced suppression in clonal cultures of M1 cells, prevented morphologic changes associated with macrophage differentiation and interfered with the LIF-induced responsiveness of M1 cells to macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). This action of FL was evident on both parental M1 cells and M1 cells whose differentiation program was perturbed by enforced expression of the transcription factor SCL. The action of FL was most striking in clone transfer experiments in which FL rescued M1 cells from LIF-induced suppression of self-renewal. The ability of FL to maintain self-renewal characteristics satisfies one of the criteria predicted for a stem-cell-active molecule and contrasts with the action of FL in stimulating proliferation and differentiation of normal hematopoietic cells.",

The frequency and activity of osteoclast progenitors (OCPs) correspond to arthritis severity, and may be used to monitor disease progression and bone resorption, indicating the need for detailed characterization of the discrete OCP subpopulations. Collectively, current studies suggest that the most potent murine bone marrow OCP population can be identified among lymphoid negative population within the immature myeloid lineage cells, as B220(-)CD3(-)CD11b(-/lo)CD115(+)CD117(+)CX3CR1(+) and possibly also Ter119(-)CD11c(-)CD135(lo)Ly6C(+)RANK(-).

In addition, we reviewed cytokines and chemokines which, directly or indirectly, activate OCPs and enhance their differentiation potential, thus mediating osteoresorption.

We demonstrate here how our network-based deconvolution approach, named target addiction score (TAS), provides insights into the functional importance of druggable protein targets in cell-based drug sensitivity testing experiments. Using cancer cell line profiling data sets, we constructed a functional classification across 107 cancer cell models, based on their common and unique target addiction signatures. The pan-cancer addiction correlations could not be explained by the tissue of origin, and only correlated in part with molecular and genomic signatures of the heterogeneous cancer cells. The TAS-based cancer cell classification was also shown to be robust to drug response data resampling, as well as predictive of the transcriptomic patterns in an independent set of cancer cells that shared similar addiction signatures with the 107 cancers. The critical protein targets identified by the integrated approach were also shown to have clinically relevant mutation frequencies in patients with various cancer subtypes, including not only well-established pan-cancer genes, such as PTEN tumor suppressor, but also a number of targets that are less frequently mutated in specific cancer types, including ABL1 oncoprotein in acute myeloid leukemia. An application to leukemia patient primary cell models demonstrated how the target deconvolution approach offers functional insights into patient-specific addiction patterns, such as those indicative of their receptor-type tyrosine-protein kinase FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) status and co-addiction partners, which may lead to clinically actionable, personalized drug treatment developments. To promote its application to the future drug testing studies, we have made available an open-source implementation of the TAS calculation in the form of a stand-alone R package. ",

Cells amplified 2000-fold were then stained with Hoechst 33342, separated into G(0)/G(1) (72% +/- 3%) or S/G(2)/M (27% +/- 3%) fractions by flow sorting, and injected into lethally irradiated mice. Although long-term (more than 6 months) engraftment of lymphoid and myeloid lineages was greater in primary and secondary recipients of expanded cells residing in G(0)/G(1) at the time of transplantation, there were no noted differences in the short-term (less than 6 weeks) recovery kinetics of circulating blood cells. When hematopoietic cells were expanded in cultures containing the tetrapeptide stem cell inhibitor N-Acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro (AcSDKP) to reduce progenitor cycling prior to transplantation, again there were no differences observed in short-term reconstitution by inhibited or uninhibited cells. Interestingly, AcSDKP significantly accelerated engraftment by expanded hematopoietic cells when administered in vivo at the time of transplantation. Leukocytes recovered to 20% of normal levels approximately 1 week faster, and thrombocytopenia was largely abrogated in AcSDKP-treated versus untreated mice. Therefore, while AcSDKP can accelerate the engraftment of ex vivo expanded hematopoietic progenitors, which suggests a relatively simple approach to improve their clinical utility, its effects appear unrelated to cell cycle arrest.

The precise mechanisms by which these interactions regulate B cell differentiation are currently unknown. Flt3 ligand (FL) is a growth factor which stimulates the proliferation of stem cells and early progenitors. Mice deficient for the FLT3 receptor exhibit severe reductions in early B lymphoid progenitors. We have previously described a clonal assay in vitro which allows us to follow the entire B cell differentiation pathway from uncommitted progenitors to mature, immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells. The growth factor combination of interleukin (IL)-11, mast cell growth factor (MGF) and IL-7 was shown to maintain the differentiation of these hematopoietic precursors into B cell progenitors capable of giving rise to functionally mature B cells in secondary cultures. Here, we show that FL in combination with IL-11 and IL-7 is sufficient to support the differentiation of uncommitted progenitors from day 10 yolk sac (AA4.1+) or day 12 fetal liver (AA4.1+ B220- Mac-1- Sca-1+) into the B lineage. The frequency of B cell progenitors obtained in these conditions was similar, if not better, than the frequency of B cell precursors that arose when cultured in IL-11+MGF+IL-7. Furthermore, the growth factor combination of IL-11+FL+ IL-7 was able to maintain the potential of bipotent precursors giving rise to both the B and myeloid lineages in secondary cultures. We also show that FL synergizes with IL-7 in the proliferation of committed B220+ pro-B cells and may contribute to the maintenance of an earlier pro-B cell population. Together, these results show that FL is important in supporting the differentiation and proliferation of early B cell progenitors in vitro.",

The myeloid Ags CD11b, F4/80, and Ly-6C are predominantly expressed by population C, but not D or E. In addition, a subset of population C-type DC expresses 33D1 and CD4.

Immunohistology indicates that the different DC subsets reside in distinct microenvironments, with populations D and E residing in the T cell areas of the white pulp, while DC within population C localize in the marginal zones. These DC subpopulations showed different capacities to phagocytose FITC-zymosan and to secrete IL-12 upon stimulation with Staphylococcus aureus cowan I strain + IFN-gamma + granulocyte-macrophage-CSF. Population C-type DC were more phagocytic but secreted little inducible IL-12 while population D- and E-type DC showed poor phagocytic capacity and secreted considerably higher levels of IL-12.

Activated alleles of FES are potent inducers of myeloid differentiation, however FES-deficient mice have only subtle differences in hematopoiesis. This may reflect overlapping function of other kinases such as FER. Studies of FES- and FER-deficient mice have revealed more prominent roles in regulating the activation of mature innate immune cells, including macrophages and mast cells. Recently, new insights into regulation of FES/FER kinases has emerged with the characterization of their N-terminal phospholipid-binding and membrane targeting FER/CIP4 homology-Bin/Amphyphysin/Rvs (F-BAR) and F-BAR extension (FX) domains. The F-BAR/FX domains regulate subcellular localization and FES/FER kinase activation. FES kinase activity is also enhanced upon ligand binding to its SH2 domain, which may lead to further phosphorylation of the same ligand, or other ligand-associated proteins. In mast cells, SH2 ligands of FES/FER include KIT receptor PTK, and the high affinity IgE receptor (FceRI) that trigger rapid activation of FES/FER and signaling to regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking. Recently, FES/FER have also been implicated in growth and survival signaling in leukemias driven by oncogenic KIT and FLT3 receptors. With further definition of their roles in immune cells and their progenitors, FES/FER may emerge as relevant therapeutic targets in inflammatory diseases and leukemias.",

We performed integrative analysis of whole-genome, whole-exome, custom capture, whole-transcriptome (RNA-seq), and locus-specific genomic assays across nine time points from a patient with primary de novo B-ALL. Comprehensive genome and transcriptome characterization revealed a dramatic tumor evolution during progression, yielding a tumor with complex clonal architecture at second relapse. We observed and validated point mutations in EP300 and NF1, a highly expressed EP300-ZNF384 gene fusion, a microdeletion in IKZF1, a focal deletion affecting SETD2, and large deletions affecting RB1, PAX5, NF1, and ETV6. Although the genome analysis revealed events of potential biological relevance, no clinically actionable treatment options were evident at the time of the second relapse. However, transcriptome analysis identified aberrant overexpression of the targetable protein kinase encoded by the FLT3 gene. Although the patient had refractory disease after salvage therapy for the second relapse, treatment with the FLT3 inhibitor sunitinib rapidly induced a near complete molecular response, permitting the patient to proceed to a matched-unrelated donor stem cell transplantation. The patient remains in complete remission more than 4 years later. Analysis of this patient's relapse genome revealed an unexpected, actionable therapeutic target that led to a specific therapy associated with a rapid clinical response. For some patients with relapsed or refractory cancers, this approach may indicate a novel therapeutic intervention that could alter outcome. ",

It may still be possible to improve remission induction treatment eg by intensifying the Ara-C dose although may this only be detectable in an improved disease free survival. The is to reduce relapse. The risk main challenge is pre-determined by a number of powerful risk factors. In the experience of the MRC age, cytogenetics and clearance of blasts from the bone marrow after course 1. Using the later two in combination good risk patients (FAB M3, t(8;21) t(15;17) inv(16)) have a relapse risk of 32%. Poor risk (blasts >15% after course 1 or abnormalities of Chs 5 or 7, 3q- and complex changes have a relapse risk of 82%. All other cases are standard risk and ve a relapse risk of 56%. FLT3 mutations have been detected in about 25% of cases and provide additional negative predictive value overall and within each risk group. The assessment of the most effective consolidation treatment must be made taking into account the heterogeneity of the relapse risk. The MRC investigated the role of allo and autoBMT in addition to intensive chemotherapy. The data was analysis on an intent-to-treat or donor vs no donor basis. Although both types of transplant were able to reduce relapse overall and in all risk groups, there was an overall survival advantage only in standard risk patients. Since chemotherapy has improved since this study, there remains uncertainty about the benefit of transplant in all risk groups. Overall this experience has demonstrated that relapse can be reduced with more therapy. It is probable that the limits of conventional chemotherapy have been reached. The new AML15 trial will assess the value of adding the immunoconjugate (Mylotarg) to induction and/or chemotherapy. Improvements in older patients have been less detectable. MRC trials over the last 20 years show an improvement in remission rate (now 65%) but persistent poor survival (12% at 5 years). In the MRC AML11 Trial three induction schedules were compared (DAT vs ADE vs MAC) with DAT being superior. A comparison of a total of 3 vs 6 courses of treatment or the addition of interferon maintenance did not improve results.

These differences can determine the fate of the T cells they activate. Several subsets of mature DCs have been described in both mouse and human and the developmental processes of these specialized DC subsets have been studied extensively. The original concept that all DCs were of myeloid origin was questioned by several recent studies, which demonstrated that in addition to the DCs derived from myeloid precursors, some DCs could also be efficiently generated from lymphoid-restricted precursors. Moreover, it has been shown recently that both conventional DCs and pDCs can be generated by the Flt3 expressing hemopoietic progenitors regardless of their myeloid- or lymphoid-origin.

However, plastic adherent cultures elaborated from murine bone marrow are an admixture of fibroblastoid and hematopoietic cell types. Here we report a reliable method based on immunodepletion to fractionate fibroblastoid cells from hematopoietic cells within plastic adherent murine marrow cultures. The immunodepleted cells expressed the antigens Sca-1, CD29, CD44, CD81, CD106, and the stem cell marker nucleostemin (NST) but not CD11b, CD31, CD34, CD45, CD48, CD90, CD117, CD135, or the transcription factor Oct-4. They were also capable of differentiating into adipocytes, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts in vitro as well as osteoblasts/osteocytes in vivo. Therefore, immunodepletion yields a cell population devoid of hematopoietic and endothelial cells that is phenotypically and functionally equivalent to MSCs. The immunodepleted cells exhibited a population doubling time of approximately 5-7 days in culture. Poor growth was due to the dramatic down regulation of many genes involved in cell proliferation and cell cycle progression as a result of immunodepletion. Exposure of immunodepleted cells to fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) but not insulin-like growth factor (IGF), murine stem cell factor, or leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) significantly increased their growth rate. Moreover, 82% of the transcripts down regulated by immunodepletion remain unaltered in the presence of FGF2. Exposure to the later also reversibly inhibited the ability of the immunodepleted cells to differentiate into adipocytes, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts in vitro.

Multiplex cytokine profiling revealed production of an array of proinflammatory cytokines and type 1 IFN (IFN-α) by FL-DCs treated with virus. Virus-matured FL-DCs stimulated proliferation of autologous CD3(+) T cells as shown by intracellular nuclear Ki67 staining and produced IFN-γ when cultured with infected FL-DCs. Gene expression studies using type 1 IFN-specific and DC-specific arrays revealed upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes, most cytokines, and transcription factors, but a distinct downregulation of many chemokines.

ARG is a widely expressed tyrosine kinase that shares substantial sequence identity with c-ABL in the kinase domain and cooperates with ABL to regulate neurulation in the developing mouse embryo. As described here, ARG has recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of leukemia as a fusion partner of TEL. A TEL/ARG fusion was constructed to determine whether ARG can be inhibited by STI571. When expressed in the factor-dependent murine hematopoietic cell line Ba/F3, the TEL/ARG protein was heavily phosphorylated on tyrosine, increased tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular proteins, and induced factor-independent proliferation. The effects of STI571 on Ba/F3 cells transformed with BCR/ABL, TEL/ABL, TEL/PDGFbetaR, or TEL/ARG were then compared. STI571 inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation and cell growth of Ba/F3 cells expressing BCR/ABL, TEL/ABL, TEL/PDGFbetaR, and TEL/ARG with an IC(50) of approximately 0.5 microM in each case, but it had no effect on untransformed Ba/F3 cells growing in IL-3 or on Ba/F3 cells transformed by TEL/JAK2.

Because DC play a pivotal role in the induction of immune responses, we evaluated the effects of FL in the augmentation of anti-tumor immune responses in vivo. Treatment with daily subcutaneous injections of FL not only caused complete regression of tumors in a significant proportion of mice challenged with a syngeneic methylcholanthrene-induced fibrosarcoma, but also caused a significant decrease in the tumor growth rate in the remaining mice. The effects of FL were both dose and schedule dependent, induced regression of tumors established as much as 7 days prior to beginning cytokine treatment, and was mediated by both T-cell mediated and non-T cell-mediated mechanisms. Histopathologic evaluation of tumors during and after systemic treatment with FL revealed a dense infiltration of mononuclear and myeloid precursor cells into both the tumor and tissue surrounding the tumor that generally correlated with the degree of regression and resolved after rejection of the tumor. Collectively, the data suggest that FL may be an important cytokine in the generation of effective anti-tumor immune responses in vivo and the treatment of cancer in situ.",

Prior studies demonstrated that approximately half of these patients had genomic lesions leading to CRLF2 overexpression, with half of such cases harboring somatic mutations in the Janus kinases JAK1 and JAK2. To determine whether mutations in other tyrosine kinases might also occur in ALL, we sequenced the tyrosine kinome and downstream signaling genes in 45 high-risk pediatric ALL cases with either a Ph-like gene expression profile or other alterations suggestive of activated kinase signaling. Aside from JAK mutations and 1 FLT3 mutation, no somatic mutations were found in any other tyrosine kinases, suggesting that alternative mechanisms are responsible for activated kinase signaling in high-risk ALL.",

We report here that highly enriched human B cell progenitors can be consistently generated from CD34+CD38- cord blood cells using long-term culture on the murine stromal line, S17, in the absence of added cytokines. After 6-8 weeks, cell numbers increased up to 160-fold, and cultures contained > 80-90% CD10+CD19+ B progenitors. Consistent with previous reports describing delayed myeloid cell differentiation from CD34+CD38- cells, production of B cell progenitors from CD34+CD38- cord blood cells was delayed 2-4 weeks relative to cultures initiated with either CD34+CD38bright or CD34+CD38dim progenitors. Addition of Flt3 ligand to long-term cultures resulted in a 2-3-fold greater increase in the number of CD19+ cells generated after 4-8 weeks.

Using an Mysm1 knockout (Mysm1(-/-)) mouse model, we identified the histone H2A deubiquitinase Mysm1, as a critical regulator in DC differentiation. Mysm1(-/-) mice showed a global reduction of DCs in lymphoid organs, whereas development of granulocytes and macrophages were not severely affected. Hematopoietic progenitors and DC precursors were significantly decreased in Mysm1(-/-) mice and defective in Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3(Flt3) ligand-induced, but not in granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-induced DC differentiation in vitro. Molecular studies demonstrated that the developmental defect of DCs from common myeloid progenitor (CMP) in Mysm1(-/-) mice is associated with decreased Flt3 expression and that Mysm1 derepresses transcription of the Flt3 gene by directing histone modifications at the Flt3 promoter region. Two molecular mechanisms were found to be responsible for the selective role of Mysm1 in lineage determination of DCs from CMPs: the selective expression of Mysm1 in a subset of CMPs and the different requirement of Mysm1 for PU.1 recruitment to the Flt3 locus vs GM-CSF-α and macrophage-colony-stimulating factor receptor loci. In conclusion, this study reveals an essential role of Mysm1 in epigenetic regulation of Flt3 transcription and DC development, and it provides a novel mechanism for lineage determination from CMP.

They are highly effective in immunotherapy. However, in lymphoid and other tissues, DCs constitute only a small population and are difficult to isolate in large numbers. Our objective was to devise a method with which to rapidly expand splenic DCs in vivo. We accomplished this by intramuscular injection of plasmids encoding mouse granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and fms-like tyrosine kinase 3-ligand (FLT3-L). Gene transfer was amplified by electroporation. Both cytokine vectors significantly increased DC numbers, but they were more effective in combination. When either control plasmid (Blank), or FLT3-L or GM-CSF expression plasmids were injected individually, the mean numbers of CD11c(+)/MHC II(+) DCs in spleen cell suspensions were, respectively, 6, 11, and 23 million. When FLT3-L and GM-CSF plasmids were codelivered, this increased to 36 million. Peak levels occurred 7 days postinjection of DNA. To further characterize these DCs, we stained them with myeloid (CD11b, F4/80)- and lymphoid (CD8alpha)-related markers. FLT3-L cDNA favored lymphoid DC expansion and GM-CSF cDNA favored myeloid DC expansion, whereas combined treatment expanded both types with a myeloid predominance. We confirm the ability of these DCs to present antigen to CD4(+) T cells and to stimulate in mixed lymphocyte cultures. We demonstrate that DCs can be rapidly expanded by this simple gene transfer method, which has numerous potential applications.",

Because the cellular microenvironment can protect CLL cells from drug-induced apoptosis, it is important to evaluate the effect of novel drugs in this context. Here we characterized the in vitro cytotoxic effects of sorafenib on CLL cells and the underlying mechanism in the presence of marrow stromal cells (MSCs) and nurselike cells (NLCs). One single dose of 10 μmol/L or the repeated addition of 1 μmol/L sorafenib caused caspase-dependent apoptosis and reduced levels of phosphorylated B-RAF, C-RAF, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1) in CLL cells in the presence of the microenvironment. We show that the RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/ERK pathway can modulate Mcl-1 expression and contribute to CLL cell viability, thereby associating so-rafenib cytotoxicity to its impact on RAF and Mcl-1. To evaluate if the other targets of sorafenib can affect CLL cell viability and contribute to sorafenib-mediated cytotoxicity, we tested the sensitivity of CLL cells to several kinase inhibitors specific for these targets. Our data show that RAF and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) but not KIT, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) are critical for CLL cell viability. Taken together, our data suggest that sorafenib exerts its cytotoxic effect likely via inhibition of the VEGFR and RAF/MEK/ERK pathways, both of which can modulate Mcl-1 expression in CLL cells. Furthermore, sorafenib induced apoptosis of CLL cells from fludarabine refractory patients in the presence of NLCs or MSCs. Our results warrant further clinical exploration of sorafenib in CLL.",

In this study, we found evidence that arginase 1 (Arg1) is required for the differentiation of mouse dendritic cells (DCs). Expression of Arg1 was robustly induced during monocyte-derived DC differentiation. Ectopic expression of Arg1 significantly promoted monocytic DC differentiation in a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor culture system and also facilitated the differentiation of CD8α(+) conventional DCs in the presence of Flt3 ligand. Knockdown of Arg1 reversed these effects. Mechanistic studies showed that the induced expression of Arg1 in differentiating DCs was caused by enhanced recruitment of histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) to the Arg1 promoter region, which led to a reduction in the acetylation of both the histone 3 and STAT6 proteins and subsequent transcriptional activation of Arg1. Further investigation identified a novel STAT6 binding site within the Arg1 promoter that mediated its regulation by STAT6 and HDAC4. These observations suggest that the cross talk between HDAC4 and STAT6 is an important regulatory mechanism of Arg1 transcription in DCs. Moreover, overexpression of Arg1 clearly abrogated the ability of HDAC inhibitors to suppress DC differentiation. In conclusion, we show that Arg1 is a novel regulator of myeloid DC differentiation.

Delaying use of IL-4 or IL-13 to day 5 led to 25-fold cell expansion with approximately 80% DC, the yield of which was then twofold over that of baseline control cultures, while numbers of other cells decreased. IL-4 and IL-13 had no additive or antagonistic effect on DC generation. The effect of Flt3 ligand (FL), known to enhance proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors induced by other growth factors, was examined next. FL added alone induced DC in the same manner as SCF. Using both FL and SCF throughout the culture period enhanced total cell recovery fourfold above that of baseline control cultures on day 12 compared with > or =2.5-fold if either one was stopped on day 5. When both FL and SCF were used for 12 days, DC recovery was fivefold that of control cultures, whereas it was to three- to 3.5-fold when either one was stopped on day 5. A similar trend was noted for CD15+ cells, and, to a lesser extent, for CD14+ cells. Finally, using SCF and FL for 12 days, with IL-4 or IL-13 added from day 5 onwards, led to comparably enhanced cell yields relative to control cultures with approximately 60% DC. These data underline the need to use appropriate cytokine combinations and schedules to optimize generation of DCs from CD34+ progenitors. Associated with GM-CSF and TNF-alpha, IL-4 or IL-13 promotes differentiation and maturation of DCs over other myeloid cells. Under the same baseline conditions, FL appears to potentiate SCF throughout the culture period, inducing proliferation and development of DC as well as of other myeloid cells.",

Expression of ABL1, ABL2, CSF1R, JAK2, and PDGFRB fusions resulted in cytokine-independent proliferation and activation of phosphorylated STAT5. Cell lines and human leukemic cells expressing ABL1, ABL2, CSF1R, and PDGFRB fusions were sensitive in vitro to dasatinib, EPOR and JAK2 rearrangements were sensitive to ruxolitinib, and the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion was sensitive to crizotinib.;Ph-like ALL was found to be characterized by a range of genomic alterations that activate a limited number of signaling pathways, all of which may be amenable to inhibition with approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

With the exception of eosinophils, all nucleated cell lineages studied were similarly affected in these animals. Experimental animals also exhibited severe anemia and progressive loss of marrow-derived erythropoiesis. All of the FL-overexpressing animals, but none of the controls, died between 10 and 13 weeks posttransplantation. Upon histological examination, severe splenomegaly was noted, with progressive fibrosis and infiltration by abnormal lymphoreticular cells. Abnormal cell infiltration also occurred in other organ systems, including bone marrow and liver. In situ immunocytochemistry on liver sections showed that the cellular infiltrate was CD3+/NLDC145+/CD11c+, but B220- and F4/80-, suggestive of a mixed infiltrate of dendritic cells and activated T lymphocytes. Infiltration of splenic blood vessel perivascular spaces resulted in vascular compression and eventual occlusion, leading to splenic necrosis consistent with infarction.

        "Doc_abstract":"Several genetic and phenotypic characteristics of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) blasts provide relevant targets and the rationale for tailored treatment. These include the PML/RARalpha fusion and the transcription co-repressor complex recruited at the promoter of target genes by the hybrid protein, the intense and homogeneous expression of the CD33 antigen, absence of multidrug resistance-related phenotype, and a frequently mutated and constitutively activated FLT3 receptor. Such genotypic and phenotypic features are targeted by agents currently in use in front-line therapy or at relapse (i.e., retinoids, arsenic trioxide, anthracyclines and anti-CD33 monoclonal antibodies), and by novel agents that may find a place in future treatments such as histone deacetylase and FLT3 inhibitors. The unique PML/RARalpha aberration serves as a molecular marker for rapid diagnosis and prediction of response to ATRA-and ATO-containing therapies. Methods for prompt and low-cost detection of this genetic abnormality, such as the analysis of PML nuclear staining, are extremely useful in clinical practice and could be adopted in countries with limited resources as a surrogate for rapid genetic diagnosis. Finally, PML/RARalpha monitoring through sensitive RT-PCR can be regarded as an integrating part of the overall treatment strategy in this disease, whereby the treatment type and intensity are modulated in patients at different risk of relapse according to RT-PCR status during follow-up. Because recent clinical studies suggest that most APL patients receiving intensive chemotherapy may be over-treated, longitudinal and stringent RT-PCR monitoring is becoming increasingly important to test the extent to which chemotherapy can be minimized in those presenting with low-risk disease.",

Further activation of FL DCs did not restore their stimulatory ability, and FL DCs did not suppress the stimulation of the allogeneic T cells by normal DCs. FL treatment significantly increased the CD8 alpha(+) DC subset, which appeared to be the reason for their poor stimulatory capacity. These observations were confirmed in vivo using a mouse model of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) wherein host DCs play a critical role.

FL and SCF were equally effective in stimulating colony formation in combination with IL-3. However, the tri-factor combination of FL + IL-3 + SCF stimulated 2.3-fold and 2.5-fold more colonies than FL + IL-3 and SCF + IL-3, respectively.

ERα regulates transcription of target genes through two distinct activation functions (AFs), AF-1 and AF-2, whose respective involvement varies in a cell type- or tissue-specific manner. In this study, we investigated the role of ERα AFs in the development and effector functions of inflammatory DCs, steady-state conventional DCs, and plasmacytoid DCs (pDC), using mouse lacking either AF-1 or AF-2. In agreement with previous works, we showed that E2 fostered the differentiation and effector functions of inflammatory DCs through ERα-dependent upregulation of IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-4 in GM-CSF-stimulated myeloid progenitors. Interestingly, whereas AF-1 was required for early IRF-4 upregulation in DC precursors, it was dispensable to enhance IRF-4 expression in differentiated DCs to a level compatible with the development of the more functional Ly6C(-) CD11b(+) DC subset. Presence of E2 had no effect on progenitors from either knock-in mice with 7-aa deletion in helix 12 of ERα, lacking AF-2, or ERα(-/-) mice. By contrast, in Flt3 ligand-driven DC differentiation, activation of AF-1 domain was required to promote the development of more functionally competent conventional DCs and pDCs. Moreover, lack of ERα AF-1 blunted the TLR7-mediated IFN-α response of female pDCs in vivo. Thus, our study demonstrates that ERα uses AF-1 differently in steady-state and inflammatory DC lineages to regulate their innate functions, suggesting that selective ER modulators could be used to target specific DC subsets.",

The evidence for the existence of LSKCD34(+)FLT3(hi) lymphoid-primed MPPs (LMPPs) implicates that a strict separation into common myeloid and lymphoid pathways might not be the first lineage commitment step of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Together with the evidence for existence of common myeloid and common lymphoid progenitors (CMPs and CLPs, respectively), the identification of LMPPs also suggests that at least the granulocyte-macrophage lineage can be generated through alternative pathways. However, the existence of LMPPs has recently been questioned, as there is evidence that at least a fraction of LSKCD34(+)FLT3(hi) cells sustains MkE potential. Thus, in more recent studies we have in more detail compared the molecular signature of adult LMPPs to populations of LSK cells enriched for cells with pluripotent HSC activity. Notably, we have found at the global as well as single-cell level that LMPPs when compared with pluripotent HSCs downregulate the transcriptional priming of genes typically expressed in cells of the MkE lineage, while upregulating early lymphoid genes.

BM from B10 (H2b) mice given FL (10 microg/day; days 0-8; FL-BM) contained a 7-fold higher incidence of potentially tolerogenic immature CD11c+ DC (CD40low, CD80low, CD86low, MHC IIlow) that induced alloantigen-specific T cell hyporesponsiveness in vitro. C3H (H2k) mice received 50 x 106 normal or FL-BM cells (day 0) and tacrolimus (2 mg/kg/day; days 0-12).

Ex vivo splenocyte proliferative and CTL responses and Th1 cytokine (IFN-gamma) production in response to donor alloantigens were augmented by FL-BM infusion, but reduced by tacrolimus. Systemic infusion of purified FL-BM immature DC, equivalent in number to that in corresponding whole BM, confirmed their capacity to sensitize, rather than tolerize, recipient T cells in vivo. In vitro, tacrolimus suppressed GM-CSF-stimulated growth of myeloid DC from normal BM much more effectively than from FL-BM without affecting MHC class II or costimulatory molecule expression. Infusion of normal B10 BM cells at the time of transplant prolonged C3H heart allograft survival, whereas FL-BM cells did not.

FL treatment resulted in a marked expansion in the absolute number of myeloid- and lymphoid-related DCs and a reduction in the proportion of donor splenic T cells. Irradiated recipients who were given splenocytes from FL-treated donors had reduced GVHD lethality compared with controls due to the infusion of fewer mature T cells. Highly purified T cells from FL-treated donors produced comparable in vitro alloresponses and there was no evidence of a skewing toward T-helper type 1 (interleukin [IL]-2, interferon-gamma) or T-helper type 2 (IL-4, IL-10) cytokine production. The GVHD lethality associated with purified T cells obtained from FL-treated or control donors was comparable. In contrast, FL treatment of recipients resulted in a significant increase in GVHD lethality. Increased lethality was observed even when the infusions of allogeneic T cells and FL were delayed until 3 weeks post-bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Our data indicate that FL treatment of donors does not increase GVHD risk, but treatment of recipients increases GVH lethality even if FL treatment is delayed until later post-BMT.",

TGF-beta1 added to CB M-DC cultures induced bona fide DC morphology (TGF-M-DCs), similar to that of DCs generated with TGF-beta and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)/IL-4 (TGF-GM-DCs). Of conditioned media (CM) produced from TGF-M-DCs, TGF-GM-DCs, M-DCs, and GM-DCs, TGF-M-DC CM was the only one that enhanced SCF, Flt3 ligand, and TPO expansion of myeloid progenitor cells ex vivo. This effect was blocked by neutralizing anti-M-CSF Ab, but protein analysis of CM suggested that M-CSF alone was not manifesting enhanced expansion of myeloid progenitors. LPS-stimulated TGF-M-DCs induced T-cell tolerance/anergy as effectively as M-DCs. TGF-M-DCs secreted significantly lower concentrations of progenitor cell inhibitory cytokines and were less potent in activating T cells than TGF-GM-DCs. Functional differences between TGF-M-DCs and TGF-GM-DCs included enhanced responses to LPS-induced ERK, JNK, and P38 activation in TGF-M-DCs and their immune suppressive-skewed cytokine release profiles.

There is evidence that mutated receptor tyrosine kinases of subclass III, for example the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and KIT-protein, are aberrantly localized in human cancers. In order to further analyze this phenomenon, we investigated the localization of FLT3, a subclass III receptor tyrosine kinase frequently mutated in leukemia. By immunofluorescence staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy we found that in retrovirally transduced COS7 cells, wild type FLT3 receptor protein is localized primarily at the cell surface. In contrast, a mutant FLT3 receptor protein with an internal tandem duplication (ITD) accumulates in a perinuclear region and is not detectable at the plasma membrane. Surprisingly, and in contrast to previously published data, intracellular FLT3-ITD accumulation could neither be detected in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) nor in the Golgi apparatus. Furthermore, transient overexpression per se leads to accumulation of wild type FLT3 receptor protein in the ER in addition to surface localization, probably due to inefficient intracellular transport by the overloaded sorting machinery of the secretory pathway. Based on our data and the immature glycosylation pattern of FLT3-ITD, we speculate that the mutant protein resides most probably in an unidentified compartment of the secretory pathway between the ER and the Golgi apparatus.",

The increase in Treg cells was due to enhanced Treg-cell proliferation rather than release of Treg cells from the thymus.

Similar results were obtained when highly purified CD14(+) cells from UCB were cultured with FL and IL-15. In contrast, UCB/CD34(+) cells cultured under the same conditions showed a delayed expression of CD56 and behaved functionally differently in that they exhibited NK but not LAK cytotoxicity and produced significantly fewer cytokines. Kinetic studies on the phenotype of UCB/ACF or UCB/CD14(+) cells cultured in the presence of FL and IL-15 showed a rapid decrease in CD14 expression after day 5, which reached levels of zero by day 20. Approximately 60% of the CD56(+) derived from the UCB/ACF or the UCB/CD14(+) cells coexpressed CD14 by day 5.

Fibrocytes efficiently responded to TLR2, TLR4, and TLR7 ligands as well as to poly (I:C) or viral stimulation by producing high amount of interleukin-6. Upon virus infection of fibrocytes, IFN type I was also induced. When compared to pDC or Flt3 ligand-derived DC, fibrocytes produced 5 times and 60 times more IL-6, respectively. This response was associated with a rapid and efficient translocation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor. Analysis of the expression and functionality of TLR7 in peripheral blood leukocyte subpopulations suggested that this receptor is expressed and functional in a CD163(+) monocytic cell subpopulation containing the fibrocyte precursors.

The anti-leukemic potential of MEK inhibitors is being tested in clinical trials; however, downregulation of MEK1 promotes Eμ-Myc-driven lymphomagenesis and MEK1 ablation induces myeloproliferative disease in mice, raising the concern that MEK inhibitors may be inefficient or counterproductive in this context. We investigated the role of MEK1 in the proliferation of human leukemic cell lines and in retroviral models of leukemia. Our data show that MEK1 suppression via RNA interference and genomic engineering does not affect the proliferation of human leukemic cell lines in culture; similarly, MEK1 ablation does not impact the development of MYC-driven leukemia in vivo. In contrast, MEK1 ablation significantly reduces tumorigenesis driven by Nras alone or in combination with Myc. Thus, while MEK1 restricts proliferation and tumorigenesis in some cellular and genetic contexts, it cannot be considered a tumor suppressor in the context of leukemogenesis.

These \"LTC-ICML\" are inseparable from either standard LTC-IC or cells with long-term in vivo lympho-myeloid repopulating potential (competitive repopulating units, or CRU) present in normal adult mouse marrow but are detected at 15- to 30-fold lower frequencies. To determine whether at least part of this discrepancy is due to a reduced sensitivity of the LTC-ICML assay, a number of strategies to try to improve the original protocol were tested. Prolongation of the second phase of the assay (when the cells are maintained under lymphoid LTC conditions) from 7 to 10 days and inclusion of Flt3 ligand (FL) in the assay used to detect the production of B-lineage cells (CFU-pre-B) increased the average yield of CFU-pre-B per LTC-ICML by a factor of 3- to 20-fold; however, neither of these manipulations increased the frequency of LTC-ICML detected. Similarly, the use of S17 fibroblasts as feeders also did not improve the sensitivity of the LTC-ICML assay. On the other hand, approximately threefold more LTC-ICML could be detected when the initial phase of the assay (when the cells are maintained under myeloid LTC conditions) was shortened from 4 weeks to 1 week. In addition, this latter modification showed the existence in adult mouse marrow of a previously unrecognized, very early B220- stage of lymphoid development characterized by a relative resistance to both 5-fluorouracil and hydrocortisone. The discovery of such cells is of significant interest; however, their presence in adult mouse marrow in numbers comparable to those of both LTC-ICML and myeloid-restricted LTC-IC imposes severe restrictions on the use of the shorter LTC-ICML assay which offset its increased sensitivity. Interestingly, the present studies also show that both LTC-IC and LTC-ICML numbers are significantly better maintained (approximately twofold to sixfold) in myeloid LTC than are CRU. This differential maintenance of LTC-IC and CRU in vitro may be related to the fact that the detection of each of these two functionally defined progenitors involves the use of different ligand receptor systems. Alternatively, it is possible that at least some LTC-IC and CRU may represent developmentally distinct cell types. Taken together, these findings suggest a model of hematopoietic stem cell regulation in which retention of totipotentiality and maintenance of responsiveness to specific regulators may not be tightly linked.",

NK cells, CD10(+)/CD19(+) B-lineage cells and dendritic cells (DC) developed from the same starting population and IL-7, FL, and KL were required in this process. Single cell deposition of 3,872 CD34(+)/Lin-/CD38(-) cells onto AFT024 with IL-7, FL, KL, IL-2, and IL-3 showed that a one time addition of IL-3 at culture initiation was essential for multilineage differentiation from single cells. Single and double lineage progeny were frequently detected, but more importantly, 2% of single cells could give rise to at least three lineages (NK cells, B-lineage cells, and DC or myeloid cells) providing direct evidence that NK and B-lineage differentiation derive from a common lymphomyeloid hematopoietic progenitor under the same conditions. This study provides new insights into the role of the microenvironment niche, which governs the earliest events in lymphoid development.",

Furthermore, there is still no consensus regarding what stage filtering of variants is performed in the bioinformatics pipeline to produce consistent result sets, the extent of filtering and how this is most optimal performed. We hypothesized that combination of coding transcriptome and exomes enables precise identification of both somatic single nucleotide and indel variants early in the bioinformatics process, superseding the need for extensive annotation and validation from external databases. Exome and RNA-sequencing were performed on diagnosis-remission paired bone marrow samples from 5 cytogenetically normal AML, i.e. sequencing of 20 samples in total. Intersection of rare exome and RNA variants, exclusively found in the diagnostic samples, yielded a median of 6 somatic point mutations and small indels, ranging from 3 to 21. Close correlation between routine diagnostic biomarkers was observed in 29/30 laboratory tests, with the exception of a large FLT3 internal tandem repeat, whereas WT1 with nonsense mutation lacked RNA transcripts. Additionally, the assay revealed mutations in DNMT3A, IDH2, TET2 and IL32 frame shift, not encompassed by routine panel. We thus describe a procedure to effectively reduce observations to a focused subset of high specificity. The approach is applicable to precise screening of both putative driver mutations and, often heterogeneous, discrete patient specific somatic combinations.",

The highest activity was exerted by compound 1a possessing methoxy group and mono-substituted pyridyl ring. It exerted 77.83%, 72.90%, and 76.47% inhibitions at 10 µM concentration against RPMI-8226, K-562 leukemia cell lines, and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line, respectively. Its IC50 values against those most three cell lines were 0.174 µM, 1.19 µM, and 4.08 µM, respectively. Compound 1a was further tested against a panel of 16 kinases, many of them are known to be over-expressed in leukemia and breast cancer. The most sensitive kinases were V600E-B-RAF, C-RAF, FLT3, and P38α/MAPK14. The highest potency was exerted against P38α/MAPK14, IC50 was 0.515 µM. Moreover, the ability of compounds 1a, 1b, and 1g to inhibit NO and PGE2 production in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages was also examined.

        "Doc_abstract":"The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab has been less successful in treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) than lymphoma, possibly due to the lower density of CD20 on B lymphocytes from CLL patients than on those from lymphoma patients. This lowering may result from insufficiency of one of the transcription factors of cd20. Of these, purine-rich box-1 (PU.1) is poorly expressed in CLL. To estimate its weight in CD20 expression, pu.1 cDNA was transfected into CLL B cells and shown to raise the membrane expression of CD20 and to improve the rituximab-induced lysis of transfected cells. Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor and all-trans-retinoic acids were not involved in the defective expression of PU.1 or the excessive methylation of the pu.1 gene, because 6 of 14 CLL samples tested were normally methylated. This was confirmed by the failure of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors to restore pu.1 transcription in hypermethylated CLL, and, in fact, the expression of PU.1 was down-regulated by excessive expression of the FMS proto-oncogene-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) receptor. This abnormality is consistent with our finding of elevated levels of Flt3 ligand (FL) in 20 of 23 CLL sera tested. We propose that FL-dependent increased Flt3 signaling prevents the expression of PU.1, which down-regulates that of CD20, and accounts for resistance of leukemic B cells to rituximab-induced lysis.",

Our goal was to quantitate expansion of cells with a primitive CD34+ Thy-1+ phenotype, as well as cell cycling, division history, differentiation, and apoptosis of CD34+ cells enriched from normal donor mobilized peripheral blood (MPB) cells. The balance of these parameters determines the net number of transplantable HSC produced in ex vivo cultures. Comparing several different combinations of cytokines added to 90-hour cultures of MPB CD34 cells, thrombopoietin (TPO), flt3 ligand (FL), and c-kit ligand (KL) gave the best result, with the lowest percentage of apoptotic cells and a mean 1.2-fold increase in the number of CD34+ Thy-1+ cells. A combination of interleukin 3 (IL-3), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) gave the worst outcome, including a decrease of CD34+ Thy-1+ cell number to a mean of 30% of the starting cell number. Cell division history was tracked using the dye 5-(and 6-) carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE). Division of CD34+ Thy-1+ cells was faster and more synchronous in TPO, FL, and KL than in IL-3, IL-6, and LIF, which left a significant proportion of CD34+ cells undivided. Such detailed analyses of short-term, ex vivo cultures generated \"replication scores,\" which allowed prediction of a sixfold improvement of the efficiency of gene transduction of primitive hematopoietic progenitors from MPB, using TPO, FL, and KL to replace IL-3, IL-6, and LIF. Analysis of retroviral transduction efficiency confirmed the increase of transgene expression from MPB primitive hematopoietic progenitors assayed after stromal culture was fivefold, validating the usefulness of multiparameter analysis of short-term cultures for survival and replication of CD34+ Thy-1+ cells.",

Finally, we demonstrate that lymphoid progenitors, but not myeloid-erythroid progenitors, give rise to NH cells in vivo.

By contrast, livers from donors treated with Flt3 ligand, which dramatically increases hepatic interstitial dendritic cells, are rejected acutely (median survival time 5 days). This switch from tolerance to rejection is associated with a marked reduction in apoptotic activity of graft-infiltrating cells. We hypothesized that IL-12 production by enhanced numbers of donor APC might inhibit apoptosis, promote expansion of Th1 cells, and play a key role in liver rejection. Therefore, C3H (H2(k)) recipients of liver grafts from Flt3 ligand-treated B10 donors were given neutralizing anti-IL-12 mAb (200 or 500 microg) on days 0 and 2 after transplant. Graft survival was markedly prolonged at the higher mAb dose, with 50% of grafts surviving >100 days. This effect was associated with reductions in IFN-gamma gene transcripts within the graft-infiltrating cell population and with reductions in circulating IFN-gamma and IL-10 levels, donor-specific CTL and NK cell activities, and circulating alloantibody levels. At the same time, there were marked increases in apoptotic (TUNEL(+)) CD4(+) and especially CD8(+) cells, both within the grafts and in spleens of anti-IL-12 mAb-treated mice. In vitro, exogenous IL-12 inhibited apoptotic death induced in naive allogeneic T cells by liver nonparenchymal cells.

We recently used such an approach to stage progenitor cell hierarchy involved in myeloid development with the use of two markers, Slamf1 and Endoglin that have recently been shown to be associated with hematopoietic stem cells. Here, we provide additional characterization of these cellular subsets to further refine their developmental potential. Little or no alterations in lineage potential were observed in these subsets when evaluated in a BCL2 transgenic setting or in response to various growth factor combinations, although BCL2 significantly enhanced their in vitro readout. Gene expression patterns of functionally opposing transcription factors that are known to play key roles for the appropriate development into separate myeloid lineages were associated with the functional activity of prospectively isolated subsets. Multiple genes traditionally associated with early lymphopoiesis were observed in early candidate granulocyte/monocyte, but not early megakaryocytic and/or erythroid progenitor cells.

Here we show that Pbx3 and Meis1 need to dimerize to support Hox-induced leukemia and we analyze the molecular details of this cooperation. In the absence of Pbx3, Meis1 was highly unstable. As shown by a deletion analysis Meis1 degradation was contingent on a motif coinciding with the Pbx-binding domain. Either deletion of this sequence or binding to Pbx3 prolonged the half-life of Meis1 by preventing its ubiquitination. Meis1 break-down could also be blocked by inhibition of the ubiquitin proteasome system, indicating tight post-transcriptional control. In addition, Meis1 and Pbx3 cooperated genetically as overexpression of Pbx3 induced endogenous Meis1 transcription. These functional interactions translated into in vivo activity. Blocking Meis1/Pbx3 dimerization abrogated the ability to enhance proliferation and colony-forming cell numbers in primary cells transformed by Hoxa9. Furthermore, expression of Meis1 target genes Flt3 and Trib2 was dependent on Pbx3/Meis1 dimerization. This correlated with the requirement of Meis1 to bind Pbx3 in order to form high affinity DNA/Hoxa9/Meis1/Pbx3 complexes in vitro. Finally, kinetics and severity of disease in transplantation assays indicated that Pbx3/Meis1 dimers are rate-limiting factors for Hoxa9-induced leukemia. ",

The pDCs of both origins produced IFN-α when stimulated with CpG oligonucleotides. The pDCs of CLP origin showed evidence of past RAG1 expression and had D-J rearrangements in IgH genes. Most pDCs and all cDCs of CMP origin lacked these signs of a lymphoid past.

In mice, DC from these separate hemopoietic lineages differ by their surface expression of CD8 alpha. We undertook a comparative study of CD8 alpha+ (CD11blow; lymphoid-related) and CD8 alpha- (CD11bhigh; myeloid) DC isolated from mouse liver. CD8 alpha+ and CD8 alpha- DC each constituted </=1.0% of the freshly isolated, normal nonparenchymal cells (NPC). Both populations were enriched 10-15% by overnight culture and metrizamide density centrifugation. Flt3 ligand (Flt3L) potently induced equal expansion of both subsets in vivo. Tissue-resident CD8 alpha+ DC, freshly isolated from Flt3L-treated mice, existed primarily as immature cells (CD11c+, CD11blow, CD40-/low, CD80low, CD86low, MHC class IIlow), consistent with previous observations regarding bulk DC freshly isolated from nonlymphoid tissues. Following overnight culture in GM-CSF, CD8 alpha+ DC underwent phenotypic and functional maturation equivalent to that observed for CD8 alpha- DC. CD95 ligand (FasL) mRNA was detected in both immature and mature DC of each subset. In vitro analysis confirmed that flow-sorted, mature CD8 alpha+ and CD8 alpha- DC were strong and equally efficient stimulators of allogeneic T cell proliferation in primary MLR. Both immunohistochemical and genomic DNA analysis revealed that in vivo, sorted CD8 alpha+ DC trafficked from s.c. sites to T cell areas of allogeneic lymphoid tissue and were equally efficient at priming naive T cells compared with CD8 alpha- DC. This is the first comparative study of lymphoid-related DC isolated from nonlymphoid tissue.",

The major limitation is a total absence of human B cell development in the mice, which could be due to supraphysiological levels of HuIL-3 in the circulation. In an effort to obtain human B lymphoid, as well as T lymphoid and myeloid cell development in the mice, CD34+ cells were coinjected with human marrow stromal cells engineered to secrete human IL-2, IL-7, stem cell factor or FLT3 ligand, +/- IL-3. No single factor other than IL-3 supported sustained human hematopoiesis in the mice, although cytokines were expressed for four to six months post-transplantation. Production of both HuIL-3 and IL-7 in the mice supported extrathymic development of human T lymphocytes, but no B cells, myeloid cells, or clonogenic progenitors were detected. Human B cells were not produced from CD34+ cells in the bnx mice under any condition tested. Another limitation to the bnx/Hu system is a lack of maturation of human red blood cells, although BFU-E are maintained. Stromal cells secreting human erythropoietin and IL-3 were cotransplanted into mice with HuCD34+ cells and an increase in hematocrit from 40%-45% to 80%-85% resulted, with production of human and murine red blood cells.

The present study is the first demonstrating cytokines capable of inhibiting FL-stimulated hematopoietic cell growth. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta l) potently inhibited the clonal growth of murine Lin-Sca-l+ bone marrow progenitors stimulated by FL alone or in combination with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), stem cell factor (SCF), interleukin (IL)-3, IL-6, IL-11, or IL-12. TGF-beta 1 inhibited more than 96% of the myeloid colony formation in response to these cytokine combinations, whereas TNF-alpha reduced the number of colonies by 58% to 96% depending on the cytokine by which FL was combined. In addition, both TNF-alpha and TGF-beta 1 inhibited more than 90% of B220+ cell production from B220- bone marrow cells stimulated by FL + IL-7. The effects of TNF-alpha and TGF-beta 1 appeared to be due to a direct effect and on the early progenitors because the inhibition was observed at the single cell level, and because delayed addition of the two inhibitors for only 48 hours dramatically reduced their inhibitory effects. A neutralizing anti-TGF-beta antibody showed the presence of endogenous TGF-beta in the cultures and potently enhanced the ability of FL to stimulate progenitor cell growth in the absence of other cytokines. Agonistic antibodies specifically activating the p75 TNF receptors were more efficient than wild type murine TNF-alpha in signaling growth inhibition of Lin-Sca-l+ progenitor cells, whereas the p55 agonist had less effect than murine TNF-alpha. Finally, TGF-beta increased the number of FL + IL-11-stimulated Lin-Sca-1+ cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle with 76%, whereas TNF-alpha only had a marginal effect on cell cycle distribution. Thus, TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, and p75 TNF receptor agonists are potent direct inhibitors of FL-stimulated progenitor cell growth in vitro.",

Potentially tolerogenic immature donor dendritic cells (DC) may play a key role in this phenomenon, but recovery of purified DC from normal livers for functional analysis is inherently difficult. Administration of in vitro propagated immature donor DC to recipients of different types of allograft can prolong transplant survival. By contrast, marked increases in donor liver DC as the result of Flt3 ligand (FL) administration and the resulting augmentation of allostimulatory activity within host lymphoid tissue, is associated with acute graft rejection. Here, we compared the capacity of in vitro generated normal liver immature DC and FL-treated donor liver DC to induce alloimmune CD4+ T helper (Th) 1/Th2 and CD8+ T cytotoxic (Tc) 1/Tc2 responses, in vitro and in vivo.;B10 (H2b, IAb) immature liver DC were propagated from normal hepatic nonparenchymal cells in granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for 6-8 days. Freshly isolated DC from livers of FL-treated mice (FL-liver DC) were cultured overnight (o/n) in GM-CSF, and both myeloid (CD11c+ CD8alpha-) and lymphoid DC (CD11c+ CD8alpha+) flow-sorted for functional analysis. Proliferative activity and production of interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-4, and IL-10 by naive C3H (H2k, IEk) T cells in response to DC stimulation was assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation, and by multicolor flow cytometric analysis, respectively, after 3-day mixed leukocyte reactions. To investigate their in vivo trafficking, B10 DC were injected subcutaneously into normal C3H mice. Sections of lymphoid tissue were immunostained for donor MHC class II+ (IAb+) cells, and for IFN-gamma, IL-4, and IL-10 production. Donor cells and clusters of specific cytokine-secreting cells were enumerated.;Both in vitro propagated normal liver-derived DC, and freshly isolated bulk FL-liver DC showed an immature phenotype (MHC class II(lo), CD40-, CD80-, and CD86-) and were weak stimulators of naive allogeneic T cells. After o/n incubation in GM-CSF, both CD8alpha- and CD8alpha+ FL-liver DC exhibited marked up-regulation of surface MHC class II and costimulatory molecules, and acquired potent stimulatory activity for Th1 (mainly) and Th2 cells. Both in vitro propagated immature DC and o/n-cultured mature FL-liver DC homed in vivo to host lymphoid tissues, but with different kinetics. Whereas the mature allogeneic FL-liver DC induced IFN-gamma+ clusters in splenic T-cell areas within 2 days, the IFN-gamma response to immature DC was much slower and weaker.;FL-treated donor livers that are rejected acutely contain markedly enhanced numbers of myeloid (CD8alpha-) and lymphoid (CD8alpha+) DC, many of which are capable of maturing rapidly into strong inducers of Th1 and Tcl responses. Substantial differences in quantity, and both the phenotypic and functional characteristics of the DC constituency of donor livers, may contribute significantly toward the distinct outcomes of liver transplant tolerance and rejection.",

A major complication associated with CLL is severe recurrent infections, which are often fatal. Vulnerability to infection is due to a wide variety of immunological defects, yet the initiating events of immunodeficiency in CLL are unclear. Using CLL patient samples and a mouse model of CLL, we have discovered that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which underpin the activity of effector immune cells critical for anti-viral immunity and anti-tumor responses, are reduced in number and functionally impaired in progressive CLL. As a result, the levels of interferon alpha (IFNα) production, a cytokine critical for immunity, are markedly reduced. Lower pDC numbers with impaired IFNα production was due to the decreased expression of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 receptor (Flt3) and Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), respectively. Reduced Flt3 expression was reversed using inhibitors of TGF-β and TNF, an effect correlating with a reduction in tumor load. Defects in pDC numbers and function offer new insight into mechanisms underpinning the profound immunodeficiency affecting CLL patients and provide a potentially novel avenue for restoring immunocompetency in CLL.

As a consequence of inhibiting its downstream messengers, mTOR inhibitors prevent cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activation, inhibit retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation, and accelerate the turnover of cyclin D1, leading to a deficiency of active CDK4/cyclin D1 complexes, all of which may help cause GI phase arrest. Constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt kinases occur in human leukemias. FLT3, VEGF, and BCR-ABL mediate their activities via mTOR.

To investigate the basis for the capacity of FLT3L to augment the de novo generation of myeloid progenitors from CD34+CD38- cells, single bone marrow CD34+CD38- cells were sorted into Terasaki wells containing serum-free medium supplemented with interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-6, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), SCF (4 HGF) +/- FLT3L. Under these conditions, FLT3L recruited approximately twofold more CD34+CD38- cells into division than 4 HGF alone. The enhanced proliferative response to FLT3L was evident by day 3 and was maintained at all subsequent time points examined. In accord with these findings, we also show that transduction of CD34+CD38- cells with the LAPSN retrovirus is enhanced by FLT3L.

Because PIM-1 is a STAT5 target gene, we analyzed the role of the family of PIM serine/threonine kinases (PIM-1 to PIM-3) in PTK-mediated transformation of hematopoietic cells. Ba/F3 cells transformed to growth factor independence by various oncogenic PTKs (TEL/JAK2, TEL/TRKC, TEL/ABL, BCR/ABL, FLT3-ITD, and H4/PDGFbetaR) show abundant expression of PIM-1 and PIM-2. Suppression of PIM-1 activity had a negligible effect on transformation. In contrast, expression of kinase-dead PIM-2 mutant (PIM-2KD) led to a rapid decline of survival in Ba/F3 cells transformed by FLT3-ITD but not by other oncogenic PTKs tested. Coexpression of PIM-1KD and PIM-2KD abrogated growth factor-independent growth of Ba/F3 transformed by several PTKs, including BCR/ABL. Targeted down-regulation of PIM-2 by RNA interference (RNAi) selectively abrogated survival of Ba/F3 cells transformed by various Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-activating mutants [internal tandem duplication (ITD) and kinase domain] and attenuated growth of human cell lines containing FLT3 mutations. Interestingly, cells transformed by FLT3 and BCR/ABL mutations that confer resistance to small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors were still sensitive to knockdown of PIM-2, or PIM-1 and PIM-2 by RNAi. Our observations indicate that combined inactivation of PIM-1 and PIM-2 interferes with oncogenic PTKs and suggest that PIMs are alternative therapeutic targets in PTK-mediated leukemia. Targeting the PIM kinase family could provide a new avenue to overcome resistance against small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors.",

Their subclasses were the mouse IgG2a with kappa light chains. The three monoclonal antibodies recognized the FL molecule on U937 and HL-60 cells that also coexpressed Flt3 molecule. When U937 and HL-60 cells were cultured in presence of 3C2, 3C6 and 8D10, their proliferation was reduced as compared to that in control in MTT assay(P < 0.05). The analysis of annexin-V/PI binding to U937 and HL-60 cells by FCM showed the mAbs had the apoptotogenic activity of the monoclonal antibodies against human FL molecule.;3C2, 3C6 and 8D10 are three funtional monoclonal antibodies against human FL molecule. They may be of some value in the study of the roles of FL/Flt3 interaction in leukemia pathogenesis.",

        "Doc_abstract":"B-cell commitment and early development from multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells has until recently been considered to be dependent on direct interaction with stromal cells. We recently showed that the flt3 ligand (FL) has a unique ability to interact with interleukin-7 (IL-7) to directly and selectively promote B-cell development from murine bone marrow progenitor cells with a combined myeloid and lymphoid potential. Here we report that whereas IL-10 alone has no ability to stimulate growth of primitive (Lin-Sca-1(+)c-kit+) bone marrow progenitor cells, it potently enhances FL + IL-7-induced proliferation (sevenfold). This enhanced proliferation results from recruitment of progenitors unresponsive to FL + IL-7 alone, as well as from increased growth of individual clones, resulting in a 7,000-fold cellular expansion over 12 days. Single cell cultures and delayed addition studies suggested that the stimulatory effect of IL-10 was directly mediated on the progenitor cells. The cells generated in response to FL + IL-7 + IL-10 appeared to be almost exclusively proB cells, as shown by their expression of B220, CD24, CD43, and lack of expression of c mu, myeloid, erythroid, and T-cell surface antigens. Although IL-10 also enhanced kit ligand (KL) + IL-7-induced proliferation of Lin-Sca-1(+)c-kit+ progenitor cells, the resulting cells were predominantly myeloid progeny. Accordingly, FL + IL-7 + IL-10 was 100-fold more efficient in stimulating production of proB cells than KL + IL-7 + IL-10. In contrast to its ability to stimulate the earliest phase of proB cell formation and proliferation, IL-10 inhibited growth of proB cells generated in response to FL + IL-7. Analysis of CD19 expression on cells generated in FL + IL-7 + IL-10 showed that almost all cells generated under these conditions lacked expression of CD19, in contrast to cells generated in the absence of IL-10, which were predominantly CD19(+). Replating of sorted CD19(+) and CD19(-) proB cells in FL + IL-7 or FL + IL-7 + IL-10 showed that IL-10 efficiently blocked growth of CD19(+), but not CD19(-) cells. Both CD19(-) and CD19(+) cells expressed lambda5 and VpreB , shown to be specific for B-cell progenitors. In addition, sorted CD19(-) cells generated CD19(+) cells in response to FL + IL-7. Thus, IL-10 has a dual regulatory effect on early B-cell development from primitive murine bone marrow progenitor cells in that it enhances FL + IL-7-induced proB-cell formation and growth before acquisition of CD19 expression, whereas growth of CD19(+) proB cells is inhibited.",

Recently, it has been found as a frequent target of aberrancies in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; 30% of B cell ALL cases), showing monoallelic loss, point mutations, or chromosomal translocations. The role of these aberrancies is still poorly understood. We previously cloned the PAX5/TEL fusion gene in a patient affected by B-cell precursor ALL with a t(9;12) translocation. This is the first report investigating the molecular and functional roles of PAX5/TEL protein in vitro from murine wild-type pre-BI cells. We showed that PAX5/TEL protein acts as an aberrant transcription factor with repressor function, recruiting mSin3A, down-regulating B220, CD19, BLNK, MB-1, FLT3, and mu heavy chain expression, thus suggesting a block on B-cell differentiation. In a PAX5-deficient context, the presence of PAX5/TEL did not replace PAX5 functions. PAX5/TEL protein enhances cell migration towards CXCL12, with the overexpression of CXCR4. Moreover, the presence of the fusion gene overcomes interleukin-7 withdrawal and interferes with transforming growth factor-beta1 pathway, inducing resistance and conferring cells an advantage in proliferation and survival. Thus, in vitro, the PAX5/TEL protein has a dominant effect on wild-type PAX5, interferes with the process of B-cell differentiation and migration, and induces resistance to apoptosis. Taken together, these phenomena likely represent key events in the process of B-cell transformation.",

Despite being required for fetal lymphopoiesis, PU.1 is dispensable for the differentiation of committed B cells. There is, however, an emerging and still uncharacterized function of PU.1 as a repressor for late B-cell differentiation. In contrast, PU.1 is required at every point for the differentiation of all dendritic cells, in part, although its regulation of the crucial receptor Flt3. Within the T-cell lineage, PU.1 is required for the earliest thymic development, although the mechanism remains unknown, while recent studies have shown a previously unknown function of PU.1 in peripheral T-cell differentiation.

Common adverse events were gastrointestinal in nature, while hematologic toxicity was limited. However, it was announced that all ongoing clinical trials on pacritinib have been placed on hold by the US Food and Drug Administration in February 2016, due to concerns for increased intracranial hemorrhage and cardiac events.

As ligand-activated transcription factors that modulate chromatin structure, ER regulate transcriptional programs that direct the development or functional responses of immune cells. ER-regulated immune responses likely contribute to significant sex biases in infection, autoimmunity and other inflammatory diseases, and changes in immune function during the female hormonal cycle and pregnancy. Here we summarize our own and others' studies showing that ERα signaling regulates the development of dendritic cells (DCs), antigen-presenting cells crucial for initiation of innate and adaptive immunity. During inflammation, elevated GM-CSF directs the development of new DCs from monocytes or other precursors that infiltrate tissues and lymphoid organs, and these de novo populations of inflammatory DCs have critical roles in programming T cell-mediated responses during infection and autoimmunity. Estradiol acting via ERα, but not ERβ, promotes the GM-CSF-mediated inflammatory pathway of DC differentiation, leading to the development of DCs with increased functional capacity. Estradiol/ERα signaling acts directly in GM-CSF-stimulated myeloid progenitors to induce elevated levels of IRF4, a transcription factor that directs a developmental program underlying CD11b⁺ DC differentiation. In contrast, during homeostatic Flt3 Ligand-driven DC development, ERα signaling decreases numbers of myeloid progenitors and differentiated DCs, yet promotes more functionally competent DCs. Thus ERα signaling regulates the response of DC progenitors to the external cytokine environment, thereby altering the strength or integrity of DC developmental pathways. The development of increased numbers of DCs during inflammation will likely increase the magnitude of DC-mediated functional responses including cytokine production, processing and MHC-mediated presentation of antigens, and activation and polarization of T and B lymphocytes; these functions also may be regulated directly by ERα signaling. In sum, via profound effects on DC development and ensuing functional responses, ERα signaling can regulate the quality of the adaptive immune responses and influence the resolution of infection or chronic inflammatory diseases.",

Unfortunately, oncogenic tyrosine kinases seem to have little problem to develop resistance to these inhibitors, and there is good evidence that this is not limited to imatinib, but also occurs with other inhibitors, such as FLT3 and EGFR inhibitors. Based on studies with imatinib, mutation and amplification of the target kinase seem to be the most important mechanisms for the development of resistance, but these mechanisms alone cannot explain all cases of resistance. A better understanding of the resistance mechanisms will be required to design improved treatment strategies in the future.

Emerging data demonstrate that selected hematologic malignancies exhibit abundant CN-LOH, often in the setting of a normal metaphase karyotype and no previously identified clonal marker. In this review, we explore emerging biologic and clinical features of CN-LOH relevant to hematologic malignancies. In myeloid malignancies, CN-LOH has been associated with the duplication of oncogenic mutations with concomitant loss of the normal allele. Examples include JAK2, MPL, c-KIT, and FLT3. More recent investigations have focused on evaluation of candidate genes contained in common CN-LOH and deletion regions and have led to the discovery of tumor suppressor genes, including c-CBL and family members, as well as TET2. Investigations into the underlying mechanisms generating CN-LOH have great promise for elucidating general cancer mechanisms.

Molecular copy number counting further delineated the breakpoints and facilitated cloning with long-distance inverse PCR. This approach identified 5 fusion gene partners with PAX5: LOC392027 (7p12.1), SLCO1B3 (12p12), ASXL1 (20q11.1), KIF3B (20q11.21), and C20orf112 (20q11.1). In each predicted fusion protein, the DNA-binding paired domain of PAX5 was present. Using quantitative PCR, we demonstrated that both the deletion and gene fusion events resulted in the same underexpression of PAX5, which extended to the differential expression of the PAX5 target genes, EBF1, ALDH1A1, ATP9A, and FLT3. Further molecular analysis showed deletion and mutation of the homologous PAX5 allele, providing further support for the key role of PAX5. Here, we show that specific gene loci may be the target of heterogeneous translocation breakpoints in human cancer, acting through a variety of mechanisms. This approach indicates an application for the identification of cancer genes in solid tumours, where unbalanced chromosomal rearrangements are particularly prevalent and few genes have been identified. It can be extrapolated that this strategy will reveal that the same mechanisms operate in cancer pathogenesis in general.",

Although hESC-derived hematopoietic progenitors have been previously identified by functional assays, their phenotype has not been defined. Here, using hESC differentiation in coculture with OP9 stromal cells, we demonstrate that early progenitors committed to hematopoietic development could be identified by surface expression of leukosialin (CD43). CD43 was detected on all types of emerging clonogenic progenitors before expression of CD45, persisted on differentiating hematopoietic cells, and reliably separated the hematopoietic CD34(+) population from CD34(+)CD43(-)CD31(+)KDR(+) endothelial and CD34(+)CD43(-)CD31(-)KDR(-) mesenchymal cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the first-appearing CD34(+)CD43(+)CD235a(+)CD41a(+/-)CD45(-) cells represent precommitted erythro-megakaryocytic progenitors. Multipotent lymphohematopoietic progenitors were generated later as CD34(+)CD43(+)CD41a(-)CD235a(-)CD45(-) cells. These cells were negative for lineage-specific markers (Lin(-)), expressed KDR, VE-cadherin, and CD105 endothelial proteins, and expressed GATA-2, GATA-3, RUNX1, C-MYB transcription factors that typify initial stages of definitive hematopoiesis originating from endothelial-like precursors. Acquisition of CD45 expression by CD34(+)CD43(+)CD45(-)Lin(-) cells was associated with progressive myeloid commitment and a decrease of B-lymphoid potential. CD34(+)CD43(+)CD45(+)Lin(-) cells were largely devoid of VE-cadherin and KDR expression and had a distinct FLT3(high)GATA3(low)RUNX1(low)PU1(high)MPO(high)IL7RA(high) gene expression profile.",

To expand on the functional properties of Flt3 ligand (FL) in vivo we treated nonhuman primates with FL and tested its ability to mobilize stem/progenitor cells when given alone or in combination with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment. FL alone (200 microg/kg/day) mobilizes progenitors with slow kinetics and with a peak effect at the end of 2 weeks of treatment. The spectrum of mobilized progenitors includes myeloid, lymphoid, megakaryocytic, and osteoclastogenic but a low proportion of burst-forming unit (BFU)e. Bone marrow (BM) studies before and during the treatment suggested that proliferative effects in BM may have preceded effects on peripheral blood mobilization. To assess the synergy of FL with G-CSF in mobilization of progenitors we used two schemes: one in which G-CSF was used for the last 5 days of a 12-day treatment with FL; the other in which both cytokines were given concurrently for 5 days only (FL, 200 microg/kg; G-CSF, 100 microg/kg). Both schemes yielded much higher progenitor mobilization levels (peak levels of colony-forming cells [CFSs] 41,000 to 95,000/mL blood) than observed with either FL (CFC 4,600 to 7,300/mL) or G-CSF (8,405 +/- 3,024/ mL) used alone at the same doses. Furthermore, there was a progressive and significant expansion of progenitors in vitro during 2 weeks in suspension cultures of mononuclear cells or of CD34+ cells only in the animal with the combined treatment. Likewise, substantial mobilization of osteoclastogenic progenitors was documented only with the combined treatment. Given the functional properties of FL, its synergistic mobilization with G-CSF, and its anticipated good tolerance (because of the absence of an effect on mast cell activation), a clinical use is projected for this cytokine in peripheral blood transplantation settings, as well as in experiments with ex vivo gene transfer.",

Whereas such primitive progenitor cells require combined stimulation by multiple cytokines for growth, some cytokines selectively promote viability rather than growth when acting individually. We investigated here for the first time the direct effects of cytokines on survival of primitive CD34+CD38- human bone marrow progenitor cells at the single-cell level. Interleukin-3 (IL-3) and the ligands for c-kit (KL) and flt3 (FL) had direct and selective viability-promoting effects on a small fraction of CD34+CD38- but not CD34+CD38+ progenitor cells. Interestingly, the recently cloned thrombopoietin (Tpo), although stimulating little growth, kept most CD34+CD38- progenitors viable after prolonged culture, maintaining twofold and fourfold more progenitors viable than KL and IL-3, respectively. A high fraction of these progenitors had a combined myeloid and erythroid differentiation potential, as well as capacity for prolonged production of progenitor cells under stroma-independent conditions. In addition, Tpo promoted viability of CD34+CD38- long-term culture-initiating cells, further supporting the idea that Tpo promotes viability of primitive human progenitor cells. Finally, Tpo suppressed apoptosis of CD34+CD38- cells in culture. Thus, the present studies show a novel effect of Tpo, implicating a potential role of this cytokine in maintaining quiescent primitive human progenitor cells viable.",

The function of NOD FCs was evaluated by colony-forming cell (CFC) assay in vitro and syngeneic or allogeneic HSC transplantation in vivo.;We report for the first time that NOD FCs are functionally impaired. They fail to facilitate engraftment of syngeneic and allogeneic HSCs in vivo and do not enhance HSC clonogenicity in vitro. NOD FCs contain subpopulations similar to those previously described in B6 FCs, including p-preDC, CD19(+), NK1.1(+)DX5(+), and myeloid cells. However, the CD19(+) and NK1.1(+)DX5(+) subpopulations are significantly decreased in number in NOD FCs compared with disease-resistant controls. Removal of the CD19(+) or NK1.1(+)DX5(+) subpopulations from FCs did not significantly affect facilitation. Notably, Flt3 ligand (FL) treatment of NOD donors expanded FC total in peripheral blood and restored facilitating function in vivo.;These data demonstrate that NOD FCs exhibit significantly impaired function that is reversible, since FL restored production of functional FCs in NOD mice and suggest that FL plays an important role in the regulation and development of FC function.

Thus, we have used an efficient and clinically applicable protocol for the retroviral transduction of cord blood (CB) or mobilized peripheral blood (MPB) CD34+ cells based on infection with gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV)-pseudotyped retroviral vectors carrying the nls-LacZ reporter gene. Infected cells have been subsequently cultured under conditions allowing their dendritic differentiation. The results show that using a growth factor combination including granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor plus tumor necrosis factor alpha plus interleukin 4 plus stem cell factor plus Flt3 ligand, more than 70% of DCs derived from CB or MPB CD34+ cells can be transduced. Semiquantitative PCR indicates that at least two proviral copies per cell were detected. Transduced DCs retain normal immunophenotype and potent T cell stimulatory capacity. Finally, by using a semisolid methylcellulose assay for dendritic progenitors (CFU-DCs), we show that more than 90% of CFU-DCs can be transduced.

Multiplex ELISA array and cDNA microarray analyses revealed that the DCPs shared some features of IL-4 and IL-15 DCs but displayed a pronounced proinflammatory phenotype. DCP-derived DCs showed antigen-uptake and immune activation functions analogous to that of the peripheral blood-derived DCs. Furthermore, bone marrow HPC-derived DCP vaccines of tumor-bearing mice suppressed tumor growth in vivo.This novel approach of generating DCP-DCs, which are different from known IL-4 and IL-15 DCs, overcomes both quantitative and qualitative limitations in obtaining functional autologous DCs from a small number of HPCs with great translational potential.",

Interferon consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP; also called interferon regulatory factor 8 [IRF-8]) is a hematopoietic cell-specific transcription factor expressed in BM progenitor cells that contributes to myeloid cell development. In light of our earlier observation that ICSBP(-/-) mice lack CD8alpha(+) DCs, we investigated the role of ICSBP in DC development in vitro in the presence of Flt3 ligand. Immature ICSBP(-/-) DCs developed from BM progenitor cells showed assorted defects, did not mature in response to activation signals, and failed to express CD8alpha and interleukin 12 (IL-12) p40, a feature consistent with ICSBP(-/-) DCs in vivo. We show that retroviral introduction of ICSBP restores the development of immature DCs that can fully mature on activation signals. All the defects seen with ICSBP(-/-) DCs were corrected after ICSBP transduction, including the expression of CD8alpha and IL-12 p40 as well as major histocompatability complex class II and other costimulatory molecules. ICSBP is known to regulate gene expression by interacting with partner proteins PU.1 and IRFs, thereby binding to target elements ISRE and EICE. Analysis of a series of ICSBP mutants showed that the intact DNA-binding activity as well as the ability to interact with partner proteins are required for the restoration of DC development/maturation, pointing to the transcriptional function of ICSBP as a basis of restoration. Taken together, this study identifies ICSBP as a factor critical for both early differentiation and final maturation of DCs.",

Here, we show a unipotent megakaryopoietic pathway bypassing the bipotent megakaryocyte/erythroid progenitors (biEMPs). Cells purified from mouse bone marrow by CD42b (GPIbα) marking were demonstrated to be unipotent megakaryocytic progenitors (MKPs) by culture and transplantation. A subpopulation of freshly isolated CD41(+) cells in the lineage Sca1(+) cKit(+) (LSK) fraction (subCD41(+) LSK) differentiated only into MKP and mature megakaryocytes in culture. Although CD41(+) LSK cells as a whole were capable of differentiating into all myeloid and lymphoid cells in vivo, they produced unipotent MKP, mature megakaryocytes, and platelets in vitro and in vivo much more efficiently than Flt3(+) CD41(-) LSK cells, especially at the early phase after transplantation. In single cell polymerase chain reaction and thrombopoietin (TPO) signaling analyses, the MKP and a fraction of CD41(+) LSK, but not the biEMP, showed the similarities in mRNA expression profile and visible TPO-mediated phosphorylation. On increased demand of platelet production after 5-FU treatment, a part of CD41(+) LSK population expressed CD42b on the surface, and 90% of them showed unipotent megakaryopoietic capacity in single cell culture and predominantly produced platelets in vivo at the early phase after transplantation. These results suggest that the CD41(+) CD42b(+) LSK are straightforward progenies of megakaryocytes/platelet-biased stem/repopulating cells, but not progenies of biEMP. Consequently, we show a unipotent/highly biased megakaryopoietic pathway interconnecting stem/repopulating cells and mature megakaryocytes, the one that may play physiologic roles especially in emergency megakaryopoiesis.",

We now report that IL-7 increases the number of mature myeloid and monocytic cells in spleen and peripheral blood. This effect required T cells, and we show that IL-7 treatment in vivo induced GM-CSF and IL-3 production by T cells with memory phenotype. However, additional myelopoietic cytokines were shown to be involved because mice deficient in both GM-CSF and IL-3 also responded to IL-7 with increased myelopoiesis. Candidate cytokines included IFN-gamma and Flt3 ligand, which were also produced in response to IL-7. Because IFN-gamma-deficient mice also increased myelopoiesis, it was suggested that IL-7 induced production of redundant myelopoietic cytokines. In support of this hypothesis, we found that the supernatant from IL-7-treated, purified T cells contained myelopoietic activity that required a combination of Abs against GM-CSF, IL-3, and anti-Flt3 ligand to achieve maximum neutralization. IL-7 administration increased the number of splenic erythroid cells in either normal, Rag1 or GM-CSF-IL-3-deficient mice, suggesting that IL-7 might directly act on erythroid progenitors. In support of this theory, we detected a percentage of TER-119(+) erythroid cells that expressed the IL-7Ralpha-chain and common gamma-chain. Bone marrow cells expressing IL-7R and B220 generated erythroid colonies in vitro in response to IL-7, erythropoietin, and stem cell factor. This study demonstrates that IL-7 can promote nonlymphoid hemopoiesis and production of cytokines active in the host defense system in vivo, supporting its possible clinical utility.",

ENMD-2076 has selective activity against the mitotic kinase Aurora A, as well as kinases involved in angiogenesis (VEGFRs, FGFRs). ENMD-2076 inhibited the growth in vitro of a wide range of human solid tumor and hematopoietic cancer cell lines with IC(50) values ranging from 0.025 to 0.7 μmol/L. ENMD-2076 was also shown to induce regression or complete inhibition of tumor growth in vivo at well-tolerated doses in tumor xenograft models derived from breast, colon, melanoma, leukemia, and multiple myeloma cell lines. Pharmacodynamic experiments in vivo showed that in addition to inhibiting Aurora A, single doses of ENMD-2076 had sustained inhibitory effects on the activation of Flt3 as well as the angiogenic tyrosine kinases, VEGFR2/KDR and FGFR1 and 2. ENMD-2076 was shown to prevent the formation of new blood vessels and regress formed vessels in vivo at doses equivalent to those that gave substantial activity in tumor xenograft models. These results indicate that ENMD-2076 is a well-tolerated, orally active multitarget kinase inhibitor with a unique antiangiogenic/antiproliferative profile and provides strong preclinical support for use as a therapeutic for human cancers. Several phase 1 studies involving ENMD-2076 have been recently completed, and the compound is currently being evaluated in a phase 2 clinical trial in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.",

Mouse bone marrow cells were transfected with GFP-expressed retroviral vectors encoding various leukemia/lymphoma-associated fusion proteins (TEL-PDGFR, Rabaptin5-PDGFR, p210BCR-ABL, AML1-ETO, NPM-ALK). After transfection, the cells were cultured in IMDM containing 10% FCS without growth factors, or with one of the following growth factor combinations: (1) murine c-kit ligand (KL) plus human flt3 ligand (FL); (2) IL-3, thrombopoietin, G-CSF, and hyper-IL-6 (3/T/G/H6); (3) KL/FL plus 3/T/G/H6. The flow cytometry was used to detect the ability of combinations of growth factors to complement the oncogene fusion protein to support self-renewal of the transfected cells. The results showed that the transfected cells could be amplified sustainably in the logarithmic growth way. The indicated combination of c-Kit ligand (KL) with flt-3 ligand (FL) supported the self-renewal of the marrow cells transfected with vectors encoding TEL-PDGFR, Rabaptin5-PDGFR, AML1-ETO and NPM-ALK, in addition to KL/FL, the self-renewal of p210 BCR-ABL transfected-marrow cells also required IL-3. The morphology of cells emerged from culture can be the predictor of the corresponding oncogene-associated malignancy.

Because the origin of tumor cells was not clear and they exhibited a nonlineage-specific phenotype, we hypothesized that such tumors likely originated from hematologic-myeloid precursor cells and were tentatively assigned the designation \"agranular CD4+ CD56+ hematodermic neoplasms.\" In the present study we report 14 cases (seven already reported and seven additional cases) of these tumors, and simultaneously we present now a rare population of cells that we have identified in the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers treated with Flt3 ligand. These cells express all the characteristic markers of CD4+ CD56+ hematodermic neoplasms. This population appears to be related to plasmacytoid monocytes because they also expressed CD68 and bright levels of CD123. To confirm the relationship between these normal cells and CD4+ CD56+ hematodermic neoplasms, we conducted an extensive comparative phenotypic study. Results show that these two cell types are indeed related because they share many phenotypic features, including the presence of CD4, CD56, CD43, CD68, and HLA-DR and the absence of other T, B, NK, or myelomonocytic markers. More importantly, we found that the bright expression of CD123 by immunohistochemistry is a distinctive characteristic of CD4+ CD56+ hematodermic neoplasms because all (n = 14) cases expressed this marker, whereas only two specimens in a control panel comprising 30 samples of related tumors expressed comparable levels of CD123. We therefore propose that oncogenic transformation of NCAM-expressing plasmacytoid monocyte-like cells may lead to \"agranular CD4+ CD56+ hematodermic neoplasm.\"",

The area under the curve (AUC) obtained by plotting the logarithm of the total number of viable cells, CD34(+) cells, and CFC per well, toward the week of culture was used as an index of cell expansion. With CB, a significant difference was obtained between the two combinations of cytokines with regard to the total number of viable cells, GM-CFC, and CD34(+) cells. The difference between the two combinations of cytokines obtained with BM was significant with respect to the total number of viable cells and CD34(+) cells but not for the erythroid and myeloid progenitors. When CD34(+) cells from peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) were cultured in presence of the two combinations of cytokines, the difference in terms of AUC was not statistically significant.

By reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, the expression by MMHs of cytokines involved in the survival and self-renewal of early progenitor cells (stem cell factor and FLT3 ligand) as well as those acting at different stages of progenitor differentiation (interleukin [IL] 1beta, IL-3, leukemia inhibitory factor, IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and thrombopoietin) was shown. A ribonuclease protection assay further substantiated the presence of at least six cytokine transcripts in MMH lines. Cocultures between MMH layers and progenitor-enriched fetal liver hematopoietic cells resulted in a 40-fold to 80-fold expansion of total hematopoietic cells and in a 2.5-fold expansion of clonogenic progenitors after 1 to 2 weeks. Hematopoiesis was maintained for up to 6 weeks with formation of typical cobblestone cell areas and continuous differentiation of precursor into cells at various degrees of maturation. At 5 weeks of coculture, clonogenic progenitors were maintained at 20% of the input level in coculture with embryonic-derived hepatocytes, showing the ability of hepatocyte feeder layer to support survival and possibly self-renewal of clonogenic progenitors.

Survivin expression was analyzed in umbilical cord blood (UCB) and adult bone marrow CD34(+) cells and in the factor-dependent MO7e cell line; also investigated was whether survivin expression was regulated by hematopoietic growth factors. Survivin messsenger RNA (mRNA) and protein were expressed in fresh UCB and marrow CD34(+) cells. The combination of thrombopoietin, Flt3 ligand, and stem cell factor upregulated survivin expression in CD34(+) cells within 24 hours; survivin expression was cell-cycle related and highest during G2/M, whereas growth-factor withdrawal resulted in decreased survivin expression. Cell-cycle fractionation of UCB CD34(+) with Hoechst-33342/pyronin-Y demonstrated that survivin message was undetectable in freshly isolated G0 cells, but present in G1 cells. After cytokine stimulation, survivin mRNA and protein expression were observed in both G0 and G1 CD34(+) cells as well as in cells that had progressed to S and G2/M phase, indicating that survivin expression is regulated in all phases of the cell cycle. This contrasts with the expression of survivin predominantly during G2/M in cancer cells. In CD34(+) cells and MO7e cells, growth factor-mediated upregulation of survivin was associated with inhibition of apoptosis, and downregulation of survivin was coincident with increased apoptosis. Furthermore, an inverse correlation between survivin and active caspase-3 was observed in CD34(+) cells.

However, in the majority of patients given all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)/anthracycline-based induction therapy, PML-RARα transcript remains even when haematologic complete remission is achieved. To facilitate maximal therapeutic efficacy for patients with APL, this study tested whether the addition of arsenic trioxide (ATO) would increase the rate of molecular complete remission after ATRA/anthracycline-based induction therapy.;Seventy-three patients with APL were induced with a regimen (designated 'AAA') consisting of ATO in combination with ATRA and daunorubicin. After this, a consolidation phase of daunorubicin-based chemotherapy and maintenance therapy with ATRA, ATO and methotrexate was administered. The noted outcomes were rates of complete remission, overall survival and disease-free survival. In addition, PML-RARα transcripts were monitored in 48 patients via RT-PCR.;Rates of complete remission, overall survival and 5-yr disease-free survival were 95.89%, 94.52% and 96.28%, respectively. At the preconsolidation checkpoint, 68.75% (33/48) of patients had a negative reading for the PML-RARα fusion transcript. These outcomes were not influenced by mutations in FLT3 (fms-related tyrosine kinase 3) or other prognostic factors.;The addition of ATO in the induction regimen was associated with an improved overall outcome for patients with de novo APL, with rather low relapse rate and better long-term survival.",

While most patients achieve remission, approximately half of patients recur with a short latency to relapse. This suggests that chemotherapy-resistant leukaemia stem cells (LSCs) survive and can recapitulate the leukaemia. We hypothesized that interactions between LSCs and the bone marrow microenvironment mediate survival and chemotherapy resistance in MLL-R ALL. Using primary samples of infant MLL-R ALL, we studied the influence of bone marrow stroma on apoptosis, proliferation, and cytotoxicity induced by the FLT3 inhibitor lestaurtinib. MLL-R ALL were differentially protected by stroma from spontaneous apoptosis compared to non-MLL-R ALL. Co-culture of bulk MLL-R ALL in direct contact with stroma or with stroma-produced soluble factors promoted proliferation and cell cycle entry. Stroma also protected bulk MLL-R ALL cells and MLL-R ALL LSCs from lestaurtinib-mediated cytotoxicity. Previous studies have demonstrated that CXCR4 mediates bone marrow microenvironment signalling. Using a xenograft model of MLL-R ALL, we demonstrated that CXCR4 inhibition with AMD3100 (plerixafor) led to markedly enhanced efficacy of lestaurtinib. Therefore, the bone marrow microenvironment is a mediator of chemotherapy resistance in MLL-R ALL and targeting leukaemia-stroma interactions with CXCR4 inhibitors may prove useful in this high-risk subtype of paediatric ALL.",

Establishment of such culture systems will have significant impact on ex vivo manipulation and expansion of transplantable stem cells in clinical applications such as gene therapy, tumor cell purging, and stem cell transplantation. We have recently developed a stromal-based culture system that facilitates ex vivo expansion of transplantable human HSCs. In this stromal-based culture system, 2 major contributors to the ex vivo stem cell expansion are the addition of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and the AC6.21 stromal cells. Because the action of LIF is indirect and mediated by stromal cells, we hypothesized that LIF binds to the LIF receptor on AC6.21 stromal cells, leading to up-regulated production of stem cell expansion promoting factor (SCEPF) and/or down-regulated production of stem cell expansion inhibitory factor (SCEIF). Here we demonstrate a secreted SCEPF activity in the conditioned media of LIF-treated AC6.21 stromal cell cultures (SCM-LIF). The magnitude of ex vivo stem cell expansion depends on the concentration of the secreted SCEPF activity in the SCM-LIF. Furthermore, we have ruled out the contribution of 6 known early-acting cytokines, including interleukin-3, interleukin-6, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, stem cell factor, flt3 ligand, and thrombopoietin, to this SCEPF activity. Although further studies are required to characterize this secreted SCEPF activity and to determine whether this secreted SCEPF activity is mediated by a single factor or by multiple growth factors, our results demonstrate that stromal cells are not required for this secreted SCEPF activity to facilitate ex vivo stem cell expansion.

The inhibition profile of ABT-869 is evident in cellular assays of RTK phosphorylation (IC50 = 2, 4, and 7 nmol/L for PDGFR-beta, KDR, and CSF-1R, respectively) and VEGF-stimulated proliferation (IC50 = 0.2 nmol/L for human endothelial cells). ABT-869 is not a general antiproliferative agent because, in most cancer cells, >1,000-fold higher concentrations of ABT-869 are required for inhibition of proliferation. However, ABT-869 exhibits potent antiproliferative and apoptotic effects on cancer cells whose proliferation is dependent on mutant kinases, such as FLT3. In vivo ABT-869 is effective orally in the mechanism-based murine models of VEGF-induced uterine edema (ED50 = 0.5 mg/kg) and corneal angiogenesis (>50% inhibition, 15 mg/kg). In tumor growth studies, ABT-869 exhibits efficacy in human fibrosarcoma and breast, colon, and small cell lung carcinoma xenograft models (ED50 = 1.5-5 mg/kg, twice daily) and is also effective (>50% inhibition) in orthotopic breast and glioma models. Reduction in tumor size and tumor regression was observed in epidermoid carcinoma and leukemia xenograft models, respectively. In combination, ABT-869 produced at least additive effects when given with cytotoxic therapies. Based on pharmacokinetic analysis from tumor growth studies, efficacy correlated more strongly with time over a threshold value (cellular KDR IC50 corrected for plasma protein binding = 0.08 microg/mL, >or=7 hours) than with plasma area under the curve or Cmax.

Although dendritic cells and macrophages both supported productive polyomavirus infection, dendritic cells were markedly more efficient at presenting the immunodominant viral epitope to CD8(+) T cells. Additionally, infected dendritic cells, but not infected macrophages, primed anti-polyomavirus CD8(+) T cells in vivo. Treatment with Flt3 ligand, a hematopoietic growth factor that dramatically expands the number of dendritic cells, markedly enhanced the magnitude of virus-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses during acute infection and the pool of memory anti-polyomavirus CD8(+) T cells.

To characterize the fate of early hematopoietic progenitor cells during ex vivo expansion in suspension culture, human CD34(+)-enriched BPC were cultured in serum-free medium in the presence of FLT3 ligand (FL), stem cell factor (SCF) and interleukin 3 (IL-3). Both CD34 surface expression levels and the percentage of CD34+ cells were continuously downregulated during the culture period. We observed an expansion of colony-forming units granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) and BFU-E beginning on day 3 of culture, reaching an approximate 2-log increase by days 5 to 7. Limiting dilution analysis of primitive in vitro clonogenic progenitors was performed through a week 6 cobblestone-area-forming cell (CAFC) assay, which has previously been shown to detect long-term bone marrow culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC). A maintenance or a slight (threefold) increase of week 6 CAFC/LTC-IC was found after one week of culture. To analyze the presence of BPC mediating in vivo engraftment, expanded CD34+ cells were transplanted into preirradiated NOD/SCID mice at various time points. Only CD34+ cells cultured for up to four days successfully engrafted murine bone marrow with human cells expressing myeloid or lymphoid progenitor phenotypes. In contrast, five- and seven-day expanded human BPC did not detectably engraft NOD/SCID mice. When FL, SCF and IL-3-supplemented cultures were performed for seven days on fibronectin-coated plastic, or when IL-3 was replaced by thrombopoietin, colony forming cells and LTC-IC reached levels similar to those of control cultures, yet no human cell engraftment was recorded in the mice. Also, culture in U-bottom microplates resulting in locally increased CD34+ cell density had no positive effect on engraftment. These results indicate that during ex vivo expansion of human CD34+ cells, CFC and LTC-IC numbers do not correlate with the potential to repopulate NOD/SCID mice. Our results suggest that ex vivo expanded BPC should be cultured for limited time periods only, in order to preserve bone-marrow-repopulating hematopoietic stem cells.",

Forty-three patients (22%) responded to salvage (35 CR and 8 CR without platelet recovery). With a median follow-up of 72 months (range, 27-118 months) in responders, 11 are alive. Nineteen patients (7%) were alive and in CR for at least 6 months, including 9 who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation. On multivariate analysis, severe thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, increasing marrow blast percentage, unfavorable cytogenetics, and salvage not including allogeneic stem cell transplantation were associated with a worse survival. Alternative strategies are needed for these patients.",

The work was based on the recent radiation accident in Dakar (Senegal). A score was developed based on the complete blood count and the plasma Flt3 ligand concentration of each of the 63 potential victims of this accident. The three victims who received the highest radiation dose, as defined by cytogenetic analysis, were easily detected by this score analysis. A correlation was obtained between the score and the radiation dose. This score might allow a triage of radiation accident victims based on simple parameters that are easy and fast to obtain. This score is simple to interpret and might allow the identification of victims at risk of developing an acute radiation syndrome. Interestingly, as the parameters used in this score evolve according to the development of the haematopoietic syndrome, this score may be applicable for several weeks after the radiation accident, even in a case of protracted exposure, as happened in the Dakar accident.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Patients surviving acute stages of sepsis often display impaired adaptive-immune responses. Using the cecal ligation and puncture model, we demonstrated that sepsis leads to substantial and long-lasting changes in the naive CD8 T cell repertoire, affecting the capacity of the host to respond to new infections. However, the identity of CD8 T cell-extrinsic factor(s) and mechanism(s) that contribute to impaired CD8 T cell responses after sepsis is unknown. Priming of naive CD8 T cells is critically dependent on the ability of dendritic cells (DCs) to provide Ag, costimulation, and inflammatory signal 3 cytokines; therefore, the sepsis-induced changes in the DC compartment might represent a contributing factor leading to diminished CD8 T cell immunity in septic hosts. In a direct test of this hypothesis, we show that, in addition to numerical decline, sepsis leads to functional impairments in DCs, diminishing their capacity to produce cytokines upon TLR stimulation in vitro or postinfection in vivo. Importantly, we demonstrated a direct link between DC dysfunction and impairments in CD8 T cell immunity after sepsis by directly targeting Ag to DCs. Finally, postsepsis Flt3 ligand treatment increased the number of DCs and improved DC function, including the ability to sense inflammation and produce IL-12, leading to improved primary CD8 T cell responses to newly encountered Ags. Thus, sepsis-induced numerical and functional loss of DCs contributes to the observed defects in CD8 T cell immunity, and therapeutic approaches designed to improve the status of the DC compartment after sepsis might facilitate the recovery of CD8 T cell immunity.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an important human pathogen that causes chronic liver disease worldwide. It is desirable to develop vaccines to prevent HCV infection, or at least to prevent progression to chronicity. We once constructed an optimized hepatitis C virus core and envelope 2 fusion antigen DNA vaccine, which could induce humoral and cellular immune responses against HCV core and E2 protein in BALB/c mice efficiently. Flt3 (Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3) -ligand has been identified as an important cytokine for the generation of professional antigen-presenting cells, particularly dendritic cells. We reasoned that a DNA vaccine coexpressing the antigen and FL may activate immune responses more effectually. In this study, The influence of FL on this HCV DNA vaccine was evaluated. The cDNA encoding signal peptide and extracellular domain of murine FL was inserted into the plasmid pST-CE2t, and the resulting plasmid pST-CE2t/FL was transfected into COS7 cells. The HCV core and E2 protein were detected by Western blotting, and the soluble murine FL was detected by ELISA. Eight-week-old female BALB/c mice were inoculated intramuscularly with 100 microg pST-CE2t, pST-CE2t/FL or mock vector, respectively, and boosted at the same dosage 3 weeks later. Anti-HCV core and E2 total IgG and isotypes were measured at weeks 1,3,5,7. Splenocyte proliferative response to recombinant HCV core and E2 protrein were detected at week 7. SP2/0 cells expressing HCV core protein were used as target cells for the detection of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response. Western blot analysis showed that a protein band with molecular weight about 70 kD from lysate of COS7 cells transfected with plasmid pST-CE2t/FL could be detected by anti-HCV core or E2 monoclonal antibodies, which indicated that pST-CE2t could express glucosylated HCV core and E2 fusion protein. Murine FL could be detected in the culture supernatant of COS7 cells transfected with pST-CE2t/FL. Plasmid pST-CE2t immunized mice developed higher anti-HCV core and E2 IgG seroconversion rates and titers than pST-CE2t/FL group did at different various times, but the IgG2a/IgG1 ratio of anti-HCV E2 protein in pST-CE2t/FL group is much higher than pST-CE2t group. Splenocytes from pST-CE2t or pST-CE2t/FL immunized mice could proliferate with stimulation of HCV core or E2 protein in vitro, although pST-CE2t/FL group showed much stronger response. Splenocytes from mice immunized with pST-CE2t/FL induced 79.03% +/- 9.95% of target cell lysis at the effector/target ratio of 100:1, which was significantly greater than the lysis (62.2% +/- 8.62%) observed in mice immunized with pST-CE2t. Our data demonstrated that the incorporation of FL can preferentially enhance the cellular response to this HCV fusion antigen DNA vaccine. In contrast, HCV specific antibodies were inhibited by FL in vaccinated mice. More and more data supports that recovery from acute HCV infection may depend upon the generation of broad-based cellular immune responses to viral proteins. So, FL may be of potential value as an adjuvant in the development of DNA-based immunization for prophylactic and therapeutic vaccine against HCV infection.",
