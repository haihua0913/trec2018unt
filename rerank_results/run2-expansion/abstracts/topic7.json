We sought to identify the core resistance pathways and the extent of tumor heterogeneity during disease progression. We show that mitogen-activated protein kinase reactivation mechanisms were detected among 70% of disease-progressive tissues, with RAS mutations, mutant BRAF amplification, and alternative splicing being most common. We also detected PI3K-PTEN-AKT-upregulating genetic alterations among 22% of progressive melanomas. Distinct molecular lesions in both core drug escape pathways were commonly detected concurrently in the same tumor or among multiple tumors from the same patient. Beyond harboring extensively heterogeneous resistance mechanisms, melanoma regrowth emerging from BRAF inhibitor selection displayed branched evolution marked by altered mutational spectra/signatures and increased fitness. Thus, melanoma genomic heterogeneity contributes significantly to BRAF inhibitor treatment failure, implying upfront, cotargeting of two core pathways as an essential strategy for durable responses.

Tumors with BRAF mutations have increased mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activity and heightened sensitivity to BRAF and MEK (mitogen-activated or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase) inhibitors. To identify potential mechanisms of acquired drug resistance, we generated clones resistant to the allosteric MEK inhibitor AZD6244 from two BRAF V600E mutant colorectal cancer cell lines that are highly sensitive to MEK or BRAF inhibition. These AZD6244-resistant (AR) clones, which exhibited cross-resistance to BRAF inhibitors, acquired resistance through amplification of the BRAF gene. A small percentage of treatment-naïve parental cells showed preexisting BRAF amplification. We observed similar amplification in a subset of cells in a BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer. In cell lines, BRAF amplification increased the abundance of phosphorylated MEK and impaired the ability of AZD6244 to inhibit ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) phosphorylation. The ability of AZD6244 to inhibit ERK phosphorylation in AR cells was restored by treatment with a BRAF inhibitor at low concentrations that reduced the abundance of phosphorylated MEK to amounts observed in parental cells. Combined MEK and BRAF inhibition fully overcame resistance to MEK or BRAF inhibitors alone and was also more effective in parental cells compared to treatment with either inhibitor alone. These findings implicate BRAF amplification as a mechanism of resistance to both MEK and BRAF inhibitors and suggest combined MEK and BRAF inhibition as a clinical strategy to overcome, or possibly prevent, this mechanism of resistance.",

Because the activating mutations are dominant, it has been assumed that they are heterozygous in the affected tumors. To test this, we have carefully examined the DNA sequencing electropherograms on 43 BRAF mutation-positive and 3 c-kit mutation-positive malignant melanomas to determine the ratio of the normal to mutant allele. Of the 43 BRAF mutation-positive tumors, we classified 26 as presumptive heterozygous. Eight cases were indeterminate. Surprisingly, 9 cases appeared to contain an excess of the mutant allele. BRAF fluorescence in situ hybridization on these 9 cases suggested the increased amount of the mutant BRAF allele was due to amplification (2 cases) or chromosome 7 polysomy (7 cases). We have previously described the presence of the c-kit-activating mutation, L576P, in 2 of 100 malignant melanomas. In this report, we have evaluated an additional 53 cases and found 1 additional case that contained the L576P mutation. Evaluation of the DNA sequencing electropherograms from all 3 cases of L576P mutation-positive melanoma suggests a selective loss of the normal allele. Fluorescence in situ hybridization for c-kit on these 3 L576P mutation-positive tumors indicated that one showed slight amplification of the c-kit gene and the other 2 were present in a nonamplified diploid state.

While the role of BRAF(V600E) in tumorigenesis is well established, its involvement in metastasis that is clinically observed in melanoma patients remains a topic of debate. Here, we show that BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells have extensive invasion activity as assayed by the generation of F-actin and cortactin foci that mediate membrane protrusion, and degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Inhibition of BRAF(V600E) blocks melanoma cell invasion. In a BRAF(V600E)-driven murine melanoma model or in patients' tumor biopsies, cortactin foci decrease upon inhibitor treatment. In addition, genome-wide expression analysis shows that a number of invadopodia-related genes are downregulated after BRAF(V600E) inhibition. Mechanistically, BRAF(V600E) induces phosphorylation of cortactin and the exocyst subunit Exo70 through ERK, which regulates actin dynamics and matrix metalloprotease secretion, respectively. Our results provide support for the role of BRAF(V600E) in metastasis and suggest that inhibiting invasion is a potential therapeutic strategy against melanoma. ",

We performed cytotoxicity and apoptosis assays, and a xenograft mouse model to determine the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of JQ1 in combination with Vemurafenib against BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines. Further, to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of combined treatment, we conducted antibody arrays of in vitro drug-treated cell lines and RNA sequencing of drug-treated xenograft tumors. The combination of JQ1 and Vemurafenib acted synergistically in BRAF-mutant cell lines, resulting in marked apoptosis in vitro, with upregulation of proapoptotic proteins. In vivo, combination treatment suppressed tumor growth and significantly improved survival compared to either drug alone. RNA sequencing of tumor tissues revealed almost four thousand genes that were uniquely modulated by the combination, with several anti-apoptotic genes significantly down-regulated.

        "Doc_abstract":"BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) therapy leads to remarkable anti melanoma responses, but the initial tumor shrinkage is commonly incomplete, providing a nidus for subsequent disease progression. Adaptive signaling may underlie early BRAFi resistance and influence the selection pattern for genetic variants, causing late, acquired resistance. We show here that BRAFi (or BRAFi + MEKi) therapy in patients frequently led to rebound phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) levels in their melanomas early on-treatment. In cell lines, BRAFi treatment led to rebound levels of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK; including PDGFRβ), phosphatidyl (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3), pleckstrin homology domain recruitment, and p-AKT. PTEN expression limited this BRAFi-elicited PI3K-AKT signaling, which could be rescued by the introduction of a mutant AKT1 (Q79K) known to confer acquired BRAFi resistance. Functionally, AKT1(Q79K) conferred BRAFi resistance via amplification of BRAFi-elicited PI3K-AKT signaling. In addition, mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway inhibition enhanced clonogenic growth dependency on PI3K or AKT. Thus, adaptive or genetic upregulation of AKT critically participates in melanoma survival during BRAFi therapy. ",

BRAF, a critical serine/threonine kinase in this pathway, is frequently activated by somatic mutation in melanoma. Using a cohort of 115 patients with primary invasive melanomas, we show that BRAF mutations are statistically significantly more common in melanomas occurring on skin subject to intermittent sun exposure than elsewhere (23 of 43 patients; P<.001, two-sided Fisher's exact test). By contrast, BRAF mutations in melanomas on chronically sun-damaged skin (1 of 12 patients) and melanomas on skin relatively or completely unexposed to sun, such as palms, soles, subungual sites (6 of 39 patients), and mucosal membranes (2 of 21 patients) are rare. We found no association of mutation status with clinical outcome or with the presence of an associated melanocytic nevus. The mutated BRAF allele was frequently found at an elevated copy number, implicating BRAF as one of the factors driving selection for the frequent copy number increases of chromosome 7q in melanoma. In summary, the uneven distribution of BRAF mutations strongly suggests distinct genetic pathways leading to melanoma.

To identify molecular alterations driving clinical acquired resistance, we performed whole-exome sequencing on paired pretreatment and postprogression tumor biopsies from patients with BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer treated with RAF inhibitor combinations. We identified alterations in MAPK pathway genes in resistant tumors not present in matched pretreatment tumors, including KRAS amplification, BRAF amplification, and a MEK1 mutation. These alterations conferred resistance to RAF/EGFR or RAF/MEK combinations through sustained MAPK pathway activity, but an ERK inhibitor could suppress MAPK activity and overcome resistance. Identification of MAPK pathway reactivating alterations upon clinical acquired resistance underscores the MAPK pathway as a critical target in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer and suggests therapeutic options to overcome resistance.;RAF inhibitor combinations represent promising approaches in clinical development for BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer.

Characterization of gene copy numbers was performed by quantitative PCR and, as an alternative method, fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to define the CCND1 amplification pattern at the single cell level. Samples with amplified CCND1 (32%) were further analyzed for copy number alterations for the TAOS1, FGF3, FGF19, FGF4 and EMS1 genes. Co-amplification of the CCND1 and TAOS1 was present in 15% of tumors and was more frequent in ulcerated lesions (P=0.017). Furthermore, 56% of primary melanomas had either BRAF or NRAS mutations, but these two mutations were not present in any of the lesions analyzed. Of these cases, 34% also had CCND1 amplification. There was a significant relationship between NRAS activating mutations and UV exposure (P=0.005). We did not find correlations between CCND1 gene amplification status and any of the patients' clinicopathological parameters. However, CCND1 amplification simultaneously with either BRAF or NRAS activation mutations was observed mainly in primary tumors with ulcerated surfaces (P=0.028).

The results indicated that a wide range of genes with broad functions were linked to BRAF(V600E) signaling through their hyper- or hypomethylation. Expression of 59 genes hypermethylated upon BRAF knockdown was selectively tested and found to be largely correspondingly underexpressed, suggesting that these genes were naturally hypomethylated, and overexpressed with BRAF(V600E) in melanoma. This BRAF(V600E)-promoted hypomethylation was confirmed on genes selectively examined in primary melanoma tumors. Some of these genes were functionally tested and demonstrated to play a role in melanoma cell proliferation and invasion. As a mechanism of aberrant gene methylation driven by BRAF(V600E), expression of the DNA methyltransferase 1 and histone methyltransferase EZH2 was profoundly affected by BRAF(V600E).

We used dermoscopy-targeted sampling and a microbiopsy device coupled with DNA sequence analysis to highlight BRAF V600E heterogeneity within a multicomponent melanocytic proliferation. This sampling technique demonstrates the prospect of in vivo application in a clinical setting.;A man in his 50s with Fitzpatrick skin type II presented with an irregularly pigmented melanocytic lesion on his back that met melanoma-specific dermoscopic criteria, and diagnostic shave excision of the lesion was performed. Histopathologic analysis revealed a melanoma in situ arising in a dysplastic nevus. Dermoscopy-targeted microbiopsy specimens were taken across the lesion, and genotyping was carried out on extracted DNA samples for BRAF and NRAS mutations. The melanoma in situ showed only BRAF wild-type results, while the dysplastic nevus showed both BRAF wild-type and BRAF V600E mutations. Sequencing in all DNA samples revealed NRAS wild-type genotype.;Dermoscopy-targeted sampling and genotyping of a melanoma in situ arising in a dysplastic nevus revealed a phenotype-genotype paradox that confounds the exclusive significance of BRAF and NRAS mutations in melanoma pathogenesis.

Iris melanoma is the least common uveal melanoma and displays a less aggressive clinical course compared with posterior uveal melanoma. To date, no study has been conducted to investigate the T1799A mutation in iris melanoma. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the T1799A BRAF mutation is present in iris melanoma.;DNA was extracted from 19 archival, paraffin-embedded tissue sections of iris melanomas. Nested PCR was used to amplify exon 15 of the BRAF gene, and the product was purified, cloned into a sequencing vector, and sequenced. The sequences obtained were compared with the wild-type sequence of the BRAF gene. The presence or absence of the BRAF mutation was also compared with the clinicopathological features.;The T1799A mutation was identified by sequencing in 9 of 19 iris melanomas. Six of the 9 cases with the BRAF mutation were recurrent tumors. All other tumors were resections for primary tumors. There was a statistically significant association between the BRAF mutation and recurrent tumor (P = 0.003). There was no association between the presence of the BRAF mutation and other clinicopathological characteristics.;In this small study, the T1799A BRAF mutation was identified in almost half of the iris melanoma tissues samples examined.

In the present study, we used mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics to determine how BRAF inhibition remodeled the signaling network of melanoma cell lines that were BRAF mutant and PTEN null. Short-term BRAF inhibition was associated with marked changes in fibronectin-based adhesion signaling that were PTEN dependent. These effects were recapitulated through BRAF siRNA knockdown and following treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs. Increased fibronectin expression was also observed in mouse xenograft models as well as specimens from melanoma patients undergoing BRAF inhibitor treatment. Analysis of a melanoma tissue microarray showed loss of PTEN expression to predict for a lower overall survival, with a trend for even lower survival being seen when loss of fibronectin was included in the analysis. Mechanistically, the induction of fibronectin limited the responses of these PTEN-null melanoma cell lines to vemurafenib, with enhanced cytotoxicity observed following the knockdown of either fibronectin or its receptor α5β1 integrin. This in turn abrogated the cytotoxic response to BRAF inhibition via increased AKT signaling, which prevented the induction of cell death by maintaining the expression of the pro-survival protein Mcl-1. The protection conveyed by the induction of FN expression could be overcome through combined treatment with a BRAF and PI3K inhibitor. ",

Similar targeting of BRAF(V599E) or wild-type BRAF in human fibrosarcoma cells that lack the BRAF(V599E) mutation does not recapitulate these effects. Moreover, these results are specific for BRAF, as targeted interference of CRAF in melanoma cells does not significantly alter their biological properties.

Thus far, there is very limited data combining BRAF and NRAS mutation analysis to explore differences between cutaneous melanoma subtypes. The aim of this study was to address this issue.;The frequency of BRAF and NRAS hotspot mutations, in exons 15 and 2, respectively, was assessed in 59 cutaneous melanomas comprising superficial spreading, nodular, lentigo maligna, and ALM using single-strand conformational polymorphism and RFLP-PCR analysis.;Only 2 of 21 (9.5%) ALM showed BRAF exon 15 mutation compared with 9 of 14 (64.3%) superficial spreading malignant melanomas, 4 of 11 (36.4%) nodular melanomas, and 7 of 13 (53.4%) lentigo maligna melanomas (P < 0.01). However, our key finding is that the combined analysis of BRAF exon 15 and NRAS exon 2 showed that there were no significant differences in the overall mutation frequency between subtypes. In particular, 9 of 19 (47.4%) ALM without BRAF exon 15 mutation had an NRAS exon 2 mutation.;We show that the overall BRAF/NRAS frequency in mutation hotspots is not significantly different among cutaneous melanoma subtypes.

The interval from diagnosis of first-ever melanoma to distant metastasis was not significantly different between BRAF-mutant and BRAF wild-type patients; however, the median survival of patients with newly diagnosed metastatic melanoma was 5.7 months for BRAF-mutant patients not treated with a BRAF inhibitor, 8.5 months for BRAF wild-type patients, and not reached for BRAF-mutant patients treated with a BRAF inhibitor.;V600K mutations comprised 20% of BRAF mutations. Characteristics of the antecedent primary melanoma and age at diagnosis differed in BRAF-mutant and BRAF wild-type patients.

The present technologies used to screen for this mutation fail to address the problems associated with infiltrating stromal and immune cells bearing wild-type BRAF alleles and thus may fail to detect the presence of mutant BRAF(V600E) tumors. We have developed a rapid, inexpensive method of BRAF analysis that reduces the contamination of wild-type BRAF sequences from tumor biopsies. The protocol involves a series of PCR amplifications and restriction digestions that take advantage of unique features of both wild-type and mutant BRAF RNA at codon 600.

Of significance is a single hotspot codon, i.e., BRAF V600, wherein up to 92% of all mutations arise. Recent work in our laboratory has demonstrated that solar ultraviolet (UV) irradiation triggers mutagenesis through induction of various DNA lesions, many of which capable of producing similar types of mutations, as those seen in BRAF V600 variants in human melanoma. In this review article, we have discussed application of \"DNA damage-targeted mutagenicity\" of solar UV-irradiation for determining the mechanistic involvement of sunlight UV in BRAF V600 mutagenesis in human melanoma.

Polymorphisms or other variants in the BRAF gene may therefore act as candidate low-penetrance genes for nevus/melanoma susceptibility. We hypothesized that promoter variants would be the most likely candidates for determinants of risk. Using denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography and sequencing, we screened peripheral blood DNA from 184 familial melanoma cases for BRAF promoter variants. We identified a promoter insertion/deletion in linkage disequilibrium with the previously described BRAF polymorphism in intron 11 (rs1639679) reported to be associated with melanoma susceptibility in males. We therefore investigated the contribution of this BRAF polymorphism to melanoma susceptibility in 581 consecutively recruited incident cases, 258 incident cases in a study of late relapse, 673 female general practitioner controls, and the 184 familial cases. We found no statistically significant difference in either genotype or allele frequencies between cases and controls overall or between male and female cases for the BRAF polymorphism in the two incident case series. Our results therefore suggest that the BRAF polymorphism is not significantly associated with melanoma and the promoter insertion/deletion linked with the polymorphism is not a causal variant.

Not only downregulation of the endogenously overexpressed wild-type B-Raf by antisense oligonucleotide but also a treatment with an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK, MEK) reduced phosphorylated ERK1/2 and cell growth, whereas the exogenously expressed wild-type B-Raf promoted cell growth in MM cells.

The canine BRAF gene was first cloned from normal canine testicular cDNA, and a novel previously unreported splice variant involving exon 5 was identified during this process. To screen canine melanoma samples for BRAF mutation in codon 599, cDNA and genomic DNA were isolated from canine malignant melanoma cell lines and primary tumor samples respectively, all from cases seen at the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital at the University of California, Davis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed for exon 15 using primers based at the 5' end of exon 15 and the 5' end of intron 15 and the resultant products were directly sequenced. No mutations in codon 599 or exon 15 were identified in any of the 17 samples evaluated. However, all of the melanoma cell lines expressed BRAF and demonstrated high levels of basal ERK phosphorylation suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway is present. Therefore, similar to the case with human mucosal melanomas, canine oral malignant melanomas do not possess codon 599 BRAF mutations commonly identified in human cutaneous melanomas.

Here we used a mouse model of melanoma in which melanocyte-specific expression of Braf(V618E) (analogous to the human BRAF(V600E) mutation) led to the development of skin hyperpigmentation and nevi, as well as melanoma formation with incomplete penetrance. Sleeping Beauty insertional mutagenesis in this model led to accelerated and fully penetrant melanomagenesis and synchronous tumor formation. Treatment of Braf(V618E) transposon mice with the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 resulted in tumor regression followed by relapse. Analysis of transposon insertions identified eight genes including Braf, Mitf, and ERas (ES-cell expressed Ras) as candidate resistance genes. Expression of ERAS in human melanoma cell lines conferred resistance to PLX4720 and induced hyperphosphorylation of AKT (v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1), a phenotype reverted by combinatorial treatment with PLX4720 and the AKT inhibitor MK2206. We show that ERAS expression elicits a prosurvival signal associated with phosphorylation/inactivation of BAD, and that the resistance of hepatocyte growth factor-treated human melanoma cells to PLX4720 can be reverted by treatment with the BAD-like BH3 mimetic ABT-737. Thus, we define a role for the AKT/BAD pathway in resistance to BRAF inhibition and illustrate an in vivo approach for finding drug resistance genes.",

Some melanomas are spindled and may show no immunohistochemical evidence of melanocytic differentiation. Similarly, many sarcomas are undifferentiated, i.e. undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas (UPS). Diagnosing melanoma versus sarcoma in an undifferentiated spindle cell malignancy can be challenging. Our aim was to evaluate the prevalence of BRAF mutation in sarcomas and the use of BRAF mutational status in the diagnosis of spindle cell malignancies.;BRAF mutational analysis was performed on tissue from 104 patients: 90 with sarcoma only (50 UPS) and 14 with sarcoma and melanoma (seven UPS). In the sarcoma-only group, BRAF mutation was absent. In the sarcoma-melanoma group, three sarcomas showed BRAF mutation; all were UPS, occurred after the melanomas and did not stain for melanocytic markers. One melanoma-sarcoma pair showed identical BRAF V600E mutations.;The presence of BRAF mutation in these tumours raises the possibility that poorly differentiated spindle cell malignancies with BRAF mutation may represent melanomas, and BRAF mutational analysis should be considered in a patient with a spindle cell malignancy and a history of melanoma, as a positive result may indicate de-differentiated melanoma.",

In contrast, colon cancers that harbour the same BRAF(V600E) mutation are intrinsically resistant to BRAF inhibitors, due to feedback activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Here we show that 6 out of 16 melanoma tumours analysed acquired EGFR expression after the development of resistance to BRAF or MEK inhibitors. Using a chromatin-regulator-focused short hairpin RNA (shRNA) library, we find that suppression of sex determining region Y-box 10 (SOX10) in melanoma causes activation of TGF-β signalling, thus leading to upregulation of EGFR and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFRB), which confer resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Expression of EGFR in melanoma or treatment with TGF-β results in a slow-growth phenotype with cells displaying hallmarks of oncogene-induced senescence. However, EGFR expression or exposure to TGF-β becomes beneficial for proliferation in the presence of BRAF or MEK inhibitors. In a heterogeneous population of melanoma cells having varying levels of SOX10 suppression, cells with low SOX10 and consequently high EGFR expression are rapidly enriched in the presence of drug, but this is reversed when the drug treatment is discontinued. We find evidence for SOX10 loss and/or activation of TGF-β signalling in 4 of the 6 EGFR-positive drug-resistant melanoma patient samples. Our findings provide a rationale for why some BRAF or MEK inhibitor-resistant melanoma patients may regain sensitivity to these drugs after a 'drug holiday' and identify patients with EGFR-positive melanoma as a group that may benefit from re-treatment after a drug holiday.

Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK) signaling plays an essential role in the progression of many cancers, including melanoma and colon cancers. However, no single miRNA is reported to directly target multiple components of the MAPK/ERK pathway. We performed a miRNA PCR array screening with various MAPK/ERK signaling activities. The miRNA array data revealed that the expression of miR-524-5p was decreased in cells with an active MAPK/ERK pathway and confirmed that the expression of miR-524-5p is inversely associated with the activity of the MAPK/ERK pathway. We demonstrated that miR-524-5p directly binds to the 3'-untranslated regions of both BRAFandERK2 and suppresses the expression of these proteins. Because BRAF and ERK2 are the main components of MAPK signaling, the overexpression of miR-524-5p effectively inhibits MAPK/ERK signaling, tumor proliferation, and melanoma cell migration. Moreover, tumors overexpressing miR-524-5p were significantly smaller than those of the negative control mice. Our findings provide new insight into the role of miR-524-5p as an important miRNA that negatively regulates the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, suggesting that miR-524-5p could be a potent therapeutic candidate for melanoma treatment.

        "Doc_abstract":"Human malignant melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer with an exceptionally bad prognosis. Melanoma often displays constitutively activated MAPK pathway through BRAF or NRAS mutations. It is also known that these mutations are almost never simultaneously present and that they appear at early stages and preserved throughout tumor progression, although it is proved that these alterations alone are insufficient to cause tumor progression. Therefore the first aim of our study was to evaluate those distinct genetic alterations which can properly differentiate the three important molecular subtypes of primary melanomas with a) BRAF, b) NRAS mutation and c) WT (wild type for both loci). High-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) was used to assess genome-wide analysis of DNA copy number alterations. Primary melanomas with BRAF mutation more frequently exhibited losses on 10q23-10q26 and gains on chromosome 7 and 1q23-1q25 compared to melanomas with NRAS mutation. Loss on the 11q23-11q25 sequence was found mainly in conjunction with NRAS mutation. Based on these results, we proved the existence of marked differences in the genetic pattern of the BRAF and NRAS mutated melanoma subgroups, which might suggest that these mutations contribute to the development of malignant melanoma in conjunction with distinct cooperating oncogenic events. In general, it is an interesting phenomenon suggesting that these mutations provide probably the \"guiding force\" for these tumors and it also suggests that there are alternative genetic pathways to melanoma. These additional oncogenic events which are associated with BRAF or NRAS mutations can provide rational additional targets for a combination therapy with kinase inhibitors. In this study we also investigated the specific dynamic activities among different signalling pathways highlighting the frequent alterations of genes involved in the signalling interactions between the MAPK-JAK pathways in BRAF mutated melanomas. Using a data mining algorithm we also found a gene alteration signature in the MAPK pathway that was commonly related to the presence of BRAF mutation in our melanoma cohorts. The second aim of this study was to develop an accurate Q-PCR method for determining the co-amplification pattern of six candidate genes that reside in the 11q13 amplicon core. We found that co-amplification of these candidate genes or the CCND1 amplification along with either BRAF or NRAS mutations might be more important for prognosis than the presence of these alterations alone. ;A malignus melanóma a legrosszabb indulatú bõrdaganat, mely fokozott metasztázisképzéssel és gyógyszer-rezisztenciával jellemezhetõ.

In all, 41 melanoma obtained from eight primary lesions, 20 nodal, 11 cutaneous and two visceral metastases from patients with sporadic (n=31), familial (n=4) and multiple melanoma (n=2) were analysed. The results revealed novel missense mutations in the BRAF, PTEN, CDKN2A and CDK4 genes. Overall, activating mutations of BRAF and loss of functional p16 and ARF were detected in the majority of melanomas (29/41, 36/41 and 29/41, respectively), while PTEN alterations/loss, NRAS and TP53 mutations occurred less frequently (6/41, 6/41 and 10/41, respectively). In the resulting 12 mutational profiles, p16/ARF loss associated with mutated BRAFV599E was the most represented (n=15). In addition, TP53 and PTEN mutations were always accompanied with BRAF alterations, while PTEN loss was found in association with CDKN2A or TP53 mutations in the absence of BRAF activation. The p16/ARFDelta+BRAF/RAS profile was significantly associated with a longer survival, while complex mutational profiles were detected in highly aggressive disease and poor survival.

Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that vemurafenib (PLX4032) and dabrafenib, potent and selective inhibitors of mutant v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF), exhibit remarkable activities in patients with V600 BRAF mutant melanomas. However, acquired drug resistance invariably develops after the initial treatment. Identification of acquired resistance mechanisms may inform the development of new therapies that elicit long-term responses of melanomas to BRAF inhibitors. Here we report that increased expression of AEBP1 (adipocyte enhancer-binding protein 1) confers acquired resistance to BRAF inhibition in melanoma. AEBP1 is shown to be highly upregulated in PLX4032-resistant melanoma cells because of the hyperactivation of the PI3K/Akt-cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) signaling pathway. This upregulates AEBP1 expression and thus leads to the activation of NF-κB via accelerating IκBa degradation. In addition, inhibition of the PI3K/Akt-CREB-AEBP1-NF-κB pathway greatly reverses the PLX4032-resistant phenotype of melanoma cells. Furthermore, increased expression of AEBP1 is validated in post-treatment tumors in patients with acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitor. Therefore, these results reveal a novel PI3K/Akt-CREB-AEBP1-NF-κB pathway whose activation contributes to acquired resistance to BRAF inhibition, and suggest that this pathway, particularly AEBP1, may represent a novel therapeutic target for treating BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma.

This study was to identify BRAF V600E-associated oncogenic pathways that predict resistance of BRAF-mutated melanoma to BRAF/MEK inhibitors. We took in silico approaches to analyze the activities of 24 cancer-related pathways in melanoma cells and identify those whose activation was associated with BRAF V600E and used the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to predict the resistance of BRAF-mutated melanoma cells to BRAF/MEK inhibitors. We then experimentally confirmed the in silico findings. In a microarray gene expression dataset of 63 melanoma cell lines, we found that activation of multiple oncogenic pathways preferentially occurred in BRAF-mutated melanoma cells. This finding was reproduced in 5 additional independent melanoma datasets. Further analysis of 46 melanoma cell lines that harbored BRAF mutation showed that 7 pathways, including TNFα, EGFR, IFNα, hypoxia, IFNγ, STAT3, and MYC, were significantly differently expressed in AZD6244-resistant compared with responsive melanoma cells. A SVM classifier built on this 7-pathway activation pattern correctly predicted the response of 10 BRAF-mutated melanoma cell lines to the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 in our experiments. We experimentally showed that TNFα, EGFR, IFNα, and IFNγ pathway activities were also upregulated in melanoma cell A375 compared with its sub-line DRO, while DRO was much more sensitive to AZD6244 than A375. In conclusion, we have identified specific oncogenic pathways preferentially activated in BRAF-mutated melanoma cells and a pathway pattern that predicts resistance of BRAF-mutated melanoma to BRAF/MEK inhibitors, providing novel clinical implications for melanoma therapy.

BRAFV600E has been implicated in different mechanisms underlying melanomagenesis, most of which due to the deregulated activation of the downstream MEK/ERK effectors. The first selective inhibitor of mutant BRAF, vemurafenib, after highly encouraging results of the phase I and II trial, was compared to dacarbazine in a phase III trial in treatment-naïve patients (BRIM-3). The study results showed a relative reduction of 63 % in risk of death and 74 % in risk of tumor progression. Considering all trials so far completed, median overall survival reached approximately 16 months for vemurafenib compared to less than 10 months for dacarbazine treatment. Vemurafenib has been extensively tested on melanoma patients expressing the BRAFV600E mutated form; it has been demonstrated to be also effective in inhibiting melanomas carrying the V600K mutation. In 2011, both FDA and EMA therefore approved vemurafenib for metastatic melanoma carrying BRAFV600 mutations. Some findings suggest that continuation of vemurafenib treatment is potentially beneficial after local therapy in a subset of patients with disease progression (PD). Among who continued vemurafenib >30 days after local therapy of PD lesion(s), a median overall survival was not reached, with a median follow-up of 15.5 months from initiation of BRAF inhibitor therapy. For patients who did not continue treatment, median overall survival from the time of disease progression was 1.4 months. A clinical phase I/II trial is evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of vemurafenib in combination with the CTLA-4 inhibitor mAb ipilimumab. In the BRIM-7 trial vemurafenib is tested in association with GDC-0973, a potent and highly selective inhibitor of MEK1/2. Preliminary data seem to indicate that an additional inhibitor of mutated BRAF, GSK2118436, might be also active on a wider range of BRAF mutations (V600E-K-D-R); actually, treatment with such a compound is under evaluation in a phase III study among stage III-IV melanoma patients positive for BRAF mutations. Overall, BRAF inhibitors were well tolerated; common adverse events are arthralgia, rash, fatigue, alopecia, keratoacanthoma or cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma, photosensitivity, nausea, and diarrhea, with some variants between different inhibitors.",

The energy-sensing AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is known to be a major cellular target of biguanides. Based on our discovery of cross-talk between the AMPK and v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) signaling pathways, we investigated the antitumor effects of combining phenformin with a BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 on the proliferation of BRAF-mutated melanoma cells in vitro and on BRAF-driven tumor growth in vivo. Cotreatment of BRAF-mutated melanoma cell lines with phenformin and PLX4720 resulted in synergistic inhibition of cell viability, compared with the effects of the single agent alone. Moreover, treatment with phenformin significantly delayed the development of resistance to PLX4720 in cultured melanoma cells. Biochemical analyses showed that phenformin and PLX4720 exerted cooperative effects on inhibiting mTOR signaling and inducing apoptosis. Noticeably, phenformin selectively targeted subpopulations of cells expressing JARID1B, a marker for slow cycling melanoma cells, whereas PLX4720 selectively targeted JARID1B-negative cells. Finally, in contrast to their use as single agents, the combination of phenformin and PLX4720 induced tumor regression in both nude mice bearing melanoma xenografts and in a genetically engineered BRAF(V600E)/PTEN(null)-driven mouse model of melanoma. These results strongly suggest that significant therapeutic advantage may be achieved by combining AMPK activators such as phenformin with BRAF inhbitors for the treatment of melanoma. ",

In order to explore the antitumor activity of prenylation inhibition we investigated the response to zoledronic acid treatment in thirteen human melanoma cell lines with known BRAF, NRAS and PTEN mutational status. Effect of zoledronic acid on proliferation, clonogenic potential, apoptosis and migration of melanoma cells as well as the activation of downstream elements of the RAS/RAF pathway were investigated in vitro with SRB, TUNEL and PARP cleavage assays and videomicroscopy and immunoblot measurements, respectively. Subcutaneous and spleen-to-liver colonization xenograft mouse models were used to evaluate the influence of zoledronic acid treatment on primary and disseminated tumor growth of melanoma cells in vivo. Zoledronic acid more efficiently decreased short-term in vitro viability in NRAS mutant cells when compared to BRAF mutant and BRAF/NRAS wild-type cells. In line with this finding, following treatment decreased activation of ribosomal protein S6 was found in NRAS mutant cells. Zoledronic acid demonstrated no significant synergism in cell viability inhibition or apoptosis induction with cisplatin or DTIC treatment in vitro. Importantly, zoledronic acid could inhibit clonogenic growth in the majority of melanoma cell lines except in the three BRAF mutant but PTEN wild-type melanoma lines. A similar pattern was observed in apoptosis induction experiments. In vivo zoledronic acid did not inhibit the subcutaneous growth or spleen-to-liver colonization of melanoma cells. Altogether our data demonstrates that prenylation inhibition may be a novel therapeutic approach in NRAS mutant melanoma. Nevertheless, we also demonstrated that therapeutic sensitivity might be influenced by the PTEN status of BRAF mutant melanoma cells. However, further investigations are needed to identify drugs that have appropriate pharmacological properties to efficiently target prenylation in melanoma cells. ",

Finally, we review the results of immunotherapy in BRAF-mutant melanoma and address the current status of efforts to either combine or determine the optimal sequence of these two distinct treatment approaches. Although the recent advances in melanoma therapy have been dramatic, greater understanding of melanoma biology coupled with the successful development of several new treatments and combination regimens will further improve patient outcomes in the future.",

Detection of BRAFV600E in blood could have prognostic and predictive value and could be useful for monitoring response to BRAF-targeted therapy. We developed a rapid, sensitive method for the detection and quantification of BRAFV600E in circulating free DNA (cfDNA) isolated from plasma and serum on the basis of a quantitative 5'-nuclease PCR (Taqman) in the presence of a peptide-nucleic acid. We validated the assay in 92 lung, colon, and melanoma archival serum and plasma samples with paired tumor tissue (40 wild-type and 52 BRAFV600E). The correlation of cfDNA BRAFV600E with clinical parameters was further explored in 22 metastatic melanoma patients treated with BRAF inhibitors. Our assay could detect and quantify BRAFV600E in mixed samples with as little as 0.005% mutant DNA (copy number ratio 1 : 20 000), with a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 57.7% in archival serum and plasma samples. In 22 melanoma patients treated with BRAF inhibitors, the median progression-free survival was 3.6 months for those showing BRAFV600E in pretreatment cfDNA compared with 13.4 months for those in whom the mutation was not detected (P=0.021). Moreover, the median overall survival for positive versus negative BRAFV600E tests in pretreatment cfDNA differed significantly (7 vs. 21.8 months, P=0.017). This finding indicates that the sensitive detection and accurate quantification of low-abundance BRAFV600E alleles in cfDNA using our assay can be useful for predicting treatment outcome. ",

Rapid and frequent responses occurred with BRAF inhibitors, but clinical benefit was usually transient because of the rapid emergence of drug resistance. Concurrently, and by contrast, ipilimumab, a novel immune checkpoint inhibitor, was shown to provide long-term clinical benefit, but only in a minority of patients. This situation generated an ongoing debate about how to best use these drugs in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma. Recently, however, several new compounds and combinations of cell pathway signalling inhibitors and immunotherapies have been developed that look set to improve patient outcomes even further. In this Review, we discuss the existing evidence for the newest treatments for BRAF-mutant melanoma, including combined BRAF and MEK inhibition and PD-1-PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors, and assess future treatment strategies that could change metastatic melanoma from a rapidly fatal terminal illness to a chronic disease for most patients.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Somatic activating mutations of BRAF are the earliest and most common genetic abnormality detected in the genesis of human melanoma. However, the mechanism(s) by which activated BRAF promotes melanoma cell cycle progression and/or survival remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that expression of BIM, a pro-apoptotic member of the BCL-2 family, is inhibited by BRAF-->MEK-->ERK signaling in mouse and human melanocytes and in human melanoma cells. Trophic factor deprivation of melanocytes leads to elevated BIM expression. However, re-addition of trophic factors or activation of a conditional form of BRAF(V600E) leads to rapid inhibition of BIM expression. In both cases, inhibition of BIM expression was dependent on the activity of MEK1/2 and the proteasome. Consistent with these observations, pharmacological inhibition of BRAF(V600E) or MEK1/2 in human melanoma cells (using PLX4720 and CI-1040 respectively) led to a striking elevation of BIM expression. Re-activation of BRAF-->MEK-->ERK signaling led to phosphorylation of BIM-EL on serine 69 and its subsequent degradation. Interestingly, endogenous expression of BIM in melanoma cells was insufficient to induce apoptosis unless combined with serum deprivation. Under these circumstances, inhibition of BIM expression by RNA interference provided partial protection from apoptosis. These data suggest that regulation of BIM expression by BRAF-->MEK-->ERK signaling is one mechanism by which oncogenic BRAF(V600E) can influence the aberrant physiology of melanoma cells.",

Forty-two chemokine, cytokine, angiogenic, and growth factors were measured in the sera of 20 BRAF inhibitor-treated and four combination BRAF and MEK inhibitor-treated metastatic melanoma patients using a multiplex chemokine assay. The changes were correlated with Ki-67 and CD8(+) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in the tumor biopsies taken at the same time points, as well as clinical outcome, including response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Serum levels of IFN-γ, CCL4, and TNF-α were significantly increased, whereas CXCL8 significantly decreased from pretreatment (PRE) to early during treatment (EDT) serum samples. The decrease in serum CXCL8 levels from PRE to EDT significantly correlated with decreases in markers of melanoma proliferation (Ki-67) and increases in cytotoxic tumor-infiltrating T cells in corresponding tumor biopsies. In addition, a greater fold reduction in CXCL8 serum levels from PRE to EDT serum samples was associated with decreased overall survival. These results suggest that BRAF inhibition causes decreased CXCL8 secretion from melanoma cells and induce an immune response against the tumor associated with increased IFN-γ, CCL4, and TNF-α. Further studies are needed to determine if CXCL8 is predictive of response and to confirm the functions of these chemokine and cytokine in BRAF-mutant melanoma under BRAF inhibition. ",

Here, we demonstrate that BRAFi-resistant (BR) melanomas are susceptible to arginine deprivation due to inability to initiate re-expression of argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS1, a key enzyme for arginine synthesis) as well as ineffective autophagy. Autophagy and ASS1 re-expression are known to protect melanoma cells from cell death upon arginine deprivation. When melanoma cells become BR cells by long-term in vitro incubation with BRAFi, c-Myc-mediated ASS1 re-expression and the levels of autophagy-associated proteins (AMPK-α1 and Atg5) are attenuated. Furthermore, our study uncovers that downregulation of deubiquitinase USP28 which results in more active c-Myc degradation via ubiquitin-proteasome machinery is the primary mechanism for inability to re-express ASS1 upon arginine deprivation in BR cells. Overexpression of USP28 in BR cells enhances c-Myc expression and hence increases ASS1 transcription upon arginine deprivation, and consequently leads to cell survival. On the other hand, overexpression of Atg5 or AMPK-α1 in BR cells can redirect arginine deprivation-induced apoptosis toward autophagy. The xenograft models also confirm that BR tumors possess lower expression of ASS1 and are hypersensitive to arginine deprivation. These biochemical changes in BRAFi resistance which make them vulnerable to arginine deprivation can be exploited for the future treatment of BR melanoma patients. ",

In the tumor microenvironment, BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 functioned by on-target mechanisms to selectively decrease both the proportions and absolute numbers of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Treg) and CD11b(+)Gr1(+) myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), while preserving numbers of CD8(+) effector T cells. In PLX4720-treated mice, the intratumoral Treg populations decreased significantly, demonstrating enhanced apopotosis. CD11b(+) myeloid cells from PLX4720-treated tumors also exhibited decreased immunosuppressive function on a per-cell basis. In accordance with a reversion of tumor immune suppression, tumors that had been treated with PLX4720 grew with reduced kinetics after treatment was discontinued, and this growth delay was dependent on CD8 T cells.

We sought to determine the association of increased copy numbers of GAB2 among melanoma subtypes in the context of genetic alterations in BRAF, NRAS, and KIT.;A total of 85 melanomas arising from sun-protected (n = 23) and sun-exposed sites (n = 62) were analyzed for copy number changes using array-based comparative genomic hybridization and for gain-of-function mutations in BRAF, NRAS, and KIT.;GAB2 amplifications were found in 9% of the cases and were associated with melanomas arising from acral and mucosal sites (P = 0.005). Increased copy numbers of the KIT locus were observed in 6% of the cases. The overall mutation frequencies for BRAF and NRAS were 43.5% and 14%, respectively, and were mutually exclusive. Among the acral and mucosal melanomas studied, the genetic alteration frequency was 26% for GAB2, 13% for KIT, 30% for BRAF, and 4% for NRAS.

Almost 50% of melanomas harbour mutations in BRAF, mainly at codon 600, which result in constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway. The selective inhibitors of mutant BRAF Val600, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, showed major tumour responses, resulting in improved progression-free and overall survival in patients with metastatic disease, compared with chemotherapy. Antitumour activity was also recorded in brain metastases. The growth of cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas is a unique side-effect of BRAF inhibitor therapy that is induced by the paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway in cells with RAS mutations. Trametinib, which targets MEK downstream of BRAF, also produced an overall survival benefit compared with chemotherapy, although tumour responses were less frequent than they were with BRAF inhibitors. Despite this robust antitumour activity, most responses to these drugs are partial and disease progression is typically seen at a median of 5-7 months. Multiple resistance mechanisms have been identified, including those that lead to reactivation of the MAPK pathway and other pathways, such as the PI3K-AKT-mTOR and VEGF pathways. Some patients with BRAF Val600 mutant melanoma seem to also benefit from immunotherapies such as high-dose interleukin 2 and ipilimumab, which, by contrast with BRAF inhibitors, can produce durable complete responses.

This study investigated the intrapatient homogeneity of BRAF mutation status using pyrosequencing in primary tumors and different metastatic sites of melanoma patients. Paired samples of lymphatic, visceral, and subcutaneous metastases and primary melanoma from 45 metastatic melanoma patients were tested for BRAF mutations using a pyrosequencing assay and by Sanger sequencing. Overall, sequencing for BRAF mutation status was performed in 114 paired samples from 45 patients. Eighteen patients (40%) carried a BRAF mutation, including BRAF V600E (12/18), BRAF V600K (5/18), and BRAF V600R (1/18) mutations. Multiple BRAF mutations (V600E and V600K) were found in one patient. Among the patients with BRAF mutations, a good agreement in BRAF mutation status was found between the first and second tumor samples genotyped (91%; Cohen's κ coefficient: 0.81). Discordance in BRAF mutation status was found only in four patients, involving all three patients in whom sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases were sampled. These SLNs exhibited a wild-type genotype and were discordant with the other BRAF-mutated samples found in the same patient. The intrapatient BRAF status was predominantly homogeneous. However, SLN genotyping using pyrosequencing might be inaccurate in determining the actual mutation status of melanoma. Further studies are required to confirm the lack of reliability of SLN. ",

Its mechanism of action involves selective inhibition of the mutated BRAF V600E kinase that leads to reduced signalling through the aberrant mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Its efficacy is restricted to melanomas carrying the BRAF V600E mutation, which is seen in approximately 50% of all melanomas. In a randomized phase III trial, it was superior to dacarbazine in first-line treatment of advanced melanoma, with an overall response rate (ORR) of 48% (95% CI 42, 45), an estimated 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) of 5.3 versus 1.6 months (hazard ratio [HR] 0.26; 95% CI 0.20, 0.33; p < 0.001) and a statistically superior 12-month overall survival (OS) rate of 55% versus 43% (HR 0.62 [95% CI 0.49, 0.77]). Vemurafenib is generally well tolerated, but its use can be associated with development of cutaneous neoplasms such as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and keratoacanthoma (KA). These lesions can be excised safely without the need for withholding the drug or reducing its dose. Mechanisms of resistance to vemurafenib do not involve development of secondary mutations in the BRAF kinase domain, but may be related to BRAF V600E over-amplification, bypassing mechanisms via upregulation and overexpression of other components in the MAPK signalling cascade or activation of alternative pathways with potential to enhance cell growth, proliferation and survival. Clinical trials to test the efficacy of vemurafenib in combination with immunomodulatory agents, such as ipilimumab, and MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitors, such as GDC-0973, in the treatment of advanced melanoma are currently underway. Also under investigation is the use of vemurafenib in other solid tumours with BRAF mutations, such as papillary thyroid cancer.",

Mutational screening of the tumor revealed a number of driver mutations in oncogenes which enabled melanoma classification into a few molecular subtypes. BRAF is a key component of mitogen-activated kinase pathway; its activating mutation leads to accelerated melanoma cells proliferation, invasion and survival. Somatic mutations in BRAF were reported in various malignancies, including thyroid cancer, colorectal cancer and melanoma. Specific features of BRAF-positive tumors could have clinical implications as mutational alterations may have an impact on the biological behavior of the tumor and prognosis of the disease. In the present study, the frequency of BRAF V600E mutation was evaluated in Russian patients with melanocytic lesions, of which 41.25% were primary melanoma and 60% were melanocytic nevi. Melanoma patients with trunk localization were of younger age in the BRAF-positive group as compared with BRAF-negative patients. Immunohistochemical evaluations of Ki-67 expression, as well as matrix metalloproteinase-2, -9, were found to be equal in BRAF-positive and BRAF-negative tumors. MMP-2/MMP-9 immunoreactivity was observed in stromal and/or melanocytic cells both in melanoma and nevi patients. Besides tumor cells, MMP-9 expression was observed in lymphocytes in 27.2% of BRAF-positive and in 19.1% of BRAF-negative patients. Histopathological prognostic markers (Breslow thickness, mitotic index, ulceration, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes pattern) did not show any differences depending on BRAF V600E mutational status.

Studies have shown low-activity mutants of BRAF (G469E/D594G) instead signal through CRAF. Unlike BRAF, CRAF directly regulates apoptosis through mitochondrial localization where it binds to Bcl-2 and phosphorylates BAD. The CRAF inhibitor sorafenib was found to induce a time-dependent reduction in both BAD phosphorylation and Bcl-2 expression in the D594G/G469E lines only. Knockdown of CRAF using a lentiviral shRNA suppressed both Bcl-2 expression and induced apoptosis in the D594G melanoma line but not in a V600E-mutated line. Finally, we showed in a series of xenograft studies that sorafenib was more potent at reducing the growth of tumors with the D594G mutation than those with the V600E mutation.

The loss of both products of the CDKN2A gene, proteins p16(ARF) and p14(INK4a), or amplification of microphthalmia-associated transcriptional factor (MITF) are also predisposing factors in the development of melanoma. BRAF mutations are observed mainly in melanomas on skin liable to intermittent UV exposure. Acral and mucosal melanomas, and also melanomas on skin damaged by chronic exposure to the sun are characterized by distinct patterns of chromosomal aberrations with frequent amplifications and alterations of the KIT gene, while BRAF mutations are rarely found in these sites. Uveal melanomas show recurrent chromosomal losses (1p, 3, 6q) and gains (6p, 8q), but mutations of BRAF are hardly ever found.

The list of 34 top probes contained no more than 1% of false discoveries with a probability of 0.95. Among the genes that differentiated most strongly between BRAF mutated and non-mutated melanomas, there were those involved in melanoma immune response such as MAGE-D2, CD63, and HSP70. These findings support the immunogenicity of BRAF(V600E), eliciting patients T-cell responses in various in vitro assays. The genes whose expression is associated with BRAF mutations are not simply restricted to the MAPK/ERK signaling but also converge to enhanced immune responsiveness, cell motility and melanosomes processing involved in the adaptative UV response.",

Growth factor receptor up-regulation is among the mechanisms underlying BRAF-I resistance of melanoma cells. Here we demonstrate for the first time that PDGFRα up-regulation causes BRAF-I resistance. PDGFRα inhibition by PDGFRα-specific short hairpin (sh)RNA and by PDGFRα inhibitors restores and increases melanoma cells' sensitivity to BRAF-I in vitro and in vivo. This effect reflects the inhibition of ERK and AKT activation which is associated with BRAF-I resistance of melanoma cells. PDGFRα up-regulation is mediated by Sonic Hedgehog Homolog (Shh) pathway activation which is induced by BRAF-I treatment. Similarly to PDGFRα inhibition, Shh inhibition by LDE225 restores and increases melanoma cells' sensitivity to BRAF-I. These effects are mediated by PDGFRα down-regulation and by ERK and AKT inhibition. The clinical relevance of these data is indicated by the association of PDGFRα up-regulation in melanoma matched biopsies of BRAF-I +/- MEK inhibitor treated patients with shorter time to disease progression and less tumor regression. These findings suggest that monitoring patients for early PDGFRα up-regulation will facilitate the identification of those who may benefit from the treatment with BRAF-I in combination with clinically approved PDGFRα or Shh inhibitors.

Sustained PI3'-lipid production commonly occurs via silencing of the PI3'-lipid phosphatase PTEN or, less commonly, through mutational activation of PIK3CA, encoding the 110-kDa catalytic subunit of PI3'-kinase-α (PI3Kα). To define the PI3K catalytic isoform dependency of BRAF-mutated melanoma, we used pharmacologic, isoform-selective PI3K inhibitors in conjunction with melanoma-derived cell lines and genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models. Although BRAF(V600E)/PIK3CA(H1047R) melanomas were sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of selective PI3Kα blockade, inhibition of BRAF(V600E)/PTEN(Null) melanoma proliferation required combined blockade of PI3Kα, PI3Kδ, and PI3Kγ, and was insensitive to PI3Kβ blockade. In GEM models, isoform-selective PI3K inhibition elicited cytostatic effects, but significantly potentiated melanoma regression in response to BRAF(V600E) pathway-targeted inhibition. Interestingly, PI3K inhibition forestalled the onset of MEK inhibitor resistance in two independent GEM models of BRAF(V600E)-driven melanoma. These results suggest that combination therapy with PI3K inhibitors may be a useful strategy to extend the duration of clinical response of patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma to BRAF(V600E) pathway-targeted therapies.;Although BRAF(V600E) pathway-targeted therapies elicit melanoma regression, the onset of drug resistance limits the durability of response. Here, we show that combined treatment with PI3K inhibitors significantly forestalled the onset of MEK1/2 inhibitor-resistant disease in BRAF-mutated GEM melanoma models.

Given that p53 is capable of antagonising PI3K/AKT activation we hypothesised that pharmacological restoration of p53 activity may increase the sensitivity of BRAF-mutant melanoma to MAPK-targeted therapy and eventually delay and/or prevent acquisition of drug resistance. To test this possibility we exposed a panel of vemurafenib-sensitive and resistant (innate and acquired) (V600E/K)BRAF melanomas to a (V600E/K)BRAF inhibitor (vemurafenib) alone or in combination with a direct p53 activator (PRIMA-1(Met)/APR-246). Strikingly, PRIMA-1(Met) synergised with vemurafenib to induce apoptosis and suppress proliferation of (V600E/K)BRAF melanoma cells in vitro and to inhibit tumour growth in vivo. Importantly, this drug combination decreased the viability of both vemurafenib-sensitive and resistant melanoma cells irrespectively of the TP53 status. Notably, p53 reactivation was invariably accompanied by PI3K/AKT pathway inhibition, the activity of which was found as a dominant resistance mechanism to BRAF inhibition in our lines. From all various combinatorial modalities tested, targeting the MAPK and PI3K signalling pathways through p53 reactivation or not, the PRIMA-1(Met)/vemurafenib combination was the most cytotoxic. We conclude that PRIMA-1(Met) through its ability to directly reactivate p53 regardless of the mechanism causing its deactivation, and thereby dampen PI3K signalling, sensitises (V600E/K)BRAF-positive melanoma to BRAF inhibitors.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Melanoma is a complex genetic disease, and multiple genetic alterations have been reported to play a role during disease progression. The dysregulation of BRAF signaling has been shown to affect many molecules that promote the continual progression of melanoma. Oncogenic BRAF expression plays a vital role in promoting cell invasion and metastasis in melanoma. It is also associated with poor prognosis in metastatic melanoma. About 40% to 60% of cutaneous melanomas have BRAF mutations, and 90% of the mutations involve a specific substitution at codon 600 (BRAF V600E). In this study, we compared BRAF (V600E) mutation detection by molecular analysis with BRAF expression by immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis using 2 different antibodies. A total of 25 metastatic malignant melanomas were included in this study. 10 of the 25 (40%) cases were positive by molecular analysis using the COBAS 4800 BRAF V600 Real-time PCR assay, and 18 of the 25 (72%) cases were positive by IHC analysis with 2 different antibodies. All positive cases by molecular analysis were positive by both IHC stains (100%). No false negatives were obtained with either IHC stain. Eight of the 25 (32%) were false-positive by both IHC stains. This study demonstrates that IHC analysis is a very sensitive test for evaluation of BRAF mutations in metastatic malignant melanoma and may be useful as an initial screening test. ",

More recently, the combination of BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib with MEK inhibitor trametinib has shown improved progression-free survival, compared to dabrafenib monotherapy, in a Phase II study and has received approval by the US Food and Drug Administration. However, even when treated with the combination, most patients develop mechanisms of acquired resistance, and some of them do not achieve tumor regression at all, because of intrinsic resistance to therapy. Along with the development of BRAF inhibitors, immunotherapy made an important step forward: ipilimumab, an anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody, was approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma; anti-PD-1 agents achieved promising results in Phase I/II trials, and data from Phase III studies will be ready soon. The availability of such drugs, which are effective regardless of BRAF status, has made the therapeutic approach more complex, as first-line treatment with BRAF inhibitors may not be the best choice for all BRAF-mutated patients. The aim of this paper is to review the systemic therapeutic options available today for patients affected by BRAF V600-mutated metastatic melanoma, as well as to summarize the mechanisms of resistance to BRAF inhibitors and discuss the possible strategies to overcome them. Moreover, since the molecular analysis of tumor specimens is now a pivotal and decisional factor in the treatment strategy of metastatic melanoma patients, the advances in the molecular detection techniques for the BRAF V600 mutation will be reported.

Selective ERK inhibitors have been proposed as alternative salvage therapies. We show that ERK inhibition is more potent than MEK inhibition at suppressing MAPK activity and inhibiting the proliferation of multiple BRAF inhibitor resistant melanoma cell models. Nevertheless, melanoma cells often failed to undergo apoptosis in response to ERK inhibition, because the relief of ERK-dependent negative feedback activated RAS and PI3K signalling. Consequently, the combination of ERK and PI3K/mTOR inhibition was effective at promoting cell death in all resistant melanoma cell models, and was substantially more potent than the MEK/PI3K/mTOR inhibitor combination. Our data indicate that a broader targeting strategy concurrently inhibiting ERK, rather than MEK, and PI3K/mTOR may circumvent BRAF inhibitor resistance, and should be considered during the clinical development of ERK inhibitors.

Median progression-free survival was also significantly improved with vemurafenib as compared with dacarbazine (5.3 versus 1.6 months, respectively), and this was consistent among groups analyzed, including age, sex, geography, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status, disease stage, and serum lactate dehydrogenase. The success of targeting melanoma genomics has created a paradigm shift for future drug development. Currently, the elucidation of resistant mechanisms to vemurafenib therapy remains an important area of active investigation that will shape rational drug treatments for melanoma. The development of vemurafenib, the role of BRAF targeting, and the changing landscape of treatment for melanoma provide a new foundation for clinical investigation.",

Activation of the PI3K pathway can mediate resistance to these agents, providing a strong rationale for combination therapy in melanoma. Here, a panel of nine low-passage human metastatic melanoma cell lines with BRAF mutations was tested in cell proliferation and protein expression assays for sensitivity to inhibitors of MEK (selumetinib) and BRAF (vemurafenib) as single agents and in combination with inhibitors of pan-PI3K (ZSTK474), pan-PI3K/mTOR (BEZ235), individual PI3K isoforms (p110α, A66; p110β, TGX-221; p110γ, AS-252424; p110δ, idelalisib), or mTORC1/2 (KU-0063794). Selumetinib and vemurafenib potently inhibited cell proliferation in all cell lines, especially in those that expressed low levels of phosphorylated AKT (pAKT). ZSTK474 and BEZ235 also inhibited cell proliferation in all cell lines and enhanced the antitumor activity of selumetinib and vemurafenib in the majority of lines by either interacting synergistically or additively to increase potency or by inducing cytotoxicity by significantly increasing the magnitude of cell growth inhibition. Furthermore, ZSTK474 or BEZ235 combined with selumetinib to produce robust inhibition of pERK, pAKT, and pS6 expression and synergistic inhibition of NZM20 tumor growth. The inhibitors of individual PI3K isoforms or mTORC1/2 were less effective at inhibiting cell proliferation either as single agents or in combination with selumetinib or vemurafenib, although KU-0063794 synergistically interacted with vemurafenib and increased the magnitude of cell growth inhibition with selumetinib or vemurafenib in certain cell lines. Overall, these results suggest that the sensitivity of BRAF-mutant melanoma cells to BRAF or MEK inhibitors is at least partly mediated by activation of the PI3K pathway and can be enhanced by combined inhibition of the BRAF/MEK and PI3K/mTOR signaling pathways.

Trastuzumab (Herceptin), the antibody to the HER2 oncoprotein, has had a significant impact on therapy for patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. This study examined the incidences of HER2 protein overexpression and HER2 gene amplification in metastatic malignant melanoma, which remain unclear in the literature.;The study evaluated patients with stage III and stage IV malignant melanoma who were treated between 1983 and 1999. Tissue blocks were retrieved and reviewed to confirm the diagnosis. From the 101 cases identified, 49 (31 stage III and 18 stage IV) had sufficient residual tumor sample to enable an assay to be performed. The blocks were tested for HER2 overexpression using the DAKO HercepTest immunohistochemical (IHC) assay. Any sample that tested 1+ or greater for HER2 expression on IHC and a randomly selected subset of HER2-negative samples were tested for the presence of HER2 gene amplification using the Vysis PathVysion fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay.;The median age of the 49 selected patients was 52.2 years, and the male-to-female ratio was 1.23:1 (27 men to 22 women). All of the 49 cases of malignant melanoma were negative for HER2 overexpression by IHC. However, two samples (3%) were found to have a weak level of HER2 expression (1+ level of staining). Subsequent FISH results on the samples that were 1+ on IHC were negative for HER2 gene amplification. FISH results on 21 other randomly selected IHC-negative samples were also negative for HER2 amplification. Flow cytometry failed to show HER2 overexpression in two melanoma cell lines, and treatment of these cells with trastuzumab did not affect their proliferation rate.;We found a low incidence of HER2 expression and no evidence of HER2 protein overexpression or HER2 gene amplification in metastatic malignant melanoma tissues. Therefore, routine testing for HER2 overexpression or HER2 amplification would not be of benefit in this patient population. These results also imply that anti-HER2 therapy with trastuzumab is highly unlikely to provide benefit for patients with metastatic melanoma.",

However, justification for such a distinction is controversial because of histological overlap and lack of prognostic significance. We analyzed chromosomal aberrations of 15 AMs and 15 SSMs that were comparable for tumor thickness and patient age, using comparative genomic hybridization. All AMs had at least one (mean, 2.0) gene amplification, significantly more than the SSMs, in which only 2 of 15 (13%) had one amplification each (P < 0.0001). At least 15 different genomic regions were amplified in AM. These involved small portions of chromosomal arms, sometimes including known oncogenes implicated in melanoma. The most frequently amplified regions in AMs occurred at 11q13 (47%), 22q11-13 (40%), and 5p15 (20%). Comparison of the amplification levels of invasive and noninvasive portions of the tumors using fluorescence in situ hybridization suggested that amplifications occurred before the formation of the invasive portion. The finding of amplifications of 11q13 in three of five additional cases of AM in situ further supports the notion that amplifications arise early in the progression of AM. Very significantly, we found isolated melanocytes with amplifications in the epidermis up to 3 mm beyond the histologically recognizable extent of the melanomas in 5 of 15 invasive AMs. In conclusion, our data show that AM is a distinct type of melanoma characterized by focused gene amplifications occurring early in tumorigenesis, and that malignant cells are present beyond the histologically detectable boundary, thereby revealing one mechanism of local recurrence.",

IkappaB degradation is dependent upon its phosphorylation by the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex and subsequent ubiquitination facilitated by beta-Trcp E3 ubiquitin ligase. Here, we report that melanocytes expressing a conditionally oncogenic form of BRAF(V600E) exhibit enhanced beta-Trcp expression, increased IKK activity and a concomitant increase in the rate of IkappaBalpha degradation. Conversely, inhibition of BRAF signaling using either a broad-spectrum Raf inhibitor (BAY 43-9006) or by selective knock-down of BRAF(V600E) expression by RNA interference in human melanoma cells leads to decreased IKK activity and beta-Trcp expression, stabilization of IkappaB, inhibition of NF-kappaB transcriptional activity and sensitization of these cells to apoptosis.

Demonstration of patients' T cell responses to BRAF(V600E) would suggest the feasibility of active specific immunotherapy targeting the mutation in these patients. In the present study, BRAF(V600E) peptides with putative binding sites for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2 were used to stimulate T lymphocytes of HLA-A2-positive melanoma patients. Four of five patients with BRAF(V600E)-positive lesions showed lymphoproliferative responses to BRAF(V600E) peptide stimulation. These responses were specific for the mutated epitope and HLA-A2 was restricted in three patients. Lymphocytes from these three patients were cytotoxic against HLA-A2-matched BRAF(V600E)-positive melanoma cells. None of the four patients with BRAF(V600E)-negative lesions and none of five healthy donors had lymphoproliferative responses specific for the mutated epitope.

Patients with mutant BRAF melanoma that progress on RAF inhibitors have limited treatment options, and drug removal from resistant tumors may elicit multiple effects. A frequent mechanism of resistance to RAF inhibitors is caused by expression of mutant BRAF splice variants. RAF inhibitor-resistant cell lines, generated in vivo, were tested as to whether or not mutant BRAF splice variants confer a fitness advantage in the presence of RAF inhibitor. Critically, cells expressing distinct mutant BRAF splice variants grow more efficiently in vitro and in vivo in the presence of the vemurafenib analog, PLX4720, compared with in the absence of inhibitor. PLX4720-treated BRAF splice variant-expressing cells exhibited levels of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 comparable to untreated parental cells. In addition, a reduction in phospho-ERK1/2 levels following treatment with the MEK inhibitor, trametinib (GSK1120212) phenocopied the fitness benefit provided by PLX4720.

In this study, we show how its genetic amplification in PTEN-deficient melanomas may rationalize the use of CDK2 inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy. Analysis of array-CGH data revealed that PTEN deficiency is coupled tightly with genomic amplification encompassing the NUAK2 locus, a finding strengthened by immunohistochemical evidence that phospho-Akt overexpression was correlated with NUAK2 expression in clinical specimens of acral melanoma. Functional studies in melanoma cells showed that inactivation of the PI3K pathway upregulated p21 expression and reduced the number of cells in S phase. NUAK2 silencing and inactivation of the PI3K pathway efficiently controlled CDK2 expression, whereas CDK2 inactivation specifically abrogated the growth of NUAK2-amplified and PTEN-deficient melanoma cells. Immunohistochemical analyses confirmed an association of CDK2 expression with NUAK2 amplification and p-Akt expression in melanomas. Finally, pharmacologic inhibition of CDK2 was sufficient to suppress the growth of NUAK2-amplified and PTEN-deficient melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our results show how CDK2 blockade may offer a promising therapy for genetically defined melanomas, where NUAK2 is amplified and PTEN is deleted.",

Among the analysed melanomas, 12/245 (4.9%) samples presented the coexistence of PIK3CA and BRAF/NRAS mutations.;Our study further suggests that PIK3CA mutations account for a small fraction of PI3K pathway activation and have a limited impact in interfering with the BRAF/NRAS-driven growth in melanoma.",

The objectives of this study were to evaluate genetic and expression alterations of CCND1 with a focus on primary cutaneous melanomas, to define BRAF and NRAS mutation status, and correlate the data with clinical-pathological parameters. CCND1 amplification was associated with ulceration and the localization of the metastasis. After correction for the mutation state of BRAF and NRAS genes, CCND1 amplification in samples without such mutations was associated with ulceration and sun exposure. The cyclin D1 (CCND1) mRNA level decreased in lesions with multiple metastases and was correlated with both the mRNA levels and mutation state of BRAF and NRAS genes. Primary melanomas with BRAF(V600) or NRAS(Q61 ) mutations exhibited lower CCND1 mRNA level. CCND1 protein expression was associated with Breslow thickness, metastasis formation, and shorter survival time. These observations suggest that CCND1 alterations are linked to melanoma progression and are modified by BRAF and NRAS mutations. Our data show that CCND1 amplification could have a prognostic relevance in cutaneous melanoma and highlight that altered CCND1 gene expression may influence the metastatic progression, survival, and the localization of metastases.",

As such, this pathway is often deregulated in cancer, including melanomas, which frequently harbour activating mutations in the NRAS and BRAF oncogenes. Hyperactive MAPK signalling is known to promote protein synthesis, but the mechanisms by which this occurs remain poorly understood. Here, we show that expression of oncogenic forms of Ras and Raf promotes the constitutive activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Using pharmacological inhibitors and RNA interference, we find that the MAPK-activated protein kinase RSK (p90 ribosomal S6 kinase) is partly required for these effects. Using melanoma cell lines carrying activating BRAF mutations, we show that ERK/RSK signalling regulates assembly of the translation initiation complex and polysome formation, as well as the translation of growth-related messenger RNAs containing a 5'-terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motif. Accordingly, we find that RSK inhibition abrogates tumour growth in mice. Our findings indicate that RSK may be a valuable therapeutic target for the treatment of tumours characterized by deregulated MAPK signalling, such as melanoma.",

The current review indicated that BRAF represents an important target in cancer, in part because it is present in 7% of all cancers and also because it represents the first intracellular signaling molecule that is activated by point mutations for which single-agent therapy appears to have efficacy. Therapy for advanced melanoma has progressed slowly over the past 3 decades, although significant advances have been made in other cancers with the application of cytotoxic chemotherapy and targeted therapies. However, in melanoma, cytotoxic chemotherapies have severe limits, chemotherapy does not convincingly improve on the natural history of metastatic disease and has no role in the adjuvant setting, and cytokine therapy may have a niche in both the adjuvant and metastatic settings but confers only a modest benefit to a small proportion of patients at the cost of severe toxicity. Thus, there are few other cancers in which completely novel therapies are so highly prioritized in clinical research. Understanding network of signal-transduction pathways and how that network may adapt to BRAF inhibition or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibition will point to the next generation of clinical trials investigating rational combination regimens. The current investigations in melanoma will create a set of hypotheses to be tested in each cancer that harbors BRAF mutations.",

As early as 2002, the majority of metastatic melanomas were described to harbor the BRAF(V600) mutation, setting the stage for an explosion of interest for targeting this protein as a novel therapeutic strategy. The highly selective BRAF(V600) inhibitor, vemurafenib, was identified initially through a large-scale drug screen.;Here we examine vemurafenib's journey from discovery to clinical use in metastatic melanoma. Topics covered include preclinical data, single agent Phase 1,2 and 3 clinical trials, resistance issues and mechanisms, adverse effects including the development of squamous cell cancers, and combination trials.;Due to its tolerance, low toxicity profile, rapid tumor response, and improved outcomes in melanoma patients with BRAF(V600) mutations, vemurafenib was advanced rapidly through clinical trials to receive FDA approval in 2011. While its efficacy is well documented, durability has become an issue for most patients who experience therapeutic resistance in approximately 6-8 months. In addition, a concerning toxicity observed in patients taking the drug include development of localized cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). It is hypothesized that drug resistance and SCC development result from a similar paradoxical activation of protein signaling pathways, specifically MAPK.

This leads to increased oncogenic properties such as tumor cell invasion, metastatic potential, and resistance to apoptosis. Blockade of the MAPK pathway with highly specific kinase inhibitors induces unprecedented tumor response rates in patients with advanced BRAF(V600) mutant melanoma. Immune checkpoint blockade with monoclonal antibodies targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 and programed death-1/PD-L1 has also demonstrated striking anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced melanoma. Tumor responses are likely limited by multiple additional layers of immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment. There is emerging preclinical and clinical evidence suggesting that MAPK inhibition has a beneficial effect on the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, providing a strong rationale for combined immunotherapy and MAPK pathway inhibition in melanoma. The T cell response has been the main focus in the studies reported to date. Since dendritic cells (DCs) are important in the induction of tumor-specific T cell responses, the impact of MAPK pathway activation in melanoma on DC function is critical for the melanoma directed immune response. BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells modulate DCs through the MAPK pathway because its blockade in melanoma cells can reverse suppression of DC function. As both MEK/BRAF inhibition and immune checkpoint blockade have recently taken center stage in the treatment of melanoma, a deeper understanding of how MAPK pathway inhibition affects the tumor immune response is needed.

Patients with BRAF mutation-negative primary tumors may manifest BRAF mutation-positive metastatic disease. It is unclear whether all metastatic lesions carry the same BRAF mutation status found in the primary tumor and if discordancy exists, in what frequency it occurs. Primary and matched metastatic lesions in 25 melanoma patients were tested for the BRAF V600E/Ec, V600K, V600D, and V600R mutations using a BRAF RGQ PCR kit (Qiagen). Four patients (16%) had discrepancies between their primary and metastatic melanoma BRAF status. Of these patients, 2 (8%) had BRAF mutation-positive primary melanomas with BRAF mutation-negative metastatic lesions and 2 (8%) patient had BRAF mutation-negative melanoma with a BRAF mutation-positive metastatic lesion. In summary, discordancy of BRAF mutation status is not an infrequent finding between primary and metastatic melanoma. It may be prudent in previously negative patients to determine BRAF mutation status of new metastatic tumors for proper allocation of BRAF inhibitor therapy. Discordant BRAF status may have a role in the varying patterns of response and inevitable resistance seen with BRAF inhibitor therapies. ",

Prior studies suggested that MIA expression was relatively tissue-specific, making it a potentially useful marker for melanoma. The current investigations sought to more clearly define the range of tumor/tissue-types where MIA is expressed, compared with expression of 4 other potential melanoma marker genes (tyrosinase melanoma antigen recognized by T cells [MART-1/MelanA], gp100, and melanoma growth-stimulatory activity [MGSA/Gro alpha]). Expression of these genes was assayed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry in 23 melanoma tumor specimens and in 25 additional nonmelanoma or nonmalignant specimens. MIA, tyrosinase, and MGSA were expressed in most melanoma specimens. Specificity was highest for MART-1, followed by MIA and tyrosinase. Increasing the number of cycles of amplification from 35 to 40 increased sensitivity but decreased specificity of most markers, though MIA was relatively robust. MIA mRNA was also detected in carcinomas of the colon, ovary, kidney, and head/neck, as well as in normal laryngeal epithelium. Although MIA discriminated melanoma from nonmelanoma at least as well as tyrosinase, no single mRNA marker had accuracy greater than 71%, raising potential concern about application of these particular mRNA markers to the minimal disease setting.

Molecular analysis of BRAF, using a pyrosequencing approach, revealed the presence of BRAF V600E mutation. The patient developed multiple visceral metastases, but refused treatment and was lost to follow-up. In the second case, no BRAF V600E mutation was found, but the patient exhibited a pigmented patch in the lower gingival mucosa, which was excised by surgical treatment.

In large cohorts of nevi and melanoma samples, PDK1 expression was significantly higher in primary melanoma, compared with nevi, and was further increased in metastatic melanoma. PDK1 expression suffices for its activity, owing to auto-activation, or elevated phosphorylation by phosphoinositide 3'-OH-kinase (PI3K). Selective inactivation of Pdk1 in the melanocytes of Braf(V600E)::Pten(-/-) or Braf(V600E)::Cdkn2a(-/-)::Pten(-/-) mice delayed the development of pigmented lesions and melanoma induced by systemic or local administration of 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Melanoma invasion and metastasis were significantly reduced or completely prevented by Pdk1 deletion. Administration of the PDK1 inhibitor GSK2334470 (PDKi) effectively delayed melanomagenesis and metastasis in Braf(V600E)::Pten(-/-) mice. Pdk1(-/-) melanomas exhibit a marked decrease in the activity of AKT, P70S6K and PKC. Notably, PDKi was as effective in inhibiting AGC kinases and colony forming efficiency of melanoma with Pten wild-type (WT) genotypes. Gene expression analyses identified Pdk1-dependent changes in FOXO3a-regulated genes, and inhibition of FOXO3a restored proliferation and colony formation of Pdk1(-/-) melanoma cells. Our studies provide direct genetic evidence for the importance of PDK1, in part through FOXO3a-dependent pathway, in melanoma development and progression. ",

In WT/WT melanoma cells displaying high levels of phospho-ErbB3, knockdown of NRG1 reduced cell viability and was associated with decreased phosphorylation of ErbB3, its coreceptor ErbB2, and its downstream target, AKT. Similar effects were observed by targeting ErbB3 with either siRNAs or the neutralizing ErbB3 monoclonal antibodies huHER3-8 and NG33. In addition, pertuzumab-mediated inhibition of ErbB2 heterodimerization decreased AKT phosphorylation, cell growth in vitro, and xenograft growth in vivo. Pertuzumab also potentiated the effects of MEK inhibitor on WT/WT melanoma growth in vitro and in vivo. These findings demonstrate that targeting ErbB3-ErbB2 signaling in a cohort of WT/WT melanomas leads to tumor growth reduction.

These include mutations that activate Ras and two of its effector cascades, Raf and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Induction of Ras and Raf can be caused by active N-Ras and B-Raf mutants as well as by gene amplification. Activation of PI3K pathway components occurs by PTEN loss and by AKT3 amplification. Melanomas also commonly show impairment of the p16(INK4A)-CDK4-Rb and ARF-HDM2-p53 tumor suppressor pathways. CDKN2A mutations can produce p16(INK4A) and ARF protein loss. Rb bypass can also occur through activating CDK4 mutations as well as by CDK4 amplification. In addition to ARF deletion, p53 pathway disruption can result from dominant negative TP53 mutations. TERT amplification also occurs in melanoma. The extent to which these mutations can induce human melanocytic neoplasia is unknown.

What is lacking is a systematic characterization of the regulatory relationships between genes whose expression is related to metastatic potential. Such a characterization would produce a molecular taxonomy for melanoma which could feasibly be used to identify epigenetic mechanisms behind changes in metastatic behaviour. To achieve this we carried out three separate DNA microarray analyses on a total of 86 cultures of melanoma. Significantly, multiple testing correction revealed that previous reports describing correlations of gene expression with activating mutations in BRAF or NRAS were incorrect and that no gene expression patterns correlate with the mutation status of these MAPK pathway components. Instead, we identified three different sample cohorts (A, B and C) and found that these cohorts represent melanoma groups of differing metastatic potential. Cohorts A and B were susceptible to transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta)-mediated inhibition of proliferation and had low motility. Cohort C was resistant to TGFbeta and demonstrated high motility. Meta-analysis of the data against previous studies linking gene expression and phenotype confirmed that cohorts A and C represent transcription signatures of weakly and strongly metastatic melanomas, respectively. Gene expression co-regulation suggested that signalling via TGFbeta-type and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways underwent considerable change between cohorts. These results suggest a model for the transition from weakly to strongly metastatic melanomas in which TGFbeta-type signalling upregulates genes expressing vasculogenic/extracellular matrix remodelling factors and Wnt signal inhibitors, coinciding with a downregulation of genes downstream of Wnt signalling.",

On the basis of previous expression studies, we aimed to trace melanoma cells in the blood of melanoma patients by RT-PCR of melanoma-inhibitory activity (MIA) mRNA. To detect sensitively MIA transcripts in total RNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we established a sensitive PCR-ELISA system. With this assay, we detected one melanoma cell in 2 ml of blood by a single round of 32 PCR cycles. A total of 295 PBMC samples isolated from 166 patients with melanocytic tumors were tested with the MIA RT-PCR-ELISA: (a) 58 patients (99 samples) with malignant melanomas in stage I; (b) 49 patients (65 samples) with malignant melanomas in stage II; and (c) 47 patients (116 samples) with metastasized melanomas (stages III and IV), with an additional 12 patients (15 samples) with benign melanocytic nevi. Forty-four (26.8%) of 164 samples isolated from patients with melanomas in stages I and II were positive for MIA mRNA; in stages III/IV, 33 (28.4%) of 116 samples of patients, irrespective of clinically evident disease, were positive. Eleven (84.6%) of 13 PBMC samples from patients with metastasized melanoma and clinically evident disease without treatment were MIA mRNA-positive in contrast to only 19 (25.7%) of 74 samples isolated from patients in stage IV with metastasis during chemotherapy. Furthermore, none of the 16 PBMC samples of patients in stage IV without clinically detectable metastases at that time point during chemotherapy was MIA mRNA-positive. Interestingly, of the 44 positive samples (26.8%) isolated from patients with melanomas in stages I and II, 20 were still positive when retested after complete excision of the tumor. Our results reveal that amplification of MIA mRNA from the PBMCs of patients with malignant melanomas by PCR-ELISA provides a useful means to detect tumor cells in the systemic blood circulation. A correlation between positive blood samples and tumor burden in stages III and IV was detected, and, in addition, a significant effect of chemotherapy with respect to the reduction of the number of systemically spread tumor cells was observed. However, MIA amplification seems to be of little value as a surrogate marker for clinical staging or the detection of metastatic disease.",

Here, we show that melanoma cells that are driven by oncogenic BRAF are resistant to the growth-inhibitory effects of metformin because RSK sustains TORC1 activity even when AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is activated. We further show that AMPK targets the dual-specificity protein phosphatase DUSP6 for degradation and this increases ERK activity, which then upregulates the VEGF-A protein. Critically, this drives angiogenesis and accelerates the growth of BRAF-driven tumors in mice. Unexpectedly, however, when VEGF signaling is inhibited, instead of accelerating tumor growth, metformin inhibits tumor growth. Thus, we show that BRAF-driven melanoma cells are resistant to the antigrowth effects of AMPK and that AMPK mediates cell-autonomous and cell-nonautonomous effects that accelerate the growth of these cells in vivo.;Metformin inhibits the growth of most tumor cells, but BRAF-mutant melanoma cells are resistant to metformin in vitro, and metformin accelerates their growth in vivo.

We first analyzed a panel of 52 melanoma cell lines (n = 35, 11, 6 for BRAF*, NRAS*, and BRAF/NRAS(wt/wt), respectively) by array-based comparative genomic hybridization for unique alterations that associate with each mutation subgroup. Subsequently, those DNA copy number changes that correlated with a mutation subgroup were used to predict the mutation status of an independent panel of 43 tumors (n = 17, 13, 13 for BRAF*, NRAS*, and BRAF/NRAS(wt/wt), respectively). BRAF mutant tumors were classified with a high rate of success (74.4%, P = 0.002), whereas NRAS mutants were not significantly distinguished from wild types (26/43, P = 0.12).

Here we show that loss of stromal antigen 2 (STAG2) or STAG3, which encode subunits of the cohesin complex, in melanoma cells results in resistance to BRAFi. We identified loss-of-function mutations in STAG2, as well as decreased expression of STAG2 or STAG3 proteins in several tumor samples from patients with acquired resistance to BRAFi and in BRAFi-resistant melanoma cell lines. Knockdown of STAG2 or STAG3 expression decreased sensitivity of BRAF(Val600Glu)-mutant melanoma cells and xenograft tumors to BRAFi. Loss of STAG2 inhibited CCCTC-binding-factor-mediated expression of dual specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), leading to reactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling (via the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2; hereafter referred to as ERK).

As cell fusion has been implicated to facilitate the alteration of a cell's phenotype, we hypothesized that cells in the peritumoral stroma having a stromal phenotype that initiate recurrent tumors might originate from the fusion of tumor and stromal cells. Here, we show that in patients with BRAF(V600E) melanoma, melanoma antigen recognized by T-cells (MART1)-negative peritumoral stromal cells express BRAF(V600E) protein. To confirm the presence of the oncogene at the genetic level, peritumoral stromal cells were microdissected and screened for the presence of BRAF(V600E) with a mutation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Interestingly, cells carrying the BRAF(V600E) mutation were not only found among cells surrounding the primary tumor but were also present in the stroma of melanoma metastases as well as in a histologically tumor-free re-excision sample from a patient who subsequently developed a local recurrence. We did not detect any BRAF(V600E) mutation or protein in the peritumoral stroma of BRAF(WT) melanoma. Therefore, our results suggest that peritumoral stromal cells contain melanoma-derived oncogenic information, potentially as a result of cell fusion. These hybrid cells display the phenotype of stromal cells and are therefore undetectable using routine histological assessments.

Effects on MAPK and AKT signaling by western blotting and cell cycle by flow cytometry were determined.;Sensitivity fell into three groups: sensitive, 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) < 1 μM; intermediately sensitive, IC50 1-2 μM; and resistant, >2 μM. Fifteen of 21 (71%) BRAF mutants, including 4 with innate vemurafenib resistance, were sensitive to SCH772984. All three (100%) BRAF/NRAS double mutants, 11 of 14 (78%) NRAS mutants and 5 of 7 (71%) wild-type melanomas were sensitive. Among BRAF(V600) mutants with in vitro acquired resistance to vemurafenib, those with MAPK pathway reactivation as the mechanism of resistance were sensitive to SCH772984. SCH772984 caused G1 arrest and induced apoptosis.;Combining vemurafenib and SCH722984 in BRAF mutant melanoma was synergistic in a majority of cell lines and significantly delayed the onset of acquired resistance in long term in vitro assays.

However, a subset of melanomas harbor non-p.V600E BRAF mutations, and these data are of potential importance regarding the efficacy of current targeted therapies. To better understand the BRAF mutation profile in melanomas, we retrospectively analyzed data from 1112 primary and metastatic melanomas at our institution. The cohort included nonacral cutaneous (n = 774), acral (n = 111), mucosal (n = 26), uveal (n = 23), leptomeningeal (n = 1), and metastatic melanomas of unknown primary site (n = 177). BRAF mutation hotspot regions in exons 11 and 15 were analyzed by pyrosequencing or with the primer extension MassARRAY system. A total of 499 (44.9%) specimens exhibited BRAF mutations, involving exon 15 [497 (99.6%)] or exon 11 [2 (0.4%)]. p.V600E was detected in 376 (75.4%) cases; the remaining 123 (24.6%) cases exhibited non-p.V600E mutations, of which p.V600K was most frequent [86 (17.2%)]. BRAF mutations were more frequent in nonacral cutaneous (51.4%) than acral melanomas [18 (16.2%)] (P < 0.001); however, there was no significant difference among cutaneous histological subtypes. All mucosal, uveal, and leptomeningeal melanomas were BRAF wild type (WT). The high frequency of non-p.V600E BRAF mutations in melanoma has important implications because the FDA-approved companion diagnostic test for p.V600E detects some but not all non-p.V600E mutations.

Cutaneous toxicities associated with the administration of BRAF inhibitors are considered to be induced by the paradoxical activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in wild-type BRAF cells. Changes in naevi, including new naevi, hyperpigmentation and fading of existing naevi, have also been reported. In addition, some patients receiving these therapies have developed second primary melanomas. As a consequence, the importance of sequential digital dermoscopy in all patients treated with a BRAFi to detect new primary melanomas has been emphasized. A 61-year-old man with BRAF mutant stage IV metastatic melanoma was commenced on the phase 1 trial of LGX818 at 300 mg daily in 2013. After 2 months of therapy, the patient was noted to have developed eruptive naevi, fading of existing naevi and darkening of other naevi. Excision of a new pigmented lesion from the back indicated a compound naevus. Immunohistochemistry showed that the naevus cells lacked a BRAF V600E mutation. This is the first reported case of eruptive naevi in a patient treated with LGX818. The absence of the BRAF V600E mutation within a changing naevus supports the theory that BRAFi stimulates the proliferation of wild-type BRAF cells. Close dermatological surveillance is important for all patients treated with any type of BRAFi. ",

This suggests that therapy with specific RAF kinase inhibitors may find use in treating this disease. If the response to RAF kinase inhibition is dependent on the presence of an activated BRAF protein, it will be necessary to evaluate cases of malignant melanoma for the presence or absence of BRAF mutations. High-resolution amplicon melting analysis is able to detect single base-pair changes in DNA isolated from paraffin-embedded tissue sections and obviates the need for direct DNA sequencing. Results can be available within 48 hours. In this report, we used high-resolution amplicon melting analysis to evaluate 90 cases of malignant melanoma for BRAF mutations. Of these 90 cases, 74 were metastatic melanomas, 12 were primary cutaneous melanomas, and 4 were in situ melanomas. BRAF activation mutations were found in 43 cases (48%). Forty-one of these mutations were in exon 15. The mutations in exon 15 included V600E (34 cases), V600K (6 cases), and V600R (1 case). Two activating mutations were found in exon 11, G469V and G469R. The presence or absence of a BRAF mutation in the junctional component of an invasive melanoma was maintained in the invasive component. We also evaluated these 90 cases, as well as an additional 10 cases (total of 100) for the expression of c-kit. The majority of invasive and metastatic malignant melanomas did not express c-kit, although all in situ lesions and the junctional components of invasive lesions were strongly c-kit positive. Surprisingly, 2 cases of metastatic malignant melanoma (2%) showed strong and diffuse c-kit expression and contained a c-kit-activating mutation, L576P, as detected by high-resolution amplicon melting analysis and confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. These 2 c-kit mutation-positive cases did not contain BRAF mutations. The presence of a c-kit-activating mutation in metastatic malignant melanoma suggests that a small number of melanomas may progress by a somatic mutation of the c-kit gene. The presence of BRAF- and c-kit-activating mutations in malignant melanoma suggests new approaches to treating this disease involving specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors may prove worthwhile and that mutation analysis by high-resolution melting analysis might help guide therapy.",

Recently, our lab showed that simultaneous activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and targeted inhibition of BRAF(V600E) by PLX4720 synergistically induces apoptosis across a spectrum of BRAF(V600E) melanoma cell lines. As a follow-up to that study, treatment of BRAF-mutant and NRAS-mutant melanoma lines with WNT3A and the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 also induces apoptosis. The susceptibility of BRAF-mutant lines and NRAS-mutant lines to apoptosis correlates with negative regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by ERK/MAPK signaling and dynamic decreases in abundance of the downstream scaffolding protein, AXIN1. Apoptosis-resistant NRAS-mutant lines can sensitize to AZD6244 by pretreatment with AXIN1 siRNA, similar to what we previously reported in BRAF-mutant cell lines. Taken together, these findings indicate that NRAS-mutant melanoma share with BRAF-mutant melanoma the potential to regulate apoptosis upon MEK inhibition through WNT3A and dynamic regulation of cellular AXIN1. Understanding the cellular context that makes melanoma cells susceptible to this combination treatment will contribute to the study and development of novel therapeutic combinations that may lead to more durable responses.",

MEK inhibitor U0126 or RNA interference (RNAi) for BRAF(V600E) decreased production of the immunosuppressive soluble factors interleukin (IL)-10, VEGF, or IL-6 from melanoma cells to levels comparable to those after signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 inactivation. The suppressive activity of the culture supernatants from the melanoma cells on the production of inflammatory cytokines IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor alpha by dendritic cells upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation was markedly reduced after transduction with BRAF(V600E) RNAi, comparable to the effects observed with STAT3 RNAi transduction. No additive or synergistic effects were observed by the simultaneous transduction of RNAi for both BRAF(V600E) and STAT3. Furthermore, specific DNA binding and transcriptional activity of STAT3 were not affected by down-regulation of the MAPK signaling with the BRAF RNAi.

Although previous studies have shown synergistic activity when pan-PI3K inhibitors were combined with MAPK inhibitors in the treatment of melanoma exhibiting concurrent genetic abnormalities, overlapping adverse events in patients limit optimal dosing and clinical application. With the aim of specifically targeting PTEN-deficient cancers and minimizing the potential for on-target toxicity when inhibiting multiple PI3K isoforms, we developed a program to discover PI3Kβ-selective kinase inhibitors and identified SAR260301 as a potent PI3Kβ-selective, orally available compound, which is now in clinical development. Herein, we provide a detailed biological characterization of SAR260301, and show that this compound has outstanding biochemical and cellular selectivity for the PI3Kβ isoform versus the α, δ, and γ isoforms and a large panel of protein and lipid kinases. We demonstrate that SAR260301 blocks PI3K pathway signaling preferentially in PTEN-deficient human tumor models, and has synergistic antitumor activity when combined with vemurafenib (BRAF inhibitor) or selumetinib (MEK inhibitor) in PTEN-deficient/BRAF-mutated human melanoma tumor models. Combination treatments were very well tolerated, suggesting the potential for a superior safety profile at optimal dosing using selective compounds to inhibit multiple signaling pathways. Together, these experiments provide a preclinical proof-of-concept for safely combining inhibitors of PI3Kβ and BRAF or MEK kinase modulators to improve antitumor activity in PTEN-deficient/BRAF-mutant melanoma, and support the evaluation of SAR260301-based combinations in clinical studies.

Between October 2009 and April 2011, 11 patients with metastatic melanoma harboring KIT gene mutations or KIT gene amplifications were enrolled in the first stage of phase II study and nilotinib was administered orally at a dose of 400 mg twice a day until disease progression or intolerable toxicities. The primary endpoint was response rate and secondary endpoints were safety, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).;Of 11 patients, 9 patients were evaluable for treatment response. Of 9 patients, three patients had KIT mutations in exon 11, Leu576Pro, Val559Ala and Lys558Arg; and 6 patients had KIT amplifications > 50 copies compared to control DNA. Two patients achieved partial response (22.2%) and 5 patients achieved stable disease (55.6%). In two patients who responded to nilotinib, both had KIT mutations and showed durable response for 8.4 months and 10.0+ months. Of note, one patient with KIT amplification had stable disease with response for 6 months. A decrease in tumor size from baseline was observed in four patients (44.4%). Nilotinib 800 mg/d was very well tolerated with grade 1 nausea and grade 1 dry-eye being the most common adverse events.;We have decided to publish the preliminary results because anti-tumor activity of nilotinib was promising in KIT mutated patients. Although our results are preliminary, nilotinib had very favorable toxicity profile with durable response in metastatic melanoma patients with KIT mutations. The anti-tumor activity of nilotinib in melanoma patients with KIT amplification is yet to be determined in future studies.

A total of 100 patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage IIIC unresectable or stage IV melanoma and who underwent tumor DNA BRAF mutation testing were selected. Paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed melanoma biopsies were analyzed for the BRAF mutation status by independent, blinded observers using both conventional DNA molecular techniques and IHC with the novel BRAF V600E mutant-specific antibody, VE1. The antibody had a sensitivity of 97% (37/38) and a specificity of 98% (58/59) for detecting the presence of a BRAF V600E mutation. Of the BRAF-mutated cases, none of the non-V600E cases (including V600K) stained positive with the antibody (0/11). There were 5 cases with discordant BRAF mutation results. Additional molecular analysis confirmed the immunohistochemically obtained BRAF result in 3 cases, suggesting that the initial molecular testing results were incorrect. Two of these patients would not have received a BRAF inhibitor on the basis of the initial false-negative mutation testing result. Two cases remained discordant. The reported IHC method is an accurate, rapid, and cost-effective method for detecting V600E BRAF mutations in melanoma patients.

MITF amplification rates were correlated with tumor chemosensitivity quantified by an ATP-based luminescence assay and with chemotherapy outcome in terms of response and survival.;Of 116 tumor tissues, 104 were evaluable for MITF gene amplification. Strong amplification (> or =4 copies per cell) was detected in 24 of 104 tissues (23%), whereas 62 of 104 tissues (60%) harbored >3 copies per cell. Strong MITF gene amplification was associated with a reduced disease-specific survival (P = 0.031). However, no correlation was found between MITF copy number and in vitro chemosensitivity or in vivo chemotherapy response.;Our findings suggest that strong amplifications of the melanoma oncogene MITF affects patient survival but does not influence tumor chemosensitivity and chemotherapy response.

Inhibition of BRAF(V600E) by oncogene targeting therapy increases overall survival of patients with melanoma, but is unable to produce many durable responses. Adaptive drug resistance remains the main limitation to BRAF(V600E) inhibitor clinical efficacy and immune-based strategies could be useful to overcome disease relapse. Tumor microenvironment greatly differs between visceral metastasis and primary cutaneous melanoma, and the mechanisms involved in the antimetastatic efficacy of BRAF(V600E) inhibitors remain to be determined. To address this question, we developed a metastatic BRAF(V600E)-mutant melanoma cell line and demonstrated that the antimetastatic properties of BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 (a research analogue of vemurafenib) require host natural killer (NK) cells and perforin. Indeed, PLX4720 not only directly limited BRAF(V600E)-induced tumor cell proliferation, but also affected NK cell functions. We showed that PLX4720 increases the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, CD69 expression, and proliferation of mouse NK cells in vitro. NK cell frequencies were significantly enhanced by PLX4720 specifically in the lungs of mice with BRAF(V600E) lung metastases. Furthermore, PLX4720 also increased human NK cell pERK1/2, CD69 expression, and IFNγ release in the context of anti-NKp30 and IL2 stimulation. Overall, this study supports the idea that additional NK cell-based immunotherapy (by checkpoint blockade or agonists or cytokines) may combine well with BRAF(V600E) inhibitor therapy to promote more durable responses in melanoma.",

Sequence analysis for SOX10, a transcription factor, which both acts upstream of MITF and synergizes with MITF, identified an additional three samples with frameshift or nonsense mutations. Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor and SOX10 were found to be mutated in a mutually exclusive fashion, possibly suggesting disruption in a common genetic pathway. Taken together we found that over 20% of the metastatic melanoma cases had alterations in the MITF pathway. We show that the MITF pathway is also altered in primary melanomas: 2/26 demonstrated mutations in MITF and 6/55 demonstrated mutations in SOX10.

In the last decade, translational research identified important mechanisms in malignant transformation, invasion, and progression. Signaling pathways can be abnormally activated by oncogenes. The identification of oncogenic mutated kinases implicated in this process provides an opportunity for new target therapies. The melanoma dependence on BRAF-mutated kinase allowed the development of inhibitors that produced major responses in clinical trials. This is the beginning of a novel class of drugs in metastatic melanoma; the identification of the transduction signaling networking and other \"druggable\" kinases is in active research. In this paper, we discuss the ongoing research on cellular signaling inhibition, resistance mechanisms, and strategies to overcome treatment failure.",

However, the majority of such patients either exhibit de novo resistance from the beginning of the treatment or acquire resistance and eventually relapse. Despite tremendous progress in understanding the underlying mechanisms of resistance, overcoming resistance to BRAF inhibitors remains an unmet medical need. Constitutive activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4/6 as a result of genetic aberrations including CDKN2A inactivation and CCND1 amplification is common across many cancer types and frequently co-occurs with oncogenic BRAF mutations. Also, cyclin D1 overexpression is a common feature of resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Here we review CDK4/6 as a therapeutic target in BRAF mutant cancers and discuss emerging evidence supporting a critical role of cyclin D1/CDK4/6 axis in de novo and acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Co-targeting CDK4/6 and BRAF could be a more effective therapy to augment clinical response of BRAF inhibitors and overcome resistance in BRAF mutant cancers. ",

These drugs proved vastly superior to conventional chemotherapy, however response, resistance and toxicity were limitations. The second major advance is the development of other immune checkpoint blocking agents, including PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies, and the use of BRAF and MEK inhibitors in combination, with a higher proportion of durable responses coupled with less toxicity.

However, adverse effects and the onset of resistance are frequently observed, limiting the efficacy of this treatment. Patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDTX) engrafted in immunocompromised mice have been proposed as valuable preclinical models that can predict clinical response to treatments. Here, we established a PDTX model of BRAF V600E melanoma useful for testing the efficacy of vemurafenib. First, we validated the stability of the model that was similar to the original tumor with respect to histology, immunohistochemistry, mutational status, and fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG)-PET/computed tomography (CT). Next, the sensitivity of the xenografts to vemurafenib was determined by tumor growth inhibition and decreased in standardized uptake value on [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT. Finally, this result, using personalized PDTX, allowed successful rechallenge with vemurafenib in a patient who was administered a lower dose of vemurafenib because of the onset of adverse events. Overall, we found that PDTX provides 'real-time' results in an animal that phenocopies the biology and expected vemurafenib responses of the tumor in a patient with BRAF V600E melanoma. Thus, this 'coclinical' trial using PDTX can help guide vemurafenib treatment for metastatic melanoma.",

It can be hypothesized that metastatic melanomas with activating BRAF mutation may respond to RAF kinase-blocking therapy. The objective of the study was to analyze if the activating BRAF V600E mutation is present in metastatic melanomas.;Fine-needle aspirates from 44 metastatic melanomas were studied. The V600E mutation in exon 15 of the BRAF gene was selected for genotyping. A Taq-Man MGB biallelic discrimination system was used.

Tumours with BRAF V600E mutation had a tendency to have a more aggressive clinical course. The growth fraction showed correlation with tumour progression. This study indicates that the V600E mutation is present in metastatic melanomas and occurs more often in sites without chronic sun exposure. Mutated tumours may have a more aggressive clinical course since such melanomas metastasize at an earlier stage.

Clinical data were extracted to determine extracranial and intracranial objective response rates, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. A bait-capture, next-generation sequencing assay was used to identify mutations in pretreatment tumors that could explain primary resistance to vemurafenib.;Among patients with intracranial disease treated with vemurafenib, 27 were included in survival analyses and 22 patients were assessable for response. The extracranial and intracranial objective response rates were 71% and 50%, respectively. Discordant responses were observed between extracranial and intracranial metastatic sites in 4 of 19 evaluable patients. Median PFS was 4.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.6-7.9); median intracranial PFS was 4.6 months (95% CI: 2.7-7.9), median OS was 7.5 months (95% CI: 4.3-not reached), with a 30.4% 1-year OS rate.

Adequate samples for next-generation sequencing analysis were available for seven patients.

The safety and efficacy of concurrent radiotherapy and RAF inhibition requires careful clinical evaluation. Combination strategies blocking the MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathway may be warranted in a subset of patients.;Vemurafenib is active for BRAF-mutant intracranial melanoma metastases in an unselected patient population typical of routine oncologic practice. Patients with poor performance status appear to have poor outcomes despite vemurafenib therapy.

We found that BRAF inhibition induces invasion and metastasis in RAS mutant melanoma cells through a mechanism mediated by the reactivation of the MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase)-ERK pathway, increased expression and secretion of interleukin 8, and induction of protease-dependent invasion. These events were accompanied by a cell morphology switch from predominantly rounded to predominantly elongated cells. We also observed similar responses in BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma cells.

However, increasing attention is being turned towards the participation of 'epigenetic' events in melanoma progression that do not affect DNA sequence, but which nevertheless may lead to stable inherited changes in gene expression. Epigenetic events including histone modifications and DNA methylation play a key role in normal development and are crucial to establishing the correct program of gene expression. In contrast, mistargeting of such epigenetic modifications can lead to aberrant patterns of gene expression and loss of anti-cancer checkpoints. Thus, to date at least 50 genes have been reported to be dysregulated in melanoma by aberrant DNA methylation and accumulating evidence also suggests that mistargetting of histone modifications and altered chromatin remodeling activities will play a key role in melanoma. This review gives an overview of the many different types of epigenetic modifications and their involvement in cancer and especially in melanoma development and progression.",

However, new strategies are desperately needed to overcome therapeutic resistance to these agents, as well as to identify effective treatment approaches for cancer patients that fall outside major targetable mutational subtypes (e.g., non-V600 BRAF melanoma). One such strategy is to extend the paradigm of individually tailored, molecularly targeted therapy into a broader spectrum of melanoma patients, particularly those bearing tumors without commonly recognized therapeutic targets, as well as having failed or were ineligible for immunotherapy. In this nontreatment pilot study, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies were utilized, including whole genome and whole transcriptome sequencing, to identify molecular aberrations in patients with non-V600 BRAF metastatic melanoma. This information was then rationally matched to an appropriate clinical treatment from a defined pharmacopeia. Five patients with advanced non-V600 BRAF metastatic melanoma were enrolled. We demonstrated successful performance of the following during a clinically relevant time period: patient tumor biopsy, quality DNA/RNA extraction, DNA/RNA-based sequencing for gene expression analysis, analysis utilizing a series of data integration methodologies, report generation, and tumor board review with formulated treatment plan. Streamlining measures were conducted based on the experiences of enrolling, collecting specimens, and analyzing the molecular signatures of patients.

Twenty-eight lesions were conjunctival nevi, of which 20 were excised from children younger than 18 years. Fifteen lesions were conjunctival primary acquired melanosis (PAM; 11 without atypia and 4 with atypia) and five were conjunctival melanomas. To detect the BRAF T1799A mutation, both a newly developed kit (Mutector; TrimGen, Sparks, MD) and direct DNA sequence analysis of exon 15 after PCR amplification were used.;The T1799A BRAF mutation was identified in 14 of 28 (50%) conjunctival nevi analyzed, but in none of the 15 conjunctival PAMs, with and without atypia. The T1799A BRAF mutation was identified in two of the five (40%) conjunctival melanomas. There was no difference in the BRAF mutation detected in conjunctival nevi in children or adults, as the BRAF mutation was detected in 50%.;The results showed that conjunctival nevi, similar to skin nevi, have a high frequency of oncogenic BRAF mutations.

Because of the declining success in melanoma therapy, the curative treatment for advanced stage melanoma has been a challenge for clinicians. Several mutations such as N-RAS, p53, BRAF including mutant-BRAF that lead to activation of kinase pathway, are implicated in the development of malignant melanoma. However, the current literature depicts that the prognostic role of BRAF mutation in disease progression is still controversial. While its higher level in advanced stage disease is associated with decreased overall survival (OS), some studies show that it failed to confer as an independent prognostic predictor of the disease. This has also led researchers to accomplish newer therapeutic strategies that lead to improved disease-response and grant survival benefits. Vemurafenib, a BRAF inhibitor agent, is one of the few available targeted therapies that is FDA approved and provides promising results in metastatic disease. However, its resistance at an early stage is of great concern. Recent implementation of combinational therapies including \"targeted therapy\", immunotherapy, and biological agents has appealed many researchers to define the adjunctive role of available therapies and their limitations in advanced stage and metastatic melanoma. This commends the need for future multi-institutional studies to confirm the clinical validity of different therapeutic strategies on a large scale population. ",

The development of small molecule inhibitors of mutant BRAF kinase has changed the care of patients, especially with melanoma. Despite the success in treating melanoma with inhibitors of mutant BRAF and other elements of RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK (MAPK) pathway, resistance limits the long-term responsiveness to these drugs. The resistance mechanisms to MAPK pathway inhibition are complex, occur at genomic and phenotypic levels, and frequently the same patient can simultaneously develop diverse mechanisms of resistance in different progressive metastases or even in the same lesion. In the current review, we summarize recent research on mutations in BRAF and their importance for the development of tumor.

Studies ascertaining the potential utility of CXCR4 mRNA as a prognosticator in melanoma have focused mainly on metastatic melanoma with conflicting results. In the light of this, we sought to explore the potential relationship between CXCR4 mRNA expression with established histopathologic prognosticators and BRAF status in melanoma. Archived consecutive samples (n=107) of primary cutaneous melanoma were retrieved and assessed for the following: CXCR4 mRNA (semiquantitative RT-PCR) and BRAF exon 15 status (DNA Sanger sequencing). Statistical analyses included correlation between CXCR4 mRNA levels and established histopathologic prognosticators as well as the BRAF status using univariate and multiple linear methods. Multivariable analyses revealed a significant correlation between elevated CXCR4 mRNA (low ΔCt value) and the presence of BRAF mutation (P=0.02). Absence of a brisk host response was associated with elevated CXCR4 mRNA expression (P=0.04). CXCR4 mRNA was significantly lower in AJCC stage 2 compared with stage 1 after controlling for significant clinical prognosticators (P=0.02). The association between elevated CXCR4 mRNA and absence of a brisk host response suggests that CXCR4 may be involved in regulation of the host immune response in melanoma and is a molecule of potential utility as a biomarker for recruiting melanoma patients for immunotherapy. Higher CXCR4 mRNA in patients with a BRAF mutation suggests its utility as a putative therapeutic target. ",

To explore the molecular mechanisms involved in primary resistance to PLX4032, we investigated its effects on cell proliferation and signaling in a panel of 27 genetically characterized patient-derived melanoma cell lines. Cell sensitivity to PLX4032 was dependent on BRAF(V600E) and independent from other gene alterations that commonly occur in melanoma such as PTEN loss, BRAF, and MITF gene amplification. Two cell lines lacking sensitivity to PLX4032 and harboring a different set of genetic alterations were studied as models of primary resistance. Treatment with the MEK inhibitor UO126 but not with PLX4032 inhibited cell growth and ERK activation. Resistance to PLX4032 was maintained after CRAF down-regulation by siRNA indicating alternative activation of MEK-ERK signaling. Genetic characterization by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and analysis of phosphotyrosine signaling by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis revealed the activation of MET and SRC signaling, associated with the amplification of MET and of CTNNB1 and CCND1 genes, respectively. The combination of PLX4032 with drugs or siRNA targeting MET was effective in inhibiting cell growth and reducing cell invasion and migration in melanoma cells with MET amplification; similar effects were observed after targeting SRC in the other cell line, indicating a role for MET and SRC signaling in primary resistance to PLX4032.

PD0325901 effects were determined in a panel of melanoma cell lines with different genetic aberrations. PD0325901 markedly inhibited ERK phosphorylation and growth of both BRAF mutant and wild-type melanoma cell lines, with IC(50) in the nanomolar range even in the least responsive models. Growth inhibition was observed both in vitro and in vivo in xenograft models, regardless of BRAF mutation status, and was due to G(1)-phase cell cycle arrest and subsequent induction of apoptosis. Cell cycle (cyclin D1, c-Myc, and p27(KIP1)) and apoptosis (Bcl-2 and survivin) regulators were modulated by PD0325901 at the protein level. Gene expression profiling revealed profound modulation of several genes involved in the negative control of MAPK signaling and melanoma cell differentiation, suggesting alternative, potentially relevant mechanisms of action. Finally, PD0325901 inhibited the production of the proangiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor and interleukin 8 at a transcriptional level. In conclusion, PD0325901 exerts potent growth-inhibitory, proapoptotic, and antiangiogenic activity in melanoma lines, regardless of their BRAF mutation status.

        "Doc_abstract":"The notorious unresponsiveness of metastatic cutaneous melanoma to current treatment strategies coupled with its increasing incidence constitutes a serious worldwide clinical problem. Moreover, despite recent advances in targeted therapies for patients with BRAF(V600E) mutant melanomas, acquired resistance remains a limiting factor and hence emphasises the acute need for comprehensive pre-clinical studies to increase the biological understanding of such tumours in order to develop novel effective and longlasting therapeutic strategies. Autophagy and ER stress both have a role in melanoma development/progression and chemoresistance although their real impact is still unclear. Here, we show that BRAF(V600E) induces a chronic ER stress status directly increasing basal cell autophagy. BRAF(V600E)-mediated p38 activation stimulates both the IRE1/ASK1/JNK and TRB3 pathways. Bcl-XL/Bcl-2 phosphorylation by active JNK releases Beclin1 whereas TRB3 inhibits the Akt/mTor axes, together resulting in an increase in basal autophagy. Furthermore, we demonstrate chemical chaperones relieve the BRAF(V600E)-mediated chronic ER stress status, consequently reducing basal autophagic activity and increasing the sensitivity of melanoma cells to apoptosis. Taken together, these results suggest enhanced basal autophagy, typically observed in BRAF(V600E) melanomas, is a consequence of a chronic ER stress status, which ultimately results in the chemoresistance of such tumours. Targeted therapies that attenuate ER stress may therefore represent a novel and more effective therapeutic strategy for BRAF mutant melanoma. ",

While the BRAF V600E mutation is implemented in the clinic, no method for its detection has so far been established as reference. We aimed to perform a comprehensive comparison of three methods currently being used for V600E detection in clinical samples. We analysed genomic DNA from 127 malignant melanomas (77 patients) and 389 tumours from 141 colorectal cancer patients (383 liver metastases and 6 primary tumours) by Sanger sequencing and a single probe-based high-resolution melting assay (LightMix). Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue from a subset of these lesions (n = 77 and 304, respectively) was analysed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using the V600E-specific antibody VE1. In a dilution series of V600E-mutated DNA in wild-type DNA, the detection limit for the LightMix assay was 1:1000 mutated alleles while it was 1:10 for Sanger sequencing. In line with this, we detected 15 additional mutated melanoma samples and two additional mutated metastatic colorectal cancer samples by the LightMix assay compared to Sanger sequencing. For the melanoma samples, we observed high concordance between DNA-based methods and analysis by IHC. However, in colorectal samples, IHC performed poorly with 12 samples being scored as V600E positive exclusively by IHC and nine samples being scored as V600E negative exclusively by IHC. In conclusion, the VE1 antibody is not recommendable for clinical tests of colorectal cancer samples. For melanoma samples, IHC may be useful as a screening tool guiding further analytical approaches.",

Med. Chem. 52, 2255-2264 (2009). There are currently no therapies known to alter the clinical course of disseminated melanoma. Mutational profiling studies have shown that the majority of melanomas harbor activating mutations in the serine/threonine kinase BRAF at the V600E position. Preclinical work has validated mutated BRAF as a therapeutic target in melanoma, and a number of BRAF-selective small-molecule inhibitors are now undergoing clinical evaluation. The only BRAF inhibitor to be investigated extensively in clinical trials of melanoma at this time is sorafenib--a compound with very limited single-agent activity. As sorafenib has poor cellular activity against the BRAF V600E mutation, the conclusion that many researchers have arrived at is that sorafenib did not provide a test of the therapeutic value of BRAF inhibition. Thus, more highly selective BRAF inhibitors have been sought. The current paper describes the identification of a new class of BRAF inhibitors that contain pyridoimidazolone as the ATP hinge-binding domain and a rigid imidazolone group. Building upon this novel scaffold, the authors derived a series of compounds with low nanomolar potency against mutated BRAF in isolated kinase assays, and low micromolar potency in cellular assays. These new chemical leads represent a significant step forward in the search for new, potent BRAF-selective small-molecule inhibitors.",

The main objective of our work was to investigate the relationship between mutant BRAF DNA in plasma and clinical response. Thirty-eight stage IV patients with a V600 mutated BRAF melanoma were included prior to any treatment. DNA was extracted from plasma and mutant DNA was detected using the amplification-refractory mutation system method. Before the beginning of any treatment, the corresponding BRAF mutation was detected in 29 of the 38 tested plasma samples (76.3% positive per cent agreement). We observed a strong correlation between the presence of circulating mutated DNA and overall survival (OS; P=.02), and with the number of metastatic sites (P=.01). The presence of circulating mutated DNA was also strongly correlated with serum LDH activity (P<.01) and S100 protein concentration (P<.01). Finally, seven patients presented discordant BRAF status in different tumor sites. In all these patients, the test performed on ctDNA was positive, suggesting that ctDNA analysis might be less sensitive to tumor heterogeneity. Altogether, these results suggest that plasmatic mutant BRAF DNA is a prognostic factor of OS, correlated with tumor burden. In addition, it represents an interesting alternative source of DNA to detect BRAF mutations before treatment. ",

Despite these advances, resistance remains an issue, as illustrated recently by the clinical experience with vemurafenib. Such acquired resistance appears to be the result of parallel pathway activation, such as PI3K, to overcome single-agent inhibition. In this report, we describe the cytotoxicity and anti-tumour activity of the novel MEK inhibitor, E6201, in a broad panel of melanoma cell lines (n = 31) of known mutational profile in vitro and in vivo. We further test the effectiveness of combining E6201 with an inhibitor of PI3K (LY294002) in overcoming resistance in these cell lines.;The majority of melanoma cell lines were either sensitive (IC50 < 500 nM, 24/31) or hypersensitive (IC50 < 100 nM, 18/31) to E6201. This sensitivity correlated with wildtype PTEN and mutant BRAF status, whereas mutant RAS and PI3K pathway activation were associated with resistance. Although MEK inhibitors predominantly exert a cytostatic effect, E6201 elicited a potent cytocidal effect on most of the sensitive lines studied, as evidenced by Annexin positivity and cell death ELISA. Conversely, E6201 did not induce cell death in the two resistant melanoma cell lines tested. E6201 inhibited xenograft tumour growth in all four melanoma cell lines studied to varying degrees, but a more pronounced anti-tumour effect was observed for cell lines that previously demonstrated a cytocidal response in vitro. In vitro combination studies of E6201 and LY294002 showed synergism in all six melanoma cell lines tested, as defined by a mean combination index < 1.;Our data demonstrate that E6201 elicits a predominantly cytocidal effect in vitro and in vivo in melanoma cells of diverse mutational background. Resistance to E6201 was associated with disruption of PTEN and activation of downstream PI3K signalling. In keeping with these data we demonstrate that co-inhibition of MAPK and PI3K is effective in overcoming resistance inherent in melanoma.",

Here we use Illumina 317K whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays to define a comprehensive allelotype of melanoma based on loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and copy number changes in a panel of 76 melanoma cell lines. In keeping with previous reports, we found frequent LOH on chromosome arms 9p (72%), 10p (55%), 10q (55%), 9q (49%), 6q (43%), 11q (43%), and 17p (41%). Tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) can be identified through homozygous deletion (HD). We detected 174 HDs, the most common of which targeted CDKN2A (n = 33). The second highest frequency of HD occurred in PTEN (n = 8), another well known melanoma TSG. HDs were also common for PTPRD (n = 7) and HDAC4 (n = 3), TSGs recently found to be mutated or deleted in other cancer types. Analysis of other HDs and regions of LOH that we have identified might lead to the characterization of further melanoma TSGs. We noted 197 regional amplifications, including some centered on the melanoma oncogenes MITF (n = 9), NRAS (n = 3), BRAF (n = 3), and CCND1 (n = 3). Other amplifications potentially target novel oncogenes important in the development of a subset of melanomas.

Pharmacologic inhibitors and siRNA were used in combination with PLX4720 to inhibit PI3K and methyltransferase in cell lines and murine models.;Compared with melanoma, CRC lines show higher levels of PI3K/AKT pathway activation. CRC cell lines with mutations in PTEN or PIK3CA were less sensitive to growth inhibition by PLX4720 (P = 0.03), and knockdown of PTEN expression in sensitive CRC cells reduced growth inhibition by the drug. Combined treatment of PLX4720 with PI3K inhibitors caused synergistic growth inhibition in BRAF-mutant CRC cells with both primary and secondary resistance. In addition, methyltransferase inhibition was synergistic with PLX4720 and decreased AKT activation. In vivo, PLX4720 combined with either inhibitors of AKT or methyltransferase showed greater tumor growth inhibition than PLX4720 alone. Clones with acquired resistance to PLX4720 in vitro showed PI3K/AKT activation with EGF receptor (EGFR) or KRAS amplification.;We show that activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway is a mechanism of both innate and acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors in BRAF(V600E) CRC and suggest combinatorial approaches to improve outcomes in this poor prognosis subset of patients.",

Inhibiting HSP90 offers an approach to simultaneously interfere with multiple resistance mechanisms. Using the HSP90 inhibitor AT13387, which is currently in clinical trials, we investigated the potential of HSP90 inhibition to overcome or delay the emergence of resistance to these kinase inhibitors in melanoma models. In vitro, treating vemurafenib-sensitive cells (A375 or SK-MEL-28) with a combination of AT13387 and vemurafenib prevented colony growth under conditions in which vemurafenib treatment alone generated resistant colonies. In vivo, when AT13387 was combined with vemurafenib in a SK-MEL-28, vemurafenib-sensitive model, no regrowth of tumors was observed over 5 months, although 2 of 7 tumors in the vemurafenib monotherapy group relapsed in this time. Together, these data suggest that the combination of these agents can delay the emergence of resistance. Cell lines with acquired vemurafenib resistance, derived from these models (A375R and SK-MEL-28R) were also sensitive to HSP90 inhibitor treatment; key clients were depleted, apoptosis was induced, and growth in 3D culture was inhibited. Similar effects were observed in cell lines with acquired resistance to both BRAF and MEK inhibitors (SK-MEL-28RR, WM164RR, and 1205LuRR). These data suggest that treatment with an HSP90 inhibitor, such as AT13387, is a potential approach for combating resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibition in melanoma. Moreover, frontline combination of these agents with an HSP90 inhibitor could delay the emergence of resistance, providing a strong rationale for clinical investigation of such combinations in BRAF-mutated melanoma.",

Since these agents have been developed with a refined understanding of their mechanism of action and mechanisms leading to resistance are being elucidated, then combination therapies building on these single-agent therapies can be designed rationally.

Twenty six studies on colorectal cancer (11,773 patients) and four studies on melanoma (674 patients) were included in our final meta-analysis. The average prevalence of BRAF mutation was 9.6% in colorectal cancer, and 47.8% in melanoma reports. We found that BRAF mutation increases the risk of mortality in colorectal cancer patients for more than two times; HR = 2.25 (95% CI, 1.82-2.83).

Several notable observations were obtained: (i) phospho-ERK staining was very heterogeneous within the tumor; (ii) in most cases, ERK was phosphorylated in only a minority of tumor cells; (iii) the percentage of phospho-ERK-positive cells was not correlated with the mutational status of NRAS and/or BRAF; (iv) the Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) was expressed homogeneously in virtually all melanoma samples not reflecting the inhomogeneity of phospho-ERK; and, finally, (v) neither the portion of phospho-ERK-positive tumor cells nor the RKIP staining intensity showed any correlation to the clinical course of the patients.

However, the mechanism(s) involved remains less understood. Here, we report that combinations of HDAC and BRAF inhibitors kill BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells by induction of necrosis. Cotreatment with the HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) or panobinostat (LBH589) and the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 activated the caspase cascade, but caspases appeared dispensable for killing, in that inhibition of caspases did not invariably block induction of cell death. The majority of dying cells acquired propidium iodide positivity instantly when they became positive for Annexin V, suggesting induction of necrosis. This was supported by caspase-independent release of high-mobility group protein B1, and further consolidated by rupture of the plasma membrane and loss of nuclear and cytoplasmic contents, as manifested by transmission electron microscopic analysis. Of note, neither the necrosis inhibitor necrostatin-1 nor the small interference RNA (siRNA) knockdown of receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) inhibited cell death, suggesting that RIPK1 and RIPK3 do not contribute to induction of necrosis by combinations of HDAC and BRAF inhibitors in BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells. Significantly, SAHA and the clinically available BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib cooperatively inhibited BRAF(V600E) melanoma xenograft growth in a mouse model even when caspase-3 was inhibited.

While treatment with selective BRAF(V600E) inhibitors (like vemurafenib or dabrafenib) leads to high response rates but short response duration, CTLA-4 blocking therapies induce sustained responses, but only in a limited number of patients. The combination of these diametric treatment approaches may further improve survival, but pre-clinical data concerning this approach is limited. We investigated, using Tyr::CreER(T2)PTEN(F-/-)BRAF(F-V600E/+) inducible melanoma mice, whether BRAF(V600E) inhibition can synergize with anti-CTLA-4 mAb treatment, focusing on the interaction between the BRAF(V600E) inhibitor PLX4720 and the immune system. While PLX4720 treatment strongly decreased tumor growth, it did not induce cell death in BRAF(V600E)/PTEN(-/-) melanomas. More strikingly, PLX4720 treatment led to a decreased frequency of tumor-resident T cells, NK-cells, MDSCs and macrophages, which could not be restored by the addition of anti-CTLA-4 mAb. As this effect was not observed upon treatment of BRAF wild-type B16F10 tumors, we conclude that the decreased frequency of immune cells correlates to BRAF(V600E) inhibition in tumor cells and is not due to an off-target effect of PLX4720 on immune cells. Furthermore, anti-CTLA-4 mAb treatment of inducible melanoma mice treated with PLX4720 did not result in enhanced tumor control, while anti-CTLA-4 mAb treatment did improve the effect of tumor-vaccination in B16F10-inoculated mice.

        "Doc_abstract":"Mutations in BRAF, a component of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK) cascade, are frequent in melanoma. It is important to understand how BRAF mutations contribute to malignant traits including anchorage- and growth factor-independence. We have previously shown that efficient activation of ERK in normal human epidermal melanocytes (NHEM) requires both adhesion to the extracellular matrix and growth factors. Mutant V599E BRAF is sufficient to promote ERK activation independent of adhesion and growth factors. Here, we analysed regulation of G1 cell cycle events in NHEM and human melanoma cells. We show that S phase entry in NHEM requires both adhesion and growth factor signaling through the MEK-ERK pathway. This control correlates with induction of cyclin D1 and downregulation of p27Kip1, two key G1 cell cycle events. In melanoma cells expressing V599E BRAF, cyclin D1 was constitutively expressed independent of adhesion but dependent upon MEK activation and nuclear accumulation of ERK. Reduction of cyclin D1 levels by RNA interference inhibited S phase entry in melanoma cells. Importantly, expression of V599E BRAF in NHEM was sufficient to promote cyclin D1 promoter activity in the absence of adhesion. Additionally, p27Kip1 levels were downregulated in V599E BRAF-expressing melanoma cells and active BRAF was sufficient to downregulate p27Kip1 in serum-starved NHEM. Thus, adhesion-growth factor cooperation, leading to efficient activation of ERK, regulates cyclin D1 and p27Kip1 levels in human melanocytes and mutant BRAF overrides adhesion-growth factor control of these two G1 cell cycle proteins in melanomas. These findings provide important insight into how BRAF mutations contribute to aberrant human melanocyte proliferation.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The advent of drugs targeting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway has markedly changed the treatment of advanced-stage melanoma harboring BRAF mutations. However, drug resistance, through mechanisms not well elucidated, often occurs. A better understanding of how melanoma-derived immunologically active molecules change in response to MAPK inhibition of BRAF mutated (BRAF) and BRAF wild type (BRAF) melanomas could help identify promising treatment combinations of small molecule inhibitors and immunotherapy. To this aim, we treated 13 BRAF and 13 BRAF mutated human melanoma cell lines with either a specific BRAF inhibitor or an MEK1/2 inhibitor and analyzed changes in the secretion of 42 selected cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. We also measured changes in the expression levels of immunologically relevant melanoma cell surface markers. The BRAF melanomas showed minimal changes in response to the inhibitors, whereas the BRAF cell lines showed, on average, a significant decrease in IFNα2, interleukin-7, Fractalkine, GCSF, GRO, TGFα2, interleukin-8, and VEGF, as well as a reduction in pERK and pMEK protein levels, upon MAPK pathway blockade. BRAF inhibition in BRAF cell lines also resulted in significant changes in the expression of several surface markers including upregulation of β2-microglobulin as well as a decrease in MIC A/B and TRAIL-R2. These results indicate that MAPK pathway inhibition leads to changes in the immunological properties of mutant BRAF melanoma cells and lends support for future studies aimed at designing effective treatment strategies that combine BRAF and MEK inhibition with immunotherapy.

A variety of random and non-random chromosomal alterations were detected, with gains within chromosomes 20q, 7q, 7p, 20p, 6p and 17q and losses in 9p, 10q, 6q, 10p, 4q, and 11q being the most common observations. In addition, several other chromosomal loci were over- or under-represented in subgroups of melanomas. For example, sequences on 3q26 were over-represented in 33% and on 5p15.33 in 27% of cell cultures, reaching the level of amplification in 12% and 22%, respectively. These regions harbour the two essential genes for the enzyme telomerase: the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (hTERT) on 5p15.33 and the telomerase RNA component gene (hTERC) on 3q26. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization and Southern blot analysis, both genes were shown to be over-represented or amplified in several melanomas. Interestingly, hTERT amplification was abundant in superficial spreading primary melanomas, subcutaneous metastases and malignant effusion-derived cells, but completely absent or very rare in primary nodular melanomas as well as brain, bone and lymph node metastases. Several chromosomes or chromosomal regions harbouring telomerase-suppressing activities (3p, 4, 6 and 10p) were frequently under-represented in melanomas. Our data suggest that genetic alterations at several chromosomal loci might facilitate activation of telomerase during the development of cutaneous malignant melanoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"During cancer development, it is well established that many genes, including tumor suppressor genes, are hypermethylated and transcriptionally repressed, a phenomenon referred to as epigenetic silencing. In general, the factors involved in, and the mechanistic basis of, epigenetic silencing during cancer development are not well understood. We have recently described an epigenetic silencing pathway, directed by the oncogenic B-Raf proto-oncogene (BRAF) variant BRAF(V600E), that mediates widespread epigenetic silencing in colorectal cancer (CRC). Notably, the BRAF(V600E) mutation is also present in 50-70% of melanomas. Here, we show that the same pathway we identified in CRC also directs epigenetic silencing of a similar set of genes in BRAF-positive melanoma. In both CRC and melanoma, BRAF(V600E) promotes epigenetic silencing through up-regulation of v-maf avian musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog G (MAFG), a transcriptional repressor with sequence-specific DNA-binding activity. The elevated concentration of MAFG drives DNA binding on the promoter. Promoter-bound MAFG recruits a set of corepressors that includes its heterodimeric partner BTB and CNC homology 1, basic leucine zipper transcription factor 1 (BACH1), the chromatin remodeling factor chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 8 (CHD8), and the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B, resulting in hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing. Our results reveal a common BRAF(V600E)-directed transcriptional regulatory pathway that mediates epigenetic silencing in unrelated solid tumors and provide strong support for an instructive model of oncoprotein-directed epigenetic silencing.

With 30 amplification cycles, expression of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), IL-7, gro alpha, IL-8 and the p35 chain of IL-12 was detected in more than 60% of melanomas.

Treatment traditionally continues until disease progression or the development of unacceptable toxicity. Acquired drug resistance and toxicity are key challenges with the use of these drugs. Resistance to vemurafenib usually develops within 6-8 months. Management of drug toxicity typically involves stopping vemurafenib until resolution, before restarting at a lower dose, or permanently ceasing vemurafenib therapy. We have recently considered whether intermittent dosing could be used as an alternative to dose reduction/termination in the management of vemurafenib toxicity. One patient treated with intermittent vemurafenib was an 89-year-old woman with metastatic melanoma, who initially showed a good response to continuous dosing. Recurrent toxicity meant that the continuous vemurafenib dosage was repeatedly ceased before restarting at a lower dose. Ten months after vemurafenib was first begun, an intermittent dosing regimen was introduced in an attempt to control toxicity. This continued for 2 months, before cessation due to continued unacceptable toxicity. A further 24 months later, the patient remains fit and well in complete clinical remission, with no recurrence of her previous melanoma and no new primary malignancies. To the best of our knowledge, a continued response after the cessation of selective BRAF inhibitors has never before been described in melanoma. Induction of an immune response and/or epigenetic changes could explain continued disease response after cessation of vemurafenib therapy. Care should be taken when extrapolating the findings from the continued response after vemurafenib cessation to other tumour types. We recommend the collection and analysis of data to investigate the clinical responses seen after cessation of vemurafenib due to intolerable toxicities, which could help further explain vemurafenib's mechanism of action.

Tumors from patients with >14 back nevi were more likely to harbor either a BRAF mutation [age-adjusted odds ratio (OR), 3.2; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.4-7.0] or an NRAS mutation (age-adjusted OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.6-4.8) compared with patients with 0 to 4 back nevi. However, BRAF-mutant and NRAS-mutant tumors were distinctive in that BRAF-mutant tumors were characteristic of patients with high early-life ambient UV exposure (adjusted OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.2-5.3). When ambient UV irradiance was analyzed by decadal age, high exposure at ages 0 to 20 years was associated with BRAF-mutant cases, whereas high exposure at ages 50 and 60 years was characteristic of NRAS-mutant cases. Our results suggest that although nevus propensity is important for the occurrence of both BRAF and NRAS-mutant melanomas, ambient UV irradiance influences risk differently based on the age of exposure. The association of BRAF mutations with early-life UV exposure provides evidence in support of childhood sun protection for melanoma prevention.",

However, in melanoma, activating mutations in Ras are rarely observed and are limited to N-Ras in UV-exposed cells. In this study, we identify constitutively activated ERK in almost all melanoma cell lines and in tumor tissues tested, which is in contrast to normal melanocytes and several early stage radial growth phase melanoma lines where ERK can be activated by serum or growth factors. Constitutive activation of ERK is preceded by phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase and c-RAF. In all of the melanoma cell lines tested, Ras is constitutively activated without underlying mutations. On the contrary, activating mutations in the kinase domain of BRAF are present in the majority of the cell lines tested. Furthermore, ERK activation can be partially inhibited from the cell surface using inhibitors of fibroblast growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor but not interleukin 8 signaling pathways. These data suggest that melanoma growth, invasion, and metastasis are attributable to constitutively activated ERK apparently mediated by excessive growth factors through autocrine mechanisms and BRAF kinase activation.",

To better understand mechanisms underlying this acquisition of resistance to BRAF-targeted therapy in previously responsive melanomas, we induced vemurafenib resistance in two V600E BRAF+ve melanoma cell lines, A375 and DM443, by serial in vitro vemurafenib exposure. The resulting approximately 10-fold more vemurafenib-resistant cell lines, A375rVem and D443rVem, had higher growth rates and showed differential collateral resistance to cisplatin, melphalan, and temozolomide. The acquisition of vemurafenib resistance was associated with significantly increased NRAS levels in A375rVem and D443rVem, increased activation of the prosurvival protein, AKT, and the MAPKs, ERK, JNK, and P38, which correlated with decreased levels of the MAPK inhibitor protein, GSTP1. Despite the increased NRAS, whole exome sequencing showed no NRAS gene mutations. Inhibition of all three MAPKs and siRNA-mediated NRAS suppression both reversed vemurafenib resistance significantly in A375rVem and DM443rVem. Together, the results indicate a mechanism of acquired vemurafenib resistance in V600E BRAF+ve melanoma cells that involves increased activation of all three human MAPKs and the PI3K pathway, as well as increased NRAS expression, which, contrary to previous reports, was not associated with mutations in the NRAS gene. The data highlight the complexity of the acquired vemurafenib resistance phenotype and the challenge of optimizing BRAF-targeted therapy in this disease. They also suggest that targeting the MAPKs and/or NRAS may provide a strategy to mitigate such resistance in V600E BRAF+ve melanoma. ",

The unification of genotype-specific cell line data revealed the enrichment for the tyrosine-phosphorylated cytoskeletal proteins to be associated with the presence of a BRAF mutation and oncogenic NRAS to be associated with increased receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation. A number of proteins including cell cycle regulators (cyclin dependent kinase 1, cyclin dependent kinase 2, and cyclin dependent kinase 3), MAPK pathway components (Extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 and Extracellular signal regulated kinase 2), interferon regulators (tyrosine kinase-2), GTPase regulators (Ras-Rasb interactor 1), and controllers of protein tyrosine phosphorylation (dual specificity tyrosine (Y) phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A and protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type A) were common to all genotypes. Treatment of a BRAF-mutant/phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) null melanoma cell line with vemurafenib led to decreased phosphorylation of ERK, phospholipase C1, and β-catenin with increases in receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation, signal transduction and activator of signaling 3, and glycogen synthase kinase 3α noted. In NRAS-mutant melanoma, MEK inhibition led to increased phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway components, Src family kinases, and protein kinase Cδ with decreased phosphorylation seen in STAT3 and ERK1/2.

Here, we report the discovery of significant enrichment of putative PTEN ceRNAs among genes whose loss accelerates tumorigenesis following Sleeping Beauty insertional mutagenesis in a mouse model of melanoma. We validated several putative PTEN ceRNAs and further characterized one, the ZEB2 transcript. We show that ZEB2 modulates PTEN protein levels in a microRNA-dependent, protein coding-independent manner. Attenuation of ZEB2 expression activates the PI3K/AKT pathway, enhances cell transformation, and commonly occurs in human melanomas and other cancers expressing low PTEN levels. Our study genetically identifies multiple putative microRNA decoys for PTEN, validates ZEB2 mRNA as a bona fide PTEN ceRNA, and demonstrates that abrogated ZEB2 expression cooperates with BRAF(V600E) to promote melanomagenesis.",

Recombinant IL-10 and melanoma supernatants were found to inhibit production of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-2 and mixed lymphocyte reactions but reversal of these effects of melanoma supernatants by MAbs against IL-10 was only seen in the case of TNF-alpha production.

Patients were enrolled at university hospitals or private cancer centres in Europe and the USA. The three arms were: twice-daily MEK162 45 mg for NRAS-mutated melanoma, twice-daily MEK162 45 mg for BRAF-mutated melanoma, and twice-daily MEK162 60 mg for BRAF-mutated melanoma. Previous treatment with BRAF inhibitors was permitted, but previous MEK inhibitor therapy was not allowed. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who had an objective response (ie, a complete response or confirmed partial response). We report data for the 45 mg groups. We assessed clinical activity in all patients who received at least one dose of MEK162 and in patients assessable for response (with two available CT scans).

Understanding the functional impact of changes in MMP activity during cancer treatment is an important facet not typically evaluated as part of preclinical research. With MMP activity being a critical component of the metastatic cascade, we designed a 3D hydrogel system to probe whether pharmacological inhibition affected human melanoma cell proteolytic activity; metastatic melanoma is a highly aggressive and drug-resistant form of skin cancer. The relationship between MMP activity and drug treatment is unknown, and therefore we used an in situ fluorogenic MMP sensor peptide to determine how drug treatment affects melanoma cell MMP activity in three dimensions. We encapsulated melanoma cells from varying stages of progression within PEG-based hydrogels to examine the relationship between drug treatment and MMP activity. From these results, a metastatic melanoma cell line (A375) and two inhibitors that inhibit RAF (PLX4032 and sorafenib) were studied further to determine whether changes in MMP activity led to a functional change in cell behavior. A375 cells exhibited increased MMP activity despite an overall decrease in metabolic activity with PLX4032 treatment. The changes in proteolytic activity correlated with increased cell elongation and increased single-cell migration. In contrast, sorafenib did not alter MMP activity or cell motility, showing that the changes induced by PLX4032 were not a universal response to small-molecule inhibition. Therefore, we argue the importance of studying MMP activity with drug treatment and its possible implications for unwanted side effects. ",

It has been suggested that choroidal melanoma can develop due to accumulation of genetic alterations in the DNA of normal melanocytes. Neoplastic transformation in the choroid can be triggered as a consequence of the following genetic alterations: --deletions and/or amplifications in the genetic material, usually in the chromosome 3, 6, 8, 9, 11, and 18; --point mutations, especially within some egzones, which leads to monosomia or loss of heterozygosity of the chromosome. As a consequence of the above alterations a number of false codons can appear resulting in formation of defective enzymatic proteins. Some of these proteins, like p16 and p14, normally play a role of suppressors of oncogenesis and defects in their structure may result in melanoma formation.",

In this study, we performed mutation analysis of the RAS and BRAF genes in a panel of 11 uveal melanoma cell lines and 19 primary uveal melanoma tumours. In addition, Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses were performed on downstream members of the MAPK pathway in order to assess the contribution of each of these components. No mutations were found in any of the three RAS gene family members and only one cell line carried a BRAF mutation (V599E). Despite this, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK), ERK and ELK were constitutively activated in all samples.

To explore the effects of GSK2118436 on the expression patterns of CDKI (p16, p21, p27, p57), we immunohistochemically evaluated in vivo melanoma cells pre- and posttreated with GSK2118436. After GSK2118436 treatment, the melanoma cells decreased in size and demonstrated hyperchromatic nuclei and indistinct nucleoli. p16 was strongly expressed in the cytoplasm of pretreated melanoma cells and in the nucleus and cytoplasm in posttreated melanoma cells. Expression of both p27 (nucleus) and p57 (cytoplasm) was increased in posttreated melanoma cells and no significant difference in p21 expression was noted in either pre- or posttreated tumor cells. These findings may help explain the molecular mechanisms by which tumor cells retain the ability to proliferate. The persistent activation of pro-oncogenic activities of CDKI (eg, p27 and p57) and/or compartmentalization of p16 in cytoplasm or nucleus may allow tumor cells to bypass BRAF-induced senescence mechanisms. Furthermore, awareness of changes in tumor morphology after treatment with RAF inhibitors may be helpful in histologic evaluation of the spectrum of dermatologic toxicity, which may occur on targeted therapy.",

Melanocytic cells with genetic amplifications in histopathologically normal skin (field cells) were detected exclusively in the epidermis in 84% of 19 cases, with a mean extension of 6.1 mm (in situ melanomas) and 4.5 mm (invasive melanomas) beyond the histopathological margin. Genetic profiling of these field cells indicated that they represent an early phase of disease preceding melanoma in situ. The extent of field cells did not correlate with tumor depth or diameter, indicating that tumor depth is not suited to predict the extent of field cells.

Here, we report that the secretory portion (SP) of eccrine sweat glands provide an anatomical niche for melanocyte-melanoma precursor cells. Using lineage-tagged H2B-GFP reporter mice, we found that melanoblasts that colonize sweat glands during development are maintained in an immature, slow-cycling state but renew themselves in response to genomic stress and provide their differentiating progeny to the epidermis. FISH analysis of human acral melanoma expanding in the epidermis revealed that unpigmented melanoblasts with significant cyclin D1 gene amplification reside deep in the SP of particular sweat gland(s). These findings indicate that sweat glands maintain melanocyte-melanoma precursors in an immature state in the niche and explain the preferential distribution of early melanoma cells around sweat glands in human volar skin.

In this study, we investigated the potential therapeutic effects of the mitotic inhibitor paclitaxel on three melanoma cell lines with differing sensitivity to the BRAF inhibitor. Of the two BRAF inhibitor-resistant cell lines, A375P/Mdr cells harboring the BRAF V600E mutant were resistant and the wild-type BRAF SK-MEL-2 cells were sensitive to paclitaxel. In particular, paclitaxel caused the growth inhibition of SK-MEL-2 cells to a much greater extent than it caused growth inhibition of A375P cells. Paclitaxel exhibited no significant effect on the phosphorylation of MEK-ERK in any cell lines tested, regardless of both the BRAF mutation and the drug resistance, implying that paclitaxel activity is independent of MEK-ERK inhibition. In A375P cells, paclitaxel treatment resulted in a marked emergence of apoptotic cells after mitotic arrest, concomitant with a remarkable induction of p21(Cip1). However, paclitaxel only moderately increased the levels of p21(Cip1) in A375P/Mdr cells, which exhibited a strong resistance to paclitaxel. The p21(Cip1) overexpression partially conferred paclitaxel sensitivity to A375P/Mdr cells. Interestingly, we found an extremely low background expression level of p21(Cip1) in SK-MEL-2 cells lacking normal p53 function, which caused much greater G2/M arrest than that seen in A375P cells. Taken together, these results suggest that paclitaxel may be an effective anticancer agent through regulating the expression of p21(Cip1) for the treatment of BRAF mutant melanoma cells resistant to BRAF inhibitors.

The current study uses BRAFV600E expressing WM793 melanoma cells to derive data aimed at investigating the molecular determinant of cell invasion following treatment with clinical BRAF inhibitors.;Small-molecule inhibitors targeting BRAF reduced MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway activation and cell survival; yet, viable cell subpopulations persisted. The residual cells exhibited an elongated cell shape, prominent actin stress fibers and retained the ability to invade 3-D dermal-like microenvironments. BRAF inhibitor treatments were associated with reduced expression of RND3, an antagonist of RHOA activation, and elevated RHOA-dependent signaling. Restoration of RND3 expression or RHOA knockdown attenuated the migratory ability of residual cells without affecting overall cell survival. The invasive ability of BRAF inhibitor treated cells embedded in collagen gels was diminished following RND3 re-expression or RHOA depletion. Conversely, melanoma cell movement in the absence of BRAF inhibition was unaffected by RND3 expression or RHOA depletion.;These data reveal a novel switch in the requirement for RND3 and RHOA in coordinating the movement of residual WM793 cells that are initially refractive to BRAF inhibitor therapy. These results have important clinical implications because they suggest that combining BRAF inhibitors with therapies that target the invasion of drug-resistant cells could aid in controlling disease relapse.",

The most striking difference between them was the much greater abundance of SCNAs in thick melanomas, whereas mutation frequency did not significantly change between the two groups. We found novel mutations and focal SCNAs in genes that are embryonic regulators of axon guidance, predominantly in thick melanomas. Analysis of publicly available microarray datasets provided further support for a potential role of Ephrin receptors in melanoma progression. In addition, we have identified a set of SCNAs, including amplification of BRAF and ofthe epigenetic modifier EZH2, that are specific for the group of thick melanomas that developed metastasis during the follow-up.

The magnitude of this new artefact is a function of the reproducibility of routine histopathological diagnosis and the number of patients screened, and the evidence on this, and from studies done for other purposes, shows the error to be considerable. The artefact of error amplification by screening detracts from a possible role for ultraviolet radiation in the increase in melanoma incidence and provides an explanation of their erroneous association; in addition to melanoma, it could be a major source of misdiagnosis of other cancers associated with patient screening programmes.",

The significance and practical value of this procedure for the diagnosis of tumor dissemination in melanoma patients are unclear. The conflicting results may at least partially be related to very low amounts of circulating tumor cells and to our observation that melanoma cells only transiently persist in the peripheral blood. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the relevance of detection of extracellular melanoma-specific mRNA in serum and plasma samples in comparison to blood cell samples from patients with disseminated disease (stage IV). We therefore compared the presence of specific mRNA for tyrosinase, gp100, and MART-1 by RT-PCR amplification of specific cDNA from serum, plasma, and whole blood samples of 10 melanoma patients. Melanoma-specific mRNA was detectable in whole blood samples of all ten patients tested indicating the presence of circulating melanoma cells. In addition, tyrosinase mRNA could be detected in the serum and/or plasma of 6 of 10 melanoma patients whereas gp100 and MART-1 specific transcripts were not detectable in any of the samples tested. The presence and integrity of amplifiable RNA was shown in all serum and plasma samples of patients and controls by RT-PCR-specific amplification of porphobilinogen deaminase (PBDG) mRNA. We conclude that tyrosinase mRNA but not gp100 and MART-1 mRNA can be amplified from serum and/or plasma in a subset of melanoma patients showing circulating melanoma cells.

In this study, we investigated the contribution of BRAF to melanoma susceptibility, also making a comparison with frequency of CDKN2A germline mutations in MM patients from different areas in Italy.;sing a combination of denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography analysis and automated sequencing on genomic DNA from peripheral blood or tumor tissue samples, 569 MM patients (211 from northern Italy and 358 from southern Italy) were screened for BRAF mutations.;Three BRAF germline sequence variants (M116R, V599E, and G608H) were identified in four (0.7%) of 569 MM patients. The most common BRAF mutation, V599E, was detected in one germline DNA sample only; M116R and G608H were newly described mutations. A high frequency (59%) of BRAF mutations was instead observed in tumor samples from patients also undergoing germline DNA analysis; at the somatic level, substitution of valine 599 was found to account for the majority (88%) of BRAF mutations. We then estimated the germline mutation rates in BRAF and CDKN2A among 358 consecutively collected patient samples originating in southern Italy; a low (2.5%) or very low (0.29%) prevalence of CDKN2A and BRAF mutations, respectively, was detected.;utation analysis of either blood DNA from a large collection of MM patients or matched MM tissues from a subset of such patients revealed that BRAF is somatically mutated and does not play a major role in melanoma susceptibility. The present study further suggests that patient origin may account for different mutation rates in candidate genes.",

We have therefore studied the prevalence of germline 9p deletions encompassing the CDKN2 locus in melanoma pedigrees, using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Germline deletions were found in 3 of 93 UK pedigrees, with no previously identified CDKN2A mutations. A hemizygous deletion of CDKN2A exon 1beta previously reported by this group was confirmed in one family and identified in a second. Microsatellite analysis determined that these two families were ancestrally related. In the third family, a novel p16 hemizygous deletion involving CDKN2A exons 1alpha, 2, and 3 was detected. An additional 9p21 deletion reported previously in a USA melanoma-neural system tumor family was shown to involve CDKN2A exon 1beta, and not p16. The CDKN2A exon 1beta deletions provide further evidence that this tumor suppressor gene is important in melanoma-neural system tumor susceptibility, but do not exclude the possibility of a novel gene or regulatory element also being deleted in this region. Deletions at 9p21 are rare and explain only a small proportion of melanoma susceptibility. This study is the first to comprehensively exclude deletions in melanoma-prone families with no previously identified CDKN2A mutations.",

An innovative approach is virotherapy, in which viruses are engineered to infect cancer cells, resulting in tumor cell lysis and an amplification effect by viral replication and spread. Ideally, tumor selectivity of these oncolytic viruses is already determined during viral cell binding and entry, which has not been reported for melanoma. We engineered an oncolytic measles virus entering melanoma cells through the high molecular weight melanoma-associated antigen (HMWMAA) and proved highly specific infection and spread in melanoma cells. We further enhanced this oncolytic virus by inserting the FCU1 gene encoding the yeast-derived prodrug convertases cytosine deaminase and uracil phosphoribosyltransferase. Combination treatment with armed and retargeted MV-FCU1-αHMWMAA and the prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) led to effective prodrug conversion to 5-fluorouracil, extensive cytotoxicity to melanoma cells, and excessive bystander killing of noninfected cells. Importantly, HMWMAA-retargeted MV showed antitumor activity in a human xenograft mouse model, which was further increased by the FCU1/5-FC prodrug activation system. Finally, we demonstrated susceptibility of melanoma skin metastasis biopsies to HMWMAA-retargeted MV.

The tyrosinase promoter, alone and in combination with a single, or a dual, tandem melanocyte-specific enhancer, was used to regulate expression of the firefly luciferase reporter gene. Transient transfections of these tissue-specific luciferase constructs in human and murine melanoma (Pmel, B16mel) and colon carcinoma (WiDr, MC38) cell lines resulted in melanoma-specific luciferase expression that was amplified 5- and 500-fold with the addition of a single or double enhancer, respectively, to the tyrosinase promoter. When the double enhancer-promoter construct expressed the highly toxic Escherichia coli purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) gene, transfection of the same cell lines followed by administration of the prodrug 6-methyl purine deoxyriboside (6-MPDR) at a concentration of 50 microM caused melanoma-specific in vitro cell killing. Within 5 days after prodrug administration methylthiazol-tetrazolium (MTT) cytotoxicity assays showed that only 15 and 9% of Pmel and B16mel cells, respectively, remained viable compared with controls. This effect was highly specific, as 90 and 96% of WiDr and MC38 colon carcinoma cells remained viable 5 days after identical treatment. This effect was a direct result of increased tissue-specific conversion of 6-MPDR to the toxic metabolite 6-methylpurine (6-MP), as documented by HPLC analysis of culture supernatants. These results show that the dual tandem melanocyte-specific enhancer provides powerful amplification of the transcriptional targeting of gene expression afforded by use of the tyrosinase promoter.

Cytokines and transcription factors have been attributed to contribute to the loss of sensitivity towards these inhibitors. Here, we show that transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 if combined with PLX4032, a BRAF inhibitor, or GSK1120212, a MEK inhibitor, substantially increased cell death in BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines. This increase was based on the combined regulatory decrease in Twist1, an antiapoptotic protein. Overexpression or silencing of Twist1 attenuated or aggravated induction of apoptosis through PLX4032 or GSK1120212, respectively. Exposure to tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, however, led to increased Twist1 levels and oppositional decrease in cell death if exposed to PLX4032 or GSK1120212. This increase in drug resistance again depended on Twist1 levels. Our studies suggest that Twist1 as a common downstream target of multiple signalling cascades plays a crucial role in mediating drug resistance to BRAF- and MEK-targeted molecular inhibitors. ",

However, the administration of BRAFi followed by MEKi did not generate promising response rate (RR). The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the time to progression (TTP) with a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway upstream inhibition strategy in BRAF mutated melanoma patients. BRAF mutation positive metastatic melanoma patients were identified within the Dermatology Cooperative Oncology Group (DeCOG) network and were treated first with a MEKi and upon progression with a selective BRAFi. A total of 23 melanoma patients (six females, 17 males, aged 47-80 years) were retrospectively analysed for TTP. The total median TTP was 8.9 months. The median TTP for MEKi was 4.8 (1.2-23.2) and subsequent for BRAFi 4.5 (1.2-15.7) months, respectively. A higher RR for MEKi (39%, nine partial responses and 0 complete responses) than previously reported was observed. Our analysis suggests that the reversed inhibition of the MAPK pathway is feasible in BRAF mutated melanoma. The median TTP (8.9 months) is close to the promising BRAF- and MEKi combination therapy (median progression-free survival (PFS) 9.4 months). The total treatment duration of the MAPK inhibition when a MEKi is administered first is similar compared to the reversed sequence, but TTP shifts in favour to the MEKi. This approach is feasible with reasonable tolerability. This clinical investigation encourages further studies in prospective clinical trials to define the optimal treatment schedule for the MAPK pathway inhibition and should be accompanied by molecular monitoring using repeated biopsies.",

The in vitro and in vivo growth of these cells was inhibited by either reduced expression of mutant BRAF using stable retroviral RNA interference (RNAi) or retrovirus-mediated stable expression of wild-type INK4A cDNA. Consistent with the observed growth inhibition, phosphorylation of S780 and S795 in pRB, both CDK4/6 targets, was suppressed in cells expressing either mutant BRAF RNAi or wild-type INK4A. Interestingly, melanoma cells expressing mutant BRAF RNAi had increased pigmentation, produced more mature melanosomes and melanin and expressed higher levels of tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related protein-1, whereas melanogenesis was not induced by wild-type INK4A. We found that the melanocyte lineage-specific master control protein microphthalmia-associated transcription factor was upregulated by inhibition of mutant BRAF, which may be the cause for the melanogenic effect of BRAF RNAi.

Targeting BRAF is an effective therapy for advanced melanoma, but patients progress due to the development of resistance. This 'acquired resistance' is thought to be based on a minority of tumour cell populations that are resistant and will eventually re-establish tumour growth even in the presence of drug. In particular, mutations, amplifications or overexpression of genes encoding regulators of the MAPK pathway can confer this resistance, because it allows the melanoma cells to bypass inhibitor action by stimulating ERK activation through alternative routes. Furthermore, there are mechanisms that produce resistance by enhancing the tolerance of melanoma cells to the cytotoxic effects of the drug. These compensatory mechanisms can activate survival signals in the melanoma cells without reactivating ERK. Besides these cell-autonomous resistance mechanisms, stromal fibroblasts in the tumour microenvironment have been identified as a potential source of resistance, because these cells can produce growth factors that reactivate ERK through paracrine signalling. Understanding and further identifying mechanisms of resistance is crucial for the future treatment of advanced melanoma, because this can inform the design of improved therapies with more durable responses.

Distinct copy number alterations were detected, including loss or gain of whole chromosomes but also minute amplifications and homozygous deletions.

Amplifications were delineated to oncogenes such as MITF (3p14), CCND1 (11q13), MDM2 (12q15), CCNE1 (19q12) and NOTCH2 (1p12). Frequent findings of homozygous deletions on 9p21 and 10q23 confirmed the importance of CDKN2A and PTEN. Pair-wise comparisons revealed distinct sets of alterations, for example, mutually exclusive mutations in BRAF and NRAS, mutual mutations in BRAF and PTEN, concomitant chromosome 7 gain and 10 loss and concomitant chromosome 15q22.2-q26.3 gain and 20 gain.

Mutant BRAF has constitutive kinase activity and causes hyperactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. BRAF silencing induces regression of melanoma xenografts, indicating the essential role of BRAF for cell survival. We set up an inducible short hairpin RNA system to compare the role of oncogenic BRAF in thyroid carcinoma versus melanoma cells. Although BRAF knockdown led to apoptosis in the melanoma cell line A375, the anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cell ARO underwent growth arrest upon silencing, with little or no cell death. Reexpression of the thyroid differentiation marker, sodium iodide symporter, was induced after long-term silencing. The different outcome of BRAF down-regulation in the two cell lines was associated with an opposite regulation of p21(CIP1/WAF1) expression levels in response to the block of the BRAF mitogenic signal. These results were confirmed using a specific BRAF small-molecule inhibitor, PLX4032. Restoration of p21(CIP1/WAF1) expression rescued melanoma cells from death. Altogether, our data indicate that oncogenic BRAF inhibition can have a different effect on cell fate depending on the cellular type. Furthermore, we suggest that a BRAF-independent mechanism of cell survival exists in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells.",

Seventy-eight cases of CN involving SLN of PCM patients were evaluated for BRAF V600E mutation by IHC. The results were correlated with patient demographics, PCM histopathologic and molecular features, and outcome measures. Thirty-six of 78 CN cases (46%) expressed BRAF V600E mutation by IHC. Nineteen of those BRAF-positive CN cases (53%) were from patients with ≥ AJCC stage II melanoma, whereas 62% of BRAF-negative CN cases (26/42) were from stage I melanoma patients (P=.013). Twelve of the 36 (33%) BRAF-positive CN cases had metastatic melanoma involving lymph nodes, compared to 14% (6/42) of BRAF-negative CN cases (P=.061).

A high percentage of CN identified in the SLN of patients with PCM harbor BRAF V600E mutation.

This process can be inhibited using the antimalarial agent chloroquine (CQ), which impairs lysosomal function and prevents autophagosome turnover. Despite its activity, CQ is a relatively inadequate inhibitor that requires high concentrations to disrupt autophagy, highlighting the need for improved small molecules. To address this, we screened a panel of antimalarial agents for autophagy inhibition and chemically synthesized a novel series of acridine and tetrahydroacridine derivatives. Structure-activity relationship studies of the acridine ring led to the discovery of VATG-027 as a potent autophagy inhibitor with a high cytotoxicity profile. In contrast, the tetrahydroacridine VATG-032 showed remarkably little cytotoxicity while still maintaining autophagy inhibition activity, suggesting that both compounds act as autophagy inhibitors with differential effects on cell viability. Further, knockdown of autophagy-related genes showed no effect on cell viability, demonstrating that the ability to inhibit autophagy is separate from the compound cytotoxicity profiles. Next, we determined that both inhibitors function through lysosomal deacidification mechanisms and ultimately disrupt autophagosome turnover. To evaluate the genetic context in which these lysosomotropic inhibitors may be effective, they were tested in patient-derived melanoma cell lines driven by oncogenic BRAF (v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B). We discovered that both inhibitors sensitized melanoma cells to the BRAF V600E inhibitor vemurafenib.

Furthermore, loss of expression of DNA mismatch repair proteins has been associated with progression from benign to malignant disease in melanocytic neoplasms, but the presence or absence of mismatch repair defects in uveal melanomas has yet to be determined. This study was designed to establish whether MSI is a feature of these ocular melanomas. To investigate the prevalence of MSI in uveal melanomas, 52 tumours were analysed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of a panel of microsatellite markers selected for their ability to detect tumours exhibiting defects in DNA mismatch repair mechanisms. MSI was rarely detected in the 52 uveal melanomas analysed. All tumours demonstrated stable microsatellites at five of the six microsatellite markers tested (BAT26, BAT40, APC, D2S123 and Mfd15CA).

Here we use a series of melanoma cell lines that recapitulate the phenotypic characteristics of melanomas at varying stages of malignant progression to evaluate the expression levels of Id1 in this model system and determine the mechanism of Id1 dysregulation in these tumor cells. We find elevated protein levels of Id1 to be present consistently in radial growth phase tumor cells in accordance with our primary tumor data. Id1 transcript levels were also found to be elevated in these radial growth phase melanoma cells without any appreciable evidence of gene amplification and Id1 promoter activity was found to correlate with Id expression levels.

One method of staging melanoma is performed by taking a sentinel node biopsy, in which the first node in the lymphatic drainage path of the primary lesion is removed and tested for the presence of melanoma cells. Current standard of care typically involves taking fewer than ten histologic sections of the node out of the hundreds of possible sections available in the tissue. We have developed a photoacoustic method that probes the entire intact node. We acquired a lymph node from a healthy canine subject. We cultured a malignant human melanoma cell line HS 936. Approximately 1 x 10(6) cells were separated and injected into the lymph node. We also had a healthy lymph node in which no melanoma cells were implanted. We used a tunable laser system set at 532 nm to irradiate the lymph nodes. Three piezoelectric acoustic detectors were positioned near the lymph node to detect photoacoustic pulses generated within the lymph nodes. We also acquired lymph nodes from pigs and repeated the experiments with increased amplification and improved sensors. We detected photoacoustic responses from a lymph node with as few as 500 melanoma cells injected into the tissue, while normal lymph nodes showed no response. Photoacoustic generation can be used to detect melanoma micrometastasis in sentinel lymph nodes. This detection can be used to guide further histologic study of the node, increasing the accuracy of the sentinel lymph node biopsy.",

Immunomodulatory strategies initiated after progression have recently been reported to be poorly efficient. By characterizing the immunological interactions between T cells and cancer cells in clinical material as well as the influence of the FDA-approved BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib on the immune system, we aimed at unraveling new strategies to expand the efficacy of adoptive T-cell transfer, which represents one of the most promising approaches currently in clinical development for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Here we show that blocking the BRAF-MAPK pathway in BRAF signaling-addicted melanoma cells significantly increases the ability of T cells contained in clinical grade tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes to recognize autologous BRAF(V600) mutant melanoma cell lines in vitro. Antitumor reactivity was improved regardless of the class of antigen recognized by tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells. Microarray data suggests that improved tumor recognition is associated with modified expression of MHC Class I-associated proteins as well as of heat-shock proteins. In conclusion, our preclinical data suggest that an appropriately timed sequential treatment of BRAF(V600) mutant melanoma with vemurafenib and adoptive T-cell transfer might result in synergistic antineoplastic effects owing to an increased immunogenicity of cancer cells.",

MT were obtained by 6-thioguanine (TG) selection of lymphocytes from peripheral blood and tumor tissues, and wild-type T cells (WT) were obtained analogously without TG selection. cDNA sequences of the T cell receptor beta chains (TRB) were used as unambiguous biomarkers of in vivo clonality and as indicators of T cell specificity.

As an indicator of T cell specificity for melanoma, the >2600 MT and WT TRB, including the public TRB from melanoma patients, were compared to a literature-derived empirical database of >1270 TRB from melanoma-reactive T cells. Various degrees of similarity, ranging from 100% conservation to 3-amino acid motifs (3-mer), were found between both melanoma patient MT and WT TRBs and the empirical database.

A small number of studies have evaluated Spitz nevi and have failed to detect any lesions possessing a BRAF mutation. Only one study included categories of atypical Spitz nevus and borderline lesions suspected to be spitzoid melanomas, along with classic Spitz nevi and spitzoid melanomas.

Five of the 10 Spitz nevi with BRAF mutations were altered by more than usual cytologic atypia and/or architectural atypia overlapping with dysplastic nevi, or irritation/inflammation; one desmoplastic Spitz nevus had a BRAF mutation.

Activating mutations in the MAPK pathway, which includes the enzymes RAS, RAF, MEK, and ERK, result in constitutive signalling, leading to oncogenic cell proliferation and escape from apoptosis; therefore this pathway is a focus of crucial interest for the development of cancer drugs. In melanoma, the most commonly mutated gene is BRAF, with mutations usually occurring in about 50% of all tumours. The BRAF Val600Glu (V600E) mutation constitutes more than 90% of mutations in melanoma. V600E BRAF mutation shows a great dependency on MEK activity, and offers a rational therapeutic strategy for this genetically defined tumour subtype. The use of vemurafenib and dabrafenib, agents that block MAPK signaling in patients with melanoma and the BRAF V600E mutation, has been associated with prolonged survival and progression-free survival. The frequency of V600E BRAF mutation in lung adenocarcinoma is 1.5% to 2.8%. Treatment of V600E BRAF-mutant lung adenocarcinomas with dabrafenib is under evaluation in a phase 2 trial, and could represent another milestone in individualized therapy for lung cancer patients.

Our results show that tumor regression resulting from BRAF suppression is inducible, reversible, and tightly regulated in these models. Analysis of regressing tumors showed the primary mechanism of action for BRAF to be increased tumor cell proliferation and survival. In a metastatic melanoma model, conditional BRAF suppression slowed systemic tumor growth as determined by in vivo bioluminescence imaging.

        "Doc_abstract":"Cutaneous melanoma is epidemiologically linked to ultraviolet radiation (UVR), but the molecular mechanisms by which UVR drives melanomagenesis remain unclear. The most common somatic mutation in melanoma is a V600E substitution in BRAF, which is an early event. To investigate how UVR accelerates oncogenic BRAF-driven melanomagenesis, we used a BRAF(V600E) mouse model. In mice expressing BRAF(V600E) in their melanocytes, a single dose of UVR that mimicked mild sunburn in humans induced clonal expansion of the melanocytes, and repeated doses of UVR increased melanoma burden. Here we show that sunscreen (UVA superior, UVB sun protection factor (SPF) 50) delayed the onset of UVR-driven melanoma, but only provided partial protection. The UVR-exposed tumours showed increased numbers of single nucleotide variants and we observed mutations (H39Y, S124F, R245C, R270C, C272G) in the Trp53 tumour suppressor in approximately 40% of cases. TP53 is an accepted UVR target in human non-melanoma skin cancer, but is not thought to have a major role in melanoma. However, we show that, in mice, mutant Trp53 accelerated BRAF(V600E)-driven melanomagenesis, and that TP53 mutations are linked to evidence of UVR-induced DNA damage in human melanoma. Thus, we provide mechanistic insight into epidemiological data linking UVR to acquired naevi in humans. Furthermore, we identify TP53/Trp53 as a UVR-target gene that cooperates with BRAF(V600E) to induce melanoma, providing molecular insight into how UVR accelerates melanomagenesis. Our study validates public health campaigns that promote sunscreen protection for individuals at risk of melanoma. ",

This goal is best facilitated by understanding both an individual's inherited genetic variation and the somatic genetic changes arising during cancer development. Clinical decision making based on inherited genetic variation is done for those patients with cancer susceptibility syndromes and more generally to personalize drug dosing. Personalized medicine based on genetic and genomic changes within tumors is being applied more widely, with increased use of therapies targeted to somatic mutations and amplifications. Somatic mutations associated with resistance also are being used to select against therapies. Somatic point mutation testing being used clinically includes direct sequencing, short sequencing and single nucleotide interrogation. Single amplifications are commonly assessed using FISH or CISH; high throughput assessment of amplifications and deletions is done mainly on a research basis. Melanomas contain complex mutational profiles that allow them to be sub-grouped by their genetic and genomic profile, each of which then can be evaluated pre-clinically to determine their response to targeted therapies. BRAF V600E mutations are the most common found in melanoma; specific inhibitors of mutant BRAF have been developed and are currently in clinical trials. In addition, other melanoma sub-groups have been identified genetically, which respond to other inhibitors. These studies focus on somatic genetic changes in cancer, which can be targeted directly by therapies. However in the future, personalized medicine will use a combination of inherited and somatic genetics to select the optimal tailored therapy for each patient.",

Accordingly, we investigated the effect of BRAF and NRAS oncogenic mutation on the response to the stimulation and inhibition of epidermal and fibroblast growth factor receptors in melanoma cells. In the three BRAF mutant, two NRAS mutant and two double wild-type cell lines growth factor receptor expression had been verified by qRT-PCR. Cell proliferation and migration were determined by the analysis of 3-days-long time-lapse videomicroscopic recordings. Of note, a more profound response was found in motility as compared to proliferation and double wild-type cells displayed a higher sensitivity to EGF and FGF2 treatment when compared to mutant cells. Both baseline and induced activation of the growth factor signaling was assessed by immunoblot analysis of the phosphorylation of the downstream effectors Erk1/2. Low baseline and higher inducibility of the signaling pathway was characteristic in double wild-type cells. In contrast, oncogenic BRAF or NRAS mutation did not influence the response to EGF or FGF receptor inhibitors in vitro. Our findings demonstrate that the oncogenic mutations in melanoma have a profound impact on the motogenic effect of the activation of growth factor receptor signaling. Since emerging molecularly targeted therapies aim at the growth factor receptor signaling, the appropriate mutational analysis of individual melanoma cases is essential in both preclinical studies and in the clinical trials and practice.

In cell lines, (V600E)B-RAF overexpression and knockdown conferred B-RAF inhibitor resistance and sensitivity, respectively. In (V600E)B-RAF amplification-driven (versus mutant N-RAS-driven) B-RAF inhibitor resistance, extracellular signal-regulated kinase reactivation is saturable, with higher doses of vemurafenib down-regulating phosho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase and re-sensitizing melanoma cells to B-RAF inhibitor. These two mechanisms of extracellular signal-regulated kinase reactivation are sensitive to the MEK1/2 inhibitor AZD6244/selumetinib or its combination with the B-RAF inhibitor vemurafenib. In contrast to mutant N-RAS-mediated (V600E)B-RAF bypass, which is sensitive to C-RAF knockdown, (V600E)B-RAF amplification-mediated resistance functions largely independently of C-RAF.

Coexistence of a TERT promoter and BRAF mutation was detected in 11 of 53 cases (21 %). This was associated with increasing thickness, high mitotic rate, lymph node metastasis, presence of ulceration, and absence of regression. Coexistence of a mutation in the TERT promoter and in the BRAF gene correlated with more prognostically relevant factors than either mutation alone.

We suggest a possible role for this marker in the monitoring of melanoma patients after the excision of regional lymph node metastases, and provide evidence that tyrosinase is related to the status of disease in advanced metastatic patients.

We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) and whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) on pretreatment and drug-resistant tumors from five patients with acquired resistance to dabrafenib/trametinib. In three of these patients, we identified additional mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway alterations in the resistant tumor that were not detected in the pretreatment tumor, including a novel activating mutation in MEK2 (MEK2(Q60P)). MEK2(Q60P) conferred resistance to combined RAF/MEK inhibition in vitro, but remained sensitive to inhibition of the downstream kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK).

We show that low levels of endogenous MITF activity are oncogenic with BRAF(V600E) to promote melanoma that reflects the pathology of the human disease. Remarkably, abrogating MITF activity in BRAF(V600E)mitf melanoma leads to dramatic tumor regression marked by melanophage infiltration and increased apoptosis.

A decision tree was mainly employed for determining the importance of molecular descriptors (n=46). The value of majority of these descriptors for each analogue in the dataset was computed using E-Dragon software (version 1.0). The decision tree learned the information from the input data with an accuracy of 98% and correctly predicted the cross-validated (10-fold) data with accuracy up to 79%. A total of three non-correlating descriptors, identified best by the decision tree analysis, were subsequently utilized for development of suitable models using moving average analysis. These proposed models resulted in the prediction of (V)600(E)BRAF inhibitory activity (IC50) and melanoma cells growth (SRB GI50) inhibitory activity with an overall accuracy of ≥90%.

However, some cancer cell types including malignant melanoma cells are resistant             to TRAIL cytotoxicity. Here, we show that diallyl trisulfide (DATS), a garlic             organosulfur compound, sensitizes melanoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis while             sparing normal cells. DATS also potentiates apoptosis induced by agonistic antibodies             against death receptors (DR) 4 and DR5. The amplification of DR-mediated apoptosis             was associated with increased mitochondrial membrane potential collapse and caspase-3/7             activation. However, these events were not sufficient for full sensitization.             TRAIL also induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, as indicated by the activation             of X-box-binding protein 1 and caspase-12 and DATS poten-tiated both events. Moreover,             inhibition of caspase-12, but not caspase-4, abolished the amplification of apoptosis,             indicating that ER stress plays a crucial role. On the other hand, DATS and/or             TRAIL induced minimal apoptosis and caspase-12 activation in melanocytes despite             their substantial expression of DR4 and DR5 on the cell surface. Our data suggest             that DATS amplifies death ligand-induced melanoma cell death by disrupting their             adaptation to ER-mediated death pathway.

We previously sequenced 24 cancer genes in those cell lines. Eleven of the genes were found to be mutated in three or more of the lines. Using a pharmacogenomic approach, we analyzed the relationship between drug activity and mutations in those 11 genes (APC, RB1, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, PTEN, STK11, MADH4, TP53, and CDKN2A). That analysis identified an association between mutation in BRAF and the antiproliferative potential of phenothiazine compounds. Phenothiazines have been used as antipsychotics and as adjunct antiemetics during cancer chemotherapy and more recently have been reported to have anticancer properties. However, to date, the anticancer mechanism of action of phenothiazines has not been elucidated. To follow up on the initial pharmacologic observations in the NCI-60 screen, we did pharmacologic experiments on 11 of the NCI-60 cell lines and, prospectively, on an additional 24 lines. The studies provide evidence that BRAF mutation (codon 600) in melanoma as opposed to RAS mutation is predictive of an increase in sensitivity to phenothiazines as determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt assay (Wilcoxon P = 0.007). That pattern of increased sensitivity to phenothiazines based on the presence of codon 600 BRAF mutation may be unique to melanomas, as we do not observe it in a panel of colorectal cancers.

EGFR mRNA levels were detected by Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 expression arrays for 16 lesions. Both increased gene dosage and chromosome 7 alterations were found in 70% of tumors.

Significant correlation was found between EGFR alterations and histological subtypes, tumor thickness, ulceration and metastases formation. Amplification was significantly higher in lesions that developed metastases within 2 years after surgical excision of the primary tumor. Gene copy alterations were associated with elevated mRNA expression in 77% of lesions when compared to tumors with disomic EGFR status, the correlation was not directly proportional to gene copy number. Associations between protein expression and mRNA levels were even less prominent.

Four hundred and eighteen blood samples from 60 melanoma patients were analysed. The median follow-up time calculated from the time of inclusion in the study was 23 months (range 2-38 months).

Patients who seroconverted to a negative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction after induction treatment had a significantly lower probability of recurrence. The presence of circulating melanoma cells is a marker of a high relapse risk and shorter disease-free survival whether detected postoperatively or during follow-up.

We therefore examined the expression and mutations of KIT in 4 primary and 24 metastatic acral and mucosal melanomas. Immunohistochemistry revealed moderate or strong KIT protein expression in 13 (48%) tumors. Sequence analysis revealed K642E and D820Y mutations in two metastases. Amplification of KIT was identified by real-time PCR in 4 tumors, including one that had K642E. Western blot analysis showed phosphorylation of the KIT receptor in 8 (62%) of 13 cryopreserved samples, indicating the frequent pathological activation of the receptor in vivo. Phosphorylation of KIT protein was detected in 2 tumors harboring KIT mutations, as well as in one tumor with KIT gene amplification. Furthermore, 5 tumors without detectable KIT gene aberrations showed phosphorylation of the KIT receptor. Expression of stem cell factor (SCF) in melanoma cells as well as stromal cells suggests SCF/KIT autocrine and paracrine activation in these tumors. Finally, we found significant growth suppressive effects of sunitinib in two acral melanoma cell lines; one harboring the D820Y mutation and one showing SCF-dependent KIT activation. These results show pathological activation of KIT in a substantial number of metastatic tumors of acral and mucosal melanomas, and suggest a potential therapeutic benefit of sunitinib for these melanomas.",

Given the known difficulty in recognizing a small dermal blue nevus-like melanoma metastasis by light microscopic findings alone, recent discoveries of unique cytogenetic aberrations in various types of melanomas have led pathologists to explore cytogenetic techniques as an ancillary diagnostic tool. Herein, we report a case of a 58-year-old man with a history of uveal melanoma, in which fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis for monosomy 3 helped confirm a diagnosis of blue nevus-like uveal melanoma metastasis. The patient had presented clinically with a new small 1-mm dark blue-gray macule on the forehead. Histopathologically, a small dermal nodule of pigmented epithelioid melanocytes and melanophages was found with a rare mitotic figure. The pathologist's suspicion of a blue nevus-like melanoma metastasis was confirmed by FISH analysis: both the tumor cells of the patient's prior uveal melanoma and the melanocytes of the new dermal blue nevus-like nodule carried only one copy of chromosome 3. Furthermore, deletion of 1p36 and amplifications of 8q32 were also identified.",

A number of methods are currently available to determine mutation status. Recently, a monoclonal antibody (VE1) against mutant BRAF(V600E) was generated. Its use permits assessment of the mutant protein expression throughout a tumor sample and may allow faster and cheaper determination of the mutation status in selected cases. However, for BRAF(V600E) protein expression analysis to be of clinical value, high sensitivity and specificity of the antibody is a prerequisite. In this study we analyzed 44 metastatic melanoma samples with a known BRAF(V600E) mutation status with immunohistochemical expression of the BRAF(V600E) protein. None of the 22 tumors that lacked the BRAF(V600E) mutation labeled with the antibody VE1. This set of VE1-immunonegative tumors included 4 metastatic lesions with the BRAF(V600E) mutation. All 22 tumor samples that were known to carry the BRAF mutation were immunoreactive with VE1. Sixteen of them stained strongly and homogenously throughout the tumor sample. However, 6 tumor samples contained both BRAF(V600E)-immunopositive and BRAF(V600E)-immunonegative cell populations. When the BRAF status was compared with immunoreactivity for melanocyte differentiation antigens, no significant difference in the expression of melan-A, microphthalmia transcription factor, gp100, or tyrosinase was found between mutant and wild-type tumors. In addition to metastatic lesions, we also examined 20 primary melanomas for the expression of BRAF(V600E). Seven of 10 superficial spreading melanomas were immunoreactive with the antibody VE1. Five tumors were strongly and homogenously immunoreactive. In 2 primary tumors the staining was focal, involving only a subpopulation of the tumor. None of the nonsuperficial spreading melanomas was immunoreactive. In 7 primary tumors the mutation status could be analyzed: only tumors carrying the BRAF(V600E) mutation were immunoreactive with VE1. The high specificity and sensitivity of VE1 for the detection of mutant BRAF(V600E) suggests a valuable reagent for clinical purposes. Heterogeneity in BRAF expression may be relevant for treatment response to BRAF inhibitors.",

The p16(INK4a)-Cyclin D-CDK4/6-pRb pathway is dysregulated in 90% of melanomas. CDK4/Cyclin D kinase hyperactivation, associated with mutation of CDK4, amplification of Cyclin D or loss of p16(INK4a) leads to increased risk of developing melanoma. This kinase therefore constitutes a key biomarker in melanoma and an emerging pharmacological target, however there are no tools enabling direct detection or quantification of its activity. Here we report on the design and application of a fluorescent peptide biosensor to quantify CDK4 activity in melanoma cell extracts, skin biopsies and melanoma xenografts. This biosensor provides sensitive means of comparing CDK4 activity between different melanoma cell lines and further responds to CDK4 downregulation by siRNA or small-molecule inhibitors. By affording means of monitoring CDK4 hyperactivity consequent to cancer-associated molecular alterations in upstream signaling pathways that converge upon this kinase, this biosensor offers an alternative to immunological identification of melanoma-specific biomarkers, thereby constituting an attractive tool for diagnostic purposes, providing complementary functional information to histological analysis, of particular utility for detection of melanoma onset in precancerous lesions. This is indeed the first fluorescent peptide biosensor which has been successfully implemented to monitor kinase activity in skin samples and melanoma tumour xenografts. Moreover by enabling to monitor response to CDK4 inhibitors, this biosensor constitutes an attractive companion assay to identify compounds of therapeutic relevance for melanoma. ",

In 68 families with increased hereditary susceptibility to malignant melanoma, we previously reported a low frequency of alterations in the CDKN2A gene, which is regarded as the major melanoma predisposition gene. Among these alterations, we identified a novel mutation in 3 families (Asp108Tyr). In the present study, we focused on the possible role of heritable epimutations as a cause of the silencing of the CDKN2A gene. We used two different technical approaches to detect changes in CpG methylation in the promoter region of the CDKN2A gene; methylation-specific PCR (MSP) analysis of bisulfite-converted DNA and methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA). From families who tested negative for germ-line CDKN2A mutations, 64 unrelated patients with hereditary melanoma were included in the study. We showed a consistent lack of hypermethylation in the promoter region of CDKN2A in patients with HMM in our western Swedish population. A putative germ-line methylation of the CDKN2A, if any, is therefore likely to be a rare event in hereditary melanoma.

Recently, a new technique for the high-resolution analysis of copy number changes named digital karyotyping was introduced. This approach is derived from SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) and allows the detection of genomic amplifications and deletions, which are indicative of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Four human melanoma cell lines were subjected to analysis by digital karyotyping. 828,780 genomic tags were generated and analyzed quantitatively. Thereby, we identified a somatic, homozygous deletion of 570 kbp removing exons 3-29 of the dystrophin (DMD, Duchenne muscular dystrophy) gene. Analysis of 51 melanoma cell lines further revealed a homozygous and a hemizygous deletion in DMD. Furthermore, DMD mRNA expression was downregulated with respect to primary melanocytes and accompanied by loss of dystrophin protein expression in 38 of 55 (69%) and significantly reduced in 10 of 55 (18%) melanoma cell lines. Sequence analysis of DMD cDNAs in 37 melanoma cell lines revealed six new sequence variants with a significantly lower frequency than previously described DMD polymorphisms, which may affect dystrophin function. Knock-down of DMD enhanced migration and invasion, whereas re-expression of DMD attenuated migration and induced a senescent phenotype in melanoma cell lines. Therefore, loss of DMD may critically change the migratory and proliferative capacity of melanocytes.

Consequently, BRAF inhibitors have been developed as treatment options for cancers with BRAF mutations which have shown some success in improving patient outcomes in clinical trials. Development of resistance to BRAF kinase inhibitors is common, however, overcoming this resistance is an area of significant concern for clinicians, patients and researchers alike. In this review, we identify the mechanisms of BRAF kinase inhibitor resistance and discuss the implications for strategies to overcome this resistance in the context of new approaches such as multi-kinase targeted therapies and emerging RNA interference based technologies.

Initial studies have shown that BRAF mutations occur at a high frequency in melanocytic nevi and metastatic lesions, but recent data have revealed much lower incidence of these mutations in early-stage melanoma, implying that other factors may contribute to melanoma pathogenesis in a wild-type (WT) BRAF context. To identify such contributing factors, we used microarray gene expression profiling to screen for differences in gene expression between a panel of melanocytic and melanoma cell lines with WT BRAF and a group of melanoma cell lines with the V599E BRAF mutation. We found that SPRY2, an inhibitor homologous to SPRY4, which was previously shown to suppress Ras/ERK signaling via direct binding to Raf-1, had reduced expression in WT BRAF cells. Using small interfering RNA-mediated SPRY2 knockdown, we showed that SPRY2 acts as an inhibitor of ERK signaling in melanocytes and WT BRAF melanoma cells, but not in cell lines with the V599E mutation. We also show that SPRY2 and SPRY4 directly bind WT BRAF but not the V599E and other exon 15 BRAF mutants. These data suggest that SPRY2, an inhibitor of ERK signaling, may be bypassed in melanoma cells either by down-regulation of its expression in WT BRAF cells, or by the presence of the BRAF mutation.",

The TCR variable (V) genes, joining (J) segments, and N diversity regions used by five clonal lines and one highly oligoclonal, melanoma-specific, CD8+ TIL line were examined utilizing PCR amplification with V gene subfamily-specific primers and anchor PCR. The TIL lysed multiple allogeneic melanomas expressing matched surface major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. TCR analysis confirmed the clonal nature of the TIL lines; however, the TCR repertoire was diverse. Even among the three HLA-A2 restricted TIL (TIL 1200, TIL F2-2, and TIL-5), no common V gene usage was found. Comparison of the third complementarity-determining regions of the TCRs from the HLA-A2 restricted TIL revealed no homology. Results presented here identify T-cell clonotypes that recognize epitopes on highly prevalent, shared melanoma tumor-associated antigens presented in the context of HLA-B55, HLA-A1, and HLA-A2.

Dual BRAF/MEK inhibition is known to lower the incidence of such manifestations, but it is not known whether it can counteract established lesions. Here we show, for the first time, a dramatic response and a restitution ad integro upon dual inhibition of a widespread proliferative affection induced by BRAF monotherapy. A 75-year-old woman was diagnosed with a BRAF V600E mutated metastatic melanoma. Following dacarbazine (DTIC) and ipilimumab, the patient was started on 960 mg twice daily vemurafenib (Zelboraf), which resulted in complete response, but the patient also developed grade IV skin toxicity. Despite dose-reduction to 720 mg twice daily the side effects persisted. We hypothesized that a switch to double inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway with dabrafenib and trametinib could lead to improvement of the skin lesions, while preserving tumor control. The patient was closely followed for changes in skin lesions. We witnessed a rapid regression followed by complete disappearance of all side effects of vemurafenib except for grade I fatigue. The biopsied skin lesions show regression of established keratoacanthoma-like lesions with signs of apoptosis. Switching from the current standard of care vemurafenib therapy to the double BRAF/MEK inhibition in BRAF mutant melanoma patients results in rapid disappearance of established proliferative skin disorders.",

In cancer EZH2 has been implicated in silencing tumor suppressor genes. Its role in melanoma as well as target genes affected by EZH2 are poorly understood. In view of this we have used an integrated systems biology approach to analyze 471 cases of skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for mutations and amplifications of EZH2. Identified changes in target genes were validated by interrogation of microarray data from melanoma cells treated with the EZH2 inhibitor GSK126. We found that EZH2 activation by mutations, gene amplification and increased transcription occurred in about 20% of the cohort. These alterations were associated with significant hypermethylation of DNA and significant downregulation of 11% of transcripts in patient RNASeq data. GSK126 treatment of melanoma lines containing EZH2 activation reversed such transcriptional repression in 98 candidate target genes. Gene enrichment analysis revealed genes associated with tumor suppression, cell differentiation, cell cycle inhibition and repression of metastases as well as antigen processing and presentation pathways. The identified changes in EZH2 were associated with an adverse prognosis in the TCGA dataset. These results suggest that inhibiting of EZH2 is a promising therapeutic avenue for a substantial fraction of melanoma patients. ",

However, transactivation of the mouse fibroblast tyrosinase gene was unstable in microcell hybrid subclones and possibly dependent on a second fibroblast locus that could have segregated in the subclones. This second locus was not necessary for transactivation of the fibroblast b-locus gene, thus demonstrating noncoordinate transactivation of fibroblast tyrosinase and b-locus genes.

Potentially, BRAF mutation analysis of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsies could enhance the detection of micrometastases and improve the accuracy of nodal staging for patients with melanoma. Nodal nevi are small aggregates of benign nevus cells that are commonly encountered in the SLNs of patients with melanoma. The status of the BRAF gene in nodal nevi is not known, but this unresolved issue is of critical importance to any future detection strategies that use genetic alterations as biomarkers of metastatic spread. Twenty-six nodal nevi from 26 patients were evaluated for the thymine (T)-->adenine (A) missense mutation at nucleotide 1796 of the BRAF gene using the LigAmp assay, which can detect 1 mutant allele among 10,000 wild-type alleles. For each case, a matching volume of adjacent lymphoid tissue was used as a negative control. BRAF mutations were detected in 13 of the 26 nodal nevi, but in just 1 of the 26 adjacent controls (50% vs. 4%, P<0.0005, Fisher exact). Novel strategies that rely on detection of putative melanoma-specific markers for the diagnosis of micrometastatic melanoma in SLNs need to take into account the molecular genetic profile of the benign nodal nevus.

Formation of B78H1-transfectant colonies expressing a surface Ag reactive with mAb CL203.4 in an immunorosetting assay was dependent on addition of chromosomal DNA from human melanoma cells [primary (1 degree) transfer] or from Ag-expressing transfectant cells (2 degrees, 3 degrees, 4 degrees transfer). The mAb CL203.4-reactive species expressed by the transfectant cells is a glycoprotein with a molecular mass 93-kDa, within the range of 93 to 96-kDa observed for the endogenous human Ag. In the presence of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, both mouse melanoma transfectants and human melanoma cells express a 50- to 51-kDa antigenic species. Human alu family repeat sequences (h-alu) are present in the genomes of 3 degrees transfectant cells. Continued presence of these h-alu after dilution of extraneous human DNA by three cycles of transfection suggests their association with the transferred 96-kDa MAA gene.

Sixty-nine percent of stage III patients and none of stage I patients were found to have circulating melanocytes.;Our study suggests that melanoma cells could circulate transiently after lymph node dissection.

The CDKN2A locus consists of four exons and encodes several alternate transcripts, two of which are p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF), and originate from different open reading frames. Exon 1alpha is specific for p16(INK4a), while exon 1beta characterizes p14(ARF). Most CDKN2A mutations are located in exons 1alpha and 2, while exon 1beta variations have been identified in rare melanoma-prone pedigrees. In a previous study, we investigated 155 Italian melanoma cases, including 94 familial melanomas (FAMs) and 61 sporadic multiple primary melanomas (MPMs), for p16(INK4a)/CDK4 germline alterations and identified 15 p16(INK4a) and 1 CDK4 point mutations. In the present work, we extended our search to p14(ARF) mutations and CDKN2A deletions in the remaining samples. We identified the recurrent g.193+1G> A mutation in two FAM cases, while an additional pedigree displayed the previously undescribed variant g.161G> A. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) screening for copy variations resulted negative in all cases. In Italy, the overall frequency of p14(ARF) mutations is 3.2% in FAM and 0% in sporadic MPM. Re-evaluation of our patients' cohort emphasizes that the chance of identifying CDKN2A/CDK4 mutations in FAM is mainly influenced by the number of affected family members and the presence of one or more MPM cases. Accordingly, mutation rate rises to 61% in selected cases. Further studies are expected in order to investigate CDKN2A rarer mutations, including atypical deletions and inherited epimutations.",

We investigated formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples with variable challenging interpretative attributes: metastases, core needle biopsies, sample tissues less than 60 mm(2), samples with greater than 50% necrosis, and/or samples with greater than 10% melanin pigmentation. Three pathologists independently scored 122 BRAF V600E IHC-labeled melanoma samples for percentage (0%-100%) of staining intensity (0-3+). Interscorer BRAF IHC discrepancies were resolved by consensus review. Lenient (≥1+, >0%) and stringent (≥2+, ≥10%) IHC scoring criteria were compared to BRAF V600 mutation (cobas) results (n = 118). Specimens with greater than 10% melanin pigmentation and metastatic samples produced the majority of interobserver IHC and IHC/cobas scoring discrepancies. Consensus review using stringent scoring criteria decreased the number of discrepant results, yielded very good interobserver reproducibility, and improved specificity and positive predictive value for BRAF p.V600E detection. BRAF p.V600K mutations accounted for 57.1% of false-negative IHC results when stringent, consensus criteria scoring were used. The cobas test detected 75.0% (8/12) of BRAF IHC-negative BRAF p.V600K mutations confirmed by next-generation sequencing. Molecular BRAF testing is the preferred screening test for BRAF inhibitor therapy eligibility because of superior sensitivity in challenging interpretative melanoma specimens. However, BRAF V600E IHC has excellent specificity and positive predictive value when stringent, consensus scoring criteria are implemented. To decrease IHC scoring discrepancies, pathologists should interpret metastatic and pigmented samples with caution. ",

The significance and practical value of these procedures for the diagnosis of tumor dissemination in melanoma patients is, however, still unclear. We analyzed peripheral blood samples of melanoma patients of different clinical stages for the presence of tyrosinase mRNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In addition to a nested RT-PCR-based system, we evaluated the new PCR enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tyrosinase system for sensitivity and specificity in detecting circulating melanoma cells. Our results showed a high sensitivity and specificity for this system in detecting one melanoma cell in 1 ml of whole blood. Using different methods of detection, no tyrosinase mRNA was detectable in blood samples of patients with primary melanoma and regional lymph node metastases. In a small number of patients with visceral metastases (10-30%), we found tyrosinase mRNA-positive results. Analyses of different blood samples taken at 2-h intervals indicate that tumor cells persist only transiently in the peripheral blood. Successful establishment of melanoma cell growth from tyrosinase mRNA-positive samples indicates that viable tumor cells exist in melanoma patients' peripheral blood. Our results indicate a low amount of tyrosinase-specific transcripts in a small subset of stage IV patients and suggest that the analysis of tyrosinase mRNA in peripheral blood samples is not helpful as a prognostic marker or monitoring tool in melanoma patients.",

AZD6244 is a selective MEK1/2 inhibitor that markedly reduces tumor P-MAPK levels, but it produces few clinical responses in melanoma patients. An improved understanding of the determinants of resistance to AZD6244 may lead to improved patient selection and effective combinatorial approaches. The effects of AZD6244 on cell growth and survival were tested in a total of 14 Braf-mutant and 3 wild-type human cutaneous melanoma cell lines. Quantitative assessment of phospho-protein levels in the Braf-mutant cell lines by reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis showed no significant association between P-MEK or P-MAPK levels and AZD6244 sensitivity, but activation-specific markers in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway correlated with resistance. We also identified resistant cell lines without basal activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway. RPPA characterization of the time-dependent changes in signaling pathways revealed that AZD6244 produced durable and potent inhibition of P-MAPK in sensitive and resistant Braf-mutant cell lines, but several resistant lines showed AZD6244-induced activation of AKT. In contrast, sensitive cell lines showed AZD6244 treatment-induced upregulation of PTEN protein and mRNA expression. Inhibition of AKT, TORC1/2, or insulin-like growth factor I receptor blocked AZD6244-induced activation of AKT and resulted in synergistic cell killing with AZD6244. These findings identify basal and treatment-induced regulation of the PI3K-AKT pathway as a critical regulator of AZD6244 sensitivity in Braf-mutant cutaneous melanoma cells and the novel regulation of PTEN expression by AZD6244 in sensitive cells, and suggest new combinatorial approaches for patients.",

Evidences suggested that this resistance mechanism is part of a more complex cellular adaptation process. Using an integrative strategy, we found this mechanism to invoke extensive transcriptomic, (phospho-) proteomic and phenotypic alterations that accompany a cellular transition to a de-differentiated, mesenchymal and invasive state. Even short-term BRAF-inhibitor exposure leads to an early adaptive, differentiation state change-characterized by a slow-cycling, persistent state. The early persistent state is distinct from the late proliferative, resistant state. However, both differentiation states share common signaling alterations including JUN upregulation. Motivated by the similarities, we found that co-targeting of BRAF and JUN is synergistic in killing fully resistant cells; and when used up-front, co-targeting substantially impairs the formation of the persistent subpopulation. We confirmed that JUN upregulation is a common response to BRAF inhibitor treatment in clinically treated patient tumors. Our findings demonstrate that events shared between early- and late-adaptation states provide candidate up-front co-treatment targets. ",

These alterations are of prognostic relevance and have also be shown to correlate to high risk and low risk metastatic categories of uveal melanoma as defined by micro-array analysis. It is, however, possible that a catalogue of relevant genetic alterations, involving gene rearrangement rather than amplification, have as yet eluded identification. To address this point we examined 14 primary uveal melanomas, using 24 colour multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH). All tumours were karyotyped following G-Banding, and M-FISH was performed to confirm and clarify the identity of abnormal chromosomes. M-FISH data were obtained from all tumours and was able to establish the nature of most abnormalities not fully characterized by cytogenetics. Abnormalities of chromosome 6 were far more frequent than previously indicated, in approximately 70% of cases, indicating they have been substantially underrepresented in past studies of uveal melanoma. Spindle melanomas were found to have novel rearrangements affecting in particular chromosomes 6, 15 and 18, suggesting that juxtaposition of genes through translocational events may play a role in the development of some uveal melanomas. In conclusion, this study is the largest of primary uveal melanoma analysed by M-FISH and indicates that alterations of chromosome 6 have previously been underestimated. Furthermore spindle melanomas are prone to rearrangements affecting chromosomes 6, 15 and 18, which may relate to early changes in uveal melanoma development or associate with those melanomas of a more differentiated status.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Activating BRAF mutations, leading to constitutive activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, are common in a variety of human cancers. Several small molecule BRAF inhibitors have been developed during the last years and shown promising results in clinical trials, especially for metastatic melanoma, while they have been less effective in colon cancer. Two inhibitors, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, have been approved for treatment of melanoma. Unfortunately, in most patients who initially respond the tumors eventually develop acquired resistance to the BRAF inhibitors. So far, a number of resistance mechanisms have been identified, including secondary NRAS mutations and BRAF alternative splicing, leading to reactivation of the MAPK pathway. Other alterations, both upstream and downstream of BRAF can have the same effect, and activation of alternative pathways can also play a role in resistance to BRAF inhibitors. In addition, intra-tumor heterogeneity with the presence of clones of tumor cells lacking BRAF mutations needs to be considered, since wildtype BRAF can be activated by inhibitors designed to target mutated BRAF. Combination of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib with the MEK inhibitor trametinib has significantly prolonged progression free survival compared to dabrafenib alone in metastatic melanoma. Combination treatments of BRAF inhibitors with other agents may not only circumvent or delay resistance, but may also lead to fewer side effects, such as development of secondary squamous tumors. Several clinical trials are underway for many different BRAF mutation positive cancers with BRAF inhibitors alone or in combination with other small molecule inhibitors, immunotherapies or conventional chemotherapy.

The PFS hazard ratio (HR) (selumetinib:placebo) was 0.75 [90% confidence interval (CI) 0.50-1.14; P = 0.130], with a median PFS of 4.23 months (90% CI 3.63-6.90) for docetaxel plus selumetinib and 3.93 months (90% CI 2.07-4.16) for docetaxel alone. There was no significant difference in overall survival. The objective response rate was 32% with selumetinib versus 14% with placebo (P = 0.059). In a retrospective subset analysis, NRAS mutation status did not affect significantly upon clinical outcomes in either arm. The combination of docetaxel and selumetinib could be administered effectively to patients with metastatic melanoma, although the combination was less well tolerated than docetaxel alone.;The combination of docetaxel with selumetinib showed no significant improvement in PFS compared with docetaxel alone, although more patients showed a response to combination therapy. We found no evidence to support using tumour NRAS mutation as a basis for selecting patients for combined MEK inhibitor and chemotherapy.;DOC-MEK (EudraCT no: 2009-018153-23).",

However, the duration of responses is limited in a majority of these patients, with progression-free survival rates around 6 months due to tumor progression from development of acquired resistance. Preclinical studies have suggested that concurrent inhibition of the BRAF kinases and MEK of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway could decrease MAPK-driven acquired resistance, resulting in longer duration of responses, higher rate of tumor responses, and a decrease in the cutaneous toxicities observed from paradoxical MAPK pathway activation with BRAF inhibitor monotherapy.

Exp. Metastasis 16 (1998) 299]. These hybrids, derived from the same parental fusion partners, represent a unique genetically matched model for analyzing differential gene expression regulating the metastatic phenotype. We have examined the differences in gene expression in metastatic fusion hybrid compared to its parental partners, non-/poorly metastatic melanoma cells and normal macrophages. An approach by selective polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and display of 3' end restriction fragments of double-stranded cDNAs was used [Methods Enzymol. 303 (1999) 272]. Gene expression analyses showed an extensive set of transcripts that were up- or down-regulated in the most metastatic hybrid, H95-1, compared to the parental macrophages or melanoma cells. Sequence analyses of more than 60 of these differentially expressed cDNAs revealed significant up- or down-regulation of a number of genes known to be associated with metastasis of melanoma and other solid tumors. Some genes are found to express exclusively either in normal macrophages or in melanoma. Thirteen fragment sequences were found with no matches with GenBank search. Comparison of these gene expression patterns should be of great value in understanding the coordinate programs regulating metastasis. Further, the increased expression of gene(s) common in macrophage and fusion hybrids may be of importance in identifying the regulatory factor(s) related to macrophage-like trait, motility, a critical step of metastatic processes, in hybrids.",

Does Spitz naevus progress into spitzoid melanoma? Are ambiguous spitzoid tumours genuine entities?;BRAF, NRAS and HRAS mutations were analysed using single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis and sequencing.;Both Spitz naevi and spitzoid melanoma had a lower combined BRAF and NRAS mutation frequency compared with common acquired naevi (P = 0.0001) and common forms of melanoma (P = 0.0072), respectively. To look for evidence of progression from Spitz naevi to spitzoid melanoma, HRAS was analysed in 21 spitzoid melanomas, with no mutations identified. The binomial probability of this was 0.03 based on an assumption of a 15% mutation frequency in Spitz naevi with unbiased progression. Under these assumptions, HRAS mutations must be rare/absent in spitzoid melanoma. Thus, Spitz naevi seem unlikely to progress into spitzoid melanoma, implying that ambiguous spitzoid tumours cannot be intermediate degrees of progression. In addition, the data suggest that HRAS mutation is a potential marker of benign behaviour, in support of which none of three HRAS mutant spitzoid cases metastasized.;First, the morphological similarity of spitzoid tumours reflects an underlying molecular similarity, namely a relative lack of dependence on BRAF/NRAS mutations. Second, Spitz naevi do not appear to progress into spitzoid melanoma, and consequently ambiguous spitzoid tumours are likely to be unclassifiable Spitz naevi or spitzoid melanoma rather than genuine entities. Third, HRAS mutation may be a marker of Spitz naevus, raising the possibility that other molecular markers for discriminating Spitz naevi from spitzoid melanoma can be discovered.",

The protein expression profiles of the two uveal melanoma cytogenetic groups were compared: Proteins that differed significantly were excised and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. Differentially expressed proteins were further analyzed with Western blot analysis. An independent cohort of 41 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) uveal melanomas, whose chromosome 3 status had been determined by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), was examined for the appropriate antigens by immunohistochemistry.;Four protein spots were 1.5-fold (Student's t-test, P < 0.05) differentially expressed in the two uveal melanoma types: two spots were overexpressed in the disomy 3 group compared with the monosomy 3 group, whereas two spots were underexpressed. Identification of the four spots yielded nine proteins. Western blot analysis confirmed the results for heat shock protein (HSP)-27, vimentin, and pyruvate dehydrogenase beta (PDHB), with a statistical significance for the first two proteins. HSP-27 was significantly downregulated, whereas vimentin was upregulated in the monosomy 3 tumors (Student's t-test, P = 0.003 and P = 0.005, respectively).

We included individuals who had either recently progressed on vemurafenib or never received a BRAF inhibitor. In the dose-escalation phase of our study, patients received vemurafenib 720 mg or 960 mg twice a day continuously and cobimetinib 60 mg, 80 mg, or 100 mg once a day for either 14 days on and 14 days off (14/14), 21 days on and 7 days off (21/7), or continuously (28/0). The primary endpoint was safety of the drug combination and to identify dose-limiting toxic effects and the maximum tolerated dose. Efficacy was a key secondary endpoint. All patients treated with vemurafenib and cobimetinib were included in safety and efficacy analyses (intention-to-treat). The study completed accrual and all analyses are final. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01271803.;129 patients were treated at ten dosing regimens combining vemurafenib and cobimetinib: 66 had recently progressed on vemurafenib and 63 had never received a BRAF inhibitor. Dose-limiting toxic effects arose in four patients. One patient on a schedule of vemurafenib 960 mg twice a day and cobimetinib 80 mg once a day 14/14 had grade 3 fatigue for more than 7 days; one patient on a schedule of vemurafenib 960 mg twice a day and cobimetinib 60 mg once a day 21/7 had a grade 3 prolongation of QTc; and two patients on a schedule of vemurafenib 960 mg twice a day and cobimetinib 60 mg 28/0 had dose-limiting toxic effects-one developed grade 3 stomatitis and fatigue and one developed arthralgia and myalgia. The maximum tolerated dose was established as vemurafenib 960 mg twice a day in combination with cobimetinib 60 mg 21/7. Across all dosing regimens, the most common adverse events were diarrhoea (83 patients, 64%), non-acneiform rash (77 patients, 60%), liver enzyme abnormalities (64 patients, 50%), fatigue (62 patients, 48%), nausea (58 patients, 45%), and photosensitivity (52 patients, 40%). Most adverse events were mild-to-moderate in severity. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma (12 patients, 9%; all grade 3), raised amounts of alkaline phosphatase (11 patients, 9%]), and anaemia (nine patients, 7%). Confirmed objective responses were recorded in ten (15%) of 66 patients who had recently progressed on vemurafenib, with a median progression-free survival of 2·8 months (95% CI 2·6-3·4). Confirmed objective responses were noted in 55 (87%) of 63 patients who had never received a BRAF inhibitor, including six (10%) who had a complete response; median progression-free survival was 13·7 months (95% CI 10·1-17·5).;The combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib was safe and tolerable when administered at the respective maximum tolerated doses.

Repeat-free subfragments of the cloned DNA were used for further studies. By Northern blot analysis, the subfragments detected a single 1.2-kilobase mRNA in the transformants and various human melanoma cell lines. ME491 complementary DNA clones were then obtained by probing a melanoma complementary DNA library with the genomic subfragments. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the cloned complementary DNA indicated that the ME491 antigen consists of 237 amino acids (Mr 25,475) with four transmembrane regions and three putative N-glycosylation sites. No significant structural homology was observed with other proteins thus far reported. We observed that the amounts of mRNA varied greatly with different melanoma cell lines.

        "Doc_abstract":"Analysis of DNA copy number changes using comparative genomic hybridization in melanocytic neoplasms has revealed distinct patterns of chromosomal aberrations between benign melanocytic nevi and melanoma. Whereas the vast majority of melanoma expresses chromosomal aberrations, blue nevi, congenital nevi, and most Spitz nevi typically show no aberrations. A subset of Spitz nevi shows an isolated gain of chromosome 11p, an aberration pattern not observed in melanoma. These Spitz nevi frequently harbor mutations in the HRAS gene located on this chromosomal arm. Comparisons among melanoma types showed that melanomas of the palms, soles, and subungual sites can be distinguished by the presence of multiple gene amplifications that arise very early in their progression. About 50% of these amplifications are found at the cyclin D1 locus. By contrast, amplifications are significantly less frequent in other cutaneous melanoma types and if present arise late in progression. The frequent amplifications in melanomas on acral sites allowed the detection of single basal melanocytes with gene amplifications in the histologically normal appearing skin immediately adjacent to a melanoma. These \"field cells\" represent subtle melanoma in situ and are likely to represent minimal residual disease that can lead to local recurrences if not excised with safety margins. The high frequency of chromosomal aberrations in melanomas and their relative absence in nevi could indicate that melanocytes of melanomas went through telomeric crisis, whereas melanocytes in nevi did not. Such a scenario would suggest that replicative senescence is a tumor-suppressive mechanism in melanocytic neoplasia. It might also explain part of the phenomenon of regression commonly seen in melanoma. Genomic analysis is a powerful tool to obtain insight in the progression of melanocytic neoplasms with potential clinical applications for classification and detection of minimal residual melanoma.",

To develop effective and long-lasting therapies for melanoma patients, it is essential to understand the mechanisms underlying resistance to BRAF inhibitors.

Most of these lesions are submitted entirely in formalin for histologic analysis by conventional hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections, and fresh-frozen material for ancillary studies is rarely collected. Molecular techniques, such as comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), can detect chromosomal alterations in tumor DNA that differ between these 2 lesions. This study investigated the ability of high-resolution array-based CGH to serve as a diagnostic test in distinguishing Spitz nevus and melanoma using DNA isolated from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples. Two of 3 Spitz nevi exhibited no significant chromosomal alterations, while the third showed gain of the short arm of chromosome 11p. The latter finding has previously been described as characteristic of a subset of Spitz nevi. The 2 melanomas showed multiple copy number alterations characteristic of melanoma such as 1q amplification and chromosome 9 deletion. This study has shown the utility of array-based CGH as a potential molecular test in distinguishing Spitz nevus from melanoma. The assay is capable of using archival paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed material; is technically easier to perform as compared with conventional CGH; is more sensitive than conventional CGH in being able to detect focal alterations; and can detect copy number alterations even with relatively small amounts of lesional tissue as is typical of many skin tumors.",

The current inhibitors of ERK1/2 target ATP binding or the catalytic site and are therefore limited in their utility for elucidating the complex biological roles of ERK1/2 through its phosphorylation and regulation of over 100 substrate proteins. To overcome this limitation, a combination of computational and experimental methods was used to identify low-molecular-mass inhibitors that are intended to target ERK1/2 substrate-docking domains and selectively interfere with ERK1/2 regulation of substrate proteins. In the present study, we report the identification and characterization of compounds with a thienyl benzenesulfonate scaffold that were designed to inhibit ERK1/2 substrates containing an F-site or DEF (docking site for ERK, FXF) motif. Experimental evidence shows the compounds inhibit the expression of F-site containing immediate early genes (IEGs) of the Fos family, including c-Fos and Fra1, and transcriptional regulation of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) complex. Moreover, this class of compounds selectively induces apoptosis in melanoma cells containing mutated BRaf and constitutively active ERK1/2 signalling, including melanoma cells that are inherently resistant to clinically relevant kinase inhibitors. These findings represent the identification and initial characterization of a novel class of compounds that inhibit ERK1/2 signalling functions and their potential utility for elucidating ERK1/2 and other signalling events that control the growth and survival of cancer cells containing elevated ERK1/2 activity.

This suggests that BRAF and NRAS 'double mutants' may not provide advantage for tumour growth, or may even be selected against during tumorigenesis. However, by applying mutant-allele-specific-amplification-PCR method to short-term melanoma lines, one out of 14 tumours was found to harbour both BRAFV600E and the activating NRASQ61R mutations. On the other hand, analysis of 21 melanoma clones isolated by growth in soft agar from this tumour indicated that 16/21 clones harboured a BRAFV600E, but were wild-type for NRAS, whereas the remaining had the opposite genotype (NRASQ61R/wild-type BRAF). When compared to BRAFV600E clones, NRASQ61R clones displayed reduced growth in soft agar, but higher proliferative ability in vitro in liquid medium and even in vivo after grafting into SCID/SCID mice. These data suggest that NRAS and BRAF activating mutations can coexist in the same melanoma, but are mutually exclusive at the single-cell level.

In this study, we observed ectopic lymphoid structures, defined as lymphoid follicles comprising clusters of B lymphocytes and follicular dendritic cells (DC), associated with high endothelial venules (HEV) and clusters of T cells and mature DCs, in 7 of 29 cutaneous metastases from melanoma patients. Some follicles contained germinal centers. In contrast to metastatic lesions, primary melanomas did not host follicles, but many contained HEVs, suggesting an incomplete lymphoid neogenesis. Analysis of the repertoire of rearranged immunoglobulin genes in the B cells of microdissected follicles revealed clonal amplification, somatic mutation and isotype switching, indicating a local antigen-driven B-cell response. Surprisingly, IgA responses were observed despite the nonmucosal location of the follicles. Taken together, our findings show the existence of lymphoid neogenesis in melanoma and suggest that the presence of functional ectopic lymphoid structures in direct contact with the tumor makes the local development of antimelanoma B- and T-cell responses possible.",

The effects of BRAFi on melanoma cell proliferation and survival have been extensively studied, and several mechanisms involved in acquired resistance to the growth suppressive activity of these drugs have been identified. Much less is known about the impact of BRAFi, and in particular of dabrafenib, on the invasive potential of melanoma cells. In the present study, the BRAF-mutant human melanoma cell line A375 and its dabrafenib-resistant subline A375R were analyzed for invasive capacity, expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-2, and secretion of VEGF-A and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, under basal conditions or in response to dabrafenib. The consequences of inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway on A375R cell responses to dabrafenib were also evaluated. We found that A375R cells were more invasive and secreted higher levels of VEGF-A and MMP-9 as compared with A375 cells. Dabrafenib reduced invasiveness, VEGFR-2 expression and VEGF-A secretion in A375 cells, whereas it increased invasiveness, VEGF-A and MMP-9 release in A375R cells. In these latter cells, the stimulating effects of dabrafenib on the invasive capacity were markedly impaired by the anti-VEGF‑A antibody bevacizumab, or by AKT1 silencing. A375R cells were not cross-resistant to the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor GSK2126458A. Moreover, this inhibitor given in combination with dabrafenib efficiently counteracted the stimulating effects of the BRAFi on invasiveness and VEGF-A and MMP-9 secretion. Our data demonstrate that melanoma cells with acquired resistance to dabrafenib possess a more invasive phenotype which is further stimulated by exposure to the drug. Substantial evidence indicates that continuing BRAFi therapy beyond progression produces a clinical benefit. Our results suggest that after the development of resistance, a regimen combining BRAFi with bevacizumab or with inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway might be more effective than BRAFi monotherapy.

We sought to characterize the clinicopathological and molecular features of BRAFi-MLs. A retrospective review over a 4-year period revealed 20 patients in which 44 MLs (including 11 control nevi) were characterized by histopathology, review of clinical medical records, and immunohistochemical (IHC) studies (with anti-BRAF V600E, anti-BAP1, anti-cyclin D1, and anti-p16); the percentage of IHC+ cells was scored. Of the 20 patients, 3 (15%) whose BRAFi-MLs were biopsied had a second primary cutaneous melanoma. Of the 44 BRAFi-MLs tested, 37 (100%) of 37 MLs available for BRAF V600E testing lacked expression in contrast to 1 (9%) of 11 control nevi (lesions not associated with targeted therapy). A significantly higher level of cyclin D1 expression (>50% IHC+ cells) was more commonly seen in BRAFi-MLs (44%) than in control nevi (9%). No difference in p16 expression in melanocytes was seen between the 2 groups. BRAF mutation status distinctly differs between BRAFi-MLs from melanomas and nevi biopsied in patients who do not receive BRAFi therapy. Morphologically, BRAFi-MLs demonstrate a greater degree of atypia than do control nevi. Furthermore, BRAFi-MLs with coexisting cutaneous keratinocyte toxicity developed during fewer days of targeted therapy. Paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway in BRAF(WT) melanocytes may account for ~15% to 21% of patients developing a second new primary melanoma within a year of starting BRAFi therapy; thus, close clinical surveillance is warranted.

Our data showed gross but nonrandom somatic changes specific to the tumor genome. Although the CDKN2A (78%) and PTEN (70%) loci were the major targets of mono-allelic and bi-allelic deletions, amplifications affected loci with BRAF (53%) and NRAS (12%) as well as EGFR (52%), MITF (40%), NOTCH2 (35%), CCND1 (18%), MDM2 (18%), CCNE1 (10%), and CDK4 (8%). The amplified loci carried additional genes, many of which could potentially play a role in melanoma. Distinct patterns of copy number changes showed that alterations in CDKN2A tended to be more clustered in cell lines with mutations in the BRAF and NRAS genes; the PTEN locus was targeted mainly in conjunction with BRAF mutations. Amplification of CCND1, CDK4, and other loci was significantly increased in cell lines without BRAF-NRAS mutations and so was the loss of chromosome arms 13q and 16q. Our data suggest involvement of distinct genetic pathways that are driven either through oncogenic BRAF and NRAS mutations complemented by aberrations in the CDKN2A and PTEN genes or involve amplification of oncogenic genomic loci and loss of 13q and 16q. It also emerges that each tumor besides being affected by major and most common somatic genetic alterations also acquires additional genetic alterations that could be crucial in determining response to small molecular inhibitors that are being currently pursued.",

To this end, mutant hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) deficient (HPRT-) T-cells were used as probes to detect T-cell clonal amplifications and trafficking in vivo in patients with advanced melanoma. Mutant T-cells from peripheral blood were obtained as clonal isolates or in mass cultures in the presence of 6-thioguanine (TG) selection and from tumor-bearing lymph nodes (LNs) or metastatic melanoma tissues by TG-selected mass cultures. Nonmutant (wild-type) cells were obtained from all sites by analogous means, but without TG selection. cDNA sequences of the T-cell receptor (TCR) beta chains (TCR-beta), determined directly (clonal isolates) or following insertion into plasmids (mass cultures), were used as unambiguous biomarkers of in vivo clonality of mature T-cell clones. Clonal amplifications, identified as repetitive TCR-beta V-region, complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3), and J-region gene sequences, were demonstrated at all sites studied, that is, peripheral blood, LNs, and metastatic tumors. Amplifications were significantly enriched among the mutant compared with the wild-type T-cell fractions. Importantly, T-cell trafficking was manifested by identical TCR-beta cDNA sequences, including the hypervariable CDR3 motifs, being found in both blood and tissues in individual patients. The findings described herein indicate that the mutant T-cell fractions from melanoma patients are enriched for proliferating T-cells that infiltrate the tumor, making them candidates for investigations of potentially protective immunological responses.",

While TrkA gene is frequently rearranged in cancers, its involvement in malignant melanoma (MM) development is still unclear.;We analyzed a dataset of primary cutaneous MM (n = 31) by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), to identify genomic amplifications associated with tumor progression. The analysis was validated by genomic quantitative PCR (qPCR) on an extended set of cases (n = 64) and the results were correlated with the clinical outcome. To investigate TrkA molecular pathways and cellular function, we generated inducible activation of the NGF-TrkA signaling in human MM cell lines.;We identified amplification of 1q23.1, where the TrkA locus resides, as a candidate hotspot implicated in the progression of MM. Across 40 amplicons detected, segmental amplification of 1q23.1 showed the strongest association with tumor thickness. By validation of the analysis, TrkA gene amplification emerged as a frequent event in primary melanomas (50 % of patients), and correlated with worse clinical outcome. However, experiments in cell lines revealed that induction of the NGF-TrkA signaling produced a phenotype of dramatic suppression of cell proliferation through inhibition of cell division and pronounced intracellular vacuolization, in a way straightly dependent on NGF activation of TrkA. These events were triggered via MAPK activity but not via AKT, and involved p21(cip1) protein increase, compatibly with a mechanism of oncogene-induced growth arrest.;Taken together, our findings point to TrkA as a candidate oncogene in MM and support a model in which the NGF-TrkA-MAPK pathway may mediate a trade-off between neoplastic transformation and adaptive anti-proliferative response.",

Despite the remarkable clinical activities achieved by vemurafenib and dabrafenib in treating BRAF(V600E) metastatic melanoma, their clinical efficacy in BRAF(V600E) colorectal cancer is far less impressive. Prior studies suggested that feedback activation of EGFR and MAPK signaling upon BRAF inhibition might contribute to the relative unresponsiveness of colorectal cancer to the first-generation BRAF inhibitors. Here, we report characterization of a dual RAF kinase/EGFR inhibitor, BGB-283, which is currently under clinical investigation. In vitro, BGB-283 potently inhibits BRAF(V600E)-activated ERK phosphorylation and cell proliferation. It demonstrates selective cytotoxicity and preferentially inhibits proliferation of cancer cells harboring BRAF(V600E) and EGFR mutation/amplification. In BRAF(V600E) colorectal cancer cell lines, BGB-283 effectively inhibits the reactivation of EGFR and EGFR-mediated cell proliferation. In vivo, BGB-283 treatment leads to dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition accompanied by partial and complete tumor regressions in both cell line-derived and primary human colorectal tumor xenografts bearing BRAF(V600E) mutation.

We sought to analyze the influence of BRAF status on LC of melanoma brain metastases (MBM) following Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GK).;Among 125 patients treated with GK for MBM at our institution between 2006 and 2015, we identified 19 patients with 69 evaluable metastases whose BRAF mutation status was known and follow-up imaging was available. LC of individual metastases was compared based on BRAF mutation status using statistical techniques to control for measurements of multiple metastases within each patient. CNS progression was defined as either local failure or development of new lesions.;Of the 69 metastases, BRAF was mutated in 30 and wild-type in 39. With a median follow-up of 30 months for all patients and a median follow-up of 5.5 months for treated lesions, 1-year LC was significantly better among metastases with mutated vs. wild-type BRAF (69 vs. 34%, RR = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.1-0.7, p = 0.01). BRAF mutation was found to be a significant predictor of LC after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in both univariate [RR = 0.3 (95% CI 0.1-0.7, p = 0.01)] and multivariate [RR = 0.2 (95% CI 0.1-0.7, p = 0.01)] analyses. There was also a trend toward improved CNS progression free survival (PFS) at 1 year (26 vs. 0%, p = 0.06), favoring BRAF-mutated patients.;In this retrospective study, MBM treated with GK had significantly improved LC for patients with BRAF mutation vs. wild-type.

Examination of the chromatin structure of the transcription unit revealed no qualitative differences in DH sites within the panel of tested human melanoma cells, but especially the sequences around the transcription start site and a 1.5 kb upstream region appeared more accessible to the nuclease in frequently (BLM, MV3) as compared to poorly (530, 1F6) metastasizing cells. The genomic fragments that harbor one or more DH sites were subjected to functional analysis by luciferase reporter gene assays. Thus, an enhancer element was detected between 361 and 167 bp upstream of the transcription start site. This enhancer displayed equal activating potential (2-3 fold) both in weakly and in frequently metastasizing cells and was apparently recognized by transcription factors present in both types of human melanoma cells lines.

It may be only small numbers of circulating tumour cells are present at any one time in the peripheral blood of patients with malignant melanoma.

Different reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) protocols allowing the quantification of the TAA mRNA expression in the solid tumor or the detection of circulating melanoma cells have been described. We have recently shown a positive correlation between the amount of specific product formed by RT-PCR and the staining intensity in immunohistochemical analysis of the corresponding sample. Here we describe a quantification procedure based on the direct digitization of the PCR products after separation on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels, followed by computer-assisted densitometry. To standardize our method, we examined the linear range of the densitometric quantification procedure as reflected by the correlation of signal intensity to the amount of the corresponding DNA. As an internal measure for the so-termed cDNA in the different samples after RNA isolation and reverse transcription, a beta-actin PCR was introduced. Subsequently, we chose four sets of primers for the melanoma-associated antigens MAGE1, tyrosinase, Melan A/MART-1 and gp100/Pmel17 and performed PCR analysis over a range of cycle numbers. In each case, the amplification rate remained constant up to at least 26 cycles under the respective conditions. Plotting the logarithm of the amount of product against the cycle number yields a slope that equals the logarithm of the amplification rate. The amount of starting material can be determined from the intercept with the ordinate. In summary, the method introduced in the present work allows the quantification of TAA in melanoma which might be important for the monitoring of disease. Technically the method is sound and sensitive, avoids post-PCR manipulations and can be performed with the standard equipment of a molecular biology laboratory. It can be applied also to other solid tumors and leukemias.",

A genomic library of 20,000 clones, which is highly enriched for sequences encompassing 6q21, was then constructed. Clones from this library have been mapped against a human-rodent somatic cell hybrid mapping panel that divides chromosome 6 into seven regions, confirming the localization of probes within the target region.

By sharp contrast, 12 Spitz naevi with an unambiguous histopathology showed no or few chromosomal aberrations, no oncogene mutations and no methylation of CpG sequences. Of the 16 ambiguous spitzoid lesions, most of which were designated atypical Spitz tumour by one of the authors, all but one showed no mutations, no methylations and few copy number aberrations. However, three tumours showed copy number loss of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A gene (CDKN2A), an alteration observed frequently in melanomas but not found in conventional Spitz naevi. These results show that, although most atypical Spitz tumours do not differ from conventional Spitz naevi showing virtually no genetic and epigenetic aberrations, some cases may have chromosomal aberrations that include copy number loss of the CDKN2A gene.;Genetic and epigenetic analyses may be useful as an additional diagnostic tool to distinguish between melanoma and Spitz naevus, and may help to define subgroups in atypical Spitz tumours.",

High levels of all alternatively spliced HLA-G transcripts could be detected in melanoma cells by RT-PCR. Analysis of biopsies from a melanoma patient revealed a higher HLA-G transcription level in skin metastasis as compared to healthy skin, while specific amplification of the HLA-G5 transcript was only observable in the tumor.

Melanoma patients benefit from the combination of BRAF inhibitors with mitogen/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitors, among others.

Passive immuno-gene therapy, employing an adoptive treatment with in vitro activated and expanded anti-tumor effector cells, involves two major application fields for gene transfer techniques, first the genetic modification of the effector cells, and second the in vivo amplification of pre-effector cells by procedures also used in active immuno-gene therapy. Corresponding preclinical studies are reviewed. The clinical studies inaugurated during the last few years are mostly still ongoing and focus on treatment safety and tolerability rather than efficacy. A recent trend is emerging to explore recombinant adenovirus and vaccinia virus vectors particularly with regard to in vivo gene transfer applications. Overall, immuno-gene therapy of melanoma is still in a highly experimental stage of development but may become a safe, efficacious and practical adjuvant treatment modality in the future.",

Vemurafenib treatment led to the release of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) from the melanoma cells that increased the differentiation state of the fibroblasts, an affect associated with fibronectin deposition, increase in α-smooth muscle actin expression, and the release of neuregulin (NRG). At the same time, vemurafenib directly activated the fibroblasts through paradoxical stimulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, causing them to secrete hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Treatment with the BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination reversed the release of HGF. Adhesion of melanoma cells to fibronectin was critical in amplifying the fibroblast-derived NRG- and HGF-mediated PI3K/AKT (phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/AKT) survival signaling in the melanoma cells following BRAF inhibition. In coculture studies, combination treatment with inhibitors of BRAF/MET/HER kinase was ineffective at reversing the fibroblast-mediated therapeutic escape from BRAF inhibition. Instead, it was noted that combined BRAF/PI3K inhibition overcame fibroblast-mediated drug resistance in vitro and was associated with enhanced antitumor effects in an in vivo xenograft model. Thus, we show that melanoma cells and fibroblasts remodel their microenvironment in response to BRAF inhibition and that these adaptations allow tumor cells to evade therapy through increased PI3K/AKT survival signaling.

Demographic, treatment patterns, response, and survival data were collected from medical charts. Clinical data on 283 patients with active BRAF V600E-mutant MBM treated with vemurafenib were provided by 70 US oncologists. Mean age was 57.2 years, 60.8% were male, 67.5% had ECOG performance status of 0-1, and 43.1% used corticosteroids at vemurafenib initiation. Median follow-up was 5.7 months. Following vemurafenib initiation, 48.1% of patients experienced intracranial response and 45.6% experienced extracranial response. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for overall survival was 59% at 12 months. Multivariate analyses showed associations between intracranial response and both corticosteroid use and vemurafenib as initial therapy after MBM diagnosis. Larger size (5-10 mm vs. < 5 mm) and number of brain metastases (≥ 5 vs. < 2) and progressive extracranial disease at treatment initiation were associated with decreased intracranial response and increased risk of disease progression. Multiple extracranial sites (2 vs. < 2) and the absence of local treatments were also associated with increased risk of progression. Increased risk of death was associated with ≥ 2 extracranial disease sites, progressive extracranial disease, and ≥ 5 brain metastases.

We profile adaptive responses across a panel of melanoma cell lines using multiplex biochemical measurement, single-cell assays, and statistical modeling and show that adaptation involves at least six signaling cascades that act to reduce drug potency (IC50) and maximal effect (i.e., Emax ≪ 1). Among these cascades, we identify a role for JNK/c-Jun signaling in vemurafenib adaptation and show that RAF and JNK inhibitors synergize in cell killing. This arises because JNK inhibition prevents a subset of cells in a cycling population from becoming quiescent upon vemurafenib treatment, thereby reducing drug Emax. Our findings demonstrate the breadth and diversity of adaptive responses to RAF/MEK inhibition and a means to identify which steps in a signaling cascade are most predictive of phenotypic response.

Therefore, in current neuropathological practice BRAF testing is of clinical importance in tissue samples of melanoma brain metastases in order to identify cases amenable to therapy with BRAF inhibitors. BRAF mutation testing may also add additional information for differential diagnosis of primary brain tumors in selected situations, e.g., for differentiation of anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (BRAF V600E mutation in 65%) from glioblastoma (BRAF V600E mutation in < 5%). The BRAF mutation status can be tested with DNA-based methods and immunohistochemistry using a V600E mutation-specific antibody. In summary, at this point BRAF V600E testing is clinically indicated in relatively few cases of the daily clinical neuropathology practice, but has important predictive implications for patients with melanoma brain metastases.

Major differences may result from the kind of blood preparation, the RNA isolation method, the kind of RT enzyme used, and the gene targeted by PCR primers. In our experience, blood purification by a Ficoll gradient increased melanoma cell detection rates compared to RNA extraction from total blood or after erythrocyte lysis. Amplification of MelanA in addition to tyrosinase resulted in a 30% enhanced sensitivity of melanoma cell detection compared to amplification to tyrosinase alone, whereas gp100/pMel17 and MUC18 gene products were already detected in blood from nonmelanoma patients. These findings are in agreement with those of other groups. Currently, an increase in the sensitivity for detection of circulating tumour cells to more than 50% of patients with disseminated melanoma seems to be unlikely. It is interesting that between 15% and 30% positive results and sometimes more have already been obtained from patients with primary melanoma. So far, there is no data for judging the prognostic significance of the detection of circulating tumour cells in patients without clinically recognisable metastases. Our limited experience shows that staging examinations in these patients reveal no proof of macrometastasis. Therefore, it is presently unclear whether these positive findings are associated with long-term prognosis or if they merely reflect false positive findings in this highly sensitive RT-PCR technique.",

Here, we aim to describe novel genetic findings and explain possible mechanisms resulting in the most severe form of neurocutaneous melanocytosis. Detailed histological (biopsy and post-mortem) studies, tissue culture, and high-resolution cytogenetic analysis, including chromosome and array comparative genomic hybridization, Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel, and Sanger sequencing, were performed on tissues from a white male who succumbed at 17 months of age to congenital melanoma associated with a bathing-trunk nevus. We also used quantitative PCR to quantitatively assess the expression of NRAS among normal cells, including fibroblast and melanocytes, as well as melanoma cells from our patient. Full autopsy documented tumors in the brain, spinal cord, lung, liver, testis, bone marrow, and, retrospectively, in the placenta. Next-generation sequencing and chromosome microarray in our patient revealed novel findings, including duplication of a mutated NRAS gene, leading to an aggressive clinical course and disseminated disease. Quantitative PCR showed a five-fold increase in NRAS expression in the melanoma cell line when compared with normal melanocytes. Finally, three amino acid-changing germline variants were detected: homozygous TP53 p.P72R, heterozygous KIT p.M541L, and homozygous KDR (VEGFR2) p.Q472H. These genes are involved in malignancy and other potentially relevant pathways, such as mast cell and melanocytic signaling, as well as angiogenesis. These findings provide novel insights into the biology of congenital melanocytic proliferations, showing that amplification of mutated NRAS seems to represent a new genetic mechanism leading to melanoma in the context of neurocutaneous melanocytosis.

Overall survival (OS) was calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Differences between BRAF status were calculated using chi-square tests for categorical variables, median tests for continuous variables and Cox proportional hazards models to compare OS.;Up to 158 patients were identified but 17 were excluded due to inadequate clinical data. Of the remaining 141 patients, 69 (49%) tested BRAF mutant (BRAF-m), median age 47 years (range 21-79) with median follow-up of 16.8 months (IQR11.3-25.2). Seventy-two (51%) tested BRAF wild type (BRAF-w), median age 62 years (range 25-84) with median follow-up of 27.1 months (IQR12.5-57.4). Overall, RT utilization was similar: 68% in BRAF-m and 69% in BRAF-w. Mean number of treatment courses was 1.70 for BRAF-m and 2.36 for BRAF-w (Pearson chi-square 3.92, P = 0.05).

        "Doc_abstract":"Recently we proposed the hypothesis that extensive telomeric association of chromosomes is an early manifestation of cell death and asked whether there are extensive telomeric associations present in metaphases of the spontaneously regressing Sinclair swine cutaneous melanoma (SSCM). Our results indicate that early passage SSCMs, in the accelerated growth phase, do not show telomeric associations but do have numerical and other specific structural abnormalities. However, the same melanoma cell lines at late passages or melanomas obtained from middle- and old-aged Sinclair swine show extensive telomeric associations in the form of dicentric, multicentric, and ring configurations. Such abnormal structures are present mostly in metaphases that are hyperploids. Increasing frequencies of apoptotic bodies were also observed in higher passage tumor cell lines obtained from younger animals or in melanomas obtained from older animals. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay shows no detectable telomerase activity in any of these regressing swine melanoma cell lines, neither in normal swine skin fibroblasts nor in nevi. However, the fetal swine (i.e., non-regressing) melanoma cells show telomerase activity. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results using the commercially available human telomeric repeat DNA probe indicate a reduction of telomeric signals in metaphase and interphase cells of regressing melanomas. From these observations we conclude that spontaneous regression of SSCM is associated with the loss of telomerase activity and a reduction of telomeric repeats that results in the formation of multicentric and ring configurations. Such abnormal chromosome configurations are lost, following the breakage-fusion-bridge-cycles, and result in extensive DNA fragmentation, as shown by laddering experiments, and, finally, cell death.",

Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) is an analytically sensitive technique for quantifying small concentrations of DNA. We studied the plasma concentrations of cfBRAF(V600E) by ddPCR in patients with melanoma during therapy with BRAF inhibitors.;Plasma concentrations of cfBRAF(V600E) were measured in 8 controls and 20 patients with advanced melanoma having the BRAF(V600E) mutation during treatment with BRAF inhibitors at baseline, first month, best response, and progression.;The BRAF(V600E) mutation was detected by ddPCR even at a fractional abundance of 0.005% in the wild-type gene. Agreement between tumor tissue BRAF(V600E) and plasma cfBRAF(V600E) was 84.3%. Baseline cfBRAF(V600E) correlated with tumor burden (r = 0.742, P < 0.001). cfBRAF(V600E) concentrations decreased significantly at the first month of therapy (basal median, 216 copies/mL; Q1-Q3, 27-647 copies/mL; first response median, 0 copies/mL; Q1-Q3, 0-49 copies/mL; P < 0.01) and at the moment of best response (median, 0 copies/mL; Q1-Q3, 0-33 copies/mL; P < 0.01).

Methodological differences in the processing of blood samples may in part account for these discrepancies. The aim of this study was to standardize and optimize the experimental conditions for RT-PCR detection of melanoma cells in peripheral blood. We analysed the effect of different parameters of sample processing on the sensitivity of the tyrosinase RT-PCR using peripheral blood spiked with defined numbers of SKMEL28 melanoma cells. Purification of the mononuclear cell fraction using a Ficoll gradient with a density of 1.077 g/mL prior to RNA isolation gave the highest sensitivity, with the detection of two SKMEL28 cells in 5 mL of blood. In addition, the RNA isolation method and the kind of RT enzyme used had a significant impact on the sensitivity and reproducibility of tyrosinase detection, whereas variations in the PCR conditions had only a minor influence. Furthermore, we showed that amplification of MelanA in addition to tyrosinase resulted in an approximately 10% enhanced sensitivity of melanoma cell detection, whereas gp100/pMel17 and MUC18 gene products were also detected in blood from non-melanoma patients.

The median overall survival from first SRS procedure was 6.7, 11.2 months if treated with a BRAF inhibitor and 4.5 months for BRAF-WT. Actuarial survival rates for BRAF-M patients on an inhibitor were 54 % at 6 months and 41 % at 12 months from the time of SRS. In contrast, BRAF-WT had overall survival rates of 28 % at 6 months and 19 % at 12 months. Overall survival was extended for patients on a BRAF inhibitor at or after the first SRS. The median time to intracranial progression was 3.9 months on a BRAF inhibitor and 1.7 months without. The local control rate for all treated tumors was 92.5 %, with no difference based on BRAF status. Patients with higher KPS, fewer treated intracranial metastases, controlled systemic disease, RPA Class 1 and BRAF-M patients had extended overall survival. Overall, patients with BRAF-M treated with both SRS and BRAF inhibitors, at or after SRS, have increased overall survival from the time of SRS. As patients live longer as a result of more effective systemic and local therapies, close surveillance and early management of intracranial disease with SRS will become increasingly important. ",

MicroRNA (miRNA) expression profiling was done on paraffin sections of invasive tumor with liver metastasis (n=1) and non invasive tumor (n=1) in biological duplicates. Samples for miRNA expression profiling were identified based on case registry and the harboring of monosomy 3 by CISH.;A significant correlation (p=0.05) between metastasizing and non-metastasizing melanoma harboring chromosomal aberrations- monosomy3, c-myc, and 1p36 was observed by Pearson's correlation. A significant correlation was observed in monosomy 3 and 1p36 positive cases in the tumor samples (p=0.039). No significance was observed between monosomy 3 and c-myc positive cases. No significance (p=0.096) was observed between c-myc amplification and trisomy (extra whole chromosome 8). MicroRNA expression profiling revealed the presence of 19 miRNAs expressed in non-metastasizing melanoma and absent in metastasizing melanoma. Eleven miRNAs were found to be expressed in metastasizing melanoma and absent in non-metastasizing melanoma. Genes targeted by the miRNAs were found to be present in chromosomal regions 8p22, 13q, and 17p but were often found to be deleted.;This technique can be applied to routine pathology using archival specimens to identify patients with monosomy 3. We were able to perform CISH in all the cases except the heavily pigmented tumors, where dots were observed but were not assessed. Initial studies on microRNA have revealed their role as oncomirs in both metastasizing and non-metastasizing melanomas.

We demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunoassay and Northern blot analysis that TGF-beta1 selectively induced IL-8 expression, at both protein and mRNA levels, in highly metastatic A375SM cells but not cells of their poorly metastatic parental line A375P. Transient transfection with luciferase reporter gene constructs revealed that TGF-beta1 activated IL-8 promoter activity in A375SM cells but not A375P cells. Studies with progressive 5' deletion constructs and site-specific mutations demonstrated that a construct containing -133 to +44 of the 5'-flanking sequence was necessary and sufficient for maximal TGF-beta1-induced transcription response and that TGF-beta1-induced activation of IL-8 promoter depended on AP-1 (-126 to -120 bp), NF-kappaB (-94 to -71 bp), and C/EBP-like factor NF-IL6 (-94 to -81 bp) in this region. Interestingly, both A375P and A375SM cells expressed type I and type II TGF-beta receptors and TGF-beta1 induced the nuclear translocation of Smad3 protein in both A375P and A375SM cells. Moreover, both A375P and A375SM cells were susceptible to TGF-beta1-induced growth inhibition. Our data thus demonstrated that TGF-beta1 selectively induced IL-8 expression in highly metastatic A375SM melanoma cells.

In addition, the results of a molecular assay require a complex interpretation process of the analytical data as the patient's genotype, the translation of the identified variant into a predicted phenotype and knowledge on restrictions of the method used. In relation to these aspects herein we report an opinion paper of the Working Group Personalized Laboratory Medicine jointly constituted by the European Federation of Laboratory Medicine (EFLM) and by the European Society of Pharmacogenomics and Theranostics (ESPT) using, as an example, the BRAF genotype analysis in tumor tissue samples for identification of melanoma patients that can benefit treatment with BRAF inhibitors. The manuscript is focused on the following aspects: i) medical rationale, ii) methodologies of analysis, iii) laboratory performance evaluation and iv) the laboratory specific report for the clinicians. The critical evaluation of these aspects would be useful for the implementation of a companion diagnostic in the clinical laboratory. ",

BRAF acts as direct effector of RAS and through the activation of MEK, promotes tumour growth and survival. Approximately, 8% of cancers carry a BRAF mutation. However, the prevalence of this mutation varies significantly across different tumour types. There has been increasing interest in the specific role of BRAF mutations in cancer growth and progression over the last few years, especially since the clinical introduction of therapeutic BRAF inhibitors. In this paper we review the published literature on the role of BRAF mutations in melanoma and colorectal cancer, focusing on similarities and differences of BRAF mutations with respect to frequency, demographics, risk factors, mutation-associated clinico-pathologic and molecular features and clinical implications between these two diseases.",

The manufacturer of vemurafenib, Roche Products Limited, was invited by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to submit evidence of the drug's clinical- and cost-effectiveness for its licenced indication, to inform the Institute's Single Technology Appraisal (STA) process. The Liverpool Reviews and Implementation Group (LRiG) at the University of Liverpool was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG) for this appraisal. This article summarises the ERG's review of the evidence submitted by the manufacturer and also includes a summary of the NICE Appraisal Committee (AC) decision. The ERG reviewed the clinical- and cost-effectiveness evidence in accordance with the decision problem defined by NICE. The ERG's analysis of the submitted economic model assessed the appropriateness of the approach taken by the manufacturer in modelling the decision problem. It also included an assessment of the reliability of model implementation and the extent of conformity to published standards and prevailing norms of practice within the health economics modelling community. Particular attention was paid to issues likely to impact substantially on the base-case cost-effectiveness results. The clinical evidence was derived from BRIM 3 (BRAF Inhibitor in Melanoma 3), a well-designed, multi-centre, multi-national, phase III, randomised controlled trial (RCT). Clinical outcome results from the October 2011 data cut showed that median overall survival for patients treated with vemurafenib was 13.2 months compared with 9.6 months for those treated with dacarbazine. The ERG's main concern with the trial was the potential for confounding because of the early introduction of the crossover from the comparator drug to vemurafenib or another BRAF inhibitor. The submitted incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was considered above the NICE threshold, even when end-of-life criteria were taken into account. The ERG questioned the submitted economic model on a number of grounds, particularly the approach used to project trial results. After the ERG had made appropriate corrections to the model and employed an alternative form of projective modelling, the ICER per quality-adjusted life year more than doubled. Additional evidence was submitted by the manufacturer for consideration at a second AC meeting and at their third meeting the AC concluded that vemurafenib could be recommended as first-line maintenance treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic BRAF V600 mutation-positive malignant melanoma.

Functional evidences implicate semaphorin signals in cancer progression and metastasis. Yet, it is largely unknown whether plexin genes are genetically altered in human tumors. We performed a comprehensive gene copy analysis and mutational profiling of all nine members of the plexin gene family (plexinome), in melanomas and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs), which are characterized by high metastatic potential and poor prognosis. Gene copy analysis detected amplification of PLXNA4 in melanomas, whereas copy number losses of multiple plexin genes were seen in PDACs. Somatic mutations were detected in PLXNA4, PLXNB3, and PLXNC1; providing the first evidence that these plexins are mutated in human cancer. Functional assays in cellular models revealed that some of these missense mutations result in loss of plexin function. For instance, c.1613G>A, p.R538H mutation in the extracellular domain of PLXNB3 prevented binding of the ligand Sema5A. Moreover, although PLXNA4 signaling can inhibit tumor cell migration, the mutated c.5206C>T, p.H1736Y allele had lost this activity.

However, the majority of patients receiving BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) manifest disease progression within a year. We have recently shown that melanoma patients treated with BRAFi exhibit an increase in melanoma-associated antigens and in CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in response to therapy. To characterize such a T-cell infiltrate, we analyzed the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of rearranged T-cell receptor (TCR) β chain-coding genes in tumor biopsies obtained before the initiation of BRAFi and 10-14 d later. We observed an increase in the clonality of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in 7 of 8 patients receiving BRAFi, with a statistically significant 21% aggregate increase in clonality. Over 80% of individual T-cell clones detected after initiation of BRAFi treatment were new clones. Interestingly, the comparison of tumor infiltrates with clinical responses revealed that patients who had a high proportion of pre-existing dominant clones after the administration of BRAFi responded better to therapy than patients who had a low proportion of such pre-existing dominant clones following BRAFi. These data suggest that although the inhibition of BRAF in melanoma patients results in tumor infiltration by new lymphocytes, the response to treatment appears to be related to the presence of a pre-existing population of tumor-infiltrating T-cell clones.",

LKB1 is a multi-task Ser/Thr kinase that phosphorylates AMPK controlling cell growth and apoptosis under metabolic stress conditions. Additionally, LKB1(Ser428) becomes phosphorylated in a RAS-Erk1/2-p90(RSK) pathway dependent manner. However, the connection between the RAS pathway and LKB1 is mostly unknown.;Using the UV induced HGF transgenic mouse melanoma model to investigate the interplay among HGF signaling, RAS pathway and PI3K pathway in melanoma, we identified LKB1 as a protein directly modified by HGF induced signaling. A variety of molecular techniques and tissue culture revealed that LKB1(Ser428) (Ser431 in the mouse) is constitutively phosphorylated in BRAF(V600E) mutant melanoma cell lines and spontaneous mouse tumors with high RAS pathway activity. Interestingly, BRAF(V600E) mutant melanoma cells showed a very limited response to metabolic stress mediated by the LKB1-AMPK-mTOR pathway. Here we show for the first time that RAS pathway activation including BRAF(V600E) mutation promotes the uncoupling of AMPK from LKB1 by a mechanism that appears to be independent of LKB1(Ser428) phosphorylation. Notably, the inhibition of the RAS pathway in BRAF(V600E) mutant melanoma cells recovered the complex formation and rescued the LKB1-AMPKalpha metabolic stress-induced response, increasing apoptosis in cooperation with the pro-apoptotic proteins Bad and Bim, and the down-regulation of Mcl-1.;These data demonstrate that growth factor treatment and in particular oncogenic BRAF(V600E) induces the uncoupling of LKB1-AMPKalpha complexes providing at the same time a possible mechanism in cell proliferation that engages cell growth and cell division in response to mitogenic stimuli and resistance to low energy conditions in tumor cells. Importantly, this mechanism reveals a new level for therapeutical intervention particularly relevant in tumors harboring a deregulated RAS-Erk1/2 pathway.",

As tumours may contain a mixture of mutant and wild type BRAF cells and this has been also put forward as a resistance mechanism, we aimed to evaluate the sensitivity/resistance of six, randomly selected, (WT)BRAF/(WT)NRAS lines to vemurafenib and found four sensitive. The sensitivity to the drug was accompanied by a potent inhibition of both phospho-ERK and phospho-AKT, and a significant induction of apoptosis while absent in lines with intrinsic or acquired resistance. Phospho-CRAF expression was low in all sensitive lines and high in resistant ones, and MEK inhibition can effectively potentiate the drug effect. A possible explanation for CRAF modulation is cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a mediator of melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R) signalling, since it can actually inhibit CRAF. Indeed, we measured cAMP and found that all four sensitive lines contained significantly higher constitutive cAMP levels than the resistant ones. Consequently, vemurafenib and cAMP stimulator combination resulted in a substantial synergistic effect in lines with both intrinsic and acquired resistance but only restricted to those where cAMP was effectively increased. The use of a cAMP agonist overcame such restriction. In conclusion, we report that (WT)BRAF/(WT)NRAS melanoma lines with low phospho-CRAF and high cAMP levels may be sensitive to vemurafenib and that CRAF inhibition through cAMP stimulation may overcome the resistance to the drug.

After progression during or post immunotherapy, these patients were given BRAF inhibitor therapy and developed rapid CRs. Based on the concomitant presence of autoimmune manifestations (including vitiligo and hypophysitis), we postulated that there was a synergistic effect between the prior immune therapy and the BRAF targeting agents. Accordingly, the inhibitors were gradually weaned off beginning at 3 months and were stopped completely at 9-12 months. The three patients remain well and in CR off of all therapy at up to 15 months radiographic follow-up. The institution of the BRAF therapy was associated with development of severe rheumatoid-like arthritis in 2 patients which persisted for months after discontinuation of therapy, suggesting it was not merely a known toxicity of BRAF inhibitors (arthralgias). On immunologic analysis, these patients had high levels of non-T-regulatory, CD4 positive effector phenotype T-cells, which persisted after completion of therapy. Of note, we had previously reported a similar phenomenon in patients with metastatic melanoma who failed high dose interleukin-2 and were then placed on a finite course of temozolomide with rapid complete responses that have remained durable for many years after discontinuation of temozolomide. We postulate that a finite course of cytotoxic or targeted therapy specific for melanoma given after apparent failure of prior immunotherapy can result in complete and durable remissions that may persist long after the specific cytotoxic or targeted agents have been discontinued suggesting the existence of sequence specific synergism between immunotherapy and these agents. Here, we discuss these cases in the context of the literature on synergy between conventional or targeted cytotoxic therapy and immunotherapy in cancer treatment. ",

Patients with clinically positive nodes (stage III) should undergo therapeutic lymphadenectomy; however, the surgical approach to the regional disease in patients with negative clinical examination (stage I and II) is still controversial. Selective lymphadenectomy consists of the intraoperative identification of the first node in the nodal basin, the sentinel lymph node (SLN). Routine examination, serial sectioning, and immunohistochemistry may underestimate the presence of tumor cells. PCR is a molecular biology technique that may be useful for the detection of malignant melanoma nodal metastases in the SLN.;The aim of this study was to use tyrosinase messenger RNA (mRNA) amplification for the detection of micrometastases in fresh frozen SLNs.;46 hematoxylin-eosin (HE)-negative sentinel node samples from 42 patients with malignant melanoma were included in this study. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections were immunostained with S-100 protein and HMB-45. A central portion of the node was submitted for PCR. This method was accomplished with a combination of reverse transcription and amplification of the tyrosinase complementary DNA and double- round PCR (nested reverse transcriptase [RT]-PCR).;In 1 of the 42 SLN-negative patients, immunohistochemistry stains allowed the detection of micrometastases. With molecular biology, 14 of the 42 SLN patients were positive (33%); in another 12 (29%), only the nested RT-PCR was positive. Of the 42 patients, 24 were put into 3 groups and followed for a 5-year period with 1, 7, and 16 patients, respectively, in the groups.

Thirty-three patients had been treated with a BRAFi before ipi-based therapy (BRAFi-first), and 31 patients had been treated with ipi-based therapy first (ipi-first). In patients treated with a BRAFi first (n=33), the best response on sequential ipi-based therapy was three complete responses and six partial responses (best objective response rate of 27%). In patients treated with ipi-based therapy first (n=31), the best response on ipi-based therapy was 0 complete response and four partial responses (best objective response rate of 13%). The response rate did not differ significantly between the two groups (P=0.14).

A new specific small molecule inhibitor of BRAF(V600E) , PLX3603, showed potent melanoma growth-inhibiting characteristics in preclinical studies and is currently under clinical investigation. In this study we investigated the feasibility of (18) F-FDG and (18) F-FLT-PET to monitor the early effects of the BRAF(V600E) inhibitor in mice with melanoma xenografts. SCID/beige mice with subcutaneous (s.c.) A375 melanoma xenografts, expressing BRAF(V600E) , received the BRAF(V600E) inhibitor twice daily orally (0, 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg). At 1, 3 and 7 days after start of therapy, the uptake of (18) F-FDG and (18) F-FLT in the tumor and normal tissues was determined in ex vivo tissue samples. Serial (18) F-FDG and (18) F-FLT-PET scans were acquired of animals at 1 day before and 1, 3 and 7 days after start of treatment with 75 mg/kg BRAF(V600E) inhibitor. A dose-dependent decrease in (18) F-FDG uptake in the A375 tumors was observed by ex vivo biodistribution analysis. Administration of 75 mg/kg BRAF inhibitor for 1, 3 and 7 days resulted in a significantly decreased (18) F-FDG uptake in A375 tumors (41, 35 and 51%, respectively). (18) F-FLT uptake in the A375 tumors was low at baseline and no significant changes in (18) F-FLT uptake were observed at any of the doses administered. These effects were corroborated by serial in vivo (18) F-FDG and (18) F-FLT-PET imaging.

In this study, we developed a BRAFV600E-driven murine model of melanoma, SM1, which is syngeneic to fully immunocompetent mice. SM1 cells exposed to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032) showed partial in vitro and in vivo sensitivity resulting from the inhibition of MAPK pathway signaling. Combined treatment of vemurafenib plus adoptive cell transfer therapy with lymphocytes genetically modified with a T-cell receptor (TCR) recognizing chicken ovalbumin (OVA) expressed by SM1-OVA tumors or pmel-1 TCR transgenic lymphocytes recognizing gp100 endogenously expressed by SM1 resulted in superior antitumor responses compared with either therapy alone. T-cell analysis showed that vemurafenib did not significantly alter the expansion, distribution, or tumor accumulation of the adoptively transferred cells. However, vemurafenib paradoxically increased mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, in vivo cytotoxic activity, and intratumoral cytokine secretion by adoptively transferred cells. Taken together, our findings, derived from 2 independent models combining BRAF-targeted therapy with immunotherapy, support the testing of this therapeutic combination in patients with BRAFV600 mutant metastatic melanoma.",

The bright population had 85%-90% of cells expressing B7-1; the dim population had less than 50% of cells with B7-1 expression. Chromosome analysis with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and G-banding showed that 70% of bright cells had two main integration sites, with extensive amplification of the transgene. The dim population had random signal distribution, with little or no amplification, despite G418 selection. Because B7-1 has been mapped to 3q21, FISH was performed using a chromosome 3 painting probe (WCP) together with a probe for B7-1. In transfected bright M-21 cells, amplified genes that hybridized with the B7-1 construct were localized to chromosome 3 material inserted into marker chromosomes.

We found that the pattern of chromosomal aberrations is similar in the two subgroups; however, alterations present only in primary and/or metastatic tumors were also discovered. The mean number of genetic changes was 6.3 (range 1-14) in primary and 7.8 (range 1-16) in metastatic lesions. Frequent losses involved 9p and 10q, whereas gains most often occurred at 1q, 6p, 7q, and 8q. Distinct, high-level amplifications were mapped to 1p12-p21 and 1p22-p31 in both tumor types. Amplification of 4q12-q13.1, 7q21.3-qter and 8q23-qter were detected only in primary tumors. The 20q13-qter amplicon was present in a metastatic tumor. The number of genetic alterations were significantly higher in primary tumors which developed metastases within one year after the surgery compared to tumors without metastasis during this time period. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with centromeric and locus-specific probes was applied to validate CGH results on a subset of tumors. Comparison of FISH and CGH data gave good correlation.

Given that large deletions involving CDKN2A (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A) account for only 2% of cases, we describe a family that highlights the co-occurrence of both melanoma and neural system tumours to aid clinical recognition and propose a management strategy. A patient with multiple neurofibromas was referred with a provisional diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Prior molecular testing, though, had failed to identify an NF1 mutation by sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. His family history was significant for multiple in situ/malignant melanomas at young ages and several different cancers reminiscent of an underlying syndrome. A search of the Familial Cancer Database, FaCD Online, highlighted several families with cutaneous melanoma and nervous system tumours who were subsequently identified to have large deletions spanning CDKN2A. Although sequencing of CDKN2A and TP53 failed to identify a mutation, a heterozygous CDKN2A deletion was identified by targeted array comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH). Whole-genome oligonucleotide array CGH and SNP analysis identified an interstitial deletion of at least 1.5 Mb within 9p21.3 and spanning approximately 25 genes. Identification of the underlying molecular abnormality permits predictive testing for at-risk relatives. Given the young cancer diagnoses, a surveillance regimen was developed and a clinical team organised for ongoing management so that genetic testing could be offered to both adults and minor children. Surveillance recommendations addressed cancer risks associated with FAMMM, and other cancers exhibited by this family with a large contiguous gene deletion.",

It holds particular promise in BRAF V600E mutation-positive malignant melanoma, where constitutive activation and cell growth through the MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway is well established. In vitro and preclinical research indicates that MAPK pathway activation is important in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) leukemogenesis; however, the potential of MEK inhibition has not yet been investigated clinically in the setting of such hematologic malignancies.;We report a case of complete hematologic response of CML to MEK inhibition in a patient with synchronous metastatic melanoma, who received treatment with combination BRAF and MEK1/2 inhibitors. We studied the effects of these agents on proliferation and outgrowth of myeloid precursors, and longitudinal shifts in peripheral blood phenotyping during the course of treatment. A model cell line system was used to examine the effects of dabrafenib and trametinib on MAPK and BCR-ABL1 signaling.;After 35 weeks on treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors, complete hematologic response was observed without recourse to BCR-ABL1-targeted therapy. MEK inhibition was principally responsible for impaired proliferation of both mature and primitive myeloid precursors, as well as growth and hemoglobinization of erythroid precursors. Paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway was seen in response to BRAF inhibitor therapy but this was easily overcome by clinically relevant doses of concurrent MEK inhibitor.;These studies suggest that further evaluation of the optimal MAPK targeting approach is warranted to extend therapeutic options in CML.",

All those mutations are activating, with a single substitution (T1796A) at codon 599 (V599E) accounting for over 90%. To investigate the stage in which those mutations occur in the currently proposed sequential malignant transformation of melanocytes, 22 benign melanocytic nevi, 23 melanocytic atypical nevi, and 25 primary cutaneous melanoma from 63 different patients were examined for BRAF mutations using DNA extracted from microdissected formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues, and a two-round PCR-RFLP-based strategy. A subset of samples was sequenced for mutation confirmation. Sixteen benign (73%) and eleven atypical (52%) melanocytic nevi, and thirteen melanoma (56%) demonstrated BRAF mutations at codon 599, and no statistically significant differences were detected among all three types of lesions. No mutations were demonstrated in microdissected epidermal keratinocytes adjacent to melanocytic lesions having BRAF mutations. No correlation was detected between BRAF mutational status and age, sun exposure, and Clark's level in malignant melanoma. However, comparing only atypical nevi and melanoma lesions the frequency of BRAF mutation is significantly greater in male (78%) than female (35%) patients (P = 0.0194). The previously described T1796A point mutation was detected in 17 of 18 mutated samples, and a novel mutation consisting of a substitution of valine for lysine (GT1795-96AA) was detected in one melanoma case. Our findings of a high frequency of BRAF mutations at codon 599 in benign melanocytic lesions of the skin indicate that this mutation is not sufficient by itself for malignant transformation.",

Our aim was to investigate COLD-PCR (co-amplification at lower denaturation temperature-PCR) as a new approach for the pre-analytical enrichment of the BRAFV600E variant in formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) melanoma tissues.;COLD-PCR was used to selectively amplify BRAFV600E minority alleles from mixtures of wild-type and mutated sequences, and from biological samples. The method shows higher specificity than other conventional PCR-based methods in detecting somatic mutations.;We used COLD-PCR to increase the theoretical sensitivity of three different post-PCR methods: sequencing, pyrosequencing and HRMA. The gain in sensitivity seems to be more evident for HRMA, which allows the detection of 3.1% mutated alleles.

Evaluation of this revealed the cause to be massive myelopoiesis due to ectopic granulocyte/ colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) production by the melanoma cells. Because of these observations linking G-CSF expression with metastasis of human melanoma, we decided to investigate the mechanism of this ectopic production. No gross amplification or rearrangement of the G-CSF gene could be detected as the basis for the increased transcriptional activity in any of these lines. Human-human somatic cell hybridization studies carried out between the metastatic C8161 and several different nonmetastatic non-G-CSF-expressing lines revealed, in addition to metastatic dominance, 3- to 10-fold enhancement of G-CSF transcription and expression in the fusions compared with C8161 itself. The suggestion of a trans-dominant mechanism was further supported by transfection studies with a human G-CSF promoter-CAT-reporter construct, which revealed 3- to 5-fold increased reporter activity in only those melanoma lines and hybrids expressing G-CSF. Furthermore, no obvious autocrine or paracrine effects of this ectopic G-CSF expression on the melanoma lines' growth or metastasis were apparent, as all of the G-CSF-expressing lines lacked the G-CSF receptor and injections of purified recombinant G-CSF exerted no stimulatory effects on their tumorigenicity, latency, growth, or metastasis in Scid mice. Thus, we advance the hypothesis that G-CSF expression is serving as a marker of a more generalized trans-dominant pathway linked to tumor progression and metastasis. This hypothesis has direct relevance to many human cancers where ectopic hormone or growth factor production occurs with no obvious autocrine or paracrine benefit to the tumor.",

Human endogenous retrovirus (HERV)-K with 5'LTR-gag-pro-pol-env-rec/np9-3'LTR sequences represents the newest retrovirus family that integrated into the human genome 1 to 5 million years ago. Although a high-level expression of HERV-K in melanomas, breast cancers, and teratocarcinomas has been demonstrated, the mechanism of the lineage-specific activation of the long terminal repeat (LTR) remains obscure. We studied chromosomal HERV-K expression in MeWo melanoma cells in comparison with the basal expression in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. Cloned LTR of HERV-K (HML-2.HOM) was also characterized by mutation and transactivation experiments. We detected multiple transcriptional initiator (Inr) sites in the LTR by rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends (5' RACE). HEK293 and MeWo showed different Inr usage. The most potent Inr was associated with a TATA box and three binding motifs of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). Both chromosomal HERV-K expression and the cloned LTR function were strongly activated in HEK293 by transfection with MITF-M, a melanocyte/melanoma-specific isoform of MITF. Coexpression of MITF and the HERV-K core antigen was detected in retinal pigmented epithelium by an immunofluorescence analysis. Although malignant melanoma lines MeWo, G361, and SK-MEL-28 showed enhanced HERV-K transcription compared with normal melanocytes, the level of MITF-M messenger RNA persisted from normal to transformed melanocytes. Thus, MITF-M may be a prerequisite for the pigmented cell lineage-specific function of HERV-K LTR, leading to the high-level expression in malignant melanomas.",

The staining intensity was categorized as: 0 (no staining); 1 (weak); 2 (moderate) and 3 (strong). These two categories were multiplied together to obtain the HSP-27 expression score.

These alterations may result from inaccurate chromosomal segregation during mitosis, which can occur through several mechanisms including defective telomere metabolism, centrosome amplification, dysfunctional centromeres, and/or defective spindle checkpoint control. In this work, we used an in vitro murine melanoma model that uses a cellular adhesion blockade as a transforming factor to characterize telomeric and centromeric alterations that accompany melanocyte transformation. To study the timing of the occurrence of telomere shortening in this transformation model, we analyzed the profile of telomere length by quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization and found that telomere length significantly decreased as additional rounds of cell adhesion blockages were performed. Together with it, an increase in telomere-free ends and complex karyotypic aberrations were also found, which include Robertsonian fusions in 100% of metaphases of the metastatic melanoma cells. These findings are in agreement with the idea that telomere length abnormalities seem to be one of the earliest genetic alterations acquired in the multistep process of malignant transformation and that telomere abnormalities result in telomere aggregation, breakage-bridge-fusion cycles, and CIN. Another remarkable feature of this model is the abundance of centromeric instability manifested as centromere fragments and centromeric fusions. Taken together, our results illustrate for this melanoma model CIN with a structural signature of centromere breakage and telomeric loss.",

A lack of head-to-head randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing targeted and immunotherapies leaves uncertainty regarding optimal first-line treatment.;To estimate the relative efficacy and safety of systemic therapies for advanced, treatment-naive, BRAF-mutated melanoma.;We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials for phase 2 or 3 RCTs published up until April 29, 2016.;We included RCTs in which at least 1 intervention was a targeted (BRAF or MEK) or an immune checkpoint (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 [CTLA-4] or programmed cell death 1 [PD-1]) inhibitor.;Two reviewers performed study selection, data abstraction, and risk of bias assessment. We performed a Bayesian network meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model to combine direct comparisons with indirect evidence. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), and odds ratios (OR) for objective response rate (ORR) and serious adverse events.;Sixteen eligible articles reporting 15 RCTs involving 6662 patients assigned to 1 of 10 treatment strategies were included. Both BRAF/MEK and PD-1 were associated with improved OS benefit compared with all other treatments except CTLA-4/granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. There was no significant difference in OS between BRAF/MEK and PD-1 (HR, 1.02; 95% credible interval [CrI], 0.72-1.45). The network meta-analysis showed a significant advantage of BRAF/MEK compared with all other treatment strategies for PFS. BRAF/MEK was associated with higher ORR (OR, 2.00; 95% CrI, 1.64-2.45) compared with BRAF alone, with both being superior in achieving ORR compared with other treatments. Chemotherapy and PD-1 were associated with lowest risk of serious adverse events. There was no significant difference in the risk of serious adverse events between chemotherapy and PD-1 (OR, 1.00; 95% CrI, 0.74-1.34).;Compared with other treatments, BRAF/MEK and PD-1 inhibition significantly improved OS.

Coincident with extrapulmonary metastasis, there is a dramatic amplification of visible lung metastases, with death generally resulting from extensive lung metastasis. The progression of lung metastasis, and lung colonization initiated by intravenous injection of tumor cells, was investigated using B16 melanoma clone G3.12. Analysis of the growth of invisible metastases in organ culture explants of lung revealed that tumors continually disseminated relatively small numbers of lung metastases after reaching a size of about 6 mm in diameter. However, most terminal-stage lung metastases, along with all extrapulmonary metastases, apparently arise from a secondary spread of tumor cells from tumor-derived lung metastases 1-2 mm in size. Individual lung colonies, initiated with G3.12 cells bound to single microbeads, also disseminated large numbers of secondary lung colonies, as well as extrapulmonary colonies, at a 1- to 2-mm size. The mechanism for intrapulmonary spread of secondary metastases and colonies is unclear, but the consequence appears to be a secondary stage of intrapulmonary and extrapulmonary metastasis with selection for tumor cells with rapid growth rates.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Previous studies have suggested that increased malignant potential might be related to increased genomic instability, but this issue still remains controversial. We tested this hypothesis in a human tumour spontaneous metastasis model, using six clones and variants isolated from the parental poorly metastatic M4Be melanoma cell line, and expressing various metastatic abilities. The spontaneous rates of mutation to ouabain resistance measured in these cells by Luria and Delbrück fluctuation analysis correlated with the metastatic ability of the cells: moderately and highly metastatic cells showed spontaneous mutation rates 10 to 50 times higher than those of poorly metastatic cells. Genomic instability at the chromosome level was assessed by searching for accumulated structural abnormalities in the moderately and highly metastatic cell lines. All the cell lines appeared hypertriploid, and showed comparable modal numbers and great chromosome dispersion. Unstable DNA amplification in the form of double minute chromosomes was shown in one of the four poorly metastatic cell lines, and in a significantly higher proportion of the cells of two of the three metastatic cell lines. Abnormal chromosomes were demonstrated in all cell lines, with markers involving specific rearrangements of chromosomes 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14 and 15, as frequently observed in human melanoma cells. Clonal markers were present in all cell lines, documenting the common origin of all variants and clones, and specific marker amplification was noticed in highly metastatic cells compared to poorly metastatic lines. These results suggest that human tumour progression might be accompanied both by an increase in genomic instability and by accumulation of karyotypic abnormalities.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited GlaxoSmithKline, the manufacturer of dabrafenib, to submit evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of dabrafenib for the treatment of unresectable, advanced or metastatic BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma in accordance with the Institute's Single Technology Appraisal (STA) process. The Liverpool Reviews and Implementation Group (LRiG) at the University of Liverpool was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article summarizes the ERG's review of the evidence submitted by the company and provides a summary of the Appraisal Committee's (AC) final decision in October 2014. The clinical evidence for dabrafenib was derived from an ongoing phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international, multicentre clinical trial (BREAK-3) involving 230 patients randomized 2:1 to receive either dabrafenib or dacarbazine. A significant improvement in median progression-free survival (PFS) but not overall survival (OS) was reported in the dabrafenib arm compared with dacarbazine. Vemurafenib is considered a more appropriate comparator than is dacarbazine. The clinical evidence for vemurafenib was derived from a completed phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international, multicentre clinical trial (BRIM-3) involving 675 patients randomized 1:1 to receive either vemurafenib or dacarbazine. A significant improvement in median PFS and OS was reported in the vemurafenib arm compared with dacarbazine. As there is no direct evidence comparing dabrafenib versus vemurafenib, the company presented an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) that demonstrated no statistical differences between dabrafenib and vemurafenib for PFS or OS. The ERG expressed concerns with the ITC, mainly in relation to the validity of the assumptions underpinning the methodology; the ERG concluded this resulted in findings that are unlikely to be robust or reliable. Dabrafenib and vemurafenib are both available to patients treated by the National Health Service (NHS) in England via a Patient Access Scheme (PAS) in which the costs of the drugs are discounted. Using these discounted costs, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) generated by the company were £60,980 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for dabrafenib versus dacarbazine and £11,046 per QALY gained for dabrafenib versus vemurafenib. The ERG considered the economic model structure developed by the company to derive the ICERs to be overly complex and based on unsubstantiated assumptions, most importantly in relation to the projection of OS. Applying the latest OS data from BREAK-3 to a less complex model structure increased the estimated ICER for dabrafenib compared with dacarbazine from £60,980 to £112,727 per QALY gained. Since the results from the ITC were considered by the ERG to be neither reliable nor robust, the ERG also considered a cost-effectiveness comparison to be inappropriate due to a lack of meaningful or reliable data. In spite of limitations in the data, the AC took the view that dabrafenib and vemurafenib were \"likely\" of similar clinical effectiveness. Since the overall costs of these two drugs were similar, the AC recommended the use of dabrafenib in patients with unresectable, advanced or metastatic BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma. ",

An important methodological finding was that high concentrations of reverse transcriptase or RNA sample inhibited the following PCR. This could be abolished by dilution of the cDNA sample before the PCR. Standard curves with a linear range over at least five logs were obtained with dilutions of melanoma cell cDNA. Controls (RNA and cDNA) consisting of melanoma cells (1000/ml) added to blood were analysed repeatedly over 3 months, resulting in means between 880 and 1074 AU/ml. The RNA controls were stable, whereas the cDNA controls, as well as the calibrators, showed a tendency to change over time. The variation in the RNA controls was 25% for tyrosinase and 22% for TRP-2. Seven stage III-IV melanoma patients were tested for tyrosinase and TRP-2 transcripts in blood drawn from a peripheral vein and from a Port-a-cath.

The significance of sarcoidal-type inflammation occurring during treatment of metastatic melanoma with a combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors is unclear.

We show that a subpopulation of primary human melanocytes with persistent expression of BRAF(V600E) do not enter oncogene-induced senescence, but instead survive despite heightened MAPK activity. Disruption of the p53 pathway using short-hairpin RNA initiated rapid growth of these V600E(+) melanocytes in vitro. The resultant V600E(+)/p53(sh) melanocytes grew anchorage-independently in soft agar, formed pigmented lesions reminiscent of in situ melanoma in artificial skin reconstructs, and were weakly tumorigenic in vivo. Array comparative genomic hybridization analysis demonstrated that the transformed melanocytes acquired a substantial deletion in chromosome 13, which encodes the Rb1 tumor suppressor gene. Gene expression profiling study of nevi and melanomas showed that p53 target genes were differentially expressed in melanomas compared with nevi, suggesting a dysfunctional p53 pathway in melanoma in vivo. In summary, these data demonstrate that a subpopulation of melanocytes possesses the ability to survive BRAF(V600E)-induced senescence, and suggest that p53 inactivation may promote malignant transformation of these cells.",

Each new lesion was photographed, a clinical diagnosis recorded and, where appropriate, a biopsy taken. Human papillomavirus (HPV) and p16 immunohistochemistry analyses were performed.;The most frequently observed lesions were verrucal keratotic squamoproliferative lesions (49%), Grover's disease (27%) and reactive hyperkeratotic lesions on the soles, at points of friction (22%). Eighteen squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) occurred in 20% of patients. Most SCCs appeared between weeks 6 and 24 following commencement of therapy on both sun-damaged and nonsun-damaged skin. All SCCs were well differentiated, five were of the keratoacanthoma type, and two were SCC in situ. Other lesions observed included seborrhoeic keratoses, epidermal cysts, acneiform eruptions, hair loss and changes in hair structure. HPV was negative in 15 of the 16 tissues studied and p16 expression was higher in SCCs compared with verrucal keratoses.;Administration of the mutant BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib is associated with induction of keratinocytic proliferation, which in some cases develops features of low-grade malignancy. Highly oncogenic HPV infection is unlikely to be a contributor to the formation of SCCs or verrucal keratoses.",

BRAF mutation is seen in melanoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma (including papillary thyroid carcinoma arising from ovarian teratoma), ovarian serous tumours, colorectal carcinoma, gliomas, hepatobiliary carcinomas and hairy cell leukaemia. In these cancers, various genetic aberrations of the BRAF proto-oncogene, such as different point mutations and chromosomal rearrangements, have been reported. The most common mutation, BRAF V600E, can be detected by DNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry on formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tumour tissue. Detection of BRAF V600E mutation has the potential for clinical use as a diagnostic and prognostic marker. In addition, a great deal of research effort has been spent in strategies inhibiting its activity. Indeed, recent clinical trials involving BRAF selective inhibitors exhibited promising response rates in metastatic melanoma patients. Clinical trials are underway for other cancers. However, cutaneous side effects of treatment have been reported and therapeutic response to cancer is short-lived due to the emergence of several resistance mechanisms. In this review, we give an update on the clinical pathological relevance of BRAF mutation in cancer. It is hoped that the review will enhance the direction of future research and assist in more effective use of the knowledge of BRAF mutation in clinical practice.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Constitutive ERK activation is a common finding in human cancer and is often the result of activating mutations of BRAF and RAS. BRAF missense mutations occur in approximately 8% of human tumors, most frequently in melanoma, papillary thyroid cancer and colon cancer. Mutations in BRAF have been found predominantly in tumors in which RAS is commonly mutated but concurrent mutations of both BRAF and RAS are extremely rare. Though over 40 different kinase domain mutations in BRAF have been identified, a single base-pair substitution in exon 15 at codon 600 (V600E) is found in over 80% of cases. These mutations cluster in the glycine-rich loop and activation segments of the kinase and are predicted to induce kinase activation by disrupting the inhibitory glycine-rich loop/activation segment interaction which characterizes the inactive conformation. The majority of mutations identified cause constitutive kinase activation with the V600E mutation demonstrating approximately 500-fold greater kinase activity than wild-type BRAF. Supporting its classification as an oncogene, V600E BRAF stimulates ERK signaling, induces proliferation and is capable in model systems of promoting transformation. However, BRAF mutations are common in nevi and colon polyps suggesting that BRAF mutation alone is insufficient for tumorigenesis and additional mutations are required for cancer development. Though such data suggest that BRAF mutation is likely an early initiating event in tumors such as melanoma and colon cancer, preclinical studies suggest that tumors with V600E BRAF mutation remain dependent upon BRAF for proliferation and survival. Given its frequent occurrence in human cancer and the continued requirement for BRAF activity in tumors with BRAF mutation, efforts are underway to develop targeted inhibitors of BRAF and its downstream effectors. The first generation of RAF inhibitors, including sorafenib, were notable for their lack of specificity and potency for RAF and these agents have shown limited efficacy in tumors with a high incidence of BRAF mutation such as melanoma. Novel inhibitors of the pathway with greater selectivity for BRAF and MEK are now in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials with promising early results. To maximize the likelihood of success with these agents, clinical trials enriched with patients whose tumors possess BRAF and RAS mutations have been proposed.",

Implantation of the transduced DCs, depletion of immune cells as well as the survival of the mice after tumour challenge were investigated. High efficiency of gene transfer into mature DCs was achieved. The high level expression of the functional antigen (TRP-2) and induction of protective immunity by adoptive transfer of TRP-2 gene modified DCs were demonstrated. In vivo study showed a complete protection of mice from further melanoma cell challenge. In comparison, only 83% of mice survived when mTRP-2 peptide-pulsed DCs were administered, suggesting the generation of specific protection.

Signalling pathways known to be disrupted in UM include: (1) the retinoblastoma pathway, probably as a result of cyclin D1 overexpression; p53 signalling, possibly as a consequence of MDM2 overexpression; and the P13K/AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-related kinase pathway pathways that are disturbed as a result of PTEN and GNAQ/11 mutations, respectively. Characteristic chromosomal abnormalities are common and include 6p gain, associated with a good prognosis, as well as 1p loss, 3 loss, and 8q gain, which correlate with high mortality. These are identified by techniques such as fluorescence in situ hybridisation, comparative genomic hybridisation, microsatellite analysis, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. UM can also be categorised by their gene expression profiles as class 1 or class 2, the latter correlating with poor survival, as do BRCA1-associated protein-1 (BAP1) inactivating mutations. Genetic testing of UM has enhanced prognostication, especially when results are integrated with histological and clinical data.

All neoplastic melanocytes within such a nevus would be expected to carry the BRAF mutation, and thus we evaluated the frequency of cells with BRAF(V600E) mutations within acquired nevi by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction. In BRAF-mutant nevi the number of BRAF mutant alleles equaled the number of wild-type (WT) alleles in the neoplastic cell population, consistent with a fully clonal heterozygous BRAF mutation. The allelic ratio of BRAF(V600E) to BRAF(WT) in the eight VE1-positive nevi, adjusted for degree of stromal contamination, ranged from 0.84 to 1.12 with an average ratio of 1.01. This was confirmed by immunohistochemistry with an antibody specific for BRAF(V600E), which uniformly labeled the neoplastic cells without any evidence of heterogeneity. We found BRAF(V600E) mutations in the melanocytic nevi to be fully clonal, strongly suggesting that BRAF-activating mutations typically are early initiating events in melanocytic neoplasia.",

Thus, there is a pressing need for identification of combinations of targeted agents which induce more complete responses and prevent disease progression. We describe the results of a combination screen of an unprecedented scale in mammalian cells performed using a collection of targeted, clinically tractable agents across a large panel of melanoma cell lines. We find that even the most synergistic drug pairs are effective only in a discrete number of cell lines, underlying a strong context dependency for synergy, with strong, widespread synergies often corresponding to non-specific or off-target drug effects such as multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) transporter inhibition. We identified drugs sensitizing cell lines that are BRAFV600E mutant but intrinsically resistant to BRAF inhibitor PLX4720, including the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor/kinase insert domain receptor (VEGFR/KDR) and platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) family inhibitor cediranib. The combination of cediranib and PLX4720 induced apoptosis in vitro and tumor regression in animal models. This synergistic interaction is likely due to engagement of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), demonstrating the potential of drug- rather than gene-specific combination discovery approaches. Patients with elevated biopsy KDR expression showed decreased progression free survival in trials of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase pathway inhibitors. Thus, high-throughput unbiased screening of targeted drug combinations, with appropriate library selection and mechanistic follow-up, can yield clinically-actionable drug combinations. ",

These findings suggest KIT as a potential target for therapy with imatinib mesylate in these melanomas. To date, data on the KIT status in uveal melanoma (UM) is limited.;We analyzed the expression of the KIT protein (CD117, c-kit) and its ligand, stem cell factor (SCF), in primary and metastatic UM.;By immunohistochemistry, SCF-positive tumor cells (>90%) were detectable in 43% of primary UM and in 58% of UM metastases. Strong expression of KIT (>90%) in tumor cells was present in 55% of primary UM and in 76% of UM metastases. This overexpression of both KIT and SCF suggests the clinical application of imatinib mesylate in metastatic UM. This notion was tested in a clinical study using Simon's two-stage design. Patients received imatinib (600 mg p.o. daily) until progress or unacceptable toxicities. The trial did not enter stage II as no objective response was observed in the first group. This observation prompted further molecular analysis, which revealed no mutations in the genomic sequence of KIT in exons 11, 13, 17, and 18. Moreover, the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway was not activated in any of the tumors as measured by ERK phosphorylation.;These results show the lack of clinical effectiveness of imatinib in UM, which was originally anticipated based on the high levels of KIT and SCF expression.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The coexistence of tumor specific immunity with a progressing tumor remains a major paradox of tumor immunology. This enigma is most evident in partially regressing melanomas, where efficient eradication of tumor cells is closely linked to uncontrolled tumor growth. Mechanisms involved in this differential susceptibility of tumor cells to the host immune response may include altered production of immunosuppressive cytokines, i.e., transforming growth factor (TGF) beta or interleukin (IL) 10. Since only limited amounts of tissue samples are available from primary tumors, a semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was established which allowed to estimate the amount of cytokine mRNA expressed in a small number of melanoma cells segregated by indirect immunomagnetic isolation. Thereby, we determined the expression of TGF-beta 1 and IL-10 mRNA in melanoma cells obtained from regressing and progressing areas of 9 primary tumors. TGF-beta 1 mRNA could be detected in all undiluted samples from progressing areas and in 7 samples from regression zones. Titration of the sample revealed that in 6 cases TGF-beta 1 mRNA could be detected at a significant higher titer in progressing than in regressing areas. IL-10 mRNA was present in 8 samples obtained from progressing and in 7 samples from regressing tumor areas. In 6 tumors IL-10 mRNA was detectable at a higher titer in the progression zones. Specificity of the PCR amplification was confirmed with a series of restriction enzyme digestions of the resulting PCR product. Based on these findings the hypothesis that immunosuppressive cytokines, such as TGF-beta 1 or IL-10, represent important factors for the melanoma cells to escape immune surveillance is supported.",

        "Doc_abstract":"In recent years, large discrepancies were described in the success rate of the tyrosinase reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detecting melanoma cells in the peripheral blood of melanoma patients. We present a quality control study in which we analysed the reproducibility of detection of tyrosinase and MART-1 transcripts in 106 blood samples from 68 melanoma patients (mainly stages III and IV). With this study, we aimed to improve insight in the reproducibility of a RT-PCR for the detection of (minimal) amounts of circulating melanoma cells. We performed two reverse transcriptions on each mRNA sample and performed tyrosinase and MART-1 nested PCRs in duplicate per cDNA sample. Thus, four tyrosinase and four MART-1 measurements were performed per blood sample. In our study, the majority of blood samples was negative for tyrosinase (80%) or MART-1 (66%). Only four samples were positive in all four determinations for tyrosinase and seven for MART-1. Variable results (1-3 times positive results) were obtained for tyrosinase and MART-1 in 16% and 27% respectively. MART-1 PCR had a better performance than tyrosinase PCR. Sensitivity increased when both markers were used. We reasoned that the low number of melanoma marker PCR-positive blood samples can be explained by differences in mRNA quality. By using real-time quantitative PCR, we found that this was not the case: amplification of porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), a low copy household gene, was not different in blood samples in which a melanoma marker was not detected from groups in which this marker was detected more or less consistently (1-4 times). When applying real-time quantitative PCR for tyrosinase and MART-1, we found that a low amount of SK-MEL-28 cell equivalents was present in the blood of melanoma patients, with a higher number of equivalents in the group with a consistently positive result. We conclude that low reproducibility of a repeated assay for the detection of circulating melanoma cells is not caused by differences in mRNA quality between the samples, but due to low numbers of amplifiable target mRNA molecules in the mRNA sample. Use of more than one marker and repetition of the assay will increase the probability of finding positive PCR results.",

BRAF(V600E) induces centrosome amplification and spindle abnormalities that result in aneuploidy. We find modification of Mps1 is critical for contributing to centrosome amplification and chromosome instability induced by BRAF(V600E). Phosphorylation of Mps1 at residue S281 induced by BRAF(V600E) stabilizes Mps1 protein by preventing its ubiquitination by APC/C and subsequent degradation, allowing the non-degraded protein to accumulate at centrosomes. Cells in which endogenous Mps1 was replaced with a phospho-mimetic Mps1 mutant are viable but amplify centrosomes and missegregate chromosomes frequently. Importantly, analysis of tumor micro arrays revealed that phospho-MAPK and S281-phosphorylated Mps1 were highly correlated in human melanoma tissues, implying that MAPK contributes to defects in the degradation of Mps1 in situ. We propose that continuously activated BRAF(V600E) signaling may be a possible mechanism for the deregulation of Mps1 stability and kinase activity in human tumors, and that persistent phosphorylation of Mps1 through BRAF(V600E) signaling is a key event in disrupting the control of centrosome duplication and chromosome stability that may contribute to tumorigenesis.

Here we demonstrate a \"synthetic lethal\" interaction between oncogenic BRAF V600E and a ketogenic enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase (HMGCL). HMGCL expression is upregulated in BRAF V600E-expressing human primary melanoma and hairy cell leukemia cells. Suppression of HMGCL specifically attenuates proliferation and tumor growth potential of human melanoma cells expressing BRAF V600E. Mechanistically, active BRAF upregulates HMGCL through an octamer transcription factor Oct-1, leading to increased intracellular levels of HMGCL product, acetoacetate, which selectively enhances binding of BRAF V600E but not BRAF wild-type to MEK1 in V600E-positive cancer cells to promote activation of MEK-ERK signaling. These findings reveal a mutation-specific mechanism by which oncogenic BRAF V600E \"rewires\" metabolic and cell signaling networks and signals through the Oct-1-HMGCL-acetoacetate axis to selectively promote BRAF V600E-dependent tumor development.

The introductions of immunotherapy and targeted therapies have tremendously improved the treatment of melanoma. Selective inhibition of BRAF by vemurafenib results in objective clinical responses in around 50 % of patients suffering from BRAFV600 mutated melanoma. However, drug resistance often results in hampering long-term tumor control. Alternatively, immunotherapy by vaccination with natural dendritic cells (nDCs) demonstrated long-term tumor control in a proportion of patients. We postulate that the rapid tumor debulking by vemurafenib can synergize the long-term tumor control of nDC vaccination to result in an effective treatment modality in a large proportion of patients. Here, we investigated the feasibility of this combination by analyzing the effect of vemurafenib on the functionality of nDCs.;Plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and myeloid DCs (mDCs) were isolated from PBMCs obtained from buffy coats from healthy volunteers or vemurafenib-treated melanoma patients. Maturation of pDCs, mDCs and immature monocyte-derived DCs was induced by R848 in the presence or absence of vemurafenib and analyzed by FACS. Cytokine production and T cell proliferation induced by mature DCs were analyzed.;Vemurafenib inhibited maturation and cytokine production of highly purified nDCs of healthy volunteers resulting in diminished allogeneic T cell proliferation. This deleterious effect of vemurafenib on nDC functionality was absent when total PBMCs were exposed to vemurafenib. In patients receiving vemurafenib, nDC functionality and T cell allostimulatory capacity were unaffected.;Although vemurafenib inhibited the functionality of purified nDC of healthy volunteers, this effect was not observed when nDCs were matured in the complete PBMC fraction.

However, colon cancer patients harbouring the same BRAF(V600E) oncogenic lesion have poor prognosis and show only a very limited response to this drug. To investigate the cause of the limited therapeutic effect of PLX4032 in BRAF(V600E) mutant colon tumours, here we performed an RNA-interference-based genetic screen in human cells to search for kinases whose knockdown synergizes with BRAF(V600E) inhibition. We report that blockade of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) shows strong synergy with BRAF(V600E) inhibition. We find in multiple BRAF(V600E) mutant colon cancers that inhibition of EGFR by the antibody drug cetuximab or the small-molecule drugs gefitinib or erlotinib is strongly synergistic with BRAF(V600E) inhibition, both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we find that BRAF(V600E) inhibition causes a rapid feedback activation of EGFR, which supports continued proliferation in the presence of BRAF(V600E) inhibition. Melanoma cells express low levels of EGFR and are therefore not subject to this feedback activation. Consistent with this, we find that ectopic expression of EGFR in melanoma cells is sufficient to cause resistance to PLX4032. Our data suggest that BRAF(V600E) mutant colon cancers (approximately 8-10% of all colon cancers), for which there are currently no targeted treatment options available, might benefit from combination therapy consisting of BRAF and EGFR inhibitors.",

A third case had a V600E BRAF mutation. Using immunohistochemistry, c-Kit expression could be detected in all cases. The two cases with c-Kit mutations showed high c-Kit expression.

Currently, limited data exist on the sequencing of these agents in patients with the BRAFV600 mutation. The aim of this analysis was to identify factors that could potentially be used to optimise the order in which ipilimumab and BRAF inhibitors are administered in this patient population.;This was a retrospective, single-institution, analysis of patients treated with vemurafenib 960 mg or dabrafenib 150 mg twice-daily and ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses as part of a clinical trial or expanded access program. Eligible patients tested positive for the BRAFV600 mutation and had sequentially received treatment with vemurafenib or dabrafenib followed by ipilimumab, or vice versa.;In total, 34 BRAF-mutation positive patients were eligible, comprising six patients who received ipilimumab followed by a BRAF inhibitor, and 28 patients treated with a BRAF inhibitor who subsequently received ipilimumab. Of these 28 patients, 12 (43%) had rapid disease progression resulting in death and were unable to complete ipilimumab treatment as per protocol. These patients were classified as having rapid disease progression. Median overall survival for rapid progressors was 5.7 months (95% CI: 5.0-6.3), compared with 18.6 months (95% CI: 3.2-41.3; p < 0.0001) for those patients who were able to complete ipilimumab treatment. Baseline factors associated with rapid progression were elevated lactate dehydrogenase, a performance status of 1 and the presence of brain metastases. Patients were more likely to have rapid disease progression if they had at least two of these risk factors at baseline.;Our analysis suggests it may be possible to identify those patients at high risk of rapid disease progression upon relapse with a BRAF inhibitor who might not have time to subsequently complete ipilimumab treatment.

This problem has not yet been addressed systematically. Here we generated a photometric protocol to determine both the melanin and RNA concentration by correcting the latter for the absorption coefficient of melanin at 260 nm. Subsequently, different combinations of silica-based RNA-binding, size-exclusion, and ion-exchange columns were used in 8 protocols for isolation of RNA from melanoma tissue to compare efficacy of melanin removal and yield of RNA. Furthermore, the capability of the different RNA preparations to function as template in RT-PCRs with products of different length, i.e. GAP-DH, tyrosinase, and gp100, was tested. We found that the combination of silica-based RNA-binding and size-exclusion columns was not sufficient to remove melanin from highly contaminated tumor samples, and subsequent RT-PCR failed to give larger products. However, protocols including ion-exchange columns resulted in efficient removal of melanin, while retaining reasonable RNA yields in samples from highly pigmented melanomas. Efficient RT-PCR of larger products turned out to be inversely correlated to the melanin contamination. This RNA-purification method will help scientists to isolate polynucleotides from melanin-containing tumor samples, which subsequently can be used in antigen detection assays and vaccination strategies using amplified total tumor RNA.",

Comparative clonotype mapping demonstrated the presence of identical T-cell clonotypes in the tumors and the respective sentinel lymph nodes, only when tumor cells were present in the latter. However, taking advantage of clonotype specific PCR amplification, TCR sequences representing clonally expanded T cells at the tumor site could be detected in the lymph nodes draining the tumors even in the absence of tumor cells. Evidence for the tumor-specific characteristics of these cells was obtained by in situ staining with peptide/HLA class I complexes demonstrating the presence of MART-1/HLA-A2- and MAGE-3/HLA-A2-reactive T cells at the tumor site, as well as in the draining lymph node. Our data indicate that T-cell responses to melanoma are primed in the sentinel lymph node by cross presentation of tumor antigens by dendritic cells.",

Nowadays, two classes of molecules are approved by FDA. Multi-target molecules, such as Sorafenib and Regorafenib, and selective molecules, such as Vemurafenib and Dabrafenib. Many other molecules are still under investigation. Most of them are studied in phase 1 trials. Clinical studies correlate B-RAF inhibitors and QT prolongation. Though this cardiovascular side effect is not common using these drugs, it must be noticed early and recognize its signals. Indeed, Oncologists and Cardiologists should work in cooperation to prevent lethal events, such as fatal arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death.

Several normal and neoplastic human tissues have also been immunostained for LMP1, without any positive staining, with the exception of a minor percentage of skin melanocytes and of normal blasts of the myeloid and erythroid lineages. We conclude that the vast majority of nevi and melanomas express a still uncharacterised molecule, cross-reacting with anti-LMP1 (CS1-4) antibodies, which may be considered a consistent marker of melanocytic proliferations.

These mutations provide potentially valuable diagnostic, prognostic and treatment response prediction markers. A sensitive, specific, low-cost assay to detect these mutations is needed.;To detect BRAF V600E mutation in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, we developed a method using Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS)-PCR. This method was designed to amplify three products in a single reaction tube: a 200 bp common product serving as an amplification control, a 144 bp BRAF V600E specific product, and a 97 bp wild-type (wt) specific product. The sensitivity of this method was determined to be as low as 0.5% for the BRAF V600E allele in a wild-type background. This method was successfully validated in 72 thyroid tumors. It detected V600E mutation in 22 out of 33 (67%) of the conventional papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), 8 out of 12 (75%) of the tall-cell variant of PTC, whereas none of the 10 follicular variant of PTC showed BRAF V600E mutation. In addition, none of the 14 follicular adenomas and 3 follicular carcinomas had BRAF V600E mutation. As a comparison method, direct dideoxy sequencing found only 27 out of 30 (90%) mutations detected by ARMS-PCR method, suggesting that this ARMS-PCR method has higher sensitivity.;Our ARMS-PCR method provides a new tool for rapid detection of BRAF V600E mutation. Our results indicate that ARMS-PCR is more sensitive than automated dideoxy sequencing in detecting low BRAF V600E allele burdens in FFPE tumor specimen.

BRaf is activated by Ras proteins allowing Ras oncogenes to constitutively activate the pathway. Activating BRaf mutations are also frequent in several cancers, being the most common oncogenic mutation in thyroid carcinoma and melanoma. There are currently two inhibitors, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, approved for treatment of malignant melanoma having activating BRaf mutations. Concurrent administration of BRAF and MAP-ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor (trametinib) is significantly more active in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma than either single agent alone, but progression to resistance ultimately occurs by different mechanisms that increase the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Such adaptive changes in tumor cell signaling networks allow bypass of targeted oncoprotein inhibition. This is true with targeted inhibitors for BRaf and MEK as well as specific inhibitors for AKT, mTOR, and many receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGF receptor (EGFR) and HER2. It is this adaptive response to targeted kinase inhibitors that contributes to the failure of single-agent kinase inhibitors to have durable responses. This failure is seen in virtually all cancers treated with single-agent kinase inhibitors, most of which are not as dependent on a single signaling pathway such as BRaf-MEK-ERK in melanoma. Thus, understanding the breadth of adaptive reprogramming responses to specific targeted kinase inhibition will be critical to develop appropriate combination therapies for durable clinical responses.",

In BRAF WT cells and those with mutations that activate or result in high levels of the BRAF activator RAS, BRAF inhibition can lead to ERK activation, resulting in tumorigenic transformation. We describe a patient with malignant melanoma who developed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in the absence of RAS mutations during vemurafenib treatment. BRAF inhibition promoted patient CLL proliferation in culture and in murine xenografts and activated MEK/ERK in primary CLL cells from additional patients. BRAF inhibitor-driven ERK activity and CLL proliferation required B cell antigen receptor (BCR) activation, as inhibition of the BCR-proximal spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) reversed ERK hyperactivation and proliferation of CLL cells from multiple patients, while inhibition of the BCR-distal Bruton tyrosine kinase had no effect. Additionally, the RAS-GTP/RAS ratio in primary CLL cells exposed to vemurafenib was reduced upon SYK inhibition. BRAF inhibition increased mortality and CLL expansion in mice harboring CLL xenografts; however, SYK or MEK inhibition prevented CLL proliferation and increased animal survival. Together, these results suggest that BRAF inhibitors promote B cell malignancies in the absence of obvious mutations in RAS or other receptor tyrosine kinases and provide a rationale for combined BRAF/MEK or BRAF/SYK inhibition.

The BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib has demonstrated clinical efficacy in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant melanoma brain metastases and in other cancer diseases. Therefore the BRAF V600E mutation is a highly interesting oncological target in brain tumors.;This study assesses the BRAF V600E mutation status in 969 intracranial neoplasms using a tissue microarray method and immunohistochemical staining with the mutation-specific VE-1 antibody, followed by sequencing of positively stained cases.;Out of 784 primary brain tumors seven cases with a BRAF V600E mutation were detected (7/784, 1 %). Six of these cases were neuroepithelial tumors (6/667, 1 %) encompassing 2 astrocytomas WHO grade II (2/42, 5 %), 1 gliosarcoma WHO grade IV (1/75, 1 %) and 3 glioblastomas WHO grade IV (3/312, 1 %). Interestingly, all three mutant glioblastomas showed epithelioid histopathological features. Patients with V600E mutated astrocytic tumors were significantly younger (mean age 15.3 years) than wildtype cases (58.2 years). Among three rhabdoid meningiomas, one case was mutated (1/3) while all other grade I-III meningiomas (1/116, 1 %) and all fifty vestibular schwannomas analyzed were of wildtype status. The vast majority of the BRAF V600E mutations were found in cerebral metastases of malignant melanomas and carcinomas (29/135, 22 %), with false-positive staining found in four breast cancer cases and two non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) samples.;Our data suggest routine screening for BRAF V600E mutations for glioblastomas WHO grade IV below the age of 30, especially in glioblastomas with epithelioid features and in all rhabdoid meningiomas WHO grade III. For colorectal carcinoma, thyroid cancer, malignant melanoma and gliomas BRAF V600E immunostaining is sufficient for screening purposes. We also recommend routine immunohistochemical staining followed by sequencing validation in rare CNS metastases or metastases of unknown primary.

Because gain-of-function mutations of BRAF can transform fibroblasts, we examined BRAF in rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts. The strong gain-of-function mutation, V600R, of BRAF found in melanomas and other cancers was identified in first passage synovial fibroblasts from two of nine rheumatoid arthritis patients and confirmed by restriction site mapping. BRAF-specific siRNA inhibited proliferation of synovial fibroblasts with V600R mutations. A BRAF aberrant splice variant with an intact kinase domain and partial loss of the N-terminal autoinhibitory domain was identified in fibroblasts from an additional patient, and fibroblast proliferation was inhibited by BRAF-specific siRNA. Our finding is the first to establish mechanisms for fibroblast transformation responsible for destruction of articular cartilage and bone in rheumatoid arthritis and establishes a new target for therapeutic intervention.",

One possibility is that these broad events are a consequence of collateral damage from targeting single loci. Another possibility is that the loss of large regions permits the simultaneous repression of multiple tumor suppressors by broadly decreasing the resident gene dosage and expression. Here, we test this hypothesis in a targeted fashion using RNA interference to suppress multiple candidate residents in broad regions of loss. We find that loss of chromosome regions 6q, 10, and 11q21-ter is correlated with broadly decreased expression of most resident genes and that multiple resident genes impacted by broad regional loss of chromosome 10 are tumor suppressors capable of affecting tumor growth and/or invasion. We also provide additional functional support for Ablim1 as a novel tumor suppressor. Our results support the hypothesis that multiple cancer genes are targeted by regional chromosome copy number aberrations.",

Archival tissues were analyzed for microsatellite instability, PTEN status, and 487-gene sequencing. Patient-derived xenografts were established from core biopsy samples.;Of 43 patients, five (12%) achieved a partial response or better, including one (2%) complete response, with duration of response > 36 months; 24 patients (56%) achieved stable disease as best confirmed response. Ten patients (23%) remained in the study > 6 months. All nine evaluable during-treatment biopsies had reduced levels of phosphorylated ERK relative to pretreatment biopsies (average decrease ± standard deviation, 47% ± 24%). Mutational analysis revealed that the patient achieving a complete response and two of three evaluable patients achieving a partial response had PIK3CA mutations. Neither PTEN loss nor microsatellite instability correlated with efficacy. Responses to dabrafenib plus trametinib were comparable in patient-derived xenograft-bearing mice and the biopsied lesions from each corresponding patient.;The combination of dabrafenib plus trametinib has activity in a subset of patients with BRAF V600-mutant mCRC. Mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling was inhibited in all patients evaluated, but to a lesser degree than observed in BRAF-mutant melanoma with dabrafenib alone.

Recently, seminal clinical trials have provided indisputable evidence that BRAF inhibitors improve response rate, progression free and overall survival in BRAFV600 mutated metastatic melanoma patients, thus representing the novel standard of care. Dermatological \"off target\" effects of these so-called 'targeted therapies' have to be considered, however, and among them the most intriguing are cutaneous adverse reactions. Skin toxicity is of relevance for at least three reasons: (1) it worsens the patient's quality of life and may be difficult to manage, (2) its heterogeneous clinical presentation differs from the clinico-pathological pictures observed in patients who do not receive BRAF inhibitors, and; (3) onset of skin cancer represents a model of carcinogenesis which may help to better understand the potential visceral tumorigenesis induced by BRAF inhibitors. This manuscript summarizes and critically reviews the state of the art of skin toxicity associated with BRAF inhibitors. Special attention will be paid to clinical presentation and histopathological findings, as well as related challenges for clinicians, pathologists, and basic scientists. ",

We also compared them with a group of 22 spitzoid neoplasms, which were confirmed to be negative for fusions in ALK, NTRK1, BRAF, and RET. Features with the highest discriminatory value included diameter of the lesion, dermal architecture, and certain cytomorphologic features. Specifically, cases with a large diameter (≥9 mm) and wedge-shaped, plexiform dermal architecture of nests of large, spindle-shaped cells were most likely to have an ALK fusion. NTRK1-fused cases were most likely of the fusions to have Kamino bodies and were typically arranged in smaller nests with smaller predominantly spindle-shaped cells, occasionally forming rosettes. BRAF fusion cases were the only fusion subtype to have a predominance of epithelioid cells, were less organized in nests, and commonly had a sheet-like growth pattern or dysplastic Spitz architecture. BRAF fusion cases were most likely to have high-grade nuclear atypia, to be diagnosed as spitzoid melanoma, to have a positive result by melanoma fluorescence in situ hybridization assay, and to develop copy number gains in the kinase domain of the fusion protein.

While RAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib (PLX4032) have proven effective in BRAF mutant melanoma, they are surprisingly ineffective in BRAF mutant CRCs, and the reason for this disparity remains unclear. Compared to BRAF mutant melanoma cells, BRAF mutant CRC cells were less sensitive to vemurafenib, and P-ERK suppression was not sustained in response to treatment. Although transient inhibition of phospho-ERK by vemurafenib was observed in CRC, rapid ERK re-activation occurred through EGFR-mediated activation of RAS and CRAF. BRAF mutant CRCs expressed higher levels of phospho-EGFR than BRAF mutant melanomas, suggesting that CRCs are specifically poised for EGFR-mediated resistance. Combined RAF and EGFR inhibition blocked reactivation of MAPK signaling in BRAF mutant CRC cells and markedly improved efficacy in vitro and in vivo. These findings support evaluation of combined RAF and EGFR inhibition in BRAF mutant CRC patients.;BRAF valine 600 (V600) mutations occur in 10% to 15% of colorectal cancers, yet these tumors show a surprisingly low clinical response rate (~5%) to selective RAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib, which have produced dramatic response rates (60%–80%) in melanomas harboring the identical BRAF V600 mutation.

Familial UM (FUM), defined as two or more family members diagnosed with UM, is rare and estimated at less than 1% of all UM. Currently, BAP1 is the only gene known to contribute significant risk for UM. In this study we aimed to estimate the frequency of BAP1 mutation in FUM and to characterize the family and personal histories of other cancers in these families. We identified 32 families with FUM, including seven families previously reported by our group. BAP1 mutation testing was carried out by direct sequencing of the coding exons and the adjacent untranslated regions of the gene. Germline deletion and duplication analysis of BAP1 was assessed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Germline BAP1 mutations were found in 6/32 (19%) families. No deletions or duplications were identified in any of the 24 samples tested by MLPA. Combined with published studies, the frequency of BAP1 mutations was 14/64 (22%) in FUM. FUM families without BAP1 mutations have distinct family histories with high rates of prostate cancer in first- and second-degree relatives. It is likely that additional genes conferring risk for FUM exist. It is important to understand key shared features of FUM to focus future research on identifying these additional tumor predisposition syndromes. Though BAP1 should be tested first in these families, FUM families without BAP1 mutation should be explored for additional predisposition genes. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

To better understand the mechanisms of resistance, we used chronic selection to establish BRAF(V600E) melanoma clones with acquired resistance to vemurafenib. These clones retained the V600E mutation and no second-site mutations were identified in the BRAF coding sequence. Further characterization showed that vemurafenib was not able to inhibit extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation, suggesting pathway reactivation. Importantly, resistance also correlated with increased levels of RAS-GTP, and sequencing of RAS genes revealed a rare activating mutation in KRAS, resulting in a K117N change in the KRAS protein. Elevated levels of CRAF and phosphorylated AKT were also observed. In addition, combination treatment with vemurafenib and either a MAP/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor or an AKT inhibitor synergistically inhibited proliferation of resistant cells. These findings suggest that resistance to BRAF(V600E) inhibition could occur through several mechanisms, including elevated RAS-GTP levels and increased levels of AKT phosphorylation. Together, our data implicate reactivation of the RAS/RAF pathway by upstream signaling activation as a key mechanism of acquired resistance to vemurafenib, in support of clinical studies in which combination therapy with other targeted agents are being strategized to combat resistance.",

Specifically, we show that BRAFV600E inhibitor resistant cells upregulate pro-survival mediators such as Wnt, and additionally increase receptor tyrosine kinase activity, including EGFR and Axl, promoting resistance to BRAFV600E inhibition. Our results suggest strategies to circumvent acquired resistance to BRAFV600E inhibitor therapy, and thereby improve outcomes for patients with BRAFV600E gliomas.",

Although evidences exist regarding its impact on tumorigenesis, the role of genetic alterations and the expressions of locus-related genes are still controversial. Our study aimed to define the 7q31 copy number alterations in primary melanomas, primary-metastatic tumor pairs and cell lines. Data were correlated with clinical-pathological parameters. Genetic data show that 7q31 copy number distribution was heterogeneous in both primary and metastatic tumors. Extra copies were highly accompanied by chromosome 7 polisomy, and significantly increased in primary lesions with poor prognosis. Additionally, we determined the mRNA and protein levels of the locus-related CAV1 and TES genes. TES mRNA level was associated with metastatic location. CAV1 mRNA and protein levels were significantly higher in thicker tumors, however, lack of protein was also observed in a subpopulation of thin lesions. Expressions of CAV1 and TES were not associated with 7q31 alterations. In conclusion, 7q31 amplification can predict unfavorable outcome. Alterations of TES mRNA level may predict the location of metastasis. CAV1 possibly affect the cancer cell invasion.",

Because patients assigned to dabrafenib monotherapy were allowed to switch to combination therapy upon disease progression, we attempted to adjust for confounding effects on OS. Randomization-based adjustment methods, Rank Preserving Structural Failure Time Models and the Iterative Parameter Estimation algorithm, were used. Two analyses, 'treatment group' (assumes that treatment effect continues beyond treatment discontinuation) and 'on treatment' (assumes that the treatment effect disappears upon treatment discontinuation), were used to test assumptions on the durability of the treatment effect. A total of 45/54 (83%) patients assigned to dabrafenib monotherapy switched to the trametinib/dabrafenib combination. Adjusted OS HRs ranged from 0.47 to 0.50, depending on the analysis, compared with the unadjusted OS HR of 0.73. CIs continued to cross 1.00; thus, adjusted estimates did not provide statistically significant evidence of a treatment benefit on survival. Reduction of HRs after adjusting for the effect of treatment switching suggests that the intention-to-treat analysis underestimates the effect of dabrafenib plus trametinib on OS, although several factors, such as small trial size and methodological assumptions, affect the certainty of the conclusions.

Two HLA class I+ melanoma cell lines, one (TOM) A2+ and the other (CLB-M) A2-, obtained from living patients were transduced with the IL-2 gene. The patients' peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were incubated with irradiated IL-2 gene-transduced autologous tumor cells for up to four weeks. After seven days, PBL from both patients showed non-specific cytotoxic activity against the K562 cell line. When the co-culture incubation time was prolonged to 28 days, PBL from patient TOM (A2+) developed a lytic activity directed specifically against the autologous tumor cells. In contrast, after 28 days of incubation, PBL from CLB-M (A2-) displayed only non-specific cytotoxic activity. Inhibition experiments demonstrated that the specific lytic function observed with TOM cells transduced with the IL-2 gene could be reversed following incubation with monoclonal antibodies directed against HLA class I and CD8. The evidence that K562 cells were incapable of blocking the PBL killing capacity in a cold-target inhibition assay further confirmed that engineered TOM cells induced the generation of specific CTL. This study indicates that retroviral vector mediated transfer of the IL-2 gene into human melanoma cell lines can lead to the amplification of the autologous cytotoxic compartment and to the generation of specific antitumor CTL, and that the A2 allele may play an important role in the process of tumor recognition.",

To our knowledge this represents the first detailed histological analysis of the squamoproliferative lesions which arise in the context of treatment with BRAF inhibitors, and highlights the morphological diversity of these lesions.

However, some cancer cell types, including malignant melanoma cells, are resistant             to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Therefore, drugs that can amplify TRAIL cytotoxicity             are urgently required. Depolarization of the plasma membrane potential is associated             with apoptosis induced by a variety of death-inducing agents but its role in apoptosis             remains a matter of debate. We found that TRAIL treatment resulted in robust depolarization             in human melanoma cells with a considerable lag (2-4 h). Moreover, membrane-depolarizing             agents, including K+ and ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel inhibitors glibenclamide             and U37883A enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis. On the contrary, inhibitors of calcium-             and voltage-dependent K+ channels and mitochondrial KATP channels had no such             effects. Melanocytes were insensitive to TRAIL-induced depolarization and apoptosis             as well as to the sensitization by membrane-depolarizing agents despite their             substantial surface expression of death receptors. TRAIL induced robust activation             of X-box-binding protein-1 and caspase-12, both of which were enhanced by the             K+ and KATP channel inhibitors, but not by other K+ channel inhibitors. Finally,             caspase-12-selective inhibitor completely abolished the amplification of apoptosis.             These findings suggest that depolarization promotes endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated             death pathway, thereby amplifying TRAIL cytotoxicity. Thus, membrane-depolarizing             agents such as KATP channel inhibitors may have therapeutic potential in the treatment             of TRAIL-resistant cancer cells without impairing tumor-selectivity.",

We studied 31 cases of ASTs with heterozygous 9p21 loss and hypothesize that heterozygous 9p21 loss in ASTs does not confer an increased risk for aggressive behavior. We compared clinical, histopathologic, and immunohistochemical features of 31 ASTs with heterozygous 9p21 deletions with 30 ASTs with homozygous 9p21 deletions. No ASTs with heterozygous 9p21 deletions resulted in distant metastasis. Severe cytologic atypia, a predominance of epithelioid cytomorphology and increased dermal mitotic activity were more frequent in ASTs with homozygous deletions versus ASTs with heterozygous deletions (P=0.0003, 0.0004, and 0.042, respectively).

BI-847325 potently inhibited growth and survival of melanoma cell lines that were both BRAF inhibitor naïve and resistant in 2D culture, 3D cell culture conditions, and in colony formation assays. Western blot studies showed BI-847325 to reduce expression of phospho-ERK and phospho-histone 3 in multiple models of vemurafenib resistance. Mechanistically, BI-847325 decreased the expression of MEK and Mcl-1 while increasing the expression of the proapoptotic protein BIM. Strong suppression of MEK expression was observed after 48 hours of treatment, with no recovery following >72 hours of washout. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Mcl-1 enhanced the effects of BI-847325, whereas Mcl-1 overexpression reversed this in both 2D cell culture and 3D spheroid melanoma models. In vivo, once weekly BI-847325 (70 mg/kg) led to durable regression of BRAF-inhibitor naïve xenografts with no regrowth seen (>65 days of treatment). In contrast, treatment with the vemurafenib analog PLX4720 was associated with tumor relapse at >30 days. BI-847325 also suppressed the long-term growth of xenografts with acquired PLX4720 resistance. Analysis of tumor samples revealed BI-847325 to induce apoptosis associated with suppression of phospho-ERK, total MEK, phospho-Histone3, and Mcl-1 expression. Our studies indicate that BI-847325 is effective in overcoming BRAF inhibitor resistance and has long-term inhibitory effects upon BRAF-mutant melanoma in vivo, through a mechanism associated with the decreased expression of both MEK and Mcl-1.",

The V600E mutation is found in the vast majority of cases and is an activating mutation, conferring transforming and immortalization potential to cells. CEP-32496 is a potent BRAF inhibitor in an in vitro binding assay for mutated BRAF(V600E) (K(d) BRAF(V600E) = 14 nmol/L) and in a mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated (ER) kinase (MEK) phosphorylation (pMEK) inhibition assay in human melanoma (A375) and colorectal cancer (Colo-205) cell lines (IC(50) = 78 and 60 nmol/L). In vitro, CEP-32496 has multikinase binding activity at other cancer targets of interest; however, it exhibits selective cellular cytotoxicity for BRAF(V600E) versus wild-type cells. CEP-32496 is orally bioavailable in multiple preclinical species (>95% in rats, dogs, and monkeys) and has single oral dose pharmacodynamic inhibition (10-55 mg/kg) of both pMEK and pERK in BRAF(V600E) colon carcinoma xenografts in nude mice. Sustained tumor stasis and regressions are observed with oral administration (30-100 mg/kg twice daily) against BRAF(V600E) melanoma and colon carcinoma xenografts, with no adverse effects. Little or no epithelial hyperplasia was observed in rodents and primates with prolonged oral administration and sustained exposure. CEP-32496 benchmarks favorably with respect to other kinase inhibitors, including RAF-265 (phase I), sorafenib, (approved), and vemurafenib (PLX4032/RG7204, approved). CEP-32496 represents a novel and pharmacologically active BRAF inhibitor with a favorable side effect profile currently in clinical development.",

In this study, we profiled immunologic changes in the tumor microenvironment and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in a B-RafV600E/Pten-driven murine model of melanoma after administration of the B-Raf(V600E) small molecule inhibitor PLX4720. In this model, we found that as tumors developed, they gradually acquired immunosuppressive features, including accumulation of regulatory T cells (Treg) and CD11b(+)/Gr-1(+) myeloid cells and loss of Th1 effector functions on CD4(+) TILs, such as CD40L and IFNγ expression. PLX4720 administration promoted development of a more immune stimulatory microenvironment associated with a relative increase in CD40L and IFNγ expression on intratumoral CD4(+) TILs and a reduced accumulation of Tregs and CD11b(+)/Gr-1(+) myeloid cells. Strikingly, CD40L or IFNγ blockade compromised the ability of PLX4720 to inhibit melanoma growth. Supporting this result, agonistic CD40 antibody was sufficient to evoke antitumor immunity and suppress tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice. Taken together, our results establish the critical role of immune-related changes, with key contributions for CD40L and IFNγ signaling in the antitumor responses triggered in vivo by B-Raf(V600E) inhibitors.",

The cells have been shown to express the C3b-cleaving membrane protease p65. To delineate the molecular consequences of the C3b-cleaving activity for the complement cytotoxicity, the molecular events during the initiation (R24 monoclonal antibody, C1), amplification (C4, C3), and membrane attack (C5, C9) phases of complement were studied in comparison to a complement-susceptible human melanoma line (SK-MEL-93-2). No cleavage of C4b and C5b, 2 molecules structurally similar to C3b, was observed on the cells during classical pathway activation indicating the specificity of the p65 protease for the C3b molecule. The rapid degradation of C3b by p65 on the surface of complement-resistant SK-MEL-170 cells generates a M(r) 30,000 C3 alpha'-chain-fragment detectable as early as 1 min after complement activation, whereas no such fragment was present in detectable amounts on complement-susceptible cells. As a result of the rapid C3b proteolysis by p65 on resistant SK-MEL-170 cells, less C5 convertases are formed, which in turn results in the formation of a lower number of terminal complement components and membrane attack complexes. R24 antibody and C1q binding to the resistant cells was slightly lower as to susceptible cells. C4 binding studies, however, revealed that the observed difference in antibody and C1q binding has no influence on the complement resistance of SK-MEL-170 cells: significantly more C4b was bound to complement-resistant (1565 +/- 92 fg/cell) as compared to susceptible cells (715 +/- 31 fg/cell). On extraction of the molecular forms of C4 bound to the cell membranes, an additional high molecular weight C4 species--apparently a C4b-C4b homodimer--appeared only on the resistant SK-MEL-170 cells that may function as a residual back-up C5 convertase. Collectively, these results show that SK-MEL-170 human melanoma cells evade complement-mediated cytolysis despite sufficient activation of early components of the classical complement pathway by p65-mediated rapid degradation of surface-bound C3b, leading to a significant reduction in membrane attack complex formation. Thus, rapid cleavage of surface deposited C3b was established as a powerful mechanism of complement resistance.",

Over 40 different missense BRAF mutations have been found, but the vast majority (>90%) represent a single nucleotide change resulting in a valine-->glutamate mutation at residue 600 ((V600E)BRAF). In cells cultured in vitro, (V600E)BRAF is able to stimulate endogenous MEK [MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)/ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) kinase] and ERK phosphorylation leading to an increase in cell proliferation, cell survival, transformation, tumorigenicity, invasion and vascular development. Many of these hallmarks of cancer can be reversed by treatment of cells with siRNA (small interfering RNA) to BRAF or by inhibiting MEK, indicating that BRAF and MEK are attractive therapeutic targets in cancer samples with BRAF mutations. In order to fully understand the role of oncogenic BRAF in cancer development in vivo as well as to test the in vivo efficacy of anti-BRAF or anti-MEK therapies, GEMMs (genetically engineered mouse models) have been generated in which expression of oncogenic BRaf is conditionally dependent on the Cre recombinase. The delivery/activation of the Cre recombinase can be regulated in both a temporal and spatial manner and therefore these mouse models can be used to recapitulate the somatic mutation of BRAF that occurs in different tissues in the development of human cancer. The data so far obtained following Cre-mediated activation in haemopoietic tissue and the lung indicate that (V600E)BRAF mutation can drive tumour initiation and that its primary effect is to induce high levels of cyclin D1-mediated cell proliferation. However, hallmarks of OIS (oncogene-induced senescence) are evident that restrain further development of the tumour.",

In this study, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification was established to detect melanoma, colorectal and prostate cancer cells. Nucleic acid sequence-based amplification and RT-PCR both successfully amplified target RNA in peripheral blood samples from patients with melanoma and colorectal cancer, but only RT-PCR detected PSA in blood samples from patients with prostate cancer. There was relatively good agreement between sample replicates analyzed by RT-PCR (Kappa values of one for tyrosinase, 0.67 for CK-20 and one for PSA), but less agreement when analyzed by nucleic acid sequence-based amplification. This may limit the routine use of NASBA for the detection of clinically significant disease.

We validated mechanisms of resistance in a cell line derived from the patient's tumour.;We observed that the majority of the single-nucleotide variants identified were shared across all tumour sites, but also saw site-specific copy-number alterations in discrete cell populations at different sites. We found that two ubiquitous mutations mediated resistance to BRAF inhibition in these tumours. A mutation in GNAQ sustained mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling, whereas a mutation in PTEN activated the PI3 K/AKT pathway.

Correlation of VE1 immunohistochemistry and BRAF sequencing revealed a perfect match for both papillary thyroid carcinomas and melanoma metastases. The staining intensity in BRAF V600E mutated tumor samples ranged from weak to strong. The generally homogenous VE1 staining patterns argue against a clonal heterogeneity of the tumors investigated.

A novel allele-specific qPCR method, in combination with direct DNA sequencing, was performed in order to inspect the frequency of the V600E mutation in exon 15, as well as to examine the mutation status of the gene within exon 11.;Both BRAF and RKIP expression levels exhibit a decrease from normal skin tissue and AK, going to SCC. The decrease of RKIP mRNA levels in SCC, suggests one novel mechanism in the deregulation of the BRAF signaling pathway. Our results further indicate that BRAF does not appear to be frequently mutated either in pre-cancerous skin lesions (AK) or in non-melanoma skin tumors (SCC).",

However, these agents are associated with the development of other nonmelanoma skin lesions, in particular squamoproliferative lesions such as keratoacanthomas (KAs), squamous cell carcinomas, and BRAF inhibitor-associated verrucous keratoses. The molecular pathogenesis of these lesions is of interest, not only for therapeutic reasons, but also for the insight it might provide into the development of similar lesions in a sporadic setting. We used next-generation sequencing to compare the mutational profiles of lesions after treatment with a BRAF inhibitor, with similar lesions arising sporadically. HRAS mutations were common among the BRAF inhibitor-induced lesions, being identified in 56%, compared with 14% of lesions in the sporadic group (P = 0.002). Thus, despite similar histomorphological appearances, the underlying molecular mechanisms may be different. In addition, within the BRAF inhibitor-associated group, the lesions designated as KAs and BRAF inhibitor-associated verrucous keratoses had a similar mutational profile (mutations in PIK3CA, APC, and HRAS), which was distinct to that seen in squamous cell carcinomas (FGFR3, CDKN2A, and STK11). We have previously noted histological overlap between KAs and BRAF inhibitor-associated verrucous keratoses, and this finding supports the notion that they may represent morphological or temporal variants of a single lesion type.

Under normal physiologic conditions, the RAS-RAF-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)-mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK) signalling cascade interaction is initiated by ligation of a receptor-linked tyrosine kinase by its cognate growth factor. It has been demonstrated in many systems that aberrant autocrine or paracrine stimulation of growth factor receptors is pathogenic in large part because of MAPK activation. As one of the key downstream effector pathways of mutated RAS (KRAS, NRAS and HRAS), pharmacologic inhibition of components of the MAPK pathway has been pursued as a means to indirectly inhibit RAS, which remains a technical challenge for direct pharmacologic inhibition. RAF and MEK are the two non-membrane-bound, serine-threonine and tyrosine-threonine kinases, within the pathway that have been most extensively explored as drug targets. The discovery of activating BRAF mutations in cancer clarified which cancer types and subsets of certain cancers are most dependent on activation of the MAPK pathway for growth and survival. Now, with the successful translation of selective BRAF and MEK inhibitors into validated therapies for BRAF mutant melanoma, the field seeks to resolve the role for these agents in cancers harbouring RAS mutations or those driven by aberrant growth factor receptor activation.",

Unlike its high treatment response to selective BRAF inhibitor (PLX4032) in metastatic melanoma, the treatment response in thyroid cancer is reported to be low. The purpose of this study is to investigate the resistance mechanism responsible for this low treatment response to BRAF inhibitor in order to maximize the effect of targeted therapy. We examined the expression of feedback regulation mechanisms and alterations in the upper signal transduction pathway in thyroid cancer cell lines harboring BRAF mutation. Also, we investigated the effect of dual inhibition from combinatorial therapy. Two thyroid cancer cell lines, 8505C (anaplastic thyroid cancer) and BCPAP (papillary thyroid cancer) were selected and treated with PLX4032 and its drug sensitivity were examined and compared. Further investigation on the changes in signals responsible for the different treatment response to PLX4032 was carried out and the same experiment was performed on orthotopic xenograft mouse models. Unlike BCPAP cells, 8505C cells presented drug resistance to PLX4032 treatment and this was mainly due to increased expression of c-Met. Effective inhibitions of c-Met, p-AKT, and p-ERK were achieved after dual treatment with BRAF inhibitor (PLX4032) and c-Met inhibitor (PHA665752). Similar results were confirmed by in vivo study with orthotopic xenograft mouse model. c-Met-mediated reactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and MAPK pathway contributes to the relative insensitivity of BRAF (V600E) mutant anaplastic thyroid cancer cells to PLX4032. Dual inhibition of BRAF and c-Met leads to sustained treatment response. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The biochemistry of the ERK pathway is well characterized; however, how the pathway achieves different outcomes in the face of genetic aberrations of cancer and subsequent treatment with chemical inhibitors is not clear. To investigate this, we used mass spectrometry to complete a global phosphoproteomic analysis of a BRAFV600E thyroid cancer cell line (SW1736) after treatment with the mutation-selective inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032) and MEK1/2 inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244). We identified thousands of phosphorylation events orchestrated in BRAFV600E cells and performed kinase landscape analysis to identify putative kinases regulated in response to MAPK blockade. The abundance of phosphopeptides containing consensus motifs for acidophilic kinases increased after short-term inhibition with these compounds. We showed that coinhibition of the pleiotropic acidophilic protein kinase CK2 (CK2) and BRAFV600E synergistically reduced proliferation in patient-derived melanomas and thyroid cancer cells harboring the BRAF lesion. We investigated this mechanism and show a role for CK2 in controlling AKT activation that was not reliant on changes to PTEN or PDK1 phosphorylation.

The implication of hormonal interplay is strong since metastatic MM to the breast is seen nearly always in women. However, the role of hormonal status as a predisposing factor in the development of this entity is largely unresolved. A number of chromosomal loci, including 1p36 and 9p21-22, appear to harbor critical genes important to melanoma tumorigenesis, and additionally chromosome 9q22.3-31. We wanted to know if metastatic MM in breast showed chromosome 1p and 9p genetic alterations (loss of heterozygosity) similar to those that occur in primary cutaneous MM, and whether additional 9q LOH changes are present. Hormonal receptor status of the metastatic MM was also determined. We identified 20 patients with known MM metastatic to the breast, which we analyzed with the following genetic markers: D9S12 (9q22.3), D9S171 (9p21), IFNA (9p22), and D1S450 (1p). Visually directed microdissection was performed on archival histologic slides containing both tumor and adjacent normal breast epithelium, followed by single-step DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification for evaluation of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for the above-listed markers. Immunohistochemical (IHC) stains for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) was performed on 10 of the cases. Twelve of the 20 cases contained DNA suitable for PCR amplification following direct visualization microdissection. Four of 8 (50%) informative cases showed LOH at 9p21 with D9S171. Ten cases were heterozygous for IFNA, with 2 cases (20%) showing LOH at this locus. These particular cases also showed LOH at 9p21. One of 9 (11%) informative cases showed LOH for D1S450 (1p36). Five cases were heterozygous for D9S12, and 2 (40%) showed LOH in the tumor at 9q22.3. IHC stains for ER and PR were negative in the 10 tumors studied. Metastatic MM presenting as a breast mass is an interesting entity often requiring IHC studies for diagnosis, particularly when the histologic features simulate breast carcinoma or when no primary tumor is known. These tumors are ER and PR negative. Metastatic MM involving the breast shows similar genetic allelic losses on chromosome 9p21-22 (50%) and 1p36 (11%), as previously described in primary cutaneous MM. Additional LOH was observed at the 9q22.3-31 locus (40%). We suggest this locus to be investigated for harboring potential genes important in the tumorigenesis of cutaneous MM.",

Here, we report that BRAF is phosphorylated at Ser729 by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a critical energy sensor. This phosphorylation promotes the association of BRAF with 14-3-3 proteins and disrupts its interaction with the KSR1 scaffolding protein, leading to attenuation of the MEK-ERK signaling. We also show that phosphorylation of BRAF by AMPK impairs keratinocyte cell proliferation and cell-cycle progression. Furthermore, AMPK activation attenuates BRAF inhibitor-induced ERK hyperactivation in keratinocytes and epidermal hyperplasia in mouse skin. Our findings reveal a mechanism for regulating BRAF signaling in response to energy stress and suggest a strategy for preventing the development of cSCCs associated with BRAF-targeted therapy. ",

Of the 21 patients treated, one patient had a confirmed partial response (5%; 95% CI, 1% to 24%) and seven other patients had stable disease by RECIST criteria. Median progression-free survival was 2.1 months. Patterns of concurrent mutations, microsatellite instability status, CpG island methylation status, PTEN loss, EGFR expression, and copy number alterations were not associated with clinical benefit. In contrast to prior expectations, concurrent KRAS and NRAS mutations were detected at low allele frequency in a subset of the patients' tumors (median, 0.21% allele frequency) and were apparent mechanisms of acquired resistance in vemurafenib-sensitive patient-derived xenograft models.;In marked contrast to the results seen in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant melanoma, single-agent vemurafenib did not show meaningful clinical activity in patients with BRAF V600E mutant CRC. Combination strategies are now under development and may be informed by the presence of intratumor heterogeneity of KRAS and NRAS mutations.",

Plk1 is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers and is essential to sustained oncogenic proliferation, thus making Plk1 an attractive therapeutic target. However, the clinical efficacy of Plk1 inhibition has not emulated the preclinical success, stressing an urgent need for a better understanding of Plk1 signaling. This study addresses that need by utilizing a quantitative proteomics strategy to compare the proteome of BRAF(V600E) mutant melanoma cells following treatment with the Plk1-specific inhibitor BI 6727. Employing label-free nano-LC-MS/MS technology on a Q-exactive followed by SIEVE processing, we identified more than 20 proteins of interest, many of which have not been previously associated with Plk1 signaling. Here we report the down-regulation of multiple metabolic proteins with an associated decrease in cellular metabolism, as assessed by lactate and NAD levels. Furthermore, we have also identified the down-regulation of multiple proteasomal subunits, resulting in a significant decrease in 20S proteasome activity. Additionally, we have identified a novel association between Plk1 and p53 through heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein C1/C2 (hnRNPC), thus providing valuable insight into Plk1's role in cancer cell survival.

These samples were subjected to whole-exome sequencing and/or polymerase chain reaction-based genetic testing.;Among 132 samples, putative resistance mechanisms were identified in 58%, including NRAS or KRAS mutations (20%), BRAF splice variants (16%), BRAF(V600E/K) amplifications (13%), MEK1/2 mutations (7%), and non-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway alterations (11%). Marked heterogeneity was observed within tumors and patients; 18 of 19 patients (95%) with more than one progression biopsy had distinct/unknown drivers of resistance between samples. NRAS mutations were associated with vemurafenib use (p = 0.045) and intracranial metastases (p = 0.036), and MEK1/2 mutations correlated with hepatic progression (p = 0.011). Progression-free survival and overall survival were similar across resistance mechanisms. The median survival after disease progression was 6.9 months, and responses to subsequent BRAF and MEK inhibition were uncommon (2 of 15; 13%).

In all, 62 archival biliary tract cancers, including 15 gallbladder cancers, 15 extrahepatic, and 10 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas from the United States, and 22 gallbladder carcinomas from Chile were analyzed for the V599E mutation of the BRAF gene using three distinct methods: direct sequencing, a primer extension method (Mutector assay), and the highly sensitive quantitative Gap Ligase Chain Reaction. The common V599E mutation was not identified in any of the 62 biliary cancer samples using these three methods of detection. The V599E somatic mutation of the BRAF gene is absent in biliary tract cancers, at least in the two geographic populations (United States and Chile) examined.

Such mutations occur in approximately 70% of human malignant melanomas, and a single hyperactivating V600E mutation is found in the activation segment of the kinase domain and accounts for more than 90% of these mutations. Given this correlation, the molecular mechanism for BRAF regulation as well as oncogenic activation has attracted considerable interest, and activated forms of BRAF, such as BRAF(V600E), have become attractive targets for small molecule inhibition. Here we report on the identification and subsequent optimization of a potent BRAF inhibitor, CS292, based on an organometallic kinase inhibitor scaffold. A cocrystal structure of CS292 in complex with the BRAF kinase domain reveals that CS292 binds to the ATP binding pocket of the kinase and is an ATP competitive inhibitor. The structure of the kinase-inhibitor complex also demonstrates that CS292 binds to BRAF in an active conformation and suggests a mechanism for regulation of BRAF by phosphorylation and BRAF(V600E) oncogene-induced activation.

To date, role of autophagy during BRAF inhibition in thyroid cancer remains unknown.;In this study, we investigate if autophagy is activated in vemurafenib treated BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer cells, and whether autophagy inhibition improves or impairs the treatment efficacy of vemurafenib.;Autophagy level was determined by western blot assay and transmission electron microscopy. The combined effects of autophagy inhibitor and vemurafenib were assessed in terms of cell viability in vitro and tumor growth rate in vivo. Whether the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was in response to vemurafenib-induced autophagy was also analyzed.;Vemurafenib induced a high level of autophagy in BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer cells. Inhibition of autophagy by either a pharmacological inhibitor or interfering RNA knockdown of essential autophagy genes augmented vemurafenib-induced cell death. Vemurafenib-induced autophagy was independent of MAPK signaling pathway and was mediated through the ER stress response. Finally, administration of vemurafenib with the autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine promoted more pronounced tumor suppression in vivo.;Our data demonstrate that vemurafenib induces ER stress response-mediated autophagy in thyroid cancer and autophagy inhibition may be a beneficial strategy to sensitize BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer to vemurafenib.",

Although MTS1 may thus be the candidate melanoma suppressor gene that maps to chromosome 9p21, it is not clear how dysfunction at that locus temporally relates to melanoma progression. To further test its role in sporadic melanoma, the expression of p16INK4-protein and -mRNA was characterized in melanomas and melanocytic nevi by immunocytochemistry and in situ reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Histologic tissue sections were immunolabeled with anti-p16INK4 antibody for 108 melanocytic lesions, including common and atypical nevi, in situ melanomas, primary invasive melanomas, and metastatic tumors. A subset of the lesions was analyzed for expression of p16INK4-mRNA, employing forward and reverse intron-bridging primers for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification of the transcript corresponding to exons 1 and 2 of MTS1. Strong immunolabeling was detected in the melanocytes of common nevi and of nevi with architectural disorder and cytologic atypia. By digital image analysis, in contrast, labeling intensity decreased significantly and progressively in the melanocytes of in situ, invasive, and metastatic melanomas. Results from the in situ reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis were confirmatory, showing a strong signal in the melanocytic nevi but progressive signal attenuation with increasing stage of melanoma. These data indicate correlation between gradual loss of expression of the MTS1 locus and progression of melanoma, further supporting an emerging role for the gene in the malignant transformation of melanocytes. The failure to demonstrate reduced expression in nevi suggests either that these lesions are not an early stage in melanoma development, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, or that loss of p16INK4 function is not an initiating event in melanocyte transformation.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The presentations of primary and metastatic cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) are very diverse. Evidence increasingly indicates that single CMM cells spread to distant sites quite early during cancer progression and are soon eliminated before they become clinically detectable. However bulky metastases which appear at a later stage might derive from some of these early neoplastic cells. It seems that local CMM single cell micro-metastases commonly predict sentinel lymph node involvement without overtly reflecting CMM progression to bulky visceral metastases. This study is intended to review the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying two CMM presentations. The first is the long interval, apparently disease-free, with persistent CMM dormancy, which may precede overt metastatic growth. Immunosurveillance may induce dormancy in single CMM cells disseminated in the body by blocking their proliferation cycle. The second is the so-called CMM smoldering phenomenon, which is marked by an alternate progression and regression of CMM locally with metastases that wax and wane for long periods of time over restricted skin areas. These very diverse patterns of CMM progression are likely to be ascribable to a number of biological factors, including the activation of CMM stem cells, and the combined phenotypic heterogeneity and variability in proliferative amplification in CMM cell clusters. Furthermore an adequate stimulation of CMM immune-surveillance and the induction of a specific stromal structure and vascular response are required. In this context, most early CMM tumors are in part controlled by lymphocyte-mediated responses before they become clinically detectable. However both the role of immune-surveillance and the mechanisms underlying both persistent and smoldering CMM dormancy remain unclear. ",

A small subset of nevi is present at birth, and therefore must develop independently of UV light.

We found no BRAF mutations, but 81% (26/32) harbored mutations in NRAS. Consistently, seven of 10 (70%) proliferating nodules that developed early in life in congenital nevi showed mutations in NRAS. A separate set of nevi that displayed histological features frequently found in nevi present at birth (\"congenital pattern nevi\") but lacked a definitive history of presence at birth showed an inverse mutation pattern with common BRAF mutations (20/28 or 71%) and less frequent NRAS mutations (7/28 or 25%). Thus, nevi that develop in utero are genetically distinct from those that develop later, and histopathologic criteria alone are unable to reliably distinguish the two groups.

Recent work suggests that BRAF(V600E) inhibition by vemurafenib results in decreased negative feedback to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway and that the different clinical responses are due to differences in the amount of EGFR present in these two cancers. The experimental work that identified the feedback signaling was an elegant mix of functional genomic approaches and focused, hypothesis-driven cellular and molecular biology.

Subsequent in vitro dissolution studies were conducted in fasted-state simulated gastric fluid over a 24-h period and showed that HPMC capsules reached a higher percentage of dabrafenib dissolved than gelatin capsules.

Among the top 147 most-expressed tags in glioblastoma, we found a tag, TTTTGGGTAT, that originated from an unidentified gene and which was not detected in human astrocyte cultures. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR showed that MAGE-E1 expression was 2.6-15-fold enriched in glioblastoma relative to human astrocytes. Expressed sequence tags containing this tag were homologous to the melanoma-associated antigen gene (MAGE) family, and this new cDNA, named MAGE-E1, was cloned by the 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends technique. Three alternatively spliced variants (MAGE-E1a-c) were found, and deduced amino acid sequence showed that MAGE-E1a and -E1b shared the MAGE-conserved region, whereas -E1c did not. This suggests that although MAGE-E1c is expressed from one of the MAGE family, it has distinct functions from other members. Tissue distribution analysis showed that MAGE-E1 was distinct from other MAGEs. MAGE-E1 expression was detected only in brain and ovary among normal tissues.

        "Doc_abstract":"Due to a variety of known and unknown control mechanisms, the human genome is remarkably stable when compared to most other species. The long latency periods of most solid tumors, during which the cell undergoes malignant transformation, are presumably due to this stability. The molecular basis responsible for the induction of genetic instability and the resultant biological characteristics manifest in tumor populations is not well understood. The discovery of both oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, however, has placed the phenomenon of human genome stability on a more solid conceptual footing. These types of genes clearly place multiple barriers to oncogenic transformation, and traversing these barriers apparently requires both time and the accumulation of genetic defects that cannot be corrected. The evolution of neoplasias can, therefore, be predicted to be due to: (1) consistent and progressive loss of tumor suppressor genes; (2) gene amplification, resulting in the over-expression of proteins that aid in tumor progression; (3) gene mutation, which alters the orderly biochemistry of the normal cell; (4) genes that allow a cell like the melanocyte to escape the confining nature of the epidermis and to invade through the dermis into the circulatory and lymphatic systems in order to disseminate itself to other organs (e.g., proteolytic enzymes, enzyme inhibitors, integrins, metastases genes, chemotactic factors etc.); (5) factors, perhaps such as TGF beta 2, that may impact negatively on MHC antigens and confuse host defense mechanisms; and (6) S.O.S.-type genes, which may be expressed as a direct response to the accumulating damage in an attempt to correct the damage, but that may then become part of the problem instead of the solution. The extraordinary plasticity and instability of the genome of a melanoma cell suggests an inordinate amount of genetic flux. In addition to activating and inactivating various genes, this constant shuffling and rearranging of the genome in neoplasms such as MM may be constantly altering gene dose. Cytogenetic and molecular biological studies have been the Rosetta stone for understanding the etiological relevant genetic events in human cancers. Genetic alterations fundamental to the pathology of MM have begun to be defined. Studies designed to understand these perturbations at the biochemical and organismic level are underway.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "Doc_abstract":"The theory of immunosurveillance against cancer has been an extensively debated question over the last decades. Multiple indirect arguments have supported the view that the immune system may control, at least in certain cases, malignant cell growth while direct demonstration is still lacking in the human. In an attempt to address this issue, we have selected a study model, namely spontaneously regressive melanoma. A primary cutaneous lesion was investigated. T cell repertoire analysis showed the in situ amplification of at least two tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TILs) expressing the V beta 13 and V beta 16 variable TCR gene segments respectively. The two clones were precisely characterized by sequence of the TCR beta chain junctional region. Further functional study demonstrated that both lymphocytes displayed a selective cytotoxic activity against autologous tumor cells. The V beta 16+ cells, predominant in vivo, were shown to be closely opposed to the melanoma cells. Together, these studies demonstrated the existence of a local adaptative immune response associated to tumor regression, thus strongly supporting the validity of the immunosurveillance concept. A gastric metastasis which occurred three years after the primary lesion has been studied here. Overexpression of the V beta 13 and V beta 16 TCR segments was no longer detected by direct PCR analysis in situ. Sequencing transcripts from V beta 13+ and V beta 16+ TILs confirmed that the two CTLs, identified in the primary lesions, were not represented with high frequency. The V beta 13+ cell was however shown to be present while the V beta 16+ CTL was not detected. Yet, characterization of a tumor cell line derived from the gastric site indicated that the peptidic antigen(s) which induced the initially successfully immune response was still expressed. The present data illustrate that it has become possible to perform very precise analysis of local immune responses during cancer development. Such an improvement together with the recently initiated molecular characterization of tumor associated peptidic antigens, should provide the basis for improved strategies of cancer immunotherapy.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Clear cell sarcoma (CCS), also known as malignant melanoma of soft parts, is a rare malignancy constituting approximately 1% of all soft-tissue sarcomas. It occurs predominantly in the lower extremities of young adults, manifesting as a deep, painless, slow-growing mass. CCS is sometimes confused with other types of melanoma because of its melanocytic differentiation. Although BRAF and KIT mutations are well-known melanocytic tumour-promoting mutations frequently found in cutaneous melanoma, they are rare or absent in CCS. We present two cases of CCS with different clinical and genetic features. Both female patients, aged 25 and 20 years, presented with a palpable nodule on a lower extremity. Biopsies of both tumours revealed features diagnostic of CCS. Each tumour cell was positive for S100 protein and HMB-45. However, one patient's tumour was localized to the dermis, with many multinucleated giant cells, whereas the other was located in the deep subcutaneous fat layer near bone. Fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated the presence of a characteristic Ewing sarcoma RNA-binding protein (EWSR)1 gene rearrangement in both cases. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing of the PCR product revealed an EWSR1-activating transcription factor 1 type 1 fusion transcript in both cases. In addition, we detected BRAF mutation in the dermal type and KIT mutation in the subcutaneous type. It is of interest that the BRAF and KIT mutations are known to be very rare in CCS. On the basis of our observations, we suggest that mutation inhibitors may be useful in selected patients with mutated CCS lineages.",

We undertook a histology-independent phase 2 \"basket\" study of vemurafenib in BRAF V600 mutation-positive nonmelanoma cancers.;We enrolled patients in six prespecified cancer cohorts; patients with all other tumor types were enrolled in a seventh cohort. A total of 122 patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive cancer were treated, including 27 patients with colorectal cancer who received vemurafenib and cetuximab. The primary end point was the response rate; secondary end points included progression-free and overall survival.;In the cohort with non-small-cell lung cancer, the response rate was 42% (95% confidence interval [CI], 20 to 67) and median progression-free survival was 7.3 months (95% CI, 3.5 to 10.8). In the cohort with Erdheim-Chester disease or Langerhans'-cell histiocytosis, the response rate was 43% (95% CI, 18 to 71); the median treatment duration was 5.9 months (range, 0.6 to 18.6), and no patients had disease progression during therapy. There were anecdotal responses among patients with pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, anaplastic thyroid cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, salivary-duct cancer, ovarian cancer, and clear-cell sarcoma and among patients with colorectal cancer who received vemurafenib and cetuximab. Safety was similar to that in prior studies of vemurafenib for melanoma.;BRAF V600 appears to be a targetable oncogene in some, but not all, nonmelanoma cancers. Preliminary vemurafenib activity was observed in non-small-cell lung cancer and in Erdheim-Chester disease and Langerhans'-cell histiocytosis.

Immunohistochemical and fluorescence in-situ hybridization analyses were carried out on tissue microarrays constructed from 110 NM samples, 30 compound nevi, and 38 dysplastic nevi. NM samples showed 24% strong cyclin D1 and 37% strong Ki67 protein expression compared with 3 and 0% strong cyclin D1 and Ki67 expression in the control group. Membrane EGFR expression was detected in 50% of NM cases, whereas EGFR gene amplification was detected in only 4% of NM cases. Multiple NM samples presented simultaneous membrane and nuclear EGFR expression. We found a negative correlation between tumor thickness and membrane EGFR expression. It was also observed that membrane EGFR 3+ NM samples presented ulceration significantly more often than membrane EGFR-negative (0) NM samples. In univariate analysis, carried out on 44 patients with follow-up data, both nuclear and membrane EGFR overexpression showed a correlation with a shorter overall survival.

Similarities with uveal melanoma were recently suggested as both entities harbor oncogenic mutations in GNAQ and GNA11. Whether primary LMNs share additional genetic alterations with uveal melanoma including copy number variations is unknown. Twenty primary LMNs ranging from benign and intermediate-grade melanocytomas to melanomas were tested by direct sequencing for hotspot mutations in the genes GNA11, GNAQ, BRAF, NRAS and HRAS. Furthermore, the lesions were tested for copy number variations of chromosomes frequently present in uveal melanoma (1p, 3, 6 and 8q) by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Genome-wide analyses of copy number alterations of two leptomeningeal melanocytic neoplasms were performed using the OncoScan SNP-array. GNAQ(Q209) mutations were present in eleven LMNs, while two of 20 cases carried a GNA11(Q209) mutation. No BRAF, HRAS or NRAS hotspot mutations were detected. Monosomy 3 and gain of 8q were present in one leptomeningeal melanoma, and one intermediate-grade melanocytoma harbored a gain of chromosome 6. With MLPA, the melanocytomas did not show any further gross chromosomal variations. Our data shows that primary LMNs, like uveal melanoma, harbor oncogenic mutations in GNAQ and GNA11 but lack mutations in BRAF, NRAS and HRAS. This finding may help in the differential diagnosis between a primary LMN and a metastasis from a cutaneous melanoma to the central nervous system. Copy number variations in some aggressive LMNs resemble those present in uveal melanoma but their prognostic significance is unclear. ",

All the presented mutations of BRAF are located in exons 11 and 15, and the hotspot mutation at codon 599 accounts for 87% of BRAF mutations. Because the mutational status is unclear in pediatric solid neoplasms, we screened BRAF mutations comprehensively in our tumor series presented in childhood. Two pairs of primers were designed to amplify exons 11 and exon 15, respectively, and 181 tumor samples (65 neuroblastomas, 23 Wilms tumors, 19 hepatoblastomas, 16 teratomas, 17 rhabdomyosarcomas, 13 ganglioneuromas, etc.) were investigated by PCR-SSCP method. On agarose gel electrophoresis, amplified PCR fragments showed no size-altered changes in exons 11 and 15, and SSCP analysis revealed uniform band patterns in both exons. Subsequent direct sequencing of selected 10 samples confirmed only normal sequences without any nucleotide substitutions. The current study represents the first genetic analysis of the BRAF gene in pediatric solid tumors. Our data suggest that mutations of BRAF gene as a mechanism of tumorigenesis is unlikely to be associated with most childhood neoplasms.",

Genomic analyses of human cutaneous melanoma (CMM) models (N = 51, low passage) by classical and/or array CGH revealed frequent gains at chromosome 20q (65%, amplifications in 45%) repeatedly including the Aurora A gene locus. Accordingly, the majority of CMM cell cultures overexpressed Aurora A when compared to proliferating non-malignant cells. Moreover, CMM cells even when arrested in G1/S cell cycle phase contained readily detectable levels of Aurora A indicating incomplete degradation during mitosis. Already at low concentrations (10-100 nm), long-term (7-10 days) application of the pan-Aurora kinase inhibitor VE-465 completely prevented colony formation in all CMM models tested. In contrast, blockade of cell survival/proliferation and DNA synthesis as well as the induction of apoptosis by VE-465 distinctly differed in short-term experiments (up to 72 h exposure). Both cell cycle arrest and DNA synthesis blockade depended on the level of VE-465-mediated p53/p21 activation while p53/p21 unresponsiveness led to repetitive endoreduplication (>8n DNA content). In contrast, apoptosis induction by VE-465 and Aurora A siRNA did not correlate with p53/p21 responsiveness and DNA synthesis blockade. Moreover, application of the Aurora B-specific inhibitor ZM447439 and siRNA was less efficient to induce CMM cell death proofing that apoptosis induction by VE-465 depended predominantly on Aurora A targeting. In combination experiments with chemotherapeutic agents, VE-465 acted additive to antagonistic when applied concomitantly but in several cases even synergistic when applied consecutively. In summary, we suggest that the Aurora A kinase might represent a promising target of well-designed novel antimelanoma strategies.",

Along with some benign melanocytic tumors, the majority shows BRAF or NRAS mutation, but it is not known whether these are essential to all forms of melanocytic neoplasia. We screened 79 melanocytic tumors of different types for BRAF and NRAS mutations and looked at MAPK pathway activity using immunohistochemistry in a subset. Significant differences in BRAF exon 15 mutation frequency were found: 14/16 (87.5%) in common acquired naevi (CANs), 9/12 (75%) in CMs, 0/26 in Spitz naevi and 3/25 (12%) in blue naevi (p < 0.01). We looked at whether Spitz and blue naevi showed a compensatory increase in BRAF exon 11 and/or NRAS exons 1 and 2 mutations to account for the low BRAF exon 15 mutation frequency. NRAS mutations were found in only 1/16 (6.3%) Spitz naevi and 0/15 blue naevi. In addition, NRAS mutations were found in 2/11 (18.2%) CANs and 3/12 (25%) CMs. None of the tumors showed BRAF exon 11 mutations. Despite their low combined BRAF and NRAS mutation frequency, Spitz naevi showed strong MAPK pathway activation as measured by cytoplasmic expression of dually phosphorylated ERK1/2, while blue naevi had weak pathway activation. We conclude that BRAF and NRAS mutations are not necessary for melanocytic tumor development and that some types of tumor must arise by alternative mechanisms.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Although the antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of interferon (IFN)-alpha are widely recognized, its antitumour mechanisms are not completely known. Recent studies indicate that the derepressed expression of the catalytic subunit of telomerase, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), and telomerase activity (TA) are involved in the process of human carcinogenesis. Only a few studies have investigated the effects of IFN-alpha on hTERT and TA, with controversial results. Objectives To study the hTERT mRNA expression, TA and apoptosis in human melanoma cells treated with IFN-alpha.;Five human melanoma cell lines (Me665/2/21, Me665/2/60, HT-144, SK-Mel-28 and SK-Mel-5) were cultured in standard conditions and treated with 20000 IU mL-1 of human recombinant IFN-alpha-2b. Apoptosis was evaluated as hypodiploid DNA content determined by flow cytometry, caspase-3/7 activity by enzymatic assay, and poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase cleavage by Western blot analysis. IFN-alpha receptor (IFNA-R) and hTERT mRNA expression levels were evaluated by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. TA was evaluated by a polymerase chain reaction-based telomerase repeat amplification protocol assay.;Besides a variable degree of cell proliferation inhibition in all cell lines tested, we found different responses, ranging from no significant effects in SK-Mel-28 cells, to a high degree of apoptosis with no hTERT mRNA expression and TA modification in HT-144 cells, and induction of apoptosis, along with decrease in hTERT mRNA expression and TA in Me665/2/21 cells. No induction of apoptosis was observed in SK-Mel-5 and Me665/2/60 cells, although an early decrease in hTERT mRNA expression, and a minor increase of both hTERT mRNA expression and TA were found, respectively.;Our results suggest that the effects of IFN-alpha on hTERT and TA can result from the induction of apoptosis, but they can also occur through a direct modulation of hTERT. We hypothesize that, depending on the cellular context rather than the IFNA-R status of the targeted cells, IFN-alpha can elicit an apoptotic cell death; furthermore, different pathways of apoptosis, not necessarily involving telomerase, can be put into motion.",

Copy number changes of chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8 were studied by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Oncogenic mutations in UM involving exons 4 and 5 of GNAQ and GNA11, respectively, were analysed by sequencing.;All cell lines grew in suspension. UMT2 cells were homogeneous, UMT26 and UMT33 cells heterogeneous with regard to cell size and pigmentation. All UM cell lines revealed a melanocytic differentiation. UMT2 and 33 adhered on various extracellular matrices, while UMT26 only adhered to basal membrane extract (BME). This difference corresponded to the different expression of various integrins. Ki67 was expressed by 89% of UMT2 and 95% of UMT33 cells, which thus were in a proliferative stage, while only 2% of UMT26 cells revealed immunostaining for this proliferation marker. The doubling time of UMT2 was 3 days, 12 days for UMT33, and circa 3-4 months for UMT26. MLPA revealed disomy 3 in UMT2 and monosomy 3 in UMT33.

This technique uses the human monoclonal antibody (HumAb) L612, specific to a tumor-related antigen (ganglioside) GM3 that is expressed on the cell surface of human tumor cells and not normal cells. L612 coupled to a DNA oligonucleotide for exponential amplification by DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to enhance the detection signal. The DNA-HumAb conjugate was assessed for detection of a small number of human cancer cells after PCR amplification and Southern blot analysis. To assess the assay specificity human melanoma and other cancer cell lines, as well as healthy donor and melanoma patients, bloods were assessed. Cellular immuno-PCR requires < 1 ng/ml DNA-HumAb complex and was shown to have a detection level of < 10 cells in titration studies in which melanoma cells were diluted in 2 million healthy donor peripheral blood lymphocytes.

Our aim was herein to identify molecular mechanisms, which contribute to its overexpression. We found that cathepsin L protein expression correlated with mRNA level in tumor cells. Therefore, we focused on mechanisms involved in cathepsin L mRNA regulation. CpG island was localized in the 5' region of cathepsin L gene that encompassed regulatory regions identified as essential for promoter activity. CpG dinucleotides, not methylated in any melanoma cells analysed, were methylated in a B lymphoma cell line, which poorly express cathepsin L. Our data demonstrate that in lymphoma cells, cathepsin L silencing was methylation-dependent. Furthermore, gene amplification was involved in cathepsin L overexpression in one melanoma cell line, while transcriptional mechanisms but not mRNA stability are responsible of cathepsin L overexpression in others melanoma cells. In addition, NF-Y, Sp1, Sp2 and Sp3 transcription factors, essential to basal cathepsin L transcription, are not directly involved in overexpression. Thus, our data provides the first demonstration that cathepsin L expression in tumor cells is under the control of distinct molecular mechanisms.",

Tedious experiments are often required to determine which tumor types have amplifications of a specific oncogene. To facilitate rapid screening for molecular alterations in many different malignancies, a tissue microarray consisting of samples from 17 different tumor types was generated. Altogether, 397 individual tumors were arrayed in a single paraffin block. To determine whether results from the literature can be reproduced on minute tissue samples (diameter, 0.6 mm), amplification of three extensively studied oncogenes (CCND1, CMYC, and ERBB2) was analyzed in three fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments from consecutive sections cut from the tissue microarray. Amplification of CCND1 was found in breast, lung, head and neck, and bladder cancer, as well as in melanoma. ERBB2 was amplified in bladder, breast, colon, stomach, testis, and lung cancer. CMYC was amplified in breast, colon, kidney, lung, ovary, bladder, head and neck, and endometrial cancer. These results confirm and even extend existing data in the literature on such amplifications. In summary, we applied three fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments to analyze amplifications of three oncogenes in three x 397 tumors within a week. This demonstrates the power of using minute arrayed tissue specimens for tumor screening.",

Promoter analyses of the 5'-flanking region of the human GD3 synthase gene using luciferase gene reporter system showed the strong promoter activity in SK-MEL-2 cells. Deletion study revealed that the region as the core promoter from -1146 to -646 (A of the translational start ATG as position +1) was indispensable for endogenous expression of human GD3 synthase gene. This region lacks apparent TATA and CAAT boxes but contains putative binding sites for transcription factors c-Ets-1, CREB, AP-1 and NF-kappaB.

The recently developed BRAF V600E mutation-specific antibody has evolved into a feasible alternative to DNA analysis. The plethora of immunohistochemical protocols makes implementation tedious and, here we tested a set of manual and automated protocols and compared test performance with sequencing results. For assays, we employed formalin-fixed, in part decalcified, and paraffin-embedded tissue samples. Empiric testing of manual protocols included 10 variables in 17 protocols. Automated immunohistochemical staining and BRAF pyrosequencing served as independent test methods. Test performance measures were compared without considering 1 method as a standard. Four well-fixed samples (2WT/2Mut) were used for testing of all protocols and indicated 2 correctly classifying procedures. Practical performance assessment employed 33 independent tissue samples, composed of 27 leukemias (by pyrosequencing: 8 wild-type; 18 mutated; 1 noninformative) and 6 melanomas (V600E; V600K; wild-type, 2 each). Manual V600E staining was positive in 20 cases (19 of 20 V600E-containing samples plus the 1 sample that was noninformative), whereas all wild-type and V600K cases were immunonegative. Manual or automated staining as well as pyrosequencing would have missed an equal number of V600E-mutated cases and the correlation coefficient for these methods was 0.75 to 0.93 (substantial to almost perfect); the Youden index was 0.95. Detection of V600E-mutated BRAF at the protein level in routine and decalcified tissue samples is possible, and the presented manual protocols should expedite implementation in routine diagnostic practice.

All of the hypodiploid cells, but none of the hypotetraploid cells, contained chromosomes with long homogeneously staining regions (HSR's) when examined with quinacrine fluorescence. These long HSR's on an X-chromosome and derivative chromosome 15, produced characteristic patterns of positive- and negative-staining areas along the HSR's with both conventional Giemsa (G) staining and C-banding. The C- and G-positive regions stained with distamycin A-DAPI, which is specific for the centromeric heterochromatin of chromosomes 1, 9, 15p, 16, and Y. DNA extracted from MeWo cells and digested with the restriction enzymes KpnL or Sau3A exhibited marked amplification of a 1.8-kilobase fragment. The amplified Sau3A fragment (D15Z1) was cloned, mapped, and partially sequenced. The sequenced region contained a five-base-pair repeat unit (adenine-adenine-thymine-guanine-guanine) that has undergone considerable divergence. Estimates of the size of the HSR's and the amount of amplified DNA suggested that each HSR contained at least 30,000 copies of the 1.8-kb KpnL fragment, representing about 50% of each HSR. The amplified sequence was identified as one member of the previously described KpnL family of repeated sequences. In situ hybridization of D15Z1 to MeWo metaphase chromosomes resulted in heavy labeling over both HSR's. These data suggested that centromeric heterochromatin and neighboring sequences on chromosome 15 have been amplified and some of this material translocated to the X-chromosome.",

Because cyclin D1 has been reported to be overexpressed in malignant melanomas, but not in common acquired nevi, we hypothesized that cyclin D1 might be a useful marker to distinguish Spitz nevi from malignant melanoma. Thus, we assessed for cyclin D1 expression in 11 Spitz nevi (10 compound and 1 intradermal) and 9 malignant melanomas (4 Clark stages I-III and 5 Clark stages IV-V) using an immunohistochemical method and routinely fixed and processed tissues. The cyclin D1 results were arbitrarily divided into three groups: 0% to 10%, >10% to 25%, and >25%. We confirmed the observations reported previously by others that cyclin D1 is expressed in malignant melanomas but not in common acquired nevi. Unexpectedly, a relatively high number of cyclin D1-positive cells (i.e., >10%) was also found in all cases of Spitz nevus. However, unlike malignant melanoma, the cyclin D1 positivity in Spitz nevi was present in a zonal pattern. In other words, the number of cyclin D1-positive cells decreased as the lesion extended more deeply, with the number of positive cells in the reticular dermis being less than that in the papillary dermis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization methods were used to assess amplification of 11q13, the locus harboring the cyclin D1 gene, in four cases of Spitz nevus; all were disomic. Using the antibody MIB-1, we compared cyclin D1 expression to the proliferation rate in Spitz nevi. Despite the high cyclin D1 positivity, all Spitz nevi had a relatively low number of MIB-1-positive cells (mean=3.2%), which was significantly lower than that of malignant melanomas (mean=15.3%) (p < 0.001). Thus, unlike malignant melanoma, there appears to be a dissociation between cyclin D1 overexpression and cell proliferation in Spitz nevi.",

Frequencies of CTL as low as 10(-6) among CD8 cells were observed even in patients showing tumor regression. Little is known about the role of tumor-antigen-specific CD4 T cells in the context of these anti-vaccine responses. Therefore, we developed a very sensitive approach using fluorescent class-II-peptide multimers to detect antigen-specific CD4 T cells in vaccinated cancer patients. We produced HLA-DP4 multimers loaded with the MAGE-3(243-258) peptide and used them to stain ex vivo PBL from melanoma patients injected with dendritic cells pulsed with several class I and class II tumor antigenic peptides, including the MAGE-3(243-258) peptide.

        "Doc_abstract":"Recent high-throughput-sequencing of the cancer genome has identified oncogenic mutations in BRaf genetic locus as one of the critical events in melanomagenesis. In normal cells, the activity of BRaf is tightly regulated. Gain-of-function mutations like those identified in melanoma frequently lead to enhanced cell-survival and unrestrained growth. The activating mutation of BRaf will also induce the cells to senesce. However, the mechanism by which the oncogenic BRaf induces the senescent barrier remains poorly defined. microRNAs have regulatory functions toward the expression of genes that are important in carcinogenesis. Here we show that expression of several microRNAs is altered when the oncogenic version of BRaf is introduced in cultured primary melanocytes and these cells undergo premature cellular senescence. These include eight microRNAs whose expression rates are significantly stimulated and three that are repressed. While most of the induced microRNAs have documented negative effects on cell cycle progression, one of the repressed microRNAs has proven oncogenic functions. Ectopic expression of some of these induced microRNAs increased the expression of senescence markers and induced growth arrest and senescence in primary melanocytes. Taken together, our results suggest that the change in microRNA expression rates may play a vital role in senescence induced by the oncogenic BRaf.",

Although radiation therapy (RT) provides effective symptom palliation, there is a lack of toxicity and efficacy data when RT is combined with BRAFi, including vemurafenib and dabrafenib. This literature review provides a detailed analysis of potential increased dermatologic, pulmonary, neurologic, hepatic, esophageal, and bowel toxicity from the combination of BRAFi and RT for melanoma patients described in 27 publications. Despite 7 publications noting potential intracranial neurotoxicity, the rates of radionecrosis and hemorrhage from whole brain RT (WBRT), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), or both do not appear increased with concurrent or sequential administration of BRAFis. Almost all grade 3 dermatitis reactions occurred when RT and BRAFi were administered concurrently. Painful, disfiguring nondermatitis cutaneous reactions have been described from concurrent or sequential RT and BRAFi administration, which improved with topical steroids and time. Visceral toxicity has been reported with RT and BRAFi, with deaths possibly related to bowel perforation and liver hemorrhage. Increased severity of radiation pneumonitis with BRAFi is rare, but more concerning was a potentially related fatal pulmonary hemorrhage. Conversely, encouraging reports have described patients with leptomeningeal spread and unresectable lymphadenopathy rendered disease free from combined RT and BRAFi. Based on our review, the authors recommend holding RT ≥3 days before and after fractionated RT and ≥1 day before and after SRS. No fatal reactions have been described with a dose <4 Gy per fraction, and time off systemic treatment should be minimized. Future prospective data will serve to refine these recommendations. ",

The TVRC biopsy was performed to confirm diagnosis prior to enucleation and was subsequently analyzed using two techniques for chromosomes 1p, 3, 6, and 8: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in all patients, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) in 16 patients. Biopsies were compared with histological sections from matched enucleated eyes, which were microdissected following a hexagonal grid and analyzed with MLPA.;Twenty-four tumors were available for analysis. The TVRC biopsy identified chromosome 3 aberrations with MLPA in all cases (sensitivity = 100%), while FISH missed two cases (sensitivity = 89%). Conversely, FISH analysis demonstrated polyploidy of chromosome 3 in three additional cases missed by MLPA. Chromosome 8 aberrations were detected in 75% of cases with MLPA and 68% of cases with FISH. Heterogeneity of chromosomes 3 and 8 was shown in 3 (13%) and 11 tumors (46%), respectively, with an increased frequency of genetic aberrations toward the base of the tumor (P = 0.049). The study showed no difference in tumor size between heterogeneous and homogenous melanomas (P = 0.82).;Regardless of genetic heterogeneity, the TVRC biopsy identified all patients with a high risk of developing metastatic disease when a combination of chromosome 3 and 8 status was assessed.",

Although CD28 engagement triggers an early activation signal, activation-induced 4-1BB molecule on T cells transmits a crucial signal for further expansion and maturation of effector cells. In this report, the authors show that costimulation through CD28 and 4-1BB pathways synergistically enhances the therapeutic efficacy of T cells from tumor-draining lymph nodes. Intravenous adoptive transfer of costimulated T cells into mice bearing disseminated micrometastasis of a poorly immunogenic, major histocompatibility complex class I-negative A9P melanoma results in a 60% cure rate. Autopsy of mice that died after unsuccessful treatment revealed tumor growth in the liver, spleen, and skin with minimal or no evidence of pulmonary disease. In contrast, mice that received no treatment or noncostimulated T cells had massive pulmonary tumors, suggesting that adoptively transferred T cells are less effective against growth of extrapulmonary tumors. These results show that costimulation of tumor-draining lymph node T cells through CD28 and 4-1BB increases their potential for cancer immunotherapy and suggests that improper trafficking of tumor-reactive T cells to extrapulmonary sites must be improved to enhance clinical efficacy.",

Using an antibody to HSP90, we precipitated the telomerase activity associated with the molecular chaperone. The results of TRAP (telomeric repeat amplification protocol) experiments carried out on HSP90 immunoprecipitates showed that exposure to 100 ng/ml GA and 17-AAG induced a significant (P < 0.01) inhibition of telomerase activity, which was observed at earlier time points than drug-induced inhibition of cell proliferation. Superimposable results were obtained from TRAP experiments carried out on total JR8 protein extracts. To investigate whether the basal level of telomerase activity of the tumour cell system plays a role in determining the cellular response to 17-AAG, we compared the cytotoxic activity of the drug in JR8 cells and in two JR8-derived clones that were stably transfected with a hammerhead ribozyme targeting the RNA template of telomerase and were characterized by a markedly lower telomerase activity than the parental cells. The cytotoxicity results indicated that both ribozyme-transfectant clones were almost 2-fold more sensitive to 72 h 17-AAG exposure than JR8 cells as a consequence of a more than double apoptotic response [in terms of the percentage of apoptotic nuclei in cells stained with propidium iodide and the percentage of Tdt-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL)-positive cells]. In summary, our results suggest that (i) telomerase is a target of GA and 17-AAG action and its inhibition may contribute to the cytotoxic activity of the drugs, (ii) the basal level of telomerase activity of the tumour cell system may also have a role in influencing 17-AAG cytotoxicity.",

A 61-year-old woman underwent enucleation for rubeotic glaucoma and cells in the anterior chamber after proton-beam radiotherapy of a cilio-choroidal melanoma of the right eye. Examination of the enucleated eye was performed with immunohistochemistry, multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain gene rearrangements.

The glaucoma was caused by extensive infiltration of the iris and trabecular meshwork by the plasmacytoma cells.

We investigated TERT promoter and BRAF mutation frequency in respectively 94 and 86 consecutive MPNST cases from our institute.

In comparison with other neuroectodermal derived malignant neoplasms, TERT promoter mutations occur at relatively low frequency in MPNSTs.

BAP1 sequencing and gene dosage analysis of BAP1 exons by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification revealed a mutation in 33 (89%) of 37 tumors with monosomy 3 (M3) or isodisomy 3. BAP1 mutations were not detected in any of the 28 tumors with disomy 3 or partial monosomy 3 (partM3).

To further examine the association between enhanced tumorigenicity and the presence of HSR-bearing chromosomes, hybrid cell lines were constructed by fusing X-HSR-containing MeWo cells with ouabain-resistant, HPRT-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells and culturing in HAT medium containing ouabain. A hybrid containing the X-HSR chromosome and several MeWo chromosomes was more tumorigenic in BALB/c nude mice than derivative cells lacking the X-HSR and human chromosome 18. However, since this enhanced tumorigenicity could be due to sequences on either the X-HSR or chromosome 18, a second series of hybrids was constructed by micro-cell fusion. In this case, the tumorigenicity of hybrid cells containing 2 copies of the X-HSR as the only MeWo chromosome was similar to that of derivative cells lacking these chromosomes. Cytogenetic analysis revealed that the nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) on the HSR were inactive in the hybrid cells. Our data indicate that DNA sequences amplified on MeWo HSRs do not enhance tumorigenicity under experimental conditions in which rRNA genes are not expressed. As the only active NORs in MeWo HSR-containing cells are on the HSRs, we suggest that expression of these amplified rRNA genes is responsible for the selective growth advantage of these cell types in nude mice. Our data also indicate that the enhanced tumorigenicity of MeWo HSR-containing cells is not due to co-amplification of a dominant oncogene.",

The receiver operator characteristic curve analysis showed that the threshold value of copy number aberrations corresponding to 98% specificity for melanoma was 2.42 and the sensitivity using this threshold value was 92.5%.;MLPA could be used as an adjunctive diagnostic tool for melanocytic tumors.",

Advantages and limitations of diverse, already established methods, such as (fluorescence) in situ hybridization and mutation analysis, to detect these cytogenetic alterations in melanocytic tumours are described. In addition, the potential value of more novel techniques such as multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification is pointed out. This review demonstrates that at present cytogenetics has mainly increased our understanding of the pathogenesis of melanocytic tumours, with an important role for activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway in the initiation of melanocytic tumours. Mutations in BRAF (in common naevocellular naevi), NRAS (congenital naevi), HRAS (Spitz naevi) and GNAQ (blue naevi) can all cause MAPK activation. All these mutations seem early events in the development of melanocytic tumours, but by themselves are insufficient to cause progression towards melanoma. Additional molecular alterations are implicated in progression towards melanoma, with different genetic alterations in melanomas at different sites and with varying levels of sun exposure. This genetic heterogeneity in distinct types of naevi and melanomas can be used for the development of molecular tests for diagnostic purposes. However, at the moment only few molecular tests have become of diagnostic value and are performed in daily routine practice. This is caused by lack of large prospective studies on the diagnostic value of molecular tests including follow-up, and by the low prevalence of certain molecular alterations. For the future we foresee an increasing role for cytogenetics in the treatment of melanoma patients with the increasing availability of targeted therapy. Potential targets for metastatic melanoma include genes involved in the MAPK pathway, such as BRAF and RAS. More recently, KIT has emerged as a potential target in melanoma patients. These targeted treatments all need careful evaluation, but might be a promising adjunct for treatment of metastatic melanoma patients, in which other therapies have not brought important survival advantages yet.",

This study was to explore the distribution pattern, kinetic delivery of adenovirus, and therapeutic efficacy of the MSC loading of E1A mutant conditionally replicative adenovirus Adv-Stat3(-) which selectively replicated and expressed high levels of anti-sense Stat3 complementary DNA in breast cancer and melanoma cells.;We assessed the release ability of conditionally replicative adenovirus (CRAd) from MSC using crystal violet staining, TCID(50) assay, and quantitative PCR. In vitro killing competence of MSCs carrying Adv-Stat3(-) toward breast cancer and melanoma was performed using co-culture system of transwell plates. We examined tumor tropism of MSC by Prussian blue staining and immunofluorescence. In vivo killing competence of MSCs carrying Adv-Stat3(-) toward breast tumor was analyzed by comparison of tumor volumes and survival periods.;Adv-Stat3(-) amplified in MSCs and were released 4 days after infection. MSCs carrying Adv-Stat3(-) caused viral amplification, depletion of Stat3 and its downstream proteins, and led to significant apoptosis in breast cancer and melanoma cell lines. In vivo experiments confirmed the preferential localization of MSCs in the tumor periphery 24 hours after tail vein injection, and this localization was mainly detected in the tumor parenchyma after 72 hours. Intravenous injection of MSCs carrying Adv-Stat3(-) suppressed the Stat3 pathway, down-regulated Ki67 expression, and recruited CD11b-positive cells in the local tumor, inhibiting tumor growth and increasing the survival of tumor-bearing mice.;These results indicate that MSCs migrate to the tumor site in a time-dependent manner and could be an effective platform for the targeted delivery of CRAd and the amplification of tumor killing effects.",

In the last decade, investigational approaches using clinical samples for fully human antibody production have been performed, but there are still problems with efficiency and accuracy, which should be solved. In the present study, based on novel IgG antibody-measuring ELISA and antibody gene copy number-quantitative PCR, a human single B cell RT-PCR-mediated IgG monoclonal antibody (mAb) gene cloning method was established, and CMVpp65-specific human mAbs were successfully identified. Quantitative PCR for the human IgG mRNA copy number per cell demonstrated that the detection range was 10-250copies/cell. CMVpp65(+)surfaceIgG(+) B cells were collected from melanoma patients who showed high titers of serum anti-CMVpp65 IgG antibody. RT-PCR was successful in 64% (IGH) and 84% (β-actin) of 88 single B cells. Finally, both IGH and IGL gene amplifications in the same cell were successful in 21 single cells, and 18 IgG antibody genes specific for CMVpp65 antigen were cloned. Four of 13 recombinant human single-chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies showed strong responses to full-length CMVpp65 protein.

The BRAF(V599E) mutation was detected in 23 of 50 PTC (46%) and in three of four PTC-derived cell lines. The prevalence of the BRAF(V599E) mutation in PTC is the highest reported to date in human carcinomas, being only exceeded by melanoma. PTC with RET/PTC rearrangement as well as the TPC-1 cell line (the only one harboring RET/PTC rearrangement) did not show the BRAF(V599E) mutation. BRAF(V599E) mutation was not detected in any of 23 nodular goiters, 51 follicular adenomas and 18 follicular carcinomas. A distinct mutation in BRAF (codon K600E) was detected in a follicular adenoma. Activating mutations in RAS genes were detected in 15% of FA, 33% of FTC and 7% of PTC. BRAF(V599E) mutation did not coexist with alterations in any of the RAS genes in any of the tumors. These results suggest that BRAF(V599E) mutation is frequent in the etiopathogenesis of PTC. The BRAF(V599E) mutation appears to be an alternative event to RET/PTC rearrangement rather than to RAS mutations, which are rare in PTC.

Here, we describe the identification and characterization of SCH772984, a novel and selective inhibitor of ERK1/2 that displays behaviors of both type I and type II kinase inhibitors. SCH772984 has nanomolar cellular potency in tumor cells with mutations in BRAF, NRAS, or KRAS and induces tumor regressions in xenograft models at tolerated doses. Importantly, SCH772984 effectively inhibited MAPK signaling and cell proliferation in BRAF or MEK inhibitor-resistant models as well as in tumor cells resistant to concurrent treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. These data support the clinical development of ERK inhibitors for tumors refractory to MAPK inhibitors. ",

On the other hand, for ex vivo analysis of malignant cells from melanocytic tumors laser pressure catapulting is an essential prerequisite to obtain noncontaminated melanocytic preparations; however, laser pressure catapulting prepared material provides only nanogram amounts of RNA. In this study we present an approach to overcome these limitations by combining laser pressure catapulting and real-time polymerase chain reaction based SMART cDNA amplification technology. Reproducible and reliable hybridization patterns from about 500 laser pressure catapulting prepared cell equivalents from 22 cases of melanocytic tumors were generated using array analysis. Univariate analysis revealed significant differences of the expression pattern of melanocytic nevi, melanomas, and melanoma metastases. Multivariate analysis with four genes being the best univariate discriminative features (tyrosinase related protein 2, translation initiation factor 2 gamma, ubiquitine conjugating enzyme E2I and one expressed sequence tag) allowed clustering of nevi, melanomas, and melanoma metastases with an accuracy of 82%. Data validation was performed by additional quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (TaqMan-reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction). Taken together, this study shows, that (1) array analysis is feasible on tumors with rather low cell numbers, and (2) differences in expression profiles allow discrimination between benign and malignant lesions. Expression patterns of marker genes defined in unequivocal histopathologic entities may improve the diagnostic and prognostic assessment of difficult melanocytic lesions, which is still the hardest problem in dermatopathology.",

Although BRAF(V600E) is a driver oncoprotein and pharmacologic target in solid tumors such as melanoma, lung, and thyroid cancer, it remains unknown whether BRAF(V600E) is an appropriate therapeutic target in hematopoietic neoplasms. To address this critical question, we generated a mouse model expressing inducible BRAF(V600E) in the hematopoietic system, and evaluated the efficacy of pathway-targeted therapeutics against primary hematopoietic cells. In this model, BRAF(V600E) expression conferred cytokine-independent growth to monocyte/macrophage-lineage progenitors leading to aberrant in vivo and in vitro monocyte/macrophage expansion. Furthermore, transplantation of BRAF(V600E)-expressing bone marrow cells promoted an in vivo pathology most notable for monocytosis in hematopoietic tissues and visceral organs. In vitro analysis revealed that MAP-ERK kinase inhibition, but not RAF inhibition, effectively suppressed cytokine-independent clonal growth of monocyte/macrophage-lineage progenitors. However, combined RAF and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition effectively inhibited cytokine-independent colony formation, suggesting autocrine PI3K pathway activation. Taken together, these results provide evidence that constitutively activated BRAF(V600E) drives aberrant proliferation of monocyte-lineage cells.;This study supports the development of pathway-targeted therapeutics in the treatment of BRAF(V600E)-expressing hematopoietic neoplasms in the monocyte/histiocyte lineage.",

Furthermore, we discuss emerging therapeutic targets including novel oncogenic alterations (ROS1 rearrangements, FGFR1 amplifications, CMET amplifications, and others) and molecular features of the tumor microenvironment (including immune-checkpoint molecules such as CTLA4 and PD-1/PD-L1). We also discuss the potential role of advanced biomarker tests such as next-generation sequencing and \"liquid biopsies\" for patients with CNS metastases. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Detection and sequencing of mutations from clinical specimens is often complicated by the presence of an excess of nonmutated cells. To facilitate the detection and sequencing of minority mutations from clinical specimens, we developed wild-type blocking polymerase chain reaction (WTB-PCR). This technique allows sensitive detection of minority mutations in a tissue sample containing excess wild-type DNA. In WTB-PCR, a nonextendable locked nucleic acid (LNA) oligonucleotide binds tightly to a region of wild-type DNA known to develop point mutations. This LNA sequence blocks amplification of wild-type DNA during PCR while permitting amplification of mutant exon 15. Our results show that the LNA blocking oligonucleotide inhibits amplification of wild-type DNA in a dose-dependent manner. WTB-PCR was able to detect mutant DNA in clinical samples of melanoma tissue containing an excess of nonmelanoma cells. This method was also able to detect small amounts of point mutated or tandem mutated DNA diluted with a much larger concentration of wild-type DNA. This rapid and simple assay overcomes the limitations of current methods to detect minority mutations. The potential applications of WTB-PCR include early diagnosis and prognosis of various cancers.",

We identified 87 patients with 157 MBM treated with SRS alone from 2005 to 2013. Of these, 15 (17.2%) patients with 32 MBM (21.4%) received BRAFi therapy: three (20.0%) before SRS, two (13.3%) concurrent, and 10 (66.7%) after SRS. Overall survival (OS) was compared between cohorts using the product limit method. Intracranial outcomes were compared using cumulative incidence with competing risk for death. Baseline patient characteristics were similar between groups, except for the SRS cohort, which had higher rates of chemotherapy and more recent year of diagnosis. Radiation characteristics, including dose per fraction, total dose, gross tumor volume size, and prescription isodose, were also similar between cohorts. One-year outcomes - OS (64.3 vs. 40.4%, P=0.205), local failure (3.3 vs. 9.6%, P=0.423), and distant intracranial failure (63.9 vs. 65.1%, P=0.450) were not statistically different between the SRS+BRAFi and SRS-alone groups, respectively. The SRS+BRAFi group showed higher rates of radiographic radiation necrosis (RN) (22.2 vs. 11.0% at 1 year, P<0.001) and symptomatic radiation necrosis (SRN) (28.2 vs. 11.1% at 1 year, P<0.001). Multivariable analysis showed that BRAFi predicted an increased risk of both radiographic and SRN. SRS and BRAFi predicted for an increased risk of radiographic and SRN compared with SRS alone. Approaches to mitigate RN for patients receiving SRS and BRAFi should be considered until the clinical trial (http//:www.clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01721603) evaluating this treatment regimen is completed.

The aim of the present study was to disclose the role of BRAF mutations in thyroid carcinoma development. Seventy-two thyroid tumors, including 60 PTCs, six follicular adenomas, five follicular carcinomas, and one anaplastic carcinoma, were studied. BRAF mutation screening focused on exon 15 and exon 11 of the gene by single-stranded conformational polymorphism and sequence analysis. Search of RET/PTC expression was conducted with the RT-PCR technique. The molecular genetic study of the BRAF gene showed the presence of a missense thymine to adenine transversion at nucleotide 1796, resulting in the V599E substitution, in 24 of 60 PTCs (40%), none of six follicular adenomas, and none of five follicular carcinomas or one anaplastic carcinoma. Moreover, nine of 60 PTCs (15%) presented RET/PTC expression. A genetico-clinical association analysis showed a statistically significant correlation between BRAF mutation and development of PTCs of the classic papillary histotype (P = 0.038). On the contrary, no link could be detected between expression of BRAF(V599E) and age at diagnosis, gender, dimension, and local invasiveness of the primary cancer, presence of lymph node metastases, tumor stage, and multifocality of the disease. These data clearly confirm that BRAF(V599E) is the more common genetic alteration found to date in adult sporadic PTCs, that it is unique for this thyroid cancer histotype, and that it might drive the development of PTCs of the classic papillary subtype.",

Notably, BRAF (V600E) mutation is common in melanoma, colorectal carcinoma, lung carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, brain tumors, hairy cell leukemia, multiple myeloma, and histiocytoses.

Activating mutations in BRAF have recently been identified in melanomas, colorectal cancers, and thyroid and ovarian tumours. In the present study, an extensive characterization of BRAF and KRAS mutations has been performed in 264 epithelial and non-epithelial ovarian neoplasms. The epithelial tumours ranged from adenomas and borderline neoplasms to invasive carcinomas including serous, mucinous, clear cell, and endometrioid lesions. It is shown that BRAF mutations in ovarian tumours occur exclusively in low-grade serous neoplasms (33 of 91, 36%); these included serous borderline tumours (typical and micropapillary variants), an invasive micropapillary carcinoma and a psammocarcinoma. KRAS mutations were identified in 26 of 91 (29.5%) low-grade serous tumours, 7 of 49 (12%) high-grade serous carcinomas, 2 of 6 mucinous adenomas, 22 of 28 mucinous borderline tumours, and 10 of 18 mucinous carcinomas. Of note, two serous borderline tumours were found to harbour both BRAF and KRAS mutations. The finding that at least 60% of serous borderline tumours harbour mutations in two members of the ERK-MAP-kinase pathway (BRAF 36%, KRAS 30%) compared with 12% of high-grade serous carcinomas (BRAF 0%, KRAS 12%) indicates that the majority of serous borderline tumours do not progress to serous carcinomas.

We found that in a high percentage of neuroblastoma cell lines and patient samples with amplified MYCN, caspase-8 mRNA is not expressed. The caspase-8 gene, CASP8, was deleted or silenced by methylation in the neuroblastoma cell lines while methylation of its promoter region was the predominant mechanism for its inactivation in the patient tumor samples. Reintroduction of caspase-8 into the neuroblastoma cell lines resensitized these cells to drug-induced and survival factor dependent apoptosis. Subsequently others have also shown that caspase-8 is silenced by methylation in neuroblastoma and peripheral neural ectodermal tumors, and that the caspase-9 regulator Apaf-1 is silenced by methylation in melanoma cell lines and patient samples. We conclude that caspase-8 acts as a tumor suppressor gene in neuroblastomas, that its silencing provides a permissive environment for MYCN gene amplification once the tumors are treated with chemotherapeutic drugs/irradiation, and that expression of this gene in these tumor cells may be of clinical benefit. We also discuss the possible significance of the neural crest cell progenitor cell origin and the silencing of important apoptotic regulators via methylation in both neuroblastoma and melanoma tumors.",

High concentration of growth factors, increased melanin biosynthesis, and the rapid cell cycle progression may lead to the genetic material damage and the initiation of melanocyte malignant transformation in cell culture conditions. Mutations of genes of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway and CDKN2A gene are often found in the early stages of melanoma development. 12-O-Tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA)/phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) is considered to be an oncogenic factor, but there is no evidence that it is responsible for melanomagenesis initiation. The goal of this research was to assess the risk of the development of mutations in selected genes of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway and CDKN2A gene during the culturing of pigment cells in various growth media.;Three-hundred melanocyte cultures were established in 10 various growth media. The population doubling time of cultured cells was calculated for all the tested growth media. Cytogenetic analysis was carried out on the HRAS (exon 1 and 2), KRAS (exon 1 and 2), NRAS (exon 1 and 2), BRAF (exon 11 and 15), and CDKN2A (exon 1) genes.;Our study revealed that TPA and high concentrations of other growth factors intensify the proliferation of pigment cells, without the risk of damage to the analyzed genes.;It is necessary to carry out further similar studies on other signaling pathways to confirm cultured melanocytes transplantation safety.",

Diverse whole-genome amplification methods are applied to provide sufficient amount of DNA for comparative genome hybridization, single-nucleotide polymorphism, and microsatellite analyses. In these applications, the reliability of the amplification techniques is particularly important. In PCR-based approaches, the plateau effect can seriously alter the original relative copy number of certain chromosomal regions. To eliminate this distorting effect, we improved the standard degenerate oligonucleotide-primed PCR (DOP-PCR) technique by following the amplification status with quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR). With real-time detection of the products, we could eliminate DNA overamplification. Probes were prepared from 10 different tumor samples: primary and metastatic melanoma tissues, epidermoid and bronchioloalveolar lung carcinomas, 2 renal cell carcinomas, 2 colorectal carcinomas, and a Conn and Cushing adenoma. Probes were generated by using nonamplified and amplified genomic DNA with DOP-PCR and DOP-PCR combined with QRT-PCR. To demonstrate the reliability of the QRT-PCR based amplification protocol, altogether 152 relative copy number changes of 44 regions were determined. There was 85.6% concordance in copy number alterations between the QRT-PCR protocol and the nonamplified samples, whereas this value was only 63.8% for the traditional DOP-PCR. Our results demonstrate that our protocol preserves the original copy number of different chromosomal regions in amplified genomic DNA than standard DOP-PCR techniques more accurately.",

        "Doc_abstract":"In BRAF(V600)-mutant tumours, most mechanisms of resistance to drugs that target the BRAF and/or MEK kinases rely on reactivation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathway, on activation of the alternative, PI(3)K-AKT-mTOR, pathway (which is ERK independent) or on modulation of the caspase-dependent apoptotic cascade. All three pathways converge to regulate the formation of the eIF4F eukaryotic translation initiation complex, which binds to the 7-methylguanylate cap (m(7)G) at the 5' end of messenger RNA, thereby modulating the translation of specific mRNAs. Here we show that the persistent formation of the eIF4F complex, comprising the eIF4E cap-binding protein, the eIF4G scaffolding protein and the eIF4A RNA helicase, is associated with resistance to anti-BRAF, anti-MEK and anti-BRAF plus anti-MEK drug combinations in BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma, colon and thyroid cancer cell lines. Resistance to treatment and maintenance of eIF4F complex formation is associated with one of three mechanisms: reactivation of MAPK signalling, persistent ERK-independent phosphorylation of the inhibitory eIF4E-binding protein 4EBP1 or increased pro-apoptotic BCL-2-modifying factor (BMF)-dependent degradation of eIF4G. The development of an in situ method to detect the eIF4E-eIF4G interactions shows that eIF4F complex formation is decreased in tumours that respond to anti-BRAF therapy and increased in resistant metastases compared to tumours before treatment. Strikingly, inhibiting the eIF4F complex, either by blocking the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction or by targeting eIF4A, synergizes with inhibiting BRAF(V600) to kill the cancer cells. eIF4F not only appears to be an indicator of both innate and acquired resistance but also is a promising therapeutic target. Combinations of drugs targeting BRAF (and/or MEK) and eIF4F may overcome most of the resistance mechanisms arising in BRAF(V600)-mutant cancers. ",

In biliary tract cancer, reported BRAF mutation rates are highly controversial, ranging from 0 to 33% in adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder and 0 to 22% in cholangiocarcinoma. We here analyzed tissue microarrays of a large cohort of biliary tract cancer (n=377) including 159 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, 149 extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, and 69 adenocarcinomas of the gallbladder for BRAF V600E mutation using a highly sensitive immunohistochemical screening approach implementing the BRAF V600E protein-specific antibody VE1. All VE1-positive cases as well as 42 VE1-negative cases were additionally analyzed by Sanger sequencing. In total, only 5 VE1-positive cases were detected (5/377; 1%). BRAF V600E mutation was confirmed by direct sequencing in all cases. All 5 mutated cases were intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (5/159; 3%). None of the extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas and adenocarcinomas of the gallbladder were VE1 positive. Apart from the subtype restriction of BRAF V600E mutation to intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and a female predominance (4 female, 1 male), no significant correlation with clinicopathological data and patient outcome was detected. In conclusion, we demonstrate that BRAF V600E mutation is a rare event in biliary tract cancer, accounting for only 1% of all subtypes, and is restricted to intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. In addition, we demonstrate that VE1 immunohistochemistry is a feasible approach to routinely screen for BRAF V600E mutation in biliary tract cancer patients, thereby facilitating the detection of rare patients who may benefit from BRAF mutation-targeted therapies.",

Naturally ABCB1 expressing cells including V600E BRAF-mutated and BRAF wild-type melanoma cells and cells transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding for ABCB1 were used as cell culture models. ABCB1 expression and function were studied by the use of fluorescent and cytotoxic ABCB1 substrates in combination with ABCB1 inhibitors.;Docking experiments predicted PLX4032 to interact stronger with ABCB1 than PLX4720. Experimental studies using different cellular models and structurally different ABCB1 substrates confirmed that PLX4032 interfered stronger with ABCB1 function than PLX4720. For example, PLX4032 (20 µM) induced a 4-fold enhanced rhodamine 123 accumulation compared to PLX4720 (20 µM) in ABCB1-transduced UKF-NB-3 cells and reduced the IC₅₀ for the cytotoxic ABCB1 substrate vincristine in this model by 21-fold in contrast to a 9-fold decrease induced by PLX4720.;PLX4032 exerted stronger effects on ABCB1-mediated drug transport than PLX4720.

Melanocytic neoplasms in affected individuals harbored BRAF mutations, showed loss of BAP1 expression, and histologically resembled so-called \"atypical Spitz tumors\" (ASTs). ASTs are an ill-defined and probably heterogenous group of melanocytic tumors that display histologic features seen in both Spitz nevi and melanomas. Their biological behavior cannot be reliably predicted. In view of the histologic similarities of the familial tumors and ASTs, we hypothesized that a subset of ASTs might harbor genetic alterations seen in the familial tumors. To address this hypothesis, we analyzed 32 sporadic ASTs for BRAF mutations and for BAP1 expression. Nine (28%) sporadic ASTs showed loss of BAP1 expression, of which 8 (89%) had concomitant BRAF mutations. Only 1 of the BAP1-positive ASTs (4%) had a BRAF mutation (P<0.0001). BRAF-mutated, BAP1-negative tumors were primarily located in the dermis and were composed entirely or predominantly of epithelioid melanocytes with abundant amphophilic cytoplasm and well-defined cytoplasmic borders. Nuclei were commonly vesicular and exhibited substantial pleomorphism and conspicuous nucleoli. The combination of BRAF mutation and loss of nuclear BAP1 expression thus characterizes a subset of ASTs with distinct histologic features. The typical morphology of these tumors and BAP1 immunohistochemistry provide pathologic clues that will enable accurate identification of this subset. Future studies are necessary to determine whether this subset has a predictable clinical behavior.",

This inspires the effort to reverse this resistance or to uncover new vulnerabilities in such resistant cancers. IPA3 has been originally identified as a small molecule inhibitor of p21-activated protein kinase 1 (PAK1), a candidate therapeutic target in human malignancies. We have tested a battery of melanoma and colon carcinoma cell lines that carry mutations in BRAF, NRAS and KRAS genes and have observed that those with NRAS and KRAS mutations are more sensitive to killing by IPA3. Genetic manipulations suggest that the differential response depends not just on these oncogenes, but also on additional events that were co-selected during tumor evolution. Furthermore, sublethal doses of IPA3 or ectopic expression of dominant-negative PAK1 sensitized Ras-mutated cells to GDC-0897 and AZD6244, which otherwise have reduced efficiency against cells with activated Ras. Dominant-negative PAK1 also reduced the growth of NRAS-mutated cells in confluent cultures, but, unlike IPA3, caused no significant toxicity. Although it remains to be proven that all the effects of IPA3 are exclusively due to inhibition of PAK1, our findings point to the existence of selective vulnerabilities, which are associated with Ras mutations and could be useful for better understanding and treatment of a large subset of tumors.",

Cancer vaccines take many forms, including synthetic peptides, tumor cells and lysates, cell lines, and autologous antigen presenting cells like dendritic cells. The target antigens may be known, or \"defined\" in the vaccine, or unknown. In melanoma, more so than in other cancers, a large number of immunogenic \"shared\" antigens (tumor-specific or tumor-associated) have been identified. This allows for vaccination of groups of patients with the same vaccine, and also allows for testing for melanoma tumor immunity even when the vaccine does not include defined antigens. For the cancer vaccine field, the goal of a prognostic or predictive biomarker has yet to be achieved. However, the primary immunologic goal of any cancer vaccine is the induction (or amplification) of an immune response against the tumor, therefore the primary goal of immunologic monitoring in this setting, is testing for that response. In this chapter, we present standardized methodology from a central immunologic monitoring laboratory for melanoma cancer vaccine immune response assessment by the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbant Spot (ELISPOT) assay.

The ribozyme sequences were cloned into a plasmid expression vector containing EBV genomic elements that substantially prolong expression of genes delivered in vivo. The activity of various antitelomerase ribozymes or control constructs was examined after i.v. injection of cationic liposome:DNA complexes containing control or ribozyme constructs. Expression of ribozymes and mTER at various time points were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR. Telomerase activity was examined using the telomeric repeat amplification protocol.;Systemic administration of cationic liposome:DNA complexes containing a plasmid-expressed ribozyme specifically targeting a cleavage site at mTER nucleotide 180 significantly reduced the metastatic progression of B16-F10 murine melanoma. The antitumor activity of the anti-TER 180 ribozyme in mice was abolished by a single inactivating base mutation in the ribozyme catalytic core. The EBV-based expression plasmid produced sustained levels of ribozyme expression for the full duration of the antitumor studies. In addition to antitumor activity, cationic liposome:DNA complex-based ribozyme treatment also produced reductions in both TER levels and telomerase enzymatic activity in tumor-bearing mice.;Systemic, plasmid-based ribozymes specifically targeting TER can reduce both telomerase activity and metastatic progression in tumor-bearing hosts. The work reported here demonstrates the potential utility of plasmid-based anti-TER ribozymes in the therapy of melanoma metastasis.",

Three different TCR alpha chains and 7 TCR beta chains were found among the 84 alpha and 162 beta cDNA clones tested. By screening different combination of the alpha/beta chains using RNA electroporation, TRAV9-1 (Valpha22.1) and TRBV20-1 (Vbeta2) were found to be the functional pair in line SG6. Antibody blocking experiments confirmed that the specificity of TRAV9-1/TRBV20-1 mRNA-transfected T cells were CD4 dependent and HLA-DP4 restricted. A retroviral vector expressing both TRAV9-1 and TRBV20-1 was constructed and used for transduction of OKT3-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes from melanoma patients. TCR-transduced CD4 T cells were capable of recognizing peptide-pulsed antigen-presenting cells (Epstein-Barr virus transformed B-cells, dendritic cells, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells), and protein-pulsed dendritic cells. Transduced cells were also capable of proliferation upon peptide stimulation and recognized peptide concentrations that were recognized by the parental line (0.2 microM). In contrast to SG6, which could not recognize human tumors, TCR-transduced CD4 T cells could specifically recognize NY-ESO-1/HLA-DP4-expressing melanoma cells.

        "Doc_abstract":"Notch1 is an evolutionarily conserved transmembrane receptor involved in melanoma growth. Notch1 is first cleaved by furin in the Golgi apparatus to produce the biologically active heterodimer. Following ligand binding, Notch1 is cleaved at the cell membrane by proteases such as ADAM10 and -17 and membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), the latter of which we recently identified as a novel protease involved in Notch1 processing. The final cleavage is γ-secretase dependent and releases the active Notch intracellular domain (NIC). We now demonstrate that Notch1 directly regulates furin expression. Aside from activating Notch1, furin cleaves and activates several proteases, including MT1-MMP, ADAM10, and ADAM17. By chromatin immunoprecipitation and a reporter assay, we demonstrate that Notch1 binds at position -1236 of the furin promoter and drives furin expression. The Notch1-dependent enhancement of furin expression increases the activities of MT1-MMP and ADAM10 but not that of ADAM17, as demonstrated by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of furin, and promotes the cleavage of Notch1 itself. These data highlight a novel positive-feedback loop whereby Notch1-dependent furin expression can induce Notch1 signaling by increasing Notch1 processing and by potentiating the activity of the proteases responsible for Notch1 activation. This leads to Notch1 signal amplification, which can promote melanoma tumor growth and progression, as demonstrated by the inhibition of cell migration and invasion upon furin inhibition downstream of Notch1. Disruption of such feedback signaling might represent an avenue for the treatment of melanoma. ",

In contrast with BRAF-mutant (MT) melanoma, inhibition of the MAPK pathway is ineffective in the majority of BRAFMT colorectal cancer patients. Therefore, identification of novel therapies for BRAFMT colorectal cancer is urgently needed.;BRAFMT and wild-type (WT) colorectal cancer models were assessed in vitro and in vivo. Small-molecule inhibitors of MEK1/2, MET, and HDAC were used, overexpression and siRNA approaches were applied, and cell death was assessed by flow cytometry, Western blotting, cell viability, and caspase activity assays.;Increased c-MET-STAT3 signaling was identified as a novel adaptive resistance mechanism to MEK inhibitors (MEKi) in BRAFMT colorectal cancer models in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, MEKi treatment resulted in acute increases in transcription of the endogenous caspase-8 inhibitor c-FLIPL in BRAFMT cells, but not in BRAFWT cells, and inhibition of STAT3 activity abrogated MEKi-induced c-FLIPL expression. In addition, treatment with c-FLIP-specific siRNA or HDAC inhibitors abrogated MEKi-induced upregulation of c-FLIPL expression and resulted in significant increases in MEKi-induced cell death in BRAFMT colorectal cancer cells. Notably, combined HDAC inhibitor/MEKi treatment resulted in dramatically attenuated tumor growth in BRAFMT xenografts.;Our findings indicate that c-MET/STAT3-dependent upregulation of c-FLIPL expression is an important escape mechanism following MEKi treatment in BRAFMT colorectal cancer. Thus, combinations of MEKi with inhibitors of c-MET or c-FLIP (e.g., HDAC inhibitors) could be potential novel treatment strategies for BRAFMT colorectal cancer.",

Data representing chromosomes 3 and 8q were analyzed in depth since their association with CM patient survival is well-known. Unsupervised k-means cluster analysis was performed to detect latent structure in the data set. Principal component analysis (PCA) was also performed to determine the intrinsic dimensionality of the data. Survival analyses of the identified clusters were performed using Kaplan-Meier (KM) and log-rank statistical tests. Correlation with largest basal tumor diameter (LTD) was investigated.;Chromosome 3: A two-cluster (bimodal) solution was found in chromosome 3, characterized by centroids at unilaterally normal probe values and unilateral deletion. There was a large, significant difference in the survival characteristics of the two clusters (log-rank, p<0.001; 5-year survival: 80% versus 40%). Both clusters had a broad distribution in LTD, although larger tumors were characteristically in the poorer outcome group (Mann-Whitney, p<0.001). Threshold values of 0.85 for deletion and 1.15 for gain optimized the classification of the clusters. PCA showed that the first principal component (PC1) contained more than 80% of the data set variance and all of the bimodality, with uniform coefficients (0.28±0.03). Chromosome 8q: No clusters were found in chromosome 8q. Using a conventional threshold-based definition of 8q gain, and in conjunction with the chromosome 3 clusters, three prognostic groups were identified: chromosomes 3 and 8q both normal, either chromosome 3 or 8q abnormal, and both chromosomes 3 and 8q abnormal. KM analysis showed 5-year survival figures of approximately 97%, 80%, and 30% for these prognostic groups, respectively (log-rank, p<0.001). All MLPA probes within both chromosomes were significantly correlated with each other (Spearman, p<0.001).;Within chromosome 3, the strong correlation between the MLPA variables and the uniform coefficients from the PCA indicates a lack of evidence for a signature gene that might account for the bimodality we observed. We hypothesize that the two clusters we found correspond to binary underlying states of complete monosomy or disomy 3 and that these states are sampled by the complete ensemble of probes. Consequently, we would expect a similar pattern to emerge in higher-resolution MLPA data sets. LTD may be a significant confounding factor. Considering chromosome 8q, we found that chromosome 3 cluster membership and 8q gain as traditionally defined have an indistinguishable impact on patient outcome.",

In support of pediatric cancer development, a nonclinical juvenile rat toxicity study was conducted in which females had early vaginal opening (VO). It was hypothesized that the early VO was not indicative of sexual maturation, but a result of a local effect on the vagina. An investigative study was conducted that mimicked the definitive study design, with rats given DAB or vehicle orally from Postnatal Day (PND) 7 to 35 and with necropsy subsets just before VO, at the first and second estrus, along with age-matched controls. Histopathology was performed on reproductive tissues, including immunohistochemistry for BRAF expression. VO occurred earlier in DAB females than in controls (PND 27.2 vs. 31.5); however, the timing of the first estrus was unaffected (PND 34.0 vs. 33.0). DAB-treated females evaluated just before VO (PND 22.0) had mostly immature reproductive tracts with no evidence of ovulation, similar to age-matched controls; however, DAB-treated females had keratinized and histologically open vaginas. Also, there was raised skin around the urogenital area, which correlated with hyperplasia/keratosis of the vulvar skin and keratinization of the distal vagina. BRAF expression (evaluated in controls) was localized to these tissues. Thus, early VO in rats given DAB likely represents a local effect accelerating vaginal keratinization to become open and not accelerated sexual maturation. ",

Activated AMPK inhibits the protein kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin, thereby reducing the extent of protein translation and suppressing both cell growth and cell cycle entry. Recent reports indicate that AMPK-mediated growth inhibition is achieved via an action of the RAF-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in melanoma cells harboring the V600E mutant form of the BRAF oncogene. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer efficacy of AICAR by measuring its effects on proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression of BRAF wild-type and V600E-mutant thyroid cancer cell lines. We also explored the mechanism underlying these effects. AICAR inhibited the proliferation of BRAF V600E-mutant thyroid cancer cell lines more strongly than was the case with wild-type cell lines. The suppressive effect of AICAR on cell proliferation was associated with increased S-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Interestingly, AICAR suppressed phosphorylation of ERK and p70S6K in BRAF V600E-mutant thyroid cancer cells, but rather increased phosphorylation in wild-type cells. Together, the results indicate that AICAR-induced AMPK activation in BRAF V600E-mutant thyroid cancer cell lines resulted in increases in apoptosis and S-phase arrest via downregulation of ERK and p70S6K activity. Thus, regulation of AMPK activity may be potentially useful as a therapy for thyroid cancer if the cancer harbors a BRAF V600E mutation.",

In this study, cultures of epidermal melanocytes, progenitor cells of CMM, were established and harvested in the logarithmic phase of growth. Telomerase activity was looked for using a non-isotopic variant of the telomeric repeat amplification protocol, and transcript expression of the hTERT gene, the rate-limiting catalytic telomerase subunit, was investigated by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Neither telomerase activity nor hTERT mRNA could be detected in proliferating melanocyte cultures. Our in vitro data argue against the model of telomerase as a common biomarker of cell proliferation.

Different categories of cancer-associated antigens have been described as targets for CD8+ T cells in vitro and in vivo: (1) 'cancer-testis' (CT) antigens expressed in different tumors and normal testis; (2) melanocyte differentiation antigens; (3) point mutations of normal genes; (4) antigens that are overexpressed in malignant tissues, and (5) viral antigens. Clinical trials with antigenic peptides have been initiated to induce specific immunological responses in vivo. Immunological and clinical parameters for the assessment of peptide-specific reactions have been defined: DTH, CD8+ T cell, autoimmune and tumor regression responses. Preliminary results show that tumor-associated peptides alone elicit specific DTH and CD8+ T cell responses associated with tumor regression after intradermal vaccination. Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor has been shown to enhance peptide-specific immune reactions by amplification of dermal antigen-presenting dendritic cells. Complete tumor regressions have been observed after the induction of CD8+ T cell responses by peptide immunization. Based on these results, active immunotherapy with tumor-associated antigens may be a promising approach for patients in adjuvant treatment situations, who are at high risk for tumor recurrence. Recently, a strategy utilizing spontaneous antibody responses to tumor-associated antigens (SEREX) has led to the identification of a new CT antigen, NY-ESO-1. NY-ESO-1-specific spontaneous humoral and cellular immune responses were found in approximately 50% of patients with NY-ESO-1-positive tumors.

        "Doc_abstract":"Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) synthesized in Golgi apparatus by sequential transfer of sugar residues to a ceramide lipid anchor are ubiquitously distributing on vertebrate plasma membranes. A standardized method allowing for high-throughput structural profiling and functional characterization of living cell surface GSLs is of growing importance because they function as crucial signal transduction molecules in various processes of dynamic cellular recognitions. However, methods are not available for amplification of GSLs, while the genomic scale PCR amplification permits large-scale mammalian proteomic analysis. Here we communicate such an approach to a novel \"omics\", namely, glycosphingolipidomics based on the \"glycoblotting\" method. The method, which involves selective ozonolysis of the C-C double bond in the ceramide moiety and subsequent enrichment of generated GSL aldehydes by chemical ligation using an aminooxy-functionalized gold nanoparticle (aoGNP) should be of widespread utility for identifying and characterizing whole GSLs present in the living cell surfaces. The present protocol using glycoblotting permitted MALDI-TOFMS-based high-throughput structural profiling of mouse brain gangliosides such as GM1, GD1a/GD1b, and GT1b for adult or GD3 in the case for the embryonic mouse. When mouse melanoma B16 cells were subjected to this protocol, it was demonstrated that gangliosides enriched from the plasma membranes are the only GM3 bearing microheteogeneity in the structure of the N-acyl chain. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that aoGNP displaying whole GSLs blotted from mouse B16 melanoma cell surfaces can be used directly for monitoring the specific interaction with the self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of Gg3Cer (gangliotriaosylceramide). Our results indicate that GSL-selective enrichment onto aoGNP from living cell surfaces allows for rapid reconstruction of plasma membrane models mimicking the intact GSL microdomain feasible for further structural and functional characterization.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Transcriptional targeting of cytotoxic genes is an important way to control toxicity associated with gene transfer therapies, but supposedly, tissue-specific promoters are often either very weak and/or leaky. In addition, the phenotypic leakiness of such tissue-specific promoters is dependent upon the toxicity of the gene being used. Therefore, we devised a transcriptional feedback loop to restrict gene expression of very potent genes to melanoma cells. We screened different elements of the human tyrosinase promoter to find one which gave no detectable expression in non-melanoma cells but was active in melanoma cell lines. This weak, but highly tissue specific, element (Tyr-300) was then used as the basis for a transcriptional amplification feedback loop in which a consensus heat shock element (HSE) was cloned upstream of Tyr-300. The cytotoxic gene was cloned downstream of the HSE-Tyr-300 element along with a mutated form of the heat shock factor-1 (HSF-1) transcription factor, which no longer requires cellular stress to activate its trimerisation, nuclear localisation and transcriptional activation properties. Low levels of expression from Tyr-300 initiated expression of both the cytotoxic and the HSF-1 genes in melanoma cells. Gradual build up of HSF-1 amplified expression through binding to the HSE to give levels of cytotoxicity similar to that provided by a CMV promoter. However, no leakiness was observed in multiple non-melanoma cell lines tested. In addition to amplifying low levels of weak tissue-specific expression, the use of HSF-1 also leads to activation of endogenous stress-related genes such as hsp70. Induction of these genes, in the presence of cell killing by the cytotoxic gene, is a highly immunostimulatory event which enhances the antitumour vaccination effects of direct tumour cell destruction. Having demonstrated the compatibility of the component elements in plasmid form, we incorporated the feedback loop into a hybrid LTR-modified retroviral vector and confirmed that the system can be effective in the form of a viral vector. The format of the feedback loop described here could be exploited for any tissue type in which a highly tissue-specific element can be identified but which is itself too weak to be effective therapeutically.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Activating mutations of BRAF occur in approximately 7% of all human tumors and in the majority of melanomas. These tumors are very sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK), which causes loss of D-cyclin expression, hypophosphorylation of Rb, and G(1) arrest. Growth arrest is followed by differentiation or senescence and, in a subset of BRAF mutant tumors, by apoptosis. The former effects result in so-called \"stable disease\" and, in patients with cancer, can be difficult to distinguish from indolent tumor growth. The profound G(1) arrest induced by MEK inhibition in BRAF mutant tumors is associated with a marked decline in thymidine uptake and is therefore potentially detectable in vivo by noninvasive 3'-deoxy-3'-[(18)F]fluorothymidine ([(18)F]FLT) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. In SKMEL-28 tumor xenografts, MEK inhibition completely inhibited tumor growth and induced differentiation with only modest tumor regression. MEK inhibition also resulted in a rapid decline in the [(18)F]FLT signal in V600E BRAF mutant SKMEL-28 xenografts but not in BRAF wild-type BT-474 xenografts. The data suggest that [(18)F]FLT PET can effectively image induction of G(1) arrest by MEK inhibitors in mutant BRAF tumors and may be a useful noninvasive method for assessing the early biological response to this class of drugs.",

Using DNA from paired normal and microdissected tumor samples, LOH at microsatellite loci was determined after polymerase chain reaction amplification.

Treatment of established melanoma metastases with ch14.18-IL-2 resulted in eradication of disease followed by a vaccination effect protecting mice from lethal challenges with wild-type tumor calls. In a syngeneic neuroblastoma model, targeted IL-2 was effective in the amplification of a weak memory immune response previously induced by IL-12 gene therapy using an engineered linear version of this heterodimeric cytokine.

Here, we modeled disease progression using EGFR-mutant human tumor cell lines. Although five of six models displayed alterations already found in humans, one harbored an unexpected secondary NRAS Q61K mutation; resistant cells were sensitive to concurrent EGFR and MEK inhibition but to neither alone. Prompted by this finding and because RAS/RAF/MEK mutations are known mediators of acquired resistance in other solid tumors (colon cancers, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and melanomas) responsive to targeted therapies, we analyzed the frequency of secondary KRAS/NRAS/BRAF/MEK1 gene mutations in the largest collection to date of lung cancers with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs. No recurrent NRAS, KRAS, or MEK1 mutations were found in 212, 195, or 146 patient samples, respectively, but 2 of 195 (1%) were found to have mutations in BRAF (G469A and V600E). Ectopic expression of mutant NRAS or BRAF in drug-sensitive EGFR-mutant cells conferred resistance to EGFR TKIs that was overcome by addition of a MEK inhibitor. Collectively, these positive and negative results provide deeper insight into mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs in lung cancer and inform ongoing clinical trials designed to overcome resistance. In the context of emerging knowledge about mechanisms of acquired resistance to targeted therapies in various cancers, our data highlight the notion that, even though solid tumors share common signaling cascades, mediators of acquired resistance must be elucidated for each disease separately in the context of treatment.",

Because of paradoxical pathway activation, both agents were demonstrated to promote growth and metastasis of tumor cells with RAS mutations in preclinical models and are contraindicated for treatment of cancer patients with BRAF WT background, including patients with KRAS or NRAS mutations. In order to eliminate the issues associated with paradoxical MAPK pathway activation and to provide therapeutic benefit to patients with RAS mutant cancers, we sought to identify a compound not only active against BRAF V600E but also wild type BRAF and CRAF.

Initially described in melanoma, colon and papillary thyroid carcinoma, these alterations have also been observed in primary nervous system tumors albeit at a low frequency. We analyzed exon 15 of BRAF spanning the V600 locus by direct sequencing in 1,320 adult and pediatric tumors of the nervous system including various types of glial, embryonal, neuronal and glioneuronal, meningeal, adenohypophyseal/sellar, and peripheral nervous system tumors. A total of 96 BRAF mutations were detected; 93 of the V600E type and 3 cases with a three base pair insertion between codons 599 and 600. The highest frequencies of BRAF (V600E) mutations were found in WHO grade II pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (42/64; 66%) and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas with anaplasia (15/23; 65%), as well as WHO grade I gangliogliomas (14/77; 18%), WHO grade III anaplastic gangliogliomas (3/6) and pilocytic astrocytomas (9/97; 9%). In pilocytic astrocytomas BRAF (V600E) mutation was strongly associated with extra-cerebellar location (p = 0.009) and was most frequent in diencephalic tumors (4/12; 33%). Glioblastomas and other gliomas were characterized by a low frequency or absence of mutations. No mutations were detected in non-glial tumors, including embryonal tumors, meningiomas, nerve sheath tumors and pituitary adenomas. The high mutation frequencies in pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas, gangliogliomas and extra-cerebellar pilocytic astrocytomas implicate BRAF (V600E) mutation as a valuable diagnostic marker for these rare tumor entities.

Complementary DNA's for topoisomerase IIalpha were cloned from both FEM-X and FVP3, the most resistant mutant. Deletion of nucleotides 1320-1322 (or Ala429 from the resulting topoisomerase IIalpha protein) was unique to the cDNA from the drug resistant cell line. Expression of the mutant mRNA increases in parallel with VP-16 resistance in this series of cell lines. Restriction analysis and Southern analysis with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes were used to quantify the ratio of wild-type to mutant topoisomerase IIalpha alleles present in DNA amplified by PCR from both FEM-X and the drug resistant sublines. This analysis shows that in cell lines of increasing drug resistance, the number of mutant topoisomerase IIalpha alleles increases incrementally along with a concomitant decrease in the number of wild-type alleles. By quantitative Southern analysis of genomic DNA the total number of topoisomerase IIalpha alleles in FVP3 is approximately 2-fold that in the parental cells. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with a chromosome l7 paint reveals that amplification of the topoisomerase IIalpha locus in FVP3 correlates with an increase in the number of chromosome 17's, specifically the long arm. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrates that FEM-X contains three copies of chromosome 17, two of which are morphologically normal. During drug selection, FVP3 has gained 2-3 additional copies of the long arm of chromosome 17, the chromosomal location of the topoisomerase IIalpha locus. In this subline it is likely that three copies of the topoisomerase IIalpha gene are found on normal chromosome 17's and two on an isochromosome of the long arm of 17. By pulsed field gel electrophoresis, we were able to detect changes in the restriction pattern of the region of the long arm of chromosome 17 around the topoisomerase IIalpha locus that correlate with observed cytogenetic changes in FVP3. These results suggest that the acquisition of the mutant allele of topoisomerase IIalpha confers a selective advantage to cells in the presence of VP-16. As the drug concentration increased during the selection process, surviving sublines show preferential expression of the mutant topoisomerase IIalpha mRNA over that of the wild-type which is associated with a concomitant increase in the number of mutant topoisomerase IIalpha alleles.",

Colorectal cancer with V600E BRAF mutation has shown relative resistance to standard chemotherapy regimens, as well as lack of efficacy to vemurafenib in clinical trials. New treatments are needed for BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer. We report a case of a patient with BRAF-mutant metastatic colon cancer whose disease had progressed on FOLFOX plus bevacizumab and subsequent FOLFIRI plus cetuximab. Based on preclinical data published in Nature in 2012 suggesting that successful therapeutic targeting of BRAF in colorectal cancer may require concomitant targeting of the EGFR, we offered this patient without other attractive options the combination of sorafenib plus cetuximab, in off-label use with informed consent. Sorafenib and cetuximab therapy led to a mixed radiographic response with some areas showing dramatic improvement and other areas showing stable disease over a 7-month period which is a notably long period of progression-free survival for V600E BRAF mutated colon cancer. The cetuximab plus sorafenib therapy was very well-tolerated by the patient who remained on it long enough until another therapy option, regorafenib, was approved in September 2012. The patient was offered single agent regorafenib at the time of progression. At the time of progression on single agent regorafenib, panitumumab was combined with regorafenib and this was also well-tolerated and appeared to slow disease progression.

It is activated by diverse stimuli, such as growth factors, nutrients, energy and stress signals, and essential signalling pathways, such as PI3K, MAPK and AMPK, in order to control cell growth, proliferation and survival. mTORC2 is considered resistant to rapamycin and is generally insensitive to nutrients and energy signals. It activates PKC-α and AKT and regulates the actin cytoskeleton. Deregulation of multiple elements of the mTOR pathway (PI3K amplification/mutation, PTEN loss of function, AKT overexpression, and S6K1, 4EBP1 and eIF4E overexpression) has been reported in many types of cancers, particularly in melanoma, where alterations in major components of the mTOR pathway were reported to have significant effects on tumour progression. Therefore, mTOR is an appealing therapeutic target and mTOR inhibitors, including the rapamycin analogues deforolimus, everolimus and temsirolimus, are submitted to clinical trials for treating multiple cancers, alone or in combination with inhibitors of other pathways. Importantly, temsirolimus and everolimus were recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma, PNET and giant cell astrocytoma. Small molecules that inhibit mTOR kinase activity and dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitors are also being developed.

Deletion of the p16 locus has been observed in tumor cell lines and, less frequently, in primary human neoplasms. We analyzed 31 glioblastomas and identified 6 cases with hemizygous and 6 with homozygous deletions of the p16 locus. Eight of these cases showed a concurrent amplification of the EGFR gene (epidermal growth factor receptor) while the overall frequency was 35%. This close correlation suggests that deletion of the p16 chromosomal region constitutes another genetic hallmark of the primary glioblastoma, which rapidly develops de novo, without a less malignant precursor lesion and for which EGFR amplification is a characteristic genetic change. The p16 protein was not detectable in 15 of 22 glioblastomas but only 4 of these showed homozygous deletion of the gene. The alternative transcript p16 beta, for which a growth-suppressing function has been suggested, was co-expressed with p16 alpha mRNA in most cases. Hypermethylation of CpG islands in the 5' region of the p16 gene was identified in only 1 case, suggesting that this alternative mechanism of gene silencing is rarely responsible for loss of p16 expression in glioblastomas. Likewise, only 1 glioblastoma carried a p16 mutation and in addition, unexpectedly, a homozygous deletion of p16 in approximately 80% of tumor cells.

Protein levels of BANCR targets were determined by western blotting and fluorescent immunohistochemistry.;BANCR expression was significantly decreased in 113 NSCLC tumor tissues compared with normal tissues. Additionally, reduced BANCR expression was associated with larger tumor size, advanced pathological stage, metastasis distance, and shorter overall survival of NSCLC patients. Reduced BANCR expression was found to be an independent prognostic factor for NSCLC. Histone deacetylation was involved in the downregulation of BANCR in NSCLC cells. Ectopic expression of BANCR impaired cell viability and invasion, leading to the inhibition of metastasis in vitro and in vivo. However, knockdown of BANCR expression promoted cell migration and invasion in vitro. Overexpression of BANCR was found to play a key role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the regulation of E-cadherin, N-cadherin and Vimentin expression.;We determined that BANCR actively functions as a regulator of EMT during NSCLC metastasis, suggesting that BANCR could be a biomarker for poor prognosis of NSCLC.",

Monkey kidney COS-7 cells and human amelanotic and melanotic melanoma cells were then cotransfected by both HT and TRP-1 or transfected individually with each gene. The transfectants were examined for mRNA expression by reverse transcription-mediated RNA-PCR amplification. HT or TRP-1 mRNA was strongly expressed in HT or TRP-1 transfectants and cotransfectants of the two genes. Both light and electron microscopic observations indicated that degeneration and premature death of melanocytes occurred in HT transfectants, but not in TRP-1 transfectants or in HT and TRP-1 cotransfectants. Cotransfected cells from five cell lines revealed numerous granular reaction products with an anti-TRP-1 antibody and lysosomal granules with electron-dense material. Our melanin assay confirmed the new production of melanin pigments in these cells, indicating that the lysosomal granules would contain melanin pigments. The gene expression studies of lysosomal protein (beta-galactosidase, CD63, Lamp-1, and Lamp-2) revealed a dramatically elevated gene expression of Lamp-1, which is associated with the membrane receptor of lysosomal granules, in HT- and TRP-1-cotransfected cells. Conversely, the treatment of melanoma cells with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides against Lamp-1 resulted in a decreased expression of TRP-1 protein by immunoprecipitation, supporting the observations of the HT and TRP-1 cotransfection study regarding the up-regulation of Lamp-1 expression. We conclude that HT, TRP-1, and Lamp-1 gene products may function together, being expressed as a multiprotein complex within the melanosomal compartment. Specifically, HT and TRP-1 may function together via Lamp-1 by stabilizing the enzyme-protein complex within the melanosome and prevent the premature death of melanocytes due to tyrosinase-mediated cytotoxicity.",

BRCA1 interacts with BARD1 to constitute a RING heterodimer-type E3 ubiquitin ligase. BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that also regulates similar cellular events, including cell-cycle control, transcription, chromatin modification and DNA damage response. Germline mutations in BRCA1 predispose individuals to breast, ovarian, fallopian tube, peritoneal, pancreatic and prostate cancers, whereas BAP1 mutations combined with certain types of DNA damage provoke malignant mesothelioma, uveal and cutaneous melanoma, lung adenocarcinoma and renal cell carcinoma. Although BAP1 was initially discovered as a BRCA1-associated protein, recent mass-spectrometric screens of BAP1 interactors failed to detect BRCA1, raising questions about their presumed endogenous interaction. However, in addition to physical interaction, new evidence indicates a functional correlation between the two proteins. This review summarizes BAP1 function in histone modification and the DNA damage response, focusing on BAP1's relevance to BRCA1 function. An understanding of the cooperative functions between BRCA1 and BAP1 may uncover opportunities for new drug targets in a variety of related cancers. ",

The primary structure has been elucidated by cloning the cDNA from a lambda gt11 expression vector library constructed with megakaryocytic mRNA. Monoclonal antibodies were used as probes with an APAAP amplification of the signal. The 5' region was further cloned in a lambda gt10 randomly primed cDNA library. The initiation codon was immediately followed by a sequence coding for the tetrapeptide corresponding to the NH2-terminal sequence identified in a microsequencing procedure. Only one species of mRNA was found with an estimated size of 1.4 kilobase. CD9 antigen appears to be a 227-amino acid molecule with four hydrophobic domains and one N-glycosylation site. Sequence and structural comparisons showed extensive similarity of the CD9 antigen with a 237-amino acid molecule described previously as the human melanoma-associated antigen ME491 and a Schistosoma mansoni membrane protein of 218 amino acids.

However, therapy with pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-12, is limited in practice due to adverse systemic effects. Spatially-restricted gene expression circumvents this problem by enabling localized amplification. Intracellular co-delivery of gold nanorods (AuNR) and a heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) promoter-driven expression vector enables gene expression in response to near infrared (NIR) light. AuNRs absorb the light, convert it into heat and thereby stimulate photothermal expression of the cytokine. As proof-of-concept, human HeLa and murine B16 cancer cells were transfected with a HSP70-Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) plasmid and polyethylenimine (PEI)-conjugated AuNRs. Exposure to either 42 °C heat-shock or NIR light induced significant expression of the reporter gene. In vivo NIR driven expression of the reporter gene was confirmed at 6 and 24 h in mice bearing B16 melanoma tumors using in vivo imaging and flow-cytometric analysis. Overall, we demonstrate a novel opportunity for site-directed, heat-inducible expression of a gene based upon the NIR-absorbing properties of AuNRs and a HSP70 promoter-driven expression vector. ",

We aimed to assess the antitumour activity and safety of dabrafenib plus trametinib in patients with BRAF(V600E)-mutant NSCLC.;In this phase 2, multicentre, non-randomised, open-label study, we enrolled adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with pretreated metastatic stage IV BRAF(V600E)-mutant NSCLC who had documented tumour progression after at least one previous platinum-based chemotherapy and had had no more than three previous systemic anticancer therapies. Patients with previous BRAF or MEK inhibitor treatment were ineligible. Patients with brain metastases were allowed to enrol only if the lesions were asymptomatic, untreated (or stable more than 3 weeks after local therapy if treated), and measured less than 1 cm.

However, frequency of mutations varies among the reported studies, which might be due to presence of undetected gross rearrangements of BAP1 gene that might escape detection by sequencing strategy. We investigated the presence and frequency of gross genomic rearrangements in the BAP1 gene by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) in 17 Japanese cases of MM tumors. We found five tumors with partial deletion of BAP1 gene; each tumors displayed partial deletion of exons 1-4 (MM39), exons 1-5 (MM48), exons 11-17 (MM57), exons 1-15 (MM19) and exons 1-16 (MM21). Two tumors (MM34, MM14) had biallelic deletion and four tumors (MM29, MM35, MM45 and MM56) had monoallelic deletion of entire BAP1 gene. Therefore, MLPA analysis revealed large gene rearrangements of BAP1 gene in 65% of MM (11/17). Unusually high frequency of large deletions indicates that the 3p21 chromosomal region surrounding BAP1 gene is structurally unstable.

A novel approach to achieve this goal is the targeting of cytokines into the tumor microenvironment with antibody-cytokine fusion proteins, called immunocytokines. This report summarizes therapeutic efficacy and immune mechanisms involved in targeting IL-2 to syngeneic tumors and describes their extended use as a synergistic treatment modality for cancer vaccines and antiangiogenesis. Treatment of established melanoma and colon carcinoma metastases with IL-2 immunocytokines resulted in eradication of disease, followed by a vaccination effect protecting mice from lethal challenges with wild-type tumor cells. In a syngeneic neuroblastoma model, targeted IL-2 elicited effective antitumor responses mediated by NK cells in the absence of a T-cell memory. Interestingly, targeted IL-2 was effective in amplification of memory immune responses previously induced by cancer vaccines. Furthermore, a synergistic effect achieved by combining targeted IL-2-immunotherapy with an antiangiogenic inhibitor of integrin alpha(v)beta(3) extends the potential of this immunotherapeutic strategy in combination with antiangiogenesis as demonstrated in three syngeneic tumor models. Based on these findings, targeted IL-2 may provide an effective tool for the adjuvant treatment of cancer either applied as a single strategy or in combination with cancer vaccines and antiangiogenic strategies.",

        "Doc_abstract":"More than ten years have passed since the sentinel node (SN) concept for gastric cancer surgery was first discussed. Less invasive modified surgical approaches based on the SN concept have already been put into practice for malignant melanoma and breast cancer, however the SN concept is not yet placed in a standard position in gastric cancer surgery even after two multi-institutional prospective clinical trials, the Japan Clinical Oncology Group trial (JCOG0302) and the Japanese Society for Sentinel Node Navigation Surgery (SNNS) trial. What is the problem in the clinical application of the SN concept to gastric cancer surgery? There is no doubt that we need reliable indicator(s) to determine with certainty the absence of metastasis in the lymph nodes in order to avoid unnecessary lymphadenectomy. There are several matters of debate in performing the actual procedure, such as the type of tracer, the site of injection, how to detect and harvest, how to detect metastases of SNs, and learning period. These issues have to be addressed further to establish the most suitable procedure. Novel technologies such as indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging and one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) may overcome the current difficulties. Once we know what the problems are and how to tackle them, we can pursue the goal.",

Loss of the telomeric repeats promotes genomic instability, which is the hallmark of most cancer cells. Whether this loss differs among tumor cells with malignant potential is unknown and was the goal of this study. An all-human telomeric DNA probe was used to perform fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and the telomeric signals in interphase nuclei were quantitated using a computer software package. Southern blot analysis was carried out to measure terminal restriction fragment length (TRFL) in multiple cancer cell lines, including nonmetastatic and metastatic human breast, lung, prostate, colon, brain, and renal carcinomas, as well as human and murine melanoma clones and somatic cell hybrids. The metastatic capability of all cell lines, clones and somatic cell hybrids was evaluated subsequent to orthotopic implantation into nude mice. FISH preparations with telomeric DNA probes showed that the mean percent telomeric area in the metastatic nuclei was significantly greater than their nonmetastatic counterparts and Southern blotting in selected samples confirmed our findings. These data suggest that amplification of telomeres is directly correlated with invasive and metastatic potential of murine or human tumor cells.",

From the analysis of patients carrying deletions and translocations involving the distal short arm of the X chromosome (Xp22.3) we have identified a region of approximately 110 kb in which the OA1 gene must lie. We have extensively searched for genes in this region using a variety of techniques which included exon amplification, cDNA selection and direct hybridization of cosmid inserts to cDNA libraries. Putative exons identified by exon amplification were used to screen a human retina cDNA library and several cDNA clones corresponding to an approximately 7.5 kb transcript were isolated and characterized. Transcripts of this newly identified gene were found to be abundant in retina and melanoma and could also be detected in brain, placenta, lung, kidney and pancreas. Interestingly, sequence analysis revealed that this new gene encodes a 1616 amino acid protein sharing significant similarities with the Apical Protein from Xenopus laevis (APX) which is implicated in amiloride-sensitive sodium channel activity. The gene, termed APXL (APX-Like), spans approximately 160 kb, contains 10 exons and covers over 70% of the 110 kb critical region for OA1. A truncated pseudogene sharing very high levels of homology with the rat eIF-5 gene, a eukaryotic translation initiation factor, was found to lie in the middle of intron 1. APXL was found deleted in two patients with contiguous gene syndromes including OA1 and in one patient with isolated OA1. Mapping, expression and patient analysis data led us to consider the APXL gene a strong candidate for the OA1 gene. DNA from 57 unrelated patients with OA1 was, therefore, scanned for mutations in the coding region, using both SSCP analysis and direct sequencing. No functionally significant mutation was identified, suggesting that APXL is not directly involved in OA1. Further studies are needed to clarify the physiologic role of this highly conserved gene.",

Dysregulation of the cyclin D-CDK4/6-INK4-Rb pathway results in increased proliferation, and is frequently observed in many types of cancer. Pathway activation can occur through a variety of mechanisms, including gene amplification or rearrangement, loss of negative regulators, epigenetic alterations, and point mutations in key pathway components. Due to the importance of CDK4/6 activity in cancer cells, CDK4/6 inhibitors have emerged as promising candidates for cancer treatment. Moreover, combination of a CDK4/6 inhibitor with other targeted therapies may help overcome acquired or de novo treatment resistance. Ongoing studies include combinations of CDK4/6 inhibitors with endocrine therapy and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway inhibitors for hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancers, and with selective RAF and MEK inhibitors for tumors with alterations in the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway such as melanoma. In particular, the combination of CDK4/6 inhibitors with endocrine therapy, such as palbociclib's recent first-line approval in combination with letrozole, is expected to transform the treatment of HR+ breast cancer. Currently, three selective CDK4/6 inhibitors have been approved or are in late-stage development: palbociclib (PD-0332991), ribociclib (LEE011), and abemaciclib (LY2835219).

We found elevated MCT1 mRNA levels in fresh neuroblastoma biopsy samples that correlated positively with risk of fatal disease and amplification of the \"proto-oncogenic\" transcription factor MYCN. We further investigated MCT as a potential therapeutic target in vitro. The neuroblastoma cell lines evaluated were Sk-N-SH, CHP134, IMR32, and NGP. All lines exhibited decreased intracellular pH at low tumor-like extracellular pH. Lonidamine or exogenous lactate further lowered intracellular pH. Immediate early lowering of intracellular pH with lonidamine or lactate at extracellular pH 6.5 correlated positively with diminished cell viability within 48 h. These findings indicate that MCT1 is a potential therapeutic target and that neuroblastoma therapy may be enhanced by therapeutic strategies to inhibit or overwhelm MCT. Additional experiments indicated that the mechanism of cell death by lonidamine or exogenous lactate is similar to that obtained using alpha-cyano-4-OH-cinnamate, a well established MCT inhibitor. Because lactate production is also high in melanoma and many other tumor types, MCT inhibitors may have broad application in cancer treatment. Such treatment would have selectivity by virtue of the acidic milieu surrounding tumors, because MCT is increasingly active as extracellular pH decreases below 7.0 and lactic acid production increases.",

Using this tool, individual carbon nanotubes, gold nanorods, and melanoma cells with intrinsic melanin markers were identified in unstained (e.g. sentinel lymph nodes) and conventionally-stained tissues. In addition, we introduced a spectral burning technique for histology through selective laser bleaching areas with nondesired absorption background and nanobubble-based PT signal amplification. The obtained data demonstrated the promise of PT cytometry in the analysis of low-absorption samples and mapping of various individual nanoparticles' distribution that would be impossible with existing assays. Comparison of PT cytometry and photoacoustic (PA) cytometry previously developed by us, revealed that these methods supplement each other with a sensitivity advantage (up to 10-fold) of contactless PT technique in assessment of thin (≤100 μm) histological samples, while PA imaging provides characterization of thicker samples which, however, requires an acoustic contact with transducers.

For comparison, a pool of the same samples after general primer PCR amplification was also sequenced. This revealed 40 different HPVs, but only two HPV types were detected both with sequencing without prior PCR and with sequencing PCR amplicons, suggesting that sequencing without prior PCR gives a more unbiased representation of the HPVs present.

On the other hand, normal diploid cells respond to PALA by arresting in G1 and G2 of the cell cycle. It was previously suggested that growth control mechanisms might exist to prevent cells from entering S phase under toxic conditions and that genes involved in such mechanisms were mutated or deleted in tumor cells. Interestingly, the tumor suppressor gene p53, a putative G1 control gene, was shown to mediate PALA-induced growth arrest. However, growth arrest occurs in cells that lack wild-type p53, suggesting that other genes are involved as well. To identify these genes, we have generated whole cell hybrids between mouse melanoma and normal human fibroblast cells. At early passage, a whole cell hybrid (BHF12) responds to PALA with growth arrest, while at later passage, the same hybrid undergoes apoptosis. To determine which human chromosomes are required for the PALA-induced growth arrest phenotype, we isolated subclones of the hybrid and tested them for their PALA response. FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplification have been used to identify the human chromosome content of BHF12 and its subclones. Several human chromosomes, in addition to chromosome 17 (the location of p53), are consistently associated with the growth arrest phenotype.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Feasibility and reproducibility of the assay were evaluated according to various parameters, including drug concentration, time of in vitro culture, and type of tumor. The results indicated that the assay is highly sensitive and reproducible, and can be performed using surgical specimens in a reasonable percentage of cases, ranging from 40% (breast cancer) to 100% (ovarian cancer). Moreover, the assay provides comparable results using a wide range of tumor cells, and the presence of normal cells does not interfere with the results.

The present study demonstrates for the first time that (1) PGE(2) and 2-chloroadenosine (CADO; a stable analog of adenosine) directly inhibit the cytolytic function of human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs); (2) the combination PGE(2) and CADO have additive suppressive effects; and (3) the cooperative immunosuppressive actions of PGE(2) and CADO are mediated via EP2 receptors (EP2Rs) and A(2A) receptors (A(2A)Rs) and are due to amplification of cAMP production, activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and T cell receptor (TCR) inhibitor Csk leading to inhibition of Lck, ZAP-70 and Akt phosphorylation. (4) During ex vivo expansion, TILs undergo three stages of differentiation converting from TILs with high cytotoxic activity and relative resistance to combined EP2R/A(2A)R suppression (stage I) to TILs retaining high cytotoxicity and gaining sensitivity to combined suppression (stage II) and then to TILS that are less cytotoxic and very sensitive to combined suppression (stage III). (5) Finally, we find that pretreatment of TILs with non-inhibitory concentrations of EP2R agonists (such as PGE(2) or butaprost) or A(2A)R agonists (such as CADO or CGS21680) increases their cytotoxic activity and induces resistance to EP2R and A(2A)R inhibitory signaling (cross-resistance) due to homologous and heterologous desensitization and internalization of EP2Rs and A(2A)Rs, thus preventing their inhibitory signaling. We conclude that inducing resistance of TILs to the suppressive effects of PGE(2) and adenosine in the tumor microenvironment could represent a novel strategy for improving the efficacy of adoptive immunotherapy.",

One-hundred of these lymph nodes were cut into two equal halves which were examined using either routine histo-pathology or quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). qRT-PCR amplification of cytokeratin 19 transcripts was applied for the detection of disseminated tumor cells. Expression of MAGE-A was analyzed using one single primer pair amplifying subgroups MAGE-A1 to -A6 in one qRT-PCR reaction.;Ninety-four (94%) lymph nodes were tumor-free by histo-pathology. qRT-PCR detected disseminated tumor cells in 26 (28%) of these lymph nodes resulting in 19 (59%) patients with disseminated tumor cells. All of the remaining 6 lymph nodes that were judged by the pathologist to contain tumor cells exhibited CK19 transcripts. Fifteen (46%) lymph nodes with disseminated tumor cells contained MAGE-A transcripts resulting in 12 (37%) patients with disseminated tumor cells which expressed MAGE-A. There was no correlation between clinico-pathological parameters and the occurrence of disseminated tumor cells or their MAGE-A expression.;Since 37% of patients with operable NSCLC harbored disseminated tumor cells that expressed MAGE-A, only these patients might benefit from adjuvant immunotherapies directed against MAGE-A1 to -A6.

Consequently, they can miss up to 103-104 CTCs, resulting in the development of barely treatable metastasis. Here we analyze a new concept of in vivo CTC detection with enhanced sensitivity (up to 102-103 times) by the examination of the entire blood volume in vivo (5 L in adults). We focus on in vivo photoacoustic (PA) flow cytometry (PAFC) of CTCs using label-free or targeted detection, photoswitchable nanoparticles with ultrasharp PA resonances, magnetic trapping with fiber-magnetic-PA probes, optical clearance, real-time spectral identification, nonlinear signal amplification, and the integration with PAFC in vitro. We demonstrate PAFC's capability to detect rare leukemia, squamous carcinoma, melanoma, and bulk and stem breast CTCs and its clusters in preclinical animal models in blood, lymph, bone, and cerebrospinal fluid, as well as the release of CTCs from primary tumors triggered by palpation, biopsy or surgery, increasing the risk of metastasis. CTC lifetime as a balance between intravasation and extravasation rates was in the range of 0.5-4 h depending on a CTC metastatic potential. We introduced theranostics of CTCs as an integration of nanobubble-enhanced PA diagnosis, photothermal therapy, and feedback through CTC counting. In vivo data were verified with in vitro PAFC demonstrating a higher sensitivity (1 CTC/40 mL) and throughput (up to 10 mL/min) than conventional assays. Further developments include detection of circulating cancer-associated microparticles, and super-rsesolution PAFC beyond the diffraction and spectral limits. ",

Mutations in the core promoter region of the TERT gene, which increases promoter activity, have been reported in melanomas and a variety of human neoplasms, including gliomas. In the present study, we screened for TERT promoter mutations by direct DNA sequencing in a population-based collection of 358 glioblastomas. TERT promoter mutations (C228T, C250T) were detected in 55 % glioblastomas analysed. Of these, 73 % had a C228T mutation, and 27 % had a C250T mutation; only one glioblastoma had both C228T and C250T mutations. TERT promoter mutations were significantly more frequent in primary (IDH1 wild-type) glioblastomas (187/322; 58 %) than in secondary (IDH1 mutated) glioblastomas (10/36, 28 %; P = 0.0056). They showed significant inverse correlations with IDH1 mutations (P = 0.0056) and TP53 mutations (P = 0.043), and a significant positive correlation with EGFR amplification (P = 0.048). Glioblastoma patients with TERT mutations showed a shorter survival than those without TERT mutations in univariate analysis (median, 9.3 vs. 10.5 months; P = 0.015) and multivariate analysis after adjusting for age and gender (HR 1.38, 95 % CI 1.01-1.88, P = 0.041). However, TERT mutations had no significant impact on patients' survival in multivariate analysis after further adjusting for other genetic alterations, or when primary and secondary glioblastomas were separately analysed. These results suggest that the prognostic value of TERT mutations for poor survival is largely due to their inverse correlation with IDH1 mutations, which are a significant prognostic marker of better survival in patients with secondary glioblastomas.",

Here, FGF signaling network, cancer genetics/genomics of FGF receptors (FGFRs), and FGFR-targeted therapeutics will be reviewed. FGF signaling to RAS-MAPK branch and canonical WNT signaling cascade mutually regulate transcription programming. FGF signaling to PI3K-AKT branch and Hedgehog, Notch, TGFβ, and noncanonical WNT signaling cascades regulate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion. Gene amplification of FGFR1 occurs in lung cancer and estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, and that of FGFR2 in diffuse-type gastric cancer and triple-negative breast cancer. Chromosomal translocation of FGFR1 occurs in the 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, as with FGFR3 in multiple myeloma and peripheral T-cell lymphoma. FGFR1 and FGFR3 genes are fused to neighboring TACC1 and TACC3 genes, respectively, due to interstitial deletions in glioblastoma multiforme. Missense mutations of FGFR2 are found in endometrial uterine cancer and melanoma, and similar FGFR3 mutations in invasive bladder tumors, and FGFR4 mutations in rhabdomyosarcoma. Dovitinib, Ki23057, ponatinib, and AZD4547 are orally bioavailable FGFR inhibitors, which have demonstrated striking effects in preclinical model experiments. Dovitinib, ponatinib, and AZD4547 are currently in clinical trial as anticancer drugs. Because there are multiple mechanisms of actions for FGFR inhibitors to overcome drug resistance, FGFR-targeted therapy is a promising strategy for the treatment of refractory cancer. Whole exome/transcriptome sequencing will be introduced to the clinical laboratory as the companion diagnostic platform facilitating patient selection for FGFR-targeted therapeutics in the era of personalized medicine.

While interventional studies have demonstrated great efficacy of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents in inhibiting metastasis, no information is available on how tumor biology may be affected by congenital bleeding disorders such as hemophilia A. We therefore used a syngeneic model to study experimental metastasis and primary tumor growth in factor VIII (FVIII)-deficient mice. By conventional reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry, and one-stage clotting assays, we demonstrated constitutive expression of TF mRNA, antigen, and procoagulant activity in the murine B16F10 melanoma cell line. In hemophilic mice, B16F10 lung metastasis was significantly (P < 0.001) enhanced by a single dose of human FVIII (100 U kg(-1)), suggesting that FVIII played a critical role during the early blood-borne phase of the metastatic cascade. In contrast, lung seeding was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced by lepirudin, a direct thrombin inhibitor, suggesting that thrombin generation contributed to pulmonary metastasis even in the absence of FVIII. Consistent with this finding, intravenous injection of B16F10 cell-evoked laboratory changes of a hemolytic thrombotic microangiopathy and consumptive coagulopathy in both hemophilic and non-hemophilic mice. Subcutaneous implantation of B16F10 cells into mice with hemophilia A gave rise to primary tumors in an exponential growth pattern similar to that observed in non-hemophilic mice. Although TF expression by B16F10 cells may promote thrombin-dependent metastasis in mice with hemophilia A, amplification of coagulation by host FVIII appears to be necessary for maximum lung seeding.",

The products of the Cdc2L genes encode almost identical protein kinases, the PITSLRE kinases, which have functions that may be relevant to the regulation of transcription/splicing and apoptotic signaling. These genes are deleted/translocated in neuroblastomas with MYCN gene amplification, a subset of malignant melanomas, and in a newly delineated deletion syndrome. Here we report that the p36.3 region of human chromosome 1 consists of two identical genomic regions, each of which contain a Cdc2L gene linked to a metalloprotease (MMP) gene in a tail-to-tail configuration. This duplicated genomic region is also linked tightly to D1Z2, a genetic marker containing a highly polymorphic VNTR (variable number tandem repeat) consisting of an unusual 40-bp reiterated sequence. Thus, these genes and the polymorphic marker D1Z2 are organized as follows: telomere-D1Z2-5'-MMP22-3'-3'-Cdc2L2-5'-5'-Cdc2L1 -3'- 3'-MMP21-5'-centromere. Remarkably, the introns and exons of Cdc2L1 and Cdc2L2, as well as their flanking regions, are essentially identical. A total of 15 amino acid differences, 12 nonconservative and 3 conservative, can be found in the 773-786 amino acids specified by the various products of the Cdc2L genes. Two separate promoter/5' untranslated (UT) regions, CpG1 and CpG2, are identical to a reported previously methylated genomic CpG sequence and are used to express >20 different Cdc2L transcripts from the two genes. The expression of CpG2 transcripts from Cdc2L1 and Cdc2L2 is tissue/cell-line specific. CpG1 transcripts are expressed ubiquitously from both genes, with perhaps some bias towards the expression of CpG1 Cdc2L1 mRNAs in certain hematopoietic cells.",

We have designed a real-time quantitative PCR (QPCR) application to study homozygous deletion (HD) of CDKN2A/ARF in 186 urinary bladder cancer patients.;Real-time QPCR, based on simultaneous amplification of ARF and a reference gene, GAPDH, was developed and evaluated in three melanoma cell lines with HDs at the CDKN2A/ARF locus (IGR-1, SK-MEL-5, and WM-266-4). In addition, loss of heterozygosity was analyzed at the D9S942, D9S1748, and D12S99 markers. Mutation analysis of the CDKN2A/ARF gene was performed using single-strand conformational polymorphism and sequencing. Results from the present investigation were combined with previous p53 analysis of the same urinary bladder neoplasms.;Real-time QPCR analysis showed 26 (14%) HDs, 22 (12%) hemizygous deletions, and 3 (2%) multiple duplications. Loss of heterozygosity was determined in 30 (22%) cases at the D9S942 locus, which is located between E1alpha and E1beta of the CDKN2A/ARF gene.

To date, expression of human IL-10 has been attributed primarily to helper T lymphocytes, activated monocytes, and neoplastic B cells, and was often found to be associated with IL-6 expression. In this study we sought to determine whether non-hematopoietic human tumor cell lines produce IL-10 and, if so, what is the relationship between IL-10 and IL-6. Using ELISA, we determined IL-10 and IL-6 levels in culture supernatants of 48 cell lines established from carcinomas of the kidney, colon, breast and pancreas, malignant melanomas and neuroblastomas. IL-6 protein was secreted by 28 of the tumor cell lines; IL-10 was measurable in 15 cell lines. IL-6 secretion was maximal and most frequent in renal-cancer cell lines, while IL-10 production was found to be highest and most common among cell lines derived from colon carcinomas. IL-10 in conditioned medium of one of the colon carcinoma cell lines (CCL222) was bio-active, as demonstrated in the mouse MC/9 mast-cell-line assay and in human mixed-lymphocyte reactions. In both assays, IL-10 bio-activity was neutralized by an anti-IL-10 monoclonal antibody. Expression of IL-6 and IL-10 was confirmed by RNA analysis using message amplification by PCR and sequencing of amplified cDNA. LPS, IL-1 alpha, and TNF-alpha strongly enhanced the release of IL-6 by RCC cells, but only marginally affected IL-10 production in colon-carcinoma cells. IL-10 secretion by colon-carcinoma cells was moderately stimulated by IFN-gamma and IL-4. Dexamethasone suppressed the release of IL-6, but had no inhibitory effect on IL-10 secretion. Our results demonstrate that tumor cell lines established from certain types of human carcinomas are capable of expressing and releasing IL-6 and/or IL-10, suggesting a role of these cytokines in solid-tumor development and anti-tumor immunity.",

Several categories of cancer-associated antigens have been described as targets for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in vitro and in vivo: \"cancer-testis\" (CT) antigens expressed in different tumors and normal testis, melanocyte differentiation antigens, point mutations of normal genes, antigens that are overexpressed in malignant tissues, and viral antigens. Clinical studies using peptides derived from these antigens have been initiated to induce specific CTL responses in vivo. Immunological and clinical parameters for the assessment of peptide-specific reactions have been defined, i.e., induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), CTL, autoimmune, and tumor regression responses. Preliminary results demonstrate that tumor-associated peptides alone elicit specific DTH and CTL responses leading to tumor regression after intradermal injection. GM-CSF was proved to be effective in enhancing peptide-specific immune reactions by amplification of dermal peptide-presenting dendritic cells. Long-lasting complete tumor regressions have been observed after induction of CTLs by peptide immunization. However, in a few cases where there was disease progression after initial tumor response, loss of either the tumor antigen targeted by CTLs or of the presenting MHC class I molecule was detected as the mechanism of immune escape under immunization in vivo. Based on these observations, cytokines to enhance antigen and MHC class I expression in vivo are being evaluated to prevent immunoselection. Recently, a strategy utilizing spontaneous antibody responses to tumor-associated antigens (SEREX) has led to the identification of a new CT antigen, NY-ESO-1. In a melanoma patient with high titer antibody against NY-ESO-1, strong HLA-A2-restricted CTL reactivity against the same antigen was also found. Clinical studies involving tumor antigens that induce both antibody and CTL responses will show whether these are better candidates for immunotherapy of cancer.",

We found that 28 (36.8 %) cancer-derived cell lines exhibited a HS phenotype, 19 (25.0 %) a MS phenotype and 29 (38.1 %) a R phenotype. Allitinib showed a stronger cytotoxicity in head and neck, esophageal, melanoma and lung cancer-derived cell lines. We found that KRAS mutations were significantly associated with the R phenotype. To substantiate these results, an allitinib-sensitive lung cancer-derived cell line (H292) was transfected with plasmids carrying the two most common activating KRAS mutations (p.G12D and p.G12S). We found that both mutations reverted the allitinib-sensitive phenotype in these cells.;The current study represents the largest in vitro assessment of allitinib cytotoxicity performed to date. Through this study, we identified cancer types that could potentially benefit from this drug. Additionally, our findings suggest that prevalent KRAS mutations constitute potential predictive biomarkers for allitinib response.",

Therefore, detection of promoter hypermethylation is becoming important for diagnosis, prognosis, and aiding the design of cancer therapies. We describe a novel isothermal method for the detection of DNA hypermethylation.;Methylation-specific loop-mediated isothermal amplification (MS-LAMP) is a novel adaptation of LAMP. MS-LAMP was used for the highly specific detection of hypermethylated CpGs in the promoters of the CDKN2A [cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (melanoma, p16, inhibits CDK4)], GATA5 (GATA binding protein 5), and DAPK1 (death-associated protein kinase 1) genes. The reactions occurred under isothermal conditions with 3 primer sets specific for methylated promoters. Both turbidimetry and fluorescence were used for detection. The MS-LAMP assay was validated with bisulfite-treated plasmid and genomic DNA controls of known methylation status and was applied to detect hypermethylation in 18 clinical tumor samples. A multiplex MS-LAMP for CDKN2A, GATA5, and DAPK1 was also validated with the aid of synthetic positive and negative controls.;The MS-LAMP assay showed high specificity with plasmid and genomic DNA targets in reactions carried out in <1 h. The assay had a detection limit of approximately 30 copies of methylated target sequence and a selectivity of 0.5% methylated DNA in a mixture with unmethylated DNA. Compared with methylation-specific PCR, the MS-LAMP assay detected lower rates of methylation in lung adenocarcinoma samples. Simultaneous multiplex detection of hypermethylation in the 3 targets (CDKN2A, GATA5, and DAPK1) was readily achieved with the MS-LAMP assay in both the turbidimetric and fluorescence detection formats.;MS-LAMP provides a highly specific isothermal method for methylation detection and is well suited for multiplex approaches.",

To elucidate the role of oncogenes in UV carcinogenesis, we analyzed UV-induced murine skin tumors for mutations in codon 12, 13, or 61 of Ha-ras, Ki-ras, and N-ras oncogenes by amplification of genomic tumor DNAs by the polymerase chain reaction followed by dot-blot hybridization to synthetic oligonucleotide probes designed to detect single base-pair mutations. In addition to UV-induced C3H mouse skin tumors, we also analyzed skin tumors induced in the same strain of mice by other carcinogenic agents such as 8-methoxypsoralen + UVA, angelicin + UVA, dimethylbenz-[a]anthracene + UV + croton oil, and 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide. We found that 4 of 20 UV-induced skin tumors contained either C----A or A----G base substitutions at N-ras codon 61. In addition, 2 of 5 melanomas possessed a G----A transition in N-ras codon 13 and an A----T transversion in N-ras codon 61, respectively. Interestingly, none of the 8-methoxypsoralen + UVA- or angelicin + UVA-induced tumors we analyzed contained mutations in any of the ras genes. However, 1 of 4 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide-induced tumors exhibited a G----T transversion at Ki-ras codon 12, a potential site for formation of a 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide adduct with a guanine residue. We also found that 2 nonmelanoma tumors induced by dimethylbenz[a]anthracene + UV + croton oil contained an A----T transversion at Ha-ras codon 61 position 2, which is characteristic of most dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-induced tumors. These results suggest that UV-induced C3H mouse tumors display mutations preferentially in the N-ras oncogene. Since most N-ras mutations in UV-induced tumors occurred opposite dipyrimidine sequences (T-T or C-C), one can infer that these sites are the targets for UV-induced mutation and transformation.",

This confirms that, as in the case of chicken, TN is mainly made up of three groups of sequences with a high homology to Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) fibronectin (FN) type III repeat and fibrinogen. Furthermore, we have determined the amino-terminal sequence of the mature peptide directly on purified TN. The main differences with respect to the chicken TN molecule are that in the human there are 14 and half EGF-like repeats compared to 13 and half in the chicken and that, as previously reported, there are 15 FN-like repeats compared to 11 in the chicken. By Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification we have also studied the different splicing patterns of the TN pre-mRNA in cultured cells. The results show the presence of at least four different isoforms containing different numbers of FN-like type III repeats. Using purified human TN as immunogen, we have obtained numerous monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) to TN. By screening a human melanoma cDNA library in the expression vector lambda gt11 with these Mabs and subsequently sequencing the insert of the positive clones, we have been able to localize, within the TN molecule, the epitopes recognized by two of these Mabs: BC-4, which recognizes an epitope within the EGF-like sequence and BC-2 which recognizes an epitope within the FN like type III repeats whose expression is regulated by alternative splicing of the TN pre-mRNA. Thus, while the Mab BC-4 may be useful in studies on TN distribution (since it recognizes all different TN isoforms) BC-2 may be useful in the study of the expression of particular TN isoforms generated by the alternative splicing of the TN primary transcript.",

In this project we have elucidated the organization of the mouse ATPase II gene and identified its promoter. Located within chromosome 5, this gene spans about 224 kb and consists of 38 exons, three of which are alternatively spliced (exons 7, 8 and 16), giving rise to two transcript variants. Translation of these transcripts results in two ATPase II isoforms (1 and 2) composed of 1164 and 1149 amino acids, respectively. Using RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLM-RACE) we identified multiple transcription start sites (TSS) in messages obtained from heart, lung, liver, and spleen. The mouse ATPase II promoter is TATA-less and lacks a consensus initiator sequence. Luciferase reporter analysis of full and core promoters revealed strong activity and little cell type specificity, possibly because more flanking, regulatory sequences are required to cause such tissue specificity. In the neuronal HN2, N18, SN48 cells and the NIH3T3 fibroblast cells, but not in the B16F10 melanoma cells, the core promoter (-318/+193 with respect to the most common TSS) displayed significantly higher activity than the full promoter (-1026/+193). Serial 5' deletion of the core promoter revealed significant cell type-specific activity of the fragments, suggesting differential expression and use of transcription factors in the five cell lines tested. Additionally distribution of the TSS was organ specific. Such observations suggest tissue-specific differences in transcription initiation complex assembly and regulation of ATPase II gene expression. Information presented here form the groundwork for further studies on the expression of this gene in apoptotic cells.",

To correctly classify a tumour process, it is essential not only to define its histological typology and identify its biological character but, at the same time, using immunohistochemistry and diagnostic molecular pathology, to evaluate prognostic and predictive indicators. As regards the prognostic indicators, it is mainly grading and staging as part of the TNM system, the sentinel lymph node assessment, if it is assessed, and other nodes extracted in this context. Histological specimens of invasive carcinomas and skin melanomas are assessed with respect to the depth of the invasion. Endocrine oestrogen and progesterone receptors are assessed in endocrine-dependent breast carcinomas. Predictive pathology uses biomarkers; biomarkers confirm the presence of target molecules following their reaction with the administered small molecule-like drugs, usually protein kinases or antibodies. HER2 gene amplification is estimated using the FISH method and predicts effectiveness of breast cancer therapies. In patients with a colon carcinoma, HER1 oncogene is identified immunohistochemically and the presence of a mutated K-ras is subsequently tested using the RT-PCR technique. CD 117 (c-kit) expression is determined in gastrointestinal stromal tumour and CD 20, 33 and 52 in malignant lymphomas and leukaemias. The most difficult task for a pathologist is defining the primary focus of the tumour in cases where only a fraction of a metastasis is available for examination. Nevertheless, at present, it is feasible to track the tumour differentiation down and, using an antibody battery, particularly against specific cytokeratines and vimentine and including organ-specific markers, to identify the primary source or at least to establish an assumption about the most likely organ affected by the tumour process.",

        "Doc_abstract":"There are major differences between tumors in children and adults, viz. the incidence of tumor types, the predisposition of certain organs and tissues (e.g. sympathetic nervous tissue, kidney, and soft tissues) to develop tumors, problems related to tumor classification, and the biologic behavior of childhood malignancies, which are usually characterized by high rates of proliferation activity. A large number of new entities, especially in soft tissue tumors, have been published over the past years, including nodular mesothelial hyperplasia, which is a tumor-like lesion derived from peritoneal macrophages; infantile myofibromatosis, which can mimic leiomyosarcoma; intermediate grade fibrohistiocytic tumors, like dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans-related giant-cell fibroblastoma, plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumor and angiomatoid malignant fibrous histiocytoma displaying evidence of myogeneous differentiation; finally, the high-grade intraabdominal desmoplastic small cell tumor. With modern methods we can gain better insights into the biology of tumors. For example, tumors of the Ewing's sarcoma family have in common a characteristic t(11; 22) chromosomal translocation, the Ewing's sarcoma (EWS) (22q12) gene rearrangement, and the MIC2 gene. The EWS gene rearrangement is not restricted to tumors of the Ewing's sarcoma family (classic Ewing's sarcoma and malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumor), however, but occurs in malignant melanoma of the soft tissue and in intraabdominal desmoplastic small cell tumor. Rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS) can be divided into two basic types with different prognoses: embryonal RMS, including botryoid and spindle-cell variants, and alveolar RMS, including the solid variant. The prognosis of alveolar RMS is poorer than that of classic embryonal RMS, mainly due to early tumor dissemination in alveolar RMS. The prognosis of neuroblastoma is mainly based on chromosomal and molecular biologic findings. Structural chromosome 1 abnormalities, double minute chromosomes, homogeneously staining regions, N-myc amplifications, and DNA diploidy are indications for an unfavorable outcome. Despite progress in childhood solid tumor pathology, many questions remain open, including those relating to basic chromosomal defects in germ cell tumors and the obscure nature of tumor heterogeneity.",

Several categories of cancer-associated antigens have been described as targets for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in vitro and in vivo: (1) 'Cancer-Testis' (CT) antigens expressed in different tumors and normal testis, (2) melanocyte differentiation antigens, (3) point mutations of normal genes, (4) antigens that are overexpressed in malignant tissues, and (5) viral antigens. Clinical studies with peptides derived from these antigens have been initiated to induce specific CTL responses in vivo. Immunological and clinical parameters for the assessment of peptide-specific reactions have been defined, i.e. induction of DTH-, CTL-, autoimmune-, and tumor-regression responses. Preliminary results demonstrate that tumor-associated peptides alone elicit specific DTH- and CTL-responses leading to tumor regression after intradermal injection. GM-CSF was proven effective to enhance peptide-specific immune reactions by amplification of dermal peptide-presenting dendritic cells. Long lasting complete tumor regressions have been observed after induction of CTL by peptide immunization. Based on these results, active immunotherapy with tumor-associated antigens may be a promising approach for patients with minimal residual disease, who are at high risk for tumor recurrence. However, in single cases with disease progression after an initial tumor response either a loss of the respective tumor antigen targeted by CTL or of the presenting MHC class I molecule was detected as mechanisms of immune escape under immunization in vivo. Based on these observations, cytokines to enhance antigen- and MHC-class I expression in vivo are being evaluated to prevent immunoselection. Recently, a strategy utilizing spontaneous antibody responses to tumor-associated antigens (SEREX) has led to the identification of a new CT antigen, NY-ESO-1. In a melanoma patient with high titer antibody against NY-ESO-1 also a strong HLA-A2 restricted CTL reactivity against the same antigen was found. Clinical studies involving tumor antigens that induce both antibody- and CTL-responses will show whether these are better candidates for immunotherapy of cancer.",

We investigated the mechanisms for this differential type I IFN production in cells infected with representative MV strains. The overexpression of the wild-type V protein suppressed melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5)-induced IFN-β promoter activity, while this was not seen in A549 cells expressing CD150 transfected with the V protein of the vaccine strain. The V proteins of the wild-type also suppressed poly I:C-induced IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) dimerization. The V proteins of the wild-type and vaccine strain did not affect retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I)- or toll-IL-1R homology domain-containing adaptor molecule 1 (TICAM-1)-induced IFN-β promoter activation. We identified an amino acid substitution of the cysteine residue at position 272 (which is conserved among paramyxoviruses) to an arginine residue in the V protein of the vaccine strain. Only the V protein possessing the 272C residue binds to MDA5. The mutation introduced into the wild-type V protein (C272R) was unable to suppress MDA5-induced IRF-3 nuclear translocation and IFN-β promoter activation as seen in the V proteins of the vaccine strain, whereas the mutation introduced in the vaccine strain V protein (R272C) was able to inhibit MDA5-induced IRF-3 and IFN-β promoter activation. The other 6 residues of the vaccine strain V sequence inconsistent with the authentic sequence of the wild-type V protein barely affected the IRF-3 nuclear translocation. These data suggested that the structural difference of laboratory-adapted [corrected] MV V protein hampers MDA5 blockade and acts as a nidus for the spread/amplification of type I IFN induction. Ultimately, measles vaccine strains have two modes of IFN-β-induction for their attenuation: V protein mutation and production of defective interference (DI) RNA.",

A key contribution in this regard was the introduction of tumor-selective viral replication for amplification of the initial inoculum. Specifically, following cellular infection, the virus replicates selectively in the infected tumor cells and kills the cells by cytolysis. Next, the progeny virions infect surrounding target cells, replicate and eradicate the infected tumor cells, leaving normal cells unaffected. However, to date there have been two limitations to clinical application of these CRAd agents; i.e., both infectivity and tumor specificity are poor. Survivin protein is a novel member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) protein family, which plays an important role in the survival of cancer cells and progression of malignancies. Previous data have shown the survivin promoter has high activities in multiple cancer cells with a low activity in mouse liver. In this study, we propose an improved CRAd agent to circumvent the obstacles. We constructed a novel CRAd agent, CRAd-Survivin-RGD, which contains both the survivin promoter (either the short version, S-S, or the long version, S-L) to selectively drive E1 gene expression in tumor cells and a capsid modification and RGD4C to specifically enhance the tumor infectivity of CRAd agents. Both CRAd agents (S-S and S-L) showed high replication rates in the breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-361, and low promoter activity in both normal mouse and human liver, thus signifying the CRAd agents have the phenotype of 'tumor on/liver off'. In cytocidal experiments, the CRAd agents demonstrated a high cytocidal effect on multiple cancer cell lines, including the breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231; the glioma cell line, D65, the melanoma cell line, MEL-28; and mesothelioma, Meso2374. The results also showed the tumor growth was dramatically inhibited by intertumoral administration of the CRAd agents in a breast cancer (MDA-MB-361) xenograft animal model. These data clearly demonstrate that CRAd-Survivin-RGD is a potential novel therapeutic agent for treatment in many, but not all, human cancers.",

Survivin, another protein involved in angiogenesis, is strongly expressed in most human cancers, where it promotes tumor survival by reducing apoptosis as well as favoring endothelial cell proliferation and migration. The mechanisms by which cancer cells induce VEGF expression and angiogenesis upon survivin up-regulation remain to be fully established. Since the PI3K/Akt signalling and β-catenin-Tcf/Lef dependent transcription have been implicated in the expression of many cancer-related genes, including survivin and VEGF, we evaluated whether survivin may favor VEGF expression, release from tumor cells and induction of angiogenesis in a PI3K/Akt-β-catenin-Tcf/Lef-dependent manner. Here, we provide evidence linking survivin expression in tumor cells to increased β-catenin protein levels, β-catenin-Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity and expression of several target genes of this pathway, including survivin and VEGF, which accumulates in the culture medium. Alternatively, survivin downregulation reduced β-catenin protein levels and β-catenin-Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity. Also, using inhibitors of PI3K and the expression of dominant negative Akt, we show that survivin acts upstream in an amplification loop to promote VEGF expression. Moreover, survivin knock-down in B16F10 murine melanoma cells diminished the number of blood vessels and reduced VEGF expression in tumors formed in C57BL/6 mice. Finally, in the chick chorioallantoid membrane assay, survivin expression in tumor cells enhanced VEGF liberation and blood vessel formation. Importantly, the presence of neutralizing anti-VEGF antibodies precluded survivin-enhanced angiogenesis in this assay. These findings provide evidence for the existance of a posititve feedback loop connecting survivin expression in tumor cells to PI3K/Akt enhanced β-catenin-Tcf/Lef-dependent transcription followed by secretion of VEGF and angiogenesis.

        "Doc_abstract":"Cell-based therapy using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) seems promising to obtain regeneration of dental tissues. A comparison of tissue sources, including periodontal ligament (PDL) versus pulp (P), could provide critical information to select an appropriate MSC population for designing predictable regenerative therapies. The purpose of this study is to compare the proliferation and stemness and the MSC-specific and mineralized tissue-specific gene expression of P-MSCs and PDL-MSCs.;MSCs were obtained from PDL and P tissue of premolars (n = 3) extracted for orthodontic reasons. MSC proliferation was evaluated using a real-time cell analyzer for 160 hours. Telomerase activity was evaluated by a telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Total RNA was isolated from the MSCs on day 3. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array was used to compare the expression of MSC-specific genes. The expression of mineralized tissue-associated genes, including Type I collagen (COL I), runt-related transcription factor 2 (RunX2), bone sialoprotein (BSP), and osteocalcin (OCN) messenger RNA (mRNA), was evaluated using quantitative real-time PCR.;Higher proliferation potential and telomerase activity were observed in the P-MSCs compared to PDL-MSCs of premolar teeth. Fourteen of 84 genes related to MSCs were expressed differently in the PDL-MSCs versus the P-MSCs. The expressions of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) and BMP6; sex-determining region Y-box 9 (SOX9); integrin, alpha 6 (ITGA6); melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM); phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis, class S (PIGS); prominin 1 (PROM1); ribosomal protein L13A (RPL13A); and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) were higher in the P-MSCs compared to the PDL-MSCs, and higher expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), interleukin (IL)-6, insulin (INS), alanyl (membrane) aminopeptidase (ANPEP), and IL-10 were observed in the PDL-MSCs. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the expression of mineralized tissue-associated genes, including BSP and RunX2, between the P-MSCs and the PDL-MSCs. Higher expression of COL I and lower expression of OCN mRNA transcripts were noted in the PDL-MSCs compared to the P-MSCs.;The results of this study suggest that MSCs isolated from P and PDL tissues show different cellular behavior. To increase the predictability of MSC-based regenerative treatment, differences in dental tissue-derived MSCs and favorable aspects of cell sources should be further clarified.",
