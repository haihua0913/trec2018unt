Recently, a single adnexal adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) was reported to demonstrate KIT expression, however, examination of KIT expression or c-kit mutation in ACC of salivary glands has not been performed. We examined archival tissue samples from 30 ACC of major and minor salivary glands for KIT protein expression by immunohistochemistry with a polyclonal antibody and c-kit gene mutation by polymerase chain reaction amplification and DNA sequencing. KIT protein expression was noted in 90% of ACCs. An association between the presence of at least 50% KIT positive neoplastic cells and Grade 3 ACC or a solid growth pattern was observed (P < .05). KIT expression in normal or nonneoplastic salivary gland tissue was absent. No c-kit juxtamembrane domain (exon 11) or phosphotransferase domain (exon 17) mutations were found in any of the tumors examined.

Ultrasonography and mammography showed a 12-mm, well-defined, lobulated mass in the retroareolar region of the right breast. The lump was diagnosed as ACC on the basis of immunohistochemical staining results for c-kit (CD117), muscle-specific actin, p63, estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptor using a fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) specimen. This diagnosis was subsequently confirmed by excision biopsy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of ACC of the breast to date to be diagnosed on the basis of immunohistochemical staining of an FNAC cell block material.

        "Doc_abstract":"Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is an aggressive malignant neoplasm of the salivary glands in which c-Kit is overexpressed and activated, although the mechanism for this is as yet unclear. We analyzed 27 sporadic ACC tumor specimens to examine the biologic and clinical significance of c-Kit activation. Mutational analysis revealed expression of wild-type c-Kit in all, eliminating gene mutation as a cause of activation. Because stem cell factor (SCF) is c-Kit's sole ligand, we analyzed its expression in the tumor cells and their environment. Immunohistochemistry revealed its presence in c-Kit-positive tumor cells, suggesting an activation of autocrine signaling. We observed a significant induction of ERK1/2 in the cells. SCF staining was also found in other types of non-cancerous cells adjacent to tumors within salivary glands, including stromal fibroblasts, neutrophils, peripheral nerve, skeletal muscle, vascular endothelial cells, mucous acinar cells, and intercalated ducts. Quantitative PCR showed that the top quartile of c-Kit mRNA expression distinguished ACCs from normal salivary tissues and was cross-correlated with short-term poor prognosis. Expression levels of SCF and c-Kit were highly correlated in the cases with perineural invasion. These observations suggest that c-Kit is potentially activated by receptor dimerization upon stimulation by SCF in ACC, and that the highest quartile of c-Kit mRNA expression could be a predictor of poor prognosis. Our findings may support an avenue for c-Kit-targeted therapy to improve disease control in ACC patients harboring the top quartile of c-Kit mRNA expression. ",

Adenoid cystic carcinoma may be difficult to differentiate from infiltrating duct carcinomas, and in particular from tubular and cribriform carcinomas, especially in core or vacuum-assisted biopsies. We evaluated the prevalence of c-kit, p63, and e-cadherin immunoreactivity in a series of 20 adenoid cystic carcinomas, comparing the results with those obtained in a series of infiltrating tubular carcinomas and infiltrating cribriform carcinomas. The hormone receptor status, proliferation labeling index, and HER/2 immunoreactivity had been previously investigated in all the cases. Three (15%) adenoid cystic carcinomas and all infiltrating tubular and cribriform carcinomas showed estrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor immunoreactivity (P < 0.00001 for estrogen and P = 0.00002 for progesterone receptors). Adenoid cystic carcinomas consistently lacked any immunoreactivity for HER/2, whereas three (15%) infiltrating and cribriform carcinomas showed weak and incomplete membrane staining (P = 0.23077). Membranous immunoreactivity for c-kit was found in all except one (predominantly basaloid) adenoid cystic carcinomas (95%), and in none of the infiltrating tubular and cribriform carcinomas (P < 0.00001). Nuclear immunoreactivity for p63 was found in all except three (predominantly basaloid) adenoid cystic carcinomas (85%) and in none of the infiltrating tubular and cribriform carcinomas (P < 0.00001). All infiltrating tubular and cribriform carcinomas and 18/20 (90%) adenoid cystic carcinomas showed immunoreactivity for e-cadherin (P = 0.48718). In summary, adenoid cystic carcinomas showed the following phenotype: estrogen receptor-/progesterone receptor-/c-kit+/p63+ (13 cases, 65%), estrogen receptor-/progesterone receptor/c-kit+/p63- (three cases, 15%), estrogen receptor-/progesterone receptor-/c-kit-/p63+ (one case, 5%), estrogen receptor+/progesterone receptor+/c-kit+/p63+ (two cases, 10%), and estrogen receptor+/progesterone receptor-/c-kit+/p63+ (one case). By contrast, all the infiltrating tubular and cribriform carcinomas showed the estrogen receptor+/progesterone receptor+/c-kit-/p63- phenotype.

Expression of c-kit, a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase, has recently been reported to be expressed in ACC but not PLGA. Expression of galectin-3, a nonintegrin beta-galactosidase-binding lectin, has been reported to be significant in PLGA and decreased in ACC.Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from 9 ACC and 14 PLGA were immunostained for c-kit and galectin-3. Cases were scored as 1+ (5-25% positive), 2+ (26-50% positive), or 3+ (>50% positive). C-kit was expressed by 100% of ACC (3+: 7 cases; 2+: 1 case; 1+: 1 case) and by 57% of PLGA (2+: 2 cases; 1+: 6 cases). In all but one ACC, c-kit expression was confined to the inner cell layer. C-kit expression was also noted in the intercalated duct epithelium of the salivary glands and the acinar cells of the lacrimal gland. Galectin-3 was expressed in 8 of 9 cases of ACC and 14 of 14 cases of PLGA. The results of this, the first study to compare c-kit and galectin-3 expression in ACC and PLGA, suggest that c-kit expression characterizes ACC, but not PLGA. Galectin-3 immunohistochemistry does not have a role in the differentiation of ACC and PLGA. C-kit immunostaining may be a valuable adjunctive tool for this differential diagnosis, particularly in the setting of a limited biopsy.

Solid-type ACC cells were immunoreactive for CD117 (c-kit), but lower-grade ACC and HGA cells were negative.

Results revealed positive cytoplasmic reactivity for c-kit in 100% of ACC cases and only in 25% of PLGA. On the other hand, galectin-3 expression was observed in 100% of both ACC and PLGA cases. Moreover, solid variant of ACC showed overexpression of both proteins than cribriform and tubular subtypes. Significant positive correlation between the two studied proteins in ACC and PLGA was also observed (p < 0.05). Upon these results, over expression of c-kit and galectin-3 in ACC cases supports the concept of solid variant as a high-grade tumor. Moreover, c-kit may be used as a helpful marker to distinguish ACC from PLGA in cases where the diagnosis can be challenging. ",

We hypothesize that the dual myoepithelial/ epithelial composition of ACCs underlie their biological heterogeneity and may impact on their therapeutic management. A recurrent reciprocal translocation of t(6;9)(q22-23; p23-24) resulting in fusion gene partners comprising MYB gene the transcription factor NFIB has been reported in ACC of breast, salivary, lachrymal and ceruminal glands. In fusion positive and a subset of fusion negative ACCs, high expression of the transcript Myb was found. However, the role of Myb protein expression and the potential effect on the downstream targets have not been investigated. To investigate the biological and prognostic significance of use of elevated levels of Myb and its downstream target genes (c-kit, cox-2, bcl-2), we analyzed, by immunohistochemistry, the protein expression of these genes in 156 ACCs. We have found that 55% of ACCs have increased Myb expression mainly confined to myoepithelial cells. We validated Myb expression on a large cohort of ACCs (156 patients). Although no significant effects of the individual Myb and downstream targets c-kit, bcl-2 and cox-2 on survival was noticed, the combinations survival curve for Myb+/c-kit+/cox-2+ showed better survival than combination Myb-/c-kit+/cox-2+.

This study reports an opposite finding: we have found strong evidence that the MAPK pathway is inhibited in a subset of adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACCs) of the salivary glands. ACC tumors consistently overexpress the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) c-Kit, which has been considered a therapeutic target. We performed mutational analysis of the c-Kit gene (KIT in 17 cases of ACC and found that 2 cases of ACC had distinct missense mutations in KIT at both the genomic DNA and messenger RNA levels. These mutations caused G664R and R796G amino acid substitutions in the kinase domains. Surprisingly, the mutations were functionally inactive in cultured cells. We observed a significant reduction of MAPK (ERK1/2) activity in tumor cells, as assessed by immunohistochemistry. We performed further mutational analysis of the downstream effectors in the c-Kit pathway in the genes HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, and PTEN. This analysis revealed that two ACC tumors without KIT mutations had missense mutations in either KRAS or BRAF, causing S17N K-Ras and V590I B-Raf mutants, respectively. Our functional analysis showed that proteins with these mutations were also inactive in cultured cells. This is the first time that MAPK activity from the RTK signaling has been shown to be inhibited by gene mutations during tumor development. Because ACC seems to proliferate despite inactivation of the c-Kit signaling pathway, we suggest that selective inhibition of c-Kit is probably not a suitable treatment strategy for ACC.",

Archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of 40 benign and 57 malignant salivary gland tumours were retrieved and retrospectively studied immunohistochemically using a polyclonal C-KIT antibody in an Envision/HRP technique. In addition five samples of chronic submandibular sialadenitis, five normal minor salivary glands and parotid or submandibular gland tissue adjacent to benign tumour were also studied. C-KIT expression was observed in cases of adenoid cystic, acinic cell polymorphous low grade, epithelial-myoepithelial, carcinosarcoma and basal cell adenocarcinomas, as in luminal cells of pleomorphic adenomas, in serous acinar and only in intercalated and a small number of striated ductal cells of inflammatory salivary gland tissue, whereas normal salivary lobules were generally negative except a weak positivity of intercalated cells. Contrary to other reports, this study suggests that, C-KIT protein does not appear to be an exclusively specific marker for benign or malignant salivary gland neoplasms, but may be useful in differential diagnosis of adenoid cystic carcinoma from polymorphous low grade adenocarcinoma.

The diagnosis may be even more challenging in needle core biopsies. Immunohistochemical expression of p63 and c-kit distinguishes adenoid cystic carcinoma from invasive cribriform carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ. A formal comparison of the immunophenotype of adenoid cystic carcinoma to collagenous spherulosis has not been reported. Of concern is the overlap in myoepithelial markers between these two entities. Both may express S100, smooth muscle actin, and p63. This overlap may cause diagnostic confusion yet is under-emphasized in the literature. The expression profile of newer myoepithelial markers has not been studied in this setting. We evaluated smooth muscle actin, p63, calponin, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, as well as c-kit, in nine cases of cribriform pattern adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast in comparison to 12 cases of collagenous spherulosis. Both entities strongly expressed p63 and smooth muscle actin; in adenoid cystic carcinoma, the basaloid myoepithelial-like tumor cells expressed these markers, but the ductular epithelial cells did not. Neither calponin nor smooth muscle myosin heavy chain was expressed in adenoid cystic carcinoma but both were strongly expressed in collagenous spherulosis. Whereas the ductular epithelial cells of adenoid cystic carcinoma were positive for c-kit in all cases, collagenous spherulosis was negative for c-kit. Positive p63 expression by a cribriform breast lesion is not sufficiently specific to confirm a diagnosis of adenoid cystic carcinoma. A broader panel that includes calponin or smooth muscle myosin heavy chain and c-kit is required to exclude collagenous spherulosis in settings in which the distinctive morphologic features that separate these entities are not conspicuously present. Reliance on p63 or smooth muscle actin alone poses a potential diagnostic pitfall in evaluating cribriform breast lesions.",

The antigen expression intensity was calculated as relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) and for direct quantitative analysis the QuantiBRITE test (Becton Dickinson) was applied. Antibody bounding capacity (ABC) was calculated using QuantiCALC software. CD117 antigen was present in 49/158 MM, 5/12 PCL and 5/7 MGUS patients. The RFI values ranged from 0.2 to 20.2 in particular MM patients (mean: 11.0+/-5.3; median 11.5) while the number of CD117 binding sites (ABC) on MM plasma cells ranged from 637 to 6217 (mean: 3029+/-1568; median 2946) (r=0.8328). In responsive to chemotherapy c-kit positive MM patients the percentage of CD117+ plasma cells in the bone marrow decreased significantly while in c-kit negative MM patients the percentage of CD117+ cells in bone marrow did not change and remained in the normal limits. When comparing the clinical and biological disease characteristics (monoclonal protein isotype, albumin, beta2-microglobulin, lactate dehydrogenase, stage of disease, response to chemotherapy, survival time) of c-kit positive and c-kit negative cases, no significant differences were found. In CD117 positive PCL cases expression of CD117 was detected in bone marrow plasma cells as well as in peripheral blood plasma cells. Normal plasma cells and those in IgM lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma did not show reactivity for the CD117 antigen. We conclude that it may be rationale to consider usefulness of therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the management of c-kit positive plasma cell proliferations. In one third of MM and PCL patients c-kit antigen could be considered as a \"tumor associated marker\" and together with CD38 and CD138 it may be of value for the identification of the malignant clone in minimal residual disease as it was first suggested by Spanish authors.",

Dysregulated expression of SCFR may contribute to neoplastic transformation. We investigated expression of SCFR on malignant canine mast cells obtained directly from spontaneous canine mast cell neoplasms, in an attempt to determine whether these undifferentiated cells maintained expression of this growth-promoting cytokine receptor. Malignant mast cells (histological grade 2) from skin tumours or lymph node metastases were collected from canine patients, and SCFRs were detected by flow cytometric analysis of these cells. All of the tumours bound mouse and canine recombinant stem cell factor (SCF), indicating that the cells not only expressed SCFRs, but that the receptors possessed the functional property of ligand binding. Immunoglobulin Fc receptors for canine IgE were identified on these cells by flow cytometry, a further indication that the cells analysed were mast cells and retained some differentiated features. Immunohistochemical analysis of formalin-fixed, paraffin wax-embedded mast cell tumour biopsies confirmed expression of SCFRs by malignant cells from each tumour. The relative binding of SCF to suspensions of tumour cells, as assessed by flow cytometry, correlated with the intensity of immunolabelling for SCFR in sections of the same tumours, suggesting variability in SCFR expression between tumours. Agarose gel electrophoresis of the products of SCFR reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction derived from each tumour had the molecular weight predicted for canine SCFR cDNA on the basis of the mouse and human counterparts. This further confirmed SCFR expression by malignant canine mast cells. Taken together, these results show that a membrane receptor capable of triggering cell growth is expressed by malignant canine mast cells, suggesting a role for this receptor in the aetiology of canine mast cell cancer. This relatively common malignancy of the dog would seem to present an opportunity for the investigation of the potential role of the SCF/SCFR pathway in the development of spontaneous malignancies of mast cells.",

Ninety-six fibroepithelial tumors of the breast, including 14 fibroadenomas (FAs), 12 juvenile FAs and 70 PTs, were classified according to stromal cellularity, atypia, epithelial hyperplasia, mitosis and borders into 45 benign (PTB), 17 borderline (PTBL) and 8 malignant (PTM) tumors.

Overall, 38 cases (39.6%) showed positive CD117 in the epithelial component, including 20 FAs (10 regular, 10 juvenile) and 18 PTs (11 PTBs and 8 PTBLs). Other cases, including all PTMs, 6 FAs (4 regular, 2 juvenile), 34 PTBs and 10 PTBLs, showed no positivity in the epithelial component.

The recent observations that c-kit protooncogene, a tyrosine kinase, is overexpressed in a subset of small cell lung cancer and that selective kinase inhibitors block the in vitro growth of small cell lung cancer cell lines prompted us to investigate the expression and mutation status of the c-kit gene in colorectal neuroendocrine carcinomas. Sixty-six cases of primary colorectal neuroendocrine carcinoma were collected from 13 institutions, including 36 small cell carcinomas and 30 moderately differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas. Immunohistochemical studies using a polyclonal antibody against c-kit protein (CD117) demonstrated a strong and diffuse cytoplasmic staining in 15 cases (23%), which were relatively equally distributed in the small cell and moderately differentiated subgroups. As controls, 25 conventional colorectal adenocarcinomas, 26 colorectal adenomas and 19 colorectal carcinoid tumors were all negative, whereas 15 gastrointestinal stromal tumors were all positive, for kit expression. In contrast to gastrointestinal stromal tumors, kit-overexpressing neuroendocrine carcinomas showed no mutations in the juxtamembrane domain (exon 11) of the c-kit gene as determined by mutational analysis. Kaplan-Meier analysis with the log-rank test revealed that the patients with kit-positive tumors did not differ significantly in survival from those with kit-negative tumors (P = 0.77). These results indicate that c-kit overexpression observed in a subset of colorectal neuroendocrine carcinomas may not be mediated via activating mutations, and does not appear to be an initiating event during tumorigenesis because of lack of c-kit expression in other types of colorectal epithelial neoplasms. More importantly, our observations may have potential therapeutic implications since specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown promise in the management of patients with kit-expressing malignancies.",

We examined the expression of c-kit in 30 cases of ovarian dysgerminomas using immunohistohemical staining with a polyclonal anti-CD117 antibody. Staining was graded in a semiquantitative manner as follows: negative (no staining), 1+(1-10% staining), 2+(10-29% staining), 3+(30-50% staining), or 4+ (>50% staining).

In conclusion, CD117 immunoreactivity was detected in 87% of ovarian dysgerminomas, a finding that correlates with previously reported frequencies of CD117 expression in seminomas (78-100%).

The aim of this study was to characterize the repertoire of somatic genetic events affecting known cancer genes in AdCCs.;DNA was extracted from 13 microdissected breast AdCCs, and subjected to a mutation survey using the Sequenom OncoCarta Panel v1.0. Genes found to be mutated in any of the breast AdCCs and genes related to the same canonical molecular pathways, as well as KIT, a proto-oncogene whose protein product is expressed in AdCCs, were sequenced in an additional 68 AdCCs from various anatomical sites by Sanger sequencing. Using the Sequenom MassARRAY platform and Sanger sequencing, mutations in BRAF and HRAS were identified in three and one cases, respectively (breast, and head and neck). KIT, which has previously been reported to be mutated in AdCCs, was also investigated, but no mutations were identified.;Our results demonstrate that mutations in genes pertaining to the canonical RAS pathway are found in a minority of AdCCs, and that activating KIT mutations are either absent or remarkably rare in these cancers, and unlikely to constitute a driver and therapeutic target for patients with AdCC.",

Imatinib mesylate offers an effective therapeutic option in patients with various types of malignancies by inhibiting tyrosine kinases such as c-kit. In this study we investigated c-kit expression in anaplastic and poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma compared to differentiated carcinoma and adenoma and the presence of c-kit mutations. In total, 224 thyroid tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Mutation analysis of exon 9, 11, 13, and 17 of the c-kit gene was performed in anaplastic and poorly differentiated carcinoma. c-Kit expression was negative in all anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, while c-kit expression of poorly differentiated carcinoma showed a high variability with a more intense staining in tumors showing obvious differentiated malignant follicular tumor areas. Differentiated carcinoma showed a slight, but not significantly stronger c-kit expression than poorly differentiated carcinoma. All tumors revealed wild type sequences of c-kit gene in exons 9, 11, 13, and 17. The low or lacking c-kit expression in undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma together with the lack of mutations argue against a crucial role of c-kit in thyroid carcinoma cell proliferation.

Over 90% of ACC tumors are c-kit-positive, and these primary cultures proved to be of short-term usefulness in assessing chemosensitivity. Interaction was determined over a wide range of drug combinations using a statistical three-dimensional analysis model. Both ACC short-term cultures and HNSCC cell lines were demonstrated to have a response ranging from additive to synergistic when imatinib and cisplatin were combined. The interaction of imatinib on cisplatin-induced DNA cross-linking was further investigated using the comet-X assay. In contrast, significant antagonism was observed when imatinib and gemcitabine were combined. Since gemcitabine is activated by deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), the effect of imatinib on this enzyme was investigated. A dose-dependent inhibition of dCK was observed, highlighting this kinase as a possible additional secondary molecular target for imatinib.

While benign phyllodes tumors may recur, borderline phyllodes tumors show higher propensity to recur locally and rarely metastasize, and malignant phyllodes tumors show even higher chances of local recurrences or distant metastases. c-kit is a proto-oncogene that encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor (CD117) and is a marker for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). With the advent of therapeutic agent targeted at this receptor for GIST, we investigated 179 phyllodes tumors (101 benign, 50 borderline, 28 malignant) for c-kit expression using immunohistochemistry. The staining was compared to the degree of malignancy, and to the degree of stromal cellularity, mitotic activity, nuclear pleomorphism and stromal overgrowth. The overall positive rate for c-kit was 29% (52/179) and 17% (17/101), 24% (12/50) and 46% (13/28), respectively, for benign, borderline malignant and frank malignant phyllodes and the differences between all categories were significant (chi2=13.844, P=0.001). In mammary phyllodes tumors, there was increasing c-kit expression with increasing degree of malignancy, up to 46% in malignant cases.

In this study, the frequency of c-kit exon 11 mutations has been determined in a series of 18 gut stromal tumours.;Immunophenotype was assessed by immunoperoxidase stains for smooth muscle actin, desmin, S100, CD34 and CD117, and each tumour classified as being of low, uncertain (intermediate) or high malignant potential based on standard histological criteria. DNA from each tumour was extracted from fresh (n = 5) or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (n= 13) tissues using the direct lysis method. Exon 11 was amplified by PCR and sequencing of both sense and antisense strands was performed on two occasions using an ABI 377 sequencer.;Mutations in exon 11 were detected in three of 14 confirmed GISTs, two being point mutations at codon 560 and one a 3-bp deletion resulting in the in-frame deletion of glutamine at codon 561. All three tumours were of high or intermediate malignant potential histologically. Three other 'high risk' primary GISTs and a metastatic GIST deposit were negative for exon 11 mutations.;Data on this relatively small cohort of Australian patients indicate that c-kit exon 11 mutation analysis does not correlate well with histological assessment of malignant potential, and cannot be regarded as a reliable objective marker for poor prognosis in GISTs.",

Membrane staining was identified in the epithelium of 82% of cases, representing all diagnostic categories in the study. Membrane and cytoplasmic staining was detected in scant cells in the stroma in 74% of the cases in the study, again, across all diagnostic entities. However, when toluidine blue and tryptase staining was performed, the staining pattern matched that of c-kit in the number of cells and their distribution, thereby confirming the presence of mast cells and excluding any appreciable level of true stromal c-kit staining. One borderline and one malignant phyllodes tumor showed a diffuse weak stromal signal, which could not be accounted for by toluidine blue and tryptase. These cases were further tested for the presence of known activating mutations of c-kit and PDGFR-alpha, and yielded negative results. Our findings indicate that c-kit is an unlikely player in the pathogenesis of fibroepithelial lesions of the breast.

This molecular pathway seems somewhat implicated in promoting the neoplastic growth of small cell lung carcinoma. The current pharmacological availability of its selective inhibitor, together with the promising clinical results in the management of CD117-positive neoplasms such as advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors, aroused great interest among oncologists in also adopting this therapeutic strategy in other CD117-positive tumors. We evaluated a series of 27 small cell lung carcinomas, comparing the expression of CD117 of the primary naïve tumor (before first-line chemotherapy) with the expression of the same neoplasm after postchemotherapy relapse. All the patients underwent similar chemotherapeutic regimens (cisplatin/carboplatin plus etoposide). At diagnosis, 21 of 27 cases (78%) showed strong immunoreactivity for CD117. Among these 21 originally positive tumors, CD117 remained overexpressed in 10 after relapse (48%), whereas the other 11 cases became negative. No originally CD117-negative small cell carcinomas displayed immunoreactivity after chemotherapy. CD117 expression was not statistically correlated with overall survival, occurrence of chemoresistance, or clinical response to chemotherapy. We also evaluated CD117 expression in a series of 46 surgically resected non-small cell lung carcinomas (8 squamous cell carcinomas, 10 adenocarcinomas, 5 pleomorphic carcinomas, 10 typical and 3 atypical carcinoids, and 10 large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas). Apart from small cell carcinomas, CD117 overexpression was observed in 6 of 10 large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas, whereas all the other histotypes resulted unstained. We speculate that loss of CD117 expression after chemotherapy in a high proportion of SCLC indicates that in this tumor, Kit unlikely represents the product of a constitutive mutation, as instead shown in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Keeping this finding in mind, oncologists could re-test CD117 expression in relapsing small cell lung carcinomas in order to establish the best candidates for enrollment in ongoing clinical trials with Kit inhibitors. Practically speaking, CD117 may be helpful in discriminating between pulmonary high-grade neuroendocrine tumors and other histotypes, but pathologists should be aware that treated small cell lung carcinomas may remain unstained in a not insignificant number of cases.",

The importance and minimal criteria for distinction from solid (grade III) ACC are not well established. We report 11 new cases and review the literature to further define the profile of this tumor. The median age was 61 years (range: 32 to 72 y) with a male predominance (male to female ratio of 1.75:1). The most commonly involved sites were sinonasal (4/11) and submandibular (4/11). Lymph nodes were pathologically positive in 4/7 (57.1%) cases. Distant metastases to the lung (n=2) and soft tissue of the shoulder (n=1) were observed. Five of 9 patients (55.6%) died, all within 5 years with a median overall survival of 12 months. Histologically, ACC with high-grade transformation was distinguished from conventional ACC by nuclear enlargement and irregularity, higher mitotic counts, and the loss of the biphasic ductal-myoepithelial differentiation. Useful supportive criteria were prominent comedonecrosis and fibrocellular desmoplasia. The most common morphologies for the high-grade component were poorly differentiated cribriform adenocarcinoma and solid undifferentiated carcinoma. Micropapillary and squamoid patterns were occasionally present. Ki-67 and p53 labeling indices were elevated in the high-grade components, though c-kit and cyclin-D1 were not. ACC-high-grade transformation is a highly aggressive salivary gland tumor with a variety of histologic patterns. The high propensity for lymph node metastases suggests a role for neck dissection in patients with this rare tumor.",

        "Doc_abstract":"BACKGROUND: HER-2/neu and c-kit (CD117) onco-protein are increasingly being recognized as targets for therapy in solid tumors, but data on their role in malignant melanoma is currently limited. We studied the prevalence of overexpression of HER-2/neu and c-Kit in 202 patients with malignant melanoma to evaluate a possible prognostic value of these molecular targets in malignant melanoma. METHODS: Overexpression of HER-2/neu and c-Kit was evaluated using immunohistochemical assays in 202 archival tissue specimens. RESULTS: Between 1991 and 2001, 202 subjects (109 males; 54% and 93 females; 46%) with malignant melanoma were studied with a mean age of 57 years (age range: 15-101 years). The most common histologic type was amelanotic melanoma (n = 62; 30.7%) followed by superficial spreading melanoma (n = 54; 26.7%). The depth of penetration of melanoma (Breslow thickness, pT Stage) ranged from 0.4 mm (stage pT1) to 8.0 mm (stage pT4A). Mean thickness was 2.6 mm (stage pT3A). The ECOG performance scores ranged from 0 to 3. Only 2 patients (0.9%) revealed HER-2/neu overexpression, whereas 46 (22.8%) revealed c-Kit overexpression. Multivariate analysis performed did not show a significant difference in survival between c-Kit positive and negative groups (p = 0.36). Interestingly, not only was c-Kit more likely to be overexpressed in the superficial spreading type, a preliminary association between the presence or absence of c-Kit overexpression and the existence of another second primary tumor was also observed. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our large study indicate that the HER-2/neu onco-protein neither has a role in melanogenesis nor is a potential target for clinical trials with monoclonal antibody therapy. This indicates there is no role for its testing in patients with malignant melanoma. Although c-Kit, expressed preferentially in the superficial spreading type, may not have prognostic value, it does have significant therapeutic implications as a molecular target warranting further investigation.",

Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is included among these subtypes even if it has never been formally reported. We evaluated the clinical, radiologic, morphologic, immunohistochemical, and genetic features of 4 cases of thymic neoplasms with ACC-like features retrieved from the authors' consult files. Most cases affected adult/elderly males (mean 68.5 y; range: 63 to 77 y; M:F ratio=3:1), and were asymptomatic. The clinical history (no evidence of ACC in other sites), radiologic findings (a mass in the thymic region), and morphologic features (residual thymic tissue at the periphery of the neoplasm) strongly supported their primary thymic nature. Grossly, most of the tumors presented as multicystic lesions. On microscopic examination there were true glandular spaces filled with periodic acid-Schiff+material, and pseudocysts containing stromal mucin, collagen IV, and laminin. Features favoring malignancy were overtly infiltrative margins (2/4), mitotic figures (2/4), cytologic atypia (1/4), vascular invasion (1/4), absence of organoid thymuslike pattern (4/4), and absence of immature (TdT+) T lymphocytes (3/3). Necrosis and nerve invasion were not observed. The tumor cells showed the following immunophenotype: p63+(3/3), CK34betaE12+(3/3), CD5+ in scattered cells (1/3), CD117- (3/3), chromogranin-(2/2), synaptophysin-(2/2), and CD56- (2/2). MIB-1 ranged from 1% to 10%. Comparative genomic hybridization revealed an isolated gain of chromosome 8 in 1/3 cases. One patient is alive and well after 20 months, 1 died of another cause 5 years later, and 2 were lost at follow-up. Exceptionally, primary thymic tumors may exhibit histologic features resembling those of ACC of salivary glands. They may be well circumscribed and cytologically bland or invasive and cytologically atypical. In either case they lack an organoid thymuslike pattern and immature T lymphocytes. We have interpreted them as a microscopic subtype of well-differentiated thymic carcinoma of low-grade malignancy, an impression supported by the admittedly limited follow-up information.",

The presence of perineural invasion differed significantly among ACCs of various sites (83% salivary, 50% eyelid, 11% skin, P=0.0002). Over 90% of all ACCs were grade 1 or 2 and exhibited diffuse (>50%) positivity with CD117, SOX-10, and smooth muscle actin immunostains.

In salivary gland cancer, c-kit, EGFR, and VEGF are representative molecular markers that may predict remnant and recurrent tumors. In this study, the expression of c-kit, EGFR, and VEGF in adenoid cystic cancer was evaluated, and the relationships between the expression of these markers and the clinical findings were investigated.;The medical records of 48 patients who were treated for parotid adenoid cystic cancer from January 1990 to January 2006 were reviewed. The tumor location, size, histological subtypes, perineural invasion, the resected margin status, and lymph node metastasis were assessed. Immunohistochemical staining and semiquantitative analysis of c-kit, EGFR and VEGF were performed. The relationship between the expression of each marker and the clinicopathological factors were analyzed.;Positive c-kit immunostaining was present in 45 patients (94%), with weak positivity (+1) in 23, moderate positivity (+2) in 19 and strong positivity (+3) in three. Positive EGFR immunostaining was observed in 27 (56%), with weak positivity (+1) in 19 and moderate positivity (+2) in eight with no strong positive staining. Positive VEGF immunostaining was present in 42 patients (88%) with weak positivity (+1) in 12, moderate positivity (+2) in 17, and strong positivity (+3) in 13. Only the expression of VEGF was significantly higher in parotid gland tumors than in any other gland (P = 0.032). Marginal involvement was associated with strong VEGF expression (P = 0.02). No marker was significantly correlated with recurrence or the survival rate. Lymph node status was related to the survival rate.;The expression of c-kit, EGRF, and VEGF had no predictive value for recurrence or the prognosis of adenoid cystic cancer.

The aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathology and immunoprofile of cBCA. Nineteen cases of cBCA with at least a 30% area of cribriform structure under microscope were analyzed by the description of their histopathologic and immunohistochemical features using the antibodies of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), CK8&18, calponin, SMA, S100, P63, CD117, and laminin. The patients of cBCA ranged from 24 to 71 years with a distinct predilection for females (79%). The tumor was well-circumscribed and had no recurrent tendency after a local excision followed by a median of 67 months. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed that the tumor was rich in blood supply. Microscopically, it was mainly composed by the basaloid cells with the peripheral palisading. The cells around the cribriform pattern expressed P63 protein and had almost no immunoreactivity for calponin, SMA, S100, or CK8&18. The expression level of MMP9, laminin, and CD117 were significantly lower in cBCA than those in AdCC. Good circumscription, lack of infiltrative properties, and absence of MMP9, laminin, CD117, and myoepithelial marker (SMA, S100 and calponin) in the cells around the cribriform spaces, are the most reliable points for differential diagnosis of cBCA from AdCC.

The most significant aspect of this treatment approach is the proof that head and neck cancers are suitable for targeted therapies as has been shown in other malignancies. Unfortunately, there are other rare histologic types of head and neck cancer such as adenocarcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma. The latter has traditionally been considered to be chemotherapy resistant and surgical resection with or without adjuvant radiation therapy has been the rule as far as treatment is concerned. The course of adenoid cystic carcinoma ranges from indolent to aggressive; however, most patients succumb to the disease as a result of distant metastases. This clinical scenario poses a challenge to oncologists. Several conventional chemotherapy regimens and novel targeted agents have been tried in this rare histologic subtype without success.;In this case report, we present a 59-year-old Caucasian female with refractory adenoid cystic carcinoma of the maxilla metastatic to the lung that responded to sorafenib, a novel multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which targets angiogenesis, Raf kinase pathway, platelet-derived growth factor Ret, and c-Kit.;This case illustrates the possibility that this chemoresistant tumor may need the inhibition or blocking of several oncogenic pathways.

Whether these 2 molecules are coexpressed in lung neuroendocrine tumors has not been investigated. Here, we analyzed immunohistochemical results to determine expression and coexpression patterns of c-kit and bcl-2 in the spectrum of lung neuroendocrine tumors. Using a polyclonal antibody against c-kit and a monoclonal antibody against bcl-2, our data demonstrated that all 7 cases (100%) of SCLC included in this study were positive for both c-kit and bcl-2. Among 14 LCNECs, 7 (50%) stained positive for c-kit and 9 (64%) for bcl-2. All cases of high grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (SCLCs and LCNECs) that showed positive staining for c-kit coexpressed bcl-2. In contrast, all typical and atypical carcinoids (TC and AC) were negative for c-kit, and only 1 of 16 (6.3%) TCs and 1 of 6 (16.7%) ACs stained positive for bcl-2. These results indicate a progressive increase in the frequency of c-kit and bcl-2 expression and coexpression, from carcinoid tumors (TC and AC) to LCNEC and to SCLC. High grade neuroendocrine carcinomas are more likely to coexpress c-kit and bcl-2 when compared with carcinoid tumors. The high frequency of coexpression of these 2 molecules in high grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the lung suggests that they may be involved in the carcinogenic pathway, given their important roles in carcinogenesis. Therapeutic targeting on both c-kit and bcl-2 molecules might be beneficial in the management of patients with high grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the lung in the future.",

        "Doc_abstract":"c-kit is a proto-oncogene that codes for a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor (CD117). The gene product KIT is constitutively overexpressed in mastocytosis and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Recently the use of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as STI-571, has resulted in the successful treatment of bcr-abl-positive leukemias and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. In gastrointestinal stromal tumors, immunostaining for c-kit is diffusely positive. Because the expression of c-kit in mesenchymal tumors of the uterus and ovary has not been previously studied, we evaluated its expression in 38 of these tumors by immunohistochemistry. The number of positive labeled/total tumors were as follows: 0/8 malignant mullerian mixed tumors, 4/7 ovarian fibrosarcomas, 0/1 clear-cell ovarian sarcoma, 0/4 uterine leiomyosarcomas, 1/10 low-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas, 0/2 high-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas, and 3/6 endometrial stromal nodules. In all positive cases, no more than 5% of the cells were labeled. In conclusion, unlike gastrointestinal stromal tumors, mesenchymal tumors of the uterus and ovary rarely express c-kit. Therefore, it is unlikely that patients with these tumors will benefit from treatment with the currently available tyrosine kinase inhibitors.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The understanding of mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract has evolved dramatically over the last two decades since gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) was described as the most common stromal tumor arising anywhere from the esophagus to the ano-rectum. Although morphologically similar to other benign and malignant smooth muscle and neural stromal neoplasms, GIST constitutes a distinct group of rare gastrointestinal tract tumors that originate from the interstitial cells of Cajal, regulators of gut peristalsis that normally express CD117, which is the product of the c-KIT proto-oncogene that encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor that regulates cellular proliferation in GISTs. Virtually all GISTs occur from mutations of the c-KIT oncogene and exhibit consistent expression of c-KIT (CD117), which is considered the most specific criterion for a diagnosis of GIST. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors vary in their behavior and several features have to be considered to assess their malignant potential. The advent of sophisticated imaging techniques for the evaluation and sampling of stromal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract has resulted in improved detection of GISTs. The identification of a novel tumor-specific target in c-KIT resulted in the development of a tyrosine kinase-inhibitor (imatinib mesylate) that provides an encouraging option for treating GISTs. This article reviews recent advances in the understanding of the cell biology, diagnosis, and therapy of GISTS.",

The amplification status of HER-2/neu was also investigated by means of fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis on fixed material. The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-deregulated profile of the SDCs was characterized by the overexpression of activated TRK-A in the presence of its ligand, and the overexpression of HER-2/neu sustained by gene amplification. The RTK signature of the ACCs was represented by the overexpression of activated KIT and TRK-A and their cognate ligands, and the overexpression of activated HER-2/neu, in the absence of gene amplification, possibly sustained by epidermal growth factor receptor heterodimerization.

We examined reports and results in the field and articles or abstracts published in journals covered by MEDLINE. Additionally, we evaluated CD117 expression on fresh blast cells of 376 newly diagnosed cases of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that were referred to centers affiliated with the Italian Association for Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (AIEOP). In view of our data, approximately 11% of ALL are CD117 positive. In particular, this receptor can be expressed in 10% and 11.5% of T-lineage and B-lineage ALL, respectively. Its expression is associated with an intermediate/mature phenotype in T-lineage ALL, whereas in B-lineage ALL, the majority of the positive cases are classified as early B ALL.

In normal skin, SCF was mainly observed in endothelial cells of blood vessels but not frequently in basal melanocytes, whereas c-KIT was predominantly localised in tissue mast cells. In benign neoplastic melanocytes (common melanocytic naevi), localisation of SCF and c-KIT was complementary: SCF was mostly found in dermal naevus cells while c-KIT was revealed in epidermal naevus cells, although the expression of the latter antigen was not frequent. Malignant melanoma cells showed less frequent expression of these antigens than those in benign lesions. Of five cultured melanoma cell lines, SCF was observed in only one, and c-KIT was not found in any melanoma cells. No quantitative or qualitative alterations assessed by Western blot analysis were induced in the presence of phenotypic modifiers (sodium butyrate and HMBA).

Early myeloid cells also normally express c-Kit and their survival, proliferation and differentiation is promoted by SCF. It might therefore be expected that c-Kit mutations could also be involved in some acute and/or chronic myeloid leukaemias. We have found that mutant c-Kit (and normal c-Kit in the presence of SCF) provides a strong differentiation stimulus in normal and immortalised murine early myeloid cells. Since maturation of haemopoietic cells, with the exception of mast cells, results in down-regulation of c-Kit expression, the transforming effects of mutant receptor may be self-limiting in most lineages. This is consistent with the observation that multipotential progenitor cells from some patients with systemic mastocytosis express mutant c-Kit. However, c-Kit mutations have been observed in a few cases of myelodysplastic syndromes or AML without mast cell features. Oncogenesis involves multiple genetic changes and the phenotype of malignant haemopoietic cells expressing mutant c-Kit may be influenced by co-oncogenic events. For example mutations blocking the differentiative effect of mutant c-Kit might result in AML rather than mastocytosis. Thus the extent to which c-Kit mutations contribute to malignancies of early myeloid phenotype remains unknown, and resolution of this issue is complicated by the heterogeneity of this family of diseases.",

A normal tissue counterpart positive for c-kit product is detected in the testis (spermatocyte) and ovary (oocyte) but not in the lung or the cervix. In contrast, normal epithelial cells of the breast, skin basal cells and tissue mast cells harbour c-kit product, but transformed cells of the former two are largely deficient in the c-kit protein. One hundred and thirty-nine neuroendocrine tumours and 39 non-pulmonary small cell carcinomas were all negative, except for two cases of neuroblastoma. This indicates a distinct character for SCLC in c-kit expression. The c-kit product may be a useful marker in diagnostic pathology of seminoma/dysgerminoma and SCLC among human solid tumours, and in distinction of SCLC from non-pulmonary small cell carcinoma.",

According to this new biological classification, the objectives of our study were to assess the clinical, morphologic and immunophenotypic characteristics of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast in order to classify this subtype of breast carcinoma. A total of 18 cases of adenoid cystic carcinoma were identified from the Institut Curie files. Clinical information was available for 16 patients with a median follow-up of 6.5 years. Morphologically, all tumors were graded according to the system defined by Kleer and Oberman (histologic and nuclear grade). Immunophenotype was assessed with anti-ER, PR, HER-2, KIT, basal (CK5/6) and luminal cytokeratins (CK8/18) and p63 antibodies. One out of 18 tumors was nuclear grade 1 (16%), nine were nuclear grade 2 (50%) and eight were nuclear grade 3 (44%). All cases were estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER-2 negative. Epithelial cells were strongly positive around glandular lumina with one or both cytokeratins, identifying the coexistence of CK5/6+ cells, CK5/6 and CK8/18+ cells, CK8/18+ cells and p63+ cells. All cases (100%) were also KIT positive. In all, 15 patients were treated by surgery. Nine of them received adjuvant radiotherapy. Follow-up was available for 16 patients. In all, 14 patients were alive. Two of them, initially treated by surgery only, presented a local recurrence. Two patients died (one of them treated by radiation therapy only died from her disease). Our study shows that adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast is a special, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER-2 negative and highly KIT-positive, basal-like breast carcinoma, associated with an excellent prognosis. This highly specific immunophenotype could be useful to differentiate adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast from other subtypes of breast carcinoma such as cribriform carcinoma.",

The c-kit expression was positive in 59 (27%) of 217 tumours, while the c-kit expression was negative in 158 (73%) of 217 tumours. There was a significant correlation between a negative expression of the c-kit protein and lymph node metastasis (P < 0.0001), and the incidence of a negative expression of the c-kit protein increased as the number of the metastatic lymph nodes increased (P = 0.0003). The c-kit expression did not significantly correlate with the tumour size, nuclear grade, oestrogen receptor status, MIB-1 counts and p53 protein expression. A univariate analysis indicated the patients with the negative c-kit expression to have a worse disease-free survival (DFS) than those with the positive c-kit expression (P = 0.0041), while a multivariate analysis determined lymph node metastases and the MIB-1 counts to be independently significant factors for DFS. In conclusion, a loss of the c-kit expression was found in about three-fourth of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast and was associated with lymph node metastases. The prognostic implications of the c-kit expression seem to be due to fact that a loss of the c-kit expression is associated with an advanced stage of breast cancer.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of CD34, CD117 (c-kit), and Ki-67 in PT of the breast and attempt to correlate the staining pattern with tumor grade by morphology. Immunohistochemical expression of CD117, CD34, and Ki-67 was studied on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissue material from 33 cases of PT. Histologically, there were 21 benign, 6 borderline, and 6 malignant (high-grade) tumors. All 6 histologically malignant PTs were positive for CD117 (100%), but only 1 marked with CD34 (16.7%). Borderline PTs frequently coexpressed CD34 and CD117 (66.7%). The benign PTs, on the other hand, most commonly (52.4%) showed a CD34(+)/CD117(-) immunoprofile with 33.3% cases coexpressing the markers: that is, CD34(+)/CD117(+). Although most benign PTs (80.6%) showed a Ki-67 of <2%, a few cases showed slightly higher proliferation indices.

We studied multiple oncogenic and therapeutic related proteins by immunohistochemistry to identify differences in expression between benign and malignant sebaceous proliferations. A total of 27 cases, including 9 sebaceous adenomas, 4 sebaceomas, 8 sebaceous carcinomas, and 6 cases of sebaceous hyperplasia, were examined by immunohistochemistry, with antibodies directed against Ki-67 (MIB-1), bcl-2, p53, p21WAF1, p27Kip1, c-erbB-2 (Her-2/neu), CD117 (c-kit), cyclin D1, MDM2, CD99, MLH-1, and MSH-2. We found that sebaceous adenomas and sebaceomas stained like sebaceous hyperplasia did, whereas carcinomas had statistically significantly increased levels of p53 (50% versus 11%, respectively) and Ki-67 (30% versus 10%). The carcinomas also had significantly reduced levels of bcl-2 (7% versus 56%, respectively) and p21 (16% versus 34%) compared to the adenomas. Thus, a combination of several of these markers may be diagnostically useful in challenging cases. In addition, we found little or no Her-2/neu and CD117 staining, indicating that immunotherapy with Herceptin or Gleevac would likely not be useful for sebaceous carcinomas. Moreover, these results show that sebaceous adenomas and carcinomas are distinct neoplasms and provide no support for the theory that all sebaceous adenomas are truly malignant.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The receptor tyrosine kinase c-Kit plays a critical role in hematopoiesis, and gain-of-function mutations of the receptor are frequently seen in several malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and testicular carcinoma. The most common mutation of c-Kit in these disorders is a substitution of the aspartic acid residue in position 816 to a valine (D816V), leading to constitutive activation of the receptor. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of Src family kinases in c-Kit/D816V signaling. Src family kinases are necessary for the phosphorylation of wild-type c-Kit as well as of activation of downstream signaling pathways including receptor ubiquitination and the Ras/Mek/Erk pathway. Our data demonstrate that, unlike wild-type c-Kit, the phosphorylation of c-Kit/D816V is not dependent on Src family kinases. In addition, we found that neither receptor ubiquitination nor Erk activation by c-Kit/D816V required activation of Src family kinases. In vitro kinase assay using synthetic peptides revealed that c-Kit/D816V had an altered substrate specificity resembling Src and Abl tyrosine kinases. We further present evidence that, in contrast to wild-type c-Kit, Src family kinases are dispensable for c-Kit/D816V cell survival, proliferation, and colony formation. Taken together, we demonstrate that the signal transduction pathways mediated by c-Kit/D816V are markedly different from those activated by wild-type c-Kit and that altered substrate specificity of c-Kit circumvents a need for Src family kinases in signaling of growth and survival, thereby contributing to the transforming potential of c-Kit/D816V.",

The mean values of immunoreactive score (IRS) were compared. The IRS of the c-kit proto-oncogene product in normal mammary epithelia was 5.90 +/- 1.37 (mean +/- s.d.). In benign tissues, the c-kit proto-oncogene product was detected heterogeneously with a reduced IRS (4.05 +/- 1.82). In primary breast cancer tissues, the expression of the c-kit proto-oncogene product was often deleted and the average IRS (0.90 +/- 1.73) was significantly reduced compared to those of the normal breast tissues or benign breast disease tissues, but no significant difference was shown between the breast cancer groups.

Of 43 (13%) women who suffered recurrences during the follow-up period, CD117 stromal staining predicted recurrent disease (P<0.05), but p53 was not correlative. We conclude that tissue microarrays are a convenient method for evaluating immunostaining results of large numbers of phyllodes tumors. Although positive p53 stromal immunohistochemical detection may corroborate histologic malignancy, it is CD117 protein expression in phyllodes tumor stromal cells that may be of potential utility in predicting recurrent disease.",

Herein presented is a case of pigmented ACC arising from epidermis of the ear skin. An 85-year-old man presented black tumor of the right ear. Dermatologists' diagnosis was basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Large biopsy was obtained. The biopsy showed proliferation of atypical basaloid cells arranged in a cribriform pattern. The tumor cells were continuous with epidermis, as if it arose from the epidermis. Focal areas show melanin deposition in the tumor cells. Mucin stains showed that the tumor cells and tubular lumens contained acidic mucin. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin (CK) AE1/3, CK34BE12, CK5/6, CK7, CK14, p63, alpha-smooth muscle actin (ASMA), S100 protein, p53, Ki-67 (labeling 85%), KIT, PDGFRA and CD56. The tumor cells were negative for CK CAM5.2, CK8, CK18, CK19, CK20, EMA, desmin, CEA, HMB45, CD10, CD34, neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin, synaptophysin, CDX2, MUC1, MUC2, MUC5AC and MUC6. HMB-positive and S100-positive melanocytes were seen in a very few areas. Since characteristic cribriform pattern was recognized in the tumor and the tumor showed epithelial markers, myoepithelial markers (CD14, p63, ASMA, S100 protein) and KIT, the pathological diagnosis of ACC was made. No distant and lymph node metastasis is now seen. The patient will be treated by complete resection. The present cutaneous ACC was unique in that the ACC arose from the epidermis, had melanin pigment, and occurred in ear skin.",

It usually presents in middle-aged to elderly patients and can exhibit a wide variety of morphologic appearances. Thymic basaloid carcinoma (thymic BC) is a particularly rare subtype, with less than 20 cases published in the English literature, mostly in the form of individual case reports. In this study, we present the clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical features of 12 new cases of thymic BC. There were 10 (83%) men and 2 (17%) women. Ages at the time of initial diagnosis ranged from 34 to 77 years (mean 55 y). The 2 most common manners of presentation were dyspnea on exertion (3 patients) and as an incidental finding on radiographic imaging (2 patients). Tumors ranged in size from 4.4 to 17 cm (mean 10.1 cm). One of 12 cases (8.3%) was associated with a multilocular thymic cyst. Immunohistochemistry was performed in 8 cases. Pan-cytokeratin was positive in all cases. CD117 (c-kit) was positive in 6 of 8 cases (75%), p63 was positive in 7 of 8 cases (88%), p53 was positive in 7 of 8 cases (88%), ranging from <10% to 90%, CD5 was focally positive in 3 of 8 cases (38%), collagen type IV was positive in 4 of 8 cases (50%), and proliferative index, as estimated by Ki67, ranged from <1% to approximately 15%. In 1 of 2 cases with sarcomatoid differentiation, Ki67 was greater than 80% in the sarcomatoid area. Cases were negative for thyroid transcription factor-1 (0 of 8), S-100 (0 of 7), and synaptophysin (0 of 7). Long-term data was available in 8 patients with an average follow-up of 30 months. Five patients died of their disease at an average of 34 months from the time of diagnosis. Of the remaining 3 patients, 1 had a stable recurrence and died at 4 years from unrelated causes, and 2 were alive without the evidence of disease at 12 and 7 months, respectively. Thymic BC, although previously regarded as a low-grade neoplasm, has shown that it is capable of aggressive behavior and significant mortality. In this paper, we review the pertinent literature and discuss the possible relationship of thymic BC with thymic adenoid cystic carcinoma, as well as BCs and adenoid cystic carcinomas at other sites.",

The abundant expression of c-kit receptor is indispensable for the survival of mast cells. In addition, the gain-of-function mutations of c-kit receptor were found in several tumor mast cell lines. When these gain-of-function mutations were introduced to cells of murine interleukin (IL)-3-dependent cell lines, the expression of c-kit receptor with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity not only abrogated the IL-3 requirement of the cells, but also caused them to become tumorigenic in nude athymic mice. The gain-of-function mutations of c-kit receptor appear to result in the malignant transformation of mast cells.

In this study we examine 25 additional primary MCCs and also 6 of their lymph node metastases. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were stained immunohistochemically with an antibody directed against the KIT receptor. Percentage and intensity of staining were analyzed semiquantitatively using a three-tiered system. Twenty-one of the 25 (84%) primary tumors stained positively for KIT, of which 14 (67%) showed widespread positivity. Five of the 6 lymph nodes (83%) were similarly positive. High mitotic rate and vascular invasion in the primary tumors tended to be associated with prominent staining in the lymph node metastases. No association was found between c-kit expression and outcome. We confirm that the majority of primary MCCs express c-kit and further find that metastases are positive for the KIT receptor as well. Thus, c-kit expression may be an early event in the transformation of MCC, but not a marker for tumor progression.",

Generally, only a very small population of the lymphoma cells expressed C-KIT. This finding indicates a difference to the systemic variant of CD30+ ALCL.

Common biological features between human stem cells and cancer cells include (A) self-renewal, (B) extensive capacity of proliferation, (C) migration to and homing at distant sites and (D) resistance to toxic agents. Given these shared attributes, cancer was proposed to originate from transforming mutation(s) in normal stem cells that dysregulate their physiological programs. This theory has been recently supported by the findings that among all malignant cells within a particular tumour, only cell fraction expressing stem cell markers such as c-Kit named 'cancer stem cells' has the exclusive potential to generate tumour cell population. The involvement of c-Kit and its mutation in various haematological malignancies and solid tumours are reviewed. The impacts of dysregulated c-Kit as oncogenic tyrosine kinase on autocrine stimulation and resistance to chemotherapy of cancer stem cells are evaluated. The significance and efficacy of molecular therapeutic targeting of c-Kit signaling pathway in the management of patients with c-Kit-positive malignancies are appraised.",

Patients with tumours expressing c-kit tend to exhibit better survival, but a paracrine/autocrine function for the stem cell factor (SCF)/c-kit system in nasopharyngeal carcinomas has not been reported. This study evaluated the expression of c-kit and SCF by immunohistochemical staining of nasopharyngeal epithelium (NPE) and of primary and metastatic NPCs. In addition, c-kit and SCF expression were studied in HONE-1 NPC cells by immunoprecipitation and western blotting. Expression of c-kit and SCF was detected in 75% and 57% of NPE, respectively, and there was 48% co-expression. In primary NPCs, 86% expressed c-kit, 69% had SCF expression, and there was 67% co-expression. In metastatic NPCs, 76% expressed c-kit, 72% expressed SCF and there was 68% co-expression. Co-expression of c-kit and SCF with tyrosine autophosphorylation of p145(c - kit) was demonstrated in HONE-1 NPC cells. In addition, the expression level of c-kit and its autophosphorylation status was not obviously influenced by the transient co-expression of Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1). Co-expression of c-kit and SCF is therefore commonly found in nasopharyngeal epithelium and NPCs, and in HONE-1 NPC cells with autoactivation possibly independent of the co-expression of EBNA1 and LMP1. All of these findings suggest that autoactivation of SCF/c-kit signalling may be a potent regulator of the nasopharyngeal epithelial barrier and of immune function at the nasopharyngeal mucosa surface, and may contribute to the carcinogenesis and progression of NPC. Further molecular analysis is required to evaluate the possibility of treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors in NPC, analogous to the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumours with STI571.",

Aberrant activation of c-Kit results in dysregulated signaling and is implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous cancers. The development of more specific and effective c-Kit therapies is warranted given its essential role in tumorigenesis. In this study, we describe the biological properties of CK6, a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody against the extracellular region of human c-Kit. CK6 specifically binds c-Kit receptor with high affinity (EC 50 = 0.06 nM) and strongly blocks its interaction with SCF (IC 50 = 0.41 nM) in solid phase assays. Flow cytometry shows CK6 binding to c-Kit on the cell surface of human small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), melanoma, and leukemia tumor cell lines. Furthermore, exposure to CK6 inhibits SCF stimulation of c-Kit tyrosine kinase activity and downstream signaling pathways such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase B (AKT), in addition to reducing tumor cell line growth in vitro. CK6 treatment significantly decreases human xenograft tumor growth in NCI-H526 SCLC (T/C% = 57) and Malme-3M melanoma (T/C% = 58) models in vivo. The combination of CK6 with standard of care chemotherapy agents, cisplatin and etoposide for SCLC or dacarbazine for melanoma, more potently reduces tumor growth (SCLC T/C% = 24, melanoma T/C% = 38) compared with CK6 or chemotherapy alone. In summary, our results demonstrate that CK6 is a c-Kit antagonist antibody with tumor growth neutralizing properties and are highly suggestive of potential therapeutic application in treating human malignancies harboring c-Kit receptor.

Dysregulation of c-Kit function is oncogenic and its expression in the stem cell niche of a number of tissues has underlined its relevance for regenerative medicine and hematopoietic stem cell biology. Yet, very little is known about the mechanisms that control c-Kit protein levels. Here we show that the RanBPM/RanBP9 scaffold protein binds to c-Kit and is necessary for normal c-Kit protein expression in the mouse testis and subset lineages of the hematopoietic system. RanBPM deletion causes a reduction in c-Kit protein but not its mRNA suggesting a posttranslational mechanism. This regulation is specific to the c-Kit receptor since RanBPM reduction does not affect other membrane proteins examined. Importantly, in both mouse hematopoietic system and testis, RanBPM deficiency causes defects consistent with c-Kit loss of expression suggesting that RanBPM is an important regulator of c-Kit function. The finding that this regulatory mechanism is also present in human cells expressing endogenous RanBPM and c-Kit suggests a potential new strategy to target oncogenic c-Kit in malignancies.",

Their spectrum and association with specific malignancies offer multiple targets for therapeutic intervention. Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) represents an ideal target for a therapy using a selective inhibitor of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase. The 2-phenylpyrimidine derivative STI571 was rationally designed to inhibit ABL and BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activities through competitive ATP-binding pocket interactions. Phase II data demonstrate hematologic and cytogenetic responses in interferon refractory chronic-phase, accelerated-phase and blast crisis patients. However, long-term observation is needed to confirm that response data result in prolongation of survival. STI571 is being studied in other malignancies, including leukemias characterized by expression of alternate molecular forms of BCR-ABL and those expressing protein tyrosine kinases with ATP-binding pockets structurally similar to ABL, e.g. c-kit and PDGF-R. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) cells overexpress the stem cell factor receptor CD117, the product of the proto-oncogene c-kit. Inhibition of c-kit in vivo results in an immediate metabolic change of the tumor cells, detectable by positron emission tomography. Since c-kit overexpression is inhibited in small-cell lung cancer cell lines, a study with STI571 as second-line therapy of c-kit-positive small-cell lung cancer is in progress. Clinical studies are ongoing in malignancies associated with an enhanced activity of the PDGF-R, such as highgrade glioma, prostate cancer and leukemias with rearrangements of PDGF-R.

These tumours have unique histological, immunophenotypic and molecular genetic features that set them apart from typical smooth muscle tumours and schwannomas; however, by tradition, they have been classified as GI-smooth muscle tumours, or stromal tumours/smooth muscle tumours. GISTs occur predominantly in persons over 40 years of age with an equal sex incidence. Benign GISTs outnumber the malignant ones by a margin of 10:1. GISTs occur throughout the gastrointestinal tract, but are most common in the stomach (60-70%) and small intestine (30%). GISTs are rare in esophagus, colon and rectum. Histologically they may show a spindle cell or epithelioid pattern (the former largely corresponds with the designation of cellular leiomyoma and the latter with that of leiomyoblastoma). Immunohistochemically most GISTs are positive for CD34 and c-kit protein (CD117); the latter is quite specific for GISTs among mesenchymal tumours. Genetically GISTs commonly show DNA losses in the long arm of chromosome 14, and c-kit gene mutations occur at least in some cases. c-kit is also expressed in the interstitial cells of Cajal, the gastrointestinal pacemaker cells, and relationship of GISTs to these cells has been proposed recently. GISTs differ histologically, immunohistochemically and genetically from typical (esophageal) leiomyomas that are negative for c-kit and CD34 and neither show DNA-losses in 14q nor c-kit mutations. Evaluation of malignancy of GISTs is based on mitotic count, tumour size and extra-gastrointestinal spread. Tumours with mitotic counts higher than 5/10 high power fields or larger than 10 cm have a significant risk for recurrence and metastasis and are considered histologically malignant; however, some tumours with mitotic activity < 1/10HPF may metastasize indicating some uncertainty in malignant potential of GISTs, especially those larger than 5 cm.",

This suggests that therapy with specific RAF kinase inhibitors may find use in treating this disease. If the response to RAF kinase inhibition is dependent on the presence of an activated BRAF protein, it will be necessary to evaluate cases of malignant melanoma for the presence or absence of BRAF mutations. High-resolution amplicon melting analysis is able to detect single base-pair changes in DNA isolated from paraffin-embedded tissue sections and obviates the need for direct DNA sequencing. Results can be available within 48 hours. In this report, we used high-resolution amplicon melting analysis to evaluate 90 cases of malignant melanoma for BRAF mutations. Of these 90 cases, 74 were metastatic melanomas, 12 were primary cutaneous melanomas, and 4 were in situ melanomas. BRAF activation mutations were found in 43 cases (48%). Forty-one of these mutations were in exon 15. The mutations in exon 15 included V600E (34 cases), V600K (6 cases), and V600R (1 case). Two activating mutations were found in exon 11, G469V and G469R. The presence or absence of a BRAF mutation in the junctional component of an invasive melanoma was maintained in the invasive component. We also evaluated these 90 cases, as well as an additional 10 cases (total of 100) for the expression of c-kit. The majority of invasive and metastatic malignant melanomas did not express c-kit, although all in situ lesions and the junctional components of invasive lesions were strongly c-kit positive. Surprisingly, 2 cases of metastatic malignant melanoma (2%) showed strong and diffuse c-kit expression and contained a c-kit-activating mutation, L576P, as detected by high-resolution amplicon melting analysis and confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. These 2 c-kit mutation-positive cases did not contain BRAF mutations. The presence of a c-kit-activating mutation in metastatic malignant melanoma suggests that a small number of melanomas may progress by a somatic mutation of the c-kit gene.

The paucity of reliable histochemical and immunohistochemical markers for the detection of mast cells in paraffin sections further confounds this diagnosis. The authors have employed immunohistochemistry for the C-KIT encoded tyrosine kinase receptor protein, CD117, for detection of mast cells on paraffin sections of 89 bone marrow specimens including systemic mast cell disease and other disorders. CD117 staining was found in all cases of mast cell disorders (seven of seven), and in one case of chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis.

One such activating point mutation is the N822K replacement in the c-Kit protein. Here we investigate the selective cytotoxic effect of binase--RNase from Bacillus intermedius--on FDC-P1-N822K cells. These cells were derived from myeloid progenitor FDC-P1 cells, in which ectopic expression of N822K c-kit gene induces interleukin-3 independent growth. In order to determine whether the sensitivity of these cells to binase is caused by the expression of c-kit oncogene, the cytotoxicity of the RNase was studied in the presence of selective inhibitor of mutated c-Kit imatinib (Gleevec). Inhibition of mutated c-Kit protein leads to the loss of cell sensitivity to the apoptotic effect of binase, while the latter still decreases the amount of cellular RNA. Using green fluorescent protein as an expression marker for the c-Kit oncoprotein, we demonstrate that the elimination of c-Kit is the key factor in selective cytotoxicity of binase. Quantitative RT-PCR with RNA samples isolated from the binase-treated FDC-P1-N822K cells shows that binase treatment results in 41% reduction in the amount of с-kit mRNA. This indicates that the transcript of the activated mutant c-kit is the target for toxic action of binase. Thus, the combination of inhibition of oncogenic protein with the destruction of its mRNA is a promising approach to eliminating malignant cells.",

To test the feasibility of using adenovirus vectors for antisense strategies and to target c-kit in SCLC therapy, we constructed replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus vectors which express fragments of c-kit transcripts in antisense (Ad.kitAS) or sense orientation (Ad.kitS: control).

As expected, at 10 days after infection (1 multiplicity of infection), Ad.kitAS-infected SBC-1 cells showed approximately 40% growth inhibition compared to uninfected or Ad.kitS-infected cells in vitro. Such a significant growth inhibition by Ad.kitAS was not induced in SBC-5 cells, which are SCLC cells producing no c-Kit protein.

The relevant literature was also reviewed.;The four patients were female, with age ranged from 46 - 65 years old (average 56 years) and the maximum tumor diameter ranged from 1.5 to 2.5 cm. Microscopically, the tumors exhibited a predominantly solid architecture with a myxoid or hyalinized stroma. The tumor cells showed moderate to marked nuclear atypia, and a basaloid appearance with scanty cytoplasm and inconspicuous nucleoli, and ≥ 5 mitotic figures per 10 high power fields. Glandular space embedded within tumor islands could be noticed. These spaces were genuine glandular structures and the cells lining these true glandular lumens had more abundant and eosinophilic cytoplasm. Pseudoglandular spaces of cribriform pattern or variable shape were also occasionally seen, and these cysts contained homogenous eosinophilic material. Focal necrosis was found. All cases were negative for ER, PR and HER2. Immunohistochemical staining for CK5/6, CK7 and CK14 was positive in the genuine glandular structures. All cases were positive for CD10, but also positive with varying intensity from weak to strong for vimentin and CD117. Staining for Ki-67 in three patients showed 10% - 50% positive.;The solid variant of mammary adenoid cystic carcinoma with basaloid features is a histologically distinctive and also a rare subset of the mammary adenoid cystic carcinoma. Awareness of its pathological features can help with the diagnosis as well as differential diagnosis. More cases are still needed for accurately assessing the prognosis of this particular tumor.",

To our knowledge there are no published studies on c-KIT and squamous cell carcinomas of the vulva (VSCC). Although there are a significant number of other tumor types which express c-KIT, there remains controversy as to its relationship to patient outcome. Thus, we wished to investigate such controversial findings to determine the prognostic importance of c-KIT by evaluating its protein and mRNA expression in VSCCs, correlating these findings with clinicopathological features and Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection.;c-KIT expression was scored by immunohistochemistry (IHC) as positive or negative in 139 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cases of vulvar carcinomas arrayed in a tissue microarray (TMA) using the DAKO A4502 rabbit polyclonal c-KIT antibody (diluted 1:100). c-KIT mRNA was evaluated by qRT-PCR in 34 frozen samples from AC Camargo Hospital Biobank (17 tumoral and 17 non-tumoral samples) using TaqMan probes-Applied Biosystems [Hs00174029_m1]. HPV genotyping was assessed in 103 samples using Linear Array® HPV Genotyping Test kit (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). All results obtained were correlated with clinical and pathological data of the patients.;c-KIT protein was positive by immunohistochemistry in 70.5% of the cases and this was associated with a higher global survival (p = 0.007), a higher recurrence-free survival (p < 0.0001), an absence of associated lesions (p = 0.001), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.0053), and HPV infection (p = 0.034). Furthermore, c-KIT mRNA quantitation revealed higher levels of transcripts in normal samples compared to tumor samples (p = 0,0009).;Our findings indicate that those vulvar tumors staining positively for c-KIT present better prognosis. Thus, positivity of c-KIT as evaluated by IHC may be a good predictor for use of more conservative surgery techniques and lymph node dissection in vulvar cancer. So part of the essence of our study is to see the possibility of translating our current results from the bench to the bedside. This will help provide patients a more appropriate, less mutilating treatment, in order to keep the maximum physical and psychic quality as possible to these women.",

Because the activating mutations are dominant, it has been assumed that they are heterozygous in the affected tumors. To test this, we have carefully examined the DNA sequencing electropherograms on 43 BRAF mutation-positive and 3 c-kit mutation-positive malignant melanomas to determine the ratio of the normal to mutant allele. Of the 43 BRAF mutation-positive tumors, we classified 26 as presumptive heterozygous. Eight cases were indeterminate. Surprisingly, 9 cases appeared to contain an excess of the mutant allele. BRAF fluorescence in situ hybridization on these 9 cases suggested the increased amount of the mutant BRAF allele was due to amplification (2 cases) or chromosome 7 polysomy (7 cases). We have previously described the presence of the c-kit-activating mutation, L576P, in 2 of 100 malignant melanomas. In this report, we have evaluated an additional 53 cases and found 1 additional case that contained the L576P mutation. Evaluation of the DNA sequencing electropherograms from all 3 cases of L576P mutation-positive melanoma suggests a selective loss of the normal allele. Fluorescence in situ hybridization for c-kit on these 3 L576P mutation-positive tumors indicated that one showed slight amplification of the c-kit gene and the other 2 were present in a nonamplified diploid state. These results have important implications concerning the mechanism of oncogenesis in melanoma as well as in the response of the tumor to anticancer drugs targeting BRAF or c-kit.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) represent a distinct and the most important subset of mesenchymal tumors of the GI tract. These tumors are both phenotypically and genotypically different from true leiomyomas and usually express CD34, a hematopoietic progenitor cell antigen. CD34, however, is also present in a wide variety of fibroblastic and endothelial cell tumors. In this immunohistochemical study of CD117, we evaluated 85 cases of GIST and more than 150 other mesenchymal tumors, including leiomyomas and schwannomas. CD117, the c-kit proto-oncogene product, is expressed in subsets of hematopoietic stem cells, mast cells, melanocytes, and interstitial cells of Cajal of the GI tract. CD117 was almost always (85%) expressed in both benign and malignant GISTs. CD117 was observed both in the spindle cell and epithelioid subtypes of GISTs in all locations. In addition to reacting with the CD34-positive GISTs, CD117 was positive in some CD34-negative cases. Approximately one-third of GISTs coexpressed CD117 and smooth muscle actins. In contrast, true leiomyomas (desmin and actin-positive) and schwannomas in both GI and peripheral locations were consistently negative for CD117. Solitary fibrous tumors and Kaposi's sarcomas, which are typically CD34 positive, were consistently CD117 negative. Among the CD34-positive tumors that showed occasional CD117 reactivity were dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (1 of 7) and hemangiopericytoma (2 of 10). Other mesenchymal tumors that were variably CD 117 positive included clear cell sarcoma (7 of 15), metastatic melanoma (9 of 25), and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (1 of 20). These results indicate that CD117 is a specific marker for GIST among tumors that occur in the GI tract and adjacent regions. CD117 expression also separates GISTs from true leiomyomas and gastric schwannomas.",

Significantly, c-kit strongly promoted tumor cell invasiveness by increasing ETV4, which induced MMP7 expression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via ERK pathway. In vitro up- or down-regulating c-kit activation in human colorectal cancer HCT-116 cells further consolidated these results. In conclusion, our data suggested that the c-kit signaling obviously promoted proliferation and invasion of CRMAC.

The transmembrane c-kit protein is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is crucial in melanocytic homeostasis and, when mutated, is associated with tumor development in those cells. In human studies, its expression is generally detected in melanocytomas and primary malignant melanomas, being lost with tumor progression and metastasis. In this study, we aimed to analyze c-kit expression in canine cutaneous melanocytic tumors and its association with tumor behavior, in order to investigate the dog's potential in comparative pathology and c-kit's potential in the diagnosis of these tumors. The expression of c-kit was evaluated immunohistochemically in 39 canine cutaneous melanocytic tumors and scored in terms of the labeling location, extension, and intensity. The labeling location was essentially cytoplasmic, and the labeling extension and intensity were generally higher in melanocytomas (83.3% diffuse-labeled cells) than those in malignant melanomas (22.2% negative-labeled cells). The differences found in the labeling extension were statistically significant (P < 0.001). There was no association between c-kit immunoexpression in malignant melanomas and the clinicopathological criteria, except between the labeling intensity and the degree of intralesional pigmentation (P = 0.048). Our results for labeling extension are in agreement with similar human studies, reinforcing the dog's potential as a model organism for investigation in this type of cancer. In addition, the loss of c-kit expression in malignant melanomas might be a criterion of tumor aggressiveness, indicating that this receptor may be useful in the diagnosis of these tumors.",

The maturation of ICCs is dependent on SCF-KIT interaction. The cellular origin, differentiation, nomenclature, and prognosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are controversial.;To test the hypothesis that GISTs originate from CD34-positive stem cells and differentiate toward an ICC phenotype.;We studied 27 cases of smooth muscle differentiated GISTs collected for 14 years (1985-1999), including 8 benign (leiomyoma), 15 malignant primary (leiomyosarcoma), and 4 metastatic to the liver. Immunohistochemical studies of selected lineage-directed monoclonal antibodies of c-kit (CD117), CD34, vimentin, desmin, alpha-actin, S100, and MIB-1 were performed on both normal and tumor tissues.;Immunoperoxidase stains of normal gastrointestinal tract showed both c-kit and CD34-positive cells surrounding the Auerbach ganglia plexus in the gastrointestinal tract. Twenty-seven of 27 tumors strongly expressed c-kit. Fourteen of 27 tumors were positive for CD34. Of the malignant GISTs, 14 of 19 were positive for CD34; of the benign tumors, 0 of 8 were positive for CD34. Thus, CD34 was the best indicator of malignant phenotype.;This is the first description of benign smooth muscle GISTs negative for CD34. The results of this study suggest that GISTs originate from CD34-positive stem cells and differentiate toward pacemaker cell phenotype. The lack of expression of CD34 in the benign GIST may indicate that benign GISTs are composed of more mature ICCs, whereas malignant GISTs are composed of dedifferentiated ICCs that express CD34-positive stem cells.",

Aberrant expression or mutation of c-kit has been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of many cancers. Studies using imatinib mesylate (STI 571, Gleevec, Novartis, East Hannover, NJ, USA), an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases brc-abl, c-kit, and PDGFR, have shown significant response in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumor. With the aim of identifying additional groups of tumors that may use the stem cell factor/c-kit pathway and, secondarily, may be responsive to imatinib mesylate treatment, we looked at the expression of c-kit in medulloblastoma. Medulloblastoma, a highly invasive primitive neuroectodermal tumor of the cerebellum, is the most common, malignant central nervous system tumor of childhood. Histologic features of medulloblastoma have failed to provide an accurate prediction of the clinical-biological behavior of these tumors. Characterizing the genetic events that play a role in the biology of these tumors may allow for molecular sub-typing and could lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This study evaluated c-kit expression and mutational status in 10 medulloblastoma tumor samples. All 10 medulloblastoma tumors expressed c-kit by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and 9 by immunohistochemical analysis. All tumor samples were screened for mutations in exons 9, 11, and 13 of the c-kit gene by direct sequencing. No sequence abnormalities were detected in these exons. These experiments lead us to the conclusion that c-kit activation in medulloblastoma is independent of mutation.",

Malignant fibrous histiocytomas, extraskeletal osteosarcomas, fibrosarcomas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, and angiosarcomas are most frequently encountered. Radiation-associated synovial sarcomas are exceptional. We report the clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular features of two radiation-associated synovial sarcomas. One tumor developed in a 42-year-old female 17 years after external irradiation was given for breast carcinoma; the other occurred in a 34-year-old female who was irradiated at the age of 7 years for a nonneoplastic condition of the left hand. Both lesions showed morphologic features of monophasic spindle cell synovial sarcoma, were immunoreactive for cytokeratins, epithelial membrane antigen, CD99, CD117 (c-kit), and bcl-2 and bore the t(X;18) (SYT-SSX1) translocation.

Histologic sections showed a cellular proliferation of spindle neoplastic cells that were arranged in short fascicles. Numerous mitotic figures and foci of necrosis were noted. The neoplastic cells expressed CD117 (c-Kit protein) and vimentin. They were negative for smooth muscle actin, desmin, myoglobin, cytokeratin, S100 protein, and CD34.

Ovarian carcinomas frequently develop resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Immunohistochemical expression of c-ABL, PDGFR-beta, and c-KIT was evaluated in ovarian carcinomas to determine whether treatment with imatinib mesylate might be feasible.;The expression of c-ABL, c-KIT, and PDGFR-beta in tumors was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis of 52 ovarian serous carcinomas, including 21 low-grade (well differentiated) and 31 high-grade (poorly differentiated) tumors. Fourteen normal ovaries were also evaluated.;In normal ovarian surface epithelium, c-ABL was expressed universally. PDGFR-beta was expressed in the majority (93%) of samples of normal ovarian epithelium, whereas the c-KIT protein was undetectable in normal ovarian surface epithelium.

The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of CD117 in normal, inflammatory, neoplastic, and reactive lesions of the thyroid. Using polyclonal anti-CD117 antibody, we performed immunohistochemical staining on tissue blocks from 230 cases obtained from the archives of the Department of Pathology, Ondokuz Mayis University (Samsun, Turkey), collected between 1990 and 2006. Each slide was evaluated for extent and intensity of staining. Staining extent was expressed as the percentage of stained cells. Staining of <10% of the cells was accepted as negative. Staining intensity was evaluated only in positive cases. By addition of the extent and intensity scores, the combined score was calculated. In our study, the combined CD117 staining scores of neoplastic and inflammatory groups were found to be higher than the reactive and normal groups. Within the neoplastic group, papillary carcinomas differed from follicular adenomas significantly, although papillary carcinomas showed no statistically significant difference compared to follicular carcinomas. Immunohistochemical CD117 positivity was detected in a wide range of neoplastic and inflammatory thyroid diseases. The neoplastic group and, within them, the papillary carcinomas showed a higher ratio of CD117 positivity. Although our results need to be confirmed by other molecular and genetic studies, the high rate of positivity in papillary carcinomas was one of the striking findings, which may result in novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",

No expression of c-kit was detected in non-seminomas or in normal testicular germ cells.

Excisional biopsy revealed a pseudoencapsulated, bosselated tumor with a spindled, hypocellular and heavily PAS-positive stroma constituted by abundant basement membrane material and collagen. Scattered lumens and focal cribriform cellular clusters were present in the peripheries of several of the lobules. Immunohistochemistry showed epithelial membrane antigen+ and cytokeratin (CK) 7+ in many small lumenal structures. The spindled cells were calponin+, CK5/6+, CK14+, and p63+, confirming their myoepithelial nature. The Ki67 proliferation index was 2-3% and upregulation of nuclear p53, a tumor suppressor gene product which may be aberrantly over-expressed in malignancy, was observed in rare cells.

Inhibitory effects on proliferation by Imatinib on these cell lines were determined by CCK-8 assay. Pearson product moment correlation and t test were used to analyze the correlation betweeen C-KIT overexpression, C-KIT gene mutation, and the inhibitory effect of Imatinib.;Compared with NPE cell line NP-69, NPC cell lines CNE-1, CNE-2, Hone-1, C-666, SUNE-1, and 5-8F had significantly higher levels of C-KIT expression. Heterozygous IVS17+78T>C were found in CNE-1, CNE-2, Hone-1, and NP-69 cell lines, homozygous IVS17+78T>C was found in C-666, and no mutation was found in SUNE-1 or 5-8F. Imatinib had a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on proliferation for CNE-1, CNE-2, Hone-1, C-666, SUNE-1, and 5-8F. No significant correlation between the inhibitory effects of Imatinib, C-KIT overexpression, or C-KIT mutation was found.;C-KIT overexpression and intron mutation were found in NPC cell lines and Imatinib had a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on proliferation for NPC cell lines, yet no significant correlation between C-KIT overexpression, C-KIT mutation, or the inhibitory effect of Imatinib was found.",

Most mutations are in exon 17, although exon 11-activating mutations have recently been described. For patients refractory to standard therapeutic protocols for seminoma, the presence of c-kit-activating mutations in some of these neoplasms might suggest an alternative therapy with KIT targeting drugs. We used the novel mutation scanning technique, high-resolution melting amplicon analysis, to screen a series of 22 testicular seminomas for c-kit-activating mutations. Four cases (18%) had exon 17-activating mutations and these included D816Y, D816V, Y823N and one case that contained both D816E and D820H. A single case (5%) had an exon 11-activating mutation. Interestingly, the exon 11-activating mutation was L576P, the same mutation that characterizes the rare c-kit mutation-positive cases of malignant melanoma. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for c-kit suggested that most seminomas are probably polysomic for c-kit and there was not a significant difference in c-kit FISH characteristics between the mutation-positive and mutation-negative cases. The use of high-resolution melting amplicon analysis as a screening technique will allow for the rapid identification of patients with testicular seminomas whose tumors contain c-kit-activating mutations. This could benefit patients whose tumors are refractory to standard therapeutic protocols.",

Interaction with its ligand, stem cell factor, is essential in the development of hematopoietic stem cells, mast cells, gametocytes, melanocytes, and interstitial cells of Cajal. C-kit expression has been identified in a number of different neoplasms that includes mastocytosis/mast cell leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, seminoma/dysgerminoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. This study examines c-kit expression in uterine endometrial stromal sarcomas, leiomyomas, and leiomyosarcomas using immunohistochemistry.;Archival tissue from 38 patients with the uterine mesenchymal tumors (16 leiomyosarcomas, 8 leiomyomas, 11 low-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas, and 3 high-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas) was stained with polyclonal antibody for c-kit. Modified avidin biotin (ABC) immunoperoxidase method was employed for antibody detection. Individual tumors were considered positive if more than 10% of the cells comprising the neoplasm displayed immunoreactive staining. Staining intensity was graded 1+ to 3+ and distribution graded as focal (10-30% of the cells), intermediate (30-60% of the cells), or diffuse (>60% of the cells).;C-kit was positive in 12 (75%) of the 16 leiomyosarcomas. The staining was 3+ and diffuse in the majority of the positive tumors. C-kit expression was not detected in any of the 8 leiomyomas. Two of the 3 high-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas displayed c-kit positivity. Staining was diffuse and 3+ in both of these tumors. Expression of c-kit was observed in only 3 of the 11 low-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas.;C-kit is expressed in uterine leiomyosarcomas and endometrial stromal sarcomas. Adjunctive diagnostic studies using c-kit may be useful in distinguishing leiomyosarcomas from benign leiomyomas in uterine tumors that offer uncharacteristic features. Furthermore, studies should investigate the prospect of treating these malignant tumors with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.",

A novel missense mutation (D816H) was found in the phosphotransferase domain in tumors of seminoma/dysgerminoma differentiation. The c-kit alleles in nonneoplastic tissues from these patients were wild type, suggesting that the mutant alleles were acquired and selected for during malignant transformation. In cell transfection experiments, the D816H mutant protein was a constitutively activated kinase and was constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine residues.

Substitution of aspartic acid with valine (D816V) renders the receptor independent of ligand for activation and signaling. Wild-type c-Kit is a tyrosine kinase receptor that requires its ligand, stem cell factor (SCF), for activation. Several isoforms of c-Kit exist as a result of alternative mRNA splicing, of which two are characterized by the presence or absence of four amino acids (GNNK- and GNNK+, respectively) in the extracellular domain. The two isoforms show differences in signal transduction and biological activities and the shorter isoform seems to be highly expressed than the longer isoform in human malignancies. In this study we analysed the signal transduction downstream of the oncogenic c-Kit mutant D816V in an isoform specific context, using the hematopoietic cell line Ba/F3 stably transfected with the different versions of isoform and mutant receptor. Our data show that in contrast to the differences shown in the activation of wild-type c-Kit isoforms, both isoforms of c-Kit/D816V are constitutively phosphorylated to the same extent. By the use of Western blot analysis we investigated the activation of different signaling proteins and found that both D816V/GNNK- and D816V/GNNK+ constitutively phosphorylated Gab2, Shc, SHP-2 and Cbl to almost the same extent as c-Kit/GNNK-. In addition, both isoforms of c-Kit/D816V induced SCF-independent cell survival and proliferation equally well. This is in contrast to wild-type c-Kit, where c-Kit/GNNK- induced better cell survival and stronger proliferation than c-Kit/GNNK+, and both required stimulation with SCF. Taken together, these findings reveal that the differences in downstream signal transduction and biological responses between the two GNNK isoforms are eliminated by the D816V mutant.",

Transcript levels of c-kit and the two SCF splicing variants were determined quantitatively by real-time RT-PCR using cDNA obtained from normal, premalignant and malignant snap frozen colon tissue specimens. Immunohistochemistry with specific anti-KIT and anti-SCF antibodies was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue sections in order to localize the relative protein expression in epithelial compartments. Approximately 10% of patients expressed KIT in their adenoma or primary tumor. The majority of KIT-positive carcinomas co-expressed SCF. Real-time RT-PCR showed expression of c-kit and SCF transcripts in all cDNA specimens examined. A significant association between the co-expression of KIT/SCF and a worse clinical outcome was found. In conclusion, KIT expression was observed in a proportion of premalignant and malignant colonic lesions, while it was virtually absent in normal colon mucosa. Moreover, the majority of KIT-positive carcinomas co-expressed SCF, suggesting the possibility of aberrant signaling by an autocrine loop, as confirmed by the negative prognostic value of this association.

SCF immunoreactivity was absent in acinar, ductal, and islet cells of the normal pancreas and faint in pancreatic cancer tissues and cell lines. In contrast, c-kit was clearly present in some normal and hyperplastic ducts of the normal pancreas, in the cancer cells of 73% of the tumor samples, and in all the cell lines tested. Mast cells, identified by tryptase and chymase immunostaining on consecutive tissue sections, showed immunoreactivity for SCF and c-kit in both normal and cancerous specimens and their number was significantly increased (p = 0.03) in pancreatic cancer compared with the normal pancreas. SCF showed a dose-dependent growth inhibitory effect on TAKA-1 cells (p < 0.001), whereas pancreatic cancer cells were resistant to the SCF-induced growth inhibition. Nonetheless, the growth of TAKA-1 cells and pancreatic cancer cells was inhibited by the c-kit tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571.

In RE leukemias, activated forms of the c-KIT tyrosine kinase receptor are frequently found, thereby suggesting oncogenic cooperativity between these oncoproteins in the development and maintenance of t(8;21) malignancies. In this report, we show that activated c-KIT cooperates with a C-terminal truncated variant of RE, REtr, to expand human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors ex vivo. CD34+ cells expressing both oncogenes resemble the AML-M2 myeloblastic cell phenotype, in contrast to REtr-expressing cells which largely undergo granulocytic differentiation. Oncogenic c-KIT amplifies REtr-depended clonogenic growth and protects cells from exhaustion. Activated c-KIT reverts REtr-induced DNA damage and apoptosis. In the presence of activated c-KIT, REtr-downregulated DNA-repair genes are re-expressed leading to an enhancement of DNA-repair efficiency via homologous recombination. Together, our results provide new mechanistic insight into REtr and c-KIT oncogenic cooperativity and suggest that augmented DNA repair accounts for the increased chemoresistance observed in t(8;21)-positive AML patients with activated c-KIT mutations. This cell-protective mechanism might represent a new therapeutic target, as REtr cells with activated c-KIT are highly sensitive to pharmacological inhibitors of DNA repair. ",

Although 31 of the 44 original RET-transgenic mice died of rapidly growing melanoma within 12 months after birth, only 8 of the 44 Wv/Wv-RET-transgenic mice developed slowly growing melanocytic tumors with a greatly prolonged mean tumor-free period, 2 of which died of melanoma at a late stage. Even Wv/+-RET-transgenic mice had a clearly prolonged tumor-free period and definitely reduced frequency (6 of 61) of tumor death within 12 months after birth. Melanin production in the skin of these mice was not strongly impaired, suggesting that c-Kit affects the development of melanomas in these mice with only minor effects in melanin production. c-Kit expression in skin soon after birth was promoted in RET-transgenic mice, and c-Kit was expressed at high levels at the benign but not malignant stage of the tumor. A single injection of anti-c-Kit antibody (ACK2) into RET-transgenic mice soon after birth caused a surprisingly long-lasting suppression of development of melanoma, greatly prolonging the tumor-free period, and none of the 28 ACK2-treated RET-transgenic mice died from tumors at 12 months of age. The c-Kit function needed for melanin production was also suppressed for an unusually long time in ACK2-treated, RET-transgenic mice. These results suggest that c-Kit can be a unique target molecule for melanoma treatment.",

Anorectal malignant melanomas are notorious for their diversity of histologic features and mimic a number of other tumors. Aberrant expression of immunohistochemical stains such as cytokeratins and CD117 (c-kit) further increases the risk of misdiagnosis. Aim of our study was to describe the common as well as unusual architectural and cytologic features that create difficulty in diagnosis. We also discussed the role of immunohistochemical stains in diagnosis of AMMs. We retrieved and reviewed 61 cases of anal melanoma diagnosed in our institution between January 2005 and May 2014. Epithelioid cell type was observed in 57 (93.4%) cases, spindle cells in 35 (57.4%) cases, pleomorphic in 12 (19.7%) cases, and lymphoma-like in 2 (3.3%) cases. Cytoplasmic clearing was observed in 16.4% and nuclear pseudoinclusions in 9.8% cases. Twenty-one point three percent cases were completely amelanotic, and 36.1% showed focal melanin pigment. Average mitotic count was 2 mitoses/high-power fields. Nesting pattern was seen in 24.6%, pseudoalveolar pattern in 11.5%, and peritheliomatous/pseudopapillary pattern in 5% cases. Positive expression of vimentin, S-100, HMB-45, and Melan A was seen in 100%, 100%, 94.4%, and 93.3% cases, respectively. Cytokeratins were positive in 9% and CD117 (c-kit) in 20% of cases in which they were performed. In conclusion, AMMs should be considered in the differential of any malignant tumor of anorectal region without obvious glandular and squamoid differentiation. The knowledge of amelanotic nature, unusual histologic features, and aberrant immunohistochemical expression is helpful in avoiding misdiagnosis. ",

Immunohistochemical studies were performed, using the cell markers CD117 (c-kit), p16 and von Willebrand factor (FVIII). In CD117 three different staining patterns were observed: (1) membranous reaction, (2) intense staining of cytoplasm, and (3) a diffuse, delicate cytoplasmic reaction. Von Willebrand antibody was evaluated on the basis of the number of blood vessels stained. p16 expression was evaluated by scoring positive nuclear reaction. Positive expression was demonstrated for all examined antigens, but their level of expression differed depending on the grades of tumour malignancy. Statistical analysis of the results documented a pronounced positive correlation between the markers studied and the grade of tumour malignancy (P < 0.001). It was shown that each of the cell markers examined represents a useful prognostic indicator for patients with mast cell tumours. The calculated correlation coefficients demonstrate a strong association between the expressions of CD117, FVIII and p16, and the histological malignancy of a tumour. ",

Exons 8, 9, 11, 13 and 17 of c-KIT and exons 12, 14, and 18 of PDGFRA, were amplified from DNA isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples.;Of these seventeen cases, six amplicons of exon 11 of c-KIT showed aberrant bands on gel electrophoresis. Sequencing of these amplicons revealed heterozygous in-frame deletions in six cases. The mutations include two different but overlapping six base pair deletions. Exons 8, 9, 13, and 17 of c-KIT and exons 12, 14, and 18 of PDGFRA had no abnormalities detected by electrophoresis and sequencing did not reveal any mutations, other than synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found in exon 11 of c-KIT and exons 12 and 14 of PDGFRA.;The deletion mutations detected in canine GISTs are similar to those previously found in the juxtamembrane domain of c-KIT in canine cutaneous mast cell tumors in our laboratory as well as to those reported in human GISTs. Interestingly, none of the other c-KIT or PDGFRA exons showed any abnormalities in our cases. This finding underlines the critical importance of c-KIT in the pathophysiology of canine GISTs. The expression of KIT and the identification of these activating mutations in c-KIT implicate KIT in the pathogenesis of these tumors. Our results indicate that mutations in c-KIT may be of prognostic significance and that targeting KIT may be a rational approach to treatment of these malignant tumors. This study further demonstrates that spontaneously occurring canine GISTs share molecular features with human GISTs and are an appropriate model for human GISTs.",

KIT, a class III receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), is frequently involved in tumourigenic processes. Currently, KIT constitutes an attractive therapeutic target. In the present study we assessed the frequency of KIT overexpression in gliomas and investigated the genetic mechanisms underlying KIT overexpression. KIT (CD117) immunohistochemistry was performed in a series of 179 gliomas of various grades. KIT activating gene mutations (exons 9, 11, 13 and 17) and gene amplification analysis, as defined by chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) were performed in CD117 positive cases. Tumour cell immunopositivity was detected in 15.6% (28/179) of cases, namely in 25% (1/4) of pilocytic astrocytomas, 25% (5/20) of diffuse astrocytomas, 20% (1/5) of anaplastic astrocytomas, 19.5% (15/77) of glioblastomas and one third (3/9) of anaplastic oligoastrocytomas. Only 5.7% (2/35) of anaplastic oligodendrogliomas showed CD117 immunoreactivity. No association was found between tumour CD117 overexpression and patient survival. In addition, we also observed CD117 overexpression in endothelial cells, which varied from 0-22.2% of cases, being more frequent in high-grade lesions. No KIT activating mutations were identified. Interestingly, CISH and/or qRT-PCR analysis revealed the presence of KIT gene amplification in 6 glioblastomas and 2 anaplastic oligoastrocytomas, corresponding to 33% (8/24) of CD117 positive cases. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that KIT gene amplification rather than gene mutation is a common genetic mechanism underlying KIT expression in subset of malignant gliomas. Further studies are warranted to determine whether glioma patients exhibiting KIT overexpression and KIT gene amplification may benefit from therapy with anti-KIT RTK inhibitors.",

Some 190 tumours (28·5 per cent) were classified as triple-negative for breast cancer (negative for oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2) and 149 (78·4 per cent) had characteristics of BLBC (positive for cytokeratin 5/6 and/or EGFR). c-Kit expression was detected in 111 (16·6 per cent) of 667 tumours. c-Kit-positive tumours were more commonly found among patients with BLBC (42 of 149, 28·2 per cent; P < 0·001) and in patients with nodal metastasis (47 of 216, 21·8 per cent; P = 0·014) than in those without. In patients with BLBC, the prognosis was significantly worse in those with c-Kit expression (P < 0·001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed c-Kit as an independent negative prognostic factor for cancer-specific survival in patients with BLBC (hazard ratio 2·29, 95 per cent confidence interval 1·11 to 4·72).;c-Kit might be a prognostic marker and possible molecular target for therapy in patients with BLBC.",

This study investigates the presence of SCF and c-kit protein in 32 orchiectomy specimens of patients with testicular cancer, in 5 specimens of normal testicular tissue and in three established non-seminomatous germ-cell cancer cell lines (H12.1, H32, 577ML) by an immunohistochemical approach. Out of 9 testicular cancer specimens classified as pure seminomas, 7 (78%) showed a strong immunohistochemical reaction for both SCF and c-kit protein on the surface of the tumour cells. Fourteen non-seminomatous germ-cell tumours composed of embryonal carcinoma were completely negative for both SCF and c-kit proteins and only faint positivity was found in 6 tumours (26%). Differentiated teratomatous structures within the specimens on non-seminomatous tumours showed a strong immunohistochemical reaction for SCF and c-kit protein in 8 of 11 (73%) cases. All three testicular cancer cell lines showed only faint staining reactions for c-kit protein and none for SCF. No secretion of SCF by the three lines in vitro was detected. The addition of high concentrations of SCF (100 ng/ml) to the testicular cancer cell lines in culture conditions without fetal calf serum resulted in a 1.4 to 3-fold growth stimulation compared to cell growth in serum-free medium alone. This effect was not detectable when the cells were cultured in serum-containing media. In the normal testicular tissue the germ-cells displayed a strong immunohistochemical reaction for c-kit protein while SCF positivity was found at the tubular membrane and on the surface of Sertoli cells. The SCF/c-kit system may possess a regulatory function in normal testicular tissue by possibly providing the microenvironment necessary for spermatogenesis. With the development of testicular cancer, this regulatory system seems to be lost, particularly in non-seminomatous germ-cell tumours. A growth-stimulatory effect of high concentrations of SCF on non-seminomatous testicular cancer cell lines can be detected only in culture conditions with serum-free media. The effects achievable by the combination of SCF with other growth factors need to be further studied, as well as the role of the c-kit/SCF regulatory system for normal spermatogenesis and its possible implications for the understanding and treatment of male infertility.",

This study was designed to evaluate various histological parameters and correlate them with c-kit expression.;The study was done on 40 consecutive cases of renal epithelial tumors. Histological sections were reviewed and reclassified according to WHO (2004) classification and nuclear grade assessed. Hale's colloidal iron stain was done to identify the chromophobe variant. Immunostaining with c-kit was done and its expression was studied. The results were correlated and statistical significance was assessed.;The age range was 31-81 years, with a male to female ratio of 2:1. Seventy per cent of the cases were clear cell RCC (ClRCC), 17.5% were chromophobe type, 7.5% were papillary RCCs and 5% cases were oncocytomas. Fuhrman nuclear grading revealed 60.5% cases to be of low grade and 39.5% high grade. Hale's colloidal iron staining was positive in chromophobe RCC and oncocytomas, while it was negative in ClRCC. Immunostaining with c-kit was positive only in oncocytomas.;Clear cell RCC was the most common histological subtype of RCC. Clear cell RCC known to have a poor prognosis, showed a statistically significant higher nuclear grade than chromophobe and papillary RCCs which have a better prognosis. Hale's colloidal iron staining was extremely useful in distinguishing chromophobe RCC and oncocytoma from the granular cell variant of clear RCC. Our study revealed c-kit negativity in all RCC.

The mutant c-Kit receptor confers cytokine-independent survival of leukemia cells and induces tumorigenicity. Changes in the signal transduction pathways responsible for Asp(816) mutant c-Kit-mediated biologic effects are largely undefined. The results of this study show that Asp(816) mutant c-Kit induces constitutive activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and STAT1, and up-regulates STAT3 downstream targets, Bcl-x(L) and c-myc. The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI-3K)/Akt pathway, but not the Ras-mediated mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, is also constitutively activated by Asp(816) mutant c-Kit. Suppression of STAT3 activation by a dominant negative molecule in MO7e leukemia cells transduced with mutant c-kit inhibits stem cell factor (SCF)-independent survival and proliferation, accompanied by the down-regulation of Bcl-x(L) and c-myc. However, activated STAT3 does not appear to be the sole mediator that is responsible for the phenotypic changes induced by Asp(816) mutant c-Kit, because expression of constitutively activated STAT3 in MO7e cells does not completely reconstitute cytokine independence. Activation of other signaling components by mutant c-Kit, such as those in the PI-3K/Akt pathway, is demonstrated and may also be needed for the mutant c-Kit-mediated biologic effects. The investigation of altered signal transduction pathways and the resulting functional consequences mediated by Asp(816) mutant c-Kit should provide important information for the characterization of subsets of leukemia and potential molecular pathways for therapeutic targeting.

Oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization has been applied for cataloging genomic copy number alterations (CNAs) in 17 frozen salivary or bronchial tumors. Only four whole chromosome CNAs were found, and most cases had 2-4 segmental CNAs. No high level amplification was observed. There were recurrent gains at 7p15.2, 17q21-25, and 22q11-13, and recurrent losses at 1p35, 6q22-25, 8q12-13, 9p21, 12q12-13, and 17p11-13. The minimal region of gain at 7p15.2 contained the HOXA cluster. The minimal common regions of deletions contained the CDKN2A/CDKN2B, TP53, and LIMA1 tumor suppressor genes. The recurrent deletion at 8q12.3-13.1 contained no straightforward tumor suppressor gene, but the MIRN124A2 microRNA gene, whose product regulates MMP2 and CDK6. Among unique CNAs, gains harbored CCND1, KIT/PDGFRA/KDR, MDM2, and JAK2. The CNAs involving CCND1, MDM2, KIT, CDKN2A/2B, and TP53 were validated by FISH and/or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Although most tumors overexpressed cyclin D1 compared with surrounding glands, the only case to overexpress MDM2 had the corresponding CNA. In conclusion, our report suggests that ACC is characterized by a relatively low level of structural complexity. Array CGH and immunohistochemical data implicate MDM2 as the oncogene targeted at 12q15. The gain at 4q12 warrants further exploration as it contains a cluster of receptor kinase genes (KIT/PDGFRA/KDR), whose products can be responsive to specific therapies.",

In breast cancer, studies using different methodologies have shown conflicting results. In the present study we analyzed c-kit and SCF in 14 normal mammary epithelia samples, in 16 in situ and in 75 invasive breast cancers. The expression of c-kit and SCF protein was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and mRNA expression was evaluated by in situ hybridization and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The different methodologies gave somewhat different results. Using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, protein and mRNA expression of c-kit and SCF were high in normal mammary gland, significantly lower in in situ and almost completely undetectable in invasive breast cancer. Conversely, using RT-PCR, mRNA expression was observed in normal tissue and in all pathologic lesions of mammary gland, probably due to the high sensitivity of the methodology or to the positivity of elements other than tumor cells expressing the receptor and/or its ligand. These results suggest that the c-kit/SCF pathway plays an important role in the maintenance of normal growth of mammary epithelium and that the process of malignant transformation is accompanied by their progressive loss. Furthermore, we demonstrated that different results are attributable to different methodologies and that morphologic approaches are the most reliable for defining the cellular source of c-kit or SCF expression.",

Studies in glioma cell lines as well as different tumor types suggest the possibility of intracellular interactions of c-kit with SCF. Although c-kit and SCF may not play a primary and causal role in the initiation and progression of glial tumors they may still be contributing factors in glioma biology. It can be hypothesized that the parallel activation of several autocrine systems including some of which have found less attention in gliomas, such as c-kit/SCF, could compromise the efficacy of therapies targeting different autocrine loops.

We also carried out genetic analysis of the tumors in three of the four cases. In all cases, the immunoreactivity profiles, including KIT (CD117), CD34, smooth muscle actin (SMA), desmin, S-100 and vimentin, were similar between the gastric and metastatic tumors, but the Ki67 labeling index in the metastatic GIST was higher than that of the primary GIST. Interestingly, in the case who had received neoadjuvant imatinib therapy before gastrectomy, its therapeutic effect was observed in most of the primary lesion, with the exception of a specific small area with high cellularity. Genetic analysis revealed no acquired mutations in the c-kit or PDGFRA genes in the metastatic lesions in any of the patients, but loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the c-kit gene was observed mainly in the metastatic tumors in two of the three cases. Furthermore, in the case of neoadjuvant imatinib therapy, LOH of the c-kit gene was shown in the high cellularity area in the primary lesion and metastatic liver GIST.

Mutations in murine c-kit that reduce the receptor tyrosine kinase activity cause deficiencies in the migration and proliferation of melanoblasts, hematopoietic stem cells, and primordial germ cells. We therefore investigated whether c-Kit regulates normal human melanocyte proliferation and plays a role in melanomas. We show that normal human melanocytes respond to mast cell growth factor (MGF), the Kit-ligand that stimulates phosphorylation of tyrosyl residues in c-Kit and induces sequential phosphorylation of tyrosyl residues in several other proteins. One of the phosphorylated intermediates in the signal transduction pathway was identified as an early response kinase (mitogen-activated protein [MAP] kinase). Dephosphorylation of a prominent 180-kDa protein suggests that MGF also activates a phosphotyrosine phosphatase. In contrast, MGF did not induce proliferation, the cascade of protein phosphorylations, or MAP kinase activation in the majority of cells cultured from primary nodular and metastatic melanomas that grow independently of exogenous factors. In the five out of eight human melanoma lines expressing c-kit mRNAs, c-Kit was not constitutively activated. Therefore, although c-Kit-kinase is a potent growth regulator of normal human melanocytes, its activity is not positively associated with malignant transformation.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Stem cell factor (SCF) and its receptor, c-Kit, constitute an important signal transduction system with proliferative and anti-apoptotic functions. Besides regulating hemopoietic stem cell proliferation and liver regeneration, it has been implicated in the regulation of human malignancies. However, the cellular expression of the SCF-c-Kit gene system in the liver during cholangiocarcinogenesis has not been studied to date. The protein- and mRNA-expression levels of SCF and c-Kit genes were examined in normal rat liver, in isolated normal rat liver cells and in a thioacetamide-induced rat model of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (CC). Immunohistochemical analysis of the normal liver showed that SCF is expressed in the wall of the hepatic artery and in some cells, which were located along the sinusoids, although it was absent from hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells. The mRNA analysis of isolated normal liver cell populations revealed a co-expression of SCF- and c-Kit-mRNA in sinusoidal endothelial cells and in Kupffer cells, whereas passaged and cultured liver myofibroblasts (MFs) expressed only SCF. Low levels of the SCF- and c-Kit-mRNA expression could be detected in isolated hepatocytes of the normal liver. Immunohistochemical analysis of the CC tissue showed SCF positivity in proliferating biliary cells (CK-19(+)), in macrophages (ED-1(+)) and in MFs (alpha-smooth-muscle-actin, alpha-SMA(+)) of the tumoral microenvironment. c-Kit-positivity could be detected on hepatocytes of the regenerating nodules and on the proliferating bile ducts of CC. Compared with the normal liver tissue, SCF-mRNA from the CC tissue was upregulated up to 20-fold, whereas c-Kit-mRNA was upregulated up to fivefold. These data indicate that several cell populations may become able to express SCF and/or c-Kit during cholangiocarcinogenesis. Therefore, the SCF-c-Kit system may contribute to tumor development, for instance, by inducing proliferation of hepatocytes and of biliary cells and by acting as a surviving factor for CC cells.",

These tumors are histological variants of glioblastoma, displaying a similar genetic profile and dismal prognosis. Up-regulation of PDGFR subfamily of tyrosine kinase members, PDGFR-alpha and c-Kit, and their intracellular effectors RAS/RAF/MAPK has a crucial role in the cancer development. In addition, signal transduction mediated by activating mutations of c-Kit and PDGFR can be effectively blocked by specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as Imatinib mesylate. The aim of this study was to characterize the molecular alterations of PDGFR signaling in gliosarcomas. Six cases were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for the expression of PDGFR-alpha, c-Kit and their ligands PDGF-A and SCF, respectively. The cases were further evaluated for the presence of activating mutations of PDGFR-alpha (exons 12 and 18) and c-kit (exons 9, 11, 13, and 17), as well as B-RAF (exons 11 and 15). Expression of PDGF-A was found in all cases and co-expression of PDGFR-alpha was observed in three cases. Four cases showed expression of SCF, and c-Kit was observed only in one case that also expressed SCF. Generally, immunoreaction predominates in the glial component. The mutational analysis of PDGFR-alpha showed the presence of an IVS17-50insT intronic insertion in two cases, one of them also with a 2472C > T silent mutation; this silent mutation was also found in another case. Glioma cell line analysis of IVS17-50insT insertion showed no influence on PDGFR-alpha gene splicing. No mutations were detected in c-kit and B-RAF oncogenes. Our results indicate that activating mutations of PDGFR-alpha, c-kit and B-RAF are absent in gliosarcomas. Nevertheless, the presence of a PDGFR-a/PDGFA and c-Kit/SCF autocrine/paracrine stimulation loop in a proportion of cases, supports the potential role of specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the treatment of gliosarcomas.",

Cancer stem/progenitor cells (or tumor-initiating cells, TICs) are hypothesized to be chemoresistant, and the existence of TICs in ovarian cancer has been previously demonstrated. However, the key signals and molecular events regulating the formation and expansion of ovarian tumor-initiating cells (OTICs) remain elusive. Here, we show that c-Kit is not just a marker of OTICs, but also a critical mediator of the phenotype that can be a viable target for the treatment of ovarian cancer. In contrast to non-OICs, c-Kit was overexpressed in OTICs. Moreover, the use of small interfering RNA to inhibit c-Kit expression markedly attenuated the number and size of OTIC subpopulations, inhibited the expression of stem cell markers and decreased the tumorigenic capabilities of OTICs. Imatinib (Gleevec), a clinical drug that blocks c-Kit kinase activity, also demonstrated its inhibition potency on OTICs. In addition, cisplatin/paclitaxel, which killed non-OTICs, with c-Kit knockdown or imatinib revealed that this was critically required for intervening ovarian cancer progression and recurrence in vitro and in xenograft tumors in vivo. Similar results were obtained with OTICs derived from ovarian carcinoma patients. Studies into the mechanisms suggest an important role for the activation of Wnt/β-catenin and ATP-binding cassette G2 downstream of c-Kit. The tumor-promoting microenvironment, such as hypoxia, could promote OTICs via upregulation of c-Kit expression. These results unravel an integral role for c-Kit in ovarian neoplastic processes and shed light on its mechanisms of action.",

To better understand the regulation of the c-kit gene, a detailed analysis of the core promoter was performed. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and RNase protection methods showed two major transcriptional initiation sites. Luciferase reporter assays using 5' promoter deletion-reporter constructs containing up to 3 kb of 5' sequence were performed in hematopoietic and small-cell lung cancer cell lines which either did or did not express the endogenous c-kit gene. This analysis showed the region 83 to 124 bp upstream of the 5' transcription initiation site was crucial for maximal core promoter activity. Sequence analysis showed several potential Sp1 binding sites within this highly GC-rich region. Gel shift and DNase footprinting showed that Sp1 selectively bound to a single site within this region. Supershift studies using an anti-Sp1 antibody confirmed specific Sp1 binding. Site-directed mutagenesis of the -93/-84 Sp1 binding site reduced promoter-reporter activity to basal levels in c-kit-expressing cells. Cotransfection into Drosophila SL2 cells of a c-kit promoter-reporter construct with an Sp1 expression vector showed an Sp1 dose-dependent enhancement of expression that was markedly attenuated by mutation of the -93/-84 site. These results indicate that despite the fact that the human c-kit promoter contains multiple potential Sp1 sites, Sp1 binding is a selective process that is essential for core promoter activity.",

Development of multiple nodules and potential visceral involvement, along with inconsistency of conventional prognostic aids, justify uncertainty in differentiating benign from malignant forms. c-Kit proto-oncogene activating mutations have been reported in feline mast cell tumors (MCTs), but their prognostic relevance was not investigated. This study was performed on FeCMCTs with variable clinical outcome to assess whether Kit cytoplasmic immunohistochemical labeling can be regarded as indicative of c-Kit mutations and to evaluate the relationship between Kit dysregulation and survival. Twenty-four cats diagnosed with a primary cutaneous MCT were enrolled. Kit immunohistochemical pattern and c-Kit (exons 8, 9, 11) mutational status were assessed in 34 tumor samples. Risk factors affecting survival were a number of mitoses greater than 5 per 10 HPFs (P = .017) and cytoplasmic Kit labeling (P = .045). Increased mitotic activity was associated with Kit cytoplasmic expression (P = .01). c-Kit encoding mutations were present in 19 (56%) tumors (exon 8, 19%; exon 9, 71%; exon 11, 10%), however, they were not significantly related to protein expression and they had no influence on prognosis. Additionally, in 6 of 9 (67%) cats, multiple nodules from the same cat had different mutational statuses. Mutations in the fifth immunoglobulin-like domain of Kit occur frequently in FeCMCT, but they are variably associated with aberrant protein expression and do not appear to be strictly correlated with biological behavior. These findings need to be confirmed in larger series, and exploration of further genomic regions of c-Kit is warranted. ",

The tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 (IMATINIB MESYLATE; GLEEVEC; GLIVEC) is a case in point as it has shown promise in the treatment of malignancies expressing the BCR/ABL fusion protein. In addition to BCR/ABL, STI571 inhibits the tyrosine kinase moieties of several cell surface receptors including the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors and c-Kit. Previous work demonstrated that c-Kit activation supports migration, invasion and, survival of certain colorectal carcinoma cells including DLD-1. Here we describe that blocking c-Kit with STI571 inhibits these malignant traits not only in DLD-1 cells but also in two early passage colorectal carcinoma cell strains. Specifically, STI571 inhibited anchorage-independent colony formation and cell scattering in semi-solid medium. Furthermore, it enhanced apoptosis susceptibility and abrogated invasion of DLD-1 cells through Matrigel. In addition, STI571 treatment affected the balance of the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis regulators on favor of a pro-apoptotic phenotype. Specifically, STI571 treatment of DLD-1 cells was associated with lower levels of Bcl-2 expression accompanied by de novo expression of Bcl-xS. Finally, STI571 acted as a chemosensitizing agent in DLD-1 cells when used in combination with 5-fluorouracil.",

HER-2/neu overexpression was measured in these patients by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using the Hercep test developed by DAKO. VEGF expression was detected by the avidin-biotin-complex method using Santa Cruz biotechnology (SC 7629). Immunohistochemical staining for c-kit was performed using a 1:250 dilution of the rabbit polyclonal antibody A4502 (IMPATH, CA) with the EnVision detection system.;Two hundred and seventy three patients were diagnosed as having STS between 1986 and 2001, however of these patients, only 90 (51 females and 49 males) had enough sample available for testing. Patients who overexpressed VEGF had a significantly shorter survival (23 vs. 52 months; p=0.01). There was no effect of overexpression of either CD117 or HER-2/neu on survival. Studying the individual histological subtypes we found that, in malignant fibrous histiocytoma, overexpression of either VEGF or CD117 increased survival (41.3 vs. 19.5 months, p=0.01; and 84.5 vs. 17 months, p=0.006 respectively). In leiomyosarcoma, VEGF overexpression significantly decreased survival (7.5 vs. 76 months, p=0.03), while CD117 overexpression significantly increased survival (70.9 vs. 46.3 months, p=0.03).;VEGF overexpression is associated with an adverse outcome in STS. Whether this is true of any particular histological subtype is unclear and needs further investigation. Also, site-specific agents targeting these three bio-markers (alone or with conventional therapy) may have a therapeutic role and need to be elaborated in future clinical trials.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Testicular germ cell tumours (TGCTs) are the most frequent cancer type in young men; 5% of these patients develop a second TGCT in the contralateral testis. The pathogenesis of TGCT is closely linked to primordial germ cells (PGCs) or gonocytes. The receptor tyrosine kinase (c-KIT) is necessary for migration and survival of PGCs and is expressed in intratubular neoplastic germ cells (IGCNUs) and seminomas. We studied the frequency of c-KIT exon 11 and 17 mutations in 155 unilateral (108 seminomas and 47 non-seminomas) and 22 bilateral (18 seminomas, two embryonal carcinomas, two IGCNU) cases. While no mutations were detected in exon 11, the mutation frequency in exon 17 was significantly higher in bilateral (14/22, 63.6%) compared to unilateral TGCT (10/155, 6.4%) (p < 0.001). Different activating mutations (Y823D, D816V, D816H and N822K) were detected in bilateral TGCT. Y823D mutation was identical in both testes in three cases and quantitative pyrosequencing showed that up to 76% of the cells analysed in tumour samples carried this mutation. One bilateral synchronous seminoma revealed a S821F mutation in one testis and a Y823D mutation contralaterally. To study the role of c-KIT in TGCT progression, we compared its expression in 41 seminomas and adjacent IGCNUs. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that c-KIT expression was significantly reduced in seminomas compared to IGCNUs (p < 0.006) and that there were no significant changes in c-KIT mRNA copy numbers in progressed compared to low-stage seminomas. In summary, our study shows that patients with c-KIT mutations are more prone to develop a bilateral TGCT and suggests that in a portion of bilateral TGCTs, c-KIT mutations occur early during embryonal development, prior to the arrival of PGCs at the genital ridge. Furthermore, our findings show that c-KIT down-regulation occurs during the progression of IGCNU to seminoma.",

Previously, we showed that chemotherapy of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells lines can select for outgrowth of highly tumorigenic and metastatic CSCs. The high malignancy of lung CSCs was associated with an efficient cytokine network. In this study, we provide evidence that blocking stem cell factor (SCF)-c-kit signaling is sufficient to inhibit CSC proliferation and survival promoted by chemotherapy. CSCs were isolated from NSCLC cell lines as tumor spheres under CSC-selective conditions and their stem properties were confirmed. In contrast to other tumor cells, CSCs expressed c-kit receptors and produced SCF. Proliferation of CSCs was inhibited by SCF-neutralizing antibodies or by imatinib (Gleevec), an inhibitor of c-kit. Although cisplatin treatment eliminated the majority of tumor cells, it did not eliminate CSCs, whereas imatinib or anti-SCF antibody destroyed CSCs. Significantly, combining cisplatin with imatinib or anti-SCF antibody prevented the growth of both tumor cell subpopulations. Our findings reveal an important role for the SCF-c-kit signaling axis in self-renewal and proliferation of lung CSCs, and they suggest that SCF-c-kit signaling blockade could improve the antitumor efficacy of chemotherapy of human NSCLC.",

Columnar cell lesions can be seen intimately associated with PASH-like-stroma, a lesion we termed as CCPLS. Our aim is to investigate epithelial-stromal interactions in CCPLS and compare them to PASH without columnar cell lesions in breast core needle biopsies. Normal terminal duct lobular unit (TDLU) epithelium was seen in association with columnar cell lesions as well as PASH. Eight (8) cases of each category were examined by a panel of immunostains: CD117 (C-kit), CD34, CD105, bFGF, AR, ER-beta, MIB-1. We observed a markedly decreased expression of c-kit in columnar cell lesions compared to TDLU-epithelium. CD105 showed a quantitative increase in activated vessels in CCPLS compared to PASH. A subset of CCPLS and PASH were androgen receptor positive. A strong nuclear positivity for ER-beta is observed in the epithelium and stroma of all CCPLS cases. We conclude that (1) activated blood vessels predominate in CCPLS; (2) A molecular alteration is signified by c-kit loss in columnar cell lesions; (3) ER-beta and androgen receptor positivity indicate CCPLS are hormonally responsive lesions.

We collected 170 melanocytic lesions, including 106 cutaneous MM from acral melanoma (AM) and nonacral melanoma (NAM) sites, 24 dysplastic nevi, and 40 common melanocytic nevi.

In addition, cytoplasmic c-kit staining was significantly correlated with poor survival in patients with AM but not in those with NAM. Twenty-nine cases of MM (including 9 NAM and 20 AM) are analyzed for mutation in exons 11, 13, 17, and 18 of KIT gene in genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction sequencing, and no genetic mutation is found.

Gain-of-function mutations in c-Kit have been described in a number of human cancers, including testicular germinomas, acute myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Yet their contribution to neoplastic growth is incompletely understood. Now Kosmider et al report the acquisition of Kit mutations in 86% of late-stage eryhtroleukemias in Spi-1/PU.1 transgenic mice. Without Kit mutations, these mice suffer from a benign disease whose hallmark is erythropoietin-dependent expansion of undifferentiated red blood cell precursors. Newly acquired Kit mutations affect codon 814 or 818, and ectopic expression of these mutants in nonmalignant pro-erythroblasts confers erythropoietin independence and tumorigenicity. Using tyrosine kinase inhibitors PP1, PP2, and imatinib mesylate (a.k.a. Gleevac), the authors demonstrate that Kit mutations are important for the autonomous expansion of malignant cells via the MEK/Erk1/2 and PI3K/Akt pathways.

Using monoclonal antibodies (MAb(s)) to the extracellular domain, we have evaluated the expression of c-kit in normal and transformed melanocytes. This cell lineage synthesizes a receptor with a mw of 145 kDa. The gene product is expressed in epidermal melanocytes and in a fraction of nevocytic and blue nevi. In primary melanomas, loss of the receptor is observed in more invasive lesions. Only 30% of the metastatic lesions express detectable levels of the receptor. These findings demonstrate that the c-kit product is down-regulated in melanocytes following malignant transformation. The functional relevance of this modulation remains to be evaluated.",

OSSN ranges from mild, moderate, severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ (CIS) to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Recent findings on cancer stem cells theory indicate that population of stem-like cell as in neoplasia determines its heterogeneity and complexity leading to varying tumor development of metastatic behavior and recurrence. Cancer stem cell markers are not much explored in the cases of OSSN. In the present study, we aim to evaluate the expression of stem cells using stem cell markers mainly p63, ABCG2, c-KIT (CD117) and CD44 in OSSN tissue, which could have prognostic significance. The present study tries for the first time to explore expression of these stem markers in the cases of OSSN. These cases are subdivided into two groups. One group comprises of carcinoma in situ (n = 6) and the second group comprises of invasive carcinoma (n = 6). The mean age at presentation was 52 years; with 53 years for CIS group and 52 years for SCC group. From each group section from the paraffin block were taken for the IHC staining of p63, c-Kit, ABCG2 and CD44. Our experiments show high expression of P63 and CD44 in the cases of CIN and SCC. Both CIS and SCC displayed positive staining with p63, with more than 80% cells staining positive. However minimal expression of c-kit in both CIN and SCC. But surprisingly we got high expression of ABCG2 in cases of carcinoma in situ as compared to that of invasive squamous cell carcinoma. More than 50% of cells showed CD44 positivity in both CIS and SCC groups. Our results show for the first time that these four stem cells especially the limbal epithelium stem cells play a vital role in the genesis of OSSN but we need to explore more cases before establishing its clinical and biological significance.

KIT plays a critical role in cell proliferation and differentiation and represents a logical therapeutic target in GIST and CML. In pancreatic cancer, c-kit expression has been observed by immunohistochemical techniques. In this study, we examined the influence of c-kit expression on proliferation and invasion using five pancreatic cancer cell lines. In addition, the inhibitory effect of imatinib mesylate on stem cell factor (SCF)-induced proliferation and invasion was evaluated. Finally, we also analyzed KIT and SCF expression in pancreatic cancer tissues using immunohistochemistry and correlated the results with clinical features.;RT-PCR revealed that two pancreatic cancer cell lines, PANC-1 and SW1990, expressed c-kit mRNA. By Western blot analysis, c-kit protein was also present in those lines. In KIT-positive pancreatic cancer cell lines, proliferation and invasion were significantly enhanced by addition of SCF. In contrast, SCF did not enhance proliferation and invasion in the three KIT-negative lines (BxPC-3, Capan-2 and MIA PaCa-2). 5 muM imatinib mesylate significantly inhibited SCF-enhanced proliferation to the same extent compared with the control. Similarly, SCF-enhanced invasive ability was significantly inhibited by 5 muM imatinib mesylate. KIT was expressed in 16 of 42 clinical specimens by immunohistochemistry, and KIT expression was significantly related to venous system invasion. Furthermore, patients expressing both KIT and SCF had a somewhat lower survival.;Our results demonstrated that the SCF-KIT pathway enhanced the proliferation and invasiveness in KIT-positive pancreatic cancer cell lines and that the enhanced proliferation and invasion were inhibited by imatinib mesylate. We propose that inhibitors of c-kit tyrosine kinase receptor have the potential to slow the progression of KIT-positive pancreatic cancers.",

DSD patients with specific Y-sequences have an increased risk for Type II Germ Cell Tumor/Cancer, with gonadoblastoma as precursor progressing to dysgerminoma. Here we present analysis of c-KIT exon 8, 9, 11, 13 and 17, and PDGFRA exon 12, 14 and 18 by conventional sequencing together with mutational analysis of c-KIT codon 816 by a sensitive and specific LightCycler melting curve analysis, confirmed by sequencing. The results are combined with data on TSPY and OCT3/4 expression in a series of 16 DSD patients presenting with gonadoblastoma and dysgerminoma and 15 patients presenting pure ovarian dysgerminomas without DSD. c-KIT codon 816 mutations were detected in five out of the total of 31 cases (all found in pure ovarian dysgerminomas). A synonymous SNP (rs 5578615) was detected in two patients, one DSD patient (with bilateral disease) and one patient with dysgerminoma. Next to these, three codon N822K mutations were detected in the group of 15 pure ovarian dysgerminomas. In total activating c-KIT mutations were found in 53% of ovarian dysgerminomas without DSD. In the group of 16 DSD cases a N505I and D820E mutation was found in a single tumor of a patient with gonadoblastoma and dysgerminoma. No PDGFRA mutations were found. Positive OCT3/4 staining was present in all gonadoblastomas and dysgerminomas investigated, TSPY expression was only seen in the gonadoblastoma/dysgerminoma lesions of the 16 DSD patients.

By retroviral infection of hematopoietic progenitor cells with KIT(G559) or KIT(V814), KIT(G559) induced development of granulocyte/macrophage and mast-cell colonies in vitro without the addition of exogenous growth factors. KIT(V814) induced factor-independent growth of various types of hematopoietic progenitor cells, resulting in the development of mixed erythroid/myeloid colonies in addition to granulocyte/macrophage and mast-cell colonies. Furthermore, transplantation of KIT(G559) and KIT(V814)-infected bone marrow cells led to development of acute leukemia in one of 10 and six of 10 transplanted mice, respectively. No mice developed hematologic malignancies after transplantation of wild-type KIT-infected cells. Furthermore, transgenic mice expressing KIT(V814) developed acute leukemia or malignant lymphoma.

The aim of this study was to determine whether epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) immunoreactivity correlated with outcomes and to identify new biologic markers for potential targeted therapy. Three markers, EGFR, C-kit, and Her2/neu, were selected for evaluation in patients with advanced thymic epithelial tumors treated on E1C97.;Of the 42 patients entered onto E1C97, 34 patients (World Health Organization [WHO] categories: type A = 1, type AB = 1, type B1 = 10, type B2 = 11 type B3 = 8, and type C = 3) had sufficient tissue available for immunohistologic study. Each tumor was assessed to have 0, 1+, 2+, or 3+ immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm or membranes of the neoplastic cells for Her2/neu and EGFR and for the presence or absence of C-kit immunoreactivity.;EGFR immunoreactivity of 2+ or 3+ was associated with more aggressive thymic tumors (WHO types B2 and B3). However, strong EGFR immunoreactivity was not consistently seen with thymic carcinoma. The presence of EGFR within cells was associated with a significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) and a trend for overall survival (OS). Twelve patients demonstrated C-kit immunoreactivity; the lack of C-kit immunoreactivity was significantly associated with superior PFS but not OS. Her2/neu immunoreactivity was uniformly negative for all tumors evaluated. There was no association between response and biomarker status.;High EGFR immunoreactivity is seen in more aggressive thymic neoplasms as classified according to the 2004 WHO, but regardless of classification, the presence of EGFR in tumor cells (1+, 2+, and 3+) is associated with improved performance free survival (PFS) and a trend for better OS. In contrast, the absence of C-kit immunoreactivity was associated with improved PFS.

These effects are performed by activation of the SCF receptor, c-kit. Because of the potential use of SCF in patients undergoing chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation, the effect of SCF on nonhematopoietic tumors requires investigation. To determine whether human tumor cell lines display c-kit receptors, we performed binding experiments with 125I-SCF on a breast carcinoma cell line (Du4475), a gastric carcinoma cell line (KATO III), a melanoma cell line (HTT144), as well as two small cell lung carcinoma cell lines (H69 and H128). The biologic effect of SCF on tumor cell lines was assessed by its ability to stimulate tritiated thymidine uptake and to enhance colony growth in methylcellulose. The breast carcinoma cell line, Du4475, as well as two small cell lung carcinoma cell lines, H69 and H128, exhibit high-affinity c-kit receptors with approximate binding affinities of 40, 100, and 90 pmol/L, respectively. The number of high-affinity receptors per cell ranged from 700 to 9,500. The gastric carcinoma cell line, as well as the melanoma cell line, showed trace binding of 125I-SCF. In the presence of SCF alone, or in combination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or interleukin-3, there was less than a 17% increase in the colony growth of Du4475, H69, or H128 cell lines. Postulating that the lack of growth response could be secondary to endogenous SCF production by the tumor cell lines, we used an RNAse protection assay to determine whether the tumor cell lines contain SCF messenger RNA (mRNA). In addition, we tested tumor cell line supernatants for the presence of secreted SCF protein by enzyme immunoassay, and analyzed the tumor cell lines for membrane-bound SCF by indirect immunofluorescence. Our results show that the Du4475, H69, and H128 cell lines, as well as a melanoma cell line (HTT144), have multiple copies of SCF mRNA. Soluble SCF protein was detected in the cell supernatants in the Du4475 and H69 cell lines and SCF was found on the surface of all four cell lines. These data show that some human solid tumor cell lines display high-affinity c-kit receptors and produce SCF, which can be detected on the cell surface. These results suggest the possibility that autocrine production of SCF by c-kit receptor-bearing tumor cells may enhance cell growth in tumor cell lines.",

In the present report, we analyzed the c-kit nucleotide sequence in the case of a cat that showed systemic mastocytosis and mastocytemia. Within the c-kit cDNA prepared from the malignant mast cells, we identified an 12-bp internal tandem duplication at the region corresponding to exon 8, resulting in a four amino acid insertion between residues Thr418 and His419 within the fifth immunoglobulin-like domain of KIT. The cat underwent therapy with the kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) at a dose of 10mg/kg. The tumor masses greatly responded and were undetectable after 5 weeks of treatment. Correspondingly, the number of mast cells in the peripheral blood was markedly reduced. It is, therefore, considered that the internal tandem duplication within the domain contributes to the neoplastic transformation of mast cells in the cat by increasing KIT phosphorylation.",

ITGCN cells are characterized, among others, by the presence of stem cell factor receptor c-KIT. Once established, ITGCN will always progress to invasiveness. Approximately 2.5-5% of patients with a TGCT will develop bilateral disease and require complete castration, resulting in infertility, a need for lifelong androgen replacement, and psychological stress. To date, the only way to predict a contralateral tumor is surgical biopsy of the contralateral testis to demonstrate ITGCN. We did a retrospective study of 224 unilateral and 61 proven bilateral TGCTs (from 46 patients, in three independently collected series in Europe) for the presence of activating c-KIT codon 816 mutations. A c-KIT codon 816 mutation was found in three unilateral TGCT (1.3%), and in 57 bilateral TGCTs (93%; P < 0.0001). In the two wild-type bilateral tumors for which ITGCN was available, the preinvasive cells contained the mutation. The mutations were somatic in origin and identical in both tumors. We conclude that somatic activating codon 816 c-KIT mutations are associated with development of bilateral TGCT. Detection of c-KIT codon 816 mutations in unilateral TGCT identifies patients at risk for bilateral disease. These patients may undergo tailored treatment to prevent the development of bilateral disease, with retention of testicular hormonal function.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Signal transduction in response to growth factors is a strictly controlled process with networks of feedback systems, highly selective interactions and finely tuned on-and-off switches. In the context of cancer, detailed signaling studies have resulted in the development of some of the most frequently used means of therapy, with several well established examples such as the small molecule inhibitors imatinib and dasatinib in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. Impaired function of receptor tyrosine kinases is implicated in various types of tumors, and much effort is put into mapping the many interactions and downstream pathways. Here we discuss the hematopoietic growth factor receptors c-Kit and Flt3 and their downstream signaling in normal as well as malignant cells. Both receptors are members of the same family of tyrosine kinases and crucial mediators of stem-and progenitor-cell proliferation and survival in response to ligand stimuli from the surrounding microenvironment. Gain-of-function mutations/alterations render the receptors constitutively and ligand-independently activated, resulting in aberrant signaling which is a crucial driving force in tumorigenesis. Frequently found mutations in c-Kit and Flt3 are point mutations of aspartic acid 816 and 835 respectively, in the activation loop of the kinase domains. Several other point mutations have been identified, but in the case of Flt3, the most common alterations are internal tandem duplications (ITDs) in the juxtamembrane region, reported in approximately 30% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). During the last couple of years, the increasing understanding of c-Kit and Flt3 signaling has also revealed the complexity of these receptor systems. The impact of gain-of-function mutations of c-Kit and Flt3 in different malignancies is well established and shown to be of clinical relevance in both prognosis and therapy. Many inhibitors of both c-Kit or Flt3 or of their downstream substrates are in clinical trials with encouraging results, and targeted therapy using a combination of such inhibitors is considered a promising approach for future treatments.",

In particular, we analysed the expression of c-kit and its ligand stem cell factor (SCF) in a panel of HD-derived cell lines and fibroblasts from HD-involved lymph nodes (HDF). While c-kit was expressed by HD-derived cell lines, usually in the absence of SCF, this latter molecule, in its soluble and/or membrane-bound (mb) form, was in turn expressed at a high level by primary HDF. In vitro adhesion between HD-derived cell lines and HDF was mainly mediated by c-kit/SCF interactions, and this phenomenon was significantly inhibited by an excess of soluble SCF or by neutralizing anti-c-kit monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, both soluble and mb-SCF increased growth and colony survival of HD-derived cell lines; these effects were significantly enhanced upon co-stimulation of H-RS cells with interleukin 9. Finally, soluble SCF was able to partially rescue H-RS cells from apoptosis induced by serum starvation. Taken together, our data indicated the expression of functional c-kit receptor by H-RS cells and suggests a role of SCF in the pathobiology of cHD.",

Based on their different biological characteristics and their origin, five types of GCT are classified. Among these, malignant seminomatous and non-seminomatous GCT in males and females are designated as type II GCT. They occur most frequently as malignant testicular GCTs. Many characteristics of type II GCT can be linked to embryonic stem cells. Intratubular germ cell neoplasia, unclassified (IGCNU) is the precursor of type II GCT and derives from undifferentiated germ cells, gonocytes, which persist in the newborn testis and escape the normal differentiation process. It is suggested that Exon-17-activated mutations of the receptor tyrosine kinase, c-KIT, occur early in germ cell development and that gonocytes with an activated c-KIT receptor are restricted in their differentiation, thereby escaping normal development. New diagnostic markers for neoplastic germ cells, including OCT3/4 and AP-2gamma, are specifically detected in IGCNU, seminomas and embryonal carcinomas and are helpful in the differentiation of type II GCT from other malignant tumors.",

These progenitors were tryptase+/chymase- (MCT) and accounted for 10 to 20% of nucleated mononuclear blood cells (MNC). A subset of them contained metachromatic granules. As assessed by combined toluidine blue/immunofluorescence staining, the granulated mast cell precursors were found to express CD9 (P24), CD33 (gp67) and CD44 (Pgp-1), but not basophil-related markers (CD11b (C3biR), CDw17 (lactosylceramide), CD123 (il-3R alpha))or monocyte-related antigens (CD14, CD15). Expression of the mast cell growth factor (MGF) receptor, c-kit(CD117), was also demonstrable, whereas the skin mast cell marker C5aR (CD88) could not be detected on mast cell precursors. The ligand of c-kit, recombinant human (rh) stem cell factor (SCF = MGF), induced histamine release from circulating mast cell progenitors, whereas rhC5a, a potent skin mast cell-/basophil-agonist, was ineffective over the dose-range (10(-9) to 10(-7(M)) tested.

Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate density and migration of MCs in OSCC (oral squamous cell carcinoma) and pre-malignant oral hyperkeratosis (leukoplakia) as well as their relationship with clinical and microscopic parameters. The tryptase and c-kit expression was analyzed in 38 cases of OSCC, 26 cases of leukoplakia, and 12 cases of clinically healthy oral mucosa (control) by means of immunohistochemistry. The tryptase(+) cell numbers were decreased in OSCC (P=0.0003) and leukoplakia (P=0.03) compared with control. Similar numbers of tryptase(+) cells were observed in leukoplakia and OSCC (P=0.31). The density of c-kit(+) MCs was also significantly lower in OSCC and leukoplakia in relation to control resulting in a reduced c-kit(+)/tryptase(+) relationship in OSCC (19%) in comparison with leukoplakia (59%) and control (63%). No correlation was observed between MC populations with clinical and microscopic characteristics of OSCC. Our findings suggest that the decrease in MC numbers in pre-malignant and malignant oral lesions may be related to the migration failure of these cells, possibly reflecting an important modification in the microenvironment during tumor initiation and progression.",

In the current study, we reported the tumor xenografts of the human A431 squamous cell carcinoma, after 25-week consecutive therapy with EGFR inhibitor (gefitinib) that developed resistance as a result of c-Kit overexpression. Moreover, combined therapeutic inhibition of EGFR and c-Kit may abrogate this acquired mechanism of drug resistance due to an enhanced apoptotic effect in gefitinib-resistant xenograft model.

It has been speculated that AM might be a precursor of malignancy or an indicator of a susceptibility of the breast tissue to develop neoplasia, mainly based on comparing the frequency of AM in breast cancer and non-breast cancer patients [1]. Studies using comparative genomic hybridization have supported this by showing similar molecular alterations in benign and malignant apocrine lesions [2]. Few studies, however, have compared expression of biomarkers involved in tumor progression in AM and progressively more advanced atypical apocrine lesions. The expression of C-KIT, COX2, CD24, and CD44s was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material of 9 AM, 20 apocrine ductal intraepithelial neoplasia (DIN1c-3) and 40 atypical apocrine lesions (not qualifying for DIN1c-3) and compared to expression of the same biomarkers in adjacent normal ductal epithelium. Of the 66 apocrine lesions, 62 (94 %) did not express C-KIT compared to 4/63 (6 %) of the normal glands (Fisher's exact, p < 0.001). COX2 was expressed in a significantly higher proportion of apocrine lesions than of normal glands (49 vs. 14 %, p < 0.001), and the number of apocrine lesions positive for CD24 was found to be higher with increasing aggressiveness of the lesions (Spearman, p < 0.001). In conclusion, benign and non-invasive proliferative apocrine lesions of the breast display immuno-phenotypical characteristics previously ascribed mainly to malignant transformation. This could lend support to the theory that AM is an early step towards malignant transformation, albeit associated with slow progression to carcinoma. ",

Furthermore, high anti-HIP1 antibody reactivity in the sera of a cohort of MCC patients predicts the presence of metastases. Another protein that is frequently expressed at high levels in MCC tumors is the stem cell factor (SCF) receptor tyrosine kinase, c-Kit. In working toward an understanding of how HIP1 might contribute to MCC tumorigenesis, we have discovered that HIP1 interacts with SCF-activated c-Kit. These data not only identify HIP1 as a molecular marker for management of MCC patients but also show that HIP1 interacts with and slows the degradation of c-Kit.",

It has been recently reported that molecular-targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), are effective in patients with lung carcinoma. In efforts to improve the prognosis of patients with LCNEC, we analyzed gene expression, gene mutations and immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of known molecular targets in LCNECs, and compared the expression to that of lung adenocarcinomas (ACs). Thirteen patients with primary LCNEC and 14 patients with AC were analyzed. We evaluated IHC expression for c-KIT, human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), gene mutations for EGFR, K-ras and c-kit, and gene expression using fluorescence in situ hybridization for EGFR. In cases with LCNEC, the IHC expression of c-KIT, HER2 and VEGF was 76.9, 30.8 and 100%, respectively. There was a significant difference in the IHC expression of c-KIT and HER2 between the LCNEC and AC cases. Two cases of LCNEC had overexpression of HER2, and the frequency of EGFR gene mutations was higher in the the AC group, with only a single EGFR mutation (exon 18) identified in the LCNEC group. Although LCNEC had a higher rate of expression of c-KIT by IHC, no c-kit gene mutations were found.

The results in these refractory tumors were compared with those of 12 patients with chemosensitive GCTs diagnosed in an advanced metastatic stage.;The data obtained in both groups did not differ in any of the investigated biologic markers. c-KIT was detected in the one case of pure seminoma studied and in the seminomatous components of combined tumors. The presence of EGFR was restricted to trophoblastic giant cells and the syncytiotrophoblastic elements of four nonseminomas including one pure choriocarcinoma and to a secondary non-germ cell malignancy, which had developed most likely from a mature teratoma. ERB-B2 was moderately positive in the secondary non-germ cell malignancy, in one mature teratoma component of a mixed nonseminoma, and together with EGFR in the syncytiotrophoblastic cells of a pure choriocarcinoma. Of all samples investigated, this latter case was the only one showing an amplification of the ERB-B2 gene in the syncytiotrophoblasts. ERB-B3 and ERB-B4 were detected rarely.;The majority of refractory GCTs do not qualify for treatment with new biologic agents targeting the receptor tyrosine kinases EGFR, ERB-B2, or c-KIT.

However, if some studies identified estrogens as causative agents of PCa, others indicated that these steroids have a protective role counteracting prostate overgrowth. The tyrosine kinase receptor c-KIT and its ligand, the stem cell factor (SCF), have been associated with the control of cell proliferation/apoptosis and prostate carcinogenesis, and studies show that estrogens regulate their expression in different tissues, though, in the case of prostate this remains unknown. The present study aims to evaluate the role of 17β-estradiol (E2) in regulating the expression of SCF/c-KIT in human prostate cell lines and rat prostate, and to investigate the consequent effects on prostate cell proliferation and apoptosis. qPCR, Western Blot, and immuno(cito)histochemistry analysis showed that E2-treatment decreased the expression of SCF and c-KIT both in human prostate cells and rat prostate. Furthermore, the diminished expression of SCF/c-KIT was underpinned by the diminished prostate weight and reduced proliferation index. On the other hand, the results of TUNEL labelling, the increased activity of caspase-3, and the augmented expression of caspase-8 and Fas system in the prostate of E2-treated animals indicated augmented apoptosis in response to E2. The obtained results demonstrated that E2 down-regulated the expression of SCF/c-KIT system in prostate cells, which was associated with antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects. Moreover, these findings support the protective role of estrogens in PCa and open new perspectives on the application of estrogen-based therapies. ",

However, recent studies suggest that bortezomib may have more complex mechanisms of action in treating cancer. We report here that the endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of the receptor tyrosine kinase C-KIT are required for bortezomib- but not tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib-caused apoptosis of t(8;21) leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumor cells, suggesting that C-KIT may recruit an apoptosis initiator. We show that C-KIT binds and phosphorylates heat shock protein 90β (Hsp90β), which sequestrates apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf-1). Bortezomib dephosphorylates pHsp90β and releases Apaf-1. Although the activated caspase-3 is not sufficient to cause marked apoptosis, it cleaves the t(8;21) generated acute myeloid leukemia 1-eight twenty one (AML1-ETO) and AML1-ETO9a fusion proteins, with production of cleavage fragments that perturb the functions of the parental oncoproteins and further contribute to apoptosis. Notably, bortezomib exerts potent therapeutic efficacy in mice bearing AML1-ETO9a-driven leukemia. These data show that C-KIT-pHsp90β-Apaf-1 cascade is critical for some malignant cells to evade apoptosis, and the clinical therapeutic potentials of bortezomib in C-KIT-driven neoplasms should be further explored.",

Because recent studies in GISTs suggest that KIT-activating mutations predict response to imatinib therapy, we also sequenced a subset of positive tumors.;More than 3,000 tumors from more than 120 different tumor categories were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in a tissue microarray format. Seven commercially available anti-KIT antibodies were initially evaluated. The antibody A4502 (DAKO) was selected for analysis because of a high frequency of positivity in GIST and low staining background in other tissues. To determine the frequency of KIT mutations in various tumor types, the exons 2, 8, 9, 11, 13, and 17 (where mutations previously were reported) were sequenced in 36 tumors with strong KIT expression.;KIT positivity was detected in 28 of 28 GISTs (100%), 42 of 50 seminomas (84%), 34 of 52 adenoid-cystic carcinomas (65%), 14 of 39 malignant melanomas (35%), and eight of 47 large-cell carcinomas of the lung (17%), as well as in 47 additional tumor types.

Using a functional cell-based assay, we have identified two novel G-quadruplex ligands that reduce the transcription of a luciferase reporter driven from the G-quadruplex-containing c-KIT promoter. We have further shown that endogenous c-KIT expression in a human gastric carcinoma cell line is also reduced on treatment with these molecules.

NK cells proliferate and display enhanced cytotoxic activity in response to the T cell growth factor, interleukin 2 (IL-2). Stem cell factor or steel factor (SF) is the ligand for the c-kit receptor, and when combined with other hematopoietic growth factors, SF synergistically promotes the proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow stem cells. In the present study we show the c-kit receptor to be uniquely expressed on a subset of resting human NK cells (CD56bright) which constitutively expresses both the high affinity IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) and the intermediate affinity IL-2R. Other lymphocyte populations, including CD56dim NK cells, did not appear to express the c-kit receptor. Within the CD56bright NK cell subset, SF alone had no obvious effect on proliferation or cytotoxic activity. SF was shown to significantly augment the proliferative effect of IL-2, and caused a marked shift in the dose-response curve at IL-2 concentrations that selectively saturate the high affinity IL-2R. The potentiating effect of SF on NK cell proliferation was dependent on IL-2 binding to the high affinity IL-2R, and was blocked by a monoclonal antibody directed against the c-kit receptor. SF did not enhance proliferation at higher IL-2 concentrations that saturate the intermediate affinity IL-2R, nor did SF enhance IL-2-induced cytotoxic activity. Together, these data indicate that SF and IL-2 act synergistically to directly augment the proliferative capacity of a unique human NK cell subset constitutively expressing the high affinity IL-2R and the c-kit receptor. The implications of these findings on NK cell development and the host's early immune response to pathogen invasion are discussed.",

Growth factor receptors and their ligands may be involved in its growth and dissemination. We analyzed the expression of c-kit and its ligand stem cell factor (SCF) in a panel of six Ewing's sarcoma cell lines. All cell lines exhibited substantial levels of surface c-kit expression, and five of six displayed transmembrane SCF on the cell surface. Expression of c-kit was down-modulated in all lines by exposure to exogenous SCF. The SCF treatment was able to confer to cells a growth advantage in vitro, due both to an increase in cell proliferation and to a reduction in the apoptotic rate. When used in the lower compartment of a migration chamber, SCF acted as a strong chemoattractant for Ewing's sarcoma cells. The pretreatment of cells with SCF reduced their chemotactic response to SCF. In athymic nude mice, Ewing's sarcoma cells injected intravenously metastasized to the lung and to a variety of extrapulmonary sites, including bone and bone marrow. Metastatic sites resembled those observed in Ewing's sarcoma patients and corresponded to SCF-rich microenvironments. The in vitro pretreatment of cells with SCF strongly reduced the metastatic ability of Ewing's sarcoma cells, both to the lung and to extrapulmonary sites. This could be dependent on the down-modulation of c-kit expression observed in SCF-pretreated cells, leading to a reduced sensitivity to the chemotactic and proliferative actions of SCF. Our results indicate that the response to SCF mediated by c-kit may be involved in growth, migration, and metastatic ability of Ewing's sarcoma cells.",

In this study, mutations of p53, c-kit, K-ras, and beta-catenin gene were analyzed in 17 cases (13 males and four females with ages ranging from 25 to 84 years) of such lymphomas by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism followed by direct sequencing. Selected exons in each gene, representing hot spots, were analyzed. All 44 mutations detected were single-nucleotide substitutions and 33 were missense mutations. Nineteen mutations were detected in exon 5 and / or 7 of the p53 gene in nine of 17 cases (52.9%) and 21 in exon 11 and / or 17 of the c-kit gene in 10 of 14 cases (71.4%). Bilateral adrenal lesions in one case who had not received any adjuvant therapy showed different mutational patterns of the p53 and c-kit genes, suggesting different clonal evolution of lymphoma between the left and right sides. Mutation at codon 13 of the K-ras gene was detected in one of 14 cases (7.1%), and in exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene in three of 12 cases (25%).

Since a proton beam has advantageous physical properties, i. e.

PBT is adopted mainly as a radical treatment for patients with early-stage or locally-advanced prostatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, or head & neck malignant tumor. Moreover, the benefits of PBT may be shared not only with a pediatric patient who is easily injured and growth disturbed by even low-level irradiation of normal tissues/organs and also with an inoperable elderly patient with several medical complications.

The aim of our study was to identify and quantify the phenotypic heterogeneity of MCs in prostate lesions. Our study included 7 cases of normal prostate, 25 cases of benign epithelial hyperplasia and 64 cases of prostate carcinoma. MCs were immunohistochemically assessed using three markers: tryptase, chymase and CD117.

Sarcoma of the uterus, while accounting for a small percent of uterine cancers, is also associated with a high-recurrence rate and poor overall survival. Therefore, the development of novel treatment strategies is paramount.

Preclinical data provides evidence for c-kit and PDGFR expression in ovarian epithelial carcinomas and uterine sarcomas and have led to clinical trials evaluating the use of imatinib in these malignancies. Additionally, inhibition of PDGFR signaling has been proposed as an effective mechanism of chemotherapy by lowering tumor interstitial fluid pressure. Recent data have also suggested benefit with metronomic scheduling of cytotoxic agents at lower doses at more frequent dosing intervals, in combination with other targeted therapies.

The majority of HCC patients are diagnosed at advanced stage disease for which no curative treatments exist. TGF-β has been identified as a potential therapeutic target. However, the molecular mechanisms mediating its functional switch from a tumor suppressor to tumor promoter in HCC and its interactions with other signaling pathways are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate an aberrant molecular network between the TGF-β and c-KIT pathway that mediates the functional switch of TGF-β to a driver of tumor progression in HCC. TGF-β/SMAD2 signaling transcriptionally regulates expression of the c-KIT receptor ligand (stem cell factor [SCF]) with subsequent auto- and paracrine activation of c-KIT/JAK1/STAT3 signaling. SCF induces TGF-β1 ligand expression via STAT3, thereby forming a positive feedback loop between TGF-β/SMAD and SCF/c-KIT signaling. This network neutralizes TGF-β-mediated cell cycle inhibition and induces tumor cell proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition, migration, and invasion. Disruption of this feedback loop inhibits TGF-β tumor-promoting effects and restores its antiproliferative functions. Consistent with our in vitro data, we demonstrate SCF overexpression and its correlation to SMAD2 and STAT3 activation in human HCC tumors, advanced tumor-node-metastasis stages, and shorter survival.;Canonical TGF-β and c-KIT signaling forms a positive, tumor-promoting feedback loop. Disruption of this loop restores TGF-β tumor suppressor function and provides the rationale for targeting the TGF-β/SCF axis as a novel therapeutic strategy for HCC.",

The analysed parameters were the localization, size, microscopic (mitotic index, nectosis, bleeding, invasivity) and immunohistochemical characteristics (CD117 (c-kit), CD34, desmin, vimentin, smooth muscle actin and s-100 protein expression.;Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (n=21) size varied from 10-150 mm were most frequently gastric localised with predominance of malignant tumors (85.72%). Most GIST were comprised of a uniform spindle cell population, but some were dominated by epitheloid cells. Eosinophilic cells stained CD117, CD34 and vimentin positively, were usually arranged in fascicles with the presence of skeinoid fibers. Positive correlation of biologic potential and tumor size, haemorrhagia and mitotic index were found, so as negative correlation of biologic potential and incapsulation.;The above results, a specially localization, tumor size, mitotic index, CD117, CD34 and vimentin positivity, may be helpful for setting of a widespread criteria for diagnostic and differential diagnosis of GIST and their use in practice and therapy.",

Because angiogenesis and tumor invasion have been associated with extracellular matrix degradation and intercellular tight junctions, the involvement of zonulin in glioma biology is in the focus. We selected for histological examination five cases of glioblastoma WHO IV (nomenclature of the World Health Organization) and one case each from astrocytoma WHO III, meningioma WHO III, and meningioma WHO I as control samples. The meningioma WHO I is regarded as benign, whereas the meningioma WHO III is recognized as the transition form of malignant tumors in humans. The visualization of a newly designed antibody against human zonulin was studied in triple-labeling studies using fluorescence immunocytochemistry and compared with the expression of c-kit and glial fibrillary acidic protein in differently developed human gliomas. We found that increasing the expression of c-kit is accompanied by an increase of zonulin expression. Both are correlated to the degree of malignancy of human brain tumors. The expression of zonulin is correlated to the degradation of the blood-brain barrier as revealed by Griffonia simplicifolia lectin. In differently graded tumors, we found differently graded involvement of blood vessels in the tumor development, explaining patients' survival.",

We determined, by Western blot, variation in the level of expression of AP-2 and three of its downstream targets, c-kit, E-cadherin, and p21 in several human melanoma cell lines and, by immunohistochemistry, in a group of 99 histological samples including benign and malignant melanocytic lesions. A significant negative correlation between AP-2 expression level and tumor thickness was found. Moreover, AP-2 expression was positively associated with E-cadherin and c-kit expression. In contrast, there was a significant negative association between AP-2 and p21 expression levels. These findings suggest that p21 is independent of AP-2 transactivator function during the latest phases of melanoma progression. Finally, AP-2, c-kit, E-cadherin, and p21 expression levels did not show to be able to distinguish between dysplastic nevi and nevi without dysplasia. We conclude that changes in the expression of these proteins are involved in the later phases of melanoma progression, and may be responsible for the transition from local invasive melanoma to metastasis.",

Two different splice variants form predominantly soluble (sSCF or SCF-1) and in addition some membrane-bound SCF (mSCF or SCF-2). In order to explore the prognostic significance of these molecules in melanoma, total SCF, SCF splice variants and c-Kit expression were studied in normal skin melanocytes and in 11 different melanoma cell lines, using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunocytochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Nine of the 11 melanoma cell lines expressed SCF-1 mRNA, only two of them SCF-2, and these two also SCF-1. Coexpression of both SCF-1 and c-Kit was noted in five cell lines, and only one cell line as well as normal melanocytes expressed both SCF-1 and SCF-2 as well as c-Kit. Corresponding results were obtained on immunocytochemical staining. Of three exemplary melanoma cell lines studied, two expressing SCF mRNA also released SCF spontaneously and on stimulation, whereas the line lacking SCF and c-kit mRNA (SK-Mel-23) failed to do so. These data demonstrate thus that melanoma cell lines, particularly those known to metastasize in vivo, lose the ability to express SCF-2 mRNA, suggesting that this molecule may serve, next to c-Kit, as a prognostic marker for malignant melanoma.",

The normal group was fed with standard forage while the rest two groups were fed with 3'-methyl-2-methylamino-azobenzene (DAB) to induce carcinoma for 14 weeks and then fed with standard forage and water. Uscharidin was injected abdominally to the intervention group from the first week to the 14th week. All rats were killed and biopsy specimens were taken from the left and right liver lobes for immunohistochemical staining of c-kit and PCNA on the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, 20th, 22nd, and 24th week.;From the 2nd to 14th week after liver infection, c-kit positive cells, mainly oval cells were found in the portal area in the carcinoma-induction group and dotted positive pigmentations in liver lobules. In the 22nd week, a large number of cancerous nodes occurred and nuclei heteromorphism was apparent; the number of positive cell decreased but positive cells could be sparsely observed in cancerous nodes. In the 2nd week of the carcinoma-induction process, PCNA positive cells were oval cells in the portal area. In the 4th week, a lot of hepatic cells were positively stained, especially in the central vein area. In the 6th week, PCNA positive cells could be seen in the lobules of the liver. In the 8th week, the number of PCNA cells decreased comparatively. From the 10th to 14th week, oval cells in the portal area were still over-expressed. From the 16th to 24th week, a large number of cancerous nodes occurred and PCNA was over-expressed in some of them. In necrotic cancerous nodes, the para-cancerous PCNA positive cells were sparsely distributed and their number was less than that of PCNA positive cells of cancerous tissues.;Hepatic stem cells originating from the terminal biliary plexus of the portal area are involved in the development of hepatocarcinoma because c-kit positive cells expressed in cancerous nodes, accompany the whole process of the development. In the middle inflammatory period of carcinoma-induction, the expression of PCNA in hepatic cells peaked, but the index decreased in the late inflammatory period and in the proliferated fibrosis stage. The expression of PCNA is a tortuous process, going up, down, then up again from normal tissues to cancerous tissues. Combined with pathological findings, PCNA can be considered as a warning index for carcinomatous cells.",

The lack of data on imatinib activity raises the question whether to enroll these patients in clinical trials. We analyzed a large series of NF-1 related GISTs to discuss the therapeutic implications.;Clinical, pathologic (IHC to CD34, S100, bcl-2, PDGFRA), and molecular features (exons 9, 11, 13, 14, 17 in c-kit and exons 12, 14, 18 in PDGFRA) of 28 patients were analyzed.;The most common site of primary lesions was the small bowel (75%). Twelve patients (43%) had multiple tumors. Most tumors belonged to the high (30.5%) or intermediate risk group for malignant behavior (39%). Three patients developed peritoneal and liver metastases; another four had peritoneal spread only. All tumors were immunohistochemically strongly positive for CD117. Three primary KIT/PDGFRA activating mutations were found. Three metastatic patients treated with imatinib experienced progression, and only one had temporary stable disease. Median survival after starting treatment with imatinib was 21 months.;This study is the largest series available and confirms that KIT/PDGFRA mutations in NF-1-associated GISTs are sporadic. Prognosis of metastatic tumors is poor, and imatinib response rate is low. Patients with NF-1-GIST of high or intermediate risk should not be eligible for adjuvant trials of imatinib. Imatinib should not be used in a neoadjuvant intent in these patients, and molecular analysis of activating mutations is strongly recommended.",

Persistence of fetal spermatogonial characteristics was implicated in the emergence of testicular germ cell tumors. The objective of this study was to analyze the tubular architecture in contralateral testes of patients with NSTGCT. We studied morphologic alterations, expression patterns of markers for the integrity of the germinal epithelium (gap junction proteins connexin 43 and 26), as well as of the embryonic markers c-KIT and placental alkaline phosphatase (PlAP), both established markers to detect carcinoma in situ (CIS). In all samples, tubules showing maturation of germ cells up to spermatozoa were observed. In addition, tubules with alterations in tubular architecture and with impaired spermatogenesis occurred. In tubules showing aberrant spermatogenesis, connexin 43 (Cx43) signal was down-regulated and a shift of signal from gap junctions to the cytoplasm occurred. Concomitantly, Cx26 was found highly up-regulated in tubules with incomplete and aberrant germ cell maturation. All testes exhibited single spermatogonia with positive reaction for c-KIT and a significant positive correlation was found between the mean number of c-KIT positive spermatogonia per tubule and the percentage of tubules presenting severely impaired spermatogenesis. Our data show alterations of the normal architecture of the germinal epithelium and disturbances of spermatogenesis in the contralateral testes of patients with NSTGCT in all cases evaluated. The concomitant occurrence of c-KIT positive spermatogonia and defects in tubular architecture is in line with the hypothesis that patients with NSTGCT suffer from disturbed germ cell development.",

Platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) alpha is almost universally expressed on glioma cells; expression of the proto-oncogene c-KIT has also been reported. These findings have led to the clinical investigation of inhibitors of this pathway, such as imatinib and dasatinib, for the treatment of recurrent malignant glioma. To date, this approach in unselected patients has been disappointing. However, isolated responses have been seen, which may correlate with constitutive activation of one or more of the corresponding tyrosine kinases. In the future, it is hoped that an increasing knowledge of glioma biology will translate into the more judicious use of these and other targeted therapies, resulting in improvements in patient outcomes.

In human, two guanine-rich sequences (h_kit1 and h_kit2) were identified in the promotorial region of oncogene KIT. Their stabilization into G-quadruplex structures can find applications in the treatment of leukemias, mastocytosis, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, and lung carcinomas which are often associated to c-kit mis-regulation. Also the most common skin cancer in domestic dog, mast cell tumor, is linked to a mutation and/or to an over-expression of c-kit, thus supporting dog as an excellent animal model. In order to assess if the G-quadruplex mediated mechanism of regulation of c-kit expression is conserved among the two species, herein we cloned and sequenced the canine KIT promoter region and we compared it with the human one in terms of sequence and conformational equilibria in physiologically relevant conditions. Our results evidenced a general conserved promotorial sequence between the two species. As experimentally confirmed, this grants that the conformational features of the canine kit1 sequence are substantially shared with the human one. Conversely, two isoforms of the kit2 sequences were identified in the analyzed dog population. In comparison with the human counterpart, both of them showed an altered distribution among several folded conformations. ",

Jaw metastases from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract usually evolve from adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, colon, and rectum. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the GI tract defined by a positive C-Kit (CD117). These tumors are thought to arise from Cajal cells in GI tract walls, essential for intestine motor function. The small intestine harbors only 30% of GIST. After reviewing the literature, no case of jaw metastases from GIST was found. The purpose of this study was to report the first case of mandibular metastases arising from a stromal tumor of the ileum.;A 68-year-old man presented with a painful swelling in the parasymphysis and left molar mandibular area having grown progressively for 3 weeks. The oral mucosa was macroscopically normal. The orthopantomograph showed radiolucency. A CT-Scan revealed an irregular osteolytic lesion with invasion of soft-tissues. Biopsy proved a stromal tumor.

Differential diagnoses between collecting duct carcinoma, pelvic urothelial carcinoma with marked invasion to the renal parenchyma (invasive urothelial carcinoma), and papillary renal cell carcinoma is often challenging. In our current study, we examined the utility of using commercially available antibodies, in conjunction with lectin histochemistry, for such differential diagnoses. We examined 17 cases of collecting duct carcinoma, 10 cases of invasive urothelial carcinoma and 15 cases of papillary renal cell carcinoma (type 1, 6 cases; type 2, 9 cases) in these evaluations. Our results indicated that Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1, E-cadherin, and c-KIT were frequently positive in collecting duct carcinoma and invasive urothelial carcinoma, in comparison with papillary renal cell carcinoma, which had negative results for CD10 and alpha-methylacyl CoA racemase. We found, however, that collecting duct carcinoma showed positivity for high-molecular-weight cytokeratin and low-molecular-weight cytokeratin at a low frequency compared with invasive urothelial carcinoma, and that these distinctions need further careful evaluation. In addition, high-molecular-weight cytokeratin positivity was not a reliable marker for collecting duct carcinoma. We conclude that Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1 reactivity and positivity for E-cadherin and c-KIT are effective in distinguishing collecting duct carcinoma from papillary renal cell carcinoma, and that negative results for alpha-methylacyl CoA racemase and CD10 are potentially useful hallmarks of this distinction also. In contrast, a differential diagnosis for collecting duct carcinoma and invasive urothelial carcinoma will require careful examination of multiple routinely stained specimens, particularly in cases of in situ neoplastic lesions in the pelvic mucosa.",

At surgery, a huge pedunculated extraluminal tumor was found arising from the greater curvature of the stomach and invading the surrounding structures, and there were also a submucosal tumor measuring 5 x 4 x 4 cm and multiple intramural nodules beside the main tumor. These lesions, which were removed with 1.0-cm surgical margins, were immunohistochemically positive for c-kit (CD117) and CD34. A diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) was made. The huge size of the tumor (3.6 kg in weight and 36 x 25 x 25 cm in diameter), the invasion of the surrounding structures, and the increased mitotic figures indicated the GIST had malignant potential. Sequence analysis of the polymerase chain reaction product of RNAs from the tumor cells revealed a novel platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) mutation, which would exhibit biologic consequences similar to those of the c-kit mutation.

        "Doc_abstract":"Primary sinonasal tract and nasopharyngeal adenoid cystic carcinomas (STACC) are uncommon tumors that are frequently misclassified, resulting in inappropriate clinical management. Eighty-six cases of STACC included 45 females and 41 males, aged 12-91 years (mean 54.4 years). Patients presented most frequently with obstructive symptoms (n = 54), followed by epistaxis (n = 23), auditory symptoms (n = 12), nerve symptoms (n = 11), nasal discharge (n = 11), and/or visual symptoms (n = 10), present for a mean of 18.2 months. The tumors involved the nasal cavity alone (n = 25), nasopharynx alone (n = 13), maxillary sinus alone (n = 4), or a combination of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses (n = 44), with a mean size of 3.7 cm. Patients presented equally between low and high stage disease: stage I and II (n = 42) or stage III and IV (n = 44) disease. Histologically, the tumors were invasive (bone: n = 66; neural: n = 47; lymphovascular: n = 33), composed of a variety of growth patterns, including cribriform (n = 33), tubular (n = 16), and solid (n = 9), although frequently a combination of these patterns was seen within a single tumor. Pleomorphism was mild with an intermediate N:C ratio in cells containing hyperchromatic nuclei. Reduplicated basement membrane and glycosaminoglycan material was commonly seen. Necrosis (n = 16) and atypical mitotic figures (n = 11) were infrequently present. Pleomorphic adenoma was present in 9 cases; de-differentiation was seen in two patients. Immunohistochemical studies showed positive reactions for pan-cytokeratin, CK7, CK5/6, CAM5.2, and EMA, with myoepithelial reactivity with SMA, p63, calponin, S100 protein and SMMHC. CD117, CEA, GFAP and p16 were variably present. CK20 and HR HPV were negative. STACC needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of most sinonasal malignancies, particularly poorly differentiated carcinoma, olfactory neuroblastoma and pleomorphic adenoma. Surgery (n = 82), often accompanied by radiation therapy (n = 36), was generally employed. A majority of patients developed a recurrence (n = 52) 2-144 months after initial presentation. Overall mean follow-up was 19.4 years (range 0.4-37.5 years): 46 patients died with disease (mean 6.4 years); 5 were alive with disease (mean 5.4 years), and 35 patients were either alive or had died of unrelated causes (mean 16.3 years). ACC of the SNT is uncommon. Recurrences are common. The following parameters, when present, suggest an increased incidence of either recurrence or dying with disease: mixed site of involvement, high stage disease (stage IV), skull base involvement, tumor recurrence, a solid histology, perineural invasion, bone invasion, and lymphovascular invasion.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is a malignant disease caused by human T-lymphotropic virus type 1. In aggressive ATL, the response to chemotherapy is extremely poor. We hypothesized that this poor response is due to the existence of chemotherapy-resistant cells, such as leukemic stem cells. Previously, we successfully identified an ATL stem cell (ATLSC) candidate as the c-kit+/CD38-/CD71- cells in an ATL mouse model using Tax transgenic mice. Here, with a new ATL mouse model using HBZ-transgenic mice, we further discovered that the functional ATLSC candidate, which commonly expresses c-kit, is drug-resistant and has the ability to initiate tumors and reconstitute lymphomatous cells. We characterized the ATLSCs as c-kit+/CD4-/CD8- cells and found that they have a similar gene expression profile as T cell progenitors. Additionally, we found that AP-1 gene family members, including Junb, Jund, and Fosb, were up-regulated in the ATLSC fraction. The results of an in vitro assay showed that ATLSCs cultured with cytokines known to promote stem cell expansion, such as stem cell factor (SCF), showed highly proliferative activity and maintained their stem cell fraction. Inhibition of c-kit-SCF signaling with the neutralizing antibody ACK2 affected ATLSC self-renewal and proliferation. Experiments in Sl/Sld mice, which have a mutation in the membrane-bound c-kit ligand, found that ATL development was completely blocked in these mice. These results clearly suggest that the c-kit-SCF signal plays a key role in ATLSC self-renewal and in ATL initiation and disease progression.",

With attention to the direct connection between the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) of tumor cells and the pharmacological effects of specific inhibitors, we systematically assessed the RTK expressions of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the lung [HGNECs, including SCLC and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC)].;Fifty-one LCNEC and 61 SCLC patients who underwent surgical resection were enrolled in this research. As a control group, 202 patients with adenocarcinomas (ADCs) and 122 patients with squamous cell carcinomas (SQCCs) were also analyzed. All the tumors were stained with antibodies for 10 RTKs: c-Kit, EGFR, IGF1R, KDR, ERBB2, FGFR1, c-Met, ALK, RET, and ROS1.;The LCNEC and SCLC patients exhibited similar clinicopathological characteristics. The IHC scores for each RTK were almost equivalent between the LCNEC and SCLC groups, but they were significantly different from those of the ADC or SQCC groups. In particular, c-Kit was the only RTK that was remarkably expressed in both LCNECs and SCLCs. On the other hand, about 20 % of the HGNEC tumors exhibited strongly positive RTK expression, and this rate was similar to those for the ADC and SQCC tumors. Intriguingly, strongly positive RTKs were almost mutually exclusive in individual tumors.;Compared with ADC or SQCC, LCNEC and SCLC had similar expression profiles for the major RTKs. The exclusive c-Kit positivity observed among HGNECs suggests that c-Kit might be a distinctive RTK in HGNEC.",

We used a helical CT single-slice (Toshiba, Asteion; rotation time 0.75 s) in ten cases and helical CT multislice (Toshiba, Aquilion; 4 slices/rotation; rotation time 0.5 s) in five cases. In all cases, we used an organ-iodate nonionic contrast agent intravenously at a concentration of 350-400 mgI/ml. All cases studied the entire abdomen. Site, morphology and tumour size (smaller than 5 cm, 5-10 cm and larger than 10 cm) were considered parameters for tumour identification. Size, partial or total extraluminal tumour growth, homogeneous or inhomogeneous lesion enhancement and the eventual presence of calcifications were assumed to be criteria for characterisation of a GIST. Hepatic, peritoneal and/or lymph node metastases were considered parameters of intermediate or high malignancy. We correlated the results with some pathological features derived from the analysis of surgical tissue: site, morphology and tumour size, tissue components and risk of malignancy of GIST (on the basis of the 2002 Fletcher classification).;We demonstrated one substantial concordance between radiological and pathological valuation of site, morphology, tumour size and absence of intralesional calcifications of GIST. Nine of ten GIST smaller than 5 cm, the two 5-10 cm and the three larger than 10 cm presented extraluminal growth. Enhancement was inhomogeneous in five of ten lesions smaller than 5 cm and in all cases larger than 5 cm. At pathological analysis, in all cases of inhomogeneous enhancement, solid, hemorrhagic, necrotic and cystic areas were found. Of seven tumours of intermediate malignancy, six were smaller than 5 cm and only one larger than 10 cm; the two 5-10 cm were of high malignancy and all tumours superior of 10 cm were at intermediate or high malignancy. Of the two cases with metastases, one was of intermediate and one of high malignancy. In the other cases of intermediate or high malignancy, metastases were absent.;The immunopositivity for c-kit is requisite for definitive diagnosis of GIST, but imaging, and particularly helical CT, has a primary role. In this study, CT is was reliable for tumour identification. All tumours larger than 5 cm presented extraluminal growth, inhomogeneous enhancement, absence of calcifications and lymph node metastases. Furthermore, the tumour larger than 5 cm showed extraluminal growth and inhomogeneous enhancement. Tumour size established with CT was not sufficient to determine the degree of malignancy. Metastases at the time of diagnosis were indicative of intermediate or high malignancy, but the absence of metastases did not allow classification of GIST in the group of low and very low risk of malignancy.",

The outcome of these malignancies is difficult to predict and the histogenesis is still controversial. However, the frequent and specific expression of CD117 (c-kit) by these tumors could imply an origin from interstitial cells of Cajal. Our objective was to analyze the role of fine needle aspiration cytology, cell block preparation, and immunocytochemistry in the interpretation of gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and to establish scanning electron microscopy as a useful research aid for pathologic changes of the surface cells of gastrointestinal stromal tumors, not totally appreciated by light microscopy.;Twelve cases of gastrointestinal stromal tumors were included in this study, in which fine needle aspiration cytology was performed.;On aspirated material, the tumor cells formed closely packed cohesive tissue fragments with high cellular density often in bloody background, or fascicles with parallel side-by-side arrangements of the nuclei. On cell block biopsy material, gastrointestinal stromal tumors were highly cellular spindle or epithelioid tumors with basophilic appearance. Immunocytochemically, they were CD117 positive in all twelve cases, CD34 positive in nine, weakly smooth muscle actin-positive in five, and S-100 and GFAP-negative in all cases. The scanning electron microscopy study showed a strong correlation with the cytomorphological profile.;Gastrointestinal stromal tumors show a broad morphologic variety, but nuclear pleomorphism by cytology alone, rarely correlates with malignant potential. In the appropriate clinical and radiological setting, a confident diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors can be documented by fine needle aspiration cytology, cell block, immunocytochemical, and scanning electron microscopy results.",

Late toxicities were graded according to the common terminology criteria for adverse events v4.0 (CTCAE v4.0).;From January 1999 through December 2008, 90 patients satisfied all criteria. Median observation period was 57.5 months (range, 12.4-162.7 months), median time to onset of grade 2 or greater late toxicity except cataract was 39.2 months (range, 2.7-99.8 months), and 3 patients had toxicities that occurred more than 5 years after PBT. Grade 3 late toxicities occurred in 17 patients (19%), with 19 events, and grade 4 late toxicities in 6 patients (7%), with 6 events (encephalomyelitis infection 2, optic nerve disorder 4).;In conclusion, the late toxicity profile of PBT in patients with malignancy involving the nasal cavity, para-nasal sinuses, or skull base malignancy was partly clarified. Because late toxicity can still occur at 5 years after treatment, long-term follow-up is necessary.",

Among the suppressor cells, T regulatory cells (Treg) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are significantly increased in hosts with advanced malignancies. MDSC mediate the suppression of the tumor antigen-specific T cell response through the induction of T cell anergy and the development of Treg in tumor-bearing mice. These results provide robust evidence of an in vivo immunoregulatory function of MDSC in the establishment of tumor antigen-specific tolerance and the development of Treg in tumor-bearing hosts. To achieve effective anti-tumor immunity, tumor-induced immunosuppression must be reversed. Our preliminary results indicate that c-kit ligand (stem cell factor) expressed by tumor cells may be required for MDSC accumulation in tumor-bearing mice, and that blocking the c-kit ligand/c-kit receptor interaction can prevent the development of Treg and reverse immune tolerance induced by MDSC. Since c-kit can be readily inhibited by several small molecule inhibitors including imatinib, sunitinib and dasatinib, targeting immune suppressing cells can be readily accomplished in the clinic.",

Coexpression of the growth factor and receptor suggests their role in autocrine or paracrine growth mechanisms. Imatinib mesylate was previously reported to have specific activity in inhibiting select tyrosine kinase receptors, including PDGF and c-Kit. Melanoma cells express abundant levels of the PDGF receptor (PDGFR). Nevertheless, c-Kit expression is progressively lost as the cells take on a more highly metastatic phenotype. To investigate the potential of imatinib mesylate as a therapy for melanoma, we studied its effect on the growth of melanoma cells using an in vivo mouse model. Melanoma cells with high malignant potential (PDGFR-positive, c-Kit-negative) or low malignant potential (PDGFR-positive, c-Kit-positive) were injected subcutaneously into athymic nude mice. Mice were treated with imatinib mesylate (100 mg/kg three times weekly) or with phosphate-buffered saline for 4 to 6 wk. PDGFR-alpha and -beta were expressed on all melanoma cell lines tested. The level of PDGFR expression correlated with the metastatic potential of the melanoma cells: higher levels of PDGFR-alpha were expressed on cells with higher metastatic potential, and higher levels of PDGFR-beta were expressed on cells with lower metastatic potential. There was no significant difference in tumor size between treated and control mice. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated inhibition of PDGFR phosphorylation on the tumors from mice treated with imatinib mesylate but not from control mice, suggesting that the receptors were functional and that the concentration of drug used was appropriate. Our data demonstrated that imatinib mesylate blocked both PDGFR-alpha and PDGFR-beta in vivo. It did not, however, affect the growth of melanoma cells expressing PDGFR, regardless of whether the cells expressed c-Kit.",

Recent studies have identified the KIT (CD117) as a marker that distinguishes nonneoplastic from neoplastic mast cells in human systemic mastocytosis. In this study, we conclude that immunohistopathology assays for KIT staining pattern are useful complimentary tools for diagnosis and evaluation of prognosis in uterus mast cell tumor (MCT) metastasis to the liver in 10 patients. Uterine and hepatic cytology revealed mast cell neoplasia, which was confirmed as visceral mast cell tumor on postmortem examination. Histological changes of densely packed, poorly differentiated neoplastic mast cells, sheets of neoplastic round to pleomorphic cells that formed nonencapsulated nodules, high mitotic figures, necrosis, and fibrosis were found. In addition, eosinophils were scattered among the mast cells at the periphery of the nodules. These findings indicate tumors of high-grade malignancy with infiltrative cells resembling the uterus MCT in the intraparenchymal and periparenchymal areas of the liver. Immunohistochemically, tumors were positive for KIT. The histopathologic features coupled with the KIT immunoreactivity led to diagnosis of high-grade uterus MCTs. Taken together, these findings suggest that CD117 may play a critical role in early uterus MCT development and may be a stimulatory factor in grade 3 MCT. Therefore, the result has supported our hypothesis that there was an increased opportunity to observe a higher CD117 staining pattern in high-grade MCTs. ",

Mast cells are distinct hematopoietic cells and express a unique profile of antigens. Growth and differentiation of normal mast cells is dependent on mast cell growth factor (MGF), the ligand of the c-kit protooncogene product. In this study, we screened for mast cell-lineage involvement in 52 patients suffering from myeloid leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), systemic mastocytosis, or other diseases by probing for mast cell-related molecules (c-kit, tryptase, histamine, and MGF) and by analyzing kit ligand/MGF-independent growth of mast cells in long-term suspension culture. Of the 52 patients tested, 2 patients with refractory anemia with excess of blast cells in transformation and 1 patient suffering from chronic myeloid leukemia blast crisis (CML-BC) were diagnosed as mastocytic disease. These patients were characterized by complex chromosomal abnormalities, splenomegaly, high percentages of circulating metachromatic cells (5% to 25%), high levels of cellular tryptase (> 10 ng/10(5) peripheral blood mononuclear cells/mL) and a tryptase/histamine (ng:ng) ratio greater than 1. The metachromatic cells expressed the mast-cell-related surface antigen c-kit, but not basophil-related antigens (CD11b, CDw17). Furthermore, in these 3 patients, spontaneous, MGF-independent growth of mast cells along with spontaneous synthesis of tryptase was demonstrable in long-term culture. No autocrine production, paracrine production, or overproduction of MGF was found. The spontaneous growth of mast cells could neither be abbrogated by addition of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to c-kit nor by MoAbs against MGF (< 5% inhibition), whereas factor (MGF)-dependent differentiation of mast cells in these patients could be abbrogated by MoAbs to c-kit or MoAbs to MGF (> 70% inhibition, P < .001). In addition, serum MGF levels in these patients were within the normal range and MGF could not be detected in cell-free culture supernatants. All 3 patients showed rapid progression of disease and had a survival time of less than 1 year. In conclusion, we describe a unique form of transformation in MDS and CML-BC characterized by mast cell lineage involvement and factor-independent differentiation of mast cells. This form of leukemic transformation has to be delineated from chronic myeloid leukemia with basophilia or basophil crisis, from primary mast cell leukemia, and from monocytic leukemias and myelodysplastic disorders associated with basophilia.",

They can reoccur after surgery or radiation, current treatments each with significant inherent risks. These risks are further amplified in neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), a germ line predisposition syndrome characterized by multiple schwannomas, underlying the need for biological targeted therapies. Gleevec (STI571, imatinib mesylate), in addition to the bcr-abl oncogene in chronic myelogenous leukemia, inhibits c-kit and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) signaling, thereby expanding its use to several malignant and benign human diseases. In the present study, we show that human sporadic and NF2-associated schwannomas have increased expression along with activation of PDGFR-alpha, PDGFR-beta, and c-kit receptors, compared with normal or traumatic nerve. Using the human NF2-null HEI-193 schwannoma cell line, Gleevec inhibited schwannoma viability, proliferation, and anchorage-independent growth, as well as induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (IC(50) 5-10 micromol/L). These antitumorigenic effects were correlated to inhibition of PDGFR-alpha, PDGFR-beta, and c-kit activation/phosphorylation and major downstream signaling pathways. Lack of robust xenograft or transgenic models of schwannomas prevents extension of these studies in vivo. However, the established long track record and tolerable toxicity of Gleevec already in clinical use and our preclinical data lead us to propose that Gleevec should be evaluated in human schwannomas with shown progressive growth.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors are malignancies originating from stromal/mesenchymal tissues, most commonly in the stomach and small intestine, although they can be located everywhere in the gastrointestinal tract. Diagnosis is based on histological and immunohistochemical examination, and these rare tumors are characterized by c-kit (CD117) staining. Complete removal of the tumor is often curative in localized gastrointestinal stromal tumors and is always recommended. Clinically, their behavior is difficult to predict, and mitotic count and tumor size seem to be the most effective prognostic factors. We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical presentation and course, surgical management and pathological features of patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors treated in our institution from 1995 to 2003. Twenty-two patients were enrolled in the study, and all of them underwent surgery. There were two perioperative deaths, and global morbidity was about 13%. Nineteen patients were followed (mean, 31 months): 4 patients had disease progression/recurrence and died, and one patient experienced a local recurrence and was reoperated with a curative intent; 14 patients were disease free. Our experience shows that histological and immunohistochemical examinations are fundamental for a definitive diagnosis and to assess the risk of aggressive behavior. Moreover, our results confirm that in stromal tumors complete surgical resection remains the mainstay of treatment in localized gastrointestinal stromal tumors, although the recurrence rate is relatively high. It is conceivable that treatment and prognosis of metastatic and non-resectable gastrointestinal stromal tumors, as well as the adjuvant treatment of high-risk, radically excised gastrointestinal stromal tumors will be strongly impacted by the c-kit target therapy.",

De novo ASXL1 mutations cause Bohring-Opitz syndrome characterized by multiple congenital malformations. We show that Asxl1 deletion in mice led to developmental abnormalities including dwarfism, anophthalmia, and 80% embryonic lethality. Surviving Asxl1(-/-) mice lived for up to 42 days and developed features of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), including dysplastic neutrophils and multiple lineage cytopenia. Asxl1(-/-) mice had a reduced hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) pool, and Asxl1(-/-) HSCs exhibited decreased hematopoietic repopulating capacity, with skewed cell differentiation favoring granulocytic lineage. Asxl1(+/-) mice also developed mild MDS-like disease, which could progress to MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm, demonstrating a haploinsufficient effect of Asxl1 in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies. Asxl1 loss led to an increased apoptosis and mitosis in Lineage(-)c-Kit(+) (Lin(-)c-Kit(+)) cells, consistent with human MDS. Furthermore, Asxl1(-/-) Lin(-)c-Kit(+) cells exhibited decreased global levels of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 and altered expression of genes regulating apoptosis (Bcl2, Bcl2l12, Bcl2l13). Collectively, we report a novel ASXL1 murine model that recapitulates human myeloid malignancies, implying that Asxl1 functions as a tumor suppressor to maintain hematopoietic cell homeostasis.

Steel factor (SF) or Kit ligand is produced as a membrane-bound form (mSF) and a soluble form. Because both primary gynecological tumors and primary leukemic cells from patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) have been shown to coexpress c-Kit and SF, we addressed the question of whether mSF could contribute to cell interaction in these cancers. Investigations on primary cervical carcinomas have been hindered by the fact that the cells do not grow in culture. We report herein the establishment of two cervical carcinoma cell lines, CALO and INBL, that reproduce the pattern of SF/c-Kit expression observed in primary tumor samples. In addition, these cells exhibit marked density-dependent growth much in the same way as AML blasts. Using an antisense strategy with phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides that specifically target SF without affecting other surface markers, we provide direct evidence for a role of mSF and c-Kit in cell interaction and cell survival in these gynecological tumor cell lines as well as in primary AML blasts. Finally, our study defines the importance of juxtacrine stimulation, which may be as important, if not more, than autocrine stimulation in cancers.",

Although the microscopic features have been known for a long time, the defining characteristic of GIST is the presence of the cell-surface antigen CD117 (KIT), which is demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. KIT, which is a growth factor transmembrane receptor, is the product of the proto-oncogene c-kit (chromosome 4). Surgical removal remains the only curative treatment for patients with GISTs. Tumor size, mitotic index, anatomic location, tumor rupture and disease-free interval are the classic characteristics used to predict the clinical course of patients who undergo complete gross resection. Most GISTs express constitutively activated mutant isoforms of KIT or kinase platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) that are potential therapeutic targets for imatinib mesylate. Imatinib mesylate is a rationally designed, molecularly specific oral anticancer agent that selectively inhibits several protein tyrosine kinases central to the pathogenesis of human cancer and which has demonstrated remarkable clinical efficacy in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia and malignant GISTs. More recently Sunitinib, a new KIT/PDGFRA kinase inhibitor, has been tested in patients with GIST resistant to imatinib, with promising results.",

This mutation is seen independently of metastasis and/or recurrence of tumors; thus, the factors involved in tumor proliferation rate and malignancy are still not known. Some mesenchymal and epithelial tumors have been reported to co-express KIT and its ligand, stem cell factor (SCF), for autonomous proliferation by the autocrine mechanism. The purpose of this study is to clarify whether GIST cells produce SCF, despite mutated KIT with constitutive activation. Immunohistochemically, we examined the co-expression of KIT and SCF in 36 GIST cases. All cases were found to be KIT-positive, and of these, 21 cases, including four recurrent or metastatic GISTs, showed co-expression of SCF. MIB-1 labeling index was significantly higher, and the average tumor size was larger in SCF-positive cases. By confocal microscopy, KIT was expressed on the cellular membrane, around which SCF was distributed less densely. Western blot analysis revealed that the membrane-bound SCF of 31 kDa was found to be approximately 10 times more abundant than the soluble SCF of 18.5 kDa, suggesting continuous KIT activation. These results indicate that proliferation of GIST cells can be caused not only by the gain-of-function mutation of c-kit, but also by the autocrine mechanism of the SCF/KIT system. Thus, SCF expression would be a useful marker for tumor proliferation.",

However, delineation of high-grade renal cell carcinomas such as collecting duct (Bellini) carcinoma from urothelial cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis is critical, as it conveys important therapeutic implications. We assessed the so far neglected differential diagnostic role of protein gene product 9.5, a neuropeptide involved in intracellular proteolysis, in terms of differentiating invasive urothelial cell carcinomas of the renal pelvis from high-grade renal cell carcinomas infiltrating the renal medullary/sinus region. To this aim, 21 invasive urothelial cell carcinomas of the renal pelvis and 27 high-grade renal cell carcinomas (8 renal cell carcinomas with sarcomatoid dedifferentiation and 5 type 1 and 7 type 2 papillary renal cell carcinomas as well as 7 collecting duct carcinomas) were stained with antibodies directed against protein gene product 9.5, CD10, vimentin, CEA, p63, CK5/6, CK7, CK20, PAX2, PAX8, CD117 (c-Kit), AE1/3, α-methyl CoA racemase, actin, and desmin. Briefly, strong protein gene product 9.5 expression was observed in 6 (86%) of 7 collecting duct carcinomas, 8 (67%) of 12 papillary renal cell carcinomas, and 2 (25%) of 8 renal cell carcinomas with sarcomatoid dedifferentiation. Conversely, none of the 21 urothelial cell carcinomas investigated showed protein gene product 9.5 expression. Our findings suggest that protein gene product 9.5, particularly if used in conjunction with p63 and CK5/6, might be helpful in differentiating high-grade renal cell carcinomas from urothelial cell carcinomas of the renal pelvis, whereas its specificity with respect to the histologic subtyping of renal cell carcinomas seems to be low. However, because of the limited number of study cases enrolled in our investigation, our findings need to be validated in the future.",

Little, however, is known about the prevalence and clinical implications of CD117 in stage I adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. We evaluated 201 consecutive stage I adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung for CD117 immunoreactivity (dichotomized as negative or positive if containing less than 5% or >/=5% immunoreactive neoplastic cells, respectively), also taking into account the pattern (either membranous or cytoplasmic), and the intensity of immunostaining in comparison with intratumoral mast cells. The immunostaining results were then correlated with tumor biopathological characteristics and patients' survival. Membranous CD117 immunoreactivity was documented in 19 (22%) of 88 adenocarcinomas and 15 (13%) of 113 squamous cell carcinomas, whereas cytoplasmic labelling was seen in 28 (32%) adenocarcinomas and eight (7%) squamous cell carcinomas. In both tumor types, membranous or cytoplasmic CD117 immunoreactivity was associated with higher proliferative fraction and with features of more aggressive tumor behavior, including higher stage, size and grade, occurrence of clinical symptoms, high microvessel density and neuroendocrine differentiation. Furthermore, immunoreactive tumors exhibited increased levels of bcl-2, cyclin-E, Her-2, p27(Kip1) and fascin, the latter being a marker of tumor cell metastatization in lung cancer. Membranous but not cytoplasmic labelling emerged as an independent risk factor for death and reduced time to progression in adenocarcinoma but not in squamous cell carcinoma patients, when singly adjusted for confounding factors. CD117 immunoreactivity identifies a peculiar subset of stage I adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung with highly proliferative tumors and may have prognostic relevance in adenocarcinoma patients. Targeting the CD117 pathway could be a novel therapeutic strategy in a subset of pulmonary carcinomas.",

The peripheral solid portion was hypointense on T2-weighted images and not hyperintense on diffusion-weighted images, suggesting low cellularity of the lesion. Cytological examination of the clear and serous fluid obtained by transrectal biopsy showed the presence of normal columnar and squamous epithelial cells and the absence of malignant cells. Therefore, the cystic retrorectal mass was presumed to be tailgut cysts rather than gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). The mass and rectum were extirpated en bloc with an adequate surgical margin by laparoscopic intersphincteric resection. Pathologically, spindle tumor cells proliferated with nuclear palisading and were strongly immunopositive for c-kit, leading to a final diagnosis of rectal GIST.

Kit is a convenient target in Kit-induced tumors and inhibition of this receptor with the small molecule drug Gleevec (imatinib mesylate, STI571) in GIST has shown dramatic efficacy.

Further understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying Kit-mediated transformation is therefore important and may lead to the identification of further novel drug targets. These Kit-specific signaling pathways may then be targeted to overcome potential drug resistance. This review will focus on our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in transformation by Kit. The potential mechanisms by which Kit induces cellular transformation are described. We will also discuss the role and expression of Kit in various malignancies. Ultimately, the understanding of c-Kit biology, biochemistry, and mutational analysis will lead to better therapeutics.",

Staining for synaptophysin, chromogranin A, TTF1, c-kit, CD44, and p16 was performed. Analyses for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 5 polymorphic microsatellite markers (D3S1300, D9S171, D11S914, D13S319, and TP53) and X-chromosome inactivation were performed. Of 17 cases with available blocks, 13 (76%) were synaptophysin+, 8 (47%) were chromogranin A+, 8 (47%) were TTF1+, 7 (41%) were c-kit+, and 6 (35%) were CD44+. Strong patchy or strong diffuse p16 staining was seen in all cases. LOH and X-chromosome inactivation analysis were performed for 17 cases, 8 of which had a coexisting squamous or adenocarcinoma component. Five of the 8 (63%) cases with 2 components showed allelic loss in both components. All 5 of these cases demonstrated identical LOH between the neuroendocrine and squamous or adenocarcinoma components. Nonrandom X-chromosome inactivation was seen in the neuroendocrine and other components in 4 of the 8 cases. In all 4 cases the pattern of inactivation was identical between the 2 components. Cervical neuroendocrine carcinomas have features similar to other extrapulmonary neuroendocrine carcinomas, including expression of TTF1, c-kit, and CD44. Consistent staining for p16 is also seen. Concordant genetic alterations support common clonal origin for neuroendocrine carcinomas with a coexisting squamous or adenocarcinoma component. ",

Adjunct methods are needed for accurate typing of renal cell carcinomas (RCC) and benign neoplasms. Cytopathological diagnoses of 79 routine ultrasound-guided FNAB of renal lesions were compared to consequent histological diagnosis and size of tumors. Cytology samples were sufficient for immunocytochemical subtyping in 43 cases (54.4%). The median tumor size was 2.8 cm, with 57 cases (76%) smaller than or equal to 4 cm. When a panel of immunocytochemical stainings (vimentin, CK7, CD117, P504S) was applied, accurate diagnoses were obtained in 11/12 (91.7%) of clear cell RCC (CRCC), 14/17 (82.3%) of papillary RCC (PRCC) and 5/7 (71.4%) of chromophobe RCC (ChRCC), respectively. Substantial cell pleomorphism with unusual immunostainings led to erroneous diagnosis of pheochromocytoma in CRCC with eosinophilic cytoplasm. Only 30% of CRCC were correctly diagnosed in the group without immunostaining, seven were suspicious for CRCC, and the remainder had unrepresentative material for CRCC. Cytopathological diagnoses were less accurate in oncocytomas (n=11), regardless of immunocytochemical staining. Cystic nephromas (n=2) and MEST (n=1) were overdiagnosed as suspicious and positive for PRCC, respectively, with immunocytochemical staining not assisting in correct diagnosis. RCC can be accurately typed as CRCC, PRCC or ChRCC in fine needle aspirates in a routine clinical setting if the cellular material is sufficient and a panel of antibodies is used (vimentin, CK7, P504S, CD117). The classification of oncocytomas and cystic nephromas is not reliable since atypical morphology and immunocytochemical reactions overlap with RCC.",

Tumor circumscription, compact tubular architecture, focal papillations, mucin production and foam cells (features seen in both papillary renal cell carcinoma and mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma), as well as spindle cell morphology, have resulted in some cases sent to us in consultation with a question of possible sarcomatoid papillary renal cell carcinoma. In this study, tissue microarrays with triplicate samples each from 27 mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinomas and 20 papillary renal cell carcinomas were created to simulate experience in renal biopsy specimens. From immunohistochemistry (IHC) data, published in the contemporary literature, a panel consisting of alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR), cytokeratin 7 (CK7), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), renal cell carcinoma marker (RCC Ma), CD10, high molecular weight cytokeratin (HMWK), and c-kit was designed to test its utility in differential diagnosis. The immunoreactivity in mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma was AMACR 93%, CK7 81%, EMA 95%, RCC Ma 7%, CD10 15%, HMWK 15%, and c-kit 5% and in papillary renal cell carcinoma was AMACR 95%, CK7 65%, EMA 88%, RCC Ma 25%, CD10 80%, HWMK 15%, and c-kit 18%. This largest study to date on IHC of mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma dispels the specificity of AMACR for papillary renal cell carcinoma among the RCC subtypes. The histogenesis of mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma from the distal nephron continues to be debatable, as our study showed the expression of the proximal convoluted tubule-related marker AMACR among these tumors. Thus, in tumors with predominant compact tubular growth and focal papillary architectures, careful attention to the presence of a low-grade spindle cell population may be helpful in the distinction of mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma, as the key immunohistochemical stains for papillary renal cell carcinoma are also expressed in this subtype of renal cell carcinoma.",

Carcinoma in situ cells will develop into invasive seminoma/nonseminoma. Gonadoblastoma (GB) is the precursor of invasive GCTs in dysgenetic gonads, predominantly dysgerminoma (DG). In this process, part of the Y chromosome (GBY region) is involved, for which TSPY is a candidate gene. A detailed immunohistochemical survey was performed for the known diagnostic markers, germ cell/placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), c-KIT, and OCT3/4, as well as testis-specific protein on the Y chromosome (TSPY) on a series of GBs, and adjacent invasive DGs. All 5 patients were XY individuals (4 females and 1 male). In contrast to c-KIT, PLAP was positive in all cases. The immature germ cells of GBs were positive for OCT3/4, whereas the mature germ cells were negative for this marker, but positive for TSPY. In every GB, a minor population of germ cells positive for both markers could be identified, similar to most CIS cells and early invasive DG. On progression to an invasive tumor, TSPY can be lost, a process that is also detectable in invasive testicular GCTs compared to CIS. These results indicate that GB is a heterogeneous mix of germ cells, in which the OCT3/4-positive cells have the potential to undergo progression to an invasive tumor. These early invasive stages are initially also positive for TSPY (like CIS), supporting a positive selection mechanism. Therefore, OCT3/4 in combination with TSPY is valuable to identify malignant germ cells in dysgenetic gonads. This could allow better prediction of the risk of progression to a GCT. In addition, the data support the model that GB represents the earliest accessible developmental stage of malignant GCTs.",

Because of the paucity of reported cases, the clinical behavior, molecular alterations, and potential therapies for this malignancy are not well understood. Eight cases of sarcomatoid carcinoma involving the upper urinary tract were studied. Clinicopathologic characteristics were reviewed. Immunohistochemical expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu, c-kit, and p53 was analyzed in each case. Evaluation for amplification of EGFR and HER2 genes was performed by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Each tumor was also examined for gains of chromosomes 3, 7, and 17 and for loss of chromosome 9p21 by UroVysion FISH (Vysis, Downers Grove, IL). The patients we studied were 5 females and 3 males, ranging in age from 56 to 78 years (mean age, 69 years). Presenting symptoms included gross hematuria, flank mass, urinary obstruction, fever, or sepsis. Radical nephroureterectomy was performed on all patients. Tumor size ranged from 2 to 13 cm. Coexisting urothelial carcinoma was present in all 8 cases. Heterologous osteosarcoma was identified in 2 cases. Pathologic stage was pT4 in 5 cases and pT3 in 3 cases. Lymph node metastases were present in 5 patients at the time of surgery. Of 8 patients, 7 died within 2 years after surgery. EGFR immunostaining had moderately to strongly positive results in 6 of 8 cases. Both HER2/neu and c-kit immunostaining had negative results in all cases. p53 immunostaining had positive results in 5 of 8 cases. The EGFR polysomy was demonstrated in 7 of 8 cases. No amplification of HER2/neu was present in any case. UroVysion FISH showed abnormalities typical of urothelial carcinoma in all 8 cases. In conclusion, the prognosis of sarcomatoid carcinoma of the upper urinary tract is extremely poor, most patients died within 2 years (7/8 patients). Gains of chromosome 3, 7, and 17 and loss of chromosome 9p21 were commonly observed in these tumors.

Our analysis of 27 melanoma cell lines showed no correlation between AP2 and c-kit expression. Suggesting a post-transcriptional mechanism of cKit down-modulation, we performed genome-wide microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling and found that several miRNA species are commonly up-regulated in melanomas. Among them was mir-221, which can directly interact with c-kit 3'UTR and inhibit cKit protein translation. Observed inverse correlation of the c-kit and mir-221 expression in various melanocytic cells pointed to its involvement in regulation of cKit in melanoma. Moreover, a series of functional assays demonstrated that mir-221 could directly inhibit cKit, p27(Kip1) and, possibly, other pivotal proteins in melanoma. Collectively, the studies presented here indicate that mir-221 could be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of cutaneous melanoma.

Because of the potential for toxicity reduction in gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies, we systematically reviewed the literature on clinical outcomes (survival/toxicity) of PBT.;A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, abstracts from meetings of the American Society for Radiation Oncology, Particle Therapy Co-Operative Group, and American Society of Clinical Oncology was conducted for publications from 2000-2015. Thirty-eight original investigations were analyzed.;Although results of PBT are not directly comparable to historical data, outcomes roughly mirror previous data, generally with reduced toxicities for PBT in some neoplasms. For esophageal cancer, PBT is associated with reduced toxicities, postoperative complications, and hospital stay as compared to photon radiation, while achieving comparable local control (LC) and overall survival (OS). In pancreatic cancer, numerical survival for resected/unresected cases is also similar to existing photon data, whereas grade ≥3 nausea/emesis and post-operative complications are numerically lower than those reported with photon RT. The strongest data in support of PBT for HCC comes from phase II trials demonstrating very low toxicities, and a phase III trial of PBT versus transarterial chemoembolization demonstrating trends towards improved LC and progression-free survival (PFS) with PBT, along with fewer post-treatment hospitalizations. Survival and toxicity data for cholangiocarcinoma, liver metastases, and retroperitoneal sarcoma are also roughly equivalent to historical photon controls. There are two small reports for gastric cancer and three for anorectal cancer; these are not addressed further.;Limited quality (and quantity) of data hamper direct comparisons and conclusions. However, the available data, despite the inherent caveats and limitations, suggest that PBT offers the potential to achieve significant reduction in treatment-related toxicities without compromising survival or LC for multiple GI malignancies. Several randomized comparative trials are underway that will provide more definitive answers.",

Aberrant c-Kit activation protects cells from apoptosis and enhances invasion of colon carcinoma cells. Tandutinib is a novel quinazoline-based inhibitor of the type III receptor tyrosine kinases including c-Kit. We determined the effect of tandutinib on colon cancer growth and identified a mechanism of action. Tandutinib inhibited phosphorylation of c-Kit, Akt, mTOR, and p70S6 kinase. In addition, tandutinib significantly inhibited the proliferation and colony formation ability of colon cancer cell lines but did not affect normal colonic epithelial cells. There were increased levels of activated caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl2 ratio, coupled with a reduction in cyclin D1, suggesting apoptosis. There was also a downregulation of COX-2, VEGF, and interleukin-8 expression, suggesting effects on cancer-promoting genes. In addition, overexpressing constitutively active Akt partially suppressed tandutinib-mediated colon cancer cell growth. In vivo, intraperitoneal administration of tandutinib significantly suppressed growth of colon cancer tumor xenografts. There was a reduction in CD31-positive blood vessels, suggesting that there was an effect on angiogenesis. Tandutinib treatment also inhibited the expression of cancer-promoting genes COX-2 and VEGF and suppressed the activation of Akt/mTOR signaling proteins in the xenograft tissues. Together, these data suggest that tandutinib is a novel potent therapeutic agent that can target the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway to inhibit tumor growth and angiogenesis.",

In the dermis of rasH2 mice, mast cells are recruited constitutively, and the number of mast cells increases more than in wild-type mice in response to treatment with 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. To determine whether enhanced skin tumor development in rasH2 mice is dependent on the recruitment of mast cells, we generated rasH2 KIT(W/Wv) mice by crossing rasH2 mice and W or W(v) KIT mutants, and examined the chemical skin carcinogenesis. In rasH2 KIT(W/Wv) mice, mast cells were not found in the dermis either before or after treatment with 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Papilloma multiplicity was up to 4.6-fold higher in rasH2 KIT(+/+) mice compared with their rasH2 KIT(W/Wv) siblings. At 12 weeks after the experiment began, the volumes of tumors were significantly smaller in rasH2 KIT(W/Wv) relative to rasH2 KIT(+/+) mice (rasH2 KIT(W/Wv): 29.2 +/- 19.9 mm(3) versus rasH2 KIT(+/+): 179.6 +/- 726.6 mm(3); P = 0.0153). There was no difference in the latency or multiplicity of papillomas between mice without the rasH2 transgene, KIT(W/Wv) mice and their wild-type littermates. Western blot analysis showed that expression of H-RAS protein in the skin was equivalent in rasH2 KIT(W/Wv) and rasH2 KIT(+/+) mice. In conclusion, the inhibition of c-kit decreased H-ras-induced skin carcinogenesis. The suppression of c-kit may be a unique and effective target as a preclinical model of cancer treatment where the activation of H-ras has a significant role. Targeting mast cells could also be a potential strategy for treating malignancies.",

NF1 encodes a GTPase activating protein (GAP) for Ras. Consistent with Knudson's \"two hit\" model of tumor suppressor genes, leukemias and malignant solid tumors in NF1 patients frequently demonstrate somatic loss of the normal NF1 allele. However, the phenotypic and biochemical consequences of heterozygous inactivation of Nf1 are largely unknown. Recently neurofibromin, the protein encoded by NF1, was shown to negatively regulate Ras activity in Nf1-/- murine myeloid hematopoietic cells in vitro through the c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase (dominant white spotting, W). Since the W and Nf1 locus appear to function along a common developmental pathway, we generated mice with mutations at both loci to examine potential interactions in vivo. Here, we show that haploinsufficiency at Nf1 perturbs cell fates in mast cells in vivo, and partially rescues coat color and mast cell defects in W(41) mice. Haploinsufficiency at Nf1 also increased mast cell proliferation, survival, and colony formation in response to Steel factor, the ligand for c-kit. Furthermore, haploinsufficiency was associated with enhanced Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase activity, a major downstream effector of Ras, via wild-type and mutant (W(41)) c-kit receptors. These observations identify a novel interaction between c-kit and neurofibromin in vivo, and offer experimental evidence that haploinsufficiency of Nf1 alters both cellular and biochemical phenotypes in two cell lineages that are affected in individuals with NF1. Collectively, these data support the emerging concept that heterozygous inactivation of tumor suppressor genes may have profound biological effects in multiple cell types.",

The SKOV3 sphere cells were selected using 40.0 micromol/l cisplatin and 10.0 micromol/l paclitaxel in serum-free culture system supplemented with epidermal growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, and insulin or standard serum-containing system. These cells formed non-adherent spheres under drug selection (cisplatin and paclitaxel) and serum-free culture system. The selected sphere cells are more resistant to cisplatin, paclitaxel, adriamycin, and methotrexate. Importantly, the sphere cells have the properties of self-renewal, with high expression of the stem cell genes Nanog, Oct4, sox2, nestin, ABCG2, CD133, and the stem cell factor receptor CD117 (c-kit). Consistently, flow cytometric analysis revealed that the sphere cells have a much higher percentage of CD133(+)/CD117(+)-positive cells (71%) than differentiated cells (33%). Moreover, the SKOV3 sphere cells are more tumorigenic. Furthermore, cDNA microarray and subsequent ontological analyses revealed that a large proportion of the classified genes were related to angiogenesis, extracellular matrix, integrin-mediated signaling pathway, cell adhesion, and cell proliferation. The subpopulation isolation from the SKOV3 cell line under this culture system offers a suitable in vitro model for studying ovarian CSCs in terms of their survival, self-renewal, and chemoresistance, and for developing therapeutic drugs that specifically interfere with ovarian CSCs.",

Discovery of the protooncogene c-kit and the presence of the CD117 protein on the neoplastic cells of the majority of gastrointestinal stromal tumours may suggest their possible origin from Cajal cells. The clinical symptoms of gastrointestinal stromal tumours are related to tumour size and are generally aspecific: acute or chronic bleeding, abdominal pain and palpable mass are some of the most common signs. Digestive endoscopy or US-endoscopy for gastroduodenal tumours, ultrasonography and CT scans are the procedures of choice in the evaluation of the location, size, invasion of adjacent organs and metastases. Surgery is the only curative therapy for gastrointestinal stromal tumours.

We present a case of a rare extragastrointestinal stromal tumor (EGIST) located in the pelvic cavity of a kidney transplant patient. A 57-year-old female patient was admitted to our department because of non-specific lower abdominal pain 6 months after renal transplantation. An abdominal computed tomography scan showed a 4.5 cm diameter pelvic tumor mass. The tumor was resected en bloc and confirmed as not being connected to the gastrointestinal wall. Microscopically, the tumor consisted of typical spindle cells with 2-3 mitotic figures per 50 high-power fields. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were strongly positive for CD117 (c-kit), and negative for CD34, SMA, s-100 protein, and desmin. Genetically, the tumor showed a silent mutation in exon 18 of the PDGFRA gene at codon 824 GTC > GTT (V824V) [rs2228230]. No recurrence was noted 24 months after the operation. This case draws our attention to the importance of considering EGISTs (including GISTs), even though they are extremely uncommon, in the differential diagnosis of mesenchymal neoplasms, especially in transplant patients.",

From both human parotid and submandibular gland cell suspensions salispheres could be grown, which when placed in 3D culture developed ductal structures and mucin-expressing acinar-like cells. Moreover, cells dispersed from primary salispheres were able to form secondary spheres in matrigel, a procedure that could be repeated for at least seven passages. Approximately 3000 c-Kit+ cells could be isolated from primary human salispheres per biopsy.;Human salivary glands contain a similar 'putative' stem cell population as rodents, expressing c-kit and capable of in vitro differentiation and self-renewal.

The question addressed was 'Do thymic malignancies respond to target therapies?' Altogether, 347 papers were found using the reported search, of which, in our opinion, 16 papers represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers were tabulated. We did not find any randomized controlled trials on target therapies for the thymic malignancies, due to the very small incidence of this tumour, and it seems unlikely that there will be any such trials in the foreseeable future. Three studies on target therapies showed that several cases of thymic malignancies were reported to have partial response (PR) to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as cetuximab and erlotinib, whereas, one study on erlotinib and another on gefitinib showed no activity. Proto-oncogene c-KIT (KIT) mutant thymic carcinomas were noted to benefit from target therapies, implying that systematic sequencing of KIT in thymic carcinoma tumours may be warranted for optimal patient selection. A study that investigated the efficacy of cixutumumab, a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, indicated that relapsed thymomas tended to respond, whereas thymic carcinoma did not. The antiangiogenesis agent belinostat had modest antitumour activity in heavily pretreated thymoma, but no response to thymic carcinoma was found. Several cases with metastatic thymic carcinoma showed that multitargeted kinase inhibitors, such as sunitinib and sorafenib, were effective. We concluded that, as the side-effects of the agents were tolerable in almost all reported cases, target therapies can be an option for patients with heavily pretreated thymoma. ",

However, there is sparse literature on triple-negative lobular carcinoma (TNLC), as most of them show hormone receptor expression. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation of clinicopathologic parameters of TNLC that has been demonstrated in invasive ductal carcinoma.;Clinicopathologic parameters and immunohistochemical stains for ER, PR, E-cadherin, HER2, MIB1, and fluorescent in situ hybridization for HER2 of 255 ILC cases were retrieved. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis was performed for p53, c-kit, vimentin, p16, cyclinD1, and BCL2 on 78 cases where 12 were TNC cases and 66 were non-TNC cases.;Of the 255 ILC cases, 218 (85.5%) were classic and 37 (14.5%) were pleomorphic.

According to their immunophenotype, the tumors were classified as GISTs, which are characterized by CD117 (c-kit) expression; gastrointestinal CD117-negative CD34 positive stromal tumors (GINST); alpha-smooth muscle actin and/or desmin positive gastrointestinal leiomyogenic tumors (GILT); S-100 and glial fibrillary acidic protein positive gastrointestinal glial/schwannian tumors (GIGT); gastrointestinal neuronal/glial tumors (GINT), which are positive for S-100/glial fibrillary acidic protein plus neuronal/glial markers; and gastrointestinal fibrous tumors (GIFT), which are only vimentin positive. The most common type of tumors were GIST, followed in order of frequency by GINST, GILT, GIGT, GIFT, and GINT. GISTs did not show any preferential location, whereas GINSTs occurred almost exclusively in the stomach and duodenum, and GILTs preferentially in the large intestine. Over a median follow-up period of 71 months, malignant behavior, i.e., metastatic spread, was observed in all tumor types except GINTs. Malignancy was associated with distal gut location, high mitotic activity, large tumor size, and nuclear pleomorphism, though none of these criteria alone discriminated between benign and malignant.

Imatinib induces, rapid and sustained clinical benefit by blocking the signaling via c-KIT. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (>30%) include edema, nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, rash, fatigue and abdominal pain.;Herein, we report a case series of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) occurring secondary to imatinib in two patients treated for GISTs.

We investigated KIT expression in a group of patients with early-stage malignant melanoma. Primary tumour specimens obtained from 261 radically resected patients with stage I and II malignant melanoma were examined for KIT expression. Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissues were stained with the polyclonal rabbit anti-human anti-KIT antibody (Dako Cytomation Inc., Carpenteria, California, USA). Patients were classified into four groups according to the level of expression (0%, <30%, 30-60% and >60%). Univariate and multivariate analyses examining the impact of KIT expression, Breslow thickness, Clark level and microscopic ulceration on disease-free survival were performed. Within the population of 261 patients with early-stage melanoma with 62 recurrences during a follow-up of 64 months, KIT expression was found in 144 cases (55%). KIT was expressed in more than 60% of cells in 20 patients (8%), in 30-60% of cells in 64 patients (24%) and in less than 30% of cells in 60 patients (23%). KIT expression was not found in 117 patients (45%). In univariate analyses, the influence of KIT expression on disease-free survival was not proven (P=0.4956; log-rank test). Increasing Breslow thickness, a higher Clark level, the presence of microscopic ulceration and a higher stage were significantly associated with a shorter disease-free survival (P<0.0001; log-rank test in all cases). In multivariate analysis, Breslow thickness, stage and KIT expression were significant negative prognostic factors for a shorter disease-free survival (P<0.0001, P=0.0028, P=0.0488, respectively; stepwise Cox regression model). It can be concluded that KIT is expressed in more than one-half of early-stage malignant melanoma. KIT may serve as an additive prognostic factor to Breslow thickness and stage within the tested population. The therapeutic impact of KIT expression in malignant melanoma is uncertain.

The epithelial component consisted of trabeculae and islands of well-differentiated squamous epithelium immunoreactive to cytokeratins. The melanocytic component had a varying degree of pigmentation of polygonal and spindle-shaped cells, growing in nests or densely packed aggregates and immunolabelled with S100, melanoma-associated antigen (melan A), neuron-specific enolase and vimentin antibodies. Protein markers involved in tumorigenesis or cell proliferation (i.e. COX-2, p53, c-kit and Ki67), were overexpressed by the neoplastic cells.

Nuclear overexpression of the Wnt effector beta-catenin and deregulated beta-catenin nuclear signaling can promote malignant transformation in solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. However, a role for beta-catenin in mast cell leukemia has not been described. Nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin is upregulated by its tyrosine phosphorylation, a process that can be exacerbated by deregulated expression of oncogenic tyrosine kinases. Here, we investigated the relationship between activated KIT and beta-catenin signaling in mast cell leukemia. Beta-catenin was tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells with KIT activated by either gain-of-function mutation or incubation with the KIT ligand stem cell factor. Beta-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation depended on KIT activity but not on PI3K-AKT activation. Tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin was associated with its nuclear localization and enhanced transcription of target genes c-myc and cyclin D1. Endogenous KIT and beta-catenin were found to associate in mast cell leukemia cells, and in vitro kinase assay demonstrated that active KIT phosphorylates tyrosine residues of beta-catenin directly. Aberrant beta-catenin-driven transcription caused by deregulated KIT may represent a significant new target for treatment of mast cell leukemia.",

In this study, we investigated the effect of ATRA on highly enriched murine hematopoietic precursor cells (lin-c-kit+Sca-1(+)) grown in liquid suspension culture for 28 days. ATRA initially slowed the growth of these hematopoietic precursors but prolonged and markedly enhanced their colony-forming cell production compared with the hematopoietic precursors cultured in its absence. At 7 and 14 days of culture, a substantially greater percentage of cells cultured with ATRA did not express lineage-associated antigens (55.4% at day 7 and 68.6% at day 14) and retained expression of Sca-1 (44.7% at day 7 and 79.9% at day 14) compared with cells grown in its absence (lin- cells: 31.5% at day 7 and 4% at day 14; Sca-1(+): 10.4% at day 7 and 0.7% at day 14). Moreover, a marked inhibition of granulocyte production was observed in cultures continuously incubated with ATRA. Significantly, ATRA markedly prolonged and enhanced the production of transplantable colony-forming unit-spleen (CFU-S) during 14 days of liquid suspension culture. In contrast with its effects on primitive lin-c-kit+Sca-1(+) hematopoietic precursors, ATRA did not exert the same effects on the more committed lin-c-kit+Sca-1(-) progenitor cells. Moreover, the late addition of ATRA (7 days post-culture initiation) to cultures of primitive hematopoietic precursors resulted in a marked decrease in colony-forming cell production in these cultures, which was associated with enhanced granulocyte differentiation. These observations indicate that ATRA has different effects on hematopoietic cells depending on their maturational state, preventing and/or delaying the differentiation of primitive hematopoietic precursors while enhancing the terminal differentiation of committed granulocyte/monocyte progenitors.",

Abdominal and pelvis CT scans demonstrated a large low-density lesion with extracanalicular growth from the middle rectum, with local lymph-node spread, and without tumour infiltration of other pelvic organs, or evidence of distant intra-abdominal spread. The patient underwent a low anterior resection for rectal cancer together with wide resection of lymph nodes. In immunohistochemical analysis, pankeratin and Epithelial Membrane Antigen (EMA) immunolabeling proved the epithelial nature of the tumor cells. Chromogranin A and Leukocyte Common Antigen (LCA) were negative, whereas CD-56 expression was scanty and Neuron Specific Enolase (NSA) was heavily and diffusely expressed. Ki67 immunoexpression was particularly increased. Interestingly, the intense c-kit immunoreactivity (100%) was a common feature.

GIST tumors express the CD 117 receptor in more than 90% independent of histopathological features and clinical behaviour. This is why it is considered as the most important characteristic. The incidence is 10-20 new cases per 1 million annually. The number of incidents is expected to increase by the establishment of CD117 and other new markers (protein kinase C theta, DOG1).

Reasons for this divergent clinical behavior of childhood- versus adult-onset disease are unknown. Recently, two activating mutations in the intracellular domain of the proto-oncogene c-kit, which encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor for the mast cell growth factor stem cell factor, have been detected in the human leukemic mast cell line HMC-1. We have therefore studied lesional skin biopsies from patients with adult- and childhood-onset indolent mastocytosis for the presence of these codon 560 and 816 mutations. C-kit coding DNA sequences were amplified and analyzed by mutation-specific restriction analyses, and mutated polymerase chain reaction products were additionally cloned and sequenced. The codon 816 mutation was found in all six samples from adult patients, but not in any of the 11 specimens from children. In addition, the codon 560 mutation could be demonstrated for the first time in indolent mastocytosis, namely in two of four specimens from adult patients, but not in those from two children. These data thus provide a possible explanation for the divergent clinical behavior of adult- versus childhood-onset indolent mastocytosis, with the first being associated with an activating mutation, possibly as part of a neoplastic process, and the latter representing most likely a reactive process of an as yet unknown pathogenesis.",

Of the 1342 cases of gastric carcinoma, the histological type was as follows: tubular adenocarcinoma in 755 cases, papillary adenocarcinoma in 176, mucinous adenocarcinoma in 147, signet ring cell carcinoma in 145, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in 114, adenosquamous carcinoma in 4, and metastatic small cell carcinoma from the lung in 1. In surgically resected cases, the number of early gastric carcinomas was 258 and of advanced carcinoma, 521 cases. In GIST (n = 34), there were 2 cases of the epithelioid type and 32 of the spindle cell type. The size of GIST ranged from 1-15 cm, with a mean of 5.6 cm. KIT (CD117) was positive in 34/34 cases, CD34 in 31/34, desmin 2/34, and S100 4/34. A genetic analysis was performed in 6 cases of GIST, all of which showed point mutation of KIT and/or PDGFRA genes. In MALT lymphoma (n = 25), centrocyte-like cells and lymphoepithelial lesions were seen in every case. Helicobactor pylori infection was noted in 92%.

Histologically, the tumor was rich in vasculature and exclusively composed of perivascular epithelioid cells with clear cytoplasm. Immunohistochemically, the tumor expressed diffusely a melanocyte marker, human melanoma black-45, and focally a myogenic marker, alpha-smooth muscle actin, but not an epithelial marker, AE1/AE3. Fontana-Masson-positive melanin pigments were present and c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase (CD117), involved in the development of melanocytes but not myogenic cells, was expressed in tumor cells. These findings indicate that the tumor is PEComa with some differentiation into melanocytes. Notably, owing to the unique location of the occurrence, the tumor occupied bone marrow tissues of the rib, resulting that the tumor has the potential for hematogenous metastasis.

No clear connection with any of the surrounding organs was identified. Malignancy could not be excluded, and surgery was indicated. During surgery, the large mass was found to be attached by a narrow stalk to the large curvature of the stomach. Results. The histological features and immunohistiochemical profile of the tumor cells (positivity for CD117 and CD34) were consistent with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor with a high risk of progressive disease according to the Fletcher classification. Diagnosis was confirmed by mutational analysis; this demonstrated mutation in exon 14 of PDGFRA. During the followup of 97 months, the patient had a cancer-free survival. Conclusions. This case demonstrates that gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) with extensive cystic degeneration should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a cystic abdominal mass.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. They originate from the myenteric ganglion cells, termed the interstitial Cajal cells. The majority, i.e. 95% of GIST, show expression of the membrane receptor protein CD117 with a tyrosine kinase activity c-kit. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors constitute less than 1% of all digestive tract tumors. They may be benign or malignant (30%), and occur in every part of the gastrointestinal tract, however the stomach is the most common localization. They develop with the same prevalence in men and in women, usually above the age of 50 years. The peak incidence is observed between the fifth and the sixth decade of life. Symptoms are not typical and depend on the localization and the tumor size. About 10-30% of GIST are completely asymptomatic, and are discovered accidentally during the endoscopy or X-rays evaluation as well as during surgical interventions performed for various reasons. The malignant tumors metastasize most commonly to the liver and peritoneum. The metastases are rarely found in the lungs, pleura and bones. The detection of GIST is based on imaging, endoscopy, histological and immunohistochemical examinations. A useful and promising diagnostic procedure is positron emission tomography. The final diagnosis is mostly based on the pathologic findings of the removed tumor. The prognosis of GIST depends on its size, mitotic activity in 50 high power fields and mucosal infiltration. Radical surgery is the best treatment of GIST.",

It has been recently reported that sarcomatoid chromophobe RCC frequently show polysomy of chromosomes 1, 2, 6, 10, and 17. In this article, we report an unusual case of chromophobe RCC. A 42-year-old Japanese woman presented with hematuria and complained of inguinal pain 2 months after the initial symptoms. Radical nephrectomy and renal hilar lymphadenectomy were performed. The tumor was 8 cm in greatest diameter; its cut surface was beige in color. Large metastasis to the renal hilar lymph node was identified. Histological examination of the right renal tumor met the criteria of chromophobe RCC. In addition to histological findings of typical chromophobe RCC, small cell foci, comedo-like necrosis, trabecular growth pattern, and sclerosing stroma were observed. However, no sarcomatoid foci were identified anywhere, despite extensive tumor sampling including lymph node lesions. Immunohistochemically, neoplastic cells were positive for E-cadherin and CD117 (c-kit). Ultrastructurally, tumorous cells contained abundant mitochondria and cytoplasmic microvesicles. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed monosomy of chromosomes 2 and 10 and polysomy of chromosome 21. Finally, we suggest that this tumor may show the poorly differentiated or presarcomatoid form of chromophobe RCC.",

Patients were treated with passive scattering PBT with two- or three-field beam arrangement using 180 to 250 MV protons. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to assess time-to-event outcomes and compared the distributions between groups using the log-rank test.;The median follow-up time was 20.1 months for survivors. The median age was 68 years (range, 38-86). Most patients were males (82%) who had adenocarcinomas (76%) and Stage II-III disease (84%). The median radiation dose was 50.4 Gy (RBE [relative biologic equivalence]) (range, 36-57.6). The most common grade 2 to 3 acute toxicities from CChT/PBT were esophagitis (46.8%), fatigue (43.6%), nausea (33.9%), anorexia (30.1%), and radiation dermatitis (16.1%). There were two cases of grade 2 and 3 radiation pneumonitis and two cases of grade 5 toxicities. A total of 29 patients (46.8%) received preoperative CChT/PBT, with one postoperative death. The pathologic complete response (pCR) rate for the surgical cohort was 28%, and the pCR and near CR rates (0%-1% residual cells) were 50%. While there were significantly fewer local-regional recurrences in the preoperative group (3/29) than in the definitive CChT/PBT group (16/33) (log-rank test, p = 0.005), there were no differences in distant metastatic (DM)-free interval or overall survival (OS) between the two groups.;This is the first report of patients treated with PBT/CChT for esophageal cancer.

Canine beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and KIT sequences were cloned into the psiCHECK™-2 vector. SiRNA molecules, designed to target gene-specific sequences, were co-transfected with plasmid DNA into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Renilla and firefly luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-GLO(®) Luciferase Assay (Promega). Using this reporter system, canine housekeeping gene-specific SiRNA molecules demonstrated knockdown of their targets (72.0% knockdown for B2M and 94.5% knockdown for GAPDH). An SiRNA molecule targeting exon 2 of canine KIT successfully knocked-down reporter gene expression of a KIT(26-407) construct (90.8% knockdown). An SiRNA molecule targeting a 48 base-pair in-tandem duplication mutation in KIT exon 11 selectively knocked down expression of the KIT(1569-1966mutant) construct (93.1% knockdown) but had no effect on the KIT(1569-1918wild-type) construct.

We show that host HSC clearance is dependent on Fc-mediated antibody effector functions, and enhancing effector activity through blockade of CD47, a myeloid-specific immune checkpoint, extends anti-c-Kit conditioning to fully immunocompetent mice.

In primary and transformed mast cells, we show that KIT signaling markedly up-regulates MITF protein. We demonstrate that MITF is required for the proliferative phenotype by inhibiting colony-forming units with sh-RNA knockdown of MITF. Furthermore, constitutively active KIT does not restore growth of primary MITF-deficient mast cells. MITF mRNA levels do not change significantly with KIT signaling, suggesting posttranscriptional regulation. An array screen from mast cells identified candidate miRNAs regulated by KIT signaling. We found that miR-539 and miR-381 are down-regulated by KIT signaling and they repressed MITF expression through conserved miRNA binding sites in the MITF 3'-untranslated region. Forced expression of these miRNAs suppressed MITF protein and inhibited colony-forming capacity of mastocytosis cell lines.

The number of deaths due to PBT in a certain year is the sum of the deaths among patients diagnosed in different years. Registered cases in the BTR represent incident cases of PBT in the whole country multiplied by a cover rate. The cover rate is defined as the proportions of PBT cases that the Registry counts in relation to all the cases in the country in a given year. If the survival experience among the registered cases represents the survival experience of all cases, then the rate of registered deaths represents all deaths due to PBT in Japan. By this logic, we estimated the cover rates and incidence rates from 1973 to 1993 using the BTR and National Vital Statistics data. Our estimates showed three patterns of time trends: (1) a gradual linear increasing trend before the 1980s followed by a plateau (total PBT, gliomas, meningioma, and hemangioblastoma), (2) a trend with a step-up increase in the 1980s followed by a plateau (germ cell tumor and pituitary tumor), and (3) a linear increasing trend throughout the observation period with no plateau (malignant lymphoma and neurinoma). Furthermore, obvious sex differences in time trends were observed in rates of meningioma, germ cell tumor, and pituitary tumor. The results of this study demonstrated several distinctive patterns in time trends, which give us insight into the possible etiologies of brain tumors.

When surgery is proposed for FA, periareolar compared to direct incision is associated with more insensitive nipple but better aesthetic results (LE4). When surgery is proposed for FA, indirect incision is preferable for better cosmetic results (Grade C). Techniques of percutaneous destruction or resection can be used (Grade C). The WHO classification distinguishes three categories of phyllodes tumors (PBT): benign (grade 1), borderline (grade 2) and malignant (grade 3). For grade 1 PBT, the risk of local recurrence after surgical excision increases when PBT lesion is in contact with surgical limits (not in sano). After in sano resection, there is no correlation between margin size and the risk of recurrence (LE4). For grade 2 PBT, local recurrence after surgical excision increases for margins under 10mm margins (LE4). For grade 1-2 PBT, in sano excision is recommended. For grade 2 PBT, 10-mm margins are recommended (Grade C). No lymph node evaluation or neither systematic mastectomy is recommended (Grade C). Breast papillary lesion (BPL) without atypia, complete resection of radiologic signal is recommended (Grade C). For BPL with atypia, complete excisional surgery is recommended (Grade C).",

In this study, we investigated the expression and function of TRAIL in human peripheral blood T (PBT) cells. Although freshly isolated PBT cells did not express a detectable level of TRAIL on their surface, a remarkable TRAIL expression was rapidly induced on the surface of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) PBT cells upon stimulation with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody and type I interferons (IFNs). This enhancement of TRAIL expression was a unique feature of type I IFNs (IFN-alpha and IFN-beta), and neither type II IFN (IFN-gamma) nor various other cytokines enhanced TRAIL expression on anti-CD3-stimulated PBT cells. Type I IFNs have been used for clinical treatment of renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), and we found that most RCC cell lines were susceptible to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Type I IFNs substantially augmented cytotoxic activity of anti-CD3-stimulated PBT cells against RCC cell lines in a TRAIL-dependent manner. These results indicate a unique feature of type I IFNs to regulate TRAIL-mediated T cell cytotoxicity, which may be involved in the antitumor effects of type I IFNs against various tumors.",

KIT expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material. Cases were divided into low expressors (0-1+ staining intensity) and high expressors (2-3+ staining intensity). Direct sequencing of exons 9, 11, 13, 17, and 18 of the KIT gene spanning the extracellular, juxtamembrane, and tyrosine kinase domains was performed for cases with high KIT expression. Thirty tumors from 21 patients were analyzed for KIT expression. High KIT expression was seen in 67% of the patients. Five-year survival rates in tumors expressing high versus low levels of KIT were 0% versus 57.8%, respectively; however, this dramatic difference did not reach statistical significance (P = .07). A total of 4 point mutations were identified in 18 tumors analyzed. Two of these were silent mutations involving exons 17 and 18, and 2 involved intron 16-17. Two of the identified mutations may represent novel polymorphisms.

The current study reports the case of a 71-year-old male with gastric poorly differentiated NEC and GIST discovered incidentally during surgical treatment of the NEC. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that the NEC tumor cells were positive for CK (cytokeratin), CD57, synaptophysin, chromogranin, CD117 (KIT protein), Dog-1 (discovered on GIST-1 protein) and CD34. The synchronous GIST immunophenotype showed positivity for CD117, Dog-1 and CD34 (100%), whereas staining for CK, SMA, desmin and S100 was negative. Ki-67 labeling of proliferating cells was 90% in NEC and 1% in GIST. An accurate diagnosis was confirmed by immunohistochemical findings.

The so-called P2 promoter involved is located in intron 12 and its activity was found to be mutually exclusive with activity of the classical promoter (P1), which encodes the full-length receptor. The presence of the 1.5 kb transcript could be a putative marker for the early molecular diagnosis of TGCTs. In order to validate the RT-PCR approach, this study shows that not more than 100 transcripts are necessary to obtain positivity in the test used; moreover, samples from TGCTs or CIS-containing tissues can be diluted many-fold before resulting in false-negative findings. This study also shows that within TGCTs, as in TGCT-derived cell lines, expression of the 1.5 kb transcript is differentiation-dependent and positively correlated with expression of the embryonic transcription factor OCT-4/POU5F1. Furthermore, the results indicate that in some non-TGCT cancers and cell lines the 1.5 kb transcript is also expressed, but without concomitant OCT-4/POU5F1 expression. The 1.5 kb transcript is also present in early B cells and derived leukaemias (B-ALL). In spite of similarities in chromosomal location, down-regulation upon differentiation of TGCTs, and PDGF alpha-receptor and c-KIT (the stem cell factor receptor) both being a tyrosine kinase receptor, no correlation was found between activity of the P2 promoter of the PDGF alpha-receptor gene and expression of c-KIT. In conclusion, the 1.5 kb transcript of the PDGF alpha-receptor is expressed in various cells and tissues, including particular blood cells. Although this may hamper the use of this transcript as a marker for malignancies in general, it does not appear to interfere with assays for the early detection of TGCTs.",

They are divided into benign, borderline malignant and malignant groups. Sometimes it appears difficult to distinguish these tumors from other types of soft tissue sarcomas. Because of the relatively scant data on the role of biological markers in MPT histogenesis, we have decided to undertake the following study, trying to shed more light on the issue by investigating the following elements that make up MPT: their histological patterns, biological behavior, enzymohistochemical, histochemical and immunohistochemical characteristics (ICH) together with the mast cell analysis.;We examined the biopsy material of 35 MPT in our laboratory. Enzymohistochemistry was performed on frozen sections (method of Crowford, Nachlas and Seligman). The used methods were classical hematoxylin-eosin (H & E); histochemical Massontrichrome, Alcian-blue, Periodic acid Schiff and immunohistochemical LSAB2 method (DacoCytomation). Ki-67, c-kit, vimentin, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and Her-2 oncoprotein immunohistochemistry was performed on all tumors.;The patients were ranged per age from 30--62 years (mean 43.3 years, median 39 years). A total of 35 cases of MPT were included: 20 benign (57%), 6 borderline malignant (17%) and 9 malignant (26%). Twenty-two patients (62.8%) underwent segmental mastectomy, while 13 (37.2%) had total mastectomies. Twenty-eight patients had negative surgical margins at original resection. The mean size of malignant MPT (7.8 cm) was larger than that of benign MPT (4.5 cm). Significant features of the malignant MPT were: stromal cellularity, stromal cellular atypism, high mitotic activity, atypic mitoses, stromal overgrowth, infiltrative tumor contour and heterologous stromal elements. Benign MPT showed strong enzymohistochemical Leucine Amino Peptidase (LAP) activity in both epithelial and stromal components while it was weak or absent in the epithelial parts of the malignant tumors. Acid mucopolysacharides were present in the stromal component of all types of these tumors. Benign MPT had a lower Ki-67 than did borderline malignant MPT (4 versus 28). Malignant MPT had a greater than 8-fold higher Ki-67 activity than did benign tumors (35 versus 4). Intracyto-plasmatic c-kit expression was associated with a pathological diagnosis of malignant MPT, correlating with increasing grade (p < 0.05). In hypercellular stroma of borderline malignant and especially malignant forms of MPT, high activity of ER in mast cells was confirmed. Oncoprotein Her-2 activity, mostly in epithelial components, correlated with the degree of malignant progression of MPT (p < 0.05).;Besides the well-known malignant features additional parameters have been found to be high Ki-67 and c-kit stromal expressions, and weak LAP activity in the epithelial part of malignant MPT, as well as mast cells with a high expression of ER.",

Growth factor receptor expression, including PDGF-R, NGF-R, EGF-R, IR, IGF-I-R, TFR and c-kit, was studied by immunohistochemistry and FACSscan analysis. Both groups of substances modulated the expression of some growth factor receptors. Upregulation of PDGF-R was seen after treatment with IFN as well as with RX. In contrast, EGF-R was found to be downregulated in two EGF-R-positive cell lines by IFN and, on the other hand, induced by RX in two EGF-R-negative cell lines. The expression of NGF-R was modulated ambiguously by these substances but demonstrated a cell line specificity in the different melanoma cell lines tested.

The purpose of this study is to examine the additional markers that would be useful for differentiating between thymic carcinoma and thymoma type B3. We performed a tissue microarray analysis of surgically resected thymic tumor specimens from 12 cases of thymic carcinoma, 7 cases of type B3 thymoma, and 68 cases of other types of thymoma. Immunostaining using 49 antibodies was scored based on staining intensity and the percentage of cells that stained positive. Seven proteins that were selected by the staining scores, namely, GLUT-1 (167 vs 4), CA-IX (110 vs 15), c-kit (162 vs 44), CD5 (33 vs 0), MUC-1 (54 vs 0), CEA (42 vs 0), and CK18 (110 vs 42), were significantly higher in the thymic carcinomas than in the type B3 thymomas. The staining sensitivity and specificity of the antibodies for thymic carcinoma were GLUT-1, sensitivity 72% and specificity 100%; CA-IX, 58 and 71%; c-kit, 72 and 85%; CD5, 33 and 100%; CK18, 58 and 71%; MUC-1, 25 and 100%; and CEA, 33 and 100%. Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) is the best marker for thymic carcinoma because it had the highest sensitivity and specificity. Positive immunostaining for a combination of three markers, namely, GLUT-1, CD5, and CEA, enabled differentiation of thymic carcinoma with 91.6% sensitivity and 100% specificity. In conclusion, we identified GLUT-1 as an additional marker that will be useful for differentiating thymic carcinoma from type B3 thymoma, especially in biopsy specimens that have been crushed or are otherwise difficult to examine morphologically in thymic tumors.",

Lnk, a negative regulator of cytokine signaling, plays critical nonredundant roles in hematopoiesis. By binding to phosphorylated tyrosine kinases, Lnk inhibits major cytokine receptor signaling, including c-KIT; erythropoietin receptor-Janus kinase 2 (JAK2); and MPL-JAK2. In the present study, we investigated Lnk expression and possible function in transformed hematopoietic cells.;Coimmunoprecipitations were performed to identify binding between Lnk and mutant tyrosine kinases. Proliferation assays were done to examine the affect of Lnk overexpression on cancer cell growth. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to determine Lnk expression in patient samples.;We show that, in parallel to binding wild-type JAK2 and c-KIT, Lnk associates with and is phosphorylated by mutant alleles of JAK2 and c-KIT. In contrast, Lnk does not bind to and is not phosphorylated by BCR-ABL fusion protein. Ectopic expression of Lnk strongly attenuates growth of some leukemia cell lines, while others as well as most solid tumor cancer cell lines are either moderately inhibited or completely insensitive to Lnk. Furthermore, Lnk-mediated growth inhibition is associated with differential downregulation of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling in leukemia cell lines. Surprisingly, analysis of Lnk in a large panel of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia patient samples revealed high levels of Lnk in nearly half of the samples.;Although how leukemic cells overcome the antiproliferative effects of Lnk is not yet clear, our data highlight the multifaceted role negative feedback mechanisms play in malignant transformation.",

All GISTs should be considered as having malignant potential, although they display varying degrees of aggressiveness. Although usually asymptomatic, large GISTs may present with pain or bleeding. Definitive diagnosis is made by immunohistochemical staining of the tissue for CD117, also known as KIT protein, a cell membrane receptor with tyrosine kinase activity. Size and mitotic activity are predictive of malignant behavior. Primary treatment for GISTs with high malignant potential is surgical resection.

By using indirect immunoperoxidase staining for Cajal cell markers (c-kit protein and CD34), smooth muscle markers (alpha-smooth muscle actin, desmin, heavy caldesmon and calponin) and Schwann cell markers (S-100 protein and Leu 7), GIST were classified into five groups, such as Cajal cell type (n = 9), myogenic type (n = 5), Schwann cell type (n = 2), mixed cell type (n = 40) and undifferentiated type (n = 2). c-kit Protein (42/58; 72%) and CD34 (45/58; 78%) were commonly and diffusely expressed in GIST. Novel smooth muscle markers, caldesmon (29/58; 50%) and calponin (18/58; 31%), were useful in detecting myogenic characters of GIST. S-100 protein was expressed in 16 (28%) tumors, two of which were also reactive with Leu 7 (CD57). Three small bowel tumors with skeinoid fibers expressed the Cajal cell markers, and were categorizable in GIST. Clinicopathological analyses using aggressive (n = 21) and non-aggressive (n = 21) GIST indicated that the malignant potential was correlated with the intestinal location, large tumor size, high cellularity, necrosis, solid (non-interlacing bundled) pattern of growth, negativity of c-kit protein and/or CD34, high mitotic count, and high MIB-1 labeling.",

This review summarizes our recent data demonstrating that the expression of both genes is regulated by the AP-2 transcription factor. Moreover, we have observed a loss of AP-2 expression in metastatic melanoma cells. Re-expression of AP-2 in the highly metastatic A375SM cells decreased their tumorigenicity and inhibited their metastatic potential in nude mice. MCAM/MUC18 mRNA and protein expression was significantly downregulated while c-KIT expression was upregulated in the AP-2 transfected cells. Since AP-2 also regulates other genes that are involved in the progression of human melanoma such as E-cadherin, MMP-2, p21WAF-1, HER-2, BCL-2, and insulin like growth factor receptor-1, we propose that loss of AP-2 is a crucial event in the development of malignant melanoma.",

Despite the increasing use of breast DCE-MRI, specificity in distinguishing malignant from benign breast lesions is low, and interobserver variability in lesion classification is high. The novel contribution of this paper is in the definition of a new DCE-MRI descriptor that we call textural kinetics, which attempts to capture spatiotemporal changes in breast lesion texture in order to distinguish malignant from benign lesions. We qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrated on 41 breast DCE-MRI studies that textural kinetic features outperform signal intensity kinetics and lesion morphology features in distinguishing benign from malignant lesions. A probabilistic boosting tree (PBT) classifier in conjunction with textural kinetic descriptors yielded an accuracy of 90%, sensitivity of 95%, specificity of 82%, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92. Graph embedding, used for qualitative visualization of a low-dimensional representation of the data, showed the best separation between benign and malignant lesions when using textural kinetic features. The PBT classifier results and trends were also corroborated via a support vector machine classifier which showed that textural kinetic features outperformed the morphological, static texture, and signal intensity kinetics descriptors. When textural kinetic attributes were combined with morphologic descriptors, the resulting PBT classifier yielded 89% accuracy, 99% sensitivity, 76% specificity, and an AUC of 0.91.",

The incidence of esophagitis was decreased if the target coverage was compromised in the medial supraclavicular volume, a finding that echoes previous results with photon radiotherapy. The rates of esophagitis were also comparable to the previous data for photons. Using PBT-based accelerated partial breast irradiation, the rates of seroma/hematoma and fat necrosis were comparable to those reported in the existing data. Radiation pneumonitis and rib fractures remain rare. PBT offers excellent potential to minimize the risk of cardiac events, keeping the mean heart dose at ≤ 1 Gy. However, definitive clinical experiences remain sparse. The recently begun randomized trial of protons versus photons will further aid in providing robust conclusions. ",

Symptoms included persistent epigastric and right upper quadrant pain. Radiographically, the pancreas contained four large cystic masses located in the neck, body, and tail. Histologically, the cysts were lined with benign, mucinous epithelium with underlying bland, storiform, ovarian-like stroma. An undifferentiated focally hyalinized, sarcomatous stroma composed of bland spindle cells showing short fascicular growth pattern and focal nuclear palisading was associated with the epithelial component in one of the cysts. These cells showed strong immunoreactivity with vimentin and inhibin (weak), they were negative for CD34, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, androgen, calretinin, S-100, CD117, melan A, chromogranin, and synaptophysin. A morphologically and immunohistochemically identical metastatic sarcomatous focus was identified in the liver without any glandular component. This case is unique in its clinically malignant behaviour and metastatic nature despite its morphologically benign epithelial and stromal components.",

Cell surface markers were also analyzed to evaluate the usefulness of G-CSF in peripheral stem cell transplantation. After G-CSF administration, the white blood cell count showed remarkable changes beyond the physiologic range; the increase and decrease were 5.0 times and 0.3 times previous values, respectively, in the solid tumor group, and 11.0 times and 0.2 times, respectively, in the lymphocytic malignancy group. Concerning the morphology of peripheral white blood cells, immature leukocytes increased markedly to 133.0 times the previous value. The frequency of immature cells with morphological abnormalities was 0.5 percent in the solid tumor group, but 1.6 percent in the lymphocytic malignancy group. These findings suggest that administering G-CSF affects precision control and microscopic findings in routine laboratory blood tests and that information about whether the patient was treated with G-CSF should be obtained from the clinical staff. A cell surface marker, c-kit, was analyzed to clarify whether stem cells useful for peripheral stem cell transplantation appear in peripheral blood after administration of G-CSF. The incidence of c-kit-positive cells was at 1-10% in 3 of 5 patients in the solid tumor group administered G-CSF and in all 6 patients in the lymphocytic malignancy group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Surgical margins were evaluated as complete or diffusely involved. Patient follow-up was obtained from casenotes and the Singapore Cancer Registry. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were constructed using the 2-mm punch on the Beecher arrayer. p53 and CD117 immunohistochemistry was applied on 4-microm sections cut from TMA blocks. Immunostaining intensity was graded as 0, 1+, 2+ or 3+, for nil, weak, moderate and strong reactivity. The proportion of stromal cells decorated was assessed. Statistical analysis utilised the software SPSS for windows 11.5. Survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method, while multivariate analysis was accomplished using the stepwise Cox proportional hazards model. A P value of <0.05 was considered a significant result. For verification of protein expression results, a pure stromal population derived from laser capture microdissection was subjected to real-time polymerase chain reaction to determine p53 and CD117 mRNA upregulation.;Three hundred thirty-five women diagnosed with PT were aged 16 to 69 years (median, 42 years). Tumour size ranged from 0.9 to 25 cm (median, 4 cm). Histologic classification revealed 250 (74.6%) benign, 54 (16.1%) borderline and 31 (9.3%) malignant PTs. Surgical margins were focally involved in 186 (55.5%) cases, diffusely affected in 9 (2.9%) cases and complete in 139 (41.5%) cases. Stromal cells positively stained ranged from 1% to 80% (mean, 15%; median, 5%) for p53, and 1% to 25% for CD117 (mean, 8%; median, 3%). p53 and CD117 staining was associated with PT grade (P = 0.004, P <0.001). Forty-three (12.8%) women suffered 57 recurrences (mean and median follow-up of 30.3 and 20.4 months respectively). Nine (2.7%) died during follow-up, 7 from malignant disease (mean and median survival duration 37.6 and 23.6 months respectively). Complete margins (P = 0.033) resulted in reduced recurrence risk by 51.7%. Though tumour grade was associated with an increased hazard of 1.63, it was not significant (P = 0.28). Immunoexpression of p53 was not associated with recurrence (P = 0.447), while CD117 was (P = 0.001). Upregulation of p53 and CD117 mRNA was found in cases in which there was protein overexpression.;Involved surgical margins remain a key prognostic parameter in breast PT. Death from disease occurred in women with malignant PTs at presentation, underscoring the need to manage this group more aggressively. p53 staining can be used to corroborate malignancy in PT. CD117 was predictive of recurrence, and if further validated, its expression can be explored for therapeutic purposes.

Hence, analysis of the immunological responses in the mouse may elucidate the mechanisms of immunity to trichuriasis in man. The work described here investigates the roles of eosinophils, mast cells and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in the elimination of T. muris from the host gut. Following ablation of IL-5, and hence eosinophilia, mice usually resistant to T. muris infection remained so. Further, blocking the stem cell factor receptor, c-kit, to facilitate complete ablation of mast cells over the period of parasite expulsion in resistant mice had no effect on the development of protective immunity. Therefore it can be deduced that eosinophils and mast cells are not critical in resistance. In addition to these studies, the role of antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxic mechanisms was investigated via the analysis of an infection time course in Fc gamma R-/- mice. These animals, on a resistant background, were fully immune and expelled the parasites before development of the adult stage. Thus this model provides evidence against a major role for ADCC in resistance to infection with T. muris. The studies described here have eliminated some of the major effector mechanisms traditionally associated with helminth infection, and work continues to elucidate the critical immune responses associated with resistance.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Hereditary papillary renal carcinoma (HPRC) is a recently recognized form of inherited kidney cancer characterized by a predisposition to develop multiple, bilateral papillary renal tumours. The pattern of inheritance of HPRC is consistent with autosomal dominant transmission with reduced penetrance. HPRC is histologically and genetically distinct from two other causes of inherited renal carcinoma, von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) and the chromosome translocation (3;8). Malignant papillary renal carcinomas are characterized by trisomy of chromosomes 7, 16 and 17, and in men, by loss of the Y chromosome. Inherited and sporadic clear cell renal carcinomas are characterized by inactivation of both copies of the VHL gene by mutation, and/or by hypermethylation. We found that the HPRC gene was located at chromosome 7q31.1-34 in a 27-centimorgan (cM) interval between D7S496 and D7S1837. We identified missense mutations located in the tyrosine kinase domain of the MET gene in the germline of affected members of HPRC families and in a subset of sporadic papillary renal carcinomas. Three mutations in the MET gene are located in codons that are homologous to those in c-kit and RET, proto-oncogenes that are targets of naturally-occurring mutations. The results suggest that missense mutations located in the MET proto-oncogene lead to constitutive activation of the MET protein and papillary renal carcinomas.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Over the last fifteen years, pathology underwent significant changes in the field of soft tissue tumours. They were related to considerable advances in molecular biology and genetics. New data led to the revision of the WHO classification. Malignant fibrous histiocytoma is no longer considered as an entity. It has split up into several subgroups belonging to liposarcomas, leiomyosarcomas or undifferentiated sarcomas. Haemangiopericytoma underwent reappraisal and was put in the same category as solitary fibrous tumour. Many tools have improved. Immunohistochemistry performed with new antibodies had its specificity increased, and became appropriate for the prediction of therapeutic response in some cases, e.g. CD117 detecting mutations of the c-kit proto-oncogen in gastro-intestinal stromal tumours. Refinement of the techniques allows accurate diagnoses from core needle biopsies. Surgical specimens are collegially examined by surgeons and pathologists with special attention paid to resection margins. Although bound by some limitations, the grading system of the French Federation of Cancer Centers has currently remained the best predictor of metastasis-free survival and overall survival of patients. It is based on an assessment of three parameters: differentiation, amount of necrosis, and mitotic count of tumours. The pathologist sets up a diagnosis, and actively takes part in the prediction of the prognosis and therapeutic response. He is one of the major participants in decision making for multimodal treatment of sarcomas.",

Thus, although all the data suggest that the biology of thymomas and TC is different, in clinical practice, their therapeutic management up to now is identical. In the age of personalized medicine, the time may have come to think this over.

Appearance at birth or later of a nodular or hyperpigmented area within a CMN simulates malignant melanoma and prompts biopsy. Although their clinical and pathologic features seem ominous, proliferative nodules (PNs) typically are benign and may regress, although atypical features cause greater concern. Here we report clinical and pathologic findings with outcome in 10 children who had multiple biopsies of large CMN with PNs. We reviewed 78 separate samples from the 10 patients and classified the 60 PNs according to published criteria. A subset of 30 samples containing both the CMN and a PNs was analyzed for immunohistochemical reactivity for melanocytic (S-100 protein, HMB45, melan-A), lymphocytic (CD45), cell-cycle/proliferative (Mib-1, p16, p21, p27, c-Myc), apoptotic (p53, Bax, c-kit, CD95), and anti-apoptotic (bcl-2) markers. Both CMN and PNs had similar expression of melanocytic, lymphocytic, and most cell-cycle/proliferative and apoptotic markers, including Mib-1, p16, p21, p27, c-Myc, Bax, CD95, and bcl-2. A greater proportion of PNs than CMN were reactive for p53 (67% vs. 30%, P < 0.0098) and c-kit (97% vs. 3%, P < 0.0001). p53 and p21 expression in CMN and all types of PNs were inversely correlated. When ordinary and atypical PNs were compared, the atypical PNs more frequently expressed p53, Mib-1, Bax, and bcl-2, but less frequently expressed p21. The c-kit expression in nearly all PNs and its absence in nearly all CMN is potentially useful for recognition of PN, suggests a delayed melanocytic maturation process in proliferative nodules, and may be likely indicative of their benign nature. p53 reactivity in concert with a lack of p21 up-regulation by immunohistochemistry suggests that a p53 mutation may be present in PN, although the immunohistochemical findings alone cannot exclude possible overexpression of wild-type p53. Regressive, involutional, or maturational changes were observed in sequential samples from 4 patients. No patient developed malignant melanoma or another melanocytic nevus-associated malignancy during the follow-up period. These findings underscore the similarities between PNs and the underlying CMN and suggest that maturational, proliferative, and apoptotic processes are involved in their clinical evolution.",

However, mast cell-deficient mouse models based on c-kit defects have recently been questioned for their relevance. Here we addressed the effect of mast cells in a tumor setting by using transgenic Mcpt5-Cre+ R-DTA+ mice, in which the deficiency of mast cells is independent of c-kit defects. Melanoma cells (B16.F10) were administered either subcutaneously or intravenously into Mcpt5-Cre+ R-DTA+ mice or Mcpt5-Cre- R-DTA+ littermate controls, followed by the assessment of formed tumors. In the subcutaneous model, mast cells were abundant in the tumor stroma of control mice but were absent in Mcpt5-Cre+ R-DTA+ mice. However, the absence of mast cells did not affect tumor size. In contrast, after intravenous administration of B16.F10 cells, melanoma colonization of the lungs was markedly reduced in Mcpt5-Cre+ R-DTA+ vs. Mcpt5-Cre- R-DTA+ animals. Decreased melanoma colonization of the lungs in Mcpt5-Cre+ R-DTA+ animals was accompanied by increased inflammatory cell recruitment into the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, suggesting that mast cells suppress inflammation in this setting. Further, qPCR analysis revealed significant alterations in the expression of Twist and E-cadherin in lungs of Mcpt5-Cre+ R-DTA+ vs. control Mcpt5-Cre- R-DTA+ animals, suggesting an impact of mast cells on epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In conclusion, this study reveals that mast cells promote melanoma colonization of the lung.",

Apart from c-KIT mutations, which are present in <18% of MCTs, little is known of the mechanisms of MCT development and independent growth of tumour cells. Recently, the α-subunit (CD25) of the interleukin (IL)-2 receptor (IL-2R) has been found to be expressed by canine cutaneous MCTs and this expression is negatively correlated with tumour grade. We thus hypothesized that the other two subunits of the IL-2R and the ligand IL-2 are also expressed and that IL-2-dependent pathways may have an impact on MCT development and independent tumour cell growth. Messenger RNA and protein expression levels of the IL-2R β-subunit (CD122), the IL-2R γ-subunit (CD132) and IL-2 were analyzed in canine cutaneous MCTs and compared with tumour grade and c-KIT mutation status. Eighty-six percent of the tumours expressed both subunits of the IL-2R and 64% expressed IL-2. In addition, neoplastic mast cells seem able to bind IL-2. IL-2Rγ and IL-2 protein expression levels were significantly decreased in higher grade tumours and IL-2 expression was significantly decreased in c-KIT mutated tumours. Thus, expression of the complete IL-2R and its ligand by canine cutaneous MCTs indicates a potential impact of IL-2R signalling in MCT development and tumour cell proliferation. The decrease in IL-2R expression with increasing histological evidence of malignancy suggests that the IL-2R may be more relevant for early MCT development and well-differentiated tumours.",

It has activity against platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha and beta (PDGFR-alpha and -beta), and c-kit, the receptor for stem cell factor. We have used a standardized ATP-tumor chemosensitivity assay and immunohistochemistry to determine the cytotoxicity of imatinib mesylate in tumor-derived cells from cutaneous and uveal melanoma, and ovarian carcinoma. Imatinib mesylate was tested at concentrations ranging from 2.0 to 0.0625 micromol/l alone and in combination with a cytotoxic drug (cisplatin, doxorubicin, paclitaxel or treosulfan). Imatinib mesylate showed low inhibition (IndexSUM>300) across the range of concentrations tested in this study, with few tumors exhibiting increasing inhibition with increased drug concentration. The median IC90 values for cutaneous and uveal melanoma and ovarian carcinoma were 13.2 micromol/l (4.0-294.3 micromol/l), 12.0 micromol/l (2.0-285.4 micromol/l) and 7.71 micromol/l (6.51-11.02 micromol/l), respectively. Imatinib mesylate potentiated the effect of different cytotoxics in 9% (5/54) of cases and had a negative effect in 13% (7/54) of cases, with no effect in the remainder. No correlation of effect was noted with c-kit, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha or platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta expression, assessed by immunohistochemistry. The signaling pathways mediated by activation of c-kit or platelet-derived growth factor receptor may act as antiapoptotic survival signals in some cancers and inhibition of these pathways may potentiate the activity of some cytotoxic drugs by inhibiting the survival signal. Growth inhibition, however, may reduce the efficacy of cytotoxic drugs, which tend to target proliferating cells preferentially, and clinical effects are therefore difficult to predict.",

These tumours are the most frequently diagnosed cancer in Caucasian adolescents and young adults. In dysgenetic gonads, the precursor of type II GCTs can be either CIS or a lesion known as gonadoblastoma (GB). CIS/GB originates from a primordial germ cell (PGC)/gonocyte, ie an embryonic cell. CIS can be cured by local low-dose irradiation, with limited side effects on hormonal function. Therefore, strategies for early diagnosis of CIS are essential. Various markers are informative to diagnose CIS in adult testis by immunohistochemistry, including c-KIT, PLAP, AP-2gamma, NANOG, and POU5F1 (OCT3/4). OCT3/4 is the most informative and consistent in presence and expression level, resulting in intense nuclear staining. In the case of maturational delay of germ cells, frequently present in gonads of individuals at risk for type II (T)GCTs, use of these markers can result in overdiagnosis of malignant germ cells. This demonstrates the need for a more specific diagnostic marker to distinguish malignant germ cells from germ cells showing maturation delay. Here we report the novel finding that immunohistochemical detection of stem cell factor (SCF), the c-KIT ligand, is informative in this context. This was demonstrated in over 400 cases of normal (fetal, neonatal, infantile, and adult) and pathological gonads, as well as TGCT-derived cell lines, specifically in cases of CIS and GB. Both membrane-bound and soluble SCF were expressed, suggestive of an autocrine loop. SCF immunohistochemistry can be a valuable diagnostic tool, in addition to OCT3/4, to screen for precursor lesions of TGCTs, especially in patients with germ cell maturation delay.",

The basal phenotype, so-named because of an immunohistologic profile that is similar to myoepithelial cells of the breast, has poor outcomes. While the invasive basal phenotype has been described, there is a paucity of literature regarding the existence or recognition of a precursor lesion. We searched our CoPath database for breast carcinomas in the age group of 37 years or less, and this yielded 98 cases from the years 2001 to April 2006. Pathology reports were screened for those cases that were negative for estrogen and progesterone receptors and HER-2/neu (triple negative). A total of 16 cases (16/98, 16%) fulfilled these criteria. Histology was reviewed and immunostains were performed for Cytokeratins 14, 17, and 5/6, vimentin, EGFR, c-kit, smooth muscle actin and p63. All 16 cases had a high-grade invasive ductal carcinoma, Nottingham score 9/9, with geographic necrosis, good circumscription and lymphoid infiltrates. Of the 16 cases, 13 exhibited at least one area of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The DCIS types were solid, flat or micropapillary, high nuclear grade, with comedonecrosis and invariably associated with intense lymphoid inflammatory cell infiltration.

All of the DCIS components demonstrated the same immunohistologic profile as the invasive component. A DCIS component of solid, flat or micropapillary type exists in the basal phenotype of breast carcinoma, and it demonstrates the same immunophenotype as the invasive carcinoma, typically positive for CK5/6, CK14, CK17, vimentin and EGFR, but negative for ER/PR and HER-2/neu.",

The incidence of sporadic ICC hyperplasia and the so-called seedling leiomyoma (SLM) of the lower oesophagus has not been studied in the KIT era. In a retrospective review of 77 consecutive, routinely processed oesophagogastric resection specimens for distal oesophageal carcinoma, we found foci of ICC hyperplasia in 7 of 77 (9.1%) cases and foci of SLM in 17 of 77 (22%) cases. Two types of ICC hyperplasia were recognized: a non-circumscribed type and a nodular expansile type with peripherally compressed myenteric neural tissues. All cases of ICC hyperplasia were vimentin+/CD34+/CD117+. SLMs were desmin+/vimentin(-)/CD34(-)/CD117(-), similar to smooth muscles of the gut wall. In a prospective study of 32 non-carcinomatous specimens from age-matched patients (mostly autopsy cases), we found SLMs in only one case, but we were unable to detect ICC hyperplasia in any of the cases. We concluded that sporadic KIT-positive spindle-cell hyperplasia and SLMs were unexpectedly common in distal oesophageal specimens harbouring carcinomas. The possible mechanisms leading to the development of these putative precursor lesions will be discussed.",

This study examines the whole population-based incidence of GIST as well as pathologic risk stratification schemes. All patients diagnosed in Iceland with a gastrointestinal mesenchymal tumor over the years 1990-2003 were evaluated with an immunohistochemical panel including staining for c-kit. The age-adjusted incidence of GIST was calculated. Size, mitotic rate per 50 HPF and various other pathologic parameters were evaluated. Each tumor was categorized into 1 of 4 recently defined NIH risk stratification categories. Fifty-seven of the mesenchymal gastrointestinal tumors were positive for c-kit and therefore categorized as GIST. The annual incidence for the study period is 1.1 per 100,000. The median age of patients was 65.8 years and median tumor size was 4.6 cm. Only 2 of 35 gastric tumors fall into the NIH high-risk category while half of the nongastric tumors (11 of 22) fall into this high-risk category. Eight of the 57 tumors (14%) metastasized, 7 of which were nongastric. The positive predictive value for malignant behavior of the high-risk category is 46%. The negative predictive value of low- and very-low-risk NIH category is 100%. Pathologic predictors of malignant behavior are tumor size, mitotic rate, mucosal disruption, necrosis and high cellularity. Nongastric GISTs are clearly at much higher risk of a malignant behavior than gastric GISTs. This population-based GIST study estimates the incidence of GISTs at 1.1 per 100,000 and furthermore supports the NIH consensus categories for the prediction of malignant behavior of GISTs.",

Most gastrointestinal mesenchymal tumors are of uncertain histogenesis. Current studies have shown a striking morphological and immunophenotypic similarities of these tumors with the interstitial cells of Cajal. And that they may originate from stem cells that differentiate toward a pacemaker cell phenotype. Most GIST's have a co-expression of Kit (CD117) or CD34, which is also express in interstitial cells of Cajal.;This review will attempt to summarize the current knowledge and understanding of these lesions based on review of the literature, with an analysis of the criteria for distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors.;We report a Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor of the stomach with prominent cystic degeneration. The patient had diarrhea, abdominal pain and was found to have abdominal mass. X-ray and computed axial tomography examination showed a lesion that seems to be a pancreatic cystic lesion. At laparotomy a large intramural tumor located in the stomach was found. Histologically, the lesion was composed of epithelioid and spindle cells embedded in an abundant myxoid stroma.

After transfection, the cells were cultured in IMDM containing 10% FCS without growth factors, or with one of the following growth factor combinations: (1) murine c-kit ligand (KL) plus human flt3 ligand (FL); (2) IL-3, thrombopoietin, G-CSF, and hyper-IL-6 (3/T/G/H6); (3) KL/FL plus 3/T/G/H6. The flow cytometry was used to detect the ability of combinations of growth factors to complement the oncogene fusion protein to support self-renewal of the transfected cells. The results showed that the transfected cells could be amplified sustainably in the logarithmic growth way. The indicated combination of c-Kit ligand (KL) with flt-3 ligand (FL) supported the self-renewal of the marrow cells transfected with vectors encoding TEL-PDGFR, Rabaptin5-PDGFR, AML1-ETO and NPM-ALK, in addition to KL/FL, the self-renewal of p210 BCR-ABL transfected-marrow cells also required IL-3. The morphology of cells emerged from culture can be the predictor of the corresponding oncogene-associated malignancy.

For head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) there exist few and controversial data regarding their stratification on distinct groups or sub-groups and thus, none of them are validated as useful tools for diagnosis and therapy. Starting from the highly expressed markers in HNSCC (epidermal growth factor receptor, keratin 5 and E cadherin) we proposed to identify distinct HNSCC sub-groups with a potential impact on prognosis and therapy. Complex analysis of immunohistochemical expression for six surrogate markers (EGFR, p53, Bcl2, CD117, keratin 5 and E-cadherin) defined three distinct sub-classes amongst EGFR-positive cases, based on the association and differential expression of p53 and Bcl2 (EGFR(+)/p53(-)/bcl2(-), EGFR(+)/p53(+)/bcl2(-) and EGFR(+)/p53(+)/bcl2(+)). Amongst them, only the EGFR(+)/p53+/bcl2(-) sub-class showed significant correlations with grade and TNM parameters. Keratin 5-positive cases were grouped in a special \"basal like\" group with a particular sub-class rich in CD117(+)/p63(+) cells also highly expressing EGFR. Presence of K5(+)/CD117(+)/p63(+) cells was correlated with all TNM staging parameters defining a particular sub-class with high aggressiveness and particular behavior. Our data sustain EGFR as the key player in the pathogenesis of HNSCCs, but its diagnostic value may be improved by association with other prognostic or therapeutic markers. We herein defined two distinct HNSCCs groups (EGFR(+) and K5(+)) with several sub-classes, identifiable by the additional assessment of p53, Bcl2 and CD117. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Ovarian serous carcinoma (OSC) is the most common ovarian epithelial malignancy. Recently, a dualistic pathway of ovarian serous carcinogenesis has been proposed based on morphologic observations and molecular genetic analysis. In this scheme, low-grade OSC arises in a stepwise fashion from a benign serous cystadenoma through a usual serous borderline tumor through a micropapillary variant of serous borderline tumor. In contrast, the more common high-grade OSC arises de novo from the ovarian surface epithelium or the epithelium of cortical inclusion cysts with an as yet unrecognized precursor lesion. Although the division of OSC into low- and high-grade variants is gaining greater acceptance, and although there is accumulating molecular genetic evidence for this, there is little published information regarding a comparison of protein expression between these two types of OSC. In this study, we have investigated the immunohistochemical expression of a wide range of proteins in cases of low-grade (n = 22) and high-grade (n = 47) OSC. Antibodies used were p53, MIB1, BCL2, WT1, HER-2/neu, C-KIT, osteopontin, and survivin. For all antibodies, except MIB1, cases were scored as 0 (negative or occasional positive cells), 1+ (<10% cells positive), 2+ (10%-25% cells positive), 3+ (26%-50% cells positive), 4+ (51%-75% cells positive) or 5+ (>75% cells positive). For MIB1, the percentage of positive nuclei was calculated. There was a statistically significant higher expression of p53, MIB1, BCL2, HER-2/neu, and C-KIT in high-grade compared with low-grade OSC (P < 0.05). Thirty of 47 (64%) cases of high-grade OSC exhibited 5+ staining with p53 compared with 4 of 22 (18%) low-grade neoplasms. Twelve of 47 (26%) high-grade OSCs exhibited 5+ staining with BCL2 compared with 1 of 22 (5%) low-grade OSCs. The mean MIB1 proliferative index in high-grade OSCs was 55.4% compared with 23.0% in low-grade OSCs. Virtually all cases of both low-grade and high-grade OSCs exhibited diffuse nuclear positivity with WT1 and diffuse cytoplasmic positivity with survivin. Osteopontin expression was variable with no significant difference in expression between low-grade and high-grade OSC. Although expression of both HER-2/neu and C-KIT was significantly higher in high-grade compared with low-grade OSC, only rare cases exhibited strong positivity with these antibodies, which could be of therapeutic value in individual cases, although this would require additional molecular investigations. The significant differences in protein expression between low-grade and high-grade OSC provides further support for a different underlying pathogenesis. In particular, the differences in p53 immunoreactivity are in keeping with the observation that p53 gene mutation is more common in high-grade than low-grade OSC.",

As the number of centers available to treat children increases, it is incumbent on those with access to this modality to optimize other critical aspects of radiotherapy and cancer care and follow-up that are requisite to achieving disease control and high-quality survivorship. Even though the focus of pediatric radiation oncology is weighted toward side effect reduction, there is an opportunity for dose escalation or biologically optimized radiotherapy in a number of diseases or settings in which high-dose irradiation is considered unapproachable.

In contrast, the LSK(-) population is reduced in CML mice, and depletion of leukemia stem cells (LSCs; BCR-ABL-expressing HSCs) by deleting Alox5 or by inhibiting heat shock protein 90 causes an increase in this LSK(-) population. The transition of LSK to LSK(-) cells is controlled by the Icsbp gene and its downstream gene Lyn, and regulation of this cellular transition is critical for the survival of normal LSK cells and LSCs.

HOCT in patients without evidence of BHD or renal oncocytosis is exceedingly rare, and these cases have been poorly characterized. We have identified and studied 14 cases of HOCT from previously diagnosed renal oncocytomas (398 cases) and chromophobe renal cell carcinomas (351 cases) without evidence of BHD or renal oncocytosis. Immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and molecular genetic studies analyzing numerical chromosomal changes, loss of heterozygosity for chromosome 3p, and mutation status of VHL, c-kit, PDGFR, and folliculin (FLCN) genes were performed. HOCTs were identified in nine men and five women (age range 40-79 years). The size of tumors ranged from 2 to 11 cm. All tumors displayed a solid alveolar architecture and were composed of cells with abundant granular eosinophilic oncocytic cytoplasm with perinuclear halos. Occasional binucleated neoplastic cells were present, but irregular, hyperchromatic, wrinkled (raisinoid) nuclei were absent. The cytoplasm contained numerous mitochondria of varying sizes, but only sparse microvesicles with amorphic lamellar content were found. Tumors were positive for CK7 (12/14), AE1-AE3 (14/14), anti-mitochondrial antigen (14/14), E-cadherin (11/13), parvalbumin (12/14), and epithelial membrane antigen (14/14). Tumors were generally negative for racemase, CK20, CD10, and carboanhydrase IX. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed multiple chromosomal losses and gains with a median of four (range 1-9) chromosomal aberrations per case. Monosomy of chromosome 20 was common and found in 7 of 14 cases. Monosomy of chromosomes 6 and 9 was present in 4 of 14 cases each, of which two cases displayed monosomy for both chromosomes 6 and 9. Polysomy of chromosomes 10, 21, and 22 was found in 4/14 cases each, of which one case displayed polysomy for all these three chromosomes. No pathogenic mutations were found in the VHL, c-kit, PDGFR, and folliculin (FLCN) genes. (1) We have shown that hybrid oncocytic/chromophobe tumors of the kidney do occur, albeit rarely, outside the Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome and without associated renal oncocytosis. (2) These tumors constitute a relatively homogenous group with histomorphologic features of both chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and renal oncocytoma. (3) Sporadic hybrid oncocytic/chromophobe renal tumors are characterized by multiple numerical aberrations (both mono- and polysomies) of chromosomes 1, 2, 6, 9, 10, 13, 17, 21, and 22 and lack of mutations in the VHL, c-kit, PDGFRA, and FLCN genes. (4) The tumors seem to behave indolently as no evidence of malignant behavior was documented in our series, although admittedly, the follow-up was too short to fully elucidate the biological nature of this rare neoplasm. At worst, these tumors could have a low malignant potential, which only can be found out with longer follow-up.",

In the present study, immunohistochemical methods were used to evaluate the expression of these markers in a series of male gonads from fetuses from the second and third trimesters, and neonates. In addition to these markers, the presence of VASA (a protein specific for the germ cell lineage), TSPY (the testis-specific protein, Y-encoded), and the proliferation index (Ki-67 antigen) was analysed. All these proteins are reported to be present both during spermatogenesis and in CIS/ITGCNU. Positive staining for VASA with varying intensity was found in all germ cells, while TSPY was predominantly located in the prespermatogonial cells at all developmental ages. In contrast, the markers PLAP, c-KIT, OCT3/4, and Ki-67 were more frequent at earlier developmental stages and decreased gradually with time, although they could occasionally be detected in germ cells of neonates. These findings are in line with a declining number of gonocytes during fetal development, concomitant with an increase in the number of prespermatogonia. The latter have lost the immature germ cell phenotype. These findings are compatible with the hypothesis that CIS/ITGCNU arises from developmentally arrested germ cells, most likely primordial germ cells/gonocytes, at an early time point during intrauterine development.",

Uncontrolled activity of SCF/c-kit signaling pathway contributes to the formation of a variety of human malignancies. In this study, we determined whether SCF expression could risk-stratify patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative resection. HCC tissues from 160 patients were collected during curative resection and stained with SCF and CD34, a marker for microvessel density (MVD), using immunohistochemistry. Two statistical analyses were performed: an independent continuous and a multivariate categorical analysis, with test/validation set-defined cut points, and Kaplan-Meier estimated outcome measures of overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS). We found that higher levels of SCF confer worse OS (continuous P = 0.014; and categorical P = 0.009), and RFS (continuous P = 0.002; categorical P = 0.003) of patients with HCC. SCF varies independently from MVD-CD34, tumor node metastasis, histologic grade, age and gender, and retains prognostic significance when analysed as a categorical variable in a multivariate analysis . We confirmed that MVD-CD34 is also an independent prognostic marker for patients with HCC. The levels of SCF and CD34 showed a positive and significant correlation (P < 0.0001) and double low expression confers superior OS (median = 48 months) and RFS (median = 24 months), whereas double high expression confers shortest RFS (median = 10.5 months) compared with single measurements. The prognostic values of SCF and CD34 were independently determined in this study and we propose that both of them are independent prognostic markers for HCC. ",

In order to identify useful biomarkers for accurately classifying prognostic risks for ESCC patients, we examined the expression of six proteins by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 590 paraffin-embedded ESCC samples. The candidate proteins include p53, EGFR, c-KIT, TIMP1 and PI3K-p110α reported to be altered in ESCC tissues as well as another important component of PI3K, PI3K-p85α. Of the six proteins tested, p53, EGFR, c-KIT, TIMP1 and PI3K-p85α were detected with high expression in 43.0%, 36.6%, 55.9%, 70.7% and 57.1% of tumors, respectively. Significant associations were found between high expression of PI3K-p85α, EGFR and p53 and poor prognosis (P = 0.00111; 0.00001; 0.00426). Applying these three proteins as an IHC panel could divide patients into different subgroups (P<0.000001). Multivariate cox regression analysis indicated that the three-protein panel was an independent prognostic factor with very high statistical significance (HR = 2.090, 95% CI: 1.621-2.696, P = 0.00000001).

In situ and invasive carcinomas have been described as arising in MGA, but which cases of MGA will progress to carcinoma is unclear. Criteria for distinguishing uncomplicated MGA, MGA with atypia (AMGA), and carcinoma arising in MGA (MGACA) are not standardized. The primary objective of this study was to illustrate the clinical, histopathologic, and immunophenotypical characteristics of MGA, AMGA, and MGACA in an effort to provide criteria for distinguishing the 3 types. We retrospectively identified 108 cases seen at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1983 and 2007 that had a diagnosis of MGA. Of the 108 cases, 65 cases had available material for review. Inclusion criteria were glands of MGA expressing S-100 protein and lacking myoepithelial layer (smooth muscle actin negative). Eleven out of 65 cases qualified to have an MGA component; myoepithelial layer was detected in the remaining 54 cases and were classified as adenosis. Out of the 11 MGA patients, there were 3 patients with uncomplicated MGA, 2 had AMGA, and 6 had MGACA. Staining indices for the cell cycle markers p53 and Ki-67 were used to compare the 3 tumor categories. Additional staining for other tumor markers [estrogen and progesterone receptors, HER2, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), c-kit, CK5/6, and CK18] were performed. Patient demographics, tumor radiologic features, and clinical follow-up data were collected for all cases. Multiple invasive histologic components were identified in each of the MGACA cases. All invasive MGACAs had a duct-forming component. In addition, basal-like component was present in 2 cases, aciniclike in 2, matrix producing in 4, sarcomatoid in 1, and adenoid cystic in 1. All tumors had strong and diffuse CK8/18 and EGFR expression but no estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER2 (ie, triple negative), or CK5/6 expression. C-kit was focally expressed in 2 of the MGACAs. Ki-67 and p53 labeling indices was < 3% in all MGAs, 5% to 10% in the AMGAs, and > 30% in MGACAs. In a follow-up ranging from 14 days to 8 years, none of the MGA cases recurred. One of the AMGA cases recurred as invasive carcinoma in a background of AMGA after 8 years following incomplete excision of the lesion. Three out of 6 MGACA cases (50%) required multiple consecutive resections ending up with mastectomy due to involved margins by invasive or in situ carcinoma. Two out of 6 MGACA cases (34%) developed metastasis and died of disease. Our data showed that Ki-67 and p53 expression, in conjunction with the morphologic features, could be a reliable marker to distinguish MGA from AMGA and MGACA. Although 11 tumors were only included in our study, 64% of the tumors were carcinomas arising in MGA. This high incidence of MGACA may not represent the actual frequency of MGAs progressing into carcinoma and is likely due to referral bias in our institution. Nonetheless, the high association of carcinoma with MGA necessitates complete excision of MGA to rule out invasion. Although all the MGACA cases were triple negative and express EGFR (basal-like features), all the cases in our study showed a luminal type of differentiation by CK8/18 expression, indicating that MGACA may not fit well into the current proposed molecular classification of breast cancer.",

However, the mechanism by which transplanted hematopoietic stem cells are engrafted is not completely understood. Many traditional techniques have been used to study the engraftment of transplanted stem cells. Most of these methods are ex vivo and, in some cases, donor cells must be modified to enable detection. We describe a novel alternative for identifying unmodified primitive donor cells in a murine host. This mouse model is based on the differential capacity of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT)-positive and APRT-negative cells to sequester and incorporate radiolabeled adenine. Aprt is the gene encoding the adenine phosphoribosyltransferase purine salvage enzyme and has been ablated in 129sv mice. Following the injection of APRT-positive c-kit-positive enriched hematopoietic cells into syngeneic, sublethally irradiated APRT-deficient mice, engrafted cells and their presumptive progeny were successfully tracked by polymerase chain reaction. Their presence also was visualized by autoradiography of paraffin-embedded tissue sections. APRT-positive c-kit-positive enriched cells were detected in the bone marrow, spleen, lung, and thymus of nonirradiated mice. Donor cells and their progeny were more widely distributed in tissues of sublethally irradiated mice than of their nonirradiated counterparts, demonstrating that the pattern of localization of c-kit-positive enriched cells differs between nonirradiated and sublethally irradiated syngeneic recipients. The Aprt mouse model provides a sensitive method for further studying the mechanism of engraftment of unmodified donor hematopoietic cells in relation to the tissue architecture of the recipient.",

Genetics studies have shown that the SI locus encodes the Steel factor (SF), which is the ligand for the tyrosine kinase receptor c-kit, the product of the W locus. SF is synthesized in membrane-bound form and can be processed to produce a soluble form. Cell-cell interaction is important in the production of normal blood cells in vivo and in vitro and in the cellular expansion of leukemic cells. We discuss here how SF decreases the requirements in cell interaction for blast colony formation in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and the presence of membrane-bound SF possibly contributes to the density-dependent growth of the AML blasts. We explain that SF is mainly a survival factor for hematopoietic cells, of little proliferative effect, which maintains CD34+ hematopoietic cells in an undifferentiated state. These properties would potentially allow the maintenance of hematopoietic cells in culture for the purpose of marrow purging or gene therapy. The activation of the c-kit signal transduction pathway may play a significant role in the development of many types of non-hematological malignancies by disrupting normal cell-cell interactions and allowing the growth of cancer cell populations. In summary, the properties of the SF indicate it has a role for survival signals during the process of normal differentiation, AML proliferation and in the maintenance of many c-kit+ tumors.",

We previously reported that pharmacologic levels (1 micromol) of ATRA enhanced the generation of colony-forming cell (CFC) and colony-forming unit-spleen (CFU-S) in liquid suspension cultures of lin- c-kit+ Sca-1+ murine hematopoietic precursors. In this study, we further investigated the effects of ATRA as well as an RAR antagonist, AGN 193109, on the generation of transplantable cells, including pre-CFU-S, short-term repopulating stem cells (STRCs), and long-term repopulating stem cells (LTRCs). ATRA enhanced the ex vivo maintenance and production of competitive repopulating STRCs and LTRCs from lin- c-kit+ Sca-1+ cells cultured in liquid suspension for 14 days. In addition, ATRA prevented the differentiation of these primitive stem cells into more mature pre-CFU-S during the 14 days of culture. In marked contrast, lin- c-kit+ Sca-1+ cells cultured with AGN 193109 for 7 days had virtually no short- or long-term repopulating ability, but displayed an approximately 6-fold increase in the pre-CFU-S population. The data suggest that the RAR agonist ATRA enhances the maintenance and self-renewal of short- and long-term repopulating stem cells. In contrast, the RAR antagonist AGN 193109 abrogates reconstituting ability, most likely by promoting the differentiation of the primitive stem cells.

To prevent the HCC recurrence, we here report on a prospective phase I study of 'in situ' tumor vaccination using CalTUMP, a newly developed immunoadjuvant consisting of BCG extract bound to hydroxyapatite and microparticulated tuberculin, following local PBT for HCC.;Patients with locally advanced recurrent HCC, which had been heavily pretreated with various treatments, were enrolled. PBT was performed with the conventional method to the target HCC. Subsequently, CalTUMP was injected into the same irradiated-tumor three times at one-week intervals. Three dose-levels of CalTUMP (1/10, 1/3, and 1/1) were administered to 3 patients each. Vital signs, blood samples, ultrasound, and computed tomographic scans were monitored to evaluate the safety.;Three intratumoral injections of CalTUMP following PBT (median dose: 72.6 GyE) were accomplished in 9 patients. Transient low-grade fever and minor laboratory changes were observed in 7 patients after CalTUMP injections. No other treatment-related adverse events were observed. Median progression-free survival was 6.0 months (range: 2.1-14.2) and 4 patients were progression-free for more than 1 year.;Intratumoral injection of CalTUMP following PBT was feasible and safe in patients with heavily pre-treated HCC.

Further, among such metastatic tumors, the metastasis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) to the stomach is an extremely rare disease, and it is usually reported in autopsy series. We report a rare case of metastatic gastric tumor derived from right renal carcinoma. Gastric endoscopy confirmed a large, polypoid, friable mass (type 1 tumor, about 7 cm in diameter) in the middle part of the stomach body. The mass was surgically excised and pathological examination showed that the gastric tumor was derived from a metastasis from the right kidney, because it was composed of malignant cells that were identical to those from the removed RCC. In addition, the tumor cells were immunoreactive for CD10, CD15, Ecadherin, early membrane antigen (EMA), and vimentin, but no reactivity was observed for cytokeratins 7 and 20 or c-KIT. Although gastric metastatic tumor derived from renal carcinoma is rare, the precise pre- and postoperative diagnosis may be important; thus, investigation for such metastatic tumors should be performed routinely in the follow up of patients who have been treated for RCC.",

AML is often driven by the overexpression or constitutive activation of receptor tyrosine kinases such as Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), which serves as a good therapeutic target. Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc's tandutinib (MLN-518) is an orally active inhibitor of FLT3 kinase and family members PDGFR beta and c-Kit. Tandutinib inhibited FLT3 phosphorylation, downstream signaling and malignant growth in vitro and in animal models. The drug exhibited limited activity as a single agent in phase I and II clinical trials in patients with AML and myelodysplastic syndrome, but displayed promising antileukemic activity (90% complete remissions) in a phase I/II trial in patients with newly diagnosed AML when administered in combination with cytarabine and daunorubicin.

The spaces often suggested reticular or microcystic patterns of yolk sac tumor, and the solid and hollow tubular patterns often added to the diagnostic confusion. The tumors occurred in men 21 to 55 years old and on gross examination had the typical appearance of seminoma. On microscopic examination, the spaces ranged from small, closely packed and relatively regular to dilated, more dispersed and somewhat irregular. The hollow tubules appeared to result from central discohesion within nests of tumor. The spaces, particularly when large, often contained occasional tumor cells or inflammatory cells within pale edema fluid. The cytologic appearance of the cells lining the spaces, and in the surrounding tumor, retained the typical features of seminoma cells. Thirteen tumors (46%) either lacked (8 cases) or had very scant (5 cases) lymphocytes in the cystic and tubular areas, and hyaline globules were absent. Thirteen of 13 tumors were immunopositive for OCT-3/4 in the nontypical and typical areas; 9 of 10 were placental alkaline phosphatase positive, and 7 of 10 were c-Kit (CD117) positive. The same 13 cases were negative with cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) and alpha-fetoprotein stains. Distinction from yolk sac tumor is aided by the observation that the spaces of yolk sac tumor are often more irregular in their individual shapes and frequently form anastomosing channels. Additionally, the spaces of yolk sac tumor randomly merge with various other yolk sac tumor patterns. The cells lining spaces in yolk sac tumor are often flattened with compressed nuclei and lack the typical prominent nucleoli of seminoma cells. Paucity of lymphocytes and intracystic edema, however, are not differentially helpful, although basophilic fluid favors yolk sac tumor. A panel of immunostains (AE1/AE3, OCT-3/4, and alpha-fetoprotein) is helpful in the differential with yolk sac tumor in especially problematic cases. The edema and paucity of lymphocytes may suggest spermatocytic seminoma, but the varied cell types of that neoplasm are absent.",

The drug has acquired therapeutic relevance because of similar inhibitory activity against certain activating mutations of these molecular targets. The archetypical disease in this regard is chronic myeloid leukemia, where abl is constitutively activated by fusion with the bcr gene (bcr/abl). Similarly, the drug has now been shown to display equally impressive therapeutic activity in eosinophilia-associated chronic myeloproliferative disorders that are characterized by activating mutations of either the PDGFRB or the PDGFRA gene. The former usually results from translocations involving chromosome 5q31-33, and the latter usually results from an interstitial deletion involving chromosome 4q12 (FIP1L1-PDGFRA). In contrast, imatinib is ineffective, in vitro and in vivo, against the mastocytosis-associated c-kit D816V mutation. However, wild-type and other c-kit mutations might be vulnerable to the drug, as has been the case in gastrointestinal stomal cell tumors.

Histologically, the differential diagnosis includes the 'small round cell' tumor group, particularly metastatic small cell carcinoma and blastic hematological malignancies involving skin/soft tissues. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) is a DNA polymerase, which is a sensitive and specific antibody for acute lymphoblastic lymphoma with a small proportion of acute myeloid leukemia showing positivity. This study investigates the expression of TdT in 20 cases with initial diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma. Archival blocks and slides were retrieved and reviewed and clinical information obtained from patient charts. Immunohistochemistry was performed and graded as: 0, no staining; 1+, less than 50% staining in the cells; 2+, 50% or more staining in the cells. After review, 15 cases were confirmed as Merkel cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical positivity was as follows: 8/15 cases were positive for TdT with strong nuclear staining, morphologically resembling 'blasts', AE1AE3, CAM5.2 (15/15) (both membrane and paranuclear dot positivity), CD56 and BCL-2 (15/15), Synaptophysin (13/15), Chromogranin A (11/15), NSE (15/15), CK20 (14/15), CK7 (3/15), both CK7 and CK20 (3/15), CD117 (8/15), CD99 (2/15), CD10 (1/15). One case was negative for CK7/CK20. All 15 cases were negative for thyroid transcription factor-1, LCA, CD20, CD3 and CD34. Expanded immunohistochemical panel with positive staining for epithelial/neuroendocrine markers, CK20, negative staining for hematolymphoid markers and awareness of TdT expression and other markers that show overlap with blastic hematological malignancies avoids misinterpretation in the diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma. This aids in further diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma, avoiding the potential diagnostic pitfall with other small round cell tumors and hematological malignancies primary or metastatic to the skin.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Neurofibromatosis type 1 or Recklinghausen disease is one of the most common hereditary autosomal dominant diseases. The disease-causing gene can be found on chromosome 17 as an NF1 tumor suppressor gene. The mutation of this gene leads to the loss of tumor suppressor function, which in turn causes the development of benign and malignant tumors. In 25% of the cases gastrointestinal manifestations are found, most often GIST. The close correlation of the two diseases are well known in the literature, there are more than 160 published cases. GIST develops in 7% of patients with neurofibromatosis, and among these patients the occurrence of NF1 is 150-180 times more frequent than in the general population. Neurofibromatosis associated with GIST is a different entity and, unlike sporadic GIST, it is usually multiplex and almost always develops in the small bowel. There is a slightly higher incidence among women than in men, and the disease develops at young age. Histological characteristics include spindle cell type, skeinoid fibers and frequent S100 positivity. Low mitotic activity usually suggests better prognosis. c-KIT and PDGFRA mutation is very rare, in agreement with the hypothesis that the pathogenesis of NF1-GIST is not c-KIT dependent. It is presumed that neurofibromatosis associated and sporadic GIST have different pathogenesis, and that the development of GIST tumor in neurofibromatosis is part of the hereditary disease. c-KIT and PDGFRA mutations--as shown in a few known cases--probably develop at a later step of tumor genesis. Imatinib, which has revolutionized the therapy of GIST, cannot be used in this patient group, however, as of today not enough information is available.",

In a pilot study, imatinib, a c-kit/PDGF-receptor inhibitor, induced partial regression of AIDS-associated KS (AIDS-KS) in five of 10 patients.;This multicenter phase II study was designed to estimate the response rate to imatinib in AIDS-KS. Secondary objectives included investigation of predictors of response and imatinib pharmacokinetics in patients on antiretrovirals. Patients received imatinib 400 mg/day by mouth for up to 12 months with dose escalation up to 600 mg/day at 3 months if their disease was stable.;Thirty patients were treated at 12 AIDS Malignancy Consortium sites. Ten patients (33.3%) achieved partial response, six (20%) had stable disease, and seven (23.3%) exhibited KS progression. Nine patients completed 52 weeks of imatinib therapy. The median treatment duration was 22.5 weeks. Only five patients (16.7%) discontinued therapy owing to adverse events. Antiretroviral regimens did not significantly alter imatinib metabolism. Activating mutations in PDGF-R and c-kit were not found at baseline or at disease progression. We found no correlation with response with changes in any of the candidate cytokines.;Imatinib has activity in AIDS-KS.

Point mutations in RAS genes contribute to many cancers, including myeloid malignancies. We investigated the effects of an oncogenic Kras(G12D) allele on phosphorylated signaling molecules in primary c-kit(+) lin(-/low) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Comparison of wild-type and Kras(G12D) c-kit(+) lin(-/low) cells shows that K-Ras(G12D) expression causes hyperproliferation in vivo and results in abnormal levels of phosphorylated STAT5, ERK, and S6 under basal and stimulated conditions. Whereas Kras(G12D) cells demonstrate hyperactive signaling after exposure to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, we unexpectedly observe a paradoxical attenuation of ERK and S6 phosphorylation in response to stem cell factor. These studies provide direct biochemical evidence that cancer stem/progenitor cells remodel signaling networks in response to oncogenic stress and demonstrate that multi-parameter flow cytometry can be used to monitor the effects of targeted therapeutics in vivo. This strategy has broad implications for defining the architecture of signaling networks in primary cancer cells and for implementing stem cell-targeted interventions.",

Immunohistochemistry was applied to assess KIT (CD117) pattern and immunoreactivity score, telomerase expression (human telomerase reverse transcriptase), and proliferation index (MIB-1/Ki67 index). Case outcome was obtained via telephone interviews. The tumors comprised 15 mastocytic well-differentiated, 7 mastocytic pleomorphic, and 3 atypical/poorly granulated MCTs. Immunohistochemically, CD117 was expressed in 13 of 25 tumors (52%), and telomerase reverse transcriptase was expressed in 15 of 22 (68%), with no correlation to histologic classification. Mitotic index, KIT immunoreactivity score, and Ki67 index were significantly higher in mastocytic pleomorphic MCTs than in the other 2 categories. Five cats (20%) died of tumor-related causes.

We investigated phagocytosis and cytolysis of cultured human breast cancer cells by human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) mediated by BsAb MDX-210, its partially humanized derivative (MDX-H210), and its parent MoAb 520C9 (anti-HER-2/neu) under various conditions.;Purified monocytes were cultured with GM-CSF, M-CSF, or no cytokine for five or six days. Antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and cytolysis (ADCC) assays were performed with the MDM and HER-2/neu positive target cells (SK-BR-3). ADCP was measured by two-color fluorescence flow cytometry using PKH2 (green fluorescent dye) and phycoerythrin-conjugated (red) monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) against human CD14 and CD11b. ADCC was measured with a non-radioactive LDH detection kit.;Both BsAb MDX-210 (via FcgammaRI) and MoAb 520C9 (mouse IgG1, via FcgammaRII) mediated similar levels of ADCP and ADCC. ADCP mediated by BsAb MDX-H210 was identical to that mediated by BsAb MDX-210. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that dual-labeled cells represented true phagocytosis. Both ADCP and ADCC were higher when MDM were pre-incubated with GM-CSF than when incubated with M-CSF.;BsAb MDX-210 is as active in vitro as the parent MoAb 520C9 in inducing both phagocytosis and cytolysis of MDM. MDX-210 and its partially humanized derivative, MDX-H210, mediated similar levels of ADCP. GM-CSF appears to superior to M-CSF in inducing MDM-mediated ADCC and ADCP. These studies support the ongoing clinical investigations of BsAb MDX-210 and its partially humanized derivative.",

However, intracranial GCTs are often of mixed histologic composition (mixed GCTs), and only germinoma and teratoma are likely to be encountered as pure tumor types. Although GCTs are usually identified using conventional histological techniques, immunohistochemical studies are very useful for delineating these entities, using special markers such as human chorionic gonadotropin, alpha-fetoprotein, human placental alkaline phosphatase, cytokeratin, as well as c-kit and OCT4. Ultrastructural examination is also useful in confirming the identity of these tumors. Genetic alterations specifically encountered in central nervous system GCTs are largely unknown. Patients with Klinefelter syndrome or Down syndrome appear to be predisposed to the development of gonadal as well as intracranial germinomas. Frequent imbalances of chromosomes have been described in intracranial GCTs, including chromosomes 1, 8, 12, 13, 18 and X.

Direct sequence analysis revealed p53 mutations (that is, at codons 224, 234, and 294) in three tumors (14%) and p16INK4a mutations (that is, at codon 6) in one (5%). No mutations were detected in Ha-Ras, Ki-Ras, N-Ras, c-Kit, or p14ARF. On the other hand, methylation-specific PCR revealed methylation of p14ARF promoter DNA in eight of 19 analyzable tumor samples (42%) and p16INK4a promoter DNA in one of 19 analyzable tumor samples (5%).

The current World Health Organization classification of RCC does not include the rhabdoid phenotype as a distinct histologic entity. The aim of this study is to investigate whether RCC-RM represents a dedifferentiation of a classifiable-type World Health Organization RCC or a carcinosarcoma with muscle differentiation. We reviewed 168 cases of RCC obtained between 2003 and 2008. From these cases, 10 (6%) were found to have areas of classic rhabdoid morphology. Immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, desmin, CD10, and CD117 was performed in each case using the labeled streptavidin-biotin method. Rhabdoid differentiation was identified in association with conventional-type RCC (9) and with unclassifiable-type RCC with spindle cell morphology (1). In all cases, both the rhabdoid and nonrhabdoid tumoral areas were positive for cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen and negative for desmin. Cytokeratin positivity in the rhabdoid areas was focal. In cases associated with conventional-type RCC, CD10 was positive in both the rhabdoid and nonrhabdoid foci. CD117 was negative in these tumors. The unclassifiable-type RCC with spindle cell morphology was negative for both CD10 and CD117. The similar immunophenotype between the rhabdoid and nonrhabdoid tumoral foci supports the origin of the rhabdoid cells from the classifiable-type RCC. Areas of rhabdoid morphology do not represent muscle metaplastic differentiation. Renal cell carcinoma with rhabdoid morphology may represent a dedifferentiation of a classifiable-type RCC, similar to that of sarcomatoid differentiation. The recognition of RCC-RM is important as it allows for the inclusion of these high-grade malignancies into a category associated with poor prognosis despite lacking the spindle cell component classically identified as sarcomatoid change.",

In fewer than 5% of cases, they originate primarily from the mesentery, omentum, or peritoneum. Furthermore, these extra-gastrointestinal tumors (EGIST) tend to be more common in patients greater than 50 years of age. Rarely do EGIST tumors present in those younger than 40 years of age.;We report a case of a large EGIST in a 27-year-old male. An abdominal pelvic computerized tomography imaging demonstrated an intra-abdominal mass of 22 cm, without invasion of adjacent viscera or liver lesions. This mass was resected en bloc with its fused omentum and an adherent portion of sigmoid colon. Pathology results demonstrated a malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor with positive CD117 (c-kit) staining, and negative margins of resection, and no continuity of tumor with the sigmoid colon. Due to the malignant and aggressive nature of this patient's tumor, he was started on STI-571 as adjuvant chemotherapy.;Stromal tumors of an extra-gastrointestinal origin are rare. Of the reported omental and mesenteric EGISTs in four published series, a total of 99 tumors were studied. Of the 99 patients in these series only 8 were under 40 years of age, none were younger than 30 years old; and only 5 were younger than 35 years old. Our patient's age is at the lower end of the age spectrum for the reported EGISTs. Young patients who present with an extra-gastrointestinal stromal tumor (EGIST), who have complete resection with negative margins, have a good prognosis. There is little data to support the role of STI-571 in adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy after curative resection. Given the lack of data, the use of STI-571 must be individualized.",

Cytonuclear and architectural features were reviewed, and PAX-8, p63, PSMA, S100A1, CEA, EMA, CD117, cannabinoid receptor CB1, AMACR, E-cadherin, and CD10 antibodies were included in an immunohistochemical panel. Males predominated (105 M/29 F) with an average age of 66 years (range, 14-96). Urothelial carcinoma was the most frequent clinical antecedent (43.2 %) and also the most common coexisting lesion (14 %). Tubular architecture was the most frequent pattern detected (40 %) although most cases showed a mixed pattern (45.5 %). Deep infiltrative growth into the muscularis propria occurred in two cases. EMA and PAX-8 were expressed in 100 % of nephrogenic adenomas, while E-cadherin reactivity was observed in 66.6 % of cases, cannabinoid receptor CB1 in 25 %, CD10 in 13.6 %, CD117 in 4.1 %, and AMACR in 2.7 %. For the rest of the antigens, no reactivity was found. The average time lapse between the pathological antecedent and the discovery of a nephrogenic adenoma was 32 months. We conclude that nephrogenic adenoma displays a broad spectrum of histological features that may mimic malignancy. In our experience, CB1 immunostaining adds a further argument in favor of a renal origin of this lesion.

The majority of GISTs have c-kit gain-of-function mutations mainly in exon 11 (highly conserved juxtamembrane region) that eventuates in constitutive activation of KIT, promoting proliferation and antiapoptotic signaling. Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) is a specific inhibitor of KIT kinase activation, and in phase II clinical trials has proven to be remarkably efficacious in heavily pretreated GIST patients with advanced disease. The molecular and genomic determinants of response/resistance patterns are the subject of ongoing studies, and adjuvant studies are also under way. The initial evaluations of imatinib provide proof of concept for the hypothesis-driven design of selective molecularly targeted therapies for solid tumor malignancies.",

Here, we studied the clinicopathologic characteristics of GIMTs and determined the diagnostic value of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) in GIMTs.;The morphological characteristics of 415 GIMT cases were observed using light microscopy. The expression of CD117, CD34, smooth muscle actin (SMA), S-100, and Ki-67 were detected using immunohistochemistry. EUS results were retrospectively analyzed in 76 cases.;Among the 415 GIMT cases, there were 229 GIST cases, 178 smooth muscle tumor cases, and eight neurogenic tumor cases. Diffuse strong expression of CD117 was observed in 202 (88.2%) GISTs and strong expression of CD34 was observed in 135 (59.0%) GISTs. SMA and S-100 expression was detected in smooth muscle tumors (leiomyomas/leiomyosarcoma) and neurogenic tumors, respectively. Of the 12 cases with GISTs, nine cases with positive ki-67 expression and accompanied with more mitosis were pathologically diagnosed as malignant GISTs. Most of the borderline and malignant tumors were found in male patients. EUS was 98.7% accurate in determining GIMT locations, 82.9% accurate in diagnosing GIMTs, and 80.3% accurate in differentiating benign from malignant tumors.;GISTs, rather than leiomyomas, are the most common GIMTs. Immunohistochemical markers, such as CD117, CD34, SMA, and S-100, can differentiate GISTs from smooth muscle and neurogenic tumors. The expression of Ki-67 in patients with significant karyokinesis supports a malignant tumor diagnosis. EUS is an accurate method for detecting GIMTs and differentiating between benign and malignant tumors.

The role of KIT inhibitors in treating KIT-positive malignancies is reviewed.;Targeted therapy to inhibit the kinase activity of KIT is a rational approach to the treatment of KIT-positive malignancies. Two key factors are the potency of a given inhibitor and the relative contribution of KIT activation to the growth of the tumor. Given our current understanding of KIT activity in human malignancy, the best candidate diseases for treatment with KIT inhibitors are GIST, mastocytosis, seminoma and possibly some cases of AML. Additionally, KIT inhibitors may play an adjunctive role in diseases such as small-cell lung cancer, in which KIT activation is secondary to ligand binding rather than an acquired mutation.",

Subsequently, the tumor was detected in her small intestine, as an infiltrating mass approximately 10 cm in diameter.

However, the histologic discrimination between hyperplastic states and neoplastic MC proliferative disorders is sometimes very difficult. MC hyperplasia is characterized by a diffuse increase in mature, round or spindle-shaped, metachromatic MC that are loosely scattered throughout the tissue and do not form dense focal infiltrates, even in states of marked hyperplasia. However, loosely scattered MC are also a prominent feature of many cases of myelodysplastic syndromes and acute leukemia involving the MC lineage. In contrast, the demonstration of dense, focal and/or diffuse MC infiltrates can be regarded as indicative of primary MC disease/mastocytosis. In addition to the highly diagnostic focal MC infiltrates, mastocytosis may also present with a predominantly diffuse or a mixed (diffuse and focal) infiltration pattern. The relatively rare diffuse pattern is usually dominated by atypical, often hypogranulated or even non-metachromatic MC and is associated with the aggressive or frankly malignant subtypes of systemic mastocytosis and MC leukemia. Although the demonstration of MC infiltrates in Giemsa-stained tissue sections is still very important for the diagnosis of mastocytosis, immunohistochemical techniques using antibodies against MC-associated antigens such as tryptase or c-kit (CD117) are essential for the identification of highly atypical, hypogranulated MC, especially in MC leukemia, and for the detection of small and even minute MC infiltrates.",

In this study, we investigated the antitumor efficacy of a CXCR4 antagonist expressed by oncolytic vaccinia virus (OVV) against an invasive variant of the murine epithelial ovarian cancer cell line ID8-T. This variant harbors a high frequency of CICs that form multilayered spheroid cells and express the hyaluronan receptor CD44, as well as stem cell factor receptor CD117 (c-kit). Using an orthotopic ID8-T tumor model, we observed that i.p. delivery of a CXCR4 antagonist-expressing OVV led to reduced metastatic spread of tumors and improved overall survival compared with oncolysis alone. Inhibition of tumor growth with the armed virus was associated with efficient killing of CICs, reduced expression of ascitic CXCL12 and vascular endothelial growth factor, and decreases in i.p. numbers of endothelial and myeloid cells, as well as plasmacytoid dendritic cells. These changes, together with reduced recruitment of T regulatory cells, were associated with higher ratios of IFN-γ(+)/IL-10(+) tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes, as well as induction of spontaneous humoral and cellular antitumor responses. Similarly, the CXCR4 antagonist released from virally infected human CAOV2 ovarian carcinoma cells inhibited peritoneal dissemination of tumors in SCID mice, leading to improved tumor-free survival in a xenograft model. Our findings demonstrate that OVV armed with a CXCR4 antagonist represents a potent therapy for ovarian CICs with a broad antitumor repertoire. ",

Overexpression of p16 and p53 was observed in 16 (73%) and 10 (45%) of the PDECs, respectively, whereas only 1 WDET showed overexpression of p53 and none showed overexpression of p16. A total of 18 (82%) of the PDECs showed overexpression of p16 or p53 proteins. This is closely associated with PDEC (P < .0001). By using overexpression of p16 or p53 as the criteria for PDEC, the sensitivity and specificity are 81.8% and 97.1%, respectively, with positive and negative predictive values of 94.7% and 89.5%, respectively.

There are many types of ES clusters, because ES cells have a pluripotent ability to develop into a wide range of cell types. Before inducing specific differentiation by exogenously added factors, we characterized comprehensive physiological and morphological properties of ES guts. Each ES gut has a hemispherical (or cystic) structure and exhibits spontaneous contractions [mean frequency: 13.5 +/- 8.8 cycles per min (cpm)]. A dense distribution of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) was identified by c-Kit immunoreactivity, and specific subcellular structures of ICC and smooth muscle cells were identified with electron microscopy. ICC frequently formed close contacts with the neighboring smooth muscle cells and occasionally formed gap junctions with other ICC. Widely propagating intracellular Ca(2+) concentration oscillations were generated in the ES gut from the aggregates of c-Kit immunopositive cells. Plateau potentials, possibly pacemaker potentials in ICC, and electrical slow waves were recorded for the first time. These events were nifedipine insensitive, as in the mouse gut. Our present results indicate that the rhythmic pacemaker activity generated in ICC efficiently spreads to smooth muscle cells and drives spontaneous rhythmic contractions of the ES gut. The present characterization of physiological and morphological properties of ES gut paves the way for making appropriate models to investigate the origin of rhythmicity in the gut.",

The purpose of this retrospective study was to assess the results of treatment in patients with carcinoma of the cervical stump.;From 1974 to 1990, 77 patients were treated for an infiltrating carcinoma of the cervical stump. This group accounted for 6.6% of the cervical carcinoma diagnosed during the same period. The pathological examination showed, 91% of squamous cell carcinomas and 9% of adenocarcinomas. FIGO stage distribution was: I (35%), II (45%), III (18%), IV (2%). According to the stages, the treatment used a combination of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) with plesiobrachytherapy (PBT), and in a few cases, patients underwent surgery or interstitial brachytherapy (IBT). In patients with bulky tumour or advanced stage and/or lymphatic node involvement, EBRT was first delivered. Most of Stage I and Stage II patients, began their treatment with PBT. All stages included, 95% of the patients were treated by exclusive radiation therapy. Complications were classified according to the recommendations of late effects normal tissues (LENT) scoring system described by the EORTC/RTOG.;Three-year pelvic control was achieved in 59 of 77 patients (76.6%) in the whole series. Three-year pelvic control probabilities were 77% (95% CI: 66-85%), and 89% (95% CI: 72-96%), 73.7% (95% CI: 65-88%) and 56% (95% CI: 28-80%) in the whole series and in Stage I-III tumour patients, respectively.

The α -melanocyte-stimulating hormone ( α -MSH) signal transduction involving Wnt/ β -catenin, c-Kit, and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), a known pathway to produce melanin, has been demonstrated as one of cancer stem cell characteristics. This study was aimed to examine the effect of resveratrol, an abundant ingredient of grape and medicinal plants, on α -MSH signaling, viability, and invasiveness in melanoma cells. By α -MSH treatment, the melanin production in B16 melanoma cells was augmented as a validation for activation of α -MSH signaling. The upregulated expression of α -MSH signaling-related molecules β -catenin, c-Kit, and MITF was suppressed by resveratrol and/or STI571 treatment. Nuclear translocation of MITF, a hallmark of α -MSH signaling activation, was inhibited by combined treatment of resveratrol and STI571. At effective concentration, resveratrol and/or STI571 inhibited cell viability and α -MSH-activated matrix metalloproteinase- (MMP-)9 expression and invasion capacity of B16 melanoma cells. In conclusion, resveratrol enhances STI571 effect on suppressing the α -MSH signaling, viability, and invasiveness in melanoma cells.

This child had numerous congenital anomalies (horseshoe kidney, cerebella hypoplasia, microcephaly, sacral agenesis) and esophageal atresia, which was repaired in neonatal period. Such association led quickly to the diagnosis of FA. At age of 11 months, she developed simultaneously a renal tumor in a horseshoe kidney and bilateral adrenal tumors. The left adrenal mass was removed, and partial nephrectomy was performed. Histological analysis concluded to adrenal neuroblastoma and nephroblastoma. We also evaluated the c-kit expression in these tumors to propose a therapeutic alternative to chemotherapy by oral agent STI-571 (Gleevec; Novartis, East Hanover, NJ). Strong cytoplasmic immunostaining of c-kit was found in both tumors. Unfortunately, she quickly developed a posterior cerebellar fossa tumor and died 1 month later. This clinical situation is very rare but suggests that young patients with FA and solid pediatric tumors may belong to a particular subgroup of FA.

We report herein two pediatric cases displaying strong CD34 positivity and one with additional focal CD117 positivity, causing considerable difficulty in distinction from solitary fibrous tumor and extra-gastrointestinal stromal tumor. To our knowledge, CD34 staining has been merely reported in rhabdomyosarcoma. Spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma has to be considered in the differential diagnosis of childhood spindle cell tumors. Post-chemotherapy specimens should be evaluated in caution, since chemotherapy can cause considerable changes in tumor antigen expression. Since CD117 and CD34 are stem cell markers, their positivity in pediatric tumors should be interpreted with caution. Even if the morphology is not supportive, a wide immunohistochemical panel should be applied in childhood malignant solid tumors. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Mutations of receptor tyrosine kinases are implicated in the constitutive activation and development of human malignancy. An internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the juxtamembrane (JM) domain-coding sequence of the FLT3 gene (FLT3/ITD) is found in 20% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is strongly associated with leukocytosis and a poor prognosis. On the other hand, mutations of the c-KIT gene, which have been found in mast cell leukemia and AML, are clustered in 2 distinct regions, the JM domain and D816 within the activation loop. This study was designed to analyze the mutation of D835 of FLT3, which corresponds to D816 of c-KIT, in a large series of human hematologic malignancies. Several kinds of missense mutations were found in 30 of the 429 (7.0%) AML cases, 1 of the 29 (3.4%) myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cases, and 1 of the 36 (2.8%) acute lymphocytic leukemia patients. The D835Y mutation was most frequently found (22 of the 32 D835 mutations), followed by the D835V (5), and D835H (1), D835E (1), and D835N (1) mutations. Of note is that D835 mutations occurred independently of FLT3/ITD. An analysis in the 201 patients newly diagnosed with AML (excluding M3) revealed that, in contrast to the FLT3/ITD mutation (n = 46), D835 mutations (n = 8) were not significantly related to the leukocytosis, but tended to worsen disease-free survival. All D835-mutant FLT3 were constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated and transformed 32D cells, suggesting these mutations were constitutively active. These results demonstrate that the FLT3 gene is the target most frequently mutated to become constitutively active in AML.",

The patient was a 56-year-old man with constant right flank pain and hematuria; CT scan revealed an 8.5 cm nonhomogeneous mass involving the right kidney. Right radical nephrectomy was performed. The tumor showed a mixture of classical and eosinophilic patterns of chromophobe cell carcinoma. Additionally, it showed insular, glandular and rosetoid-like formations embedded in a dense eosinophilic hyaline stroma. The cells were cuboid or cylindrical with well-defined boundaries, finely stippled chromatin and a small nucleolus. The appearance of the cytoplasm varied from faintly eosinophilic to coarsely granular eosinophilic. Immunohistochemically, the neuroendocrine areas were reactive for C-kit, epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin, cytokeratin 7, chromogranin A, neuron-specific enolase, CD56 and S-100 protein.

        "Doc_abstract":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs), initially presumed to be of \"true\" smooth muscle origin, encompass a heterogeneous, and as yet incompletely understood, group of mesenchymal tumours with respect to their origin, cellular differentiation, and prognosis. Cellular morphology ranges from predominantly spindle shaped to epithelioid in character, whereas differentiation pathways, as determined primarily by immunohistochemistry and ultrastructure, can vary from indeterminate to myoid and/or neural. Recent work has indicated that the interstitial cells of Cajal, a complex cellular network postulated to act as pacemaker cells of the gastrointestinal tract, which exhibit both myoid and neural features, could be candidates for tumour histogenesis. This would provide a plausible and attractive explanation for the variable differentiation pathways identified in the GIST category to date. Nevertheless, the occasional but undisputed location of GISTs outside the gastrointestinal tract (omentum, peritoneum, and retroperitoneum) might mitigate against such an origin, and their histogenesis remains open to debate. The c-kit proto-oncogene, encoding a growth factor receptor with tyrosine kinase activity, has been postulated to play an important role in tumorigenesis because \"gain of function\" mutations in this gene, localised to chromosome 4q11-21, are being increasingly identified in hereditary and sporadic cases. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies directed at the c-kit gene product expressed on the cell surface (CD117/c-kit) appear to be increasingly helpful in resolving the histopathological differential diagnosis between GISTs and true gastrointestinal smooth muscle neoplasms, schwannomas, and other far less frequently occurring mesenchymal tumours at this site. Although tumours with a clinically benign course appear to be more common than their malignant counterparts, no specific histological criteria have as yet been identified to enable an unambiguous prediction of biological behaviour. Increasing tumour size and mitotic activity favour aggressive tumour behaviour, whereas the prognostic value of germline and somatic mutations within the c-kit proto-oncogene remains to be elucidated further. It is the aim of this synopsis to highlight the relevant fundamental and diagnostic developments with respect to this complex group of neoplasms.",

Since 95% of T-LBL expresses TdT and TdT is expressed only in lymphoblasts, immunohistochemical demonstration of TdT is mandatory for the diagnosis of TLBL. However, little is known about the expression of other precursor cell molecules. A 58-year-old woman with myelodysplastic syndrome (RAEB) became overt acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). She was treated twice with allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation from her son. Nine months later, imaging modalities detected a soft tissue tumor around the left ileal bone. A biopsy was performed. Histologically, the tumor cells were malignant polymorphic lymphoid cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and inconspicuous nucleoli. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells are positive for CD45, CD45RO, CD34, KIT (CD117), CD99 (MIC-2), p53, CD10, PDGFRA, and Ki67 (labeling=60%). They were negative for pancytokeratin AE1/3, pancytokeratin CAM5.2, TdT, CD3, CD20, CD79α, CD43, CD56, CD57, CD30, bcl-2, κ-chain, λ-chain, cytokeratin (CK) 7, CK20, synaptophysin, chromogranin, smooth muscle actin, p63, MPO, CD68, lysozyme, and ASD esterase. Although TdT was negative, other precursor cell markers (KIT, CD34, and CD99) were positive and the lymphoid cells showed T-cell lineage, the diagnosis was T-LBL. The patient died of lymphoma/ leukemia 11 months after the diagnosis. The author stress that TdT, KIT, CD34 and CD99 should be included in panels of precursor T-cell neoplasms. In addition, the author think that KIT, CD34 and CD99 are helpful for the diagnosis of T-LBL in cases negative for TdT. Further, it is unique that this case was not myeloid sarcoma but precursor T-cell neoplasm, and that T-LBL develops during AML.",

Next, we examined the significance of these protein patterns using tissue microarrays and evaluated the prognostic significance of these findings.;Using a panel of 21 basal-like tumors, which was determined using gene expression profiles, we saw that this subtype was typically immunohistochemically negative for estrogen receptor and HER2 but positive for basal cytokeratins, HER1, and/or c-KIT. Using breast carcinoma tissue microarrays representing 930 patients with 17.4-year mean follow-up, basal cytokeratin expression was associated with low disease-specific survival. HER1 expression was observed in 54% of cases positive for basal cytokeratins (versus 11% of negative cases) and was associated with poor survival independent of nodal status and size. c-KIT expression was more common in basal-like tumors than in other breast cancers but did not influence prognosis.;A panel of four antibodies (ER, HER1, HER2, and cytokeratin 5/6) can accurately identify basal-like tumors using standard available clinical tools and shows high specificity.

Accurately diagnosing CNS GCTs might be extremely difficult and requires immunohistochemical verification. This study was to investigate the biological feature of CNS GCTs and diagnostic value of immunohistochemical markers OCT3/4, C-kit, PLAP, and CD30 in CNS GCTs. A retrospective study was performed on 34 patients with CNS germ cell tumors between 1990 and 2014. 34 CNS GCTs account for 9.2% of all primary CNS neoplasms. The sellar region (35.3%) and pineal gland (17.6%) were the most common sites of intracranial GCTs. Hydrocephalus (82.4%) and diplopia (46.9%) were the two most common clinical presentations. The most common histological subtypes were germinoma (67.6%). PLAP, c-kit, OCT3/4 were highly expressed in gernimomas. CD30 and CK AE1/3 stainings were positive in embryonal carcinoma. Yolk sac tumor component showed positive staining for AFP and CK AE1/3. β-HCG staining was positive in choriocarcinoma and STGC. Patients with mature teratomas and germinomas had a better prognosis (a 5-year survival rate) than those with embryonal carcinoma and choriocarcinoma (a 5-year survival rates were 0). Our finding suggest that the incidences of primary CNS GCTs are higher in South China than in the West, but mixed GCTs are uncommon in our study. The judicious use of a panel of selected markers is helpful in diagnosing and predicting the prognosis for CNS GCTs. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Although the first leading cause of death in China was malignant neoplasms (mortality, 374.1 per 100,000 person-years), the full impact of primary brain tumors (PBT) on the healthcare system is not completely described because there are a few well documented reports about the epidemiologic features of brain tumors. This study aimed to report a comprehensive assessment on the prevalence of PBT.;A multicenter cross-sectional study on brain tumor (MCSBT) in China was initiated in five regional centers: Daqing (northeast), Puyang (north of China), Shiyan (center of China), Ma'anshan (center of China) and Shanghai (southeast). Prevalence rate was calculated by counting the number of people living with a PBT between October 1, 2005 and September 30, 2006 and dividing by the total population of the five communities at January 1, 2006. Estimates of prevalence were expressed as percentages and grouped according to gender and to age in fifteen-year categories. Within these strata, the rates were estimated with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the accurate calculation of CI for Poisson distribution. A chi-square test was used to compare the various frequencies with α < 0.05. Age-standardized prevalence with the direct method was calculated with the ten-year age-specific prevalence and the age distribution of the Chinese population in 2010, obtained from World population prospects: the 2008 revision.;We estimated that the overall prevalence of PBT was 24.56 per 100,000 (95%CI, 14.85 to 34.27), and the overall prevalence of PBT in female population (30.57 per 100,000 and its 95%CI ranged from 19.73 to 41.41) was higher than that in male population (18.84 per 100,000 and its 95%CI ranged from 10.33 to 27.35). However, the discrepancy between genders was not statistically significant because the 95%CI overlapped. Of 272 cases of newly diagnosed PBT, the proportion of histological subtypes by age groups, gender was statistically different (χ(2) = 52.6510, P < 0.0001). More than half of all reported tumors (52.57%) were either gliomas or meningiomas. For the youngest (aged from 0 - 19) strata of the population, glioma appeared to occur more than other subtypes, accounting for 55.56% of all of cases. The majority of brain tumors presented in those aged from 20 to 59 years was pituitary adenomas (45.12%) and gliomas (31.10%). Opposed to brain tumors in adults and teenage, gliomas only accounted for 22.22%. Meanwhile, the median ages at diagnosis of the patients with PBT were similar between males and females except for pituitary adenomas (male: 59 years old; female: 45 years old).;Age standardized prevalence of PBT is 22.52 per 100,000 (95%CI, 13.22 to 31.82) for all populations, 17.64 per 100,000 (95%CI, 9.41 to 25.87) for men, and 27.94 per 100,000 (95%CI, 17.58 to 38.30) for women. Age standardization to China's 2010 population yielded an estimated population of 304 954 cases with PBT. Our prevalence estimates provide a conservative basis on which to plan health care services and to develop programmatic strategies for surviving. In the future, it would be helpful to have long-term observed survival rates that would make the assumptions and the resulting imprecision in the current estimates unnecessary.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common nonepithelial neoplasm of the gastrointestinal tract and show a predilection for the stomach. Most are detected because of symptoms, but some are incidental findings at autopsy or surgery for other reasons. Incidental GISTs tend to be smaller at diagnosis, but even small (<1 cm) GISTs have been shown to harbor activating KIT mutations at rates similar to advanced GISTs. However, the prevalence and characteristics of small GISTs in surgical resections of the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) remains unclear. We studied 150 esophagogastric resections for esophageal or EGJ carcinomas (100 with preoperative chemoradiation and 50 untreated cases) that had been extensively embedded for histologic examination (mean 30 sections/case). Number, size, morphology, and location of all GISTs and leiomyomas were recorded. All potential GISTs were evaluated with CD117 and CD34 immunohistochemistry, and a subset (35) leiomyomas with smooth muscle actin, desmin, and CD117. We found 18 incidental GISTs in 15 of 150 (10%) patients; 3 patients harbored 2 separate lesions. Prevalence of GIST was identical in treated (10 of 100) and untreated (5 of 50) cases. All (100%) showed positivity for both CD117 and CD34 and all were of spindle cell morphology. Lesions ranged from 0.2 to 3.0 mm in size (mean 1.3 mm). Eight (44%) were based in the outer muscularis propria, 7 (39%) in inner muscularis, and 3 (17%) between the muscle layers. The lesions tended to cluster near the EGJ, with 8 (44%) on the gastric side, 9 (50%) on the esophageal side, and 1 (6%) undetermined owing to overlying ulceration. Leiomyomas were even more common than GIST, occurring in 47% of patients (44% of treated and 52% of untreated, P=0.39), with a mean of 3 leiomyomas per patient (range 1 to 13) and mean size of 1.7 mm (range 0.2 to 12 mm). Unlike colorectal leiomyomas, most (91%) EGJ leiomyomas were located in the inner muscularis propria and only rarely (1%) in muscularis mucosa. These results suggest that GIST and leiomyoma are common incidental \"seedling\" lesions of the EGJ, found in 10% and 47% of patients undergoing surgery for esophageal carcinoma. The common occurrence of microscopic GISTs compared with the rarity of clinically manifest and malignant esophagogastric GISTs suggests that additional genetic or epigenetic alterations must happen for neoplastic progression.",

Possible mechanisms for this increased and prolonged mobilization were investigated. Immunological phenotyping with CD38, Thy-1 and MDR-1 of the CD34-positive mobilized PBPC detected no difference in maturity compared to PBPC mobilized by G-CSF alone. However, the down-regulation of c-kit, which is associated with the mechanism of mobilization, was much greater in the PBPC mobilized by SCF and G-CSF.

        "Doc_abstract":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal neoplasms of the tubular gut and mesentery. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) currently is a useful tool in the diagnosis of GIST because of various mutations of the KIT protooncogene that are recognized as characteristic of these tumors. Despite such advances, the malignant potential of GIST remains variable, and few studies have reported their findings in patients with malignant GIST. Therefore, in the current study, the authors have reported their experience with FNAB as a diagnostic tool in one of the largest series of malignant GISTs and have analyzed the cytomorphologic features of the tumors relative to their clinical behavior to determine which, if any, cytologic features are indicators of malignancy.;All patients with histologically confirmed GIST who were diagnosed by image-guided FNAB and confirmed with positive CD117 staining from 1998 to 2003 were included in the study. All tumors were reviewed for various cytomorphologic features. For study purposes, the patients were divided into two groups: Group A included all patients with malignant tumors, defined as those with metastatic disease or recurrent disease after adequate surgery with or without chemotherapy; Group B included all other patients.;In total, 26 tumors from 23 patients (8 males and 15 females) with a mean age of 60.9 years were available for review. There were 14 primary tumors, 7 metastases (to the liver), and 5 recurrences. Twenty-one tumors were unequivocally malignant and were placed into Group A; the remaining 5 tumors were placed into Group B. The tumors in both groups were characterized by spindled or epithelioid cells with minimal nuclear atypia or pleomorphism and a moderate amount of cytoplasm. None of the cytologic features that were evaluated could distinguish reliably between benign tumors and malignant tumors, as expected. However, on cytologic examination, all tumors that demonstrated mitoses (n = 7 tumors) and/or pretreatment necrosis (n = 3 tumors) were identified as malignant.;FNAB remains a reliable method for the diagnosis of GIST. Immunohistochemical staining of cytologic material with CD117 has been reliable in establishing this diagnosis by FNAB, provided adequate tissue is procured. In the current study, the presence of necrosis or mitoses in cytologic specimens was correlated with a diagnosis of malignant GIST.",

The streak ovaries also contain small oocyte-free nodules with granulosa-like cells and often tumor-like structures. It has been hypothesized that these abnormal structures are of granulosa cell origin, and the aim of this study was to determine whether genes normally expressed in granulosa cells are also expressed in the nodules and tumor-like structures. The mRNAs encoding c-kit and its ligand stem cell factor (SCF), FSH receptor (FSH-R), follistatin, alpha-inhibin subunit, and the beta(A)- and beta(B)-activin/inhibin subunits were localized in ovaries of ewes with 0 (++), 1 (I+), or 2 (II) copies of the FecX(I) gene (n = 4-9 animals per genotype per gene) using in situ hybridization. Ontogeny of expression of all mRNAs examined was similar between ++ and I+ ewes. Expression of c-kit mRNA was observed in the oocyte of all follicular types present in ++, I+, and II ewes. Moreover, granulosa cells of type 2 (II) and type 2 and larger follicles (++, I+) expressed SCF mRNA. The mRNAs encoding FSH-R, follistatin, alpha-inhibin subunit, and beta(B)-activin/inhibin subunit were identified in type 3 and larger follicles of ++ and I+ ewes but not in follicles of II ewes that were only at the type 1, 1a, or 2 stages of development. However, the cells within the oocyte-free nodules of II ewes expressed all of these genes. The mRNAs encoding c-kit and beta(A)-activin/inhibin subunit were not observed in granulosa cells until antrum formation (type 5 follicles) or in the nodules of II ewes. Tumors from 4 ewes were obtained and classified as cystic, semisolid, or solid structures containing granulosa-like cells or as solid structures containing predominately fibroblast- and luteal-like cells. Often, two tumors were present on the same ovary. Tumors containing granulosa-like cells (n = 3-4 per gene) expressed the mRNAs encoding alpha-inhibin subunit, beta(A)-, and beta(B)-activin/inhibin subunits, follistatin, and the FSH-R but did not contain detectable amounts of mRNA for c-kit or SCF. Tumors composed predominately of fibroblast- and luteal-like cells expressed very low levels of SCF mRNA; of the other mRNAs examined, none were detected. Also, none of the genes examined were found to be expressed by the surface epithelium, theca externa, fibroblast, or vascular cells within the ovary of animals of any genotype. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the somatic cells in oocyte-free nodules and tumor-like tissue in II ewes originate from the granulosa cells of the small follicles.",

The physical examination revealed percussion tenderness over the right kidney region was noticed. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) indicated a right renal pelvic carcinoma, for which the patient underwent a radical right nephrectomy. Patient 2 was a 59-year-old male with a mass in the right kidney, located during a health examination and who exhibited no obvious clinical symptoms. The patient was clinically diagnosed with right renal carcinoma, confirmed by an enhanced CT. The patient underwent a radical right nephrectomy. The clinical features, imaging results, pathology, immune phenotypes, treatment and prognosis were analyzed. The associated literature was also reviewed. The cut surface of each tumor showed gray-white material with a central solid area, including scattered gray-brown necrotic and gray hemorrhagic areas and small cystic cavities. Microscopically, the arrangement of the tumor cells mimicked thyroid follicles with red-stained colloid-like material in the lumen. No renal hilar lymph node involvement was noted.

One patient had granulocytic sarcomas at two different sites. Hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections were reexamined. Blastic, poorly differentiated, and well differentiated histopathological variants were found in two, five and one cases, respectively. Immunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin-fixed tissue from all cases using a avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex technique.

In most cases these tumors are localized in the stomach and small intestine, more rarely in the esophagus and colon.Pluripotent mesenchymal cells are the suspected origin of GIST. The pathogenesis is obviously initiated by gene mutations, leading to an overexpression and activation of tyrosine kinase proteins. This activation is followed by uncontrolled proliferation and loss of apoptosis. The immunohistochemical detection of the protein CD 117 (c-kit) is an important diagnostic tool. Activating c-kit mutations are observed in most cases of GIST. Grading of GIST remains a problem. Size and mitotic rate are the most powerful predictive factors associated with malignant behavior. The most common symptoms of GIST are pain and gastrointestinal bleeding. Endoscopy, sonography, scintigraphy or radiology -- enteroclysma, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) -- are possible methods to detect a GIST. Surgical resection is the standard therapy of GIST. In cases of metastatic GIST, systemic therapy with imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, frequently leads to partial remission and clinical improvement. Only few side effects are described. Five patients with GIST are reported. In all cases gastrointestinal bleeding was the main symptom. All tumors were surgically resected, and no signs of recurrence or metastasis have been observed in any of the patients so far (19-51 months postoperatively).",

To study its biologic function in myeloid cells, dominant-negative PPARγ (dnPPARγ) was overexpressed in a myeloid-specific bitransgenic mouse model. In this bitransgenic system, overexpression of the dnPPARγ-Flag fusion protein in myeloid-lineage cells abnormally elevated frequencies and total numbers of IL-7Rα(-)Lin(-)c-Kit(+)Sca-1(-), Lin(-)/Scal(+)/c-Kit(+), common myeloid, and granulocyte-monocyte progenitor populations in the BM. dnPPARγ overexpression led to up-regulation of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα in the blood plasma. As a result, CD11b(+)Ly6G(+) cells were systemically increased in association with activation of Stat3, NF-κB, Erk1/2, and p38 molecules. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) inhibited the proliferation and lymphokine production of wild-type CD4+ T cells in vitro. CD4+ T cells from doxycycline-treated bitransgenic mice displayed reduced proliferation and lymphokine release. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell populations were decreased in doxycycline-treated bitransgenic mice. Multiple forms of carcinoma and sarcoma in the lung, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes were observed in doxycycline-treated bitransgenic mice. BM transplantation revealed that a myeloid-autonomous defect was responsible for MDSC expansion, immunosuppression, and tumorigenesis in these mice. These studies suggest that anti-inflammatory PPARγ in myeloid-lineage cells plays a key role in controlling pro-inflammatory cytokine synthesis, MDSC expansion, immunosuppression, and the development of cancer.",

Primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the vagina is a rare entity with only 25 previously reported cases in the literature. In previous reports, these tumors have not been distinguished from primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin (Merkel cell carcinoma). The tumor was composed of cells that showed neuroendocrine-type nuclear features with hyperchromasia, nuclear molding, occasional small nucleoli, and a chromatin pattern that was finely granular. The tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin 20 (CK20), neuron specific enolase, pancytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, and chromogranin A expression. Ki-67, a marker of proliferation, was also positive in>90% of cells. The tumor cells showed intense expression of Bcl-2 oncoprotein and mild to moderate expression of c-KIT. Synaptophysin, neurofilament, CD45, CD56, CD10, S-100, HMB-45, cytokeratin 7, and thyroid transcription factor 1 were negative. This pattern of staining is consistent with a Merkel cell carcinoma.

We utilized two-dimensional electrophoresis and tandem MS to compare and identify differentially expressed proteins between dPVTT and PT tissues. Of the 65 spots identified as differentially expressed (p < 0.05) between the two cancerous tissues, 19 (corresponding to 19 unique proteins) were identified. Further analysis of five proteins confirmed quantitative differences between the two tumor tissues. Upon comparison with PT tissues of HCC, c-kit was also significantly upregulated in dPVTTs in small HCC patients and the CSQT-2 cell line derived from dPVTT tissues, which validated the differences between the dPVTT and PT tissues. The protein expression profiles and proteins identified in this study demonstrate the presence of dPVTTs with more malignant phenotypes and will be useful in clarifying the mechanisms through which dPVTT develops.

Meanwhile, anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) remains a fatal malignancy for which there are currently no effective curative interventions. In chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, imatinib inhibits the constitutive tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL and c-KIT, respectively. Reports suggest that imatinib may also be effective against ABL and platelet-derived growth factor receptor kinase-dependent pathological conditions. These mechanisms provide a wide scope of possible clinical applications for the drug. Potentially, diseases instigated by constitutive kinase activity that can be inhibited with imatinib should be treatable with this drug. We evaluated the effects of imatinib on the viability, cycling, and tyrosine phosphorylation of ATC cells in vitro. Our data indicate that imatinib has negligible antineoplastic activity against ATC cell lines within established therapeutically useful concentrations. No constitutive kinase activity was detected in these cell lines that could be exploited as a therapeutic target by imatinib.

In tumor-free urinary bladder and chronic cystitis, CD34+ fibrocytes were found in the deep lamina propria and tunica muscularis, whereas the superficial lamina propria disclosed a CD34-negative and alpha-SMA-positive fibrocyte-like cell.

Loss of hematopoietic stem cell function was associated with decreased expression of Cdkn1a (encoding the cell cycle inhibitor p21(cdk)), Sfpi1, Hoxb4 and Bmi1 (encoding the transcription factors PU.1, HoxB4 and Bmi-1, respectively) and altered integrin expression in Lin(-)Sca-1(+)c-Kit(+) cells, whereas PU.1 was upregulated in erythroid progenitors.

The use of differential cytokeratins, primarily CK7 and CK20, as well as Cdx-2, beta-catenin, and P504S in differentiating between metastatic adenocarcinoma, particularly of colorectal origin, and primary ovarian carcinoma is discussed. Dpc4 may be useful in distinguishing pancreatic from ovarian mucinous carcinomas, because up to 55% of pancreatic carcinomas lack Dpc4 expression, whereas the differential expression of mucin genes may be helpful in distinguishing between primary ovarian mucinous and metastatic tumors. Urothelial markers (thrombomodulin and uroplakin III) and renal cell carcinoma markers (CD10 and renal cell carcinoma marker) can be helpful in the diagnosis of metastatic urothelial and renal cell tumors to the ovary.

        "Doc_abstract":"Although mast cells (MC) appear to be myeloid cells, MC lineage involvement in myelogenous malignancies has been described only rarely. Based on clonal evolution, biology of afflicted cells, and disease criteria, three major groups of patients have been recognized: The first meets criteria for both diagnoses 'systemic mastocytosis' and 'associated hematologic clonal non-mast cell lineage disease (AHNMD)'. In such patients, myeloproliferative (MPS) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is diagnosed apart from mastocytosis. In a second group of patients, large numbers of very immature MC-lineage cells (metachromatically granulated blast-like cells) are detectable, but the criteria to diagnose mastocytosis are not met. These patients have advanced myeloid neoplasms (MDS or MPS with blast cell increase, or AML) and variably suffer from mediator-related symptoms (flush, GI-tract ulcer, diarrhoea, coagulopathy). In some cases, the disease mimics mast cell- or basophilic leukemia. In contrast to basophilic leukemia, however, the metachromatic cells are strongly KIT+ and tryptase+. In contrast to true mast cell leukemia (MCL), MC do not form multifocal dense infiltrates in the bone marrow. Also, MC lack CD2 and CD25, and the C-KIT mutation Asp-816-Val. We propose the term 'myelomastocytic leukemia' or 'myelodysplastic mast cell syndrome' for these cases. In a third group of patients, myeloid neoplasms (MDS, MPS, AML) show constitutive expression of MC-associated antigens (tryptase, histamine) or mastocytosis-related gene defects (mutated C-KIT) without significant increase in metachromatic cells or criteria of mastocytosis. Whether these neoplasms display aberrant gene expression (or gene defects) or represent 'pre-pre-mast cell leukemias', remains unknown.",

SS bear the t(X;18)(p11.2,q11.2) translocation, which proved to be specific for this tumor type and is currently considered one of the most reliable diagnostic criteria. To evaluate the sensitivity of immunohistochemical techniques in diagnosing monophasic fibrous SS (MFSS) and poorly differentiated SS (PDSS), we examined 60 t(X;18)(SYT-SSX)-positive cases (47 MFSS and 13 PDSS) for cytokeratin AE1/AE3, cytokeratin KL1, epithelial membrane antigen, E-cadherin, CD34, S-100 protein, alpha-smooth muscle actin, desmin, h-caldesmon, CD99, bcl2, and C-kit (CD117) antibodies. Of the four epithelial markers tested, epithelial membrane antigen proved to be the most sensitive, reacting with 100% of MFSS and 92% of PDSS, followed by cytokeratin AE1/AE3 (70% of MFSS, 46% of PDSS), cytokeratin KL1 (49% of MFSS, 38% of PDSS), and E-cadherin (47% of MFSS, 54% of PDSS). A staining for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and/or E-cadherin was observed in 79% of MFSS and 69% of PDSS, and a staining for cytokeratin KL1 and/or E-cadherin was observed in 74% of MFSS and 62% of PDSS. S-100 protein was positive in 38% of MFSS and 23% of PDSS, and alpha-smooth muscle actin in 21% of MFSS and 8% of PDSS. Tumor cells were rarely positive for CD34 (6% of MFSS, 0% of PDSS) and desmin (2% of MFSS, 0% of PDSS). Most SS were strongly positive for bcl-2 (91% of MFSS, 92% of PDSS) and CD99 (91% of MFSS, 100% of PDSS). A weak and focal cytoplasmic reactivity for CD117 was observed in 11% of MFSS (only one case had a strong immunoreactivity) and 8% of PDSS. Staining with h-caldesmon was consistently negative. In conclusion, in keeping with literature data, our results show that reactivity for epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin AE1/AE3, and E-cadherin, in combination with CD34 negativity, are the most useful and sensitive markers for diagnosing monophasic fibrous and poorly differentiated t(X;18)-positive SS. They also support the fact that about one third of MFSS and one fourth of PDSS are positive for S-100 protein, a finding of diagnostic relevance when considering their distinction from other spindle to round cell sarcomas, especially malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.",

In this study the reported incidence of GIST and GIST-like tumours before and after the routine availability of the specific diagnostic marker CD117 antigen was investigated. All patients with GIST or GIST-like tumours were selected from PALGA, a nation-wide network and registry of histo- and cytopathology in the Netherlands, to calculate the incidence in 1995 and longitudinally over time between 1998 and 2003. Pathological reports were retrieved to assess the type of immunostaining used and to assess the risk category for malignant behaviour according to the recently published consensus criteria. The annual incidence of GIST as distilled from the national pathology registry increased from 2.1 per million inhabitants in 1995 to 12.7 per million inhabitants in 2003. The incidence of GIST-like tumours decreased from 17.6 per million inhabitants in 1995 to 12.7 per million inhabitants in 2003. The incidences were stable from 2000 onwards. Additional analysis in 2003 indicated that more than 90% of the GIST tested was CD117 positive, compared to only 4% of the GIST-like tumours. Almost 50% of the GIST was considered to be at high-risk for malignant behaviour, according to the consensus criteria. The increased incidence of GIST 1995-2003 is related to increased understanding of GIST pathobiology and the routine availability of the diagnostic immunohistochemical antibody directed against the CD117 antigen.",

Immunohistochemical staining was performed using a panel of antibodies to determine muscle and neural differentiation, the incidence of CD117 and CD34 expression, as well as bcl-2 and cytokeratin expression. Each stain was interpreted as negative or positive. The staining intensity of positive cases was graded as weak, moderate or strong.;The age range was 25-80 with an average age of 54 and a male:female ratio of 3:2. The stomach was the most common site for these tumors, followed by the small intestine. Histologically, 46% were classified as malignant and 54% were benign. Most of the malignant tumors occurred in males, particularly in the stomach or small intestine. There was no significant difference in patient age between malignant and benign tumors. The most sensitive markers were muscle-specific actin for muscle differentiation and glial fibrillary acidic protein for neural differentiation. CD117 expression was seen in 81% and CD34 in 54% of all tumors.;The results of this study show that the stomach is the most common site for these tumors, that malignant tumors are more likely to occur in the small intestine than in the stomach, and that there is no difference between benign and malignant tumors with regard to age.

Although the histologic features of DF/DT are well described, there is a paucity of literature regarding cytologic findings.;The surgical pathology files of The Johns Hopkins Hospital revealed 17 patients with a diagnosis of DF/DT with prior cytology in a 16-year period (1989-2005). The clinicoradiologic findings were noted, and the fine-needle aspiration (FNA) slides were available for review in 8 patients. In patients with archived tissue, an immunohistochemical panel was performed that included beta-catenin, desmin, CD-34, and c-kit.;There was a wide age range and a wide range of anatomic distribution for DF/DT in this series. Eleven patients (65%) had a prior history of surgery at or near the site of DF/DT. Radiologically, 5 of 11 patients (45%) who had in-house studies available and no history of DF/DT were diagnosed as suspicious for malignancy. Predominantly bland spindled cells with long, fusiform nuclei and metachromatic matrix material were present in most tumors. The tumor cells were present both singly and as fragments embedded in the matrix. Nine patients had paraffin-embedded tissue samples available for immunohistochemical staining. Six of those samples demonstrated nuclear beta-catenin reactivity, and all 9 samples were negative for desmin, CD-34, and c-kit.;The current results indicated that clinical history in patients with suspected DF/DT is important. Because of the infiltrative nature of DF/DT, the radiographic impression often is over-called as suspicious for malignancy. The cytomorphology is nonspecific, often resulting in descriptive diagnoses. Immunohistochemical stains increase the yield of FNA.",

Subsequently, female BALB/c nude mice were subcutaneously injected with either 10(6) or 2.5 × 10(6) Calu-3 (human adenocarcinoma cell line able to reproducibly induce xenografted tumours) alone or in combination with equal doses of hLc-MCs. Control animals were injected with the two doses of hLc-MCs only.;Primary cultures of hLc-MCs were obtained from >80% of NSCLC specimens. The typical MCs immunophenotype was documented by the expression of CD90, CD105, CD73, CD13 and CD44 at fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. CD45, CD14, CD34 and epithelial antigens were negative while CD117 (c-kit) and CD133 (prominin) were partially expressed. Interestingly, nuclear transcription factors octamer-binding transcription factor 3/4 and sex determining region Y-box 2 involved in stemness, thyroid transcription factor 1 in bronchoalveolar commitment, and ETS1 in carcinogenesis, were expressed in hLc-MCs isolated from NSCLC. Specific conditioned media and cocultures confirmed the supportive role of hLc-MCs for cancer cells. In vivo experiments showed that at both doses Calu-3 xenografts doubled in size when hLc-MCs were coinjected. Cell tracking in xenografted tumours, by immunofluorescence combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, documented hX-chromosome-labelled, Calu-3-derived cytokeratin-positive adenocarcinoma structures surrounded by hLc-MCs.;Tumour-propagating cells require the inductive interaction of resident mesenchymal cells to foster lung cancer development.",

While clonal pCSCs can develop into various types of tissue cells in immunocompetent mice without developing into cancer, they often develop, however, into leukemic or solid cancers composed of various types of cancer cells in immunodeficient mice. The progress of the pCSCs to cancers is associated with the up-regulation of c-kit and Sca-1, as well as with lineage markers. Mechanistically, the pCSCs are regulated by the PIWI/AGO family gene called piwil2.

        "Doc_abstract":"Dasatinib is an orally available broad-spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is widely used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia. It is also in clinical trials for the treatment of other malignancies, including solid tumors. Despite its wide use, little is known of its effects on normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Here, we study wild-type mice dosed with dasatinib and find that it causes the transient induction of proliferation of quiescent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). This finding was unexpected given the ability of dasatinib to inhibit c-Kit signaling and promote cell cycle arrest in many cell types. The transient induction of HSC proliferation in dasatinib-dosed mice coincided with a marked induction in the expression of Sca-1 and phospho-S6. Also evident at this time was a rapid but transient loss of lineage-committed hematopoietic progenitors that express high levels of c-Kit and the induction of stem cell factor in the serum. These findings suggest that activation of quiescent HSCs is part of a rapid rescue response that restores hematopoietic progenitors to pretreatment levels. This restoration coincides with HSCs returning to quiescence, and the expression of Sca-1 and phospho-S6 reverting to pre-treatment levels, even though dasatinib dosing is maintained. These data suggest that equilibrium is reached between the opposing forces of dasatinib and hematopoietic growth factors. The transient induction of HSC proliferation provided a window of opportunity whereby these cells became sensitive to killing by the cytotoxic drug 5-fluorouracil. ",

Interferon-α and interleukin-2 were previously utilized in a limited number of patients with good performance status due to toxicity and safety issues. Over the last decade, through advances in the understanding of the biology and pathology of RCC, the important role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in RCC has been identified. Data from randomized trials have led to the approval of first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) sorafenib, sunitinib, and pazopanib; however, these agents inhibit a wide variety of kinase targets and are associated with a range of adverse effects. More recently, a new generation TKI, axitinib, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Tivozanib is a novel TKI, which is a potent inhibitor of VEGF-1, VEGF-2, VEGF-3, c-kit, and PDGR kinases, with a more restricted target spectrum. Phase II and III studies have demonstrated significant activity and a favorable safety profile as an initial targeted treatment for advanced RCC. This review examines the emerging data with tivozanib for the treatment of advanced RCC. Preclinical investigations as well as Phase I, II, and III data are examined; data on the comparative benefits of tivozanib are reviewed. Finally, we discuss the future potential of tivozanib in combination, biomarkers associated with tivozanib response, and acquisition of resistance and nonkidney cancer indications. ",

Prognosis, especially for locally advanced stages (IIB - IVB) and metastasis, remains poor: more than third of cases will present local and/or metastatic recurrence. Overall 5-year survival for all NPC stages ranges from 50% to 70%. The role of chemotherapy in metastasis is well established, and remains an important palliative treatment, although no randomized trial has been reported comparing the different chemotherapy regimens. As 1(st)-line treatment, platin-based regimens seems optimal; in 2(nd) line and after progression under platins, there is no consensus: monotherapy with drugs such as gemcitabine, capecitabine or taxanes has been the most widely tested, with acceptable results. Future trials should integrate targeted therapy, in the light of overexpression of EGFR1 and C-kit in NPC. The present study presents a review of the literature concerning the various studies of metastatic NPC.",

Immunohistochemical study was carried out and the literature was reviewed.;All of the five patients with MEST were females. Their median age was 45 years. For CN, there were 3 males and 1 female and their median age was 41 years. All patients presented with loin pain and hematuria. On gross examination, MEST was well-circumscribed but non-encapsulated. There was no evidence of haemorrhage or necrosis. Three of the cases were solid in nature. One was composed of a mixture of solid and cystic elements, while the remaining case showed a multicystic cut surface bridged by thick fibrous septa. On the other hand, CN were well-circumscribed and encapsulated. They were multiloculated cystic in nature. The cystic spaces were separated by thin septa and there was no significant solid or necrotic component. Histologically, MEST consisted of proliferation of cystically dilated glands admixed with spindly stromal cells with various cellularity and growth patterns. Both the glandular and stromal elements were well-differentiated with no cytologic atypia identified. The glandular structures in 2 of the cases were partially lined by endometrial or tubal epithelium. In contrast, the thin-walled cystic spaces in CN were lined by a single layer of epithelium.Immunohistochemical study showed that the epithelial cells were positive for pan-cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen. The spindle cells in MEST expressed vimentin (5/5), smooth muscle actin (3/5), desmin (4/5), CD10 (5/5), estrogen receptor (4/5) and progesterone receptor (4/5). They were negative for HMB45, CD34, CD117 and S-100 protein. On the other hand, the spindle cells in CN were variably positive for vimentin (4/4), smooth muscle actin (4/4), desmin (1/4), estrogen receptor (3/4) and progesterone receptor (1/4). They were negative for CD10, HMB45, CD34, CD117 and S-100 protein.;Both MEST and CN are uncommon renal neoplasm. Most of them run a benign clinical course. The stromal cells in MEST show smooth muscle or myofibroblastic differentiation. Areas demonstrating Müllerian features also existed in some cases. MEST and CN share overlapping histological and immunohistochemical features, and may represent spectrum of the same group of lesions.",

While Kit inhibitors have activity in the clinical setting, they possess variable efficacy against particular forms of mutant Kit and drug resistance often develops over time. Inhibitors of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), a chaperone for which Kit is a client protein, have demonstrated activity against human cancers and evidence suggests they downregulate several mutated and imatinib-resistant forms of Kit. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a novel HSP90 inhibitor, STA-9090, against wild-type (WT) and mutant Kit in canine bone marrow-derived cultured mast cells (BMCMCs), malignant mast cell lines, and fresh malignant mast cells.;BMCMCs, cell lines, and fresh malignant mast cells were treated with STA-9090, 17-AAG, and SU11654 and evaluated for loss in cell viability, cell death, alterations in HSP90 and Kit expression/signaling, and Kit mutation. STA-9090 activity was tested in a canine mastocytoma xenograft model.;Treatment of BMCMCs, cell lines, and fresh malignant cells with STA-9090 induced growth inhibition, apoptosis that was caspase-3/7-dependent, and downregulation of phospho/total Kit and Akt, but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) or phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI-3K). Loss of Kit cell-surface expression was also observed. Furthermore, STA-9090 exhibited superior activity to 17-AAG and SU11654, and was effective against malignant mast cells expressing either WT or mutant Kit. Lastly, STA-9090 inhibited tumor growth in a canine mastocytoma mouse xenograft model.;STA-9090 exhibits broad activity against mast cells expressing WT or mutant Kit, suggesting it may be an effective agent in the clinical setting against mast cell malignancies.",

The 7 cases of neuroendocrine carcinoma consisted of 6 low grade neuroendocrine tumors (carcinoids) and 1 high grade neuroendocrine carcinoma (small cell carcinoma). All were submucosal lesions. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for two or more of synaptophysin, chromogranin, neuron-specific enolase, CD56. In small cell carcinoma, KIT and PDGFRA were consistently positive. The 3 cases of malignant lymphoma were diffuse large B-cell lymphomas positive for CD20 and CD79a and negative for NK/T cell markers. The two cases of GIST was spindle cell type, and the risk was intermediate. Kit mutations were recognized in both GISTs. No PDGFRA mutations were seen. Of the 3 metastatic carcinomas, one was a metastasis from prostatic adenocarcinoma, and the remaining two was adenocarcinoma of unknown primary sites.",

We collected 10 cases of ChRCC with a distinct multicystic pattern out of 733 ChRCCs from our registry, and subsequently analyzed these by morphology, immunohistochemistry, and array comparative genomic hybridization. Of the 10 patients, 6 were males with an age range of 50-89 years (mean 68, median 69). Tumor size ranged between 1.2 and 20 cm (mean 5.32, median 3). Clinical follow-up was available for seven patients, ranging 1-19 years (mean 7.2, median 2.5). No aggressive behavior was documented. We observed two growth patterns, which were similar in all tumors: (1) variable-sized cysts, resembling multilocular cystic neoplasm of low malignant potential and (2) compressed cystic and tubular pattern with slit-like spaces. Raisinoid nuclei were consistently present while necrosis was absent in all cases. Half of the cases showed eosinophilic/oncocytic cytology, deposits of pigment (lipochrome) and microcalcifications. The other half was composed of pale or mixed cell populations. Immunostains for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), CK7, OSCAR, CD117, parvalbumin, MIA, and Pax 8 were positive in all tumors while negative for vimentin, TFE3, CANH 9, HMB45, cathepsin K, and AMACR. Ki67 immunostain was positive in up to 1 % of neoplastic cells. Molecular genetic examination revealed multiple chromosomal losses in two fifths analyzable tumors, while three cases showed no chromosomal numerical aberrations. ChRCC are rarely arranged in a prominent multicystic pattern, which is probably an extreme form of the microcystic adenomatoid pigmented variant of ChRCC. The spectrum of tumors entering the differential diagnosis of ChRCC is quite different from that of conventional ChRCC. The immunophenotype of ChRCC is identical with that of conventional ChRCC. Chromosomal numerical aberration pattern was variable; no chromosomal numerical aberrations were found in three cases. All the cases in this series have shown an indolent and non-aggressive behavior.",

The mass was composed mainly of solid neoplastic epithelial cells, closely packed, branching, and anastomosing in slender tubules.

Functional P-gp expression was examined by Rhodamine-123 efflux test, and estimated with the data by RT-PCR method. In mature lymphoid malignancies, the cells of T or natural killer (NK) cell malignancies frequently expressed P-gp/MDR1. In AML, frequent P-gp/MDR1 expression was associated with the expression of CD7 or c-kit and with 8; 21 chromosomal translocation (p < 0.01), which were thought to be the characteristics of the hematopoietic stem cell. Though the expression of P-gp/MDR1 was more frequent at onset than at relapse phase, the increase is thought to result from the expansion of blastic fraction expressing P-gp/MDR1. In ALL, P-gp/MDR1 expression was not frequent in B-cell precursor lineage (three of eighteen patients), but the incidence was high in CD7(+) surface CD3(-) cases (seven of the cases). These results indicate P-gp/MDR1 expression is more frequently in the tumor of T, NK cell and stem cell, reflecting the characteristics of its normal counterpart.",

Statistical analyses were performed to identify possible predictors of malignant behavior. One hundred and eighteen out of 169 (70%) mesenchymal tumors were GISTs.

Eighteen cases (16%) showed malignant behavior, with local recurrence in eight cases and distant metastases in 11 cases. Fifteen of 114 (13%) patients died of disease within 74 months, whereas 63 (55%) patients were still alive after a median period of 78 months. At multivariate analysis, high-risk category (according to Fletcher's criteria), omental/colorectal site, and younger patient age were independent predictors of malignant behavior.

SNP-A complements traditional metaphase cytogenetics with the unique ability to delineate a previously hidden chromosomal defect, copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH). Emerging data demonstrate that selected hematologic malignancies exhibit abundant CN-LOH, often in the setting of a normal metaphase karyotype and no previously identified clonal marker. In this review, we explore emerging biologic and clinical features of CN-LOH relevant to hematologic malignancies. In myeloid malignancies, CN-LOH has been associated with the duplication of oncogenic mutations with concomitant loss of the normal allele. Examples include JAK2, MPL, c-KIT, and FLT3. More recent investigations have focused on evaluation of candidate genes contained in common CN-LOH and deletion regions and have led to the discovery of tumor suppressor genes, including c-CBL and family members, as well as TET2. Investigations into the underlying mechanisms generating CN-LOH have great promise for elucidating general cancer mechanisms. We anticipate that further detailed characterization of CN-LOH lesions will probably facilitate our discovery of a more complete set of pathogenic molecular lesions, disease and prognosis markers, and better understanding of the initiation and progression of hematologic malignancies.",

The spectrum of canine melanocytic neoplasia includes benign lesions with some analogy to nevi, as well as invasive primary melanoma, and widespread metastasis. Growing evidence of distinct subtypes in humans, differing in somatic and predisposing germ-line genetic alterations, cell of origin, epidemiology, relationship to ultraviolet radiation and progression from benign to malignant tumors, may also exist in dogs. Canine and human mucosal melanomas appear to harbor BRAF, NRAS, and c-kit mutations uncommonly, compared with human cutaneous melanomas, although both species share AKT and MAPK signaling activation.

        "Doc_abstract":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract. The concept of GIST and the definition of GIST pathology have evolved greatly over the past 5 years. GIST has been shown to share immunohistochemical, ultrastructural and histogenic similarities with the interstitial cells of Cajal. Both GIST and the interstitial cells of Cajal express KIT, the receptor tyrosine kinase that is the protein product of the c-kit proto-oncogene. KIT is universally phosphorylated in GISTs. Sequencing of c-kit complementary DNA from human GIST cells has demonstrated a high frequency of mutations that lead to constitutive activation of the KIT tyrosine kinase in the absence of stimulation by its physiologic ligand (stem cell factor). This, in turn, causes uncontrolled stimulation of downstream signaling cascades with aberrant cellular proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. Historically, malignant GIST has been highly refractory to conventional cytotoxic therapy. Signal transduction inhibition as cancer therapy was first tested successfully with imatinib mesylate (formerly known as STI571), a selective small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, with the initial target being blockade of Bcr-Abl, the oncogene with tyrosine kinase activity responsible for the pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Imatinib was subsequently shown to block activity of the KIT tyrosine kinase as well, and in laboratory studies this led to apoptotic death of GIST cells. The first GIST patient to receive imatinib exhibited dramatic benefit despite far-advanced metastatic disease that was previously refractory to all chemotherapy. Subsequently, multicenter clinical trials have been performed to assess the safety, efficacy and biologic activity of imatinib in patients with advanced GIST. The results from these studies have established imatinib as an effective new therapeutic alternative for the majority of patients with advanced GIST, a solid tumor for which no prior chemotherapy has ever shown antitumor efficacy. This work provides proof of concept to the hypothesis that selective inhibition of aberrant signal transduction can provide important anticancer activity, if the proper signaling pathways are identified and blocked.",

Twenty paired samples of SLN metastases and their corresponding primary breast tumors (PBT) were investigated for DNA copy number changes using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Non-random DNA copy number changes were observed in all the lesions analyzed, with gains being more common than losses. In 75% of the cases there was at least one change common to both PBT and SLN.

        "Doc_abstract":"Yolk sac tumors (YSTs) have a variety of morphologic patterns, some of which can resemble either endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EAC) or clear cell carcinoma (CCC). Immunohistochemical staining for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is usually only focal and thus is not always helpful in the diagnosis of YST, and pancytokeratin (CK) is expressed by all three tumors. We studied a battery of immunohistochemical markers with specific attention to the utility of cytokeratin 7 (CK7) in differentiating YST from EAC and CCC. A total of 46 ovarian tumors were retrieved for this study: 16 YST, 19 EAC, and 11 CCC. The three groups were analyzed for the expression of CK7, AFP, Leu-M1 (CD15), EMA, and WT1 by immunohistochemistry. In addition, CK and c-kit (CD117) were studied in the YSTs. All of the YSTs tested (100%) were positive for CK. CK7 was considered negative in all 16 YST cases (100%), although a few tumor cells (1%-2%) stained in 4 cases. In contrast, 17 of 19 EACs and all 11 CCCs had diffuse 3+ to 4+ positivity for CK7; the two other EACs showed 2+ positivity for CK7 (40% and 30% of the tumors). AFP was positive in 12 of 15 YSTs (80%), but was generally focal with 1+ staining in 10 cases (67%); only 2 cases were 3+. All of the EACs and CCCs were negative for AFP. Leu-M1 was 1+ in 9 of 15 YSTs (60%), while the remaining 6 were considered negative. Leu-M1 was positive in 10 of 15 EACs tested (67%), but the staining was variable with 1 case 3+, 3 cases 2+, and 6 cases 1+. In the CCCs, 10 cases (91%) were 3+ to 4+, and 1 case was 1+. EMA was essentially negative in 15 of 15 YSTs (100%), with 3 completely negative and 12 showing very focal (<5%) staining. Eight of 12 EACs showed 4+ staining, 3 showed 3+ staining, and 1 showed 2+ staining. All of the 11 CCCs (100%) showed 4+ staining. WT1 was negative in all cases of YST and CCC; 16 of 18 EAC tested (89%) were negative for WT1, but 2 (11%) were 4+ positive. C-kit was negative in all YSTs. In conclusion, it is important for pathologists to be aware that YSTs may mimic EACs and CCCs and that this distinction is important for the clinical management of patients with these tumors. AFP staining is focal in most YST, so an absence of staining does not exclude this diagnosis. CK7 and EMA are essentially negative in YST but are diffusely positive in CCC and EAC, making them useful markers for differentiating YSTs from both CCCs and EACs. Leu-M1 may also be helpful for distinguishing YSTs from CCCs.",

However, reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens in patients with nonhematologic malignancies have not led to long-term engraftment unless a selective advantage was present for the transplanted donor cells. Similar findings have also been observed in a number of large animal studies. Inadequate myelosuppression levels were thought to be responsible for the outcomes. To address this issue several innovative protocols in small animals have been presented with selective hematopoietic myelosuppression and less systemic toxicity. Such protocols promised to curb the transplant-related morbidity and mortality in myeloablative conditioning and provide effective long-term engraftment, especially in patients with gene-corrected autografts. In the present study we have tested some of these promising RIC regimens in nonhuman primates, a clinically relevant large animal model. Our data suggest that transient myelosuppression induced by anti-c-Kit antibody in conjunction with low-dose irradiation may lead to long-term engraftment, albeit at low levels. The animals with busulfan conditioning with or without anti-c-Kit that received gene-modified autologous transplants with green fluorescent protein expression had similar myelosuppression, but failed long-term engraftment and despite immunosuppressive treatment had all the hallmarks seen previously in similar models without immunosuppression. Our preliminary data expand current knowledge of RIC and emphasize the need to explore whether specific and directed myelosuppression alone is adequate in the absence of microenvironmental modulation, or whether innovative combinations are necessary for safe and effective engraftment.",

However, recently published studies indicate that canine seminomas can be classified as classical and spermatocytic seminomas in a similar way as in man, and that classical seminomas comprise a substantial proportion of seminomas in the dog. These two factors both contribute to increasing the potential of canine seminoma as a relevant model for human testicular cancer. The aim of the present study was to characterise seminoma in Norwegian dogs using morphology and immunohistochemistry, and determine whether these tumours are comparable with human classical seminoma.;By applying diagnostic criteria from human pathology, 45 seminomas from the Norwegian Canine Cancer Register were examined histologically with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stains. All sections were stained immunohistochemically with antibodies against human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) and the transmembrane receptor c-KIT.;Although two of the seminomas showed immunohistochemical staining characteristics indicative of classical seminoma (PLAP+/c-KIT+), all 45 examined seminomas were morphologically consistent with spermatocytic seminoma.;The value of canine seminoma as a model for SE in man remains unclear. Among the 45 investigated tumours from Norwegian dogs, none were classified as classical seminoma based on morphological criteria consistent with human seminomas.

These tumors originate from a transformed primordial germ cell/gonocyte, known as carcinoma in situ (CIS), that is able to generate all differentiation lineages (omnipotent). The c-KIT-stem cell factor pathway is of relevance for development of this cancer. Retention of embryonic characteristics probably explains the unique treatment responsiveness to DNA-damaging agents. OCT3/4, a marker of pluripotency, is the optimal diagnostic marker for seminoma and embryonal carcinoma, and CIS, the latter also in semen, suitable for non-invasive screening.

Sorafenib markedly decreased 2-week survival relative to vehicle-treated controls, but echocardiography at 1 and 2 weeks post MI detected no differences in cardiac function. Sorafenib-treated hearts had significantly smaller diastolic and systolic volumes and reduced heart weights. High doses of sorafenib induced necrotic death of isolated myocytes in vitro, but lower doses did not induce myocyte death or affect inotropy. Histological analysis documented increased myocyte cross-sectional area despite smaller heart sizes after sorafenib treatment, further suggesting myocyte loss. Sorafenib caused apoptotic cell death of cardiac- and bone-derived c-kit+ stem cells in vitro and decreased the number of BrdU+ (5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine+) myocytes detected at the infarct border zone in fixed tissues. Sorafenib had no effect on infarct size, fibrosis, or post-MI neovascularization. When sorafenib-treated animals received metoprolol treatment post MI, the sorafenib-induced increase in post-MI mortality was eliminated, cardiac function was improved, and myocyte loss was ameliorated.;Sorafenib cardiotoxicity results from myocyte necrosis rather than from any direct effect on myocyte function. Surviving myocytes undergo pathological hypertrophy. Inhibition of c-kit+ stem cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis exacerbates damage by decreasing endogenous cardiac repair. In the setting of MI, which also causes large-scale cell loss, sorafenib cardiotoxicity dramatically increases mortality.",

Combination of interferon with tyrosine kinase inhibitors of epithelial growth factor receptor [gefitinib (Iressa)] or c-Kit and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta [imatinib (Gleevec)] was evaluated for efficacy and safety. Patients with MRCC received 12-week cycles of interferon [3 million units (MU) subcutaneously thrice in week 1 and 6 MU thrice weekly thereafter] and either gefitinib (500 mg daily) or imatinib (600 mg daily). The gefitinib/imatinib dose was reduced as needed owing to toxicity. The primary endpoint was objective tumor response. Secondary endpoints were time to tumor progression, overall survival, and safety. Seventeen patients were enrolled. Most had clear cell [36% (6/17)] or papillary [36% (6/17)] tumors. Most (n=14) were treated on the gefitinib arm, including two patients who crossed over from the imatinib arm after experiencing disease progression. Objective tumor responses were evaluable in 14 patients (82%). Of these 14, partial responses occurred in three (21%), stable disease in seven (50%), and progressive disease in four (29%). The most frequent treatment-related adverse events were skin rash, flu-like symptoms, and fatigue (both treatment arms); diarrhea (gefitinib arm only); and thrombocytopenia and leukopenia (imatinib arm only). Median time to tumor progression (range) for patients on the gefitinib arm only was 4.27 (1.13-15.97) months and median overall survival (range) was 11.42+ (1.13-29.07+) months.

In addition to its classic morphologic features, focal clear cells were also identified within the tumor, thereby expanding the morphologic spectrum of the neoplasm at this location. A comprehensive immunohistochemical characterization of the tumor was performed, as was microsatellite instability testing. The tumor was diagnosed in a 79-year-old woman and was surgically/pathologically staged as IB by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) criteria. The tumor displayed typical morphologic features (tumor cells with a syncytial appearance in an inflammatory background) with the exception of the aforementioned polygonal cells with well-defined cell membranes and cytoplasmic clarity in <1% of the tumor. The epithelial component showed strong and diffuse immunoreactivity for CAM 5.2, p53, p16, E-cadherin, cytokeratin (CK) 7, vimentin, CKAE1/3, and epithelial membrane antigen. The MIB-1 proliferative index in these regions was about 70%. Approximately 10% to 30% of lesional cells showed strong immunoreactivity for CK903, S100, MOC31, CD138, but the pattern of positivity was patchy and discontinuous. The epithelial cells were entirely negative for CK5/6, smooth muscle actin, p504S, CK20, synaptophysin, chromogranin, CD56, CD99, WT-1, thyroid transcription factor-1, p63, CD117 (c-kit), CD34, calretinin, desmin, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, FLI-1, ALK-1, D2-40, cytomegalovirus antigen, Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA-1, Epstein-Barr virus, monoclonal carcinoembryonic antigen, and HER2/neu. The foci with clear cells were not immunophenotypically distinct from the non-clear cell areas and had an approximately similar proliferative index. The inflammatory component was mixed (lymphocytes, histiocytes, plasma cells, neutrophils) but was composed predominantly of CD45/CD3/CD8 T lymphocytes, with a CD3 to CD20 ratio of approximately 10:1 and CD8 to CD4 T-cell ratio of approximately 3:1. Numerous (>100 positive cells per 10 high-power fields) S100-positive tumor-infiltrating Langerhans cells were present. The tumor DNA did not exhibit microsatellite instability at any of the loci analyzed. In summary, the limited data available suggest that lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma is a distinct histotype of endometrial carcinoma that is typically seen in postmenopausal women, seems to be unrelated to the Epstein-Barr virus, and has an uncertain prognosis. Differential diagnostic and pathogenetic considerations are discussed within the context of the lesional morphologic and immunophenotypic profile as described herein and in previously reported cases.

In 32 cases of the undifferentiated type and 37 cases of the relatively differentiated types, we immunohistochemically examined the expressions of myoepithelial markers and KIT, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and c-erbB-2 oncoproteins. Vimentin, S-100, and alpha-smooth muscle actin were positive in 28 (88%), 22 (69%), and 15 (47%) of the undifferentiated types, but were positive in seven (19%), one (3%), and one (3%) of relatively differentiated types (P < 0.0001).

The mean neopterin levels were lower in the malignant tumour groups than in healthy animals but differences were statistically significant only in carcinoma and sarcoma groups. The decrease of neopterin levels in animals with malignant mammary tumours may suggest their decreased cellular immunity.

They are believed to originate from the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) or from the precursors of ICCs. Most GISTs show an activating mutation in either the c-kit or platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) gene. Tumor size, mitotic rate, and anatomic location correlate with potential malignancy and recurrence rate.;A total of 12 patients were diagnosed to have GIST based on histology or immunohistochemistry of a biopsy or resection specimen obtained from the GI tract in the 2004-2009 period. The material was obtained using retrospective data collection.;The male to female ratio was 1:1; mean age 68.2 +/- 7.0 years. The stomach was involved in seven cases (58.3%), the small intestine in four (33.3%), and from a lymph node without the finding of a primary tumor was material obtained in one case (8.3%). The course was asymptomatic in four patients (incidental findings). All 12 patients had surgery; a curative procedure was undertaken in 11 patients. A spindle-cell pattern was present in 8/12 of the specimens examined, epithelioid in 2/12 and a mixed pattern in two cases. Ten specimens were CD117 positive (83.3%), two were negative; all 10 examined specimens exhibited CD34 positivity while two were not examined. The findings were classified as GISTs with a high risk of progressive disease in three patients, with a moderate risk in one patient, and a low or very low degree of malignancy in five patients. GISTs smaller than 2 cm in three patients were regarded as essentially benign. All patients with low and very low risk of progressive disease survive for 1 to 5 years free of signs. Of the three patients with high degree of malignancy, one died within one year for dissemination, the two remaining patients survive for over two years and six month postoperatively on therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.;Tumors classified as GISTs with low and very low risk of progression are associated with a very good prognosis, with virtually all patients surviving 5 years. In patients with high risk or progressive diseases, the prognosis of 5-year survival is much poorer. The main therapeutic option is surgical removal of the tumor (resection or broad excision). Agents showing promise for patients with malignant forms of GISTs are tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors. Although imatinib is currently used as a first line treatment for all patients with metastatic or unresectable GISTs, it is likely that this treatment will change in the future based on the underlying mutational status.",

All patients underwent surgical resection. There were 18 cases with subtotal gastrectomy, 8 cases with partial gastrectomy, 1 case with total gastrectomy, and 1 case with subtotal gastrectomy combined with right hemihepatectomy. Based on pathological findings, the tumors were benign in 16 cases (57%), borderline in 2 cases (7%), and malignant in 10 cases (36%). The tumor diameter was significantly correlated with the malignancy of gastric GISTs (3.5+/-1.6 cm in benign tumors, vs 7.5+/-1.3 cm in malignant tumors, p<0.05). Immunohistochemical staining for CD117 and CD34 was positive in 26 (93%) and 17 (61%), respectively. The mean follow-up period ranged from 6 to 60 mo in 23 of the patients, and the other 5 patients (all with benign tumors) were lost to follow-up. No recurrence or metastasis was found in patients with benign gastric GISTs. Four cases of malignant GISTs (17%, 4/23) had liver metastasis or intra-abdominal dissemination, and 2 of them received a second resection for liver metastasis. Four cases of malignant gastric GISTs died with tumors more than 10 cm in maximum diameter, 3 of them died of liver metastasis and multiple organ failure, and 1 died of myocardial infarction. Excluding 2 patients with benign tumors that were followed for <3 yr, the 3-yr survival rate was 81% (17/21) in this group, and 60% (6/10) in the patients with malignant gastric GISTs. In conclusion, the prognosis is related to the tumor size and the number of mitoses seen on histological examination. Positive detection of CD117, combined with other markers and pathological features, is of great importance in the differential diagnosis of gastric GISTs. Complete resection with negative margins remains the fundamental objective in the surgical management of gastric GISTs.",

Although normal HSCs sustain life-long hematopoiesis, malignant transformation of HSCs leads to leukemia. Therefore, mechanisms protecting HSCs from cellular damage are essential to prevent hematopoietic malignancies. In this study, we crippled autophagy in HSCs by conditionally deleting the essential autophagy gene Atg7 in the hematopoietic system. This resulted in the loss of normal HSC functions, a severe myeloproliferation, and death of the mice within weeks. The hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell compartment displayed an accumulation of mitochondria and reactive oxygen species, as well as increased proliferation and DNA damage. HSCs within the Lin(-)Sca-1(+)c-Kit(+) (LSK) compartment were significantly reduced. Although the overall LSK compartment was expanded, Atg7-deficient LSK cells failed to reconstitute the hematopoietic system of lethally irradiated mice. Consistent with loss of HSC functions, the production of both lymphoid and myeloid progenitors was impaired in the absence of Atg7.

Approximately 30% of newly diagnosed GIST tumors are malignant or have a high potential for malignancy.

However, clinical diagnosis, particularly of small or intramural GISTs, might be difficult. Endoscopic examinations and fused PET/CT imaging are the most useful techniques for imaging and monitoring the disease progression. Surgical treatment is the first-line treatment and the only method that might lead to full remission in patients with primary GISTs. At the present time, there is no consensus on the issues whether to perform resections in patients with positive margins and resections of metastases. Biological therapy with imatinib mesylate is recommended in patients with newly diagnosed, locally advanced, inoperable, or metastasizing gastrointestinal GISTs that express the c-KIT protein.

We report a 76-year-old man with a left renal mass that had previously been shown radiographically to be stable, but was now growing. Grossly, the mass measured 12 cm, was poorly circumscribed, and invaded beyond the renal capsule. Approximately 10% of the neoplasm consisted of haphazardly arranged spindle cells admixed with dense collagenous bands, which is typical of benign SFT. However, the remainder of the mass was composed of pleomorphic, spindled sarcoma cells with frequent mitoses and foci of necrosis. Immunohistochemically, we observed CD34 labeling in the benign SFT component with loss of expression in the sarcomatous component, focal labeling for Bcl-2 protein in both areas, and absence of labeling for cytokeratin, renal cell carcinoma marker, S100 protein, CD117, and muscle markers in both areas. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of malignant renal SFT, likely representing transformation from a histologically documented benign SFT component.",

In this study, the sorted liver stem/progenitor cells were used for proteomic study. Proteins of the sorted liver stem/progenitor cells and unsorted fetal liver cells were investigated using two-dimensional electrophoresis. A two-dimensional proteome map of liver stem/progenitor cells was obtained for the first time. Proteins that exhibited significantly upregulation in liver stem/progenitor cells were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting and peptide sequencing. Nineteen protein spots corresponding to 12 different proteins were identified as showing significant upregulation in liver stem/progenitor cells and seem to play important roles in such cells in cell metabolism, cell cycle regulation, and stress. An interesting finding is that most of the upregulated proteins were overexpressed in various cancers (11 of 12, including 6 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)) and involved in cancer development as reported in previous studies. Some of the identified proteins were validated by real-time PCR, Western blotting, and immunostaining.

Malignant cell responses to imatinib depend on whether any of these tyrosine kinase activities play essential roles in the oncogenesis of a given tumor, as well as the precise molecular mechanism underlying oncogenesis.

To correctly classify a tumour process, it is essential not only to define its histological typology and identify its biological character but, at the same time, using immunohistochemistry and diagnostic molecular pathology, to evaluate prognostic and predictive indicators. As regards the prognostic indicators, it is mainly grading and staging as part of the TNM system, the sentinel lymph node assessment, if it is assessed, and other nodes extracted in this context. Histological specimens of invasive carcinomas and skin melanomas are assessed with respect to the depth of the invasion. Endocrine oestrogen and progesterone receptors are assessed in endocrine-dependent breast carcinomas. Predictive pathology uses biomarkers; biomarkers confirm the presence of target molecules following their reaction with the administered small molecule-like drugs, usually protein kinases or antibodies. HER2 gene amplification is estimated using the FISH method and predicts effectiveness of breast cancer therapies. In patients with a colon carcinoma, HER1 oncogene is identified immunohistochemically and the presence of a mutated K-ras is subsequently tested using the RT-PCR technique. CD 117 (c-kit) expression is determined in gastrointestinal stromal tumour and CD 20, 33 and 52 in malignant lymphomas and leukaemias. The most difficult task for a pathologist is defining the primary focus of the tumour in cases where only a fraction of a metastasis is available for examination. Nevertheless, at present, it is feasible to track the tumour differentiation down and, using an antibody battery, particularly against specific cytokeratines and vimentine and including organ-specific markers, to identify the primary source or at least to establish an assumption about the most likely organ affected by the tumour process.",

As an antiapoptotic agent, it could also protect epithelial cells from death during ductal lumen formation and during breast involution. In breast carcinomas, Snail transcription factors have been linked to tumor progression and invasiveness. Possible mechanisms include repression of the E-cadherin gene by Snail or Slug. However, it is not clear how this transcriptional activity is implicated in vivo. Other possible mechanisms involve maintenance of a plastic phenotype by Slug that could participate in local invasion of ductal carcinomas, and interference with apoptotic pathways that could contribute to global tumor growth and radioresistance.

The activation status of KIT, PDGFRA, and downstream signaling intermediates was defined, and chromosomal aberrations were determined by single nucleotide polymorphism assays. Mutations in KIT or PDGFRA were identified in 11% of pediatric GISTs. KIT and the signaling intermediates AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase were activated in pediatric GISTs. In particular, most pediatric KIT-wild-type GISTs displayed levels of KIT activation similar to levels in adult KIT-mutant GISTs. Pediatric KIT-wild-type GISTs lacked the typical cytogenetic deletions seen in adult KIT-mutant GISTs. Notably, most pediatric KIT-wild-type GISTs progress to malignancy without acquiring large-scale chromosomal aberrations, which is a phenomenon not reported previously in malignant solid tumors. KIT activation levels in pediatric KIT-wild-type GISTs are comparable with those in KIT-mutant GISTs. Therapies that inhibit KIT activation, or crucial KIT signaling intermediates, should be explored in pediatric KIT-wild-type GIST.",

Although largely characterized as indolent, poor outcomes have been reported in a considerable fraction of cases. As yet, optimum treatment strategies for this cancer have not been developed. This study investigates protein expression of common or potential molecular therapeutic targets and reports on the clinicopathological features of 9 new cases. We evaluated the expression of ERBB2, KIT, androgen receptor, PTEN, EGFR, ERG, and p53 via immunohistochemistry. We also examined EGFR amplification and TMPRSS2-ERG gene rearrangement by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The mean clinical follow-up was 44 months. We found that basal cell carcinoma behaved aggressively with almost one-half of the cases displaying high-risk pathologic features or local recurrence (44%). One patient died as a result of metastatic disease. The most consistent abnormalities included a loss of PTEN expression (56% of cases) and EGFR overexpression (67% of cases). EGFR overexpression occurred in the absence of gene amplification. The TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement was not detected in any of the tumors studied, nor was ERG protein positivity identified by immunostaining. In addition, ERBB2, KIT, p53, and androgen receptor expressions were either absent or showed only weak, limited reactivity. Our results suggest that there is a high morbidity associated with this tumor, and more intense follow-up and additional treatment may be indicated. Furthermore, targeted therapies directed against the EGFR and PTEN proteins or their constitutive pathways may be promising for future clinical management. ",

This case-control study was to investigate the relationship between LAPTM4B gene polymorphism and susceptibility of malignant melanoma. The genotypes of LAPTM4B were determined in 617 control subjects and 220 patients with malignant melanoma by utilizing polymerase chain reaction based on specific primers. The genotypic distribution of LAPTM4B and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were analyzed by χ (2) test. Odds ratio and 95% confidence interval was calculated by unconditional logistic regression. The distributions of LAPTM4B genotypes were significantly different between melanoma patients (45.9% for *1/1, 46.4% for *1/2 and 7.7 for *2/2) and controls (54.5% for *1/1, 39.9% for *1/2 and 5.7 for *2/2). LAPTM4B *1/2 and LAPTM4B *2/2 had a 1.396-fold and 1.619-fold higher risk for melanoma occurrence than *1/1, and subjects with LAPTM4B*2 have a 1.308-fold higher risk than LAPTM4B*1 carriers. No association between LAPTM4B genotypes and gender, age, subtype, Clark level of invasion, Breslow thickness, ulceration, clinical stage, and C-KIT, BRAF gene mutation status was observed.

When malignant, they can gain a number of other markers such as CD28, CD33, CD56, or CD117 and lose CD27. Moreover, since each PC is only able to produce a single type of immunoglobulins (Igs), they display isotypic restriction and clonal malignant PCs can be further characterized by their homogeneous expression of either kappa or lambda light chains. In multiple myeloma (MM), such PC clones produce the Ig identified in plasma as an abnormal peak. In the BM where they essentially accumulate, these PCs may however display various immunophenotypes. The latter were explored in a two-way approach. Firstly, the various subsets delineated by the selective or common expression of CD19 together with combined CD56/CD28 were explored in normal and MM BM.

This is mediated at transcriptional level by SMADs and by TGF-β-activated kinase 1-mediated activation of the nuclear factor-κB complex. TGF-β-stimulated OC cells aggregate as spheroids, which enable peritoneal dissemination. We show that TGF-β-induced TG2 regulates EMT, formation of spheroids and OC metastasis.

Gene expression profiles were concordant with immunohistochemical overexpression in only 1 tumor, which displayed both high mRNA levels and specific immunoreactivity for PDGFR-α, and PDGFR-β. No activating mutations were found on the tumors included in the study. This study confirms that TKRs expression is frequently observed in ESS. Considering that the responsiveness to tyrosine kinase inhibitors is known to be related to the presence of specific activating mutations or gene over-expression, which are not detectable in ESS, TKRs immunohistochemical over-expression alone should not be considered as a reliable marker for targeted therapies in ESS.

Receptors with tyrosine kinase activity play a critical role in normal melanocyte proliferation and in the uncontrolled growth of melanomas. Normal human melanocytes depend on exogenous peptide growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), or mast cell growth factor (MGF), all of which stimulate receptors with tyrosine kinase activity. In contrast, human melanoma cells from primary nodular and metastatic lesions grow autonomously partially because of inappropriate production of bFGF and continuous activation of the bFGF-receptor kinase. Animal models also provide evidence for the importance of receptor-tyrosine kinases in normal melanocyte proliferation and in malignant transformation. In the mouse, genes residing in three loci in which inactivation mutations lead to piebaldism, the dominant spotting (W), patch (Ph), and Sl encode, respectively, the receptor-kinases c-kit and platelet derived growth factor receptor, and the ligand for c-kit: MGF. In vivo transformation of mouse melanocytes to melanoma, due to constitutive expression of a transmembrane tyrosine kinase, the oncogene ret, was recently demonstrated in transgenic mice. Studies on a fish model, Xiphophorus, in which melanoma is inherited, showed that the dominant tumor inducing gene, Tu, encodes an EGF-receptor related tyrosine kinase which is expressed only in melanomas and not in normal tissues. Taken together, the results suggest that the uncontrolled growth of melanomas is due, in large part, to constitutive activation of receptors with tyrosine kinase activity.",

CD34 was found to colocalize with vimentin (Vim) and the Kit-positive networks of cells within and around neural plexi, indicating that ICC can be Vim- and CD34-positive. ICCs appear to be the only Kit+CD34+Vim+ cell in the gut. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from 43 GIMTs were immunostained for Kit, CD34, Vim, PGP 9.5 (PGP, a neural marker), muscle-specific actin (MSA), and other markers including desmin (Des). Eight tumors were myoid (MSA+Des+Vim-Kit-CD34-), and one was a schwannoma (PGP+S100+Vim+Kit-CD34-), but 34 tumors were of uncertain histogenesis (gastrointestinal stromal tumors, GIST), exhibiting neither a complete myoid nor a schwannian immunophenotype.

The Kit+CD34+Vim+ immunophenotype of GIST suggests that they originate from, or have differentiated into, ICC-like cells; the term ICC tumor (ICCT) is suggested. Kit is a more sensitive marker than CD34 for ICCT, but both are required in tumor identification. All clinically malignant GISTs were pathologically malignant (size, mitoses) but also showed loss of either CD34 or Kit. \"Blind\" examination of electron micrographs in 10 tumors showed them to be heterogeneous. Some had features seen in normal ICC, but cells could not be positively identified as being adult ICC.

Encouraging results from phase 1 studies as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy have prompted further investigation in several thoracic malignancies, including ongoing trials in malignant mesothelioma, small cell lung cancer, and an ongoing phase 2/3 trial in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in combination with chemotherapy. The NSCLC trials include patients with squamous cell histologic features and treated brain metastases, populations for which bevacizumab is currently not indicated. These trials will determine whether cediranib will join the growing armamentarium of therapeutic options for thoracic malignancies and broaden the number of patients with NSCLC who could potentially benefit from antiangiogenic therapy.",

Between 2000 and 2004 20 patients were admitted to our department with GIS tumour. With the addition of three cases detected between 1991 and 2000, and proved to be GIST retrospectively, 23 cases are followed. Mean age was 64.52 years, male to female ratio 11:12. Ten tumours originated from the stomach, ten from small bowel, one from rectum and two from mesenterium. All patients underwent surgery, 16 operations were completed with R0 radicality, one R1 and four R2 resections were performed. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 157 months. Five out of 23 patients died (21.7%), six patients live with metastatic disease, twelve are disease free. Amongst patient-, tumour- and treatment-related factors the prognostic significance of Fletcher's risk and radicality of resection was demonstrated (p<0.05). Significantly more synchronous or metachronous gastrointestinal malignancies were found is this population of GIST patients, when compared to the prevalence of malignancies in normal Hungarian population (p<0.001).",

A negative prognostic implication of increased angiogenesis has been established for acute and chronic myeloid and lymphocytic leukemias, myeloproliferative diseases, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and hairy cell leukemia. An association between the return of increased marrow vascularity to normal levels and durability of response has been established in some of these diseases. Elevated levels ofproangiogenic factors have been associated with a poor prognosis in the acute and chronic leukemias, multiple myeloma, and NHL. These data lend support to the reduction of activity of proangiogenic factors as a therapeutic modality. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been implicated as the major proangiogenic factor that regulates multiple endothelial cell functions, including mitogenesis. A direct relationship between VEGF and leukemic blasts and malignant plasma cells has been established, but VEGF may have a function distinct from its role in angiogenesis. Current protocols with anti- VEGF agents in patients with hematologic malignancies involve the use of monoclonal antibody, blockers of the VEGF-receptor tyrosine kinase pathway, thalidomide (Thalomid) and its analogs, and cyclooxygenase inhibitors. The receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors also affect platelet-derived growthfactor, c-kit, and Flt-3 to varying degrees, considerably broadening their potential efficacy.

We have studied immunohistochemically KIT expression in 23 canine mast cell tumors (MCTs), 10 histiocytomas, 5 malignant melanomas, and in 2 cell lines derived from mast cells (HMC-1, human and C2, canine). As expected, KIT was detected both in the human mast cell leukemia cell line (HMC- ) and in the canine mastocytoma cell line C2. In normal canine skin, KIT expression was confined to mast cells. All canine MCTs expressed KIT, although the intensity of the staining reaction varied considerably among the 23 neoplasms. Grade III tumors showed the highest expression of KIT, whereas grade I tumors showed the lowest expression of KIT. Two patterns of KIT expression were detected in mast cells. In normal canine mast cells and in some neoplastic mast cells, KIT appeared mainly on the cell membrane. However, in many canine MCTs, KIT is accumulated in the cytoplasm, usually near the cell nucleus. The meaning of these two patterns is not clear. Expression of KIT could not be detected immunohistochemically in any of the other neoplasias investigated. According to our results, it can be concluded that most, if not all, canine MCT express KIT. Furthermore, there is an inverse correlation between the degree of differentiation and the expression of KIT. Moreover, according to our results, KIT can be used as a reliable immunohistochemical marker for canine mast cells and undifferentiated mast cell tumors.",

Full-depth colonic tissues were obtained from colectomies performed for nonobstructing carcinoma. Specimens of colon wall were prepared away from the tumor site. C-kit and nuclear fluorescent staining were used to identify the ICC processes and cell body. Optical clearing was used to generate transparent colon specimens, which led to panoramic visualization of the fluorescence-labeled ICC networks at the myenteric plexus (ICC-MY), longitudinal (ICC-LM) and circular (ICC-CM) muscles, and submucosal boundary (ICC-SM) up to 300 μm in depth via confocal microscopy with subcellular level resolution. We observed four distinct network patterns: 1) periganglionic ICC-MY that connect with ICC-LM and ICC-CM, 2) plexuses of ICC-LM within the longitudinal muscle and extending toward the serosa, 3) repetitive and organized ICC-CM layers running parallel to the circular muscle axis and extending toward the submucosa, and 4) a condensed ICC-SM layer lining the submucosal border. Among the four patterns, the orderly aligned ICC-CM layers provide an appropriate target for quantitation.

In this study, frequency of GCC TAT insertion mutation (1530ins6) in KIT exon 9 (extracellular domain) and its possible clinicopathologic significance was investigated. Screening of 520 GISTs identified 26 cases with 1530ins6 KIT mutation and confirmed the previously reported low frequency of this type of KIT mutation among GISTs of different locations. Of the 26 tumors with 1530ins6 KIT mutation studied, 21 originated from the small intestine, 1 from the colon, and 3 from the rectum. In 1 case, primary small intestinal versus colonic localization could not be clearly established because of intra-abdominal dissemination. No distinctive morphological features were identified for the cohort of tumors defined by 1530ins6 KIT mutations. Most of the tumors showed predominant spindle cell morphology, and a few cases had epithelioid or pleomorphic histological features. Following previously published criteria based on tumor size and mitotic rate, 22 of 26 (85%) tumors were classified as malignant or potentially malignant, and 4 (15%) were classified as probably benign. A malignant clinical course was documented in 18 of 19 tumors from the malignant category. The survival times of 11 patients who died of disseminated GISTs ranged from 1 month to 105 months (median survival time, 26 months). In contrast, 2 of 4 GISTs assigned as probably benign tumors with follow-up information had long disease-free survival.

These are accomplishments that took decades to achieve for other more common diseases such as breast cancer or lung cancer. GIST has been the ideal disease system for studying targeted therapy in solid tumors. The progress in treating GIST has come directly from the advances that have been made in the laboratory, understanding the basic biology of tyrosine kinases, the oncogenic activity of c-KIT, and how that enzymatic activity can be inhibited.

In contrast, human melanoma cells from primary nodular and metastatic lesions grow autonomously partially because of inappropriate production of basic FGF (bFGF) and continuous activation of the bFGF-receptor kinase. Activation of transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases in melanocytes stimulates not only proliferation but also the expression of pigmentation. Melanoma cells constitutively express several tyrosyl-phosphorylated proteins that in normal melanocytes are stimulated in response to growth factors. This high level of phosphorylation was not due to either the presence of constitutively active Kit kinase and Met kinase nor to the absence of any of several known protein tyrosine phosphatases. Because bFGF by itself does not transform melanocytes to melanomas, there must be additional cooperating factors that confer the malignant phenotype to pigment cells.",

Physiological conditions such as ageing, as well as pathological conditions that have different disease processes, negatively affect ICC networks and function. Absent or disordered ICC networks can be associated with disorders in GIT motility. This review highlights the mechanism of ICC recovery from various types of injury which entails understanding the development of ICC and the factors affecting it. ICC transformation into malignant tumours (gastrointestinal stromal tumours) and their potential as contributors to therapeutic resistance is also discussed.",

Overall mortality rate remains high because of the frequent development of metastatic disease, especially hepatic metastasis. While traditional systemic chemotherapies provide only marginal benefit to patients, local treatments for hepatic metastases, such as immunoembolization, have improved patient prognoses. Progress has also been made in identifying potential targets in the pathways involved in apoptosis, proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis of uveal melanoma. Among these pathways, the c-Kit, c-Met, and IGF-1R signal pathways and the PTEN-related PI3K-Akt pathway are the most important targets. Clinical trials using blockades of these pathways in conjunction with strategies to facilitate apoptosis is a direction for future clinical trials. Application of these approaches in the adjuvant setting after primary therapy for high-risk uveal melanoma patients is also a future consideration to improve the clinical outcome of this disease.",

The molecular genetic analysis showed no mutations of KIT (exons 9, 11, 13, and 17) and PDGFRA (exons 12 and 18) genes in all 20 cases. KIT protein expression was recognized in all cases (100%).

PDGFRA protein expression was noted in 35 cases (65%); the membranous expression was strong in 2 cases, moderate in 16 cases, and weak in 17 cases. The overall median survival was 13 months. There was no significant difference in the survival between KIT strongly positive cases (median, 12 months) and KIT moderately or weakly positive cases (median, 11 months).

Functional status was defined by clinician-rated Karnofsky performance status.;Patients were on average 52 years old, a median of 4 months (range 1-82) post-diagnosis, with high grade (39%), low grade (22%), or benign tumors (39%). Patients reported frequency rates of 7-40% across various behavioral domains including anger, inappropriate behavior, apathy, inertia, and executive impairment. The presence of epileptic seizures was associated with significantly higher levels of behavioral changes. Notably, behavior did not correlate with tumor grade or treatment modality. There was moderate agreement between patients and relatives on the presence or absence of behavioral changes, and substantial agreement between relative and clinician ratings. Depressed patients did not generally report more changes than non-depressed patients. Increases in the relative and clinician-rated behavior scores were significantly correlated with decreasing functional status in the patient.;Behavioral changes were a common sequela of both benign and malignant PBT.

The results suggest the importance of including behavior in brain cancer psychosocial assessments and the need to develop interventions to treat these patients and reduce the burden of care on families.",

Proteomic investigations using tissue microarrays have yielded complementary results and are useful in identifying potential molecular targets for specific therapies. Searching for new drug targets is particularly important for tumors of poor prognosis, such as breast tumors that lack estrogen receptors and HER2 amplification; in these tumors, certain molecules probably play a significant role in tumor spreading through the stromal microvasculature. We investigated 930 breast carcinomas categorized according to patients' survival (range of follow-up = 4-10 years; median follow-up = 6.5 years) using (1) automated immunohistochemical procedures (Ventana, Cedex, France) with tissue microarrays (Alphelys, Plaisir, France) and (2) quantification of immunoprecipitates assessed by automated image analysis densitometry (SAMBA, Meylan, France). Expression of c-Met and CD146 and that of signaling transducers PI3K, FAK, and FYN were compared in living and deceased patients. Expression of some proteins recently reported to be characteristic of basal cell carcinomas was also assessed, namely, CK5-6, caveolin-1, carbonic anhydrase IX, p63, and CD117; these also constitute potential targets for therapies for aggressive tumors. Overexpression of these proteins was observed in deceased or metastatic patients (P < .01 to P < .00001), particularly node-negative patients (except for FYN, p63, and CD146). c-Met and CD146 are involved in tumor spreading, and our results suggest that they probably play an important role in patients' death, along with other proteins involved in hypoxia (carbonic anhydrase IX) and other cell functions or structures (caveolin-1, CD117, CK5-6, and p63) that are expressed in an aggressive subtype of basal cell carcinoma for which no specific therapy is available.",

Microphthalmia transcription factor (Mitf) is a melanocytic nuclear protein critical for the embryonic development and postnatal viability of melanocytes. It serves as a master regulator in modulating extracellular signals, such as those triggered by alpha-MSH and c-Kit ligand. Because of its central role in melanocyte survival and to assess its potential use as a histopathological marker for melanoma, Mitf expression was examined in histologically confirmed human melanoma specimens. Western blot analysis of melanoma cell lines revealed consistent expression of two Mitf protein isoforms differing by MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation. In a series of 76 consecutive human melanoma surgical specimens, 100% stained positively for Mitf with a nuclear pattern of reactivity. In a side-by-side comparison, Mitf staining was positive in melanomas that failed to stain for either HMB-45 or S-100, the most common currently used melanoma markers. Of 60 non-melanoma tumors, none displayed nuclear Mitf staining and two displayed cytoplasmic staining. Although Mitf does not distinguish benign from malignant melanocytic lesions, for invasive neoplasms it appears to be a highly sensitive and specific histopathological melanocyte marker for melanoma.",

Traditionally, phyllodes tumors are graded by the use of a set of histologic data into benign, borderline, and malignant. In most series, all phyllodes tumors may recur, but only the borderline and malignant phyllodes tumors metastasize. On the basis of histologic features, prediction of behavior is difficult. The expression of many biological markers, including p53, hormone receptors, proliferation markers, angiogenesis group of markers, c-kit, CD10 and epidermal growth factor receptor have been explored, and many have been shown to be variably expressed, depending on the grade of the tumor. These markers are, however, of limited value in predicting the behavior of the tumor. Recently investigators have reported a plethora of genetic changes in phyllodes tumors, the most consistent of which seems to be 1q gain by comparative genomic hybridization. Some candidate genes have been mapped to various sites, and preliminary data suggest that some of these changes may be related to recurrence.

GLUT1 is a member of the mammalian facilitative glucose transporter (GLUT) family of passive carriers that functions as an energy-independent system for transporting glucose. Both of them are useful markers for the diagnosis, progression, and prognosis of various tumors, especially those that are cancerous. However, the clinical significance of MUC1 and GLUT1 in thymic epithelial tumors remains uncertain due to a lack of quality specimen and studies at sufficient scale, both owing, in part, to the rarity of the tumors. The aim of this article is to study the expression patterns of MUC1 and GLUT1 in thymic carcinoma and type B3 thymoma, and to evaluate their diagnostic value for these two types of tumors via immunohistochemistry. Forty-three patients were included in the study, including twenty-two with thymic carcinoma and twenty-one with type B3 thymoma. Tumor tissue sections were immunohistochemically stained for MUC1 and GLUT1; meanwhile, some tumors were also stained with CKpan, TDT, CD5, and CD117. MUC1 was expressed in a total of 17 cases, with a positive rate of 77.27% (17/22) in thymic carcinoma and 9.52% (2/21) in type B3 thymoma, revealing a significant difference (p<0.0001). A significant difference (p<0.0001) was also shown for GLUT1, where the positive rates for thymic carcinoma and type B3 thymoma were 100% (22/22) and 42.86% (9/21), respectively. The expression of MUC1 was significantly correlated with GLUT1 (p<0.0001). Furthermore, GLUT1 staining sensitivity and specificity for thymic carcinoma were 100% (22/22) and 70.97% (22/31), respectively, while MUC1 staining sensitivity and specificity were 77.27% (17/22) and 89.47% (17/19), respectively. In conclusion, our study shows that MUC1 and GLUT1 staining may play a useful role in differentiating thymic carcinoma from type B3 thymoma, with high sensitivity and specificity.",

In the present series, protein S100 (S100) expression was found in 13/35 (37%) patients with a varying staining intensity ranging between strong and moderate. The multivariate statistical analysis in the S100-positive group revealed a significantly poorer survival (p = .0058) and a tendency for higher recurrence (p = .052) compared to the negative GIST patients. Furthermore, the statistical analysis disclosed a correlation between the expression of CD117, CD34, desmin, and alpha-smooth muscle actin and survival or recurrence (p > .05). Positive immunoreactivity was seen for CD117 in 25 (71%) patients and for CD34 in 19 (54%) patients. In addition we confirmed the previously reported impact of initial tumor size on survival and recurrence rate (p = .034 and p = .039). The series was also analyzed according to established prognostic factors (tumor size and mitotic activity), which indicated that 77% of S100-positive cases were at high risk for malignant tumor behavior, 15% at intermediate risk, and 8% at low risk.

After the demonstration that gastrointestinal stromal tumours without c-Kit mutations harbour PDGFR-alpha-activating mutations and that PDGFR-alpha is also a therapeutic target for imatinib mesylate, the interest for this receptor has increased considerably. Because breast cancer is one of the most frequent neoplasias in women worldwide, and only one study has reported PDGFR-alpha expression in breast carcinomas, the aim of this work was to investigate the potential significance of PDGFR-alpha expression in invasive mammary carcinomas.;We used immunohistochemistry to detect PDGFR-alpha overexpression on a series of 181 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded invasive ductal breast carcinomas and in two breast cancer cell lines: MCF-7 and HS578T. We associated its expression with known prognostic factors and we also performed polymerase chain reaction-single-stranded conformational polymorphism and direct sequencing to screen for PDGFR-alpha mutations.;PDGFR-alpha expression was observed in 39.2% of the breast carcinomas and showed an association with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.0079), HER-2 expression (P = 0.0265) and Bcl2 expression (P = 0.0121). A correlation was also found with the expression of platelet-derived growth factor A (PDGF-A; P = 0.0194). The two cell lines tested did not express PDGFR-alpha. Screening for mutations revealed alterations in the PDGFR-alpha gene at the following locations: 2500A-->G, 2529T-->A and 2472C-->T in exon 18 and 1701G-->A in exon 12. We also found an intronic insertion IVS17-50insA at exon 18 in all sequenced cases. None of these genetic alterations was correlated with PDGFR-alpha expression. The cell lines did not reveal any alterations in the PDGFR-alpha gene sequence.;PDGFR-alpha is expressed in invasive breast carcinomas and is associated with biological aggressiveness. The genetic alterations described were not correlated with protein expression, but other mechanisms such as gene amplification or constitutive activation of a signalling pathway inducing this receptor could still sustain PDGFR-alpha as a potential therapeutic target.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The molecular changes associated with the transition of melanoma cells from radial growth phase (RGP) to vertical growth phase [(VGP), metastatic phenotype] are not very well defined. We previously demonstrated that expression of the cell-surface adhesion molecule MCAM/MUC18 correlates directly with the metastatic potential of human melanoma cells. In addition, the progression of human melanoma towards the metastatic phenotype is associated with loss of expression of the tyrosine-kinase receptor c-KIT. In this review, I will summarize our recent studies demonstrating that the expression of both genes is regulated by the AP-2 transcription factor. Moreover, we have observed a loss of AP-2 expression in metastatic melanoma cells. Re-expression of AP-2 in the highly metastatic A375SM cells decreased their tumorigenicity and inhibited their metastatic potential in nude mice. MCAM/MUC18 mRNA and protein expression was significantly down-regulated while c-KIT expression was up-regulated in the AP-2-transfected cells. To further investigate the role of AP-2 in the progression of human melanoma, we attempted to inactivate AP-2 in primary cutaneous melanoma by using a dominant-negative AP-2, or the AP-2B gene. Expression of AP-2B in SB-2 cells augmented their tumorigenicity in nude mice, and upregulated MMP-2 expression and activity. As AP-2 also regulates other genes that are involved in the progression of human melanoma such as E-cadherin, p21/WAF-1, HER2/neu, Bcl-2, FAS/APO-1, IGF-R-1, VEGF and the thrombin receptor (PAR-1), we therefore propose that loss of AP-2 is a crucial event in the development of malignant melanoma. In addition, the transition of melanoma cells from RGP to VGP is also associated with over-expression of the transcription factors CREB and ATF-1. The notion that the balance between AP-2 and CREB/ATF-1 expression determines the progression of melanoma cells towards the metastatic phenotype will be discussed.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Though recurrence is high, local excision is the preferred approach for dealing with gastric stromal tumors. Achieving negative margins is mandatory, sometimes requiring subtotal gastrectomy. Adjuvant imatinib is essential for advanced cases and prolonging survival; however, there is not enough data to recommend its use before surgery to increase resectability. The current study aims at investigating this concept in Egyptian patients.;The study included 16 patients (13 males, 3 females, mean age 60 years) presenting with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) who were candidates for emergency (n = 3) or elective (n = 13) surgery. Investigations included endoscopy (+biopsy), sonography, and computed tomography (CT). Patients were enrolled in two groups: A (n = 6: projected to planned surgery) and B (n = 7: harboring c-kit +ve tumors). Each B patient received imatinib (400 mg/day) for 6 months before surgery. Clinical and radiological evaluation was at day 100. The Chi-square test was used to check size changes, and p at <0.02535 was considered significant.;All patients had abdominal discomfort, while 62.5% had epigastric pain, and 12.5% had hematemesis. Tumor sizes ranged from 8.4 to 20 cm 2/3 were located in the upper stomach. Five patients (31.3%) harbored lesions with low risk malignancy, eight (50%) with moderate risk and three (18.8%) with high risk. Wedge gastrectomy was the most common operation performed (81.25%) while partial gastrectomy was carried out in the rest, reporting no recurrence for 6 months. Not determined in group A patients, c-kit status was strongly positive in all members of group B; in two of them treatment was suspended due to poor response.;Imatinib has an acceptable safety profile and can be considered as a neoadjuvant therapy in GISTs. Until clear guidelines have been developed, we report that a 6 month intake may noticeably increase their resectability potential and improve prognosis.",

We report two cases of renal neoplasms with similar histopathological appearances. They were characterized by oncocytic cytoplasm, numerous intra-cytoplasmic vacuoles, uniform round to oval hyperchromatic nuclei with remarkably thick nuclear membranes and prominent nucleoli. The tumor cells were closely packed and disposed in an alveolar pattern. The neoplastic cells were diffusely reactive for CD117 and progesterone receptor, and diffusely or focally reactive for cytokeratin AE1/AE3, and focally reactive for cytokeratin 7, CD10, and racemase. The cells were non-reactive for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) antigen, vimentin, S100, and neuroendocrine markers. One tumor showed lymph node metastasis. Due to the remarkable cytological atypia, lymph node metastasis, and similar immunological features of RO, these two tumors likely represent a distinct subtype of RCC related to RO.",

This study was undertaken to determine the clinicopathologic features and long-term follow-up of 56 tumors diagnosed as retroperitoneal leiomyomas (LM) or smooth muscle tumors with an uncertain malignant potential (SMTUMP) in an effort to correlate their behavior and clinicopathologic features. These tumors were compared with a series of 11 cases of retroperitoneal leiomyosarcomas (excluding gastrointestinal stromal tumors). Histologic slides and immunohistochemistry for SMA, desmin, S-100 protein, HMB45, CD34, C-KIT, estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptor proteins, and MIB-1 were analyzed. All tumors diagnosed as LM and all but one SMTUMP were well-differentiated smooth muscle tumors that lacked atypia and coagulative necrosis. There was <1 mitosis per 50 high power field (HPF) in 38 tumors; no tumor had >3 mitoses/50 HPF. Most tumors had a striking resemblance to uterine smooth muscle tumors with common hyaline change and trabecular patterns. There were 51 females and 5 males ranging in age from 25 to 79 years (mean 45 years, median 43 years). These tumors were typically large, with a mean size of 16.2 cm and weight of 1600 g. Immunohistochemically, all 35 tumors studied were positive for alpha-SMA, 30 of 35 tumors were positive for desmin, and all were negative for CD117, S100 protein, and HMB45 and all but one for CD34. Steroid receptors were commonly present: ER in 20 of 29 cases and PR in 26 of 31 cases in the tumors of female patients. MIB-1 score was <2% in all of 28 cases. Long-term follow-up (mean 140 months) did not reveal metastases, but two patients had local recurrence; however, neither patient with recurrence demonstrated disease progression in follow-up. By contrast, all 11 leiomyosarcomas had at least mild atypia, and all were ER and PR negative. All cases had MIB-1-positive nuclei, but only four had >10% nuclei positive. Four patients died of disease, four were alive with recurrence, and three had no evidence of disease. A group of benign leiomyomas can be identified among retroperitoneal smooth muscle tumors. Most of these tumors resemble uterine leiomyomas by histology and positive hormone receptors, and they seem to have a good long-term prognosis with a small potential for local recurrence.",

EMGCTs present with different clinical and biologic characteristics in different tumor locations. Accurately diagnosing MEGCTs would be very difficult by performing on HE staining alone, and requires immunohistochemical verification. This study was to investigate the biological feature of EMGCTs and diagnostic value of immunohistochemical markers OCT3/4, CD117, PLAP, AFP, β-HCG and CD30 in EMGCTs. A retrospective study was performed on 48 patients with EMGCTs. EMGCTs were found to occur predominantly in males, especially for mediastinal MGCTs. The tumor locations included mediastinum, CNS and retroperitoneum. The mediastinum and CNS were the most common sites of EMGCTs. Seminoma/germinomas (64.6%) was the most common histological subtypes of EMGCTs. Chest pain, dyspnea, cough and fever were the most common clinical presentations in mediastinal MGCTs. Headache, visual disturbances, endocrine abnormalities, and signs of increased intracranial pressure were common clinical symptoms in CNS MGCTs. Abdominal mass with or without pain, backache and weight loss were common clinical presentations in retroperitoneal MGCTs. PLAP, CD117 and OCT3/4 were highly expressed in seminomas/gernimomas. CD30, EMA and CK AE1/3 staining were positive in embryonal carcinoma. AFP and β-HCG positive staining are characteristic in yolk sac tumors and choriocarcinoma, respectively. Patients with seminomas/germinomas had a better prognosis than those with NS/G-GCTs. Our finding suggests that the accurate diagnosis of EMGCTs is critical not only for predicting the tumor progression but also for patient management. Immunohistochemical markers have become an important tool in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of EMGCTs. ",

Gastric tumours occurred in a 79-year-old man and a 68-year-old woman. One patient died post-operatively, and the other was disease-free at 6 months. Three patients presented with GI metastasis 24, 60 and 0 months after diagnosis of MFH of the heart (n = 1) and the thigh (n = 2). Metastases were located in the small (n = 1) and large bowel (n = 2) and were characteristically pedunculated and polypoid with oedematous haemorrhagic stroma. Concurrent metastases (brain, lung, bone) were present in all three cases. Tumours expressed alpha-smooth muscle actin (four of five), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) alpha (three of three) and PDGFRbeta (two of three) but were negative for CD117, CD34 and other lineage-specific markers. Ultrastructural examination revealed myo/fibroblastic features. Both gastric MFH were wild type for KIT and PDGFRalpha. In conclusion, primary and metastatic MFH of the GI tract commonly express PDGFRalpha and show a myo/fibroblastic phenotype.

Here we describe a patient with a rare CML-like disease in whom we identified a novel in-frame BCR-PDGFRA rearrangement joining BCR exon 17 to PDGFRA exon 13, resulting in overexpression of PDGFRA. The design of a specific quantitative PCR assay to monitor the molecular response during treatment with imatinib, a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with activity against ABL, c-Kit, and PDGFRA revealed an outstanding disease control with durably undetectable BCR-PDGFRA transcripts. Multiple TKIs are currently available yet with distinct target profiles; thus, accurate molecular diagnosis and monitoring tools are essential to establish tailored treatments and assess response to therapy in this type of rare hematological malignancy.

To make a correct identification of soft tissue leiomyosarcoma, immunostaining with several smooth muscle differentiation markers (actin, calponin and desmin), and negative staining results with S100 (to rule out Schwann cell neoplasm), c-kit and CD34 (to rule out gastrointestinal stromal tumors) is needed. Prompt diagnosis and referral are desirable, since the size of the tumor at presentation is a continuous variable for the risk of local recurrence and metastatic disease. Chemosensitivity varies according to the tumor subtype, and the tumor grade, the patient's age, performance status, and the timing of metastatic disease further influence the likelihood of a response and survival. Chemotherapy is palliative for most patients with unresectable or metastatic disease.

The present study was designed to analyze the synchronous and metachronous tumors developed among GIST patients assessed by our institution for GIST Syndrome setting recognition. Patients (n=141) with primary GIST (77 men and 64 women) were recruited between 1988 and 2007 and their clinical and pathological records were reviewed.

The most common neoplasms were gastrointestinal and genitourinary. A novel exon 6 germline large deletion of NF1 was identified in the NF1/GIST kindred. The development of GIST associated with other neoplasms is common and diagnosis of peculiar benign associated-neoplasms warrants the search for familial cancer susceptibility.

Beyond the increased infective risk, myelosuppression contributes to TKI-related fatigue, thus reducing both patients' quality of life and overall survival (OS). However, the frequency and severity of myelosuppression vary among sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib and axitinib, based on their different kinase selectivity.

It is known to be the most common neoplasm appearing in the upper             aerodigestive tract. The poor 5‑year survival rate has remained unchanged in the             last decades even though improved techniques in surgery, radiation and chemotherapy             have been established. In contrast to the overall decreasing incidence of head             and neck cancer in the US, the incidence of HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer             is increasing, indicating the importance of viral etiology. Furthermore, growth             and invasion of HNSCC are strongly influenced by the extracellular matrix (ECM).             Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) have been shown to play key roles in the remodeling             of the ECM. Imatinib (STI 571) was originally designed to inhibit the BCR-ABL             tyrosine kinase in chronic myeloid leukaemia. But it also has an inhibitory impact,             e.g., on the protein-tyrosine-kinase (PTK) receptor c-kit and on its PTK activity             in HNSCC. In this study, we incubated the HNSCC cell lines HNSCC 11A and 14C and             the p16-positive SCC line CERV196 with increasing concentrations of imatinib or             carboplatin. After an incubation time of up to 10 days, we evaluated MMP-2 and             -14 expression by ELISA techniques and immunohistochemistry. MMP-2 and -14 expression             was demonstrated in all incubated tumor cell lines. Especially incubation with             imatinib resulted in a significant decrease in MMP expression in incubated cell             lines. Our results indicate that the expression of MMP-2 and -14 is suppressed             in the presence of imatinib. Thus, imatinib may exert in part its inhibitory effect             on malignant cell growth via the blockage of the signal transduction of PTK receptors.             Further studies are warranted, especially keeping in mind the moderate toxicity             of imatinib.",

Here, we have studied the effects of Imatinib on human MA-11 breast carcinoma cells, expressing both c-abl and PDGFRbeta, in vitro and in mouse xenografts.;The effects of Imatinib mesylate on the human MA-11 breast carcinoma cell line were studied in vitro and in xenografts.;Daily intraperitoneal treatment with 60 mg/kg Imatinib for 9 days of athymic nude mice pre-implanted subcutaneously with MA-11 cells did not result in an anti-tumor effect, but rather increased the take rate of 3 × 10(4) cells from 30.8 to 84.6% and caused the appearance of large abdominal masses in 30% of mice. To investigate the mechanism(s) of the observed effects of Imatinib on MA-11 tumors, we exposed the cells in vitro to Imatinib for 9 days. The surviving population, expanded in culture, showed increased motility and over-expressed a set of genes associated with aggressive behavior. Also, several genes belonging to the Wnt and the MAPK pathway were differentially expressed. In promoter activation assays, Imatinib increased the promoter activity driven by both Wnt and MAPK/ERK-1/2.;Our data suggest caution in the clinical use of Imatinib in breast cancer patients; the comparison of Imatinib-surviving breast cancer cells with parental cells may help define the regulatory pathways involved in the increased malignancy of residual tumor cells that survive therapy, ultimately providing important therapeutic targets.",

The mean age of patients was 56 years. The size of tumors ranged from 1.0 to 4.5 cm in greatest dimension. They had solid or solid-cystic cut surface. Histologically, the tumors were encapsulated and showed several morphologic patterns, with tubules, papillae, acini, interconnecting ribbons and macro/microcysts lined by single layer of cells with clear or small amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm and low-grade nuclei (corresponding to Fuhrman grade 1 or 2). Mitotic figures were rarely seen. Characteristically, there was linear arrangement of the nuclei away from the basement membrane, conferring an appearance similar to that of endometrial glands in early secretory phase. Tubules and cysts contained serosanguineous fluid or colloid-like secretion were identified. No foamy histiocytes, psammomatous calcifications or hemosiderin was present in the papillary areas. Two of the tumors showed focal or extensive angioleiomyoma/leiomyoma-like components. No coagulative necrosis, sarcomatoid dedifferentiation, nor microscopic vascular invasion was observed. Immunohistochemically, all tumors showed strong co-expression of CK7 and CA9 (with characteristic \"goblet\" staining pattern). The staining for EMA, CK (AE1/AE3), vimentin, CK8, CK18, CK19 and PAX-8 were also positive in all cases. Ki-67 was expressed in less than or about 5% of the tumor cell nuclei.

The data collected included tumor sites, including the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, small intestine, and extragastrointestinal sites; tumor size; microscopic indicators for malignant tumor behavior, such as the number of dividing cells, cell necrosis, atypical morphology, and invasion into the muscular or mucous layer; and previously established immunohistochemical indicators, CD117, CD34, and discovered on GIST-1 (DOG-1). No single occurrence of any microscopic indicators correlated with the prognosis of GIST; however, the total number of microscopic indicators was a significant prognostic factor of GIST (P < 0.001). Regarding the tumor sites, the order of prognostic risk (from the lowest to the highest) was as follows: the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, small intestine, extragastrointestinal sites, and colorectum. The association between tumor sites and prognosis was significant (P < 0.001). On the other hand, the expression of CD117 or CD34 was not associated with the risk of GIST. Importantly, 91% of the patients (302/332) showed the expression of DOG-1, and the lack of DOG-1 expression was associated with poor prognosis (P < 0.05). In conclusion, both tumor sites and total number of microscopic indicators are independent risk factors associated with the prognosis of GIST.

Without the clinical manifestation of metastases, it is often difficult to characterize them as malignant. Even so-called completely (R0) resected tumors can spread clinically visible metastases within a few months after initial surgery. Treatment options for neuroendocrine tumors including pheochromocytoma are limited. Molecular targeted therapies using tyrosine kinase inhibitors might prove to be helpful in patients with these tumors. In an immunohistochemical study, we examined KIT in 26 pheochromocytomas, 8 of which were malignant (3 adrenal pheochromocytomas, 5 paragangliomas). KIT expression was found in one of these 8 malignant tumors. This 2.5-cm-large adrenal pheochromocytoma originated from a woman with neurofibromatosis type 1 and spread into spine, skull, and lung. KIT expression could be demonstrated in 5% of tumor cells. On the basis of KIT expression immunohistochemically, we treated patients with neuroendocrine (i.e., medullary thyroid cancer) and other tumors with imatinib 400 mg per day, but without efficacy after 2 months of therapy. Similar results were shown by other investigators. Therefore, monotherapy with imatinib may not be efficacious in patients with neuroendocrine tumors that express KIT.

In addition, 2- to 4 day ex vivo manipulation of bone marrow from mice containing a disruption of the homologue of human FANCC (Fancc) results in a time-dependent increase in apoptosis and a risk for malignant transformation of hematopoietic cells.

Functionally, the repopulating activity of Fancc(-/-) stem cells from reconstituted mice expressing the recombinant FANCC transgene was comparable with wild-type controls.

Recent studies show that Microphthalmia Transcription Factor (MITF) has high sensitivity (88-100%) and specificity for metastatic melanoma. We are reporting here three cases of high grade tumors that were studied by a comprehensive immunohistochemical panel including cytokeratins, S100, HMB-45, Melan A, Tyrosinase, and MITF. All three tumors were also analyzed for the presence of BRAF mutations. All three metastatic tumors were negative for S100, Melan A, HMB-45 and Tyrosinase but positive for MITF. Subsequent to the diagnoses, previously existing or concurrent primary melanomas were identified in 2 of the 3 cases. Interestingly, S100, Melan A, and HMB-45 were positive in the primary tumors. No BRAF (V600E) mutations were identified in the three metastatic melanomas and CD 117 (c-kit) was positive in one of the cases.

Although deletions and substitutions are most frequent KIT exon 11 mutations, duplications and insertions have been reported as well. In contrast to duplications, which cluster in 3'KIT exon 11, insertions affect 5'KIT, particularly codon 558. Clinicopathologic profile of gastrointestinal stromal tumors with insertions in codon 558 is not known. In this study, 17 gastrointestinal stromal tumors with codon 558 insertions are reported. Fifteen (88.2%) KIT codon 558 insertions consisted of 1694_1695insTCC leading to Lys558delinsAsnPro. However, 2 variant mutants Lys558delinsAsnGln and Lys558delinsAsnAsn were also identified. Based on analysis of inserted and flanking sequences, the insertions contain inverted DNA sequences of the opposite strand. Therefore, these insertions may develop due to a DNA strand switch during replication by DNA polymerases and by the effects of several different DNA repair processes. Patient median age was 61 years, and male-to-female ratio was 1:1.8. gastrointestinal stromal tumors were diagnosed in stomach (n = 4), small intestine (n = 7), and rectum (n = 3). Three tumors were disseminated and primary location could not be established. Fourteen tumors had spindle cell morphology, and epithelioid cell features were seen in 2 intestinal and 1 disseminated gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Based on size and mitotic activity, 2 (50%) of 4 gastric and 3 (48.9%) of 7 small intestinal gastrointestinal stromal tumors had more than 50% risk of metastases according to previous studies of gastrointestinal stromal tumor prognosis. All 3 rectal gastrointestinal stromal tumors were malignant. Metastases were verified in 8 (66.7%) of 12 patients with known clinical and follow-up data. In summary, KIT codon 558 insertions are rare mutations accounting for less than 1% of all KIT mutants. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors with these mutations appear to have predilection to female patients and intestinal location. Moreover, KIT codon 558 insertions might indicate an increased risk of malignant behavior for gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumors.",

New therapeutic targets are currently under investigation, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as well as KIT. A number of studies have shown protumorigenic potential of Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in a variety of human malignancies, but so far it is unknown whether COX-2 is expressed in primary malignancies of the thymus. Using tissue microarrays, the expression of COX-2, microsomal-PGES-1 and -PGES-2 (mPGES-1 and mPGES-2), as well as EGFR was evaluated in different subtypes of thymoma and thymic carcinomas. COX-2 was expressed in all subtypes as determined by immunohistochemistry. Some cases of type B2 and thymic carcinomas had COX-2 staining levels classified as mild to moderate. However, when measuring the optical color intensity, no significant differences could be detected. Concerning the expression levels, a weak correlation between the expression of COX-2, mPGES-1 and mPGES-2 as well as EGFR was found. Furthermore, additional cases of thymomas and thymic carcinomas were analyzed by COX-2 Western immunoblot analysis and were compared to normal thymi. The analysis showed that thymomas and thymic carcinomas had a significantly stronger COX-2 expression than that of the normal thymi (p < 0.04). In summary, COX-2 is expressed in all subtypes of thymomas and thymic carcinomas and thus represents, in addition to EGFR and KIT, a potential therapeutic target. Further studies are needed in order to determine whether a combined therapy using COX-2 inhibitors in addition to the evolving anti-EGFR antibody therapy may be considered as a treatment option.",

Age-adjusted incidence rates and survival rates were calculated, and they were also analysed by sex and NIH risk categories.;Forty-six cases were categorised as GIST. Fifty percent were localised in the stomach, 43.5% in small intestine, 4.3% in the omentum, and 2.2% in colon. Thirty-seven percent were classified as high risk of an aggressive behaviour, 30.4% as intermediate risk and 32.6% as low or very low risk. Only one patient received treatment with imatinib mesilate. The annual incidence by 100,000 inhabitants in crude rate, European age-standardised rate and world age-standardised rate was, respectively, 1.09, 0.90 and 0.65 cases. The relative 5-year survival rate was 74.7% for the entire cohort, and it was markedly lower in the high-risk cases (20.3%).;We report the first population-based study of GIST incidence and survival in Southern Europe. The incidence rate is low and comparable with that of cancer registries from Northern Europe. Survival was favourable in our pre-imatinib population although it was low in high risk cases. Prognostic discrimination of the cases with intermediate, low, or very low risk is inadequate, and these categories should be considered jointly in the future. Our results will help researchers in establishing baseline values against which they can compare, in the future, the impact of imatinib and other Kit tyrosine inhibitors on survival.",

A better understanding of the pathogenesis and tumor biology of sporadic renal cell carcinoma has led to the approval of 6 drug regimens: 3 oral multi-targeted tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (sorafenib, sunitinib, and pazopanib), 2 inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (temsirolimus and everolimus), and 1 monoclonal antibody against the vascular endothelial growth factor (bevacizumab). Pazopanib, a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets VEGFR-1, -2, and-3; PDGFR-α and PDGFR-β, and c-Kit, was approved for the treatment of mRCC in October 2009, several years after the other drugs in its class. The efficacy and safety of pazopanib in Phase I, II, and III trials will be examined and its role in mRCC treatment will be described. Future studies that may clarify pazopanib's role in mRCC will be discussed. Based on pazopanib's demonstrated efficacy in treatment-naïve and cytokine-refractory patients, along with a seemingly favorable toxicity profile compared with other multi-targeted tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, pazopanib may have a unique niche in the armamentarium of treatment options for mRCC. Results from ongoing studies are awaited to confirm pazopanib's favorable efficacy-toxicity ratio, especially in comparison with the previous first-line standard-of-care, sunitinib.",

Myeloid/NK cell acute leukemia is a very rare subtype of leukemia. Although its NK-cell nature is debatable, it represents a variant of leukemia with distinct morphological and immunophenotypical features. The first case is a de novo myeloid/NK-cell acute leukemia with a striking clinical, morphologic and immunophenotypic resemblance to acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), but which could be distinguished by its CD11a, CD18, CD117 and CD9 expression. This case illustrates the importance of utilizing the APL surrogate surface phenotype of HLA-DR(low), CD11a(low) and CD18(low) by flow cytometric study to rule in/out APL immunophenotypically. In the second case, we show that myeloid/NK-cell blasts can present as a variant of blasts in a preleukemic disease as refractory anemia with excess blasts-1 (RAEB-1), where the blasts were negative for CD34, CD117 and HLA-DR.

This family of tumors includes angiomyolipoma (AML), clear cell sugar tumor of the lung (CCST), lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), and very rare tumors in other locations. Because non-AML/non-LAM PEComas are extremely rare and their natural history and prognostic features undefined, we present our experience with 26 PEComas of soft tissue and the gynecologic tract, the largest series to date. We also performed a detailed review of the literature, with special attention to features predictive of clinical behavior. All PEComas exclusive of AML and LAM were retrieved from our consultation files. Immunohistochemistry for pan-cytokeratin (CK), S-100 protein, smooth muscle actins (SMA), desmin, vimentin, HMB45, Melan-A, microphthalmia transcription factor (MiTF), TFE3, CD117, and CD34 was performed. Clinical follow-up information was obtained. Fisher's exact test was performed. The median patient age was 46 years (range, 15-97 years); there was a marked female predominance (22 females, 4 males). Sites of involvement included the omentum or mesentery (6 cases), uterus (4 cases), pelvic soft tissues (3 cases), abdominal wall (2 cases), uterine cervix (2 cases), and vagina, retroperitoneum, thigh, falciform ligament, scalp, broad ligament, forearm, shoulder, and neck (1 case each). The tumors ranged from 1.6 to 29 cm in size (median, 7.8 cm). Tumors were epithelioid (N = 9), spindled (N = 7), or mixed (N = 10). Multinucleated giant cells were present in 18 cases. High nuclear grade was noted in 10 cases, high cellularity in 7 cases, necrosis in 8 cases, and vascular invasion in 3 cases. Mitotic activity was 0 to 50 mitotic figures (MF)/50 high power fields (HPF) (median, 0 MF/50 HPF) with atypical MF in 6 cases. IHC results were: SMA (20/25), desmin (8/22), HMB45 (22/24), Melan-A (13/18), MITF (9/18), S-100 protein (8/24), CK (3/23), vimentin (12/14), TFE3 (5/17), c-kit (1/20), and CD34 (0/7). Clinical follow-up (24 of 26 patients, 92%; median, 30 months; range, 10-84 months) showed 3 local recurrences and 5 distant metastases. At last available clinical follow-up, 2 patients (8%) were dead of disease, 4 patients (17%) were alive with metastatic or unresectable local disease, and 18 patients (75%) were alive with no evidence of disease. No patient in our series had a history of tuberous sclerosis complex. Recurrence and/or metastasis was strongly associated tumor size > median size (8 cm), mitotic activity greater than 1/50 HPF, and necrosis. We conclude that PEComas of soft tissue and gynecologic origin may be classified as \"benign,\" \"of uncertain malignant potential,\" or \"malignant.\" Small PEComas without any worrisome histologic features are most likely benign. PEComas with nuclear pleomorphism alone (\"symplastic\") and large PEComas without other worrisome features have uncertain malignant potential. PEComas with two or more worrisome histologic features should be considered malignant. Occasional PEComas express unusual markers, such as S-100 protein, desmin, and rarely CK.

        "Doc_abstract":"Malignant melanoma is a highly aggressive tumour with increasing -incidence and poor prognosis in the metastatic stage. In recent years, a substantial number of reports on individual miRNAs or miRNA patterns have been published providing strong evidence that miRNAs might play an important role in malignant melanoma and might help to better understand the molecular mechanisms of melanoma development and progression. A major preliminary finding was that melanoma-associated miRNAs are often located in genomic regions with frequent gains and losses in tumours. Detailed studies of different groups thereafter identified miRNAs with differential expression in benign melanocytes compared with melanoma cell lines or in benign melanocytic lesions compared with melanomas. Among these were let-7a and b, miR-23a and b, miR-148, miR-155, miR-182, miR-200c, miR-211, miR214, and miR-221 and 222. Some of these miRNAs target well-known melanoma-associated genes like the NRAS oncogene, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), receptor tyrosine kinase c-KIT or AP-2 transcription factors (TFAP2). Although we are still far from a complete understanding of the role of miRNA-target gene interactions in malignant melanoma, these findings further underscore the notion of a direct involvement of miRNAs in melanoma biology. Very recently, a prognostic signature of six miRNAs has been identified consisting of miRNAs miR-150, miR-342-3p, miR-455-3p, miR-145, miR-155, and miR-497. High expression of these miRNAs was shown to be associated with improved long-term survival of metastatic patients.",

Of 48 potentially relevant studies, we combined individual patient data from 18 studies which involved 1,487 patients with GISTs, by which we made a comparison between the positive KIT mutation subgroup and the negative KIT mutation subgroup (PDGFRA mutation and wild type). We tabulated and analyzed the patient characteristics from each study, including general information such as age and gender, histopathological parameters, and clinical follow-up outcomes.;KIT mutations, compared with PDGFRA mutations and wild type, showed a marked increased risk not only for tumor size (>5 cm) but also for higher mitotic activity (>5), suggesting that KIT mutations significantly correlated with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) high risk or National Institutes of Health (NIH) high risk (1.74 (95% CI, 1.20 to 2.53) and 2.00 (95% CI, 1.08 to 3.68), respectively).

RCAS1 (receptor-binding cancer antigen expressed on SiSo cells) is a cancer cell-surface antigen and has been identified as a prognostic factor in several cancer types. It is thought that tumor cells escape immune attack by expressing RCAS1, which induces apoptosis in receptor-positive immune cells. The current study was designed to elucidate the histogenesis of these tumors by using various immunohistochemical markers, and identify parameters that will help to establish the criteria of malignancy in the GIMT. We also discuss the clinicopathological significance of RCAS1 expression in the diagnosis and prognosis of GIMTs. A total of 70 cases of GIMTs were reviewed. Immunohistochemistry was performed between 1990 and 2000, with the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method on 3 microm-thick sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens of GIMTs. Antibodies to the following antigens were used: KIT (CD117), CD34 alpha-SMA, Desmin, cytokeratin, S-100 protein, p53, and RCAS1. Recurrence-free survival analysis was done with Stat View-J 5.0 statistical packages. Univariate analysis for a recurrence-free prognosis demonstrated that antibody detection of p53 expression (p=0.0333) and expression of RCAS1 (p=0.0008) is correlated with a significantly higher potential of recurrence. On multivariate analysis, tumor size and RCAS1 expression were independently and inversely correlated with recurrence-free survival. The expression of RCAS1 has not previously been reported in GIMT; indeed, our study suggests that the expression of RCAS1 is correlated with recurrence not only in carcinomas, but also in mesenchymal tumors.",

Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (CHC), a malignant primary liver tumor with poor prognosis, is thought to be of HPC origin. However, the prognostic significance of this etiology is not well defined. Therefore, we retrospectively investigated the relationship of HPC-related pathological features and long-term outcome in patients with CHC in our department. In a cohort of 80 patients identified between 1997 and 2003, including 70 patients who underwent resection with curative intent, overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were correlated with the proliferative activity of nontumor ductular reaction (DR) and the expression levels of HPC and biliary markers including α-fetoprotein (AFP), keratin 7 (K7), keratin 19 (K19), oval cell (OV)-6, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), and c-Kit in both tumor and nontumor liver. We found that nontumor ductular reactions (DRs), specifically the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) labeling index of the ductular reaction (PI-DR), a surrogate for transit-amplifying compartments, was an independent prognostic factor for both OS and DFS. By contrast, intratumoral expression of only one marker, absence of AFP, was associated with OS. PI-DR was also independently associated with synchronous \"multicentric occurrence\" in hepatocellular carcinoma components, a feature of CHC that may predispose to metachronous multifocal tumorigenesis.;Proliferative ductular reaction related to HPC activation is associated with recurrence of CHC. Background HPC activation is strongly associated with multifocal occurrence and related tumor recurrence, highlighting the critical role of background liver disease, a \"field effect,\" in the recurrence of CHC.",

We investigated the immunohistochemical expression of these markers in different testicular germ cell tumors, and their utility in the differential diagnosis of morphologically difficult-to-classify components of these tumors. A total of 50 mixed testicular germ cell tumors, 43 also containing difficult-to-classify areas, were studied. In these areas, multiple morphological parameters were noted, and high-grade nuclear details similar to typical embryonal carcinoma were considered 'embryonal carcinoma-like high-grade'. Immunohistochemical staining for OCT3/4, c-kit, CD30, SOX2, and GDF3 was performed and graded in each component as 0, negative; 1+, 1-25%; 2+, 26-50%; and 3+, >50% positive staining cells. The different components identified in these tumors were seminoma (8), embryonal carcinoma (50), yolk sac tumor (40), teratoma (40), choriocarcinoma (3) and intra-tubular germ cell neoplasia, unclassified (35). By immunohistochemistry, the staining patterns were OCT3/4 -3+, all seminomas, embryonal carcinomas and intra-tubular germ cell neoplasia; SOX2 -3+, all embryonal carcinomas and -2 to 3+, 11/14 (79%) primitive neuroectodermal components in immature teratomas; GDF3 -2 to 3+, all yolk sac tumors, seminomas and intra-tubular germ cell neoplasia and 1 to 2+, 40/50 embryonal carcinomas. A total of 34/43 (79%) of difficult-to-classify areas stained 3+ for OCT3/4, CD30, and SOX2, similar to embryonal carcinoma. Among these areas, only 'embryonal carcinoma-like high-grade' nuclear details were significantly associated with such an immunophenotype. Thus, SOX2 is expressed in embryonal carcinoma and primitive neuroectoderm of teratoma, and unlike OCT3/4, not in intra-tubular germ cell neoplasia and seminoma. Therefore, it may be useful in the distinction of seminoma from embryonal carcinoma, and potentially in diagnosing early carcinomatous differentiation in seminoma. GDF3 positivity, in the absence of OCT3/4 and CD30, combined with morphological features, is helpful in the diagnosis of yolk sac tumor.

Although careful morphologic examination using sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin will allow for the correct diagnosis in the majority of cases, there is sufficient overlap between several entities such that ancillary techniques may be necessary to arrive at the correct diagnosis. In routine diagnostic surgical pathology practice of renal tumors, immunohistochemistry is the foremost ancillary technique. Using an approach based on common histologic patterns (tumors with clear cytoplasm, granular cytoplasm, tubulopapillary architecture, spindle cell morphology, small round-cell morphology, and infiltrating poorly differentiated carcinoma), we will discuss the utility of immunohistochemistry in the differential diagnosis of renal neoplasms. In recent years, needle biopsies from renal masses are being increasingly performed. In these small biopsies, the entire range of cytoarchitectural features that are generally necessary to make a diagnosis may not be fully appreciated. Immunohistochemistry may be helpful in this setting to narrow the differential diagnosis or to arrive at a definitive diagnosis. Finally, the use of immunohistochemistry for the confirmation of metastatic renal cell carcinoma presenting at distant sites will be discussed. Panels of immunohistochemical stains are proposed for different settings, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC) marker, CD10, and vimentin to suggest renal origin of a metastatic tumor, and markers to aid in subclassification of RCC, including parvalbumin and c-kit for chromophobe RCC, and cytokeratin 7 and alpha-methyl-acyl-CoA racemase for papillary RCC.",

We developed a microplate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of circulating E-selectin by coating the microwell with monoclonal anti-E-selectin. We incubated the specimen and the biotinylated detecting antibody simultaneously, and used HPR-conjugated streptavidin to generate a signal for quantification. The assay has a sensitivity of 3.8 ng/mL, and the coefficients of variation (CVs) for both within-day and day-to-day precision were all <10%. Our in-house-made kit also compared well with a commercial kit from R&D Systems (r=0.95, slope=0.94). Using our kit we determined a normal reference value for Chinese individuals of different ages (30-80 years). We found no significant difference between females and males; however, age appeared to have an impact on the normal E-selectin value. We found that normal individuals over 60 years old had higher levels of circulating E-selectin (65.8+/-19.5 ng/mL, N=111) compared to those under 60 years old (59.5+/-18.1 ng/mL; P=0.002).

Most intratumorale in the specimen underwent hyaline degeneration after pathological examination, but there were viable cells in a portion of the tumor border. Imatinib treatment was resumed because of recurrence in the remnant stomach four months postoperatively owing to imatinib withdrawal.

        "Doc_abstract":"Gonadal germ cell tumors continue to be the cause of diverse, diagnostically challenging issues for the pathologist, and their correct resolution often has major important therapeutic and prognostic implications. They are academically interesting because of the biological diversity exhibited in the two gonads and variation in frequency of certain neoplasms. The most dramatic examples of the latter are the frequency of dermoid cyst in the ovary compared to the testis and the reverse pertaining to embryonal carcinoma. Within the teratoma group, there is strong evidence that ovarian and prepubertal testicular teratomas are derived from benign germ cells, a pathogenesis that likely applies also to the rare dermoid cysts and uncommon epidermoid cysts of the testis. In contrast, postpubertal testicular teratomas derive from malignant germ cells, specifically representing differentiation within a preexistent nonteratomatous cancer. As expected, given the foregoing, teratomas in boys are clinically benign, whereas in postpubertal males they are malignant, independent of their degree of immaturity. On the other hand, immaturity is an important finding in ovarian teratomas, irrespective of age, although its significance in children has recently been challenged. It is usually recognized on the basis of embryonic-appearing neuroepithelium, which shows mitotic activity and apoptosis in contrast to differentiated neuroepithelial tissues, which may occur in mature ovarian teratomas. Rarely it is based on the presence of cellular, mitotically active glial tissue. Fetal-type tissues alone are not sufficient for a diagnosis of immature teratoma. Further differences between the teratomatous tumors in the two gonads are the relative frequency of monodermal teratomas in the ovary in contrast to the testis, where only one subset, carcinoids, is seen with any frequency. When uncommon somatic-type malignancies (usually squamous cell carcinoma) occur in mature cystic teratomas of the ovary, this is a de novo form of malignant transformation; similar tumors in the testis, a very rare event, represent overgrowth of teratomatous elements that originated from malignant, nonteratomatous germ cell tumors and, therefore, had previously undergone malignant transformation. Germinomas may have several unusual features in each gonad; these include microcystic arrangements that suggest yolk sac tumor, tubular patterns that mimic Sertoli cell tumor, apparent increased cytological atypia that causes concern for embryonal carcinoma, and prominent syncytiotrophoblast giant cells that suggest choriocarcinoma. Awareness of these variants, good technical preparations, the retained typical cytological features of germinoma cells, and the judicious use of tailored panels of immunohistochemical stains resolve these dilemmas in virtually all instances. Two aspects of germinomas are unique to the testis. Firstly, intertubular growth of small seminomas may cause them to be overlooked. Secondly, the distinctive spermatocytic seminoma occurs only in the testis. A newly recognized aspect of this tumor is the propensity for some to be relatively monomorphic, making them apt to be mistaken for usual seminoma or embryonal carcinoma, although the characteristic polymorphic appearance in some foci, absence of intratubular germ cell neoplasia, unclassified type, and immunohistochemical stains should prevent this error. Cytoplasmic membrane immunoreactivity for placental alkaline phosphatase and CD117, with usual negativity for AE1/AE3 cytokeratins, is helpful in the diagnosis of germinoma. The recently described marker, OCT3/4, a nuclear transcription factor, is especially helpful in the differential of germinoma and embryonal carcinoma with other neoplasms. Yolk sac tumor continues to be confused occasionally with clear cell carcinoma of the ovary. Glandular ('endometrioid-like') yolk sac tumors mimic endometrioid carcinomas; predominant or pure hepatoid yolk sac tumors cause concern for metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma or, in the ovary, primary hepatoid carcinoma, and solid patterns, especially in limited samplings, may be misinterpreted as germinoma. The usually younger age of patients with yolk sac tumors helps with the differential considerations with the nongerm cell tumors, as do other clinical and microscopic features and selected immunohistochemical stains. Choriocarcinoma is rare in both gonads, and those in the ovary must be distinguished from metastatic tumors of placental origin. Syncytiotrophoblast cells alone, admixed with other forms of germ cell tumor, still are confused with choriocarcinoma, but this phenomenon, which is much more frequent than choriocarcinoma, lacks the plexiform arrangement of different trophoblast cell types that typifies the latter. Mixed germ cell tumors (which may show almost any combination of components) are common in the testis but rare in the ovary. A separately categorized, rare form of mixed germ cell tumor seen in both gonads is the polyembryoma. It is perhaps the most photogenic of all gonadal germ cell tumors and is also intriguing because of its distinctive, organized arrangement of yolk sac tumor and embryonal carcinoma elements and recapitulation of very early embryonic development, even to the extent of having in its fundamental unit, the embryoid body, a miniature yolk sac, and amniotic cavity. These tumors, which are constituted by innumerable embryoid bodies, almost always contain teratomatous glands in minor amounts, and one way of viewing the polyembryoma is to consider it the most immature form of teratoma. Embryoid bodies are also common as a minor component of many mixed germ cell tumors, particularly in the testis, and the diffuse embryoma is another variant that has a particular arrangement of yolk sac tumor and embryonal carcinoma elements. Regression of gonadal germ cell tumors is a phenomenon restricted to the testis, for unknown reasons. These so-called 'burnt-out' germ cell tumors can be recognized by a distinctive constellation of findings, including sometimes minor foci of residual recognizable germ cell neoplasia, a well-defined zone of scarring (often having residual ghost tubules), associated lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, intratubular calcification and, in about 50%, of in situ germ cell neoplasia."},

The aim of this study is to investigate new and more practical tissue markers, such as DOG1 and Ki-67 to specify the GIST diagnosis and also to predict the outcome in GIST patients with both localized and advanced staged disease.;For the last 14 years, from 1999 to 2013, 111 patients with a histopathological GIST diagnosis from the hospital files were enrolled to the study. In their parafin-embedded tissue samples, DOG1 and Ki-67 expressions were evaluated with immunohistochemisty by two independent pathologists from Cukurova University Medical Faculty. Patients were divided into two groups, the patients with localized disease treated by surgery and the patients with advanced/metastatic disease. DOG1 and Ki-67 expressions were corelated with other diagnostic and prognostic histopathological markers and also the clinical outcome in these two group of patients.;The specificity and the sensitivity of DOG1 in GIST diagnosis was found 94 and 43%, respectively. DOG1 expression was especially important in the diagnosis of c-kit negative cases. Although Ki-67 was not found a statistically significant prognostic factor for overall survival, it was strongly corelated with mitotic index which is a well-known standart prognostic factor for localized disease.;DOG1 seems to be an important diagnostic tool for clinically suspected GIST diagnosis in both advanced or early staged patients whose tumours are c-kit expression negative.

Moreover, mouse gene disruption studies have implicated HIF-2 alpha in embryonic regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase, a hallmark gene of the sympathetic nervous system. Neuroblastoma tumors originate from immature sympathetic cells, and therefore we investigated the effect of hypoxia on the differentiation status of human neuroblastoma cells. Hypoxia stabilized HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha proteins and activated the expression of known hypoxia-induced genes, such as vascular endothelial growth factor and tyrosine hydroxylase. These changes in gene expression also occurred in hypoxic regions of experimental neuroblastoma xenografts grown in mice. In contrast, hypoxia decreased the expression of several neuronal/neuroendocrine marker genes but induced genes expressed in neural crest sympathetic progenitors, for instance c-kit and Notch-1. Thus, hypoxia apparently causes dedifferentiation both in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest a novel mechanism for selection of highly malignant tumor cells with stem-cell characteristics.",

Some genes appear to be of particular importance in these complex processes and are therefore potential targets for molecularly based therapeutics. The rationale for such treatment is that, if the function of critical genes can be efficiently and specifically perturbed, then the ensuing disruption might lead to preferential leukemic cell death. Several technologies for carrying out targeted gene disruption now exist. One approach, the \"antisense\" gene strategy, appears to be particularly well suited to the treatment of human leukemia ex vivo and perhaps in vivo as well. Herein I review the experience of my laboratory in using this approach to target the c-myb and c-kit proto-oncogenes in human leukemic cells.

Simultaneously the drug may be active against C-kit PDGFRalpha and beta, COL 1a1 and FIPI-LI gene mutations as well. Consequently, imatinib exerts a therapeutic effect upon chronic myeloid leukemia, gastrointestinal stroma tumor, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans and hypereosinophilic syndroma. Besides, several studies are ongoing in other solid tumours characterized by those mutations, which might be blocked through imatinib treatment. Studies are in progress determining the place of imatinib in the \"complex therapy\". Resistance developed against the drug may be overcome by new molecules, such as SU 11248 or everolimus.

        "Doc_abstract":"The molecular basis of testicular germ cell tumourigenesis are not well elucidated. Growth factors regulate cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis. Major families of growth factors are present in the male gonad from early fetal development to adult life. They are involved in germ cell proliferation and differentiation. Growth signalling pathways suffer deregulation in many human malignancies. Given the importance of growth signals in normal testicular development and their acquired deregulation in most human cancers, growth factors and signalling molecules that have been implicated in the genesis of testicular germ cell tumours, are reviewed. We detected a somatic mutation of SMAD4 gene, responsible for loss of protein function in seminomas. This mutational inactivation may affect the activity of several members of TGFbeta superfamily (TGFbeta, activin, inhibin, BMP). VEGF expression has been shown to predict metastasis in seminomas. A significant association of HST-1 expression, a member of fibroblast growth factors, with the nonseminomatous phenotype and with tumour stage has been described. In contrast, C-KIT is expressed by seminomas only, from the preinvasive stage. Despite intense expression in almost all seminomas, activating mutation of C-KIT gene is seldom reported. Recently, the first animal model of classical testicular seminoma has been identified in transgenic mouse overexpressing GDNF. RET (GDNF receptor) expression is demonstrated in human seminomas, and not in nonseminomatous tumours. However, the exact molecular alterations of GDNF/RET/GFRalpha1 complex in germ cell tumours are not known. Finally, beside growth factors, other signalling molecules such as peptide hormones may be involved in testicular carcinogenesis. We have demonstrated a specific pattern of somatostatin receptors expression in each type of testicular germ cell tumours, with a loss of sst3 and sst4 in seminomas and loss of sst4 and expression of sst1 in nonseminomas only. These data suggest an antiproliferative action of somatostatin in testicular cancers. In summary, many growth factors and signalling molecules seem to represent specific markers for different histological types of germ cell tumours (seminomas versus nonseminomas) and may play a role in the differentiation of germ cell tumours. Despite a complex signalling pathway involved in the physiological functions of male gonad, little is known about the implication of this signalling network in testicular malignancies. From a practical stand-point, further studies on the role of growth factors in human germ cell tumours may offer a new therapeutical perspective with the development of specific pharmacological signalling modulators that could be used as therapeutic agents.",

A large-scale study on two different cohorts of HCCs was performed to investigate the clinicopathologic features and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related protein expression status of this subtype of HCCs. The expression status of stemness-related (e.g., keratin 19 [K19], cluster of differentiation [CD]133, epithelial cell adhesion molecule [EpCAM], and c-kit) and EMT-related markers (e.g., snail, S100A4, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor [uPAR], ezrin, vimentin, E-cadherin, and matrix metalloproteinase [MMP]2) were examined using tissue microarrays from cohort 1 HCCs (n = 137). K19 protein expression in cohort 2 HCCs (n = 237) was correlated with the clinicopathologic parameters and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of K19, uPAR, VIL2, Snail, Slug, and Twist. K19, EpCAM, c-kit, and CD133 positivity were observed in 18.2%, 35.0%, 34.3%, and 24.8%, respectively. K19 was most frequently expressed in combination with at least one other stemness-related marker (92.0%). K19-positive HCCs demonstrated more frequent major vessel invasion and increased tumor size, compared to K19-negative HCCs (P < 0.05). K19 was most significantly associated with EMT-related protein expression (e.g., vimentin, S100A4, uPAR, and ezrin) (P < 0.05) and a poor prognosis (overall survival: P = 0.018; disease-free survival: P = 0.007) in cohort 1. In cohort 2, HCCs with high K19 mRNA levels demonstrated higher mRNA levels of Snail, uPAR, and MMP2 (P < 0.05). K19-positive HCCs demonstrated more frequent microvascular invasion, fibrous stroma, and less tumor-capsule formation, compared to K19-negative HCCs (P < 0.05). K19 expression was a significant independent predictive factor of poor disease-free survival (P = 0.032).;K19 was well correlated with clinicopathologic features of tumor aggressiveness, compared to other stemness-related proteins.

        "Doc_abstract":"Hepatocarcinogenesis results from the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic changes in liver cells. A common mechanism through which these alterations induce liver cancer is by deregulating signaling pathways. A number of signaling pathways, including the PI3K/PTEN/AKT and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathways have been implicated in normal liver development as well as in cancer formation. In this study, we assessed the effect of the TGF-β signaling pathway on liver tumors induced by phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) loss. Inactivation of only the TGF-β receptor type II, Tgfbr2, in the mouse liver (Tgfbr2(LKO)) had no overt phenotype, while inactivation of Pten alone (Pten(LKO)), resulted in the formation of both hepatocellular carcinomas and cholangiocarcinomas (CC). Interestingly, deletion of both Pten and Tgfbr2 (Pten(LKO);Tgfbr2(LKO)) in the mouse liver resulted in a dramatic shift in tumor type to predominantly CC. Assessment of the PI3K/PTEN/AKT pathway revealed increased phosphorylation of AKT and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β) in both the Pten(LKO) and Pten(LKO);Tgfbr2(LKO) mice, suggesting that this pathway is constitutively active regardless of the status of the TGF-β signaling pathway. However, phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase was observed in the liver of all three phenotypes (Tgfbr2(LKO), Pten(LKO), Pten(LKO);Tgfbr2(LKO)) indicating that the loss of Tgfbr2 and/or Pten leads to an increase in this signaling pathway. Analysis of markers of liver progenitor/stem cells revealed that the loss of TGF-β signaling resulted in increased expression of c-Kit and CD133. Furthermore, in addition to increased c-Kit and CD133, Scf and EpCam expression were also increased in the double knock-out mice. These results suggest that the alteration in tumor types between the Pten(LKO) mice and Pten(LKO);Tgfbr2(LKO) mice is secondary to the altered regulation of stem-cell features induced by the loss of TGF-β signaling.

Here, we studied amuvatinib mechanism on RAD51 and functional HR.;Protein and RNA analyses, direct repeat green fluorescent protein (DR-GFP) assay and polysomal fractioning were used to measure HR efficiency and global translation in amuvatinib-treated H1299 lung carcinoma cells. Synergy of amuvatinib with IR or mitomycin c (MMC) was assessed by clonogenic survival assay.;Amuvaninib inhibited RAD51 protein expression and HR. This was associated with reduced ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation and inhibition of global translation. Amuvatinib sensitized cells to IR and MMC, agents that are selectively toxic to HR-deficient cells.;Amuvatinib is a promising agent that may be used to decrease tumor cell resistance. Our work suggests that this is associated with decreased RAD51 expression and function and supports the further study of amuvatinib in combination with chemotherapy and radiotherapy.",

The histogenesis of combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma has remained unclear for many years. However, recent advances in hepatic progenitor cell (HPC) investigations have provided new insights. The concept that combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma originates from HPCs is adopted in the chapter \"combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma\" of the latest World Health Organization (WHO) classification. In this study, we conducted clinicopathologic analysis of combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma according to the latest WHO classification. Fifty-four cases were included in this study. Pathologic diagnosis was made according to the WHO classification. When a tumor contained plural histologic patterns, predominant histologic pattern (≥50%) was defined. Minor histologic patterns were also appended. Immunohistochemical staining with biliary markers (CK7, CK19, and EMA), hepatocyte paraffin (HepPar)-1, HPC markers (CD56, c-kit, CD133, and EpCAM), and vimentin was performed. Forty-five and 50 patients were analyzed for progression-free survival and overall survival, respectively. Ten, 1, 32, and 11 cases were diagnosed as: combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma, classical type; combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma, stem cell features, typical subtype; combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma, stem cell features, intermediate cell subtype; and combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma, stem cell features, cholangiolocellular type, respectively. Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinomas usually have high expression of biliary markers. CD56, c-kit, and EpCAM were expressed to various degrees in all combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinomas apart from the hepatocellular carcinoma component of combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma, classical type. The expression of CD133 and vimentin was observed only in combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma, stem cell features of intermediate cell subtype and cholangiolocellular subtype. The expression of CD133, EpCAM, and vimentin was significantly high in combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma, subtypes with stem cell features, especially cholangiolocellular subtype. Minor histologic patterns were significantly frequent in combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma, subtypes with stem cell features, compared with combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma, classical type. There was no significant difference in clinical outcome between each subtype. Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma has wide histologic diversity and shows immunophenotypic expression of not only biliary markers but also HPC markers to various degrees, suggesting that the histogenesis of combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma could be strongly associated with HPCs. Our results pathologically validate the latest WHO classification of combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma. However, the complex mixture of histologic subtypes has presented a challenge to the classification of combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma. Further study should be conducted using a large cohort to support this classification.",

The clinicopathologic features were studied and the expression of CD117, CD34, smooth muscle actin and S-100 protein were detected by immunohistochemistry using EliVision method. The expression of proliferation marker Ki-67 was also studied. GIST with synchronous carcinoma and those without carcinoma were compared.;Nineteen cases (16.8%) of GIST with synchronous carcinoma were found, including 11 males and 8 females (male to female ratio 1.38: 1.00). The age of the patients ranged from 43 to 66 years (median age 57 years). Five of 19 cases were located in the inferior segment of esophagus and 14 were in the gastric wall. The diameter ranged from 0.6 to 3.8 cm [mean (1.91 ± 0.92) cm]. Three of 19 cases showed low grade dysplasia, and there was no dysplasia in the remaining 16 cases. The number of mitosis ranged from 0 to 4/50 HPF [mean (0.74 ± 1.07)/50 HPF]. The Ki-67 proliferative index (number of Ki-67 positive cell/HPF) ranged from 0 to 7.72% [mean (2.51 ± 2.20)%]. The synchronous carcinomas included two esophageal carcinomas and 17 gastric cancers.In contrast, patients of GIST without carcinoma included 52 males and 42 females (male to female ratio 1.24: 1.00). The age of patients ranged from 43 to 71 years (median age 55 years). Seventy-nine of the 94 cases were located in the stomach, 10 were in the intestine and 5 were in the esophagus. The diameter ranged from 2.4 to 15.5 cm [mean (5.42 ± 6.17) cm].Seventy-nine of the 94 cases showed variable degrees of dysplasia, and 12 cases were of high malignant potential. The number of mitosis ranged from 0 to 53/50 HPF [average (3.78 ± 10.22)/50 HPF]. The Ki-67 proliferative index ranged from 0 to 37.54% [mean (6.78 ± 12.45)%]. Comparing these two groups, the male to female ratio of GIST with synchronous carcinoma was higher than that of GIST without carcinoma. The average diameter of GIST with synchronous carcinoma was smaller than of those without carcinoma. The number of mitosis and Ki-67 proliferative index of GIST with synchronous carcinoma were significantly lower than those without carcinoma (t' = 2.809, P < 0.05; t' = 3.095, P < 0.05, respectively).;Sixteen point eight percent of GIST may be associated with synchronous carcinoma. There are no special clinical symptoms in most of GIST with synchronous carcinoma, as these GIST are usually incidental findings. The Ki-67 proliferative index of GIST with synchronous carcinoma is significantly lower than that of GIST without synchronous carcinoma. Most GIST with synchronous carcinoma can be treated by the standard treatment for the accompanying carcinoma, and do not require specific additional treatments.",

We compared genetic alterations and oncoprotein expression in the endometriotic ovarian cyst and the associated endometrioid adenocarcinoma.;Genomic instability was evaluated by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Onco-protein expression was analysed by immunohistochemistry with antibodies against bcl-2, c-MYC, cyclin D1, p53, HER-2 and KIT protein.;CGH revealed a gain of 8q, including the locus of the oncogene c-MYC at 8q24. Immunohistochemistry disclosed a differing protein expression profile between the epithelia of the pre-existing cyst and adenocarcinoma. Apart from HER-2, all onco-proteins were more strongly expressed in epithelial cells of the adenocarcinoma than of the endometriotic cyst.;The solitary genomic imbalance of chromosome 8 possibly reflects the importance for initiation and/or progression of endometrioid carcinoma. Overexpression of onco-proteins then may occur subsequently in the malignant transformation of ovarian endometriosis.

Here, we report 2 appendiceal gastrointestinal stromal tumors in a 78-year-old woman and a 72-year-old man with a history of endometrial adenocarcinoma and urinary bladder carcinoma, respectively. The first patient had a history of pelvic irradiation. Both gastrointestinal stromal tumors were incidental findings at surgery for appendicitis-like symptoms and on follow-up for bladder carcinoma, respectively. Tumors were 5 and 25 mm and were located in the mid portion and the tip, respectively. The larger gastrointestinal stromal tumor was pedunculated. Both revealed a spindle cell histology with variable stromal hyalinization and occasional skeinoid fibers in 1 case. Immunohistochemistry showed reactivity for CD117 and CD34 and loss of p16 in both. Case 2 overexpressed the catalytic subunit of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase immunohistochemically. Molecular analysis of KIT revealed a missense mutation K558R in case 1 and an in-frame deletion I571_R588 in case 2, both in the juxtamembrane domain (exon 11). Comparative genomic hybridization was successful in case 2 (larger lesion) and revealed no chromosomal imbalance. We suggest that the molecular pathogenesis of appendiceal gastrointestinal stromal tumors beyond initiating KIT mutations might be different from their gastric and intestinal counterparts. The coincidence of loss of p16 and overexpression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase seems to be in contradiction to the small size, the benign nature, and the limited growth potential of appendiceal gastrointestinal stromal tumors.",

Specific chromosomal aberrations have been described in several benign and malignant tumours; sarcomas may be divided into two subgroups based on cytogenetics, one with near-diploid karyotype and few chromosomal changes, but with specific translocations and one with complex karyotypes and multiple cytogenetic aberrations. Sarcomas should be karyotyped in order to identify chromosomal changes in general, whereas fluorescent in situ hybridisation and PCR are the most common methods for detecting the relevant, specific translocations. Genomic screening techniques, in particular microarray-based, global analyses of gene activities and copy numbers, will lead to smaller sets of informative gene assays that may be used in routine analysis.

Aberrant PTK activity resulting from gene mutation (often accompanying chromosome translocation) or overexpression of these enzymes plays an etiologic role in several clonal hematopoietic malignancies. Other than the causative effect of PTK product of the bcr/abl fusion gene on chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), more evidence suggests that mutated tyrosine kinases are pivotal in the pathogenesis of most of other chronic myeloproliferative disorders, such as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). And the exciting results in several dependent groups in 2005 showed that a single nucleotide JAK2 somatic mutation (JAK2V617F mutation) was found to be involved in the pathogenesis of polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (CIMF). In the leukogenesis of acute myeloid leukemias (AML), the losing of the control of the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells was principally the results of the aberrant PTK activity, such as FLT3 and C-kit overexpression. It works together with the loss of function mutation genes in promoting progenitor cell differentiation to confer AML's phenotypes. These upregulated PTK molecules represent attractive disease-specific targets, to which a new class of therapeutic agents are being developed.

In a significant proportion of cases, myeloid leukemias occur. Using conventional criteria, such leukemias resemble acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), or myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Mast cell leukemia (MCL) may also occur. Myeloid leukemias (AML, CML, CMML) can develop in indolent or aggressive mastocytosis (skin lesions present or absent) with a variable prephase of MC disease. By contrast, MCL (typically without skin lesions) often develops on a \"de novo\" basis, and, if at all recognized, a prephase resembling (malignant) mastocytosis, is short. MCL differs from myeloid leukemias (AML, CML, CMML) by morphologic and phenotypic cellular characteristics. In fact, MCL are strongly tryptase-positive, c-kit-positive, myeloperoxidase (MPO) -negative neoplasms with variable metachromasia and chloroacetate esterase expression, whereas an MPO-positive, tryptase-negative phenotype supports the diagnosis of a myeloid non-MC lineage disease. Thus, MCL, but also myeloid non-MC lineage leukemias can develop in patients with (systemic) mastocytosis. Little is known, however, about the pathophysiologic basis of co-evolution.

These included losses at 14q (gastric 83%, intestinal 35%; p = 0.001), losses at 22q (gastric 46%, intestinal 82%; p = 0.02), losses at 1p (gastric 23%, intestinal 88%; p = 1 x 10(-5)), losses at 15q (gastric 14%, intestinal 59%; p = 0.002), losses at 9q (gastric 14%, intestinal 53%; p = 0.006), and gains at 5p (gastric 11%, intestinal 53%; p = 0.002). These data demonstrate strong site-dependent genetic heterogeneity in GISTs that may form a basis for subclassification. Prognostic evaluation of DNA copy number changes identified losses at 9q as a site-independent prognostic marker associated with shorter disease-free survival (p = 0.03) and overall survival (p = 0.002). Furthermore, 9q loss also appeared to carry prognostic value in predicting overall survival for patients with advanced or progressive GISTs (p = 0.003).",

A total of 42 IFPs were gathered from the pathology archives of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center over the past 22 years. Clinical, histopathologic, and immunohistochemical features were collected. A random subset of IFPs (n = 12) underwent microdissection genotyping for a broad panel of tumor suppressor gene-associated mutations (loss of heterozygosity). IFPs occurred in both sexes (male, 17; female, 25) over a broad age range (29-85 years). IFPs varied in size from 0.2 to 8 cm. The stomach (n = 19) was the most common location, followed by large bowel (n = 13) and small bowel (n = 10). Most IFPs displayed typical morphologic features (eosinophils admixed with loose, mature fibrous tissue), and in 2 instances, sampled by biopsy, IFP was confused for sarcoma. All IFPs lacked c-kit staining. No mutations were identified in any IFPs examined. IFP is a clinically underrecognized entity with unique morphologic and immunohistochemical features.

They have a high selectivity against a specific molecular target known to be the cause for the establishment and maintenance of the malignant phenotype. Imatinib is a rationally designed oral signal transduction inhibitor that specifically targets several protein tyrosine kinases, Abl, Arg (Abl-related gene), the stem-cell factor receptor (c-KIT), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R), and their oncogenic forms, most notably Bcr-Abl. Imatinib has been shown to have remarkable clinical activity in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and malignant gastrointestinal stroma tumors (GIST) leading to its approval for treatment of these diseases.Treatment with imatinib is generally well tolerated with a low incidence of severe side effects. The most common adverse events (AE) include mild to moderate edema, muscle cramps, diarrhea, nausea, skin rashes, and myelosuppression.Several mechanisms of resistance have been identified. Clonal evolution, amplification, or overexpression of Bcr-Abl as well as mutations in the catalytic domain, P-loop, and other mutations have been demonstrated to play a role in primary and secondary resistance to imatinib, respectively. Improved understanding of the underlying mechanisms of resistance has led to the development of new second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (see Chaps. 7-9).",

However, dilution test of the patient's serum with higher TPA concentrations showed no linear relationship between TPA concentrations and diluted serum samples. The antigen measured by this IRMA was immunologically similar to TPA, and the TPS concentration was closely correlated (r = 0.835, p < 0.01) with the TPA concentration in 101 patient's serum.

        "Doc_abstract":"In the past decade, the clinico-pathologic characteristics of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) in the pancreas have been further elucidated. Previously termed \"islet cell tumors/carcinomas\" or \"endocrine neoplasms\", they are now called pancreatic NETs (PanNETs). They occur in relatively younger patients and may arise anywhere in the pancreas. Some are associated with von Hippel-Lindau, MEN1, and other syndromes. It is now widely recognized that, with the exception of tumorlets (minute incipient neoplasms) that occur in some syndromes like MEN1, all PanNETs are malignant, albeit low-grade, and although they have a protracted clinical course and overall 10-year survival of 60-70 %, even low-stage and low-grade examples may recur and/or metastasize on long-term follow-up. Per recent consensus guidelines adopted by both European and North American NET Societies (ENETS and NANETs) and WHO-2010, PanNETs are now graded and staged separately, unlike previous classification schemes that used a combination of grade, stage, and adjunct prognosticators in an attempt to define \"benign behavior\" or \"malignant\" categories. For staging, the ENETs proposal may be more applicable than CAP/AJCC, which is based on the staging of exocrine tumors. Current grading of PanNETs is based on mitotic activity and ki-67 index. Other promising prognosticators such as necrosis, CK19, c-kit, and others are still under investigation. It has also been recognized that PanNETs have a rather wide morphologic repertoire including oncocytic, pleomorphic, ductulo-insular, sclerosing, and lipid-rich variants. Most PanNETs are diagnosed by fine needle aspiration biopsy, in which single, monotonous plasmacytoid cells with fair amounts of cytoplasm and distinctive neuroendocrine chromatin are diagnostic. Molecular alterations of PanNETs are also very different than that of ductal or acinar tumors. Loss of expression of DAXX and ATRX proteins has been recently identified in 45 %. Along with these improvements, several controversies remain, including grading, value of current cutoff ranges, and the best methods for counting ki-67 index (manual count by computer-captured image may be the most practical for the time being). More important is the controversial use of the term \"carcinoma\", which was previously employed in WHO-2004 only for invasive and metastatic cases but has now been made synonymous with grade 3 group of tumors. It is becoming clear that grade 3 group comprises two distinct categories: (1) differentiated but proliferatively more active tumors which typically have ki-67 indices in the 20-50 % range and (2) true poorly differentiated NE carcinomas as defined in the lung, with ki-67 typically >50 %. Further studies are needed to address these controversial aspects of PanNETs.",

A 66-year-old man was found to have a mediastinal tumor on a routine chest X-ray examination, and was admitted to our hospital. Imaging modalities revealed a 5 x 4 cm tumor in the middle mediastinum near the bronchial carina. No other tumors were detected in the body including the lungs. Video-assisted thoracoscopy confirmed the mediastinal tumor, and a large incisional biopsy was performed. The tumor was histologically small cell carcinoma. An immunohistochemical study revealed positive reactions for cytokeratins (AE1/3, polyclonal), synaptophysin, neuron-specific enolase, CD56, KIT, and PDGFRA, and negative reactions for chromogranin, CEA, CD45, CD20, and CD3. Ki-67 labeling showed a value of 80%. A molecular genetic analysis using PCR-direct sequencing identified no mutations of KIT (exons 9, 11, 13, and 17) and PDGFRA (exons 12 and 18) genes. The patient received radiation and chemotherapy, and the tumor was fully resolved. The patient has remained free of recurrence for 6 years after the first presentation. The present case is the first reported case of primary small cell carcinoma of the mediastinum with an examination of KIT and PDGFRA expressions and KIT and PDFGRA gene mutations.",

Majority of these mutations cluster in the 5' end of the KIT juxtamembrane domain. Little is known about the clinicopathological profile of GIST carrying internal tandem duplications in the 3' end of KIT juxtamembrane domain (ITDs in the 3' KIT-JM). In this study, 500 immunohistochemically KIT-positive GISTs were screened for this type of mutation, and 18 cases were identified (3.6%). The majority of the ITDs consisted of 1 to 18 codon duplications, with Tyr(578), Asp(579), and Leu(576) being the most commonly duplicated codons. There were 14 gastric (78%), 2 small intestinal (11%), and 2 anal (11%) primary tumors diagnosed in 12 females and 6 males with median age of 71 years. The frequency of IDTs in gastric GISTs was 6.5% and was only 0.5% in intestinal GISTs. There was a strong female predominance (79%) among the patients with gastric tumors. Histologically, 16 GISTs were spindle cell, and 2 had epithelioid morphology. The sizes of primary tumors varied from 1 to >20 cm. Based on the combination of tumor size and mitotic activity, six tumors were classified as benign or probably benign, eight as having uncertain malignant potential, and only four as malignant. Follow-up data available in 17 patients confirmed the malignant course of disease in 3 cases. Only one of the tumors classified as potentially malignant metastasized, although the follow-up was limited in some cases. In summary, the great majority of GISTs with ITDs in the 3' KIT-JM were mitotically inactive tumors occurring predominantly in the stomach and that seemed to have a favorable course. This suggests that presence of these IDTs may define a clinicopathologically favorable subset of GISTs. The consequence of these mutations to KIT signaling should be investigated.",

Essential reduction in the concentration of the most tumorogenic CD44high cells with simultaneous rise in the number of CD117⁺-cells resulted in an increased index of CD44high/CD117⁺ ratio. It has been demonstrated that application of hybrid nanocomplexes suppressed the tumor growth almost by 80%. The value of cooperative interactions of the cells with different phenotype signs in tumor sites has been proved.

These novel targeted agents have demonstrated activity against a wide range of solid tumors, are generally better tolerated than standard chemotherapeutics, and may revolutionize the management of advanced refractory cancer. The ubiquitous Raf serine/threonine kinases are pivotal molecules within the Raf/mitogen extracellular kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) signaling pathway, which regulates cellular proliferation and survival. Raf kinase isoforms (wild-type Raf-1 or the b-raf V600E oncogene) are overactivated in a variety of solid tumor types, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, and papillary thyroid carcinoma. In this review, the role of Raf in normal cells and in cancer is discussed, and an overview is given of Raf inhibitors currently in development, focusing on sorafenib tosylate (BAY 43-9006 or sorafenib). Sorafenib is the first oral multi-kinase inhibitor to be developed that targets Raf kinases (Raf-1, wild-type B-Raf, and b-raf V600E), in addition to receptor tyrosine kinases associated with angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor [VEGFR]-2/-3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor [PDGFR]-beta) or tumor progression (Flt-3, c-kit).

The aim of this study was to determine whether interferon alpha could reduce the risk of HCC by modifying preneoplastic events in the hepatic progenitor cell population. Pre- and post-treatment liver biopsies were evaluated for changes in t he hepaticprogenitor cell population in 16 patients with non-responding chronic hepatitis C Interferon alpha-based treatment significantly reduced the numbers of c-kit-positive hepatic progenitor cells by 50%. To determine the mechanism of cell number reduction, the effects of interferon alpha on murinehepatic progenitor cells were studied in vitro. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) proliferation assay and proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining showed that interferon alpha had a dose-dependent, anti-proliferative effect Interferon alpha stimulated hepatocytic and biliary differentiation of the oval cell lines reflected by increased expression of albumin and cytokeratin19 accompanied by decreased expression of alphafetoprotein and Thy-1. To validatethese results in vivo, mice were placed on the choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented diet to induce liver injury and oval cell proliferation and treated with pegylated interferon alpha 2b for 2 weeks. This resulted in a significant four-fold reduction in the number of oval cells (P < .05).

Contrary to previous reports, KIT mutations were not identified preferentially in higher-grade tumors: indeed, they were found in each of 10 histologically benign GISTs. Notably, mutations in all KIT domains were associated with high-level KIT activation/phosphorylation, and KIT activation was also demonstrated in the four GISTs that lacked detectable KIT genomic and cDNA mutations.

Furthermore there is an upregulation of genes which stimulate malignant cell detection by immune system, such as genes of major histocompatibility complex HLA class I HLA-B and HLA-C, and interferon-γ receptors IFNGR1 and IFNGR2 genes.

The study was limited to paraffin-embedded archival material of resected untreated pulmonary carcinomas, including adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma. The sections were stained for putative stem cells markers (Musashi-1, Musashi-2, CD34, CD21, KIT, CD133, p63, and OCT-4). Positivity was read as isolated, focal, or diffuse staining. Stem cell markers were detected in all histological types of pulmonary carcinomas. There was a difference in the expression of markers among the histological types. Small cell carcinoma showed diffuse positivity for most of the markers; in contrast to focal or negative staining in other histological groups. An inverse relationship between CD21 and Musashi-1 was observed. No staining for OCT-4 and CD34 was seen in any of the tumor types. Hierarchical clustering based on marker expression separated tumors into two groups, with one group marked by high expression of Musashi-1 and KIT, contained most of the poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas and small cell carcinomas.

All formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumor samples were reviewed and immunohistochemically stained for ER, PR, HER2, Ki-67 antigen, epidermal growth factor receptor, cytokeratin 5/6, p53, vimentin, CD117, and p63 using tissue microarrays blocks. Triple-negative breast carcinomas corresponded to 34.6% (74/213) of the carcinomas from the younger patients and 16.2% (19/117) of the carcinomas from the older patients (p = 0.002). No significant differences in the frequency of the basal phenotype were observed in the two patient groups based on CK5/6 and/or epidermal growth factor receptor expression (74.3% vs. 68.4%). However, triple-negative breast carcinomas in the older patients presented a higher frequency of CK5/6 expression compared to those of younger patients (42.1% vs. 9.6%; p = 0.005), whereas triple-negative breast carcinomas of younger patients had a higher expression level of epidermal growth factor receptor (71.6% vs. 47.3%).;These results show that there were significant molecular differences between the triple-negative basal-like breast carcinomas that were diagnosed in younger women and those that were diagnosed in older women. These findings may provide a basis for describing the more aggressive phenotype of the triple-negative breast carcinomas observed in younger women.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Schwannomas are rare tumors originating from the Schwann cells, which form the neural sheath. These tumors occur most frequently in the head, neck, arms and limbs. Primary schwannomas of the colon and rectum are extremely rare; they are usually benign, but in extremely rare cases (2%), they can present with malignant degeneration if not surgically removed. The current study presents the case of a 65-year-old male with blood in the feces who underwent a colonoscopy that revealed an oval-shaped mass covered by ulcerated mucosa. A standard biopsy examination indicated a gelatinous carcinoma, and the patient consequently underwent a laparoscopic resection of the left colon. Histological examination revealed a schwannoma. Immunohistochemistry showed the tumor to be positive for S100 and vimentin, but negative for cluster of differentiation (CD)117, cytokeratin (CK)7, CK20, chromogranin, actin and synaptophysin, with a Ki-67 proliferative index of 3%. Lymph nodes were not involved. Overall, pre-operative biopsy examinations may be difficult for schwannomas, and immunohistochemistry is necessary for the correct diagnosis of this condition. In contrast to gastrointestinal stromal tumors, schwannomas are negative for CD117 and positive for S100 protein and vimentin. A Ki-67 index of ≥5% is strictly correlated with greater tumor aggressiveness. Therefore, the gold standard treatment for schwannomas is oncological radical surgical resection.",

Growth and metastasis formation in melanomas are regulated by a network of cytokines, cytokine-receptors, and adhesion molecules. However, little is known about surface antigens and target expression profiles in human melanomas. We examined the cell surface antigen profile of human skin melanoma cells by multicolor flow cytometry, and compared their phenotype with 4 melanoma cell lines (A375, 607B, Mel-Juso, SK-Mel28). Melanoma cells were defined as CD45-/CD31- cells co-expressing one or more melanoma-related antigens (CD63, CD146, CD166). In most patients, melanoma cells exhibited ErbB3/Her3, CD44/Pgp-1, ICAM-1/CD54 and IGF-1-R/CD221, but did not express CD20, ErbB2/Her2, KIT/CD117, AC133/CD133 or MDR-1/CD243. Melanoma cell lines were found to display a similar phenotype. In most patients, a distinct subpopulation of melanoma cells (4-40%) expressed the erythropoietin receptor (EPO-R) and ErbB4 together with PD-1 and NGF-R/CD271. Both the EPO-R+ and EPO-R- subpopulations produced melanoma lesions in NOD/SCID IL-2Rgamma(null) (NSG) mice in first and secondary recipients. Normal skin melanocytes did not express ErbB4 or EPO-R, but expressed a functional KIT receptor (CD117) as well as NGF-R, ErbB3/Her3, IGF-1-R and CD44. In conclusion, melanoma cells display a unique composition of surface target antigens and cytokine receptors. Malignant transformation of melanomas is accompanied by loss of KIT and acquisition of EPO-R and ErbB4, both of which are co-expressed with NGF-R and PD-1 in distinct subfractions of melanoma cells. However, expression of EPO-R/ErbB4/PD-1 is not indicative of a selective melanoma-initiating potential. ",

Differential expression profile of stemness genes between enriched OC-SLC and parental OSCC was elucidated. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining of stemness markers on OSCC patient tissues was examined to evaluate the association between stemness genes and prognosis of OSCC.;Enriched OC-SLC highly expressed the stem/progenitor cell markers and ABC transporter gene (Oct-4, Nanog, CD117, Nestin, CD133, and ABCG2) and also displayed induced differentiation abilities and enhanced migration/invasion/malignancy capabilities in vitro and in vivo. Elevated expression of CD133 was shown in the enriched OC-SLC from OSCC patients' tumors. Positive correlations of Oct-4, Nanog, or CD133 expression on tumor stage were shown on 52 OSCC patient tissues. Kaplan-Meier analyses exhibited that Nanog/Oct-4/CD133 triple-positive patients predicted the worst survival prognosis of OSCC patients.;We enriched a subpopulation of cancer stem-like cell from OSCC by sphere formation.

Tyrosine kinase receptors specific for certain growth factors represent attractive target molecules for anticancer therapy. SU5416 is a competitive inhibitor of VEGF receptor subtypes VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 and stem cell factor receptor c-kit. Preclinical evidence shows that SU5416 effectively inhibits VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation and slows growth of subcutaneous solid tumor xenografts.

However, a lymph node biopsy and bone marrow aspiration conducted on his third admission indicated a SMCD because of the existence of metachromatic cell aggregates stained with toluidine blue. At autopsy, the diagnosis was confirmed because the proliferating cells were histochemically proven to be mast cells by naphthol AS.D chloroacetate esterase, Giemsa and alcian blue, in addition to toluidine blue staining. The intra-abdominal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes were replaced by mast cell aggregates, which caused the splenic infarction and bilateral hydronephrosis, with infiltration of mast cells into the spleen and kidneys also being apparent. Mast cell infiltration was similarly found in the bone marrow, liver, ileum and ascending colon. Immunohistochemically, the mast cells were positive for antibodies of alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, CD45 (LCA), CD43 (MT-1), CD45R (MB-1) and the oncoprotein c-kit. Electron microscopic examination using formalin-fixed tissue gave supportive evidence of a mast cell origin for the lesions.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Mucosal melanoma is a rare, aggressive histologic subtype of malignant melanoma, and prognosis for patients with metastatic mucosal melanoma is very poor. In general, conventional cytotoxic agents alone or in combination with immunologic drugs have limited clinical benefit. Advances in molecular analytic techniques have helped researchers discover genetic aberrations in KIT, a receptor tyrosine kinase, in nearly 40% of patients with mucosal melanoma. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that hot-spot mutations, mostly substitutions in exons 11 and 13, result in constitutive activation of KIT and its downstream signal transduction pathways, such as the MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT pathways. KIT inhibitors, most notably imatinib, have shown promising clinical activity in KIT-mutant advanced melanoma, including mucosal melanoma, with clinical response rates exceeding 35% in patients with hot-spot mutations in exon 11 or 13 and/or a high mutant/wild-type allelic ratio. However, the duration of disease control is rather short in general, and treatment with KIT inhibitors as single agents is not optimal. Well-designed mechanistic studies aimed at assessing molecular differences between various KIT mutations or other aberrations and mechanisms of resistance are urgently needed to improve KIT-targeting therapy for melanoma. In addition, with availability of checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-CTLA4 and/or anti-PD-1 antibodies, immunotherapies using those inhibitors alone or in combinations of such immunotherapies with KIT inhibitors may lead to more effective therapeutic regimens. This review discusses the rationale for KIT inhibitor therapy in patients with metastatic mucosal melanoma and the findings of preclinical and clinical studies of KIT inhibitors in this patient population.

Its efficacy and mechanisms were compared with sorafenib. SL1122-37 significantly prevented PLC/PRF/5 cell proliferation as estimated by colorimetric assay. Flow cytometry analysis showed the induction of apoptosis and arrest of cell cycle in G1 phase. Western blotting showed the decrease of cyclin D1 and regulation of apoptotic proteins. Further analysis suggested that these effects of SL1122-37 might arise from its roles in the inhibition of multi-kinases, including c-Kit and its downstream targets and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in PLC/PRF/5 cells. SL1122-37 also possessed the activity of antiangiogenesis, showing the prevention of HUVEC migration and capillary tube formation. Western blotting indicated the inhibition of VEGF and phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 in HUVECs.

Systemic therapy with cytotoxic drugs such as doxorubicin and cisplatin achieves low objective response rates (typically <10%) and even sorafenib, an orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitor considered a breakthrough when introduced, prolongs median survival by little more than a year. Sorafenib blocks platelet-derived growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, c-KIT and rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma signaling, and belongs to a new class of targeted drugs. It has become standard treatment for advanced-stage HCC in recent years. To date, no other agent has been shown to be more effective than sorafenib in the clinical setting, which highlights the need for ongoing research to address this important clinical challenge.

Characteristics of ASCP include central tumor necrosis, along with osteoclasts and hypercalcemia. Various theories exist as to why this histological subtype exists, as normal pancreas tissue has no benign squamous epithelium. Due to the rarity of this disease, limited molecular analysis has been performed, and those reports indicate unique molecular features of ASCP. In this paper, we characterize 23 patients diagnosed with ASCP through molecular profiling using immunohistochemistry staining, fluorescent in situ hybridization, chromogenic in situ hybridization, and gene sequencing, Additionally, we provide a comprehensive literature review of what is known to date of ASCP. Molecular characterization revealed overexpression in MRP1 (80%), MGMT (79%), TOP2A (75), RRM1 (42%), TOPO1 (42%), PTEN (45%), CMET (40%), and C-KIT (10%) among others. One hundred percent of samples tested were positive for KRAS mutations. This analysis shows heretofore unsuspected leads to be considered for treatments of this rare type of exocrine pancreas cancer. Molecular profiling may be appropriate to provide maximum information regarding the patient's tumor. Further work should be pursued to better characterize this disease. ",

We reviewed a series of 65 sarcomas with a myogenic differentiation developed in the internal trunk for which initial diagnoses were leiomyosarcoma (37), rhabdomyosarcoma (6), malignant mesenchymoma (6), and DLPS (16). Immunostainings for MDM2, CDK4, alpha smooth actin, desmin, caldesmon, myogenin, c-kit, and progesterone receptor were performed. In 48 cases, the amplification status of MDM2 and CDK4 could be evaluated with quantitative polymerase chain reaction on paraffin-embedded tissues extracted DNAs. After review of the cases, final diagnoses were leiomyosarcoma (35), rhabdomyosarcomatous (20) or leiomyosarcomatous (7) DLPS, probable DLPS (2), and malignant mesenchymoma (1). DLPS were bigger tumors (median: 18.2 cm) than leiomyosarcomas (median: 12 cm). They had a lower 5-year recurrence-free survival than leiomyosarcomas (45% vs. 71%) but a higher 5-year metastasis-free survival (73% vs. 39%). There was no significant difference in overall survival (57% vs. 34%). Outcome of patients with a DLPS with a myosarcomatous component did not differ from conventional DLPS.

GISTs are immunohistochemically identified by the expression of the c-kit protein, which is not detected in other mesenchymal tumours. The role of imaging includes the detection (subjects with occult gastrointestinal bleeding, incidental recognition, etc.), characterisation, analysis of relations between mass and gastrointestinal wall, staging, prognostic assessment (recognition of signs of malignancy and unfavourable prognosis), and follow-up during specific treatment. Owing to the frequent exophytic growth of these lesions, differentiation of these tumours from nondigestive lesions of different nature is a common diagnostic problem. Imaging findings usually allow differentiation from gastrointestinal epithelial tumours but not from non-epithelial tumours, for which histological confirmation is necessary, in part to verify potential response to therapy. Smaller lesions, which are usually benign, tend to be well-defined, relatively homogeneous, and with intraluminal growth. Larger lesions normally show well-defined or ill-defined margins, inhomogeneous density both on unenhanced and on contrast-enhanced scans, with combined intraluminal/extraluminal growth and a tendency to spread to surrounding structures.

This study was performed to determine whether data derived from its use were comparable to published S-phase data from the use of thymidine labeling, BRDU, or other methods on breast carcinomas. Primary infiltrating ductal carcinomas (n = 142) and primary lobular carcinomas (n = 6) showed mean and median BRDU labeling of 4.63% and 3%, 1.3% and 1%, respectively, with a range of 0-28%. Benign lesions always had less than 3% BRDU uptake (n = 21). Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status correlated with BRDU labeling (P less than 0.05), with the highest S-phase fractions in ER- and PR-negative tumors. Correlations between BRDU uptake and histologic tumor type or size were observed. Significant correlations between BRDU uptake and lymph node status, patient age, or histologic tumor grade were not observed. S-phase studies of breast carcinomas using other techniques have shown similar data, therefore, the Cell Proliferation Kit appears to be a practical and useful method for in vitro S-phase analysis that allows concomitant histologic examination of the same tumor tissue sample.",

To clarify the significance of KIT, EGFR, and HER-2 in undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma (UTC), the expression of these receptors and tyrosine phosphorylation was examined immunohistochemically in resected cases of UTC and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). KIT, EGFR, and HER-2 were also examined at the protein and mRNA levels in five UTC cell lines. KIT expression (1+), EGFR overexpression (2+/3+), HER-2 expression (1+), and tyrosine phosphorylation were detected immunohistochemically in 40%, 70%, 10%, and 50% of the 10 UTC. In 20 PTC, KIT, EGFR, and HER-2 were not detected, but tyrosine phosphorylation was detected in 25% of cases. In the five UTC cell lines, KIT expression (1+), EGFR overexpression (3+), HER-2 expression (1+), and tyrosine phosphorylation were detected immunocytochemically in 60%, 100%, 20%, and 40%, respectively. Western blot analysis did not detect KIT expression, but did detect EGFR and HER-2 expression in all five cell lines. Real-time polymerase chain reaction detected KIT mRNA in two of the cell lines (40%), EGFR in five (100%), and HER-2 in three (60%). The present findings suggest that EGFR overexpression was involved in the proliferation and development of UTC and was frequently accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation. Expression of KIT and HER-2 appeared to be weak but significant, suggesting a possible role in the development of UTC. Molecular therapies targeting KIT, EGFR, HER-2, and/or tyrosine phosphorylation might be indicated for UTC.",

Primary neoplastic Kit D816V(+) MCs in patients with mastocytosis also displayed activated Stat5, which was found to localize to the cytoplasm and to form a signaling complex with PI3K, with consecutive Akt activation. Finally, the knock-down of either Stat5 or Akt activity resulted in growth inhibition of neoplastic Kit D816V(+) MCs.

Cholangiocarcinoma [Web page]. emedicine from WebMD, http://www.emedicine.com/med/TOPIC343.HTM , accessed July 22, 2008). Currently, the only treatment option that offers a potential for cure is radical surgical resection. Typically, only 30% of patients qualify for this, while, for the remainder, treatment is only palliative (Chabner BA et al. Harrison's manual of oncology. New York: McGraw-Hill; 2008). Sorafenib is an oral-targeted agent that acts as a multikinase inhibitor and competitively inhibits the Raf, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), VEGFR3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta, Flt3, and C-KIT receptors (Chabner BA et al. Harrison's manual of oncology. New York: McGraw-Hill; 2008). It has demonstrated effective clinical antitumor activity in both renal cell and inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma gaining Food and Drug Administration approval for the latter carcinoma in November 2007. Its role in advanced cholangiocarcinoma is yet to be defined.;Two female patients with biopsy-proven multifocal moderately differentiated cholangiocarcinoma received single-agent sorafenib at standard doses.;Both patients derived benefit in the form of disease stabilization with negligible cancer-related side effects lasting 4+ months.

Complete data were obtained for 586 patients. The predictive value of the markers was first analyzed individually by univariate analysis (log rank test) in 586 node-negative tumors, according to metastatic status during follow-up. Twenty-seven markers had significant prognostic value. ROC curve analysis (logistic regression) was then used to determine the marker combination that best classified the patients with and without metastases. A 15-marker signature (Bcl2, P16, P21, P27, P53, CD34, CA IX, c-kit, FGF-R1, P38, JAK, pSTAT3, CK9, STAT1 and ER) correctly classified 84.8% of the patients (sensitivity 85.5%, specificity 84.6%). When ER, PR and c-erb B2 were excluded from the analysis, a very similar signature, in which CK8-18 replaced ER, correctly classified 83.6% of the patients (sensitivity 84.5%, specificity 83.4%). These results show that quantitative immunoprofiling, independently of ER, PR and c-erb B2 status, can provide a basal-like signature, can properly predict the metastatic risk of node-negative breast carcinomas at diagnostic time.

In fact, although thymic tumors are responsive to different cytotoxic regimens, none has been demonstrated to be the ideal one. New therapies and strategies should be designed and tested in large-scale multicenter prospective trials. Among the others, epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors have shown some clinical response, because EGFR is overexpressed in thymoma. c-KIT is overexpressed in thymic carcinoma. Although in a recent study a clinical response to imatinib has been reported, results of a prospective study in patients who have thymic carcinoma are pending. Clinical responses have been reported also to other tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as dasatinib. Other reports have stressed the presence of an up-regulation of COX-2 with a potential separate therapeutic pathway. Other markers, such as the expression of thymidine synthase and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, which predict sensitivity to 5-fluoruracil-based chemotherapy, were not correlated with the clinicopathological characteristics in a series of thymomas.

The patient is now alive without metastasis 4 months after the operation. Grossly, a large polypoid tumor (5 x 6 x 5 cm) was present in the bladder. Microscopically, the tumor consisted of high-grade transitional cell carcinoma element (10% in area) and sarcomatoid element (90% in area). There was a gradual transition between the two. The tumor cells were invaded into peribladder tissue (pT3b). Immunohistochemically, the sarcomatoid element was positive for four types of pancytokeratins, high-molecular weight cytokeratin (CK), CK5/6, CK7, CK18, CK19, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), vimentin, p53 protein, p63, Ki-67 (labeling = 92%), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFRA).

With upper gastrointestinal disease, discrimination is comparable to that achieved with TAG by other workers and also to that achieved with CEA. For gastric carcinoma TAG has a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 77%. With lower gastrointestinal tract disease discrimination was poor, TAG having a sensitivity of 76% but a specificity of 44% for colorectal carcinoma. Discrimination between pancreatic carcinoma and chronic pancreatitis was poor, TAG having a sensitivity of 100% for carcinoma and a specificity of 22%.",

Therefore, deciphering the signaling networks downstream of these oncogenic stimuli remains a challenge to gather insights into targeted therapy. To elucidate the biochemical networks connecting the Kit mutant to leukemogenesis, in the present study, we performed a global profiling of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from mutant Kit-driven murine leukemia proerythroblasts and identified Shp2 and Stat5 as proximal effectors of Kit. Shp2 or Stat5 gene depletion by sh-RNA, combined with pharmacologic inhibition of PI3kinase or Mek/Erk activities, revealed 2 distinct and independent signaling pathways contributing to malignancy. We demonstrate that cell survival is driven by the Kit/Shp2/Ras/Mek/Erk1/2 pathway, whereas the G(1)/S transition during the cell cycle is accelerated by both the Kit/Stat5 and Kit/PI3K/Akt pathways. The combined use of the clinically relevant drugs NVP-BEZ235, which targets the cell cycle, and Obatoclax, which targets survival, demonstrated synergistic effects to inhibit leukemia cell growth. This synergy was confirmed with a human mast leukemia cell line (HMC-1.2) that expresses mutant Kit. The results of the present study using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analysis have elucidated signaling networks downstream of an oncogenic kinase, providing a molecular rationale for pathway-targeted therapy to treat cancer cells refractory to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.",

Pathologic examination of the resected specimen will not always be able to confirm the diagnosis, leaving the surgeon with an uncertainty as to what type of resection is best for the patient. The following report describes the case of a 58-year-old man with the rare diagnosis of paraganglioma-like MTC.;The patient presented with markedly elevated calcitonin (CT) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. A 1-cm tumor was detected in the right lobe of the thyroid. Based on the clinical diagnosis of MTC, we performed a total thyroidectomy with lymphadenectomy of the central and right lateral compartments. Paraffin sections of the resected specimen were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemically characterized using antibodies to CT, CEA, chromogranin A, thyroglobulin, synaptophysin, sustentacular cells (SCs), low- and high-molecular cytokeratins (CK 5/6, 7, 18, 20), epidermal growth factor-receptor (EGFR), thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), bcl-2, Melan A, C-kit, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and galectin-3. The patient's blood and tumor tissue were examined for mutations in the RET-protooncogene.;H&E staining of both frozen and permanent sections was unable to differentiate benign from malignant tissue. Typical morphologic characteristics for MTC were completely absent. Only the additional finding of positivity for synaptophysin and numerous SC cells visible in-between neoplastic cells made the diagnosis of paraganglioma-like MTC possible. Sequencing of the RET proto-oncogene revealed no mutations.;There are subgroups of MTC that present clinically similar to classic MTC, but in which missing typical morphologic characteristics make histopathology diagnosis difficult. In these cases, diagnosis, operative decisions, and follow-up strategies should be based on preoperative biochemical markers, imaging findings, and clinical parameters in accordance to the guidelines for classic MTC.",

Fresh peripheral blood samples (treated with Beckman Coulter IMMUNOPrep erythrocyte lysis solution), HPC-A samples (treated with BD Biosciences FACSLysing solution), or processed by Ficoll Hypaque sedimentation method were stained with CD45-FITC and PE-labeled CD34, CD90, CD117, and CD133 antibodies and analyzed for electronic volume and two color fluorescence. The mean electronic volume and diameter of mononuclear cells from fresh peripheral blood samples prepared with IMMUNOPrep were lymphocytes (191 microm(3), 7.16 microm), monocytes (370 microm(3), 9.91 microm), and granulocytes (328 microm(3), 8.56 microm). In mononuclear cells of HPC-A samples prepared by Histopaque-1077 sedimentation, the lymphocytes had volume and diameter of 311 microm(3), 8.4 microm, monocytes were 486 microm(3), 9.76 microm, and granulocytes were 515 microm(3), 9.95 microm. In contrast, HPC-A samples prepared after lysis with FACSLysing solution had mean electronic volume and diameter of lymphocytes (414 microm(3), 9.25 microm), monocytes (797 microm(3), 11.5 microm), and granulocytes (670 microm(3), 10.85 microm). Cell volume of mononuclear cells in the HPC-A samples prepared by Histopaque-1077 sedimentation method was correlated with the expression of stem cell markers CD34, CD90, CD117, and CD133.

        "Doc_abstract":"The role of the KIT protooncogene in human hematopoiesis is uncertain. Therefore, we examined KIT mRNA expression in normal human bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNC) and used antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (oligomers) to disrupt KIT function. KIT mRNA was detected with certainty only in growth factor-stimulated MNC. Expression was essentially abrogated by making MNC quiescent or by inhibiting myb gene function. Oligomers blocked KIT mRNA expression in a dose-response and sequence-specific manner, thereby allowing functional examination of the KIT receptor. In experiments with either partially purified or CD34(+)-enriched MNC, neither granulocyte nor megakaryocyte colony formation was inhibited by oligomer exposure. In contrast, KIT antisense oligomers inhibited interleukin 3/erythropoietin-driven erythroid colony formation approximately 70% and \"stem cell factor\"/erythropoietin-driven colony formation 100%. The presence of erythroid progenitor cell subsets with differential requirements for KIT function is therefore suggested. Growth of hematopoietic colonies from chronic myeloid leukemia and polycythemia vera patients was also inhibited, while acute leukemia colony growth appeared less sensitive to KIT deprivation. These results suggest that KIT plays a predominant role in normal erythropoiesis but may be important in regulating some types of malignant hematopoietic cell growth as well. They also suggest that KIT expression is linked to cell metabolic activity and that its expression may be regulated by or coregulated with MYB.",

He was diagnosed as having obstructive jaundice caused by a pancreatic head tumor.

In order to mimic clinical treatment and to investigate longterm effects of cisplatin in surviving cancer cells, two EOC cell lines were repeatedly treated with low doses. In the SKOV-3 cell line originating from malignant ascites, but not in A2780 cells from a primary tumor, this led to emergence of a stable population (SKOV-3-R) which in the absence of cisplatin showed increased motility, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and expression of cancer stem cell markers CD117, CD44 and ALDH1. Accordingly, the cells formed self-renewing spheres in serum-free stem cell medium. Despite upregulation of mitochondrial mass and cytochrome c, and no upregulation of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL, SKOV-3-R were multiresistant to antineoplastic drugs. Cancer stem cells, or tumor-initiating cells (TICs) are highly chemoresistant and are believed to cause relapse into disseminated and resistant EOC. Our second aim was therefore to target resistance in these TIC-like cells. Resistance could be correlated with upregulation of hexokinase-II and VDAC, which are known to form a survival-promoting mitochondrial complex. The cells were thus sensitive to 3-bromopyruvate, which dissociates hexokinase-II from this complex, and were particularly sensitive to combination treatment with cisplatin at doses down to 0.1 x IC 50. 3-bromopyruvate might thus be of use in targeting the especially aggressive TIC populations.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Neuroendocrine tumors, 1-2% of all malignancies, are relatively slow-growing neoplasms. The majority of neuroendocrine tumors belong to the World Health Organization Group 2 with well-differentiated endocrine carcinomas, but some tumors can be aggressive. The most common are gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine tumors, followed by bronchopulmonary neuroendocrine tumors; less frequent locations are the ovaries, testis and hepatobiliary locations. They can be either non-functioning tumors with symptoms related to mass effects and malignant tumor disease or functioning tumors with specific hormones/neuropeptides autonomously secreted to induce specific clinical syndromes. Localized neuroendocrine tumors are less frequent than metastatic ones; in fact, up to 75% of patients with small bowel neuroendocrine tumors and 30-85% of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors present with liver metastases either at the time of diagnosis or during the course of the disease. The predominant metastatic site is the liver, which is the best prognostic marker of survival regardless of the primary site. If surgical resection or interventional therapies of the hepatic tumor burden are not feasible, or if the metastases are not confined to the liver, systemic treatment remains the only option. None of the systemic therapies is liver-specific, but rather acts on all metastatic sites. The lack of prospective studies comparing different treatment modalities in homogeneous cohorts of patients makes the best treatment strategy poorly defined. Standard systemic therapy options are somatostatin analogues (octreotide and lanreotide), interferon-α and chemotherapy. Somatostatin analogues not only control symptoms related to functioning tumors but tumor growth as well. Because of the studies challenging its efficacy, as well as the potential for side effects, the more widespread acceptance of interferon-α in the treatment of metastatic neuroendocrine tumors has been limited. Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors do not show high sensitivity to chemotherapy because of their low mitotic rates, high levels of antiapoptotic protein bcl-2 and increased expression of the multi-drug resistant gene. Traditional chemotherapeutic agents are streptozotocin in combination with 5-fluorouracil or doxorubicin, or to some extent dacarbazine. Temozolomide, capecitabine and oxaliplatin, as monoagents or in combination therapy, show efficacy in phase II trials. Patients with poorly differentiated neuroendocrine tumor, regardless of the primary tumor localization, are candidates for cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy regimen. Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy is reported to be an effective treatment option for patients with good performance status and high somatostatin-receptor scintigraphy uptake as well as without major liver involvement. Basic fibroblast growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor alpha and beta, insulin-like growth factor type 1, epidermal growth factor, stem cell factor (c-kit), and corresponding receptors have been shown to be expressed in Neuroendocrine tumors. Current phase II-III clinical trials with molecular-targeted therapies revealed promising agents such as everolimus (RAD001), an oral mTOR inhibitor, and sunitinib malate (SU-11248), an oral multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor against vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, platelet-derived growth factor receptors, c-kit receptors, glial cell linederived neurotrophic factor, and FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (Flt 3), which were approved for the treatment of advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Ongoing clinical trials with bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor, will further define the role of angiogenesis inhibitors in advanced intestinal neuroendocrine tumors. Various further novel strategies of targeted therapy and microRNA-regulated pathways in neuroendocrine tumors are under development.",

Indeed this tyrosine kinase receptor, besides being essential for the survival and proliferation of primordial germ cells (PGCs) and for postnatal spermatogenesis and oogenesis, is also frequently overexpressed or constitutively active due to activating mutations in carcinoma in situ of the testis and in seminomas. In this review, I will summarize available data about the transcriptional mechanisms involved in the control of Kit expression in the germline. Variable mechanisms, involving different germ cell-specific transcription factors, are operating in the various developmental stages: SOX2 and SOHLH1/2 act as direct positive regulators in PGCs and in postnatal spermatogonia, respectively, whereas PLZF suppresses KIT expression in spermatogonial stem cells. DMRT1, acting through indirect mechanisms, suppresses KIT transcription in fetal gonocytes, while activating it in differentiating spermatogonia.",

The nonovarian malignancies consisted of colorectal, breast, lung, and pancreatic carcinomas. The mean ratio for serum from patients with nonovarian cancers was 0.94 (n = 19); for ovarian-cancer patients (n = 45), 916. Therefore, determining this ratio will greatly improve the specificity of the CA 125 test for ovarian cancer.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas are uncommon neoplasms of low malignant potential and of uncertain histogenesis. A small percentage of patients develop metastatic disease and some succumb to disease. The management of patients with metastatic disease or unresectable tumor, and patients who are just not good surgical candidates is problematic. Novel therapy targets are needed. Successful treatment of metastatic and unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumors with KIT kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), makes it intriguing to look at the status of KIT in solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas. In this study, we investigated KIT expression in 50 solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms by immunohistochemical staining. Of the 50 (50%) solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms, 25 showed diffuse expression (in >50% neoplastic cells) of KIT and additional five (10%) cases showed focal staining (in 10-50% neoplastic cells). Expression of KIT was not associated with tumor behavior and prognosis. A subset of 11 cases showing diffuse KIT expression detected by immunohistochemical staining were further evaluated for the presence of activating mutations in KIT exons 9, 11, 13 and 17, and PDGFRA exons 12 and 18 using PCR amplification followed by direct sequencing. However, no KIT or PDGFRA mutations were identified in any of these 11 cases tested, suggesting that the overexpression of KIT is probably not due to activating mutations in KIT or PDGFRA. The exact mechanism of KIT overexpression in solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms remains to be elucidated. One possible mechanism is gene dose effect (increased copies of KIT gene). Experience in gastrointestinal stromal tumors and other tumors have shown that mutation-mediated activation of KIT or PDGFRA is a prerequisite for clinical response with imatinib mesylate. Thus, lack of mutations in KIT or PDGFRA in solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms suggests that imatinib mesylate is less likely to be effective in the treatment for patients with metastatic disease or unresectable tumor, and patients who are just not good surgical candidates.",

The primary treatment for GIST is surgery, which cures most patients with low- or intermediate-risk tumours. The introduction of the kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate, and sunitinib in second line, against KIT and PDGFRA has provided the first evidence of directed therapy in GIST. The aim of this review is to highlight the growing evidence that KIT and PDGFRA genotyping provides valuable information for the clinical management of GIST patients. We show that KIT and PDGFRA genotyping has emerged as one of the principal factors in the evaluation of GISTs, particularly in those tumours that are clearly malignant or have a high risk of recurrence.

Less common KIT exon 9 Ala502_Tyr503dup mutants occur predominantly in intestinal GISTs and are less sensitive to imatinib. An Asp842Val substitution in exon 18 is the most common PDGFRA mutation. GISTs with such mutation are resistant to imatinib. PDGFRA mutations are associated with gastric GISTs, epithelioid morphology and a less malignant course of disease. GISTs in neurofibromatosis 1, Carney triad and paediatric tumours generally lack KIT and PDGFRA mutations. Secondary KIT mutations affect exons 13-17.

The assay procedure is simple and based on the one-step IRMA system. There were no problems in reproducibility, dilution test and recovery test. The minimum detectable dose was 0.3 ng/ml. The antigen measured by this kit was immunologically cross-reactive with tissue polypeptide antigen (TPA) and CYFRA 21-1 concentration was closely correlated with TPA concentration in the patient's serum (r = 0.86, p < 0.01). The cut-off value of serum CYFRA 21-1 based on the assay results of this kit was calculated to be 1.6 ng/ml from the receiver operating characteristic curve. Three of 47 healthy subjects (6.4%) and 9 of 30 patients with benign lung diseases (30.0%) showed a concentration over the cut-off value. By contrast, serum CYFRA 21-1 concentration was elevated in 31 of 50 patients with lung cancer (62.0%), 11 of 13 squamous cell carcinoma patients (84.6%), 8 of 12 small cell carcinoma patients (66.7%), 4 of 7 large cell carcinoma patients (57.1%) and 8 of 18 adenocarcinoma patients (44.4%). In addition, the positive rate of serum CYFRA 21-1 in patients with lung cancer gradually increased with staging of the disease: 50.0% in stage I, 50.0% in stage II, 61.9% in stage III, and 76.9% in stage IV.

No smooth muscle differentiation was apparent in the sarcoma by immunohistochemistry or ultrastructural analysis. By fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis of the sarcomatous component there was monosomy of the X chromosome, but no apparent variation from the normal diploid pattern for chromosomes 3, 7, 12, and 17.

In this study, we report 36 GIST patients whose tumors had homozygous KIT exon 11 mutations detected by direct sequencing of PCR products. Loss of heterozygosity in KIT locus and other chromosome 4 loci were documented in majority of these tumors. However, fluorescence in situ hybridization with KIT locus-specific probe and chromosome 4 centromeric enumeration probe showed no evidence of KIT hemizygosity in a majority of analyzed cases. These findings are consistent with duplication of chromosome 4 with KIT mutant allele. Homozygous KIT exon 11 mutations were found in 33 primary tumors and 7 metastatic lesions. In two cases, shift from heterozygosity to homozygosity was documented during tumor progression being present in metastases, but not in primary tumors. Among primary GISTs, there were 16 gastric, 18 intestinal and 2 from unknown locations. An average primary tumor size was 12 cm and average mitotic activity 32/50 HPFs.

To induce the experimental testicular teratoma, male gonadal ridges from 12-day-old 129/SvJ-mouse fetuses were grafted into the testes of adult mice for 1-12 weeks. The developing tumour was analysed by light and electron microscopy and by immunocytochemical localization of transcription factors SOX9 and c-kit, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and type IV collagen. Testicular teratoma was observed in 36 out of 124 testes with implanted fetal gonadal ridges (frequency 29%). One spontaneous testicular teratoma was observed in this material from 70 male mice (1.5%). One week after implantation intracordal clusters of cells were seen in embryonic testicular cords of the graft as the first sign of testicular teratomas. Four weeks after implantation the embryonic testicular cords had totally disappeared from grafts with teratomas, and the tumour tissue had enlarged the testis and invaded the interstitium of the host testis. It consisted of solitary pieces of immature cartilage as well as of glial cells and of primitive neuroepithelium. Six to eight weeks after implantation the tumour tissue had expanded so that the enlarged testis could be detected by macroscopic enlargement of the scrotum. The testicular tissue of the host had practically disappeared, and only solitary disrupted seminiferous tubules of the host were seen surrounding the teratoma. Neuroepithelial structures of some teratomas cultured for 8 weeks had cells with a granular nucleus as a sign of obvious apoptosis. Eleven to 12 weeks after implantation the growth of the teratoma had stopped, and the histology corresponded to that of a mature cystic teratoma. GFAP, SOX9 and type IV collagen were strongly positive in some parts of the tumours cultured for 4 and 8 weeks, while only occasional c-kit-positive areas were observed in tumours cultured for 8 weeks. As conclusions: (1) the metastasizing capacity of the experimental testicular teratoma is very low during 12 weeks, but the behaviour of the tumour in the testicular tissue of the graft is invasive; (2) the growth of experimental testicular teratomas cease 6-8 weeks after implantation of the fetal gonadal ridges with the obvious apoptosis of the immature tissue components; (3) the model of experimental testicular teratoma in the mouse is suitable for studying how the teratoma affects the host testis and how the host testis reacts to teratoma.",

However, tumors, initially responsive to anti-angiogenic drugs or vascular targeting agents, can acquire resistance. The limited clinical efficacy might result from the heterogeneous nature of tumors or alternatively from the unique phenotype of tumor vascular cells, widely diverse from so-called 'normal' endothelium. Hence, defining the molecular mechanisms driving this diversity might provide a rational basis to design combinatory therapies that should be more effective in avoiding resistance. Herein, we demonstrated that tumor-derived endothelial cells (TECs) isolated from breast and kidney carcinomas retained an endothelial phenotype, but outspread independently of growth factors. Applying small interfering RNA approach, we demonstrated that interleukin (IL)-3, but not vascular endothelial growth factor, released by TECs, supports their autocrine growth and promotes in vivo vessel formation and tumor angiogenesis. Meanwhile, we found that the expression of the membrane-bound kit ligand (mbKitL) depends on IL-3, and it is crucial for adhesion of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and inflammatory cells to TECs. These events required Akt activation. Finally, the finding that depletion of the mbKitL prevented EPC and inflammatory cell trafficking into vascular microenvironment, indicates that, as in bone marrow, the mbKitL can act as a membrane/adhesion molecule for c-Kit-expressing cells. These data provide evidences that an IL-3 autocrine loop can drive a tumor endothelial switch and that targeting IL-3 might confer a significant therapeutic advantage to hamper tumor angiogenesis.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Mesenchymal tumors of the appendix are very rare, and specific stromal tumors (i.e., gastrointestinal stromal tumors, GISTs) have not been reported in this location to date. Four GISTs were identified in the review of primary mesenchymal tumors of the appendix from the files of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology from 1970 to 1998. There were also one benign schwannoma, one diffuse neurofibroma with neurofibromatosis 1, one leiomyosarcoma in a child with HIV infection, and one inflammatory fibroid polyp. The four appendiceal GISTs occurred in adult males 56-72 years of age (mean 63 years). Two tumors occurred in patients who had surgery for appendicitis-like symptoms: one was an incidental finding during surgery for a malignant gastric epithelioid GIST and one was an incidental autopsy finding. Only one of the two appendices operated for symptoms had acute inflammation, and a polypoid GIST projected outward from the proximal part of appendix. Three tumors were partially obliterating nodules, eccentrically expanding the appendiceal wall. All four were spindle cell tumors, and three of them contained extracellular collagen globules (skeinoid fibers); none had atypia or mitotic activity (<1/50 high power fields). Immunohistochemically, two tumors studied were positive for CD117 (KIT), and two were positive for CD34. The tumors were negative for alpha-smooth muscle actin and S-100 protein. Follow-up revealed death from cardiovascular disease in one case (4 years after appendectomy) and liver failure because of malignant gastric epithelioid GIST metastatic to liver in another case 15 years after the appendectomy. This report documents the rare occurrence of CD117-positive GISTs as primary appendiceal tumors.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Appendiceal mucinous neoplasms have been the focus of considerable debate in recent years. We histologically classified 70 appendiceal mucinous neoplasms into three categories: 32 mucinous adenoma, 23 mucinous neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential, and 15 mucinous adenocarcinomas. Immunohistochemistry was performed for 24 proteins in different functional categories, specifically, oncogenic proteins (bcl-2, beta-catenin, CEA, C-erbB2, c-kit, Cox-2, Cyclin D1, EGFR, Ki-67, NF-kappaB, VEGF), tumor suppressors (E-cadherin, FHIT, hMLH1, p53, p63, smad4), cell-cycle regulators (p21, p27, p16), and mucin proteins (MUC1, MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC6). Our data showed that 9 out of the 24 proteins were more frequently altered in the mucinous adenocarcinoma group than in the mucinous adenoma group (P<0.05), including beta-catenin (13% in mucinous adenoma vs 60% in mucinous adenocarcinoma), CyclinD1 (44 vs 87%), Ki-67 (high labeling index: 31 vs 67%), NF-kappaB (19 vs 60%), VEGF (16 vs 87%), E-cadherin (0 vs 47%), p53 (6 vs 40%), MUC2 (9 vs 67%), and MUC5AC (3 vs 40%). The distinct immunoexpression profile of mucinous neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential was placed between those of mucinous adenoma and mucinous adenocarcinoma (P<0.05). Moreover, the mucinous adenoma, mucinous neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential, and mucinous adenocarcinoma categories displayed differences in terms of the number of altered markers among the nine proteins (P<0.05; mean 1.4 vs 2.6 vs 5.5, respectively). In mucinous adenocarcinoma, the p53 status was related to disease-free survival and overall survival of patients (P<0.05, both). NF-kappaB status and the number of altered protein markers made statistically marginal impacts on disease-free survival; also beta-catenin loss, on overall survival of patients. In conclusion, protein immunoexpression profiles may facilitate the classification of appendiceal mucinous neoplasms. In our study, the three tumor categories of mucinous adenoma, mucinous neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential, and mucinous adenocarcinoma exhibited distinct immunoexpression profiles. Five and more altered protein markers, p53 overexpression, NF-kappaB positivity, and beta-catenin loss were predictive factors of adverse clinical outcomes in appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinomas.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Chemically modified tetracyclines are a group of non-antimicrobial tetracycline derivatives, which possess antiinflammatory, anticollagenolytic and antiproliferative properties. Here we studied the effects of four different chemically modified tetracyclines (CMT-1, CMT-3, CMT-8 and CMT-308) on proliferation and viability of cultured mouse and human mast cells. All studied CMTs (25 microM) effectively inhibited the viability and proliferation of human mast cell line (HMC-1) cells and mouse bone marrow derived mast cells (mBMMCs), as judged by trypan blue exclusion and by incorporation of [(3)H]thymidine. The antiproliferative effect of CMTs was not dependent on the stimulating growth factor, i.e. CMTs inhibited both IL-3 and c-kit ligand-induced proliferation of mBMMCs. The reduced viability of mast cells was due to induction of apoptosis, as indicated by the increased amount of apoptotic nucleosomes and the appearance of TUNEL positive cells in the presence of CMTs. The induction of apoptosis was further confirmed by showing that CMT-3 induces activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 in HMC-1 cells. Additionally, CMT-3 induced downregulation of the expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein in HMC-1 cells. Compared to doxycycline, the antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of different CMTs were clearly more pronounced. Of the studied CMTs, CMT-3 and CMT-8 appeared to be the most potent inhibitors of mast cell proliferation and survival. The present results show that CMTs have an antiproliferative and proapoptotic effect on both malignant and non-malignant mast cells. In conclusion, CMTs could offer a novel means to treat disorders with inappropriate expansion of mast cells, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic mast cell diseases.",
