Significantly elevated sialic acid concentrations were found in the melanoma patients (p less than 0.005), and levels tended to be greater in those with a large tumor burden (p less than 0.05).

To evaluate whether serum IL-6 is a useful disease marker in metastatic malignant melanoma (MMM), we studied the time course of endogenous IL-6 secretion in 41 patients treated with cisplatinum, IL-2, and IFN-alpha. Furthermore, the relationship of endogenous IL-6 concentrations to the tumor burden and/or the clinical response was also evaluated. The baseline serum IL-6 levels were significantly higher in patients with MMM than in the control group (P = 0.002). When tumor burden was taken into consideration, we found that IL-6 levels were higher in patients with high tumor burden than in patients with low tumor burden. During treatment in the whole patient population, a higher serum IL-6 level was observed in nonresponding as compared to responding patients at days 7 (P = 0.0005), 21 (P = 0.002), and 35 (P = 0.009). The follow-up of serum IL-6 in patients with MMM according to the tumor burden and clinical response demonstrated that: (a) IL-6 levels were significantly higher at days 7 and 21 in patients with high tumor burden as compared to those with low tumor burden; and (b) IL-6 levels remain significantly higher in nonresponding patients as compared to responding patients regardless of the tumor burden. From these results, we can conclude that endogenous IL-6 may play a role in the failure of IL-2 therapy in such patients, since the very early IL-6 increase is correlated with the tumor mass and nonresponse to biochemotherapy. Therefore, it seems that the early detection of endogenous IL-6 may represent valuable information for monitoring the response to biochemotherapy in patients with MMM.",

The pathway and prognosis of strong pigmentation of melanoma metastases in the SN is unclear. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of pigmentation and growth pattern of metastases in the SN with respect to survival. A total of 389 patients underwent an SN procedure (1997-2011). Ninety-five patients had a positive SN and material from 75 patients was available for review. The median follow-up time was 75 months (range 6-164). Pigmentation was scored from 0 to 2 using the following scale: 0=absent, 1=slight, and 2=strong. Growth pattern was scored as either eccentric (1) or infiltrative (2). SN tumor burden was measured according to the Rotterdam criteria. The primary melanoma had a median Breslow thickness of 2.90 mm (0.8-12.00 mm). Ulceration was present in 34 patients (45.3%). There was a median SN tumor burden of 0.5 mm (0.05-7.00 mm). In a total of 75 patients, 59 patients (79%) had no pigmentation, 13 patients (17%) had slight pigmentation, and three patients (4%) had strong pigmentation in the SN. Because of the small numbers, the classification was modified to either absent 59 (79%) or present 16 (21%) pigmentation, respectively. The SN tumor burden was significantly higher (P=0.031) for patients with pigmentation. Patients with pigmentation had a 5-year melanoma-specific survival (MSS) of 47% and a 10-year MSS of 33%. Patients without pigmentation had a 5-year MSS of 70% and a 10-year MSS of 59% (P=0.06). There was no difference in MSS for patients with an eccentric or an infiltrative growth pattern, nor did it correlate with other prognostic factors. Multivariate analysis for MSS showed five significant factors associated with worse prognosis: male sex (P=0.036), nodular melanoma (P=0.001), truncal site (P=0.0001), SN tumor burden more than 1.0 mm (P=0.022), and positive completion lymph node dissection (P=0.004). The 5-year MSS for SN tumor burden is 94% for 0.1 mm or less, 66% for 0.1-1.0 mm, and 41% for more than >1.0 mm (P<0.001). The 10-year MSS for SN tumor burden is, respectively, 94, 51, and 35% (P<0.001). This preliminary exploratory retrospective study showed that pigmentation within the SN seems to correlate with increased SN tumor burden. ",

In our patients, median sEGF-R level was significantly elevated (P < 0.0001) compared with that of healthy controls (173.4 vs. 91.9 fm/ml). Age or sex was not associated with sEGF-R levels. Regarding tumor burden, in contrary to the detected IL-6 levels, we found that median sEGF-R levels were significantly (P = 0.045) lower in patients with high tumor burden (163 fm/ml) than in those with low tumor burden (193.8 fm/ml). An inverse correlation between IL-6 levels and sEGF-R was observed (r =-0.33; P = 0.040). No relationship between sEGF-R and time to progression or overall survival was observed while circulating IL-6 was found as a predictive factor of survival. Our results showed that sEGF-R level was elevated in metastatic malignant melanoma patients but not related to time to progression or survival and demonstrated an inverse correlation between sEGF-R and IL-6 levels.

The goal of this study is to examine the relationship between melanoma SLN tumor burden and the degree of SLN immune dysfunction as a model to study tumor-induced immune dysfunction. We hypothesize that SLN tumor burden correlates with the degree of SLN immune dysfunction.;Patients undergoing SLN biopsy for clinical stages I and II melanomas were enrolled in the study under an IRB-approved protocol. During the SLN biopsy, non-hot and non-blue portion of the SLN was harvested, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and mRNA was extracted. By using quantitative real-time PCR, gene expressions of cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, IFNγ, TGFβ, GM-CSF) and the surrogates of immunosuppressive regulatory and effector cells (IDO-expressing DCs and Foxp3-expressing T-regs, respectively) were measured and correlated against the SLN tumor burden (MART1) and against each other. The data were log transformed for normalization. Statistical test used Student's t-test and stepwise multivariate regression analysis. Statistical significance was determined at P < 0.05.;SLNs of 74 patients were analyzed in this analysis. Ten of seventy-four patients (13.5%) had tumor-positive SLNs. MART1 gene expression showed a significant difference between the SLN (+) and SLN (-) groups (P = 0.04). Among the various cytokines, multivariate analysis showed that only IFNγ gene expression correlated independently with MART1 gene expression (P < 0.0001, r = 0.91). Similar multivariate analyses show that IFNγ (P < 0.0001, r = 0.78), IL-10 (P = 0.0037, r = 0.60), and TGFβ (P < 0.0001, r = 0.95) gene expressions correlated independently with IDO gene expression. IFNγ (P < 0.0001, r = 0.87) and GM-CSF (P = 0.042, r = 0.76) gene expressions correlated independently with Foxp3 gene expression. MART1 gene expression showed independent correlation with IDO (P = 0.0002, r = 0.75) and Foxp3 (P = 0.0002, r = 0.75) gene expressions.;SLN tumor burden correlates with immunosuppressive IDO and Foxp3 expressions within the SLNs of melanoma patients. Our data are consistent with our theory that melanoma induces expressions of specific cytokines, which in turn, stimulate immune suppressors within the SLN. This study also supports our previous finding that IL-10 and IFNγ co-regulate IDO within the SLN. In our data, IFNγ is the sole cytokine that correlates with the SLN tumor burden and seems to play a central role in tumor-induced immunological changes in the SLN immune microenvironment.",

We included only patients who had their nodal dissections performed at our institute. Patients who underwent sentinel lymph node dissection were excluded. These patients were then analyzed as a group and by individual lymphatic basins: cervical, axillary, and inguinal basins. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to examine the model that included tumor burden, thickness of the primary melanoma, gender, age, clinical status of the lymph nodes (palpable versus not palpable), and the primary site. The survival and recurrence rates were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model.;Five hundred forty-eight patients underwent regional lymph node dissections. Of these patients, 214 underwent axillary dissections, 181 inguinal dissections, and 153 cervical dissections. The extent of the nodal dissections was based on the quartile of nodes excised, ranging from 1 to 98 (mean +/- SD = 25.8 +/- 15.8). Patients were stratified by tumor burden and quartile of number of lymph nodes removed. The overall 5-year survival of patients with four or more lymph nodes having tumor and the highest quartile of lymph nodes removed was 44% and was 23% for the lowest quartile of total lymph nodes excised (p = 0.05). By univariate analysis, tumor burden (p = 0.0001), quartile of total lymph nodes removed (p = 0.043), and primary site (p = 0.047) were statistically significant for predicting overall survival. Gender, clinical status of the nodes, primary tumor thickness, age, and dissected basin were not significant (p > 0.05). By multivariate analysis only the tumor burden (p = 0.0001) and quartile of lymph nodes resected (p = 0.044) were statistically significant.;The extent of lymph node dissection for melanoma when analyzed by quartiles is an independent factor in overall survival. This factor appears to be more important with increasing tumor burden in the lymphatic basin.

As shown by univariate analysis, elevated serum levels of VEGF (P = .0001 and .0036), bFGF (P < .00005 and < .00005), and IL-8 (P < .00005 and < .00005) were strongly correlated with a poor overall and progression-free survival, respectively.

Tumor burden (P = .0081), VEGF (P = .0245), and IL-8 (P = .0089) were found as independent predictive factors of progression-free survival.;Our data suggest that the angiogenic serum factors VEGF, bFGF, and IL-8 are useful predictive markers for overall and progression-free survival in melanoma patients.",

The antigen is also expressed by tumor cells in vivo. Melanoma and nevus cells, but not normal melanocytes, were specifically stained by the immunoperoxidase procedure. The proteoglycan antigen, purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using a monoclonal antibody that specifically detects this antigen, was used to immunize rabbits. The resulting serum was tested by sequential immunoprecipitation and found to react with the same population of molecules detected by the anti-proteoglycan monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, the reactivity patterns of the rabbit serum and of the monoclonal antibodies with a variety of tumor and normal cells were the same. Based on the these data, we conclude that the entire proteoglycan molecule is a melanoma-associated antigen. The monoclonal antibodies and immunoglobulin from the rabbit serum were tested in a double determinant immunoassay for the detection of antigen in a total of 339 sera from patients with various diseases. Elevated levels of circulating proteoglycan antigen were found in 76% of patients with a high metastatic melanoma tumor burden compared to 2% of healthy donors. A fraction (22%) of patients with light tumor burden or nonmelanoma neoplastic disease also had elevated levels of circulating proteoglycan antigen.

(2) Mitotic rate replaces level of invasion as a primary criterion for defining T1b melanomas. (3) Among the 3,307 patients with regional metastases, components that defined the N category were the number of metastatic nodes, tumor burden, and ulceration of the primary melanoma.

Micrometastases detected by immunohistochemistry are specifically included. (5) On the basis of a multivariate analysis of patients with distant metastases, the two dominant components in defining the M category continue to be the site of distant metastases (nonvisceral v lung v all other visceral metastatic sites) and an elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level.;Using an evidence-based approach, revisions to the AJCC melanoma staging system have been made that reflect our improved understanding of this disease.

In addition, these matured DC demonstrated enhanced ability to stimulate antigen specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in vitro. In a protection model, C57BL/6 mice vaccinated with either antigen-pulsed immature or CpG matured DC were unable to reject a lethal B16 melanoma challenge. In contrast, long-term protection was achieved in mice vaccinated with both CpG and antigen-pulsed DC, which correlated with an enhanced antigen specific T cell immune response. In a therapeutic model of established subcutaneous B16 melanoma, C57BL/6 mice treated intratumorally with CpG and B16 lysate-pulsed DC demonstrated a reduced tumor burden and prolonged survival. In a similar model of established subcutaneous tumor, mice treated with CpG-matured DC pulsed with a melanoma peptide, TRP-2, alone were unable to achieve tumor regression. Conversely, mice that received the combined vaccine of CpG and peptide-pulsed DC displayed a reduced tumor burden.

The antigen concentrations in sera from patients with multiple metastases of other tumors were within the range of controls. Several sera from patients with multiple metastases of colon, pancreatic, and stomach carcinoma, however, contained increased antigen concentrations (45-80 U/ml). These results correspond with the reactions of NKI/C-3 in tissue sections of some malignancies other than melanoma.

In the present study, the efficacy of MK-0429, a selective inhibitor of the αvβ3 integrin, was evaluated for its potential in the prevention of melanoma metastasis. Female B6D2F1 mice injected via the tail vein with murine B16F10 melanoma developed lung metastases within ~10 days. In the first experiment, the prevention of lung metastasis was assessed in the model treated with either vehicle, MK-0429 at 100 and 300 mg/kg orally twice daily or cyclophosphamide at 300 mg/kg, i.p. once daily. Study endpoints included determination of the study time period to achieve metastasis in lungs in this model, evaluation of the health effects on the study animals, the total number of lung colonies identified and lung tumor area. Unlike cyclophosphamide, the MK-0429 treatment did not lead to a significant weight reduction in mice. MK-0429 at 100 and 300 mg/kg reduced the number of metastatic tumor colonies by 64 and 57%, respectively, and the high dose also reduced the tumor area by 60% as compared to the vehicle. The second experiment employed B16F10 luciferase-expressing cells to examine the de novo progression of melanoma metastasis over 15 days with bioluminescent imaging of mice treated with MK-0429 at 300 mg/kg as compared to the vehicle. Tumor burden progressively advanced in the lungs of the B16F10-treated animals. However, MK-0429 reduced the progression of ventral and dorsal lung metastases by 22 and 38%, respectively, as compared to the vehicle, by study completion. Quantification of ex vivo tumor burden showed a 30-40% reduction in lung colonies by MK-0429. The two studies collectively demonstrated that MK-0429 was safe and efficacious in significantly decreasing melanoma metastasis in the lungs.

        "Doc_abstract":"Brain metastasis represents the most common intracranial neoplasm in adult patients. Melanoma is the third most frequent cancer histology and consequently comprises a significant portion of brain metastasis patients. Unlike the more frequent lung and breast cancers, melanoma represents a particularly challenging entity because of its radioresistant nature. Stereotactic radiosurgery appears to overcome the inherent radioresistance of brain metastasis from melanoma and, thereby, affords a high rate of local tumor control. Reports from leading centers indicate a favorable benefit to risk profile for radiosurgery in melanoma patients. Local tumor control after radiosurgery generally exceeds 80%, and neurological complications as a result of radiosurgery are infrequent. A higher performance status and lower intracranial tumor burden in melanoma patients at the time of radiosurgery are associated with longer survival. Radiosurgery may be used in conjunction upfront with radiotherapy, resection, and chemotherapy or as a salvage therapy in selected melanoma patients. Careful radiological and neurological follow-up is required to assess local tumor control and distant intracranial disease progression. Further clinical studies will be required to better define the role of upfront and salvage radiosurgery in selected cohorts of patients with brain metastasis from melanoma. However, it appears likely that radiosurgery will play an expanded role in the overall management of these patients.",

Thus, the search for reliable methods to identify patients with high risk of disease progression as early as possible is of major importance. In our study, we analyzed the predictive value of soluble HLA-DR (sHLA-DR) in comparison to S100-beta in serum from 183 melanoma patients of different stages of disease and with or without current therapy using immunosorbent assays. sHLA-DR serum levels of 121 healthy individuals served as controls. We found significantly (p < 0.0005) reduced sHLA-DR serum levels in melanoma patients (0.70 +/- 0.08 SEM microg/ml) compared to controls (1.49 +/- 0.10 SEM microg/ml). Reduced sHLA-DR and increased S100-beta levels were associated with advanced disease stages and tumor load. S100-beta was increased under cytostatic therapy (p < 0.0005), whereas sHLA-DR was not influenced by therapy modalities. Univariate analysis showed an association of sHLA-DR < 0.3 microg/ml and S100-beta > 0.12 microg/l with poor overall (p = 0.021 and p = 0.0009) and progression-free survival (p < 0.0005 and p = 0.0025).

In contrast to S100-beta, sHLA-DR serum concentrations < 0.3 microg/ml were strongly associated (p = 0.0001) with poor progression-free survival in a subgroup of 60 nonmetastasized patients.

Tyrosinase-related protein 2 (TRP-2) is a melanogenic enzyme expressed by both melanocytes and melanomas that is reported to be a candidate melanoma rejection antigen. To study the role of self-reactive CD8+ T cells in tumor immunity and autoimmunity, we generated mice that bear a T-cell receptor transgene (TCR Tg) specific for the TRP-2(180-188) epitope. TRP-2 TCR Tg mice did not spontaneously develop depigmentation despite systemic expression of TRP-2 in the skin. Peripheral T cells from these TCR Tg mice exhibited a naive phenotype and proliferated in response to TRP-2 in vitro. In addition, transfer of in vitro-activated Tg T cells reduced B16 pulmonary tumor burden, but not subcutaneous tumors. We next sought to determine the in vivo responses of the Tg T cells to endogenous and tumor-derived TRP-2. Adoptive transfer of naive TCR Tg T cells into wild-type C57BL/6 mice, in combination with a TRP-2-pulsed dendritic cell vaccine, induced proliferation of the Tg T cells and resulted in migration of the Tg T cells into a subcutaneous B16 melanoma tumor. Although these tumor-infiltrating Tg T cells remained reactive against TRP-2, they did not reduce growth of the primary subcutaneous tumor; similarly, these in vivo-primed effector cells had no significant effect on the growth of pulmonary nodules. These data demonstrate that despite in vivo priming, tumor-infiltrating T cells may fail to reduce tumor burden. Determining the basis for the inability of the tumor microenvironment to sustain effective antitumor responses will be critical for designing newer, more potent antitumor immunotherapies.",

Forty patients with advanced disseminated malignant melanoma are available for response. Complete remissions were obtained in three patients (8%) and partial remissions in 12 patients (30%). The total response rate was 38%. Median response duration was 4 months. Toxicity was unacceptable in five cases (nephrotoxicity, one patient; ototoxicity, two patients; hypotonia, one patient; gastrointestinal toxicity, one patient). The conclusion is that the combination dacarbazine-vindesine-cisplatin gives rise to a high response rate in patients with advanced disseminated malignant melanoma.

Cysteine proteases contribute to invasive properties of many cancer cell types. To analyze the contribution of cysteine proteases to metastasis we have over-expressed in B16 melanoma cells the natural cysteine protease inhibitor, cystatin C. We measured in vitro invasion of cystatin over-expression clones with Boyden chamber type assays. Tail-vein injections of cells were used to compare lung tumor colonization. Subcutaneous tumor growth and tumor cell metastasis from primary tumors were also analyzed. Apoptosis of tumor cells was measured in lung tissues following melanoma cell injection. RESULTS: Results show the in vitro invasion of cystatin C over-expressing cells was dramatically inhibited. Lung tumor colonization was also reduced. Increased tumor cell apoptosis was found to be an important factor and may be related to the reduced tumor burden noted in this system of melanoma metastasis. CONCLUSION: Cysteine proteases therefore, may be a target for future anti-metastatic therapies.",

The main objective of our work was to investigate the relationship between mutant BRAF DNA in plasma and clinical response. Thirty-eight stage IV patients with a V600 mutated BRAF melanoma were included prior to any treatment. DNA was extracted from plasma and mutant DNA was detected using the amplification-refractory mutation system method. Before the beginning of any treatment, the corresponding BRAF mutation was detected in 29 of the 38 tested plasma samples (76.3% positive per cent agreement). We observed a strong correlation between the presence of circulating mutated DNA and overall survival (OS; P=.02), and with the number of metastatic sites (P=.01). The presence of circulating mutated DNA was also strongly correlated with serum LDH activity (P<.01) and S100 protein concentration (P<.01). Finally, seven patients presented discordant BRAF status in different tumor sites. In all these patients, the test performed on ctDNA was positive, suggesting that ctDNA analysis might be less sensitive to tumor heterogeneity. Altogether, these results suggest that plasmatic mutant BRAF DNA is a prognostic factor of OS, correlated with tumor burden. In addition, it represents an interesting alternative source of DNA to detect BRAF mutations before treatment. ",

So far, almost without exception, clinical trials conducted with single or multiple agent chemotherapy, biological therapy (interferon-alpha, interleukin-2), and biochemotherapy have failed to demonstrate consistent survival benefit. Without effective alternate treatments, surgery must be considered the primary treatment of melanoma, independent of disease stage. Although surgery is clearly favored as the treatment of localized melanoma, consensus opinion and clinician preference become divided once melanoma progresses beyond its primary site. Many physicians will adopt an attitude of resignation and hesitancy when treating metastatic melanoma. As a result, patients with advanced disease are often treated with medications that produce little survival or palliative benefit at the expense of significant toxicity.

We evaluated the therapeutic effect of each vector alone and in combination for efficacy in C57BL/6 mice with preestablished (2 d) B16 melanoma-derived pulmonary metastases, using the number of lung metastases as the efficacy parameter. Intraperitoneal administration of Adgp75 (10(8) PFU) reduced tumor burden to 45 +/- 7% of controls (P < 0.01), and AdIL12 administration (10(8) PFU, intraperitoneally) reduced the number of metastases to 43 +/- 7% of controls (P < 0.01). The combination of Adgp75 (10(8) PFU, intraperitoneally) and AdIL12 (10(8) PFU, intraperitoneally) provided further protection (15 +/- 3%; P < 0.01 as compared with naive control; P < 0.01 compared with Adgp75 or AdIL12 alone). Mice receiving AdIL12 showed increased natural killer cell (NK cell) function in an in vitro cytotoxicity assay, with a dose- dependent lysis of YAC-1 cells and, to a lesser extent, lysis of B16 cells. To assess the relative contribution of major histocompatibility complex I (MHC I) Dependent and Independent activity in combination therapy with Adgp75 plus AdIL12, we performed adoptive transfer experiments, using splenocytes from mice receiving Adgp75, AdIL12, or Adgp75 + AdIL12, from among which NK cells had been selectively depleted in vitro prior to adoptive transfer. Each group showed significant decreases in tumor burden resembling those with primary treatment. Interestingly, NK-cell depletion from among cells derived from the Adgp75- and AdIL12-treated mice significantly altered the therapeutic response (P < 0.01 compared with the Adgp75 + AdIL12 group), suggesting a significant role of NK-cell-mediated cytolysis in vivo, although there was still a significantly reduced tumor burden (P < 0.01 compared with that of naive controls). Collectively, these data support the concept that the combination of AdIL12 and Adgp75 provides additive effects against pulmonary metastases of B16 melanoma by MHC-independent (NK cell) means as well as MHC-dependent cytotoxic lymphocyte means, suggesting that this therapy may be a useful adjuvant in the treatment of metastatic melanoma.",

An additional study of antigenic modulation was performed in 23 nonanergic and seven anergic melanoma patients, tested simultaneously with melanoma TAA prepared from primary and metastatic tumors, which had been obtained from one patient at different time periods. The results of pilot clinical trials are reported, including toxicity, timing and dosage studies in 20 patients and subsequent studies of patients with metastatic melanoma treated at three separate centers, using a single lot of purified, allogeneic melanoma TAA. The results of these latter studies in 51 patients with Stage III (distantly metastatic) melanoma and in five patients with earlier stages of disease indicate that: (1) when the interval from primary therapy to recurrence is greater than one year and when liver, bone and brain are not involved, partial or total clinical regression may be noted in up to 25% of patients with metastatic disease receiving immunochemotherapy; (2) when total regression does occur, the effect usually lasts from one to three years; (3) cytoreductive (debulking) surgery, when possible, in cutaneous, nodal retroperitoneal, and visceral regions may enhance the response to specific active immunochemotherapy, although some debulked patients had less tumor burden and this factor alone may lead to an improved prognosis in patients undergoing any subsequent treatment; (4) when circulating inhibitory factors are modified through preimmunization chemotherapy, an enhanced host response may be seen; and (5) Cancer Serum Indices (CSI) may be useful in predicting recurrence and in following tumor load and response to therapy. Information obtained from these studies suggest the need for further trials to determine the effect of immunization on patients with earlier stages of disease where recurrence rates remain high, and to evaluate the mechanisms of tumor rejection or tumor progression in the face of immune stimulation.",

In this context of limited response to single target agents, novel candidate molecules capable of effectively inducing tumor inhibition along with targeting multiple critical nodes of melanoma signaling assume translational significance. In this regard, we investigated the anti-cancer effects of a novel dichlorophenyl urea compound called COH-SR4 in melanoma. The SR4 treatment decreased the survival and inhibited the clonogenic potential of melanomas along with inducing apoptosis in vitro cultures. SR4 treatments lead to inhibition of GST activity along with causing G2/M phase cell cycle arrest. Oral administration of 4 mg/kg SR4 leads to effective inhibition of tumor burdens in both syngeneic and nude mouse models of melanoma. The SR4 treatment was well tolerated and no overt toxicity was observed. The histopathological examination of resected tumor sections revealed decreased blood vessels, decrease in the levels of angiogenesis marker, CD31, and proliferation marker, Ki67, along with an increase in pAMPK levels. Western blot analyses of resected tumor lysates revealed increased PARP cleavage, Bim, pAMPK along with decreased pAkt, vimentin, fibronectin, CDK4 and cyclin B1.

Unlike in the case of the lymph nodes, peripheral blood or bone marrow do not contain melanocytes excluding the possibility of fals positive reactions. Considering the pronounced heterogeneity of melanoma cells the most reliable molecular marker is the expression of tyrosinase. Several studies indicate that the quantity of circulating melanoma cells correlates with tumor burden and disease progression and reflects the effect of therapy. On the other hand, molecular techniques detect circulating melanoma cells much more frequently than the clinical manifestation of the disease progression (molecular recurrence), questioning the clinical significance of the detection of a small number of melanoma cells in the circulation.

While exoresection is more applicable to anteriorly located tumors with ciliary body and/or iris involvement, endoresection is more suitable for posteriorly located tumor without ciliary body involvement. Both approaches are suitable for large tumors with >8 mm in thickness. In general, eyes containing these large tumors have a very dismal prognosis regarding long-term visual function, eye retention, and irradiation-induced side effects. By removing the tumor burden from the eye, histopathologic and cytogenetic information of the tumor is available and complications associated with the so-called toxic tumor syndrome are avoided.

The mutational burden of melanoma patients is an order of magnitude higher than of other TCGA cohorts. A multi-step filter enriched somatic mutations while accounting for recurrence, conservation, and basal rate. Thus, this filter can serve as a paradigm for analysis of genome-wide next-generation sequencing data of large cohorts with a high mutational burden. Analysis of TCGA melanoma data using such a multi-step filter discovered novel and statistically significant potential melanoma driver genes. In the context of the Pan-Cancer study we report a detailed analysis of the mutational landscape of BRAF and other drivers across cancer tissues.

Because 80% of CLNDs yield no additional positive nodes and there is no proof that CLND leads to survival improvement, criteria are needed to limit this procedure to those most likely to harbor nonsentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases.;A retrospective review of 349 cases of melanoma from January 1999 to April 2007 that underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy at a single institution was done. Statistical analysis was used to compare two subgroups of patients: a positive CLND group and a negative CLND group. These two groups were compared with regards to multiple variables related to patient demographics, primary tumor characteristics, and SLN tumor burden.;Age and total size of SLN tumor deposit were the factors with the strongest correlation with CLND positivity. By applying a risk score model that uses the cutoff values of age 55 y and SLN tumor deposit of 5 mm, it is possible to predict CLND positivity in SLN-positive melanoma patients.;The likelihood of CLND positivity in SLN-positive melanoma patients can be predicted from two criteria readily available: size of SLN tumor deposit and patient age.",

Previously we have shown that Coxsackievirus A21 (CVA21) lytically infects in vitro cultures of malignant melanoma cells and is efficient at reducing the tumor burden of mice bearing slow-growing SK-Mel-28 melanoma xenografts. The oncolytic activity of CVA21 against in vivo melanoma xenografts, which possess rapid growth rates and more extensive vascular structure than SK-Mel-28 xenografts warrants further investigation. In the present study we evaluated the oncolytic action of CVA21 against rapidly growing melanoma xenografts (ME4405) which exhibit a highly vascular phenotype. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that in vitro cultures of ME4405 cells expressed comparable levels of the CVA21 cellular receptors, ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecules-1) and DAF (decay accelerating factor) to SK-Mel-28 cells. Despite similar levels of CVA21 receptor expression, SK-Mel-28 cells appear to be more susceptible to viral lysis than ME4405 cells, even though the kinetics of virus replication in both lines was comparable. Intratumoral, intraperitoneal or intravenous administration of CVA21 were equally effective in reducing the tumor volume of ME4405 xenografts in immunodeficient mice, and provides further evidence for the use of CVA21 as a novel oncolytic agent against varying phenotypes of malignant melanoma.",

On the basis of previous expression studies, we aimed to trace melanoma cells in the blood of melanoma patients by RT-PCR of melanoma-inhibitory activity (MIA) mRNA. To detect sensitively MIA transcripts in total RNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we established a sensitive PCR-ELISA system. With this assay, we detected one melanoma cell in 2 ml of blood by a single round of 32 PCR cycles. A total of 295 PBMC samples isolated from 166 patients with melanocytic tumors were tested with the MIA RT-PCR-ELISA: (a) 58 patients (99 samples) with malignant melanomas in stage I; (b) 49 patients (65 samples) with malignant melanomas in stage II; and (c) 47 patients (116 samples) with metastasized melanomas (stages III and IV), with an additional 12 patients (15 samples) with benign melanocytic nevi. Forty-four (26.8%) of 164 samples isolated from patients with melanomas in stages I and II were positive for MIA mRNA; in stages III/IV, 33 (28.4%) of 116 samples of patients, irrespective of clinically evident disease, were positive. Eleven (84.6%) of 13 PBMC samples from patients with metastasized melanoma and clinically evident disease without treatment were MIA mRNA-positive in contrast to only 19 (25.7%) of 74 samples isolated from patients in stage IV with metastasis during chemotherapy. Furthermore, none of the 16 PBMC samples of patients in stage IV without clinically detectable metastases at that time point during chemotherapy was MIA mRNA-positive. Interestingly, of the 44 positive samples (26.8%) isolated from patients with melanomas in stages I and II, 20 were still positive when retested after complete excision of the tumor. Our results reveal that amplification of MIA mRNA from the PBMCs of patients with malignant melanomas by PCR-ELISA provides a useful means to detect tumor cells in the systemic blood circulation. A correlation between positive blood samples and tumor burden in stages III and IV was detected, and, in addition, a significant effect of chemotherapy with respect to the reduction of the number of systemically spread tumor cells was observed. However, MIA amplification seems to be of little value as a surrogate marker for clinical staging or the detection of metastatic disease.",

All three tumors were also analyzed for the presence of BRAF mutations. All three metastatic tumors were negative for S100, Melan A, HMB-45 and Tyrosinase but positive for MITF. Subsequent to the diagnoses, previously existing or concurrent primary melanomas were identified in 2 of the 3 cases. Interestingly, S100, Melan A, and HMB-45 were positive in the primary tumors. No BRAF (V600E) mutations were identified in the three metastatic melanomas and CD 117 (c-kit) was positive in one of the cases.

This approach has proven most beneficial when the diagnosis is of early stage primary lesions. Likewise, patients undergoing resection for a solitary site of metastasis have shown a survival advantage. Identification of metastatic disease depends predominantly on radiographic techniques requiring the presence of significant tumor burdens for successful imaging. However, at that time, the role of surgery and/or biochemotherapy may be of limited value. Techniques to identify minimal disease states may permit more accurate assessment of prognosis. The detection of occult tumor cells by RT-PCR in the blood, lymph nodes, and bone marrow of melanoma patients provides one such approach to monitor tumor progression. Single-marker RT-PCR has been used as one such approach but is noted to have limitations in sensitivity and specificity based on the heterogeneity of tumor marker expression among tumors as well as within an individual tumor lesion or among multiple lesions in individual patients. We employed a multimarker reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay that demonstrates improved sensitivity over a single-marker approach. Currently, the consequences of detecting systemic subclinical metastasis remain unknown pending longer-term follow-up. The detection of occult melanoma cells using molecular techniques in conjunction with known clinicopathologic prognostic factors may provided a novel and efficient approach in monitoring tumor progression and further identify high-risk patients diagnosed early in the disease course.",

Primary uveal melanoma can be cured by surgery or radiotherapy, but the metastatic disease is treatment refractory. To understand comprehensively uveal melanoma genetics, we conducted single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays and whole-genome sequencing on 12 primary uveal melanomas. We observed only approximately 2,000 predicted somatic single-nucleotide variants per tumor and low levels of aneuploidy. We did not observe an ultraviolet radiation DNA damage signature, but identified SF3B1 mutations in three samples and a further 15 mutations in an extension cohort of 105 samples. SF3B1 mutations were associated with good prognosis and were rarely coincident with BAP1 mutations. SF3B1 encodes a component of the spliceosome, and RNA sequencing revealed that SF3B1 mutations were associated with differential alternative splicing of protein coding genes, including ABCC5 and UQCC, and of the long noncoding RNA CRNDE.;Our data show that despite its dismal prognosis, uveal melanoma is a relatively simple genetic disease characterized by recurrent chromosomal losses and gains and a low mutational burden. We show that SF3B1 is recurrently mutated in uveal melanoma, and the mutations are associated with aberrant alternative splicing.",

Thirteen stage I melanoma patients in whom recurrence developed at a distant site exhibited no difference in immune responsiveness when compared to 148 patients in whom recurrence did not develop when both groups were tested with recall antigens. No difference was noted in patients with stage II disease in whom recurrence developed, as measured by reaction to these same antigens. Twelve patients demonstrated anergy to recall antigens, in none of whom has recurrence developed to date. Fifty-six patients who were tested with 2, 4-dinitrochlorobenzene showed no difference in reactivity with tumors classified at any of the Clark-Mihm levels.

Iris melanoma is the least common uveal melanoma and displays a less aggressive clinical course compared with posterior uveal melanoma. To date, no study has been conducted to investigate the T1799A mutation in iris melanoma. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the T1799A BRAF mutation is present in iris melanoma.;DNA was extracted from 19 archival, paraffin-embedded tissue sections of iris melanomas. Nested PCR was used to amplify exon 15 of the BRAF gene, and the product was purified, cloned into a sequencing vector, and sequenced. The sequences obtained were compared with the wild-type sequence of the BRAF gene. The presence or absence of the BRAF mutation was also compared with the clinicopathological features.;The T1799A mutation was identified by sequencing in 9 of 19 iris melanomas. Six of the 9 cases with the BRAF mutation were recurrent tumors. All other tumors were resections for primary tumors. There was a statistically significant association between the BRAF mutation and recurrent tumor (P = 0.003). There was no association between the presence of the BRAF mutation and other clinicopathological characteristics.;In this small study, the T1799A BRAF mutation was identified in almost half of the iris melanoma tissues samples examined. This finding suggests that there may be genetic as well as clinical differences between iris and posterior uveal melanomas.",

Mutated ras genes have been isolated from human melanoma cell lines, but subsequent studies indicated that ras gene mutations may be a rare event in melanocytic lesions. Recently, a study reported a high frequency of ras mutations correlated with increasing invasion level. To address this inconsistency in the published data, we analyzed 50 primary melanomas to correlate invasion level, tumor thickness, histologic typing, and body localization with point mutations around codons 12/13/61 of the three ras genes. After micro-dissection of paraffin-embedded tumor tissue, ras gene mutations were analyzed by direct sequencing of tumor DNA amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Only two melanomas exhibited ras gene mutations, one sample containing a transition from A to G at position 2 of N-ras codon 61 and the other exhibiting a transversion from C to A at position 1 and a transition from A to G at position 2 of N-ras codon 61. Both tumors were classified as Clark level IV, with a tumor thickness of 2.5 and 1.2 mm, respectively. Both were typed as superficial spreading melanoma and localized to intermittently sun-exposed body sites. The low frequency of ras mutations in malignant melanoma and the lack of ras mutations in melanoma samples from constantly sun-exposed body sites argue against the hypothesis of ras mutations as a marker of progression in malignant melanoma and the suggestion that ras mutations occur predominantly in melanomas from constantly sun-exposed body sites.",

In a variety of small mammals, left pneumonectomy (PNX) initiates rapid compensatory hyperplasia of the remnant lung lobes restoring normal tissue mass, structure and function. Post-PNX compensatory lung growth is known to promote lung tumor formation in carcinogen-treated mice. The present study tests the hypothesis that PNX enhances experimental metastasis to lung. C57B1/6 mice subjected to PNX were given an intravenous injection of B16F10 melanoma cells at various stages of compensatory lung growth. Animals injected with B16F10 cells during the linear phase of the response had 77% to 260% more pulmonary metastases than mice subjected to thoracotomy (P < 0.01). Moreover, measurements of tumor area (mm2) revealed that PNX mice harbored a substantially larger lung tumor burden than control animals. Normalization of the tumor cell inoculum to lung mass yielded similar results. PNX had no effect on growth of sub-cutaneous B16F10 melanoma tumors, suggesting that experimental melanoma metastasis was enhanced by local alterations in the lung microenvironment. These results suggest (1) that PNX is a relevant model in which to investigate mechanisms of local cancer recurrence and, (2) melanoma cell metastatic potential is influenced, at least in part, by local factors modified during post-PNX compensatory lung growth.",

Although this sensitivity is 100-times what the human eye can differentiate under the microscope, the new challenge becomes determining the relevance of this low-volume disease in the regional basin, in particular, the sentinel lymph node (SLN). Patients with melanomas greater than 0.75 mm in tumor thickness participated in a research study that examined their SLNs with routine histology, immunhistochemical staining and a RT-PCR assay based on the tyrosinase probe. A total of 311 patients were involved in the study and patients whose SLN were negative from all three assays for metastatic disease had a good survival, with a 92% disease-free survival (DFS) and a 97% overall survival (OS) regardless of the tumor thickness or the ulceration status of the primary melanoma. Patients upstaged with the RT-PCR assay had a significantly decreased DFS and OS compared with patients who were SLN negative. Patients who had enough tumor burden in the SLN that allowed their metastatic disease to be identified with routine histology had a 48% recurrence rate at 5 years. A recently published meta-analysis confirmed that molecular staging of the SLN in melanoma contains important prognostic information.

Here, we used a mouse model of human breast cancer bone metastasis to examine the effects of risedronate and NE-10790, a phosphonocarboxylate analogue of the bisphosphonate risedronate, on osteolysis and tumor growth. Osteolysis was measured by radiography and histomorphometry. Tumor burden was measured by fluorescence imaging and histomorphometry. NE-10790 had a 70-fold lower bone mineral affinity compared with risedronate. It was 7-fold and 8,800-fold less potent than risedronate at reducing, respectively, breast cancer cell viability in vitro and bone loss in ovariectomized animals. We next showed that risedronate given at a low dosage in animals bearing human B02-GFP breast tumors reduced osteolysis by inhibiting bone resorption, whereas therapy with higher doses also inhibited skeletal tumor burden. Conversely, therapy with NE-10790 substantially reduced skeletal tumor growth at a dosage that did not inhibit osteolysis, a higher dosage being able to also reduce bone destruction. The in vivo antitumor activity of NE-10790 was restricted to bone because it did not inhibit the growth of subcutaneous B02-GFP tumor xenografts nor the formation of B16-F10 melanoma lung metastases. Moreover, NE-10790, in combination with risedronate, reduced both osteolysis and skeletal tumor burden, whereas NE-10790 or risedronate alone only decreased either tumor burden or osteolysis, respectively.

Both incidences and deaths associated with melanoma are increasing in Caucasian populations. While exposure to ultraviolet radiation through sun-exposure is the major risk factor; the host factors including skin type and number of moles are critical in predisposition. The CDKN2A is a high penetrance melanoma susceptibility gene as carriers of the mutations are predisposed to the disease within familial settings. The gene is also somatically altered to varying degrees in sporadic melanoma. The CDK4 gene due to occurrence of activation mutations in a few families worldwide represents another melanoma susceptibility locus. The variants within the melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R) gene, which encodes a melanocyte specific surface receptor with a key role in pigmentation, are associated with high risk phenotypes and increased risk of melanoma. Melanoma tumors are characterized by activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway through either autocrine growth factor stimulation or oncogenic mutations in the B-RAF or N-RAS genes. Somatic mutations in the B-RAF gene are complemented by those in the N-RAS gene and represent the major genetic alterations. The mutations in the B-RAF gene in melanoma due to occurrence in melanocytic nevi represent early events that additionally require loss of cell cycle inhibitors like CDKN2A for melanoma progression and development.

Expanded cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) retained in vivo and in vitro functionality, suggesting that melanoma growth did not induce T-cell anergy. The magnitude of suppressed proliferative expansion was proportional to the extent of tumor burden. Melanoma-induced suppression of CTL expansion was correlated with upregulated apoptotic activity and hampered the induction of memory precursor effector cells. Adoptive transfer of resting LCMV antigen-specific T-cells before or after tumor establishment demonstrated that a critical period of in vivo exposure of resting T-cells to growing melanoma was responsible for the induction of suppressed expansion. This suppression was durable; surgical resection of melanoma after in vivo exposure to resting T-cells but before antigenic stimulation did not restore full expansion.;These data suggest that growing melanoma tumors exert a global, antigen-independent influence on resting T-cells that fundamentally reprograms their ability to undergo proliferative expansion in response to subsequent antigenic stimulation.

Similar protocol-dependent results were noted measuring the maximum centripetal tumor depth and the microanatomical location of metastases. By using semiquantitative tumor burden estimates, stage migration was always unidirectional (ie, moving from a lower to higher stage). Stereologic tumor burden estimates in step-sectioned SLNs also varied according to the number of step sections assessed, but could increase, decrease, or remain constant, so that stage migration was multidirectional.;Adding extra steps to pathology protocols when assessing semiquantitative parameters leads to unidirectional stage migration (\"the protocol trap\").

Melanomas with demonstrated activating mutations in KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor A (PDGFRA) may benefit from treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Currently, the limited data regarding KIT mutational status in ocular melanoma suggest that activating mutations are extremely rare. PDGFRA mutational status in ocular melanoma has not been determined. Seventy-five ocular melanomas (53 choroidal, 6 iris, 11 ciliary body, and 5 conjuctival) were selected from the files of the Department of Ophthalmology. High-resolution melting curve analysis and sequencing were performed to detect mutations in KIT exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 and PDGFRA exons 12 and 18. Results of mutational analysis were correlated with anatomical site and KIT (CD117) immunohistochemistry. Eight of 75 (11%) ocular melanomas contained mutations in either the KIT or PDGFRA gene. Five of 53 (9%) choroidal melanomas were associated with mutations (KIT exon 11=3; KIT exon 17=1; PDGFRA intron 18=1). Two of six (33%) iris melanomas and a single (9%) ciliary body melanoma harbored KIT exon 11 mutations. No mutations were identified in conjunctival melanomas. The distribution of KIT and PDGFRA mutations by ocular melanoma anatomical site did not reach statistical significance (P=0.393) CD117 positivity was not predictive of KIT mutational status as only 6 of 58 (10%) CD177-positive tumors harbored KIT mutations. In addition, a KIT exon 17 mutation was identified in one CD117-negative tumor. KIT and PDGFRA mutations do occur in ocular melanomas at a frequency (11%) that is similar to acral and mucosal melanomas. Limited correlation of CD117 positivity with mutational status suggests that all ocular melanomas should undergo mutational analysis to determine if imatinib therapy is appropriate.",

Medical records were reviewed to identify patients who underwent surgical treatment of their liver disease. Clinical and oncologic results were compared to those patients who were managed otherwise. T test, Chi-square test, and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed.;There were 16 patients who underwent surgical treatment (laparoscopic liver resection, n = 2 and laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation, n = 14), compared to 28 patients who received systemic therapy. The groups were similar regarding demographics and size of primary tumor. The interval between diagnoses of primary tumor and liver metastases was longer for the surgical group (58 vs 22 months, respectively, p = 0.010). Although the dominant liver tumor size was similar, the average number of liver tumors was 4 in the surgical group and 10 in the systemic therapy group (p < 0.0001). The median survival after diagnosis of liver metastases was 35 months in the surgical group and 15 months in the systemic therapy group (p ≤ 0.0001).

Combinatorial therapeutic strategies can dramatically increase the anti-tumor response elicited by mAbs.

Combination immunotherapy was more effective than the single therapeutic components in a syngeneic model of GD2-expressing B16 melanoma with minimal tumor burden. NK cell depletion in B6 mice showed that NK cells were required for the anti-tumor effect; however, anti-tumor responses were also observed in tumor-bearing SCID/beige mice.

Median MART-1 and tyrosinase mRNA levels in SNs were significantly different in patients with metastasis compared with patients with BNIs (P < 0.05) and patients without melanocytic lesions (P < 0.001). However, a \"gray-zone\" was observed where distinction, based on mRNA levels, could not be made between the three groups.

A high percentage of tumors had activating mutations in either B-RAF (15/30) or N-RAS (10/30) and only two tumors carried altered PTEN.

Further, inducible expression of p16(INK4a) sensitized a melanoma cell line to death induced by melphalan or actinomycin-D.

We reviewed published literature in PubMed on GIST and melanoma, with a focus on both past and current clinical trials. The data presented centers on imatinib, vemurafenib, and most recently dabrafenib, targeting KIT and BRAF mutations and their outcomes in GIST and melanoma. The BRAF(V600E) melanoma mutation, like the KIT exon 11 mutation in GIST, has the highest response to therapy. High response rates with inhibition of KIT in GIST have not been recapitulated in KIT-mutated melanoma. Median time to resistance to targeted agents occurs in ~7 months with BRAF inhibitors and 2 years for imatinib in GIST. In GIST, the development of secondary mutations leads to resistance; however, there have been no similar gatekeeper mutations found in melanoma. Although surgery remains an important component of the treatment of early GIST and melanoma, surgeons will need to continue to define the thresholds and timing for operation in the setting of metastatic disease with improved targeted therapies.

The following phenothiazines were evaluated: perphenazine, fluphenazine, thioridazine trifluoperazine and chlorpromazine. All agents induced a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability in wild-type and in MDR B16 melanoma cells. Thioridazine displayed the highest antiproliferative activity. Flow cytometric analyses of 24-h treated B16 melanoma cells revealed an increase in fragmented DNA (16.3 vs 71.3% and 87.2% in controls, 25 microM and 50 microM thioridazine-treated, respectively). Apoptosis was confirmed by co-staining of thioridazine-treated B16 cells (12.5 microM) with propidium iodide and Hoechst 33342 reagents. Caspase-3 expression, a typical mediator of apoptosis, was markedly increased following a 4-h exposure of B16 cells to thioridazine (25 microM and 50 microM).

Animals were inoculated with wild-type B16 cells by i.v. injection into the tail vein. Mice were treated with thioridazine (10 and 15 mg/kg x3/week i.p. or 15, and 25 mg/kg/day p.o.) and control animals received saline. Mice were monitored for 21-30 days. Body weight was recorded. After autopsy, the lung weight and number of pulmonary melanoma colonies were determined. Thioridazine administration (i.p. or p.o.) resulted in the reduction of lung tumor burden and an increase in mice survival.

Thirty-six melanomas contained mutations, which in 25 cases (69%) occurred at the 61st codon of N-ras. The results from dot blot hybridizations were confirmed by subcloning and sequencing the polymerase chain reaction products from two tumors. No ras mutations were found in Clark's level I melanomas, whereas 19% of level II and 45% of the more advanced primary tumors contained ras mutations (Chi squared test: p < 0.05). The median Breslow thickness of primary melanomas with ras mutations was 0.72 mm, significantly thicker than the 0.42 mm of melanomas without mutations (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.042). Ras mutations were found more frequently in primary tumors from continuously exposed skin (56%) than tumors from intermittently or non-sun exposed sites (21%).

CMs demonstrated a high burden of somatic single-nucleotide variations (SNVs), with each case containing a TERT promoter (TERT-p) mutation, 13/15 containing an activating BRAF V600 mutation, and >80% of the identified SNVs consistent with UV damage. In contrast, the three CNMs contained an activating NRAS Q61 mutation and no TERT-p mutations. SMs were characterized by chromosomal rearrangements resulting in activated kinase signaling in 40%, and an absence of TERT-p mutations, except for the one SM that succumbed to hematogenous metastasis. We conclude that pediatric CM has a very similar UV-induced mutational spectrum to that found in the adult counterpart, emphasizing the need to promote sun protection practices in early life and to improve access to therapeutic agents being explored in adults in young patients.

Recently, the better results in melanoma treatment were obtained with the mutation-specific inhibitors that have been developed for clinical use and target only patients with particular tumor genotypes. The aim of the study was to characterize the spectrum of \"driver\" mutations in melanoma subtypes from 137 patients with skin melanoma and 14 patients with mucosal melanoma. In total 151 melanoma cases, the frequency of BRAF, NRAS, KIT, PDGFRA, and KRAS mutations was 55.0, 10.6, 4.0, 0.7, and 0.7%, respectively. BRAF mutations were found in 69% of cutaneous melanoma without UV exposure and in 43% of cutaneous melanoma with chronic UV exposure (p=0.045), rarely in acral and mucosal melanomas. Most of melanomas containing BRAF mutations, V600E (92%) and V600K (6.0%) were potentially sensitive to inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib. NRAS mutations were more common in cutaneous melanoma with chronic UV exposure (26.0%), in acral and mucosal melanomas; the dominant mutations being Q61R/K/L (87.5%). KIT mutations were found in cutaneous melanoma with chronic UV exposure (8.7%) and mucosal one (28.6%), but not in acral melanoma. Most of KIT mutations were identified in exon 11; these tumors being sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. This is the first monitoring of BRAF, NRAS, KIT, PDGFRA, and KRAS hotspot mutations in different subtypes of melanoma for Russian population. On the base of data obtained, one can suppose that at the molecular level melanomas are heterogeneous tumors that should be tested for \"driver\" mutations in the each case for evaluation of the potential sensitivity to target therapy.

In this study, efficacy of ethanolic extract of Ruta graveolens (RG) on skin melanoma cells (A375) in vitro and on 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced skin cancer in vivo has been tested in Swiss albino mice.;Studies on cell viability, apoptosis and autophagy induction were conducted in vitro. To check apoptosis, assays like alteration in mitochondrial membrane potential, annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide assay and immunoblot were performed. Fluorescence microscopic and immunoblot assays were performed to confirm autophagy induction. The effects of RG were determined by evaluating body weight, tumor incidence, tumor volume and tumor burden in mice. Enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant status was assessed. The role of some relevant signaling proteins was also analyzed.;RG caused death of A375 cells through induction of caspase 3-mediated apoptosis and Beclin-1-associated autophagy. Moreover, RG administration (75 mg/kg body weight) which showed no acute or chronic toxicity, showed significant reduction in the skin tumor burden of DMBA-painted mice. RG also demonstrated potent anti-lipid peroxidative and antioxidant functions during the course of skin cancer induction by DMBA.;Chemopreventive potential of RG was demonstrated from overall results of this study, indicating its possible use in therapeutic formulation of an effective drug to treat skin cancer.",

If BRAF and NRAS transform melanoma cells by a similar mechanism, then additional genetic aberrations would be similar (or random). Alternatively, distinct mutation-associated changes would suggest the existence of unique cooperating requirements for each mutation group. We first analyzed a panel of 52 melanoma cell lines (n = 35, 11, 6 for BRAF*, NRAS*, and BRAF/NRAS(wt/wt), respectively) by array-based comparative genomic hybridization for unique alterations that associate with each mutation subgroup. Subsequently, those DNA copy number changes that correlated with a mutation subgroup were used to predict the mutation status of an independent panel of 43 tumors (n = 17, 13, 13 for BRAF*, NRAS*, and BRAF/NRAS(wt/wt), respectively). BRAF mutant tumors were classified with a high rate of success (74.4%, P = 0.002), whereas NRAS mutants were not significantly distinguished from wild types (26/43, P = 0.12). Copy number gains of 7q32.1-36.3, 5p15.31, 8q21.11, and 8q24.11 were most strongly associated with BRAF* tumors and cell lines, as were losses of 11q24.2-24.3. BRAF* melanomas appear to be associated with a specific profile of DNA copy number aberrations that is distinct from those found in NRAS* and BRAF/NRAS(wt/wt) tumors. These findings suggest that although both BRAF and NRAS appear to function along the same signal transduction pathway, each may have different requirements for cooperating oncogenic events. The genetic loci that make up this profile may harbor therapeutic targets specific for tumors with BRAF mutations.",

Animals were killed at 2, 4, 6, or 8 weeks after injection. Before euthanatization, 3% FITC-BSA buffer was injected into the retro-orbital plexus of one eye of three mice. Liver tissues were examined by light and fluorescence microscopy, and were stained with human anti-laminin. Vasculogenic mimicry patterns were reconstructed from serial laser scanning confocal microscopic stacks.;OCM1a cells formed microscopic nodules in the mouse liver within 2 weeks after injection and metastasized to the lung 6 weeks later. By contrast, M619 and MUM2B cells formed expansile nodules in the liver within 2 weeks and gave rise to pulmonary metastases within 4 weeks after injection. Vasculogenic mimicry patterns, composed of human laminin and identical with those in human primary and metastatic uveal melanomas, were detected in the animal model.

We review the literature on managing the adverse effects and kinetics of tumor regression with ipilimumab and provide guidelines on their management. During treatment with these antibodies, a unique set of adverse effects may occur, called immune-related adverse events (irAEs). These include rashes, which may rarely progress to life-threatening toxic epidermal necrolysis, and colitis, characterized by a mild to moderate, but occasionally also severe and persistent diarrhea. Hypophysitis, hepatitis, pancreatitis, iridocyclitis, lymphadenopathy, neuropathies, and nephritis have also been reported with ipilimumab. Early recognition of irAEs and initiation of treatment are critical to reduce the risk of sequelae. Interestingly, irAEs correlated with treatment response in some studies. Unique kinetics of response have been observed with CTLA-4 blockade with at least four patterns: (1) response in baseline lesions by week 12, with no new lesions seen; (2) stable disease, followed by a slow, steady decline in total tumor burden; (3) regression of tumor after initial increase in total tumor burden; and (4) reduction in total tumor burden during or after the appearance of new lesion(s) after week 12.

In fact, this was the largest prognostic factors analysis of prospectively followed melanoma patients ever conducted. Important results that shaped the staging criteria involved both the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) criteria and stage grouping for all four stages of melanoma. Major changes in the staging include: (1) melanoma thickness and ulceration are the dominant predictors of survival in patients with localized melanoma (Stages I and II); deeper level of invasion (ie, IV and V) was independently associated with reduced survival only in patients with thin or T1 melanomas. (2) The number of metastatic lymph nodes and the tumor burden were the most dominant predictors of survival in patients with Stage III melanoma; patients with metastatic nodes detected by palpation had a shorter survival compared with patients whose nodal metastases were first detected by sentinel node excision of clinically occult or \"microscopic\" metastases. (3) The site of distant metastases (nonvisceral versus lung versus all other visceral metastatic sites) and the presence of elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were the dominant predictors of outcome in patients with Stage IV or distant metastases. (4) An upstaging was implemented for all patients with Stage I, II, and III disease when a primary melanoma is ulcerated by histopathological criteria.

Although germline mutations and deletions of the p16INK4 gene located at 9p21 have been reported in familial melanoma, the relative contributions of mutation and deletion in sporadic melanoma are at present unclear. In this study, we investigated 26 cases of sporadic cutaneous melanoma (14 of which demonstrated loss of heterozygosity at 9p21) for mutations of p16INK4. One tumor with allelic loss of 9p contained a CC-->TT mutation at codons 57/58, altering an arginine to a stop codon, consistent with bi-allelic inactivation of p16INK4 in this case. No mutations were identified in any of the other melanomas, or in one benign intradermal nevus with atypical features and two Spitz nevi that also showed loss of heterozygosity of 9p. The inactivation of both copies of p16INK4 in the one case of melanoma adds support to the theory that p16INK4 is important in the development of sporadic cutaneous melanoma, although allelic loss or other methods of inactivation of p16INK4 rather than point mutation appears to be numerically more important. The low frequency of mutation of p16INK4 in cases of sporadic melanoma with loss of heterozygosity of 9p is, however, also consistent with there being another tumor suppressor gene near this locus that is involved in some cases of sporadic melanoma.",

Here we show that knock-in mice expressing a Cdk4 R24C allele are highly susceptible to melanoma development after specific carcinogenic treatments. These tumors do not have mutations in the p19(ARF)/p53 pathway, suggesting a specific involvement of the p16(INK4a)/Cdk4/Rb pathway in melanoma development. Moreover, by using targeted mice deficient for other INK4 inhibitors, we show that deletion of p18(INK4c) but not of p15(INK4b) confers proliferative advantage to melanocytic tumor growth.

Splenic lymphocytes from B16MelSAg+NLP treated mice proliferated more rapidly in vitro when stimulated by specific (B16MelSAg) and nonspecific (ConA) stimulators, in comparison to the proliferation detected in B16MelSAg and NLP treated groups. Vaccination of mice with B16MelSAg+NLP more efficiently prevented the growth of B16 melanoma tumor than mice immunized with B16MelSAg or NLP alone. In another experiment, the immune sera (B16MelSAg+NLP) was mixed with B16Mel tumors and injected subcutaneously into syngenic C57BL/6 mice. Tumor burden was less in mice receiving a tumor along with B16MelSAg+NLP generated immune sera than other groups. The B16MelSAg+NLP generated immune sera induced antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity specifically towards B16Mel tumor cells in vitro.

Germline deletions were found in 3 of 93 UK pedigrees, with no previously identified CDKN2A mutations.

Microsatellite analysis determined that these two families were ancestrally related. In the third family, a novel p16 hemizygous deletion involving CDKN2A exons 1alpha, 2, and 3 was detected. An additional 9p21 deletion reported previously in a USA melanoma-neural system tumor family was shown to involve CDKN2A exon 1beta, and not p16.

SIII metastases, defined by a depth of invasion (d) greater than 1 mm below the capsular level, imply a risk of more than 50% for the presence of nonsentinel lymph node metastases in the same basin and for the emergence of distant metastases within 5 years of follow-up. Corresponding risks with SI metastases (d </= 0.3 mm) and SII metastases (0.3 mm < d </= 1 mm) do not exceed 15%. The survival curve for patients with SIII metastases approaches that of patients in the pre-SLNE era who underwent delayed lymph node dissection for subsequently detected nodal macrometastases. The survival of patients with initially removed SI and SII metastases is much better, similar to that of patients with S0 metastases.

Mutational screening of the tumor revealed a number of driver mutations in oncogenes which enabled melanoma classification into a few molecular subtypes. BRAF is a key component of mitogen-activated kinase pathway; its activating mutation leads to accelerated melanoma cells proliferation, invasion and survival. Somatic mutations in BRAF were reported in various malignancies, including thyroid cancer, colorectal cancer and melanoma. Specific features of BRAF-positive tumors could have clinical implications as mutational alterations may have an impact on the biological behavior of the tumor and prognosis of the disease. In the present study, the frequency of BRAF V600E mutation was evaluated in Russian patients with melanocytic lesions, of which 41.25% were primary melanoma and 60% were melanocytic nevi. Melanoma patients with trunk localization were of younger age in the BRAF-positive group as compared with BRAF-negative patients. Immunohistochemical evaluations of Ki-67 expression, as well as matrix metalloproteinase-2, -9, were found to be equal in BRAF-positive and BRAF-negative tumors. MMP-2/MMP-9 immunoreactivity was observed in stromal and/or melanocytic cells both in melanoma and nevi patients. Besides tumor cells, MMP-9 expression was observed in lymphocytes in 27.2% of BRAF-positive and in 19.1% of BRAF-negative patients. Histopathological prognostic markers (Breslow thickness, mitotic index, ulceration, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes pattern) did not show any differences depending on BRAF V600E mutational status. The frequency of BRAF-positive melanomas in Russian cohort is similar to other Caucasian population rates.

It was designed as an exploratory study. The setting was a single-center study in a university hospital. The study was carried out on 27 patients. IHP was used with modifications during three different time periods (IHP I, IHP II and IHP III), in technique and temperature (amount of melphalan: 0.5, 1.0 and 2 mg/kg body weight in the perfusate; 41, 40 and 40 degrees C). Tumor response was estimated according to WHO criteria with computed tomography or MRI. Mortality and morbidity were secondary measures. Six of 11 patients in the IHP I cohort experienced a partial response (PR). In the IHP II cohort, two patients of 11 experienced a complete response and five a PR. In the IHP III cohort, five of five patients experienced a PR. Six postoperative deaths were reported (27%) (three in the IHP I and three in the IHP II series), secondary to liver insufficiency and multiorgan failure. Treatment of liver metastases of malignant melanoma with isolated hyperthermic melphalan perfusion has shown an impressive tumor response rate, which seems to be higher than the response rates reported for other systemic chemotherapy regimens. The maximum tolerated dose for melphalan in the perfusate was surpassed with a 2 mg/kg body weight. By modifying the technique and restricting the allowed tumor burden, the response rate remained high and the mortality was reduced.",

To circumvent the problematic background mutation rates and identify new melanoma driver genes, we carried out a low-copy piggyBac transposon mutagenesis screen in mice. We induced eleven melanomas with mutation burdens that were 100-fold lower relative to human melanomas. Thirty-eight implicated genes, including two known drivers of human melanoma, were classified into three groups based on high, low, or background-level mutation frequencies in human melanomas, and we further explored the functional significance of genes in each group. For two genes overlooked by prevailing discovery methods, we found that loss of membrane associated guanylate kinase, WW and PDZ domain containing 2 and protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type, O cooperated with the v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) recurrent V600E mutation to promote cellular transformation. Moreover, for infrequently mutated genes often disregarded by current methods, we discovered recurrent mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1 (Map3k1)-activating insertions in our screen, mirroring recurrent MAP3K1 up-regulation in human melanomas. Aberrant expression of Map3k1 enabled growth factor-autonomous proliferation and drove BRAF-independent ERK signaling, thus shedding light on alternative means of activating this prominent signaling pathway in melanoma. In summary, our study contributes several previously undescribed genes involved in melanoma and establishes an important proof-of-principle for the utility of the low-copy transposon mutagenesis approach for identifying cancer-driving genes, especially those masked by hypermutation.

Treatments such as the FDA-approved RAF inhibitor vemurafenib and the more recently approved dabrafenib and trametinib combination therapy are designed to target the ERK1/2 pathway. Initial success in targeting this pathway is evidenced by the high percentage of melanoma patients who undergo tumor remission. However, the beneficial effects of these targeted therapies are usually short-lived due to the development of resistance, which leads to disease progression. As a result, studies have focused on the acquired forms of resistance that develop following continued exposure to therapy. Conversely, far fewer studies have investigated the adaptive forms of resistance, which activate rapidly, promote cell survival, and may underlie the development of acquired resistance by providing melanoma cells the time to develop additional mutations. We provide a detailed review of the known mechanisms of adaptive resistance in melanoma and relate them to similar responses to targeted therapies in other tumor types. ",

These poor results may come from treating all melanomas as though they are biologically homogeneous. Recently, it has been shown that targeting specific activated tyrosine kinases (oncogenes) can have striking clinical benefits in patients with melanoma. In 2002, a V600E mutation of the BRAF serine/threonine kinase was described as present in more than 50% of all melanomas. The mutation appeared to confer a dependency by the melanoma cancer cell on activated signaling through mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. The frequency and focality of this mutation (>95% of all BRAF mutations being at V600 position) suggested its importance in melanoma pathophysiology and potential as a target for therapy. The recent results of a phase 1 study with PLX4032/RG7204, a small molecule RAF inhibitor, confirm this hypothesis. Mucosal and acral-lentiginous melanomas, comprising 3% of all melanomas, frequently harbor activating mutations of c-kit and drugs targeting this mutation seem to confer similar benefits for these types of tumors.

A number of methods are currently available to determine mutation status. Recently, a monoclonal antibody (VE1) against mutant BRAF(V600E) was generated. Its use permits assessment of the mutant protein expression throughout a tumor sample and may allow faster and cheaper determination of the mutation status in selected cases. However, for BRAF(V600E) protein expression analysis to be of clinical value, high sensitivity and specificity of the antibody is a prerequisite. In this study we analyzed 44 metastatic melanoma samples with a known BRAF(V600E) mutation status with immunohistochemical expression of the BRAF(V600E) protein. None of the 22 tumors that lacked the BRAF(V600E) mutation labeled with the antibody VE1. This set of VE1-immunonegative tumors included 4 metastatic lesions with the BRAF(V600E) mutation. All 22 tumor samples that were known to carry the BRAF mutation were immunoreactive with VE1. Sixteen of them stained strongly and homogenously throughout the tumor sample. However, 6 tumor samples contained both BRAF(V600E)-immunopositive and BRAF(V600E)-immunonegative cell populations. When the BRAF status was compared with immunoreactivity for melanocyte differentiation antigens, no significant difference in the expression of melan-A, microphthalmia transcription factor, gp100, or tyrosinase was found between mutant and wild-type tumors. In addition to metastatic lesions, we also examined 20 primary melanomas for the expression of BRAF(V600E). Seven of 10 superficial spreading melanomas were immunoreactive with the antibody VE1. Five tumors were strongly and homogenously immunoreactive. In 2 primary tumors the staining was focal, involving only a subpopulation of the tumor. None of the nonsuperficial spreading melanomas was immunoreactive. In 7 primary tumors the mutation status could be analyzed: only tumors carrying the BRAF(V600E) mutation were immunoreactive with VE1. The high specificity and sensitivity of VE1 for the detection of mutant BRAF(V600E) suggests a valuable reagent for clinical purposes.

Though there have been many types of cancer associated with germline BAP1 mutation, the full spectrum of disease association is yet to be ascertained. Here we describe a Danish family with predominantly uveal melanoma but also a range of other tumor types including lung, neuroendocrine, stomach, and breast cancer; as well as pigmented skin lesions. Whole-exome sequencing identified a BAP1 splice mutation located at c.581-2A>G, which leads to a premature truncation of BAP1 in an individual with uveal melanoma. This mutation was carried by several other family members with melanoma or various cancers. The finding expands on the growing profile of BAP1 as an important uveal and cutaneous melanoma tumor suppressor gene and implicates its involvement in the development of lung, and stomach cancer. ",

DNA was also extracted from 10 biopsy samples from patients with sporadic melanomas. NRAS was analyzed using polymerase chain reaction, single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, and nucleotide sequence analysis. Differences in NRAS mutation frequency between hereditary and sporadic melanomas were analyzed by the chi-square test. All statistical tests were two-sided.;Activating mutations in NRAS codon 61, all of which were either CAA(Gln)-AAA(Lys) or CAA(Gln)-CGA(Arg) mutations, were found in 95% (20/21) of primary hereditary melanomas but in only 10% (1/10) of sporadic melanomas (P<.001). Multiple activating NRAS mutations were detected in tumor cells from different regions of individual primary melanomas in nine patients. Activating mutations that were detected in the primary melanomas of these patients were also retained in their metastases. NRAS mutations at sites other than codon 61 were also present in the primary melanomas, indicating genetic instability of this locus. NRAS codon 61 mutations were also detected in dysplastic nevi and in an in situ melanoma, suggesting a role for such mutations during early melanoma development.;The high frequency of NRAS codon 61 mutations detected in these hereditary melanomas may be the result of a hypermutability phenotype associated with a hereditary predisposition for melanoma development in patients with germline CDKN2A mutations.",

Here we show that P16 is mutated in primary bladder carcinomas (3 of 33) and melanomas (5 of 34). These findings support studies that show P16 mutations are not solely a product of growth in tissue culture but rather are involved in formation of tumors in viva.

The correlations between sMICB serum concentration and clinicopathologic variables were analyzed. sMICB serum level was significantly elevated (P < 0.0005) in melanoma patients (mean ± SE = 8.60 ± 0.26 ng/ml) compared with healthy controls (mean ± SE = 6.27 ± 0.25 ng/ml). Univariate analysis revealed a correlation of sMICB serum concentration with advanced stages of disease (P = 0.009). Only a slight increase in sMICB serum level (P = 0.057) could be observed in regard to the tumor burden. Patients undergoing current treatment with cytostatics (n = 18) revealed a strong increase in sMICB serum level (P < 0.0005), whereas treatment with IFN-α alone or combined with cytostatics (n = 19) showed no change in serum sMICB concentration. According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, elevated sMICB serum levels were associated with a poor overall and a progression-free survival. Multivariate analysis revealed sMICB serum concentration as an independent predictive factor for progression-free and overall survival. Our results show a prognostic relevance of serum sMICB in melanoma patients, indicating that the evaluation of sMICB serum level may be important for the selection of therapeutic strategies.",

Both copper chelates were nontoxic to host mice given in the treatment schedule used here. Transplanted B16 melanoma cells were rejected after ip inoculation into CDF1 mice unless they were pretreated with copper chelates, which permitted 100% tumor takes. A limited number of tumor takes were observed in untreated NIH Swiss mice, and treatment with copper chelates doubled the number of ip tumor takes. Treatment with NC-Cu+1 enhanced tumor pigmentation and inhibited tumor encapsulation, a characteristic not shared with NTA-Cu+2. Tumors without capsules grew as unrestrained ascites and this was associated with an earlier onset of morbidity and decreased survival. Only mice treated with copper chelates permitted sc tumor takes. Treatment with NC-Cu+1 caused a reversible suppression of body weight, indicating that tumors grew slowly and independently of host body weight accretion until treatment was stopped. Treatment with NC-Cu+1 enhanced tumorigenicity of sc tumors as evidenced by an earlier onset of palpability, enhanced tumor takes in NIH Swiss mice, decreased final tumor weight and tumor burden, and shortened host survival. These results suggest that copper chelates alter the biological growth characteristics of B16 melanoma in both a murine and copper chelate-specific manner, and that the growth-promoting activity of NC-Cu+1 on tumors is related to the oxidation state of copper in chelates and enhanced copper nutriture of tumors.

Mutations in the KIT gene occur in 10-22% of mucosal melanomas. Tumor response to imatinib mesylate has been reported in about half of the patients with tumors harboring KIT mutations. Responses are almost exclusively restricted to tumors with mutations in KIT exon 9 or 11.

Somatic exon 8 KIT mutations have not been previously reported in mucosal melanoma or in other human solid tumors; however, such mutations have been reported in canine and feline mast cell tumors. Protein transcripts from exon 8 play an important role in the structural and functional integrity of the extracellular domain of KIT. In preclinical studies, a mutation in exon 8 led to autophosphorylation, independent of KIT ligand, and constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase. This biology may explain the successful application of imatinib in animals with tumors harboring exon 8 KIT mutations and in our patient with mucosal melanoma.

The total YLL accounted for 80.4% of the total DALY. Stages I, II, III and IV patients at diagnosis generated, respectively, 27.8%, 32.7%, 26.2% and 13.3% of the total YLL. For the time spent in each stage, localised melanomas, node metastatic melanomas, and distant metastatic accounted, respectively, for 34.8%, 52.6% and 12.6% of the total YLD.

The base year for estimating changes in incidence and mortality was the published melanoma data for 2002.;The registration of melanoma increased from 1037 new registrations in 1993 to 1487 in 1994 and peaked at 1759 in 1995. In 2002 a further increase occurred, to 1842 new registrations and 235 deaths from melanoma. It is likely that 328 of the 1842 new cases of melanoma in 2002 were directly attributable to severe sunburn. A reduction of 10% in the number of people getting severely sunburnt could prevent 28 melanoma cases per year. If 2% of melanoma deaths occur in high-risk individuals, approximately 4 deaths per year could be prevented by surveillance of high-risk groups. Thin melanoma has a very good prognosis: a 10% shift in the depth distribution into the thinnest depth category would result in about 29 deaths from melanoma prevented each year.;The best avenues for reducing the burden of melanoma in New Zealand are prevention of excessive sun exposure and early diagnosis.

Functional evidences implicate semaphorin signals in cancer progression and metastasis. Yet, it is largely unknown whether plexin genes are genetically altered in human tumors. We performed a comprehensive gene copy analysis and mutational profiling of all nine members of the plexin gene family (plexinome), in melanomas and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs), which are characterized by high metastatic potential and poor prognosis. Gene copy analysis detected amplification of PLXNA4 in melanomas, whereas copy number losses of multiple plexin genes were seen in PDACs. Somatic mutations were detected in PLXNA4, PLXNB3, and PLXNC1; providing the first evidence that these plexins are mutated in human cancer. Functional assays in cellular models revealed that some of these missense mutations result in loss of plexin function. For instance, c.1613G>A, p.R538H mutation in the extracellular domain of PLXNB3 prevented binding of the ligand Sema5A. Moreover, although PLXNA4 signaling can inhibit tumor cell migration, the mutated c.5206C>T, p.H1736Y allele had lost this activity.

T cell repopulation coincided with the de novo appearance of melanoma antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in several patients as determined by flow cytometry using tetrameric MART-1, tyrosinase and gp100 peptide/MHC conjugates. Sixteen patients received at least one cycle of DAB/IL2 and five of these patients experienced regressions of melanoma metastases as measured by CT and/or PET imaging. One patient experienced a near complete response with the regression of several hepatic and pulmonary metastases coupled to the de novo appearance of MART-1-specific CD8+ T cells. A single metastatic tumor remained in this patient and, after surgical resection, immunohistochemical analysis revealed MART1+ melanoma cells surrounded by CD8+ T cells.;Taken together, these data indicate that transient depletion of T cells in cancer patients may disrupt the homeostatic control of cognate immunity and allow for the expansion of effector T cells with specificity against neoplastic cells.

Mutations in melanoma cell lines correlated with their sensitivity to corresponding small molecule inhibitors, confirming, for example, lapatinib sensitivity in ERBB4 mutant lines and identifying a novel activating mutation of BRAF. The latter event would not have been identified by clinical sequencing and was associated with responsiveness to a BRAF kinase inhibitor. This approach identified focal copy number changes of PTEN not found by standard methods, such as comparative genomic hybridization (CGH).

Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is found in the majority of melanomas, with either somatic missense mutations of BRAF or, considerably more rarely, mutations of N-RAS. The loss of both products of the CDKN2A gene, proteins p16(ARF) and p14(INK4a), or amplification of microphthalmia-associated transcriptional factor (MITF) are also predisposing factors in the development of melanoma. BRAF mutations are observed mainly in melanomas on skin liable to intermittent UV exposure. Acral and mucosal melanomas, and also melanomas on skin damaged by chronic exposure to the sun are characterized by distinct patterns of chromosomal aberrations with frequent amplifications and alterations of the KIT gene, while BRAF mutations are rarely found in these sites. Uveal melanomas show recurrent chromosomal losses (1p, 3, 6q) and gains (6p, 8q), but mutations of BRAF are hardly ever found. So far, ancillary molecular studies are not regularly applied in the routine diagnostic procedures performed when malignant melanoma is suspected.

Wide excision of primary melanoma is now performed with 1- to 2-cm radial margins, significantly reducing the need for complex plastic closures, skin grafts. and hospital admissions. Although elective lymph node dissection remains controversial as a therapeutic procedure, the development of SL has improved the staging of the regional lymph nodes and diminished the morbidity of lymph node dissection. The role of SL for routine care of melanoma patients remains unknown. Metastasectomy, which is the surgical resection of distant metastases with tumor-free surgical margins, has not been popular for AJCC stage IV patients with multiple metastases, because surgery is considered a local therapy and therefore of little value for management of disseminated disease. Nevertheless, the many reports of long-term survival after resection of distant melanoma metastases to diverse soft tissue and organ sites clearly indicate that this form of cytoreductive surgery can be extremely successful in carefully selected patients. Unlike chemotherapy, complete surgical metastasectomy can rapidly render a patient disease-free with only a short period of postoperative morbidity. Most patients fully recover from the surgical procedure within 6 weeks, returning to most or all activities. The ability to select patients for surgery is based on the development of more sophisticated imaging techniques, which allow better preoperative differentiation of patients with single versus multiple metastases and improve the surgeon's ability to identify and resect multiple metastatic sites. The overall data suggest that patients whose metastases can be completely resected will experience improved overall survival and occasional long-term cure regardless of the metastatic organ site and number of metastases. We believe that increased understanding of the biology of the primary and metastases, dramatic improvement in the accuracy of staging metastatic disease, and better techniques of surgical resection provide the best chance for long-term palliation or cure of melanoma. Cytoreductive surgery should be considered a form of immunotherapy. The long-term clinical benefit of this therapy depends on the patient's immune response to, the surgical reduction in tumor burden: an immune response that controls subclinical micrometastases should optimize postoperative survival.",

Meanwhile, evidence has been provided that combinations between BRAF inhibitors and MEK1/2 inhibitors are more promising than single-agent treatments. Moreover, new treatment algorithms favor sequential treatment using BRAF inhibitors and newly developed immunotherapies targeting common T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) or programmed cell death 1 (PD-1).

The absence of TGFbeta responsiveness noted in cultured uveal melanoma cells also suggests that the TGFbeta pathway plays a role in the formation of this tumor. Therefore, mutational screening was performed in several key genes in tumor-suppressor pathways that are known to be altered in some uveal melanomas.;Using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) analysis and DNA sequencing, a series of 67 uveal melanomas were screened for inactivating mutations in the TGFbeta pathway members Smad4 and TGFbeta receptor type 2 (TGFbetaR2), the downstream cell-cycle inhibitor p15(INK4B), and the cell-cycle inhibitors p14(ARF) and p16(INK4A). p16(INK4A) was also investigated for promoter hypermethylation. Mutational analysis was also performed on the Wnt pathway gene beta-catenin, known to be mutated in approximately one quarter of cutaneous melanoma cell lines.;Polymorphisms in p16(INK4A) were detected in 3 of 50 samples, but no inactivating mutations were detected in any of the genes screened. Promoter hypermethylation of p16(INK4A) was detected in 5 of 55 tumors, and loss of heterozygosity of the p16(INK4A) locus was detected in 5 of 16 tumors.;Most primary uveal melanomas do not appear to contain somatic mutations in Smad4, TGFbetaR2, p14(ARF), p15(INK4B), p16(INK4A), or beta-catenin.

A new score system known as the non-sentinel risk score, (N-SNORE) based on five clinical and pathological characteristics (gender, regression in primary melanoma, proportion of SNs containing melanoma, perinodal lymphatic invasion, and SN tumor burden), was first published in 2010. In this study, the accuracy of N-SNORE was validated in melanoma patients with positive SLN.;A total of 106 melanoma patients with positive SLN, who had undergone complete lymph node dissection (CLND) subsequently, were included in the study. The N-SNORE was calculated in all patients, and the risk was compared to the frequency of NSLN metastases. Statistical analysis of the data was performed.;Thirteen patients were at very low risk for NSN metastasis (score 0), 63 patients at low risk (score 1-3), 19 at intermediate risk (score 4-5), 6 at high risk (score 6-7), and 5 at very high risk (score >8). NSLN positivity rates for these 5 risk groups were 7.7%, 18.2%, 21.1%, 33.3%, and 80%, respectively. According to Fisher's exact test, the contingency coefficient was .322; the p-value was .025.;An increasing N-SNORE was clearly correlated with a higher risk of NSLN positivity.

We then sequenced the gene in melanoma and identified 10 somatic mutations in 7 of 57 tumors (12%). Reconstitution of PTPRD expression in GBM and melanoma cells harboring deletions or mutations led to growth suppression and apoptosis that was alleviated by both the somatic and constitutional mutations. These data implicate PTPRD in the pathogenesis of tumors of neuroectodermal origin and, when taken together with other recent reports of PTPRD mutations in adenocarcinoma of the colon and lung, suggest that PTPRD may be one of a select group of tumor suppressor genes that are inactivated in a wide range of common human tumor types.",

Since mutations in Parkin are the major driver of early-onset PD and Parkin was recently reported to play a role in cancer development, we hypothesized that Parkin links melanoma and PD. By analyzing whole exome/genome sequencing of Parkin from 246 melanoma patients, we identified five non-synonymous mutations, three synonymous mutations, and one splice region variant in Parkin in 3.6% of the samples. In vitro analysis showed that wild-type Parkin plays a tumor suppressive role in melanoma development resulting in cell-cycle arrest, reduction of metabolic activity, and apoptosis. Using a mass spectrometry-based analysis, we identified potential Parkin substrates in melanoma and generated a functional protein association network. The activity of mutated Parkin was assessed by protein structure modeling and examination of Parkin E3 ligase activity. The Parkin-E28K mutation impairs Parkin ubiquitination activity and abolishes its tumor suppressive effect. Taken together, our analysis of genomic sequence and in vitro data indicate that Parkin is a potential link between melanoma and Parkinson's disease.

        "Doc_abstract":"Familial melanoma accounts for approximately a tenth of all melanoma cases. The most commonly known melanoma susceptibility gene is the highly penetrant CDKN2A (p16INK4a) locus, which is transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion and accounts for approximately 20-50 % of familial melanoma cases. Mutated p16INK4a shows impaired capacity to inhibit the cyclin D1-CDK4 complex, allowing for unchecked cell cycle progression. Mutations in the second protein coded by CDKN2A, p14ARF, are much less common and result in proteasomal degradation of p53 with subsequent accumulation of DNA damage as the cell progresses through the cell cycle without a functional p53-mediated DNA damage response. Mutations in CDK4 that impair the inhibitory interaction with p16INK4a also increase melanoma risk but these mutations are extremely rare. Genes of the melanin biosynthetic pathway, including MC1R and MITF, have also been implicated in melanomagenesis. MC1R variants were traditionally thought to increase risk for melanoma secondary to intensified UV-mediated DNA damage in the setting of absent photoprotective eumelanin. Accumulation of pheomelanin, which appears to have a carcinogenic effect regardless of UV exposure, may be a more likely mechanism. Impaired SUMOylation of the E318K variant of MITF results in increased transcription of genes that confer melanocytes with a pro-malignant phenotype. Mutations in the tumor suppressor BAP1 enhance the metastatic potential of uveal melanoma and predispose to cutaneous/ocular melanoma, atypical melanocytic tumors, and other internal malignancies (COMMON syndrome). Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous low-risk alleles. Although several melanoma susceptibility genes have been identified, risk assessment tools have been developed only for the most common gene implicated with hereditary melanoma, CDKN2A. MelaPRO, a validated model that relies on Mendelian inheritance and Bayesian probability theories, estimates carrier probability for CDKN2A and future risk of melanoma taking into account a patient's family and past medical history of melanoma. Genetic testing for CDKN2A mutations is currently available but the Melanoma Genetics Consortium recommends offering such testing to patients only in the context of research protocols because clinical utility is uncertain.",

Several notable observations were obtained: (i) phospho-ERK staining was very heterogeneous within the tumor; (ii) in most cases, ERK was phosphorylated in only a minority of tumor cells; (iii) the percentage of phospho-ERK-positive cells was not correlated with the mutational status of NRAS and/or BRAF; (iv) the Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) was expressed homogeneously in virtually all melanoma samples not reflecting the inhomogeneity of phospho-ERK; and, finally, (v) neither the portion of phospho-ERK-positive tumor cells nor the RKIP staining intensity showed any correlation to the clinical course of the patients.

Clinically, MM of the vulva manifests as asymptomatic pigmented, rarely a pigmented lesion, as the usual clinical form is superficial spreading MM and much less common nodular MM, which is associated with a poorer prognosis in. general. The diagnosis is confirmed by histological examination. Conduction of PCR and DNA analysis for detection of BRAF mutations, NRAS mutations and KIT amplification is also appropriate. Advanced age, black race, tumor size, tumor thickness, ulceration, presence of satellite lesions, involvement of adjacent organs (vagina, urethra), and the presence of regional or distant metastases are identified as the most important prognostic markers. Radical wide excision followed by bilateral lymphadenectomy id considered as the optimal therapeutic approach.",

Despite the absence of known activating mutations, the RAF-MEK-ERK, or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), pathway is usually activated in uveal melanoma. An assay with increased potential to identify mutations is now available, and this study was therefore conducted to reanalyze uveal melanoma cell lines and primary tumors for this mutation.;Eleven uveal melanoma cell lines and 45 primary uveal melanomas were analyzed for mutations in exon 15 of the B-RAF gene by using pyrophosphorolysis-activated polymerization (PAP). Mutations were validated by sequencing of the PAP product.;B-RAF mutations were detected in cell lines OCM-1 and -3 (V600E) and in six primary uveal melanomas. The V600K mutation was detected in one primary uveal melanoma, for which the V600E assay turned out to be sensitive as well. Direct sequencing of the exon 15 PCR product did not reveal the mutations found with the PAP-assay, indicating a low frequency of the mutant allele in primary samples.;Because of the very sensitive PAP technology, B-RAF mutations were found in cell lines and primary uveal melanomas, which suggests that they may occasionally play a role in the activation of the MAPK pathway in uveal melanoma and indicates a higher prevalence of B-RAF mutations in uveal melanoma than was reported earlier. However, the relative scarcity of the B-RAF mutation excludes an elemental role for this mutation in uveal melanoma.",

We investigated 37 malignant melanomas (15 primary tumors and 22 metastases) for alterations of 4 genes encoding members of this pathway, i.e., CTNNB1 (beta-catenin gene, 3p22.1), APC (adenomatous polyposis coli gene, 5q22.2), BTRC (beta-transducin repeat-containing protein gene, 10q24.3) and ICAT (inhibitor of beta-catenin and Tcf-4, 1p36.2). Mutational analysis of CTNNB1 identified somatic mutations in 1 primary melanoma and 1 melanoma metastasis from 2 different patients (5%). Both mutations affected the N-terminal degradation box of beta-catenin, which is important for the regulation of beta-catenin homeostasis. Another primary melanoma carried a somatic APC missense mutation within the known mutation cluster region in exon 15. Fourteen tumors (40%) showed LOH at microsatellite markers on 1p36. None of the tumors had lost both copies of the ICAT gene, but 1 melanoma metastasis carried a somatic point mutation altering the translation start codon of ICAT. Real-time RT-PCR showed markedly reduced ICAT transcript levels (<or=20% relative to normal skin and benign melanocytic nevi) in 28/36 malignant melanomas (78%), including 13/14 tumors with LOH on 1p36. Allelic loss on 10q was detected in 15 tumors (44%). We found neither mutations nor complete loss of expression of the BTRC gene in our melanoma series.

However, 50% of patients with deep (> 4 mm) primary melanomas, 60-85% of those with regional lymph node metastases (AJCC Stage III), and 95% of those with metastases to distant sites (AJCC Stage IV) will experience recurrence, which is associated with a dismal prognosis. Adjuvant therapy of melanoma assumes that treatment will be more effective when the tumor burden is small. In the 1970s and 1980s, randomized trials tested the efficacy of chemotherapy, nonspecific immunotherapy, levamisole, and regional perfusion therapy in patients with AJCC Stage II and III melanoma. Dacarbazine (DTIC) alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs or with nonspecific immunotherapy did not significantly improve disease free or overall survival. Of the four levamisole trials, only the study conducted by the National Cancer Institute of Canada revealed a reduction in recurrence and mortality; however, this reduction was not significant by multivariate analysis. The value of regional perfusion therapy following resection of high risk extremity melanomas is currently being determined by multiinstitutional studies conducted by the World Health Organization and the North American Perfusion Group. Multi-institutional trials also are examining the adjuvant role of interferon-alpha in patients with deep (> 3 mm) primary melanomas or positive regional lymph nodes; results should reveal its optimum dose and duration of treatment (3 x 10(6) U for > or = 2 years versus 10 x 10(6) U/m2 for 1 year, subcutaneously 3 times a week) and its impact on survival. A randomized trial of interferon-gamma undertaken by the Southwest Oncology Group was discontinued after interim analysis indicated an adverse effect. Phase II trials indicate that active specific immunotherapy can alter the natural course of AJCC Stage III and IV melanoma following surgical resection of nodal or distant metastases. Upcoming results of Phase III trials will establish the role of active specific immunotherapy for adjuvant treatment of patients with resected AJCC Stage III and IV melanoma.",

In an effort to resolve this contradiction in the published literature, we have re-evaluated a range of cultured and non-cultured melanocytic lesions for the occurrence of point mutations in the p53 gene using DNA- and RNA-dependent single strand conformation polymorphism (RNA-SSCP) and direct DNA sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified DNA, and overexpression of the p53 protein using immunohistochemistry. We found point mutations in 25% (9 of 36) of cultured melanomas and 0% in 34 fresh melanoma biopsies; however, increased p53 expression was found in 42% of paraffin-embedded melanoma specimens and 7% of benign lesions. The low frequency of p53 point mutations and high frequency of p53 expression suggests that derangement of the p53 gene by point mutations is not a common perturbation in the majority of melanoma cells, and that overexpression of p53 in this tumour type is due to a mechanism other than point mutation.",

Mutation profiling of FBXW7, biological relevance of these mutations and its inactivation, and pharmacological inhibition of NOTCH1 were examined using in vitro and in vivo assays.;We found FBXW7 to be mutated in eight (8.1%) melanoma patients in our cohort (n = 103). Protein expression analysis in human tissue samples (n = 96) and melanoma cell lines (n = 20) showed FBXW7 inactivation as a common event in melanoma (40.0% of cell lines). As a result of FBXW7 loss, we observed an accumulation of its substrates, such as NOTCH1. Ectopic expression of mutant forms of FBXW7 (by 2.4-fold), as well as silencing of FBXW7 in immortalized melanocytes, accelerated tumor formation in vivo (by 3.9-fold). Its inactivation led to NOTCH1 activation, upregulation of NOTCH1 target genes (by 2.6-fold), and promotion of tumor angiogenesis and resulted in tumor shrinkage upon NOTCH1 inhibition (by fivefold).;Our data provides evidence on FBXW7 as a critical tumor suppressor mutated and inactivated in melanoma that results in sustained NOTCH1 activation and renders NOTCH signaling inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy in this setting.",

It is unclear whether all metastatic lesions carry the same BRAF mutation status found in the primary tumor and if discordancy exists, in what frequency it occurs. Primary and matched metastatic lesions in 25 melanoma patients were tested for the BRAF V600E/Ec, V600K, V600D, and V600R mutations using a BRAF RGQ PCR kit (Qiagen).

Of these patients, 2 (8%) had BRAF mutation-positive primary melanomas with BRAF mutation-negative metastatic lesions and 2 (8%) patient had BRAF mutation-negative melanoma with a BRAF mutation-positive metastatic lesion. In summary, discordancy of BRAF mutation status is not an infrequent finding between primary and metastatic melanoma. It may be prudent in previously negative patients to determine BRAF mutation status of new metastatic tumors for proper allocation of BRAF inhibitor therapy.

The role of c-KIT signaling in melanoma has been controversial; although c-KIT activity is critical to melanocyte development, its expression tends to be lost in most melanomas. Some reports have even shown that the re-expression of c-KIT induces apoptosis in melanoma cell lines. The recent publication of work showing the presence of activating c-KIT mutations in acral and mucosal melanomas, as well as melanomas arising on skin with chronic sun damage, has renewed interest in c-KIT signaling in melanoma. Recent work from our own laboratory has further identified melanomas with constitutive c-KIT signaling activity resulting from c-KIT receptor overexpression. Although the initial clinical trials of the c-KIT inhibitor imatinib mesylate in melanoma were negative, some dramatic responses have been seen in patients with very high c-KIT expression and/or documented activating mutations, fostering the belief that focused studies in patients selected on the basis of c-KIT mutational status will yield more encouraging results.

ANIMALS-18 dogs with malignant melanomas and 8 healthy control dogs. PROCEDURES-cDNA was prepared from malignant melanoma biopsy specimens and from pigmented oral mucocutaneous tissues of healthy control dogs. Genomic DNA was extracted from poorly pigmented melanomas. A PCR assay was performed by use of Melan-A, SILV, or tyrosinase-specific primers. RESULTS-Splice variants of Melan-A and SILV were identified in malignant melanomas and also in healthy pigmented tissues, whereas a tyrosinase splice variant was detected in melanoma tissues only. A short interspersed nuclear element (SINE) insertion mutation was identified in the SILV gene in 1 of 10 poorly pigmented melanomas. Six novel exonic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; 3 synonymous and 3 nonsynonymous) were detected in the tyrosinase gene, and 1 nonsynonymous exonic SNP was detected in the SILV gene. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE-Variants of MAA mRNA were detected in malignant melanoma tissues of dogs. The importance of MAA alternative transcripts expressed in melanomas and normal pigmented tissues was unclear, but they may have represented a means of regulating melanin synthesis. The tyrosinase splice variant was detected only in melanomas and could potentially be a tumor-specific target for immunotherapy. A SILV SINE insertion mutation was identified in a melanoma from a Great Dane, a breed known to carry this mutation (associated with merle coat color).

Activation of extracellular signal-regulated (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling is commonly found in melanomas mainly through oncogenic mutations of B-Raf. We previously reported that activation of ERK/MAP kinase stimulates synthesis of fibronectin by upregulating the transcription factor early growth response-1 (Egr-1). To further analyze the link between ERK/MAP kinase pathway and fibronectin in melanoma, we have studied the regulation and role of fibronectin produced by melanoma cells bearing oncogenic B-Raf mutation. We show that fibronectin is expressed in situ during tumor progression and that high fibronectin and Egr-1 levels are found in cells expressing this mutation. Expression of active mutants of B-Raf induces fibronectin, whereas endogenous fibronectin is inhibited by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion of B-Raf or Egr-1. In contrast, stimulation of ERK pathway is insufficient to promote fibronectin upregulation in normal melanocytes. Finally, we show that suppression of fibronectin by siRNA leads to decreased melanoma cell invasiveness in vitro. These results reveal a tumor-specific regulation of fibronectin by constitutive ERK/MAP kinase signaling and indicate that self-production of fibronectin may play a role in melanoma tumorigenesis, by promoting tumor cell invasion.",

Whether mutations in CDKN2A confer a predisposition to sporadic (nonfamilial) melanoma is not known. In some patients with sporadic melanoma, one or more additional primary lesions develop, suggesting that some of these patients have an underlying genetic susceptibility to the cancer. We hypothesized that this predisposition might be due to germ-line CDKN2A mutations.;We used the polymerase chain reaction, single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, and direct DNA sequencing to identify germ-line mutations in the CDKN2A gene in patients with multiple primary melanomas who did not have family histories of the disease. A quantitative yeast two-hybrid assay was used to evaluate the functional importance of the CDKN2A variants.;Of 33 patients with multiple primary melanomas, 5 (15 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 4 percent to 27 percent) had germ-line CDKN2A mutations. These included a 24-bp insertion at the 5' end of the coding sequence, three missense mutations (Arg24Pro, Met53Ile, and Ser56Ile), and a 2-bp deletion at position 307 to 308 (resulting in a truncated CDKN2A protein). In three families, CDKN2A mutations identical to those in the probands were found in other family members. In two families with mutations, we uncovered previously unknown evidence of family histories of melanoma.;Some patients with multiple primary melanomas but without family histories of the disease have germ-line mutations of the CDKN2A gene.

Herein, we describe the unique features that distinguish melanoma from other solid tumors and contribute to the malignant phenotype of melanoma cells. For example, although melanoma cells are highly antigenic, they are extremely efficient at evading host immune response. Melanoma cells share numerous cell surface molecules with vascular cells, are highly angiogenic, are mesenchymal in nature, and possess a higher degree of 'stemness' than do other solid tumors. Finally, analysis of melanoma mutations has revealed that the gene expression profile of malignant melanoma is different from that of other cancers.

Individually, presence of TERT promoter and BRAF/NRAS mutations associated with poor disease-free and melanoma-specific survival with modification of the effect by the rs2853669 polymorphism within the TERT promoter. Hazard ratio (HR) for simultaneous occurrence of TERT promoter and BRAF/NRAS mutations for disease-free survival was 2.3 (95% CI 1.2-4.4) and for melanoma-specific survival 5.8 (95% CI 1.9-18.3). The effect of the mutations on melanoma-specific survival in noncarriers of variant allele of the polymorphism was significant (HR 4.5, 95% CI 1.4-15.2) but could not be calculated for the carriers due to low number of events. The variant allele per se showed association with increased survival (HR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.9). The data in this study provide preliminary evidence that TERT promoter mutations in combination with BRAF/NRAS mutations can be used to identify patients at risk of aggressive disease and the possibility of refinement of the classification with inclusion of the rs2853669 polymorphism within TERT promoter.

        "Doc_abstract":"Mutations in the ras genes are key events in the process of carcinogenesis; in particular, point mutations in codon 61 of exon 2 of the N-ras gene occur frequently in cutaneous melanoma. To investigate whether these mutations occur in early or late tumor progression phases, we searched for point mutations in the N- and K-ras genes in 69 primary cutaneous melanoma, 35 metastases, and seven nevocellular nevi in association with cutaneous melanoma. Lesions were microdissected in order to procure pure tumor samples from the distinctive growth phases of the cutaneous melanoma; the very sensitive denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis technique was used to visualize the mutations, and was followed by sequencing. Point mutations in the N-ras gene but not in the K-ras gene were detected on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Twenty-three primary (33%) and nine metastatic (26%) melanomas showed bandshifts for N-ras. In the majority of cases, mutations occurring in early growth phases (i.e., the \"intraepidermal\" radial growth phase), were preserved in later growth phases (i.e., the invasive radial growth phase, vertical growth phase, and metastatic phase), which proves the clonal relationship between the successive growth phases. In three cases, however, the mutations differed between the distinctive growth phases within the same cutaneous melanoma, due to the occurrence of an additional mutation (especially in codon 61) in a later tumor progression phase. Our approach also permitted us to analyze the mutational status of nevi, associated with cutaneous melanoma. Six out of seven associated nevi carried the same sequence (mutated or wild-type) as the primary cutaneous melanoma, whereas in one case the sequence for N-ras differed between the primary melanoma and the associated nevus. In conclusion, this approach allowed us to demonstrate the clonal relationship between subsequent growth phases of melanoma and associated nevi; our results suggest that N-ras exon 1 mutations preferentially occur during early stages of tumor progression and hence may be involved in melanoma initiation, whereas those in N-ras exon 2 are found preferentially during later stages and hence are more probably involved in metastatic spread of cutaneous melanoma.",

However, in melanoma-a highly chemotherapy-resistant disease-TP53 mutations are rare, raising the possibility that this cancer uses alternative ways to overcome p53-mediated tumor suppression. Here we show that Mdm4 p53 binding protein homolog (MDM4), a negative regulator of p53, is upregulated in a substantial proportion (∼65%) of stage I-IV human melanomas and that melanocyte-specific Mdm4 overexpression enhanced tumorigenesis in a mouse model of melanoma induced by the oncogene Nras. MDM4 promotes the survival of human metastatic melanoma by antagonizing p53 proapoptotic function. Notably, inhibition of the MDM4-p53 interaction restored p53 function in melanoma cells, resulting in increased sensitivity to cytotoxic chemotherapy and to inhibitors of the BRAF (V600E) oncogene.

Currently, because of metastatic spread, there are no effective treatment options for late-stage metastatic melanoma patients. Studies over the past two decades have provided insight into several complex molecular mechanisms as to how these malignancies evade immunological control, indicating the importance of immune escape or suppression for tumor survival. Thus, it is essential to develop innovative cancer strategies and address immune obstacles with the goal of generating more effective immunotherapies. One important area of study is to further elucidate the role and significance of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the maintenance of the tumor microenvironment. These cells possess a remarkable ability to suppress immune responses and, as such, facilitate tumor growth. Thus, MDSCs represent an important new target for preventing tumor progression and escape from immune control. In this study, we investigated the role of MDSCs in immune suppression of T cells in an antigen-specific B16 melanoma murine system utilizing a novel synthetic tyrosinase (Tyr) DNA vaccine therapy in both prophylactic and therapeutic models. This Tyr vaccine induced a robust and broad immune response, including directing CD8 T-cell infiltration into tumor sites. The vaccine also reduced the number of MDSCs in the tumor microenvironment through the downregulation of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, interleukin-10, CXCL5 and arginase II, factors important for MDSC expansion. This novel synthetic DNA vaccine significantly reduced the melanoma tumor burden and increased survival in vivo, due likely, in part, to the facilitation of a change in the tumor microenvironment through MDSC suppression.",

However, successful application of such therapies is dependent on the presence or absence of mutations within the patient's tumor that can confer clinical efficacy or drug resistance. Building on these findings, we developed a high-throughput mutation panel for the identification of frequently occurring and clinically relevant mutations in melanoma. An extensive literature search and interrogation of the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer database identified more than 1,000 melanoma mutations. Applying a filtering strategy to focus on mutations amenable to the development of targeted drugs, we initially screened 120 known mutations in 271 samples using the Sequenom MassARRAY system. A total of 252 mutations were detected in 17 genes, the highest frequency occurred in BRAF (n = 154, 57%), NRAS (n = 55, 20%), CDK4 (n = 8, 3%), PTK2B (n = 7, 2.5%), and ERBB4 (n = 5, 2%). Based on this initial discovery screen, a total of 46 assays interrogating 39 mutations in 20 genes were designed to develop a melanoma-specific panel. These assays were distributed in multiplexes over 8 wells using strict assay design parameters optimized for sensitive mutation detection. The final melanoma-specific mutation panel is a cost effective, sensitive, high-throughput approach for identifying mutations of clinical relevance to molecular-based therapeutics for the treatment of melanoma.

In order to test for somatic mutations in the CDK4I gene in tumors, DNAs from 30 surgically resected melanomas of both cutaneous and uveal origins were sequenced. No mutations were detected in the coding region of the CDK4I gene, while mutations or deletions were detected in 60% (9 of 15) of the cultured melanoma cell line DNAs. Among presumptive familial cases, nine of which were members of families with one or two other documented melanoma cases, no germline mutations were detected by sequence analysis. A deletion in the second exon of the CDK4I gene was found in one germline allele of a familial melanoma patient from a family with eight affected first degree relatives.

We identified in the tumor cell compartment supra-physiologic c-MET up-expression, infra-physiologic LEF1 down-expression and YAP1 signature enrichment as drivers of acquired resistance.

Following RA treatment, the CD8-positive population was increased in tumor-bearing mice, while the CD4+ population was not significantly altered. Since previous studies indicated that plasma membrane fragments (or vesicles) could alter lymphocyte distributions and proliferative capacities, the in vitro shedding of membrane fragments from B16-F10 tumor cells was assayed and observed to be decreased after continuous treatment of cultures with 10(-6) M RA for 21 days. Membrane shedding from B16-F10 cells was inhibited by 48.5% following RA treatment. Based on these in vivo and in vitro results, we suggest that RA treatment may diminish tumor growth by decreasing tumor-induced immunosuppressive events.",

The role of immune system against infection is self-evident. Although the role of the immune system in the immune surveillance of cancer has not been proven, the immune system is believed to play an interactive role in the regulation of tumor growth. Immunotherapy is the application of the immune system to fight against the tumor. Although immunotherapeutic approaches have been tried in many types of cancer, both malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma seem to show occasional, but definitive response to immunotherapy. The fact that immune eradication of tumor is most efficient when the tumor burden is minimal speaks for the fact that immunotherapy may be most effective for control of microscopic disease. Therefore, to maximize the effect of immunotherapy, the tumor burden needs to be reduced, hopefully to microscopic level either by surgery or in combination with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Also, new strategies are needed to develop more potent vaccines and stimulate effector cells to eradicate tumor cells under the most optimal conditions. ",

We analyzed families with two or more cases of melanoma for germline mutations in CDKN2A and CDK4 to elucidate the contribution of these gene defects to familial malignant melanoma and to the occurrence of other cancer types.;: The entire CDKN2A coding region and exon 2 of the CDK4 gene of an affected member of each of 52 families from southern Sweden with at least two cases of melanoma in first- or second-degree relatives were screened for mutations by use of polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Statistical tests were two-sided.;: CDKN2A mutations were found in 10 (19%) of the 52 families. Nine families carried an identical alteration consisting of the insertion of arginine at position 113 of p16(INK4a), and one carried a missense mutation, in which the valine at position 115 was replaced with a glycine. The 113insArg mutant p16(INK4a) was unable to bind cdk4 and cdk6 in an in vitro binding assay. Six of the 113insArg families had at least one member with multiple primary melanomas; the 113insArg families also had a high frequency of other malignancies-in particular, breast cancer (a total of eight cases compared with the expected 2.1; P =.0014) and pancreatic cancer (a total of six cases compared with the expected 0.16; P<.0001). Families with breast cancer also had a propensity for multiple melanomas in females, suggesting that a sex-dependent factor may modify the phenotypic expression of CDKN2A alterations.;: Our findings confirm that the majority of CDKN2A-associated melanoma families in Sweden are due to a single founder mutation. They also show that families with the CDKN2A 113insArg mutation have an increased risk not only of multiple melanomas and pancreatic carcinoma but also of breast cancer.",

Pyrosequencing was used as the molecular method and the VE1 antibody for immunohistochemical evaluation when determining the BRAF-V600 mutation.;The BRAF-V600 mutation was found in 75 of the 96 tumors (78.1%) from the 48 cases. V600E and V600K were present in 60 and 10 tumors, respectively, whereas V600R and V600M were present in 2 tumors and V600G in 1 tumor. There was no mutation in 5 metastases (12.8%) of the 39 cases with a V600 mutation in the primary tumor and no mutation in the primary tumor of 2 of the 36 cases (5.6%) with the V600 mutation in the metastasis. Fifty-six tumors were immunohistochemically positive where a V600E mutation was detected with pyrosequencing. Wild-type tumors (n = 20) and tumors with non-V600E mutations (n = 15) on pyrosequencing were immunonegative with VE1. The sensitivity and specificity of immunohistochemistry were 93.3% and 97.2%, respectively.;In conclusion, BRAF-V600 mutation inconsistencies of up to 14.5% can be seen between the primary and metastatic foci in melanoma cases. These findings should be taken into account when planning targeted therapy and deciding on treatment responsiveness/unresponsiveness. An immunohistochemical method can be used as the first step to detect a BRAF-V600 mutation but additional molecular methods should be used when immunohistochemistry results are negative.",

To gain insights into its genetics, we performed whole-genome sequencing at very deep coverage of tumor-control pairs in 33 samples (24 primary and 9 metastases). Genome-wide, the number of coding mutations was rather low (only 17 variants per tumor on average; range 7-28), thus radically different from cutaneous melanoma, where hundreds of exonic DNA insults are usually detected. Furthermore, no UV light-induced mutational signature was identified. Recurrent coding mutations were found in the known UM drivers GNAQ, GNA11, BAP1, EIF1AX, and SF3B1. Other genes, i.e., TP53BP1, CSMD1, TTC28, DLK2, and KTN1, were also found to harbor somatic mutations in more than one individual, possibly indicating a previously undescribed association with UM pathogenesis. De novo assembly of unmatched reads from non-coding DNA revealed peculiar copy-number variations defining specific UM subtypes, which in turn could be associated with metastatic transformation. Mutational-driven comparison with other tumor types showed that UM is very similar to pediatric tumors, characterized by very few somatic insults and, possibly, important epigenetic changes. Through the analysis of whole-genome sequencing data, our findings shed new light on the molecular genetics of uveal melanoma, delineating it as an atypical tumor of the adult for which somatic events other than mutations in exonic DNA shape its genetic landscape and define its metastatic potential.",

We did quantitative positional methylation analysis (pyrosequencing) on 37 sera from melanoma patients and on 21 pairs of corresponding sera and melanoma specimens in addition to Taqman reverse transcription-PCR. We report significant positional PTEN promoter methylation in 62% of circulating DNA isolated from sera of patients with metastatic melanoma. The percentage of methylation of a selected CpG island in blood showed a correlation with methylation levels in the corresponding melanoma tissue. Moreover, high percentages of PTEN methylation were associated with low PTEN transcription levels. Using the demethylation agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, reduced methylation and a corresponding increase in PTEN protein were observed in BLM melanoma cells, leading to reduced AKT activity in an in vitro kinase assay. In summary, epigenetic PTEN silencing seems to be a relevant mechanism of inactivating this tumor suppressor gene in melanoma that may promote melanoma development by derepression of the AKT pathway.",

Recently, highly recurrent telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT)-promoter mutations were found in malignant melanomas, which may function as driver mutations of skin cancer. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that MUP and mucosal melanomas harbor different prevalences of TERT-promoter mutations. Thirty-nine patients with MUP and 53 patients with mucosal melanomas were retrieved. In total, 152 paraffin samples of 92 patients were analyzed, and in 38 patients, multiple samples were tested. Mutational analysis of the TERT-promoter, BRAF, NRAS, and KIT genes was carried out. In total, 92 patients were eligible for mutational analysis. TERT-promoter mutations were found in 33 patients (35.9%): chr5, 1,295,228 C>T (18 patients); chr5, 1,295,250 C>T (11 patients); chr5, 1,295,228-229 CC>TT (three patients); chr5, 1,295,242-243 CC>TT (one patient). The mutations were significantly more prevalent in MUP [26 (66.7%)] than in mucosal melanomas [seven patients (13.2%); P<0.001]. In MUP, BRAF mutations were found in 46.2% of patients (18 patients) and NRAS mutations in 28.2% of patients (11 patients). In mucosal melanoma, NRAS mutations were found in 18.9% of patients (10), and BRAF and KIT mutations in 7.5% of patients (four patients), respectively. The prevalence of TERT-promoter mutations was associated with the patient's sex [23 (51.1%) men, 10 (21.3%) women; P=0.004]. No significant correlation was found between TERT-mutation and patient survival. The TERT-promoter genotype of MUP points toward a cutaneous and not mucosal origin.

There is data to suggest that dabrafenib not only shows activity in V600E-mutated melanoma, but also in non-V600E BRAF-mutated disease such as V600K. There is also early data to suggest that dabrafenib is effective in controlling metastases in the brain. Combining dabrafenib with the selective mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor trametinib has been effective in improving both the progression-free survival and overall survival of melanoma patients over those patients treated with dabrafenib alone. Dabrafenib is still being evaluated in several clinical trials in melanoma as well as a variety of other solid tumors with BRAF mutations.

To further test the effect of IL-6 on melanoma growth, a non-IL-6-producing murine B16-derived melanoma cell line (HFH18) was transfected with a murine IL-6 expression vector, resulting in stable transfectants (HFH18/IL-6(+)) that expressed significant amounts of IL-6 mRNA and secreted high levels of bioactive IL-6. Syngeneic C57BL/6 mice inoculated subcutaneously with HFH18/IL-6(+) cells developed tumors that reached a final mean diameter of less than half the size of tumors that developed in mice inoculated with either HFH18 parental or HFH18 cells transfected with the IL-6 cDNA in the non-coding 3'-5' orientation (HFH18/IL-6(-) cells). In addition, mice bearing IL-6-producing HFH18/IL-6(+) tumors survived twice as long as mice bearing HFH18 parental or HFH18/IL-6(-) tumors. The specificity of melanoma growth inhibition by IL-6 was confirmed by the reversal of the slow-growing phenotype of HFH18/IL-6(+) cells by local peritumoral administration of neutralizing alpha-murine IL-6 antibody. IL-6-producing melanoma cells exerted a growth-inhibitory effect on distant parental tumors in a dose-dependent manner. The growth of HFH18/IL-6(+) melanomas was also decreased in nude mice, suggesting that melanoma-derived IL-6 may mediate this anti-tumor effect independently of a normal host B- and T-cell immune response. Thus, melanoma-derived IL-6 exerts a significant inhibitory effect on cutaneous melanoma growth and progression.

        "Doc_abstract":"Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a standard staging procedure for many patients with clinically node negative, invasive melanoma, providing excellent prognostic information in appropriately selected patients. The broad acceptance of SLNB into clinical practice has resulted in substantial numbers of patients found to have microscopic nodal metastases. For patients with a positive sentinel node, a completion lymph node dissection (CLND) is the current standard of care. The majority of patients who undergo CLND are found to have histologically negative non-sentinel nodes, and yet are exposed to the potential morbidity of CLND, including infection, wound complications, and lymphedema. We do not yet know if there is a survival benefit from CLND that justifies its morbidity and we are currently unable to identify clinical and pathologic factors that may be associated with the likelihood of benefit from CLND. Controversy regarding the management of melanoma patients with a positive sentinel node highlights the need for continued investigation in melanoma biology, treatment, and outcomes. Patients with minimal tumor burden in their regional nodes would especially benefit from a better understanding of the appropriate management strategies. Ongoing clinical trials are aimed at determining whether CLND is superior to nodal observation and surveillance in patients with positive sentinel nodes, and at determining the outcome of patients with minimal disease in their sentinel node who forego CLND. These studies may help to resolve the uncertainties of the management in these patients. Until we have further information, CLND for melanoma patients with positive sentinel nodes remains the preferred, standard management strategy.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Activating mutations in BRAF or c-kit have been reported in malignant melanoma. Because the activating mutations are dominant, it has been assumed that they are heterozygous in the affected tumors. To test this, we have carefully examined the DNA sequencing electropherograms on 43 BRAF mutation-positive and 3 c-kit mutation-positive malignant melanomas to determine the ratio of the normal to mutant allele. Of the 43 BRAF mutation-positive tumors, we classified 26 as presumptive heterozygous. Eight cases were indeterminate. Surprisingly, 9 cases appeared to contain an excess of the mutant allele. BRAF fluorescence in situ hybridization on these 9 cases suggested the increased amount of the mutant BRAF allele was due to amplification (2 cases) or chromosome 7 polysomy (7 cases). We have previously described the presence of the c-kit-activating mutation, L576P, in 2 of 100 malignant melanomas. In this report, we have evaluated an additional 53 cases and found 1 additional case that contained the L576P mutation. Evaluation of the DNA sequencing electropherograms from all 3 cases of L576P mutation-positive melanoma suggests a selective loss of the normal allele. Fluorescence in situ hybridization for c-kit on these 3 L576P mutation-positive tumors indicated that one showed slight amplification of the c-kit gene and the other 2 were present in a nonamplified diploid state. These results have important implications concerning the mechanism of oncogenesis in melanoma as well as in the response of the tumor to anticancer drugs targeting BRAF or c-kit.",

Tumors grown in SCID mice injected with human melanoma carrying activated N-ras genes were significantly larger (p < 0.004) than tumors grown in animals injected with the appropriate control transfectants. Additionally, tumors with N-ras point mutations clearly showed a more pleomorphic phenotype than the control groups. Our results, obtained in 2 independent SCID-hu xenotransplantation models, suggest that mutated N-ras oncogene expression may be an important factor influencing growth characteristics of human melanoma without altering metastatic potential.

SKI is upregulated in human malignant melanoma tumors in a disease-progression manner and its overexpression promotes proliferation and migration of melanoma cells in vitro. The mechanisms by which SKI antagonizes TGF-beta signaling in vivo have not been fully elucidated. Here we show that human melanoma cells in which endogenous SKI expression was knocked down by RNAi produced minimal orthotopic tumor xenograft nodules that displayed low mitotic rate and prominent apoptosis. These minute tumors exhibited critical signatures of active TGF-beta signaling including high levels of nuclear Smad3 and p21(Waf-1), which are not found in the parental melanomas. To understand how SKI promotes tumor growth we used gain- and loss-of-function approaches and found that simultaneously to blocking the TGF-beta-growth inhibitory pathway, SKI promotes the switch of Smad3 from tumor suppression to oncogenesis by favoring phosphorylations of the Smad3 linker region in melanoma cells but not in normal human melanocytes. In this context, SKI is required for preventing TGF-beta-mediated downregulation of the oncogenic protein c-MYC, and for inducing the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, a mediator of tumor growth and angiogenesis. Together, the results indicate that SKI exploits multiple regulatory levels of the TGF-beta pathway and its deficiency restores TGF-beta tumor suppressor and apoptotic activities in spite of the likely presence of oncogenic mutations in melanoma tumors.",

We hypothesized that the induction of TA90-IC during postoperative adjuvant CancerVax therapy might indicate vaccine-mediated immune destruction of subclinical melanoma cells with release of TA90, and thereby serve as a surrogate marker of vaccine efficacy.;From 1993 to 1997, 219 melanoma patients were enrolled in a prospective phase II trial of CancerVax plus bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) after complete tumor resection.

Innately resistant tumors display a transcriptional signature (referred to as the IPRES, or innate anti-PD-1 resistance), indicating concurrent up-expression of genes involved in the regulation of mesenchymal transition, cell adhesion, extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis, and wound healing. Notably, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-targeted therapy (MAPK inhibitor) induces similar signatures in melanoma, suggesting that a non-genomic form of MAPK inhibitor resistance mediates cross-resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. Validation of the IPRES in other independent tumor cohorts defines a transcriptomic subset across distinct types of advanced cancer.

We screened 80 individuals with at least two primary cutaneous melanomas, who were identified mainly by a search of a regional cancer registry, for germ-line CDKN2A mutations. In nine patients, CDKN2A alterations that may contribute to melanoma predisposition were detected. In six individuals with a family history of melanoma, the 113insR founder mutation was present. One patient, who also had a family history of melanoma, had a 24-bp deletion that included codons 62-69. An in vitro binding assay established that the resulting mutant p16 protein was unable to bind cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and cyclin-dependent kinase 6. Two patients without a family history of melanoma had CDKN2A alterations: (a) one had a mutation in the 5' noncoding sequence (-14C/T); and (b) the other had an insertion of an extra T in codon 28, which results in a stop signal in codon 43. The median age at diagnosis of the first melanoma was significantly lower, the number of primary melanomas was significantly higher, and the presence of a family history of melanoma was significantly more common in patients with CDKN2A mutations than in those without germ-line mutations. The proportion of CDKN2A mutation carriers was significantly higher among patients treated for three or more primary melanomas compared with those with two tumors only. We conclude that mutation screening of individuals with multiple primary melanomas is a useful strategy to identify new melanoma kindreds with CDKN2A germ-line mutations.",

Adjuvant therapy decisions may be informed by careful consideration of prognostic factors. High-dose adjuvant interferon alpha-2b increases disease-free survival and may modestly improve overall survival. Less toxic alternatives for adjuvant therapy are currently under study. External beam radiation therapy is an option for nodal beds where the risk of local recurrence is very high. In-transit melanoma metastases may be treated locally with surgery, immunotherapy, radiation, or heated limb perfusion. For metastatic melanoma, the options include chemotherapy or immunotherapy; targeted anti-BRAF and anti-KIT therapy is under active investigation. Standard chemotherapy yields objective tumor responses in approximately 10%-20% of patients, and sustained remissions are uncommon. Immunotherapy with high-dose interleukin-2 yields objective tumor responses in a minority of patients; however, some of these responses may be durable. Identification of activating mutations of BRAF, NRAS, c-KIT, and GNAQ in distinct clinical subtypes of melanoma suggest that these are molecularly distinct. Emerging data from clinical trials suggest that substantial improvements in the standard of care for melanoma may be possible.",

The data were examined to define optimal test values for assignment of risk. According to this model, patients with lesions greater than 1.75 mm and NANA less than 2 mumol/ml have a more than 12-fold greater risk of recurrence by 2 years than those with lesions less than or equal to 1.75 mm and NANA less than or equal to 2 mumol/ml.",

More recently, gene expression profiling has provided a highly accurate and biologically informative gold standard for molecular prognostication. The latest step in the evolution of molecular testing has been the recent discovery of major driver mutations that allow predictive testing of response to targeted molecular therapies. Mutations in GNAQ and GNA11 are early events that promote cell proliferation, and these mutations are sensitive to MAPK kinase, PKC, and AKT inhibitors. Mutations in BAP1, SF3B1, and EIF1AX are later events that are largely mutually exclusive. Mutations in BAP1 are strongly associated with metastasis, whereas those in SF3B1 and EIF1AX are associated with good prognosis. Uveal melanomas with BAP1 mutations demonstrate sensitivity to epigenetic modulators, such as histone deacetylase inhibitors.

By contrast, BRAF mutations in melanomas on chronically sun-damaged skin (1 of 12 patients) and melanomas on skin relatively or completely unexposed to sun, such as palms, soles, subungual sites (6 of 39 patients), and mucosal membranes (2 of 21 patients) are rare. We found no association of mutation status with clinical outcome or with the presence of an associated melanocytic nevus. The mutated BRAF allele was frequently found at an elevated copy number, implicating BRAF as one of the factors driving selection for the frequent copy number increases of chromosome 7q in melanoma.

        "Doc_abstract":"Cancer cells have abnormal cell cycle regulation which favors accelerated proliferation, chromosomal instability, and resistance to the senescence response. Although the p16INK4a locus is the most prominent susceptibility locus for familial melanomas, the low frequency of p16 mutations in sporadic melanomas suggests additional alterations in other cell cycle regulatory genes. Here we used primary melanoma tumors to reveal early cell cycle alterations that could be masked in advanced metastatic lesions due to their inherently high genetic instability. Unexpectedly, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p27KIP1 and/or p21Waf-1/SDI-1 were found to be expressed in 13 of 18 (72%) of the primary melanomas with a Breslow thickness greater than 0.076 mm. In general, p27 and/or p21 staining in the primary tumors correlated with low Ki-67 index. Importantly, most of the p21- and p27-positive tumors expressed high levels of cyclin D1 and cyclin E. In proliferating cells p27 is predominantly associated with cyclin D-CDK4 complexes, but does not inhibit the kinase activity, whereas in quiescent cells p27 is found associated with inactive CDK2 complexes. p27 was also expressed at high levels in proliferating primary melanomas in culture, and found to be associated with active cyclin E-CDK2 complexes containing high levels of cyclin E. It is thus likely that accumulation of cyclin E overcomes the potent inhibitory activity of p27 and p21 in CDK2 complexes. Of the primary melanomas with no indication of invasiveness, only three of 15 (20%) were positive for p27 and/or p21. We propose that high levels of p27 and p21 may confer upon melanoma tumors their characteristic resistance to conventional therapies. In turn, high levels of cyclins E and D1 may contribute to unlimited proliferation in primary melanomas that express the tumor suppressor p16INK4. J Invest Dermatol 113:1039-1046 1999",

Atypical nevi have been clinically considered to be precursors of melanoma, and recently, biochemical abnormalities have been found that are present in both nevi and melanomas, including inactivation of the p16INK4a tumor suppressor gene and mutations in B-raf. These mutations suggest not only that nevi and melanomas share a common origin but also that additional events are required for transformation to malignant melanoma.;We performed a Panomics protein array comparing a radial growth melanoma cell line with a vertical growth melanoma cell line and found that the transcription factor Wilms tumor 1 is highly expressed in the vertical growth cell line compared with the radial growth cell line.

In a population-based case series from North Carolina, 214 first primary invasive melanoma patients in the year 2000 were interviewed regarding their risk factors. Ambient solar UV exposures were estimated using residential histories and a satellite-based model. Cases were grouped on the basis of BRAF and NRAS somatic mutations, determined using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and radiolabeled DNA sequencing, and the risk profiles of these groups were compared. Mutually exclusive BRAF-mutant and NRAS-mutant cases occurred at frequencies of 43.0% and 13.6% with mean ages at diagnosis of 47.3 and 62.1 years, respectively. Tumors from patients with >14 back nevi were more likely to harbor either a BRAF mutation [age-adjusted odds ratio (OR), 3.2; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.4-7.0] or an NRAS mutation (age-adjusted OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.6-4.8) compared with patients with 0 to 4 back nevi. However, BRAF-mutant and NRAS-mutant tumors were distinctive in that BRAF-mutant tumors were characteristic of patients with high early-life ambient UV exposure (adjusted OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.2-5.3). When ambient UV irradiance was analyzed by decadal age, high exposure at ages 0 to 20 years was associated with BRAF-mutant cases, whereas high exposure at ages 50 and 60 years was characteristic of NRAS-mutant cases. Our results suggest that although nevus propensity is important for the occurrence of both BRAF and NRAS-mutant melanomas, ambient UV irradiance influences risk differently based on the age of exposure. The association of BRAF mutations with early-life UV exposure provides evidence in support of childhood sun protection for melanoma prevention.",

In 7 cases the tumor infiltrated the optic nerve. Expression of p16 was studied by immunohistochemistry and recorded by assessment of the proportion of positive tumor cells and staining intensity. Results were expressed as staining index (IRS). Intragenic mutations were studied by PCR-SSCP followed by sequencing, while hypermethylation of the promoter region by CpG methylation assay. In 15% of cases less than 10% of melanoma cells were p16 positive, in 70% of cases less than 50% of cells, while in 7% more than 80% of cells stained for p16 (mean IRS for all cases was 4.87 +/- 2.43).

We have previously shown that p42/p44 MAP kinase is activated in radial growth melanoma, suggesting that further signaling events are required for vertical growth melanoma. The molecular events that accompany this transformation are not well understood. Akt, a signaling molecule downstream of PI3K, was introduced into the radial growth WM35 melanoma in order to test whether Akt overexpression is sufficient to accomplish this transformation. Overexpression of Akt led to upregulation of VEGF, increased production of superoxide ROS, and the switch to a more pronounced glycolytic metabolism. Subcutaneous implantation of WM35 cells overexpressing Akt led to rapidly growing tumors in vivo, while vector control cells did not form tumors. We demonstrated that Akt was associated with malignant transformation of melanoma through at least 2 mechanisms. First, Akt may stabilize cells with extensive mitochondrial DNA mutation, which can generate ROS. Second, Akt can induce expression of the ROS-generating enzyme NOX4. Akt thus serves as a molecular switch that increases angiogenesis and the generation of superoxide, fostering more aggressive tumor behavior. Targeting Akt and ROS may be of therapeutic importance in treatment of advanced melanoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Ags derived from commonly mutated oncogenic proteins seem ideally suited as targets for tumor immunotherapy. Nonetheless, only a few mutated epitopes efficiently presented by human tumors have thus far been identified. We describe here an approach to identify such epitopes. This approach involves: 1) identifying tumors expressing a ras mutation and isolating the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL); 2) transfecting COS cells to induce expression of unknown mutated peptides in the context of a patient's HLA class I molecules; and 3) screening epitope recognition by using TIL from the tumors expressing a ras mutation. By using this approach, there appeared to be a N-ras mutation (a glutamine-to-arginine exchange at residue 61 (Q61R)), detected in a melanoma lesion, which was recognized specifically by the autologous TIL in the HLA-A*0101 context. The ras peptide 55-64(Q61R) was the epitope of these TIL and was regularly presented by Q61R-mutated HLA-A*0101(+) melanoma cell lines. This peptide and its wild-type homolog (55-64(wt)) bound to HLA-A*0101 with similar affinities. However, only the mutated peptide could induce specific CTL expansion from PBL. All the CTL clones specific to the mutated peptide, failed to recognize the wild-type sequence on both COS and melanoma cells. These data thus show that oncogenic protein mutations can create shared tumor-specific CTL epitopes, efficiently presented by tumor cells, and that screening for oncogene-transfected COS cell recognition by TIL (from tumors containing mutations) is a powerful approach for the identification of these epitopes.",

At presentation, more than half of studied cases (56.5%) presented with nodal metastases at diagnosis while about three fourths (74%) had distant metastases (stage IV disease). More than half (56%) of the patients had superficial spreading type. The most common presenting complaints were swelling (70% of patients), ulcer (50% of patients) or pain (50%). Primary sites included extremities, central nervous system, abdomen, trunk, and bones. Liver, brain, abdomen and lungs were common metastatic sites. Surgical excision of primary lesion was done in about half of the cases. Four patients subsequently received palliative radiotherapy and two more received adjuvant radiotherapy. Another six patients received adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Among treated patients, 26% showed partial response and another 8% have stable disease while 65% patients progressed on or after initial treatment.;Malignant melanoma carries an overall poor prognosis especially in advanced stages.

Oral and/or mucosal melanoma has been routinely considered an extremely malignant tumor with a high degree of local invasiveness and high metastatic propensity. Primary tumor size has been found to be extremely prognostic. The World Health Organization staging scheme for dogs with oral melanoma is based on size, with stage I = <2-cm-diameter tumor, stage II = 2- to <4-cm-diameter tumor, stage III = > or = 4cm tumor and/or lymph node metastasis, and stage IV = distant metastasis. Median survival times for dogs with oral melanoma treated with surgery are approximately 17 to 18, 5 to 6, and 3 months with stage I, II, and III disease, respectively. Significant negative prognostic factors include stage, size, evidence of metastasis, and a variety of histologic criteria. Standardized treatments such as surgery, coarse-fractionation radiation therapy, and chemotherapy have afforded minimal to modest stage-dependent clinical benefits and death is usually due to systemic metastasis. Numerous immunotherapeutic strategies have been employed to date with limited clinical efficacy; however, the use of xenogeneic DNA vaccines may represent a leap forward in clinical efficacy. Oral melanoma is a spontaneous syngeneic cancer occurring in outbred, immunocompetent dogs and appears to be a more clinically faithful therapeutic model for human melanoma; further use of canine melanoma as a therapeutic model for human melanoma is strongly encouraged. In addition, the development of an expanded but clinically relevant staging system incorporating the aforementioned prognostic factors is also strongly encouraged.",

We have established an efficient method for extraction and reverse transcription of tyrosinase mRNA from paraffin sections that permits the close correlation of the RT-PCR results with (immuno)histologic findings in adjacent sections. One hundred fifty-three SLNs and 6 non-SLN specimens originating from 92 melanoma and 4 nonmelanoma patients were studied to test the reliability of this approach. The predictive value of positive RT-PCR results was 0.98 for the presence of melanoma or nevus cells; the corresponding negative predictive value was 0.83. Furthermore, the detection rate of tyrosinase mRNA significantly correlated with tumor burden. Among the 33 melanoma-positive SLNs without nevus cells, positive RT-PCR results were obtained in all specimens with extended peripheral (S2) or deeply invasive (S3) micrometastases but in only 46% of the cases with few localized melanoma cells in the subcapsular zone (S1). Routine (immuno)histologic evaluation alone had missed microclusters of melanoma cells in one SLN and small nevus cell aggregates in six other SLNs. They were detected only during microscopic reexamination caused by a positive RT-PCR result. We conclude that histology and immunohistochemistry remain the indispensable gold standard for the identification of melanoma and nevus cells in SLNs. Additional molecular analyses using adjacent paraffin sections may further improve the diagnostic accuracy by sensitizing and guiding the microscopist's attention.",

Historically, systemic therapies have been largely ineffective, because melanoma is usually resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapy. However, during the past few years, several targeted therapies have proved effective in this challenging disease. These recent advances have been facilitated by an improved understanding of the driving genetic aberrations of melanoma, particularly mutations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Vemurafenib, a BRAF inhibitor, demonstrated an overall survival advantage in phase III trials and is an appropriate option for first-line therapy in metastatic BRAF mutant melanoma. Dabrafenib, another BRAF inhibitor, and trametinib, a MEK inhibitor, also have been shown to be effective in phase III trials for BRAF mutant melanoma and may be additional treatment options as monotherapy or in combination pending regulatory approval. Additionally, imatinib is a promising targeted therapy for patients whose tumors harbor a KIT mutation in exons 11 and 13. Although these targeted agents cause objective responses and clinical benefit in patients with metastatic melanoma, resistance invariably develops. New targets and strategies to overcome acquired resistance are urgently needed. Furthermore, no effective targeted therapy has been developed for NRAS mutant tumors or in melanomas with as yet unknown driver mutations.

The incidence of cutaneous melanoma, despite improved prevention and early diagnosis of precursor melanocytic lesions, is on the increase with a projection that one in 75 persons born in the year 2000 will develop cutaneous melanoma in his/her lifetime. With cutaneous melanoma, the number, location and type of nevi, sun exposure and inability to tan, and presence or absence of dysplastic nevi affect transformation to a malignant process. Certain familial factors, syndromes, cytogenetic abnormalities, and mutations in tumor suppressor genes also influence tumor formation. In contrast, mucosal melanoma involving the oral cavity and head and neck regions is not as well understood or characterized. No doubt, this is due to the fact that this subtype of melanoma accounts for less than 1% of all cases. Mucosal melanomas tend to present at a higher stage, are more aggressive, and in a vertical growth phase of disease. A definitive precursor lesion for mucosal melanoma has not been identified; however, atypical melanocytic hyperplasia may represent a proliferative phase before overt tumorigenesis occurs. Melanoma-related antigens, growth factors, and proliferation markers have been identified in cutaneous melanoma, and allow for development of immunotherapy directed against melanoma-associated entities. It is currently possible to evaluate the cytogenetic make-up of precursor melanocytic lesions and frank melanoma, and the constitutional genetic background of individuals at risk for melanoma. No doubt, as concerted investigations of mucosal melanomas of the oral cavity and head and neck evolve, similar factors will be identified which will direct therapy and predict recurrence and survival.

Here we show that loss of stromal antigen 2 (STAG2) or STAG3, which encode subunits of the cohesin complex, in melanoma cells results in resistance to BRAFi. We identified loss-of-function mutations in STAG2, as well as decreased expression of STAG2 or STAG3 proteins in several tumor samples from patients with acquired resistance to BRAFi and in BRAFi-resistant melanoma cell lines. Knockdown of STAG2 or STAG3 expression decreased sensitivity of BRAF(Val600Glu)-mutant melanoma cells and xenograft tumors to BRAFi. Loss of STAG2 inhibited CCCTC-binding-factor-mediated expression of dual specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), leading to reactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling (via the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2; hereafter referred to as ERK). Our studies unveil a previously unknown genetic mechanism of BRAFi resistance and provide new insights into the tumor suppressor function of STAG2 and STAG3. ",

However, it is currently unknown whether these LMNs harbor mutations in BAP1, SF3B1 and/or EIF1AX like uveal melanomas as well. In this study, we used Sanger sequencing for the detection of mutations in SF3B1 (hotspots in exon 14 and 15) and EIF1AX (exon 1 and 2 and flanking intronic regions) in a series of 24 primary LMNs. Additionally, BAP1 immunohistochemistry was used as a surrogate marker for the detection of inactivating mutations in the BAP1 gene.;Mutations in either SF3B1 or EIF1AX were identified in 8 out of 24 primary LMNs (33 %). The presence of these mutations was mutually exclusive and occurred in primary LMNs of different malignancy grades (melanocytomas, intermediate-grade melanocytic tumors, melanomas). Complete absence of nuclear BAP1 staining as is typically seen in BAP1-mutated tumors was not observed.;Our finding that an SF3B1 or EIF1AX mutation is present in a substantial subset of primary LMNs underscores that these tumors genetically resemble uveal melanoma and are different from cutaneous melanoma at the genetic level. This information may not only aid in the differential diagnosis of primary versus metastatic melanocytic tumor in/around the central nervous system, but also in the identification of more promising therapeutic approaches targeting the molecular pathways involved in the oncogenesis of LMNs. As none of the primary LMNs in our series showed complete loss of nuclear BAP1 protein, it is unlikely that BAP1 mutations are frequent in these tumors but the role of this gene warrants further investigation.",

We investigated primary tumors of 437 patients diagnosed between 1989 and 2006 by Sanger sequencing. Mutations were detected in 38.7% of patients and were associated with age, histological subtype as well as mitotic rate. The mutational rate was 36.7% in patients with disease-free course and 51.7% in those with subsequent distant metastasis (p = 0.031). No difference in overall survival (p = 0.119) but a trend for worse distant-metastasis-free survival (p = 0.061) was observed in BRAF mutant compared to BRAF wild-type patients. Independent prognostic factors for overall survival were tumor thickness, mitotic rate and ulceration. An interesting significant prognostic impact was observed in patients with tumor thickness of 1 mm or less, with the mutation present in 6 of 7 patients dying from melanoma. In conclusion, no significant survival differences were found according to BRAF-V600 tumor mutations in patients with primary melanoma but an increasing impact of the mutational status was observed in the subgroup of patients with tumor thickness of 1 mm or less. A potential role of the mutational status as a prognostic factor especially in this subgroup needs to be investigated in larger studies.",

The amino- and carboxy-terminal domains of the protein, outside the ankyrin-like repeats, appeared to be dispensable, but the majority of the premature termination mutations led to loss of function. Of the missense mutations tested, four displayed clear loss of function whereas two behaved like the wild type under all conditions tested. The remaining two mutations, a G-to-W mutation at position 101 (Gl01W) and V126D, both of which are associated with familial melanoma, were found to be temperature sensitive for binding to Cdk4 and Cdk6 in vitro, for inhibiting cyclin D1-Cdk4 in a reconstituted pRb-kinase assay, and for increasing the proportion of G1-phase cells following transfection.

In this study, we analysed 20 ciliary body and 30 choroidal melanomas using a nested PCR-based technique resulting in the amplification of a nested product only if the mutation was present. This sensitive technique can identify mutated DNA in the presence of wild-type DNA. The mutation was identified in 4 of 20 (20%) ciliary body and 11 of 30 (40%) choroidal melanomas. Further analysis of separate areas within the same choroidal melanoma demonstrated that the mutation was not present in the entire tumour.

We found a novel germline mutation, POLE p.(Trp347Cys), in a 7-case cutaneous melanoma family.

Although this frequency is not significantly higher than that in unselected Caucasian controls, we observed multiple cancer types in the melanoma families, suggesting that some germline POLE mutations may predispose to a broad spectrum of cancers, including melanoma.

As cell fusion has been implicated to facilitate the alteration of a cell's phenotype, we hypothesized that cells in the peritumoral stroma having a stromal phenotype that initiate recurrent tumors might originate from the fusion of tumor and stromal cells. Here, we show that in patients with BRAF(V600E) melanoma, melanoma antigen recognized by T-cells (MART1)-negative peritumoral stromal cells express BRAF(V600E) protein. To confirm the presence of the oncogene at the genetic level, peritumoral stromal cells were microdissected and screened for the presence of BRAF(V600E) with a mutation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Interestingly, cells carrying the BRAF(V600E) mutation were not only found among cells surrounding the primary tumor but were also present in the stroma of melanoma metastases as well as in a histologically tumor-free re-excision sample from a patient who subsequently developed a local recurrence. We did not detect any BRAF(V600E) mutation or protein in the peritumoral stroma of BRAF(WT) melanoma. Therefore, our results suggest that peritumoral stromal cells contain melanoma-derived oncogenic information, potentially as a result of cell fusion. These hybrid cells display the phenotype of stromal cells and are therefore undetectable using routine histological assessments.

The responses can be long lasting, but the number of patients who benefit from these molecules remains limited. Combinations of these agents with cytotoxic and biologic agents are being investigated as a means to increase response rates and in an attempt to broaden application to other cancer types. Rare responses to cancer vaccines suggest that a better understanding of the underlying biology and mechanism of actions may lead to wider application in the future. The most effective form of immunotherapy thus far, capable of eradicating large tumor burdens in melanoma patients, is the ACT of TIL given to patients after lymphodepletion. As an alternative, lymphocytes engineered to recognize tumor-associated antigens can be safely infused to patients.

Melanoma is a heterogeneous tumor, with most patients harboring mutations in the BRAF or NRAS oncogenes, leading to the overactivation of the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways. The current therapeutic approaches are based on therapies targeting mutated BRAF and the downstream pathway, and on monoclonal antibodies against the immune checkpoint blockade. However, treatment resistance and side effects are common events of these therapeutic strategies. Increasing evidence supports that melanoma is a hormone-related cancer. Melanoma incidence is higher in males than in females, and females have a significant survival advantage over men. Estrogens exert their effects through estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ) that affect cancer growth in an opposite way: ERα is associated with a proliferative action and ERβ with an anticancer effect. ERβ is the predominant ER in melanoma, and its expression decreases in melanoma progression, supporting its role as a tumor suppressor. Thus, ERβ is now considered as an effective molecular target for melanoma treatment. 17β-estradiol was reported to inhibit melanoma cells proliferation; however, clinical trials did not provide the expected survival benefits.

Accordingly, BRAF inhibitors such as Vemurafenib show a good anti-tumorigenic effect on metastases with the BRAF(V600E) mutation. Although an initial period of sustained tumor regression is usually observed after Vemurafenib treatment, tumors often relapse at the same site, and apoptosis induction of melanoma cells in vitro is incomplete. Here, we demonstrate, using a large panel of melanoma cell lines, that Vemurafenib induces features of stress-induced senescence in addition to apoptosis. This senescence phenotype is characterized by heterochromatin formation, changes in cell shape, and increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity. Importantly, senescence features induced by BRAF(V600E) inhibition was also detected in human melanoma cells xenografted into nude mice. Our observations provide a possible explanation for the lack of complete and durable pro-apoptotic effect of Vemurafenib in patients.",

In colorectal tumors, high-frequency microsatellite instability is strictly associated with inactivation of the DNA mismatch repair genes hMSH2, hMLH1, or hPMS2, whereas mutations in the mismatch repair gene hMSH6 have been identified in a subset of tumors with low-frequency microsatellite instability. In addition to epithelial tumors of the colon, endometrium, and ovary, microsatellite instability has been reported to occur also in sporadic melanoma. The relationship between microsatellite instability and mismatch repair in melanoma cells, however, has not been investigated so far. In this study, we analyzed microsatellite instability, mismatch repair activity, and expression of the hMSH2, hMSH6, hMLH1, and hPMS2 proteins in five melanoma cell lines and in tumor specimens from which the cells were derived. Four cell lines displayed normal levels of mismatch repair activity and expressed all the mismatch repair proteins. The extracts of the fifth cell line lacked the hMLH1 and hPMS2 proteins, and were correspondingly deficient in the repair of DNA mismatches. This line displayed high-frequency microsatellite instability, whereas the four mismatch-repair-proficient cell lines displayed either no or low-frequency microsatellite instability. These findings could be confirmed in the tumor specimens, in that only the tumor that did not express hMLH1 and hPMS2 displayed high-frequency microsatellite instability. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that in melanoma, similarly to epithelial tumors, only the high-frequency microsatellite instability phenotype is strictly dependent on a defective mismatch repair system. Further studies on a large series of tumor specimens are required to establish the frequency of mismatch repair loss in human melanoma.",

These undesirable diseases become a major social and economic burden. As both primary and secondary bone tumors develop in the unique bone tissue, it is therefore necessary to understand bone cell biology in tumor bone environment. Recent findings of the Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL)/RANK/osteoprotegerin (OPG) molecular triad, the key regulators of bone remodeling, opened new era of bone research. Although RANK is an essential receptor for osteoclast formation, activation and survival, functional RANK expression has been recently identified on several bone-associated tumor cells. When RANK is expressed on secondary bone tumor cells, it is implicated in tumor cell migration, whereas this is not the case for primary bone tumors. In any case, RANK is not involved in RANK-positive cell proliferation or death. In two models of bone metastases secondary to melanoma or prostate carcinoma, in vivo neutralization of RANKL by OPG resulted in complete protection from paralysis, due to metastases of vertebral body, and a marked reduction in tumor burden in bones, but not in other organs. OPG also decreased tumor formation and tumor burden in a mouse model of primary bone tumor, osteosarcoma. In all these models, tumor cells express RANK. These data revealed that local differentiation factors, such as RANKL, play an important role in cell migration in a metastatic tissue-specific manner. These findings substantiate the novel direct role of RANKL/RANK in bone-associated tumors, and its capability of representing new therapeutic targets.",

Depending on the challenge and the context, constitutively expressed COX-1 or the transiently induced COX-2 isoform are of relevance. Moreover, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of skin is a prominent example of epithelial neoplasia that consistently overexpresses COX-2 in the parenchyme and the mesenchyme of premalignant and malignant lesions, while COX-1 expression remains unaltered. Pharmacological, clinical, and experimental animal studies as well as a few epidemiological studies document the importance of PG signaling in non-melanoma skin cancer including SCC and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in humans and mice. Increased levels of PGE(2) and PGF(2α) in premalignant and/or malignant epithelial skin cancers are due to the constitutive upregulation of enzymes involved in PG biosynthesis, such as COX-2, and downregulation of the tumor suppressor gene 15-hydroxy-prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH), which is involved in the inactivation of PG, thus counteracting the activities of COX. Most remarkably, genetic studies show that mice which are deficient in COX-2 or COX-1 are protected from the development of SCC when applying the multi-stage chemical carcinogenesis protocol. Conversely, the forced overexpression of COX-2 in the proliferative basal compartment of the stratified skin epidermis results in spontaneous hyperplasia and dysplasia in transgenic mice and furthermore a sensitization for cancer development by conferring an auto-promoted skin phenotype. In multi-stage carcinogenesis, it also becomes clear that aberrant COX-2 overexpression and activity are causally involved in tumor promotion and tumor progression rather than initiation. In contrast, using as inducer of carcinogenesis the complete carcinogen UV B light, depletion of COX-2 but not of COX-1 makes mouse skin resistant for SCC, indicating that here, only COX-2 is essential. Depending on the type of challenge, COX-2-dependent signaling contributes to the pre-invasive growth of the skin epidermis by a delayed onset of terminal differentiation, or stimulation of hyperproliferation and survival. With respect to BCC, the genetic ablation of COX-2 but also of COX-1 leads to a strongly reduced tumor burden in the skin of Patched (Ptch)1(+/-) mice, which due to the deletion of a Ptch1 allele, spontaneously develop BCC resembling human familial basal cell nevus syndrome and sporadic BCC. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and the COX-2-selective inhibitors (COXibs) exhibit impressive efficacy inhibiting tumor burden in various mouse models of SCC and BCC. Most importantly, in humans the interruption of COX-2 signaling is an effective strategy to treat and chemo-prevent non-melanoma skin cancer in individuals who are at high risk for the disease. However, any potential beneficial effect of this medicine has to be balanced against the adverse effects that are known to be associated with these drugs in a subset of patients.",

Targeting just a few out of several potential mutations, BRAF-Inhibitors such as PLX 4032 achieved already tremendous results in the therapy of metastatic melanoma. Up to now, the correlation of clinical, histomorphologic, and genetic features is, however, not understood.

We analyzed 97 patients who were pathologically confirmed with mucosal or acral melanoma between 1997 and 2010 at Samsung Medical Center. Of the 97 melanoma patients, 92 were screened for mutations in KIT exons 11, 13, 17, and 18, BRAF and NRAS genes. KIT copy number was assessed by quantitative, real-time PCR. Of the 97 patients, 55 (56.7%) were mucosal, 40 (41.2%) were acral melanoma, and two were of unknown primary origin. Among seven cases with KIT mutation, five (60.0%) occurred in exon 11, one (20.0%) in exon 17, and one (20.0%) in exon 13. Point mutations were the most common, resulting in substitutions in exon 11 (K558R, T574A, L576P, and V559A), exon 13 (N655K), and exon 17 (N822K). A novel Thr574Ala (c.1720A>G) KIT mutation, which has not been reported in melanoma or other tumor types, was identified in one genital melanoma case.

Histopathologic examination of the scalp lesion demonstrated a tumor nodule composed of sheets and nests of large round to polygonal cells centered about a hair follicle and within follicular epithelium. BRAF V600E gene mutation was documented in this lesion, and the patient received vemurafenib, with dramatic improvement noted on positron emission tomography scan after 2 months of treatment, soon followed by development of extensive metastases, including to brain. Although BRAF mutations have been found in primary and metastatic melanomas of the skin, and in melanoma metastases of extracutaneous sites, to our knowledge, this is the first case of a BRAF mutation documented in folliculotropic metastatic melanoma.",

The recent identification of causative genetic alterations has revealed mutations in signaling pathways that offer targets for therapy. Identifying morphologic surrogates that can identify patients whose tumors express such alterations (or functionally equivalent alterations) would be clinically useful for therapy stratification and for retrospective analysis of clinical trial data.;We defined and assessed a panel of histomorphologic measures and correlated them with the mutation status of the oncogenes BRAF and NRAS in a cohort of 302 archival tissues of primary cutaneous melanomas from an academic comprehensive cancer center. Melanomas with BRAF mutations showed distinct morphological features such as increased upward migration and nest formation of intraepidermal melanocytes, thickening of the involved epidermis, and sharper demarcation to the surrounding skin; and they had larger, rounder, and more pigmented tumor cells (all p-values below 0.0001). By contrast, melanomas with NRAS mutations could not be distinguished based on these morphological features. Using simple combinations of features, BRAF mutation status could be predicted with up to 90.8% accuracy in the entire cohort as well as within the categories of the current World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Among the variables routinely recorded in cancer registries, we identified age < 55 y as the single most predictive factor of BRAF mutation in our cohort. Using age < 55 y as a surrogate for BRAF mutation in an independent cohort of 4,785 patients of the Southern German Tumor Registry, we found a significant survival benefit (p < 0.0001) for patients who, based on their age, were predicted to have BRAF mutant melanomas in 69% of the cases. This group also showed a different pattern of metastasis, more frequently involving regional lymph nodes, compared to the patients predicted to have no BRAF mutation and who more frequently displayed satellite, in-transit metastasis, and visceral metastasis (p < 0.0001).;Refined morphological classification of primary melanomas can be used to improve existing melanoma classifications by forming subgroups that are genetically more homogeneous and likely to differ in important clinical variables such as outcome and pattern of metastasis.

In this article, we describe the comprehensive screening of 109 English and 26 Australian melanoma pedigrees for intronic mutations of CDKN2A.

The consideration of models of cancer progression is therefore important to understand the essence of this disease. Previous work has suggested that melanoma may propagate according to a cancer stem cell (CSC) model in which rare tumorigenic and bulk non-tumorigenic cells are organized into stable hierarchies within tumors. However, recent studies using assays that are more permissive for revealing tumorigenic potential indicate that it will not be possible to cure patients by focusing research and therapy on rare populations of cells within melanoma tumors. Studies of the nature of tumorigenic melanoma cells reveal that these cells may gain a growth, metastasis and/or therapy resistance advantage by acquiring new genetic mutations and by reversible epigenetic mechanisms. In this light, efforts to link the phenotypes, genotypes and epigenotypes of melanoma cells with differences in their in vivo malignant potential provide the greatest hope of advancing the exciting progress finally being made against this disease.",

Further mutations which can be approached by targeted therapies are found on the c-Kit and NRAS genes. Another promising approach is immunotherapy aimed to activate cytotoxic T cells.

However, the relationship between KIT and melanoma histology remains uncharacterized, and its role in melanoma pathogenesis unknown. We evaluated 70 melanomas from 70 patients seen at a single institution from 1997 to 2008. Cases were analyzed for KIT protein expression relative to histologic variables: subtype, sun damage, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, melanoma in situ, vertical growth phase (VGP), location, and hyperpigmentation. Twenty-eight cases demonstrated 3+ membranous staining. Univariate analysis revealed 5 significant variables: sun damage (inverse, P = 0.015), tumor location (trunk>extremities>head and neck, P = 0.005), subtype (epithelioid>spindle, mixed>desmoplastic, P < 0.001), VGP (inverse, P = 0.024), and hyperpigmentation [22/26 (85% hyperpigmented cases) and 6/44 (14% nonhyperpigmented cases), P < 0.001]. Upon multivariate analysis, only hyperpigmentation and VGP remained statistically significant (P = 0.002, P = 0.019). Mutational analyses for KIT exons 9 and 11, and BRAF were performed on cases with 3+ labeling. Two of 27 of cases contained mutations in KIT exon 11, whereas only 1 case contained a V600E BRAF mutation, suggesting that KIT and BRAF mutations may be redundant events. Although KIT mutations were uncommon overall, pigmentation in conjunction with immunohistochemistry and nodular growth phase raised their frequency to 2 (40%) of 5 cases. We expand the context of KIT aberrations to involve areas other than acral and mucosal sites and demonstrate an inverse relationship between KIT abnormalities and sun damage.

Regardless of that important issue, recognition of the tumor by the immune system implicitly contains the idea of the tumor antigen, which is what is actually recognized. We review the molecular identity of all forms of tumor antigens (antigens with specific mutations, cancer-testis antigens, differentiation antigens, over-expressed antigens) and discuss the use of these multiple forms of antigens in experimental immunotherapy of mouse and human melanoma. These efforts have been uniformly unsuccessful; however, the approaches that have not worked or have somewhat worked have been the source of many new insights into melanoma immunology.

C57BL/6-c2j has the same genetic background as TG-3 (C57BL/6), except for a single base mutation (nucleotide 291) in the tyrosinase locus, resulting in albino coat colour. Only albino F2 mice generated from (TG-3 x C57BL/6-c2j) F1s were selected for further studies. Mice that contained the transgene showed a very high incidence of tumor development as early as 4-6 weeks of age. Raised amelanotic tumors developed on the ear pinnae and perianal region in young F2 albino mice, similar phenotypes as those described earlier for the other albino inbred strains. However, with time, these amelanotic tumors not only increased in size, but unexpectedly developed foci of dark pigmentation. DNA sequence analysis on reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCRs) of tyrosinase mRNA showed that the original tyrosinase mutation was still present in the tumors, indicating that no reversion at this nucleotide had occurred in the tumors. Two different tyrosinase activity assays were used and tyrosinase activity was detected in most tumor samples. Furthermore, Western blot analysis demonstrated various levels of tyrosinase protein in ear tumor samples.

Most Dutch melanoma families segregate for a unique founder mutation (p16-Leiden), encoding a truncated nonfunctional p16 protein. The highly variable risk for p16-Leiden carriers to develop melanoma suggests a role for other genetic and/or environmental factors. We hypothesized that a 9p21 gene other than CDKN2A may be relevant in the remaining 9p21-linked melanoma families without p16 mutations but may also act as a risk modifier in p16-Leiden carriers. Haplotype analysis for 9p21 was performed using microsatellite markers in six p16-Leiden families originating from a founder population. p16-Leiden carriers in two families shared an unexpectedly large founder haplotype ( approximately 20-cM) around CDKN2A, mostly in proximal direction. Melanoma-positive p16-Leiden carriers from these families showed this extensive proximal haplotype compared with melanoma-negative p16-Leiden carriers from the same families. Additional p16-Leiden families less heavily affected with melanoma showed shorter haplotypes sharing, excluding the region proximally of CDKN2A. The presence of a gene involved in melanoma susceptibility proximal of CDKN2A is corroborated by somatic deletions of 9p in tumors, which frequently do not include CDKN2A but a more proximal chromosomal area instead.

Current clinical and pathologic categories with the reported genetic abnormalities were related to the latest information on pigment biology. The data extracted were used to develop a conceptual framework on the pathogenesis of melanoma; the generated model was then evaluated and used to suggest potential therapeutic approaches.;(1) Melanoma is not genetically homogeneous, and the existing differences between the pathologic categories, particularly in areas such as type of growth phase (radial vs vertical growth), total vertical dimension, ulceration of primary tumor, and metastatic process, have profound prognostic and therapeutic implications. (2) Chromosomal aberrations and gene mutations are found in sporadic and familial melanomas; among the most important are those affecting the 9p21, which contains the p16 locus, a site known to be critical for normal progression of the cell cycle. Aberrant p16 expression is associated with more aggressive behavior. (3) Melanoma cells possess a remarkable repertoire of biosynthetic capacities represented by the production of hormones, growth factors, and their receptors that may sustain and accelerate tumor development and progression. For example, expression of the tumoral products alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and adrenocorticotropic hormone is regulated in vitro by ultraviolet light, a known carcinogen. (4) Melanomas differ from other tumors in their intrinsic capability to express melanogenic enzymes with the corresponding structural proteins to actually synthesize melanin. Melanogenesis-related proteins are rapidly entering the clinical arena, being used not only as diagnostic markers, but also as potential targets for melanoma therapy.",

One possible cause might be the inhibition of the formation of a functional Fas/CD95-FasL complex by soluble Fas/CD95 molecules (sFas/CD95). In the present study we determined sFas/CD95 serum concentration in 125 melanoma patients of different clinical stages of disease compared with 30 healthy controls using an ELISA. sFas/CD95 serum level was significantly elevated (P < 0.0005) in melanoma patients (mean +/- SE = 8.60 +/- 0.26 ng/ml) compared with healthy controls (mean +/- SE = 6.27 +/- 0.25 ng/ml). Univariate analysis revealed a correlation of sFas/CD95 serum concentration with advanced stages of disease (P = 0.009). Only a slight increase in sFas/CD95 serum level (P = 0.057) could be observed in regard to the tumor burden. Patients undergoing current treatment with cytostatics (n = 18) revealed a strong increase in sFas/CD95 serum level (P < 0.0005), whereas treatment with IFN-alpha alone or combined with cytostatics (n = 19) showed no change in serum sFas/CD95 concentration. According to univariate analysis, elevated sFas/CD95 serum levels were associated with a poor overall (P < 0.005) and a progression-free (P < 0.0005) survival. Multivariate analysis revealed sFas/CD95 serum concentration as an independent predictive factor for progression-free (P = 0.011), but not overall (P = 0.078), survival.

A mild neuraminidase treatment, which removes sialic acid residues from the cell surface glycoproteins, reduces the EPM of both groups of melanoma cells yielding an electrophoretically uniform population. This shows that the differences in the EPM between the subpopulations of pigmented melanoma cells stem from the different content of sialic acid residues on the cell surface. The relationship between the different EPM melanoma cell subpopulations was, therefore, examined during tumor growth, development, and formation of metastases. The relative content of cells having high electrophoretic mobility, the \"fast moving\" cells, increases as the tumors grow larger. However, tumors of the same diameter contain nearly the same fraction of \"fast moving\" cells despite their age. The proportion of the \"fast moving\" cells is significantly higher in the central part than in the outermost layer of pigmented melanoma tumors. These data suggest that the development of \"fast moving\" cells is promoted by some size-dependent changes in the intratumor environment. In vivo selection of melanoma cells for their ability to colonize lungs renders tumors that reveal elevated metastatic potential and contain a significantly higher fraction of cells possessing high electrophoretic mobility than the parent tumor. Moreover, the metastatic nodules contain a remarkably elevated fraction of the \"fast moving\" cells. The reported correlation between the \"fast moving\" cell fraction and the metastatic potential suggests that the relative content of cells having high electrophoretic mobility may determine the metastaticity of pigmented hamster melanoma.",

These molecular anomalies are promising targets for more effective anti-cancer therapies. Some Mek inhibitors showed promising antitumor activity, although schedules and doses associated with low systemic toxicity need to be defined. In addition, it is now accepted that cancers can arise from and be maintained by the cancer stem cells (CSC) or tumor-initiating cells (TIC), commonly expanded in vitro as tumorspheres from several solid tumors, including melanoma (melanospheres). Here, we investigated the potential targeting of MEK pathway by exploiting highly reliable in vitro and in vivo pre-clinical models of melanomas based on melanospheres, as melanoma initiating cells (MIC) surrogates. MEK inhibition, through PD0325901, provided a successful strategy to affect survival of mutated-BRAF melanospheres and growth of wild type-BRAF melanospheres. A marked citotoxicity was observed in differentated melanoma cells regardless BRAF mutational status. PD0325901 treatment, dramatically inhibited growth of melanosphere-generated xenografts and determined impaired tumor vascularization of both mutated- and wild type-BRAF tumors, in the absence of mice toxicity. These results suggest that MEK inhibition might represent a valid treatment option for patients with both mutated- or wild type-BRAF melanomas, affecting tumor growth through multiple targets. ",

A cohort of 57 primary cutaneous T1-2 melanoma tumors was analyzed. Mutation frequency for both genes was 61% (NRAS 26% and BRAF 39%). In a univariate analysis, shorter overall survival was associated with the presence of ulceration (P=0.001) and BRAF exon 15 mutations (P=0.005) as well as the absence of nuclear activation of Akt (P=0.022) and of cytoplasmic activation of ERK (P=0.003). Unexpectedly, ulceration was a significant adverse prognostic factor only in melanomas with BRAF mutations, whereas there was no effect of ulceration on overall survival in tumors with wild-type BRAF. A multivariate analysis showed that significant independent adverse survival prognostic markers were absence of cytoplasmic activation of ERK (P=0.007) and ulceration (P=0.008), whereas BRAF exon 15 mutation status showed a nonsignificant trend (P=0.066). The absence of cytoplasmic ERK activation in poor prognosis T1-2 melanomas may be associated with activation of some other uncharacterized pathway leading to tumor progression and adverse outcome.

In melanoma, proproliferative signals are provided by activating mutations in NRAS and BRAF, whereas senescence is bypassed by inactivation of the p16(Ink4a) gene. Melanomas also frequently exhibit constitutive activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway that is presumed to induce proliferation, as it does in carcinomas. We show here that, contrary to expectations, stabilized beta-catenin reduces the number of melanoblasts in vivo and immortalizes primary skin melanocytes by silencing the p16(Ink4a) promoter. Significantly, in a novel mouse model for melanoma, stabilized beta-catenin bypasses the requirement for p16(Ink4a) mutations and, together with an activated N-Ras oncogene, leads to melanoma with high penetrance and short latency. The results reveal that synergy between the Wnt and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways may represent an important mechanism underpinning the genesis of melanoma, a highly aggressive and increasingly common disease.",

One such pigmentation gene, MC1R, has not only been found to be a low penetrance melanoma gene but has also been shown to act as a genetic modifier of melanoma risk in individuals carrying CDKN2A mutations. Most recently, an environmental agent, ultraviolet radiation, has also been established as a modifier of melanoma risk in CDKN2A mutation carriers.

To determine whether MITF is somatically mutated in melanoma, we compared the sequence of MITF from primary and metastatic lesions to patient-matched normal DNA. In the 50 metastatic melanoma tumor lines analysed, we discovered four samples that had genomic amplifications of MITF and four that had MITF mutations in the regions encoding the transactivation, DNA binding or basic, helix-loop-helix domains. Sequence analysis for SOX10, a transcription factor, which both acts upstream of MITF and synergizes with MITF, identified an additional three samples with frameshift or nonsense mutations. Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor and SOX10 were found to be mutated in a mutually exclusive fashion, possibly suggesting disruption in a common genetic pathway. Taken together we found that over 20% of the metastatic melanoma cases had alterations in the MITF pathway. We show that the MITF pathway is also altered in primary melanomas: 2/26 demonstrated mutations in MITF and 6/55 demonstrated mutations in SOX10. Our findings suggest that altered MITF function during melanomagenesis can be achieved by MITF amplification, MITF single base substitutions or by mutation of its regulator SOX10.",

To correlate BRAF mutation and melanoma progression, we screened BRAF mutations in 65 melanocytic lesions, including nevi, radial growth phase (RGP), vertical growth phase (VGP) melanomas, and melanoma metastases, as well as 25 melanoma cell lines. PCR and direct sequencing were used to analyze DNA samples extracted from laser capture microdissected tissues. A similar high frequency (62-72%) of BRAF oncogenic mutations was identified in melanocytic nevi, VGP, metastatic melanomas, and melanoma cell lines [H. Davies et al., Nature (Lond.), 417: 949-954, 2002; P. M. Pollock et al., Nat. Genet., 33: 19-20, 2002; and M. S. Brose et al., Cancer Res., 62: 6997-7000, 2002]. In striking contrast, we found BRAF lesions in only 10% of the earliest stage or RGP melanomas.

As a second approach, melanoma CSC/TIC are enriched by fluorescence-activated cell sorting for the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzyme activity. We previously showed that melanoma cells with high ALDH activity (ALDH(high)) are endowed with higher self-renewal and tumorigenic abilities than the population with low activity (ALDH(low)), suggesting that ALDH might be a good marker to select for melanoma CSC/TIC.

The aim of this paper is to update clinical results of 7 years of follow-up after the last treated patient. In the trial conducted between December 1993 and January 1999, patients without any detectable metastases after lymph node excision were randomly assigned to receive either TIL plus interleukin-2 (IL-2) for 2 months, or IL-2 only. The duration of the relapse-free interval was the primary objective. Eighty-eight patients were enrolled in the study. Currently, the last analysis performed in June 2006, after a median follow-up of 114.8 months, did not show change of non-significant extension of the relapse-free interval or overall survival. However, this second analysis strengthens our first hypothesis about the relationship between number of invaded lymph nodes and TIL treatment effectiveness. In the group with only one invaded lymph node, the estimated relapse rate was significantly lower (P (adjusted) = 0.0219) and the overall survival was increased (P (adjusted) = 0.0125) in the TIL+IL-2 arm compared with the IL-2 only arm. No differences between the two arms, either with regard to the duration of disease-free survival (P (adjusted) = 0.38) or overall survival (P (adjusted) = 0.43), were noted in the group with more than one invaded lymph node, whatever the number of invaded lymph nodes. Treatment was compatible with normal daily activity. This study, with a very long follow up (median of almost 10 years), postulates for the first time relationship between TIL efficiency in stage III melanoma (AJCC) and number of invaded lymph nodes, indicating that tumor burden might be a crucial factor in the production of an effective in vitro expansion of T cells specific for autologous tumor antigen, a finding which could be of value in future vaccine development for the treatment of melanoma.",

Incidence of melanoma has been increasing for decades. Although ultraviolet radiation (UV) has been identified as the most important environmental causative factor for melanoma development, UV-protective strategies have had limited efficacy in melanoma prevention. UV mutational burden correlates with melanoma development and tumor progression, underscoring the importance of UV in melanomagenesis. However, besides amount of UV exposure, melanocyte UV mutational load is influenced by the robustness of nucleotide excision repair, the genome maintenance pathway charged with removing UV photoproducts before they cause permanent mutations in the genome. In this review, we highlight the importance of the melanocortin hormonal signaling axis on regulating efficiency of nucleotide excision repair in melanocytes. By understanding the molecular mechanisms by which nucleotide excision repair can be increased, it may be possible to prevent many cases of melanoma by reducing UV mutational burden over time.",

Demonstration of patients' T cell responses to BRAF(V600E) would suggest the feasibility of active specific immunotherapy targeting the mutation in these patients. In the present study, BRAF(V600E) peptides with putative binding sites for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2 were used to stimulate T lymphocytes of HLA-A2-positive melanoma patients. Four of five patients with BRAF(V600E)-positive lesions showed lymphoproliferative responses to BRAF(V600E) peptide stimulation. These responses were specific for the mutated epitope and HLA-A2 was restricted in three patients. Lymphocytes from these three patients were cytotoxic against HLA-A2-matched BRAF(V600E)-positive melanoma cells. None of the four patients with BRAF(V600E)-negative lesions and none of five healthy donors had lymphoproliferative responses specific for the mutated epitope.

We sought to identify the core resistance pathways and the extent of tumor heterogeneity during disease progression. We show that mitogen-activated protein kinase reactivation mechanisms were detected among 70% of disease-progressive tissues, with RAS mutations, mutant BRAF amplification, and alternative splicing being most common. We also detected PI3K-PTEN-AKT-upregulating genetic alterations among 22% of progressive melanomas. Distinct molecular lesions in both core drug escape pathways were commonly detected concurrently in the same tumor or among multiple tumors from the same patient. Beyond harboring extensively heterogeneous resistance mechanisms, melanoma regrowth emerging from BRAF inhibitor selection displayed branched evolution marked by altered mutational spectra/signatures and increased fitness. Thus, melanoma genomic heterogeneity contributes significantly to BRAF inhibitor treatment failure, implying upfront, cotargeting of two core pathways as an essential strategy for durable responses.

Several authors have described an association between these molecular alterations, some histological parameters, and patient survival. BRAF mutations are very frequent in melanoma, but their actual role in the evolution of the disease is still unclear. Here, we investigated the relationship of TERT promoter mutations and BRAF mutations with the most relevant clinicopathological parameters, individually and coexisting, in order to evaluate their role as independent prognostic markers and to determine the effect of their coexistence. A TERT promoter alteration was found in 20 of 53 cases (38 %), significantly associated with histological type, increasing tumor thickness and mitotic rate, more advanced pathologic tumor (pT) stage, and absence of regression. A BRAF mutation was found in 21 of 53 cases (40 %), significantly associated with tumor thickness and presence of metastases in the sentinel lymph node. Coexistence of a TERT promoter and BRAF mutation was detected in 11 of 53 cases (21 %). This was associated with increasing thickness, high mitotic rate, lymph node metastasis, presence of ulceration, and absence of regression. Coexistence of a mutation in the TERT promoter and in the BRAF gene correlated with more prognostically relevant factors than either mutation alone. Our data lead us to hypothesize that TERT promoter and BRAF mutations cooperate in cutaneous melanoma. Further studies in larger cohorts of patients are needed to investigate how this synergistic effect is involved in the evolution of the disease.",

We report a case of a 67-year-old male with a diagnosis of a superficial spreading melanoma (stage IB) rendered 6 years earlier who presented clinically with an atypical nevus on his left thigh. Histopathological examination showed an intraepidermal melanocytic proliferation that was interpreted as melanoma in situ. Subsequently, 45 additional pigmented macules appeared in crops over a 9-month period. Clinically and dermoscopically, these lesions were extremely polymorphic. Histopathological findings were compatible with melanoma in situ, as each lesion consisted of a wholly intraepidermal proliferation of markedly atypical melanocytes arranged singly and in nests. A complete gastrointestinal study showed multiple pigmented metastatic lesions throughout the stomach and small bowel, which supported a diagnosis of metastatic melanoma with gastrointestinal and epidermotropic skin involvement. Monosomy of chromosome 9 and a BRAF V600E mutation were detected in the primary tumor sample and in macro-dissected secondary lesions. No CDKN2A or CDK4 germline mutations were found.

In this study, we performed mutation analysis of BRAF and NRAS, investigated the EWSR1 gene rearrangement and evaluated the protein expression of insulin-like growth factor 2 and insulin-like growth factor 1R in 31 cases of malignant melanoma and 16 cases of clear cell sarcoma. By direct sequencing and high-resolution melting analysis, we identified BRAF and NRAS mutations in 51.6% and 12.9% of malignant melanoma cases, respectively, while none of clear cell sarcoma harbored BRAF or NRAS mutations. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that 78.6% of clear cell sarcoma exhibited the t(12;22)(q13;q12) translocation. The presence of type 1, 2, and 3 EWSR1/ATF1 fusion gene transcripts was confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis, but type 4 and EWSR1/CREB1 fusion gene transcripts were not found. No fusion transcript could be detected in any of the malignant melanoma cases. Additionally, immunohistochemistry showed that the majority of clear cell sarcoma and malignant melanoma had insulin-like growth factor 2 and insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 expression; however the expression of insulin-like growth factor 1R was significantly higher in clear cell sarcoma compared to melanoma (p = .006). Our results suggest that the combination of BRAF and NRAS mutation analysis with fusion gene detection contributes to diagnosis of malignant melanoma and clear cell sarcoma, and that insulin-like growth factor 1R might be a novel target for the treatment of these two malignancies.",

Several studies suggested that transfer of an activated ras oncogene into cultured rodent fibroblasts induces susceptibility to natural killer cell (NK)-mediated lysis. Experiments using human tumor cells, however, have produced conflicting data on the effect of ras activation in this respect. In studying the activation of the oncogene c-myc, which is often overexpressed in human melanoma, we have found that in cell lines expressing high levels of Myc protein, the sensitivity to lysis by NK cells was dramatically increased due to reduced expression of Human Leukocyte Antigen B locus products. Since the N-ras oncogene was found to be activated in 15% of human melanomas, we examined the possibility that in melanoma, in analogy to the murine systems, the mutated ras oncogene may influence NK susceptibility of human melanoma cells. Two N-ras genes harboring frequently found mutations were cloned into an expression vector. Transfection of the IGR39D melanoma cell line with wildtype and mutant N-ras constructs yielded several ras-expressing clones that were tested for NK sensitivity. Neither high expression of the wildtype N-ras protein, nor expression of two mutant proteins (N61-arg, N61-lys) was shown to result in enhanced NK-mediated lysis.

Nevertheless, only 20% these patients have additional metastases in non-sentinel lymph nodes (NSLN), indicating that CLND may be unnecessary in the majority of patients. In this retrospective study, we (i) sought to identify clinico-pathological features predicting NSLN status, as well as disease-free (DFS) and -specific (DSS) survival and (ii) evaluated the applicability of previously published algorithms, which were able to define a group of patients at zero-risk for NSLN-metastasis.;This analysis included 504 consecutive melanoma patients stage I and II who underwent successful SLN-biopsy (SLNB) at our institute between 1998 and 2005. Metastatic SLN were re-evaluated for tumor burden and categorized according to two different micro-anatomic classifications and the S/U-score (Size of the sentinel node metastasis > 2 mm/Ulceration of the primary melanoma) was assessed. DFS and DSS were calculated for all analyses.;Out of 504 melanoma patients stage I or II, 85 (17%) were SLN-positive and 18 of 85 (21%) were found with positive NSLN in the CLND specimen. Median follow-up was 31 months. Neither primary tumor characteristics (age, gender, Clark level, Breslow thickness, ulceration of the primary melanoma, site and histological subtype of the primary melanoma), nor features of the sentinel node tumor (number and site of draining lymph node basins, number of positive sentinel nodes and size of sentinel node tumor (< 2 mm vs. > or = 2 mm) were able to predict additional positive lymph nodes in the CLND specimen. Likewise the implementation of published algorithms was not able to identify patients at negligible risk for harboring NSLN metastases. Upon univariate analysis, disease-free survival in SLN-positive patients was correlated with Breslow thickness, sentinel node tumor size > 2 mm and S/U score. In respect to disease-specific survival the significant prognostic parameters were Breslow thickness, ulceration, sentinel node tumor size > 2 mm and the S/U score. After a median follow-up of 31 months recurrence rates (37% vs. 78%, p=0.02) and death from disease (24% vs. 50%, p<0.01) were significantly different in patients with SLN-metastasis only as compared to patients with NSLN-metastasis.;NSLN status cannot be predicted in this data analysis by using clinico-pathological characteristics.

The mitochondrial genome of DNA derived from 14 fresh melanoma specimens and two melanoma cell lines, and autologous lymphocytes or immortalized B cells, respectively, were sequenced using the MitoChip v2.0. Paired comparative sequence analysis was carried out to define somatic mutations. Somatic mitochondrial DNA mutations were identified in 12/16 (75%) melanomas, compared with germline lymphocyte DNA. One hundred mutations were present among these 12 melanomas. A disproportionate number of mutations occurred in the D-loop. Furthermore, 9/16 (56.3%) melanomas carried mutations, which resulted in amino acid substitutions in functional genes.

The high rate of missense mutations and the propensity for the ND complex implicate a role for alterations in mitochondrial respiratory function in melanoma carcinogenesis.

We have previously concluded that deletion of this chromosomal region can occur early (before metastasis) and in vivo in sporadic melanoma due to the identification of identical hemizygous losses on 9p21 in six autologous melanoma cell lines established from an individual patient (DX). These related cell lines have now been used to evaluate the timing of deletion/mutation of the p16INK4 and p15INK4B genes during tumor progression in melanoma. Surprisingly, homozygous deletions of a < or = 200-kb region surrounding p15INK4B, but not p16INK4, were detected in all six cell lines. Furthermore, single strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing analysis of the remaining p16INK4 allele in each case revealed only one intragenic mutation (in DX-6), whereas Western analysis provided evidence that p16INK4 protein was expressed in all six instances. These findings, taken together with those generated on other unrelated melanoma tumors and cell lines, suggest that hemizygous loss (or haplo-insufficiency) of the p16INK4 gene may be enough to place a melanocyte on a tumor pathway, and/or that the p16INK4 gene is not the sole 9p21 locus targeted in sporadic melanoma.",

This suggests that therapy with specific RAF kinase inhibitors may find use in treating this disease. If the response to RAF kinase inhibition is dependent on the presence of an activated BRAF protein, it will be necessary to evaluate cases of malignant melanoma for the presence or absence of BRAF mutations. High-resolution amplicon melting analysis is able to detect single base-pair changes in DNA isolated from paraffin-embedded tissue sections and obviates the need for direct DNA sequencing. Results can be available within 48 hours. In this report, we used high-resolution amplicon melting analysis to evaluate 90 cases of malignant melanoma for BRAF mutations. Of these 90 cases, 74 were metastatic melanomas, 12 were primary cutaneous melanomas, and 4 were in situ melanomas. BRAF activation mutations were found in 43 cases (48%). Forty-one of these mutations were in exon 15. The mutations in exon 15 included V600E (34 cases), V600K (6 cases), and V600R (1 case). Two activating mutations were found in exon 11, G469V and G469R. The presence or absence of a BRAF mutation in the junctional component of an invasive melanoma was maintained in the invasive component. We also evaluated these 90 cases, as well as an additional 10 cases (total of 100) for the expression of c-kit. The majority of invasive and metastatic malignant melanomas did not express c-kit, although all in situ lesions and the junctional components of invasive lesions were strongly c-kit positive. Surprisingly, 2 cases of metastatic malignant melanoma (2%) showed strong and diffuse c-kit expression and contained a c-kit-activating mutation, L576P, as detected by high-resolution amplicon melting analysis and confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. These 2 c-kit mutation-positive cases did not contain BRAF mutations. The presence of a c-kit-activating mutation in metastatic malignant melanoma suggests that a small number of melanomas may progress by a somatic mutation of the c-kit gene. The presence of BRAF- and c-kit-activating mutations in malignant melanoma suggests new approaches to treating this disease involving specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors may prove worthwhile and that mutation analysis by high-resolution melting analysis might help guide therapy.",

In particular, the mutation signatures are not indicative of ultraviolet light- or tobacco smoke-induced DNA damage.

Notably, there were substantially more copy number and structural variations in mucosal melanoma than have been reported in cutaneous melanoma.

However, the genetic changes caused by UVR that lead to melanoma formation remain unclear. The ING1 (inhibitor of growth 1) tumor suppressor plays an important role in cellular stress response to UVR. To further investigate whether ING1 is involved in melanoma development, we examined the mutational status of the ING1 gene in 46 human cutaneous melanoma biopsies and characterized the biological importance of ING1 mutations in nucleotide excision repair. Single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing were used to detect the mutational status of the ING1 gene. The host-cell-reactivation assay and radioimmunoassay were used to determine the role of ING1 mutations in nucleotide excision repair. We show that 20% of the melanoma primaries contained missense mutations in the SAP30-interacting domain and PHD finger motif of the ING1 gene with the R102L and N260S alterations observed more than once. Furthermore, our data indicate that patients that harbor ING1 mutations in the tumors have a higher risk to die from the disease within 5 years (50%) compared to patients with no ING1 mutation (18%). Moreover, we demonstrated that mutations at codon 102 or 260 as well as deletion of the PHD finger motif are detrimental to p33ING1-mediated enhancement of DNA repair.

Uveal melanoma cells containing mutant GNAQ were transfected with scrambled or GNAQ small-interfering RNA. Compared with the control, GNAQ knockdown markedly inhibited cell viability and migration. However, tumor cells without GNAQ mutations exhibited enhanced viability and migration following transfection with HA-GαqQL. Additionally, GNAQ knockdown significantly downregulated the expression of Jag-1 (Notch ligand), Notch intracellular domain and Hes-1 (Notch target gene) in uveal melanoma cells. Conversely, the GNAQ overexpression promoted their expression. Cell viability and migration induced by GNAQ was significantly inhibited following treatment with 5 µmol/l MRK003, a Notch signaling inhibitor. Furthermore, the transfection of human influenza hemagglutinin A epitope (HA)-GαqQL into tumor cells caused Yes-associated protein (YAP) dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation, which stimulated the expression of Jag-1 and Hes-1. Positive correlations were observed between the GNAQ and Jag-1 mRNA levels and between the GNAQ and Hes-1 mRNA levels. However, no positive correlation was observed between the GNAQ and YAP mRNA levels. The results suggested that GNAQ mutation induced viability and migration of uveal melanoma cells via Notch signaling activation, which is mediated by YAP dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation.",

Our analysis established NF1, encoding a negative regulator of RAS, as the third most frequently mutated gene in melanoma, after BRAF and NRAS. Inactivating NF1 mutations were present in 46% of melanomas expressing wild-type BRAF and RAS, occurred in older patients and showed a distinct pattern of co-mutation with other RASopathy genes, particularly RASA2. Functional studies showed that NF1 suppression led to increased RAS activation in most, but not all, melanoma cases. In addition, loss of NF1 did not predict sensitivity to MEK or ERK inhibitors. The rebound pathway, as seen by the induction of phosphorylated MEK, occurred in cells both sensitive and resistant to the studied drugs. We conclude that NF1 is a key tumor suppressor lost in melanomas, and that concurrent RASopathy gene mutations may enhance its role in melanomagenesis. ",

We have identified the first human melanoma cell line with an endogenous L576P mutation, the most common KIT mutation in melanoma ( approximately 30-40%). In vitro testing showed that the cell viability of the L576P mutant cell line was not reduced by imatinib, nilotinib, or sorafenib small molecule KIT inhibitors effective in nonmelanoma cells with other KIT mutations. However, the viability of the mutant cells was reduced by dasatinib at concentrations as low as 10 nM (P = 0.004). Molecular modeling studies found that the L576P mutation induces structural changes in KIT that reduce the affinity for imatinib (DeltaDeltaGbind = -2.52 kcal/mol) but not for dasatinib (DeltaDeltaGbind = +0.32 kcal/mol). Two metastatic melanoma patients with the L576P KIT mutation were treated with dasatinib, including one patient previously treated with imatinib. Both patients had marked reduction (>50%) and elimination of tumor F18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avidity by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging after dasatinib treatment.

We have previously shown that a single neonatal UV radiation (UVR) dose delivered to mice that carry melanocyte-specific activation of Hras (TPras) increases melanoma penetrance from 0% to 57%. Here, we report that activated Cdk4 cooperates with activated Hras to enhance susceptibility to melanoma in mice. Whereas UVR treatment failed to induce melanomas in Cdk4(R24C/R24C) mice, it greatly increased the penetrance and decreased the age of onset of melanoma development in Cdk4(R24C/R24C)/TPras animals compared with TPras alone. This increased penetrance was dependent on the threshold of Cdk4 activation as Cdk4(R24C/+)/TPras animals did not show an increase in UVR-induced melanoma penetrance compared with TPras alone. In addition, Cdk4(R24C/R24C)/TPras mice invariably developed multiple lesions, which occurred rarely in TPras mice. These results indicate that germ-line defects abrogating the pRb pathway may enhance UVR-induced melanoma. TPras and Cdk4(R24C/R24C)/TPras tumors were comparable histopathologically but the latter were larger and more aggressive and cultured cells derived from such melanomas were also larger and had higher levels of nuclear atypia. Moreover, the melanomas in Cdk4(R24C/R24C)/TPras mice, but not in TPras mice, readily metastasized to regional lymph nodes. Thus, it seems that in the mouse, Hras activation initiates UVR-induced melanoma development whereas the cell cycle defect introduced by mutant Cdk4 contributes to tumor progression, producing more aggressive, metastatic tumors.",

Despite the implied importance of PI3K signaling in PTENNull melanomas, mutational activation of the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of PI3Kα (PIK3CA), is rarely detected. Since PTEN has both PI3-lipid phosphatase-dependent and -independent tumor suppressor activities, we investigated the contribution of PI3K signaling to BRAFV600E-induced melanomagenesis using mouse models, cultured melanoma cells, and PI3K pathway-targeted inhibitors. These experiments revealed that mutationally activated PIK3CAH1047R cooperates with BRAFV600E for melanomagenesis in mice. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of PI3Ks prevented growth of BRAFV600E/PTENNull melanomas in vivo and in tissue culture. Combined inhibition of BRAFV600E and PI3K had more potent effects on the regression of established BRAFV600E/PTENNull melanomas and cultured melanoma cells than individual blockade of either pathway. Surprisingly, growth of BRAFV600E/PIK3CAH1047R melanomas was dependent on the protein kinase AKT; however, AKT inhibition had no effect on growth of BRAFV600E/PTENNull melanomas. These data indicate that PTEN silencing contributes a PI3K-dependent, but AKT-independent, function in melanomagenesis. Our findings enhance our knowledge of how BRAFV600E and PI3K signaling cooperate in melanomagenesis and provide preclinical validation for combined pathway-targeted inhibition of PI3K and BRAFV600E in the therapeutic management of BRAFV600E/PTENNull melanomas.

In FM, a single inherited \"hit\" occurs in every somatic cell, enabling interrogation of cultured normal skin fibroblasts (SFs) from FM gene carriers as surrogates for the cell of tumor origin, namely the melanocyte. We compared the gene expression profile of SFs from FM individuals with two distinct CDKN2A/p16 mutations (V126D-p16 and R87P-p16) with the gene expression profile of SFs from age-matched individuals without p16 mutations and with no family history of melanoma. We show an altered transcriptome signature in normal SFs bearing a single-hit inherited mutation in the CDKN2A/p16 gene, wherein some of these abnormal alterations recapitulate changes observed in the corresponding cancer. Significantly, the extent of the alterations is mutation-site specific with the R87P-p16 mutation being more disruptive than the V126D-p16 mutation. We also examined changes in gene expression after exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation to define potential early biomarkers triggered by sun exposure. UV treatment of SFs from FM families induces distinct alterations in genes related to cell cycle regulation and DNA damage responses that are also reported to be dysregulated in melanoma. Importantly, these changes were diametrically opposed to UV-induced changes in SF from normal controls. We posit that changes identified in the transcriptome of SF from FM mutation carriers represent early events critical for melanoma development. As such, they may serve as specific biomarkers of increased risk as well as molecular targets for personalized prevention strategies in high-risk populations.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Mutations in two loci encoding cell-cycle-regulatory proteins have been shown to cause familial malignant melanoma. About 20% of melanoma-prone families bear a mutation in the CDKN2A locus, which encodes two unrelated proteins, p16INK4A and p14ARF. Mutations in the other locus, CDK4, are much rarer and have been linked to the disease in only three families worldwide. In the 1960s, a large Norwegian pedigree with multiple atypical nevi and malignant melanomas was identified. Subsequently, six generations and more than 100 family members were traced and 20 cases of melanoma verified. In this article, we report that CDK4 codon 24 is mutated from CGT to CAT (Arg24His) in this unusually large melanoma kindred. Intriguingly, one of the family members had ocular melanoma, but the CDK4 mutation could not be detected in archival tissue samples from this subject. Thus, the case of ocular melanoma in this family was sporadic, suggesting an etiology different from that of the skin tumors. The CDK4 mutation in the Norwegian family was identical to that in melanoma families in France, Australia, and England. Haplotype analysis using microsatellite markers flanking the CDK4 gene and single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the gene did not support the possibility that there was a common founder, but rather indicated at least two independent mutational events. All CDK4 melanoma families known to date have a substitution of amino acid 24. In addition to resulting from selection pressure, this observation may be explained by the CG dinucleotide of codon 24 representing a mutational hot spot in the CDK4 gene.",

This protein acts as a linker that connects cell surface proteins to the actin cytoskeleton. Defects caused by mutations of the NF2 gene give rise to NF2 disease, which is generally characterized by the formation of bilateral vestibular schwannomas and, to a lesser extent, meningiomas and ependymomas. In addition to these tumor types, NF2 is mutated and/or merlin expression is reduced or lost in numerous non-NF2 associated tumors, including melanoma. However, the role of merlin in human melanoma growth and the mechanism underlying its effect are currently unknown. In the present study, we show that merlin knockdown enhances melanoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and that decreased merlin expression promotes subcutaneous melanoma growth in immunocompromised mice. Concordantly, we find that increased expression of merlin in a metastatic melanoma cell line reduced their in vitro migration and proliferation, and diminished their ability to grow in an anchorage independent manner. Increased merlin expression also inhibits in vivo growth of these melanoma cells. Lastly, we demonstrate that higher merlin levels in human melanoma cells promote the H(2)O(2)-induced activation of MST1/2 Ser/Thr kinases, which are known tumor suppressors in the Hippo signaling pathway. Taken together, these results provide for the first time evidence that merlin negatively regulates human melanoma growth, and that loss of merlin, or impaired merlin function, results in an opposite effect. In addition, we show that increased merlin expression leads to enhanced activation of the MTS1/2 kinases, implying the potential roles of MST1/2 in mediating the anti-melanoma effects of merlin.",

We have recently reported on the in silico approach to identify putative inhibitors for AKT/PKB. Of the reported hits, we selected BI-69A11, a compound which was shown to inhibit AKT activity in in vitro kinase assays. Analysis of BI-69A11 was performed in melanoma cells, a tumor type that commonly exhibits up-regulation of AKT. Treatment of the UACC903 human melanoma cells, harboring the PTEN mutation, with BI-69A11 caused efficient inhibition of AKT S473 phosphorylation with concomitant inhibition of AKT phosphorylation of PRAS40. Treatment of melanoma cells with BI-69A11 also reduced AKT protein expression, which coincided with inhibition of AKT association with HSP-90. BI-69A11 treatment not only caused cell death of melanoma, but also prostate tumor cell lines. Notably, the effect of BI-69A11 on cell death was more pronounced in cells that express an active form of AKT. Significantly, intra-peritoneal injection of BI-69A11 caused effective regression of melanoma tumor xenografts, which coincided with elevated levels of cell death. These findings identify BI-69A11 as a potent inhibitor of AKT that is capable of eliciting effective regression of xenograft melanoma tumors.",

We evaluated the relationship between MC1R and melanoma risk in CDKN2A melanoma-prone families with extensive clinical and epidemiologic data. We studied 395 subjects from 16 American CDKN2A families. Major melanoma risk factors were assessed by clinical examination or questionnaire; MC1R was sequenced. Odds ratios were estimated by unconditional and conditional logistic regression models. We examined the distribution of MC1R variants and median ages at melanoma diagnosis in multiple primary melanoma (MPM) and single primary melanoma (SPM) patients. Presence of multiple MC1R variants was significantly associated with melanoma, even after adjustment for major melanoma risk factors. All 40 MPM patients had at least one MC1R variant; 65% of MPM patients versus only 17% of SPM patients had at least two MC1R variants (P < 0.0001). For all 69 melanoma patients combined, as well as the 40 MPM patients, there was a statistically significant decrease in median age at diagnosis as numbers of MC1R variants increased (P = 0.010 and P = 0.008, respectively). In contrast, no significant reduction in age at melanoma diagnosis was observed for SPM patients (P = 0.91). The current study suggests that the presence of multiple MC1R variants is associated with the development of multiple melanoma tumors in patients with CDKN2A mutations. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings and to explore the mechanisms that may contribute to this relationship.",

The importance of immunohistochemistry in diagnosis of the primary tumor and in early identification of metastases in lymphatic nodes is enormous; however melanoma phenotype is frequently variable and thus several markers must be employed simultaneously. The purposes of this study are to describe changes of phenotype of malignant melanoma in vitro and in vivo and to investigate whether changes of environmental factors mimicking natural conditions affect the phenotype of melanoma cells and can revert the typical in vitro loss of diagnostic markers. The influence of microenvironment was studied by means of immunocytochemistry on co-cultures of melanoma cells with melanoma-associated fibroblast and/or in conditioned media. The markers typical for melanoma (HMB45, Melan-A, Tyrosinase) were lost in malignant cells isolated from malignant effusion; however, tumor metastases shared identical phenotype with primary tumor (all markers positive). The melanoma cell lines also exerted reduced phenotype in vitro. The only constantly present diagnostic marker observed in our experiment was S100 protein and, in lesser extent, also Nestin. The phenotype loss was reverted under the influence of melanoma-associated fibroblast and/or both types of conditioned media. Loss of some markers of melanoma cell phenotype is not only of diagnostic significance, but it can presumably also contribute to biological behavior of melanoma. The presented study shows how the conditions of cultivation of melanoma cells can influence their phenotype. This observation can have some impact on considerations about the role of microenvironment in tumor biology. ",

The impact of treatment on relapse rate is most pronounced early during the treatment interval. The overall benefit of treatment in this trial was analyzed stratified by tumor burden and the presence or absence of microscopic nonpalpable and palpable regional lymph node metastasis. The benefit of therapy with IFN alpha-2b was greatest among node-positive strata. Toxicity of IFN alpha-2b required dose modification in the majority of patients, but treatment at > or = 80% of the scheduled dose was feasible in the majority of patients through the IV phase of treatment, and for more than 3 months of SC maintenance therapy. Discontinuation of treatment due to toxicity was infrequent after the fourth month of therapy.;IFN alpha-2b prolongs the relapse-free interval and overall survival of high-risk resected melanoma patients. The increment in median disease-free survival (from 1 to 1.7 years) and overall survival (from 2.8 to 3.8 years) that results from this therapy is associated with a 42% improvement in the fraction of patients who are continuously disease-free after treatment with IFN (from 26% to 37%) in comparison to observation.

Up to one-half of patients are at risk for fatal metastatic disease. The metastatic potential of an individual tumor can be accurately determined by analysis of a fine-needle aspirate with gene expression profiling assay that is available for routine clinical use through a commercial Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory. The test renders one of two results-class 1 (low metastatic risk) or class 2 (high metastatic risk)-and has been extensively validated in multiple centers. Until recently, the genetic mutations and signaling aberrations in UM were largely unknown. With the advent of new genomic sequencing technologies, however, the molecular landscape of UM is rapidly emerging. Mutations in the Gq alpha subunits GNAQ and GNA11 are mutually exclusive and represent early or initiating events that constitutively activate the MAPK pathway. Mutations in BRCA1-associated protein-1 (BAP1) and splicing factor 3B subunit 1 (SF3B1) also appear to be largely mutually exclusive, and they occur later in tumor progression. BAP1 mutations are strongly associated with metastasis, whereas SF3B1 mutations are associated with a more favorable outcome. BAP1 mutations can arise in the germ line, leading to a newly described BAP1 familial cancer syndrome. These discoveries have led to new clinical trials to assess several classes of compounds, including MEK, protein kinase C, and histone deacetylase inhibitors, in the adjuvant setting for high-risk patients identified as class 2, as well as in the setting of advanced disseminated disease.

Melanoma is also one of the few remaining cancers with increasing US incidence. In the 1930s, the lifetime risk of an American developing invasive malignant melanoma was 1 in 1,500. Currently, that risk is 1 in 59. Deaths from malignant melanoma are also increasing. The mortality rate from malignant melanoma has risen about 2% annually since 1960. This year, it is estimated that 8,700 Americans will die from this cancer. The identification of individuals at high risk for malignant melanoma is important for the development of focused and efficient prevention efforts. Acute sun exposure resulting in sunburn remains a significant risk factor for the development of melanoma, but numerous other potential risk factors have been cited. Included among these are atypical mole syndrome/dysplastic nevus syndrome, blistering sunburns, immunosuppression, prior therapy with psoralen with ultraviolet A light (UVA) light, UV exposure at tanning salons, elevated socioeconomic status, and history of melanoma in a first-degree relative.

Since metastatic melanoma cells express high levels of HSPG and because melanoma tumors grow highly vascularized, we analyzed melanoma tissue specimens for HPSE-1 expression from experimental animals as well as from patients. Laser capture microdissection microscopy was used to extract melanoma cell populations and to isolate them from adjacent tissue. In experimental animals, a 29-fold upregulation of HPSE-1 expression was detected by real-time PCR in metastatic melanoma compared to normal lung tissue. Additionally, immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed selective HPSE-1 staining in human metastatic melanoma when compared to primary melanoma tumors from the same patient. IHC also showed a marked staining for the enzyme around blood vessels and in vascularized regions. Our results provide evidence demonstrating that HPSE-1 likely plays important roles in regulating the in vivo growth and progression of melanoma. These results further emphasize the importance that therapies designed to block HPSE-1 activity may aid in controlling this type of cancer.",

Early stage melanoma can be often cured by surgery; therefore current management guidelines dictate a different approach for thin (<1mm) versus thick (>4mm) melanomas. We have carried out whole-exome sequencing in 5 thin and 5 thick fresh-frozen primary cutaneous melanomas. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) identified two groups corresponding to thin and thick melanomas. The most striking difference between them was the much greater abundance of SCNAs in thick melanomas, whereas mutation frequency did not significantly change between the two groups. We found novel mutations and focal SCNAs in genes that are embryonic regulators of axon guidance, predominantly in thick melanomas. Analysis of publicly available microarray datasets provided further support for a potential role of Ephrin receptors in melanoma progression. In addition, we have identified a set of SCNAs, including amplification of BRAF and ofthe epigenetic modifier EZH2, that are specific for the group of thick melanomas that developed metastasis during the follow-up. Our data suggest that mutations occur early during melanoma development, whereas SCNAs might be involved in melanoma progression. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Melanoma, a malignant tumor of melanocytes, causes the majority (75%) of all skin cancer-related deaths. The overall efficacy of different anti-cancer therapies on metastatic melanoma is quite limited, due to its high resistance to all forms of conventional treatments, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy, leading to low patient survival rates. The present review identifies possible strategies for the treatment of advanced melanoma and describes two novel agents, Ipilimumab and Vemurafenib, which may now be useful for clinical practice. Ipilimumab, a humanized, IgG1 monoclonal antibody, acts through immune-modulation since it blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte- associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4), producing favourable antitumor immune system responses and reducing tolerance to tumor-associated antigens. Vemurafenib is a novel oral small-molecule kinase inhibitor with high selectivity and efficacy toward a specific mutated oncogenic BRAF-signalling mediator. The mechanism of action of Vemurafenib involves selective inhibition of the mutated BRAF(V600E) kinase that leads to reduced signalling through the aberrant MAPK pathway. However, as patients commonly develop Vemurafenib resistance, clinical trials of Vemurafenib in combination with Ipilimumab or other targeted or cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents may provide more effective regimens with longterm clinical benefits, emphasizing the importance of simultaneously targeting several pathways. As both drugs had only modest effects on median survival, new therapeutic combinations are needed, such as BRAF inhibitors with MEK inhibitors or combinations of immunomodulators and pathway inhibitors. Such strategies should have the potential of maximizing antitumor effect while minimizing and improving clinical benefit. Nevertheless, these two new agents open a promising view into an effective management of melanoma. ",

Outside the familial context, multiple primary tumors could be related either to germline de novo mutations or to low-penetrance mutations, in predisposing genes. We selected 100 patients who displayed multiple primary melanoma (MPM) without any known melanoma cases recorded within their families and looked for germline mutations in the two melanoma-predisposing genes identified to date, CDKN2A and CDK4 exon 2. Nine patients (9%) had germline mutations in CDKN2A, whereas none carried germline mutations in exon 2 of CDK4. Seven cases displayed a recurrent missense mutation, G101W, already described in more than 20 melanoma-prone families; one case carried a missense mutation never reported to date (P114S), and the last case was a carrier of a 6 bp insertion at nucleotide 57 resulting in a duplication of codons 18 and 19. To ascertain whether the G101W was a mutational hot spot for de novo mutations or a common founder mutation, we genotyped eight microsatellite markers flanking the CDKN2A gene. After allowing for recombination over time, haplotype sharing provided evidence for an original G101W mutation common to 6 out of 7 sporadic MPM cases. Therefore, it can be concluded that de novo germline CDKN2A mutations associated with MPM are rare.",

Lymphocyte migration from blood into peripheral tissues is mainly regulated by vascular endothelium. However, the blood vessels and mechanisms governing the recruitment of TILs in melanoma tumors remain poorly understood. Here, we show that high endothelial venules (HEVs), specialized blood vessels for lymphocyte extravasation into lymphoid tissues, are frequently found in melanoma tumors and are associated with high levels of lymphocyte infiltration. The analysis of 225 primary melanomas revealed that lymphocytes specifically infiltrated HEV-rich areas of melanoma tumors and that the density of MECA-79+ HEVs was variable among patients and strongly correlated with CD3+, CD8+ and CD20+ TIL densities. Inflammatory (CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11) and lymphoid (CCL21, CCL19 and CXCL13) chemokines as well as TH1 and naïve T-cell genes were overexpressed in melanoma samples with high densities of tumor HEVs. Mature dendritic cells (mDCs) were frequently found around tumor HEVs and densities of HEVs and DC-LAMP+ mDCs within tumor stroma were strongly correlated. DCs which maintain HEVs in lymph nodes, may thus also contribute to the regulation of HEVs in melanomas. Finally, we found significantly higher densities of tumor HEVs in melanomas with tumor regression, low Clark level of invasion and thin Breslow thickness (all p < 0.001). The strong association between tumor HEVs, TILs, mDCs and clinical parameters of melanoma, supports a critical role for HEVs in limiting malignant melanoma development through both naïve and effector T-lymphocyte recruitment and activation.",

However, the biologic and clinical significance of the RAC1 P29S somatic mutation in approximately 4% to 9% of patients remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that melanoma cell lines possessing the RAC1 hotspot variant are resistant to RAF inhibitors (vemurafenib and dabrafenib). Enforced expression of RAC1 P29S in sensitive BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines confers resistance manifested by increased viability, decreased apoptosis, and enhanced tumor growth in vivo upon treatment with RAF inhibitors. Conversely, RNAi-mediated silencing of endogenous RAC1 P29S in a melanoma cell line with a co-occurring BRAF V600 mutation increased sensitivity to vemurafenib and dabrafenib. Our results suggest RAC1 P29S status may offer a predictive biomarker for RAF inhibitor resistance in melanoma patients, where it should be evaluated clinically.",

To study further the possible role of PTEN/MMAC1 in the pathogenesis and progression of malignant melanoma, we examined uncultured specimens from 16 primary and 61 metastatic tumors from 67 patients. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to analyze systematically the coding region of PTEN/MMAC1 and revealed mutations in four of the metastatic samples (7%). Sequence analysis of the mutants identified a 1 bp frameshift insertion, a 2 bp frameshift deletion, an 11 bp frameshift deletion, and a single base substitution resulting in the generation of a premature stop codon. Analysis of two intragenic polymorphisms showed allelic loss in three of eight informative primary tumors (38%) and in 18 of 31 metastatic tumors (58%).

To develop more effective strategies for the prevention or treatment of melanoma, we have examined the inhibitory effects of silymarin, a flavanoid from Silybum marianum, on melanoma cells. Using A375 (BRAF-mutated) and Hs294t (non BRAF-mutated but highly metastatic) human melanoma cell lines, we found that in vitro treatment with silymarin resulted in a dose-dependent: (i) reduction in cell viability; (ii) enhancement of either Go/G1 (A375) or G2-M (Hs294t) phase cell cycle arrest with corresponding alterations in cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases; and (iii) induction of apoptosis. The silymarin-induced apoptosis of human melanoma cells was associated with a reduction in the levels of anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl), an increase in the levels of pro-apoptotic protein (Bax), and activation of caspases. Further, oral administration of silymarin (500 mg/kg body weight/2× a week) significantly inhibited (60%, P < 0.01) the growth of BRAF-mutated A375 melanoma tumor xenografts, and this was associated with: (i) inhibition of cell proliferation; (ii) induction of apoptosis of tumor cells; (iii) alterations in cell cycle regulatory proteins; and (iv) reduced expression of tumor angiogenic biomarkers in tumor xenograft tissues. These results indicate that silymarin may have a chemotherapeutic effect on human melanoma cell growth and warrant its further evaluation.",

We primarily used a unique Utah genealogical resource to identify independent melanoma prone families whom we tested for mutations in CDKN2A, cyclin-dependent kinase 4, and alternate reading frame. We sampled 60 families which met the inclusion criteria of two or more affected first-degree relatives. We found four different pathogenic CDKN2A mutations in five families, mutations of uncertain significance in two families, and known polymorphisms in three families. One of the mutations of uncertain significance, 5' untranslated region -25C>T, has not been previously described. Among our population-based set of Utah families, the prevalence of CDKN2A mutations was 8.2% (4/49); the overall prevalence when physician-referred pedigrees were also considered was between 8.3% (5/60) and 10% (6/60).

Functionally, case-specific combinations of inhibitors that simultaneously targeted MAPK-dependent and MAPK-independent mechanisms were most effective at inhibiting melanoma growth, against each specific mutational background.

The melanoma-relevant effectors of ERK activation, however, are largely unknown. In this work, we show that increased ERK activation correlates strongly with mutational status of N-RAS or B-RAF in 21 melanoma cell lines. Melanoma lines that were wild-type for RAS/RAF showed low levels of ERK activation comparable with primary human melanocytes. Through supervised analysis of RNA expression profiles, we identified 82 genes, including TWIST1, HIF1alpha, and IL-8, which correlated with ERK activation across the panel of cell lines and which decreased with pharmacologic inhibition of ERK activity, suggesting that they are ERK transcriptional targets in melanoma. Additionally, lines lacking mutations of N-RAS and B-RAF were molecularly distinct and characterized by p53 inactivation, reduced ERK activity, and increased expression of epithelial markers. Analysis of primary human melanomas by tissue microarray confirmed a high correlation among expression of these epithelial markers in a heterogeneous sample of 570 primary human tumors, suggesting that a significant frequency of primary melanomas is of this \"epithelial-like\" subtype.

This study is the first to compare survival in germline CDKN2A mutated (mut) and nonmutated melanoma cases.;Melanoma-prone families participating in this study were identified through a nationwide predictive program starting in 1987. Information on cancer diagnoses (types, stages, and dates) and deaths (causes and dates) were obtained through the Swedish Cancer Registry and Cause of Death Registry. Kaplan Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess survival in CDKN2A(mut) (n = 96) and CDKN2A(wt) (n = 377) familial melanoma cases and in matched sporadic melanoma cases (n = 1042). All statistical tests were two-sided.;When comparing CDKN2A(mut) and CDKN2A(wt) melanoma cases, after adjusting for age, sex, and T classification, CDKN2A(mut) had worse survival than melanoma (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.49 to 4.21) and than nonmelanoma cancers (HR = 7.77, 95% CI = 3.65 to 16.51).

To date, most studies which strongly implicate PTEN in the etiology of sporadic melanomas have depended on cell lines, short-term tumor cultures and noncultured metastatic melanomas. The only study which reports PTEN protein expression in melanoma focuses on cytoplasmic expression, mainly in metastatic samples. To determine how PTEN contributes to the etiology or the progression of primary cutaneous melanoma, we examined cytoplasmic and nuclear PTEN expression against clinical and pathologic features in a population-based sample of 150 individuals with incident primary cutaneous melanoma. Among 92 evaluable samples, 30 had no or decreased cytoplasmic PTEN protein expression and the remaining 62 had normal PTEN expression. In contrast, 84 tumors had no or decreased nuclear expression and 8 had normal nuclear PTEN expression. None of the clinical features studied, such as Clark's level and Breslow thickness or sun exposure, were associated with cytoplasmic PTEN expressional levels. An association with loss of nuclear PTEN expression was indicated for anatomical site (p = 0.06) and mitotic index (p = 0.02). There was also an association for melanomas to either not express nuclear PTEN or to express p53 alone, rather than both simultaneously (p = 0.02). In contrast with metastatic melanoma, where we have shown previously that almost two-thirds of tumors have some PTEN inactivation, only one-third of primary melanomas had PTEN silencing. This suggests that PTEN inactivation is a late event likely related to melanoma progression rather than initiation. Taken together with our previous observations in thyroid and islet cell tumors, our data suggest that nuclear-cytoplasmic partitioning of PTEN might also play a role in melanoma progression.",

In contrast to p53, many studies on cancer patients failed to detect mutational inactivation of p73 and reported overexpression of wild-type p73 instead. A possible explanation was provided by the recent discovery of N-terminal truncated isoforms of p73 (DeltaTA-p73) that act as dominant-negative inhibitors of wild-type p53 and TA-p73 and result in tumor growth in nude mice. We investigated the role of DeltaTA-p73 in the development and progression of human melanomas, which lack p53 mutations. We analyzed 8 benign melanocytic nevi, 8 primary melanomas and 19 melanoma metastases for alterations of TA-p73 and DeltaTA-p73 expression using isoform-specific real-time RT-PCR. Based on our results, p73Deltaex2 and Deltaex2/3 spliced transcripts derived from the first promoter were significantly up-regulated in melanoma metastases, whereas DeltaN-p73 generated from the second promoter was the predominant isoform in benign nevi. Moreover, increased expression of p73Deltaex2 and p73Deltaex2/3 correlated with high-levels of both TA-p73 and E2F1.

Among them, ABCB5-expressing cells were proposed to display an enhanced tumorigenicity with stem cell-like properties. In addition, ABCB5(+) cells are thought to participate to chemoresistance through a potential efflux function of ABCB5. Nevertheless, the fate of these cells upon drugs that are used in melanoma chemotherapy remains to be clarified. Here we explored the effect of anti-melanoma treatments on the ABCB5-expressing cells. Using a melanoma xenograft model (WM266-4), we observed in vivo that ABCB5-expressing cells are enriched after a temozolomide treatment that induces a significant tumor regression. These results were further confirmed in a preliminary study conducted on clinical samples from patients that received dacarbazine. In vitro, we showed that ABCB5-expressing cells selectively survive when exposed to dacarbazine, the reference treatment of metastatic melanoma, but also to vemurafenib, a new inhibitor of the mutated kinase V600E BRAF and other various chemotherapeutic drugs. Our results show that anti-melanoma chemotherapy might participate to the chemoresistance acquisition by selecting tumor cell subpopulations expressing ABCB5.

The anti-cancer mechanism of the MTO cubic phases was explored according to the immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry.;The isotropic structure of MTO cubic phases was identified. The transdermal permeability of MTO was greatly improved by the cubic phase compared to that of the MTO solution. The MTO cubic phases showed the high cytotoxicity in B16 melanoma cells evidenced by a modified electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing system. High anti-melanoma effect of the MTO cubic phases was confirmed according to the tumor volume changes and tumor weight. The tumor inhibitory rate of the MTO cubic phases was 68.44%. The calreticulin expression of B16 cells was improved by the MTO cubic phases, and the improved cell uptake of MTO was confirmed by the flow cytometry.;The MTO cubic phase is a promising topical delivery system for melanoma therapy with the advantages of non-invasion and no severe side effects.",

In prior studies, we have defined gene expression phenotypes (high-immune, pigmentation, proliferative and normal-like), which are predictive of survival outcome as well as informative of biology. Herein, we employed a population-based metastatic melanoma cohort and external cohorts to determine the prognostic and predictive significance of the gene expression phenotypes. We performed expression profiling on 214 cutaneous melanoma tumors and found an increased risk of developing distant metastases in the pigmentation (HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.05-3.28; P=0.03) and proliferative (HR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.43-5.57; P=0.003) groups as compared to the high-immune response group. Further genetic characterization of melanomas using targeted deep-sequencing revealed similar mutational patterns across these phenotypes. We also used publicly available expression profiling data from melanoma patients treated with targeted or vaccine therapy in order to determine if our signatures predicted therapeutic response. In patients receiving targeted therapy, melanomas resistant to targeted therapy were enriched in the MITF-low proliferative subtype as compared to pre-treatment biopsies (P=0.02). In summary, the melanoma gene expression phenotypes are highly predictive of survival outcome and can further help to discriminate patients responding to targeted therapy. ",

The opportunity to develop molecularly targeted therapy emerged with the discovery of activating mutations in BRAF, a component of the long studied MAP kinase pathway. These mutations are found in approximately 50 % of patients with regionally advanced or metastatic melanoma and appear to be one of the initiating steps in the development of primary melanoma. Additional oncogenic events, particularly those that affect tumor suppressor genes, are essential for development of invasive and metastatic melanoma. Nonetheless, mutated BRAF retains its central contribution to melanoma pathophysiology even in advanced stage disease as manifested by the remarkable antitumor effects and alteration the natural history of metastatic melanoma of selective BRAF inhibitors. After initial response, resistance commonly emerges within a few months' time and the field has focused on delineating molecular mechanisms of resistance toward the goal of improving upon the early therapeutic effects of single agent BRAF inhibition. Combination regimens are currently undergoing clinical investigation. NRAS and CKIT mutant melanoma represent the next oncogene defined melanoma subsets for which initial targeted therapy approaches are being explored, with early evidence suggesting progress with MEK and CKIT inhibitors, respectively. A considerable subset of patients have melanomas that are not defined by the presence of BRAF, NRAS, or CKIT mutations and, thus, the elucidation of the entire melanoma genome is being pursued with the hope of identifying additional therapeutic targets.",

To study the effect of p53 on melanocyte function and melanomagenesis, we crossed the ‘high-p53’Mdm4+/− mouse to the well-established TP-ras0/+ murine melanoma progression model. After treatment with the carcinogen dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA), TP-ras0/+ mice on the Mdm4+/− background developed fewer tumors with a delay in the age of onset of melanomas compared to TP-ras0/+ mice. Furthermore, we observed a dramatic decrease in tumor growth, lack of metastasis with increased survival of TP-ras0/+: Mdm4+/− mice. Thus, p53 effectively prevented the conversion of small benign tumors to malignant and metastatic melanoma. p53 activation in cultured primary melanocyte and melanoma cell lines using Nutlin-3, a specific Mdm2 antagonist, supported these findings.

Pure DM displays a low density of fusiform melanocytes in a collagen-rich matrix. In mixed DM, tumor cell density is higher, and parts of the tumor lack abundant stromal fibrosis. Both pure and mixed DMs usually express S100 protein homogenously. We report herein an unusual biphenotypic tumor characterized by the association of a pure DM with an undifferentiated solid spindle cell nodule. It occurred on the scalp of a 66-year-old man. A biopsy of the undifferentiated spindle cell nodule was initially interpreted at a commercial laboratory as atypical fibroxanthoma. The pure DM was seen only in the excisional specimen. All cells of the pure DM stained for S100 protein and SOX10. The adjacent solid sarcomatoid spindle cell nodule lacked expression of S100 protein, SOX10, as well as melan-A, gp100, and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor in >95% of its tumor cells. Although focal expression of melanocyte differentiation antigens in the solid tumor component made us favor a combined DM with sarcomatoid dedifferentiation, we also considered the possibility of a collision scenario, that is, a pleomorphic dermal sarcoma incidentally colliding with a DM. To further assess a possible relationship of the sarcomatoid nodule with the DM, we performed next-generation sequencing analysis on each component separately. The analysis revealed shared chromosomal copy number changes and a high number of common mutations, thereby supporting the concept of a DM with a dedifferentiated sarcomatoid component.

The CGH profiles of sinonasal mucosal melanomas show remarkably consistent alterations: chromosome arm 1q is gained in all tumors and gains of 6p and 8q are present in 93 and 57%, respectively. Comparison of CGH data with both the common variants of cutaneous melanoma and uveal melanoma revealed that sinonasal mucosal melanomas harbor a distinct pattern of chromosomal abnormalities. Ploidy analysis also showed that diploid tumors exhibit gains of 1q and alterations of chromosome 6 (3 of 3 cases tested), whereas clear-copy gains and high-copy gains were seen only in triploid and tetraploid tumors (6 of 8 cases tested).

Here, we evaluate the nature of melanoma-endothelial communication mediated by Notch3 and its functional significance. We find that Notch3 is specifically upregulated in melanoma-endothelial cell cocultures and is functionally associated with increased Notch signaling in melanoma cells. Furthermore, induced Notch3 signaling in melanoma cell lines leads to enhanced tumor cell migration without associated increases in tumor cell growth.

Different from genetically engineered models, sporadic canine melanocytic neoplasms share several characteristics with human disease that could make dogs a more relevant preclinical model. Canine melanomas rarely arise in sun-exposed sites. Most occur in the oral cavity, with a subset having intra-epithelial malignant melanocytes mimicking the in situ component of human mucosal melanoma. The spectrum of canine melanocytic neoplasia includes benign lesions with some analogy to nevi, as well as invasive primary melanoma, and widespread metastasis. Growing evidence of distinct subtypes in humans, differing in somatic and predisposing germ-line genetic alterations, cell of origin, epidemiology, relationship to ultraviolet radiation and progression from benign to malignant tumors, may also exist in dogs. Canine and human mucosal melanomas appear to harbor BRAF, NRAS, and c-kit mutations uncommonly, compared with human cutaneous melanomas, although both species share AKT and MAPK signaling activation. We conclude that there is significant overlap in the clinical and histopathological features of canine and human mucosal melanomas.

Yet, the impact of sequence variation on the regulatory potential of gene promoters has not been systematically evaluated. This study assesses the impact of promoter mutations on promoter activity in the whole-genome sequenced malignant melanoma cell line COLO-829. Combining somatic mutation calls from COLO-829 with genome-wide chromatin accessibility and histone modification data revealed mutations within promoter elements. Interestingly, a high number of potential promoter mutations (n = 23) were found, a result mirrored in subsequent analysis of TCGA whole-melanoma genomes. The impact of wild-type and mutant promoter sequences were evaluated by subcloning into luciferase reporter vectors and testing their transcriptional activity in COLO-829 cells. Of the 23 promoter regions tested, four mutations significantly altered reporter activity relative to wild-type sequences. These data were then subjected to multiple computational algorithms that score the cis-regulatory altering potential of mutations. These analyses identified one mutation, located within the promoter region of NDUFB9, which encodes the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 beta subcomplex 9, to be recurrent in 4.4% (19 of 432) of TCGA whole-melanoma exomes. The mutation is predicted to disrupt a highly conserved SP1/KLF transcription factor binding motif and its frequent co-occurrence with mutations in the coding sequence of NF1 supports a pathologic role for this mutation in melanoma. Taken together, these data show the relatively high prevalence of promoter mutations in the COLO-829 melanoma genome, and indicate that a proportion of these significantly alter the regulatory potential of gene promoters.;Genomic-based screening within gene promoter regions suggests that functional cis-regulatory mutations may be common in melanoma genomes, highlighting the need to examine their role in tumorigenesis.",

We have identified another antigen of LG2-MEL as a peptide presented by HLA-B*4403 and resulting from a point mutation in gene OS-9. This gene is expressed in various normal tissues. It is located on chromosome 12 in the vicinity of the CDK4 locus and is frequently co-amplified with CDK4 in human sarcomas. The mutation, a C-to-T transition, changes a proline residue into a leucine at position 446 of the OS-9 protein. Mutated transcripts were found in all the melanoma sublines of LG2-MEL. None of the 184 tumor samples collected from other cancer patients expressed the mutated transcript, indicating that this is a rare mutational event. Interestingly, some of the melanoma sublines of LG2-MEL have lost the wild-type allele of gene OS-9. Those sublines appear to grow faster in vitro than the sublines that retained the wild-type allele, suggesting that this loss of heterozygosity may favor tumor progression.

We recently localized a third melanoma susceptibility locus to chromosome band 1p22. Critical recombinants in linked families localized the gene to a 15-Mb region between D1S430 and D1S2664. To map the locus more finely we have performed studies to assess allelic loss across the region in a panel of melanomas from 1p22-linked families, sporadic melanomas, and melanoma cell lines. Eighty percent of familial melanomas exhibited loss of heterozygosity (LOH) within the region, with a smallest region of overlapping deletions (SRO) of 9 Mb between D1S207 and D1S435. This high frequency of LOH makes it very likely that the susceptibility locus is a tumor suppressor. In sporadic tumors, four SROs were defined. SRO1 and SRO2 map within the critical recombinant and familial tumor region, indicating that one or the other is likely to harbor the susceptibility gene. However, SRO3 may also be significant because it overlaps with the markers with the highest 2-point LOD score (D1S2776), part of the linkage recombinant region, and the critical region defined in mesothelioma. The candidate genes PRKCL2 and GTF2B, within SRO2, and TGFBR3, CDC7, and EVI5, in a broad region encompassing SRO3, were screened in 1p22-linked melanoma kindreds, but no coding mutations were detected. Allelic loss in melanoma cell lines was significantly less frequent than in fresh tumors, indicating that this gene may not be involved late in progression, such as in overriding cellular senescence, necessary for the propagation of melanoma cells in culture.",

Stable EGF knockdown (EGFkd) in EGF-high (M24met) and EGF-low (A375) expressing melanoma cells was generated. Only in EGF-high melanoma cells, EGFkd led to a significant reduction of lymph node metastasis and primary tumor lymphangiogenesis in vivo, as well as impairment of tumor cell migration in vitro. Moreover, EGF-induced sprouting of lymphatic but not of blood endothelial cells was abolished using supernatants of M24met EGFkd cells. In addition, M24met EGFkd tumors showed reduced vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) expression levels. Similarly, in human primary melanomas, a direct correlation between EGF/VEGF-C and EGF/Prox-1 expression levels was found.

It is a disease which tends to be refractory to both radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Immunotherapy has been used in three phases of the disease. 1. Intralesional immunotherapy with a nonspecific immune adjuvant in patients with local intradermal or soft tissue recurrence. This treatment produces approximately 15% regression of both injected and uninjected lesions, and about 60% regression of injected lesions only. Both clinical and laboratory evidence suggests that this regression is immunologically mediated. 2. Patients with surgical removal of all clinically demonstrable tumor, either primary disease alone or regional node recurrence, active nonspecific, and specific, immunotherapy has been used in an adjuvant setting. There is considerable controversy about the benefits accruing to such immunotherapy, but most large scale prospective and randomized studies have suggested that if benefit does result it is modest in degree and probably cannot be measured in terms of increase in cure rate. 3. Immunotherapy has also been used as a nonspecific active adjuvant to single drug or polychemotherapy in patients with disseminated melanoma. Whereas complete response rate may be slightly increased by this maneuver there is no convincing evidence that immunotherapy markedly increases the total objective response rate to polychemotherapy, and survival is only marginally superior when immunotherapy is added to chemotherapy in this setting. Further studies need to be done with active specific immunotherapy with tumor cell membrane extracts; as an adjuvant in patients with minimal body burden of tumor cells; and to study the inaction between chemotherapy and immunotherapy in this disease. Furthermore, studies of chemically defined fractions of either bacterial cell wall or tumor cell extracts must be evaluated both in terms of their ability to augment cell mediated immune responses in the melanoma patient, and also in terms of their ability to induce objective benefit for the patient. The possible use of immunotherapy in patients with primary melanoma has been briefly explored but needs further study. Possible additive effects with radiotherapy and immunotherapy should also be looked at in this disease utilizing high dose fractions and other new forms of radiotherapeutic technique.",

Mutations in the putative glycogen synthase kinase 3beta phosphorylation sites near the beta-catenin amino terminus have been found in some cancers and cancer cell lines. The mutations render beta-catenin resistant to regulation by a complex containing the glycogen synthase kinase 3beta, adenomatous polyposis coli, and axin proteins. As a result, beta-catenin accumulates in the cytosol and nucleus and activates T-cell factor/ lymphoid enhancing factor transcription factors. Previously, 6 of 27 melanoma cell lines were found to have beta-catenin exon 3 mutations affecting the N-terminal phosphorylation sites (Rubinfeld B, Robbins P, Elgamil M, Albert I, Porfiri E, Polakis P: Stabilization of beta-catenin by genetic defects in melanoma cell lines. Science 1997, 275:1790-1792). To assess the role of beta-catenin defects in primary melanomas, we undertook immunohistochemical and DNA sequencing studies in 65 melanoma specimens. Nuclear and/or cytoplasmic localization of beta-catenin, a potential indicator of wnt pathway activation, was seen focally within roughly one third of the tumors, though a clonal somatic mutation in beta-catenin was found in only one case (codon 45 Ser-->Pro). Our findings demonstrate that beta-catenin mutations are rare in primary melanoma, in contrast to the situation in melanoma cell lines. Nonetheless, activation of beta-catenin, as indicated by its nuclear and/or cytoplasmic localization, appears to be frequent in melanoma, and in some cases, it may reflect focal and transient activation of the wnt pathway within the tumor.",

Similarly, the association between cutaneous and uveal melanomas in some families, coupled with the high frequency of somatic deletions of the INK4A-ARF locus in uveal melanomas, strongly suggests that mutations in P16(INK4A) and P15 account for a proportion of uveal melanomas.;To examine this proposition, a systematically ascertained series of 385 patients with uveal melanoma were screened for germline mutations in BRCA2, P16(INK4A), P14(ARF), and P15.;One patient was found to harbor a Gly35Ala substitution in exon 1alpha of P16(INK4A), which has previously been reported to be pathogenic. No mutations were detected in P14(ARF) or P15. None of the patients harbored germline nucleotide changes that lead to truncation or that create or disrupt consensus splice sites of BRCA2 or missense variants with clear pathogenic potential.;These findings suggest that less than 2% of cases of uveal melanoma can be ascribed to germline mutations in BRCA2, P16(INK4A), P14(ARF), or P15. It is likely that mutations in other genes contribute to an inherited predisposition to uveal melanoma.",

Similarly, many sarcomas are undifferentiated, i.e. undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas (UPS). Diagnosing melanoma versus sarcoma in an undifferentiated spindle cell malignancy can be challenging. Our aim was to evaluate the prevalence of BRAF mutation in sarcomas and the use of BRAF mutational status in the diagnosis of spindle cell malignancies.;BRAF mutational analysis was performed on tissue from 104 patients: 90 with sarcoma only (50 UPS) and 14 with sarcoma and melanoma (seven UPS). In the sarcoma-only group, BRAF mutation was absent. In the sarcoma-melanoma group, three sarcomas showed BRAF mutation; all were UPS, occurred after the melanomas and did not stain for melanocytic markers. One melanoma-sarcoma pair showed identical BRAF V600E mutations.;The presence of BRAF mutation in these tumours raises the possibility that poorly differentiated spindle cell malignancies with BRAF mutation may represent melanomas, and BRAF mutational analysis should be considered in a patient with a spindle cell malignancy and a history of melanoma, as a positive result may indicate de-differentiated melanoma.",

Initial attempts were made with either nonspecifc inhibitors of BRAF or with MEK inhibitors in studies that were not enriched for tumors with the BRAF mutation. The development of selective BRAF inhibitors that potently inhibit BRAF V600E/K and quench its downstream signaling revolutionized targeted therapy in melanoma. Vemurafenib was the first such agent and was developed in a phase 1 study that determined its maximally tolerated dose (MTD) to be 960 mg taken orally twice a day, and observed unprecedented tumor regression in more than 80% of patients. Those impressive results were confirmed in phase 2 and 3 studies (BRIM2 and BRIM3) and led to the drug's approval by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2011. ",

Primary melanoma cell lines were obtained from a series of patients with either eye or skin melanoma. The ability of tumor cells to stimulate T cells in the absence of exogenous growth factors was assessed in mixed-lymphocyte tumor cell cultures in which allogeneic lymphocytes were stimulated with irradiated ocular or skin melanoma cells. Expression of HLA class I and class II on tumor cells, in the presence or absence of IFN-gamma, was determined by flow cytometry. The ability of tumor cells to inhibit T-cell proliferation was determined by adding various concentrations of irradiated tumor cells to standard mixed-lymphocyte cultures. Our results indicate that primary skin melanoma cells induce vigorous proliferation of allo-antigen-specific T cells. By contrast, ocular melanoma cells failed to induce significant T-cell proliferation. The failure of ocular melanoma cells to stimulate lymphocyte proliferation was not due to low levels of either class I or class II on tumor cells since tumor cells treated with IFN-gamma expressed high levels of class I and class II but still failed to induce lymphocyte proliferation. Ocular melanoma cells inhibited lymphocyte proliferation, as shown by experiments in which a small number of tumor cells prevented proliferation of T cells in mixed-lymphocyte cultures. Inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation required cell-to-cell contact, and supernatants from tumor cell cultures did not prevent lymphocyte proliferation. Moreover, the ability of ocular melanoma cells to inhibit T-cell proliferation was lost when tumor cells migrated from the eye and formed hepatic metastases. We conclude that there is a fundamental difference in the immunogenicity of ocular and skin melanoma cells. Ocular melanomas, but not primary skin melanomas, are poorly immunogenic tumors that inhibit T-cell proliferation.

Germ line mutations in BRAF have not been identified as causal in families predisposed to melanoma.

Polymorphisms or other variants in the BRAF gene may therefore act as candidate low-penetrance genes for nevus/melanoma susceptibility. We hypothesized that promoter variants would be the most likely candidates for determinants of risk. Using denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography and sequencing, we screened peripheral blood DNA from 184 familial melanoma cases for BRAF promoter variants. We identified a promoter insertion/deletion in linkage disequilibrium with the previously described BRAF polymorphism in intron 11 (rs1639679) reported to be associated with melanoma susceptibility in males. We therefore investigated the contribution of this BRAF polymorphism to melanoma susceptibility in 581 consecutively recruited incident cases, 258 incident cases in a study of late relapse, 673 female general practitioner controls, and the 184 familial cases. We found no statistically significant difference in either genotype or allele frequencies between cases and controls overall or between male and female cases for the BRAF polymorphism in the two incident case series. Our results therefore suggest that the BRAF polymorphism is not significantly associated with melanoma and the promoter insertion/deletion linked with the polymorphism is not a causal variant.

Parallel with progression, melanoma acquires a rich vascular network, whereas an increasing number of tumor cells express the laminin receptor, which enables their adhesion to the vascular wall, favouring tumor cell extravasation and metastases. Melanoma neovascularization has been correlated with poor prognosis, overall survival, ulceration and increased rate of relapse. Secretion of various angiogenic cytokines, i.e. VEGF-A, FGF-2, PGF-1 and -2, IL-8, and TGF-1 by melanoma cells promote the angiogenic switch and has been correlated to transition from the radial to the vertical growth phase, and to the metastatic phase.

        "Doc_abstract":"Traditionally, the diagnosis of metastatic melanoma was terminal to most patients. However, the advancements towards understanding the fundamental etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment have raised melanoma to the forefront of contemporary medicine. Indeed, the evidence of durable remissions are being heard ever more frequently in clinics around the globe. Despite having more gene mutations per cell than any other type of cancer, investigators are overcoming complex genomic landscapes, signaling pathways, and immune checkpoints by generating novel technological methods and clinical protocols with breath-taking speed. Significant progress in deciphering molecular genetics, epigenetics, kinase-driven networks, metabolomics, and immune-enhancing pathways to achieve personalized and positive outcomes has truly provided new hope for melanoma patients. However, obstacles requiring breakthroughs include understanding the influence of sunlight exposure on melanoma etiology, and overcoming all too frequently acquired drug resistance, complicating targeted therapy. Pathologists continue to have critically important roles in advancing the field, particularly in the area of transitioning from microscope-based diagnostic reports to pharmacogenomics through molecularly informed tumor boards. Although melanoma is no longer considered just 'one disease', pathologists will continue this rapidly progressing and exciting journey to identify tumor subtypes, to utilize tumorgraft or so-called patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, and to develop companion diagnostics to keep pace with the bewildering breakthroughs occurring on a regular basis. Exactly which combination of drugs will ultimately be required to eradicate melanoma cells remains to be determined. However, it is clear that pathologists who are as dedicated to melanoma as the pioneering pathologist Dr Sidney Farber was committed to childhood cancers, will be required as the battle against melanoma continues. In this review, we describe what sets melanoma apart from other tumors, and demonstrate how lessons learned in the melanoma clinic are being transferred to many other types of aggressive neoplasms.

Adjuvant therapy is an appropriate treatment modality in this setting, and is more likely to be effective as the tumour burden here is small. Clinical observations of spontaneous tumour regressions and a highly variable rate of disease progression suggest a role of the immune system in the natural history of melanoma. Biological agents have therefore been the subjects of numerous adjuvant studies. Early, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), levamisole, Corynebacterium parvum, chemotherapy, isolated limb perfusion (ILP), radiotherapy, transfer factor (TF), megestrol acetate and vitamin A yielded largely negative results. Current trials focus on vaccines and the interferons. To date the latter is the only therapy to have shown a significant benefit in the prospective randomised controlled phase III setting. This report represents a systematic review of studies in adjuvant therapy in melanoma. Data from ongoing studies is awaited before a role for adjuvant agents in high risk melanoma is confirmed.",

Although a great deal of progress has been made in the past decade, including the development of immunotherapy using immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapy using BRAF, MEK or KIT inhibitors, treatment for unresectable stage III, stage IV, and recurrent melanoma is still challenging with limited response rate, severe side effects and poor prognosis, highlighting an urgent need for discovering and designing more effective approaches to conquer melanoma. Melanoma is not only driven by malignant melanocytes, but also by the altered communication between neoplastic cells and non-malignant cell populations, including fibroblasts, endothelial and inflammatory cells, in the tumor stroma. Infiltrated and surrounding fibroblasts, also known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), exhibit both phenotypical and physiological differences compared to normal dermal fibroblasts. They acquire properties of myofibroblasts, remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM) and architecture of the diseased tissue and secrete chemical factors, which all together promote the transformation process by encouraging tumor growth, angiogenesis, inflammation and metastasis and contribute to drug resistance. A number of in vitro and in vivo experiments have shown that stromal fibroblasts promote melanoma cell proliferation and they have been targeted to suppress tumor growth effectively. Evidently, a combination therapy co-targeting tumor cells and stromal fibroblasts may provide promising strategies to improve therapeutic outcomes and overcome treatment resistance. A significant benefit of targeting CAFs is that the approach aims to create a tumor-resistant environment that inhibits growth of melanomas carrying different genetic mutations. However, the origin of CAFs and precise mechanisms by which CAFs contribute to melanoma progression and drug resistance remain poorly understood. In this review, we discuss the origin, activation and heterogeneity of CAFs in the melanoma tumor microenvironment and examine the contributions of stromal fibroblasts at different stages of melanoma development. We also highlight the recent progression in dissecting and characterizing how local fibroblasts become reprogrammed and build a dynamic yet optimal microenvironment for tumors to develop and metastasize. In addition, we review key developments in ongoing preclinical studies and clinical applications targeting CAFs and tumor-stroma interactions for melanoma treatment. ",

Thus, identifying the key mutation events underlying the etiology of metastatic melanoma will no doubt lead to the improvement of existing therapeutic approaches and the development of new treatment strategies. Significant advances toward understanding the complexity of the melanoma genome have recently been achieved using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. However, identifying those mutations driving tumorigenesis will continue to be a challenge for researchers, in part because of the high rates of mutation compared to other cancers. This article will review the catalog of mutations identified in melanoma through a variety of approaches, including the use of unbiased exome and whole-genome NGS platforms, as well discuss complementary strategies for identifying driver mutations.

We analysed the DNA from 39 patients with primary and metastatic melanomas, and from 9 melanoma cell lines.;The SSCP technique showed heterozygous defects in the p53 gene in 8 of 39 (20.5%) melanoma tumors: three point mutations in intron sequences (introns 1 and 2) and exon 10, and three new polymorphisms located in introns 1 and 2 (C to T transition at position 11701 in intron 1; C insertion at position 11818 in intron 2; and C insertion at position 11875 in intron 2). One melanoma tumor exhibited two heterozygous alterations in the p16 exon 1 (stop codon and missense mutation). No defects were found in the remaining genes. Homozygous deletions were more frequent in melanoma cell lines than in melanoma tumors in p21, p16 and p15 (22.2%, 44.4%, and 44.4% versus 7.7%, 2.5%, and 5.1% respectively).

The level of beta-catenin is regulated through GSK-3beta phosphorylation of specific serine and threonine residues, all of which are encoded for in exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene (CTNNB1). Mutations altering the GSK-3beta phosphorylation sites lead to cellular accumulation of beta-catenin and constitutive transcription of Tcf/Lef target genes. Such mutations have previously been found in melanoma cell lines. In our study, primary melanomas and their corresponding metastases were screened for CTNNB1 exon 3 mutations using single-strand conformation polymorphism and nucleotide sequence analysis. One of 31 primary tumors and 1 of 37 metastases, both originating from the same patient, had a TCT to TTT mutation at codon 45, changing serine to phenylalanine. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed membranous localization of beta-catenin in a majority of the samples. The mutated primary tumor and metastasis, however, displayed widespread cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of beta-catenin. An additional 30% of the primary tumors showed focal cytoplasmic and nuclear staining. Thus, beta-catenin exon 3 mutations are rare in primary as well as metastatic melanomas and do not explain the abnormal cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of beta-catenin found in a relatively large fraction of primary melanomas.",

Inhibition of BRAF(V600E) blocks melanoma cell invasion. In a BRAF(V600E)-driven murine melanoma model or in patients' tumor biopsies, cortactin foci decrease upon inhibitor treatment. In addition, genome-wide expression analysis shows that a number of invadopodia-related genes are downregulated after BRAF(V600E) inhibition. Mechanistically, BRAF(V600E) induces phosphorylation of cortactin and the exocyst subunit Exo70 through ERK, which regulates actin dynamics and matrix metalloprotease secretion, respectively.

Malignant melanoma is a dreadful cancer type that has been associated with the rapid dissemination of primary tumors to multiple sites, including bone, brain, liver and lungs. The discovery that approximately 40%-50% of malignant melanomas contain a mutation in BRAF at codon 600 gave scientists a new approach to tackle this disease. However, clinical studies on patients have shown that although BRAFi (BRAF inhibitors) trigger early anti-tumor responses, the majority of patients later develop resistance to the therapy. Recent studies have shown that WNT5A plays a key role in enhancing the resistance of melanoma cells to BRAFi. The focus of the current review will be on melanoma development, signaling pathways important to acquired resistance to BRAFi, and why WNT5A inhibitors are attractive candidates to be included in combinatorial therapies for melanoma.

There are over 3.5 million NMSC diagnoses in two million patients annually, with men having a 3-fold greater incidence of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) compared with women. Chronic inflammation has been linked to tumorigenesis, with a key role for the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme. Diclofenac, a COX-2 inhibitor and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, currently is prescribed to patients as a short-term therapeutic agent to induce SCC precursor lesion regression. However, its efficacy as a preventative agent in patients without evidence of precursor lesions but with significant UVB-induced cutaneous damage has not been explored. We previously demonstrated in a murine model of UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis that when exposed to equivalent UVB doses, male mice had lower levels of inflammation but developed increased tumor multiplicity, burden and grade compared with female mice. Because of the discrepancy in the degree of inflammation between male and female skin, we sought to determine if topical treatment of previously damaged skin with an anti-inflammatory COX-2 inhibitor would decrease tumor burden and if it would be equally effective in the sexes. Our results demonstrated that despite observed sex differences in the inflammatory response, prolonged topical diclofenac treatment of chronically UVB-damaged skin effectively reduced tumor multiplicity in both sexes. Unexpectedly, tumor burden was significantly decreased only in male mice. Our data suggest a new therapeutic use for currently available topical diclofenac as a preventative intervention for patients predisposed to cutaneous SCC development before lesions appear.",

Global miRNA expression profiles of a set of melanoma lymph node metastases, melanoma cell lines, and melanocyte cultures were determined using Agilent array. Deregulated miRNAs were evaluated in relation with clinical characteristics, patient survival, and mutational status for BRAF and NRAS. Several miRNAs were differentially expressed between melanocytes and melanomas as well as melanoma cell lines. In melanomas, miR-193a, miR-338, and miR-565 were underexpressed in cases with a BRAF mutation. Furthermore, low expression of miR-191 and high expression of miR-193b were associated with poor melanoma-specific survival. In conclusion, our findings show miRNA dysregulation in malignant melanoma and its relation to established molecular backgrounds of BRAF and NRAS oncogenic mutations.

A majority of Swedish families with hereditary melanoma predisposition thus lack germline mutations in these cell cycle G1 checkpoint-regulating genes. Additional genes with the potential to contribute to increased melanoma risk may code for related components of the cell cycle-regulating machinery. The gene for cyclin-dependent kinase 4, CDK4, has been found in mutated form in the germline from individuals belonging to 2 melanoma kindreds in the United States. The CDKN2C gene coding for the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p18 is localized on 1p32, a region frequently involved in chromosomal changes in melanomas and other tumors. The TP53 suppressor gene, involved in cell cycle regulation and maintenance of genetic stability, is found mutated in the germline of patients with hereditary Li-Fraumeni syndrome, leading to early onset of several human cancers, including melanoma. The present investigation reports the results of screening the 100 Swedish melanoma families for germline mutations in the CDK4, CDKN2C and TP53 genes.

        "Doc_abstract":"The incidence of cutaneous melanoma has risen at a rate significantly higher than that for other malignancies. This increase persists despite efforts to educate the public about the dangers of excess exposure to UV radiation from both the sun and tanning beds. Melanoma affects a relatively younger population and is notorious for its propensity to metastasize and for its poor response to current therapeutic regimens. These factors make prevention an integral component to the goal of decreasing melanoma-related mortality. Transformation of melanocytes into malignant melanoma involves the interplay between genetic factors, UV exposure, and the tumor microenvironment. The roles of UV radiation in the etiology of melanoma are mediated by both direct damage of DNA through formation of photoproducts and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Many of the promising antioxidant agents under development for the prevention of melanoma are derived from foodstuffs. B-Raf is a member of the Raf kinase family of serine/threonine-specific protein kinases that plays a role in regulating the MAP kinase/ERKs signaling pathway. About 50 % of melanomas harbor activating BRAF mutations. BRAF mutations are found in 59 % of the melanomas arising in skin with intermittent sun exposure, such as trunk and arms, as compared with only 23 % of the acral melanomas, 11 % of mucosal melanomas, and 0 % of uveal melanomas. Two new agents, ipilimumab and vemurafenib, have been shown to improve outcome of advanced melanoma as presented at the plenary session of the 2011 annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Vemurafenib is the first personalized compound which demonstrated an improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in metastatic melanoma harboring the BRAFV600 mutation and represents the first drug of a class that exerts its anti-proliferative activity through inhibition of a highly specific molecular target. GSK2118436 (dabrafenib), the second BRAF inhibitor, in phase I and II trial obtained similar results to vemurafenib. A phase III trial is now ongoing. Taken together, the early clinical development of vemurafenib and dabrafenib clearly confirms that BRAF inhibitors can halt or reverse disease in patients with melanomas carrying this mutation, improving survival times compared with historically standard treatments (chemotherapy and interleukin-2). The clinical development of other new BRAF inhibitors such as RAF265 and LGX818 is now ongoing. Combination strategies of BRAF inhibitors with ipilimumab, an anti-CTLA-4 antibody, and/or MEK inhibitors or metformin are now under investigation in clinical trials. ",

These CTLs recognize a common tumor-associated antigen in the presence of HLA class I determinants, suggesting that allogeneic melanomas which express the restricting HLA-A region antigen could substitute for the autologous tumor in the generation of CTLs. This was investigated in the HLA-A2 system. Four T-cell lines were established by stimulation of lymphocytes with either autologous tumor or an HLA-A2-matched allogeneic melanoma. Allogeneic stimulated CTLs specifically lysed the autologous tumor and demonstrated an identical pattern of HLA-A2 restriction, when compared to the autologous stimulated CTLs. Lysis by the allogeneic stimulated CTLs was blocked by a monoclonal antibody to HLA class I antigens; lysis was also inhibited by both autologous tumor or HLA-A2 allogeneic melanomas when evaluated in cold target competition studies. The allogeneic stimulated CTLs proliferated in response to both autologous tumor and HLA-A2 melanomas, but not in response to HLA-A2 nonmelanomas. By phenotypic analysis these CTLs were CD3+ and predominantly CD8+ cells. We conclude that autologous tumor-specific CTLs can be generated using HLA-A region-matched allogeneic melanomas for stimulation. Since established, HLA-typed melanoma tumor lines can be used in the absence of autologous tumor; this procedure can be applied clinically to a broad patient population and may prove useful in the adoptive immunotherapy of melanoma.",

With the exception of melanoma-prone heritable syndromes which have mutations of repair genes, there is little evidence for somatic mutation of known repair genes. Cell cycle checkpoint controls are tightly associated with repair mechanisms, arresting cells to allow for repair before continuing through the cell cycle. Checkpoint signaling components also regulate the repair mechanisms. Defects in checkpoint mechanisms have been identified in melanomas and are likely to be responsible for increased mutation load in melanoma.

Melanoma is an increasingly common malignancy as well, and its mortality rates have been rapidly increasing above those of any other cancer in recent years. Surgical resection and systemic chemotherapy are the main therapeutic strategies for the treatment of malignant melanoma. However, these approaches are insufficiently effective and may be associated with significant adverse effects. Angiogenesis, a process by which new vascular networks are formed from pre-existing capillaries, is required for tumors to grow, invade and metastasize. Tumor vessels are genetically stable, and less likely to accumulate mutations that allow them to develop drug resistance in a rapid manner. Therefore, targeting vasculatures that support tumor growth, rather than cancer cells, is considered the most promising approach to malignant melanoma therapy. Now, novel anti-angiogenic agents with tolerable side effects is actually desired for the treatment of patients with malignant melanoma. In this paper, we review the current understanding of anti-angiogenic therapy for malignant melanoma, especially focusing on pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), which was recently identified as the most potent endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis in the mammalian eye.

Our results identify specific genetic lesions in glioblastoma, melanoma, and pancreatic cancers and indicate that CAN genes and their mutational profiles are tumor specific. Some of the mutated genes, such as the tyrosine kinase EPHA3, are clearly amenable to pharmacologic intervention and could represent novel therapeutic targets for these incurable cancers. We also speculate that similar to other oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, mutations affecting OBSCN could be involved in cancer predisposition.",

Mutational activation of BRAF is the most prevalent genetic alteration in human melanoma, resulting in constitutive melanoma hyperproliferation. A selective BRAF inhibitor showed remarkable clinical activity in patients with mutated BRAF. Unfortunately, most patients acquire resistance to the BRAF inhibitor, highlighting the urgent need for new melanoma treatment strategies. Green tea polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG) inhibits cell proliferation independently of BRAF inhibitor sensitivity, suggesting that increased understanding of the anti-melanoma activity of EGCG may provide a novel therapeutic target. Here, by performing functional genetic screening, we identified protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) as a critical factor in the suppression of melanoma cell proliferation. We demonstrated that tumor-overexpressed 67-kDa laminin receptor (67LR) activates PP2A through adenylate cyclase/cAMP pathway eliciting inhibitions of oncoproteins and activation of tumor suppressor Merlin. Activating 67LR/PP2A pathway leading to melanoma-specific mTOR inhibition shows strong synergy with the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 in the drug-resistant melanoma. Moreover, SET, a potent inhibitor of PP2A, is overexpressed on malignant melanoma. Silencing of SET enhances 67LR/PP2A signaling. Collectively, activation of 67LR/PP2A signaling may thus be a novel rational strategy for melanoma-specific treatment. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Constitutive upregulation of the MAPK pathway by a BRAF(V600) mutation occurs in about half of melanomas. This leads to increased oncogenic properties such as tumor cell invasion, metastatic potential, and resistance to apoptosis. Blockade of the MAPK pathway with highly specific kinase inhibitors induces unprecedented tumor response rates in patients with advanced BRAF(V600) mutant melanoma. Immune checkpoint blockade with monoclonal antibodies targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 and programed death-1/PD-L1 has also demonstrated striking anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced melanoma. Tumor responses are likely limited by multiple additional layers of immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment. There is emerging preclinical and clinical evidence suggesting that MAPK inhibition has a beneficial effect on the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, providing a strong rationale for combined immunotherapy and MAPK pathway inhibition in melanoma. The T cell response has been the main focus in the studies reported to date. Since dendritic cells (DCs) are important in the induction of tumor-specific T cell responses, the impact of MAPK pathway activation in melanoma on DC function is critical for the melanoma directed immune response. BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells modulate DCs through the MAPK pathway because its blockade in melanoma cells can reverse suppression of DC function. As both MEK/BRAF inhibition and immune checkpoint blockade have recently taken center stage in the treatment of melanoma, a deeper understanding of how MAPK pathway inhibition affects the tumor immune response is needed.

In this regard, immunotherapies involving adoptive cell transfer (ACT) of tumor-specific T-cells constitute a promising approach to treat melanoma. However, these cells do not always preexist in the patient or are difficult to isolate and/or expand. Thus, as the specificity of T-lymphocytes is determined by their T-cell receptor (TCR), it is possible to convert peripheral T-cells into cancer specific lymphocytes by transducing them to express a receptor that recognizes a defined tumor epitope. To this end, retroviral vectors can be used to efficiently transduce actively dividing cells such as proliferating T cells, while being relatively safe to the user.

To remedy this issue, this article took an aim at presenting a literature review concerning extracutaneous malignant melanomas. It also reports several cases of extracutaneous melanomas, which I came across in my 15 years of surgical and molecular pathology practice. The study raises several notions. Extracutaneous malignant melanomas are rare but extremely aggressive lesions with a grim outcome. They include ocular, metastatic, anorectal, mucosal, nail beds, conjunctival, vaginal, urogenital, orbital, esophageal, and leptomeningial malignant melanomas. The development of these lesions lacks an association with sun damage, family history, or precursor nevi. These lesions cause considerable diagnostic consternation and their distinction from other types of tumors (such as undifferentiated carcinomas, high-grade sarcomas, and lymphomas) is critical both from a diagnostic and prognostic point of view. In the proper clinical, histological, and cytological context, immunopositivity for S100 protein, HMB45, and vimentin allows the distinction of these malignant melanomas from other histologically similar malignancies. To conclude, extracutaneous melanoma should be considered while undifferentiated neoplasms, especially those displaying prominent eosinophilic nucleoli, and the coexistence of epithelioid and spindle cells.

Our group previously reported that in vitro riluzole treatment reduces cell growth in three-dimensional (3D) soft agar colony assays by 80% in cells with wildtype phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway activation. However, melanoma cell lines harboring constitutive activating mutations of the PI3K pathway (PTEN and NRAS mutations) showed only a 35% to 40% decrease in colony formation in soft agar in the presence of riluzole. In this study, we have continued our preclinical studies of riluzole and its effect on melanoma cells alone and in combination with inhibitors of the PI3 kinase pathway: the AKT inhibitor, API-2, and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, rapamycin. We modeled these combinatorial therapies on various melanoma cell lines in 3D and 2D systems and in vivo. Riluzole combined with mTOR inhibition is more effective at halting melanoma anchorage-independent growth and xenograft tumor progression than either agent alone. PI3K signaling changes associated with this combinatorial treatment shows that 3D (nanoculture) modeling of cell signaling more closely resembles in vivo signaling than monolayer models. Riluzole combined with mTOR inhibition is effective at halting tumor cell progression independent of BRAF mutational status. This makes this combinatorial therapy a potentially viable alternative for metastatic melanoma patients who are BRAF WT and are therefore ineligible for vemurafenib therapy. ",

Four of the tumor-specific CTL lines lysed autologous fresh tumor cells. Tumor-specific CTLs from two of three patients had cytolytic activity identical with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) derived from tumor biopsies removed earlier and grown in high concentrations (6000 IU/ml) of IL-2. Three of the HLA-A2-restricted tumor-specific CTLs were shown to recognize 293 cells transfected with HLA-A2.1 cDNA and the gene encoding the melanoma Ag, MART-1. In addition, these CTLs recognized the T2 cell line pulsed exogenously with the peptide MART-1(27-35), which is the nine-amino acid immunodominant epitope of the MART-1 Ag recognized on melanoma tumor cells by nearly all HLA-A2-restricted TIL. Thus, we have demonstrated the ability to generate tumor-specific CTLs from PBLs that are similar in their reactivity to TIL.

The antigens identified in mouse model systems appear, with one exception, to represent the products of mutated genes. In contrast, most of the antigens recognized by human tumor-reactive T cells reported to date appear to represent the products of non-mutated genes. Here we report the isolation of a cDNA clone encoding beta-catenin, which was shown to be recognized by the tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) 1290, a HLA-A24 restricted melanoma-specific CTL line from patient 888. The cDNA clone, which was isolated from the autologous melanoma cDNA library, differed by a single base pair from the published beta-catenin sequence, resulting in a change from a serine to a phenylalanine residue at position 37. Normal tissues from this patient did not express the altered sequence, nor did 12 allogeneic melanomas, indicating that this represented a unique mutation in this patient's melanoma. A peptide corresponding to the sequence between amino acids 29 and 37 of the mutant gene product was identified as the T cell epitope recognized by TIL 1290. The observation that HLA-A24 binding peptides contain an aromatic or hydrophobic residue at position 9 suggested that the change at position 37 may have generated a peptide (SYLDSGIHF) which was capable of binding to HLA-A24, and a competitive binding assay confirmed this hypothesis. The beta-catenin protein has been shown previously to be involved in cell adhesion mediated through the cadherin family of cell surface adhesion molecules. The high frequency of mutations found in members of cellular adhesion complexes in a variety of cancers suggests that these molecules may play a role in development of the malignant phenotype.",

The large increases in diagnosis of melanoma without commensurate increases in advanced tumors and mortality are not compatible with presumed malignant behavior of thin melanomas. Increased intensity of melanoma surveillance may artificially increase the incidence of melanoma by harvesting histologically \"malignant\" but biologically benign tumors. Little available evidence suggests the presence of an actual increase in the frequency of biologically malignant tumors. Attempts to increase screening intensity for melanoma may result in further increases in diagnosis of melanomas. Nevertheless, limitations in histopathologic diagnostic techniques will continue to hinder efforts at early identification of those at risk for death from melanoma without diagnosing melanoma in large numbers of patients with biologically benign pigmented skin tumors.",

Because PTEN negatively regulates on the downstream effects of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3-K), we hypothesized that the loss of PTEN/MMAC1 and the activation of RAS may be largely equivalent because RAS is a known positive upstream regulator of PI3-K. We expanded our previous survey of PTEN/MMAC1 mutations and analyzed the RAS status of 53 cutaneous melanoma cell lines, 18 glioma cell lines, and 17 uncultured cutaneous melanoma metastasis. Overall, 51% of the cell lines had alterations in either PTEN/MMAC1 or RAS. We found 16 cell lines (30%) with alterations in PTEN/MMAC1 and 11 cell lines (21%) with activating NRAS mutations; only 1 cell line had concurrent alterations in both genes. Moreover, glioma cell lines with a high frequency of PTEN/MMAC1 inactivation had no identifiable RAS alterations. Ectopic expression of PTEN in several cutaneous melanoma cell lines suppressed colony formation irrespective of PTEN/MMAC1 status; furthermore, PTEN expression in cell lines carrying activated RAS also suppressed colony formation.

In addition, primary melanomas and metastases contain cells expressing the stem cell marker nestin suggesting a hierarchical structure of the tumors comprised of primitive nestin-expressing precursors and differentiated cells.

Malignant Melanoma is an increasingly common malignancy and also one the most invasive and metastatic tumors, and its mortality rates have been rapidly increasing above those of any other cancer in recent years. Surgical resection and systemic chemotherapy are the main therapeutic strategies for the treatment of malignant melanoma. However, these approaches are insufficiently effective and may be associated with significant adverse effects. Angiogenesis, a process by which new vascular networks are formed from pre-existing capillaries, is required for tumors to grow, invade and metastasize. Tumor vessels are genetically stable, and less likely to accumulate mutations that allow them to develop drug resistance in a rapid manner. Therefore, targeting vasculatures that support tumor growth, rather than cancer cells, is currently considered the most promising approach to malignant melanoma therapy. Now, novel anti-angiogenic agents with tolerable side effects are actually desired for the treatment of patients with malignant melanoma.

In kindreds with p16M alleles, the risk of pancreatic cancer was increased by a factor of 13 in the prospective period (2 cases observed, 0.15 expected; standardized incidence ratio, 13.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 47.4) and by a factor of 22 in the entire period (7 cases observed, 0.32 expected; standardized incidence ratio, 21.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 8.7 to 44.8). In contrast, we found no cases of pancreatic cancer in kindred with p16W alleles.;The development of pancreatic cancer in kindreds prone to melanoma may require a p16M mutation. Genetic factors, such as the kind of mutation found in p16INK4, may explain the inconsistent occurrence of other cancers in these kindreds.",

In cell culture supernatants of human melanoma cell lines a 70 kDa soluble CD44 protein (solCD44) was detected at concentrations of 250-300 ng/ml. Protease inhibitor studies revealed that serine proteases and metalloproteases are involved in the cleavage of CD44 from the surface of melanoma cells. To analyse a possible function of soluble CD44 a human malignant melanoma cell line was stably transfected with cDNAs encoding either wild type soluble CD44s or mutated forms with defective HA binding properties (CD44sR41A and CD44sR150A/R154A). Soluble CD44s almost completely inhibited hyaluronic acid binding by melanoma cells, whereas soluble CD44 mutated in the HA binding domain had no effect. When cultivated on hyaluronic acid, melanoma cell proliferation was induced by 30% for both the parental and the control transfected cells. This increase in proliferation was blocked completely in solCD44s-secreting transfectants, whereas solCD44sR41A and solCD44sR150A/R154A-secreting cells again showed hyaluronic acid-induced cell proliferation. These cell lines were subcutaneously injected into MF1 nu/nu mice to compare their growth as tumors in vivo. Compared to tumors derived from parental and control transfected cells, we observed a dramatic reduction of primary tumor growth with solCD44s expressing MM cells. Transfectants expressing solCD44s mutated in the HA binding domain in contrast developed fast-growing primary tumors. These results provide strong evidence that direct solCD44 interactions with hyaluronic acid interfere competitively with processes induced by hyaluronic acid binding to surface CD44. Autocrine, or drug-induced secretion of solCD44 by human melanoma cells may thus exert potent antitumoral effects in vivo.",

To this end we set-up primary skin cell co-cultures from siblings of melanoma prone-families that were later analyzed using the expression array approach. As a result, we found that 1535 transcripts were deregulated in CDKN2A mutated cells, with over-expression of immunity-related genes (HLA-DPB1, CLEC2B, IFI44, IFI44L, IFI27, IFIT1, IFIT2, SP110 and IFNK) and down-regulation of genes playing a role in the Notch signaling pathway. 3570 transcripts were deregulated in MC1R variant carriers. In particular, genes related to oxidative stress and DNA damage pathways were up-regulated as well as genes associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer and Huntington. Finally, we observed that the expression signatures indentified in phenotypically normal cells carrying CDKN2A mutations or MC1R variants are maintained in skin cancer tumors (melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma).

We have analyzed here p53 mutations in melanoma cell lines and studied its stabilization, DNA-binding activity, and target gene activation by UVC. p53 was mutated in three of seven melanoma cell lines. However, high levels of p53 were detected in all cell lines, including melanoma cells with wild-type p53, with the exception of one line with a truncated form. Upon UV induction, p53 accumulated in lines with wild-type p53, and p53 target genes p21Cip1/Waf1, GADD45, and mdm2 were induced, but the induction of p21Cip1/Waf1 was significantly delayed as compared with the increase in p53 DNA-binding activity. However, despite p53 target gene induction, p53 DNA-binding activity was absent in one melanoma line with wild-type p53, and p53 target genes were induced also in cells with mutant p53. In response to UV, DNA replication ceased in all cell lines, and apoptosis ensued in four lines independently of p53 but correlated with high induction of GADD45. The results suggest that in melanoma, several p53 regulatory steps are dislodged; its basal expression is high, its activation in response to UV damage is diminished, and the regulation of its target genes p21Cip1/Waf1 and GADD45 are dissociated from p53 regulation.",

Already at 3 days transgenic kita-GFP-RAS larvae show a hyper-pigmentation phenotype as earliest evidence of abnormal melanocyte growth. By 2-4 weeks, masses of transformed melanocytes form in the tail stalk of the majority of kita-GFP-RAS transgenic fish.

Furthermore, they show transplantability, dependence on mitfa expression and do not require additional mutations in tumor suppressors. In contrast to kita expressing melanocyte progenitors that efficiently develop melanoma, mitfa expressing progenitors in a second Gal4-driver line were 4 times less efficient in developing melanoma during the three months observation period.;This indicates that zebrafish kita promoter is a powerful tool for driving oncogene expression in the right cells and at the right level to induce early onset melanoma in the presence of tumor suppressors.

Upon treatment with the CRAF inhibitor sorafenib, these lines underwent apoptosis and associated with mitochondrial depolarization and relocalization of apoptosis-inducing factor, whereas the BRAF-V600E-mutated melanomas did not. Studies have shown low-activity mutants of BRAF (G469E/D594G) instead signal through CRAF. Unlike BRAF, CRAF directly regulates apoptosis through mitochondrial localization where it binds to Bcl-2 and phosphorylates BAD. The CRAF inhibitor sorafenib was found to induce a time-dependent reduction in both BAD phosphorylation and Bcl-2 expression in the D594G/G469E lines only. Knockdown of CRAF using a lentiviral shRNA suppressed both Bcl-2 expression and induced apoptosis in the D594G melanoma line but not in a V600E-mutated line. Finally, we showed in a series of xenograft studies that sorafenib was more potent at reducing the growth of tumors with the D594G mutation than those with the V600E mutation.

Melanocytes are pigment-producing cells of the epidermis, precursors for melanoma, and express high levels of Plexin C1, which is lost in melanoma in vitro and in vivo. To determine if Plexin C1 is a tumor suppressor for melanoma, we introduced Plexin C1 into a primary human melanoma cell line, and phenotypes including migration, apoptosis, proliferation and tumor growth in mice were analyzed. Complimentary studies in which Plexin C1 was silenced in human melanocytes were performed. Plexin C1 significantly inhibited migration and proliferation in melanoma, whereas in melanocytes, loss of Plexin C1 increased migration and proliferation. In mouse xenografts, Plexin C1 delayed tumor growth of melanoma at early time points, but tumors eventually escaped the suppressive effects of Plexin C1, due to Plexin C1-dependent activation of the pro-survival protein Akt. R-Ras activation stimulates melanoma migration. Plexin C1 lowered R-Ras activity in melanoma and melanocytes, consistent with inhibitory effects of Plexin C1 on migration of melanocytes and melanoma. To determine if R-Ras is expressed in melanocytic lesions in vivo, staining of tissue microarrays of nevi and melanoma were performed. R-Ras expression was highly limited in melanocytic lesions, being essentially confined to primary melanoma, and almost completely absent in nevi and metastatic melanoma. These data suggest that loss of Plexin C1 in melanoma may promote early steps in melanoma progression through suppression of migration and proliferation, but pro-survival effects of Plexin C1 ultimately abrogate the tumor suppressive effects of Plexin C1. In primary melanoma, loss of Plexin C1 may function in early steps of melanoma progression by releasing inhibition of R-Ras activation, and stimulating migration.",

Best overall response rate (BORR) was 29% (21% excluding nonconfirmed responses) with a two-stage 95% CI of 13% to 51%. BORR was significantly greater than the hypothesized null of 5% and statistically significantly different by mutation status (7 of 13 or 54% KIT mutated v 0% KIT amplified only). There were no statistical differences in rates of progression or survival by mutation status or by melanoma site. The overall disease control rate was 50% but varied significantly by KIT mutation status (77% mutated v 18% amplified). Four patients harbored pretreatment NRAS mutations, and one patient acquired increased KIT amplification after treatment.;Melanomas that arise on mucosal, acral, or CSD skin should be assessed for KIT mutations. Imatinib can be effective when tumors harbor KIT mutations, but not if KIT is amplified only. NRAS mutations and KIT copy number gain may be mechanisms of therapeutic resistance to imatinib.",

Intriguingly, the p53 tumor suppressor, a main mediator of chemoresistance in other tumor types, is rarely mutated in melanoma. However, we have previously shown that anti-apoptotic isoforms of p73 (deltaTA-p73), another member of the p53 family, are overexpressed in metastatic melanomas. DeltaTA-p73 can oppose the pro-apoptotic functions of p53 and full length p73, and thus it could contribute to melanoma chemoresistance. In this study, we use an efficient adenoviral-based gene transfer approach to introduce a transcriptionally active form of p73 (TA-p73beta) in melanoma cells, with the objective of overcoming drug resistance. Interestingly, TA-p73beta significantly sensitized 5 out of 7 aggressive melanoma cell lines to the standard therapeutic agents adriamycin and cisplatin. More importantly, TA-p73beta displayed a synergistic effect in vivo allowing adriamycin or cisplatin to block melanoma cell growth in mouse xenograft models (p < 0.05). In summary, our data show that Ad-mediated TA-p73beta gene expression can markedly sensitize a subset of melanoma cell lines to adriamycin and cisplatin in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a new chemosensitization strategy for malignant melanomas.",

We compared wild type and Ncf1 (m1J) mutated mice, which lack functional NOX2 complex, in four different tumor models. Ncf1 (m1J) mutated mice developed significantly smaller tumors in two melanoma models in which B16 melanoma cells expressing a hematopoietic growth factor FLT3L or luciferase reporter were used.

In the spontaneously arising prostate carcinoma model (TRAMP), tumor growth was not affected. The lack of ROS-mediated protection against tumor growth was associated with increased production of immunity-associated cytokines. A significant increase in Th2 associated cytokines was observed in the LLC model.

We combined IL-12 gene transfer with 4-1BB costimulation to explore a previously noted cooperative anti-tumor effect against this model tumor. We hypothesize that the innate immune response mediated by IL-12-activated natural killer (NK) cells initiates the activation of the immune system, leading to the priming of T cells, whereas 4-1BB costimulation enhances the function of primed tumor-specific T cells. The effect of the combination therapy on the growth of subcutaneous (s.c.) tumors and pulmonary metastasis was examined. The combination therapy significantly retarded the growth of subcutaneously-inoculated tumors, and 50% of tumor-bearing mice survived with complete tumor regression. In contrast, neither IL-12 gene transfer nor anti-4-1BB antibody administration alone was as effective. Enhanced CTL activity against both B16-F10 tumor cells and TRP-2-pulsed EL4 syngeneic tumor cells was observed in tumor-bearing animals treated with the combination therapy 2 weeks after treatment and, in long-term survivors from this combination therapy, at >120 days. In a pulmonary metastatic model, only the combination therapy generated significant protection against metastasis. In vivo depletion of NK or CD8(+) but not CD4(+) subsets eliminated the protective immunity. Furthermore, NK cell depletion significantly reduced both tumor-specific CTL activity and the number of tumor-specific IFN-gamma-producing cells, suggesting that this synergistic effect requires the participation of both NK and CD8(+) T cells.",

However, a considerable overlapping of ultrasonographic parameters, such as tumor solidity, vascularity, and choroidal excavation, has been demonstrated for choroidal melanomas and metastases. We have found that choroidal metastases are characterized by a significantly lower height-to-base ratio than melanomas, whereas reflectivity is significantly higher in metastases. Thus the combined use of height-to-base ratio and reflectivity provides a highly significant differentiation between choroidal melanomas and metastases.

In this study, we investigated the effects of BAY 87-2243, a small molecule that inhibits the first OXPHOS enzyme (complex I), in melanoma in vitro and in vivo.;BAY 87-2243 decreased mitochondrial oxygen consumption and induced partial depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential. This was associated with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, lowering of total cellular ATP levels, activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and reduced cell viability. The latter was rescued by the antioxidant vitamin E and high extracellular glucose levels (25 mM), indicating the involvement of ROS-induced cell death and a dependence on glycolysis for cell survival upon BAY 87-2243 treatment. BAY 87-2243 significantly reduced tumor growth in various BRAF mutant melanoma mouse xenografts and patient-derived melanoma mouse models. Furthermore, we provide evidence that inhibition of mutated BRAF using the specific small molecule inhibitor vemurafenib increased the OXPHOS dependency of BRAF mutant melanoma cells. As a consequence, the combination of both inhibitors augmented the anti-tumor effect of BAY 87-2243 in a BRAF mutant melanoma mouse xenograft model.;Taken together, our results suggest that complex I inhibition has potential clinical applications as a single agent in melanoma and also might be efficacious in combination with BRAF inhibitors in the treatment of patients with BRAF mutant melanoma.",

By screening the progeny of the injected animals, two strains stably expressing the NRAS transgene were identified: Tg(mitfa:EGFP:NRAS(Q61K))(1) and Tg(mitfa:EGFP:NRAS(Q61K))(2). Stable expression of this transgene results in hyperpigmented fish displaying a complete ablation of the normal pigment pattern. Although oncogenic NRAS expression alone was found to be insufficient to promote tumor formation, loss of functional p53 was found to collaborate with NRAS expression in the genesis of melanoma. The tumors derived from these animals are variably pigmented and closely resemble human melanoma. Underscoring the pathological similarities between these tumors and human disease and suggesting that common pathways are similar in these models and human disease, gene set enrichment analysis performed on microarray data found that the upregulated genes from zebrafish melanomas are highly enriched in human tumor samples.

With results reported as odds ratio (95% CI), the MITF p.E318K was associated with an increased melanoma risk (3.3 [1.43-7.43]; P < .01), especially in MPM (4.5 [1.83-11.01]; P < .01) and high nevi count (>200 nevi) (8.4 [2.14-33.19]; P < .01). Two fast-growing melanomas were detected among 2 MITF p.E318K carriers during dermatologic digital follow-up.;In addition to melanoma risk, MITF p.E318K is associated with a high nevi count and could play a role in fast-growing melanomas. Testing for MITF p.E318K should not exclude patients with known mutations in p16INK4A. Strict dermatologic surveillance, periodic self-examination, and renal cell carcinoma surveillance should be encouraged in this context.",

Primary uveal melanoma can be treated with a variety of therapies that may limit the growth of the primary tumor in the eye and partially preserve vision. However, none of these treatment modalities prevents the development of metastases, which predominantly arise in the liver and universally remain fatal. Novel therapies are being explored for their effectiveness against uveal melanoma metastases and immunotherapy may be a potential option as an alternative or adjunctive treatment, even in the prophylactic setting. Uveal melanoma may be particularly responsive to T-cell-based immunotherapy because it originates in the immune-privileged eye. The localization of the primary tumor in the immune-privileged eye excuses the tumor cells from continuous immunological pressure. This may render primary uveal melanoma more immunogenic than tumor cells from non-privileged sites and allow expression of novel tumor antigens to which the patient's endogenous T cell repertoire is not tolerized. The clinical and genetic differences between cutaneous and uveal melanomas underscore the need for immunotherapy specifically designed for uveal melanoma patients.

Genetic instability and mutations of putative melanoma susceptibility genes are key factors involved in increased melanoma risk. The identification of the responsible loci and genes by karyotyping and genetic linkage analysis of tumors, affected individuals, and their families will allow further insight into molecular mechanisms of melanoma development. One susceptibility gene is located on chromosome 9p21. Changes in adhesiveness and cell motility are important for tumor progression and may even represent prime factors determining aggressiveness and metastatic potential. In melanoma, several adhesion receptors of the integrin family (eg, alpha V beta 3, alpha 4 beta 1, alpha 2 beta 1) and the CD44 receptor are potentially relevant in this process. Several mechanisms appear to be involved in the escape of melanoma from immunologic control, 1) downregulation of surface-expressed major histocompatibility complex class I molecules and the failure of tumor cells to process endogenously synthesized proteins for antigen presentation, 2) inhibition of the interaction of cytotoxic T cells with melanoma cells, eg, by soluble adhesion molecules (intercellular adhesion molecule 1), and 3) induction and maintenance of clonal anergy in tumor cell-specific T cells.",

Although mtDNA mutations have been implicated in degenerating diseases, aging, and cancer, very little is known about the role of T cells in immunosurveillance for mtDNA aberrations. Here, we describe T-cell recognition of a peptide translated from an alternative open reading frame of the mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) gene in melanoma cells established from a patient. To understand how the cyt b gene is transcribed and translated in tumor cells, we found that cyt b-specific CD4(+) T cells only recognized protein fractions derived from cytoplasm and not from mitochondria. However, T-cell recognition of tumor cells could be inhibited by treatment of tumor cells with rhodamine 6G inhibitor, which depletes mitochondria. These findings suggest that cyt b mRNA is leaked out of the mitochondria and then translated in the cytoplasm for presentation to CD4(+) T cells. The cyt b cDNAs from this patient contain highly heteroplasmic transition mutations compared with control cell lines, suggesting a compromise of mitochondrial integrity that may have contributed to melanoma induction or progression. These findings provide the first example of a mitochondrial immune target for CD4(+) T cells and therefore have implications for the immunosurveillance of mitochondrial aberrations in cancer patients.",

We assessed BRAF V600E mutation by IHC in the CN of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in PCM patients and correlated the findings with demographic characteristics, PCM histopathologic and molecular features, and clinical outcome parameters. Seventy-eight cases of CN involving SLN of PCM patients were evaluated for BRAF V600E mutation by IHC. The results were correlated with patient demographics, PCM histopathologic and molecular features, and outcome measures. Thirty-six of 78 CN cases (46%) expressed BRAF V600E mutation by IHC. Nineteen of those BRAF-positive CN cases (53%) were from patients with ≥ AJCC stage II melanoma, whereas 62% of BRAF-negative CN cases (26/42) were from stage I melanoma patients (P=.013). Twelve of the 36 (33%) BRAF-positive CN cases had metastatic melanoma involving lymph nodes, compared to 14% (6/42) of BRAF-negative CN cases (P=.061). CN mutation status was not associated with patient demographics, histopathologic or molecular features of the PCM, or survival outcomes. A high percentage of CN identified in the SLN of patients with PCM harbor BRAF V600E mutation. Positive mutation was associated with adverse clinicopathologic parameters, specifically increased tumor stage and lymph node metastasis. These findings suggest that BRAF V600E mutation in CN of SLN may be useful as an adverse predictive biomarker in melanoma patients.",

In two-way comparisons, melanomas arising on skin with signs of chronic sun-induced damage and skin without such signs could be correctly classified with 84 percent accuracy. Acral melanoma could be distinguished from mucosal melanoma with 89 percent accuracy. Eighty-one percent of melanomas on skin without chronic sun-induced damage had mutations in BRAF or N-RAS; the majority of melanomas in the other groups had mutations in neither gene.

Despite the advent of new approved therapeutics, the 5-year overall survival rate of stage IV melanoma patients remains below 15%. Current treatments for late stage disease have shown higher efficacy when treated at a lower disease burden. Thus, blood-based biomarkers capable of detecting melanoma prior to clinically evident distant metastasis, will improve the treatment and outcomes for melanoma patients. To that end, effective treatment of melanoma necessitates identification of patients at risk for developing distant metastases. Furthermore, employing blood biomarkers that monitor cancer progression over the course of treatment is a promising solution to post-treatment drug resistance often developed in melanoma patients. Non-invasive blood biomarker assays allow for regular dynamic monitoring of disease. \"Liquid Biopsy\" of blood, which exploits circulating tumor cells (CTCs), cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and cell-free circulating microRNA (cmiRNA), has been shown to detect prognostic factors for relapse in AJCC stage III and stage IV melanoma patients. Moreover, molecular characterization of CTC and analysis of various forms of ctDNA present promising potential in development of individualized therapy for melanoma patients. New approaches such as massive parallel sequencing (MPS) provide a comprehensive view of the disease progression, allowing for the selection of therapeutic options for individual patients.

Germline mutations co-segregated with both CM and OM phenotypes and were associated with the presence of unique nevoid melanomas and highly atypical nevoid melanoma-like melanocytic proliferations (NEMMPs). Interestingly, 7/14 germline variants identified to date reside in C-terminus suggesting that the BRCA1 binding domain is important in cancer predisposition.;Germline BAP1 mutations are associated with a more aggressive OM phenotype and a recurrent phenotypic complex of cutaneous/ocular melanoma, atypical melanocytic proliferations and other internal neoplasms (ie. COMMON syndrome), which could be a useful clinical marker for constitutive BAP1 inactivation.",

To conclude, we propose that mutation screening of CDKN2A and CDK4 in Denmark should predominantly be performed in families with at least 3 cases of CM.

The CDKN2A locus consists of four exons and encodes several alternate transcripts, two of which are p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF), and originate from different open reading frames. Exon 1alpha is specific for p16(INK4a), while exon 1beta characterizes p14(ARF). Most CDKN2A mutations are located in exons 1alpha and 2, while exon 1beta variations have been identified in rare melanoma-prone pedigrees. In a previous study, we investigated 155 Italian melanoma cases, including 94 familial melanomas (FAMs) and 61 sporadic multiple primary melanomas (MPMs), for p16(INK4a)/CDK4 germline alterations and identified 15 p16(INK4a) and 1 CDK4 point mutations. In the present work, we extended our search to p14(ARF) mutations and CDKN2A deletions in the remaining samples. We identified the recurrent g.193+1G> A mutation in two FAM cases, while an additional pedigree displayed the previously undescribed variant g.161G> A. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) screening for copy variations resulted negative in all cases. In Italy, the overall frequency of p14(ARF) mutations is 3.2% in FAM and 0% in sporadic MPM. Re-evaluation of our patients' cohort emphasizes that the chance of identifying CDKN2A/CDK4 mutations in FAM is mainly influenced by the number of affected family members and the presence of one or more MPM cases. Accordingly, mutation rate rises to 61% in selected cases. Further studies are expected in order to investigate CDKN2A rarer mutations, including atypical deletions and inherited epimutations.",

Thus far, there is very limited data combining BRAF and NRAS mutation analysis to explore differences between cutaneous melanoma subtypes. The aim of this study was to address this issue.;The frequency of BRAF and NRAS hotspot mutations, in exons 15 and 2, respectively, was assessed in 59 cutaneous melanomas comprising superficial spreading, nodular, lentigo maligna, and ALM using single-strand conformational polymorphism and RFLP-PCR analysis.;Only 2 of 21 (9.5%) ALM showed BRAF exon 15 mutation compared with 9 of 14 (64.3%) superficial spreading malignant melanomas, 4 of 11 (36.4%) nodular melanomas, and 7 of 13 (53.4%) lentigo maligna melanomas (P < 0.01).

In particular, 9 of 19 (47.4%) ALM without BRAF exon 15 mutation had an NRAS exon 2 mutation.;We show that the overall BRAF/NRAS frequency in mutation hotspots is not significantly different among cutaneous melanoma subtypes.

The cohort included nonacral cutaneous (n = 774), acral (n = 111), mucosal (n = 26), uveal (n = 23), leptomeningeal (n = 1), and metastatic melanomas of unknown primary site (n = 177).

A total of 499 (44.9%) specimens exhibited BRAF mutations, involving exon 15 [497 (99.6%)] or exon 11 [2 (0.4%)]. p.V600E was detected in 376 (75.4%) cases; the remaining 123 (24.6%) cases exhibited non-p.V600E mutations, of which p.V600K was most frequent [86 (17.2%)].

We have recently shown that cytokine release by TIL is another indicator of the specific interaction with autologous tumor. To determine if recognition of shared melanoma Ag can also induce cytokine release, seven melanoma TIL, which lysed autologous tumor, were co-cultured with autologous tumor or with 7-12 HLA-matched or unmatched melanoma stimulators for 6-24 h. Supernatants were collected and assayed by ELISA for the presence of granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-4, and IL-6. Among five of six melanoma TIL for which autologous tumor was available, autologous melanoma cells stimulated specific release of at least one of three cytokines: GM-CSF, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha. Neither IL-4 nor IL-6 secretion by three TIL cultures tested was enhanced upon contact with tumor. For six of seven TIL cultures, HLA-matched allogeneic melanomas also stimulated significant cytokine release; HLA-A1, -A2, -A24, -B8, and -Cw7 were identified as possible restriction elements. The cytokine secretion induced by both autologous and allogeneic HLA-matched melanomas could be blocked by an anti-MHC I antibody.

The lesions were all observed proliferating in the dermis and demonstrated melanosomes and premelanosomes. High cellularity, nuclear atypia and transplantability of the tumors in outbred hamsters suggested a malignant nature. Some of the melanomas were morphologically heterogenous and contained Schwann-like cells as minor components. In addition, transplantation of the melanomas resulted in increased schwannian differentiation even for primary tumors which did not contain any Schwann-like cell foci. One of the transplanted melanomas mimicked malignant peripheral nervous tumor. Schwannian differentiation was also proved by the fact that glial fibrillary acidic protein was positive in 22.2% of the cases. The present results suggest that the induced hamster melanomas originate from neural crest-derived cells which are able to differentiate into both melanocytes and Schwann cells.",

Since BRAF mutations are frequent in melanoma, sorafenib was investigated in various Phase I, II and III clinical trials. The drug is well tolerated with mild to moderate adverse effects, which are mostly limited to cutaneous toxicity, diarrhea and fatigue.;Systematic literature review of the randomized trials using PubMed was performed. Original articles were reviewed and citations from those were also considered. Additionally, clinical trial databases were examined to identify and summarize ongoing trials of sorafenib in melanoma patients.;Sorafenib as a monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy is of limited use. Combining it with dacarbazine doubled the response rate and the progression-free survival in metastatic melanoma patients. Unfortunately, these results have never been evaluated in large randomized Phase III clinical trials. According to the trials conducted so far a subpopulation of patients experience substantial benefit, therefore it is essential to identify biomarkers to select the subgroups of patients that are more likely to respond to sorafenib.

Thus far, 2-amino-5-bromo-6-(3-fluorophenyl)-4(3H)pyrimidinone ( ABMFPP ) and its sister compound 2-amino-5-bromo-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-4(3H)pyrimidinone ( ABOFPP ) were found to be superior to other pyrimidinones including 2-amino-5-bromo-6-(6-phenyl)-4-pyrimidinone which is currently under clinical investigation. Neither ABMFPP nor ABOFPP alone had any significant activity against P388 leukemia. However, a marked synergistic effect was observed when a single i.p. injection of CY at 24 hr after tumor inoculation (10(6) cells/mouse) was followed by multiple i.p. injections of either ABMFPP or ABOFPP . For instance, the increase of life span was about 180% when animals received both CY (150 mg/kg) and ABMFPP (125 mg/kg/injection) as compared to 100% increased life span when animals received CY alone, and 0% increased life span when animals received ABMFPP alone. Also, 80% of the animals were long-term survivors (greater than 30 days) when animals received the combination therapy as compared to 20% survivors when animals received CY alone. The synergistic effect exhibited by ABMFPP or ABOFPP correlated positively to the initial reduction of tumor burden by CY. The optimal gap between CY and pyrimidinone administration was one day. The best therapeutic response was observed when pyrimidinone was given every 4 days for a total of 7 injections; however, other schedules and dosing frequencies also gave significant responses. The synergistic effect was also observed with B 16 melanoma when animals received the combination therapy.

The energy-sensing AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is known to be a major cellular target of biguanides. Based on our discovery of cross-talk between the AMPK and v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) signaling pathways, we investigated the antitumor effects of combining phenformin with a BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 on the proliferation of BRAF-mutated melanoma cells in vitro and on BRAF-driven tumor growth in vivo. Cotreatment of BRAF-mutated melanoma cell lines with phenformin and PLX4720 resulted in synergistic inhibition of cell viability, compared with the effects of the single agent alone. Moreover, treatment with phenformin significantly delayed the development of resistance to PLX4720 in cultured melanoma cells. Biochemical analyses showed that phenformin and PLX4720 exerted cooperative effects on inhibiting mTOR signaling and inducing apoptosis. Noticeably, phenformin selectively targeted subpopulations of cells expressing JARID1B, a marker for slow cycling melanoma cells, whereas PLX4720 selectively targeted JARID1B-negative cells. Finally, in contrast to their use as single agents, the combination of phenformin and PLX4720 induced tumor regression in both nude mice bearing melanoma xenografts and in a genetically engineered BRAF(V600E)/PTEN(null)-driven mouse model of melanoma. These results strongly suggest that significant therapeutic advantage may be achieved by combining AMPK activators such as phenformin with BRAF inhbitors for the treatment of melanoma. ",

Paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed melanoma biopsies were analyzed for the BRAF mutation status by independent, blinded observers using both conventional DNA molecular techniques and IHC with the novel BRAF V600E mutant-specific antibody, VE1. The antibody had a sensitivity of 97% (37/38) and a specificity of 98% (58/59) for detecting the presence of a BRAF V600E mutation.

Additional molecular analysis confirmed the immunohistochemically obtained BRAF result in 3 cases, suggesting that the initial molecular testing results were incorrect. Two of these patients would not have received a BRAF inhibitor on the basis of the initial false-negative mutation testing result. Two cases remained discordant. The reported IHC method is an accurate, rapid, and cost-effective method for detecting V600E BRAF mutations in melanoma patients.

To test the role of CDKN2 in human melanoma metastasis, 14 human melanoma cell lines with different metastatic abilities in nude mice were analysed for possible abnormalities in the CDKN2 gene. Homozygous deletions that resulted in a lack of gene expression were found in six of 14 cell lines tested. SSCP-direct sequencing revealed point mutations in three other cell lines. One cell line displayed CC to TT transitions which constitute a hallmark of ultraviolet-induced DNA damage. Overall, abnormalities in the CDKN2 gene were found in nine of 14 (64%) cell lines tested. Homozygous deletion and lack of gene expression were found in several low tumorigenic and nonmetastatic melanoma lines, whereas other metastatic cells did not exhibit abnormalities in the CDKN2 gene.

In general, conventional cytotoxic agents alone or in combination with immunologic drugs have limited clinical benefit. Advances in molecular analytic techniques have helped researchers discover genetic aberrations in KIT, a receptor tyrosine kinase, in nearly 40% of patients with mucosal melanoma. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that hot-spot mutations, mostly substitutions in exons 11 and 13, result in constitutive activation of KIT and its downstream signal transduction pathways, such as the MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT pathways. KIT inhibitors, most notably imatinib, have shown promising clinical activity in KIT-mutant advanced melanoma, including mucosal melanoma, with clinical response rates exceeding 35% in patients with hot-spot mutations in exon 11 or 13 and/or a high mutant/wild-type allelic ratio. However, the duration of disease control is rather short in general, and treatment with KIT inhibitors as single agents is not optimal. Well-designed mechanistic studies aimed at assessing molecular differences between various KIT mutations or other aberrations and mechanisms of resistance are urgently needed to improve KIT-targeting therapy for melanoma. In addition, with availability of checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-CTLA4 and/or anti-PD-1 antibodies, immunotherapies using those inhibitors alone or in combinations of such immunotherapies with KIT inhibitors may lead to more effective therapeutic regimens. This review discusses the rationale for KIT inhibitor therapy in patients with metastatic mucosal melanoma and the findings of preclinical and clinical studies of KIT inhibitors in this patient population.

While the generation of brisk T-cell infiltrates in early stage disease is correlated with prolonged survival, host reactions in most cases are insufficient to impede tumor progression. One variable that may limit the potency of the host response against nascent melanoma is the mixture of cytokines present in the tumor microenvironment. In a murine melanoma model, we identified granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as the most potent molecule for augmenting tumor immunity following gene transfer into melanoma cells. Vaccination with irradiated melanoma cells engineered to secrete GM-CSF enhances host responses through improved tumor antigen presentation by recruited dendritic cells and macrophages. Melanoma-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells, CD1d-restricted NKT-cells, and antibodies mediate tumor rejection.

The actual mode of inheritance of the melanoma has not been determined. Recently, we initiated experiments to characterize the swine major histocompatibility complex in melanoma- and nonmelanoma-bearing animals. These experiments led to the discovery of two loci that are involved in the expression of exophytic melanomas. The first locus lies within the swine major histocompatibility complex where one particular haplotype produces a phenotype in which the effects of a second locus are fully penetrant. The second locus segregates independently of the major histocompatibility complex. The melanoma-producing allele at this second locus is inherited in the heterozygous state and requires a somatic mutation of the normal allele to initiate tumor development.",

Two p53 gene mutations could be found in 1/63 samples examined, both having occurred in the same specimen from a patient with a nodular melanoma. p53 and mdm-2 expression were found immunohistochemically to increase with tumor progression both in frequency and in the mean proportion of positive cells, with the same cases staining positively for both antibodies. Our results suggest that a) p53 gene mutations are a rare event in human melanoma; b) accumulation and thus immunohistochemically detectable expression of p53 may result from posttranslational mechanisms affecting the p53 gene product; and c) p53 and mdm-2 are more important in late events in melanoma carcinogenesis.",

Melanoma is inherently associated with a high degree of resistance to apoptosis. Mutations in B-RAF are prevalent in melanoma and promote constitutive MEK-ERK1/2 signaling and cell transformation. Acquisition of B-RAF mutations correlates with vertical phase growth when melanoma cells invade into the dermis, a collagen-rich environment that also contains fibronectin matrix. In addition, alterations in phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI-3 kinase) signaling that lead to activation of AKT are detected in advanced melanomas. Here we show that knockdown of B-RAF expression by siRNA or pharmacological inhibition of MEK rendered melanoma cells susceptible to anoikis. Furthermore, adhesion to fibronectin but not collagen protected melanoma cells from anoikis through a PI-3 kinase-dependent pathway. Therefore, melanoma cells require either B-RAF or PI-3 kinase activation for protection from anoikis. Notably, AKT signaling in melanoma cells is substrate specific. These findings demonstrate that melanoma cells utilize multiple signaling pathways to provide resistance to apoptosis.",

Expression of miR-146a increases the ability of human melanoma cells to proliferate in culture and form tumors in mice, whereas knockdown of miR-146a has the opposite effects. We show these oncogenic activities are due to miR-146a targeting the NUMB mRNA, a repressor of Notch signaling. Previous studies have shown that pre-miR-146a contains a single nucleotide polymorphism (C>G rs2910164). We find that the ability of pre-miR-146a/G to activate Notch signaling and promote oncogenesis is substantially higher than that of pre-miR-146a/C.

Initial studies with a high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy have proved effective in patients with melanoma tumor, although a variety of systemic toxicities were observed. A low-dose IL-2 continuous infusion has shown a similar response in patients with melanoma tumor, but produced lesser toxicity. The low-dose IL-2 therapy has been studied with an adoptive transfer combined with either autologous lymphokine activated killer cells or autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). IL-2 in combination with chemotherapeutic agents such as flavone acetic acid, dacarbazine, and cyclophosphamide have also been studied in patients with metastatic melanoma. Results have shown a moderate response in patients with metastatic melanoma. TIL therapy, however, has been shown to result in higher objective regression due to potent tumor-specific killing and tumor-specific targeting characters of the TIL. The tumor targeting nature of the TIL creates the possibility of using TIL as a vehicle to deliver gene product specifically to tumor tissue.

This can be explained by the heterogeneous nature of cutaneous melanoma that expresses various levels of melanoma antigens, peptides and has various genetic profiles among different patients. From an immunological point of view, it is illogic to eliminate the tumor and its specific antigens then apply allogenic type of therapy and expect a tumor response. Therefore, it is more logical is to utilize the tumor site as a source for the tumor-specific antigens. In the meantime, patients with in-transit metastases can give us an excellent opportunity to evaluate the local and systemic effects of intralesional (intratumoral) therapy, and various agents have been utilized with equivocal results. On the other hand, intralesional administration of 2 cytokines seemed to process the tumor antigens and activates thymic-derived lymphocytes (T cells).

Here, using B16F0 melanoma cells stably expressing CCL21 under the control of cytomegalovirus and ubiquitin promoters, we showed that CCL21-activated immune responses depend on the amount of melanoma-derived chemokine, which, in turn, depends on the strength of the promoter. We showed that ubiquitin promoter-driven expression of CCL21 enabled massive infiltration of tumors with CD4(+)CD25(-), CD8(+) T lymphocytes, and CD11c(+) dendritic cells, and consequent activation of cellular and humoral immune responses sufficient for complete rejection of CCL21-positive melanomas within 3 weeks in all tumor-inoculated mice. Mice that rejected CCL21-positive tumors acquired protective immunity against melanoma, which was transferable to naive mice via splenocytes and central memory T cells. Moreover, melanoma-derived CCL21 facilitated immune-mediated remission of preestablished, distant wild-type melanomas. Overall, these results suggest that elevated levels of tumor-derived CCL21 are required for the activation of strong melanoma-specific immune responses and generation of protective immunologic memory.

Furthermore, Cx-43 promoter activity was significantly inhibited in PAR-1-silenced cells, suggesting that PAR-1 regulates Cx-43 at the transcriptional level. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies showed a reduction in the binding of SP-1 and AP-1 transcription factors to the promoter of Cx-43. Both transcription factors have been shown previously to be required for maximal Cx-43 promoter activity. These results were corroborated by mutating the AP-1 and SP-1 binding sites resulting in decreased Cx-43 promoter activity in PAR-1-positive cells. Moreover, as Cx-43 has been shown to facilitate arrest of circulating tumor cells at the vascular endothelium, melanoma cell attachment to endothelial cells was significantly decreased in PAR-1-silenced cells, with this effect being abrogated after PAR-1 rescue. Herein, we report that up-regulation of PAR-1 expression, seen in melanoma progression, mediates high levels of Cx-43 expression. As both SP-1 and AP-1 transcription factors act as positive regulators of Cx-43, our data provide a novel mechanism for the regulation of Cx-43 expression by PAR-1.

This study reveals an essential role of the Hippo-YAP pathway in Gq/11-induced tumorigenesis and suggests YAP as a potential drug target for UM patients carrying mutations in GNAQ or GNA11. ",

We have compared epidemiological and genetic evidences of the potential role of UV radiation in uveal melanoma with data on cutaneous melanoma. Even though frequently mutated genes in skin melanoma (e.g. BRAF) differ from those found in uveal melanoma (i.e. GNAQ, GNA11), their mutation pattern bears strong similarities. Furthermore, we provide new results showing that RAC1, a gene recently found harboring UV-hallmark mutation in skin melanoma, is also mutated in uveal melanoma.

BRAF is an element of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK (MAPK) pathway, which when constitutively active can lead to increased proliferation rate, enhanced survival, invasion and metastasis. The development of small molecule inhibitors of mutant BRAF kinase has changed the care of patients, especially with melanoma. Despite the success in treating melanoma with inhibitors of mutant BRAF and other elements of RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK (MAPK) pathway, resistance limits the long-term responsiveness to these drugs. The resistance mechanisms to MAPK pathway inhibition are complex, occur at genomic and phenotypic levels, and frequently the same patient can simultaneously develop diverse mechanisms of resistance in different progressive metastases or even in the same lesion. In the current review, we summarize recent research on mutations in BRAF and their importance for the development of tumor.

Thus there is an urgent need to identify new therapeutic targets and develop more potent pharmacological agents for melanoma treatment. Herein we report that SHP2 levels are frequently elevated in melanoma, and high SHP2 expression is significantly associated with more metastatic phenotype and poorer prognosis. We show that SHP2 promotes melanoma cell viability, motility, and anchorage-independent growth, through activation of both ERK1/2 and AKT signaling pathways. We demonstrate that SHP2 inhibitor 11a-1 effectively blocks SHP2-mediated ERK1/2 and AKT activation and attenuates melanoma cell viability, migration and colony formation. Most importantly, SHP2 inhibitor 11a-1 suppresses xenografted melanoma tumor growth, as a result of reduced tumor cell proliferation and enhanced tumor cell apoptosis.

It has been documented that genetic predisposition exists but exogenous factors are also very important. In familial melanomas it has been well established that mutation in the CDKN2A gene which is located at chromosome 9 leads to a marked risk for malignant melanoma. This tumor-suppressor gene is important for the regulation of the cell cycle and mutation in this gene is associated also with an increased rate of pancreas cancer. The penetrance of this mutation is influenced by UV-energy. In addition it has been shown that a second cluster for the familial atypical nevus syndrome is located at chromosome 1p36. Patients with the rare disease xeroderma pigmentosum have a defect in the DNA-repair mechanism inherited in an autosomal recessive trait and therefore develop within the first 20 years of life numerous malignant skin tumours including malignant melanomas. But also in non-syndromic patients a decrease of DNA-repair ability may occur. It has been shown recently that reduced DNA-repair ability is an independent risk factor for malignant melanoma and may contribute to susceptibility to sunlight-induced melanoma among the general population. Other constitutional risk factors for the development of malignant melanoma are fair skin, red hair and blue eyes. The most important exogenous risk factor is UV-exposition. Extensive and repetitive sunburns before the age of 15 years are especially predisposing to malignant melanoma. The most important preventive measures are continuous sun-protection including avoidance of sun in noon time on tropical and subtropical places, wearing a hut and sunglasses and application of sun-screens with high sun-protection factor. Furthermore a regular check for changing moles is indicated in persons with multiple atypical nevi or a familial melanoma syndrome. Nowadays molecular genetic screenings are available within research projects for members of melanoma-prone families. The controversy of such possibilities is discussed.",

The primary focus of development is in melanoma (> 50% harbor activating BRAF mutations) with other solid tumors, such as colorectal carcinoma (> 10% harbor BRAF mutations), also under investigation. Purified kinase assays have demonstrated that PLX-4032 and its related analogs are highly potent inhibitors of B-Raf activity, with 3-fold selectivity for the V600E mutation over the wild-type kinase. In preclinical models, PLX-4032 and its analogs inhibited the growth of BRAFV600E-positive melanoma cell lines both in vitro and in vivo. In phase I clinical trials, PLX-4032 was well tolerated and objective responses were observed in several patients with BRAFV600E-positive tumors. Responses correlated well with inhibition of intratumoral phospho-ERK and cell proliferation, and reductions in fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on PET scanning. A preliminary analysis of this phase I data suggested that progression-free survival was approximately 7 months, and phase II and III clinical trials are now underway. These studies provide the proof-of-concept for B-Raf as a therapeutic target in melanoma.",

This immune response apparently can be augmented by nonspecific immunologic stimulates such as BCG. These agents are effective for destroying tumor when injected locally into intracutaneous disease but are not as effective for subcutaneous disease. Preliminary clinical trials indicated that immune stimulants are effective when administered systemically. The effect is only minimal for diseminated disease, but the therapeutic benefit is clearly augmented for patients with a minimal residual tumor burden, such as those patients with metastases to regional lymph nodes. Thus immunotherapy is a systemically active mode of therapy. Its toxicity is minimal, and it appears to be effective in a wide spectrum of the disease. However, immunotherapy is not effective for a large residual tumor burden; consequently it must be used in combination with other modes of treatment such as irradiation therapy or chemotherapy. Early experiences with BCG immunotherapy for malignant melanoma and C. parvum for oat cell carcinoma are encouraging. It is remarkable that a nonspecific immunologic stimulant does, in fact, have this effect. Immunotherapy experiments in animals suggest that in order to achieve maximal benefit. BCG must have close contact with tumor cells or must be combined with a tumor-associated antigen. If these principles are true for man, it would seem that improvements for nonspecific immunotherapy in human neoplasms would be further augmented if a tumor-related antigen could be extracted from human tumours and combined with a nonspecific immunologic stimulant.",

The CXCR4-SDF-1α axis has been postulated to increase melanoma invasiveness. We discovered that SDF-1α specifically upregulates E-selectin on endothelial cells, thus tethering circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) and facilitating homing. We investigated the hypothesis that small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA)-mediated E-selectin blockade inhibits melanoma angiogenesis and tumor growth.;Human melanoma cells overexpressing SDF-1α were xenografted on severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. SDF-1α expression in cells was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In vitro melanoma cell growth was examined by cell proliferation assay. In vivo vascular E-selectin knockdown was achieved by administration of high-volume E-selectin siRNA (100 pmol/180 μL/week × 3 times) and inhibition was validated by immunostaining (N = 6/group, E-Selectin siRNA vs control siRNA). Tumor angiogenesis was quantified (DiI-perfusion and LASER confocal microscopy). EPC homing to tumor vasculature was detected by immunostaining. Explanted in vivo tumor size and weight were measured.;Three melanoma cells tested expressed undetectable levels of SDF-1α. Additional enforced overexpression of SDF-1α (by Lenti-SDF-1α) increased melanoma cell growth both in vitro and in vivo, enhanced EPC homing to tumor tissue, and increased tumor angiogenesis. Knocking-down vascular E-selectin significantly inhibited SDF-1α-induced EPC homing, tumor angiogenesis, and decreased melanoma growth in vivo.;Downregulation of vascular E-selectin profoundly inhibits EPC homing, tumor angiogenesis, and tumor growth in human melanoma xenograft murine model, potentially by suppression of E-selectin-mediated EPC-endothelial cells interactions/homing. These findings identify E-selectin as a novel target for inhibition of melanoma angiogenesis and tumor growth.",

Staging of malignant melanoma is determined according to the level of invasion (Clark level) and vertical thickness (Breslow scale). Besides operative therapy, which is the only effective treatment for malignant melanoma, postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and biologic therapy also are of great importance. In recent years, immunologic strategies including tumor vaccine and adjuvant therapy with interferon-alfa have been attempted to improve survival of patients with more advanced malignant melanoma. A recent melanoma research has focused on target therapy such as immunotherapy (vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, dendritic cells) and gene therapy. Genetic immunization has become an attractive strategy for the development of melanoma vaccines, because a number of antigens recognized by cellular components of the immune system have been identified at the molecular level. Numerous chemotherapeutic agents have shown activity in the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma, such as dacarbazine (dimethyl triazene imidazole carboxamide); other agents have been used, however, with less success. However, a very modest effect was recorded in advanced malignant melanoma. There are many experimental trials using combined therapy for malignant melanoma, including chemotherapy (dimethyl triazene imidazole carboxamide) and biologic therapy (interleukin (IL)-2, interferon (IFN)-gamma, IFN-alfa). The results obtained open particularly interesting prospects in the field of malignant melanoma with high relevance for its development and progression.

Studies revealed mutually exclusive NRAS and BRAF activating mutations driving the MAPK/ERK pathway among human melanomas. Although combination therapy exerts significantly better antitumor cell efficacy, complete remission is rarely achieved. To employ an alternative approach, we have targeted the Hedgehog/GLI pathway, which is deregulated in melanomas, through the GLI1/2 inhibitor GANT61, alone or accompanied with the treatment by the BCL2 family inhibitor obatoclax in 9 melanoma cell lines. Thus, we targeted melanoma cells irrespective of their NRAS or BRAF mutational status. After GANT61 treatment, the cell viability was drastically diminished via apoptosis, as substantial nuclear DNA fragmentation was detected. In all tested melanoma cell lines, the combined treatment was more efficient than the application of each drug alone at the end of the cell growth with inhibitors. GANT61 was efficient also alone in most cell lines without the addition of obatoclax, which had only a limited effect when used as a single drug. In most cell lines, tumor cells were eradicated after 5-9 days of combined treatment in colony outgrowth assay. To conclude, GANT61 treatment might become a hopeful and effective anti-melanoma targeted therapy, especially when combined with the BCL2 family inhibitor obatoclax. ",

Conversely, melanoma-specific PD-1 overexpression enhances tumorigenicity, as does engagement of melanoma-PD-1 by its ligand, PD-L1, whereas melanoma-PD-L1 inhibition or knockout of host-PD-L1 attenuate growth of PD-1-positive melanomas. Mechanistically, the melanoma-PD-1 receptor modulates downstream effectors of mTOR signaling.

In vivo, 1a displayed antitumor activity in B16F0 melanoma primary cancer model, manifested by a significant increase in the life span of the treated animals. Murine lung tumor burden, induced by injection of the highly metastatic melanoma cells (B16F10.9), was decreased by 1a. It also displayed a significant therapeutic activity against spontaneous metastases which were induced by 3LL Lewis lung carcinoma cells.

Although the first English-language report of melanoma in 1820 contained a description of a melanoma-prone family, seminal studies by investigators at the National Cancer Institute and the University of Pennsylvania identified dysplastic nevi (DN) as an important melanoma precursor, suggested an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance for both melanoma and DN, and proposed that a melanoma-susceptibility gene (CMM1) was located on chromosome 1p36. This gene assignment has not yet been confirmed by independent investigators. A second melanoma gene, designated CMM2, has been mapped to chromosome 9p21. This gene assignment has been confirmed independently, and the cell cycle regulator p16INK4a has been proposed as a candidate gene; germline mutations in this gene have been identified in about half of melanoma-prone families. Germline mutations in the cyclin-dependent kinase gene CDK4 (chromosome 12q14) have recently been described in two melanoma kindreds; this finding likely represents a third melanoma gene. A heritable determinant for total nevus number has been suggested, as has the presence of a major gene responsible for total nevus density in melanoma-prone families. An autosomal dominant mode of inheritance for DN has been proposed, and evidence suggests that DN may be a pleiotropic manifestation of the 1p36 familial melanoma gene. Several studies have shown a surprisingly high prevalence of DN on the skin of family members of probands with DN. In light of the extensive evidence documenting that persons with DN (both sporadic and familial) have an increased prospective risk for melanoma, these family studies suggest that relatives of persons with DN should be examined for DN and for melanoma. Overall, genetic determinants have a major role in the pathogenesis of normal nevi, DN, and melanoma. Elucidating the molecular basis of these genetic events promises to enhance melanoma risk reduction strategies and thereby reduce melanoma-associated mortality.",

We found that TAA loss from human melanomas usually results from reversible gene down-regulation, rather than gene deletion or mutation. Previously, we showed that inhibitors of MAPK-signaling pathways up-regulate TAA expression in melanoma cell lines. We have now identified IFN-beta as an additional stimulus to TAA expression, including Melan-A/MART-1, gp100, and MAGE-A1. IFN-beta (but neither IFN-alpha nor IFN-gamma) augmented both protein and mRNA expression of melanocytic TAA in 15 melanoma lines (irrespective of initial Ag-expression levels). Treatment of low Ag melanoma lines with IFN-beta increased expression of melanocyte-lineage Ags, inducing susceptibility to lysis by specific CTLs. Treatment with IFN-beta also enhances expression of class I HLA molecules, thereby inducing both nominal TAA and the presenting HLA molecule. Data from fluorescent cellular reporter systems demonstrated that IFN-beta triggers promoter activation, resulting in augmentation of Ag expression. In addition to enhancing TAA expression in melanomas, IFN-beta also stimulated expression of the melanocytic Ag gp100 in cells of other neural crest-derived tumor lines (gliomas) and certain unrelated tumors. Because IFN-beta is already approved for human clinical use in other contexts, it may prove useful as a cotreatment for augmenting tumor Ag expression during immunotherapy.",

However, the majority of somatic variants lie outside coding regions and their role in cancer progression remains to be determined. In order to establish a system to test the functional importance of non-coding somatic variants in cancer, we created a low-passage cell culture of a metastatic melanoma tumor sample. As a foundation for interpreting functional assays, we performed whole-genome sequencing and analysis of this cell culture, the metastatic tumor from which it was derived, and the patient-matched normal genomes. When comparing somatic mutations identified in the cell culture and tissue genomes, we observe concordance at the majority of single nucleotide variants, whereas copy number changes are more variable. To understand the functional impact of non-coding somatic variation, we leveraged functional data generated by the ENCODE Project Consortium. We analyzed regulatory regions derived from multiple different cell types and found that melanocyte-specific regions are among the most depleted for somatic mutation accumulation. Significant depletion in other cell types suggests the metastatic melanoma cells de-differentiated to a more basal regulatory state. Experimental identification of genome-wide regulatory sites in two different melanoma samples supports this observation. Together, these results show that mutation accumulation in metastatic melanoma is nonrandom across the genome and that a de-differentiated regulatory architecture is common among different samples. Our findings enable identification of the underlying genetic components of melanoma and define the differences between a tissue-derived tumor sample and the cell culture created from it.

Patients with metastatic melanoma have a 10-year survival rate of less than 10%. While the clinical landscape for melanoma is evolving rapidly, lack of response to therapies, as well as resistance to therapy remain critical obstacles for treatment of this disease. In recent years, a myriad of therapy resistance mechanisms have been unravelled, one of which is autophagy, the focus of this review. In advanced stages of malignancy, melanoma cells hijack the autophagy machinery in order to alleviate drug-induced and metabolic stress in the tumor microenvironment, thereby promoting resistance to multiple therapies, tumor cell survival, and progression.  Autophagy is an essential cellular process that maintains cellular homeostasis through the recycling of intracellular constituents. Early studies on the role of autophagy in cancer generated controversy as to whether autophagy was pro- or anti-tumorigenic. Currently, there is a consensus that autophagy is tumor-suppressive in the early stages of cancer and tumor-promoting in established tumors.  This review aims to highlight current understandings on the role of autophagy in melanoma malignancy, and specifically therapy resistance; as well as to evaluate recent strategies for therapeutic autophagy modulation.

Seventeen of these patients developed melanoma metastases within a follow-up period of 60 mo; 15 patients who did not developed metastases and were comparable with regard to clinical and histological criteria were selected as a comparison group.

This technique has been employed successfully in the prognostic assessment of stage I and II melanomas and was recently proven to be a sensitive marker for thin, high-risk melanomas. In our patients, Vv was determined by computer-assisted image analysis on Feulgen-stained sections by stereologic estimation of the Vv. The mean Vv (+/-SD) of primary melanomas with subsequent metastatic course was 794.99 +/- 209.18 micron3 (range: 409.48-1161.9 micron3), whereas primary melanoma lesions without subsequent metastases exhibited a mean Vv 640.54 +/- 205.07 micron3 (range: 206.7-927.48 micron3).

The serine/threonine kinase B-RAF is mutated in 50% to 70% of melanomas and protects melanoma cells from anoikis, a form of apoptosis induced by lack of adhesion or adhesion to an inappropriate matrix. Mutant B-RAF down-regulates two BH3-only proapoptotic proteins, Bim(EL) and Bad. BH3-only proteins act, at least in part, by sequestering prosurvival Bcl-2 family proteins and preventing them from inhibiting the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Several Bcl-2 proteins are up-regulated in melanoma; however, the mechanisms of up-regulation and their role in melanoma resistance to anoikis remain unclear. Using RNA interference, we show that depletion of Mcl-1 renders mutant B-RAF melanoma cells sensitive to anoikis. By contrast, minor effects were observed following depletion of either Bcl-2 or Bcl-(XL). Mcl-1 expression is enhanced in melanoma cell lines compared with melanocytes and up-regulated by the B-RAF-MEK-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathway through control of Mcl-1 protein turnover. Similar to B-RAF knockdown cells, adhesion to fibronectin protected Mcl-1 knockdown cells from apoptosis. Finally, expression of Bad, which does not sequester Mcl-1, further augmented apoptosis in nonadherent Mcl-1 knockdown cells. Together, these data support the notion that BH3 mimetic compounds that target Mcl-1 may be effective for the treatment of melanoma in combinatorial strategies with agents that disrupt fibronectin-integrin signaling.",

The exact role of the two proteins encoded by this complex locus in this predisposition is unclear. Most mutations affect either CDKN2A only or products of both genes. Recently a deletion affecting ARF-specific exon 1beta was reported in a family with melanoma and neural tumours. However, the possibility of this deletion also altering the CDKN2A transcript could not be excluded. More convincingly, a 16 base pair insertion in exon 1beta has been reported in an individual with multiple melanomas suggesting a direct role for ARF in melanoma predisposition. We report here a splice mutation in exon 1beta in a family with melanoma that results in ARF haploinsufficiency. The mutation was observed in a mother and daughter with melanoma. A sibling of the mother with breast cancer also had this mutation. Analysis of the melanoma from one individual revealed a 62 bp deletion in exon 3 of the wildtype allele and loss of the mutant allele; these somatic changes would affect both CDKN2A and ARF. These somatic events suggest that concomitant inactivation of both ARF and CDKN2A may be necessary for melanoma development and that mutations in ARF and CDKN2A possibly confer different levels of susceptibility to melanoma, with the former associated with lesser predisposition. In this situation, the events follow a 'three-hit' model as observed in tumours from FAP patients with an attenuated phenotype. Overall, the data suggest a direct role for ARF haploinsufficiency in melanoma predisposition and co-operation between ARF and CDKN2A in tumour formation, consistent with recent observations in Cdkn2a-specific knockout mice.",

Tumor cases were then classified with respect to the presence or absence of these imbalances and statistically analyzed in order to assess the order of appearance of chromosomal imbalances, the presence of karyotypic pathways, as well as possible cytogenetic subtypes. We show that the melanomas develop through one mode of karyotypic evolution, common to both low and high complexity karyotypes, and we establish the temporal order by which the different imbalances occur.

IHC using antibody, VE1, to BRAF V600E was also performed on a subset of 41 tumors to assess the relationship of BRAF mutation to immune markers.;We found, using Cox regression models, that the presence of TILs was associated with improved OS (p = 0.034) and RFS (p = 0.002) in ulcerated melanoma tumors, but not in non-ulcerated melanoma (p = 0.632, 0.416). CD2 expression also was correlated with improved OS (p = 0.021) and RFS (p = 0.001) in ulcerated melanoma, but no relationship was seen in non-ulcerated melanoma (p = 0.427, 0.682). In this small population, BRAF status did not correlate with TILs or CD2+ count.;Our data show that immune markers including TILs and CD2 count correlate more closely with survival in ulcerated melanomas than that in non-ulcerated melanomas. We propose that immune biomarkers may be particularly relevant to ulcerated, as compared to non-ulcerated, melanomas and that this merits study in larger populations.",

Autologous and allogeneic melanoma lysis was inhibited by anti-CD3, by anti-MHC class I, and by anti-HLA-A2 mAb, indicating recognition of shared tumor Ag among melanoma cell lines in a TCR-dependent, HLA-A2-restricted manner. Six HLA-A2-negative melanoma cell lines obtained from five HLA-A2-negative patients were co-transfected with the HLA-A2.1 gene and pSV2neo. All 17 cloned transfectants expressing cell surface HLA-A2 molecules, but none of 12 transfectants lacking HLA-A2 expression, were lysed by these three HLA-A2-restricted, melanoma-specific CTL.

The most frequent genetic alteration during metastatic progression detected was the loss of p16INK4a protein expression (four of 14 cases), whereas no somatic p16INK4a gene mutations were found in any primary or metastatic tumors. LOH analyses showed that most of the chromosome losses including 6q, 8p, 9p, 9q, and 18q were shared between primary tumors and their metastases. Nevertheless, LOH of 6q and 11q and LOH of 7q not detected in primary tumors were, respectively, observed in two lymph node metastases. These results suggest that loss of p16INK4a protein expression (but not p16INK4a gene mutation) and the losses of chromosome arms 6q, 7q, and 11q play an important role in the acquisition of metastatic potential in sporadic melanoma. Furthermore, comparison of genetic profiles between the primary tumor and its metastasis revealed in several cases that heterogenous tumor cell populations might already exist at the early stage of tumorigenesis and evolve independently in the primary tumor and its metastasis, strongly suggesting that metastatic progression of sporadic melanoma is not accounted for by a linear progression model.",

Sequential absorption with AB Rh+ and pooled platelets of more than 200 donors either reduced the titer of sera or rendered a great part of the sera negative, demonstrating that antibodies against HL-A antigens and other tissue antigens were involved. The remaining positive sera were further absorbed with pooled cells from 6- to 8-week-old fetuses.

Previously we reported that adenylate cyclase-associated protein 2 (CAP2), which is a well-conserved actin regulator, was overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma; however, CAP2 expression in other clinical cancers remains unclear. The aim of the current study was to clarify the clinicopathological significance of CAP2 overexpression in malignant melanoma. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that many melanoma cells exhibited diffuse cytoplasmic expression of CAP2, whereas no normal melanocytes showed detectable immunostaining for CAP2. A high level of CAP2 expression was seen in 14 of 50 melanomas and was significantly correlated with greater tumor thickness and nodular melanoma subtypes. In addition, a high level of CAP2 expression was associated with poor overall survival in univariate and multivariate analyses. For 13 patients, samples of primary and metastatic melanoma tissue were available: four patients exhibited higher levels of CAP2 expression in metastatic tumor compared to the primary site, whereas no patient showed lower levels of CAP2 expression in metastatic melanomas. Our findings show that CAP2 overexpression is a novel prognostic marker in malignant melanoma and that CAP2 expression seems to increase stepwise during tumor progression, suggesting the involvement of CAP2 in the aggressive behavior of malignant melanoma.

We sought to determine the association of increased copy numbers of GAB2 among melanoma subtypes in the context of genetic alterations in BRAF, NRAS, and KIT.;A total of 85 melanomas arising from sun-protected (n = 23) and sun-exposed sites (n = 62) were analyzed for copy number changes using array-based comparative genomic hybridization and for gain-of-function mutations in BRAF, NRAS, and KIT.;GAB2 amplifications were found in 9% of the cases and were associated with melanomas arising from acral and mucosal sites (P = 0.005). Increased copy numbers of the KIT locus were observed in 6% of the cases. The overall mutation frequencies for BRAF and NRAS were 43.5% and 14%, respectively, and were mutually exclusive. Among the acral and mucosal melanomas studied, the genetic alteration frequency was 26% for GAB2, 13% for KIT, 30% for BRAF, and 4% for NRAS.

In all, 41 melanoma obtained from eight primary lesions, 20 nodal, 11 cutaneous and two visceral metastases from patients with sporadic (n=31), familial (n=4) and multiple melanoma (n=2) were analysed. The results revealed novel missense mutations in the BRAF, PTEN, CDKN2A and CDK4 genes. Overall, activating mutations of BRAF and loss of functional p16 and ARF were detected in the majority of melanomas (29/41, 36/41 and 29/41, respectively), while PTEN alterations/loss, NRAS and TP53 mutations occurred less frequently (6/41, 6/41 and 10/41, respectively). In the resulting 12 mutational profiles, p16/ARF loss associated with mutated BRAFV599E was the most represented (n=15). In addition, TP53 and PTEN mutations were always accompanied with BRAF alterations, while PTEN loss was found in association with CDKN2A or TP53 mutations in the absence of BRAF activation. The p16/ARFDelta+BRAF/RAS profile was significantly associated with a longer survival, while complex mutational profiles were detected in highly aggressive disease and poor survival. These data support the existence of several molecularly defined melanoma groups which likely reflect different clinical/biological behaviour, thus suggesting that a more extensive molecular classification of melanoma would significantly impact its clinical management.",

Inadequate homing of infused NK cells to the tumor site represents a key factor that may explain the poor anti-tumor effect of NK cell therapy against solid tumors. One of the major players in the regulation of lymphocyte chemotaxis is the chemokine receptor chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 3 (CXCR3) which is expressed on activated NK cells and induces NK cell migration toward gradients of the chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL9, 10 and 11). Here, we show that ex vivo expansion of human NK cells results in a tenfold increased expression of the CXCR3 receptor compared with resting NK cells (p = 0.04). Consequently, these NK cells displayed an improved migratory capacity toward solid tumors, which was dependent on tumor-derived CXCL10. In xenograft models, adoptively transferred NK cells showed increased migration toward CXCL10-transfected melanoma tumors compared with CXCL10-negative wild-type tumors, resulting in significantly reduced tumor burden and increased survival (median survival 41 vs. 32 days, p = 0.03). Furthermore, administration of interferon-gamma locally in the tumor stimulated the production of CXCL10 in subcutaneous melanoma tumors resulting in increased infiltration of adoptively transferred CXCR3-positive expanded NK cells. Our findings demonstrate the importance of CXCL10-induced chemoattraction in the anti-tumor response of adoptively transferred expanded NK cells against solid melanoma tumors.",

The occurrence of bilateral uveal melanoma is an extremely rare event, but the observed frequency is nevertheless higher than what can be attributed to chance. Possible responsible factors may include a genetic predisposition.;This retrospective study investigated the charts of patients examined from July 1988 to July 2001. For each patient, the clinical characteristics of the tumor (diameter, thickness, location), treatments, and results were noted, as were the eye involved, the presence of ocular melanocytosis, cutaneous melanoma, and second primary cancers. The information was then subjected to statistical analysis.;Of 2 461 patients with unilateral primary uveal melanoma, five were identified as having bilateral uveal melanoma (0.2%). The expected number of cases would be less than one, hypothesizing an incidence of second melanoma identical to the incidence of a primary melanoma in the general population. The interval between the diagnosis of first and second primary uveal melanomas ranged from 0 to 6 years (median, 2 years). There was no clinical evidence of ocular melanocytosis in any of the five patients. The uveal melanoma was choroidal in three patients and affected the ciliary body or iris and choroid in two patients.;The discrepancy between the estimated incidence (thought by Shammas to be one case every 18 years) and the observed incidence of bilateral primary uveal melanoma could be the result of many possible factors. An increased incidence of unilateral uveal melanoma could be a cause but in fact the incidence of uveal melanoma seems stable. Uveal melanoma may have been misdiagnosed in earlier years. The presence of a genetic predisposition to uveal melanoma is a possible explanation (suspected because of bilateral cases, familial cases and association with other primary malignancies). Ocular melanocytosis, which is described as more common in patients with bilateral uveal melanoma, was not seen in our series.;Bilateral primary uveal melanoma occurs more frequently than expected.

One such target is the V600E \"gain-of-function\" BRAF mutation found in 60% of melanomas; other mutations or molecular alterations cooperate with V600E BRAF, particularly those that cause loss of function of PTEN, upstream of Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin.

In this report we present a nasal mucosal malignant melanoma case with its histopathological and clinical features. Case Report: An 88-year-old female patient presented with epistaxis a month ago. Examination revealed a polypoid mass lesion of right nasal cavity originating from the middle concha. Her medical history revealed that she had been found to have a mass lesion in the right nasal cavity 15 months ago. She then underwent a punch biopsy from that lesion. A definitive histopathological diagnosis was not made but it was declared that the lesion had been a malignant epithelial tumor. The patient then had radiotherapy and the lesion showed complete regression. One year after completion of radiotherapy, the lesion recurred. Her last PET-CT showed multiple metastatic foci. Endoscopic excisional biopsy was performed for her recurrent lesion. Fragmented tumoral tissues were measured as 3,6x3x0,5 cm. Macroscopically the tumor was brownish in color. Histopathologically the tumor consisted of spindled and epitheloid cells. Immunohistochemically the tumor cells displayed positivity for S-100, HMB-45 and Melan-A. Findings were consistent with malignant melanoma. Discussion: Mucosal malignant melanomas have a poor prognosis despite chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Five-year survival for sinonasal melanoma is reported to be lower than 35%. Sinonasal melanomas show a high recurrence rate. The immunohistochemical markers showing high specificity for malignant melanoma such as S-100, HMB-45 and Melan-A are used in order to reach a correct diagnosis. In our case the tumor showed recurrence and multiple metastases 1 year after completion of radiotherapy. For this recurrent tumor, chemotherapy and radiotherapy have been planned.",

Experimentally, we generated a strain of mice doubly deficient in Xpc and Ink4a-Arf and subjected wild-type, Xpc-/-Ink4a-Arf+/+, Xpc-/-Ink4a-Arf-/-, and Xpc+/+Ink4a-Arf-/- mice to a single neonatal (day P3) dose of UVB without additional chemical promotion. Indeed, there was a significant increase in the development of dermal spindle/epithelioid cell melanomas in Xpc-/-Ink4a-Arf-/- mice when compared with Xpc+/+Ink4a-Arf-/- mice (P = 0.005); wild-type and Xpc-/-Ink4a-Arf+/+ mice failed to develop tumors. These neoplasms bore a striking histologic resemblance to melanomas that arise in the Tyr-vHRAS/Ink4a-Arf-/- context and often expressed melanocyte differentiation marker Tyrp1, thus supporting their melanocytic origination. All strains, except wild-type mice, developed pigmented and non-pigmented epidermal-derived keratinocytic cysts, whereas Xpc+/+Ink4a-Arf-/- mice exhibited the greatest propensity for squamous cell carcinoma development. We then screened for NRas, HRas, Kras, and BRaf mutations in tumor tissue and detected a higher frequency of rare Kras(Q61) alterations in tumors from Xpc-/-Ink4a-Arf-/- mice compared with Xpc+/+Ink4a-Arf-/- mice (50% versus 7%, P = 0.033). Taken together, results from this novel UV-inducible melanoma model suggest that NER loss, in conjunction with Ink4a-Arf inactivation, can drive melanoma photocarcinogenesis possibly through signature Kras mutagenesis.",

In a series of 103 consecutive cases of melanomas of the nodular, superficial spreading, and lentigo maligna types, there were 86 determinate cases with a five-year cure rate of 50%.

Loss of expression of the p16INK4 tumor suppressor protein, the product of the CDKN2 gene, has been associated with a wide variety of human malignancies. Mutations, loss of heterozygosity and deletions of the CDKN2 locus have been reported in sporadic and familial cutaneous malignant melanomas (CMM). To investigate the role of the alterations of p16 expression in melanoma, we evaluated by immunohistochemistry the p16 expression and cell proliferation in 79 primary CMM and 10 benign melanocytic nevi (BMN). Forty-six melanomas (58%) and all BMN were found to be p16 positive; 33 melanomas (42%) were considered p16 negative. The extent of invasion according to Clark was significantly higher in p16-negative tumors than in p16-positive tumors. Cell proliferation as expressed by the proportion of positive cells in Ki-67 immunostaining was found to be significantly higher in p16-negative tumors than in p16-positive tumors, although there was no significant difference in the mitotic index between p16-positive and p16-negative tumors. In p16-positive tumors, the number of Ki-67-positive cells correlated with the mitotic index; in p16-negative tumors, there was no correlation between these parameters. Our data suggest that loss of p16 expression is more common in advanced melanomas, and that G1/S checkpoint regulation is disrupted in p16-negative melanomas. Our results show that loss of p16 expression is a common event in primary melanomas, which further substantiates the role of p16 as a major tumor suppressor.",

Such combination therapy may be most useful when \"metronomic\" doses of antineoplastic drugs are used, thereby potentially avoiding some of the immunosuppressive effects of these drugs. Recent studies have shown that some conventional antineoplastic drugs can be exploited for antiangiogenic capacities, a strategy that requires drugs to be administered at regular intervals. We therefore investigated whether such metronomic therapy with the alkylating agent cyclophosphamide (CTX) could be effectively combined with immunotherapy eliciting tumor-reactive CTLs. An immunization protocol using injection of recombinant DNA followed by injection of recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara strain was used to initiate a specific CTL response in mice capable of providing resistance to challenge with the murine melanoma B16.F10. Combining this immunotherapeutic regime with metronomic delivery of CTX resulted in antitumor activity that was dramatically enhanced over either treatment administered alone and was also significantly greater than combining immunotherapy with CTX administered by a maximum tolerated dose regime. Whereas both metronomic and maximum tolerated dose delivery of CTX did cause deletion of proliferating tumor-specific CTLs in the blood, this deletion occurred with slower kinetics with the metronomic schedule. Further analysis showed that metronomic CTX treatment did not delete cells with low expression of CD43, a \"memory\" phenotype, and that these cells maintained potent restimulatory capacity. The combination of immunotherapy and metronomic CTX therapy may be well suited to clinical management of cancer.",

Injected LEC were tracked by intravital fluorescence microscopy, and melanoma growth by bioluminescence.;Over-expression of the chemokine receptor CCR7 enables non-metastatic tumor cells to recognise and grow towards LECs (3.9 fold compared with control), but not blood endothelial cells (0.9 fold), in vitro and in vivo in the absence of increased lymphatic clearance. Chemotactic metastasis was inhibited by a CCL21 neutralising antibody (4-17% of control).

The methylation state of individual CpG dinucleotides was investigated in genomic DNA derived from control tissues and melanomas within the CDKN2X 5' CpG island. The studied genomic area was found to be virtually unmethylated in all tested tissues including melanomas. In addition, RNA expression studies of the fish CDKN2X locus revealed that it is significantly overexpressed in melanoma, in contrast to what has been reported for the human CDKN2A locus in melanoma.

Within a short genomic distance, this locus encodes several proteins with established tumor-suppressor roles in a broad spectrum of cancer types. Several lines of evidence support the view that p16INK4a and p19ARF exert the tumor-suppressor activities of this locus, although their relative importance in specific cancer types such as melanoma has been less rigorously documented on the genetic level. Here, we exploit a well-defined mouse model of RAS-induced melanomas to examine the impact of germline p16INK4a or p19ARF nullizygosity on melanoma formation. We demonstrate that loss of either Ink4a/Arf product can cooperate with RAS activation to produce clinically indistinguishable melanomas. In line with the common phenotypic end point, we further show that RAS+ p16INK4a-/- melanomas sustain somatic inactivation of p19ARF-p53 and, correspondingly, that RAS+ p19ARF-/- melanomas experience high-frequency loss of p16INK4a. These genetic studies provide definitive proof that p16INK4a and p19ARF cooperate to suppress the development of melanoma in vivo.",

An innovative treatment approach for this disease is represented by targeting acidosis, a feature characterizing tumor microenvironment and playing an important role in cancer malignancy. Proton pump inhibitors (PPI), such as esomeprazole (ESOM) are prodrugs functionally activated by acidic environment, fostering pH neutralization by inhibiting proton extrusion. We used human melanoma cell lines and xeno-transplated SCID mice to provide preclinical evidence of ESOM antineoplastic activity. Human melanoma cell lines, characterized by different mutation and signaling profiles, were treated with ESOM in different pH conditions and evaluated for proliferation, viability and cell death. SCID mice engrafted with human melanoma were used to study ESOM administration effects on tumor growth and tumor pH by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). ESOM inhibited proliferation of melanoma cells in vitro and induced a cytotoxicity strongly boosted by low pH culture conditions. ESOM-induced tumor cell death occurred via rapid intracellular acidification and activation of several caspases. Inhibition of caspases activity by pan-caspase inhibitor z-vad-fmk completely abrogated the ESOM-induced cell death. ESOM administration (2.5 mg kg(-1)) to SCID mice engrafted with human melanoma reduced tumor growth, consistent with decrease of proliferating cells and clear reduction of pH gradients in tumor tissue. Moreover, systemic ESOM administration dramatically increased survival of human melanoma-bearing animals, in absence of any relevant toxicity. These data show preclinical evidence supporting the use of PPI as novel therapeutic strategy for melanoma, providing the proof of concept that PPI target human melanoma modifying tumor pH gradients.",

Limited studies on gynecological melanomas revealed significant heterogeneity and low mutational burden. To gain further insight into their genetics and DNA repair efficiency, we systematically investigated the status of eight genes whose products are critically involved in the MAPK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, and GNAQ/11 pathways, including BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, KRAS, c-KIT, PI3K, GNAQ, and GNA11, in a series of 16 primary gynecological melanomas, covering all anatomical locations, ranging from stages I to III. Analysis either by real-time PCR coupled with fluorescence melting curve analysis or by PCR followed by direct sequencing, along with studies for DNA mismatch repair status using immunohistochemistry, disclosed that 15 out of the 16 cases displayed wild-type genotypes, with a single case of vulvar primary melanoma, harboring the activating mutation BRAF(V600E). Investigations on whether this could reflect partly an efficient mismatch repair (MMR) mechanism were confirmed by normal expression of hMLH1 and hMSH2, suggesting that the lack of mutations could be explained by the operation of alternative pathogenetic mechanisms modulating downstream effectors of the signaling pathways. Our data suggest the presence of additional genetic components and provide the impetus for systematic approaches to reveal these yet unidentified genetic parameters. ",

In the Lewis lung carcinoma system, the number of metastatic modules and the weight of lung also increased time-dependently. Results from the B16 melanoma showed that the increase in lung nodules occurred 10 to 20 days after i.v. inoculation of tumor cells. DNA polymerase activity increased significantly during this period. Because the lung nodules were very small there was no obvious concomitant increase in lung weight. Since no significant infiltration of host cells was observed in the lung in response to metastatic foci, the rise in DNA polymerase activity should be due to tumor cells and not to infiltrating host cells. When the metastasis of Lewis lung carcinoma was inhibited by adriamycin and cyclophosphamide, decrease in DNA polymerase activity in the lung occurred.

In human melanomas containing an activating BRAF mutation (BRAF-positive melanomas), IGFBP7 is epigenetically silenced, which seems to be a critical step in melanoma genesis. Restoration of IGFBP7 function by the addition of recombinant IGFBP7 (rIGFBP7) induces apoptosis in BRAF-positive human melanoma cell lines, and systemically administered rIGFBP7 markedly suppresses the growth of BRAF-positive primary tumors in xenografted mice. Here we further evaluate the role of IGFBP7 in the treatment of BRAF-positive melanoma and other malignancies. We find that in human metastatic melanoma samples IGFBP7 is epigenetically silenced and at an even higher frequency than that found in primary melanomas. Using a murine experimental metastasis assay, we show that systemic administration of rIGFBP7 markedly suppresses the growth of metastatic disease and prolongs survival. An analysis of the NCI60 panel of human cancer cell lines reveals that in addition to melanoma, IGFBP7 induces apoptosis in several other cancer types, in particular colorectal cancer cell lines. In general, IGFBP7 induces apoptosis in human cancer cell lines that have an activating mutation in BRAF or RAS, and that are sensitive to chemical inhibition of BRAF-MEK-ERK signaling. Significantly, systemically administered rIGFBP7 blocks the growth of colorectal tumors containing an activating RAS or BRAF mutation in mouse xenografts. The results presented here, in conjunction with those from previous studies, justify the further development of IGFBP7 as an anticancer agent.",

The new system identifies significant prognostic variables in patients with melanoma and validates them in an analysis of 17,600 patients, making it possible to precisely determine the patient's chance for survival In light of physicians' ability to determine with more precision which patients are at high risk for melanoma recurrence, they face the dilemma of which, if any, surgical adjuvant therapy to choose. Alpha-interferon is the only agent approved for adjuvant therapy of melanoma in the United States, but its questionable benefits and substantial side effects make it hard to justify recommending it to patients. Discussion of trials of high- and low-dose interferon is presented here. The author's group has conducted trials of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF [Leukine]) as surgical adjuvant treatment of patients at high-risk for melanoma recurrence. One of the most important activities of GM-CSF is its ability to activate macrophages and cause them to become cytotoxic for human melanoma cells, at doses low enough to avoid the toxicity associated with other cytokines. The author presents promising trial results, discusses GM-CSF in other malignancies, and includes discussion of tumor vaccines, biochemotherapy, and other agents being studied as adjuvant therapy of melanoma. It is hoped that these newer approaches will result in therapies that are more effective and less toxic than interferon.",

Its product, p16, binds specifically to CDK4 and CDK6 in vitro and in vivo, inhibiting their kinase activity. CDKN2A is homozygously deleted or mutated in a large proportion of tumor cell lines and some primary tumors, including melanomas. The aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of CDKN2A and elucidate the mechanisms of p16 inactivation in a panel of 60 cell lines derived from sporadic melanomas. Twenty-six (43%) of the melanoma lines were homozygously deleted for CDKN2A, and an additional 15 (25%) lines carried missense, nonsense, or frameshift mutations. All but one of the latter group were shown by microsatellite analysis to be hemizygous for the region of 9p surrounding CDKN2A. p16 was detected by Western blotting in only five of the cell lines carrying mutations. Immunoprecipitation of p16 in these lines, followed by Western blotting to detect the coprecipitation of CDK4 and CDK6, revealed that p16 was functionally compromised in all cell lines but the one that carried a heterozygous CDKN2A mutation. In the remaining 19 lines that carried wild-type CDKN2A alleles, Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation indicated that 11 cell lines expressed a wild-type protein. Northern blotting was performed on the remaining eight cell lines and revealed that one cell line carried an aberrantly sized RNA transcript, and two other cell lines failed to express RNA. The promoter was found to be methylated in five cell lines that expressed CDKN2A transcript but not p16. Presumably, the message seen by Northern blotting in these cell lines is the result of cross-hybridization of the total cDNA probe with the exon 1beta transcript. Microsatellite analysis revealed that the majority of these cell lines were hemi/homozygous for the region surrounding CDKN2A, indicating that the wild-type allele had been lost. In the 11 cell lines that expressed functional p16, microsatellite analysis revealed loss of heterozygosity at the markers immediately surrounding CDKN2A in five cases, and the previously characterized R24C mutation of CDK4 was identified in one of the remaining 6 lines. These data indicate that 55 of 60 (92%) melanoma cell lines demonstrated some aberration of CDKN2A or CDK4, thus suggesting that this pathway is a primary genetic target in melanoma development.",

We studied B16 murine melanomas of increasing metastatic potential (F1, low; BL-6, intermediate; F10, high) as a feasibility study to determine the potential for human melanoma imaging using FDG-PET. Male C57BL-6 mice (50 g) were implanted sc with 1-mm3 fragments of B16 melanomas. Fourteen days later mice were injected ip with 1.25 muCi of [14C]DG. Sixty minutes later tumor (T) and gastrocnemius muscle (M) were harvested, solubilized, and counted for [14C]DG dpm/mg to estimate glucose utilization. Autoradiographic imaging was carried out similarly, using 2.0 muCi or [14C]DG with 30-day exposure of T and M tissue sections (20 microns thick) to X-ray film. The uptake of [14C]DG (expressed as dpm/mg; % injected dose/g; and tumor-to-muscle uptake ratios) was 6 to 10 times higher in tumors than in muscle tissue (P less than 0.001). All three melanoma cell lines imaged successfully with [14C]DG autoradiography. Tumor uptake of [14C]DG did not correlate with increasing metastatic potential. The experimental B16 murine melanomas F1, BL-6, and F10 extract glucose at higher rates than muscle tissue, a property necessary for successful PET imaging of cutaneous melanoma. The lack of correlation between glucose extraction and metastatic potential suggests that the demands for glucose during tumor growth and metastasis are not related. This is the first laboratory study to predict that human malignant melanoma will image with FDG-PET.",

Therefore, early detection of primary melanoma tumors is essential. The finding that melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) is overexpressed in isolated melanoma cells and melanoma tissues led to the radiolabeling of several alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) analogs for early detection and treatment of melanoma. We have coupled the alpha-MSH analog Ac-Nle-Asp-His-d-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-NH(2), through the epsilon-amino group of Lys(11), to a pyrazolyl-containing chelator (pz). The resulting pz-alpha-MSH analog reacted with the fac-[(99m)Tc(CO)(3)](+) moiety, giving [Ac-Nle(4),Asp(5),d-Phe(7),Lys(11)(pz-(99m)Tc(CO)(3))]alpha-MSH(4-11) in high yield, high specific activity and high radiochemical purity. This radioconjugate, which presents remarkable stability in vitro, exhibited time- and temperature-dependent internalization (4 h at 37 degrees C; 56.7% maximum internalization) and high cellular retention (only 38% was released from the cell after 5 h) in murine melanoma B16F1 cells. A significant tumor uptake [4.2+/-0.9%ID/g, at 4 h postinjection (p.i.)] was also obtained in melanoma-bearing C57BL6 mice. The in vivo affinity and specificity of the radioconjugate to MC1R were demonstrated by receptor-blocking studies with the potent NDP-MSH agonist (63.5% reduction in tumor uptake at 4 h p.i.).",

On presentation, a presumptive clinical diagnosis of mucosal melanoma was made, which was confirmed by incisional biopsy with subsequent histopathologic evaluation. Macroscopically, the morphology and highly pigmented nature of the tumor was suggestive of a rarer subtype of melanoma known as animal-type melanoma, also referred to as pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma. However, microscopically, the tumor showed histopathologic features consistent with a high-grade acral (mucosal) lentiginous melanoma with overt cytomorphologic features of malignancy in addition to showing prominent pigment synthesis resembling animal-type melanoma. A detailed search of the literature did not identify a previous report of OMM with prominent pigment synthesis resembling animal-type melanoma.

        "Doc_abstract":"The treatment of melanoma has been revolutionized over the past decade with the development of effective molecular and immune targeted therapies. The great majority of patients with melanoma have mutations in oncogenes that predominantly drive signaling through the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Analytic tools have been developed that can effectively stratify patients into molecular subsets based on the identification of mutations in oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes that drive the MAPK pathway. At the same time, potent and selective inhibitors of mediators of the MAPK pathway such as RAF, MEK, and ERK have become available. The most dramatic example is the development of single-agent inhibitors of BRAF (vemurafenib, dabrafenib, encorafenib) and MEK (trametinib, cobimetinib, binimetinib) for patients with metastatic BRAFV600-mutant melanoma, a subset that represents 40% to 50% of patients with metastatic melanoma. More recently, the elucidation of mechanisms underlying resistance to single-agent BRAF inhibitor therapy led to a second generation of trials that demonstrated the superiority of BRAF inhibitor/MEK inhibitor combinations (dabrafenib/trametinib; vemurafenib/cobimetinib) compared to single-agent BRAF inhibitors. Moving beyond BRAFV600 targeting, a number of other molecular subsets--such as mutations in MEK, NRAS, and non-V600 BRAF and loss of function of the tumor suppressor neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1)--are predicted to respond to MAPK pathway targeting by single-agent pan-RAF, MEK, or ERK inhibitors. As these strategies are being tested in clinical trials, preclinical and early clinical trial data are now emerging about which combinatorial approaches might be best for these patients.",

Antigen-loss variants can often result, as these antigens are not critical for tumor cell survival. Exploration of functionally relevant targets has been limited. The melanoma inhibitor of apoptosis protein (ML-IAP; livin) is overexpressed in melanoma, contributing to disease progression and treatment resistance. Improved understanding of the significance of ML-IAP immune responses in patients has possible therapeutic applications. We found ML-IAP frequently expressed in melanoma metastases by immunohistochemistry. To assess spontaneous immunity to ML-IAP, an overlapping peptide library representing full-length protein was utilized to screen cellular responses in stage I-IV patients and healthy controls by ELISPOT. A broad array of CD4(+) and CD8(+) cellular responses against ML-IAP was observed with novel class I and class II epitopes identified. Specific HLA-A*0201 epitopes were analyzed further for frequency of reactivity. The generation of specific CD4(+) and cytotoxic T cells revealed potent functional capability including cytokine responsiveness to melanoma cell lines and tumor cell killing. In addition, recombinant ML-IAP protein used in an ELISA demonstrated high titer antibody responses in a subset of patients. Several melanoma patients who received CTLA-4 blockade with ipilimumab developed augmented humoral immune responses to ML-IAP as a function of treatment which was associated with beneficial clinical outcomes. High frequency immune responses in melanoma patients, associations with favorable treatment outcomes, and its essential role in melanoma pathogenesis support the development of ML-IAP as a disease marker and therapeutic target.",

We studied the in vivo tumor-to-background (TB) ratios in six patients with posterior uveal melanoma (one previously enucleated). IHC was performed in 3 of 6 tumors after enucleation and in another 20 uveal melanomas, 7 metastatic lymph nodes from skin melanoma, and 2 normal specimens. 125I-epidepride autoradiography was performed in 10 uveal melanomas (3 of which were studied in vivo), 7 metastases, and 2 normal samples. Radioligand uptake was present in the affected eye of 5 patients with uveal melanoma (TB = 3.1-6.1) and absent in the operated one (TB = 1). Eight uveal tumors were positive at IHC (35%), 14 weakly positive (61%), and 1 negative (4%). Two metastases were positive (29%), 2 weakly positive (29%), and 3 negative (42%). Two uveal tumors were positive at autoradiography (20%), 7 had nonspecific binding (70%), and 1 was negative (10%).

There is no satisfactory treatment for patients with metastatic melanoma that have an estimated 5-year survival of 6%. The potential of radioimmunotherapy (RIT) for the treatment of metastatic melanoma was recognized very early by RIT pioneers when murine melanoma was successfully treated by DeNardo, and later when Larson reported a shrinkage of tumor in a patient with metastatic melanoma treated with 131I-labeled Fab' fragments of a mAb against high-molecular-weight melanoma-associated antigen. Despite successes in the 1980s, RIT of melanoma did not develop into a clinical modality. The reasons for this are complex. In recent years, RIT has made an impression, as evidenced by the recent approval of Zevalin and Bexxar (anti-CD20 mAbs labeled with 90Y and 131I, respectively). Now there is a \"window of opportunity\" for RIT to become an effective therapy for metastatic melanoma. Surface antigen GD3 has been evaluated in patients as a potential target for melanoma RIT; pretargeting the administration of antibodies and intralesional administration of an antibody labeled with potent alpha-emitter 213-Bismuth have shown promise in clinical studies. Melanin, the pigment that gives melanoma its name, has emerged as a novel antigen for delivery of radioactivity to the tumors by antimelanin antibody. Simultaneously, radiolabeled metal-cyclized alpha-MSH peptide analogs and melanin-binding peptides are being developed as targeting molecules for melanoma.

Melanoma angiogenesis, lung colonization, and spontaneous pulmonary metastasis were inhibited in mice bearing D-12, U-25, or thrombospondin-1 overexpressing R-18 tumors, which showed high thrombospondin-1 expression and secreted large quantities of thrombospondin-1 into the blood, but not in mice bearing wild-type R-18 tumors, which were negative for thrombospondin-1. D-12 tumors suppressed the growth of their own spontaneous metastases. The anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic effects of D-12 and U-25 tumors were blocked in mice treated with thrombospondin-1 neutralizing antibody. Dormant avascular microcolonies having an elevated apoptotic activity were seen in the lungs of mice bearing D-12 or U-25 tumors, whereas only neovascularized lung macrocolonies were seen in control and antibody-treated mice.

Melanomas of the eye have the advantage of growing in the special environment of an immune privileged site and it has long been shown, that the special immunosuppressive properties of the intraocular microenvironment are strongly mediated by cytokines, especially transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Here, we sought to investigate the presence of TGF-beta in surgically removed uveal melanoma specimens using immunohistochemical methods to verify possible autocrine mechanisms. Immunocytochemistry for pan-TGF-beta and TGF-beta(2) was performed on 13 melanoma specimens using an alkaline phosphatase labeling procedure. Melanocytic origin of the tumors was confirmed by HMB-45 staining. All tissue samples exhibited positive staining using either pan-TGF-beta or TGF-beta(2) antibody regardless of cell-type, size of the tumor, or tumor location. The intensity of staining did not vary significantly within a given tumor. All tumors stained positive against the HMB-45 antibody. Many cytokines have been found to act on melanoma tumors. The presence of the TGF-beta(2) isoform in all specimens points to progressive tumor-growth as has been shown for melanomas of the skin. Based on our immunohistochemical findings and the immunosuppressive properties of TGF-beta, we suppose that ocular melanomas should be able to create their own immunosuppressive environment even in the uvea, which might be a non-privileged site.",

MiRNA expression was then analyzed comparing subtypes and additional clinicopathologic criteria including somatic mutations. The prevalence and association of an inherited variant in a miRNA binding site in the 3'UTR of the KRAS oncogene, referred to as the KRAS-variant, was also evaluated. We show that seven miRNAs, miR-142-3p, miR-486, miR-214, miR-218, miR-362, miR-650 and miR-31, were significantly correlated with acral as compared to non-acral melanomas (p < 0.04). In addition, we discovered that the KRAS-variant was enriched in non-acral melanoma (25%), and that miR-137 under expression was significantly associated with melanomas with the KRAS-variant. Our findings indicate that miRNAs are differentially expressed in melanoma subtypes and that their misregulation can be impacted by inherited gene variants, supporting the hypothesis that miRNA misregulation reflects biological differences in melanoma.",

The skin is the most common site of cancer, accounting for nearly half of all cancers in the US, with approximately 2-3 million cases of non-melanoma cancers occurring each year worldwide. We hypothesized that a high-anxious, stress-prone behavioral phenotype would result in a higher chronic stress burden, lower protective-immunity, and increased progression of the immuno-responsive skin cancer, squamous cell carcinoma. SKH1 mice were phenotyped as high- or low-anxious at baseline, and subsequently exposed to ultraviolet-B light (1 minimal erythemal dose (MED), 3 times/week, 10-weeks). The significant strengths of this cancer model are that it uses a normal, immunocompetent, outbred strain, without surgery/injection of exogenous tumor cells/cell lines, and produces lesions that resemble human tumors. Tumors were counted weekly (primary outcome), and tissues collected during early and late phases of tumor development. Chemokine/cytokine gene-expression was quantified by PCR, tumor-infiltrating helper (Th), cytolytic (CTL), and regulatory (Treg) T cells by immunohistochemistry, lymph node T and B cells by flow cytometry, adrenal and plasma corticosterone and tissue vascular-endothelial-growth-factor (VEGF) by ELISA. High-anxious mice showed a higher tumor burden during all phases of tumor development. They also showed: higher corticosterone levels (indicating greater chronic stress burden), increased CCL22 expression and Treg infiltration (increased tumor-recruited immuno-suppression), lower CTACK/CCL27, IL-12, and IFN-γ gene-expression and lower numbers of tumor infiltrating Th and CTLs (suppressed protective immunity), and higher VEGF concentrations (increased tumor angiogenesis/invasion/metastasis). These results suggest that the deleterious effects of high trait anxiety could be: exacerbated by life-stressors, accentuated by the stress of cancer diagnosis/treatment, and mediate increased tumor progression and/or metastasis. Therefore, it may be beneficial to investigate the use of chemotherapy-compatible anxiolytic treatments immediately following cancer diagnosis, and during cancer treatment/survivorship.",

Because even melanomas harboring wild-type (wt) p53 show an abnormal response to radiation and p53 mutations occur late during melanoma progression, we investigated whether the effect of the bcl-2/bcl-xL bispecific antisense oligonucleotide 4625 is dependent on the p53 status in human C8161 melanoma cells. Upon treatment with oligonucleotide 4625, p53-mut C8161 cells showed earlier DNA damage, which occurred concomitantly with the reduction of bcl-2 and bcl-xL expression and the increase in the expression of proapoptotic bax. Loss of cell viability, bcl-2 down-regulation, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, indicative of apoptosis, also occurred in wt p53 C8161 cells on treatment with oligonucleotide 4625. These effects, however, were mediated by strong induction of p53 without changes in p21 WAF1 expression in wt p53 cells, whereas a 70% decrease in p21 WAF1 expression was observed in mut p53 cells. In contrast to many other anticancer agents to which the apoptotic response is decreased because of p53 mutations, our data suggest that the bcl-2/bcl-xL bispecific antisense oligonucleotide 4625 effectively induces p53-independent apoptosis in human C8161 melanoma cells.",

The four major types of malignant melanoma are lentigo maligna melanoma, acral lentiginous melanoma, superficial spreading melanoma, and nodular melanoma. Lentigo maligna melanoma has irregular margins and usually occurs on sunlight-exposed skin in elderly patients. Acral lentiginous melanoma occurs on the hands and feet; it often demonstrates massive invasion when the vertical growth phase occurs. Among Caucasians, superficial spreading melanoma, which affects the trunk and extremities, is the most common malignant melanoma. These lesions are often variegated in color. Nodular melanomas are deeply pigmented and enlarge rapidly. For microstaging of malignant melanoma, determining Clark's level of tumor invasion or Breslow's thickness (from the top of the granular cell layer of the epidermis to the deepest extension of the tumor) is useful for assessment of prognosis. Establishing a definite diagnosis of malignant melanoma is feasible through clinicopathologic correlation.

Soluble melanoma antigen Ag injected i.p. into the tumor-bearing host can effectively augment melanoma growth in vivo. Two T cell types with the L3T4+ or double-negative/I-J+ phenotype are involved in the suppression of anti-melanoma CTL responses and can easily be generated in the in vitro primary 12 h-culture. Anti-melanoma Ts recognizes the GM3(NeuAc) structure and distinguishes GM3 molecular species. This is because liposomes constructed with GM3(NeuAc) but not with GM3(NeuGc) gangliosides alone can effectively induce the melanoma-specific Ts. It is thus likely that tumor cells can escape from the immunologic surveillance system by stimulating the repertoire of Ts for self-Ag, GM3, which has existed even in the unprimed conditions in order to maintain self-tolerance. These would appear to be the major escape mechanisms.",

IIB-MEL-J cells secreted into the conditioned media about 30% of the newly synthesized protein, which was active at acidic pH.

Diagnosis is in most cases established by clinical examination with great accuracy. Local treatment of uveal melanoma has improved, with increased use of conservative methods and preservation of the eye, but survival rates have remained unchanged. Recent advances in cytogenetics and genetics enhanced prognostication and enabled to determine tumors with high metastatic potential. However, due to lack of effective systemic therapy, prognosis of patients with metastasis remains poor and metastatic disease remains the leading cause of death among patients with uveal melanoma. Conjunctival melanoma is rare, but its incidence is increasing. It mostly occurs among white adults. In majority of cases it originates from preceding primary acquired melanosis. Current standard treatment for conjunctival melanoma is wide local excision with adjuvant therapy, including brachytherapy, cryotherapy and topical application of chemotherapeutic agent. Rarity of this tumor limits conduction of controlled trials to define the best treatment modality. As well as for uveal melanoma, prognosis of patients with metastasis is poor because there is no effective systemic therapy.

By paired t test, metastatic tumor doubling time was significantly faster than primary tumor doubling time (P = 0.01). Extrapolating the growth curves of metastatic melanoma to the point of onset of metastasis revealed that dissemination of tumor cells occurred well before first clinical presentation and symptoms in two cases, and in one case, during the interval between clinical presentation and complete excision of the primary. At the opposite pole, extrapolated growth curves for slow tumor doubling time melanoma demonstrated that long-term follow up (>10 years) is required to determine whether patients have been cured of melanoma or not. Overall, these estimates of melanoma tumor doubling time validate the concept of tumor progression, reinforce the tenet of early detection and curative excision, and can explain the phenomenon of late onset of metastases, respectively.",

Targeted elimination of less than 2% of the tumor cells that coexpress high molecular weight melanoma-associated antigen (HMW-MAA) (melanoma-associated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, MCSP) and CD20 lastingly eradicated melanoma lesions, whereas targeting of any random 10% tumor cell subset was not effective.

These surface components of the bilayered lipid membrane of tumor cells are the targets of active immunotherapy with melanoma vaccine. Purified gangliosides in aqueous solution form micelles and, at high density, form lactones. Their antigenic expression (physical conformation and orientation) on the cell surface is governed by the nature of the sphingosine and the fatty acids they contain. Evidence is accruing to show that the nature of the fatty acid moiety of gangliosides differs in normal and neoplastic cells. Gangliosides per se are not immunogenic and require extrinsic adjuvanticity. Preparation of a melanoma cell vaccine for active immunotherapy requires an understanding of the ganglioside profile of melanoma, the ganglioside-associated heterogeneity of melanoma, and the role of shed melanoma gangliosides in the immunosuppression of cell mediated and humoral immunity. In addition, the role of some of the anti-ganglioside antibodies in the elimination of shed gangliosides, the cytotoxic killing of tumor cells, as well as in the down-regulation of lymphocyte functions must be considered in the formulation of vaccine.

This review will concentrate on choroidal melanoma. At diagnosis, choroidal melanoma usually appears as a pigmented (85%) tumor underlying the retina with a median basal dimension of 11 mm and a mean thickness of 4.5 mm. The American Joint Committee on Cancer classification allows for categorization and staging of melanoma. Following ocular therapy, adjuvant systemic therapy is provided for patients with high-risk melanoma who demonstrate alterations in chromosomes 3, 6, and 8 or those with class 2 on gene-expression profiling, detected by needle biopsy or solid tumor biopsy. The prognosis of choroidal melanoma depends most importantly on the genetic alterations and tumor size. Every millimeter increase in thickness leads to a 5% increased risk for metastasis. The leading conditions that simulate choroidal melanoma include choroidal nevus, peripheral exudative hemorrhagic chorioretinopathy, congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), hemorrhagic RPE detachment, choroidal hemangioma, age-related macular degeneration, RPE hyperplasia, and others. These pseudomelanomas can be differentiated from choroidal melanoma by their unique clinical features.;Choroidal melanoma is a serious malignancy with characteristic features.

More importantly, 63.8% (46/72) of the benign tumors were transformed to malignant melanoma in the HL-RET-mice.

Since early development of tumors could contribute to shortening of the research period, HL-RET-mice could be a useful model for analysis of melanomagenesis. We then found that the expression level of Mps one binder kinase activator-like-2B (Mobkl2b) in benign tumors was higher than that in malignant melanoma in HL-RET-mice.

This analysis has provided an interesting snapshot of the landscape of tumor genomes by showing that they contain a few frequently mutated genes (denominated 'mountains'). On the contrary, the large majority of CAN genes are altered at low frequency (designated 'hills'). Whether 'hill' type CAN genes are tumor specific is largely unknown. To address this question we evaluated the mutational profiles of 27 'hill' CAN genes in glioblastoma, melanoma and pancreatic carcinoma by sequencing the exons previously found mutated by Wood and colleagues. Only 4 of the breast/colorectal 'hill' type CAN genes (SMAD4, MYO18B, NAV3 and MMP2) were also mutated in melanoma and pancreatic carcinoma, while none was altered in glioblastoma. These results suggest that 'hill' type CAN genes are not frequently shared by different tumor types and that their mutation patterns are tissue specific. Tumor-specific genome wide mutational profiling will be required to identify 'hill' type CAN genes that characterize the genomic landscapes of each cancer lineage.",

Nevertheless, in metastatic melanoma, the nature of cancer stem cells is under debate and their contribution to metastasis formation remains unknown. Using an experimental metastasis model, we discovered that high levels of the WNT receptor, FZD7, correlated with enhanced metastatic potentials of melanoma cell lines. Knocking down of FZD7 in a panel of four melanoma cell lines led to a significant reduction in lung metastases in animal models, arguing that FZD7 plays a causal role during metastasis formation. Notably, limiting dilution analyses revealed that FZD7 is essential for the tumor initiation of melanoma cells and FZD7 knockdown impeded the early expansion of metastatic melanoma cells shortly after seeding, in accordance with the view that tumor initiating ability of cancer cells is required for metastasis formation. FZD7 activated JNK in melanoma cell lines in vitro and the expression of a dominant negative JNK suppressed metastasis formation in vivo, suggesting that FZD7 may promote metastatic growth of melanoma cells via activation of JNK. Taken together, our findings uncovered a signaling pathway that regulates the tumor initiation of melanoma cells and contributes to metastasis formation in melanoma. ",

However, the concentrations of NO that melanoma cells are exposed to in vivo have been unknown. To provide cell kinetic data for use in predicting those concentrations, synthesis and consumption of NO was examined in A375 melanoma cells. Nitric oxide synthesis was undetectable. The rate of intracellular NO consumption was determined by continuous monitoring of NO concentrations following injection of NO solutions in a closed chamber. After correcting for autoxidation and consumption from media-generated O(2)(-), the rate constant obtained for cellular consumption was 7.1±1.1 s(-1). This information was combined with previous data on macrophage NO kinetics to develop a mathematical model to predict NO levels in cutaneous melanomas. Synthesis of NO by macrophages in the stroma was found to give a maximum concentration at the tumor periphery of 0.2 μM. Because of the high rates of cellular consumption, the elevation in NO concentration is predicted to be very localized, approximately 90% of the concentration decay occurring within 30 μm of the tumor edge.

Out of 2,184 melanoma cases, 684 (31.3%) had a high nevus count (>50). High nevus counts were associated with favorable prognostic factors such as lower Breslow thickness, less ulceration and lower mitotic rate, despite adjustment for age. Nevus count was not predictive of sentinel node status. The crude 5- and 10-year melanoma-specific survival rate was higher in melanomas cases with a high nevus count compared to those with a low nevus count (91.2 vs. 86.4% and 87.2 vs. 79%, respectively). The difference in survival remained significant after adjusting for all known melanoma prognostic factors (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.43, confidence interval [CI] = 0.21-0.89). The favorable prognostic value of a high nevus count was also seen within the positive sentinel node subgroup of patients (HR = 0.22, CI = 0.08-0.60).

        "Doc_abstract":"The in vitro expression level of interleukin-8 (IL-8) correlates with the metastatic potential of human melanoma cells. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the expression level of IL-8 in human melanoma cells is influenced by the organ microenvironment. A375P cells, a low metastatic human melanoma, and A375SM cells, a highly metastatic variant, were injected into the subcutis (s.c.), spleen (to produce liver metastases), and lateral tail vein (to produce lung metastases) of athymic nude mice. Northern blot and immunohistochemical analyses determined that s.c. tumors, lung lesions, and liver lesions expressed high, intermediate, and low IL-8, mRNA, and protein, respectively. This differential regulation of IL-8 was not due to the size or density of the lesions or to selection of subpopulations of cells. We based this conclusion on the results of three experiments: (a) melanoma cell lines established in culture from in vivo-growing tumors exhibited similar levels of IL-8 mRNA transcripts; (b) in a crossover experiment, the level of IL-8 mRNA was always high in A375 tumors reestablished in the skin and low in the tumors reestablished in the liver, regardless of whether the melanoma cells had been first harvested from s.c. or liver tumors; and (c) A375 melanoma cells cocultured with human keratinocytes produced high levels of IL-8 protein, whereas A375 cells cocultured with highly differentiated human hepatoma cells produced decreased levels. When A375P cells were then incubated with cytokines associated with keratinocytes (IL-1 and interferon beta) or hepatocytes (transforming growth factor alpha or beta), IL-1 enhanced the production of IL-8 protein, whereas TGF-beta decreased its production. These data show that IL-8 expression in melanoma cells is modulated by local host factors.",

Each of these randomized trials demonstrated no clinical benefit, although again there was a significant correlation between antibody response after vaccination and disease free and overall survival. To better understand this paradox, we established a surgical adjuvant model targeting GD2 ganglioside on EL4 lymphoma cells injected into the foot pad followed by amputation at variable intervals. Our findings are (1) comparable strong therapeutic benefit resulted from treatment of mice after amputation with a GD2-KLH conjugate vaccine or with anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody 3F8. (2) The strongest correlation was between antibody induction in response to vaccination and prolonged survival. (3) Antibody titers in response to vaccination in tumor challenged mice as compared to unchallenged mice were far lower despite the absence of detectable recurrences at the time. (4) The half life of administered 3F8 monoclonal antibody (but not control antibody) in challenged mice administered was significantly shorter than the half life of 3F8 antibody in unchallenged controls. The correlation between vaccine-induced antibody titers and prolonged survival may reflect, at least in part, increased tumor burden in antibody-negative mice.

Clinical evidence has revealed that p16(INK4A), an allosteric inhibitor of CDK4/6, is inactivated in over half of human melanomas, and numerous animal models have demonstrated that p16(INK4A) deletion promotes melanoma. FBXO4, a specificity factor for the E3 ligase that directs timely cyclin D1 proteolysis, has not been studied in melanoma. We demonstrate that Fbxo4 deficiency induces Braf-driven melanoma and that this phenotype depends on cyclin D1 accumulation in mice, underscoring the importance of this ubiquitin ligase in tumor suppression. Furthermore, we have identified a substrate-binding mutation, FBXO4 I377M, that selectively disrupts cyclin D1 degradation while preserving proteolysis of the other known FBXO4 substrate, TRF1. The I377M mutation and Fbxo4 deficiency result in nuclear accumulation of cyclin D1, a key transforming neoplastic event. Collectively, these data provide evidence that FBXO4 dysfunction, as a mechanism for cyclin D1 overexpression, is a contributor to human malignancy. ",

We report long-term outcomes in patients with in-transit extremity melanoma who underwent isolated limb perfusion (ILP) in an era of increasingly accurate staging, uniform operative and treatment conditions, and regular long-term follow-up. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between May 1992 and February 2005, 91 patients (median age, 57 years; 50 women, 41 men) underwent a 90-minute hyperthermic ILP (melphalan, 10 to 13 mg/L limb volume, tumor necrosis factor [TNF; n = 44], or interferon [n = 38]) using uniform operative technique and intraoperative leak monitoring. Patients were prospectively followed for response, in-field progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Parameters associated with in-field PFS and OS were analyzed by standard statistical methods. Results There was one operative death (1.1%). There were 62 complete responses (69%) and 23 partial responses (26%) in 90 assessable patients. At a median potential follow-up of 11 years, median in-field PFS was 12.4 months and median OS was 47.4 months; 5 and 10-year actuarial OS probabilities were 43% and 34%, respectively. Female sex and low tumor burden (< or = 20 lesions) were associated with prolonged in-field PFS (male:female hazard ratio [HR], 2.07; 95% CI, 1.27 to 3.38; 21+ v < or = 20 tumors HR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.21 to 4.34; P < .011 for both). Female sex was associated with improved OS (P = .027; male:female HR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.07 to 3.09). CONCLUSION In appropriately selected patients, ILP has clinical benefit.

However, there have been few in vivo studies with antimelanoma scFvs because these have proved difficult to label with isotopes (e.g., 99mTc) suitable for imaging. We have generated a series of scFvs against HMW-MAA by chain shuffling and antibody phage selection on melanoma cells. In preliminary experiments we identified one scFv (RAFT3) as suitable for in vivo melanoma targeting. Direct radiolabeling of RAFT3 scFv with 99mTc was simple, yielding a radiochemical purity of >90%. The label remained stable for 24 h in vitro. 125I- and 99mTc-labeled RAFT3 scFv were tested in a nude mouse xenograft model for human melanoma and were compared with the parent MAb LHM2 and its F(ab')2 fragment versus nonmelanoma-specific MAb and scFv. RAFT3 scFv accumulated specifically in the tumor and showed greater tumor specificity compared with LHM2 with faster pharmacokinetics (t(1/2)alpha, 8 min; t(1/2)beta, 189 min; and t(1/2)alpha, 37 min; t(1/2)beta, 384 min, respectively) and reduced background in liver, lung, and spleen. Nonspecific accumulation of 99mTc-labeled RAFT3 scFv in the kidney was high but tumor:normal tissue ratios were better compared with 125I-labeled RAFT3 scFv and LHM2 F(ab')2. Overall, tumor-targeting efficiency at equivalent time points was scFv > IgG > F(ab')2 in good agreement with previously described scFvs engineered for 99mTc labeling.

Eye melanomas often originated at a young age, chiefly from the retinal pigment epithelium, also from the choroid, and rarely from the ciliary body. The eye tumors grew aggressively, were highly invasive, and metastasized to local and distant sites. The earliest formation of these tumors was associated with higher copy numbers of the transgene; mice of different single-copy lines varied greatly in age of onset and frequency of eye tumors. Coat pigmentation was reduced in almost all lines, to various extents. Primary skin melanomas arose later and less frequently than eye melanomas. Hence they were at early stages and of unknown long-range incidence in this investigation, in which autopsies covered the first half-year of life.

Although BRAF(V600E) is the most prevalent oncogene in melanoma, the BRAF(V600E) mutant is not sufficient to induce tumors in vivo. Mutation at the CDKN2A locus is another melanoma-predisposing event that can disrupt the function of both p16(INK4a) and ARF. Numerous studies have focused on the role of p16(INK4a) in melanoma, but the involvement of ARF, a well-known p53 activator, is still controversial. Using a transgenic BRAF(V600E) mouse model previously generated in our laboratory, we report that loss of ARF is able to enhance spontaneous melanoma formation and cause profound sensitivity to neonatal UVB exposure. Mechanistically, BRAF(V600E) and ARF deletion synergize to inhibit nucleotide excision repair by epigenetically repressing XPC and inhibiting the E2F4/DP1 complex.

Where possible, tumor was microdissected at several sites. Genotyping involved assessment of loss of heterozygosity [LOH]), which was accomplished using a panel of nine polymorphic tetranucleotide microsatellites. Polymerase chain reaction was performed on the normal tissue sample to establish microsatellite heterozygous status. Informative markers were then tested on microdissected lesional tissue and scored for the presence and extent of allelic imbalance (AI). Microsatellite informativeness varied from 33% to 66%. Benign nevi were without AI. All invasive melanomas manifested acquired allelic loss, which involved 75% or 100% of the markers shown to be informative for each subject. Eleven of 13 (84%) primary melanomas demonstrated intratumoral heterogeneity of AI consistent with development of tumor subclones with differing genotypic profiles within thin as well as thick melanomas. Although a consistent pattern did not emerge among the markers, LOH of 9p21 (D9S254) occurred in 60% (9/15) of the cases followed by 40% of cases displaying LOH of 1p34, p53, 10q (MXI1), and 10q23 (D10S520) and 25% with 5q21 (D5S 592) abnormalities. A third of the cases including the metastatic foci demonstrated two different patterns of AI affecting alternative alleles of the same genomic marker within different parts of the melanoma. Two melanomas in situ did not display LOH of any markers in the informative cases although the in situ component in the invasive tumors had allelic losses that were in part similar to the invasive areas.

Selected lymphangiogenic clones were then grafted into severe combined immunodeficient mice, where they induced lymphangiogenesis and metastasized into sentinel nodes, whereas non-lymphangiogenic clones from the same patient did not metastasize. Transcriptome analysis revealed high expression of vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) and platelet derived growth factor C (PDGF-C) as well as of the met proto-oncogene (MET) and its targets to be associated with this lymphangiogenic phenotype. Screening of a set of independently isolated melanoma cell lines from other patients confirmed this association between expression of high levels of MET and of VEGF-C and PDGF-C.

Although the reasons for monosomy in cancer has remained obscure, one possibility is that multiple tumor suppressor genes residing on this chromosome must be lost in unison during tumor progression, and this is easier to accomplish by chromosome segregation rather than by multiple mutational and/or deletion events. The localization and identification of these genes has been hampered by the monosomy itself, which has resulted in a paucity of small defining deletions in tumors. Here, we have addressed the issue of monosomy in tumor development by using functional complementation mapping to localize and demonstrate the existence of different melanoma suppressor genes on chromosome 10 and assigned each locus a distinct tumorigenic phenotype. We report that a locus on 10q distal to 10q23.1, likely involving the PTEN tumor suppressor, causes a severe reduction in the kinetics of melanoma tumor formation in animals. In contrast, a previously unrecognized region at 10p15.3 has a distinct, but lesser, effect on in vivo melanoma growth. Thus, the loss of both of these regions, which is accomplished by tumor-associated monosomy, provides a significant growth advantage over the individual loss of either region, thereby explaining the monosomy observed in sporadic melanomas.",

Our data demonstrate that high serum LDH is associated with a significant increase in LDH isoenzymes 3 and 4, and a decrease in LDH isoenzymes 1 and 2. Since LDH isoenzymes play a role in both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), we subsequently determined using tissue microarray (TMA) analysis that the levels of proteins associated with mitochondrial function, lactate metabolism, and regulators of glycolysis were all elevated in advanced melanomas compared with nevic melanocytes. To investigate whether in advanced melanoma, the glycolysis and OXPHOS pathways might be linked, we determined expression of the monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) 1 and 4. Analysis of a nevus-to-melanoma progression TMA revealed that MCT4, and to a lesser extend MCT1, were elevated with progression to advanced melanoma. Further analysis of human melanoma specimens using the Seahorse XF24 extracellular flux analyzer indicated that metastatic melanoma tumors derived a large fraction of energy from OXPHOS. Taken together, these findings suggest that in stage IV melanomas with normal serum LDH, glycolysis and OXPHOS may provide metabolic symbiosis within the same tumor, whereas in stage IV melanomas with high serum LDH glycolysis is the principle source of energy.",

In order to examine whether expression of mutated RAS genes in human melanoma cells alters their susceptibility to lysis by LAK cells, seven melanoma lines were assessed for the presence of Ki- and N-RAS genes bearing all possible mutations at codons 12, 13 and 61. A panel of 21 clones deriving from the metastatic lesion Me665/2, which had a Gln-->Arg substitution at codon 61 of N-RAS (N-RAS/61+), were also examined. Melanoma cells and clones were used as targets of allogeneic LAK in a 4-h 51Cr-release assay. LAK showed a higher lysis on melanoma lines and clones harbouring a mutated RAS compared with counterparts bearing no RAS mutations. In addition, LAK-mediated lysis drastically decreased on Me665/2 sublines progressively selected by exposure to LAK. This loss was paralleled by a reduction or even disappearance of N-RAS/61+ mRNA signal in Me665/2 sublines. To evaluate whether N-RAS could directly modulate LAK susceptibility to lysis, N-RAS/61+ gene was transfected in two N-RAS wild type (N-RAS/61-) 665/2 melanoma clones by a cosmid vector. In contrast to the high lysability of melanoma cells constitutively expressing the mutationally active N-RAS oncogene, N-RAS/61+ transfectants did not show a consistent high lysability by LAK, compared with some control pSV2neo transfectants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Mutational events, as well as adaptive mechanisms, contribute to the development of drug resistance. In this context we uncover here the role of a miRNA, miR-579-3p. We first show that low expression of miR-579-3p is a negative prognostic factor correlating with poor survival. Expression levels of miR-579-3p decrease from nevi to stage III/IV melanoma samples and even further in cell lines resistant to BRAF/MEK inhibitors. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that miR-579-3p acts as an oncosuppressor by targeting the 3'UTR of two oncoproteins: BRAF and an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, MDM2. Moreover miR-579-3p ectopic expression impairs the establishment of drug resistance in human melanoma cells. Finally, miR-579-3p is strongly down-regulated in matched tumor samples from patients before and after the development of resistance to targeted therapies. ",

However, evidence of linkage to 9p21 has been demonstrated in a significant proportion of kindreds with no detectable mutations in CDKN2A. It is possible that mutations in noncoding regions may be responsible for predisposition to melanoma in these families. We have analyzed approximately 1 kb of the CDKN2A promoter upstream of the start codon in an attempt to identify causal mutations in 107 melanoma families. Four sequence variants were detected. Two of these (A-191G and A-493T) did not segregate with disease and were present in a control population at a comparable frequency, indicating that they are unlikely to predispose to melanoma. The A-493T variant appeared to be in linkage disequilibrium with the previously described CDKN2A polymorphism Ala148Thr. The variant G-735A was detected in the control population, but segregation of this variant with melanoma within families could not be discounted. The fourth variant (G-34T), located in the 5' UTR, creates an aberrant initiation codon. This variant appeared to segregate with melanoma and was not detected in a control population. G-34T has recently been identified in a subset of Canadian melanoma families and was concluded to be associated with predisposition to melanoma. The creation of an aberrant initiation site in the 5' UTR may have an important role in carcinogenesis in a small percentage of families; however, mutations in the CDKN2A promoter appear to have a limited role in predisposition to melanoma.",

Mutations of BRAF have been proposed to contribute to melanoma development. Increased activity of the MAPK pathway prevents apoptosis and induces cell cycle progression. PTEN deletion results in Akt activation. Akt activation can result in the phosphorylation and inactivation of Raf. This decrease in downstream MEK and ERK activation may lead to loss of differentiation or senescence.

A number of factors complicate the diagnosis of desmoplastic/spindle cell melanoma, including the variable absence of a lentiginous component, its spindle cell morphology, and its many morphologic mimics, including scars, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, neurofibroma, atypical fibroxanthoma, and spindled carcinoma. The immunohistochemical confirmation of desmoplastic/spindle cell melanoma may also be difficult, because the majority of tumors are negative for specific melanocytic markers such as HMB-45 and Melan-A, despite their usual expression of S-100 protein. Two new and potentially promising melanocytic markers, microphthalmia transcription factor (MiTF) and melanoma cell adhesion molecule (Mel-CAM), have been shown to be sensitive markers of epithelioid melanoma, but have not been tested in desmoplastic/spindle cell melanoma or in other rare melanocytic neuroectodermal tumors such as clear cell sarcoma. We immunostained 79 tumors (20 desmoplastic/spindle cell melanomas, 10 scars, 10 neurofibromas, 12 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, 10 atypical fibroxanthomas, 10 clear cell sarcomas, 3 melanotic schwannomas, and 4 cellular blue nevi) for MiTF and Mel-CAM. MiTF expression was seen in 11 of 20 desmoplastic/spindle cell melanomas, 0 of 10 scars, 2 of 10 neurofibromas, 0 of 12 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, 1 of 10 atypical fibroxanthomas, 7 of 10 clear cell sarcomas, 3 of 3 melanotic schwannomas, and 3 of 4 cellular blue nevi. Mel-CAM expression was present in 14 of 17 desmoplastic/spindle cell melanomas, 0 of 10 scars, 4 of 10 neurofibromas, 3 of 11 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, 0 of 10 atypical fibroxanthomas, 9 of 10 clear cell sarcomas, 3 of 3 melanotic schwannomas, and 0 of 4 cellular blue nevi. MiTF and Mel-CAM were coexpressed in 6 of 17 desmoplastic/spindle cell melanomas and in no other tumor. Regarding desmoplastic/spindle cell melanoma, scar, neurofibroma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, and atypical fibroxanthoma, the sensitivity and specificity of MiTF for desmoplastic/spindle cell melanoma were 55% and 91%, respectively. For this same group of tumors, Mel-CAM had a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 83%. We conclude that the sensitivity and specificity of MiTF for desmoplastic melanoma equals or exceeds that of such markers as HMB-45 or Melan-A, and that MiTF should be part of the initial immunohistochemical panel for the work-up of such cases. Mel-CAM, while very sensitive, is relatively nonspecific, because it is also expressed in a variety of mesenchymal tumors and carcinomas. Mel-CAM is best reserved for cases morphologically suspected to be desmoplastic/ spindle cell melanoma, in which S-100 is positive and MiTF and other melanocytic markers are negative. These markers may also be helpful in certain other differential diagnoses, such as distinguishing clear cell sarcomas from epithelioid malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The incorporation of individualized molecular therapeutics into routine clinical practice for both non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and melanoma are amongst the most significant advances of the last decades in medical oncology. In NSCLC activating somatic mutations in exons encoding the tyrosine kinase domain of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) gene have been found to be predictive of a response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), erlotinib or gefitinib. More recently the EML4-ALK fusion gene which occurs in 3-5% of NSCLC has been found to predict sensitivity to crizotinib an inhibitor of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) receptor tyrosine kinase. Similarly in melanoma, 50% of cases have BRAF mutations in exon 15 mostly V600E and these cases are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib or dabrafenib. In a Phase III study of advanced melanoma cases with this mutation vemurafenib improved survival from 64% to 84% at 6 months, when compared with dacarbazine. In both NSCLC and melanoma clinical benefit is not obtained in patients without these genomic changes, and moreover in the case of vemurafenib the therapy may theoretically induce proliferation of cases of melanoma without BRAF mutations. An emerging clinical challenge is that of acquired resistance after initial responses to targeted therapeutics. Resistance to the TKI's in NSCLC is most frequently due to acquisition of secondary mutations within the tyrosine kinase of the EGFR or alternatively activation of alternative tyrosine kinases such as C-MET. Mechanisms of drug resistance in melanoma to vemurafenib do not involve mutations in BRAF itself but are associated with a variety of molecular changes including RAF1 or COT gene over expression, activating mutations in RAS or increased activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase PDGFRβ. Importantly these data support introducing re-biopsy of tumors at progression to continue to personalize the choice of therapy throughout the patient's disease course. ",

A novel VnR composed of an alpha v beta 1 association has been observed in one melanoma cell line and there is the possibility that heterogeneity of integrin composition could affect biological behavior of these tumors.

In this study, we evaluated the effect of blocking the two Ras downstream pathways phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt and Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase on melanoma development and regression in the TPRas mouse model. The inhibition of these two signaling cascades by topically applied Ly294002 and U0126 significantly delayed melanoma development and significantly decreased the tumor incidence, particularly when the drugs were applied in combination. Treatment with the inhibitors of established melanomas resulted in complete remission in 33% of mice and partial regression in 46% of mice when drugs were delivered in combination. These responses correlated with increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation both in vitro and in vivo and reduced tumor angiogenesis.

This tumor displayed a KIT exon 11 mutation leading to a unique combination of p.I571M and p.D572G deleterious amino acid changes. Such pattern also favors the diagnosis as KIT appears as a master oncogenic player in MM oncogenesis. ",

While some newer methods have yielded better prognostic information, some insights have evolved as a result of large-scale population-based analyses.;We review current data on several different prognostic factors and divide these factors according to their application in localized primary melanoma or metastatic melanoma. For each prognostic factor, the level of evidence supporting its use and its applicability to clinical practice are considered.;For localized primary melanoma, the dominant predictors of survival include lesion thickness, ulceration, and lymph node involvement. Factors such as age, sex, anatomic location, and satellite/in-transit lesions are important in localized melanoma. Factors currently being investigated are tumor vascularity, vascular invasion, mitotic rate, tumor regression, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. For metastatic melanoma, the most important prognostic factors are site of metastases and the presence of elevated serum lactic dehydrogenase. The value of these prognostic factors to clinicians caring for melanoma patients is discussed.;A better understanding of prognostic factors in cutaneous melanoma has evolved over the last decade, allowing oncologists to provide appropriate treatment for their patients. Many of the prognostic factors are interrelated. In the near future, it is expected that several molecular genetic factors will provide more insight into the prognosis of patients with melanoma.",

Tumor angiogenesis depends on the release of angiogenic growth factors by tumor cells and infiltrating inflammatory cells, and from the extracellular matrix following degradation by tumor proteases. Human melanoma progresses through different steps: nevocellular nevi, dysplastic nevi, in situ melanoma, radial growth phase melanoma (Breslow index < or = 0.75 mm), vertical growth phase melanoma (Breslow index > 0.75 mm), and metastatic melanoma. In agreement with progression, it acquires a rich vascular network, whereas an increasing proportion of tumor cells express the laminin receptor, which enables their adhesion to the vascular wall. Hence, both phenomena favour tumour cell extravasation and metastases. Melanocytic cells produce and release Fibroblast Growth Factor-2 (FGF-2), mainly in the steps of dysplastic nevus and melanoma in vertical growth phase. Melanoma cells also secrete the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), in parallel with the switch from the radial to the vertical growth phase and the metastatic phase.

Advances in molecular pathology and genome analysis technologies have led to the identification of genetic events and immune regulatory checkpoints that provide novel targets for pharmaceutical intervention in melanoma.

At the same time, the manipulation of immune system checkpoints through monoclonal antibodies changed clinical practice and led to further improvement of patient outcomes. In an effort to further develop melanoma targeted therapies that depend on the genetic profile of a given patient, high-throughput genome wide approaches (next-generation sequencing [NGS], gene arrays, etc) have been employed for the characterization of genetic alterations in the patient's tumor.

For estimation of prognosis and choice of adequate mode of therapy histopathological examinations with regard to the level of invasion according to Clark and Chung, histomorphometric evaluation of the depth of invasion suggested by Breslow and the pronostic index of Schmoeckel and Braun-Falco are useful. The operative therapy of choice is the extensive tumor excision. In case of extended local invasion radical vulvectomy is indicated, in certain cases combined with inguinal, sometimes even pelvic lymphonodectomy. In inoperable cases radiotherapy may be tried, but success seems to be poor. Polychemotherapy may induce remissions, but hardly a prolongation of survival. New therapy trials are dealing with immunmodulation, mostly using different substances of biological response modifiers. The prognosis of malignant melanoma of the vulva must be considered to be poorer than that of melanomas in other sites of the body, local recurrence is frequent, the five year survival rate being 30-35%.

Four tumors were DM, five were ND, and one tumor showed combined features of desmoplastic and conventional. Hierarchical cluster analysis clearly separated DM from NDM. The expression of a number of melanocyte differentiation genes was decreased in DM compared with NDM, which corresponded to immunohistochemical results. Various genes were upregulated in DM, including neurotrophic factors and genes involved in extracellular matrix production. A novel finding was the high expression of clusterin in DM, which was confirmed by immunohistochemical studies. Our results from gene expression profiling validate the distinction of DM from NDM.

Formalin-fixed primary melanomas from 74 relapsed and 42 nonrelapsed patients were sequenced for common BRAF and NRAS mutations (N = 71 results) and gene dosage at 9p21.3 including the genes CDKN2A (which encodes CDKN2A and P14ARF), CDKN2B (CDKN2B), and MTAP was measured using multiplexed ligation-dependant probe amplification (MLPA), (N = 75 results). BRAF/NRAS mutations were detected in 77% of relapsers and 58% of nonrelapsers (Fisher's exact P = 0.17), and did not predict ulceration or mitotic rate. There was no relationship between BRAF/NRAS mutations and gene dosage at 9p21.3. Reduced gene dosage at MTAP showed a borderline association with BRAF mutation (P = 0.04) and reduced gene dosage at the interferon gene cluster was borderline associated with wild type NRAS (P = 0.05). Reduced gene dosage in the CDKN2A regions coding for CDKN2A was associated with an increased risk of relapse (P = 0.03). Reduced gene dosage across 9p21.3 was associated with increased tumor thickness, mitotic rate, and ulceration (P = 0.02, 0.02, and 0.002, respectively), specifically in coding regions impacting on CDKN2B and P14ARF and CDKN2A. Loss at MTAP (P = 0.05) and the interferon gene cluster (P = 0.03) on 9p21 was also associated with tumor ulceration. There was no association between reduced gene dosage at 9p21.3 and subtype or site of tumor.

Critical biological features of metastasis include acquisition of migratory competence, growth factor independence, and invasive potential. In an attempt to identify genes that contribute to melanoma pathogenesis, a genome-wide search using bacterial artificial chromosome array comparative genomic hybridization and single nucleotide polymorphism arrays in a series of 64 metastatic melanoma samples and 20 melanoma cell lines identified increased copy numbers of Gab2 located on 11q14.1. Gab2 is an adaptor protein that potentiates the activation of the Ras-Erk and PI3K-Akt pathways and has recently been implicated in human cancer; however, its role in melanoma has not been explored. In this study, we found that Gab2 was either amplified (approximately 11%) and/or overexpressed (approximately 50%) in melanoma. Gab2 protein expression correlated with clinical melanoma progression, and higher levels of expression were seen in metastatic melanomas compared with primary melanoma and melanocytic nevi. We found that overexpression of Gab2 potentiates, whereas silencing of Gab2 reduces, migration and invasion of melanoma cells. Gab2 mediated the hyperactivation of Akt signaling in the absence of growth factors, whereas inhibition of the PI3K-Akt pathway decreased Gab2-mediated tumor cell migration and invasive potential. Gab2 overexpression resulted in enhanced tumor growth and metastatic potential in vivo. These studies demonstrate a previously undefined role for Gab2 in melanoma tumor progression and metastasis.",

Small choroidal melanoma in the posterior fundus is amenable to treatment options such as enucleation, radiotherapy, laser photocoagulation, and transpupillary thermotherapy or a combination of these methods. Transpupillary thermotherapy is a technique of tumor heating by infrared radiation delivered through the pupil into the tumor. This method causes dramatic tumor necrosis in choroidal melanomas up to 4 mm in thickness. With properly selected small choroidal melanomas, tumor control is approximately 94%. The heat induces cellular damage at the site of treatment with few remote side effects; therefore, complications are generally limited to the site of treatment and include retinal vascular obstruction (23%), retinal traction (20%), retinal neovascularization (6%), and retinal hole with detachment (< 1%). Tumors located temporal to the foveola demonstrate a statistically higher risk for retinal traction than those located in other quadrants. Tumors near the optic disk demonstrate a higher incidence of retinal neovascularization due to heat-induced obstruction of a major retinal vascular arcade. Overall, vision preservation is satisfactory after thermotherapy for choroidal melanoma, with more than 50% of patients maintaining the same or better vision after treatment, depending primarily on tumor location. In summary, small choroidal melanomas can be controlled with transpupillary thermotherapy, especially those near the optic disk and foveola in areas that are otherwise difficult to irradiate. Longer follow-up is necessary to assess for local recurrence and the impact of treatment on life prognosis.",

Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are considered a manifestation of the host immune response to tumor, but the role of TILs in melanoma mortality is controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate independent prognostic factors for melanoma mortality. We carried out a 10-year cohort study on 4133 melanoma patients from the same geographic area (Lazio) with primary cutaneous melanoma diagnosed between January 1998 and December 2008. The probability of survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods and prognostic factors were evaluated by multivariate analysis (Cox proportional hazards model). The 10-year survival rate for melanoma decreased with increasing Breslow thickness (Pfor trend<0.0001) and with age (Pfor trend<0.0001) whereas survival increased with increasing levels of TILs (Pfor trend=0.0001). The 10-year survival rate for melanoma divided into TILs intensity as scanty, moderate, and marked was 88.0, 92.2, and 97.0%, respectively. In the multivariate Cox model, the presence of high levels of TILs in primary invasive melanomas was associated with a lower risk of melanoma death (hazard ratio 0.32; 95% confidence interval 0.13-0.82) after controlling for sex, age, Breslow thickness, histological type, mitotic rate, and ulceration. After including lymph node status in the multivariate analysis, the protective effect of marked TILs on melanoma mortality remained (hazard ratio 0.37; 95% confidence interval 0.15-0.94). The results of this study suggest that the immune microenvironment affects melanoma survival. ",

We have sequenced all exons of CDKN2 and analysed the CDK4 gene for mutations in 27 UK families showing evidence of predisposition to melanoma. Five different germline mutations in CDKN2 were found in six families. Three of the mutations (Met53Ile, Arg24Pro and 23ins24) have been reported previously. We have identified two novel CDKN2 mutations (88delG and Ala118Thr) which are likely to be associated with the development of melanoma, because of their co-segregation with the disease and their likely functional effect on the CDKN2 protein. In binding assays the protein expressed from the previously described mutation, Met53Ile, did not bind to CDK4/CDK6, confirming its role as a causal mutation in the development of melanoma. Ala118Thr appeared to be functional in this assay. Arg24Pro appeared to bind to CDK6, but not to CDK4. No mutations were detected in exon 2 of CDK4, suggesting that causal mutations in this gene are uncommon.

Patients with stable or responding disease were maintained on treatment until tumor resolution or progression. Systemic toxicity was infrequent, dose-related, and limited to mild flu-like symptoms that resolved within 24 hours. Local inflammation, at times with pustule formation, was consistently seen with doses of > or =10(7) PFU/lesion. Chronically treated lesions showed a dense infiltration, with CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, histiocytes, and eosinophils. All seven patients developed an antivaccinia humoral immune response 14-21 days following revaccination. Despite the presence of these antivaccinia antibodies, the reporter gene was expressed, as judged by the development of anti-beta-galactosidase antibodies in all patients. Passenger cytokine gene function was evidenced by the presence of virally encoded GM-CSF mRNA at injection sites both early (weeks 1 and 5) and late (week 31) in the course of treatment. Eosinophilia at treatment sites indicated that physiologically significant levels of functional cytokine were generated. However, there were no changes in the total number of peripheral white blood cells or in the numbers or percentages of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, monocytes, or eosinophils. GM-CSF was not detected in the sera. The two patients with the largest tumor burdens failed to respond even at treatment sites. Three patients had mixed responses, with regression of treated and untreated dermal metastases and progression of disease elsewhere. One patient had a partial response, with regression of injected and uninjected regional dermal metastases. Residual melanoma was excised, rendering the patient disease free. One patient with only dermal metastases confined to the scalp achieved a complete remission. Sequential administration of escalating doses of a GM-CSF recombinant vaccinia virus is safe, effective at maintaining passenger gene function, and can induce tumor regression.",

Here we investigated the interaction of MSC with RIT as a possible mechanism for RIT efficacy.;Mice bearing A2058 melanoma xenografts were treated with either 1.5 mCi (188)Re-6D2 antibody, saline, unlabeled 6D2 antibody or (188)Re-labeled non-specific IgM.;On Day 28 post-treatment the tumor size in the RIT group was 4-times less than in controls (P<0.001). The tumors were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and FACS for two MSC markers--chemoresistance mediator ABCB5 and H3K4 demethylase JARID1B. There were no significant differences between RIT and control groups in percentage of ABCB5 or JARID1B-positive cells in the tumor population. Our results demonstrate that unlike chemotherapy, which kills tumor cells but leaves behind MSC leading to recurrence, RIT kills MSC at the same rate as the rest of tumor cells.;These results have two main implications for melanoma treatment and possibly other cancers. First, the susceptibility of ABCB5+ and JARID1B+cells to RIT in melanoma might be indicative of their susceptibility to antibody-targeted radiation in other cancers where they are present as well. Second, specifically targeting cancer stem cells with radiolabeled antibodies to ABCB5 or JARID1B might help to completely eradicate cancer stem cells in various cancers.",

Initially, 457 consecutive cases of nodular cutaneous melanoma (1981 to 2008) were included in this series. Tumor necrosis was assessed on hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections and was recorded as significant when an area of at least a quarter of a high-power field (×400; 0.07 mm) was occupied by necrotic cells and as sparse when clusters of at least 5 necrotic cells were observed. Tumor necrosis (26% of the cases) was associated with increased tumor thickness, high mitotic count, presence of tumor ulceration, and decreased survival. Stratified analyses (univariate and multivariate) with standard microscopic variables indicated the strongest prognostic influence of necrosis in tumors thicker than 4 mm. Notably, in the stratum of pT4 tumors, presence of necrosis was a stronger prognostic predictor than was ulceration. Tumor necrosis was a significant prognostic indicator providing additional information to established predictors of patient outcome in this series of nodular cutaneous melanoma, predominantly among thick tumors (>4 mm).

More recently, the combination of BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib with MEK inhibitor trametinib has shown improved progression-free survival, compared to dabrafenib monotherapy, in a Phase II study and has received approval by the US Food and Drug Administration. However, even when treated with the combination, most patients develop mechanisms of acquired resistance, and some of them do not achieve tumor regression at all, because of intrinsic resistance to therapy. Along with the development of BRAF inhibitors, immunotherapy made an important step forward: ipilimumab, an anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody, was approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma; anti-PD-1 agents achieved promising results in Phase I/II trials, and data from Phase III studies will be ready soon. The availability of such drugs, which are effective regardless of BRAF status, has made the therapeutic approach more complex, as first-line treatment with BRAF inhibitors may not be the best choice for all BRAF-mutated patients. The aim of this paper is to review the systemic therapeutic options available today for patients affected by BRAF V600-mutated metastatic melanoma, as well as to summarize the mechanisms of resistance to BRAF inhibitors and discuss the possible strategies to overcome them. Moreover, since the molecular analysis of tumor specimens is now a pivotal and decisional factor in the treatment strategy of metastatic melanoma patients, the advances in the molecular detection techniques for the BRAF V600 mutation will be reported.

In this study, we evaluated 2 new melanoma markers, monoclonal antibodies KBA62 and PNL2 to yet unidentified antigens, using a large panel of metastatic melanomas (n=214), desmoplastic melanomas (n=34), gastrointestinal mucosal melanomas (n=54), benign nevi (n=27), clear cell sarcomas (n=16), and nonmelanocytic tumors (n=1218). Immunoreactivity for KBA62 and PNL2 was found in all pigmented nevi and in 86% and 90% of metastatic melanomas, respectively. Mucosal melanomas showed a similar rate of PNL2 immunoreactivity but somewhat less frequent KBA62 positivity (72%). In addition, KBA62 was found to be a sensitive diagnostic marker for desmoplastic melanoma (28 of 34; 82%), whereas PNL2 was only rarely positive (2 of 34; 6%). KBA62-positive normal tissues included pericytes, vascular and parenchymal smooth muscles, and basal cells of complex epithelia, including myoepithelia, whereas PNL2 labeled only melanocytes and neutrophils. Among nonmelanocytic tumors, those that were KBA62 positive were nodular fasciitis, leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, benign and malignant nerve sheath tumors, synovial sarcoma, and subsets of various carcinomas, especially those with squamous cell/stratified epithelial differentiation. PNL2 positivity in nonmelanocytic tumors was more restricted but occurred consistently in angiomyolipoma and other perivascular epitheloid cell tumor and in chronic myeloid leukemia tissue infiltrates. KBA62 may assist in the identification of desmoplastic melanomas, but its widespread occurrence in nonmelanomas limits utility. PNL2 is highly specific for melanomas but lacks reactivity with desmoplastic melanomas. It is also an excellent supplementary marker for perivascular epitheloid cell tumor at various sites.",

Nine patients had on-treatment and/or progression samples available.;All baseline patient samples had BRAF(V600E/K) confirmed.

We analysed 15 Italian melanoma families for germ line mutations in the coding region of the CDKN2A gene and exon 2 of the CDK4 gene. One novel disease-associated mutation (P48T), 3 known pathological mutations (R24P, G101W and N71S) and 2 common polymorphisms (A148T and Nt500 G>C) were identified in the CDKN2A gene. In a family harbouring the R24P mutation, an intronic variant (IVS1, +37 G>C) of uncertain significance was detected in a non-carrier melanoma case. The overall incidence of CDKN2A mutations was 33.3%, but this percentage was higher in families with 3 or more melanoma cases (50%) than in those with only 2 affected relatives (25%). Noteworthy, functional analysis established that the novel mutated protein, while being impaired in cell growth and inhibition assays, retains some in vitro binding to CDK4/6. No variant in the p16-binding region of CDK4 was identified in our families. Our results, obtained in a heterogeneous group of families, support the view that inactivating mutations of CDKN2A contribute to melanoma susceptibility more than activating mutations of CDK4 and that other genetic factors must be responsible for melanoma clustering in a high proportion of families. In addition, they indicate the need for a combination of functional assays to determine the pathogenetic nature of new CDKN2A mutations.",

Dilution experiments confirmed that the method was sensitive and capable of detecting mutations at this codon when only 4% of the total alleles are mutated. We were surprised to find no mutations in the 40 basal cell carcinomas, 12 squamous cell carcinomas and 12 cases of Bowen's disease studied.

All samples screened for BRAF and NRAS mutations during the year 2014 were analyzed by IHC and pyrosequencing, with an independent analysis of the 2 methods. Cases with first-line discordant results benefited from a complementary second-round IHC and next-generation sequencing (NGS) with a final interpretation taking into account the results of pyrosequencing, IHC, NGS, and quantification of the tumor cells. We analyzed 111 consecutive formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded melanoma samples from 101 patients. Twenty-two and 11 samples were concordant for BRAFV600E and NRASQ61R mutations, respectively. Second-round analyses of 9 discordant and 1 molecularly inconclusive samples allowed conclusion in 4 further mutated samples (2 BRAFV600E and 2 NRASQ61R). A sample remained NRASQ61R IHC negative but NRASQ61R mutated with molecular methods. Overall, BRAFV600 and NRASQ61 mutation frequencies were 31.7% and 30.7%, respectively. When compared to molecular results, the sensitivity and specificity of IHC were 100% for BRAFV600E IHC and 92.3% and 98.9% for NRASQ61R IHC, respectively.

In this review, we present the development and characterization of a large panel of UM patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Based on molecular features as identified in patient tumors, i.e. histopathological classification, specific gene mutations, as well as genomic and gene expression profiles, we show that PDXs closely resemble many important genetic and histological aspects of human UM with a remarkable stability over the course of their in vivo maintenance. Our techniques for establishing and maintaining primary UMs as xenograft tumors in immunodeficient mice provide a high degree of genetic conservation between the primary tumor and its xenograft over multiple in vivo passages. These models therefore represent a significant advance in the resources available for drug screening and studies of the pathogenesis of UM. ",

A possible relationship between the primo vascular system (PVS) and the melanoma metastasis has been proposed. In particular, the PVS may be involved in oxygen transport. Vasculogenic-like networks, similar to the PVS, have been found within melanoma tumors, but their functional relationship with the PVS and meridian structures are unclear. Herein, we report on the use of an electrochemical O(2) sensor to study oxygenation levels of melanoma tumors in mice. We consistently found higher tissue oxygenation in specific sites of tumors (n=5). These sites were strongly associated with vascular structures or the PVS. Furthermore, the PVS on the tumor surface was associated with adipose tissue. Our findings suggest that the PVS is involved in the regulation of metastasis.",

The importance of RAS signaling as a potential target in cancer is emphasized not only by the prevalence of RAS mutations, but also by the high number of RAS activators and effectors identified in mammalian cells that places the RAS proteins at the crossroads of several, important signaling networks. Ras proteins are crucial crossroads of signaling pathways that link the activation of cell surface receptors with a wide variety of cellular processes leading to the control of proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. Furthermore, oncogenic ras proteins interfere with metabolism of tumor cells, microenvironment's remodeling, evasion of the immune response, and finally contributes to the metastatic process. After 40 years of basic, translational and clinical research, much is now known about the molecular mechanisms by which these monomeric guanosine triphosphatase-binding proteins promote cellular malignancy, and it is clear that they regulate signaling pathways involved in the control of cell proliferation, survival, and invasiveness. In this review we summarize the biological role of RAS in cancer by focusing our attention on the biological rational and strategies to target RAS in melanoma. ",

In this report, we evaluated the anti-melanoma cell activity by a novel small-molecular AMPK activator, GSK621. Treatment of GSK621 decreased survival and proliferation of human melanoma cells (A375, WM-115 and SK-Mel-2 lines), which was accompanied by activation of caspase-3/-9 and apoptosis. Reversely, caspase inhibitors attenuated GSK621-induced cytotoxicity against melanoma cells. Significantly, GSK621 was more potent than other AMPK activators (A769662, Compound 13 and AICAR) in inhibiting melanoma cells. Intriguingly, same GSK621 treatment was non-cytotoxic or pro-apoptotic against human melanocytes. Molecularly, we showed that activation of AMPK mediated GSK621's activity against melanoma cells. AMPKα1 shRNA knockdown or dominant negative mutation (T172A) dramatically attenuated GSK621-induced melanoma cell lethality. Further studies revealed that MEK-ERK activation might be the primary resistance factor of GSK621. MEK-ERK inhibition, either genetically or pharmacologically, significantly sensitized melanoma cells to GSK-621. Remarkably, intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of GSK621 inhibited A375 tumor growth in SCID mice. Co-administration of MEK-ERK inhibitor MEK162 further sensitized GSK621-induced anti-A375 tumor activity in vivo. Together, the results imply that targeted activation of AMPK by GSK621 inhibits melanoma cell survival and proliferation. MEK-ERK inhibition may further sensitize GSK621's anti-melanoma cell activity in vitro and in vivo.",

Here we report in vivo evidence supporting a critical role for MC1R in regulating melanoma tumor growth and determining overall survival time. Inhibition of MC1R by its physiologically relevant competitive inhibitor, agouti signaling protein (ASIP), reduced melanin synthesis and morphological heterogeneity in murine B16-F10 melanoma cells. In the lungs of syngeneic C57BL/6 mice, mCherry-marked, ASIP-secreting lung tumors inhibited MC1R on neighboring tumors lacking ASIP in a dose dependent manner as evidenced by a proportional loss of pigment in tumors from mice injected with 1:1, 3:1 and 4:1 mixtures of parental B16-F10 to ASIP-expressing tumor cells. ASIP-expressing B16-F10 cells formed poorly pigmented tumors in vivo that correlated with a 20% longer median survival than those bearing parental B16-F10 tumors (p=0.0005). Mice injected with 1:1 mixtures also showed survival benefit (p=0.0054), whereas injection of a 4:1 mixture showed no significant difference in survival. The longer survival time of mice bearing ASIP-expressing tumors correlated with a significantly slower growth rate than parental B16-F10 tumors as judged by quantification of numbers of tumors and total tumor load (p=0.0325), as well as a more homogeneous size and morphology of ASIP-expressing lung tumors. We conclude that MC1R plays an important role in regulating melanoma growth and morphology. Persistent inhibition of MC1R provided a significant survival advantage resulting in part from slower tumor growth, establishing MC1R as a compelling new molecular target for metastatic melanoma. ",

Resistance to its inhibitory effects is characteristic of human melanoma, the growth of which may instead be promoted by TGF-beta, because its production is increased with melanoma progression. Whether TGF-beta has an autocrine function for melanoma cells or is important for paracrine stimulation of the tumor stroma is not known. In this study, TGF-beta1 was expressed in melanoma cells via adenoviral gene transfer, and tumor growth was analyzed in vitro, in human skin grafts, and in mixtures with fibroblasts that were injected s.c. into immunodeficient mice. The TGF-beta1 produced by the melanoma cells activated the fibroblasts to produce matrix within and around the tumor mass, whereas control tumors showed less stroma and more cell death. High expression of collagen, fibronectin, tenascin, and alpha2 integrin was detected in the TGF-beta1-expressing tumors by immunohistochemistry. Number and size of lung metastases were significantly increased. cDNA expression array analysis of TGF-beta1-transduced fibroblasts embedded in type I collagen and of TGF-beta1-transduced melanoma cells demonstrated induction of types XV, XVIII, and VI collagens, tenascin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-I, vascular endothelial growth factor, cysteine-rich fibroblast growth factor receptor-1, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta, which could be linked to promotion of growth and survival in melanoma.

Preclinical data have recently emerged, suggesting that the following subsets of patients have a lower frequency of BRAF mutations: acral, mucosal and cutaneous melanomas with chronic sun-induced damage. These lesions have a higher frequency of KIT mutations. However, cutaneous melanomas without chronic sun damage have a higher frequency of BRAF mutations and are not noted to have KIT mutations. It is possible that the appropriate subset of patients may respond differently to available targeted therapies and clinical trials are in development to assess the utility of KIT inhibition in these patients.",

Here, we catalog frequent genetic alterations observed in human melanomas and describe mouse models of melanoma initiation and progression, including our recent study that investigated the genetic interactions of RAS activation and PTEN loss in a CDKN2A (INK4a/ARF) null melanoma prone genetic background. We showed that loss of PTEN cooperates with HRAS activation, leading to increased development of melanoma and emergence of metastasis. Moreover, we observed that RNA i-mediated PTEN inactivation in RAS-driven melanomas enhanced migration and invasion with concomitant downregulation of E-cadherin, the major regulator of epithelial and mesenchymal transition, and enhanced AKT2 phosphorylation, which has been previously linked to invasion and metastasis of several cancer types, including breast and ovary.

Documented elevated serum levels of VEGF were associated with a lethal hepatic syndrome characterized by massive sinusoidal dilation and endothelial cell proliferation and apoptosis. Systemic levels of VEGF correlated with the severity of liver pathology and overall clinical compromise. A striking reversal of VEGF-induced liver pathology and prolonged survival were achieved by surgical excision of VEGF-secreting tumor or by systemic administration of a potent VEGF antagonist (VEGF-TRAP(R1R2)), thus defining a paraneoplastic syndrome caused by excessive VEGF activity.

Bioluminescence imaging systems rely on a bioluminescent signal from tumor cells, typically generated from expression of the firefly luciferase gene. However, previous reports have suggested that either a high level of luciferase or the resultant light reaction produced upon addition of D-luciferin substrate can have a negative influence on tumor cell growth. To address this issue, we designed an expression vector that allows simultaneous fluorescence and luminescence imaging. Using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), we generated clonal cell populations from a human breast cancer (MCF-7) and a mouse melanoma (B16-F10) cell line that stably expressed different levels of luciferase. We then compared the growth capabilities of these clones in vitro by MTT proliferation assay and in vivo by bioluminescence imaging of tumor growth in live mice. Surprisingly, we found that neither the amount of luciferase nor biophotonic activity was sufficient to inhibit tumor cell growth, in vitro or in vivo. These results suggest that luciferase toxicity is not a necessary consideration when designing bioluminescence experiments, and therefore our approach can be used to rapidly generate high levels of luciferase expression for sensitive imaging experiments.",

In Wv/Wv-RET (304/B6)-transgenic mice, in which c-Kit function was severely impaired, development of melanoma was strongly suppressed. Although 31 of the 44 original RET-transgenic mice died of rapidly growing melanoma within 12 months after birth, only 8 of the 44 Wv/Wv-RET-transgenic mice developed slowly growing melanocytic tumors with a greatly prolonged mean tumor-free period, 2 of which died of melanoma at a late stage.

Melanin production in the skin of these mice was not strongly impaired, suggesting that c-Kit affects the development of melanomas in these mice with only minor effects in melanin production. c-Kit expression in skin soon after birth was promoted in RET-transgenic mice, and c-Kit was expressed at high levels at the benign but not malignant stage of the tumor. A single injection of anti-c-Kit antibody (ACK2) into RET-transgenic mice soon after birth caused a surprisingly long-lasting suppression of development of melanoma, greatly prolonging the tumor-free period, and none of the 28 ACK2-treated RET-transgenic mice died from tumors at 12 months of age.

Gene expression analysis revealed the induction of interferon- and cell death-related genes that were associated with responsiveness of melanoma cell lines to BI-69A11. Strikingly, the administration of BI-69A11 inhibited melanoma development in genetically modified mice bearing an inducible form of activated Nras and a deletion of the Ink4a gene (Nras((Q61K)) ::Ink4a(-/-) ). Biweekly administration of BI-69A11 starting at 10 weeks or as late as 24 weeks after the induction of mutant Nras expression inhibited melanoma development (100 and 36%, respectively).

Identification of patients at high risk of metastases may provide indication for a frequent follow-up for early detection of metastases and treatment. The analysis of the gene expression profiles of primary human uveal melanomas showed high expression of SDCBP gene (encoding for syndecan-binding protein-1 or mda-9/syntenin), which appeared higher in patients with recurrence, whereas expression of syndecans was lower and unrelated to progression. Moreover, we found that high expression of SDCBP gene was related to metastatic progression in two additional independent datasets of uveal melanoma patients. More importantly, immunohistochemistry showed that high expression of mda-9/syntenin protein in primary tumors was significantly related to metastatic recurrence in our cohort of patients. Mda-9/syntenin expression was confirmed by RT-PCR, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry in cultured uveal melanoma cells or primary tumors. Interestingly, mda-9/syntenin showed both cytoplasmic and nuclear localization in cell lines and in a fraction of patients, suggesting its possible involvement in nuclear functions. A pseudo-metastatic model of uveal melanoma to the liver was developed in NOD/SCID/IL2Rγ null mice and the study of mda-9/syntenin expression in primary and metastatic lesions revealed higher mda-9/syntenin in metastases. The inhibition of SDCBP expression by siRNA impaired the ability of uveal melanoma cells to migrate in a wound-healing assay. Moreover, silencing of SDCBP in mda-9/syntenin-high uveal melanoma cells inhibited the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-triggered invasion of matrigel membranes and inhibited the activation of FAK, AKT and Src. Conversely syntenin overexpression in mda-9/syntenin-low uveal melanoma cells mediated opposite effects.

We find that melanocytes depleted of MEN1 are deficient in homologous recombination (HR)-directed DNA repair, which is accompanied by increased nonhomologous end-joining activity. Following DNA damage, MEN1 levels increase as a result of phosphorylation by the DNA damage kinase ATM/ATR. Most importantly, we show that MEN1 functions by directly stimulating the transcription of several genes, including BRCA1, RAD51, and RAD51AP1, that encode proteins involved in HR. MEN1 and its coactivator, the mixed-lineage leukemia histone methyltransferase, are recruited to the BRCA1, RAD51, and RAD51AP1 promoters by estrogen receptor 1, resulting in increased histone H3-lysine 4 trimethylation and transcription.

The purpose of this study was to determine the prognostic impact of patterns of vascularity on the outcome associated with cutaneous melanoma.;Tumor vascularity was documented prospectively using routine histopathologic analysis of 417 primary cutaneous melanomas from the University of California at San Francisco Melanoma Center database. Four patterns of tumor vascularity were recorded: absent, sparse, moderate, and prominent.;Increasing tumor vascularity significantly increased the risk of relapse and death associated with melanoma, corresponding to reduced relapse-free and overall survival. By multivariate analysis, tumor vascularity was the most important determinant of overall survival, surpassing tumor thickness. Increasing tumor vascularity was associated with increased incidence of ulceration in the primary tumor.;Tumor vascularity is an important prognostic factor in melanoma, rivaling tumor thickness. Increasing tumor vascularity is highly correlated with ulceration, possibly helping to explain the biologic basis of this known prognostic factor.",

The significance of the results from animal experiments depends on the selection of the proper model. Many attempts have been made to create appropriate animal models for uveal melanoma and its characteristic metastatic behavior. One approach is to use transgenic animal models or to implant tumor cells. A variety of tumor types have been used for this purpose: tumor cells, such as Greene melanoma, murine B16 melanoma, and human uveal melanoma cells, may be implanted in the eyes of hamsters, rats, rabbits, and mice, among others. Various inoculation routes, including into the anterior chamber and posterior compartment, and retro-orbitally, have been applied to obtain tumor growth mimicking ocular uveal melanoma. However, when we choose animal models, we must be conscious of many disadvantages, such as variable tumor growth, or the need for immunosuppression in xenogeneic grafts.

Primary prevention of melanoma consists in avoiding excessive exposure to ultraviolet rays,'which represent the main risk factor for the disease occurrence. Secondary prevention is a synonym of melanoma early diagnosis and can be obtained by means of two methods : patients' self-examination and medical examination. Both these examinations must be routinely and thoroughly performed, must be based on the ABCDE rule and the ugly duckling sign, and ideally must be aided by the use of total-body photography. Current international guidelines suggest that all cutaneous screenings should be performed using dermoscopy, a non-invasive imaging technique that allows improving considerably the diagnostic performance. More sophisticated imaging techniques, such as confocal microscopy, are also available in specialised centres.

Familial UM (FUM), defined as two or more family members diagnosed with UM, is rare and estimated at less than 1% of all UM. Currently, BAP1 is the only gene known to contribute significant risk for UM. In this study we aimed to estimate the frequency of BAP1 mutation in FUM and to characterize the family and personal histories of other cancers in these families. We identified 32 families with FUM, including seven families previously reported by our group. BAP1 mutation testing was carried out by direct sequencing of the coding exons and the adjacent untranslated regions of the gene. Germline deletion and duplication analysis of BAP1 was assessed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Germline BAP1 mutations were found in 6/32 (19%) families. No deletions or duplications were identified in any of the 24 samples tested by MLPA. Combined with published studies, the frequency of BAP1 mutations was 14/64 (22%) in FUM. FUM families without BAP1 mutations have distinct family histories with high rates of prostate cancer in first- and second-degree relatives. It is likely that additional genes conferring risk for FUM exist. It is important to understand key shared features of FUM to focus future research on identifying these additional tumor predisposition syndromes. Though BAP1 should be tested first in these families, FUM families without BAP1 mutation should be explored for additional predisposition genes. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Evaluation of 19 malignant melanomas showed that tumors of a thickness of more than 0.6 mm can be seen sonographically. Malignant melanomas are revealed as nodules with very sparse internal echoes and sharp delineation, situated in the upper cutis. Infiltration of the subcutis can be shown reliably. The sonographically measured values of maximal tumor thickness show a good correlation with those determined postoperatively by histometry (r = 0.95). Regional metastases of melanomas and recurrencies are also revealed as sharply limited lesions with very few internal echoes. They can readily be separated from benign regressive nodules. Out of 237 examinations, the 181 evaluated ones showed a sonography sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 99%. Therefore, an earlier diagnosis of regional metastases and recurrencies, as well as more precise indication for second operations during melanoma tumor follow-up can be made, and, in future, the decision for primary regional lymphonodectomy may be influenced.

At present, disseminated, macrometastatic melanoma is incurable in the majority of cases. Single agent chemotherapy has modest effects and results in disease remission in a minority of patients, usually of short duration, Combination chemotherapy, or the combination of chemotherapeutic drugs and cytokines, results in increased response rates and occasionally remissions of prolonged duration. So far, no regimen has demonstrated improved survival compared to single agent therapy in disseminated melanoma. New insights into the mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs may lead to development of predictive tests that can identify individuals with tumors sensitive to a specific agent, as well as to the development of strategies to circumvent drug resistance. It has recently been shown that adjuvant therapy of high-risk melanoma with large doses of interferon-alpha 2b significantly prolongs relapse-free and overall survival, at the price of considerable toxicity. Ongoing studies aim to define the optimum dose and duration of adjuvant interferon therapy.

With regard to genetic factors, the discovery of two types of genes was a great advance in further understanding the biology of the melanocyte. CDKN2A (p16) is the prototype of the high-penetrance, low-prevalence gene related to melanoma. This gene has been studied in some families in which several members have been diagnosed with melanoma. In the general population with non-familial melanoma, low-penetrance, high-prevalence genes such as MC1R seem to be more interesting. Studies on the MC1R gene have not only shown its importance in skin and hair pigmentation, but also in the development of melanoma. Functional studies on CDKN2A and MC1R have led us to new and important conclusions. The analysis of data from studies on families, twins and control cases, with the collaboration of several countries, will lead us to new discoveries.

This goal is best facilitated by understanding both an individual's inherited genetic variation and the somatic genetic changes arising during cancer development. Clinical decision making based on inherited genetic variation is done for those patients with cancer susceptibility syndromes and more generally to personalize drug dosing. Personalized medicine based on genetic and genomic changes within tumors is being applied more widely, with increased use of therapies targeted to somatic mutations and amplifications. Somatic mutations associated with resistance also are being used to select against therapies. Somatic point mutation testing being used clinically includes direct sequencing, short sequencing and single nucleotide interrogation. Single amplifications are commonly assessed using FISH or CISH; high throughput assessment of amplifications and deletions is done mainly on a research basis. Melanomas contain complex mutational profiles that allow them to be sub-grouped by their genetic and genomic profile, each of which then can be evaluated pre-clinically to determine their response to targeted therapies. BRAF V600E mutations are the most common found in melanoma; specific inhibitors of mutant BRAF have been developed and are currently in clinical trials. In addition, other melanoma sub-groups have been identified genetically, which respond to other inhibitors. These studies focus on somatic genetic changes in cancer, which can be targeted directly by therapies.

In vitro cell proliferation assays using the sulforhodamine B assay were conducted to determine TAK-733 potency and melanoma responsiveness. In vivo murine modeling with eleven patient-derived melanoma explants evaluated daily dosing of TAK-733 at 25 or 10 mg/kg. Immunoblotting was performed to evaluate on-target activity and downstream inhibition by TAK-733 in both in vitro and in vivo studies. TAK-733 demonstrated broad activity in most melanoma cell lines with relative resistance observed at IC50 > 0.1 μmol/L in vitro. TAK-733 also exhibited activity in 10 out of 11 patient-derived explants with tumor growth inhibition ranging from 0% to 100% (P < 0.001-0.03). Interestingly, BRAF(V600E) and NRAS mutational status did not correlate with responsiveness to TAK-733. Pharmacodynamically, pERK was suppressed in sensitive cell lines and tumor explants, confirming TAK-733-mediated inhibition of MEK1/2, although the demonstration of similar effects in the relatively resistant cell lines and tumor explants suggests that escape pathways are contributing to melanoma survival and proliferation. These data demonstrate that TAK-733 exhibits robust tumor growth inhibition and regression against human melanoma cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models, suggesting that further clinical development in melanoma is of scientific interest. Particularly interesting is the activity in BRAF wild-type models, where current approved therapy such as vemurafenib has been reported not to be active.",

GLI2 expression was reduced in a GLI2high cell line with lentiviral expression of short hairpin RNA targeting GLI2. We assessed the role of GLI2 in melanoma cell invasiveness in Matrigel assays. We measured secretion of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 by gelatin zymography and expression of E-cadherin by western blotting and RT-PCR. The role of GLI2 in development of bone metastases was determined following intracardiac injection of melanoma cells in immunocompromised mice (n = 5-13).

However, it is now clear that melanoma is not a single entity, but can be molecularly divided into subtypes that generally correspond to the anatomical location of the primary melanoma. Melanomas from acral lentiginous, mucosal, and chronic sun-damaged sites frequently harbor activating mutations and/or increased copy number in the KIT tyrosine kinase receptor gene, which are very rare in the more common cutaneous tumors. Multiple case reports and early observations from clinical trials suggest that targeting mutant KIT with tyrosine kinase inhibitors is efficacious in KIT mutant melanoma. This review recounts what is known about the role of KIT in melanocyte maturation, our current understanding of KIT genetic aberrations in melanoma, and how this knowledge is being translated into clinical oncology.",

BRAFV600E has been implicated in different mechanisms underlying melanomagenesis, most of which due to the deregulated activation of the downstream MEK/ERK effectors. The first selective inhibitor of mutant BRAF, vemurafenib, after highly encouraging results of the phase I and II trial, was compared to dacarbazine in a phase III trial in treatment-naïve patients (BRIM-3). The study results showed a relative reduction of 63 % in risk of death and 74 % in risk of tumor progression. Considering all trials so far completed, median overall survival reached approximately 16 months for vemurafenib compared to less than 10 months for dacarbazine treatment. Vemurafenib has been extensively tested on melanoma patients expressing the BRAFV600E mutated form; it has been demonstrated to be also effective in inhibiting melanomas carrying the V600K mutation. In 2011, both FDA and EMA therefore approved vemurafenib for metastatic melanoma carrying BRAFV600 mutations. Some findings suggest that continuation of vemurafenib treatment is potentially beneficial after local therapy in a subset of patients with disease progression (PD). Among who continued vemurafenib >30 days after local therapy of PD lesion(s), a median overall survival was not reached, with a median follow-up of 15.5 months from initiation of BRAF inhibitor therapy. For patients who did not continue treatment, median overall survival from the time of disease progression was 1.4 months. A clinical phase I/II trial is evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of vemurafenib in combination with the CTLA-4 inhibitor mAb ipilimumab. In the BRIM-7 trial vemurafenib is tested in association with GDC-0973, a potent and highly selective inhibitor of MEK1/2. Preliminary data seem to indicate that an additional inhibitor of mutated BRAF, GSK2118436, might be also active on a wider range of BRAF mutations (V600E-K-D-R); actually, treatment with such a compound is under evaluation in a phase III study among stage III-IV melanoma patients positive for BRAF mutations. Overall, BRAF inhibitors were well tolerated; common adverse events are arthralgia, rash, fatigue, alopecia, keratoacanthoma or cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma, photosensitivity, nausea, and diarrhea, with some variants between different inhibitors.",

Germline mutations in this gene have been identified in about 20% of melanoma-prone families that have been studied to date. Pancreatic cancer occurs excessively in melanoma families with germline mutations in CDKN2A. Germline mutations in the cyclin-dependent kinase gene CDK4 (chromosome 12q14) have been described in three melanoma families. This finding represents a third melanoma gene but one that accounts for only a tiny fraction of all hereditary melanoma. Recently, a familial melanoma-astrocytoma syndrome has been reported. Large germline deletions of 9p21 occur in these families, with the p19 gene implicated in its pathogenesis. At present, clinical predictive genetic testing for mutations in the CDKN2A gene is available commercially, but its use has been limited by uncertainty as to how test results would affect the management of melanoma-prone family members. Currently, management recommendations include monthly skin self-examination, clinical skin examination once or twice yearly, a low threshold for simple excision of changing pigmented lesions, moderation of sun exposure, and appropriate use of sunscreens. A heritable determinant for total nevus number has been suggested by twin studies. Other data suggest the presence of a major gene responsible for \"total nevus density\" in melanoma-prone families. Approximately 55% of the mole phenotype in multiplex melanoma families was explained by this proposed gene. An autosomal dominant mode of inheritance has been proposed for DN, and data exist to suggest that DN may be a pleiotropic manifestation of the 1p36 familial melanoma gene. However, there clearly are melanoma-prone families that do not express the dysplastic nevus trait, and some of the families linked to CDKN2A also present with dysplastic nevi. Several studies have shown a surprisingly high prevalence of DN on the skin of family members of probands with DN. In light of the extensive evidence documenting that persons with DN (both sporadic and familial) have an increased prospective risk of melanoma, these family studies suggest that relatives of persons with DN should be examined for both DN and melanoma. Genetic determinants play a major role in the pathogenesis of normal nevi, DN, and melanoma. Identifying the molecular basis of these genetic events promises to enhance melanoma risk-reduction strategies and, ultimately, reduce melanoma-associated mortality.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular tumour in Caucasians. There are approximately 500 new cases of uveal melanoma in Germany per year and the incidence rate peaks at the age of 70 years. Half of all uveal melanoma patients develop metastatic disease, which can be observed even many years after successful treatment of the primary tumour. In most cases the liver is the location of first manifestation. Based on the chromosome 3 status uveal melanomas can be divided into two major classes that differ in their metastatic potential. Tumours with a high risk to metastasise usually show monosomy 3, whereas tumours showing disomy 3 rarely metastasise. If a patient wishes to know about his individual risk, prognostic testing of the primary tumour tissue can be performed after obtaining tumour material via transscleral or transretinal biopsy, or by enucleation. To date results of prognostic testing do not influence therapeutic strategies. Recently, major key genes involved in uveal melanoma development, GNAQ, GNA11, BAP1, SF3B1 and EIF1AX, have been identified. Mutation profiling, in addition to chromosomal 3 analysis, will further refine the classification or subclassification of uveal melanomas and will hopefully influence diagnostic or therapeutic concepts. Hereditary mutations in tumour suppressor gene BAP1 are associated with an increased risk for different tumour entities. Detection of germ line mutations in this tumour suppressor gene should implicate further general screening examinations of the patient to be able to detect these tumour entities. Moreover relatives of these patients should be offered a screening for BAP1 mutation. ",

Here, we report on the expression of CD44v in melanocytes, nevi, primary melanomas, and cutaneous and lymph node metastases. Thirteen nevi, 65 primary melanomas of varying thickness, 39 cutaneous and 15 lymph node metastases, and melanocytes and a panel of melanoma lines were tested for surface expression of the standard form of CD44 and the variant exons v5, v6, v7, v7-v8, and v10 by immunohistology or fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Melanocytes did not express any variant isoform of CD44. However, nevi, as well as primary melanoma and melanoma metastases, stained to a varying degree with anti-CD44v5, anti-CD44v7-v8, and anti-CD44v10. Exons v6 and v7 were not detected on any of these tissue specimens. Compared with nevi, expression of exon v10 was up-regulated in thick primary tumors and skin metastases. Lymph node metastases displayed elevated levels of exon v5. Expression of CD44v in melanoma lines (n = 20) differed, inasmuch as many lines did not express variant isoforms; in particular, exon v10. Interestingly, however, the few CD44v5-positive melanoma lines metastasized in the nu/nu mouse. Because benign as well as malignant growth of melanocytes was accompanied by expression of CD44 variant isoforms, a linkage between expression of CD44 variant isoforms and malignant transformation or tumor progression was excluded. Considering the function of distinct isoforms, one might speculate that expression of exon CD44v5, which was up-regulated in lymph node metastases compared with nevi and primary melanoma, provided a growth stimulus. Exon v10 is present at high density in epidermal cells. The de novo expression of this exon in nevi and the increased expression in thick melanoma and skin metastases would be in line with the assumption of an anchoring advantage in the surrounding epidermal tissue.",

We evaluated alternative approaches for classifying this covariate when constructing predictive models of patient survival.;The analyses were based on a consecutive series of 1848 primary choroidal and/or ciliary body melanoma patients treated with proton beam irradiation (70 cobalt gray equivalent in 5 fractions) at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory, Boston, Mass, between July 1975 and December 1995. For each patient, the anatomic site of the tumor was classified according to an estimate of the proportion of the tumor base lying anterior to the ora serrata. Using proportional hazards regression, we estimated relative risk ratios and death rates from melanoma metastasis according to the extent of ciliary body involvement. All estimates were adjusted for other established prognostic factors.;Patients were followed up through April 30, 1998; none were lost to follow-up. Of 1848 patients analyzed, 378 died of melanoma metastasis. The median follow-up period among survivors was 9.5 years. Ciliary body origin (>50% of tumor base anterior to the ora serrata) was positively associated with tumor pigmentation (P<.001), tumor height (P<.001), and extrascleral extension of the tumor (P<.001). Compared with tumors involving only the choroid, melanoma-associated death rates increased with the proportion of the tumor base lying within the ciliary body (P =. 006); the multivariate-adjusted relative risk ratio for greater than 75% involvement was 2.30 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-4.23). The covariate-adjusted 5-year death rates for ciliary body origin and choroidal origin were 15.9% (95% CI, 11.3%-21.2%) and 9.8% (95% CI, 8.3%-11.7%), respectively.;Patients with melanomas of presumed ciliary body origin seem to be subject to a higher risk of death resulting from melanoma metastasis.

On the one hand, advances have been aimed at improving the effectiveness of melanoma vaccines based on a greater understanding of melanoma tumor cell biology. On the other hand, there is increasing evidence that the immune system, our defense against tumors, also inadvertently plays a supportive role in promoting the development and progression of tumors. Hence, two opposing forces 'hanging in the balance' dictate patients' responses to melanoma: tumor cell biology and the status of the immune system. Recent developments in our understanding of both of these aspects have provided new leads and insights for novel ways to improve vaccine design and add to the melanoma vaccine armory. As the focus of immunotherapy shifts its aim towards the tumor microenvironment, we are now developing the ability to program the immune responses raised by vaccination against melanoma. The aim here is to prevent myeloid and regulatory T-cell-mediated immune suppression as well as to counteract tumor-derived factors capable of suppressing immune responses. A redirected strategy for vaccine immunotherapy is proposed based on our greater understanding of tumor immunity. Using a combination therapy of immune-potentiating melanoma vaccines together with adjuvants for overcoming the immunosuppressive forces will allow us to activate protective immunity against melanoma. Other cancer vaccines (i.e. colon or renal) are already offering reasons for hope and expectation that vaccine immunotherapy will also produce successful outcomes for patients with melanoma.",

However, whether melanoma CTC are tumorigenic and cause metastatic progression is currently unknown. Here, we isolate for the first time viable tumorigenic melanoma CTC and demonstrate that this cell population is capable of metastasis formation in human-to-mouse xenotransplantation experiments. The presence of CTC among peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of murine recipients of subcutaneous (s.c.) human melanoma xenografts could be detected based on mRNA expression for human GAPDH and/or ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 5 (ABCB5), a marker of malignant melanoma-initiating cells previously shown to be associated with metastatic disease progression in human patients. ABCB5 expression could also be detected in PBMC preparations from human stage IV melanoma patients but not healthy controls. The detection of melanoma CTC in human-to-mouse s.c. tumor xenotransplantation models correlated significantly with pulmonary metastasis formation. Moreover, prospectively isolated CTC from murine recipients of s.c. melanoma xenografts were capable of primary tumor initiation and caused metastasis formation upon xenotransplantation to secondary murine NOD-scid IL2Rγ(null) recipients. Our results provide initial evidence that melanoma CTC are tumorigenic and demonstrate that CTC are capable of causing metastatic tumor progression.

        "Doc_abstract":"The incidence and mortality of malignant melanoma have been rising during the past decades, the latter being due to the high invasion capacity and the metastatic potential of melanoma cells to distant organs.;We investigated the distribution pattern of melanoma metastases taking into account different clinicopathological subtypes of melanoma.;We studied 310 stage IV (AJCC 2009) melanoma patients retrospectively with regard to potential correlations between frequency and occurrence of metastasis and the genetic background and pathological/clinical melanoma subtypes. For all patients, the time to distant metastasis (TTDM) and the distribution patterns of metastases were analyzed and correlated to the median survival time.;Superficially Spreading (SSM) and Nodular melanomas (NMM) spread to the brain more frequently than Acrolentiginous (ALM) and Mucosal (MM) melanomas (p = 0.0012). The preference to affect the skeleton was significantly higher for ALM and MM in comparison to SSM and NMM (p = 0.0049). Lentigo maligna (LMM) tumors showed a significantly lower metastatic spread to distant lymph nodes (p = 0.0159). BRAF mutant versus wildtype tumors showed no significant differences concerning localization of metastasis but patients with BRAF mutant tumors were significantly younger at primary diagnosis and had a significantly shorter stage IV survival (p = 0.0106).;This study shows a clear distinction of melanoma subtypes with regard to metastasizing preferences. Further knowledge about melanoma subtype specific characteristics, including molecular markers predictive of homing preferences, may help to understand and manage this heterogeneous disease in terms of prognosis and follow-up procedures.",
