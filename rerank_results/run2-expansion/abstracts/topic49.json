IDH1 R132 mutations were detected in 20 (8.6%) patients with AML. IDH2 mutations were found in 19 (8.2%, 17 R140 and two R172) patients. IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were mutually exclusive and were associated with normal karyotype AML, cytogenetic intermediate-risk group, and NPM1 mutations. Five-year overall survival (OS) rates were significantly lower (15.6%) in patients harboring the IDH mutations than in patients lacking the IDH mutation (32.0%) in the entire cohort of AML (P = 0.005). Among patients aged 59 yr or younger with IDH mutations, 5-yr OS in patients who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) was significantly higher than that in those not receiving allogeneic SCT (50% vs. 10.6%, P = 0.020). Of 51 patients with NPM1 mutations, there was no significant difference in 5-yr OS rates between patients with and those without the IDH mutations. In contrast, among 175 patients lacking the NPM1 mutations, 5-yr OS rate in patients with IDH mutations was significantly lower than that in those without IDH mutations (0% vs. 34.7%, P = <0.001). These data suggest that IDH mutations have an unfavorable effect in AML, especially AML with the NPM1 wild type and younger AML patients with IDH mutations may benefit from allogeneic SCT. ",

Our aim is to assess whether IDH mutations were presented in Chinese patients with various hematological disorders. In this study, we screened the IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in a cohort of 456 Chinese patients with various hematological malignancies and disorders. We found three missense (p.R132C, p.R132G, and p.I99M; occurred in five patients) and one silent mutation (c.315C>T; occurred in two patients) in the IDH1 gene and two missense mutations (p.R140Q and p.R172K; occurred in four AML patients) and one silent mutation (c.435G>A) in the IDH2 gene. Except for one non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patient harboring IDH1 mutation p.R132C, all IDH1 and IDH2 missense mutations were observed in patients with AML. Intriguingly, the IDH2 mutation p.R140Q and novel IDH1 mutation p.I99M co-occurred in a 75-year-old patient with AML developed from myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The frequency of IDH1 and IDH2 missense mutations in Chinese AML patients reached 5.9% and 8.3%, respectively. Our results supported the recent findings that IDH gene mutations were common in AML.

Furthermore, expression of 2HG-producing IDH alleles in cells induced global DNA hypermethylation. In the AML cohort, IDH1/2 mutations were mutually exclusive with mutations in the α-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme TET2, and TET2 loss-of-function mutations were associated with similar epigenetic defects as IDH1/2 mutants. Consistent with these genetic and epigenetic data, expression of IDH mutants impaired TET2 catalytic function in cells.

We sought to exploit this glutamine addiction therapeutically in mutant IDH primary AML cells from patients by measuring cell growth after exposure to a small molecule glutaminase inhibitor, BPTES. We found that BPTES only suppressed the growth of AML cells expressing mutant IDH compared with those expressing wild type IDH.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Diagnostic bone marrow or blood samples from 358 patients were analyzed for IDH1 and IDH2 mutations by DNA polymerase chain reaction amplification/sequencing. FLT3, NPM1, CEBPA, WT1, and MLL mutational analyses and gene- and microRNA-expression profiling were performed centrally. Results IDH mutations were found in 33% of the patients. IDH1 mutations were detected in 49 patients (14%; 47 with R132). IDH2 mutations, previously unreported in AML, were detected in 69 patients (19%; 13 with R172 and 56 with R140). R172 IDH2 mutations were mutually exclusive with all other prognostic mutations analyzed. Younger age (< 60 years), molecular low-risk (NPM1-mutated/FLT3-internal tandem duplication-negative) IDH1-mutated patients had shorter disease-free survival than molecular low-risk IDH1/IDH2-wild-type (wt) patients (P = .046). R172 IDH2-mutated patients had lower complete remission rates than IDH1/IDH2wt patients (P = .007). Distinctive microarray gene- and microRNA-expression profiles accurately predicted R172 IDH2 mutations. The highest expressed gene and microRNAs in R172 IDH2-mutated patients compared with the IDH1/IDH2wt patients were APP (previously associated with complex karyotype AML) and miR-1 and miR-133 (involved in embryonal stem-cell differentiation), respectively. CONCLUSION IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are recurrent in CN-AML and have an unfavorable impact on outcome. The R172 IDH2 mutations, previously unreported in AML, characterize a novel subset of CN-AML patients lacking other prognostic mutations and associate with unique gene- and microRNA-expression profiles that may lead to the discovery of novel, therapeutically targetable leukemogenic mechanisms.",

The identified IDH1 mutations occurred in codon 132 resulting in replacement of arginine with either cysteine (N=3) or histidine (N=1). By contrast, mutations in IDH2 did not affect the homologous residue but instead altered codon 140, resulting in replacement of arginine with either glutamine (N=4) or tryptophan (N=1). Structural modeling of IDH2 suggested that codon 140 mutations disrupt the enzyme's ability to bind its substrate isocitrate. Accordingly, recombinant IDH2 R140Q/W were unable to carry out the decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), but instead gained the neomorphic activity to reduce α-KG to R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarete (2-HG).

Of the 21 patients with IDH mutations, 4 (19%) were found to have single nucleotide variants in both IDH1 and IDH2. An additional patient included in the study was found to have two different IDH2 mutations. The mutations were typically present at different variant allelic frequencies, with one predominating over the other, consistent with the presence of multiple subclones in a single patient. In one case, the variant allelic frequencies in both IDH1 and IDH2 were equally low in the setting of a high percentage of blasts, suggesting that the IDH mutations were unlikely to be present in the founding clone. Given these data, we conclude that dual IDH1/2 mutations likely were previously underestimated, a finding that may carry important treatment implications. ",

However, the effect of R-2HG released by IDH-mutated AML cells on the bone marrow microenvironment is unclear. Here, we report that R-2HG induces IκB kinase-independent activation of NF-κB in bone marrow stromal cells. R-2HG acts via a reactive oxygen species/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent pathway to phosphorylate NF-κB on the Thr254 residue. This phosphorylation enhances the interaction of NF-κB and the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase PIN1 and increases the protein stability and transcriptional activity of NF-κB. As a consequence, R-2HG enhances NF-κB-dependent expression of cytokines including IL-6, IL-8 and complement 5a to stimulate proliferation of AML cells. In addition, R-2HG also upregulates vascular endothelial adhesion molecule 1 and CXCR4 in stromal cells to enhance the contact between AML and stromal cells and attenuates chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. More importantly, we validated the R-2HG-activated gene signature in the primary bone marrow stromal cells isolated from IDH-mutated AML patients. Collectively, our results suggest that AML cell-derived R-2HG may be helpful for the establishment of a supportive bone marrow stromal niche to promote AML progression via paracrine stimulation. ",

Here we provide an overview of the function of normal and mutated IDH, discuss the role of IDH mutations in tumorigenesis and progression and review the key clinical considerations when treating IDH-mutated tumors based on emerging clinical data from mutant IDH1/2 inhibitor trials. IDH1 and IDH2 mutations confer neomorphic activity in the mutant protein, resulting in the conversion of αKG to the oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). The subsequent accumulation of 2-HG results in epigenetic dysregulation via inhibition of αKG-dependent histone and DNA demethylases, and a block in cellular differentiation. There is growing preclinical and clinical evidence suggesting that IDHmutations are involved in neoplasia. Furthermore, preclinical studies assessing small molecule inhibitors of mutant IDH1/2 enzymes have provided proof of concept that this approach decreases intracellular 2-HG levels, reverses epigenetic dysregulation and induces cellular differentiation. Phase I studies of mutant IDH inhibitors are currently ongoing in patients with IDH-mutant hematologic and solid tumors, with early data in hematologic tumors suggesting a manageable safety profile as well as clinical benefit, with a mechanism of action based on differentiation of malignant cells. Inhibition of mutant IDH shows promise as a treatment approach in hematologic malignancies, with further development ongoing in solid tumors and glioma.

        "Doc_abstract":"Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is highly heterogeneous clonal hematological malignancy, having a high rate of progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). With the rapid development of molecular biological techniques, plenty of gene mutations were found to have close relationships with the transformation from MDS to AML. SRSF2 is a RNA splicing-related gene, which mutation may prompt a poor prognosis, and have a higher rate of progressing to AML. DNMT3A plays an important role in DNA methylation, its mutation often indicate a worse overall survival and a more rapid progression to AML. ASXL1 regulates the synthesis of histone, which frameshift mutations are molecular marks of an adverse outcome. IDH contains IDH1 and IDH2, which are related with the Krebs cycle. Patients with IDH1 mutation have a shorter overall survival and a higher risk of AML transformation than that of patients with wild-type IDH1, while IDH2 was a poor prognostic factor for overall survival in patients with lower-risk MDS. Another gene related with DNA methylation is TET2, which is the most frequently mutated gene in MDS known so far and it may act as tumor-suppressor gene, but the opinions on its impact on patients' outcomes are still controversial. Some studies show that its mutations relate to a shorter time to progression to AML. Because of the differentiations in patients' races, regions and clinical characteristics, the results of different studies are varied. In this review, the recent advances on these related genes are summarized. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Alterations to genes involved in cellular metabolism and epigenetic regulation are implicated in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies. Recurring mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes are detected in approximately 20% of adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 5% of adults with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). IDH proteins are homodimeric enzymes involved in diverse cellular processes, including adaptation to hypoxia, histone demethylation and DNA modification. The IDH2 protein is localized in the mitochondria and is a critical component of the tricarboxylic acid (also called the 'citric acid' or Krebs) cycle. Both IDH2 and IDH1 (localized in the cytoplasm) proteins catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). Mutant IDH enzymes have neomorphic activity and catalyze reduction of α-KG to the (R) enantiomer of 2-hydroxyglutarate, which is associated with DNA and histone hypermethylation, altered gene expression and blocked differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. The prognostic significance of mutant IDH (mIDH) is controversial but appears to be influenced by co-mutational status and the specific location of the mutation (IDH1-R132, IDH2-R140, IDH2-R172). Treatments specifically or indirectly targeted to mIDH are currently under clinical investigation; these therapies have been generally well tolerated and, when used as single agents, have shown promise for inducing responses in some mIDH patients when used as first-line treatment or in relapsed or refractory AML or MDS. Use of mIDH inhibitors in combination with drugs with non-overlapping mechanisms of action is especially promising, as such regimens may address the clonal heterogeneity and the multifactorial pathogenic processes involved in mIDH myeloid malignancies. Advances in mutational analysis have made testing more rapid and convenient, and less expensive; such testing should become part of routine diagnostic workup and repeated at relapse to identify patients who may benefit from treatments that target mIDH.Leukemia advance online publication, 11 November 2016; doi:10.1038/leu.2016.275.",

A total of 826 patients treated from 2010 to 2014 at a single institution were evaluated, including 167 patients (20%) with AML and IDH1 or IDH2 mutations. Median age was 62 years (range 18-92).

Remission rates (CR/CRi) by AML treatment status were: induction, 68%; Salvage-1 (S1), 42%; and Salvage-2 and beyond (S2+), 27%. No difference in response was identified by IDH mutation status. Similarly, overall survival (OS) was not dependent on IDH status within any cohort. The median OS was 15.4 months in induction, 8.7 months in S1, and 4.8 months in S2+. This analysis defines the clinical outcome associated with IDH-mutations in both the front-line and salvage AML treatment settings, and confirms that response rate and OS for both IDH-mutated and IDH wild-type AML patients is comparable.

DNA was available in 138 patients and mutation screening revealed 20 cases with JAK2, 6 with IDH, and 3 with MPL mutations; JAK2 and MPL mutations were seen mostly in MPN or \"MDS with isolated del(5q)\" whereas IDH mutations were frequent in other MDS variants. Overall median survival for the 143 patient cohort was 35 months and leukemic transformation (LT) was documented in 19 (~13%) cases. \"MDS with isolated del(5q)\" had the best prognosis with median survival of 66 months and LT rate of ~6%. Survival was poor among the other myeloid neoplasm subgroups regardless of specific morphologic diagnosis. Multivariable analysis identified higher leukocyte count and percentage of bone marrow and circulating blasts as independent predictors of shortened survival. The first two parameters and the presence of IDH mutations predicted inferior leukemia-free survival. The current study validates the prognostic relevance of considering \"MDS with isolated del(5q)\" as a separate WHO subcategory and identifies leukocytosis, higher blast count, and IDH mutations as being prognostically detrimental, in myeloid neoplasms associated with isolated del(5q).",

Mutational analysis was performed with polymerase chain reaction-based assay followed by direct sequencing. One hundred seventeen of 206 patients (56.8%) had at least one mutation: 51% class I, 13% class II, 6.8% class III, and 5.6% class IV. FLT3-internal tandem duplication was most frequent, and 29% of patients had more than one gene mutation. Two patients carried ASXL1 mutations, both with t(8;21), 2 had DNMT3A mutations, 2 had IDH1 mutations, 1 had IDH2 mutation, and 3 had TET2 mutations. Both patients with IDH1 mutations had AML-M0 subtype and MLL-partial tandem duplication. Cooperating mutations with mutated epigenetic regulators were observed in 8 of 10 patients.

These mutations inactivate wild-type enzymatic activity and convey neomorphic function to produce d-2-hydroxyglutarate (d-2HG), which accumulates at millimolar levels within tumors. d-2HG can impact α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase activity and subsequently affect various cellular functions in these cancers. Inhibitors of the neomorphic activity of mutant IDH1 and IDH2 are currently in Phase I/II clinical trials for both solid and blood tumors. As IDH1 and IDH2 represent key enzymes within the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, mutations have significant impact on intermediary metabolism. The loss of some wild-type metabolic activity is an important, potentially deleterious and therapeutically exploitable consequence of oncogenic IDH mutations and requires continued investigation in the future. Here we review how IDH1 and IDH2 mutations influence cellular metabolism, epigenetics, and other biochemical functions, discussing these changes in the context of current efforts to therapeutically target cancers bearing these mutations.

D-2HG is thought to act as a competitive inhibitor of α-KG-dependent dioxygenases that include prolyl hydroxylases and chromatin-modifying enzymes.

Mutant IDH enzyme loses its normal activity to convert isocitrate into α-ketoglutarate (αKG) and instead acquires the ability to reduce αKG to D-2-hydroxyglutarate. Through direct competition with αKG, accumulation of the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate in IDH mutated tumors results in inhibition of αKG-dependent dioxygenases involved in DNA and histone demethylation. Apart from epigenetic alterations, perturbations in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (depletion of intermediates) and activation of the intricately linked hypoxia signaling pathway are apparent in IDH mutated cells. As molecular details are being unraveled, the emerging concept is that IDH mutations result in tumor formation by epigenetic alterations that affect gene expression and result in inhibition of cellular differentiation. Activation of hypoxic stress signaling reprograms cellular energy metabolism and promotes anabolic processes and angiogenesis, thus, providing an advantage to promote neoplastic growth.",

The effects of mutations in IDH2 on cellular metabolism, the epigenetic state of mutated cells, and cellular differentiation have been elucidated in vitro and in vivo. Mutations in IDH2 lead to an enzymatic gain of function that catalyzes the conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to beta-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG).

Furthermore, U2AF1 mutations were specifically associated with trilineage morphologic dysplasia. Univariate analysis demonstrated that U2AF1 and TP53 mutations are associated with absence of clinical remission, poor overall survival (OS), and poor disease-free survival (DFS; P<0.0001), whereas TET2 and ASXL1 mutations are associated with poor OS (P<0.03).

Although genetic alterations are increasingly reported in AML, the gene mutations have not been comprehensively studied in AML-M0.

Twenty gene mutations including class I, class II, class III of epigenetic regulators (IDH1, IDH2, TET2, DNMT3A, MLL-PTD, ASXL1, and EZH2), and class IV (tumor suppressor genes) were analyzed in 67 patients with AML-M0. Mutational analysis was performed with polymerase chain reaction-based assays followed by direct sequencing. The most frequent gene mutations from our data were FLT3-ITD/FLT3-TKD (28.4%), followed by mutations in IDH1/IDH2 (28.8%), RUNX1 (23.9%), N-RAS/K-RAS (12.3%), TET2 (8.2%), DNMT3A (8.1%), MLL-PTD (7.8%), and ASXL1 (6.3%). Seventy-nine percent (53/67) of patients had at least one gene mutation. Class I genes (49.3%) were the most common mutated genes, which were mutually exclusive. Class III genes of epigenetic regulators were also frequent (43.9%). In multivariate analysis, old age [hazard ratio (HR) 1.029, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.013-1.044, P=.001) was the independent adverse factor for overall survival, and RUNX1 mutation (HR 2.326, 95% CI 0.978-5.533, P=.056) had a trend toward inferior survival. In conclusion, our study showed a high frequency of FLT3, RUNX1, and IDH mutations in AML-M0, suggesting that these mutations played a role in the pathogenesis and served as potential therapeutic targets in this rare and unfavorable subtype of AML.

Most notably, cytosolic IDH1 is mutated in 70-90% of low-grade gliomas and upgraded glioblastomas, and mitochondrial IDH2 is mutated in ~20% of acute myeloid leukemia cases. Wild-type IDH catalyzes the interconversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). Mutations in the enzyme lead to loss of wild-type enzymatic activity and a neomorphic activity that converts α-KG to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). In turn, 2-HG, which has been termed an \"oncometabolite,\" inhibits key α-KG-dependent enzymes, resulting in alterations of the cellular epigenetic profile and, subsequently, inhibition of differentiation and initiation of tumorigenesis. In addition, it is now clear that the IDH mutation also induces a broad metabolic reprograming that extends beyond 2-HG production, and this reprograming often differs from what has been previously reported in other cancer types. In this review, we will discuss in detail what is known to date about the metabolic reprograming of mutant IDH cells, and how this reprograming has been investigated using molecular metabolic imaging. We will describe how metabolic imaging has helped shed light on the basic biology of mutant IDH cells, and how this information can be leveraged to identify new therapeutic targets and to develop new clinically translatable imaging methods to detect and monitor mutant IDH tumors in vivo.

The genomic DNA was extracted from mononuclear cells (MNC) of bone marrow or peripheral blood in 205 adult AML patients, the exon 4 of IDH1 gene was amplified by PCR, then the sequencing and comparison were performed. The results showed that IDH1 mutation was detected in 9 (4.39%) of 205 AML patients. There were 6 cases of R132H mutation, 1 of R132L mutation, 1 of R132G mutation and 1 of R132S mutation. Significantly more IDH1 aberrations were detected in AML-M2 (P = 0.002) than other types. And the 9 patients with IDH1 mutation were characterized by low platelet count which was lower than patients with wild type IDH1 (P = 0.003). IDH1 mutation combined with FLT3/ITD mutation was found in 5 cases, c-kit mutation in 1, NPM1 mutation in 2, and IDH1 mutation with CEBPA or WT1 mutation was not found, which revealed a significant interaction between IDH1 mutation and the FLT3/ITD positive genotype or the CEBPA wild-type. IDH1 mutation were detected in 4 of 71 (5.63%) CN-AML. There was no significant difference of IDH1 mutation incidence between the normal and abnormal karyotypes. It is concluded that the rate of IDH1 mutation was 4.39% in Chinese AML patients. IDH1 mutation is significantly associated with AML-M2, lower platelet counts in peripheral blood, FLT3/ITD mutation and CEBPA wild-type, but not with age, white blood cell count in peripheral blood, karyotype, NPM1, c-kit or WT1 mutation.",

Aberrant serum 2-HG pattern was detected in the multicenter group of AML, with 62 of 367 (17%) patients having 2-HG levels above the cutoff value (2.01, log2-transformed from 4.03 μg/mL). IDH1/2 mutations occurred in 27 of 31 (87%) AML cases with very high 2-HG, but were observed only in 9 of 31 (29%) patients with moderately high 2-HG, suggesting other genetic or biochemical events may exist in causing 2-HG elevation. Indeed, glutamine-related metabolites exhibited a pattern in favor of 2-HG synthesis in the high 2-HG group. In AML patients with cytogenetically normal AML (n = 234), high 2-HG represented a negative prognostic factor in both overall survival and event-free survival. Univariate and multivariate analyses confirmed high serum 2-HG as a strong prognostic predictor independent of other clinical and molecular features. We also demonstrated distinct gene-expression/DNA methylation profiles in AML blasts with high 2-HG compared with those with normal ones, supporting a role that 2-HG plays in leukemogenesis. ",

Patients were also assessed for the presence of FLT3 (fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-3), NPM1 (nucleophosmin), CEBPA, WT1 (Wilms tumor 1), IDH1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 1) and IDH2 mutations. Thirty-eight mutations were detected in 36 patients (29%): 36 nucleotide substitutions, mostly affecting amino-acid residue R882 and two frameshift deletions. DNMT3A mutations were significantly associated with the French-American-British subtypes M4/M5 and the presence of NPM1 mutations. In the whole cohort, DNMT3A mutated patients had a shorter event-free survival (5-year EFS: 13% vs 32%, P = 0.02) and overall survival (5-year OS: 23% vs 45%, P = 0.02) compared with DNMT3A wild-type patients. In multivariate analysis including age, white blood cell count, NPM1/FLT3-internal tandem duplication/CEBPA risk group and DNMT3A mutational status, the presence of a DNMT3A mutation remained an independent adverse prognostic factor for EFS and OS, suggesting that testing for DNMT3A mutations could help further improve risk stratification in CN-AML.",

Somatic IDH mutations are often seen in gliomas and myeloid leukemia but have also been recently reported in a subset of other neoplasms. We analyzed a series of intestinal adenocarcinomas with (n=23) and without (n=39) associated chronic idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease treated at our institution for IDH1 and IDH2 mutations and correlated the clinicopathologic findings with mutation status. Compared with intestinal adenocarcinomas not associated with inflammatory bowel disease, adenocarcinomas associated with inflammatory bowel disease more frequently demonstrated IDH mutations (13% vs. 0%, P=0.047). All IDH mutations were identified in IDH1 and resulted in substitution of arginine by cysteine at position 132 (p.R132C, c.394C>T). IDH1 mutations were frequently (66%) associated with concurrent KRAS mutations (p.G12D, c.35G>A). IDH1-mutated intestinal adenocarcinomas were seen in the setting of both Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis and were located in both the ileum and colon. Compared with IDH1-negative inflammatory bowel disease-associated adenocarcinoma, IDH1-positive adenocarcinomas more frequently demonstrated tubuloglandular histology (100% vs. 25%, P=0.032) and were more frequently associated with precursor lesions exhibiting serrated morphology (66% vs. 6%, P=0.034). IDH1 mutations were also identified in the precursor dysplastic lesions associated with IDH1-positive adenocarcinomas. In conclusion, we demonstrate that IDH1 mutations are occasionally identified in inflammatory bowel disease-associated intestinal adenocarcinoma but not in intestinal adenocarcinoma not associated with inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, IDH1-mutated intestinal adenocarcinoma is associated with a characteristic low-grade tubuloglandular histology and often harbors concurrent KRAS mutations. Identification of patients with IDH1-mutated intestinal adenocarcinoma may become clinically important as new therapies emerge that target tumors that harbor IDH mutations. ",

IDH1 mutations are frequently detected in grades 2-4 gliomas and in acute myeloid leukemias (AML). Mutations of IDH1 have been identified at codon 132, with arginine being replaced with histidine in most cases. Mutant IDH1 gains novel enzyme activity converting α-KG to D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) which acts as a competitive inhibitor of α-KG. As a result, the activity of α-KG-dependent enzyme is reduced. Based on these findings, 2-HG has been proposed to be an oncometabolite. In this study, we established HEK293 and U87 cells that stably expressed IDH1-WT and IDH1-R132H and investigated the effect of glutaminase inhibition on cell proliferation with 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON). We found that cell proliferation was suppressed in IDH1-R132H cells. The addition of α-KG restored cell proliferation. The metabolic features of 33 gliomas with wild type IDH1 (IDH1-WT) and with IDH1-R132H mutation were examined by global metabolome analysis using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS). We showed that the 2-HG levels were highly elevated in gliomas with IDH1-R132H mutation. Intriguingly, in gliomas with IDH1-R132H, glutamine and glutamate levels were significantly reduced which implies replenishment of α-KG by glutaminolysis. Based on these results, we concluded that glutaminolysis is activated in gliomas with IDH1-R132H mutation and that development of novel therapeutic approaches targeting activated glutaminolysis is warranted.

Determination of D2HG is of relevance to diagnosis and monitoring of disease. Standard detection methods of D2HG levels are liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry or gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry. Here we present a rapid, inexpensive and sensitive enzymatic assay for the detection of D2HG levels. The assay is based on the conversion of D2HG to α-ketoglutarate (αKG) in the presence of the enzyme (D)-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (HGDH) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)). Determination of D2HG concentration is based on the detection of stoichiometrically generated NADH. The quantification limit of the enzymatic assay for D2HG in tumor tissue is 0.44 μM and in serum 2.77 μM. These limits enable detection of basal D2HG levels in human tumor tissues and serum without IDH mutations. Levels of D2HG in frozen and paraffin-embedded tumor tissues containing IDH mutations or in serum from acute myeloid leukemia patients with IDH mutations are significantly higher and can be easily identified with this assay.

Remarkably, unsupervised expression profiling showed that 86% of high BRE-expressing patients were confined to a previously unrecognized cluster. High BRE expression was mutually exclusive with FLT3 ITD, CEBPA, IDH1, and IDH2 mutations, EVI1 overexpression, and favorable karyotypes. In contrast, high BRE expression co-occurred strongly with FAB M5 morphology and MLL-AF9 fusions.

In gliomas, IDH mutations uniformly occur in the functionally critical arginine 132 residue (R132) of IDH1 and arginine 172 residue (R172) of IDH2. IDH1 and IDH2 catalyze the oxidative carboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) in the cytosol and mitochondria, respectively. In contrast, mutated IDH1/2 proteins possess a neomorphic enzymatic function that changes α-KG into the oncometabolite, R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate, resulting in genomic hypermethylation, histone methylation, genetic instability, and malignant transformation. To date, several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for IDH1/2 mutations such as anti-IDH1-R132H mAbs (clone H09, clone IMab-1, and clone HMab-1) or an anti-IDH1-R132S mAb (clone SMab-1) have been established.

IDH1/2 mutations are heterozygous, and affect a single arginine residue. Recently, IDH1 mutations were identified in 8% of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients. A glioma study revealed that IDH1 mutations cause a gain-of-function, resulting in the production and accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Genotyping of 145 AML biopsies identified 11 IDH1 R132 mutant samples. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolite screening revealed increased 2-HG levels in IDH1 R132 mutant cells and sera, and uncovered two IDH2 R172K mutations. IDH1/2 mutations were associated with normal karyotypes. Recombinant IDH1 R132C and IDH2 R172K proteins catalyze the novel nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent reduction of alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG) to 2-HG. The IDH1 R132C mutation commonly found in AML reduces the affinity for isocitrate, and increases the affinity for NADPH and alpha-KG. This prevents the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to alpha-KG, and facilitates the conversion of alpha-KG to 2-HG. IDH1/2 mutations confer an enzymatic gain of function that dramatically increases 2-HG in AML. This provides an explanation for the heterozygous acquisition of these mutations during tumorigenesis. 2-HG is a tractable metabolic biomarker of mutant IDH1/2 enzyme activity.",

Herein we investigated the functional role of miR-199b in AML and its prognostic implications.;Major approaches include transduction of hematopoietic stem cells and bone marrow transplantation, analyses of blood lineages, histone deacetylases (HDAC) inhibitors, and molecular and clinical data analyses of AML patients using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).;We first examined the relative miR-199b expression in steady state hematopoiesis and showed CD33(+) myeloid progenitors had the highest miR-199b expression. Further, silencing of miR-199b in CD34(+) cells resulted in significant increases in CFU-GM colonies. Via TCGA we analyzed the molecular and clinical characteristics of 166 AML cases to investigate a prognostic role for miR-199b. The Kaplan-Meier curves for high and low expression values of miR-199b and the observed distribution of miRNA expression revealed the highly expressed group had significantly better survival outcomes (p < 0.016, log rank test). Additionally, there was significant difference between miR-199b expression across the AML subtypes with particularly low expression found in the FAB-M5 subtype. Furthermore, FAB-M5 subtype showed a poor prognosis with a 1-year survival rate of only 25 %, compared with 51 % survival in the overall sample (p < 0.024). Furthermore, significant inverse correlation of HoxA7 and HoxB6 expression with miR-199b was observed in FAB-M5 AML patients. Molecular mutations were analyzed among miR-199b high and low AML cases. Significant correlations in terms of association and survival outcomes were observed for NPMc and IDH1 mutations. Treatment of THP-1 cells (represents M5-subtype) with HDAC inhibitors AR-42, Panobinostat, or Decitabine showed miR-199b expression was significantly elevated upon AR-42 and Panobinostat treatment. To further understand the hematopathological consequences of decreased miR-199b, we employed a bone-marrow transduce/transplant (BMT) mouse model. Interestingly, in vivo miR-199b silencing per-se in HSCs did not result in profound perturbations.;Loss of miR-199b can lead to myeloproliferation while HDAC inhibitors restore miR-199b expression and promote apoptosis.

To date, mutations in the IDH1 gene have been found in numerous cancers with the highest frequencies occurring in gliomas, chondrosarcomas/enchondromas and cholangiocarcinomas.;IDH1 was first described in the scientific literature as early as 1950. Early researchers proposed that the enzyme likely functions in cellular lipid metabolism based on the observation that the enzymatic reaction produces NADPH and partially localizes to peroxisomes. This article highlights the studies implicating IDH1 in cytoplasmic and peroxisomal lipid metabolism from the early researchers to the recent studies examining mutant IDH1(R132), the most common IDH1 mutation found in cancer.;While a role for IDH1 in lipid biosynthesis in the liver and adipose tissue is now established, a role in lipid metabolism in the brain and tumors is beginning to be examined. The recent discoveries that IDH1(R132H) interferes with the metabolism of phospholipids in gliomas and that IDH1 activity could participate in the synthesis of acetyl-CoA from glutamine in hypoxic tumors highlight roles for IDH1 in lipid metabolism in a broad spectrum of tissues.;Interferences in cytoplasmic and peroxisomal lipid metabolism by IDH1(R132) may contribute to the more favorable clinical outcome in patients whose tumors express mutations in the IDH1 gene.",

We developed a simple, PCR-based SNaPshot® assay (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) to detect IDH1/2 mutations. This protocol combines a single, multiplexed PCR reaction using gene specific primers followed by a single, multiplexed SNaPshot reaction and detection by capillary electrophoresis. In a blinded study of 32 paraffin-embedded glioma specimens previously screened for IDH mutations by a PCR/direct sequencing method, concordance of our IDH SNaPshot test with sequencing was 100%. We performed the assay on an additional 57 specimens submitted for diagnostic IDH mutation evaluation. Data analysis was much faster and easier to perform than analysis of the sequencing data, and results could be obtained in 1 day from DNA extraction to analysis. Furthermore, we could readily identify a mixture of 5% mutant allele vs. 95% wild-type allele in our SNaPshot assay, in comparison to approximately 20% mutant allele in our PCR-sequencing assay.

Promoter CpG methylation is correlated with silencing of tumor-suppressor genes (TSGs) in specific pathways that are also targets of mutation or other mechanisms of inactivation, and is thought to contribute to disease progression and poor prognosis. Epigenetic contributions to myeloid pathogenesis are more complex. Examples include TSG inactivation and oncogenic activation associated with formation of altered chromatin separate from CpG methylation. Epigenetic dysregulation occurs at multiple disease stages and at non-CpG island genomic sites, and also includes genomic hypomethylation and small RNA mechanisms of epigenetic regulation. Identification of recurrent mutations in potential epigenetic regulators, including TET2, IDH1, IDH2, DNMT3A, UTX, and ASXL1, were recently described. Accordingly, therapeutics directed towards epigenetic mechanisms including methylation inhibitors and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have had some clinical success when applied to MDS and AML. However, identification of the underlying mechanisms associated with clinical responses and drug resistance remain enigmatic. Remarkably, in spite of significant molecular and translational progress, there are currently no epigenetic biomarkers in widespread clinical use.

It is concluded that the rate of IDH2 mutation is 7.29% in Chinese AML patients and 7.81% in CN-AML.

Here we show that heterozygous expression of the IDH1(R132H) allele is sufficient to induce the genome-wide alterations in DNA methylation characteristic of these tumors. Using a gene-targeting approach, we knocked-in a single copy of the most frequently observed IDH1 mutation, R132H, into a human cancer cell line and profiled changes in DNA methylation at over 27,000 CpG dinucleotides relative to wild-type parental cells. We find that IDH1(R132H/WT) mutation induces widespread alterations in DNA methylation, including hypermethylation of 2010 and hypomethylation of 842 CpG loci. We demonstrate that many of these alterations are consistent with those observed in IDH1-mutant and G-CIMP+ primary gliomas and can segregate IDH wild-type and mutated tumors as well as those exhibiting the G-CIMP phenotype in unsupervised analysis of two primary glioma cohorts. Further, we show that the direction of IDH1(R132H/WT)-mediated DNA methylation change is largely dependent upon preexisting DNA methylation levels, resulting in depletion of moderately methylated loci. Additionally, whereas the levels of multiple histone H3 and H4 methylation modifications were globally increased, consistent with broad inhibition of histone demethylation, hypermethylation at H3K9 in particular accompanied locus-specific DNA hypermethylation at several genes down-regulated in IDH1(R132H/WT) knock-in cells. These data provide insight on epigenetic alterations induced by IDH1 mutations and support a causal role for IDH1(R132H/WT) mutants in driving epigenetic instability in human cancer cells.",

Although these mutations are most commonly associated with myeloid diseases, they also occur in malignancies of the T-cell lineage. To investigate their role in these diseases and provide tractable disease models for further investigation, we analyzed the T-cell compartment in a conditional knock-in (KI) mouse model of mutant Idh1. We observed the development of a spontaneous T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) in these animals. The disease was transplantable and maintained expression of mutant IDH1. Whole-exome sequencing revealed the presence of a spontaneous activating mutation in Notch1, one of the most common mutations in human T-ALL, suggesting Idh1 mutations may have the capacity to cooperate with Notch1 to drive T-ALL. To further investigate the Idh1 mutation as an oncogenic driver in the T-cell lineage, we crossed Idh1-KI mice with conditional Trp53 null mice, a well-characterized model of T-cell malignancy, and found that T-cell lymphomagenesis was accelerated in mice bearing both mutations. Because both IDH1 and p53 are known to affect cellular metabolism, we compared the requirements for glucose and glutamine in cells derived from these tumors and found that cells bearing the Idh1 mutation have an increased dependence on both glucose and glutamine. These data suggest that mutant IDH1 contributes to malignancy in the T-cell lineage and may alter the metabolic profile of malignant T cells. ",

We validated our prognostic findings in an independent set of 104 patients.;We identified at least one somatic alteration in 97.3% of the patients. We found that internal tandem duplication in FLT3 (FLT3-ITD), partial tandem duplication in MLL (MLL-PTD), and mutations in ASXL1 and PHF6 were associated with reduced overall survival (P=0.001 for FLT3-ITD, P=0.009 for MLL-PTD, P=0.05 for ASXL1, and P=0.006 for PHF6); CEBPA and IDH2 mutations were associated with improved overall survival (P=0.05 for CEBPA and P=0.01 for IDH2). The favorable effect of NPM1 mutations was restricted to patients with co-occurring NPM1 and IDH1 or IDH2 mutations. We identified genetic predictors of outcome that improved risk stratification among patients with AML, independently of age, white-cell count, induction dose, and post-remission therapy, and validated the significance of these predictors in an independent cohort.

Zaprinast, a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor, was identified as an efficacious modulator of 2HG production and confirmed to lower 2HG levels in vivo. The mechanism of action was not due to cGMP stabilization, but rather, profiling of metabolites upstream of mutant IDH1 pointed to targeted inhibition of the enzyme glutaminase (GLS). Zaprinast treatment reversed histone hypermethylation and soft-agar growth of IDH1-mutant cells, and treatment of glutamine-addicted pancreatic cancer cells reduced growth and sensitized cells to oxidative damage. Thus, Zaprinast is efficacious against glutamine metabolism and further establishes the therapeutic linkages between GLS and 2HG-mediated oncogenesis.;Gain-of-function IDH mutations are common events in glioma, acute myelogenous leukemia, and other cancer types, which lead to the accumulation of the oncometabolite 2HG.

The management of primary conventional chondrosarcoma generally is surgical with the possible addition of radiation therapy. Treatment of conventional chondrosarcoma is problematic in unresectable or metastatic disease because the tumors tend to be resistant to standard sarcoma chemotherapy regimens. Previous attempts at targeted therapy, including inhibitors of Hedgehog signaling, the mTOR pathway, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) have been largely disappointing. However, heterozygous mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) enzymes recently have been identified in chondrogenic neoplasms, with mutations reported in approximately 87% of benign enchondromas, 70% of conventional chondrosarcomas, and 54% of dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas. The normal IDH protein continues to produce alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG) whereas the mutant IDH protein converts KG to the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Clinical trials of novel IDH inhibitors are ongoing, with evidence of early activity in IDH-mutant leukemias. IDH inhibitors show antitumor effects against IDH-mutant chondrosarcoma cell lines, supporting the inclusion of patients with chondrosarcoma with IDH mutations on IDH inhibitor clinical trials for solid tumors. Targeting IDH mutations may offer hope of a novel antineoplastic strategy not only for patients with chondrosarcomas, but also for other solid tumors with aberrant IDH activity. ",

Explicitly, in vitro toxicity data at the cellular level were integrated into whole-body PBPK models at the organism level by coupling in vitro drug exposure with in vivo drug concentration-time profiles simulated in the extracellular environment within the organ. PICD was exemplarily applied on the hepatotoxicant azathioprine to quantitatively predict in vivo drug response of perturbed biological pathways and cellular processes in rats and humans. The predictive accuracy of PICD was assessed by comparing in vivo drug response predicted for rats with observed in vivo measurements. To demonstrate clinical applicability of PICD, in vivo drug responses of a critical toxicity-related pathway were predicted for eight patients following acute azathioprine overdoses. Moreover, acute liver failure after multiple dosing of azathioprine was investigated in a patient case study by use of own clinical data. Simulated pharmacokinetic profiles were therefore related to in vivo drug response predicted for genes associated with observed clinical symptoms and to clinical biomarkers measured in vivo.

We identified 1 CBLB and 2 TET2 mutations in AP, and 1 CBL, 1 CBLB, 4 TET2, 2 ASXL1, and 2 IDH family mutations in myeloid BP. However, none of these mutations were found in chronic phase. No cases with JAK2V617F mutations were found. In 2 cases, TET2 mutations were found concomitant with CBLB mutations. By single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, uniparental disomy on chromosome 5q, 8q, 11p, and 17p was found in AP and BP but not involving 4q24 (TET2) or 11q23 (CBL). Microdeletions on chromosomes 17q11.2 and 21q22.12 involved tumor associated genes NF1 and RUNX1, respectively. Our results indicate that CBL family, TET2, ASXL1, and IDH family mutations and additional cryptic karyotypic abnormalities can occur in advanced phase CML.",

As they yield the same oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate, they are often treated as equivalent, and pooled. We studied the validity of this approach and found IDH1/2 mutations in 179 of 2119 myeloid neoplasms (8%). Cross-sectionally, the frequencies of these mutations increased from lower- to higher risk disease, thus suggesting a role in clinical progression. Variant allelic frequencies indicated that IDH1(MT) and IDH2(MT) are ancestral in up to 14/74 (19%) vs 34/99 (34%; P=0.027) of cases, respectively, illustrating the pathogenic role of these lesions in myeloid neoplasms. IDH1/2(MT) was associated with poor overall survival, particularly in lower risk myelodysplastic syndromes. Ancestral IDH1(MT) cases were associated with a worse prognosis than subclonal IDH1(MT) cases, whereas the position of IDH2(MT) within clonal hierarchy did not impact survival. This may relate to distinct mutational spectra with more DNMT3A and NPM1 mutations associated with IDH1(MT) cases, and more ASXL1, SRSF2, RUNX1, STAG2 mutations associated with IDH2(MT) cases. Our data demonstrate important clinical and biological differences between IDH1(MT) and IDH2(MT) myeloid neoplasms. These mutations should be considered separately as their differences could have implications for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment with IDH1/2(MT) inhibitors of IDH1/2(MT) patients. ",

The presence of mutations in RUNX1, ASXL1, and TP53, elevated SNP-A-based genomic complexity, and specific recurrent aCNAs predicted failure to achieve a complete response to induction chemotherapy. The presence of ≥1 aCNA/cnLOH and higher thresholds predicted for poor long-term survival irrespective of TP53 status, and the presence of ≥1 aCNA/cnLOH added negative prognostic information to knowledge of mutations in TET2, IDH1, NPM1, DNMT3A, and RUNX1. Results of multivariate analyses support a dominant role for TP53 mutations and a role for elevated genomic complexity as predictors of short survival in AML.;Integrated genomic profiling of a clinically relevant adult AML cohort identified genomic aberrations most associated with SNP-A-based genomic complexity, resistance to intensive induction therapies, and shortened overall survival.

Therefore, we analysed the prognostic impact of ID1 expression in 269 patients (aged 16-60 years) with CN-AML in the context of other molecular markers, particularly CEBPA mutations. ID1(high) status was an independent negative prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) in multivariate analysis when analysed together with age, extramedullary disease, platelets, expression of BAALC and WT1, FLT3-internal tandem duplication, NPM1, WT1 single nucleotide polymorphism rs16754 and IDH1. ID1 expression was higher in CEBPA wildtype patients than in patients with monoallelic CEBPA mutations and these patients showed higher ID1 expression compared to patients with biallelic CEBPA mutations. Thus, when CEBPA mutations were considered, ID1 expression lost its prognostic impact. Likewise, the negative impact of ID1(high) status on relapse-free survival (RFS) was lost when CEBPA mutations were included in the analysis. In CEBPA wildtype patients, ID1 expression had no impact on complete remission-rate, OS or RFS. In conclusion, CEBPA mutations seem to deregulate ID1 expression.

The diagnostic value of 2-HGA levels in blood to identify IDH mutations and its prognostic significance have been reported.

A derivatization step with (+)- o,o'-diacetyl-l-tartaric anhydride permitted to separate the two resulting diastereoisomers without chiral stationary phase, on a C18 column combined to a Xevo TQ-MS Waters mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source. This method allows standard curves to be linear over the range 0.34-135.04μM with r(2) values>0.999 and low matrix effects (<11.7%).

MDSs are predominant in the elderly with an incidence of 20/100000 at 70 years of age. To date, the only curative treatment is allogeneic stem cell transplantation; however, a majority of patients are not eligible for this therapy. Azacitidine (AZA), a hypomethylating agent, remains the primary treatment for MDS patients, which leads to a significant increase in overall survival (OS), although it is not curative. Although it is well known that the impairment of apoptosis and differentiation are important features of this complex disease, the implication of autophagy in the pathogenesis of MDS is an emerging concept. Another significant advance in MDS pathogenesis research is the recent identification of mutations in genes encoding transcription factors implicated in hematopoiesis and proteins involved in splicing (SF3B1), methylation (DNMT3A), regulation of methylation (TET2 and IDH), DNA conformation (EZH2 and ASXL1) and differentiation (N- and K-RAS). Additionally, BCL2 family member expression and regulation may also affect the physiopathology of this disease. We have recently reported that targeting autophagy may be an interesting option for the treatment of AZA-resistant patients. Thus, targeting the products of the above-mentioned genes or the signaling pathways affected by the corresponding proteins may be of great interest for the development of a new arsenal of molecules to fight MDS. In this review, we discuss the new aspects of MDS physiopathology and how recent advances in MDS pathogenesis research may impact future treatments to improve the outcome of MDS patients. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Human T-lymphotropic Virus-1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus that persists lifelong by driving clonal proliferation of infected T-cells. HTLV-1 causes a neuroinflammatory disease and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Strongyloidiasis, a gastrointestinal infection by the helminth Strongyloides stercoralis, and Infective Dermatitis associated with HTLV-1 (IDH), appear to be risk factors for the development of HTLV-1 related diseases. We used high-throughput sequencing to map and quantify the insertion sites of the provirus in order to monitor the clonality of the HTLV-1-infected T-cell population (i.e. the number of distinct clones and abundance of each clone). A newly developed biodiversity estimator called \"DivE\" was used to estimate the total number of clones in the blood. We found that the major determinant of proviral load in all subjects without leukemia/lymphoma was the total number of HTLV-1-infected clones. Nevertheless, the significantly higher proviral load in patients with strongyloidiasis or IDH was due to an increase in the mean clone abundance, not to an increase in the number of infected clones. These patients appear to be less capable of restricting clone abundance than those with HTLV-1 alone. In patients co-infected with Strongyloides there was an increased degree of oligoclonal expansion and a higher rate of turnover (i.e. appearance and disappearance) of HTLV-1-infected clones. In Strongyloides co-infected patients and those with IDH, proliferation of the most abundant HTLV-1⁺ T-cell clones is independent of the genomic environment of the provirus, in sharp contrast to patients with HTLV-1 infection alone. This implies that new selection forces are driving oligoclonal proliferation in Strongyloides co-infection and IDH. We conclude that strongyloidiasis and IDH increase the risk of development of HTLV-1-associated diseases by increasing the rate of infection of new clones and the abundance of existing HTLV-1⁺ clones.",

        "Doc_abstract":"It is now widely recognized that intrinsically disordered (or unstructured) proteins (IDPs, or IUPs) are found in organisms from all kingdoms of life. In eukaryotes, IDPs are highly abundant and perform a wide range of biological functions, including regulation and signaling. Despite increased interest in understanding the structural biology of IDPs, questions remain regarding the mechanisms through which disordered proteins perform their biological function(s). In other words, what are the relationships between disorder and function for IDPs? Several excellent reviews have recently been published that discuss the structural properties of IDPs.1-3 Here, we discuss two IDP systems which illustrate features of dynamic complexes. In the first section, we discuss two IDPs, p21 and p27, which regulate the mammalian cell division cycle by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). In the second section, we discuss recent results from Follis, Hammoudeh, Metallo and coworkers demonstrating that the IDP Myc can be bound and inhibited by small molecules through formation of dynamic complexes. Previous studies have shown that polypeptide segments of p21 and p27 are partially folded in isolation and fold further upon binding their biological targets. Interestingly, some portions of p27 which bind to and inhibit Cdk2/cyclin A remain flexible in the bound complex. This residual flexibility allows otherwise buried tyrosine residues within p27 to be phosphorylated by nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (NRTKs). Tyrosine phosphorylation relieves kinase inhibition, triggering Cdk2-mediated phosphorylation of a threonine residue within the flexible C-terminus of p27. This, in turn, marks p27 for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, unleashing full Cdk2 activity which drives cell cycle progression. p27, thus, constitutes a conduit for transmission of proliferative signals via posttranslational modifications. Importantly, activation of the p27 signaling conduit by oncogenic NRTKs contributes to tumorigenesis in some human cancers, including chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)9 and breast cancer.10 Another IDP with important roles in human cancer is the proto-oncoprotein, Myc. Myc is a DNA binding transcription factor which critically drives cell proliferation in many cell types and is often deregulated in cancer. Myc is intrinsically disordered in isolation and folds upon binding another IDP, Max and DNA. Follis, Hammoudeh, Metallo and coworkers identified small molecules which bind disordered regions of Myc and inhibit its heterodimerization with Max. Importantly, these small molecules- through formation of dynamic complexes with Myc-have been shown to inhibit Myc function in vitro and in cellular assays, opening the door to IDP-targeted therapeutics in the future. The p21/p27 and Myc systems illustrate, from different perspectives, the role of dynamics in IDP function. Dynamic fluctuations are critical for p21/p27 signaling while the dynamic free state of Myc may represent a therapeutically approachable anticancer target. Herein we review the current state of knowledge related to these two topics in IDP research.",

The prognostic impact of ASXL1 mutation and expression levels was evaluated in the context of other clinical and molecular prognostic markers.;Mutations in ASXL1 occurred with a frequency of 20.7% in MDS (n = 40 of 193) with 70% (n = 28) of mutations being frameshift mutations and 30% (n = 12) being heterozygous point mutations leading to translational changes. ASXL1 mutations were correlated with an intermediate-risk karyotype (P = .002) but not with other clinical parameters. The presence of ASXL1 mutations was associated with a shorter overall survival for frameshift and point mutations combined (hazard ratio [HR], 1.744; 95% CI, 1.08 to 2.82; P = .024) and for frameshift mutations only (HR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.21 to 3.50; P = .008).

The development of IDH signals both technology- and patient-dependent limitations expressed across a broad range of symptoms, from nausea and muscle cramps to ischemic injury. While traditional thinking has emphasized the link between hypertension and cardio-cerebrovascular injury, more recent studies of ESRD patients have stimulated significant interest in hypotension and poor outcomes. Theoretically, hypotension can contribute to the increased relative risk of death in ESRD by several mechanisms, which include acute coronary syndrome, autoregulation dysfunction, ischemia, and arrhythmogenicity. Endothelial abnormalities (increased procoagulation, thrombogenecity risk, and alterations in coronary flow reserve) and altered vascular distribution within the myocardium provide an environment for vascular injury. The current symposia will examine the pathophysiology of IDH, the specific HD prescription modifications to prevent IDH, and newer pharmacologic interventions to treat IDH and will highlight the approach to several clinical cases based on the information presented. It is becoming increasingly important to identify patients at \"high risk\" for IDH, to customize the HD prescription to the individual patient, to use drug therapy to prevent IDH events, and to track the prevalence of chronic hypotension and the incidence of IDH complications in the dialysis unit.",

According to prehemodialysis blood pressure (BP), 38 patients with IDH were divided into group A (BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg, n = 18) and group B (BP < 140/90 mmHg, n = 20). Patients were instructed to chew 3.5 gm KRG slices at each hemodialysis session during the 4-week treatment phase. Blood pressure changes, number of sessions disturbed by symptomatic IDH, plasma levels of vasoconstrictors, blood biochemistry, and adverse effects were recorded. Results. KRG significantly reduced the degree of blood pressure drop during hemodialysis (P < 0.05) and the frequency of symptomatic IDH (P < 0.05). More activation of vasoconstrictors (endothelin-1 and angiotensin II) during hemodialysis was found. The postdialytic levels of endothelin-1 and angiotensin II increased significantly (P < 0.01). Conclusion. Chewing KRG renders IDH patients better resistance to acute BP reduction during hemodialysis via activation of vasoconstrictors. Our results suggest that KRG could be an adjuvant treatment for IDH.",

TET2 mutations are common in myeloid leukemia and were proposed to contribute to leukemogenesis through DNA methylation. To expand on this concept, we studied chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) samples. TET2 missense or nonsense mutations were detected in 53% (16/30) of patients. In contrast, only 1/30 patient had a mutation in IDH1 or IDH2, and none of them had a mutation in DNMT3A in the sites most frequently mutated in leukemia. Using bisulfite pyrosequencing, global methylation measured by the LINE-1 assay and DNA methylation levels of 10 promoter CpG islands frequently abnormal in myeloid leukemia were not different between TET2 mutants and wild-type CMML cases. This was also true for 9 out of 11 gene promoters reported by others as differentially methylated by TET2 mutations. We found that two non-CpG island promoters, AIM2 and SP140, were hypermethylated in patients with mutant TET2. These were the only two gene promoters (out of 14,475 genes) previously found to be hypermethylated in TET2 mutant cases. However, total 5-methyl-cytosine levels in TET2 mutant cases were significantly higher than TET2 wild-type cases (median = 14.0% and 9.8%, respectively) (p = 0.016). Thus, TET2 mutations affect global methylation in CMML but most of the changes are likely to be outside gene promoters.",

Tumor with mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 had lower 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and higher 5-methylcytosine levels, as well as increased dimethylation of histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79). Mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 were associated with longer overall survival (P=0.028) and were independently associated with a longer time to tumor recurrence after intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma resection in multivariate analysis (P=0.021). IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were significantly associated with increased levels of p53 in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, but no mutations in the p53 gene were found, suggesting that mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 may cause a stress that leads to p53 activation. We identified 2309 genes that were significantly hypermethylated in 19 cholangiocarcinomas with mutations in IDH1 or IDH2, compared with cholangiocarcinomas without these mutations. Hypermethylated CpG sites were significantly enriched in CpG shores and upstream of transcription start sites, suggesting a global regulation of transcriptional potential. Half of the hypermethylated genes overlapped with DNA hypermethylation in IDH1-mutant gliobastomas, suggesting the existence of a common set of genes whose expression may be affected by mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 in different types of tumors.",

Mutant IDH1/IDH2 enzymes were reported to form an oncometabolite r-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), further strengthening malignancy. We quantified CO2-dependent reductive carboxylation glutaminolysis (RCG) and CO2-independent 2HG production in HTB-126 and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells by measuring (13)C incorporation from 1-(13)C-glutamine into citrate, malate, and 2HG. For HTB-126 cells, (13)C-citrate, (13)C-malate, and (13)C-2-hydroxyglutarate were enriched by 2-, 5-, and 15-fold at 5mM glucose (2-, 2.5-, and 13-fold at 25 mM glucose), respectively, after 6 h. Such enrichment decreased by 6% with IDH1 silencing, but by 30-50% upon IDH2 silencing while cell respiration and ATP levels rose up to 150%. Unlike 2HG production RCG declined at decreasing CO2. At hypoxia (5% O2), IDH2-related and unrelated (13)C-accumulation into citrate and malate increased 1.5-2.5-fold with unchanged IDH2 expression; whereas hypoxic 2HG formation did not. (13)C-2HG originated by ∼50% from other than IDH2 or IDH1 reactions, substantiating remaining activity in IDH1&2-silenced cells. Relatively high basal (12)C-2HG levels existed (5-fold higher vs. non-tumor HTB-125 cells) and (13)C-2HG was formed despite the absence of any idh2 and idh1 mutations in HTB-126 cells. Since RCG is enhanced at hypoxia (frequent in solid tumors) and 2HG can be formed without idh1/2 mutations, we suggest 2HG as an analytic marker (in serum, urine, or biopsies) predicting malignancy of breast cancer in all patients.",

In June 2003, as rebel forces approached the capital city of Monrovia (2003 estimated population: one million), an estimated 300,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) settled in private homes with family members, public buildings, and other sites. Because of fighting during June-July, the normal collection of health data by the Liberian Ministry of Health (MoH) was interrupted. In June, cases of cholera were confirmed by international nongovernment organizations. To estimate the magnitude of the outbreak, in August, the World Health Organization (WHO) conducted a retrospective review of data collected by health organizations during June--August 2003 but not reported to MoH. Additional data were collected from an emergency surveillance system that began operation on August 25. This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which indicated that as of September 22, a cholera epidemic was ongoing in Monrovia. During the week ending October 20, a total of 1,252 cases of suspected cholera were reported (WHO, MoH, unpublished data, 2003). As of November 12, the epidemic was continuing. The epidemic began in June and was associated temporally with increased fighting and the movement of IDPs. Because cholera transmission was probably attributable to an acute shortage of clean water, poor sanitation, and crowded living conditions, international and Liberian organizations attempted to supply IDP settlements with sufficient potable water and began chlorinating wells. To stop cholera transmission and avoid additional illness and death, further preventive measures are needed.",

Indapamide, a nonthiazide diuretic, has been shown to exert free-radical scavenging properties comparable to that of alpha-tocopherol. The purpose of the present work was to investigate whether indapamide (IDP) may limit ultrastructural signs of reperfusion injury in an experimental model of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion in isolated rat hearts. Rats received a chronic oral administration of IDP (7 days at 3 mg/kg body weight/day) before excision of the heart. IDP was also added to the perfusion fluid at a final concentration of 10(-4) M. Isolated hearts were perfused under control conditions for 20 min and then submitted to 15 min of global no-flow ischemia, before being reperfused for 15 min. Hearts were fixed by glutaraldehyde perfusion fixation and left ventricular ultrastructure was studied on ultra-thin sections by electron microscopy. Micrographs were taken following a random procedure to obtain a representative overview of the whole section. In the untreated group, marked ultrastructural alterations were observed including contraction bands, disrupted membranes, and swollen mitochondria. In the indapamide-treated group, the degree of morphological injury was significantly lessened. It is concluded that indapamide protects the ultrastructure of ventricular myocytes against reperfusion injury. This effect might be related to the oxygen free-radical scavenging property of the drug.",

        "Doc_abstract":"It is now widely recognized that intrinsically unstructured (or disordered) proteins (IUPs or IDPs) are found in organisms from all kingdoms of life. In eukaryotes, IUPs are highly abundant and perform a wide range of biological functions, including regulation and signaling. Despite an increased level of interest in understanding the structural biology of IUPs and IDPs, questions regarding the mechanisms through which disordered proteins perform their biological function(s) remain. In other words, what are the relationships between disorder and function for IUPs? There are several excellent reviews that discuss the structural properties of IUPs and IDPs since 2005 [Receveur-Brechot, V., et al. (2006) Proteins 62, 24-45; Mittag, T., and Forman-Kay, J. D. (2007) Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 17, 3-14; Dyson, H. J., and Wright, P. E. (2005) Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 6, 197-208]. Here, we briefly review general concepts pertaining to IUPs and then discuss our structural, biophysical, and biochemical studies of two IUPs, p21 and p27, which regulate the mammalian cell division cycle by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). Some segments of these two proteins are partially folded in isolation, and they fold further upon binding their biological targets. Interestingly, some portions of p27 remain flexible after binding to and inhibiting the Cdk2-cyclin A complex. This residual flexibility allows otherwise buried tyrosine residues within p27 to be phosphorylated by non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTKs). Tyrosine phosphorylation relieves kinase inhibition, triggering Cdk2-mediated phosphorylation of a threonine residue within the flexible C-terminus of p27. This, in turn, marks p27 for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, unleashing full Cdk2 activity which drives cell cycle progression. p27, thus, constitutes a conduit for transmission of proliferative signals via post-translational modifications. The term \"conduit\" is used here to connote a means of transmission of molecular signals which, in the case of p27, correspond to tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and, ultimately, proteolytic degradation. Transmission of these multiple signals is enabled by the inherent flexibility of p27 which persists even after tight binding to the Cdk2-cyclin A complex. Importantly, activation of the p27 signaling conduit by oncogenic NRTKs contributes to tumorigenesis in some human cancers, including chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) [Grimmler, M., et al. (2007) Cell 128, 269-280] and breast cancer [Chu, I., et al. (2007) Cell 128, 281-294]. Other IUPs may participate in conceptually similar molecular signaling conduits, and dysregulation of these putative conduits may contribute to other human diseases. Detailed study of these IUPs, both alone and within functional complexes, is required to test these hypotheses and to more fully understand the relationships between protein disorder and biological function.",

After adaptation to hypoxia, the rats were subjected to 6h-immobilization stress. It has been shown that stress action after IHT (regime I) caused the increase in LPO and the shift of GSH/GSSG to disulfides. A disbalance in antioxidative defense system was determined by the decrease in glutatione peroxidase, G-6-PDH activities, and GSH content. The support of glutathione reductase activity under stress in this group with simultaneous decrease of enzyme activity in the pentose phosphate pathway was realized through the participation of NADP-IDH. Hypoxic training in regime II induced LPO decrease in the heart tissue after stress. The increase in the heart GSH content, optimal balance of glutathione-related enzymes in this group evidences for the dependence of adaptation effects on the vigor of hypoxic exposition.

Whereas in other tumor entities the characteristics of tumor metabolism are successfully used for therapeutic approaches, such developments are very rare in brain tumors, notably in gliomas. One metabolic feature characteristic of gliomas, in particular diffuse astrocytomas and oligodendroglial tumors, is the variable content of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2HG), a metabolite that was discovered first in this tumor entity. D2HG is generated in large amounts due to various \"gain-of-function\" mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenases IDH1 and IDH2. Meanwhile, D2HG has been detected in several other tumor entities, including intrahepatic bile-duct cancer, chondrosarcoma, acute myeloid leukemia, and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. D2HG is barely detectable in healthy tissue (<0.1 mM), but its concentration increases up to 35 mM in malignant tumor tissues. Consequently, the \"oncometabolite\" D2HG has gained increasing interest in the field of tumor metabolism. To facilitate its quantitative measurement without loss of spatial resolution at a microscopical level, we have developed a novel bioluminescence assay for determining D2HG in sections of snap-frozen tissue. The assay was verified independently by photometric tests and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The novel technique allows the microscopically resolved determination of D2HG in a concentration range of 0-10 μmol/g tissue (wet weight). In combination with the already established bioluminescence imaging techniques for ATP, glucose, pyruvate, and lactate, the novel D2HG assay enables a comparative characterization of the metabolic profile of individual tumors in a further dimension.

During April--June 2007, investigators from the Southern Sudan Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (SS-FELTP) and CDC investigated a cholera outbreak in the town of Juba, Southern Sudan. This report summarizes the results of that investigation, which found that 3,157 persons were diagnosed with suspected cholera during January--June 2007, with 74 deaths resulting from the disease. An environmental investigation revealed suboptimal hygiene practices and a lack of water and sanitation infrastructure in Juba. A case-control study indicated that persons less likely to have cholera were more likely to have consumed hot meals containing meat during the outbreak. Contaminated food or water were not identified as possible sources of the cholera outbreak in Juba. However, this might be attributed to limitations of the study, including small sample size. Cholera can reach epidemic proportions if adequate control measures are not implemented early.

In this study, ASXL1 mutations were identified in 106 (22.7%) of the 466 patients with primary MDS based on the French-American-British (FAB) classification and 62 (17.1%) of the 362 patients based on the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. ASXL1 mutation was closely associated with trisomy 8 and mutations of RUNX1, EZH2, IDH, NRAS, JAK2, SETBP1 and SRSF2, but was negatively associated with SF3B1 mutation. Most ASXL1-mutated patients (85%) had concurrent other gene mutations at diagnosis. ASXL1 mutation was an independent poor prognostic factor for survival. Sequential studies showed that the original ASXL1 mutation remained unchanged at disease progression in all 32 ASXL1-mutated patients but were frequently accompanied with acquisition of mutations of other genes, including RUNX1, NRAS, KRAS, SF3B1, SETBP1 and chromosomal evolution. On the other side, among the 80 ASXL1-wild patients, only one acquired ASXL1 mutation at leukemia transformation. In conclusion, ASXL1 mutations in association with other genetic alterations may have a role in the development of MDS but contribute little to disease progression. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Peripheral neuropathy is the most frequent neurological complication associated with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) infection and advanced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). There are at least 6 patterns of HIV-associated peripheral neuropathy, although these diagnoses are often overlooked or misdiagnosed. Distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSP) is the most common form of peripheral neuropathy in HIV infection. DSP occurs mainly in patients with advanced immunosuppression and may also be secondary to the neurotoxicity of several antiretroviral agents. Treatment of painful DSP is primarily symptomatic, while pathogenesis-based therapies are under investigation. Reduction or discontinuation of neurotoxic agents should be considered if possible. Inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (IDP) can present in an acute or chronic form. The acute form may occur at the time of primary HIV infection or seroconversion. Cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytic pleocytosis (10 to 50 cells/mm3) is helpful in the diagnosis of HIV-associated IDP. Treatment consists of immunomodulatory therapy. Progressive polyradiculopathy (PP) most commonly occurs in advanced immunosuppression and usually is caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Rapidly progressive flaccid paraparesis, radiating pain and paresthesias, areflexia and sphincter dysfunction are the cardinal clinical features. Rapid diagnosis and treatment with anti-CMV therapy are necessary to prevent irreversible neurological deficits resulting from nerve root necrosis. Mononeuropathy multiplex (MM) that occurs in early HIV infection is characterised by self-limited sensory and motor deficits in the distribution of individual peripheral nerves. In advanced HIV infection, multiple nerves in two or more extremities or cranial nerves are affected. Treatment includes immunomodulation or anti-CMV therapy. Autonomic neuropathy may be caused by central or peripheral nervous system abnormalities. Treatment is supportive with correction of metabolic or toxic causes. Diffuse infiltrative lymphocytosis syndrome (DILS) presents as a Sjögren's-like disorder with CD8 T cell infiltration of multiple organs. Antiretroviral therapy and steroids may be effective treatments.",

The role of mutant JAK2 on phenotype is discussed, as not all polycythemia vera patients appear to be homozygous for the JAK2V617F mutation. Other mutations in the JAK-STAT signalling cascade are reviewed, including JAK2 exon 12, myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene, LNK (also known as SH2B3) mutations, and epigenetic changes in ten-eleven-translocation-2 (TET2), additional sex combs like 1 (ASXL1), PcG enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A).

Additionally, intradialytic time course of BIA in patients with acute renal failure (ARF) and septic shock (n = 10) was observed.;IDH occurred in 72.1% of CRF-HP and in 80% of ARF patients.

CIMP has been reported to be useful for predicting prognosis and response to treatment in a variety of tumor types, but it remains unclear whether or not CIMP is a universal phenomenon across human neoplasia or if there should be cancer-specific definitions of the phenotype. Recently, it was shown that somatic isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) mutations, frequently observed in gliomas, establish CIMP in primary human astrocytes by remodeling the methylome. Interestingly, somatic IDH1 and IDH2 mutations, and loss-of-function mutations in ten-eleven translocation (TET) methylcytosine dioxygenase-2 (TET2) associated with a hypermethylation phenotype, are also found in multiple enchondromas of patients with Ollier disease and Mafucci syndrome, and leukemia, respectively. These data provide the first clues for the elucidation of a molecular basis for CIMP. Although CIMP appears as a phenomenon that occurs in various cancer types, the definition is poorly defined and differs for each tumor.

Strikingly, several of the newly identified genes (ASXL1, DNMT3A, EZH2, IDH1 and IDH2, and TET2) are involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Aberrant epigenetic modifications have been described in many types of cancer, including myeloid malignancies. It has been proposed that repression of genes that are crucial for the cessation of the cell cycle and induction of differentiation might contribute to the malignant transformation of normal hematopoietic cells. Several therapies that aim to re-express silenced genes are currently being tested in MDS, like histone deacetylase inhibitors and hypomethylating agents. It will be interesting to assess whether patients carrying mutations in epigenetic regulators respond differently to these novel forms of epigenetic therapies.",

Western-blot analysis also showed that KMab-1 and MMab-1 reacted with the IDH2-R172K and IDH2-R172M recombinant proteins, respectively, not with IDH2-WT or other IDH2 mutants, indicating that KMab-1 and MMab-1 are IDH2-mutation-specific. Furthermore, MMab-1 specifically stained the IDH2-R172M-expressing cells in immunocytochemistry, but did not stain IDH2-WT and other IDH2-mutation-containing cells. In immunohistochemical analysis, MMab-1 specifically stained IDH2-R172M-expressing glioma. This is the first report to establish anti-IDH2-mutation-specific mAbs, which could be useful in diagnosis of mutation-bearing tumors.",

She went on to suffer recurrent episodes of distal weakness in her arms and legs with hyporeflexia. Electrophysiological studies were consistent with inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (IDP) and treatment with corticosteroids appeared to lead to an improvement. However, the development of hypertension, evidence of tubulopathy, and hepatomegaly led to re-evaluation. A diagnosis of type I tyrosinaemia was made, based on increased urinary excretion of succinylacetone and decreased activity of fumarylacetoacetase in her cultured skin fibroblasts. A low tyrosine diet did not prevent life-threatening exacerbations of neuropathy but intravenous haemarginate appeared to aid her recovery from one exacerbation. An immediate improvement in strength was seen after starting treatment with 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoro-methyl-benzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione (NTBC), an inhibitor of 4-hydroxy-phenylpyruvate dioxygenase. A liver transplant was performed but the patient died of immediate postoperative complications.

On the African continent, pneumonia (14%) and diarrhoea (17%) cause more child deaths than Malaria (16%), HIV/AIDS (4%), and measles (1%) combined. This paper set out to investigate the factors associated with the occurrence of diarrhoea and ARI incidence for children under five years in Uganda.;We used a nationally representative Uganda Demographic and Health Survey (UDHS) (2006). Sampling was done in two stages. In the first stage 321 clusters were selected from among a list of clusters sampled in the 2005/06 Uganda National Household Survey (UNHS), 17 clusters from the 2002 Census frame from Karamoja, and 30 internally displaced camps (IDPs). In the second stage, households in each cluster were selected as per UNHS listing. In addition 20 households were randomly selected in each cluster. Questionnaires were used during data collection. During the analysis, a maximum likelihood probit model was used in order to ascertain the probability of occurrence of diseases.;On average, 32% and 48% of children in the survey suffered from diarrhoea and ARI in the two weeks prior to the survey date. The occurrence was concentrated amongst children aged 0-24 months. Mother's education, especially at postsecondary level, reduced the probability of diarrhoea occurrence but had no effect on ARI occurrence. First hour initiation and exclusive breastfeeding reduced the probability occurrence of both diarrhoea and ARI. Other significant factors associated with the occurrence of both diseases include: regional and location differentials, wealth status, type of dwelling, mother's occupation, child age, and child nutritional status.;Policy interventions should target female education, eliminate location and regional disadvantages, and educate the population to adopt breastfeeding practices recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). The government should also ensure proper dwelling places for the population that are associated with favourable health outcomes. Other proper feeding practices together with breastfeeding (after six months), should be made known to the masses so as to reduce the number of children that are malnourished and growth retarded.",

The intramyocardial dissecting hematoma might appear as a component of the rupture during the evolution process. The description of the myocardium as a helical muscular band facilitates the explanation of the fiber dissection. With echocardiography, it is possible to diagnose intramyocardial dissecting hematomas (IDH), determine its location, progression, potential complications, and in some cases its reabsorption. It is necessary to search for neocavitations in the infarcted myocardium and identify the intramyocardial edge that surrounds the defect, as well as the flow inside the myocardial dissection, the pathway of the dissection, and its communication with ventricular cavities, and also to look for the complete or partial reabsorption of the cavitary image. The greater the myocardial dissection is, the worse the prognosis. If the dissecting hematoma is confined to the apical segments, it is more likely to reabsorb spontaneously. Tissue characterization with magnetic resonance during an acute myocardial infarction allows identification of reperfusion injuries with altered microcirculation and intramyocardial hemorrhage (IMH). It is necessary to search for IMH in reperfused patients with ventricular arrhythmias, stunned myocardium, and no reflow. These patients may develop an increased stiffness in the infarcted wall and a major likelihood to develop a parietal rupture. Everything seems to indicate that we are facing the same physiopathological process which can be characterized by 2 complementary imaging methods, echocardiography and magnetic resonance.",

Somatic mutations can be detected by next generation sequencing (NGS) but copy number variants (CNVs) require cytogenetic methods including karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybidization and microarray. Here, we evaluated a new method for CNV detection using read depth data derived from a targeted NGS mutation panel. In a cohort of 270 samples, we detected pathogenic mutations in 208 samples and targeted CNVs in 68 cases. The most frequent CNVs were 7q deletion including LUC7L2 and EZH2, TP53 deletion, ETV6 deletion, gain of RAD21 on 8q, and 5q deletion, including NSD1 and NPM1. We were also able to detect exon-level duplications, including so-called KMT2A (MLL) partial tandem duplication, in 9 cases. In the 63 cases that were negative for mutations, targeted CNVs were observed in 4 cases. Targeted CNV detection by NGS had very high concordance with single nucleotide polymorphism microarray, the current gold standard. We found that ETV6 deletion was strongly associated with TP53 alterations and 7q deletion was associated with mutations in TP53, KRAS and IDH1. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of using the same NGS data to simultaneously detect both somatic mutations and targeted CNVs.",

Otto Warburg observed that aerobic glycolysis was a characteristic of cancer cells. More than 50 years later, we understand that aerobic glycolysis and uptake of glutamine and glycine allow cancer cells to produce energy (ATP) and the nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids required for proliferation. Expression of the MYC oncogene drives the increase in cellular biomass facilitating proliferation. PKM2 expression in cancer cells stimulates aerobic glycolysis. Among intermediary metabolism enzymes, mutations in SDH occur in gastointestinal stromal tumors and result in a pseudohypoxic metabolic milieu. FH mutations lead to a characteristic renal cell carcinoma. Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1/2) mutations have been found in leukemias, gliomas, prostate cancer, colon cancer, thyroid cancer, and sarcomas.

With the discoveries of underlying mutations in JAK2, MPL, and, most recently, calreticulin (CALR), that together account for ∼90% of patients with MPNs, these conditions are now among the best characterized of hematological malignancies. While JAK-STAT pathway activation has been shown to be central to the pathogenesis of the MPN phenotype, the mechanism by which mutant CALR alters cellular function to result in myeloid proliferation remains unclear. Other mutations in several epigenetic modifiers, such as ASXL1, DNMT3a, TET2, EZH2, IDH1, and IDH2, as well as in genes involved in mRNA splicing, such as SF3B1 and U2AF2, have also been described in recent years in patients with MPNs, and evidence is emerging as to how these may be contributing to disease biology. From a therapeutic perspective, the discovery of aberrations in JAK2 has rapidly translated into the successful clinical use of JAK inhibitors in MPNs. Mutant calreticulin has the potential to be a tumor-specific therapeutic target because the mutations generate a novel protein C-terminus. In this chapter, we detail the genomic alterations that underlie MPNs, with a focus on the recent discovery of mutations in CALR, and explore the clinical and biological relevance of the altered genomic landscape in MPNs.

Genotypes and clinical variables were included in a multivariable Cox model of OS validated by bootstrapping. A scoring system was developed using regression coefficients from this model.;ASXL1 mutations (P < .0001) and, to a lesser extent, SRSF2 (P = .03), CBL (P = .003), and IDH2 (P = .03) mutations predicted inferior OS in univariable analysis. The retained independent prognostic factors included ASXL1 mutations, age older than 65 years, WBC count greater than 15 ×10(9)/L, platelet count less than 100 ×10(9)/L, and anemia (hemoglobin < 10 g/dL in female patients, < 11g/dL in male patients). The resulting five-parameter prognostic score delineated three groups of patients with median OS not reached, 38.5 months, and 14.4 months, respectively (P < .0001), and was validated in an independent cohort of 165 patients (P < .0001).;A new prognostic score including ASXL1 status, age, hemoglobin, WBC, and platelet counts defines three groups of CMML patients with distinct outcomes.

These patients have a high incidence of malignant transformation. No familial case is known and the etiopathogenic cause remains unknown. In enchondromatosis (Ollier disease, OD), which is comprised of enchondromas only, 4 mutations in the PTHR1 gene have been identified in 4 patients; 3 were somatic and 1 was germline. No PTHR1 mutations have been detected in MS, whereas somatic IDH1 and, more rarely, IDH2 mutations have been observed in 77% of patients with MS and 81% of patients with OD. These genetic alterations are shared with other tumors, including glioma, leukemia and carcinoma. To search for underlying somatic genomic causes, we screened MS tissues using Affymetrix SNP-chips. We looked for CNVs, LOH and uniparental isodisomy (UPID) by performing pairwise analyses between allelic intensities in tumoral DNA versus the corresponding blood-extracted DNA. While common chromosomal anomalies were absent in constitutional DNA, several shared CNVs were identified in MS-associated tumors. The most frequently encountered somatic alterations were localized in 2p22.3, 2q24.3 and 14q11.2, implicating these chromosomal rearrangements in the formation of enchondromas and spindle cell hemangiomas in MS. In one chondrosarcoma specimen, large amplifications and/or deletions were observed in chromosomes 3, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 19. Some of these genetic changes have been reported in other chondrosarcomas suggesting an etiopathogenic role. No LOH/UPID was observed in any Maffucci tissue. Our findings identify frequent somatic chromosomal rearrangements on 2p22.3, 2q24.3 and 14q11.2, which may unmask mutations leading to the lesions pathognomonic of MS. ",
