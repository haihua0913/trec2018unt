        "Background":"['Background', ' Recently, tumor mutation burden (TMB) has been shown to increase the presentation of neoantigens that stimulate immune tumor recognition, resulting in improved immunotherapy (IT) outcomes in melanoma and other cancers. As melanoma is highly immunogenic, here we tested whether TMB associates with immune recognition during tumor progression, hence impacting melanoma overall survival (OS), independently of IT treatment. Methods', ' We have generated somatic mutation data from 314 IT-naive metastatic melanomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In the TCGA cohort, TMB has been calculated for 210 genes (200GS) previously established from TMB studies of anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1/PD-L1 IT. For validation, we have sequenced exonic regions of 20 genes (20GS) with the highest TMB among 200GS in 89 IT-naive metastatic melanomas ascertained at New York University Langone Medical Center. The TMB was defined using total number of somatic, non-synonymous mutations in either 200GS (TCGA discovery) or 20GS (validation), respectively. For discovery and validation cohorts, OS from primary diagnosis of samples with high TMB was compared against low TMB, using thresholds established in previous studies. Results', ' We found that total TMB predicts better OS (p = 0.03, HR = 2.64) in TCGA melanomas. Restricting the analysis only to the established 200GS, this association became more significant in all patients (p = 0.01, HR = 2.67) as well as in patients without IT (p = 0.01, HR = 2.67). In the validation stage of 89 melanomas without prior IT treatment, a high TMB in a subset of 20GS accurately determined favorable OS (p = 0.02, HR = 2.69) and confirmed TCGA observations from the 200GS. Conclusions', ' Here we show, for the first time, that in addition to IT, high TMB predicts more favorable OS in patients that never received IT, potentially serving as a novel marker of prognosis of melanoma and likely other immunogenic tumors at early stages. In addition, our study suggests that TMB test can be robust when applied to only a small subset of genes that trigger significantly higher immunogenicity. This may also eventually assist with accurate sub-selection of early stage patients likely to respond to IT regimens.']",

Increased tumor neo-antigenic burden has been linked to PD1/PD-L1 therapeutic response in several conditions including metastatic melanoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma and microsatellite instable (MSI-H) colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the challenges and high cost associated with neo-antigen discovery has shifted focus towards more efficient methods of response stratification. As such, mutational burden determination from whole exome sequencing and comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) has emerged as a potential solution. In CRC, MSI-H may serve as a predictive biomarker for activity of PD1/PD-L1 therapy, reflecting an unquantified immunogenic mutational burden. Herein, we explore the ability to quantify tumor mutational burden (TMB) as a potential predictive biomarker of PD1/PD-L1 therapy in CRC. Methods', ' Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissue sections from 2013 cases of CRC were sequenced with CGP (FoundationOne assay). MSI status and PD-L1 gene amplification were determined as previously described. TMB was calculated by counting mutations across a 1.25Mb region spanning 315 genes. Patients were classified as TMB high or low using the top quartile threshold and microsatellite instable (MSI-H) or stable (MSS) using a computational algorithm developed by Foundation Medicine. Results', ' MSS tumors were observed in 1934 of 2013 (95.2%) cases and MSI-H tumors were observed in 79 of 2013 (3.9%) cases. 79 of 79 (100%) MSI-H cases were TMB high (range 16.8-72.7 mut./Mb) and 1510 of 1934 (78.1%) MSS cases were TMB low (range 0.0-8.0 mut./Mb). Consequently, 424 of 1934 (21.9%) MSS cases were confirmed as TMB high (range 8.8-43.1 mut./Mb). Of note, less than 0.1% of cases featured PD-L1 gene amplifications. Conclusions', ' Tumor mutational burden as estimated by CGP, as opposed to MSI assessment alone, significantly increases the number of patients with metastatic CRC who may benefit from checkpoint inhibitor based therapeutic approaches.

Methods', ' Comprehensive genomic profiling of DNA from FFPE tissue samples was performed using hybrid-capture, next-generation sequencing. TMB was calculated by counting all coding short variant alterations (base substitutions and indels), including synonymous alterations, and subtracting from this functionally oncogenic or germline alterations (per ExAC, dbSNPT, or internal algorithmic analysis). To calculate the TMB per Mb, the total number of relevant mutations is divided by the coding region of the bait set (0.8 Mb, 1.1 Mb, or 1.2 Mb). High, intermediate, and low TMB were defined as 20 mut/Mb, 6 and <20 mut/Mb, or <6 mut/Mb, respectively. Tumor types with >100 samples were analyzed.

We also describe the landscape of TMB observed from > 60,000 advanced clinical cancer specimens, across > 400 cancer types. Methods', ' CGP by hybridization capture and high-coverage sequencing (median > 500x) of the full coding regions from 236 or 315 cancer-related genes was performed. Base substitutions, indels, copy number alterations and gene fusion/rearrangements were assessed. TMB was calculated as the number of somatic, coding, base sub. and indel alterations, excluding known driver mutations, per megabase of genome examined. This metric correlates with response to anti-PD-1 in melanoma. Results', ' We validate that targeted sequencing of 1.25 Mb does provide an accurate measurement of genome-wide TMB. We describe the spectrum of TMB observed across a diversity of tumor types. Lower grade and pediatric malignancies tend to have the lowest TMB ( < 1 mut/MB), while epithelial cancers, associated with environmental DNA damage, were most highly mutated ( > 10 mut/MB). Mutations in mismatch-repair genes (MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, PMS2 and RAD50), DNA replication genes (POLD1, POLE) and TP53BP1 were associated with > 2x increases in TMB, though some specimens with high TMB lacked identifiable causative alterations. Several tumor types, in which ICI are not yet approved, had many cases with high TMB ( > 20 mut/MB), including intestinal type stomach adenocarcinoma (20%), and uterine endometrial adenocarcinoma (16%).

However, the response rates vary significantly between different tumor types and even within same tumor type (e.g. in lung cancer approx. 1 in 4 patients respond to immunotherapy). In order to better identify patients that will respond to immunotherapy, several markers have been proposed. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) has emerged more recently as a quantitative marker that can help predict responses to immunotherapies across different cancers, including melanoma, lung cancer and bladder cancer. TMB is a measure of the overall number of somatic protein coding mutations occurring in the tumor specimen. Methods', ' We analyzed 54 consecutive patients treated with immunotherapy at our institution for which we had genomic sequencing (FoundationOne). There were 39 lung cases and 15 non-lung (GI, GU, sarcoma). For 30 cases we had TMB data. Favorable response was defined as stable disease or response to therapy at 3 months. The relationship between TMB and tumor response was explored using ROC analysis. Results', ' The probability of a favorable response to immunotherapy in our patient dataset was 57% (31/54 patients). Among the patients with known TMB 60% (18/30) had a favorable response (stable disease or response to therapy). The favorable response rate for tumors originating in the lung was 64% (25/39) and for non-lung primary tumors was 40% (6/15). The difference was not statistically significant, with p = 0.12. Higher TMB values were correlated with increased probability of a favorable response. ROC analysis demonstrated an Az of 74% for TMB values in differentiating between patients with and without a favorable response. A TMB cutoff value of 8 mutations/megabase yielded a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 58% for predicting favorable response.

With the low rate of survival for distant metastatic patients with melanoma, especially in men, studies aimed at elucidating the immunological and hormonal mechanisms underlying the gender disparity are warranted.Procedures', ' To investigate the gender disparity observed between men and women affected by melanoma, we used an experimental murine model where B16 melanoma cells were injected i.v. into C57BL/6 mice and lung colonization was assessed at day 14. The roles of neutrophils and NK cells were then investigated by specific cell depletion using anti-Ly6G(1A8) and anti-NK1.1 monoclonal antibodies, respectively. Depleting antibodies or control IgG were injected every 3 days, starting one day before melanoma cell injection. To elucidate the role of hormones, ovariectomy or castration surgeries were performed 4 weeks before B16 injection and 60 day slow release pellets were inserted at the time of surgery. Findings were reproduced with a second murine melanoma cell line (YUMM1.7) derived from a genetically engineered mouse harboring human mutations in BrafV600, as well as loss of Cdkn2a and PTEN.Data', ' Compared with males, nave female mice injected with melanoma (B16 or YUMM1.7) cells have higher lung tumor burden, reduced neutrophil infiltration, and decreased NK cell activation. Ovariectomy of female mice did not affect lung tumor burden, indicating that estrogen and progesterone are not protective. Interestingly, castrated males revealed increased lung metastasis and worse survival rates compared with sham male mice, suggesting a protective role for testosterone. Further, testosterone replacement in castrated mice significantly reduced the elevated lung tumor burden to equal levels observed in sham males. Depletion of NK cells greatly increased tumor burden in both male and female mice in a gender independent manner. In contrast, neutrophil depletion increased lung tumor burden only in male mice and had no significant affect in female mice, indicating a potential gender difference in neutrophils. Moreover, neutrophil depletion in male mice also reduced NK activation and IFN- production, suggesting a stimulatory relationship between neutrophils and NK cells.Conclusion', ' Our data indicates that both neutrophils and NK cells are important for the initial response against melanoma colonization of the lung. Neutrophil depletion, as well as our castration data, indicate that there is a gender specific differential response, which may contribute to the gender disparity seen in human melanoma incidence and survival.

Neutrophil depletion in male mice also reduced NK activation and IFN- production, indicating a stimulatory relationship between neutrophils and NK cells. A subsequent NK depletion study revealed significantly increased tumor burden in both male and female NK-depleted mice when compared to the gender-matched controls. However, the increased tumor burden normally seen in lungs of females compared to males was still apparent when comparing lungs of NK depleted male mice to NK depleted female mice.

The current studies utilize the B16F10 mouse spontaneous melanoma syngeneic transplantable mouse model system. Previous published work with this vaccine platform has indicated the MIP-3 component targets nascent peptides to immature dendritic cells leading to processing by class I and class II MHC pathways. It has further been shown in this tumor system that prophylactic vaccination with the DNA construct alone delayed tumor growth. Other studies have provided evidence that PD-1 or IL-10 neutralizing antibodies enhance immunological melanoma therapies by modulating the tolerogenic tumor microenvironment. First, this study expanded previous results by finding a significant decrease in tumor burden and increase in survival by prophylactic intramuscular electroporation [IM EP] of the DNA vaccine construct. Adding three therapeutic doses of IL-10 given subcutaneously [subQ] at the tumor site to the treatment further increased mouse survival. The development of cell-mediated and humoral immune responses were documented for the first time in this system by Elispot and in-cell ELISA assays. Secondly, a novel therapeutic vaccination protocol was developed by initiating vaccination and antibody therapies after tumor challenge. With this therapeutic protocol, we demonstrated for the first time that vaccine significantly delays tumor burden and increases median survival from 17 to 21 days (p = 0.006). Addition of IL-10 (subQ) and PD-1 (intra-peritoneally) antibodies led to further highly significant decreases in tumor burden and increased median survival from 17 to 25 days (p = 0.0005). Efficient targeting of antigen to immature dendritic cells with a chemokine fusion vaccine offers a potential alternative approach to the ex vivo dendritic cell antigen loading protocols currently undergoing clinical investigation. Combining this approach with agents able to modulate the tolerogenic tumor microenvironment offers promise as a novel melanoma therapy.']",

Tumor infiltration with PV-10 leads to rapid necrosis of the injected lesion, with complete resolution common within 2-8 weeks. In phase 2 testing in 80 patients with Stage IIIB-IV(M1c) melanoma, IL PV-10 elicited an objective response in injected tumors in 51% of patients (CR', '25%, PR', '26%) after 1-4 treatment cycles.

Treatment was generally well tolerated, with adverse events confined mainly to the injection site and no grade 4 or 5 adverse events associated with use of PV-10. Recent nonclinical testing in the B16-F10 murine melanoma tumor line has confirmed that PV-10 ablation induces tumor-specific immunity, resulting in marked suppression of synchronous lung metastases upon ablation of a flank tumor and tumor-specific IFN- production. In this study we assess potential benefit of combination of PV-10 immuno-chemoablation with the hamster anti-murine CTLA-4 antibody 9H10 in bilateral flank and lung metastasis models (B16-F10 melanoma in C57BL/6 mice). Results from these models will be reported and could support clinical development of combination therapy in advanced melanoma patients, such as stage IV patients with substantial tumor burden in locations inaccessible to PV-10 injection.

In this regard, we investigated the anti-cancer effects of a novel dichlorophenyl urea compound called SR4 in melanoma. The SR4 treatment decreased the survival and inhibited the clonogenic potential along with inducing apoptosis in vitro cultures of melanoma. SR4 treatments lead to inhibition of GST activity along with inducing G2/M phase cell cycle arrest. Oral administration of 4 mg/kg b.w. SR4 leads to effective inhibition of tumor burdens in both syngeneic and nude mouse models of melanoma. The SR4 treatment was well tolerated and no overt toxicity was observed. The histopathological examination of resected tumor sections reflected decreased blood vessels, decrease in the levels of angiogenesis marker, CD31, and proliferation marker, Ki67, along with an increase in pAMPK levels. Western blot analyses of resected tumor lysates revealed increased PARP cleavage, Bim, pAMPK along with decreased pAkt, vimentin, fibronectin, CDK4 and cyclin B1.

We are currently evaluating the safety and therapeutic potential of MORAb-004, a humanized monoclonal IgG targeting endosialin/TEM-1, in clinical trials. Because MORAb-004 only recognizes human antigen and has no cross-reactivity with rodent endosialin/TEM-1, we generated a human endosialin/TEM-1 knock-in mouse in order to assess its activity in vivo.

The detection of CTCs has gained increasing interest for prediction of clinical outcome. However, it remains to be determined whether uveal melanoma cells circulating in a peripheral vein predict systemic recurrence and poorer overall prognosis.Uveal melanoma, the most common primary cancer of the eye in adults, is unique in that the uveal tract is devoid of lymphatics. Since systemic recurrence develops exclusively via hematogenous spread, patients with uveal melanomas present a special opportunity to explore the prognostic potential of CTCs. Although the lung is the first organ through which venous drainage from the affected eye passes and indeed the only organ through which all venous blood must pass, 80-95% of systemic metastases are found first in the liver without development of lung metastases. To address these issues, we investigated the numbers of CTCs in paired arterial (femoral) and venous (antecubital) blood specimens obtained from uveal melanoma patients with hepatic metastases.Methods', ' CTCs in blood specimens were measured in 17 uveal melanoma patients with multiple hepatic metastases, including 10 patients with liver-only metastases and 7 patients with hepatic and extra-hepatic metastases. Peripheral arterial and venous blood specimens were collected at the same time prior to liver directed treatment. CTCs were analyzed using CellTracks Circulating melanoma Cell Kit by CellSearch System. The clinical information and sources of blood specimens were blinded when CTCs were analyzed.Result', ' CTCs were detectable from all 17 arterial blood specimens (100%) (median 5, range 1 to 168). In contrast, much smaller numbers of CTCs were detectable in 52.9% (9/17) of venous blood specimens (median 1, range 0 to 8) from the same patients. In terms of degree of tumor burden, patients who have hepatic as well as extra-hepatic metastasis showed higher numbers of arterial CTCs (median 12, range 5 to 168), compared to patients who have liver-only metastasis (median 4, range 1 to 11). More importantly, there is no significant correlation between numbers of arterial CTCs and the degree of tumor volume in the liver in patients who have liver-only metastases.Conclusions', ' Using this technology, the detection of uveal melanoma cells in peripheral blood is feasible. Peripheral capillary beds effectively filter CTCs from venous blood; thus venous blood might not be the best source for measurement of CTCs in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma. The paucity of clinically evident non-hepatic metastases despite the effective filtration by peripheral capillary beds remains unexplained and may be a demonstration of the seed and soil hypothesis.

Imaging was performed every 12 wk. Response was assessed centrally by irRC and RECIST v1.1. Investigator-assessed irRC was used for pt management. Early pseudoprogression was defined as 25% increase in tumor burden at first assessment that was not confirmed as progressive disease (PD) per irRC at the next assessment performed ~4 wk later. Delayed pseudoprogression was defined as 25% increase in tumor burden at any time point after the first assessment, followed by non-PD at the next assessment.  Results', '  Of the 655 pts enrolled, 327 had 28 wk of follow-up by imaging at the time of analysis and were assessed for atypical responses. Overall, 29 pts (8.9%) experienced atypical response. Early pseudoprogression was observed in 15 (4.6%) pts. Late pseudoprogression was observed in 14 (4.3%) pts. In the 592 pts who survived 12 wk, 331 (56%) had best overall response of non-PD per RECIST and irRC, 177 (30%) had PD per both criteria, and 84 (14%) had PD per RECIST v1.1 but non-PD per irRC. OS was longer in pts with PD per RECIST but non-PD per irRC compared with those who had PD by both criteria (Table).    Conclusions', '  Results of this expanded analysis are consistent with previous reports suggesting that pembrolizumab may result in atypical response patterns and that conventional response criteria may underestimate the therapeutic benefit of pembrolizumab in advanced melanoma.

Methods', ' DNA was extracted from 40 microns of FFPE sections from a series of 10,428 cases of metastatic breast cancer (mBC). Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) was performed on hybridization-captured, adaptor ligation based libraries to a mean coverage depth of > 550X for up to 315 cancer-related genes plus 37 introns from 14 genes frequently rearranged in cancer. Results', ' 135 (1.2%) of the mBC featured alterations in BRAF. The median age of the 135 female patients was 66 years (range 27 to 83 years). The primary tumor was used for CGP in 50 (37%) and from metastatic sites including lymph nodes, liver, bone, lung, brain, adrenal and soft tissue in 85 (67%). Using CDH1 mutation as the definition of lobular mBC, 126 (93%) were ductal and 9 (7%) were lobular histology. Activating BRAF alterations included amplifications (48%), SV mutations (39%) and rearrangements (13%). No (0%) mBC had multiple BRAF GA in the same case. 34% of BRAF SV were V600E and 66% were a wide variety of non-V600E GA. 10 (7.4%) of 135 BRAF mutated mBC featured ERBB2 amplification with 1 (1%) having an ERBB2 SV mutation and 1 (1%) having both ERBB2 amplification and SV GA. Of the 115 BRAF GA cases with known hormone receptor status 71 (62%) were ER negative, 44 (38%) were ER positive and 63 (55%) were triple negative (TNBC). Other targetable genes enriched in mBC with BRAF GA included CDK6 (p = 0.001), HGF (p < 0.001) and MET(p < 0.001). The median TMB was 4.5 with 17 (13%) of cases with TMB > 10 mut/Mb and 7 (5%) of cases with > 20 mut/Mb. Conclusions', 'BRAF alterations, although uncommon in mBC representing only 1.2% of cases, are enriched in TNBC and feature both targetable base substitutions and rare fusions. BRAF GA may be a rare cause of anti-HER2 therapy resistance in a subset of ERBB2 driven mBC. Targetable genes co-altered with BRAF in mBC include CDK6, HGF and MET. The TMB in BRAF altered mBC is significantly higher than that for mBC in general and indicates potential role for immunotherapy for these patients.']",

        "Background":"['Drug resistance is a major problem in clinical treatment of malignant melanoma. A characteristic feature of melanoma is the abnormally high levels of basal free radicals produced in transformed melanosomes when compared to normal melanocytes. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) activate pro-oncogenic signaling pathways that promote cancer progression, metastasis and contribute to chemotherapeutic drug resistance. However, an excessive overload of ROS in cells beyond a certain tolerance limit may trigger oxidative damage and cell death. Thus cellular ROS modulation presents a valuable therapeutic strategy for melanoma. Based on the above observations, we hypothesize that causing ROS agglomeration in cells, either through depletion of antioxidants or by initiating uncontrolled ROS production, is a plausible strategy to selectively kill melanoma cells, and that -phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), a natural compound known to disable cellular GSH antioxidant system, will be effective for this purpose. We showed that that PEITC exhibited potent inhibitory effect on malignant melanoma cells with an average IC50 value of approximately 3 M. Interestingly, MEL624 and HS294T cells, which are resistant to existing antitumor agents used in melanoma treatment such as AZD6244 and Vemurafenib, were highly sensitive to PEITC. The cell death was primarily apoptotic; the effect of PEITC could be partially reversed using the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD. Furthermore, treatment of cells with PEITC lead to an aberrant increase in reactive oxygen species levels, as evidenced by FACS analysis using the fluorescent ROS dyes DCF-DA, DAF-FM and dihyroethidium. ROS increase upon PEITC treatment occurred as early as one hour, indicating that seemed to a primary event leading to subsequent cell damage. This increase in ROS was associated with a decrease in the glutathione levels in cells, suggesting that depletion of the glutathione antioxidant could be the reason for the abnormal ROS elevation induced by PEITC. This was further verified by using PEITC in combination with the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine, which completely rescued the cells from the toxic effect of PEITC. Importantly, normal melanocytes were minimally sensitive to PEITC. In addition, combination of PEITC with other standard melanoma drugs like carmustine and temozolomide exhibited synergistic effect, suggesting the possibility of using this compound to overcome drug resistance. This was further validated through in vivo studies in mice, where a combination of PEITC with BCNU seemed to reduce the tumor burden. The cytotoxic effect of PEITC was also validated in primary cancer cells isolated from melanoma specimens from patients. Thus PEITC proves to be an effective antimelanoma agent that warrants further investigation.']",

Response rate (33%) included 1 CR lasting > 25 months and 5 PRs lasting > 2 cycles. Seven pts (39%) had SD > 3 cycles and 5 (28%), disease progression. Based on the safety profile and PK of OBL given by short IV infusion, we evaluated a fixed dose of OBL given as a 1-hour IV infusion with TMZ and ABP. Methods', ' Chemotherapy-nave patients with advanced melanoma, ECOG PS  2, and baseline LDH  1.1 x ULN received TMZ 75 mg/m2/d orally (day 1-42), OBL 900 mg as a 1-hour IV infusion (days 1,4,8,11,22,25,29,32), and ABP 175 mg/m2 as a 30-minute IV infusion (days 4,25) in 56-day cycles. Responses were evaluated per RECIST. Blood samples were obtained for OBL and ABP PK, and measurement of serum shed cryptic epitopes. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, BAK, and caspase 3 was performed on days -1, 4, and 28 tumor samples. Results', ' Ten patients have been treated with the OBL one-hour infusion. Two patients progressed after one cycle. Eight patients are continuing treatment; 3 have a PR, 4 have SD and one has not been evaluated yet. One patient with a PR demonstrated increased intra-tumoral caspase 3 and decreased Bcl-2 on day 4 due to an overall reduction in tumor burden, which correlated with a decrease in shed collagen epitopes and clinical response. The one-hour OBL IV infusion has been well tolerated. No grade 3 or 4 events other than a grade 3 preexisting pleural effusion have occurred. Planned enrollment of 14 pts is continuing. Conclusions', ' Preliminary data from this ongoing study appear to confirm the promising response and disease-control rates observed with this drug combination using a substantially more convenient dosing regimen. The OBL 1-hour IV infusion is well tolerated in combination with TMZ and ABP. Additional clinical data, as well as PK and IHC data, will be presented.']",

Methods', ' Slides of 595 SN positive patients were reviewed for this pan-European study collaboration in 5 major centers. Slides were reviewed for the microanatomic location and SN tumor burden according to the Rotterdam Criteria (< 0.1mm, 0.1 - 1.0mm and > 1.0 mm) for the maximum diameter of the largest metastasis. MSS, DFS and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) rates were calculated, as was NSN positivity. Results', ' In 595 SN positive pts, the mean and median Breslow thickness was 4.73 and 3.5 mm.

Pharmacodynamic changes in activated and effector T cells were also assessed.   Methods', '  Tumor PD-L1 membrane expression was assessed in archival FFPE specimens by immunohistochemistry (28-8 PD-L1 antibody).

Relative to baseline, a rise in ALC was not detected, but phenotypic changes in PB T-cell subsets, including increases in the percentage of CD4 and CD8 expressing HLA-DR, ICOS and/or Ki67 were seen with combination therapy. Low ALC (<1.0 at wk 6-7) did not preclude OR as 3 of 12 pts with low ALC responded.

        "Background":"['In the current study we are investigating the effects of PTEN-deficient myeloid cells on tumor immune surveillance. We could previously show that hyper-activation of the PI3K signaling cascade by genetic knock-out of the counteracting phosphatase PTEN induced an anti-inflammatory phenotype in myeloid cells. This resulted in protection of conditional knock-out mice in models of acute infection and inflammation.A reduction in pro-inflammatory responses could however increase tumor burden. To address this question we induced colitis associated colon cancer in conditional PTEN-KO mice and found an increase in tumor burden and a reduction in survival in male KO mice. This was accompanied by increased numbers of splenic antigen-presenting cells (APC) expressing the immune checkpoint regulators PD-L1 and PD-L2. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis in these cells revealed a shift towards gene expression profiles found in professional APCs capable of cross-presentation. As expected, ex-vivo stimulated T-cells from KO-mice showed a reduction in proliferative capacity. These findings were further substantiated by findings in a second tumor model using implanted B16 melanoma cells. In this model myeloid PTEN-deficient mice showed a decrease in T-cell activation and a reduction in melanoma cell killing capacity.Taken together, our findings show that genetic deletion of PTEN in cells of myeloid origin increases splenic APCs expressing immune checkpoint regulators resulting in a decrease in tumor immune surveillance. Our study shows that PI3K-inhibitors which are currently tested as anti-cancer drugs might have additional beneficial effects on immune cells by shifting their inflammatory phenotype.']",

        "Meeting_name":" Nanotechnology delivery and mechanism of action of telomere oligonucleotides in melanoma",
        "Background":"[\"In nearly 90% of cancer cell types, telomere ends are stabilized by inappropriate activation of telomerase, thereby preventing telomeres from sequential shortening and establishing conditions which promote malignant transformation and immortality. As a result, telomeres and telomerase have recently become attractive targets in the development of novel anticancer therapeutics. Administration of an 11-mer oligonucleotide homologous to the 3 overhang of the telomere, T-oligo, is presumed to mimic or signal for damaged telomeric DNA, thereby inducing inherent telomere-based DNA damage responses. Exposure to T-oligo induces cell cycle arrest, senescence, apoptosis, and differentiation in a cancer cell-type specific manner. Intravenous administration of T-oligo drastically reduces tumor burden in mice. Remarkably, T-oligo has minimal side-effects on normal cells, and has shown no detectable toxicity in in vivo mouse studies. However, as an oligonucleotide, T-oligo has limited stability due to serum and intracellular nucleases. We have previously improved the delivery of T-oligo by complexing it with a novel cationic alpha helical peptide, PVBLG-8, which improved its efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the T-oligo-PVBLG (TOP) nanocomplex demonstrated increased charge stability and diameter in comparison to T-oligo. In this study we have further optimized the TOP nanocomplex, thereby improving the physiochemical properties of T-oligo for delivery and bringing T-oligo closer to clinical fruition as an innovative, anticancer therapeutic. The binding efficiency of T-oligo and PVBLG was optimized by measuring the amount of naked DNA under a range of nitrogen/phosphorus (N/P) ratios. We then compared the biodistribution of both T-oligo and TOP in vivo at various N/P ratios. T-oligo was conjugated with FITC and intravenously administered to the tail vein of mice in the presence or absence of PVBLG and monitored using molecular imaging. We found that T-oligo distribution was isolated to the kidneys, indicating that its small size makes it susceptible to renal filtration. In contrast, the TOP complex, which has a larger diameter, was able to bypass renal filtration and enter the liver and/or lungs. We also found that PVBLG was able to protect T-oligo from nucleolytic degradation in vitro. In addition, to further elucidate T-oligo's mechanism of action, we investigated its ability to form G-quadruplexes, since increasing G-quadruplex stability is known to induce apoptosis. G-quadruplex formation by T-oligo was confirmed by NMR and native-PAGE. Furthermore, since increasing G-quadruplex stability is known to activate the SAPK/JNK signaling pathway, we also investigated T-oligo's effect on the SAP/JNK pathway using immunoblotting. Collectively, these studies will significantly advance the therapeutic utility of T-oligo against melanoma.\"]",

        "Background":"['Targeting the B-RAF/MEK/ERK pathway has shown promise in the treatment of mutant B-RAF melanomas, but resistance to RAF/MEK-inhibitors has been observed. We have previously shown that the stem cell transcription factor FOXD3 is upregulated in mutant B-RAF melanoma cells upon RAF/MEK-inhibition, but the consequences of FOXD3 upregulation are unclear. Using microarrays and ChIP-sequencing, we identified ERBB3/HER3 as a direct target of FOXD3. FOXD3 enhanced ERBB3 expression and responsiveness to its ligand neuregulin-1 (NRG1). Interestingly, PLX4032 or AZD6244-treated cells displayed enhanced NRG1-dependent ERBB3 phosphorylation and downstream AKT activation. These effects were associated with NRG1 enhanced migration and growth of RAF/MEK-inhibitor treated cells in vitro. Phosphorylation of ERBB3 was found to be dependent on ERBB2/HER2, as NRG1/ERBB3-signaling was inhibited by ERBB2-targeting siRNA, the ERBB2-blocking antibody trastuzumab and the ERBB2-inhibitor lapatinib. Additionally, the combination of lapatinib and PLX4032 was more effective than either alone at inhibiting colony formation in the presence or absence of NRG1. Similarly, we found that combining lapatinib with PLX4720 was more effective than either drug alone at reducing tumor burden in melanoma xenografts. These results suggest that upregulation of ERBB3 by FOXD3 serves as an adaptive response to protect melanoma cells from the effects of RAF/MEK-inhibitors and promotes resistance. In summary, targeting the NRG1/ERBB3 pathway in conjunction with RAF/MEK may provide a clinical benefit.']",

Tpl2 (MAP3K8) is a serine threonine protein kinase in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction cascade. Tpl2 was identified by our laboratory as having a tumor suppressive function in skin carcinogenesis, with Tpl2 knockout mice developing significantly more papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas than matched wildtype (WT) controls. Cellular mesenchymal to epithelial transition factor (c-Met) is a receptor heightened in malignant skin cancers and involved in Tpl2 signaling. When bound to its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), c-Met can regulate cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis and invasion. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether c-Met signaling contributes to the heightened skin tumorigenesis in Tpl2-/- mice. Forty-four WT and Tpl2 -/- mice were subjected to a two-stage chemical carcinogenesis protocol for one year to induce skin tumors. Starting at the time of promotion, half of the WT and Tpl2 -/- mice were placed on normal diet and half received diet plus 30mg/kg Capmatinib, a pharmacological inihibitor of c-Met. This diet continued for the duration of the study. No adverse health effects were found in Capmatinib-treated mice. Similar to what we previously reported, Tpl2 -/- mice developed tumors earlier than WT controls and had statistically higher tumor incidence and overall tumor burden than WT mice. The number of tumor bearing Tpl2 -/- and Tpl2 -/- + Capmatinib fed mice was similar, although Capmatinib fed mice had a 60% reduction in overall tumor burden. Studies are underway to determine if Capmatinib affected the frequency of malignant conversion in Tpl2 -/- mice. In summary, our studies demonstrate that heightened c-Met signaling contributes to the higher tumor formation in Tpl2-/- mice and should be evaluated further as a possible therapeutic target in Tpl2-related skin cancers.']",

        "Background":"['The IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) is an attractive target for cancer immunotherapy as it controls both immune-suppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) and anti-tumor T cells. We tested depleting Tregs as immunotherapy using anti-CD25 (high-affinity IL-2R subunit) antibodies (αCD25) in ID8agg mouse ovarian cancer (OC). αCD25 reduced ascites and Treg numbers but failed to reduce tumor burden, possibly because it depleted newly activated anti-tumor T cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes. Thus, αCD25 could be novel malignant ascites palliation, but has limited stand-alone efficacy. We then tested IL-2/anti-IL-2 complexes (IL-2c) that selectively stimulate medium-affinity (CD122/CD132) IL-2R thought to expand anti-tumor T cells preferentially, but with little Treg effects. In contrast to several single agents we tested that failed to treat ID8agg (e.g., αCD25, αPD-L1, IL-2 fusion toxin denileukin diftitox), IL-2c alone durably reduced ID8agg tumor burden despite lowering the tumor microenvironmental CD8+/Treg ratio. Thus, we hypothesized that IL-2c improved CD8+ function, reduced Treg function, or both. IL-2c increased polyfunctional IFN-γ+TNF-α+ anti-tumor T cells as expected, an effect that persists weeks after drug clearance. IL-2c also increased anti-tumor T cell CD25 expression that increased IL-2 sensitivity and STAT5 phosphorylation, a likely mechanism for increased polyfunctionality. Unexpectedly, IL-2c reduced the Treg functional mediators CD25, TIGIT and granzyme B, and reduced Treg suppressive function. Thus, favorable Treg modifications are a novel IL-2c mechanism of action. Adding αCD25 to IL-2c to deplete Tregs further unexpectedly worsened IL-2c efficacy in ID8agg and reduced effector memory T cells and polyfunctional T cells in the tumor microenvironment, suggesting a previously unappreciated role for CD25 in IL-2c therapy. Similar data were seen in B16 melanoma, suggesting αCD25 reduction of IL-2c efficacy is not tumor or compartment-specific (ID8agg is peritoneal and B16 is subcutaneous). αPD-L1, an ineffective monotherapy in ID8agg, combined with IL-2c to promote complete responses, suggesting potential for potent, novel combinatorial approaches. Our data suggest that antagonizing high affinity IL-2R (such as to deplete Tregs with αCD25) has limited cancer immunotherapy utility without more specific Treg targeting. In contrast, stimulating medium-affinity IL-2R with CD122-selective IL-2c has great translational promise by simultaneously improving beneficial anti-tumor T cells and reducing detrimental Treg function.']",

Methods', 'We use a simple mathematical model that treats patient tumor burden dynamics as an evolutionary process consisting of a decreasing drug-sensitive subpopulation of tumor cells and an independently growing drug-resistant subpopulation. This model has successfully described tumor dynamics in NSCLC, melanoma (CPT Pharmacometrics Syst. Pharmacol. (2017) 6, 2939), and ovarian cancer (internal data). In the presence of drug, we represent the net fitness of the sensitive cells in terms of an exponential decay or kill rate k > 0, and the net fitness of the resistant cells as an exponential growth rate g > 0, and the initial fraction of drug-resistant cells by 0  f  1. For a given virtual patient (parameter set), we simulate RTTP as the time after start of treatment at which tumor burden V(t) is 20% higher than its lowest value (per RECIST criteria).

        "Background":"['Therapies that activate the host immune system have shown tremendous promise for a wide variety of solid tumors, with patients exhibiting vigorous and durable responses. However, in most cancer types, fewer than half of patients respond to these immune therapies. We propose epigenetic therapy as a mechanism to sensitize these patients. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis) upregulate immune attraction, including the interferon response, in solid tumors. We have shown that in human epithelial ovarian cancer cells, DNMTis upregulate viral defense by cytosolic sensing of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), triggering a Type I Interferon response and apoptosis. Demethylation and expression of bidirectionally transcribed endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) is a major component of the dsRNA that activates the response. Our work showed that treatment with the DNMTi 5-azacytidine (Aza) sensitizes mouse melanoma cells to subsequent anti-CTLA4 therapy, likely through activation of the interferon response and subsequent signaling to host immune cells. Our current work aims to verify this hypothesis. In addition, we observe that adding histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) to DNMTis can augment the upregulation of specific ERVs and the resulting downstream interferon response in human cancer cell lines. Specifically, the ERV-K family as well as the Fc2 and ERV-9 families are increased by DNMTi treatment but further augmented by HDACi treatment, while HDACis alone have minimal effects on the ERVs and the downstream interferon response. We tested the hypothesis that epigenetic drugs sensitize to immune therapy by recruiting host immune cells in an immunocompetent mouse model of serous ovarian cancer. Treatment of this model with DNMTi and HDACi results in increased recruitment of (CD3+) T cells, including tumor-killing T Effector cells, to the tumor. This epigenetic therapy causes increased activation of CD8 T cells and natural killer cells, an increase in helper T cells, and a reduction in myeloid derived suppressor cells and macrophages. We observed upregulation of the immune checkpoint ligand PD-L1 on tumor cells by DNMTis and hypothesized that treatment of this mouse model with the above drug combination plus an antibody to the PD-L1 receptor (anti-PD-1) could reduce tumor burden. This combination does indeed significantly reduce tumor burden and increase survival. We thus define a major mechanism for how DNMTis and HDACis may induce cancer cells to increase attraction and activation of immune cells and sensitize patients to immunotherapy.']",

        "Background":"['T cell-mediated immunotherapies are promising cancer treatments. However, most patients still fail to respond to these therapies. The molecular determinants of immune resistance are poorly understood. Here, we interrogated the role of loss of expression of the tumor suppressor, PTEN, in immune resistance.In preclinical studies, we found that silencing PTEN in tumor cells inhibited T cell-mediated tumor killing and decreased T cell trafficking into tumors. In clinical studies, we observed that tumors with loss of PTEN had significantly less CD8+ T cell infiltration than PTEN-present tumors. In addition, 26% of melanomas that did not yield successful TIL growth demonstrated PTEN loss, which was more frequent than was observed in tumors that yielded successful TIL growth (11%). We further validated the association between reduced number and impaired function of TIL with PTEN loss using another independent cohort, TCGA dataset for SKCM. More importantly, we analyzed clinical outcomes of metastatic melanoma patients treated with the FDA-approved anti-PD-1 antibodies. Our analysis demonstrates that a greater reduction in tumor burden was achieved by PD-1 blockade in PTEN present patients, when compared with PTEN absent patients.To decipher the factors mediating the immunosuppressive effects of PTEN loss, we determined the expression profiles of tumor cells with or without PTEN expression. Our results indicated that PTEN loss increased the production of immunosuppressive factors, including CCL2 and VEGF. Anti-VEGF blocking antibody improved anti-tumor activity of transferred tumor-reactive T cells and enhanced tumor infiltration of transferred T cells in PTEN-silenced tumors. These results suggest that loss of PTEN can facilitate the resistance of T cell-mediated immune responses by increasing the expression of immunosuppressive factors.Given that PTEN loss results in activation of the PI3K pathway, we evaluated the efficacy of immunotherapy in combination with a selective PI3Kinhibitor to treat spontaneously developed BRAF mutant, PTEN null melanomas in genetically engineered mouse models. Our result showed that the combination of PI3K inhibitor and anti-PD-1 significantly delayed tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice. Mice treated with this combination had a median survival time of 28 days, which is longer than the survival time of mice treated with either therapy. Increased numbers of T cells at tumor sites were found in mice receiving the combination therapy compared with mice receiving either agent alone.Taken together, our results demonstrate that PTEN loss contributes to the generation of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Notably, this study provides the first direct clinical evidence to support the association between PTEN loss and poor clinical outcome in immunotherapy treated patients. In addition, our study indicates that inhibition of the PI3K-AKT pathway can improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in cancer.']",

Therefore, specific genetic inhibition of PI3-Kinase in the epidermis needs to be carried out in mice. We report here on the generation of a new transgenic mouse which constitutively expresses the dominant negative mutant form of the regulatory subunit of the PI3-Kinase dimer, p85, in the epidermis under control of the keratin-5 promoter. These p85DN transgenic mice were derived on the SKH-1 hairless genetic background. A chronic UVB exposure experiment showed significant inhibition of both tumor size (p=0.0012) and tumor burden (p=0.0003) for mice carrying the transgene compared to wildtype littermates. The time to first tumor was also delayed in transgenic mice, but with only marginal significance (p=0.07). p85DN mice also showed significant inhibition of epidermal Activator Protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor activity after acute UVB treatment (p=0.046). UVB induced activation of AP-1 in the epidermis has been shown to play a functional role in UVB mouse skin carcinogenesis. Further analysis of protein expression after acute treatment with UVB suggests that Akt signaling and COX-2 activation are both downregulated in p85DN transgenic mice. To our knowledge, this is the first report of genetic inhibition of PI3-Kinase in mouse skin carcinogenesis studies. Together, these data suggest a functional role of PI3-Kinase in UVB-induced squamous cell carcinoma and support the assertion that inhibition of this pathway is beneficial in chemoprevention of non-melanoma skin cancer.

Contemporary immunotherapy protocols generally allow patients to continue treatment beyond investigator-assessed radiographic PD as long as there is ongoing clinical benefit. However, the frequency of responses beyond PD is unknown, and whether this strategy is beneficial to the patient remains unclear. We present a review of the data from patients with mRCC treated beyond PD with nivolumab on CheckMate 025 (a randomized, phase 3 study of nivolumab vs. everolimus in locally advanced or mRCC). Methods', ' Subjects on CheckMate 025 who received any treatment beyond radiographic PD were identified. Dates of progression, treatment discontinuation, and corresponding tumor measurements were analyzed. Results', ' Treatment beyond radiographic PD occurred in 171 of patients treated with nivolumab. Median treatment duration beyond radiographic progression was 3.2 months (range 0.1-23.4). There were 5 patients (2.9% of those treated beyond progression) with a partial response after initially meeting criteria for RECIST 1.1-defined PD. In these 5 patients, small changes in tumor burden led to assessments of progression and response. Median survival in the 171 patients on the nivolumab arm treated beyond PD was 28.1 months. Median survival was 25.0 months among the 410 patients randomized to nivolumab and 16.6 months among the 134 patients who did not receive nivolumab after PD. Conclusions', ' Responses beyond investigator-assessed PD in mRCC patients treated with nivolumab appear to be rare, similar to data from treatment beyond PD with nivolumab in melanoma (FDA review). However, it is possible that some patients may derive clinical benefit that is not captured by radiographic assessments, and further investigation is needed.

        "Background":"['Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are a family of epigenetic regulators with emerging roles in both tumor and immune system biology. In particular, HDAC6 has been reported to modulate the acetylation HSP90, a regulator of regulatory T-cell (Treg) suppressive activity (de Zoeten, Mol Cel Biol, 2011). Here we report a novel role of HDAC6 in T-cell activation and response against tumor or peptide vaccine. Initially the relative expression of HDAC6 was evaluated in mouse and human T-cells, revealing decreased expression of this HDAC following CD3/CD28 stimulation. To further investigate the role(s) of HDAC6 in T-cell function, an HDAC6KO mouse model was utilized. Characterization of the T-cell compartments of the HDAC6KO mouse model showed a slight, but statistically significant increase in CD4+ T-cell population in the lymph nodes at the expense of a decreased percentage of CD8+ T-cells. Further investigation using isotype-specific HDAC6 inhibitors showed similar results when WT T-cells were activated and treated with an HDAC6 inhibitor. In addition to this population skewing, HDAC6 inhibition led to an enhanced expression of CD69 in WT CD4+ T-cells. This result was reproduced in human CD4+ T-cells, indicating a role of HDAC6 in regulating T-cell activation. To evaluate advantages of HDAC6 inhibition for tumor immunotherapy, melanoma-bearing mice were adoptively transferred with T-cells activated and treated with an HDAC6 inhibitor. Ex vivo analysis of memory T-cell distribution in the lymph nodes demonstrated an increased percent of CD44+CD62L+ T-cells upon HDAC6 inhibition, suggesting a role of HDAC6 in the formation or distribution of memory CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. In a separate experiment, HDAC6KO mice inoculated with melanoma presented significantly delayed tumor growth. Additionally, in a tumor-peptide vaccination model, HDAC6KO mice displayed a remarkably reduced contraction phase in the antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell compartment when compared to WT mice after peptide vaccine administration. To further evaluate whether these in vivo responses were dependent on T-cells, WT or lympho-deficient, lymphoma-bearing mice were treated with an HDAC6 inhibitor. HDAC6 inhibition led to reduced tumor burden in WT mice, which was absent in lympho-deficient mice, highlighting the importance of lymphocytes in the aforementioned in vivo results. Thus, the role of HDAC6 in regulating immune cells during anti-tumor response appears to be more important than the previously reported role as a regulator of Treg function. The data presented demonstrates a positive effect of HDAC6 in T-cell activation, maintenance of anti-tumor response in vivo and persistence of reactive T-cells following peptide vaccination. The results herein described have revealed an unexplored role of HDAC6 with positive implications for cancer immunotherapy, warranting further investigation.']",

However, the toxicities of these inhibitors are uniquely highlighted in an indolent disease like PTC, which would require patients to endure toxicities long-term.

Although, infection with HPV has emerged as a favorable prognostic factor for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) leading to de-intensifying treatment strategies, no serum biomarkers currently exist to predict tumor response and/or relapse. One candidate serum biomarker is encoded by the human DEK gene. DEK mRNA and protein is highly upregulated in tissue specimens from several tumor types including HNSCC, breast cancer and melanoma and antibodies to DEK are detected in patients with auto-immune disease (juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematous, etc.). Our previous work has demonstrated that DEK is highly and universally expressed in HNSCC tissue specimens regardless of stage or HPV infection. Additionally, in vitro data has suggested that tumor associated macrophages secrete DEK protein leading to the hypothesis that DEK may be present in the serum of cancer patients. In fact, the detection of DEK protein in urine is currently being explored as a diagnostic biomarker for bladder cancer. Here, we sought to determine if secreted DEK protein can be detected in human plasma and if it could be used as a biomarker for HNSCC. Peripheral blood was collected from either patients with newly diagnosed, untreated, HNSCC or age-matched normal healthy controls. Plasma was separated from the samples and subjected to DEK specific ELISA (Cusabio, Wuhan, China). Plasma DEK levels were compared to tumor stage, response to therapy, and overall tumor burden in patients. Preliminary results demonstrate that DEK is indeed present in the plasma of HNSCC patients and we are currently comparing these levels to normal healthy controls. Further analyses are ongoing to determine whether DEK levels predict response to various treatment modalities, correlate with the body's immune response, and whether DEK presence in the serum will predict residual disease and/or early relapse. These data will be important to verify DEK plasma measurements as a clinically useful test and may give insight to future personalized and targeted treatment strategies for HNSCC.\"]",

The majority of men with progressive prostate cancer develop metastases, being the skeleton the most prevalent metastatic site. Dialyzable leukocyte extracts (DLEs) are heterogeneous mixtures of low-molecular-weight (<10 kDa) peptides that improve clinical responses in various diseases. Our group has shown that DLEs change cytokine serum concentrations in patients and reduce experimental metastasis in a melanoma model. In this work we analyzed the in vitro effects of a human DLE produced under good manufacturing procedures and facilities [1] and evaluated its possible antimetastatic effect in vivo.We employed PC-3 cells and murine Src-transformed Prostate Epithelial Cells (PEC-Src) to assess the direct effects of DLE in prostate cancer cells. Both cell lines were exposed in vitro to the DLE (1 pg/mL- 1 g/mL) in proliferating (+FBS) or non-proliferating (-FBS) conditions, and cell number was estimated by MTS assays. The effects on cell motility and cell invasion were evaluated by wound healing assays and invasion from collagen-embedded spheroids, respectively. Since DLEs are immunomodulators, we used an experimental metastasis model that consistently produces bone and brain metastasis in inmunocompetent mice [2]. PEC-Src expressing Luciferase2-RFP were intracardiacally injected to FVB mice and metastatic growth in DLE-treated (1, 5, or 25 g/kg p.o.) animals was quantified weekly by bioluminescence imaging.In vitro exposure to a wide range of DLE concentrations did not alter proliferation or survival in PC-3 or PEC-Src cells, indicating that the evaluated DLE does not has direct antineoplastic effect. Similarly, treatments did not alter prostate cancer cell motility or invasion. In contrast, DLE (1 g/kg) reduced metastatic tumor burden in brain and bones in inmunocompetent mice. The absence of direct effect on prostate cancer cells suggests that DLE-treatment may be changing cellular or soluble facilitators in the metastatic microenvironments.

        "Background":"['The majority of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients are diagnosed at an advanced disease stage and the overall 5-year survival rate, surprisingly, has not changed dramatically over the past several decades. Therefore, identification and subsequent characterization of new molecular determinants of OSCC, may aid in the discovery of novel targets capable of predicting patient treatment response and disease prognosis. Co- and post-transcriptional gene expression plays a crucial role in disease development. RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are critical regulators of messenger RNA (mRNA) fate within mammalian cells. The RBP CELF1 associates with GU-rich element (GRE) containing mRNAs and post transcriptionally regulates mRNA stability, translation and pre-mRNA alternative splicing. Our previous studies demonstrated that the protein levels of CELF1, increased as HNSCC disease progressed from Stage I-IV. In addition, reduction of CELF1 in oral cancer cells promoted programmed cell death and decreased tumor burden in a xenograft mouse model. In an effort to understand the underlying mechanism employed by CELF1 to promote anti-tumor activity, we utilized genomic techniques to identify CELF1 mRNA targets in oral cancer cells. Interestingly, the gene IL-24/mda-7 was one of the top aberrantly expressed mRNAs identified as a function of CELF1 levels in oral cancer cells.Interleukin -24 also known as melanoma differentiation associated gene-7 (IL-24/mda-7) is a member of the IL-10 related family of cytokines. IL-24 protein expression is absent in most cancers and forced expression of IL-24 using an adenoviral vector enhances tumor cell-specific apoptosis. Although the mechanism of IL-24 induced cell death has been studied for several cancers, the role of IL-24 in HNSCC is not well known. In addition, the regulatory mechanisms controlling IL-24 expression in cancer are not well studied. Here, we show that IL-24 mRNA is overexpressed in HNSCC tissues compared to normal specimens. Furthermore, utilizing a mouse model of oral carcinogenesis we determined that IL-24 mRNA levels are enhanced in hyperplastic/dysplastic and oral squamous cell carcinoma tissues compared to normal, which is coincident with increased protein levels of CELF1. Surprisingly, loss of CELF1 expression in oral cancer cells dramatically increased IL-24 protein from undetectable levels to robust expression. We are currently exploring the mechanism of the CELF-1/IL-24 axis in mediating apoptosis in oral cancer cells and are expanding our studies to include other cancer types. These results suggest a novel mechanism by which the RNA binding protein CELF1 promotes oral cancer cell survival, through controlling the expression of a potent tumor suppressive protein and supports CELF1 as a viable target for the development of cancer therapeutic interventions.']",

        "Background":"['Background', \"The tumor microenvironment is important in the prognosis of Neuroblastoma (NBL), a common childhood cancer of the sympathetic nervous system. However little is know about the role of T regulatory-cells (Treg cells) in NBL. We hypothesize that Treg cells may play an important role in NBL development and immunotherapy targeted to Treg cells may modify the natural course of murine model of neuroblastoma driven by SV40's large T-antigen (NBL-Tag).Methods\", 'Treg cells (positive for CD25/FOXP3/CD4/CD3) along with other common leukocytes were identified by flow cytometry in single-cell suspensions of adrenal tumors, lymph nodes, spleens, bone marrow and blood of NBL-Tag mice at 14-22 weeks of age. Age dependent pattern of T-cell infiltration and expression of 45 inflammation-relate genes (including CD4) were assessed by CD4 immunohistochemical staining (IHC), and RT-PCR (TaqMan-Low-Density-Array', 'TLDA), respectively.A luciferase-expressing NBL-Tag cell line (NBTH-Luc) was used to establish a subcutaneous neuroblastoma models in C57Bl/6 mice and tumors were profiled using similar flow cytometry strategies as above. Animals with subcutaneous tumors or transgenic animals were subjected to immunotherapy using anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, or combination of the two (with appropriate isotype controls) in low and high tumor burden scenarios.Results', 'IHC showed presence and increasing number of CD4+ cells in tumors of NBL-Tag mice over time. In comparison, no CD4+ cells were identified in wild-type adrenal glands. TLDA analysis also showed on average a 4-fold increased expression of CD4 cells in tumors compared to wild-type adrenal glands. Flow cytometry data demonstrated that the CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Treg cells infiltrate NBL-Tag tumors at all ages (mean=2.9% of all CD45+ cells, n=17 mice). Subcutaneous syngeneic tumors were also infiltrated with CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Treg cells (mean=8.6% of all CD45+ cells, n=7 mice). Combination of anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1 was not effective in well-established tumors in either NBL-Tag transgenic model or subcutaneous model (p=NS). However, combination immunotherapy prevented formation of subcutaneous tumors (minimal residual disease model) compared to control group (p<0.0001, n=5 per group).Conclusion and Future Directions', 'Our results demonstrate presence of Treg cells in NBL-Tag tumors. Treatment with anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 prevented formation of neuroblastoma tumors in a syngeneic subcutaneous model. Our data provides pre-clinical evidence that Ipilimumab and Nivolumab, recently approved melanoma drugs, may be useful in treating neuroblastoma children with minimal residual disease.']",
