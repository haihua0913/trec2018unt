        "Background":"['IntroductionTumor-associated immune suppression can lead to defective T-cell mediated antitumor immunity. CD8 T-cells play a critical role in the host defense against cancers and infectious diseases. However, the presence of antigen-specific CD8 T-cells does not always imply that cancers and/or pathogens are efficiently eliminated in the body. In tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILS), other markers including CD103, PD-1 and FOXP3 are broadly expressed and have shown a wider range of immunoregulatory and important roles in T-cell activation, T- cell regulatory and programmed cell-death checkpoints. Existing methods can either deliver phenotypic information on homogenous samples such as flow cell cytometry or give immunohistochemical information on single biomarker. However, it would be of advantage to be able to visualize the distributions of multiple biomarkers in TILs that would discriminate stromal cells versus solid tumor. Therefore, a multiplex IHC stain utilizing a melanoma marker as a staining mask that separates the malignant tumor cells from stromal cells maybe a good strategy to facilitate better interpretation.Materials and MethodsMonoclonal mouse antibodies to CD8, FOXP3 and PD-1 and rabbit monoclonal antibodies CD8, CD103 and PD-1 were optimally tittered for single, double and triple stains and visualized with HRP DAB/Black chromogens and/or alkaline phosphatase fast red/blue chromogens. A mouse monoclonal pan melanoma cocktail was visualized with a fast red chromogen and was used as a staining mask for melanoma tumors cells, but not stromal cells.ResultsSingle, double and triple stains that included pan melanoma cocktail (mask) and CD8, CD103 FOXP3 and PD-1 were successfully established. All double and triple stains gave comparable results to single stains. The co-expression of TILs including CD8 and CD103 or CD8 or FOXP3 and PD-1 was easily identified with contrasting chromogens. TILs in stroma tissues and in malignant tumors cells were easily discriminated with the pan melanoma (mask) that stained only tumor cells with fast red chromogen, but did not stain TILS or stromal tissues.ConclusionThe evaluation of TILS in malignant melanoma was enhanced with multiplex stains. TILs in stromal tissues and melanoma tumors cells were easily distinguished with the Pan Melanoma staining mask. These finding may help facilitate important prognostic information and thus may support the rationale for using immunotherapy strategies.']",

Expression of T cell markers and IFN/CD107a production were assessed by flow cytometry. T cell cytotoxicity was determined by co-culture of TILs and melanoma and analysis of annexin V and propidium iodide. Affymetrix based microarray was performed on TILs for gene expression analysis. Statistical significance of DMSO vs ACY1215 treated T cells was based on paired, two-tailed, students t-test. Results', ' ACY1215 was unique among pan and selective HDAC inhibitors in modulating T cell function, with minimal impact on viability.

Here, we show that tumor antigen (TA)-specific CD8+ T cells and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) upregulate TIGIT and most often co-express TIGIT and PD-1 in melanoma patients. CD8+ TILs downregulate CD226, supporting an imbalance of TIGIT/CD226 expression in metastatic melanoma.

PD-1+TIGIT+, PD-1TIGIT+ and PD-1+ TIGIT CD8+ TILs exhibit similar functional capacities ex vivo, suggesting that TIGIT upregulation alone or together with PD-1 is not a marker of T cell dysfunction. However, in the presence of TIGIT ligand-expressing cells, TIGIT blockade adds to PD-1 blockade to increase the proliferation, cytokine production and degranulation of TA-specific CD8+ T cells and CD8+ TILs. Collectively, our findings show that TIGIT together with PD-1 regulate the expansion and function of TA-specific CD8+ T cells and CD8+TILs in melanoma patients.

We queried this prospective trial database for all patients with height and weight data at the time of enrollment into the trial. Patients were stratified by BMI as obese (BMI 30) or not obese (BMI<30). Patient age, sex, Breslow thickness, and lymph node status were assessed for their impact on melanoma specific survival (MSS) and surgical complications. Pathologic data and primary site data were also analyzed with regards to obesity.Results', ' A total of 1,839 patients were included in the analysis, 741 from the observation group (OBS, no sentinel lymph node biopsy), and 1098 from the sentinel node group (SLN). 376 patients (20%) were obese and 1,463 (80%) were not. MSS at 5 years was 88.8% (1.7) for obese patients and 82.2% (1.0) for non-obese patients (p = 0.0512, univariate). A small minority of patients were underweight (n = 27, 1.5%, BMI < 18.5) and they experienced a trend towards worse survival than obese patients (5-yr MSS 79.0% 8.4). We assessed BMI in a multivariable analysis as a continuous and categorical variable and found a consistent direct association with MSS (for BMI 30', ' HR 0.69 [0.52-0.91], p = 0.010).

        "Background":"['Adoptive cell therapy with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) is a promising immunotherapeutic approach and has resulted in durable response rates of 20-30% in patients with metastatic melanoma. However, several limitations exist to prevent the widespread implementation of adoptive cell therapy, including inadequate infiltration of tumor-specific T cells into tumors and anemic expansion of tumor-specific T cells in vitro. One such factor is PD-1 expression on T cells that plays an important role in T cell exhaustion. Agonistic co-stimulatory molecules such as 4-1BB which is transiently expressed on activated T cells can reverse T cell exhaustion and enhance anti-tumor immune response. In this study, we have examined two approaches to improve the frequency of tumor-specific T cells in tumors and TIL cultures. First, we examined whether blocking PD-L1/PD-1 signaling increased the infiltration of tumor-specific T cells in the murine B16 melanoma model. Mice bearing B16 tumors were treated with NrIgG or anti-PD-1 antibodies. T cells were isolated from B16 tumors on day 18 after tumor injection. Increased IFN- production following B16 restimulation was observed in TIL isolated from mice treated with anti-PD-1 antibody (1445  48 pg/ml) compared to TIL isolated from mice treated with control antibody (748  25 pg/ml, p<0.001). In addition, we examined whether the expansion of T cells during TIL culture in vitro could be augmented by targeting the co-stimulatory molecule, 4-1BB. T cells were isolated from B16 tumors and cultured in vitro with 10 mcg/mL anti-4-1BB antibody. After 5 days, increased B16-specific IFN- was measured in TIL cultured with anti-4-1BB antibody (1865  64 pg/ml, p<0.001 compared to TIL cultured with control antibody). Combination treatment with anti-PD-1 antibody therapy in vivo and anti-4-1BB antibody in vitro demonstrated synergistic effects, with increased levels of IFN- (4440  486 pg/ml) produced by B16-specific TIL. These findings suggest that anti-PD-1 antibody treatment in combination with in vitro 4-1BB antibody treatment can enhance the frequency of tumor-specific T cells isolated from B16 melanoma.

Ulceration has been correlated with an increased risk of death within a given thickness range, however, the biologic basis for the development of ulceration is poorly understood. Livin, an inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP), is overexpressed in various cancers and possesses both the ability to protect from cell death and to promote it once it is cleaved. It is unknown whether there is a differential cellular expression of livin in ulcerated versus non-ulcerated melanomas. Methods', ' To explore the role of livin in relation to ulceration, other clinicopathological factors and survival of melanoma patients, we have performed semiquantitative immunohistochemical analysis of livin expression as measured by percentage and intensity (levels) of cells immunoreactive for livin in tumor specimens having both ulcerated and non-ulcerated areas from 50 melanoma lesions. Results', ' Superficial as well as deep melanoma cells located in non-ulcerated areas of tumor had higher percentage of cytoplasmic immunopositivity for livin when compared with melanocytes in the ulcerated areas of the melanoma (p<0.0001). We also observed nuclear expression of livin protein in this subset of melanoma patients. Compared to the ulcerated areas, the superficially located melanoma cells from the non-ulcerated areas showed significantly higher intensity of livin immunoreactivity in their nuclei (p = 0.048) but not those from the deep non-ulcerated areas (p = 0.32). Ulcerated melanomas with low tumor stage (I/II) had higher percentage of tumor cells with nuclear livin expression than those from higher tumor stage (III/IV) (p = 0.002). Interestingly, we observed that patients with higher intensity of cytosolic expression of livin protein in the ulcerated area of tumor were more likely to have a brisk tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) response (p = 0.001). Patients with higher intensity of cytoplasmic livin protein of tumor cells in ulcerated areas had higher risk of death compared to those with lower levels (p = 0.005). On the other hand, patients with higher intensity of cytoplasmic expression of livin in melanoma cells located superficially in the non-ulcerated areas of tumor had better prognosis (p = 0.045). Conclusion', ' Our data indicate that there is a decrease of nuclear as well as cytoplasmic expression of livin protein in melanoma cells from ulcerated when compared to non-ulcerated areas. Also, cytoplasmic livin expression is an indicator of poor prognosis, but apparently only in patients with ulcerated lesions.

        "Background":"['Melanoma is an aggressive malignancy with a relatively high metastatic rate, responsible for almost 60% of lethal skin tumors. Although many human cancers such as melanoma express tumor antigens recognized by T cells, host immune responses often fail to control tumor growth for mostly unexplained reasons. Escaping immune destruction is one of the tenets of tumorigenesis; there have been several studies suggesting an important role of PD-1/PD-L1 (B7-H1) interactions in inhibiting the effector functions of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte in tumor. Ghebeh et al., reported that doxorubicin treatment caused decrease in cytosolic B7-H1 and increased nuclear translocalization in breast carcinoma (Breast Cancer Res. 2010;12(4)', 'R48). It is unknown whether differential cellular expression of PD-L1 contributes to the pathogenesis of melanoma. To address the role of PD-L1 and its receptor PD-1 in different stages of malignant melanoma, we have performed semiquantitative immunohistochemical analysis of PD-L1 and PD-1 in benign nevi (n=59), primary melanomas without metastasis (n=22) or with metastasis (n=17), and melanoma metastases (n=32 cases). Benign nevi had significantly higher levels of nuclear PD-L1 immunopositivity (p=0.004) and low levels of PD-1 protein expression (p=0.002). With progression from benign nevi to primary melanoma there was an increase in cytoplasmic positivity for PD-L1 (p=0.03). Also, a significant positive correlation was observed between the percentage of positive cells (p=0.0007) and intensity (p=0.0009) for PD-1 in primary melanomas. Although there was no significant difference in PD-1 levels in between primaries with or without metastasis, a trend was observed for PD-L1 expression', ' primaries with metastasis having a larger number of tumor cells with cytosolic localization than primaries without metastasis (p=0.07). Interestingly, primary melanomas without metastasis showed significantly larger number of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) cells having intense immunoreactivity for PD-L1 protein than did metastatic melanomas (p=0.03). In conclusion, differential cellular localization of PD-L1 protein and high levels of PD-1 protein correlates with disease progression and high-risk histologic features in melanoma and might partially explain the resistance of melanoma cells against the immune system.']",

Methods', '  A prospectively-enrolled cohort of patients presenting with stage III melanoma at NYU was studied. Associations between age at diagnosis and presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), response to immunotherapy, and stage IV progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were tested by log rank test. In addition, checkpoint PD-L1 expression was tested in pre-treatment tumor specimens in a subset of patients.  Results', '  316 patients (median follow-up for survivors', ' 45 months) were studied and categorized into two groups by age at diagnosis', ' 60 years (n=163) and >60 years (n=153).

Our results suggest that nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) has a role in IFN-gamma inducible expression as shown by inhibition of PD-L1 expression with the inhibitor, BMS 345541 which blocks phosphorylation of the inhibitory IkB kinase, resulting in cytoplasmic retention of NF-kB p65 and p50 subunits. Luciferase based promoter reporter assays confirmed an association between NF-kB activity and PD-L1 expression levels. Targeting NF-kB was more effective in reducing inducible PD-L1 levels than targeting either the MAPK pathway or the P13Kinase/AKT pathway.

We are also currently dissecting the signaling pathways involved in constitutive expression of PD-L1.NF-kB is an important protein complex involved in adaptive and innate immune response and regulates cytokine and chemokine production in melanoma.

        "Background":"['Melanoma delivers immune suppressive stimuli through PDL-1. FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP51) is an immunophilin capable of immune suppression. We, previously, demonstrated a relevant role for this protein in melanoma biology and progression. Melanoma also expresses a splicing variant of FKBP51 (isoform 2 or ISO2), whose function is unknown. Aim of this study was to generate knowledge on the mechanism regulating PDL-1 expression in melanoma, and find biomarkers predictive of response to immunotherapy. We generated melanoma cells overexpressing the canonical FKBP51 or ISO2, and measured levels of PDL-1. Flow cytometry showed that expression of PDL1 in ISO2-melanoma (41.5+4.2%) was significantly higher than expression in control cells (15.5+4.7%) or melanoma overexpressing the canonical FKBP51 (23.2+5.7%). These results suggested a role for ISO2 in regulation of PDL-1 expression, that was confirmed in another tumor cell line, namely HeLa. Western blot assay showed different bands of PDL-1 (around 70kD, 50kD and 37kD). The band at 70kD was present in the tumor, but not in lymphocytes and, reasonably, corresponded to the form exposed on the membrane. This 70kD band was particularly upregulated in ISO2-melanoma. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) express a strong immunohistochemistry signal for FKBP51. Since a molecular mimicry suits melanoma and lymphocytes, we investigated whether PBMCs of melanoma patients, that are a good a source of TIL, expressed the two isoforms. We measured, by QPCR, isoforms levels in PBMCs of 70 healthy donors, 92 primary melanoma and 60 metastatic melanoma patients. Our results show that expression of ISO2, but not canonical FKBP51, was significantly higher in PBMCs of patients than in PBMCs of controls (Kruskal-Wallis test, p<0.0001). In addition, ISO2 expression in PBMCs from metastatic melanoma patients (range 7.0-36.0 au) was significantly higher than expression in PBMCs from primary melanoma (range 1.0-3.5 au)(p<0-007). Healthy donors PBMCs expressed ISO2 when cocultured with melanoma and such expression changed in accordance with PDL-1 expression on melanoma, as suggested by PDL-1 knockdown experiments. Moreover, ISO2 resulted increased in PBMCs cultured with PDL-1 recombinant protein, but not BSA. These findings suggested that the increased expression of ISO2 in PBMCs of melanoma patients was stimulated by the interaction between the tumor and PBMCs, through PDL-1/PD1. In conclusion, our results show that 1) ISO2, a splicing variant of FKBP51, upregulates expression of PDL1 in melanoma; 2) PDL1-PD1 interaction between tumor and lymphocytes induces ISO2 in lymphocytes; 3) increased ISO2 levels were measured in PBMCs of 152 melanoma patients; 4) ISO2 levels were especially high in PBMCs of advanced melanoma patients.

Indeed, recent data have shown that cytotoxic T-cell reactivity targeting neo antigens may be common in human melanoma TILs. Importantly though, the clinical relevance of neo-antigen specific T cell populations remains uncertain.To directly address the tumoricidal potential of defined neo-antigen specific T cell populations, we first identified two neo-antigen specific T-cell populations within a bulk melanoma TIL culture by the combination of exome sequencing and MHC multimer-based T cell screens. Subsequently, we generated TIL products that are highly enriched for these neo-antigen reactivities and we compared the anti-tumor activity of these neo-antigen enriched TIL with that of standard bulk TIL in NSG mice bearing the autologous tumor. We observed outgrowth of the tumors in mice treated with standard TIL. In contrast, tumors in mice treated with enriched TILs were controlled long-term. Additional experiments showed that this superior activity of neo-antigen enriched TIL was caused by the increased numbers of T cells with a high anti-tumor activity, rather than the depletion of cell populations with inhibitory activity. Furthermore, once tumors eventually recurred these were still recognized in vitro by cells from the initially infused TIL culture.Together, these preclinical data demonstrate that neo-antigen reactive T cells within bulk TIL cultures form a critical component of anti-tumor reactivity and provide a further basis to target mutated antigens with cancer immunotherapy.']",

Epigenetic modifications are key players in regulating gene expression. Modulation of histone deacetylases (HDACs) has received attention for its implications in altering gene regulation. While HDAC pan-inhibition directly affects tumor growth, the immune system may be negatively impacted. Novel HDAC-selective inhibitors can ameliorate these undesirable effects. HDAC6 is unique in containing two catalytic domains, allowing for the development of isotype-selective inhibitors. Here a novel role of HDAC6 in T-cell immunity with important implications for adoptive cell therapy was explored. Initially a delay in B16 melanoma growth was observed in HDAC6KO mice (p<0.001 at day 19). Furthermore, tumor-free HDAC6KO mice vaccinated with melanoma antigen peptides displayed a mean of 30% antigen-specific circulating CD8+ T-cells versus 12% in WT mice. Moreover, HDAC6 expression was reduced over three fold in T-cells activated in vitro. To further investigate the role(s) of HDAC6 in anti-tumor T-cell responses, the HDAC6 selective inhibitor rocilinostat was utilized. Adoptive transfer of rocilinostat-treated T-cells conferred an increased anti-melanoma response in a B16 model (day 25 mean tumor volume 800 vs. 2200 cubic mm), characterized by accumulation of central memory T-cells in the lymph nodes. To directly address the clinical potential of targeting HDAC6, T-cells from healthy human donors and melanoma patient-derived TILs were treated with rocilinostat. A modest but consistent 5% increase in central memory phenotype in healthy CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells was observed. While a decrease in the nave, effector and effector memory subsets occurred, no differences in cell viability were seen. Rocilinostat treatment of TILs derived from different cell preparations (e.g. tumor digest, pre- and post-rapid expansion in vitro) displayed up to a three-fold increase in central memory in three patients analyzed. Impressively, repeated in vitro treatment with rocilinostat further increased the proportion of central memory CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. Intriguingly, initial results show that the transcription factor T-BET, involved in T-cell function, was upregulated in TILs after rocilinostat treatment and in vitro expansion. Functionally, activation of rocilinosat-treated TILs resulted in increased IFNg+CD107a+ T-cells.

Antibody-mediated blockade of ICPs can lead to durable responses in patients. Interestingly, only a small subset of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) express these checkpoints and there is a need to better understand the characteristics of this subset. We undertook this study to understand characteristics of TILs within melanoma. Methods', ' We used single cell mass cytometry, gene expression profiling of purified T cell subsets, T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing as well as functional studies to understand the characteristics of TILs in melanoma patients (n=50). We also performed exome sequencing of tumor cells in some patients. Results', ' We find that TILs are functionally and phenotypically distinct from circulating T cells. They express higher levels of inhibitory ICPs (PD-1, TIM-3) and secrete less IL2, IFNg and TNFa than T cells in circulation. Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor within tumors correlated with reduced T cell infiltration. Expression of ICPs (PD-1, TIM-3, PD-L1) were enriched in T cells with a phenotype and expression profile of tissue resident memory T (TRM) cells with most cells expressing multiple checkpoints. Within the myeloid compartment, ICPs were predominantly expressed on CD14+CD16+ subset. TCR sequencing revealed that individual melanoma metastases revealed that the top clones within each of the lesions have distinct TCRs. Concurrent TCR and tumor exome sequencing of individual metastases in the same patient revealed that inter-lesional diversity of TCRs exceeded differences in mutation/neoantigen load in tumor cells. Conclusions', ' Our findings suggest that TRM cells and CD16+ myeloid cells may be the major target of ICP blockade within tumors. The ability to activate, and retain TRM cells may be an important determinant of the T cell content of the tumor microenvironment and should be a goal for future vaccines. Importantly, our study illustrates inter-lesional diversity of TCRs within individual metastases which may differentially impact the outcome of immune therapy at each site.']",

This is demonstrated by the effective and additive response checkpoint blockade therapies have had during combination clinical trials in melanoma [1]. While the results of these trials have been promising, large portions of patients do not respond to treatment [1,2]. Additionally, many responders take months to show a response using standard criteria. In order to monitor patient response and understand the limitations of immunotherapy, we performed phage display to discover peptides targeted to tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in melanoma tumors.To improve phage library characterization, we developed a method to deep sequence phage with the Ilumina MiSeq platform. Phage screens using PhD7 library (NEB) performed on HUVECS and on TILs, nave and effector T cells, and B cells harvested from mice. The phage libraries generated from these screens were deep sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq system. The sequencing data was analyzed with an efficient, custom MATLAB script, which arranges sequences by frequency determining peptide frequencies for each library. Peptide frequency was normalized to a reference library generated by amplifying an unscreened phage library. T cell screens were compared with B cell and endothelial cell screens in sequence frequency matrices. Top TIL targeting sequences were cloned into phage, and then fluorescently labeled along with insert-less control phage. Labeled phage were incubated with TILs, or effector T cells and analyzed for specificity using flow cytometry. Four phage clones were identified with at least four fold increased binding for TILs over effector T cells isolated from the spleen. Interestingly, only subsets of the TILs were bound by the targeted phage.We have identified and validated peptides that demonstrate specificity for CD8 TILs. These peptide sequences represent candidates for development into companion diagnostic imaging agents for use with checkpoint therapies. We are currently evaluating these peptides in an in vivo tumor model to further validate their specificity and to determine their biodistributions. Peptides that validate in vivo could be developed into useful imaging agents. After peptide sequences have been validated in vivo, we will determine the phage binding partner using a phage based pulldown. The peptide binding partners discovered through this approach will provide insight into the subset of TILs bound by the phage.[1] Wolchok, J.

Several independent phase II studies have shown comparable and consistent response rates of around 50%, with very durable responses in patients reaching a complete remission.

Vaccines fusing MIP-3α to gp100 have been shown to be effective in therapeutically alleviating melanoma in mouse models. Other studies have provided evidence that IL-10 neutralizing antibodies enhance immunological melanoma therapies by modulating the tolerogenic tumor microenvironment. Here, we report that neutralizing IL-10 enhances the therapeutic anti-melanoma efficacy of a MIP-3α-gp100 DNA vaccine. The current studies utilize the B16F10 syngeneic mouse melanoma model system. The MIP-3α-gp100 DNA vaccine is administered intramuscularly (i.m.) into the tibialis muscle, followed immediately by i.m. electroporation. The standard therapeutic protocol was the following', ' challenge with lethal dose of B16F10 cells (5x104) on day 0; vaccinate with 50μg vaccine plasmid on days 3, 10, and 17; and administer 150μg of αIL10 antibody intra-tumorally beginning on day 5, once every three days for up to six doses. Tumor sizes, growth, and survival were all assessed. Treatment responses were characterized by flow cytometric analysis of tumor infiltrate. Vaccine-specific T-cells were delineated by gp10025-33 stimulation followed by intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-γ and assessment by flow cytometry. The mechanism of αIL-10 efficacy was explored by RT-PCR and confirmed with a knockout mouse model. With this therapeutic protocol, we demonstrate for the first time that a therapy neutralizing IL-10 additively enhances the anti-tumor efficacy of a MIP-3α-gp100 vaccine, leading to significantly smaller tumors, slower growing tumors, and overall increases in mouse survival. Surprisingly, the additive effects of αIL-10 were not shown to be directly mediated by any T-cell parameter tested, including vaccine-specific tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), total TILs of either CD4+ or CD8+ subset, regulatory T-cells, granzyme positive T-cells, and others. We discovered, however, that IFNα-4 transcripts in the tumor were significantly upregulated in mice given vaccine and αIL-10 compared to vaccine alone. Furthermore, infiltration into the tumor of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, known to be professional IFNα-producing cells, were enhanced with the combination therapy. A mouse model with IFNαR1 knocked out eliminated the protection provided by αIL-10, demonstrating that the additional therapeutic value of αIL-10 is primarily mediated by type-I interferons. In conclusion, efficient targeting of antigen to immature dendritic cells with a chemokine fusion vaccine offers a potential alternative approach to the ex vivo dendritic cell antigen loading protocols currently undergoing clinical investigation. Combining this approach with an IL-10 neutralizing antibody therapy that modulates the tolerogenic tumor microenvironment offers promise as a novel melanoma therapy.']",

There were too few pts to assess the impact of anti-PD1 as a single agent. A multiparametric analysis revealed that LDH levels at the time of therapy mainly influences OS and ORR to TIL but still could not invalidate the impact of Ipi prior to TIL ACT. The durability of the response was also found to be different between the 2 groups (30% for Ipi prior and 50% No Ipi prior). This new reality also impacted previously reported parameters that correlated with ORR to TIL ACT such as the expression of B-and-T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) on CD8+ TIL.

PCA of acetylated histone 3 also showed differences between R vsNR (p < 0.05). Nanostring analysis of tumor fragments showed decreased expression in NR in several epigenetic regulatory genes including DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A) and histone deacetylases (HDAC8, SIRT4)(p < 0.05).

Importantly, our independent screening with a bioactive compound library also implicated Aurora Kinase as an immune resistance candidate against T cell immunotherapy. Further studies showed that suppression of Aurora kinase activity with a pan inhibitor - AMG900, exhibited a synergistic cytotoxic effect with tumor infiltrating lymphocyte-mediated killing on autologous tumor cells from patients. Furthermore, our Nanostring analysis of tumor biopsies from patients that received adoptive T cell therapy revealed significantly increased expression of AURKA in tumors from non-responding patient when compared with responder counterparts.

The development of immunotherapies like anti-PDL1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies has resulted in fundamental advances in the treatment of some cancers. However, long lasting responses are only observed in a subset of immunotherapy-treated patients. This shortfall highlights the need for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern tumor response to immunotherapy.To address this need, autologous patient-derived tumor cell lines and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were utilized in an in vitro high throughput screen, to identify compounds that increase the sensitivity of melanoma cells to T cell mediated cytotoxicity. The screen consisted of an 850 compound library. One group of compounds that was most able to enhance T cell killing of melanoma cells was topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitors such as topotecan and irinotecan.Our results indicate that treatment of melanoma cells with a Top1 inhibitor prior to exposure to autologous T cells produced a synergistic increase in tumor cell death, as measured by intracellular staining of activated caspase 3. We have also recapitulated this finding in an in vivo model, where a better anti-tumor effect was observed in tumor bearing mice treated with an antibody against the co-inhibitory molecule PDL1 in combination with MM398 (nanoliposomal irinotecan), than in cohorts treated with either -PDL1 or Top1 inhibitor alone. These findings suggest synergism between Top1 inhibitors and immune-based therapies in the treatment of melanoma.Molecular changes elicited by inhibition of Top1 are now being investigated to identify the factors that mediate the effect of Top1 inhibitors on T cell-mediated killing of melanoma. We have identified a p53-driven gene signature in Top1 inhibitor-treated melanoma cell lines and are investigating the functional relevance of Tumor Protein p53 Inducible Nuclear Protein 1 (TP53INP1) in mediating increased T cell killing of Top1 inhibitor-treated melanoma cells. Our results indicate that TP53INP1 is a critical component of this apoptotic response, as overexpression of TP53INP1 in melanoma cells increased their susceptibility to T cell mediated cytotoxicity. Complementary to this observation, we have also found that knockdown of TP53INP1 by shRNA, impedes the sensitivity of Top1 inhibitor-treated melanoma cells to T cell mediated killing.Understanding how Top1 inhibitors enhance melanoma killing by immunotherapy will allow for the development of predictive biomarkers, and also augment immune-based therapeutic strategies to ensure durable responses in a larger population of melanoma patients. By using melanoma as a model disease system, we can gain valuable insights into the dynamics of cancer immune response that may be applied to other cancers where effective treatment strategies are also lacking.']",

Several reports have shown that administration of chemotherapeutic agents or total body irradiation (TBI) before adoptive transfer of tumor-specific T cells reduces or eliminates the immunosuppressive populations such as Tregs and MDSC. A previous study in our lab has shown that MDSC that reconstitute after lymphodepletion are highly suppressive compared to the endogenous MDSC in a B16 melanoma model. Blockade of MDSC expansion in combination with adoptive T cell transfer delayed tumor growth and improved survival rate. However, there is very little known about the MDSC reconstitution after the adoptive transfer of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in melanoma patients. Melanoma patients were treated with non- myeloablative therapy that included cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. At the time of TIL transfer, no circulating lymphoid or myeloid cells were detected in the PBMC. One day after completion of chemotherapy, up to 100 billion TIL were transferred followed by high dose bolus IL-2. At weeks 1-4 after TIL transfer, PBMC were collected and we investigated the reconstitution and the suppressive function of MDSC. MDSC were phenotyped by flow cytometry as HLA-DR Lin CD14+CD33+ or CD11b+CD14CD33+. While 3-15% of MDSC was observed in the PBMC of melanoma patients as their baseline, after lymphodepletion and one week post TIL infusion, the percent of MDSC increased to 10-30% and gradually dropped to baseline by week 4. To examine suppressive function, MDSC were isolated from peripheral blood at 1-2 weeks after TIL infusion and co-cultured with healthy donor T cells or patient TIL. MDSC were highly suppressive and abrogated T cell proliferation and IFN-gamma secretion. Furthermore, in patients that responded to TIL therapy, the ratio of peripheral MDSC to total CD8+ T cells was lower. These studies demonstrate that MDSC that reconstitute post- lymphodepletion are suppressive and may potentially interfere with robust T cell function. Further studies are warranted to clarify the role of MDSC in the efficacy of TIL therapy.

However, since melanoma cells employ various suppressive mechanisms in order to evade recognition and destruction by immune effector cells many patients still do not benefit from immunotherapy. These mechanisms are far more diverse than reflected by currently used immune modulatory drugs. In this study, we established and utilized a novel high throughput RNAi screening to identify new immune checkpoint molecules in melanoma using antigen-specific patient-derived tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in conjunction with primary HLA-matched melanoma cells. Using this approach, we screened a siRNA library targeting more than 1200 surface receptors and kinases to explore novel targets for immunotherapy.Briefly, HLA-A2 and luciferase positive M579-A2-luc melanoma cells were reversely transfected with the siRNA library and then co-cultured with MART1- and gp100-specific TILs to validate the TIL-mediated tumor lysis. Local regression models (LOESS) were applied to generate a hit list of 48 candidates that negatively regulated CTL cytotoxicity. Interestingly, four candidates of a related breast cancer screen were among the top hits. To streamline the discovery process for large scale molecule libraries, we established a secondary screen assaying multiple T cell activation markers, including effector cytokines.One of the strongest candidates from our primary and secondary screening is TiMi1 (name altered), a cell surface receptor belonging to the class of GPCRs. We found that knock-down of TiMi1 increased TIL-mediated killing of M579-A2-luc without affecting their viability. TiMi1 knock-down increased TIL activity measured by production of type 1-associated cytokines (e.g. IFN  and TNF-), reduced TC apoptosis and increased markers associated with raised activity and cytotoxicity (4-1BB and CD107a). We were able to verify the immune checkpoint function of TiMi1 in melanoma patients using an autologous set of melanoma cells and TILs. Phosphoplex analysis in T cells revealed an involvement of the transcription factor CREB in the mode of action of TiMi1. Preliminary experiments suggest that TiMi1 inhibits anti-tumor immune responses in pancreatic (PDAC) and colorectal (CRC) cancers as well.In summary, we established a novel antigen-specific screening approach for immune checkpoints expressed in melanoma and were able to identify TiMi1 as a promising candidate. Moreover, TiMi1 inhibits T cell responses in melanoma, PDAC and CRC and might be an interesting target for immunotherapy. Our novel high-throughput screening offers a systematic platform to uncover the immune-modulatome of cancer and subsequently discover novel targets for immunotherapy.

        "Background":"['There have been significant advances in the past few years with regard to BRAF-targeted therapy for metastatic melanoma, however the majority of patients have disease progression within 6 to 7 months. We have previously shown that BRAF inhibition in melanoma in vitro is associated with an increase in melanoma antigens and increased reactivity to antigen specific T cells. More recently, we corroborated these findings in vivo in patients with melanoma undergoing treatment with BRAF inhibitors, demonstrating an increase in melanoma antigens and a significant increase in CD8+ T cells following treatment. However, the nature of this immune response to BRAF inhibition is poorly understood. The goal of the present studies is to better define the T cell infiltrate, so that we can develop a therapeutic strategy to leverage their presence.To do this, we performed tumor biopsies in patients with metastatic melanoma undergoing treatment with BRAF inhibitors at two time-points', ' pre-treatment (day 0), and on-treatment (day 10-14). Biopsies were also taken at time of progression when applicable. DNA was isolated and the CDR3 regions of rearranged TCR beta chain genes within the tumor were sequenced and analyzed using the immunoSEQ platform by Adaptive Biotechnologies. Results demonstrated a significant increase in the clonality in the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in 7 of the 8 patients in on-treatment vs. pre-treatment samples, suggesting that treatment with a BRAF inhibitor may induce an antigen-specific T cell response. We also sought to determine if the increase in T cells associated with BRAF inhibition is related to an infiltration of new T cell clones or a proliferation of existing clones within the tumor. To study this, we analyzed the total T cell clones in these patient samples with regard to their presence or absence in the pre-treatment compared to on-treatment samples. Results demonstrate that over 80% of the individual clones detected after initiation of BRAF-targeted therapy are new clones, suggesting that this therapy is associated with an influx of TIL into the tumors. However, if attention is focused only on the most prevalent clones rather than the total clones, there is a dichotomous relationship between change in clonal populations and magnitude of tumor regression. Namely, those who have persistence of the same dominant clones had a good treatment response, whereas those who had a change in the dominant clonal populations had a poor response. Taken together, this data suggest that though BRAF inhibition in melanoma results in infiltration of new TIL, response to treatment is dependent on a pre-existing population of TIL clones. This data has important clinical implications, and may ultimately help predict who is likely to derive the greatest benefit from BRAF-targeted therapy. A better understanding of this response may also guide us in developing rational combination therapy in the treatment of melanoma.']",

        "Background":"['The use of targeted therapeutics, such as BRAF inhibitors, and breakthrough immunotherapy treatments such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, are two emerging paradigms in treatment of chemotherapy-resistant melanoma. However, the treatment responses with targeted therapies are short lived mainly because the patients develop resistance, and also the treatment leads to severe toxicities. Higher concentrations of drug in tumor and sustained inhibition of the kinase signaling pathway for longer period of time is required to achieve better therapeutic efficacy. Similarly, immunotherapy results in lower response rates and the response takes longer time. We envision a new paradigm where a quick as well as durable objective response could be achieved by novel supramolecular nanotherapeutic that targets MEK, downstream of BRAF, in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitor antibody PD-L1. A supramolecular nanotherapeutic is engineered from self-assembly due to supramolecular interactions of molecular building blocks designed using an in silico model based on large scale all atomistic explicit water molecular dynamic simulations. The molecular building blocks were engineered using selumetinib as a template, and rationally re-engineering these molecules by conjugating it to cholesterol to enable supramolecular nanoassembly. The supramolecular nanostructures were stable for over a month as measured by changes in size and zeta potential at different time points. Drug release kinetics profiles showed sustained activation into selumetinib in cell lysate conditions. In vitro cytotoxicity studies in multiple cell lines including Breast Cancer (MDA-MB-231), Lung Cancer (A549) and Melanoma (B16F10) cells showed that supramolecular nanotherapeutics were as effective as selumetinib, and resulted in a sustained inhibition of the MAPK pathway. In vivo studies using a B16/F10 melanoma model revealed that supramolecular nanotherapeutics alone exerted significant tumor growth inhibition as compared to selumetinib. Furthermore, the combination of supramolecular nanotherapeutics and PD-L1 antibody resulted in superior antitumor efficacy, as well as significantly increased number of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, compared to selumetinib + PD-L1 antibody or PD-L1 antibody alone treatments. This study shows that a successful strategy to improve chemotherapy outcome could be devised by synergistic combinations of supramolecular nanoparticles that target oncogenic signaling pathway with immune checkpoint inhibitors.']",

Despite the progress made in melanoma immunotherapy, there is a large cohort of patients for which these treatments are currently not applicable. They are either inherently resistant to or acquire resistance to immunotherapy. As such, understanding mechanisms of resistance to immune response and ascertaining efficacious therapy combinations is important in overcoming immunoresistance and developing novel treatment regimens.As proof of principle, preliminary work using a unique protocol for an in vitro T-cell mediated cytotoxicity screen was established. In this assay, intracellular staining of active caspase-3 in tumor cells, a marker of apoptosis, is measured by flow cytometry in a 96-well format. Using patient-derived tumor and TIL pairs, a screen of 850 compounds was performed to find candidate drugs that could modulate the sensitivity of tumor cells to T- cell mediated killing. Initial screens identified classes of compounds that inhibit Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), Aurora Kinase and Topoisomerase I, and studies to understand their mechanisms of action are currently underway.However, as this screening process is very time-intensive, we are currently increasing the efficiency and feasibility of this screen by miniaturizing this workflow. This work presents the development of a screening method that is performed in a 384-well format, with a greater drug concentration range, and utilizing robotics to streamline and increase output. With this, we can specifically identify novel targeted and immunotherapy combinations that may be used in the clinic to treat melanoma. Additionally, by understanding the signaling pathways and molecular factors that regulate tumor response to T cell mediated killing, we can translate these findings into making immune-based cancer therapies applicable to other tumor types.

A possible explanation is established tumors escape supported by the immune suppressive tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells (TIMs) including M2 type macrophages and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC).Our murine melanoma SM1 model that harbors BRAFV600 mutation is an aggressive model, where mice with established tumors have to be sacrificed within two-three weeks. Treatment with PLX4032 has significant anti-tumor effect, but it cannot fully eradicate the tumor. In addition, our prior results show that SM1 is infiltrated by M2-polarized macrophages. By depleting TIMs with the CSF-1R inhibitor, PLX3397, the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is increased. To determine if combined therapy with PLX3397 and PLX4032 improved anti-tumor responses against SM1 tumors, C57BL/6 mice with established subcutaneous SM1 tumors received oral gavage daily with PLX3397 (50mg/kg) and i.p. daily with PLX4032 (100mg/kg).

In 24 patients all LTX-315-related adverse events were CTC grade 1 or 2, most commonly local erythema, flushing, pruritis and hypotension, most resolving within minutes of injection. Related grade 3 (3 patients) or 4 (1) allergic/anaphylaxis adverse event occurred and resolved without sequelae. Best response in 44 injected lesions in 20 evaluable patients included 2 complete responses, > 50% reduction in 5 tumours, and 20 stable (injected ). Significant increases in TILs occurred in 67% (14 of 21) patients with biopsies of injected tumours available. Regression of distant non-injected tumour has been observed clinically on biopsy (abscopal effect). No irRC response in non-injected tumours has been observed in 16 evaluable patients. Stable disease (median duration 14 weeks) occurred in 50% of patients as best response (melanoma (4), sarcoma (3), breast (1)).

        "Background":"['Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from somatic cells of patients hold great promise for autologous cell therapies. One of the possible applications of iPSCs is to use them as a cell source for producing autologous lymphocytes for cell-based therapy against cancer. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were found to have tumor-reactive T cells and have been used for adoptive cell therapy for metastatic melanoma. The objective in this study is to generate iPSCs from TILs and assess their pluripotency. Under the approved protocol by the Institutional Review Board and the Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Research Oversight Committee, we obtained melanomas from a patient who provided informed consent for tissue procurement and generation of iPSCs. TILs were reprogrammed by Sendai virus (SeV) vector encoding four pluripotency transcription factors (Oct3/4, Klf4, Sox2 and c-Myc). TIL-derived iPSCs (TIL-iPSCs) were characterized by their pluripotency. Within 3 weeks of infection with SeV to deliver pluripotency transcription factors, we identified colonies that resembled embryonic stem cells (ESCs) among the T cell derivatives. TIL-iPSCs displayed typical stem cell morphology and had a normal karyotype. Alkaline phosphatase and immunofluorescence staining with stem cell surface markers, OCT3/4, SSEA3, SSEA 4, TRA1-81 and TRA1-60 proteins suggested pluripotency of colonies. RT-PCR analyses revealed that TIL-iPSCs expressed pluripotent stem cell markers such as NANOG, OCT3/4 at levels comparable to those in ESCs. T cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement analysis in TIL-iPSCs confirmed that they originated from mature T cells and retained diversity of TCR gene rearrangement. In conclusion, human iPSCs with diverse TCR gene rearrangement can be generated from TILs efficiently by SeV encoding four pluripotency transcription factors. Future work will explore their differentiation potential to T cells for cancer immunotherapy. We acknowledge in DNAVEC Corporation for kindly providing Sendai virus vectors.

        "Background":"['Adoptive T cell therapy with autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) provides up to 56% objective response rates and a complete response in 24% of patients with metastatic melanoma. The process of generating TIL from resected tumor involves morcellating the tumor into 1-3 mm3 fragments and expanding TIL in the presence of Interleukin 2 (IL-2) in a pre-Rapid Expansion Protocol (pre-REP). During the ‘pre-REP’, tumor-resident immune cells emigrate (eTIL) and proliferate. The length of the pre-REP varies between 11-21 days, depending on cell growth. Residual tumor fragments (remnants) are discarded and the expanded eTIL are subjected to a Rapid Expansion Protocol (REP) with irradiated PBMC feeders, anti-CD3 and IL-2. Viable cells remaining in the tumor remnants (rTIL) following the pre-REP were investigated to assess their function and phenotype. We evaluated and compared the rTIL and eTIL in melanoma, breast, renal, pancreatic, lung and colorectal tumors (n=9). Tumor rTIL are consistently phenotypically distinct from eTIL, as determined by differential expression of various markers (Table 1). The fundamental differences in rTIL were', ' Increased CD69+ (7 fold MFI in CD4+) (p<.001); diminished LAG3 (2 fold MFI in CD8) (p<.05); TIM3 (3 and 2 fold MFI in CD8 and CD4 respectively) (p<.05/.01); CD154 (3 fold MFI in CD4) (p<.01); and CD56 (5%) (p<.05). Surprisingly, a REP of rTIL and eTIL resulted in comparable expansion. The phenotypic signature of TIL was sustained post-REP with fidelity of the individual expression of LAG3, Tim3, and CD28. These studies have identified significant differences in the biology of cell populations in terms of tissue-resident T cells and the signals associated with emigration and retention. These data provide additional insights on the individual TIL populations that could be utilized for adoptive T-cell therapy in patients and raise important questions about the nature of tissue-resident T cells in sites of chronic inflammation such as tumor.']",

Therapies that block recruitment of suppressor TIMs have the potential to enhance adoptive cell transfer (ACT) of T cell based-immunotherapies.We originally established a BRAFV600E mutant murine melanoma cell line (SM1) for which ACT of melanoma-targeted T cells induced anti-tumor responses, but not complete eradication in vivo. By gene expression profiling and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, we found that, out of 108 cytokines produced by SM1, colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) was highly expressed. CSF1 induces proliferation of immune suppressors Gr-1(+) CD11b(+) MDSC and F4/80(+) CD11b(+) macrophages. In order to block the recruitment of TIMs, we tested a potent CSF1R inhibitor, PLX3397. Cultured primary murine T cells exposed to PLX3397 with a broad range of concentrations (0.1 to 50 M) showed no evidence of cytotoxicity by MTS assay. We then tested the combination of PLX3397 and ACT in vivo using two models. In the first one, SM1 cells stably expressing the chicken ovalbumin (OVA) antigen were implanted in C57BL/6 mice.

However, recent lines of preclinical and clinical evidence indicate that proimmune effects of radiotherapy can be synergistically augmented with immunostimulatory monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to act both on irradiated tumor lessions and on distant, non-irradiated tumor sites. The combination of radiotherapy with immunostimulatory anti-PD1 and anti-CD137 mAbs was conducive to favourable effects on distant non-irradiated tumor lesions as observed on transplanted MC38 (colorectal cancer), B16OVA (melanoma) and 4T1 (breast cancer) models. Immunotherapy and radiotherapy synergized both when irradiation was given using external beams or provided with brachytherapy. The therapeutic activity was crucially performed by CD8 T cells, as found in selective depletion experiments. The irradiation regimen induced immune infiltrate changes in the irradiated and non-irradiated lesions featured by reductions in the content of effector T cells, Tregs, and myeloid-derived supresor cells (MDSC), while effector T cells were expressing more intracellular IFN gamma in both the irradiated and contralateral tumors. Importantly, 48h following irradiation CD8+ TILs showed brighter expression of CD137 and PD-1 thereby displaying more target molecules for the activity of the corresponding monoclonal antibodies. Likewise, PD-1 and CD137 were induced on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes from surgically excised of human carcinoma lessions that were irradiated ex-vivo. These findings advocate for clinical development of immunotherapy combinations with anti-PD1 plus anti-CD137 mAbs that can be synergistically accompained by radiotherapy strategies on treatable lesions, even if leaving disease outside the irradiation field.']",

        "Background":"['The PD-1/PD-L1 (programmed cell death protein 1; programmed death-ligand 1) pathway plays a key role in immunological tolerance and autoimmunity. PD-1 is primarily expressed on activated T and B cells while its receptor, PD-L1, is expressed in a variety of cell types including resting lymphocytes, DCs, and macrophages. Recently, multiple human solid tumor types (melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, ovarian, and colorectal cancer) have been found to overexpress PD-L1 within its tumor microenvironment. More importantly, PD-1/PD-L1 blocking agents (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, lambrolizumab, MPDL3280A) have been found active as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy and some have produced durable clinical responses. On the other hand, human epithelial tumors are also known to overexpress the high-affinity folate receptor (FR)-alpha that is capable of bringing folate-linked drugs into the cell cytosol via endocytosis. Using flow cytometry, we assessed PD-L1 expression in various FR-positive syngeneic mouse tumor models (M109, Renca, L1210A, 4T1-Cl2, ID8-Cl15). PD-L1 expression was found to vary significantly among different tumor types and could be found not only on CD45- malignant cells but also on tumor stromal cells such as F4/80+CD11b+ tumor-associated macrophages. Using a rat anti-mouse PD-1 antibody (clone RMP1-14), we studied in-vivo efficacy of a folate-targeted chemotherapy in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 blockage in PD-L1-expressing tumor models. In syngeneic models with high PD-L1 expression and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, a synergistic and curable anti-tumor effect was observed and the animals developed tumor-protective immunity against rechallenge.

        "Background":"['Alteration of the epigenetic landscape of immune cells can modify the pattern of gene expression, thus resulting in phenotypic and functional changes. Small molecule inhibitors targeting epigenetic modifiers, such as histone deacetylases (HDACs), have been shown to reduce tumor growth. Besides promoting direct anti-tumor effects, HDAC inhibitors also target immune cells and alter their gene regulation. Here, we demonstrate that the HDAC6 selective inhibitors ACY-241 and ACY-1215 (ricolinostat) decrease the function of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and T regulatory (Treg) cells, maintain an effector phenotype by CD8+ T cells, and do not reduce viability of immune cells. First, peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from melanoma patients were treated with ACY-241, and the phenotype of MDSCs was assessed. Expression of the suppressive molecules ARG1 (p<0.01) and NOS2 (p<0.05) was decreased in CD14+HLA DR lo CD11b+ and CD14+HLA DR lo CD33+ MDSC populations, suggesting less potent MDSCs. To gain insight into other suppressive populations, we evaluated the phenotype and function of Treg cells derived from melanoma patients. Cultures of CD3+ T-cells treated with ACY-1215 or ACY-241 resulted in decreased expression of FOXP3 and reduced frequency of Tregs (CD4+CD25+CD127-; p<0.001). ACY-1215 pre-treated Tregs exhibited less suppressive activity against responding conventional T-cells in standard assays, compared to Tregs pre-treated with DMSO control (p<0.01). CD3+ T-cells exposed to ACY-241 or ACY-1215 were activated via CD3/CD28 co-stimulation to assess effects on cytokine production. Selective HDAC6 inhibition shifted T-cell differentiation towards Th1-type (Tbet+) over Th2-type (GATA3+), compared to DMSO (p<0.05). Additionally, Th2 cytokines (e.g. IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13) were significantly decreased (p<0.05). In accordance with decreased Th2 differentiation, mTORC signal transduction, including phosphor-SGK1, was similarly reduced (p<0.05). Targeted inhibition of mTORC signaling (i.e. SGK1 inhibitor) recapitulated decreased Th2 cytokine production (p<0.05). In order to address effector immune function, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were harvested from melanoma biopsies and expanded in vitro in the presence of ACY-1215 or ACY-241, and IL-2. Measuring CD45RA, CD45RO, CD62L and/or CCR7, an accumulation of central memory CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells was observed (p<0.05). Activated TILs treated with ACY-241 or ACY-1215 displayed higher expression of IFN-gamma and CD107a.

Recent evidence has shown that anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy restores the function of exhausted effector T cells and augments antitumor immune responses. The expression of PD-L1 has been best studied as a biomarker for the anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Because PD-L1 expression on tumor cells is induced by IFN-γ which is mainly produced by effector T cells, induction of antitumor effector T cells in cancer patients could be an important for the anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Indeed, previous studies have suggested that the increase of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes is the predictive biomarker for PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy. We and others have demonstrated that lymphodepletive therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, induce tumor-specific effector T cells from naïve T cells. Naïve T cells rapidly proliferate and elicit memory-like functions after lymphodepletion (homeostatic proliferation). These findings indicate that lymphodepletive regimens could augment the antitumor efficacies of the anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. In the current study, we transferred naïve T cells into mice after whole-body irradiation or chemotherapy. These mice were inoculated s.c. with PD-L1+ B16F10 melanoma cells or PD-L1- MCA205 fibrosarcoma and then were treated with anti-PD-1 mAbs. Lymphodepletion by whole body irradiation, but not cytotoxic agents following the transfer of naïve T cells significantly enhanced antitumor immunity of anti-PD-1 mAbs. This augmentation required both of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, but not NK cells. Further experiments revealed that immune cells infiltrating MCA205 expressed PD-L1. Transfer of naïve T cells from IFN-γ knockout mice abrogated the enhancement of antitumor effects of anti-PD-1 mAb therapy by lymphodepletion.

        "Background":"['Introduction', ' Hu14.18-IL2 (APN301, Apeiron Biologics) is an immunocytokine (IC) consisting of human IL2 linked to each IgG heavy chain of the hu14.18 mAb, which recognizes the GD2 disialoganglioside. Phase 2 clinical trials of IV hu14.18-IL2 IC in neuroblastoma and melanoma are underway, with activity already demonstrated in neuroblastoma. We have previously shown that intratumoral IC treatment (IT-IC) results in enhanced anti-tumor activity in mouse models. These studies were designed to determine the mechanisms involved in the enhanced activity and to provide justification for future clinical testing of localized IT administration of this and other immunocytokines. Methods', ' We characterize tumor growth, survival outcomes, histology and phenotype of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) by flow cytometry of IT-hu.14.18-IL2 treatment of A/J mice bearing subcutaneous NXS2 neuroblastomas. Looking at these parameters, IT-IC treated mice are compared to IV-IC treated, IT PBS treated and untreated mice. Data', ' Mice receiving IT-IC show significant increases [by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and by flow cytometry] of NKp46+ Natural Killer (NK) cells and CD8a+ cytotoxic T cells in TIL populations compared to control tumor-bearing mice. Improved survival and inhibition of tumor growth are observed in mice receiving IT-IC vs. untreated mice or mice receiving IV-IC. Comparisons within treatment groups, or independent of treatment groups, show that the number of NK or CD8 T cells in the tumor correlates inversely with change in tumor size. Analyses by IHC and flow-cytometry show greater IC detection in tumor after IT-IC vs. IV-IC. Moreover, IT-IC results in improved IC retention in tumors and increased NKG2D effector receptors on intratumoral NKG2A/C/E cells and on CD8 T cells when compared to control mice or mice receiving IV-IC. The augmented NKG2D seen in TILs was not seen in spleen cells, supporting the localized nature of the intratumoral changes induced by this treatment. Conclusions', ' In this murine neuroblastoma model, enhanced antitumor effects of IT hu14.18-IL2 compared to IV hu14.18-IL2 are distinguished by increased activated TILs and IC retention, improved survival and inhibition of tumor growth. These observations suggest that localized administration of immunocytokines in human patients may show analogous advantages over IV administration. In accordance, we have designed a phase I/II clinical trial protocol investigating the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and efficacy endpoints of intratumorally administered hu14.18-IL2 in stage III/IV melanoma patients with recurrent or refractory disease, and are working towards approval for its activation.

Tumoral expression of nitrotyrosines (NT), a marker of peroxynitrite activity in tissues, has been shown to suppress antitumor immune response in prostate cancer by negatively affecting tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and has emerged as a poor prognostic factor in breast cancer and melanomas, leading to the development of inhibitors of key enzymes involved in NT formation (inducible nitric oxide synthase [iNOS] and arginase [ARG] isoforms). The present study aimed to investigate the prognostic impact of NT expression in a formerly published cohort of unselected surgically resected NSCLC pts. Methods', ' NT expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in TMA sections including 447 surgically resected NSCLCs with known MET gene copy number status by FISH. All cases were assessed in triplicate. IHC results were scored from 0 to 3+ according to staining intensity. Results', ' NT IHC was successfully performed in 442 pts with the following results (n/%)', ' 0 (17/3.9), 1+ (230/52.0), 2+ (173/39.1), 3+ (22/5.0). Pts were grouped as NT+ (2-3+) and NT- (0-1+). No significant association was observed between NT status and clinicopathological characteristics, including sex, smoking status, stage, histology and grade, although female patients tested more frequently negative than positive (64% vs 36%). Interestingly, MET FISH+ pts had a higher probability of having an NT+ score (p=0.044), when compared with MET FISH- subjects. Overall survival was significantly longer in NT+ vs NT- pts, with a 5-year survival of 51.0 vs 38.1 months (p=0.025, log rank test). Multivariable analysis corrected for stage and MET gene status, previously reported as significant prognostic factors in this cohort, confirmed that NT+ pts had a lower risk of death when compared with the NT- group (HR 0.72, p=0.021, Cox model).

At our institution, adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) has resulted in a durable median OS of 52 months in patients with metastatic melanoma. Immune-mediated anti-tumor responses have been previously shown in bladder cancer, therefore we investigated the phenotype and function of TIL expanded from bladder tumors to establish feasibility of ACT for the treatment of bladder cancer. Methods', ' Tumor specimens, including primary bladder tumors and lymph node metastases, were collected from 29 bladder cancer patients having standard of care tumor resection, who also had consented to an IRB-approved protocol for TIL generation. The tissue was minced into fragments, placed in individual wells of a 24-well plate, and propagated in high dose IL-2 for four weeks. TIL were considered expanded if they propagated to fill 2 wells. The remaining tumor material was digested into a single cell suspension and frozen. TIL were phenotyped by flow cytometry and assessed for autologous tumor reactivity through co-culture with tumor digest and IFN-gamma ELISA. Results', ' Transitional cell bladder tumors were cultured from 23 patients, of whom 19 (83%) demonstrated TIL expansion. Microbial contamination precluded TIL growth in six specimens. TIL were cultured from 9/12 (75%) patients with preceding chemotherapy and 10/11 (91%) who were chemotherapy naive. Expanded TIL were predominantly CD3+(median 63%, range 10-87%) with a median of 30% CD8+ T cells (range 5-70%). Eight of 15 tested samples (53%) contained TIL that secreted IFN-gamma in response to autologous tumor. Conclusions', ' The study establishes the practical first step towards an autologous TIL therapy process for therapeutic testing in patients with bladder cancer. Human bladder cancer tissue can be used to expand tumor-specific TIL in vitro. TIL were also expanded from patients that received chemotherapy prior to tumor resection.

After decades of research, patient-derived TIL populations have been successfully re-infused into melanoma subjects, and have produced impressive treatment effects in a subset of cases. To date, the successful generation and usage of TIL populations for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients has not been reported. Generating TILs from NSCLC tissue presents several challenges, as immune cell populations residing within the lungs are constantly exposed to numerous inhaled antigens and other particulate matter.Here, we report the successful generation of TILs from three NSCLC specimens from subjects undergoing surgical resection for curative intent. Six distinct lung cancer tissue fragments were cultured in the presence of IL-2 for each of the three cases. Each fragment yielded a TIL population, although their proliferative rates differed substantially. Each TIL population was subjected to flow cytometry to identify the cellular subtypes, and these results were compared to the lymphocyte subset content measured in the original in vivo tumor specimen. Preliminary findings suggest that the ability to generate CD8+ enriched TILs is dependent upon the CD8+ content present in vivo. Low CD8+ content was associated with an abundance of either Tregs or NK cells. Greater than 70% of the CD8+ populations generated displayed an effector phenotype (CCR7-CD45RA+), regardless of the overall cellular composition of the specimen. However, these cells displayed heterogeneous levels of exhaustion markers (PD1, Tim3), which inversely correlated with proliferative rates.Our results show that TIL populations can be successfully generated from primary human NSCLC specimens. Although the relative cellular content differed for each tissue fragment, we were able to generate at least one CD8+ effector population with low levels of exhaustion for each case. In vitro and in vivo studies to determine the tumor killing capacity of these TIL populations are currently underway.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",

Methods', ' Comprehensive genomic profiling was performed on 374 advanced solid tumor samples. Targeted sequencing was performed on 562 cancer associated genes, and analysis of matched tumor-normal DNA was performed to filter out germline variants and identify true somatic mutations. Samples with greater than 17 mutations were considered SM based on extrapolation from other reports and considering the number of genes interrogated by our panel. Results', ' Our analysis revealed that 13% (48/374) of tumors were significantly mutated, exhibiting 17 or greater nonsynonymous mutations occurring in a wide variety of solid tumors including but not limited to lung, CRC and melanoma. Over 90% of mutations were either frameshift, missense or splice site alterations, which may result in tumor-specific neoantigens and increased amounts of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Loss of function mutations in MMR genes indicative of MMR deficiency which has been associated with increased response to immune checkpoint blockade were present in 21% (10/48) of SM cases. Mutations in polymerase e (POLE), indicative of high neoantigen load, were identified in 17% (8/48) of SM cases. Genes in SWI/SNF pathway were mutated in 65% (31/48) of SM cases, which included loss of function mutations in ARID1A. Mutations in DNA repair genes, including homologous recombination, base excision and nucleotide excision repair pathway, were noted in over half of the cases with the hypermutant phenotype.

        "Background":"['Breast cancer is a major cause of death in women in the UK and worldwide. It is now widely recognized that many cancers, including breast, elicit immune cell engagement resulting in immune responses directed against over-expressed or aberrantly presented antigens. A greater understanding of these interactions has had significant effects in improving the prognosis in other tumor types e.g. melanoma, but has not been extensively studied in breast cancer. Here we aim to build disease-relevant in vivo models of breast cancer that recapitulate the immune-tumor microenvironment found in patient tumors.Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) are in vivo pre-clinical models derived from transplantation of patient tumor material into severely immunocompromised hosts. These models recapitulate major clinicopathologic features of patient tumors and represent the breadth of diversity in phenotype and genotype found across breast cancer. These PDX models can be studied in order to further our understanding of intrinsic tumor cell biology and response to treatment. However, as these tumor models are maintained in severely immunocompromised hosts, we cannot study the relevant interactions between tumor and immune cells. In order to address this, we have established humanized PDX models.We have developed a humanized triple-negative breast PDX model in NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice. The experimental set-up is based on those successfully used to identify novel antibody-based therapeutic strategies in melanoma (Karagiannis et al 2013). The PDX tumor is established by orthotopic transplantation into the inguinal mammary fat pad. The host is then engrafted with human immune effector cells (peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) isolated from healthy volunteers). Following tumor development, host and tumor tissues are processed for flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry (IHC). We observe a 40% engraftment of human immune effector cells in host spleens following transplantation and tumor development by flow analysis. We also observe human CD45+ leukocyte populations in the tumor, blood and other organs. Tumor-infiltrated lymphocytes expressed the immune checkpoint phenotype of patient cancers. We are now investigating the subtypes of immune effector cells present our model, whether novel antibody-based therapies can be used to block tumor formation, and how immune checkpoint molecules are modulated. We are currently testing new PDX models for their capacity for humanization by immune effector cells.Our over-arching aim is to determine whether these models can recapitulate immune responses directed against tumor antigens in order to study the mechanisms of action and efficacy of novel therapeutics to treat breast cancer. Humanized pre-clinical PDX models could be a feasible approach to accelerate therapeutic discovery relevant to impacting tumor and immune stromal interaction for patient benefit.']",

More than 150,000 people in the U.S. will die from lung cancer this year which will lead to roughly as many deaths as breast, prostate, colon, and pancreatic cancers combined. Lung cancer is also of global concern as tobacco and cigarette use, a significant known risk factor, in developing countries have risen significantly. Stage II and III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients often have a 5-year disease free survival of less than 50% even after surgical resection and post-operative chemotherapy and a dismal 5% overall survival for patients with stage IV metastatic disease. Even with the advent of PD-1/PDL-1 checkpoint blockade immunotherapies, only about 20% of patients are responsive to the treatment. This limited scope of success may be due to our lack of understanding the immune landscape of NSCLCs. Therefore, we set out to characterize the immune composition from surgical lung resections via flow cytometry. We found that NSCLCs have a diverse set of checkpoint inhibitor and co-stimulatory molecules expressed by T cells, including PD-1, TIM-3, and TIGIT. Interestingly, even though PD-1 was elevated compared to a normal donor, the expression level was lower than either breast or melanoma tumor samples. We also discovered that PD-1 heavily correlates with co-expression of other checkpoint inhibitor molecules. In our regulatory T cell analysis, FoxP3+ populations have a profound presence in these lung tumors suggesting there is a highly suppressive environment for tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Our lung resection screenings furthermore suggests a dynamic range of both frequency and proportion of CD3-CD56+ natural killer (NK) cells. Finally, our data indicates there is a large population of CD11b+CD33+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the tumors, with varying degrees of arginase-1 expression, a functional marker for MDSCs. Altogether, these findings in concert suggest there are potential goldmine of opportunities to target molecules on different immune cell populations. This multi-modal approach, directing combination of immunotherapies that influences multiple immune compartments yet complement each other, may have significant implications for future clinical studies.']",

The NGFR is truncated to render it incapable of eliciting intracellular signaling and will serve as a control for T cell trafficking since human T cells do not express NGFR. Patients have mandatory biopsy prior to lymphodepletion and then at day 21 to allow for assessment of chemokine levels and quantification of CXCR2 and NGFR transduced T cells. There are 5 dose levels of infused CXCR2 transduced cells to be studied including 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 x 109 T cells. Currently 3 patients out of a planned 36 have been enrolled and treated. The primary objective is to determine the safety and toxicity of CXCR2 transduced TIL. Secondary objectives include assessing if CXCR2 transduction enhances TIL ability to migrate to tumors. Levels of CXCL1 and CXCL8 in tumor tissue will be assessed and correlated with tumor localization of CXCR2 transduced TIL and clinical outcomes. Clinical trial information', ' NCT 01740557.']",

        "Background":"['Our approach involves a platform of killing cancer using more potent oncolytic viruses-based immunotherapy strategies. These replication competent adenoviruses are targeted to the Rb pathway to generate tumor-selectivity. The second generation of these therapeutic agents, Delta-24-RGD, was successfully translated to the clinical setting and is currently been tested in Phase I studies in several institutions in the USA and in Europe for the treatment of patients suffering from recurrent gliomas. Preliminary data from these clinical trials showed that 10 to 15% of Delta-24-RGD-treated tumors undergo complete regression. Agonistic treatments targeting co-stimulatory tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF), such as GITR (CD357), have been shown to enhance the proliferation and activation of T cells. Moreover, in preclinical tumor efficacy studies, these agonistic signals have shown potent tumoricidal activity. Different from antibodies, co-stimulatory ligands can be easily incorporated into replication competent oncolytic adenoviruses. Infection of cancer cells with these armed viruses will lead to the expression in their cell membranes of the co-stimulatory molecule that will directly interact with the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes to amplify and enhance the anti-tumor T-cell activity. In this study, we have developed an armed Delta-24-RGD carrying the cDNA of the mouse GITRL, Delta-24-GREAT. Treatment of glioma-bearing mice with intracranial injection of Delta-24-GREAT increased mice survival (P < 0.0001, long-rank test) and inhibited lung cancer growth in subcutaneous models. Infection of the tumor elicited an inflammatory response increasing the populations of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells versus treated controls. Importantly, 2 weeks after the adenovirus treatment a subset of brain hemispheric cells were positive for GITRL. In addition, co-culture experiments with tumor cells infected with viruses and splenocytes isolated from treated glioma-bearing mice demonstrated a response against the cancer cells as assessed by ELISA analyses of IFN-γ. Demonstrating the generation of anti-tumor memory, the surviving animals did not show evidence of tumor growth after re-challenging with GL261 glioma cell implantation in the contralateral hemisphere. However, survivors of GL261 tumors did not survive after the re-challenge was performed by intracranial implantation of B16/F10 melanoma cells, strongly indicating that the immune response was specific for GL261 glioma antigens. This is the first study with an oncolytic adenovirus expressing GITRL and our results strongly indicate that oncolytic adenoviruses armed with molecules of the TNFRSF may be of future clinical interest for the treatment of patients with cancer.']",

However, there has been still a little evidence of the correlation of tumor immunosuppression and CAFs in human esophageal carcinoma. The other hand, as like rising of PD-1 antibody targeting therapy to tumor immunosuppression have been shown dramatic cure responses in melanoma and now ongoing to other malignancies. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are considered typically to represent a host immune response against carcinoma. In many types of tumors TILs have been shown their strong correlation to patient's clinicopathological features. In this study, we evaluated the prognostic correlation of CAFs and TILs, which are classified respectively in tumor-associated CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) in surgically resected esophageal carcinoma.Materials and methods\", ' Total 58 cases with esophageal carcinoma in our institution were evaluated for the presence of CAFs and TILs by immunohistochemistry. TILs of CTL and Treg were calculated each in the intratumoral and the peripheral tissues, and the cutoff for subgroups was defined at the median value. CAFs were defined as fibroblasts expressing alpha smooth muscle actin (-SMA), and evaluated with the -SMA scoring by using Area Index, which is calculated by imageJ. TILs and CAFs were assessed for the associations with pathological invasion depth (pT), lymph node metastases (pN), histological types, and disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS).Result', ' In intratumoral tissues, Treg was significantly associated with advanced T stages, and Treg and a CTL/Treg ratio were associated with lymph node metastasis. Higher CTL, higher CTL/Treg ratio and lower Treg were significantly associated with improved DFS and OS in univariate analysis. Furthermore, multivariate analysis demonstrated selected higher CTL as an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.010). On the other hand, in peripheral tissues, CTL, Treg, and CTL/Treg ratio were not correlated with clinicopathological factors or the any prognosis. Additionally the overexpression of CAFs was strongly associated with poor prognosis (P = 0.002) and the Area Index of -SMA was inversely correlated with the CTL and CTL/Treg ratio in intratumoral tissues (P = 0.029, 0.017). It suggests that CAFs accumulation in tumor tissue is correlated to status of intratumoral immunesuppression.Conclusion', ' The CTL in intratumoral tissues are independent prognostic factors, and are considered to play an essential role in tumor immunity. Our results demonstrate that CAFs are significant correlation of immunosuppression in esophageal carcinoma. In the future, targeting CAFs therapy itself might improve tumor immunosuppression, and there is possibility to prolong a prognosis.']",

        "Background":"['BACKGROUND', ' Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) accounts for 95% of pancreatic cancers and constitutes the fourth leading cause of cancer related death worldwide. In contrast to other malignancies, PDAC is highly resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Additionally, few immunotherapies are currently available because this malignancy was thought to be poorly immunogenic. Recent studies have shown that infiltration of immune cells in biopsies of PDAC patients correlates with improved clinical outcome. Nevertheless, tumor cells can elude the immune system through several inhibitory mechanisms including the expression of immune checkpoints. These are a plethora of molecules that can either boost or dampen the T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling.

The service offers molecular profiling for patients with resectable or metastatic disease, in preparation for their next treatment plan. Patients are eligible to enroll at any institution, clinic, or cancer center in the US. Biopsies, tissue retrieval and testing is coordinated by Perthera, Inc.From 6/2014 to 11/2015 tumor biopsies, resected or archived tissue was obtained from 152 (53% male) pancreatic cancer patients and profiling including NGS/FISH (144 patients) and IHC (143 patients) was performed. The median age at biopsy or resection was 63 (25-83), 55% of the tissue came from liver, 16% from pancreas, 7% lung, 4% peritoneum, and 18% from another type of tissue. 87% of the patients were diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and the remaining with another form of confirmed or suspected pancreatic cancer.The most identified pathogenic mutations were KRAS (85%), TP53 (72%), CDKN2A (47%), CDKN2B (24%), SMAD4 (22%), ARID1A (10%), STK11 (7%), and BRCA2 (5%). The average number of genomic alterations (likely but not confirmed to be somatic) detected was five per patient from a panel of 320 genes. Molecular modifications that are linked to a treatment option were observed in 44% of patients. Twenty four of 144 patients (17%) had mutations in at least one DNA repair gene potentially benefiting from platinum or PARP inhibitor-based therapies, including BRCA2 (5%), ATM (4%), BAP1 (4%), SMARCA4 (3%), FANC (1%), CHEK2 (1%), and PALB2 (<1%). Other actionable molecular phenotypes observed include anti-HER2 therapies targeting ERBB2 amplifications (3%) and mTOR inhibitors suitable for patients with mutations in STK11/LKB1 (7%), PTEN (3.5%), PIK3R1 (<1%), or PIK3CA (3%). Actionable alterations identified with a low frequency (<2%) include RET fusions, amplifications of FGFR, CRKL, AXL, and mutations in NTRK3, MEN1 (PNET), and BRAF. One patient harbored the BRAF V600E mutation, prompting consideration of off label melanoma-approved therapy. Overexpression of ALK by IHC was observed in one patient who chose to enroll in a ceritinib clinical trial. Six percent of patients were PDL-1 positive, and 22% were positive for PD-1 from tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, suggesting possible activity from immune checkpoint inhibitors.To date, 7 of the 152 patients have enrolled in a clinical trial, 4 were treated with an off label treatment, 67 have yet to make their next treatment decision, and 53 are known to be deceased. KYT has successfully profiled tumors and presented targeted treatment options to patients and physicians in 33 states regardless of a patient's socioeconomic background and geographic location, moving the field a step closer towards a democratized, personalized approach to treating pancreatic cancer.\"]",

        "Background":"['Adoptive cell therapy with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) has been successfully used as a treatment in metastatic melanoma. However, TIL are not present in the majority of solid cancers. To overcome this barrier, T cells can be transduced with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) to produce tumor specific T cells for adoptive immunotherapy. CD19 CAR T cell therapies have demonstrated activity against B cell malignancies in both pre-clinical and clinical studies, but CARs targeting solid tumors have been less active in clinical trials and we observed less success when targeting solid tumors with GD2 CAR therapies in preclinical models. We hypothesize that the observed difference in anti-tumor efficacy may be due to 1) a more hostile microenvironment within solid tumors compared to hematologic malignancies, and/or 2) variable CAR potency. To normalize for differences in CAR potency we created a CD19 expressing osteosarcoma cell line, thus allowing use of the well-characterized CD19 CAR to explore the susceptibility of solid malignancies to adoptive immunotherapy.The GD2 expressing 143B osteosarcoma cell line was transfected to express CD19 (143-CD19) and susceptibility to GD2 and CD19 CAR therapies was compared. 51Cr release experiments demonstrated that both GD2 and CD19 CAR T cells were similarly cytolytically active against 143B and 143B-CD19 cells, respectively. The in vivo susceptibility was then compared using two xenograft models. NSG mice were injected IM with 5e5 143B or 143B-CD19. The first was an early treatment model, where 3 days following tumor inoculation, mice received 5e6 GD2 CAR, CD19 CAR or mock T cells IV. In mice treated with GD2 CAR T cells, no difference in tumor growth or survival was observed. However, mice inoculated with 143B-CD19 and treated with CD19 CAR T cells showed improved survival (p<0.01) and complete eradication of their CD19+ disease. CD19 CAR T cells were next tested in a late treatment model', ' NSG mice were injected with 1e6 143B-CD19. On day 19, mice were treated IV with 1e7 CD19 CAR or mock T cells. By day 28, tumors of CD19 CAR treated mice had shrunk to 50% the size of day 19 tumors, while mock treated mice had progressed to 2 cm x 2 cm (p<0.01). Thus, the CD19 CAR induced impressive regression of established >1 cm x 1 cm 143B-CD19 tumors. We further observed that human solid tumors expand murine myeloid derived suppressor cells in this system, which bear a hallmark phenotype and suppress human T cells. We conclude that despite the presence of an immunosuppressive solid tumor microenvironment, appropriate choice of antigen and CAR design can lead to regression in established solid tumors. Our ongoing work focuses on using this platform to more clearly define the CAR T cell characteristics that correlate to anti-solid tumor efficacy in vivo, as well as explore how modulating the immunosuppressive solid tumor microenvironment can enhance efficacy of otherwise ineffective CAR treatments.']",
