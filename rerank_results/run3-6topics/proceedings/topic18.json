In cancer, tumors evade the immune system by the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 receptor on activated T lymphocytes. This interaction forms the basis for the use of PD-1 inhibitors in cancer immunotherapy. The purpose of this study is to investigate differences in expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells and PD-1 receptor on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) between metastatic uveal melanoma (MUM) and metastatic cutaneous melanoma (MCM). Methods', ' Biopsy specimens of MUM and MCM patients were analyzed for PD-L1 and PD-1 expression at a CLIA-certified lab (Caris Life Sciences). PD-L1 expression on melanoma cells was confirmed using validated, immunohistochemical cell-surface staining with an anti-PD-L1 antibody (SP142, positivity  5% tumor cells). PD-1 expression on TILs was confirmed using the anti-PD-1 antibody (MRQ-22, positivity  1 TILs per high-power field). In total, 106 MCM and 18 MUM specimens were analyzed for PD-L1 expression, while 89 MCM and 17 MUM specimens were tested for PD-1 expression. Results', ' Overall, 22/106 (20.8%) MCM specimens expressed PD-L1 (Table). The highest rate of expression was seen in lung metastasis. Interestingly, all 6 of the metastatic liver lesions showed no PD-L1 expression. In comparison, none of the uveal melanoma specimens showed PD-L1 expression. PD-1 expression was seen in 68/89 (76.4%) and 9/17 (53%) of MCM and MUM specimens, respectively. Conclusions', ' While PD-1 expression was seen in both MUM and MCM, there was a stark difference in PD-L1 expression between them (20.8% vs. 0%; p = 0.04). A complete absence of PD-L1 expression by MUM tumor cells might explain the lack of therapeutic response to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition and suggests an alternative mechanism via which it evades the immune system.

        "Background":"['Introduction', ' The therapy of metastatic melanoma (MM) was radically changed by the introduction of BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi). Even if highly effective in the short term, patients invariably develop resistance in the long term. For this reason other inhibitors as well as alternative or complementary therapeutic strategies are being tested in these patients. Among the immune checkpoint targets of clinical importance is PD-1, which is expressed by T cells and which binds to the PD-L1 ligand, which may be expressed by melanoma cells. We and others showed that PD-L1 is an independent negative prognostic marker for patients with MM.Methods', ' BRAFi-/MEKi-resistant melanoma cell lines were generated by treating cells with increasing concentrations of BRAFi or MEKi. Resistance, viability and aggressiveness were analyzed by MTT, migration and wound healing assays. Results were confirmed using xenograft models. Resistant cell lines were compared using RNAseq to identify enriched genetic pathways involved in the resistance. Luciferase reporter assay analysis was used to study the direct interactions between the PD-L1 and miR-17-5p.Results', ' By comparing responses to BRAFi in PD-L1+ and PD-L1- variants of the A375 cell line, we found that PD-L1 expression conferred resistance to BRAFi or MEKi. Conversely, silencing of the molecule restored sensitivity to these drugs. Resistant melanoma cell lines acquired PD-L1 expression and were characterized by a specific genetic profile, with the modulation of genes controlling cell movement and immune responses. Consistently, these cells showed a more aggressive behavior both in vitro and in xenograft models. PD-L1 silencing in resistant cells decreased invasive properties and restored expression of HLA-II molecules.PD-L1 up-regulation was only partly dependent on the paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway, which characterized resistant cells. In addition, we found that resistance to BRAFi and MEKi down-modulated miR-17-5p, which showed an inverse correlation with PD-L1. Transfection of miR-17-5p into BRAFi-resistant cell lines induced the down-modulation of PD-L1, reduced the aggressive behavior of the cells and partially restored sensitivity to BRAFi. Finally, in the plasma of patients with MM, miR-17-5p was inversely correlated with expression of PD-L1 in the tumor tissue.Conclusions', ' These data demonstrate a direct link between expression of PD-L1 and resistance to BRAFi, as well as to a more aggressive behavior of melanoma cells. Furthermore, we define a novel post-transcriptional circuit responsible for PD-L1 up-regulation, based on a direct interaction between miR-17-5p and PD-L1 mRNA. Lastly, miR-17-5p plasmatic levels show an inverse correlation with PD-L1 expression by tumor cells, suggesting that they may be useful in monitoring disease outcome and drug sensitivity.']",

        "Background":"['Melanoma is an aggressive malignancy with a relatively high metastatic rate, responsible for almost 60% of lethal skin tumors. Although many human cancers such as melanoma express tumor antigens recognized by T cells, host immune responses often fail to control tumor growth for mostly unexplained reasons. Escaping immune destruction is one of the tenets of tumorigenesis; there have been several studies suggesting an important role of PD-1/PD-L1 (B7-H1) interactions in inhibiting the effector functions of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte in tumor. Ghebeh et al., reported that doxorubicin treatment caused decrease in cytosolic B7-H1 and increased nuclear translocalization in breast carcinoma (Breast Cancer Res. 2010;12(4)', 'R48). It is unknown whether differential cellular expression of PD-L1 contributes to the pathogenesis of melanoma. To address the role of PD-L1 and its receptor PD-1 in different stages of malignant melanoma, we have performed semiquantitative immunohistochemical analysis of PD-L1 and PD-1 in benign nevi (n=59), primary melanomas without metastasis (n=22) or with metastasis (n=17), and melanoma metastases (n=32 cases). Benign nevi had significantly higher levels of nuclear PD-L1 immunopositivity (p=0.004) and low levels of PD-1 protein expression (p=0.002). With progression from benign nevi to primary melanoma there was an increase in cytoplasmic positivity for PD-L1 (p=0.03). Also, a significant positive correlation was observed between the percentage of positive cells (p=0.0007) and intensity (p=0.0009) for PD-1 in primary melanomas. Although there was no significant difference in PD-1 levels in between primaries with or without metastasis, a trend was observed for PD-L1 expression', ' primaries with metastasis having a larger number of tumor cells with cytosolic localization than primaries without metastasis (p=0.07). Interestingly, primary melanomas without metastasis showed significantly larger number of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) cells having intense immunoreactivity for PD-L1 protein than did metastatic melanomas (p=0.03). In conclusion, differential cellular localization of PD-L1 protein and high levels of PD-1 protein correlates with disease progression and high-risk histologic features in melanoma and might partially explain the resistance of melanoma cells against the immune system.']",

        "Background":"['Knowledge on the regulatory pathways involved in melanoma development and progression has advanced significantly in recent years. It is now recognized that multiple signaling pathways that affect motility, growth control, invasion, metabolism, cytokine release and the ability to escape the immune response, regulate melanoma development. Silencing of SOCS-1 protein, a negative regulator of Jak/Stat pathway, leads to partial reversion of the tumorigenic phenotype of B16F10-Nex2 melanoma cells. SOCS-1 silencing with shRNAi inhibits in vitro growth by cell cycle regulation with S phase arrest and increased size of cells and nuclei. It also inhibited tumor cell migration and invasion. Down-regulation of SOCS-1 decreased the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (mainly the phosphorylated-R), Ins-R, and fibroblast growth factor receptors. Based on the results of SOCS-1 silencing, the present work aims at analyzing the expression of proteins relevant to tumor development, searching for signaling pathways related with SOCS-1. A protein microarray analysis of murine melanoma cells silenced for SOCS-1 by shRNAi SOCS-1 lentivirus transduction was undertaken using as controls, cells transduced with the empty vector. Among the 614 differentially expressed genes some cytokine/growth factor receptors were down regulated, e.g. c-kit, met and EphA3. Western blotting of B16 shR-SOCS-1 cell extracts showed a significant decrease in the expression of these receptors, indicating that SOCS-1 positively regulates the MAPK pathways in these cells. We analyzed the main MAPK pathways that were up regulated in melanoma and observed a decrease in the phosphorylation of mediators of ERK1/2 and p38 pathways and of STAT3 (S727). These results demonstrate that SOCS-1 can play an important role in tumor development and progression up regulating a number of growth factor receptors in murine melanoma cells. Interestingly, p-CREB (S133) was up regulated in the SOCS-1-deficient B16F10-Nex2 cells. In vivo experiments showed that using a prophylactic protocol, the subcutaneous immunization of syngeneic mice with B16 shR-SOCS-1 viable cells, rendered a protective effect against subcutaneously grafted and metastatic murine melanoma, with significant reduction in tumor growth and metastates in the lungs. A flow cytometry assay showed decreased expression of PD-L1 at the surface of B16 shR-SOCS-1 cells. This might explain the protective effect of subcutaneous immunization with these cells, rather than with wild-type B16F10-Nex2 cells that overexpress PD-L1, which negatively regulates T-cell immune response. Down regulation of PD-L1 is compatible with inactive ERK. The present results show the important role of SOCS-1 in murine melanoma stimulating cell growth and migration, allowing for the invasive phenotype.']",

        "Background":"['Novel therapies that target the PD-1/PD-L1 axis have shown great potential to improve survival for patients with advanced melanoma. However, there are limited predictive biomarkers to identify patients who may respond to this class of agents. Previous studies suggest that a subset of responders to PD-1/PD-L1 targeting therapies have expression of PD-L1 in tumor biopsies. The development of these predictive biomarkers is complicated by intratumoral heterogeneity across primary and metastatic lesions for PD-L1 expression. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are one potential source of tumor samples for serial analysis. An integrated CTC capture and analysis technology known as the VERSA (Versatile Exclusion-based Rare Sample Analysis) platform permits evaluation of CTCs at the protein, DNA and mRNA level for biomarkers of both therapeutic response and resistance. Using this platform, we have developed a method to isolate circulating tumor cells from patients with advanced melanoma. Using a cocktail of capture monoclonal antibodies including targets of CD146, GD2 and NG2, we have recovered cells across multiple cell lines with high efficiency. Using single antibody capture of SK-Mel-28 cells, capture was 52%, 54%, and 45% with CD146, GD2 and NG2 targets respectively. However, when using a cocktail of capture antibodies containing CD146, GD2 and NG2, capture increased to 92%. Similar results were obtained with other melanoma cell lines including, 624 and M21 cell lines. Cells were also stained for PD-L1 as a potential predictive biomarker of response to PD-L1 and PD-1 targeting immunotherapies.

        "Background":"['Selinexor is a SINE (Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export) compound that has been administered to >1000 cancer patients in Phase I and II trials to date, with evidence of efficacy and tolerability. This small molecule targets exportin-1 (XPO1), a key nuclear export protein with >200 cargo proteins which include both tumor suppressors and cell cycle modulators. As a result, selinexor blocks nuclear export of proteins including IB, NFAT1c, STAT1 and STAT3, which regulate expression of the inhibitory T cell receptors CTLA4, PD1 and its ligand, PD-L1. We hypothesized that selinexor would upregulate T cell checkpoint molecule expression, and thereby enhance the anti-tumor activity of antibodies targeting PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA4. Human (A375, CHL-1) and murine (B16F10) melanoma cell lines expressed high levels of PD-L1 protein at baseline, and PD-L1 expression was induced following selinexor treatment in numerous other tumor cell lines (including HCT-116, MDA-MB-468, MV-4-11, OVCAR-8, and PC-3). Examination of lymphocytes revealed that selinexor also increased expression of PD-1 and CTLA4 by 2-fold. Mice bearing syngeneic B16F10 melanoma tumors treated with selinexor (15 mg/kg 2 x weekly) and anti-CTLA4 (250 g, 2 x weekly) demonstrated a significant reduction in tumor growth rate (p = 0.0065) while monotherapy had no significant effect on tumor growth. Similar results were obtained in mice bearing B16F10 melanoma treated with the combination of selinexor + anti-PD-1 (200 g, 2 x weekly, p < 0.034) or selinexor + anti-PD-L1 (100-200 g, 2 x weekly, p < 0.001). Importantly, no weight loss or signs of toxicity were evident in any in vivo study. Further immunophenotypic analyses have been completed in animals receiving selinexor alone or in combination with anti-PD-L1. In combination treated mice, we observed a significantly increased percentage of splenic NK cells (p  0.050), and a significantly increased percentage of splenic Th1 T cells (p0.011), all compared to vehicle treated mice. Interestingly, combining selinexor with anti-PD-L1 significantly decreased the percentage of splenocytes that expressed PD-L1 (p<0.001). These changes are indicative of increased anti-tumor immune activity; however, they were accompanied by significantly increased percentages of myeloid cell subsets in combination treated mice (p  0.050). The immunologic significance of this myeloid cell expansion is currently under investigation. These data indicate that the efficacy of selinexor may be enhanced by disrupting immune checkpoints in effector cells (T and NK cells).

While p53 is inactivated by point mutations in many tumors, melanomas rarely harbor mutations in the p53 gene. Here we report the biological role of miR-18b in melanoma via targeting the MDM2-p53 pathway. Expression of miR-18b was significantly suppressed in melanoma specimens and cell lines by virtue of hypermethylation, and was re-induced in melanoma cell lines following 5-AZA-deoxycytidine treatment. Lower levels of miR-18b expression in primary melanoma were associated with significantly reduced overall survival. MDM2 was identified as a target of miR-18b action, as miR-18b significantly suppressed the luciferase activity of a reporter plasmid containing the 3UTR sequence of MDM2 complementary to the miR-18b seed sequence. Induction of miR-18b expression in melanoma cells resulted in reduced MDM2 expression, upregulation of p53 as well as PUMA and p21, and suppression of the anti-apoptotic BCL2 and BCL-XL genes, resulting in significant suppression of melanoma cell proliferation. The effects of miR-18b overexpression on the p53 pathway and on melanoma cell growth were reversed by MDM2 overexpression. Stable overexpression of miR-18b produced potent tumor suppressor activity, as evidenced by suppressed melanoma cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and reduced tumor cell growth in vivo.

SiRNA inhibition of VEGFR-2 expression abrogated these EMMPRIN effects. EMMPRIN regulation of VEGFR-2 was mediated through the over-expression of HIF-2 and its translocation to the nucleus where it forms heterodimers with HIF-1.

They demonstrate a novel mechanism by which EMMPRIN promotes tumor progression through HIF-2/VEGFR-2 mediated mechanism, with an autocrine role in melanoma cell malignancy. As VEGF/VEGFR2 system has been implicated in regulation of melanoma cells migration, proliferation and apoptosis, the role of EMMPRIN in the regulation of these cellular properties was investigated.

The present study thoroughly examines the functional relevance of miR-126 in melanoma progression and suggests a central role of this miRNA as prognostic marker and modulator of the melanoma microenvironment. Initially, the expression of miR-126 was quantified in two independent, isogenic cell line model series of melanoma progression. To further explore its functional role, two stable over-expression cell lines were generated and subjected to an extensive series of in vitro assays. Subsequently, the prognostic relevance of miR-126 was assessed via in situ hybridization on a large melanoma tissue microarray cohort. In both melanoma cell line systems, miR-126 expression was inversely correlated with the level of tumorigenicity. Over-expression of miR-126 in vitro resulted in a significant decrease in colony formation, both in the presence and absence of anchorage, while cell viability remained unaffected. Using a three-dimensional spheroid invasion assay, over-expression of miR-126 significantly reduced cell invasiveness. In addition, a substantial reduction in tumor cell adhesion to VCAM-1 coated micro-channels was observed when the adhesive capacity of miR-126 over-expressing cells was examined under shear stress using the Cellix's Microfluidic Platform. Using in situ hybridization on tissue microarrays containing melanoma tissue, miR-126 expression was evident in the tumor vasculature whereas melanoma cells did not appear to express miR-126. Analysis of the degree of vascular staining revealed a significant association between lower vascular miR-126 expression and lower T-stage. In addition, high vascular miR-126 scores were significantly associated with prolonged overall survival, in particular in high grade tumors (T-stages 3 and 4). Overall, miR-126 over-expression was shown to trigger a less aggressive phenotype in melanoma cells in vitro. Nonetheless, its clinical relevance in melanoma may primarily be mediated by the tumor vasculature. Depletion of miR-126 has previously been linked to a number of tumor relevant phenotypes, including inflammation. Vascular up-regulation of the miR-126 target protein VCAM-1 may mediate increased tumor infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages, which are known to play a crucial role in tumor development and prognosis.

We and others have observed a cooperative interaction between RT and various immunotherapies, which appears dependent on the relative sequencing of each therapy. We reported a synergistic interaction between RT and the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) response to tumor-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) in murine melanoma. We reported enhanced cooperative effect when immunotherapy is administered 6-10 days after RT compared to administration on days 1-5 or 11-15. We hypothesized that this might reflect a delayed, transcriptionally-mediated effect of RT on the expression of tumor markers of immune susceptibility. In this study, we investigated the effect of RT on a variety of immune susceptibility markers at both transcriptional and post-translational levels to explore mechanisms behind the observed RT-induced changes.We used flow cytometry to examine the time course of phenotypic changes in immune susceptibility markers in B78 murine melanoma cells following in vitro RT. We observed a time- and RT dose-dependent increase in the expression of specific death receptors (Fas, DR5), as well as T cell co-stimulatory/co-repressor ligands (PD-L1, CD80). The timing of these changes correlated with tumor susceptibility to ADCC immune response in vivo. All protein expression changes observed by flow cytometry were found to occur over a similar time course by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), suggesting that RT-induced protein expression changes were mediated by changes in transcriptional activity. Using high throughput qPCR, we observed a similar time course of transcriptional effects in additional markers of tumor cell immune susceptibility, including Fas, MHC I, CD40, and others. We compared the effect of RT on these markers in human and mouse melanoma cell lines and observed a comparable time course for transcript-level changes across species.This study sheds light on the mechanistic basis of time sensitivity in the interaction of RT with ADCC in vivo and suggests opportunities to enhance anti-tumor immune response by combining RT and immunotherapeutic agents. Such findings bear relevance for research investigating the potential role for RT in driving and optimizing the response to various cancer immunotherapies.']",

        "Background":"['Merlin is a cytoskeletal linker protein encoded by the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) gene. Like the other Band 4.1 protein family members, it serves to connect cell surface proteins to the actin cytoskeleton. Defects in the protein caused by mutations of the NF2 gene give rise to NF2 disease, which is generally characterized by the formation of bilateral vestibular schwannomas and, to a lesser extent, meningiomas and ependymomas. In addition to these tumor types, merlin has been shown to be mutated and/or merlin protein expression lost in other cancers including mesothelioma, thyroid cancers, and melanomas, albeit to a lesser extent. In the current study, we set out to elucidate the role of merlin in the progression of human melanoma. We first show that merlin knockdown enhances melanoma cell migration and invasion in vitro. Furthermore, we show that decreased merlin expression leads to increased subcutaneous melanoma growth in immuno-compromised mice. Tumors derived from merlin knockdown cells display border regions that are generally less well defined, with cases in which tumor cells are visible in the surrounding dermis and adipose tissue, which is consistent with the more invasive phenotype observed in vitro upon merlin knockdown. To compliment these knockdown experiments we overexpressed merlin in a metastatic melanoma cell line. Upon increased merlin expression, the melanoma cells exhibit decreased in vitro migration, invasion, and proliferation. These cells also display a diminished ability to form anchorage independent colonies in soft agar. Additionally, increased merlin expression inhibits in vivo subcutaneous growth of the melanoma cells in our xenograft experiments. Lastly, we surveyed several signaling pathways to identify a mechanism that exerts the negative regulatory effect of merlin on melanoma growth. We found that merlin protein levels in human melanoma cells are correlated with the extent of induced activation of the known tumor suppressors in the Hippo signaling pathway, MST1/2 Ser/Thr kinases, which have been shown to function downstream of merlin in other cell types. Taken together, these results provide evidence for the first time that merlin is a negative regulator of human melanoma progression and that it may exert its inhibitory effects through the activation of the MST1/2 kinases.']",

Ulceration has been correlated with an increased risk of death within a given thickness range, however, the biologic basis for the development of ulceration is poorly understood. Livin, an inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP), is overexpressed in various cancers and possesses both the ability to protect from cell death and to promote it once it is cleaved. It is unknown whether there is a differential cellular expression of livin in ulcerated versus non-ulcerated melanomas. Methods', ' To explore the role of livin in relation to ulceration, other clinicopathological factors and survival of melanoma patients, we have performed semiquantitative immunohistochemical analysis of livin expression as measured by percentage and intensity (levels) of cells immunoreactive for livin in tumor specimens having both ulcerated and non-ulcerated areas from 50 melanoma lesions. Results', ' Superficial as well as deep melanoma cells located in non-ulcerated areas of tumor had higher percentage of cytoplasmic immunopositivity for livin when compared with melanocytes in the ulcerated areas of the melanoma (p<0.0001). We also observed nuclear expression of livin protein in this subset of melanoma patients. Compared to the ulcerated areas, the superficially located melanoma cells from the non-ulcerated areas showed significantly higher intensity of livin immunoreactivity in their nuclei (p = 0.048) but not those from the deep non-ulcerated areas (p = 0.32). Ulcerated melanomas with low tumor stage (I/II) had higher percentage of tumor cells with nuclear livin expression than those from higher tumor stage (III/IV) (p = 0.002). Interestingly, we observed that patients with higher intensity of cytosolic expression of livin protein in the ulcerated area of tumor were more likely to have a brisk tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) response (p = 0.001). Patients with higher intensity of cytoplasmic livin protein of tumor cells in ulcerated areas had higher risk of death compared to those with lower levels (p = 0.005). On the other hand, patients with higher intensity of cytoplasmic expression of livin in melanoma cells located superficially in the non-ulcerated areas of tumor had better prognosis (p = 0.045). Conclusion', ' Our data indicate that there is a decrease of nuclear as well as cytoplasmic expression of livin protein in melanoma cells from ulcerated when compared to non-ulcerated areas. Also, cytoplasmic livin expression is an indicator of poor prognosis, but apparently only in patients with ulcerated lesions. Although IAPs regulate caspases, they also regulate signaling pathways that activate NF-B modulating immunity.

Our objective is to characterize cell-surface GRP78 in melanoma and determine whether immunoconjugates against GRP78 are a viable treatment strategy. We have demonstrated that cleavage of ER GRP78 by Subtilase (SubAB), a GRP78-specific protease, sensitizes melanoma cell lines of different genotypes to melphalan, vemurafenib, and temozolomide. Our data indicate that SubAB cleavage of GRP78 sensitizes melanoma cells to melphalan and vemurafenib.

We have previously published that these antibodies target GRP78+ mouse melanomas in a syngeneic mouse melanoma model. These GRP78 scFv-SubA fusion proteins are internalized by cell-surface GRP78 and the SubA moiety cleaves ER GRP78 inside the cell, leading to tumor cell sensitization to chemotherapeutics, and in some instances, tumor cell death. To determine the mechanism by which ER GRP78 cleavage sensitizes melanoma cells to chemotherapeutics, the NH2-terminal 28 kDa and COOH-terminal 50 kDa SubA cleavage products were overexpressed in melanoma cells, and pull-down experiments were performed to identify binding partners. Microarray analyses were also performed on chemotherapy-treated and GRP78 scFv-SubA fusion protein-treated melanoma cells to obtain a broad view of cellular events that occurred subsequent to ER GRP78 cleavage by SubAB or GRP78 scFv-SubA fusion proteins.

Almost half of patients develop distant metastatic disease, most often in the liver, even after the tumor-bearing eye is completely removed. The key to understanding and targeting uveal melanoma metastasis is in understanding how circulating tumors cells exit the bloodstream at distant sites of metastasis, and then invade and colonize distant organs. To address the first process, transendothelial migration, we modeled the blood vessel wall using primary human microvascular endothelial monolayers grown on polyacrylamide substrates that mimic the physiological stiffness of normal tissue. To these monolayers, we added 92.1 and OCM-1A uveal melanoma cells, and then collected time-lapse movies using spinning-disc confocal and differential interference contrast microscopy to follow the transmigration of the uveal melanoma cells. We found that both cell lines transmigrate through endothelial monolayers by a route distinctly different from the paracellular migration we see for trafficking immune cells. During this multistep process, uveal melanoma cells first identify paracellular junctions and then intercalate between endothelial cells, taking on a flattened morphology and maintaining contacts with their adjacent endothelial cells; reminiscent of vasculogenic mimicry. Tumor cells then extend invasive projections beneath adjacent endothelial cells, before eventually migrate under the endothelium. Immunofluorescence revealed cortical actin networks with strong cortactin staining within these invasive projections. To visualize these structures better, we transfected uveal melanoma cells with F-tractin, a fluorescent fusion protein that specifically binds filamentous actin without disrupting actin function, that allows imaging of actin dynamics in live cells. Time-lapse confocal images revealed complex actin-rich projections invading and sampling the interface between the endothelial monolayer and the substrate. Dynamic actin cytoskeletal reorganization was also apparent as cells migrated under the monolayer. Previous studies have linked inactivating mutations in BAP1 to metastatic spread of uveal melanoma in patients. To test whether BAP1 loss plays a role in transendothelial migration, we knocked down BAP1 expression in our uveal melanoma cell lines. We found that BAP1-depleted cells transmigrated significantly faster through endothelial monolayers in transwell assays than control knockdown cells. Time-lapse movies showed no significant differences in the first steps of initiation or intercalation between BAP1 knockdown and control cells. These studies identify a novel mechanism of transendothelial migration in uveal melanoma cells and suggest that BAP1 depletion specifically affects the ability of cells to invade under and exit the monolayer.']",

By means of immunosuppression, melanoma, as well as many other cancers, is able to resist anti-cancer immune reactions. To understand the mechanisms how tumor cells escape from the anti-tumor immune response is the key for efficient treatment strategies. In several cancers, programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) -mediated pathways have been shown to suppress anti-tumor immune responses. Our aim was to investigate the number of tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and Tregs in benign, premalign and malign melanocytic lesions to find out if the density of these cells is associated with the tumor stage or survival in melanoma. Moreover, the expression of PD-L1 was studied. Altogether 187 tissue samples, including 29 benign and 27 dysplastic nevi, 16 in situ melanomas, 38 superficial (Breslow < 1 mm) and 43 deep (Breslow > 4 mm) melanomas and 34 lymph node metastases, were stained immunohistochemically for CD68 and CD163 representing all TAMs and M2-like macrophages, respectively and for FoxP3, a marker for Tregs. In addition, a part of the FFPE -samples was dual stained for CD68 and PD-L1. Macrophages and Tregs were counted using a hot spot -method. In the statistical analyses, the cell numbers were graded as either low or high according to the median. Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the macrophage numbers in different groups and Pearson chi-square test to study the correlations between the numbers of CD163 and CD68 -positive cells and clinicopathological parameters. CD68+ and CD163+ macrophage numbers were significantly higher in malign melanocytic lesions and lymph node metastasis compared to in situ melanomas and benign nevi. In deep melanomas and lymph node metastases macrophages located mainly inside the tumor nests whereas in thin melanomas they were mostly scattered around the tumor. High CD68+ macrophage number correlated with the presence of ulceration (p=0.011) and with both local recurrence (p=0.008) and recurrence with distal metastases (p=0.002). PD-L1 immunoreactivity was relatively scanty in melanoma samples being restricted to certain areas only; both membraneous and cytoplasmic staining was observed. Overall, the staining was higher in deep melanomas and lymph node metastases compared to superficial melanomas. Dual stainings indicated that in addition to tumor cells, a part of the tumor infiltrating CD68+ macrophages were PD-L1 -positive. The density of FoxP3+ cells did not correlate with the tumor stage.

We sought to identify the molecular switch controlling the regulatory effect of MSC on melanoma cell growth and migration. Methods. MSC from BM of Notch1Flox/Flox mice were cultured in MesenCult media. Deletion of the Notch1 gene was achieved by transduction of MSC with Cre/Lentivirus. The role of Notch1-/ vs. Notch1+/+-MSC in modulating human melanoma cell behavior in vitro was examined by testing the effect of conditioned medium (CM) of MSC on melanoma cell growth and migration using MTT and Transwell cell migration assays, respectively, and by counting the number of DsRed-melanoma cells in melanoma-MSC co-culture assay using flow cytometry. The downstream targets of the Notch1 signaling in MSC were screened by genome-wide gene microarray analysis. Expression of selected target gene was confirmed by immunoblotting assay. The biological function of the selected target in mediating the regulatory effect of the Notch1-/MSC on melanoma cell growth and migration was examined through the reconstitution of target gene expression in Notch1-/MSC and evaluated by testing the direct effect of supplemented recombinant protein encoding the target gene on melanoma cells. The mechanism underlying the regulatory effect of the Notch1 target on melanoma cell mobility was analyzed by PCR-Array specifically focused on exploring cell migration. Results. Notch1-/MSC, either by CM or in co-culture, had little effect on melanoma cell proliferation, while the CM significantly promoted melanoma cell migration. Global gene expression profiling of Notch1-/ vs. Notch1+/+-MSC by microarray identified Wnt-induced secreted protein-1 (WISP-1) as a Notch1 downstream target gene. The Notch1 signaling-commanded regulatory effect of MSC on melanoma cell migration is partially mediated by modulating WISP-1 expression, since the CM of Notch1-/MSC promoted melanoma cell motility, while the enhanced motility of melanoma cell was reversed by reconstituted overexpression of WISP-1 in Notch1-/MSC. Consistently, supplement of hWISP-1 inhibited melanoma cell migration, presumably via modulating Cdc42/PAK cascade. Conclusions. Our data reveal Notch1 signaling as a molecular switch controlling the regulatory role of MSC in modulating melanoma cell motility, and demonstrate that melanoma cell behavior can be determined by external signals emanating from the MSC. WISP-1 is a molecular relay in the transmission of Notch1 signaling, and may serve as a molecular target for melanoma therapeutic intervention.']",

Expression of miRNA-211 correlates with expression of TRPM1, a transient receptor potential family member calcium channel protein that we showed to be involved in regulation of melanocyte calcium homeostasis and melanin pigmentation.

We show that ectopic expression of p53 (a tumor suppressor) in melanocytes increase miRNA-211 expression and decrease TRPM1 expression. Inhibition of miRNA-211 did not change TPRM1 expression in melanocytes.

Surgery can be curative in Stage I, II, or III disease, but 75% of patients with deep primary lesions develop extensive recurrence or distant metastases and have dismal prognosis. In fact, there is no curative treatment for stage IV melanoma. Although novel targeted therapies, such as BRAF inhibitors and anti-CTLA4 antibodies are showing promising results in melanoma clinical trials, resistance to these agents and patient relapse rapidly ensue. Therapeutic resistance has been commonly attributed to functional redundancy between intimately hardwired cellular pathways responsible for tumor cell maintenance and survival. In order to avoid redundancy, we propose to directly inhibit the transcription of multiple genes required for the establishment or maintenance of tumors. First, we analyzed the expression of Bromodomain (BrD)-containing proteins, a family of epigenetic readers that bind acetylated lysine. BrDs are present in histone acetyl transferases (i.e. CBP/p300, PCAF, GCN5) and transcriptional regulators (i.e. BET family members', ' BRD2, 3, and 4). mRNA expression arrays showed several BrD-containing genes as upregulated in primary and metastatic melanoma cell lines compared to normal melanocytes. Analysis of available expression profiles also revealed higher levels of BRD2 and BRD4 in melanoma tissues relative to nevi or normal skin (P<0.001). Furthermore, immunohistochemistry staining of a melanoma tissue microarray confirmed overexpression of BRD4 protein in primary (P<0.001) and metastatic tumors (P<0.001) compared to nevi. BRD4 knockdown using siRNA or shRNA suppressed the proliferation and colony formation capacity of several metastatic melanoma cell lines. Moreover, melanoma cells stably infected with shBRD4 carrying lentivirus displayed reduced tumor growth in vivo compared with their counterpart infected with a non-silencing control. To identify cellular pathways modulated by BrD inhibition and to investigate the mechanism(s) that might mediate its anti-proliferative effects, we conducted a global transcriptome analysis (RNA sequencing) of 6 melanoma cell lines treated with specific BrD inhibitors or vehicle. Gene ontology analysis of these data revealed enrichment in genes controlling cell cycle, growth and proliferation. Accordingly, cell cycle analysis demonstrated a specific G1 phase arrest upon BRD4 silencing. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that expression of several BrD containing proteins is dysregulated in melanoma and that BRD4 represents a promising therapeutic target in these tumors.

Using human A375 and WM793 mouse xenografts, we consistently observed a significant increase of HIF-1 expression in many live tumor cells by Immunohistochemistry. This distinct feature confirms that some melanoma cells exist under hypoxia in vivo. We hypothesize that melanoma cells survive under hypoxic conditions due to unique growth and survival pathways, which are likely to alter their sensitivity to current therapeutics. We employed a three-dimensional (3D) culture system with an inorganic nanoscale scaffolding (SCIVAX NanoCulture Plate, NCP), to mimic part of the in vivo system. Human B-RAF(V600E) mutated melanoma cell lines, 451Lu, A375, and MEL1617, were confirmed to form spheroids with NCP in standard RPMI medium with 5% FBS under normoxic incubator conditions. The majority of melanoma cells in spheroids were identified as hypoxia as indicated by the hypoxic probe LOX-1. The fluorescence of LOX-1 is quenched by oxygen and increased in response to low levels of oxygen, which was consistently negative in parallel monolayer cultures of these same three melanoma cell lines. Furthermore, cells within the melanoma spheroids differentially expressed HIF-1 and VEGF, at both mRNA and protein levels; also both were undetectable in monolayer cultures in all three tested cell lines. Using this system, melanoma spheroids and 2D-monolayer cultures were treated with the B-RAF(V600E) inhibitor, Vemurafenib. Then the cell viability and expression of signaling markers were compared between 2D and 3D cultures. Data from our MTT assays indicated that the 3D melanoma spheroids were more resistant to Vemurafenib than 2D-cultured cells by 20-30% in all three tested cell lines. We then employed a human phospho-kinase array (R&D System) to study multiple kinase pathways related to hypoxia, and found that the phosphorylated c-Met was significantly increased in 3D melanoma spheroids than 2D-cultured cells, and was confirmed by western blot. This data suggested that hypoxia drove c-Met activation in melanoma spheroids. By employing preclinical c-Met inhibitor in 3D culture, we found that it significantly prevent 3D-spheroid formation (4060%) and HIF-1 expression. Combined, evidence suggested that hypoxia drove c-Met activation and resistance to Vemurafenib in melanoma cells of 3D spheroids, which may partially reflect the cellular signature of melanoma cells under hypoxia in vivo. Taking advantage of the ability of c-Met inhibitor preventing melanoma spheroid formation, we proposed that combination of c-Met inhibitor and Vemurafenib was a potential therapy strategy to overcome resistant melanoma cells under hypoxia in patients.

Thus, since these molecules do not function in isolation, we need to consider tissue pleiotropy and the expression of co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory molecules on tumor tissue. Our laboratory has characterized and established five primary patient derived melanoma cell lines, MEL-2, MEL-V, 3MM, KFM and GLM-2. In an effort to understand tumor tissue pleiotropy, we conducted a comprehensive expression pattern screening of eight co-inhibitory and ten co-stimulatory molecules by RT-PCR. Among others, VISTA, a CD4+ T cell suppressor, HVEM, an immune evasion regulator, LAG3 and TIM3, potential immune checkpoint targets, were seen to be differentially expressed in these primary cell lines. Current therapies target CTLA-4, PD-1 and PD-L1, which also exhibit varying expression in our primary cell lines, pointing to the importance of considering tissue expression of these molecules when administering these novel immunotherapies. Additionally, 80% of melanoma patients are positive for the BRAFV600E genetic lesion and are administered vemurafenib (PLX4032), an inhibitor of the overactive mutated BRAF. Our in vitro studies show that treatment with PLX4032, changed the expression of CTLA-4 and PD-L1 in these primary cells. We observed a decrease in PD-L1 protein expression in MEL-V and GLM-2 and an increase in PD-L1 protein expression in MEL-2 and KFM, the four BRAFV600E positive cell lines. CTLA-4 protein expression demonstrated an upward trend on treatment with PLX4032. This synergy observed between treatment with drugs targeting genetic lesions and the expression of immunomodulatory molecules warrants characterization of tumor biopsies prior to designing an effective combinatorial therapy regime. Our long term goal is to optimize combinatorial immune and drug therapies directed against both co-stimulators and checkpoint inhibitors.']",

        "Background":"['Metastatic melanoma is a highly aggressive skin cancer with a poor prognosis. The current lack of effective therapies for treating metastatic melanoma exemplifies the desperate need for the identification of new targets and the development of new therapies. Nodal is an embryonic signaling molecule from the TGF superfamily that is not typically expressed in adult tissues but is reactivated in a number of aggressive cancers including melanoma, and breast and prostate carcinomas. In a study recently published by our group, we determined a connection between the Notch and Nodal pathways in aggressive melanoma. We identified a specific correlation between the expression of Notch4 and Nodal in aggressive melanoma cell lines and in advanced stage human melanomas. By inhibiting Notch4 expression or function, we established a link between Notch4 and Nodal signaling in promoting the aggressive phenotype of metastatic melanoma cells in vitro. Notch4 regulation of Nodal expression was identified as important in cellular plasticity, since inhibition of Notch4 function impaired the ability of aggressive cells to engage in vasculogenic mimicry (de novo formation of vascular-like networks by non-endothelial tumor cells). Notably, vascular-like network formation could be partially rescued by recombinant human Nodal, suggesting both pathways are important for this phenomenon. To extend our published observations, we utilized neutralizing antibodies to Notch4 and to Nodal, and compared gene expression profiles. From this, we identified a mechanism of feedback between signaling pathways that controls the expression of components of both pathways, including Nodal, Notch4, and the Notch ligand, Jagged2. Since Notch4 is enriched in the subpopulation of cells that form vascular-like networks in melanoma, we specifically analyzed the expression of angiogenesis signature genes previously associated with vascular-like network formation, and determined that inhibition of Notch4 or Nodal function downregulates a large group of these genes including members of the VEGF, angiopoietin, MMP, and cadherin families. We are currently investigating the hypothesis that the Notch4-Nodal signaling axis may be a master regulator of the vascular-like phenotype in aggressive melanoma cells. We suggest that inhibition of Notch4 and/or Nodal function may offer a potential molecular targeting strategy for metastatic melanoma therapy.']",

Previously, we found a strong correlation between loss of TRIM16 expression and disease progression in two human cancers', ' neuroblastoma and squamous cell carcinoma of skin. Moreover, TRIM16 acted as a tumor suppressor in both cancers through effects on cell cycle and migration. Here we examined the potential role of TRIM16 as a tumor suppressor in melanoma.We found that the endogenous TRIM16 expression level in seven melanoma cell lines was significantly lower than in normal human melanocytes. Overexpression of TRIM16 reduced cell viability and proliferation in multiple melanoma tumor cell lines assessed by the Alamar Blue assay, compared to empty vector controls (P < 0.01). Overexpression of TRIM16 also decreases cell migration and induces apoptosis in melanoma cells. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that TRIM16 expression is decreased in human metastatic melanoma tissue samples (Stage 3 and 4) compared to dysplastic compound nevi and primary melanomas (n=91). Most importantly, we have demonstrated that high TRIM16 expression is a favourable prognostic marker of survival (P=0.025) in a cohort of 170 melanoma patients with lymph node metastases. Median survival was 59 months in the high TRIM16 expression group (n=64), compared to 16 months in the low TRIM16 expression group (n=106). We also show overexpression of TRIM16 in melanoma cells lines induced interferon-beta 1 (IFNB1) mRNA expression, and IFNB1 expression is required for inhibition of cell proliferation by TRIM16. IFNB1 expression was also reduced in human metastatic melanoma tissue samples (n=91), and positively correlated with TRIM16 expression in patient samples.

        "Background":"['Despite recent success of the BRAF kinase inhibitor vemurafenib in the clinic, nearly all of those treated follow a course in which initial tumor regression was followed by eventual relapse, which constitutes a major barrier to long-term therapeutic management of melanoma. We have identified a novel mechanism of microenvironment-mediated drug resistance that arises from the release of TGF from melanomas that lack PTEN expression leading to the recruitment of host fibroblasts and the generation of a protective microenvironment through autocrine and paracrine fibronectin secretion facilitating therapeutic escape. Preliminary studies show that BRAF V600E mutant melanoma cell lines that lacked PTEN expression dramatically increased their secretion of TGF- following vemurafenib treatment, as detected by western blot, immunofluorescence and ELISA assays. Furthermore, autocrine TGF secretion initiated with vemurafinib treatment stimulated the upregulation and secretion of fibronectin in PTEN- cells. The vemurafenib-mediated ECM remodeling in this case was dependent upon autocrine TGF signaling and could be attenuated following pre-treatment with the TGF receptor kinase inhibitor SB505124 or by siRNA knockdown of TGF receptor I. A mass spectrometry based phospho-proteomic screen in conjunction with innovative network modeling approaches suggested that increased integrin 51 signaling was a key adaptive response of PTEN- melanoma cells to BRAF inhibitor therapy. The importance of increased fibronectin expression and integrin 51 signaling in the therapeutic escape of PTEN- melanoma cells was confirmed by the significant increases in vemurafenib-induced apoptosis observed following siRNA knockdown of either integrin 5, 1, or fibronectin expression. A mass spectrometry screen (LC-MRM) of 18 BH3 proteins demonstrated Mcl-1 and Bak to be critical apoptosis regulators in the microenvironment-mediated drug resistance response. The importance of PTEN loss and Mcl-1 downregulation in therapeutic escape was validated in PTEN- melanoma cell lines expressing doxycycline inducible forms of PTEN, lipid phosphatase mutant PTEN and Mcl-1. Novel organotypic co-culture models were developed to demonstrate that TGF- released from PTEN- melanoma cell lines activated host fibroblasts leading to the attenuation of drug response in the tumor cells. Our overall hypothesis is that BRAF inhibition remodels both the melanoma and host microenvironments to provide a protective sanctuary for the minor populations of melanoma cells that escape therapy. We postulate that tumor eradication can only be achieved by a dual therapeutic strategy that targets both the bulk tumor and the microenvironment.']",

Therefore, it is of major interest to unravel miRNA networks involved in melanoma progression as, for example, in tumor cell invasion. In order to follow this aim, we established a functional screening approach based on a high-throughput invasion assay using a human miRNA mimics library consisting of 988 miRNAs (miRBase Version 13.0). Applying this strategy, we could identify miRNAs that enhanced the invasive capacity of A375 melanoma cells (oncogenic miRNAs), as well as miRNAs with a lowering effect on invasiveness, latters found predominantly down-regulated in melanoma and thus considered as tumor-suppressors. miR-339-3p was one of the promising candidates which inhibited invasion when transfected into different melanoma cell lines. In addition, miR-339-3p expression was significantly decreased in melanoma cell lines compared to normal human melanocytes. Furthermore, the myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein (MCL-1) was identified as a novel target of miR-339-3p and found to be down-regulated by miR-339-3p both on protein and on mRNA level. MCL1 down-regulation by siRNA could mimic inhibited invasion as observed after miR-339-3p transfection. Our findings indicate that miR-339-3p can act as a tumor suppressor in melanoma and its expression might contribute to the varying degrees of aggressiveness among different melanomas.

Many cancers secrete ATX, and it contributes to their invasive properties. LPA produced by ATX activates LPA1-8 G protein-coupled receptors on the cell surface. Many cancers over-express multiple subtypes of LPAR and the overexpression of LPAR leads to malignant transformation, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. Therefore, ATX-LPA signaling axis is an emerging target for cancer therapy. We have previously shown that knockdown of ATX expression in B16F10 melanoma cells decreased tumor invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo. In this study, we sought to understand the roles of the LPA GPCRs both in the tumor cells and tissues targeted by metastatic cancer cells. Using the in vivo B16 melanoma metastasis model syngeneic to the C57BL/6 mouse strain, we found that the incidence of lung metastasis was greatly reduced in the LPA5KO mice compared to WT, LPA1KO, and LPA2KO mice, respectively. In addition, we found that the selective inhibitor of LPA1&3, Ki16425 also reduced lung metastasis, suggesting that inhibition of LPA5 and LPA1 receptors in the target tissues may prevent cancer metastasis. B16 melanoma cells predominantly express LPA5 receptor. These cells do not invade across a matrigel layer in response to LPA. We found that siRNA knockdown of LPA5 receptors in B16 melanoma cells relieves this inhibition and resulted in an increase in invasion.

Results', ' We observed reduced melanoma growth and tumor-related death in Bgn-/- mice compared to Bgn+/+ mice in two melanoma models.

The prognosis of advanced melanoma remains poor in spite of treatment advances, emphasizing the need to explore additional preventive approaches. One such approach is through the use of mechanism-based dietary intervention. Along this line, various flavonoids that are integral components of human diet are being investigated for their anti-cancer properties. We previously showed that the dietary flavonoid fisetin disrupted Wnt/-catenin signaling and inhibited melanoma growth, both in vitro and in vivo (Syed et al., JID 2011). Neural precursor expressed, developmentally down-regulated 9 (NEDD9) has recently been identified as a novel target of Wnt signaling, and implicated in the progression of several cancers including melanoma. Here, we report that fisetin treatment of melanoma cells resulted in decreased invasive potential of cells associated with suppression of NEDD9 signaling. Treatment of melanoma cells with fisetin inhibited growth and suppressed invasion across the matrigel, as assessed by cell proliferation and invasion assays. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated decreased NEDD9 expression accompanied with loss of Integrin 5 protein expression in fisetin treated cells. Fisetin inhibited the phosphorylation and activation of Src and focal adhesion kinase, important mediators of NEDD9-driven cell migration and invasion. Fisetin treated cells demonstrated a decrease in the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers N-cadherin and Vimentin, with a concomitant increase in E-cadherin. In addition, a significant decrease in the protein expression of matrix metalloproteinases -2 and -9 was observed. To establish that decreased expression of NEDD9 and altered expression of EMT markers correlates with diminished cell proliferation and invasion, we employed a 3-D melanoma skin equivalent model, comprising of A375 melanoma cells, cultured with epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts. The melanoma constructs treated with fisetin for 16 days showed significant decrease in melanocytic lesions as opposed to untreated constructs that showed large nests of tumor cells and many invading disseminated cells. Immunohistochemical analysis showed diminished staining of N-cadherin in fisetin treated sections. In contrast, E-cadherin expression, in the epidermal compartment of the treated constructs was moderate to strong in the radially growing melanomas; however the vertically growing melanomas showed weak E-cadherin expression. These findings indicate that fisetin is capable of targeting pathways mechanistically linked to melanoma progression and invasion. We propose that fisetin has the potential to be developed as an anti-melanoma agent that can be used alone or in combination with other known agents.']",

While durable resistance is mediated frequently by stable alterations intrinsic to the tumor cells leading to ERK1/2 pathway reactivation, the compensatory activation of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) modulates the level of initial response. The composition of the tumor microenvironment likely plays a key role in these compensatory/adaptive responses to targeted inhibitors. In this study, we demonstrate that NRG1 is expressed in fibroblasts, as well as cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) isolated from a mutant BRAF melanoma. Fibroblast derived-NRG1 was able to mediate the enhanced ErbB3 pathway activation in RAF-inhibited mutant BRAF melanoma cells. Furthermore, conditioned medium from fibroblasts and CAFs limits RAF inhibitor cytotoxicity in V600 BRAF-harboring melanomas. Importantly, ErbB3 and ErbB2 targeting antibodies partially reverse the protective effects of fibroblast-derived medium on ErbB3 pathway activation and cell growth properties of mutant BRAF-inhibited melanoma cells. Together, these data demonstrate a requirement for a paracrine-produced factor in the tumor microenvironment to promote resistance to RAF inhibitor in mutant BRAF melanoma and reinforce the idea that targeting ErbB3/ErbB2 signaling may improve the efficacy of RAF inhibitors.']",

While it was previously believed that invadopodia are not required for tumor cell growth, based on studies in monolayer cell culture, more recently we have noted a role for invadopodia proteins in growth in more physiological 3-dimensional (3D) extracellular matrix contexts. From previous work in our lab, the Tks adaptor proteins with 5 (Tks5) and 4 (Tks4) SH3 domains, respectively, were identified as Src kinase substrates and both are essential molecules for functional invadopodia formation in mouse and human cancer cells.Here, we assess the roles of the Tks adaptors in melanoma tumor growth and invasion both in vivo and in vitro. To address the mechanism as to how the Tks adaptors control tumor growth and invasion, in vitro 3D growth assays in collagen I were performed. Knockdown of either Tks4 or Tks5 in C8161.9 or A375 melanoma cells decreased 3D growth in collagen I, a process that also appeared to be dependent upon metalloproteinase (MMP) activity. Interestingly, knockdown of either Tks4 or Tks5 in A375 melanoma cells decreased cell-surface expression of MT1-MMP, a key protease involved in tumor growth and metastasis. In vivo tumor growth and metastasis assays in mice using human and mouse melanoma cells depleted of Tks4 or Tks5 by shRNA revealed roles for the Tks adaptors in both the size and the number of lung metastases. Finally, analysis of a human melanoma tissue array with a Tks5 antibody, and RNAseq data, indicates that Tks5 expression is increased in lymph node and other metastases in comparison to nevi and primary sites.These data suggest that the Tks adaptors control melanoma tumor growth and invasion by regulating invadopodia formation and perhaps also cell surface expression of MT1-MMP, and thus contribute to melanoma progression.']",

ABCB5 confers drug resistance in multiple human malignancies through its actions as a drug efflux transporter. Here, we demonstrate that ABCB5 also regulates melanoma metastasis. ABCB5 monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment significantly inhibited metastasis development in highly immune-compromised NOD-scid IL2Rnull mice carrying fully established human melanoma xenografts, independent of previously reported antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) effects. ABCB5 mAb treatment was well tolerated, as indicated by equal body weights of treated mice and untreated controls. Moreover, ABCB5 mAb also inhibited melanoma cell invasive capacity, suggesting that ABCB5 regulates intravasation and/or extravasation of metastatic tumor cells. Furthermore, the average size of metastatic nodules in ABCB5 mAb-treated mice was significantly smaller than those in isotype control mAb-treated or untreated mice, indicating that ABCB5 also regulates proliferation of disseminated tumor cells. Expression profile analysis revealed that multiple known metastasis-associated genes are regulated by ABCB5.

EZH2 is an epigenetic repressor that plays well-established roles in development. In addition to widespread overexpression in a variety of tumors, the discovery of gain of function (GOF) mutations of EZH2 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma, and melanoma strongly suggests an important function for this histone methyltransferase in cancer. To ascertain the function of elevated EZH2 catalytic activity, we expressed either wild-type EZH2 (WT) or EZH2 GOF mutants in both non-tumorigenic (immortalized epithelial cells) and tumorigenic (melanoma cells) settings. In both systems, EZH2 GOF mutants greatly increased global levels of H3K27me3 and decreased H3K27me2 levels, similar to the epigenetic pattern seen in DLBCL cell lines with endogenous EZH2 GOF mutations.In epithelial cells, expression of an EZH2 GOF mutant caused striking changes in 3D-morphology and gene changes that are indicative of cells that have undergone an epithelial to mesenchymal transition. In the disease relevant melanoma cells, several distinct EZH2 GOF mutants (but not EZH2 WT) caused prominent branching morphology in 3D-culture. Interestingly, these GOF mutants did not affect 2D-cell morphology or proliferation of melanoma cells. Furthermore, catalytic inhibition of EZH2 GOF mutants with a commercially available tool compound attenuated the 3D-phenotype. Importantly, EZH2 inhibition in melanoma cells expressing an endogenous GOF mutation also caused similar changes in 3D-morphology. RNA-seq analysis revealed genes involved in processes such as cell adhesion and axonal guidance that were down-regulated by EZH2 GOF mutants. Finally, melanoma cells expressing ectopic EZH2 GOF mutants formed larger tumors than control cells in mouse xenograft studies.

We did not detect DDA in a panel of melanoma and breast cancer cells, while DDA was present in normal Human Mammary Epithelial Cells and normal Human Epidermal Melanocytes suggesting that a deregulation of DDA metabolism may occur during carcinogenesis. We established that DDA triggered melanoma and breast cancer cells re-differentiation and death in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating its anticancer potency. In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in the cytotoxicity of DDA in melanoma cells. We found that DDA induced a time- and concentration-dependent cytotoxicity with the characteristics of apoptosis in human (SKMEL-28) and mouse (B16F10) melanoma cell lines. DDA induced the impairment of mitochondrial functions and activated the executioner caspase 3. However, caspase inhibitors failed to inhibit cytotoxicity suggesting that other mechanisms were involved. DDA triggered autophagy in melanoma cells and induced an autophagic flux. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of autophagy inhibited DDA cytotoxicity showing that autophagy was involved in the cytotoxicity, which contrasts with the classical involvement of autophagy in tumor cell survival. In the search for cytotoxic effectors, we found that DDA stimulated the re-expression and re-localization of Nur77 (NR4A1) to the mitochondria, and the re-expression of Nor1 (NR4A3) in melanoma cells. We showed that pharmacological inhibition of the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of Nur77, and the knock-down of Nur77 and Nor1, led to the inhibition of the cytotoxic autophagy. This establishes that Nur77 and Nor1 are involved in the induction of cytotoxic autophagy by DDA. Using a combination of molecular modeling, binding, luciferase gene reporter and transcriptional assays in tumor cells, we showed that DDA was a ligand of LXR (NR1H3) and LXR (NR1H2) and a selective modulator of LXR-dependent gene expression. Interestingly, DDA displayed a specific transcriptional fingerprint compared to prototypical LXR modulators. Finally, we found that LXR was required for the stimulation of Nur77 and Nor1 expression by DDA and the induction of a cytotoxic autophagy. Altogether, these data established that the newly identified mammalian steroidal alkaloid DDA is a ligand of LXR that induced cytotoxic autophagy through an LXR-,Nur77- and Nor1-dependent mechanism in melanoma cells. Thus, DDA constitutes a promising drug candidate for melanoma treatment through an original mechanism of action. Since Nur77 and Nor1 expression has been found to be repressed in a number of aggressive tumors, DDA may represent an interesting option for the treatment of cancers expressing LXR.']",

Using data from 135 patients treated with pembro in KEYNOTE-001 (NCT01295827), 88 samples were evaluable for PD-L1 IHC and had central RECIST response data for use in a training set. Samples with obscuring melanin or insufficient tumor were not evaluable. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed. Results', ' The ROC curve was somewhat flat. A score of IHC2 (1% staining) was chosen to optimize the true positive rate (clinical sensitivity) and negative predictive value.

        "Background":"['We have previously shown that the Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor (HDACi) trichostatin A (TSA) can sensitize cancer cells to UV radiation by facilitating the formation of Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) without increasing the levels of HDAC1. Here we show that HDAC9 and HDAC11 are upregulated in response to UV radiation in a number of human melanoma cell lines. Both HDAC9 and HDAC11 have an hnRNP A18 signature motif in their 3UTR. hnRNP A18 is a new regulator of protein translation that can confer growth advantages to tumor cells by specifically increasing the stability and translation of mRNA transcripts harboring its signature motif. Our data indicate that HDAC9 and 11 levels correspond to hnRNP A18 level in response to UV radiation in several melanoma cell lines while hnRNP A18 and HDAC 9 and 11 are not upregulated in response to UV radiation in the normal human fibroblasts Malme cells or the normal melanocytes HEMa-LP. Moreover, clonogenic colony survival assays indicate that melanoma cells expressing higher hnRNP A18 endogenous levels are more resistant to UV radiation than cells expressing lower hnRNP A18 levels. In addition, down regulation of hnRNP A18 prevents HDAC 9 and 11 upregulation in response to UV radiation. Furthermore, overexpression of hnRNP A18 increases further the levels of HDAC 9 and 11 in response to UV radiation. These data suggest that upregulation of HDAC9 and 11 in response to hnRNP A18 activation contribute to UV resistance and may increase sensitization to UV-induced cell killing by HDACi.']",

Prevention of both primary and secondary melanomas requires the development of a melanoma specific multi-valent vaccine. We have been involved in developing a vaccinia virus based vaccine consisting of melanoma cell membrane antigens and integrated vaccinia viral proteins, which serve as a potent adjuvant. This melanoma vaccine, referred to as viral membrane oncolysate (VMO), is composed of five primary cell lines derived from patient tumors each independently infected with vaccinia virus and has been shown to induce anti-cancer immune response in clinical trials. Notable results were obtained in node positive subsets of patients that showed a positive response in survival distribution function suggesting that this preparation is an active therapeutic immunogen but the mechanism of immune activation needs to be elucidated. In order for us to define the immunogens that impart the clinical efficacy of the this melanoma VMO vaccine, it is essential to characterize the primary cell lines with respect to their phenotypic characteristics as well as to define the melanoma antigen repertoire so that effective vaccine strategies can be designed that do not rely exclusively on tumor derived primary cells. Our study reveals that all the five primary cell lines expressed antigens, such as gp100, CD146, and tyrosinase, similar to several commercially available melanoma cell lines although at varying concentrations. In addition, the five primary cell lines demonstrated varying migratory/invasive properties using a Boyden Chamber assay and their tumorigenic potential is being tested in nude mice. The cells were also characterized with respect to BRAF mutations. We observed several similarities between the antigenic profile of the primary and established cell lines as well as some unique characteristics. We conclude that using a combination of defined antigens from primary tumor cells is useful in designing a pan-antigen immunotherapeutic vaccine. This melanoma pan antigen vaccine can be an effective tool in primary prevention of melanoma presumably having the highest clinical efficacy when combined with unique antigens from primary cells.']",

It was postulated that exosomes may facilitate communication within the local microenvironment and the primary tumor, supporting melanoma cell dissemination and early events in metastasis. A gain-of-function mutation of a neuronal receptor, metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (GRM1), when ectopically expressed in melanocytes, was sufficient to induce in vitro melanocytic transformation and spontaneous malignant melanoma development in vivo in a transgenic mouse model. Normal mouse melanocytes transformed with an expression vector containing GRM1 showed production and secretion of exosomes confirmed by electron microscopy, while the parental normal melanocytes showed no detectable presence of exosomes. In light of this data, It was hypothesized that over-expression of GRM1 in melanoma cells normally expressing a moderate amount of the protein, may promote elevated levels of exosome formation, while inhibitors to the receptor or limiting the levels of available ligand may suppress exosome production. Preliminary results demonstrated the working hypothesis is correct. Our earlier studies showed that inhibitors of the receptor modulated GRM1-mediated signaling events interfere with downstream effectors resulting in a decrease in both cell proliferation in vitro and tumor progression in vivo. It is not known if GRM1 acts directly, via its signaling cascade, or by another route, on exosome production regulation, this will be investigated. In addition to the pharmacological inhibitors we will also use a genetic approach with silencing RNA to modulate GRM1 expression levels.']",

        "Background":"['Melanoma, one of the most aggressive cancers with a relatively high propensity for metastasis, is a leading cause of death among young adults. Surgery remains the cornerstone of curative treatment in earlier stages. Once the disease has metastasized the prognosis is grim as metastatic melanoma does not respond to most systemic treatments. The Akt/mTOR signaling, constitutively activated in melanoma, serves as a convergence point for growth stimuli that contribute to the initiation and maintenance of melanoma growth. Accumulating data suggest that natural phenolic compounds including flavonoids, tannins and others play an important role in cancer prevention and treatment. We recently showed that a flavonoid fisetin, found in fruits and vegetables such as strawberries, cucumbers etc. inhibits melanoma cell proliferation in monolayer cell cultures and xenograft mouse model (Syed et al., JID 2011). To establish the relevance of this work to human melanoma, we determined the effect of fisetin on melanoma growth employing a three dimensional (3-D) human skin equivalent melanoma model comprising of A375 melanoma cells, cultured with epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts. The melanoma constructs were treated with fisetin (80 M) every alternate day for 16 days and cross-section of the constructs were taken at four day interval. H&E-stained images of cross-sections of untreated constructs at days 12 and 16 showed nests of tumor cells and many invading disseminated cells. In sharp contrast, fisetin-treated constructs exhibited significantly less melanocytic lesions. Notably, fisetin caused no detectable damage to the keratinocytes, fibroblasts, or skin morphology present in this model. Immunohistochemical analysis of these constructs showed significant decrease in the phosphorylated form of Akt and mTOR proteins in fisetin treated compared to control sections. Western blot analysis of fisetin treated melanoma cell (A375 and 451Lu) monolayer cell cultures further showed a decrease in the protein expression of PI3K (p85 and p110), inhibition of phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, and the downstream targets p70S6K, eIF-4E and 4E-BP1. Fisetin increased the binding of TSC (tumor suppressor complex)-1 to TSC-2 thereby stabilizing TSC-2 and downregulated the protein expression of Rheb, a positive regulator of mTOR signaling. Xenograft studies in mice implanted with 451Lu melanoma cells showed concomitant suppression of Akt and mTOR phosphorylation and upregulation of TSC-1/2, associated with reduced tumor growth in the fisetin treated group. Collectively, our studies indicate that fisetin targets both Akt and mTOR signaling which in turn decreases the viability of melanoma cells. Our data suggest a key role of Akt and mTOR in melanoma progression and identify fisetin as a modulator of these targets. Fisetin, therefore can be a useful agent for slowing the progression of melanoma.']",

        "Background":"['Melanoma is the most aggressive and deadly form of cutaneous neoplasm in the United States, representing a major clinical challenge. Our lab previously demonstrated that the endocannabinoid, arachidonoyl ethanolamide (AEA), induced cell death in non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) cells through the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mediated formation of novel J-series prostamides (PMJs). We were the first to chemically synthesize the primary metabolite, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14 prostamide J2 (15d-PMJ2), which displayed potent and selective cytotoxicity in NMSC cells. As such, we hypothesize that the selective cytotoxicity of 15d-PMJ2 would be observed in other forms of skin cancer, including melanoma. B16F10 murine melanoma cells and nontumorigenic Melan-A cells were treated with different concentrations of 15d-PMJ2 for 24 hours and cell viability was measured using MTS assays. At 5µM, 15d-PMJ2 decreased viability by 63% in B16F10 cells, while Melan-A viability was not affected. To verify that cell death was due to apoptosis, the cleavage of apoptotic markers caspase-3 and PARP was examined by conducting Western blot analysis. 15d-PMJ2 markedly increased caspase-3 and PARP cleavage only in B16F10 melanoma cells. Previous studies in NMSC indicated that 15d-PMJ2 induced ER-stress and apoptosis. To investigate the mechanism of 15d-PMJ2-mediated death in melanoma, we examined ER-stress responses. Melan-A and B16F10 melanoma cells were treated with 5µM 15d-PMJ2 and evaluated for CHOP10 and p-PERK expression by Western blot analysis. B16F10, but not Melan-A cells exhibited a notable increase in CHOP10 and p-PERK expression when treated with 15d-PMJ2. To further examine the role of ER-stress on 15d-PMJ2 mediated apoptosis, B16F10 cells were pretreated with the ER-stress inhibitors salubrinal and 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA). Both salubrinal and PBA decreased activation of caspase-3/7, suggesting that ER-stress plays an important role in 15d-PMJ2 mediated tumor cell death. To determine the anti-melanoma activity of 15d-PMJ2 in vivo, B16F10 allograft tumors grown in C57BL/6 mice were dosed subcutaneously with 0.5 or 5.0 mg/kg 15d-PMJ2 for 5 days. Tumors treated with 15d-PMJ2 exhibited significantly reduced growth and mean weights compared to vehicle and untreated animals. TUNEL analysis of tumor tissues indicated a large presence of necrotic and apoptotic cells in 15d-PMJ2-treated tumors compared to vehicle and untreated tumors. To determine whether 15d-PMJ2 induced ER-stress in vivo, tumors were assayed for p-PERK and CHOP10 levels by immunohistochemistry (IHC). These markers were significantly elevated in 15d-PMJ2-treated tumors. Similarly, the viability of primary patient-derived melanoma cells was significantly decreased by 15d-PMJ2. These findings suggest that the novel prostamide, 15d-PMJ2, possesses potent and selective anti-melanoma activity in vitro and in vivo.']",

It has proven difficult to identify and target single genes or pathways critical to brain metastasis formation. In this work we set out to explore a more global and preventive treatment approach to melanoma brain metastases within an established xenograft model of human melanoma. Mice were injected intracardially under ultrasound guidance and followed for six weeks with whole-body BLI and brain MRI. Tumor-bearing brains, adrenals, ovaries, and femurs were harvested and enzymatically dissociated before three tumor cell samples from each organ were flow-sorted and subjected to RNA sequencing. We developed a combined workflow of several independent computational and statistical analyses based on differential expression, and defined a brain metastasis gene signature of 54 upregulated and 54 downregulated genes. We then queried the Connectivity Map database using our 108-gene signature for candidate drugs, i.e. drugs that induce an opposite gene expression profile in various cancer cell lines. Three of the top ten drugs, already in use for other clinical conditions, showed significant efficacy in monolayer proliferation assays and colony forming assays with two brain-tropic melanoma cell lines and one brain-tropic lung cancer cell line. To examine these results in vivo, we used a highly standardized and predictive model system with automated MRI-based quantification of nanoparticle-labeled cells in the mouse brain following intracardiac injection of human melanoma cells. Treatment was started shortly after verification of comparable tumor cell exposure in the mouse brains and animals were monitored with whole-body BLI and brain MRI. Preliminary results showed promising therapeutic effects with respect to brain metastatic burden and survival, as well as acceptable toxicity profiles. We are currently validating these results on a larger scale in vivo, in other models, as well as applying systems biology and network modeling approaches to explore the fundamental mechanisms of action. Together, our results demonstrate a previously unrecognized potential for drug repurposing in the treatment of patients at risk of developing melanoma brain metastases or with clinically occult micrometastatic disease. Finding new uses for old drugs can greatly expedite translation to clinical practice; thus, further investigations are warranted to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of these therapies.']",

        "Background":"['Melanoma is a lethal skin cancer that is highly resistant to therapy and prone to metastasize to distant organs. The quiescence melanoma stem cells are believed to account for the resistance to therapies. Traditional chemotherapies designed to target fast-proliferative tumor cells tend to miss quiescent stem cells. The escaped quiescent stem cells may accumulate oncogenic mutation from common mutagenic sources and finally lead to tumor relapse. NME1 is a metastasis suppressor gene that inhibits the metastatic potential in melanoma and other cancers. In this study, we focus on the role of NME1 in the regulation of stemness and quiescence of melanoma stem cells. We find that the genesis and growth of stem cell spheroids derived from melanoma cell lines are abrogated after knockdown of NME1. We also find that the mRNA level of several melanoma stem cell markers are elevated when we knockdown NME1. These results suggest that NME1 regulates the survival and stemness of melanoma stem cells. In addition, we demonstrate that melanoma stem cells are heterogeneous in NME1 expression. Specifically, the NME1 expression is markedly elevated in a highly proliferative subpopulation in the spheroids that express the stem cell markers OCT4, SOX2 and SOX10. Conversely, we observe another subpopulation of these spheroids that exhibits low NME1 expression and is non-proliferative. We hypothesize that this subpopulation consists quiescent melanoma stem cells that are more resistance to therapies, and that their quiescent status is controlled by the level of NME1. We are now employing CRISPR technology to separately study potentials in tumorigenesis, metastasis, and therapy-resistance of the stem cell subpopulations.']",

        "Background":"['Cellular senescence, a process in which cells permanently exit the cell cycle, has pleiotropic biological effects. Several lines of evidence suggest that senescent cells within the tumor microenvironment can elicit a pro-inflammatory secretome that promotes cancer initiation and progression. This proinflammatory phenotype differs amongst senescent cells triggered by distinct stimuli; therefore, multiple forms of senescent cells likely exist within the tumor stroma during cancer evolution and treatment. Here, we sought to determine how stromal senescence initiated by clinically relevant treatments would influence melanoma growth. To generate senescent stromal populations, we treated presenescent MEFs (p4) with ultraviolet light (UV), Mitomycin C (MMC), or a CDK4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i). In contrast to p4 fibroblasts, cells treated with UV, MMC or CDK4/6i exhibited cell cycle arrest, increased SA--gal positivity and elevated p16INK4a expression. Pronounced 53BP1 and H2AX foci were only observed in the UV and MMC treated cells, suggesting the CDK4/6i treatment did not induce DNA damage. Profiling of gene expression using a TaqMan mouse inflammation expression panel revealed distinctions amongst the 4 fibroblast lines. Of the senescent cell populations, CDK4/6i fibroblasts showed the highest number of elevated pro-inflammatory transcripts. To define the in vitro paracrine growth effects induced by stromal senescence, melanoma cell lines harboring either Braf600E, Ras, or unknown (wild-type) driver were co-cultured with each fibroblast population. In general, melanoma cells grew similarly on senescent and non-senescent fibroblasts; however, tumor cell growth was genotype-dependent. Notably, CDK4/6i fibroblasts never stimulated additional tumor cell growth in vitro. In contrast, syngeneic transplantations of fibroblasts and tumor cells into immune competent mice revealed that all senescent fibroblasts stimulated tumor growth in vivo. However, whether senescent and non-senescent fibroblasts promoted tumor growth at the same rate was genotype-dependent. Since this is the first study to examine the paracrine effects of senescent stromal cells using an immune competent mouse, we performed IHC for CD45 to assess whether immune cell recruitment differs in the presence of senescent stromal fibroblasts. No increase in CD45 positive infiltrates was observed in the melanoma lines co-injected with CDK4/6i fibroblasts. Together, this work reveals that melanoma growth in response to senescent stromal fibroblasts is genotype dependent, and that this stromal promotion of cancer growth can be accurately assessed only in the context of an immune competent, syngeneic host. Moreover, these data suggest that stromal senescence induced by emerging CDK4/6 inhibitor therapies and/or regimens combining chemotherapy/radiation with immune checkpoint blockade may also promote tumor growth through the paracrine effects of senescent bystanders.']",

Extensive studies have uncovered identified a number of resistance-causing genetic alterations that, which are acquired upon continued drug exposure. However, little is known about the changes in gene expression programs changes during the critical time before drug resistance is manifested on at the genomic level. These changes may lead to adaptive drug resistance and hence, represent vital mechanisms by which tumor cells survive the acute drug insult prior to acquisition of resistance-causing mutations.

Recent evidence has shown that anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy restores the function of exhausted effector T cells and augments antitumor immune responses. The expression of PD-L1 has been best studied as a biomarker for the anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Because PD-L1 expression on tumor cells is induced by IFN-γ which is mainly produced by effector T cells, induction of antitumor effector T cells in cancer patients could be an important for the anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Indeed, previous studies have suggested that the increase of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes is the predictive biomarker for PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy. We and others have demonstrated that lymphodepletive therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, induce tumor-specific effector T cells from naïve T cells. Naïve T cells rapidly proliferate and elicit memory-like functions after lymphodepletion (homeostatic proliferation). These findings indicate that lymphodepletive regimens could augment the antitumor efficacies of the anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.

Recently a role for myosin-Va in tumor cell migration, invasion and metastasis has been described for cancer cell lines from lung, colon, breast and prostate. One of the objectives of this work was to assess a possible role to myosin-Va in melanoma cells. We knocked down the expression of endogenous myosin-Va by using a lentiviral vector expressing a shRNA (shMYO5A) designed to target MYO5A mRNA in 1205Lu - a human melanoma cell line and functional studies were conductedonce efficient knockdown was attained. Myosin-Va depletion was showed to have no effect in cell proliferation as determined by crystal violet staining at a time course interval. However, cell viability was significantly reduced in MYO5A depleted cells compared to control ones. Also, a higher apoptotic index was observed in those cells suggesting that myosin-Va is involved in tumor growth. Subsequentlywe performed a cell migrationanalysis and found rates 60% lower for MYO5A depleted cells. This effect could have been caused by impairment in cell adhesion to the substrate as we could verify by a dynamic adhesion assay in different types of matrix. Adhesion ability to collagen, fibronectin, lamminin and matrigel was reduced in MYO5A depleted cells.

Results suggested that myosin-Va protects cells from anoikis (apoptosis caused by detachment) since MYO5A depleted cells presented higher rates of apoptosis compared to wild-type. Colony formation in soft agar showed that myosin-Va is required for anchorage-independent growth since depleted cells presented fewer and smaller colonies 30 days after culturing under those conditions. These findings indicate that myosin-Va is involved in several steps of tumor growth and progression including cell survival after detachment of the initial tumor mass and colonization of new microenvironments, suggesting that its upregulation in melanoma cells contributes to the rise of malignancy in this type of cancer.']",

        "Background":"['Persistent Jak/Stat3 signal transduction plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis and immune development. Activated Jak/Stat3 signaling has been validated as a promising molecular target for cancer therapeutics discovery and development. Berbamine (BBM), a natural bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloid, was identified from the traditional Chinese herbal medicine Berberis amurensis used for treatment of cancer patients. While BBM has been shown to have potent antitumor activities with low toxicity in various cancer types, the molecular mechanism of action of BBM remains largely unknown. Here, we determine the antitumor activities of thirteen synthetic berbamine derivatives (BBMDs) against human solid tumor cells. BBMD3, which is the most potent in this series of novel BBMDs, exhibits over 6-fold increase in biological activity compared to natural BBM. Moreover, BBMD3, directly inhibits Jak2 autophosphorylation kinase activity in vitro with IC50 = 0.69 M. Autophosphorylation of Jak2 kinase at Tyr1007/1008 sites also was strongly inhibited in the range of 1 M to 5 M of BBMD3 in human melanoma cells 4 h after treatment. Following inhibition of autophosphorylation of Jak2, BBMD3 blocked constitutive activation of downstream Stat3 signaling in melanoma cells. BBMD3 also down-regulated expression of Stat3 target proteins Mcl-1and Bcl-xL, associated with induction of apoptosis. In sum, our findings demonstrate that the novel berbamine derivative BBMD3 is an inhibitor of the Jak2/Stat3 signaling pathway, suggesting evidence for a molecular mechanism whereby BBMD3 exerts at least part of apoptosis of human melanoma cells. In addition, BBMD3 represents a promising lead compound for development of new therapeutics for cancer treatment.']",

        "Background":"['BACKGROUND', ' Tim-3 (T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain 3) is a type-I glycoprotein receptor with pivotal roles in immune regulation and tolerance induction. Tim-3 has opposing roles in innate and adaptive immunity. It synergizes with TLR signaling in DCs inducing the production of inflammatory cytokines, while it acts as a negative regulator of Th1/Tc1 cell function by triggering T cell apoptosis upon interaction with its ligand, galectin-9. Tim-3 is also responsible for the functional exhaustion of T cells observed in some chronic infectious diseases and tumors, such as metastatic melanoma (MM). Natural Killer (NK) cells, innate immune cells which eliminate tumors and infected cells through cytotoxicity and IFN production, constitutively express Tim-3. Moreover, it has been described that some tumor cells (including melanoma cells) express and secrete galectin-9. However, little is known about the role of Tim-3 on NK cells, particularly in the presence of galectin-9, in healthy or melanoma patients. METHODS', ' Purified NK cells from PBMCs of 20 melanoma donors (MD) and 40 healthy donors (HD) were characterized according to the expression of Tim-3 by flow cytometry. Lamp-1 expression on NK cell surface was used to measure NK cell cytotoxicity against the following target cells', \" i) K562 cells which don't express Galectin-9 and ii) Gmel galectin-9+ and Gmel galectin-9- sorted melanoma cells. IFN production was assessed by intracellular staining after 4 hours culture in presence of IL-12. RESULTS\", ' MD NK cells express higher levels of Tim-3 compared to HD NK cells (p<0.05). Moreover, MD NK cells have a defect in cytotoxicity, proliferation and IFN production, but it still remains unclear if Tim-3 is involved in this exhausted phenotype. So far, we found that Tim-3 expression by itself (without engagement of specific ligands) does not negatively affect NK cell cytotoxicity. However, the expression of Galectin-9 by the target cells induces a decrease in NK cell cytotoxicity (Gmel Gal-9+ vs Gmel Gal-9-). CONCLUSION', ' These data suggest that when engaged with Galectin-9, Tim-3 expression down-modulates NK cell cytotoxicity. Therefore, galectin-9 expression may be a possible mechanism for tumors to evade immune surveillance. Given that an increasing body of data supports an important role for Tim-3/Galectin-9 interaction in immune regulation in infectious diseases and cancer, deciphering the function of Tim-3 in different cell types will be critical for potentially targeting it therapeutically.']",

        "Background":"['The 5-year survival rate for stage IV melanoma is estimated to remain unchanged at only 15%, even with new therapies. One emerging hallmark of cancer is the reprogramming of energy metabolism including the role of autophagy. In cancer, autophagy appears to be an important energy source for nutrient-depleted tumors. Ultraviolet-radiation (UVR) exposure is an established risk factor for melanoma and increases autophagic flux. We hypothesize that UV exposure is independently associated with both levels of autophagy and melanoma survival. To address this hypothesis, we are investigating the association between UVR exposure, autophagy, and development of melanoma. Basal levels of autophagy appear to vary by tumor stage, and higher levels of autophagy are associated with poor clinical prognosis. Melanoma cells contain high levels of autophagosomes, a cellular structure associated with autophagy, as measured by the proxy marker LC3. Also, the expression of the autophagy marker Beclin 1 has been associated with increased risk of early death from melanoma. These findings suggest that autophagy provides metabolic support for tumors as it localizes to hypoxic tumor areas, supports tumor cell survival, and is activated in response to stress. Autophagy can act as a cytoprotective mechanism against UV-induced apoptosis. We have shown that rates of autophagy vary by oncogene status. Autophagy was evaluated in formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded melanoma and normal tissue sections, by staining for LC3 and Beclin 1 using IHC. These markers of autophagy, along with clinical tumor characteristics, were correlated with extensive questionnaire data on UV exposure from the same patients to evaluate the impact of estimated lifetime sun exposure and sunburns on survival. A trend in the expression of Beclin1 was not observed; however, LC3 expression was increased in melanoma sections compared to normal. Our results provide enticing support that lifetime UVR exposure is associated with autophagy protein expression in melanoma.']",

        "Background":"['Our aim is to target tumor cells specifically by directly suppressing their oncogenes with peptide nucleic acid (PNA) oligonucleotide analogues. PNA oligonucleotides bind to DNA over 1000-fold more avidly than its native complement, are completely resistant to intra and extra cellular enzymatic degradation, show no nonspecific toxicity at therapeutic levels, and when conjugated to delivery peptides can be made nuclear and cell membrane permeable. We have employed these PNA oligomers to target BRAFV600E which is prevalent in cutaneous melanoma in a sequence-specific complementary manner so as to disrupt transcription by strand invasion. For these studies, we have developed a novel delivery peptide conjugated to PNA modified to increase both cellular delivery and PNA stability towards its target. Our results indicate that exposure of the melanoma cell lines to a modified PNA-peptide conjugate selective for BRAFV600E results in a concentration-dependent inhibition of cell growth that is specific for the BRAFV600E mutant melanoma cell lines with an IC50 range of 250 to 500 nM. Moreover, there is no inhibition of BRAFWT cell growth at these concentrations. This is associated with suppression of BRAFV600E protein over time with no effect on BRAFWT protein levels. Furthermore, BRAFV600E protein expression was suppressed for up to 6 days following initial exposure proving the durability of this type of inhibition. Exposure to this modified PNA-peptide down-regulates BRAFV600E mRNA transcription exclusively in the mutant cell lines. Live cell imaging of BRAFV600E mutant cells confirms localization of fluorescein-labeled PNA-delivery peptide specific to BRAFV600E to the nucleus within 3 hours of treatment. Our results indicate that these PNA-peptide derivatives could represent a novel and promising new therapy for patients with BRAFV600E mutant melanoma, and this technology could be applied to a multitude of other cancers either with specific translocations or mutations differing from wild-type cells even by only a single base pair.']",

Although, at present it has been demonstrated that the treatment with B-Raf enzyme inhibitors improve survival of melanoma patients, still these patients may relapse or become resistant to treatment. Therefore, there is a need to identify novel factors involved in melanoma development and/or progression.Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) have been regarded as critical molecules in promoting tumor cell metastasis. Prognostic and diagnostic significance of MMP-9 overexpression has been shown in several cancer types. However, their role in melanoma was not fully investigated. Thus, we hypothesized that MMP-9 overexpression in melanoma may be involved in transformation and act as a prognostic biomarker.On this light, MMP-9 circulating levels, and MMP-9 gelatinase activity were measured by ELISA and zymography in a total of 148 melanoma samples with and without BRAFV600E mutation compared to healthy controls. The results showed that highest circulating levels of MMP-9 and MMP-9 activity were associated with advanced stages of disease. We have also demonstrated that higher levels of MMP-9 were detected among melanoma samples harboring BRAFV600E mutation compared to those BRAFWT.We further investigated if MMP-9 may be associated with acquired resistance to B-Raf inhibitors, such as Dabrafenib. Functional in vitro experiments were performed using commercial available melanoma cell lines. The results showed that MMP-9 was down-regulated in melanoma cells after treatment with Dabrafenib. While, higher MMP-9 expression levels were observed in the resistant clones compared to those detected in the parental cells.

Moreover, melanoma is highly metastatic and resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs. Our previous studies have demonstrated that caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) suppress the growth of melanoma cells and induce ROS generation. However, the exact mechanism of the growth suppressive effects of CAPE was not clear. Here we determined the potential mechanism of CAPE against melanoma in vitro and in vivo. In a concentration and time-dependent study, CAPE treatment suppressed the activating phosphorylation of PI3K at Tyr-458, PDK1 at Ser-241, mTOR at Ser-2448 and AKT at Ser-473 in B16F0 and SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells. Furthermore, the expression of XIAP, survivin and BCl2 were down-regulated by CAPE treatment in both the cell lines. Significant apoptosis was observed in both the cell lines by CAPE treatment as indicated by cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP. AKT kinase activity was inhibited by CAPE in a concentration-dependent manner. Since Akt regulates XIAP, their interaction was examined by immunoprecipitation studies. Our results show that CAPE treatment decreased the interaction of AKT with XIAP. To establish the involvement of Akt in the apoptosis-inducing effects of CAPE, cells were transfected with Akt. Our results reveal that AKT over-expression attenuated the decrease in XIAP and significantly blocked CAPE-mediated apoptosis. Similarly, over-expression of XIAP further decreased CAPE-induced apoptosis. To confirm the involvement of ROS in the inhibition of AKT/XIAP pathway, cells were treated with antioxidant NAC prior to CAPE treatment. Our results indicate that NAC blocked CAPE mediated AKT/XIAP inhibition and protected the cells from apoptosis. In addition, oral administration of 10mg/kg/day CAPE substantially suppressed the growth of B16F0 tumor xenografts in C57BL/6 mice. Tumors from CAPE treated mice showed reduced phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT, mTOR and protein level of XIAP and enhanced the cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP.

In the current study, we hypothesize that expression of Cx26 and Cx43 in BL6 mouse melanomas will increase gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) thereby decrease their tumorigenic properties. Western blots, immunofluorescence and dye coupling studies revealed that BL6 cells express low levels of Cx26 , Cx43 and are poorly coupled. When cells were engineered to express Cx26 or Cx43, dye transfer studies revealed that both Cx26- and Cx43-expressing cells were highly coupled. Interestingly, when these connexin-rich melanomas were co-cultured with Cx43-rich keratinocytes, melanoma microtumors remained functionally isolated and failed to couple to surrounding keratinocytes. Growth curve studies revealed that exogenous Cx43, but not Cx26, significantly reduced total cell numbers; that was primarily due to reduced cell proliferation. Furthermore, Cx43 expression significantly reduced anchorage-independent growth compared to controls, however, migration remained unaffected. Additionally, Cx43-expressing melanoma cells displayed a reduction in growth when co-cultured with keratinocytes, despite a lack of heterocellular GJIC. Finally, when grown in in vivo avian embryo model, primary tumor weight was reduced in tumor cells expressing Cx43 , but not in Cx26-expressing melanomas , as compared to controls.

Depending on size and other parameters, traditional treatment of the primary tumor has been enucleation. However, alternative treatments to preserve the eye have been devised, including cryotherapy, radioactive therapy, transpupillary thermotherapy, surgical resection and photocoagulation. Despite these advances in treatment, mortality varies considerably, to more than 50% in high-risk patients, primarily due to metastasis to the liver. Therefore, it is critical to develop drugs that are non-toxic and can be administered for potentially extended periods to patients who have diagnosed with primary uveal melanoma. In recent years, Zeaxanthin, a naturally occurring carotenoid alcohol highly enriched in green leaves, has been used in medicine to treat various diseases. Epidemiological studies have shown that higher intake and higher blood levels of zeaxanthin appear to be associated with a lower risk of occurrence of various cancers. It has also been reported that zeaxanthin may inhibit cell growth or induce apoptosis of several tumor cell lines in vitro. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of zeaxanthin on human uveal melanoma cells.MethodsHuman uveal melanoma cells isolated from tissues of enucleated eyes were treated with zeaxanthin in a dose- and time-dependent manner. After zeaxanthin treatment, cell viability was measured using MTT assay. The proapoptotic and antiproliferative effects were evaluated by -annexin V staining and flow cytometry respectively. Mitochondrial transmembrane potential was measured as a function of drug treatment using 5,5,6,6-tetrachloro-1,1,3,3-tetraethyl-benzamidazolocarbocyanin iodide (JC-1).

Decrease in the level of Bcl-2 and increase in the level of Bax were observed in zeaxanthin-treated in human uveal melanoma cells. Preceding cell death, zeaxanthin evoked a rapid dissipation of mitochondrial transmembrane potential. This was followed by the release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm and a substantial increase in the activities of caspase-9 and -3.ConclusionsThese results demonstrate that zeaxanthin induces apoptosis through the regulation of Bcl-2 family protein and activation of intrinsic mitochondrial pathway.

We defined the Usp9x ubiquitinated protein landscape and demonstrate that Usp9x regulates Ets-1, a cancer-promoting transcription factor. Usp9x binds, deubiquitinates and thereby stabilizes Ets-1 protein, and primary tissue and tumor analysis demonstrated elevated and coincident Usp9x/Ets-1 protein expression in melanoma compared to normal skin or benign nevi. Usp9x knockdown or Usp9x inhibition with small molecule G9 reduced Ets-1 protein levels and blocked tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, Usp9x overexpression in melanoma cells increased Ets-1 protein levels and enhanced 3D tumor growth in vitro and in vivo, which were all reversible by treatment with G9.

In this study we examined the expression of genes on the tumor cell lines which had served as the sources of tumor associated antigens loaded onto autologous dendritic cells as part of a phase II trial in which there was an observed 5-year survival rate of 50%.[Dillman 2009] There was sufficient melanoma tumor cells to analyze for 50 of the 54 patients enrolled in the phase II trial.

We assessed the immunological effects of dabrafenib and trametinib at clinically relevant exposure concentrations on both immune and tumor cells in vitro and in vivo, and tested their anti-tumor efficacy in combination with immunomodulatory antibodies in immune-competent syngeneic mouse models. Human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells isolated from healthy volunteers were treated with trametinib and dabrafenib either alone or in combination, and with or without anti-CD3/anti-CD28 bead activation (concurrently or sequentially). Dabrafenib alone enhanced pERK expression levels with no changes of pAKT and pS6 proteins, and had no suppressive impact on human CD4+ or CD8+ T cell proliferation, apoptosis and cytokine production in response to T cell activation. Trametinib alone reduced the pERK levels with no changes in pAKT and apoptosis. However trametinib resulted in partial inhibitory effects on T cell proliferation, pS6 proteins and cytokine expression. These inhibitory effects were transient and only observed if cells were treated with trametinib prior to or simultaneously with T cell activation, while trametinib had little or no suppressive effects on activated T cells. Adding dabrafenib partially offset the transient inhibitory effects caused by trametinib alone. Similarly, gene expression profiling showed that trametinib partially decreased the expression levels of a subset of cytokines and chemokines (e.g. IL1, IL2, IL8, IL10, TNFa, CCL2) and activation/regulation markers (e.g. CD69, CD25, PD1, CTLA4) when trametinib was added prior to or simultaneously with T cell activators. Multi-color flow cytometry confirmed cell surface changes in the expression of CD69, CD25, PD1, OX40 and CTLA4. However, the expression levels of CD69 and OX40 were still well above non-activated T cells.

For our study we have developed an in vivo spontaneous lung-metastasis model using two human melanoma cell lines, UACC903 and C8161, with different genetic backgrounds. Parental melanoma cells were injected subcutaneously into nude mice. After the tumors reached the maximum allowable size of 1.5 cm, survival surgery was performed to remove the subcutaneous tumors and the animals were observed for an additional 4 weeks or until the animals appeared ill. The animals were sacrificed and lung metastases were surgically removed and re-cultured. The two new cell lines were designated as UACC903-LM and C8161-LM. This process was repeated using these new cell lines to obtain a second round of lung metastasizing lines we designated as UACC903-LMM and C8161-LMM. Using the parental and metastasizing cell lines we have been able to identify a lung metastasis gene signature using PCR array analysis, validated by PCR and Western Blot. This lung metastasis gene signature was further supported by the identification of increased expression of the same set of genes in lung metastasis as compared to primary tumors from patients with melanoma. We have also observed increased migration in metastasizing cell lines as compared to the parental lines using a trans-well migration assay with fetal bovine serum as chemo-attractant. CXCR-4 was one of gene products up-regulated in the metastasizing cell lines and the FDA-approved CXCR-4 antagonist, AMD-3100, inhibited trans-well migration of the metastasizing cell lines far more than parental cell lines.

The complexity and cell-to-cell interactions within this system pose a tremendous therapeutic challenge and opportunity. Due to technical constraints, current profiling technologies only provide average signals that do not reflect this intrinsic genetic and phenotypic variability.Here, we applied single-cell RNA-sequencing to examine 4,645 single cells isolated from 19 freshly procured melanomas, profiling malignant, immune and stromal cells. Malignant cells within the same tumor displayed transcriptional heterogeneity associated with the cell cycle, stem-like cells, spatial context, and a drug treatment resistance program. All tumors harbored malignant cells from two distinct transcriptional cell states, such that treatment-sensitive MITF-high tumors also contained drug-resistant AXL-high tumor cells; similar heterogeneity was present in 18 established melanoma cell lines. The frequency of AXL-high cells increased in post-relapse resistant tumors following treatment with BRAF/MEK inhibitors. Using multiplexed, quantitative single-cell immunofluorescence analysis and FACS, we validated these observations in melanoma cell lines treated with BRAFMEK inhibitors. Signatures of cell types identified from single-cell analysis revealed distinct patterns of the tumor microenvironment. We inferred cell-to-cell interactions between stromal, immune and malignant cells, and identified factors, including known secreted gene products (e.g. CXCL12) and several complement factors. We validated the association between cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-expressed complement factor 3 (C3) and TIL infiltration in an independent set of 308 melanomas. Finally, analysis of TILs revealed T-cell activation dependent and independent exhaustion programs that varied among patients dependent on their exposure to treatment with immune checkpoint-inhibitors. In addition to co-expression of several known co-inhibitory receptors, including PD1, CTLA-4, and TIM-3, we identified common markers associated with cytotoxicity-independent T-cell exhaustion across patients. To identify potential T-cell clones, we classified single T-cells by their isoforms of the V and J segments of the alpha and beta TCR chains, allowing us to identify expanded T-cell clones. We found that clonally expanded T-cells expressed a strong exhaustion program, while non-expanded T-cells lacked this phenotype.This study represents the most comprehensive single-cell genomics analysis in humans to date and begins to unravel the cellular ecosystem of tumors. Single-cell genomics offer new insights with implications for both targeted and immune therapies by simultaneously profiling numerous aspects of a tumor with a single assay.']",

Nestin was detected in various neoplasms, and its expression level has relevance to the poor prognosis in some tumors, including malignant melanomas. Recently, nestin was reported as one of the cancer stem cell markers in melanomas. Furthermore, nestin is expressed in circulating tumor cells of melanoma patients, and its expression was found to be correlated with the prognosis. These reports indicate that nestin plays important roles in melanomas, and has the possibility of becoming a therapeutic target in melanomas. In the present study, we used a silencing strategy of nestin to clarify the effectiveness of nestin-targeting therapy in malignant melanomas. METHODS', ' We constructed a plasmid vector of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) tageting nestin and scramble vector as a negative control. Human malignant melanoma cells, A375 cells, were stably transfected with these vectors. Using nestin-shRNA-transfected cells, scramble vector-transfected cells, and wild-type cells, we analyzed cell growth, sphere formation, and invasion in vitro. Activation of the AKT/MAPK pathway was analyzed using a phosphorylated protein array. To determine the effect of nestin-knockdown in vivo, we performed tail vein injection of transfected and wild-type A375 cells into nude mice, and analyzed the metastatic tumor formation in 5 weeks. RESULTS', ' Nestin shRNA transfection suppressed cell growth, invasion, and sphere formation of A375 cells in vitro. In the protein array, the suppression of nestin decreased the phosphorylation of AKT and p53. The incidence of liver metastasis in nude mice was 100% in wild-type cell-injected mice, 75% in scramble vector-transfected cell-injected mice, and 16.7% in nestin-shRNA-transfected cell-injected mice.

Literature shows that over expression of proteolipid protein 2 (PLP2) was associated with metastasis of B16F10 melanoma. Authors showed later that knock-down of PLP2 inhibited growth and metastasis of melanoma cells. The present work aimed at studying the antitumor activity of peptide Rb4 derived from protein PLP2. Peptide Rb4, tested as synthetic peptide on B16F10-Nex2 cells showed antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo. Rb4 induces a remarkable F-actin depolymerization, and also antagonizes thapsigargin blockade of calcium channels on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Such effects on actin dynamics and calcium flow cause apoptosis in murine melanoma B16F10-Nex2, and reduce the viability of several human cancer cell lines. Chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, caspase 9 and caspase 3 activation are compatible with tumor cell apoptosis. Early effects of the peptide were cell rounding and aggregation, followed by substrate detachment. In vivo, peptide Rb4 reduced metastatic activity of B16F10-Nex2 cells and delayed the subcutaneous growth of murine melanoma in the syngeneic model. The protective effect of Rb4 observed in the metastatic melanoma model was not, however, observed in immunodeficient mice. Peptide Rb4 induces the expression of two DAMPs (damage-associated molecular patterns), HMGB1 and calreticulin in B16F10-Nex2. Apart from a direct adjuvant effect of Rb4 on dendritic cells (DCs), the expression of DAMPs by tumor cells may also contribute to DCs activation thus explaining the protective effect of the peptide in vivo against B16F10-Nex2 melanoma. In conclusion, we suggest that peptide Rb4 is a promising compound to be developed as an anticancer drug.

The current studies sought to determine the functional significance of UVB-mediated systemic immunosuppression in an established model of murine melanoma progression. As our studies demonstrated that B16F10 tumors do not express functional PAF-Rs, retroviral-mediated transduction of the PAF-R was used to create PAF-R-positive B16F10 melanoma tumor cells. We show that UVB irradiation augments B16F10 tumor growth and is dependent on host, but not melanoma cell, PAF-R-expression as UVB or the PAF-R agonist, carbamoyl- PAF (CPAF), both promote B16F10 tumor growth in wild-type mice, independent of whether B16F10 cells express PAF-Rs, but do not augment tumor growth in PAF-R deficient (Pafr -/-) mice. Systemic antioxidant treatment ameliorated UVB-mediated augmentation of tumor growth, indicating involvement of Ox-GPC PAF-R agonists produced non-enzymatically. Host immune cells are required as CPAF-induced augmentation of tumor growth is not seen in immunodeficient NOD SCID mice. Finally, depleting antibodies against IL-10 in WT mice, or depletion of CD25-positive cells (suggestive of FoxP3 directed regulatory T cells) in FoxP3EGFP transgenic mice block UVB/CPAF-induced tumor growth, supporting a requirement for IL-10 and regulatory T cells (Tregs) in this process. These findings indicate that UVB-generated Ox-GPCs with PAF-R agonistic activity enhance experimental murine melanoma tumor growth through targeting host immune cells, most notably Tregs, to mediate systemic immunosuppression. These studies describe a previously unrecognized mechanism by which melanoma tumor cells can escape antitumor immunity.

Within the myeloid compartment, ICPs were predominantly expressed on CD14+CD16+ subset.

We hypothesized that this natural product's structure can be optimized to create a more potent and drug-like molecule. A recent structure-activity relationship (SAR) study in our laboratory based on Leonurine structure has led to the identification of three novel analogs which were >100 times potent than Leonurine in killing solid cancer cells. The aim of the current study is to determine whether the novel analogs of Leonurine exhibit anti-proliferative effects against tumor cells through suppression of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation pathway. We investigated the effects of Leonurine analogs on constitutive STAT3 activation, modulation of tyrosine kinases and phosphatases in STAT3 activation, STAT3-regulated gene products, and growth modulation of tumor cells. We found that these compounds inhibited constitutive STAT3 activation in metastatic melanoma cells. The suppression was mediated through the inhibition of activation of the upstream kinases Janus-like kinase (JAK) 1, and JAK2. Leonurine derivatives down-regulated the expression of STAT3-regulated gene products such as survivin, Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, cyclin D1, and Mcl-1 leading to the suppression of proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Moreover, we found that these Leonurine analogs significantly inhibited the proliferation of variety of cells derived from solid tumors including breast, pancreatic, prostate, and colon cancer.

Since, tumor angiogenesis promotes metastasis, we hypothesized that in addition to augmenting invasion and migration, MDA-9/Syntenin might also promote angiogenesis thereby facilitating tumor progression and metastasis.Genetic (gain-of-function and loss-of-function) and pharmacological approaches were employed to modify mda-9/syntenin expression in normal immortal melanocytes, early radial growth phase melanoma and metastatic melanoma cells. The consequence of modifying mda-9/syntenin expression on angiogenesis was evaluated using both in vitro and in vivo assays, including tube formation assays using human vascular endothelial cells, chicken choriallantoic membrane assays (CAM assays) and xenograft tumor animal models.Employing both genetic and chemical approaches we now demonstrate that MDA-9/Syntenin expression correlates with in vitro and in vivo (tumorigenic/metastatic) transformed/invasive phenotypes of human melanoma. Additionally, our immunohistochemical and in vivo CAM assays confirm that angiogenesis is an essential component of MDA-9/Syntenin-induced tumor progression. To define how MDA-9/Syntenin regulates angiogenesis we identified and analyzed several potential downstream gene targets of MDA-9/Syntenin. One gene implicated in induction of vasculogenesis is insulin growth factor binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2), which is transcriptionally regulated by hypoxia inducible factor-1 as a consequence of MDA-9/Syntenin and Src interaction. IGFBP-2 transcriptionally regulates VEGF-A in an AKT-dependent manner through interaction with V3 integrin resulting in angiogenesis.Our studies delineate an unanticipated cell non-autonomous function of MDA-9/Syntenin in the context of angiogenesis by augmenting expression of several pro-angiogenic factors including IGFBP-2, which may provide a complementary way to promote metastasis. As a result, targeting MDA-9/syntenin or its downstream-regulated molecules may provide a means of simultaneously impeding metastasis by both directly inhibiting tumor cell transformed properties (autonomous) and indirectly by blocking angiogenesis (non-autonomous).']",

        "Meeting_name":" The role of jaspamide in the actin cytoskeleton of melanoma cells",
        "Background":"[\"Metastasis is the leading cause of melanoma mortality. The metastatic cascade represents a multi-step process which includes several cellular and molecular processes including cell migration and invasion. Tumor cells can migrate either collectively, in a mesenchymal or in an amoeboid type of movement. The role of microfilaments is essential in mesenchymal migration, where it acts in the formation of membrane protrusions, and amoeboid migration, where they play a key role in cell contraction. In this context, the present work aimed to analyze the effects of the marine sponge-derived drug jaspamide, which has well-known properties on cytoskeleton (anti-polymerizing of the actin microfilaments). After the determination of the IC50 concentrations for the HT144 (derived from human melanoma) and NGM (from human benign nevus) cell lines, the effects of the treatment with jaspamide were studied through wound assays, transwell assays, Boyden's chamber assays, fluorescent cytochemistry, immunofluorescence and Western blotting. The treatments demonstrated the drug acts disorganizing the microfilament cytoskeleton in a dose-dependent way, leading the accumulation of F-actin in the perinuclear region. The wound assays indicated that drug treatment impaired the migration ability of both cell lines. However assays in Boyden's chambers showed increasing in cell migration in consequence of jaspamide treatment, result that could be explained by switch of the migration strategy from mesenchymal to ameboid. This fact was corroborated by the decreased expression of the IRSp53 protein after jaspamide treatment meanwhile MT1-MMP expression is not affected by the treatment. By treating thecell lines with the compounds Y-27632 or NSC23766 in addition to jaspamide, it is possible to conclude that NGM cells use mainly the RAc signaling pathway to control cellular migration process. In contrast, the melanoma cell line HT144 however could use either Rac or Rho pathway to migrate. Key words\", ' Melanoma. Jaspamide. Migration. Invasion. Metastasis.']",

        "Background":"['Tumor cell senescence is often induced by cancer therapeutics. Senescent cells secrete many proteins that may affect both malignant and non-malignant components of the tumor. The goal of this study was to determine how therapy-induced senescence (TIS) affects the immune microenvironment in melanoma. We used inhibitors of cell cycle kinases AURKA and CDK4/6 (AURKAi, CDK4/6i) to induce senescence in melanoma tumors. RNA sequencing analysis of AURKAi-treated syngeneic mouse tumors demonstrated that response to AURKA inhibition was strongly associated with induction of an immune transcriptome (p = 3.5E-29). Immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometric analysis of digested tumors showed correlation between the numbers of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes (TILs) and AURKAi response (Spearman r = -0.87, p<0.001). T cells were among the TILs recruited into AURKAi-sensitive tumors. Therapeutic benefit of AURKAi was limited in immunodeficient host (67% of tumors regressed in immunocompetent mice vs 0% in immunodeficient mice, p = 0.01) suggesting that recruitment of TILs augments response to senescence-inducing therapy. We found that TILs were driven into tumors in response to chemokine CCL5 that was induced in AURKAi and CDK4/6i-treated melanoma cells (up to 20 fold, p0.005) on mRNA and secreted protein levels. Knockdown of CCL5 (KD) inhibited leukocyte recruitment (6.8% in KD vs 29.5% in control, p = 0.002) and response to AURKAi in vivo (p = 0.61 in KD vs p = 0.02 in control). In contrast, therapeutic benefit was greatly enhanced when senescence-inducing therapy was combined with T cell-activating immunotherapy using CD137 (4-1BB) agonist (p<0.001). We also evaluated CCL5 expression in human melanoma tumors in relation with TIS and TIL markers. Expression of CCL5 was induced by AURKAi and/or CDK4/6i in patient derived xenografts (3 patients, 3 mice each, p0.02), in tumors from patients who responded on AURKAi clinical trial (3 patients, before/after therapy) and was associated with expression of Immune response genes in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset of 278 melanoma tumors (p = 1.40E-93). In conclusion, our data demonstrates that TIS promotes recruitment of TILs via the induction of CCL5 which, in turn, augment therapeutic response in melanoma. Further improvement of melanoma outcome is achieved when senescence-inducing drugs are combined with immunotherapy that promotes tumor cells killing by TILs. This study presents a novel promising approach to improve melanoma therapy by utilizing TIS to reprogram tumor immune microenvironment.']",

        "Background":"['Melanoma delivers immune suppressive stimuli through PDL-1. FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP51) is an immunophilin capable of immune suppression. We, previously, demonstrated a relevant role for this protein in melanoma biology and progression. Melanoma also expresses a splicing variant of FKBP51 (isoform 2 or ISO2), whose function is unknown. Aim of this study was to generate knowledge on the mechanism regulating PDL-1 expression in melanoma, and find biomarkers predictive of response to immunotherapy. We generated melanoma cells overexpressing the canonical FKBP51 or ISO2, and measured levels of PDL-1. Flow cytometry showed that expression of PDL1 in ISO2-melanoma (41.5+4.2%) was significantly higher than expression in control cells (15.5+4.7%) or melanoma overexpressing the canonical FKBP51 (23.2+5.7%). These results suggested a role for ISO2 in regulation of PDL-1 expression, that was confirmed in another tumor cell line, namely HeLa. Western blot assay showed different bands of PDL-1 (around 70kD, 50kD and 37kD). The band at 70kD was present in the tumor, but not in lymphocytes and, reasonably, corresponded to the form exposed on the membrane. This 70kD band was particularly upregulated in ISO2-melanoma. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) express a strong immunohistochemistry signal for FKBP51. Since a molecular mimicry suits melanoma and lymphocytes, we investigated whether PBMCs of melanoma patients, that are a good a source of TIL, expressed the two isoforms. We measured, by QPCR, isoforms levels in PBMCs of 70 healthy donors, 92 primary melanoma and 60 metastatic melanoma patients. Our results show that expression of ISO2, but not canonical FKBP51, was significantly higher in PBMCs of patients than in PBMCs of controls (Kruskal-Wallis test, p<0.0001). In addition, ISO2 expression in PBMCs from metastatic melanoma patients (range 7.0-36.0 au) was significantly higher than expression in PBMCs from primary melanoma (range 1.0-3.5 au)(p<0-007). Healthy donors PBMCs expressed ISO2 when cocultured with melanoma and such expression changed in accordance with PDL-1 expression on melanoma, as suggested by PDL-1 knockdown experiments. Moreover, ISO2 resulted increased in PBMCs cultured with PDL-1 recombinant protein, but not BSA. These findings suggested that the increased expression of ISO2 in PBMCs of melanoma patients was stimulated by the interaction between the tumor and PBMCs, through PDL-1/PD1. In conclusion, our results show that 1) ISO2, a splicing variant of FKBP51, upregulates expression of PDL1 in melanoma; 2) PDL1-PD1 interaction between tumor and lymphocytes induces ISO2 in lymphocytes; 3) increased ISO2 levels were measured in PBMCs of 152 melanoma patients; 4) ISO2 levels were especially high in PBMCs of advanced melanoma patients. Collectively, our results suggest ISO2 is a promising melanoma biomarker related to PDL-1.']",

        "Background":"['An important feature of cellular signaling involves the activation of plasma membrane-bound receptor complexes via endogenous ligands. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest human gene family, are known to be activated by ligands such as, thrombin, chemokines or glutamate, and have been shown to be important regulators of signaling pathways. Dysregulation via overexpression of diverse GPCRs has been well documented in primary and metastatic tumors cells such as breast, lung, prostate and gastric tumors, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma (1), however, knowledge of their genetic alterations is limited especially in malignant melanoma. Thus, further analysis of this gene family is warranted to determine if GPCR proteins play a role in melanomagenesis. In our current study, we used exon capture and illumina sequencing methods to analyze the mutational status of all the GPCRs in melanoma. This investigation revealed that one family member, GRM3 was frequently mutated in melanoma and that one of its mutations clustered within one position (Glu870Lys). Biochemical analysis of GRM3 alterations revealed that mutant GRM3 selectively regulated the phosphorylation of MEK leading to increased anchorage-independent growth and migration. In vivo studies revealed that overexpression of mutant forms of GRM3 result in increased lung macrometastases; whereas depletion of GRM3 in cells expressing mutant forms of GRM3 resulted in reduced xenograft tumor formation compared to equivalently treated wild type GRM3 cells. Furthermore, melanoma cells expressing mutant forms of GRM3 had reduced cell growth and reduced cellular migration after shRNA-mediated knockdown of GRM3 or treatment with a selective MEK inhibitor, AZD-6244, which is currently being used in phase II clinical trials. Our study yields a comprehensive map of genetic alterations in the GPCR gene family and suggests a potential novel therapeutic target for melanoma patients.']",

        "Background":"['Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignant tumor in adults. About half of patients with uveal melanoma will develop metastatic disease to the liver and the lung. These tumors are characterized by mutations in G-proteins (GNAQ and GNA11), activation of MAPK, and over-expression of c-Met. We have previously reported that c-Met inhibition inhibits tumor cell invasion and metastasis formation in uveal melanoma. Altiratinib is a selective inhibitor for c-Met as well as TIE2, VEGFR2 and TRK kinases. We found that this agent had no effect on inhibiting cell growth, consistent with our previous findings with crizotinib. However, it did inhibit invasion of uveal melanoma cells through matrigel in a concentration dependent fashion (25 nM to 250 nM) with inhibition of phospho-Met noted at concentrations as low as 25 nM. Selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor, is currently in clinical trial in patients with this disease. We found that treatment with 250 nM selumetinib inhibited cell proliferation but unexpectedly induced a marked increase in cell invasion of GNAQ and GNA11 mutant cell lines. This was associated with an increase in c-Met RNA and protein expression, as well as receptor phosphorylation, after 24 hours of selumetinib treatment. Combining selumetinib with altiratinib inhibited cell invasion to the level of altiratinib alone and continued to inhibit cell proliferation to the level of selumetinib alone. This effect was recapitulated by the knockdown of c-Met by siRNA prior to treatment with selumetinib. In a uveal melanoma xenograft model, the combination treatment of 15 mg/kg altiratinib and 25 mg/kg selumetinib significantly delayed tumor growth compared to vehicle control, altiratinib and selumetinib alone. Western blot analysis of tumor tissue confirmed target inhibition of p-Met and p-ERK in animals treated with altiratinib and selumetinib, respectively. Furthermore, tumor metastasis was inhibited by altiratinib, selumetinib and combination treatments in a uveal melanoma mouse model. These results indicate that the combined inhibition of MEK and c-Met by selumetinib and altiratinib, respectively, may be sufficient to suppress uveal melanoma tumor growth and metastasis. This strategy can potentially be used as therapy for patients with primary uveal melanoma who are at high risk for the development of metastatic disease.']",

Trials suggest that combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors are more efficacious than single agents, but tumors remain resistant. We are investigating CD47 blockade for the treatment of cancer. CD47 is frequently elevated in cancers and serves as an inhibitory receptor for thrombospondin-1 on immune cells in the tumor stroma.

Even though the combination of BRAF/MEK inhibitors is initially highly effective in treating melanoma in a subset of patients, progression to resistance ultimately occurscommonly via reactivation of the BRAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Therefore, therapeutic strategies to counter primary resistance and prevent the emergence of secondary resistance are needed. Following pharmacological or progressive genetic perturbations, dynamic and system-wide adaptive changes (reprogramming) in the expression and activity of multiple kinases (collectively termed the kinome) clearly occur in tumor cells. Rich networks of serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases, many of which are understudied, are integrated into the signaling systems controlled by oncogenes known to drive melanoma. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of the kinome at baseline, during the adaptive response to kinase inhibitor treatment, and in the context of acquired resistance is critical. We use Multiplexed Inhibitor Beads (MIBs), mixtures of covalently immobilized, linker-adapted kinase inhibitors coupled with mass spectrometry (MS), to assess changes in activation of kinases in untreated samples, during acute inhibition of BRAF and/or MEK and in the context of acquired resistance. Our enhanced MIB/MS technology allows us to study over 75-80% of the expressed kinome (and numerous lipid and metabolic kinases) simultaneously using lysates from cell lines, genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) tumors, patient-derived xenografts or human melanoma.

Thus, studies using MIB/MS to measure dynamic kinome responses have identified kinases that have not been previously shown to be involved in the adaptive response to BRAF and/or MEK inhibition.

Correspondingly, TJU-UM001 maintained in SFM expressed mRNA for IGF-1 and furthermore secreted IGF-1 protein. Both anti-IGF-1 and anti-IGF-1R antibodies independently inhibited the spontaneous proliferation of the cells in SFM (p<0.05) suggesting a critical role for endogenous IGF-1 expressed by TJU-UM001 cells.Conclusion', ' Although the strong and extensive expression of IGF-1R in archival tissue specimens suggests paracrine stimulation via IGF-1R as a major mechanism of the growth of uveal melanoma in the liver, cell proliferation in SFM and the endogenous production of IGF-1 by tumor cells indicate an autocrine mechanism via IGF-1R is also operative. The results underscore a key role of IGF-1 in promoting the growth of uveal melanoma. The present study shows autocrine and paracrine mechanisms underlay IGF-1-induced uveal melanoma growth and indicate how these mechanisms can be targeted to suppress metastatic growth and improve clinical outcome.']",

Here we report the molecular changes of downstream kinases in tumors of pts with metastatic melanoma treated with cilengitide, a selective antagonist of v3, in a phase II study. Methods', ' In this study, 26 pts were treated, and all tissues were embedded in OCT and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen at -80 C until further analysis. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for the expression of v3, pFAK, pERK1/2 and pAKT. Results', ' There were 1 pt with a partial response (PR) and 3 pts with stable disease (SD) in the study. All 26 pts had pre-treatment biopsies, and 18 underwent second biopsy on day 8. Adequate paired tumor samples were available in 16 pts for v3, 11 pts for pAKT, and 9 pts for pERK1/2 and pFAK. Six (23%) of 26 pts had intratumoral expression of v3 (defined as 25% of tumor cells stained positive) pre-treatment. The sole responder and 2 of 3 pts with SD did not express av3 at baseline. Cilengitide decreased the expression of v3 (p = 0.04), but not the expression of the downstream kinases. The decreased expression of v3 with treatment was correlated with the decrease in pERK1/2 expression (p = 0.03) but not with pAKT or pFAK. Conclusions', ' Although cilengitide decreased melanoma expression of v3, its clinical efficacy was minimal in this study. These data suggest that the benefit of cilengitide in pts with disease control (PR+SD) was secondary to anti-angiogenic activity rather than direct anti-tumoral effect.

Functional genomic screens in cancer cells to discover new therapeutic targets are usually carried out in vitro where interaction with the immune system is absent. Here we report a pooled, loss-of-function genetic screening approach using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing that is conducted in vivo in mouse transplantable tumors treated with vaccination and PD-1 checkpoint blockade. We tested 2,400 genes expressed by melanoma cells for those that synergize with or cause resistance to checkpoint blockade, and recovered the known immune evasion molecules, PD-L1 and CD47. Loss of function of multiple genes required to sense interferon-y caused resistance to immunotherapy. Deletion of Ptpn2, a pleotropic protein tyrosine phosphatase improved response to immunotherapy. In vivo, Ptpn2 deficient tumors showed increased infiltration of activated CD8+T cells. In vitro, Ptpn2 loss by tumor cells increased antigen presentation to T cells. Biochemical, transcriptional and genetic epistasis experiments demonstrated that loss of function of Ptpn2 sensitizes tumors to immunotherapy by enhancing interferon-y-mediated effects on the tumor cell. Thus, augmenting interferon-y signaling in tumor cells could increase the efficacy of immunotherapy.

        "Background":"['Tumors, like wounds, recruit cells from surrounding tissues and bone marrow. Some of these cells provide support and nutrition, while others participate in an inflammatory response. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exhibit this tropism toward wounds and other areas of pathology. Consequently, stem cell technology for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes is an emerging field in cancer biology. Like bone marrow MSCs, mouse neural progenitor cells (NPCs) tend to migrate toward cancer sites. We found that these cells migrate toward B16F10 lung melanomas, making them very good candidates for delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs, genes of interest, and imaging contrast agents. Among imaging techniques, bioluminescent imaging is non-invasive. Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) is particularly useful, as it is non-toxic and has stronger luminescence than other known luciferases. In the presence of its substrate coelenterazine (coel), Gluc luminescence peaks near 470 nm. In this study, we engineered NPCs to secrete Gluc. These Gluc-engineered cells were injected systemically to C57BL/6 mice bearing metastatic B16F10 lung melanoma and mice were given coel intravenously. Imaging of the mice on the Caliper IVIS Lumina II showed bioluminescence in disseminated areas. The distribution of bioluminescence suggested that the engineered NPCs migrated to the tumor sites and secreted Gluc. In confirmation, necropsy revealed black metastatic tumors in the locations emitting bioluminescence. Although IV injection of metastatic B16F10 lung melanoma cells usually generates lung tumors, we found dissemination of melanoma in other parts of the body. The Gluc-expressing NPCs could find the tumors as early as 2 days post tumor-cell injection, long before tumors were palpable. Thus, this system offers promise for improving cancer diagnosis. For improved imaging, this bioluminescence system can be coupled with other fluorescent dyes for red shifted output. Finally, the same sensitivity and tumor tropism suggests that the NPCs could be useful delivery cells for tumor-targeted therapeutics.']",

        "Background":"['With over 8500 deaths each year in the USA, malignant melanoma is the deadliest of all skin cancers. Constitutive activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) is common in melanoma, promoting tumor growth, survival and metastasis. In light of its role in tumorigenesis, targeting of the NF-B pathway has been considered a possible therapeutic option for the treatment of melanoma. However, NF- B activation is critical for the development, survival, migration and function of immune cells. We hypothesized that systemic inhibition of the activation of NF-B might have a deleterious effect on the tumor immune response. Melanoma bearing C57BL/6 mice received 50 mg/kg of BMS-345541, a selective inhibitor of the inhibitor of B kinase (IKK), twice daily. Tumors, spleens and bone marrow were harvested at different time points and analyzed by flow cytometry for leukocyte composition and cytokine production. Intracellular cytokine staining revealed an early induction of Interleukin-4 (IL-4) within the myeloid and B cell components of the tumor, as a result of BMS-345541 treatment. The production of IL-4 by these cells suggests an early switch to a tumor promoting T helper 2 (Th2) and M2 driven immune response, which may counteract the anti-tumor effect of IKK inhibition by generating a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment. These results, in part, explain the modest delay in tumor growth demonstrated. IL-4 receptor (IL-4R) expression on human melanoma cells has been previously documented; however the effects of IL-4 on these cells have generated contradictory reports. IL-4R signaling has been shown to either inhibit growth of tumor cells in vitro or to promote survival of tumor cells. In C57Bl/6 mice bearing a murine melanoma, BMS345541 (75 mg/kg bid) was given in combination with 100 g of IL-4R blocking antibody on day 4 and day 12 of treatment. This combination significantly inhibited tumor growth compared to BMS345541 treatment alone. These data suggest an important role for IL-4 in promoting melanoma growth in vivo. Dual targeting of IL-4R and NF-B signaling pathways neutralizes the tumor promoting immune component. Currently, IL-4R antagonists are in clinical trials for the treatment of asthma, which makes the translational prospects of this study extraordinarily viable. We are grateful for support from the NCI (CA116021-07, 5T32CA119925-03) and the Department of Veterans Affairs for these studies.']",

Methods', '    Endogenous tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells were identified by their high expression of PD-1 and CD11a CD8+ T cells and their expression of Bim,  a pro-apoptotic molecule, in the peripheral blood of 26 patients with metastatic melanoma and 11 patients with metastatic prostate cancer or healthy donors using flow cytometry.  Soluble PD-L1 in patients sera was quantified using ELISA.   Results', '    The target-cell engaged CD8+ T cell population was significantly higher in patients with melanoma and prostate cancer compared to healthy donors, as assessed by CD11a and PD-1  expression.   Bim expression was higher in  CD8+ T cells in both cancer patients than healthy controls (p<0.01). In patients with advanced melanoma, Bim was significantly higher in the PD-1(+) target cell-engaged CD8+ T cells than the PD-1(-) CD-8+ T cells (P<0.01).   Bim levels above the base line levels of healthy donors in the CD8+ T cells correlated with decreased survival in patients with melanoma (8.9 months v. 13.8  months, p<0.05).  Our data suggest that the Bim level is dependent on PD-1 expression, and that higher Bim expression may be indicative of PD-1(+) CD8+ T cells which have engaged B7-H1 (PD-L1), either soluble (peripheral blood) or membrane bound (tumor cells), and are susceptible to apoptotic death.  Conclusions', '    PD-1+ CD11a high CD8+ T cells identify a unique population of effector cells responsive to target tumor cells in cancer patients. Elevated Bim expression in CD8+ T cells may indicate the active immune inhibiting effects of PD-1/B7-H1 signaling on endogenous antitumor T cell responses.

The aim of this study was to determine whether BRAK transgenic mice (Tg) would show resistance to tumor cell transplant and tumor metastasis or not, and if so, to find the mechanism of tumor suppression. [EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES] Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells or B16 melanoma cells were injected subcutaneously into dorso-lateral region of Tg or wild type (Wt) C57BL/6J mice. Tumor cells were also injected intravenously via a tail vein into Wt, SCID mice or NK cell-deficient NOG mice to investigate colonization to the lungs. Tg or Wt mice were also pre-injected with NK cell function inhibitory anti-NK 1.1 antibody or anti-asialo GM1 antibody to see the role of NK cells in BRAK-dependent tumor suppression in vivo. Melanoma cells that had been engineered to express the BRAK gene under the control of doxycycline (B16-luc-2-LMT3-Tet/OnBRAK) were also used. [RESULTS] Sizes of LLC or B16 melanoma cell tumors in the Tg mice were significantly smaller than those in the control Wt mice, indicating that BRAK, first found as a suppressor of tumor growth of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, also suppressed the growth of carcinomas of other tissue origins. This suppression was attenuated by the injection of anti-asialo-GM1 antibody. Colonization of LLC cells or B16 melanoma cells to the lungs was also suppressed in the Tg mice, and this suppression was attenuated by the treatment with anti-asialo-GM1 antibody or anti-NK 1.1 antibody. When Wt mice were fed doxycycline-containing sucrose solution after the injection of B16-luc-2-LMT3-Tet/OnBRAK cells, the number of metastatic nodules in the lungs was significantly lower than that for the mice fed control sucrose solution. In the case of SCID mice, the number of metastatic nodules was 4 times higher that for the Wt, but still the number was significantly lower than that for the BRAK-expressing melanoma cells. On the other hand, when the B16-luc-2-LMT3-Tet/OnBRAK cells were injected into NK-cell-deficient NOG mice, the number of metastatic nodules was ten times higher than that in the Wt mice; and also no difference was observed between BRAK-expressing and non-expressing melanoma cells, indicating NK cell activity to be indispensable for suppression of tumor-cell metastasis to the lung.

Parallel development of platform for quantitative protein expression enables biomarker monitoring to evaluate the multiple pathways through which tumor cells can acquire drug resistance. We have developed quantitative assays using liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (LC-MRM) to assess a diverse panel of >70 proteins involved in signaling pathways, including apoptosis, receptor tyrosine kinases, PI3K/Akt/MTOR, and MAP kinases. Assays quantify changes in response to targeted therapeutic agents and examine subsequent resistance mechanisms in cell lines, xenografts, and biopsies from patients.Experimental procedures', ' Nave and BRAF V600E inhibitor-resistant melanoma cell lines were treated with vehicle control, BRAF V600E inhibitor (PLX4720), HSP90 inhibitor (XL-888, Exelixis), or MEK inhibitor (AZD6244). Immunoblotting and LC-MRM were used to evaluate protein expression levels. Heat shock proteins can be measured directly from whole cell lysates or tumor homogenates using a few micrograms of protein. For expression of cancer signaling proteins (many of which are HSP90 clients), 50 micrograms of total protein were fractionated by SDS-PAGE prior to digestion and LC-MRM quantification. Similar experiments were conducted with mouse xenograft tumors from treated and control mice; these measurements have also been applied to fine needle aspirates (FNAs) and core biopsies from patients in the context of a clinical trial.Data summary', ' LC-MRM quantification is effective in quantifying these proteins in cell lines, xenografts, and biopsies or FNAs. The LC-MRM panel assay was able to screen for a diverse range of proteins revealing previously undescribed cellular responses to treatment and elucidate potential mechanisms of resistance. As an example, both LC-MRM data and Westerns showed consistent responses to HSP90 inhibition, including increased expression of HSP71 and reduction of HSP90 client levels. Proteins were also modulated in response and resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors.Conclusion', ' LC-MRM quantifies biomarker panels and provides an assessment tool that can translated in a straightforward way from cell line models to patient specimens. This emerging technique holds great promise for biopsy-mandated clinical trials, particularly in diseases like melanoma that can be readily sampled. Measurements using this LC-MRM platform can be used to assess drug performance and patient response to evaluate treatment, detect drug resistance, and suggest rational combination therapies.']",

Methods', ' BALB/c nu/nu mice were intradermally injected with 0.5x10E6 cells of the human TGF-2 expressing melanoma cell line C8161. Intraperitoneal treatment with different doses of trabedersen or vehicle (controls) started 2 days after tumor implantation thrice weekly.

Treatment continued until first tumor reached 2000 mm3 (approx. 32-35 days after inoculation).

        "Background":"['Overcoming immune tolerance is critical for the development of effective immunotherapy against cancer. Tumor cells induce tolerance through a variety of modalities including the secretion of IL-10 and TGF-, the expression of inhibitory ligands, and the generation of cells with regulatory properties. Epigenetic modifiers have gained special attention due to their ability to modify immune regulatory pathways. In this context, a group of chemical compound collectively named histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have recently been shown to modulate tumor cell immunogenicity, adding a new property to their already well-documented cytotoxic effect against transformed cells. LBH589 is a potent, pan-HDACi that has been used in clinical trials for the treatment of several hematological malignancies. Here, we provide evidence of the anti-melanoma effect of LBH589 through its direct effects upon tumor cells as well as its modulatory effects upon immune cells. Indeed, treatment of human and murine melanoma cells in vitro with LBH589 resulted in inhibition of melanoma proliferation, characterized by cell cycle arrest in G1. Moreover, we found that LBH589 enhances the expression of MHC class I and II molecules on melanoma cells, which is critical for immune recognition. In addition, LBH589 treatment inhibits the production of IL-10, while enhancing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-12 and the expression of the costimulatory molecule B7.2 on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). LBH-treated APCs also displayed an enhanced capability to activate nave antigen-specific T-cells as evidenced by their increased production of IL-2 and IFN-. More importantly, LBH589-treated APCs also restored the function of anergic T-cells isolated from tumor bearing mice. Finally, in vivo treatment of B16 melanoma bearing mice with LBH589 resulted in a substantial decrease in tumor growth when compared to vehicle-control treated mice (mean 602mm3 vs. 1316mm3, respectively). In conclusion, the dual ability of the pan-HDACi LBH589 to target both melanoma cells and to enhance anti-tumor immune responses provides the rationale for evaluating this compound either alone or in combination with immune enhancing therapeutic approaches (eg, CTLA4 blockade) for melanoma treatment.']",

It is expressed on activated T-cells and B-cells and binds to two ligands, Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) and Programmed Death Ligand 2 (PD-L2). PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell functions through interactions with its primary ligand PD-L1, which is variably expressed by a variety of tumors, including melanoma, glioblastoma, and carcinomas of the lung, breast, colon, ovary, and renal cells. Many tumor cells express PD-L1 and as a result, the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 has been demonstrated to be an important target for therapeutic intervention.

        "Background":"['Background', '    To date there are no studies demonstrating the ability of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) isolated from patients to grow ex-vivo in culture. Most of our knowledge on the mechanisms of cancer metastasis has been obtained from CTCs of mouse models. In human, a main issue for studying circulating melanoma cells subpopulations and constructing tumor models is to be able to grow CTCs from patients. Here we defined optimized conditions to isolate CTCs alive and to culture them using the ScreenCell technology.  Methods', '    CTCs were isolated alive by size using a ScreenCell device from 6 ml blood of 11 patients with melanoma at diagnosis and before surgical excision. Cells were cultured directly on a porous and high adhesion filter with optimized culture conditions. The filter was also used as a crossing barrier for cell invasion assay. After 15 days culture, cells were fixed and immunohistochemically stained for proliferative, hypoxia and invasive phenotype markers.  Results', '    After 5 daysunder specific culture conditions, CTCs were adherent to the filter with several shapes and size in all patients, while no cells were found in blood of healthy donors. After proximately 10 days in culture, a population of small cells started to growth while a subpopulation of large cells migrated through the pores of the filter to form spheroids into the Matrigel located under the filter. After 15 days in culture the non-invasive and invasive cells were positively immunostained for expression of the Melan-A proliferative phenotype marker and for the Glut-1 and Wnt5A hypoxia and invasive phenotype markers, respectively. In parallel, the corresponding primary melanoma lesions were immunostained and compared to immunostaining data of CTCs.  Conclusions', '    TheScreenCell technology preserves the viability, proliferative and invasion potentials of CTCs. Furthermore, CTCs can be maintained in culture allowing ex vivo expansion and characterization of subpopulations of CTCs with proliferative and invasive characteristics. Using the ScreenCell devices we have defined optimal technical and microenvironment conditions for CTCs isolation and culture. We are currently exploring the ability of CTCs to xenoengraft and develop tumor in immunocompromized mice.']",

        "Background":"['Programmed death-1(PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) are important immunotherapy targets for cancer. PD-1 serves as a negative costimulatory receptor on various cell types, including T and B cells as well as myeloid-derived cells. Its ligand PD-L1 (B7-H1) is not expressed by normal epithelial tissues, but it is aberrantly expressed on a wide array of human cancers including melanoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, etc. Engagement of PD-1 by its ligands PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells associated with poorer prognosis by disabling the host antitumor response. The most recent investigational anti-PD-1 immunotherapy drugs such as nivolumab from BMS and lambrolizumab (MK-3475) from Merck have all demonstrated significant overall survival rate in patients with advanced melanoma.Here we developed a cell based bioluminescent reporter assay that can be used for rapid quantifying function of PD-1 or PD-L1 therapeutic antibodies as measured by activation of NFAT signaling pathway. For this, Jurkat T-cell line stably expressing NFAT-luciferase reporter and human PD-1 was generated. Raji stably expressing human PD-L1 was generated as antigen presenting cells (APC). by co-cultivating the two cell lines in the present of CD3 and IgG, Raji cells fully activate Jurkat NFAT pathway via CD28 binding to CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2) endogenously expressed on Raji cells. PD-1 signaling in Jurkat cells following engagement of PD-L1 ectopically expressed on Raji cells inhibits T cell function, and results in NFAT pathway inhibition. Blockade of PD-L1 using anti-PD-L1 mAb reversed NFAT pathway activation.']",

        "Meeting_name":" SOX10 is required for cell cycle regulation and melanomagenesis.",
        "Background":"['The transcription factor SOX10 is essential for proper survival and differentiation of neural crest cell lineages, and plays an important role in the establishment and maintenance of melanocytes. SOX10 is also highly expressed in melanoma tumors, however its role in the progression of the disease is not yet understood. Here, we report that melanoma tumor cell lines require wild-type SOX10 expression for proliferation, and detail the rescue of melanoma in the metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (Grm1Tg) transgenic mouse by Sox10 haploinsufficiency. Stable SOX10 knockdown in human melanoma cells results in arrested growth, altered cellular morphology, and senescence. Cells with a stable loss of SOX10 are arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle with elevated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A and 1B (p21 and p27) expression. SOX10 loss also results in hypophosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (RB) and a reduction in the expression of its binding partner E2F1. Previously, the RB-E2F1 pathway has been shown to play a central role in cell cycle regulation, and here we demonstrate that SOX10 expression is required for the maintenance of the RB-E2F1 pathway to promote melanoma cell growth. One of the main events driving cellular transformation is the dysregulation of the cell cycle, therefore the role that SOX10 has in maintaining this process provides great promise for targeted interventions.']",

        "Meeting_name":" Interleukin-4 receptor-targeted cytotoxic T cells enhances the therapeutic efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy against melanoma.",
        "Background":"['Melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, has long been a major focus of immunotherapy. Adoptive T cell therapy-based cancer immunotherapy has been used to enhance the specificity and potential of host immune system to treat melanoma. However, the infiltration and antitumor function of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) are blocked or down-regulated by various signals derived from tumor cells and cells in tumor microenvironment. A novel approach to specify and enhance the homing ability of CTLs to tumor is of high demand. Interleukin-4 receptor (IL-4R) is over-expressed on many types of cancer cells, including melanoma, and has been widely employed for targeted drug delivery. In this work, we examined whether the tumor homing efficiency and anti-tumor therapeutic efficacy of CTLs could be heighten by labeling CTLs with IL4RPep-1, a targeting peptide that binds to IL-4R. The labeling was empowered by conjugating IL4RPep-1 with Dioleylphosphatidylethanolamine-biological anchor for membrane (DOPE-BAM), an oleyl acid-derived membrane anchor that incorporates into lipid membrane of cells. Tumor-specific CTLs isolated from the mice immunized by irradiated B16F10 melanoma cells were highly populated with CD62L+CD44+ activated T cells. After labeling with IL4RPep-1 via DOPE-BAM, CTLs were still functionally active, as determined by intracellular interferon-γ and granzyme release assays. Moreover, such labeling did not affect the proliferation of T cells. Adoptive transfer of IL4RPep-1-labeled, IL-4R-targeted CD45.1+CTLs into CD45.2 mice bearing B16F10 melanoma enhanced their accumulation at tumor compared to that of unlabeled T cells. Tumor homing of IL4RPep-1-labeled T cells was further validated by in vivo fluorescence imaging of mice bearing 4T1 tumor at mammary gland. Adoptive transfer of IL-4R-targeted CTLs showed remarkable anti-tumor growth activity in mice bearing B16F10 tumor compared to untargeted CTLs. After the transfer, flow cytometric study of immune cells showed significant increase of CD8+ T cells and F4/80+CD86+M1-polarized macrophages with noticeable decrease in tumor-promoting immune cells, such as F4/80+CD206+M2-polarized macrophages, Gr1+CD11b+ myeloid derived suppressor cells, and CD3+CD4+ T cells. The CTLs accumulated at tumor were mostly exogenous CD45.1+ T cells. These results implicate that IL-4R-targeted CTLs, which is enabled by labeling of with IL4RPep-1, can be a promising strategy in the field of adoptive T cell therapy against IL-4R-overexpressing tumor.']",
