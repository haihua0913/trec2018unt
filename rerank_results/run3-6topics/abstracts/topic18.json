Melanomas express PD-L1 in association with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), but the potential contribution of the BRAF V600E mutation (BRAFmut) to induced PD-L1 expression has not been determined. Fifty-two archival melanocytic lesions were assessed for PD-L1 expression, TIL infiltration, and BRAFmut simultaneously. IFNγ-induced PD-L1 expression in cultured melanomas was assessed in parallel according to BRAF status. Melanocyte PD-L1 expression was observed in 40% of specimens, and BRAFmut was observed in 42% of specimens, but no significant concordance was found between these variables. Almost all melanocytes displaying PD-L1 expression were observed to be adjacent to TILs, irrespective of BRAF status. TIL(-) lesions were not more likely to be associated with BRAFmut, when compared with TIL(+) lesions. Baseline expression of PD-L1 by melanoma cell lines was virtually nil, regardless of BRAFmut status, and the intensity of IFN-induced PD-L1 expression in melanoma cell lines likewise did not correlate with BRAF mutational status. PD-L1 expression in melanocytic lesions does not correlate with the BRAFmut. Thus, distinct populations of melanoma patients will likely benefit from BRAF inhibitors versus PD-1 pathway blockade.",

Primary melanoma cell lines were obtained from a series of patients with either eye or skin melanoma. The ability of tumor cells to stimulate T cells in the absence of exogenous growth factors was assessed in mixed-lymphocyte tumor cell cultures in which allogeneic lymphocytes were stimulated with irradiated ocular or skin melanoma cells. Expression of HLA class I and class II on tumor cells, in the presence or absence of IFN-gamma, was determined by flow cytometry. The ability of tumor cells to inhibit T-cell proliferation was determined by adding various concentrations of irradiated tumor cells to standard mixed-lymphocyte cultures. Our results indicate that primary skin melanoma cells induce vigorous proliferation of allo-antigen-specific T cells. By contrast, ocular melanoma cells failed to induce significant T-cell proliferation. The failure of ocular melanoma cells to stimulate lymphocyte proliferation was not due to low levels of either class I or class II on tumor cells since tumor cells treated with IFN-gamma expressed high levels of class I and class II but still failed to induce lymphocyte proliferation. Ocular melanoma cells inhibited lymphocyte proliferation, as shown by experiments in which a small number of tumor cells prevented proliferation of T cells in mixed-lymphocyte cultures. Inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation required cell-to-cell contact, and supernatants from tumor cell cultures did not prevent lymphocyte proliferation. Moreover, the ability of ocular melanoma cells to inhibit T-cell proliferation was lost when tumor cells migrated from the eye and formed hepatic metastases. We conclude that there is a fundamental difference in the immunogenicity of ocular and skin melanoma cells. Ocular melanomas, but not primary skin melanomas, are poorly immunogenic tumors that inhibit T-cell proliferation. Our results imply that the immunogenicity of melanoma cells is altered when they develop within the unique ocular micro-environment.",

In this study, we demonstrate that RANK was significantly increased in peripheral circulating melanoma cells, primary melanomas, and metastases from stage IV melanoma patients compared with tumor cells from stage I melanoma patients. However, upregulated RANK expression was not found in stage IV melanoma patients with bone metastases compared with stage IV melanoma patients without bone metastases, providing a possible explanation for the clinical observation that melanoma cells do not preferentially metastasize to bone tissue. Strikingly, RANK-expressing melanoma cells from peripheral blood, primary tumors, or metastases of stage IV patients coexpressed ATP-binding cassette (ABC) B5 and CD133, both markers characteristic of melanoma-initiating cells, suggesting a tumor stem cell-like phenotype. In support of this hypothesis, RANK-expressing melanoma cells showed a reduced Ki67 proliferation index compared with RANK(-) melanoma cells from the same patient and are able to induce tumor growth in immunodeficient mice.

In various murine tumor models including melanoma models, ectopic expression of IL-27 has been shown to play an anti-tumoral role and to favor tumor regression. In this study, we investigated whether IL-27 might play a role in the development of melanoma in humans. We analyzed the in situ expression of IL-27 in melanocytic lesions (n = 82) representative of different stages of tumor progression. IL-27 expression was not observed in nevus (n = 8) nor in in situ melanoma (n = 9), but was detected in 28/46 (61%) cases of invasive cutaneous melanoma, notably in advanced stages (19/23 cases of stages 3 and 4). In most cases, the main source of IL-27 was tumor cells. Of note, when IL-27 was detected in primary cutaneous melanomas, its expression was maintained in metastatic lesions. These in situ data suggested that the immunosuppressive functions of IL-27 may dominate in human melanoma. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that IL-27 could induce suppressive molecules such as PD-L1, and to a lesser extent IL-10, in melanoma cells, and that the in situ expression of IL-27 in melanoma correlated with those of PD-L1 and IL-10.

Immunohistology, reverse transcription-PCR, intracellular fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis, and immunoblotting demonstrated that melanoma cells express IL-18. C57BL/6 splenocytes cultured with culture supernatants of B16F10 melanoma cells enhanced IFN-gamma production, which was blocked by anti-IL-18 antibody, indicating that IL-18 in the culture supernatants is functional. In addition to IL-18, the IL-18 receptor was also detected in B16F10 melanoma cells, suggesting a role of this cytokine in regulating the functions of B16F10 melanoma cells. The functional effect of IL-18 on B16F10 melanoma cells was shown by reduction of Fas ligand expression in cells treated with anti-IL-18 antibody or transfected with IL-18 antisense cDNA. In addition, the same treatments decreased intracellular reactive oxygen intermediate levels in B16F10 melanoma cells, indicating that IL-18 regulates reactive oxygen intermediate production, which is involved in Fas ligand expression. Furthermore, transfection of IL-18 antisense cDNA into melanoma cells increased the susceptibility of tumor cells to natural killer cells in vitro. When IL-18 antisense transfectants were implanted into syngeneic mice, severe reduction of tumor cell growth was observed with concomitant infiltrated natural killer cells in the tumor area.

The experimental approach utilizes unique three-dimensional collagen matrices preconditioned by metastatic melanoma cells, which contain laminin 5 gamma2 chain-enriched tracks with promigratory cleavage fragments produced by cooperative interactions with specific matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The results demonstrate that the collagen matrices preconditioned by the metastatic cells induce poorly aggressive melanoma cells to express, for the first time, key angiogenic/vasculogenic/matrix-remodeling genes. Treatment of aggressive melanoma cells with an MMP inhibitor resulted in the inhibition of vasculogenic mimicry-associated genes in these tumor cells and abrogation of the inductive effects of the preconditioned matrix on poorly aggressive melanoma cells.

However, the impact of TIGIT on melanoma specific CTLs in the effector phase remains still unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that melanoma cells control anti-melanoma CTL responses via the TIGIT-CD155 interaction in the effector phase. TIGIT is an inhibitory receptor expressed on T cells, and CD155 is one of the cognate ligands expressed on the tumor cells or antigen-presenting cells. First, we confirmed that CD155 was constitutively expressed on melanoma cells. We then demonstrated that CD155 on melanoma cells suppressed cytokine release from melanoma-specific CTLs via interaction with TIGIT. Overexpression of CD155 enhanced, and its downregulation attenuated the suppressive effect. This suggested that anti-melanoma CTL responses are controlled not only by an imbalance in CD226 (an activating molecule binds to CD155) and TIGIT expression on T cells but also by the expression levels of CD155 on melanoma cells. In addition, co-blockade of TIGIT and PD-1 signals synergistically elicited a response of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) on autologous melanoma cells.

Overexpression of CD95 in a tetracycline-inducible expression system enhanced melanoma cell sensitivity to CD95 ligation but was unable to trigger apoptosis by itself. In clear contrast, all melanoma cells tested responded with increased apoptosis to conditional expression of CD95L (2-10-fold), both after transient and after stable transfection. Activation of caspase-8, Bid cleavage, cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation followed after CD95L induction indicating a functional CD95-signaling cascade. CD95L was also able to enhance the proapoptotic effect of chemotherapeutics applied in parallel. Nude mouse experiments revealed that tumorigenicity was lost when melanoma xenografts were triggered to express CD95L. In addition, further progression of pre-existing melanomas was inhibited and even regression was seen after induction of CD95L expression.

However, the mechanisms underlying tumor metastasis is still incompletely understood. CIZ/NMP4 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein and its roles in tumor cells have not been known. We, therefore, hypothesized the role of CIZ/NMP4 in B16 melanoma cells that metastasize to bone. CIZ/NMP4 is expressed in B16 cells. The CIZ/NMP4 expression levels are correlated to the metastatic activity in divergent types of melanoma cells. Overexpression of CIZ/NMP4 increased B16 cell migration in Trans-well assay. Conversely, siRNA-based knockdown of CIZ/NMP4 suppressed migratory activity of these cells. As RANKL promotes metastasis of tumor cells in bone, we tested its effect on CIZ in melanoma cells. RANKL treatment enhanced CIZ/NMP4 expression. This increase of CIZ by RANKL promoted migration. Conversely, we identified CIZ/NMP4 binding site in the promoter of RANKL. Furthermore, luciferase assay indicated that CIZ/NMP4 overexpression enhanced RANKL promoter activities, revealing a positive feedback loop of CIZ/NMP4 and RANKL in melanoma.

As it was stated before that miR-196a might negatively regulate expression of the transcription factor HOX-C8, we analyzed HOX-C8 levels in NHEMs and melanoma cells and found a strong up-regulation of HOX-C8 expression in malignant melanoma cell lines and tissue samples compared with melanocytes. Several HOX-C8 target genes are known to be involved in processes such as oncogenesis, cell adhesion, proliferation and apoptosis. We, therefore, aimed to further investigate a potential \"miR-196a → HOX-C8 → HOX-C8 target gene\" relationship. Stable transfection with an miR-196a expression plasmid led to strong down-regulation of HOX-C8 expression in melanoma cells. Luciferase assays using reporter plasmids containing different fragments of the HOX-C8 3'UTR confirmed direct interactions of miR-196a with the HOX-C8 mRNA. Focusing on target genes of HOX-C8, which might play an important role in melanomagenesis, we identified three genes (cadherin-11, calponin-1 and osteopontin) that are up- or down-regulated, respectively, by altered HOX-C8 expression in miR-196a expressing cell clones and are thus indirectly regulated by this microRNA. As those target genes are closely related to important cellular mechanisms such as cell adhesion, cytoskeleton remodeling, tumor formation and invasive behavior of tumor cells, altered miR-196a expression exerts strong effects contributing to tumor cell transformation and formation and progression of malignant melanoma. This fact is underlined by a strongly reduced invasive behavior of melanoma cells re-expressing miR-196a in vitro.",

Tetraspanins are localized to the cell surface in cancer and participate in various functions including invasion of tissues mediated by secretion of cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases. However, little is known about the role of CD82 tetraspanins in malignant melanomas during cancer cell invasion. In this study, we investigated the functional importance of CD82 expression in melanoma-mediated gap formation by using cDNAs to induce CD82 expression in highly invasive melanoma cell lines. Results showed that CD82 expression inhibited melanoma cell-induced gap formation, melanoma cell extravasation in vitro and subsequent lung metastasis development in vivo. Mechanistic studies showed that inducible expression of CD82 in highly metastatic melanoma cells significantly increased p21 expression upon binding of Duffy antigen receptor group (DARC), inducing tumor cell senescence and interrupting IL-8-mediated vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin disassembly. Taken together, these studies provide a rationale for using drug therapies that restore CD82 expression and inhibit IL-8 production to inhibit late-stage melanoma cell extravasation and subsequent metastasis development.",

The adhesion receptor integrin alpha v beta 3 contributes to tumor cell functions that are potentially involved in melanoma growth and metastasis. We tested whether integrin alpha v beta 3 supports metastasis of human melanoma cells when injected into the bloodstream of immune deficient mice. Comparing variants of the same melanoma cell type that expressed either alpha v beta 3, alpha IIb beta 3 or no beta 3 integrin, we found that only alpha v beta 3 strongly supported metastasis. Inhibition of tumor cell alpha v beta 3 function reduced melanoma metastasis significantly and prolonged animal survival. To understand mechanisms that allow alpha v beta 3, but not alpha IIb beta 3 to support melanoma metastasis, we analyzed proteolytic and migratory activities of the melanoma cell variants. Melanoma cells expressing alpha v beta 3, but not those expressing alpha IIb beta 3 or no beta 3 integrin, produced the active form of metalloproteinase MMP-2 and expressed elevated mRNA levels of MT1-MMP and TIMP-2. This indicates an association between alpha v beta 3 expression and protease processing. Furthermore, alpha v beta 3 expression was required for efficient melanoma cell migration toward the matrix proteins fibronectin and vitronectin. The results suggest that expression of integrin alpha v beta 3 promotes the metastatic phenotype in human melanoma by supporting specific adhesive, invasive and migratory properties of the tumor cells and that the related integrin alpha IIb beta 3 cannot substitute for alpha v beta 3 in this respect.",

PAX3 and MITF bind to elements in the MET promoter independently, without evidence of either synergistic activation or inhibition. SOX10 does not directly activate the MET gene alone, but can synergistically activate MET expression with either PAX3 or MITF. In melanoma cells, there was evidence of two pathways for PAX3 mediated MET induction: (i) direct activation of the gene, and (ii) indirect regulation through MITF. SK-MEL23 melanoma cells have both of these pathways intact, while SK-MEL28 melanoma cells only have the first pathway. In summary, we find that PAX3, SOX10 and MITF play an active role in melanoma cells by regulating the MET gene.

The leading cause of death in melanoma patients is widespread metastasis caused by increased cell motility and a rich blood supply for tumor cells. A unique form of microcirculation called vasculogenic mimicry, which efficiently supplies blood to tumor cells, has been reported recently. Apoptosis-related protein performs a nonapoptotic function to promote migration and invasion of tumor cells. This study focuses on the nonapoptotic role of caspase-3 in melanoma and its effects on the migration, invasion, and vasculogenic mimicry formation of melanoma cells. Human melanoma samples were used to detect active caspase-3 expression and determine its relationship with clinicopathologic parameters. In addition, a human melanoma A375 cell line was used to determine the role of caspase-3 in migration and invasion using z-DEVD-fmk, a selective caspase-3 inhibitor, to inhibit caspase-3 activity. The findings suggest that active caspase-3 is expressed in nonapoptotic melanoma cells and is related to metastasis and vasculogenic mimicry formation in patients with melanoma. Low doses of caspase-3 inhibitor reduced caspase-3 activity without affecting cell apoptosis. Inhibition of caspase-3 activity using low-dose z-DEVD-fmk decreased the migration, invasion, and vasculogenic mimicry formation of melanoma cells in vitro. Similarly, downregulation of caspase-3 by specific small interfering RNA also inhibited the migratory, invasive, and tube-forming potential of melanoma cells. The caspase-3-mediated promotion of melanoma cell motility may be because of the cleavage of matrix metalloproteinase-2. ",

ALCAM is involved in homophylic (ALCAM-ALCAM) and heterophylic (ALCAM-CD6) cell adhesion interactions. We have studied MEMD/ALCAM cell-cell interactions between human melanoma cells. The expression of this cell adhesion molecule not only correlates with enhanced metastatic properties and with aggregational behavior of human melanoma cells as tested by FACS analysis, but transfection experiments also make clear that MEMD/ALCAM expression is essential for cell-cell interaction of the investigated human melanoma cells. As the melanoma cell lines analyzed are all CD6 negative, these results strongly suggest that MEMD/ALCAM is an adhesion molecule mediating homophylic clustering of melanoma cells. MEMD/ALCAM expression is not restricted to subsets of leukocytes and melanoma cells, it can also be found in healthy organs and in several other malignant tumor cell lines. Besides, MEMD/ALCAM is also expressed in cultured endothelial cells, pericytes and melanocytes, in xenografts derived from the radial and vertical growth phase and in 4 of 13 melanoma metastasis lesions.

To study the variability of the immune response in melanoma patients, we derived melanoma cell lines from several HLA-A2+ and HLA-A2- patients. The melanoma cell lines studied were designated FM3, FM6, FM9, FM28, FM37, FM45, FM55p, FM55M1 and FM55M2 and were established from eight metastatic tumors as well as from one primary tumor from a total of seven different patients. On the basis of the ability of tumor cells to induce specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) in mixed lymphocyte/tumor culture with HLA-A2+ melanoma cells, the FM3 cell line was characterized as highly immunogenic. To investigate the expression of different melanoma-associated antigens recognized by CTL on different melanoma cell lines, we selected the cell line FM3 for restimulation and further T cell cloning experiments. The lytic activity of CTL clones with good proliferative activity was examined using a panel of HLA-A2+ and HLA-A2- melanoma cell lines. None of the tested HLA-A2- melanoma cell lines were susceptible to lysis by the CTL clones, whereas allogeneic HLA-A2+ melanoma cell lines were lysed only by a few CTL clones. On the basis of their reactivity with different melanoma cell lines, it was possible to divide the present CTL clones into at least four groups suggesting the recognition of at least four different antigens. Three of these target structures probably are different from already-described HLA-A2-restricted melanoma-associated antigens, because their expression in the different melanoma cell lines do not correlate with the recognition of melanoma cells by these CTL. The results first indicate that poorly immunogenic melanoma cells may express melanoma-associated antigens, and also suggest that, by using CTL clones obtained against different HLA-class-I-matched melanoma cells, it is possible to define such antigens.",

In vitro, melanoma cells stained for LIGHT in the intracellular compartment, with weak or negative cell surface expression. However, LIGHT was expressed on tumor-derived microvesicles released from melanoma cells. In vivo, LIGHT was found in metastatic lesions, and the extent of lymphotoxin beta receptor expression on the stromal cells was significantly associated with a \"brisk\" T-cell infiltrate in the neoplastic tissue. In the lesions with a brisk T-cell infiltrate, stromal cells surrounding the tumor also stained for the T-cell attractant chemokine CCL21. The intratumoral T lymphocytes frequently expressed herpesvirus entry mediator and were characterized by a differentiated phenotype. Coculture of lymphocytes with LIGHT(+) melanoma-derived microvesicles or even with LIGHT(+) melanoma cells in the presence of interleukin-2 costimulated LIGHT-dependent CD3(+)CD8(+) T-cell proliferation. However, lymphocyte coculture with LIGHT(+) microvesicles in the presence of interleukin-2 was also associated with an apoptotic response as documented by increased binding of Annexin V by CD3(+)CD8(+) T cells. These data suggest that LIGHT constitutively expressed in human melanoma cells and microvesicles may contribute to regulate T-cell responses to tumor cells.",

This process involves multiple adhesive interactions between tumor cells and the endothelium. Only little is known about the molecular nature of these interactions during extravasation of tumor cells. In human melanoma cells, the integrin alphavbeta3 is involved in transendothelial migration and its expression correlates with metastasis. However, many human melanoma cells do not express beta3 integrins. Therefore, it remained unclear how these cells undergo transendothelial migration. In this study we show that human melanoma cells with different metastatic potency, which do not express beta2 or beta3 integrins, express the VCAM-1 receptor alpha4beta1. VCAM-1 is up-regulated on activated endothelial cells and is known to promote transendothelial migration of leukocytes. Interestingly, despite comparable cell surface levels of alpha4beta1, only the highly metastatic melanoma cell lines MV3 and BLM, but not the low metastatic cell lines IF6 and 530, bind VCAM-1 with high affinity without further stimulation, and are therefore able to adhere to and migrate on isolated VCAM-1. Moreover, we demonstrate that function-blocking antibodies against the integrin alpha4beta1, as well as siRNA-mediated knock-down of the alpha4 subunit in these highly metastatic human melanoma cells reduce their transendothelial migration. These data imply that only high affinity interactions between the integrin alpha4beta1 on melanoma cells and VCAM-1 on activated endothelial cells may enhance the metastatic capacity of human beta2/beta3-negative melanoma cells.",

Although melanoma cell lines cross endothelial cell barriers, they do not express LFA-1. We therefore hypothesized that melanoma-endothelial cell co-culture might induce the LFA-1/ICAM ligand/receptor couple during melanoma transmigration.;A transwell approach has been used as well as blocking antibodies against CD11a, CD18 and ICAM-1.

A better understanding of the pathophysiologic processes underlying leptomeningeal metastases is needed for more effective treatment strategies. We hypothesized that tumor cells will have to adhere to the well-vascularized leptomeninges, because the cerebrospinal fluid lacks nutrients and growth factors for efficient tumor cell proliferation. Specific receptor-ligand interactions, which are unknown until now, will mediate this adhesion process. We determined the growth characteristics of B16F-10 melanoma cells in cerebrospinal fluid. The expression levels of specific adhesion molecules on both mouse leptomeningeal cells (MLMC) and murine B16F-10 melanoma cells were measured by immunofluorescence flow cytometry. We used mAbs to determine the function of these specific adhesion molecules on B16F-10 melanoma cell adhesion to a leptomeningeal cell layer under static and (cerebrospinal fluid-like) flow conditions. B16F-10 melanoma cells did not proliferate in cerebrospinal fluid because of a lack of nutrients and growth factors. MLMC expressed low levels of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), beta1- and beta3-integrin subunits, and CD44. VCAM-1 expression on MLMC was shown to be up-regulated by TNF-alpha. Blocking VCAM-1 on the MLMC with a mAb resulted in a 60% inhibition of melanoma cell adhesion to a leptomeningeal cell layer under flow but not under static conditions. No additive inhibitory effect on melanoma cell adhesion was found by concomitant blocking of the beta1- and beta3-integrin subunits and CD44 with mAbs. Our experiments indicate that cerebrospinal fluid does not support B16F-10 melanoma cell proliferation, suggesting the need for melanoma cell adhesion to the well-vascularized leptomeninges.

To analyze the role of stromal-derived ADAM-9 for the growth and survival of melanoma cells, we have used in vitro coculture systems of melanoma cells and ADAM-9(-/-) fibroblasts. Coculture of melanoma cells in the presence of ADAM-9(-/-) fibroblasts led to increased melanoma cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis as compared with control cocultures. We identified TIMP-1 and sTNFRI as the two relevant factors expressed in increased amounts in culture supernatants from ADAM-9(-/-) fibroblasts. TIMP-1 was associated with induced melanoma cell proliferation, whereas soluble TNFR1 mediated the reduced cellular apoptosis in vitro. In vivo, injection of murine melanoma cells into the flank of ADAM-9(-/-) animals resulted in the development of significantly larger tumors than in wild-type animals as a result of increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis of melanoma cells.

Moreover, a critical role for constitutive activation of Stat3 in tumor cell proliferation and survival has been established in diverse cancers. However, the oncogenic signaling pathways in melanoma cells remain to be fully defined. In this study, we demonstrate that Stat3 is constitutively activated in a majority of human melanoma cell lines and tumor specimens examined. Blocking Src tyrosine kinase activity, but not EGF receptor or JAK family kinases, leads to inhibition of Stat3 signaling in melanoma cell lines. Consistent with a role of Src in the pathogenesis of melanoma, we show that c-Src tyrosine kinase is activated in melanoma cell lines. Significantly, melanoma cells undergo apoptosis when either Src kinase activity or Stat3 signaling is inhibited. Blockade of Src or Stat3 is also accompanied by down-regulation of expression of the anti-apoptotic genes, Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1. These findings demonstrate that Src-activated Stat3 signaling is important for the growth and survival of melanoma tumor cells.",

Until recently, Epo was considered to be a specific stimulator of erythropoiesis, acting via its receptor, EpoR. It becomes clear, however, that EpoR is expressed in a variety of cell types other than hematopoietic cells, and that Epo is a potent cytoprotective cytokine increasing cell survival under hypoxic conditions. Epo and EpoR are also expressed in various malignant tumors, and EpoR expression shows association with tumor invasion and progression. Recently, a functional Epo autocrine signaling mechanism was also detected in human melanoma cells. In this study, we examined the hypothesis that Epo activates the Akt signaling pathway in human melanoma cells and thus promotes the survival of tumor cells. The Akt signaling pathway in response to Epo was examined in melanoma. Similar to Epo, the expression of EpoR was up-regulated in response to hypoxia and Epo stimulation in melanoma cells. Melanoma cells constitutively expressed Akt with variable expression of mammalian target of rapamycin, and Epo dose-dependently induced their activity. Epo increased Akt kinase activity, which was abrogated by co-treatment with LY294002, a specific blocker of phosphoinositide 3-kinase. LY294002 also inhibited the cytoprotective effects of Epo in melanoma cells under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Our results suggest that Epo promotes melanoma cell survival by activating an Akt-dependent signaling pathway.",

The expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) on HUVEC was increased by TNF-alpha, IL-1 and IFN-gamma when measured by ELISA or flow cytometric (FACS) analysis. IL-6 did not increase ICAM-1 expression on HUVEC. Two melanoma cell lines, Malme-3M and SK-Mel-28, showed increased expression of ICAM-1 after treatment with TNF-alpha, IL-1 and IFN-gamma in FACS analysis. IFN-gamma induced increased expression of HLA-DR only in SK-Mel-28 melanoma cells, not in Malme-3M melanoma cells. Neither HUVEC nor melanoma cells expressed lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) in either the basal (i.e., cytokine untreated) condition or the cytokine treated condition. Melanoma cells showed minimal increment in adhesion to TNF-alpha or IL-1 treated HUVEC than to cytokine untreated HUVEC. HUVEC and melanoma cells did not express LFA-1 and increased ICAM-1 expression by TNF-alpha, IL-1 and IFN-gamma treatment in FACS analysis did not coincide with minimal increase of melanoma cells adhesion to cytokine treated HUVEC.

Although the expression of ligands for NK cell-activating receptors is variable, the majority of melanoma cell lines express ligands for NKG2D and for DNAX accessory molecule-1 (DNAM-1). While the NKG2D receptor has been described as the principal entity responsible for the lysis of several melanoma cell lines, the role of natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) and DNAM-1 receptors in NK cell recognition and killing of melanoma cells has been recently emphasized. Antibody-mediated masking of NKG2D, NCRs, and DNAM-1 has proven that NKG2D, NCRs, and DNAM-1 frequently cooperate in the lysis of melanoma cells.

However, it is now well recognized that TLR expression is not restricted to immune cells but can also be found in many cell types, including those giving rise to tumors. It is therefore mandatory to explore the potential effects of TLR triggering directly on tumor cells.;In the present work, we have investigated TLR3 protein expression in melanoma cell lines derived from patients, and analyzed the effects of TLR3 agonists on tumor cell survival. Moreover, we used RNA interference to stably knock down TLR3 expression and study the involvement of this receptor in dsRNA-induced effects on melanoma cells viability.;Human melanoma cells can express functional TLR3 protein. Interestingly, the engagement of the receptor by TLR3 agonists can directly inhibit cell proliferation and induce tumor cell death when combined to treatment with either type I IFN or protein synthesis inhibitors. These effects were shown by RNA interference to be largely dependent on TLR3. Moreover, TLR3-mediated cell death involves the activation of caspases and engages both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways.;TLR3 protein can be expressed in human melanoma cells, where it can deliver proapoptotic and antiproliferative signaling. Altogether, these results suggest that TLR3 agonists represent very promising adjuvants for cancer vaccines not only based on their well-described immunostimulatory properties, but also due to their newly identified cytostatic and cytotoxic effects directly on tumor cells.",

We found a direct correlation between alpha(4) integrin expression on B16-F1 melanoma cells and their ability to form adhesive interactions with monolayers of lymphatic endothelial cells. Adhesion of B16-F1 melanoma cells to lymphatic endothelial cells was mediated by the melanoma cell alpha(4) integrin binding to its counterreceptor, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), that was constitutively expressed on the lymphatic endothelial cells. VCAM-1 was also expressed on the tumor-associated lymphatic vessels of B16-F1 and B16alpha(4)+ tumors growing in the subcutaneous space of C57BL/6J mice.

To explore the effects of GSK2118436 on the expression patterns of CDKI (p16, p21, p27, p57), we immunohistochemically evaluated in vivo melanoma cells pre- and posttreated with GSK2118436.

These findings may help explain the molecular mechanisms by which tumor cells retain the ability to proliferate. The persistent activation of pro-oncogenic activities of CDKI (eg, p27 and p57) and/or compartmentalization of p16 in cytoplasm or nucleus may allow tumor cells to bypass BRAF-induced senescence mechanisms.

        "Doc_abstract":"MIA (melanoma inhibitory activity) protein, identified as a small 11 kDa protein highly expressed and secreted by malignant melanoma cells, plays an important functional role in melanoma development, progression and tumor cell invasion. Recent data describe a direct interaction of MIA protein with cell adhesion receptors integrin alpha(4)beta(1) and integrin alpha(5)beta(1) and extracellular matrix molecules. By modulating integrin activity MIA protein mediates detachment of melanoma cells from surrounding structures resulting in enhanced invasive and migratory potential. However, until today a detailed understanding of the processes of MIA function is missing. In this study, we show that after binding of MIA protein to integrin alpha(5)beta(1), MIA protein is internalized together with this cell adhesion receptor at the cell rear. This mechanism enables tumor cells to migrate in a defined direction as appropriate for invasion processes. Treatment of melanoma cells with PKC-inhibitors strongly reduced internalization of MIA protein. Endocytosis is followed by dissociation of MIA-integrin complexes. In acidic vesicles MIA protein is degraded while integrins are recycled. Treatment of melanoma cells with MIA inhibitory peptides almost completely blocked the MIA protein uptake into cells. As MIA protein has a major contribution to the aggressive characteristics of malignant melanoma in particular to formation of metastasis, it is important to elucidate the MIA functional mechanism in tumor cells to find novel therapeutic strategies in the fight against skin cancer.",

However, it remains unclear whether certain cytokines modulate the effects of AMF on tumor cell migration. Because interleukin (IL)-8, a proinflammatory cytokine, is produced by melanoma cells and has been correlated with melanoma migration, the migratory ability of melanoma cells induced by AMF may also involve induction of IL-8 expression. In the present study, we assessed whether AMF promotes melanoma cell migration through autocrine production of IL-8. We found that AMF stimulation increased IL-8 production through up-regulation of IL-8 mRNA transcription, especially in biologically early stage melanoma cells. AMF-induced migration of these cells was inhibited by a specific neutralizing antibody against IL-8. The IL-8 production induced by AMF was mediated by the ERK1/2 pathways. These findings suggest that melanoma migration induced by AMF is mediated by autocrine production of IL-8 as a novel downstream modulator of the AMF signaling pathway.",

MITF-M regulates the expression of melanocyte differentiation genes such as MLANA, tyrosinase and gp100, which encode antigens recognized on melanoma cells by autologous cytolytic T lymphocytes. Accordingly, treating some melanoma cells with IL-1beta reduced by 40-100% their ability to activate such antimelanoma cytolytic T lymphocytes. Finally, we observed large amounts of biologically active IL-1alpha or IL-1beta secreted by two melanoma cell lines that did not express MITF-M, suggesting an autocrine MITF-M downregulation. We estimate that approximately 13% of melanoma cell lines are MITF-M-negative and secrete IL-1 cytokines.

Various types of tumor cells have been shown to escape immune recognition by constitutive resistance to CD95-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, several apoptosis-related proteins have been reported to influence CD95 sensitivity. We tested an unselected panel of 11 melanoma cell lines for sensitivity to CD95 and the corresponding expression of CD95, CD95L, bcl-2, bcl-x, bcl-xS, bax and FLIP proteins. Despite detection of CD95 cell-surface expression in 9 out of the 11 cell lines tested, only 3 melanoma cell lines were sensitive to anti-CD95-MAb-induced cell death. Apoptosis-related proteins CD95L, bcl-2, bcl-x, bcl-xS and bax were found to be heterogenously expressed in different melanoma cell lines tested. The susceptibility of melanoma cells to anti-CD95-MAb-mediated apoptosis was associated with low protein expression of both bcl-2 and bcl-x. The level of CD95 cell-surface expression in melanoma cells was no indicator for CD95 sensitivity. Furthermore, FLIP protein was detectable in 7 out of the 11 cell lines, but showed no correlation to CD95 sensitivity. Certain cytokines have been described as modulating the susceptibility of tumor cells to CD95-induced cell death. Since IFN-alpha was proved to be clinically efficient in melanoma therapy, we tested whether interferons have the ability to induce sensitivity to CD95 in primarily resistant melanoma cell lines. Here we show that IFN-gamma, but not IFN-alpha, is able to increase the susceptibility of sensitive cell lines and to induce CD95 sensitivity in resistant melanoma cell lines, accompanied by up-regulation of the protein expression level of CD95 and/or bcl-xS.",

During the EMT-like switch in phenotype, a concomitant change in expression of multiple tumor antigens occurs. Melanoma cells undergoing EMT escape from killing by T cells specific for antigens whose expression is downregulated by this process. We discuss melanoma antigens whose expression is influenced by EMT. We assess the effect of changes in the expressed tumor antigen repertoire on T-cell mediated tumor recognition and killing. In addition to escape from T cell immunity via changes in antigen expression, mesenchymal-like melanoma cells are generally more resistant to classical chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, we demonstrate that when targeting antigens whose expression is unaltered during EMT, the capacity of T cells to kill melanoma cell lines in vitro is not influenced by their phenotype. When considering immune therapies such as cancer vaccination, these data suggest escape from T cell killing due to phenotype switching in melanoma could potentially be avoided by careful selection of target antigen.

The integrin alphaIIb beta3 (GPIIb-IIIa) is expressed on the surface of platelets in an inactive state and requires a conformational change to recognize extracellular matrix proteins such as fibrinogen, fibronectin, vitronectin, and others. In this study, we questioned whether human melanoma cells express the alphaIIb beta3 integrin. Reverse transcription-PCR/Southern blotting, Northern blotting, and dot blotting demonstrated the presence of the platelet-type alphaIIb beta3 integrin in human melanoma WM 983B, WM 983A, and WM 35 cells. AP-2, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to alphaIIb beta3, positively stained two human melanoma specimens, indicating expression of this integrin in vivo. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, two activators of protein kinase C, stimulated adhesion of melanoma cells to immobilized fibronectin and PAC-1, a mAb to alphaIIb beta3. PAC-1 specifically recognizes the conformationally active form of platelet alphaIIb beta3. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated adhesion of WM 983B cells to PAC-1 was completely blocked by an RGD peptide, thus providing evidence that tumor cell adhesion to PAC-1 is mediated via the alphaIIb beta3 integrin but not the Fc receptor. Confocal immunofluorescent studies demonstrated that fibronectin-adherent melanoma cells possess an intracellularly localized pool of high-affinity alphaIIb beta3. Invasion of WM 983B cells through fibronectin was stimulated by 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and this stimulated invasion was blocked by the mAb PAC-1. The data suggest that melanoma cells express the high-affinity alphaIIb beta3 integrin, which is involved in tumor invasion.",

Chemokine receptors mediate agonist-dependent cell responses, including migration and activation of several signaling pathways. In the present study we show that several human melanoma cell lines and melanoma cells on macroscopically infiltrated lymph nodes express the chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CXCR4. Using the highly invasive melanoma cell line BLM, we demonstrate that the chemokine Mig, a ligand for CXCR3, activates the small GTPases RhoA and Rac1, induces a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, and triggers cell chemotaxis and modulation of integrin VLA-5- and VLA-4-dependent cell adhesion to fibronectin. Furthermore, the chemokine SDF-1alpha, the ligand of CXCR4, triggered modulation of beta(1) integrin-dependent melanoma cell adhesion to fibronectin. Additionally, Mig and SDF-1alpha activated MAPKs p44/42 and p38 on melanoma cells.

However, the impact of TIGIT on melanoma-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the effector phase remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that melanoma cells control antimelanoma cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses via the TIGIT-CD155 interaction in the effector phase. TIGIT is an inhibitory receptor expressed on T cells, and CD155 is one of the cognate ligands expressed on the tumor cells or antigen-presenting cells. First, we confirmed that CD155 was constitutively expressed on melanoma cells. We then demonstrated that CD155 on melanoma cells suppressed cytokine release from melanoma-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes via interaction with TIGIT. Overexpression of CD155 enhanced and its downregulation attenuated the suppressive effect. This suggested that antimelanoma cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses are controlled not only by an imbalance in CD226 (an activating molecule that binds to CD155) and TIGIT expression on T cells but also by the expression levels of CD155 on melanoma cells. In addition, the co-blockade of TIGIT and PD-1 signals synergistically elicited a response of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes on autologous melanoma cells. These results suggest that the CD155-TIGIT interaction should be blocked for enhancement of antimelanoma immune responses.",

Triamcinolone acetonide (TA) and anecortave acetate (AA) can be used to treat radiation retinopathy. It is not known whether TA or AA has any effect on potentially still viable uveal melanoma cells in the choroid after radiotherapy. We therefore studied the effect of these drugs on the proliferation of uveal melanoma cell lines in vitro. Furthermore, as these drugs are supposed to counteract vascular leakage, we determined their effect on the expression and production of the proangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), the antiangiogenic pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), and thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) in uveal melanoma cells.;Three uveal melanoma cell lines were treated in vitro with TA or AA. Cell proliferation was measured by counting cells and using the Water-Soluble Tetrazolium Salt-1 (WST-1) assay. VEGF-A and PEDF production was measured by ELISA, and intracellular expression of angiogenic-associated genes including VEGF-A, PEDF, and TSP-1 was determined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR.;We found no effect of TA or AA on tumor cell growth or production of VEGF-A and PEDF in any of the three uveal melanoma cell lines tested. Regarding expression as measured by RT-PCR, TA had an inhibiting effect on TSP-1 in only one cell line, and no effect on VEGF-A or PEDF. AA showed a similar lack of effect.;Since TA and AA do not stimulate uveal melanoma cell growth, it seems to be safe to use these drugs to treat radiation retinopathy after irradiation for uveal melanoma. Additional experiments using more cell lines or primary tumor cell cultures are needed to validate this conclusion. Furthermore, the results of our study suggest that TA does not exert its antileakage effect through downregulation of VEGF-A or upregulation of TSP-1 or PEDF in uveal melanoma cell lines. It is possible that TA and AA influence these pro- and antiangiogenic factors only under hypoxic circumstances. Further investigation is needed.",

The treated tumor cells also became immunogenic and were rejected in 70% of syngeneic C57BL/6 recipients, whereas these tumor cells produced progressively growing tumors in 100% of irradiated (550 R) or nude mice. In contrast to the effects of N-methyl-N'-nitronitrosoguanidine treatment, no influence of H-2 antigen expression or tumorigenicity was found when BL6 melanoma cells were treated with 5-azacytidine, phorbol myristate acetate, 5-bromodeoxyuridine, theophylline, or 6-thioguanine. H-2 antigen expression and the tumorigenic properties of 48 individual clones derived from BL6T2 melanoma line and 15 clones from the original BL6 melanoma were investigated. No H-2 antigens were found on the cell surface of the parental BL6 clones, whereas all tum- clones from the BL6T2 line expressed high levels of H-2 antigens. Although four of six tested tum+ clones had high levels of H-2b antigen expression similar to that of tum- clones, they were nonimmunogenic. These data indicate that an increase in major histocompatibility complex antigen expression is essential but not sufficient for the immunogenicity of tumor cells. This conclusion was also supported by the results of interferon treatment of BL6 melanoma cells: this induced an increase in the expression of beta 2-microglobulin and Class 1 H-2b antigens but not an increase in their immunogenicity. Detection of tumor-associated transplantation antigens on the melanoma cells also appeared to be dependent on the level of expression of H-2 antigens. Although tum+ clones grew in normal mice, immune mice were able to prevent the growth of tum+ clones with high levels of H-2 antigens. However, immune mice only partially inhibited the growth of the parental BL6 melanoma or tum+ clones which have low expression of H-2 antigens.",

The increased survival of melanoma cells is due to their production of growth factors for autocrine growth stimulation. Here, we describe a strategy to inhibit pleiotrophin (PTN), a heparin-binding autocrine growth factor for melanoma cells. To target PTN production in melanoma cells, a replication-deficient, recombinant adenovirus was generated to express antisense (AS) PTN at high efficiency. The AS vector induced transcripts that completely inhibited PTN protein production. Melanoma growth was strongly inhibited if the tumor cells were maintained in a three-dimensional environment in soft agar, whereas cell growth was not affected if the tumor cells were grown as a monolayer, suggesting the importance of cell-matrix interactions for the biological activity of this growth factor. The down-regulation of PTN in transduced melanoma cells coincided with the down-regulation of the cell-cycle regulator cyclin E and the up-regulation of the cell-cycle inhibitor p21WAF1/Cip1. Tumor growth in vivo was also delayed by the AS-PTN vector, confirming that PTN is essential for the three-dimensional growth of tumor cells.

We found that the enhanced invasiveness through Matrigel-coated filters of B16 murine melanoma cells stimulated with IFNgamma was associated with an higher expression of uPAR and MMP-9 in these cells. Moreover, treatment with anti-MMP-9 or anti-uPAR monoclonal antibodies abrogated the increase of invasiveness in IFNgamma-stimulated melanoma cells, suggesting a cooperation of uPA system and MMP-9 in cytokine-stimulated invasiveness. Invasiveness through Matrigel was also enhanced in B16 melanoma cells exposed to a medium conditioned by TAMs, represented in our experimental model by thioglycollate-elicited macrophages co-cultivated with melanoma cells. Macrophages isolated from these co-cultures were found to express higher levels of uPAR and MMP-9 compared to macrophage cultures alone, and the pro-invasive activity of the co-culture-conditioned medium was abrogated by anti-MMP-9 monoclonal antibodies, but not anti-uPAR monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, the enhanced uPAR and MMP-9 expression in macrophages co-cultivated with tumor cells seems a rather specific phenomenon, generated through a cell-to-cell contact mechanism.

This led us to investigate the effect of inhibitory Smad7 overexpression on melanoma cell behavior. Using the highly metastatic cell line, 1205-Lu, we thus generated melanoma cell clones constitutively expressing Smad7, and their mock-transfected counterparts. Stable expression of Smad7 resulted in an inhibition of constitutive Smad2/3 phosphorylation, and in a reduced TGF-beta response of Smad3/Smad4-driven gene transactivation, as measured using transfected Smad3/4-specific reporter gene constructs. Smad7 overexpression, however, did not alter their proliferative capacity and resistance to TGF-beta-driven growth inhibition. On the other hand, expression of Smad7 efficiently reduced the capacity of human melanoma cells to invade Matrigel in Boyden migration chambers, while not affecting their motility and adhesion to collagen and laminin. Gelatin zymography identified reduced MMP-2 and MMP-9 secretion by Smad7-expressing melanoma cells as compared with their control counterparts. Smad7-expressing melanoma cells exhibited a dramatically reduced capacity to form colonies under anchorage-independent culture conditions, and, when injected subcutaneously into nude mice, were largely delayed in their ability to form tumors.

MART-1(27-35)-specific bulk CTL cultures were generated by pulsing normal PBL with MART-1(27-35) peptide. These CTL cultures specifically kill M202 melanoma cells (MART-1(+), HLA A2.1(+), FasR(-)), and MART-1(27-35) peptide-pulsed T2 cells (FasR(+)), but not M207 melanoma cells (MART-1(+), HLA A2.1(-), FasR(-)), FLU(58-66) peptide-pulsed T2 cells, or DU145 and PC-3 prostate cells (MART-1(-), HLA A2.1(-), FasR(+)). CDDP (0.1-10 microg/ml) sensitized non-MART-1(27-35) peptide-pulsed T2 to the CD8(+) subset of bulk MART-1-specific CTL, and killing was abolished by neutralizing anti-Fas Ab. Furthermore, CDDP up-regulated FasR expression and FasL-mediated killing of M202, and sensitized PC-3 and DU145 to killing by bulk MART-1-specific CTL cultures. These findings demonstrate that drug-mediated sensitization can potentiate FasL-mediated killing by MHC-restricted CTL cell lines, independent of MHC and MART-1 expression on tumor cells. This represents a novel approach for potentially controlling tumor cell variants found in primary heterogeneous melanoma tumor cell populations that would normally escape killing by MART-1-specific immunotherapy.",

In the case of uveal melanoma, the principal malignancy of the eye, complete removal of the primary tumor by enucleation can nonetheless be followed by metastatic tumor growth in distant organs months, years, or even decades later. This suggests that tumor cells have already spread to secondary sites at the time of treatment and remain dormant as micrometastases. Identifying factors that govern long-lived survival of metastatic tumor cells is therefore key to decreasing mortality associated with this and other diseases. While investigating factors differentially expressed in melanoma cells and normal melanocytes, we identified the receptor tyrosine kinase Axl and found up-regulation of Axl in uveal melanomas and melanoma cell lines by RNase protection, Western analysis, and immunohistochemistry. Axl has been shown to mediate cell growth and survival through its ligand Gas6 in non-transformed cells. To test whether stimulation of Axl can enhance survival of uveal melanoma cells, we assessed the degree of mitogenesis and cell survival by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and trypan blue exclusion, respectively, upon stimulation of Mel 290 uveal melanoma cells with Gas6 in vitro. We show that Gas6 mediates mitogenesis and cell survival in Mel 290 cells. We further demonstrate that these effects occur specifically through the Axl receptor by modulating the expression of Axl with an antisense construct. cDNA microarray analysis of 12,687 genes then revealed that Gas6 stimulation of Axl in Mel 290 cells results primarily in the down-regulation of Cyr61, a member of the CCN protein family involved in tumor progression. These data show that the Axl pathway mediates increased survival of uveal melanoma cells, potentially advantageous during cancer dormancy, and that Axl may function in part through regulation of Cyr61.",

A range of different transporters deliver each specific amino acid into cells, some of which are increased in cancer. These amino acids consequently activate the mTORC1 pathway and drive cell cycle progression. The leucine transporter LAT1/4F2hc heterodimer assembles as part of a large complex with the glutamine transporter ASCT2 to transport amino acids. In this study, we show that the expression of LAT1 and ASCT2 is significantly increased in human melanoma samples and is present in both BRAF(WT) (C8161 and WM852) and BRAF(V600E) mutant (1205Lu and 451Lu) melanoma cell lines. While inhibition of LAT1 by BCH did not suppress melanoma cell growth, the ASCT2 inhibitor BenSer significantly reduced both leucine and glutamine transport in melanoma cells, leading to inhibition of mTORC1 signaling. Cell proliferation and cell cycle progression were significantly reduced in the presence of BenSer in melanoma cells in 2D and 3D cell culture. This included reduced expression of the cell cycle regulators CDK1 and UBE2C. The importance of ASCT2 expression in melanoma was confirmed by shRNA knockdown, which inhibited glutamine uptake, mTORC1 signaling and cell proliferation. Taken together, our study demonstrates that ASCT2-mediated glutamine transport is a potential therapeutic target for both BRAF(WT) and BRAF(V600E) melanoma.",

The role of the ET-1 axis in the proliferation and/or apoptosis of melanoma cells and in their response to the alkylating agent, dacarbazine (DTIC), used in clinical treatment of human melanoma were investigated in five human melanoma cell lines obtained form surgical resection specimens. Melanoma cells expressed the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for the components of the ET-1 axis. ET-1 binding was mediated by ET(B) but was inhomogeneous among melanoma cells. Exogenous ET-1 did not induce human melanoma cell proliferation. Bosentan, a dual ET(A/B)-receptor antagonist, decreased melanoma cell viability and DNA synthesis and induced melanoma cell apoptosis in defined human melanoma cells. Bosentan potentiated Fas ligand-induced apoptosis only in one melanoma cell line. Variants of ET(B)were determined using reverse transcriptase (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and primers spanning the whole sequence of the ET(B)gene. ET(B)variants were demonstrated only in one of the five cell lines, corresponding to the absence of ET-1 binding by these cells. Bosentan did not inhibit the effects of alkylating agents, and the effects of bosentan and alkylating agents were additive in melanoma cells. In conclusion, exogenous ET-1 is not a growth factor for human melanoma cells, but blockade of ET receptors decreases proliferation, induces apoptosis, and potentiates the effects of anticancer agents in defined melanoma cells, suggesting that combination therapy of ET-receptor antagonists with alkylating agents may improve their efficacy.",

Over the last three decades, there has been an increased focus on the role of the tumor microenvironment in cancer progression, with the goal of reversing the metastatic phenotype. Here, using an embryonic chick model, we explore the possibility of reverting the metastatic melanoma phenotype to its cell type of origin, the neural-crest-derived melanocyte. GFP-labeled adult human metastatic melanoma cells were transplanted in ovo adjacent to host chick premigratory neural crest cells and analyzed 48 and 96 h after egg reincubation. Interestingly, the transplanted melanoma cells do not form tumors. Instead, we find that transplanted melanoma cells invade surrounding chick tissues in a programmed manner, distributing along host neural-crest-cell migratory pathways. The invading melanoma cells display neural-crest-cell-like morphologies and populate host peripheral structures, including the branchial arches, dorsal root and sympathetic ganglia. Analysis of a melanocyte-specific phenotype marker (MART-1) and a neuronal marker (Tuj1) revealed a subpopulation of melanoma cells that invade the chick periphery and express MART-1 and Tuj1. Our results demonstrate the ability of adult human metastatic melanoma cells to respond to chick embryonic environmental cues, a subset of which may undergo a reprogramming of their metastatic phenotype. This model has the potential to provide insights into the regulation of tumor cell plasticity by an embryonic milieu, which may hold significant therapeutic promise.",

During these processes, proteolytic activities of tumor and stromal cells modify the extracellular matrix to produce a microenvironment suitable for their growth and migration. In recent years the family of ADAM proteases has been ascribed important roles in these processes. ADAM-9 is expressed in human melanoma at the tumor-stroma border where direct or indirect interactions between tumor cells and fibroblasts occur. To analyze the role of ADAM-9 for the interaction between melanoma cells and stromal fibroblasts, we produced the recombinant disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domain of ADAM-9 (DC-9). Melanoma cells and human fibroblasts adhered to immobilized DC-9 in a Mn(2+)-dependent fashion suggesting an integrin-mediated process. Inhibition studies showed that adhesion of fibroblasts was mediated by several β1 integrin receptors independent of the RGD and ECD recognition motif. Furthermore, interaction of fibroblasts and high invasive melanoma cells with soluble recombinant DC-9 resulted in enhanced expression of MMP-1 and MMP-2. Silencing of ADAM-9 in melanoma cells significantly reduced cell adhesion to fibroblasts. Ablation of ADAM-9 in fibroblasts almost completely abolished these cellular interactions and melanoma cell invasion in vitro. In summary, these results suggest that ADAM-9 expression plays an important role in mediating cell-cell contacts between fibroblasts and melanoma cells and that these interactions contribute to proteolytic activities required during invasion of melanoma cells.",

Human melanoma tumor cell lines were transduced with a MoMLV-based retroviral vector carrying the human gamma IFN gene. The transduced cells expressed the cytokine gene, secreted biologically active gamma IFN, and exhibited enhanced expression of MHC class I and class II (HLA-DR), and ICAM-1 surface antigens.

Seven of the 20 lymphocyte cultures showed substantial increases in lytic activity following stimulation with the transduced melanoma cells in comparison to control lymphocyte cultures stimulated with unmodified parental melanoma. The cytolytic activity stimulated with gamma IFN-modified melanomas was mediated partly by MHC-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes and partly by NK cells. Lymphocyte cultures that displayed increases in cytotoxicity after stimulation with the gamma IFN-transduced melanoma cells also exhibited enhanced expression or induction of one or more of the following lymphokines: IL-4, IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, gamma IFN, and TNF-alpha.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Positive autologous MLTC was found in all of six DR+ primary melanomas, whereas the two DR-tumors were unable to stimulate autologous lymphocytes. An anti-DR but not an anti-DC monoclonal antibody was able to block the proliferation of lymphocytes induced by an autologous primary melanoma. Neither MLTC nor cell-mediated killing was obtained with either DR+ or DR-metastatic melanoma. In 60% of the cases tested, however, DR+ metastatic melanoma cells were able to stimulate allogeneic lymphocytes of normal individuals. Increased expression of DR antigens was induced by in vitro treatment with human gamma-interferon in metastatic tumor cells; this caused an increase in the proliferation of allogeneic but not autologous lymphocytes.

Whereas metastatic melanoma deposits typically are not inflamed and contain relatively few lymphocytes and dendritic immune cells, immunization with autologous melanoma-cell vaccine may induce a clinical inflammatory response associated with mononuclear-cell infiltration. In this study, we characterize immune responses to dermal and subcutaneous melanoma metastases in dinitrophenyl (DNP)-pre-sensitized patients immunized with DNP-conjugated melanoma cells. Patients so treated develop cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity responses to DNP-conjugated autologous mononuclear cells, and approximately one-half show clinical evidence of inflammation and regression of metastases within 2-4 months. Whereas pre-vaccination biopsies of metastatic melanoma failed to reveal significant infiltration by lymphocytes, biopsies obtained after vaccination and coincident with clinical inflammation were markedly infiltrated preponderantly by T cells with a CD8+ phenotype. Clustering of these cells about individual degenerating melanoma cells in a manner analogous to \"satellitosis\" was a consistent feature of this reaction. Enhanced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR by melanoma cells were invariably associated with zones of T-cell infiltration, whereas diminished or absent expression was observed in relatively unaffected regions of tumors. Numerous HLA-DR+, CD4+, CD1-, Leu-1- dendritic cells were also associated with zones of early T-cell infiltration. These data indicate that clinical inflammation and regression of metastatic melanoma induced by autologous melanoma-cell vaccine involves activated T cells with cytotoxic-suppressor phenotype and dendritic cells putatively capable of local antigen presentation. ICAM-1 upregulation on melanoma cells is a likely mediator of ligand interaction between infiltrating T cells and target cells in this model of antigen-induced host anti-tumor response. Structural alterations identified in this setting (e.g., tumor cell satellitosis) may provide additional insight into identifying features of naturally occurring host immune responses to primary cutaneous melanomas.",

In this study we produced a MV3 melanoma cell line with inducible expression of the hyaluronan synthase 3 (HAS3) and studied its effect on the behavior of the melanoma cells. HAS3 overexpression expanded the cell surface hyaluronan coat and decreased melanoma cell adhesion, migration and proliferation by cell cycle arrest at G1/G0. Melanoma cell migration was restored by removal of cell surface hyaluronan by Streptomyces hyaluronidase and by receptor blocking with hyaluronan oligosaccharides, while the effect on cell proliferation was receptor independent.

Here we use a series of melanoma cell lines that recapitulate the phenotypic characteristics of melanomas at varying stages of malignant progression to evaluate the expression levels of Id1 in this model system and determine the mechanism of Id1 dysregulation in these tumor cells. We find elevated protein levels of Id1 to be present consistently in radial growth phase tumor cells in accordance with our primary tumor data. Id1 transcript levels were also found to be elevated in these radial growth phase melanoma cells without any appreciable evidence of gene amplification and Id1 promoter activity was found to correlate with Id expression levels. We therefore conclude that Id1 expression is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level in radial growth phase melanomas and expect that therapies that target Id1 gene expression may be useful in the treatment of Id-associated malignancies.",

Using a progressive human melanoma tissue microarray, we previously demonstrated that melanocytes accumulate Gal-3 during the progression from benign to dysplastic nevi to melanoma and further to metastatic melanoma. Herein, we show that silencing of Gal-3 expression with small hairpin RNA results in a loss of tumorigenic and metastatic potential of melanoma cells. In vitro, Gal-3 silencing resulted in loss of tumor cell invasiveness and capacity to form tube-like structures on collagen (\"vasculogenic mimicry\"). cDNA microarray analysis after Gal-3 silencing revealed that Gal-3 regulates the expression of multiple genes, including endothelial cell markers that appear to be aberrantly expressed in highly aggressive melanoma cells, causing melanoma cell plasticity. These genes included vascular endothelial-cadherin, which plays a pivotal role in vasculogenic mimicry, as well as interleukin-8, fibronectin-1, endothelial differentiation sphingolipid G-protein receptor-1, and matrix metalloproteinase-2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and promoter analyses revealed that Gal-3 silencing resulted in a decrease of vascular endothelial-cadherin and interleukin-8 promoter activities due to enhanced recruitment of transcription factor early growth response-1. Moreover, transient overexpression of early growth response-1 in C8161-c9 cells resulted in a loss of vascular endothelial-cadherin and interleukin-8 promoter activities and protein expression. Thus, Gal-3 plays an essential role during the acquisition of vasculogenic mimicry and angiogenic properties associated with melanoma progression.",

The canonical function of adipocytes is to store triglyceride and release fatty acids for other tissues. This study was aimed to find out if adipocytes promoted melanoma cell growth and to investigate the underlying mechanism. Here we isolated adipocytes from inguinal adipose tissue in mice and co-cultured with melanoma cells. We found that the co-cultured melanoma had higher lipid accumulation compared with mono-cultured melanoma. In addition, fluorescently labeled fatty acid BODIPY® FLC16 signal was detected in melanoma co-cultured with the adipocytes that had been loaded with the fluorescent dye, suggesting that the adipocytes provide fatty acids to melanoma cells. Compared with mono-cultured melanoma, co-cultured melanoma cells had a higher proliferation and phospho-Akt (Ser-473 and Thr-450) expression. Overexpression of Akt mutants in melanoma cells reduced the co-culture-enhanced proliferation. A lipidomic study showed that the co-cultured melanoma had an elevated palmitic acid level. Interestingly, we found that palmitic acid stimulated melanoma cell proliferation, changed the cell cycle distribution, and increased phospho-Akt (Ser-473 and Thr-450) and PI3K but not phospho-PTEN (phosphophosphatase and tensin homolog) expressions. More importantly, the palmitic acid-stimulated proliferation was further enhanced in the Akt-overexpressed melanoma cells and was reduced by LY294002 or knockdown of endogenous Akt or overexpression of Akt mutants. We also found that palmitic acid-pretreated B16F10 cells were grown to a significantly larger tumor in mice compared with control cells. Taken together, we suggest that adipocytes may serve as an exogenous source of palmitic acid that promotes melanoma cell growth by activating Akt. ",

Parallel with progression, melanoma acquires a rich vascular network, whereas an increasing number of tumor cells express the laminin receptor, which enables their adhesion to the vascular wall, favouring tumor cell extravasation and metastases.

IFNβ gene lipofection was not cytotoxic for only one canine melanoma cell line. When cultured as monolayers, three human and three canine IFNβ-lipofected melanoma cell lines displayed a remarkable bystander effect. As spheroids, the same six cell lines were sensitive to IFNβ gene transfer, two displaying a significant multicell resistance phenotype. The effects of conditioned IFNβ-lipofected canine melanoma cell culture media suggested the release of at least one soluble thermolabile cytotoxic factor that could not be detected in human melanoma cells. By using a secretion signal-free truncated human IFNβ, we showed that its intracellular expression was enough to induce cytotoxicity in two human melanoma cell lines. The lower cytoplasmatic levels of reactive oxygen species detected after intracellular IFNβ expression could be related to the resistance displayed by one human melanoma cell line. As IFNβ gene transfer was effective against most of the assayed melanomas in a way not limited by relatively low lipofection efficiencies, the clinical potential of this approach is strongly supported.

In a murine model of melanoma, MFG-E8 enhanced tumorigenicity and metastatic capacity through Akt-dependent and Twist-dependent pathways. MFG-E8 augmented melanoma cell resistance to apoptosis, triggered an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and stimulated invasion and immune suppression. In human melanoma cells, MFG-E8 knockdown attenuated Akt and Twist signaling and thereby compromised tumor cell survival, EMT, and invasive ability. MFG-E8-deficient human melanoma cells also showed increased sensitivity to small molecule inhibitors of insulin-like growth factor I receptor and c-Met.

Searching for TGF-beta target genes that are under control of Sno interference, Id1 but not antiproliferative genes p21, p15, p57 and p27 was identified in the cell clones after antisense Sno expression.

Tumoral cells expressing Fas ligand (FasL) have been proposed to \"counterattack\" against activated antitumoral effector immune cells, although some authors have indicated that FasL is not expressed on the surface of the same tumors, such in the case of melanoma cells. However, other factors could be implicated, such as the balance of soluble versus membrane-bound forms or the secretion of death ligands on the surface of microvesicles, as described previously by our group in human T cells. In the present study, we analyzed the expression and secretion of FasL and APO2 ligand (APO2L)/TRAIL in the human melanoma cell line MelJuSo. We have observed the expression of preformed FasL and APO2L/TRAIL in these cells, their secretion associated with microvesicles upon melanoma activation with PHA or with alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), and the toxicity of these microvesicles against normal human T cell blasts. We have also observed that the mechanism of secretion of FasL and APO2L/TRAIL from melanoma cells is depending both on microtubules and actin filaments. From these data, it can be concluded that the MelJuSo melanoma cell line has the possibility to \"counterattack\" against activated immune effector cells. However, the in vivo outcome seems more complex since it has been also described that FasL expressed in tumors has a proinflammatory effect.",

Cysteine proteases contribute to invasive properties of many cancer cell types. To analyze the contribution of cysteine proteases to metastasis we have over-expressed in B16 melanoma cells the natural cysteine protease inhibitor, cystatin C. We measured in vitro invasion of cystatin over-expression clones with Boyden chamber type assays. Tail-vein injections of cells were used to compare lung tumor colonization. Subcutaneous tumor growth and tumor cell metastasis from primary tumors were also analyzed. Apoptosis of tumor cells was measured in lung tissues following melanoma cell injection. RESULTS: Results show the in vitro invasion of cystatin C over-expressing cells was dramatically inhibited. Lung tumor colonization was also reduced. Increased tumor cell apoptosis was found to be an important factor and may be related to the reduced tumor burden noted in this system of melanoma metastasis. CONCLUSION: Cysteine proteases therefore, may be a target for future anti-metastatic therapies.",

Transcriptional targeting of adenovirus to tumor cells, thereby limiting their expression to specific cell types, represents one experimental approach to this problem. We have previously shown that a recombinant adenovirus containing the murine tyrosinase promoter coupled to a dimer of the tyrosinase-enhancer element can target the expression of beta-galactosidase cDNA to melanoma cells. We now report that this same promoter/enhancer cassette can efficiently drive the expression of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene in melanoma cells. Infection of melanoma cells with the AdmTyr-tk virus along with subsequent ganciclovir treatment induces S phase cell cycle arrest associated with a profound change in cell size and morphology. Treated cells remain viable for prolonged periods, but clonogenic assays demonstrate that the cell cycle arrest is irreversible. In contrast, nonmelanoma cells are unaffected by this treatment regimen, exhibiting normal growth kinetics, metabolic activity, and cell cycle progression. The therapeutic efficacy of the AdmTyr-tk virus was tested in vivo using a xenograft model of human melanoma. The injection of the AdmTyr-tk virus into established subcutaneous tumor nodules in combination with systemic ganciclovir administration led to a decreased tumor growth rate and to complete tumor regressions in some cases.

A better understanding of the genetic and epigenetic changes responsible for melanoma formation and progression could result in the development of more effective treatments. Advanced melanomas are known to exhibit widespread promoter region CpG island methylation leading to the inactivation of key tumor suppressor genes. Meta-analyses of relevant microarray data sets revealed the hematopoietic stem cell regulator gene latexin (LXN) to be commonly downregulated in approximately 50% of melanomas. The CpG island in the promoter region of LXN was almost universally hypermethylated in melanoma cell lines and tumors, and treatment of the cell lines with the demethylating drug 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine resulted in increased LXN expression. In this paper, we demonstrate that the exogenous expression of LXN in melanoma cell lines results in a significant inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. In addition, we show that the increased expression of LXN in these lines correlates with reduction in the expression levels of stem cell transcription factors OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, KLF4, and MYCN, indicating that LXN may exert its tumor-suppressive function by altering the stem cell-like properties of melanoma cells.",

Purified gangliosides in aqueous solution form micelles and, at high density, form lactones.

Evidence is accruing to show that the nature of the fatty acid moiety of gangliosides differs in normal and neoplastic cells. Gangliosides per se are not immunogenic and require extrinsic adjuvanticity. Preparation of a melanoma cell vaccine for active immunotherapy requires an understanding of the ganglioside profile of melanoma, the ganglioside-associated heterogeneity of melanoma, and the role of shed melanoma gangliosides in the immunosuppression of cell mediated and humoral immunity. In addition, the role of some of the anti-ganglioside antibodies in the elimination of shed gangliosides, the cytotoxic killing of tumor cells, as well as in the down-regulation of lymphocyte functions must be considered in the formulation of vaccine.

The D6.1-defined antigen is present on the cell membrane of melanoma cells maintained in tissue culture but is not detected in spent culture media. Eighteen of twenty-three melanoma cell lines tested were found to react with D6.1, in contrast to only 17% of nonmelanoma tumor cell lines. Among those reactive nonmelanoma tumor lines were 3/3 colon adenocarcinomas tested. Melanoma cells, in general, express greater quantities of this antigen than do reactive nonmelanomas. Similar data were obtained using immunoperoxidase techniques on frozen sections of fresh tumor. All melanomas tested (8/8) stained intensely, although there was tumor cell heterogeneity.

Because melanoma often shows extracellular pH low enough to influence host cell as tumor cell behavior, the aim of this study is to elucidate whether acidity affects cross talk between MSC and melanoma cells to disclose new liaisons promoting melanoma progression, and to offer new therapeutic opportunities. We found that MSC grown in a low pH medium (LpH-MSC) stimulate melanoma xenografts more than MSC grown in a standard pH medium. LpH-MSC express a higher level of TGFβ that is instrumental of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like phenotype induction in melanoma cells. LpH-MSC profile also shows a switching to an oxidative phosphorylation metabolism that was accompanied by a forced glycolytic pathway of melanoma cells grown in LpH-MSC-conditioned medium. Metformin, an inhibitor of mitochondrial respiratory chain was able to reconvert oxidative metabolism and abrogate TGFβ expression in LpH-MSC. In addition, esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor activated in acidosis, blocked TGFβ expression in LpH-MSC through the downregulation of IkB. Both agents, metformin and esomeprazole, inhibited EMT profile in melanoma cells grown in LpH-MSC medium, and reduced glycolytic markers. Thus, acidosis of tumor microenvironment potentiates the pro-tumoral activity of MSC and orchestrates for a new potential symbiosis, which could be target to limit melanoma progression. ",

Spent synthetic media was found to be an enriched serum free source for the initial isolation of 100 kilodalton secreted glycoprotein MAA. M14 melanoma cells grown in synthetic media were also shown to be adaptable to the double agar clonogenic assay facilitating the examination of clonal heterogeneity in functional studies of MAA in melanoma tumor biology. Recent investigations from this laboratory have focused on characterizing human melanoma associated antigens (MAA) found either as secreted or cell surface associated glycoproteins in human melanoma cell lines. In these studies, monoclonal and polyclonal antiserums to melanoma cell components have been developed to specifically identify these MAAs immunochemically and provide a means to study the structural biochemistry of these determinants. At this time we have identified two antigens on which our research efforts are targeted: 1) a 100,000 dalton secreted glycoprotein (100K) common to melanoma, sarcoma and neuroblastoma tumor cell lines, and 2) a 250,000 dalton-high molecular weight component glycoprotein-proteoglycan complex which is thus far restricted to melanoma cells.

Furthermore, Cx-43 promoter activity was significantly inhibited in PAR-1-silenced cells, suggesting that PAR-1 regulates Cx-43 at the transcriptional level. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies showed a reduction in the binding of SP-1 and AP-1 transcription factors to the promoter of Cx-43. Both transcription factors have been shown previously to be required for maximal Cx-43 promoter activity. These results were corroborated by mutating the AP-1 and SP-1 binding sites resulting in decreased Cx-43 promoter activity in PAR-1-positive cells. Moreover, as Cx-43 has been shown to facilitate arrest of circulating tumor cells at the vascular endothelium, melanoma cell attachment to endothelial cells was significantly decreased in PAR-1-silenced cells, with this effect being abrogated after PAR-1 rescue. Herein, we report that up-regulation of PAR-1 expression, seen in melanoma progression, mediates high levels of Cx-43 expression. As both SP-1 and AP-1 transcription factors act as positive regulators of Cx-43, our data provide a novel mechanism for the regulation of Cx-43 expression by PAR-1. Indeed, Cx-43 expression was restored following PAR-1 rescue in PAR-1-silenced cells. Taken together, our data support the tumor promoting function of Cx-43 in melanoma.",

Several melanoma cell lines were included in the analysis. Administration of TAM at a concentration of 15 microm or more resulted in cell death of the melanoma cells within 48 h. TAM treatment was correlated to a slight to moderate inhibition of IGF-1 binding to IGF-1R. Since it has been reported that TAM can increase the release of IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) we then investigated whether this mechanism could underly the decreased IGF-1 binding. However, we could demonstrate that the amount of released IGFBPs were unchanged or decreased in TAM-treated cells. Whereas TAM did not have any strong effect on IGF-1 binding and the expression of IGF-1R at the cell surface, it was was found to efficently block tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-1R beta-subunit.

Tumor cells from 12 melanoma and 2 renal cell carcinoma patients were transduced with retroviral vectors containing the gene for IFN gamma. Northern blot analysis showed IFN gamma transcripts only in the IFN gamma gene-transduced cells. In both IFN gamma-secreting and non-secreting tumor lines, the cell surface expression of HLA class I and class II molecules increased following transduction. However, the magnitude of the increase in HLA expression appeared to be greater in tumor lines secreting IFN gamma. Two melanoma cell lines were successfully transduced with an IFN alpha retroviral vector. Melanoma cells transduced with the IFN alpha gene contained IFN alpha RNA transcripts and secreted large amounts of IFN alpha. In contrast to cells transduced with the IFN gamma gene, the expression of HLA class II molecules was not increased in the IFN alpha gene-transduced cells. Finally, we tested the ability of HLA.DR+ melanoma cells, which had been transduced with the IFN gamma gene, to stimulate specific cytokine release by autologous CD4+ TIL. Specific secretion of cytokine by TIL occurred when the TIL and IFN gamma gene-transduced tumor cells were cultured together but not when TIL were cultured alone or with control nontransduced tumor cells. These results suggest that molecules newly expressed on the transduced cells promoted antigen presentation and T-cell responses against the transduced tumor cells. The insertion of the IFN gamma gene into melanoma cells may be useful either for active immunization against melanoma or for the generation of TIL to be used in adoptive immunotherapy.",

IL-1 family member proteins are known to be expressed constitutively in many melanoma tumor cells, and we hypothesize that these support molecular pathways of inflammation and facilitate tumor growth. To investigate the expression of IL-1α and IL-1β in melanoma patients, and their association with disease progression, immunohistochemical staining was carried out on tissues from 170 patients including benign nevi, primary melanomas, and metastatic melanomas. IL-1β levels were low (or zero) in benign nevi and higher in primary and metastatic melanomas (P < 0.0001). IL-1α was expressed in about 73% of nevi and 55% of metastatic melanomas, with levels significantly higher in primary tumors (P < 0.0001); most (98%) primary melanoma samples were positive for IL-1α. In vitro studies with seven human melanoma cell lines showed that five cell lines expressed IL-1α and IL-1β proteins and mRNA. We identified for the first time several important downstream signaling pathways affected by endogenous IL-1, including reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, COX-2, and phosphorylated NF-κB inhibitor (IκB) and stress-activated protein kinase/c-jun-NH(2)-kinase; all of which were decreased by siRNA to IL-1s. Downregulation of IL-1α, IL-1β, or MyD88 substantially increased p21 and p53 levels. Treatment with IL-1 receptor type I neutralizing antibody or IL-1 pathway-specific siRNAs led to growth arrest in IL-1-positive melanoma cells. Furthermore, blocking the IL-1 pathway increased autophagy in IL-1-positive melanoma cells. These results indicate that the endogenous IL-1 system is functional in most human melanoma and interrupting its signaling inhibits the growth of IL-1-positive melanoma cells.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Gene therapy is an emerging and promising modality for the treatment of malignant melanoma and other neoplasms for which conventional therapies are inadequate. Various therapeutic genes have shown promise for tumor cell killing. However, successful gene therapy depends on the development of efficient and targeted gene transfer vectors. Here we describe a novel strategy for targeting of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer to melanoma cells. This strategy combines genetic ablation of native adenoviral tropism with redirected viral binding to melanoma cells via a bispecific adapter molecule, a bacterially expressed single-chain diabody, scDb MelAd, that binds to both the adenoviral fiber protein and to the high molecular weight melanoma-associated antigen (HMWMAA). This antigen is widely and specifically expressed on the surface of melanoma cells and its expression is associated with tumor development and progression. Our results showed specific and strong binding of the anti-HMWMAA scFv RAFT3 and the bispecific adapter scDb MelAd to melanoma cells. In adenoviral infection experiments, we demonstrated i) substantially (>50-fold) reduced infectivity of capsid mutant adenoviruses, ii) restored (up to 367-fold increase), CAR-independent and HMWMAA-mediated infectivity of these mutant viruses by scDb MelAd specifically in melanoma cells, and iii) higher levels of transgene expression in melanoma cells by fiber mutant virus complexed with scDbMelAd, relative to a vector with wild-type fibers. We confirmed the utility of this targeting strategy with human primary melanoma cells that represent clinically relevant substrates. These experiments established that the retargeting strategy mediates up to 54-fold increased adenoviral gene transfer to CAR-negative melanoma cells compared to the vector with native tropism. Hence, the HMWMAA-targeted adenoviral vector lacking native tropism exhibits both enhanced specificity and augmented infectivity of gene transfer to melanoma cells, suggesting that it is feasible to use this vector to improve gene therapy for malignant melanoma.",

It was ascertained that EMT characterizes disease progression, including melanoma malignancy. As most solid tumors, melanoma shows extracellular acidosis, we analyse the impact of acidic environment on the EMT development in human melanoma cells. Melanoma cells were exposed to an acidic extracellular environment (pH 6.7) and tested for EMT markers. We found that acidic cells express a significant up-regulation of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, Vimentin), transcription factors (Twist, NF-κB) and a significant, although modest, reduction of E-cadherin expression. Acidic cell also express an increased invasiveness through Matrigel associated with an up-regulation of MMP-9 activity. When we injected acidic cells intravenously into immunodeficient animals, we found a number of lung micrometastases not different from non-acidic cells. Indeed, they show a partial G1 cell cycle arrest, which might interfere with the growth of lung colonies. When we investigated the in vitro invasiveness and lung colonization of a mixed population of acidic and non acidic melanoma cells, we found that acidic cells promote in vitro invasiveness of non-acidic cells and this cooperation leads to an higher migration rate than acidic cells. Moreover, acidic cells cooperate for a better lung colonization of non-acidic cells, that represent the greater part of cells participating to lung micrometastases. We found evidence that acidity triggers in melanoma cells an EMT program, which although \"incomplete\", potentiates migration rate and development of lung colonies into immunodeficient host of cells grown in standard pH.",

        "Doc_abstract":"For more than 15 years, angiotropism in melanoma has been emphasized as a marker of extravascular migration of tumor cells along the abluminal vascular surface, unveiling an alternative mechanism of tumor spread distinct from intravascular dissemination. This mechanism has been termed extravascular migratory metastasis (EVMM). During EVMM, angiotropic tumor cells migrate in a 'pericytic-like' manner (pericytic mimicry) along the external surfaces of vascular channels, without intravasation. Through this pathway, melanoma cells may spread to nearby or more distant sites. Angiotropism is a prognostic factor predicting risk for metastasis in human melanoma, and a marker of EVMM in several experimental models. Importantly, analogies of EVMM and pericytic mimicry include neural crest cell migration, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, and recent studies have suggested that the interaction between melanoma cells and the abluminal vascular surface induce differential expression of genes reminiscent of cancer migration and embryonic/stem cell state transitions. A recent work revealed that repetitive UV exposure of primary cutaneous melanomas in a genetically engineered mouse model promotes metastatic progression via angiotropism and migration along the abluminal vascular surface. Finally, recent data using imaging of melanoma cells in a murine model have shown the progression of tumor cells along the vascular surfaces. Taken together, these data provide support for the biological phenomenon of angiotropism and EVMM, which may open promising new strategies for reducing or preventing melanoma metastasis. ",

Furthermore, evidence suggests that nitric oxide, a reaction product of nitric oxide synthase, exhibits antiapoptotic activity in melanoma cells. We therefore hypothesized that nitric oxide antagonizes chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Whether nitric oxide is capable of regulating cell growth and apoptotic responses to cisplatin treatment in melanoma cell lines was evaluated. We demonstrate herein that depletion of endogenously produced nitric oxide can inhibit melanoma proliferation and promote apoptosis. Moreover, our data indicate that the depletion of nitric oxide leads to changes in cell cycle regulation and enhances cisplatin-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells. Strikingly, we observed that the depletion of nitric oxide inhibits cisplatin-induced wild type p53 accumulation and p21(Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1) expression in melanoma cells. When cisplatin-induced p53 binding to the p21(Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1) promoter was examined, it was found that nitric oxide depletion significantly reduced the presence of p53-DNA complexes after cisplatin treatment. Furthermore, dominant negative inhibition of p53 activity enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Together, these data strongly suggest that endogenously produced nitric oxide is required for cisplatin-induced p53 activation and p21(Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1) expression, which can regulate melanoma sensitivity to cisplatin.",

Northern blot analysis revealed that reduced expression was regulated at the transcriptional level, demonstrating a 79% reduction in MART-1 transcript abundance after 32 hours of IFN-gamma treatment. To evaluate consequences of IFN-gamma exposure for immune recognition, MART-1-responsive T cells were reacted with pretreated HLA-matched melanoma cells. Cytotoxicity was reduced up to 78% by IFN-gamma pretreatment, and was restored by addition of MART-1 peptide AAGIGILTV for 2 hours. Examination of melanoma lesions by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed up to 188-fold more abundant IFN-gamma transcripts when compared to control skin. Laser capture microdissection and immunohistology localized most IFN-gamma-producing T cells to the tumor stroma. Reduced MART-1 expression was frequently observed in adjacent tumor cells.

Here we analyzed the responses to synthetic peptides of HLA-A2.1-restricted CTL clones specific for melanoma antigens MART-1 and NA17-A. We showed that peptide concentrations ranging from 1 pM to 10 nM efficiently sensitized the peptide transporter-deficient T2 cells to lysis. T2 cells pulsed with melanoma peptides also induced TIL proliferation and detectable secretion of IL-2, IFN-gamma and GM-CSF, but only for peptide concentrations 10- to 10,000-fold higher than those required for lysis. Hence this suggests that partial triggering of TIL clones by melanoma cells could be due to expression of appropriate MHC-peptide complexes at subthreshold levels. In support of this, we showed that melanoma cells, unable to trigger IL-2 secretion, developed this ability when incubated with the appropriate peptide.

We cultured human malignant melanoma cells in a medium containing trehalose (control/2.5%/5.0%/7.5%/10.0%) and used the MTT assay to evaluate the growth activities. Subsequently, trehalose was topically instilled on subconjunctivally inoculated melanoma cells in F334/NJcl-rmu/rmu rats, followed by a histopathological evaluation of tumor growth. Using flow cytometry, we compared the distribution of the cell cycle, rate of apoptotic cells, and intracellular factors related to the cell cycle in cultured melanoma cells after trehalose treatment. Results. The MTT study showed that proliferation of melanoma cells was significantly inhibited by ≧ 5% of trehalose concentrations in the culture media. Subconjunctivally inoculated melanoma cell masses were significantly smaller in eyes administered trehalose as compared to controls. Flow cytometry analyses demonstrated that the trehalose groups had increased rates of G2/M phase cells and apoptotic cells in the cell culture. These cells also exhibited increased expressions of cell-cycle inhibitory factors. Conclusions. The current results show trehalose inhibits malignant melanoma cell growth by inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, suggesting trehalose as a potential candidate for a topical agent to inhibit proliferation of malignant tumor cells of the ocular surface.

Most evidence point that these disturbances lead to decreasing of the retinoic acid concentration in tumor cells.

Alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH) are involved in the retinol metabolism, oxidizing retinol, and retinal in retinoic acid or reducing retinal in retinol. In this work we investigated the expression and enzymatic activity of alcohol and ALDH in melanoma cells compared to their benign counterparts. We demonstrated that melanoma cell lines and melanocytes despite similar pattern of the enzyme expression, show different general ALDH activity. Retinal, the substrate of ALDH, could stimulate the ALDH activity through up-regulation of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 1 and aldehyde dehydrogenase 6. Furthermore, we found that retinoids regulate alcohol dehydrogenase activity, probably via effects on alcohol dehydrogenase expression at the post-transcriptional level. We suggest that melanoma cells in contrast to melanocytes should favor the retinal reduction over its oxidation.

By flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, expression of P-glycoprotein was not detectable on the protein level in the 10 cell lines analyzed, although by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, MDR-1 gene expression was demonstrated in 2 of 10 cell lines. In addition, immunohistology revealed P-glycoprotein expression in only 1 of 71 melanocytic lesions. In contrast, MRP was detected in a subset of melanoma cell lines by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunohistology (4 of 10). LRP expression was observed in 8 of 10 melanoma cell lines by immunochemistry and in 10 of 10 by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, MRP was detected immunohistologically in almost 50% of primary and metastatic melanoma specimens, although no significant differences were found between metastases taken before or after chemotherapy.

Normal human melanocytes contained the lowest levels of both PLA(2)s. Cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 (COX-1 and COX-2) were also expressed in cultured tumor cells as measured by Western blots. The most pronounced overexpression of iPLA(2) and COX-1 was found in two melanoma-derived cells, M14 and COLO38. Normal human melanocytes and the M10 melanoma cell line displayed no COX-2 expression. Using subcellular fractionation, Western blot and confocal microcopy analyses, in paradigmatic SK-MEL28 and SK-MEL93 cells we showed that iPLA(2), COX-1 and even cPLA(2) were equally located in the cytosol, membrane structures and perinuclear region while COX-2 was preferentially associated with the cytosol. Specific inhibitors of these three enzymes significantly reduced the basal proliferation rate either in melanocytes or in melanoma cell lines.

The data further indicated an instability of the expression of a melanoma-associated antigen in the course of a long culture period.

A leupeptin analogue inhibiting urokinase inhibited in vitro invasion of human fibrosarcoma cells. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors such as epi-CPL and baicalein inhibited in vitro invasion and in vivo metastasis of mouse melanoma cells.

Although cancer progression depends on a complex network of mechanisms, including inflammation and coagulation, the involvement of tumor-induced endothelium activation and the subsequent release of procoagulatory factors in this process are not well understood. Using tissue sections from patients with malignant melanoma, immunofluorescence studies for the presence of von Willebrand factor (VWF) clearly demonstrated endothelium activation and the formation of ultra-large VWF fibers in these patients. In vitro analyses revealed that supernatants from highly invasive melanoma cells induced an acute endothelium activation measured by VWF, P-selectin, and angiopoietin-2 release. Proteome profiling identified vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) as the main mediator of endothelium activation. Inhibition and knock-down of VEGF-A in melanoma cells led to a rigorous decrease in VWF exocytosis. Selective small-interfering RNA to matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) inhibited endothelium activation, and this effect correlated with reduced VEGF-A content in the supernatants of melanoma cells. Further experiments showed that active MMP-2 regulates VEGF-A in melanoma cells on a transcriptional level via an integrin αvβ5/phosphoinositide-3-kinase-dependent pathway. In conclusion, these results indicate an important role of VEGF-A in acute endothelium activation and provide clear evidence that MMP-2 plays a pivotal role in the autocrine regulation of VEGF-A expression in melanoma cells.",

Because of their capacity to bind the inhibitory receptor, CD94/NKG2A, expressed by NK cells and CTL, HLA-E molecules might play an important role in immunomodulation. In particular, expression of HLA-E might favor tumor cell escape from CTL and NK immunosurveillance. To address the potential role of HLA-E in melanoma immunobiology, we assessed the expression of these molecules ex vivo in human melanoma biopsies and in melanoma and melanocyte cell lines. Melanoma cell lines expressed no or low surface, but significant intracellular levels of HLA-E. We also report for the first time that some of them produced a soluble form of this molecule. IFN-gamma significantly increased the surface expression of HLA-E and the shedding of soluble HLA-E by these cells, in a metalloproteinase-dependent fashion. In contrast, melanocyte cell lines constitutively expressed HLA-E molecules that were detectable both at the cell surface and in the soluble form, at levels that were poorly affected by IFN-gamma treatment. On tumor sections, a majority of tumor cells of primary, but a low proportion of metastatic melanomas (30-70 and 10-20%, respectively), expressed HLA-E. Finally, HLA-E expression at the cell surface of melanoma cells decreased their susceptibility to CTL lysis. These data demonstrate that HLA-E expression and shedding are normal features of melanocytes, which are conserved in melanoma cells of primary tumors, but become dependent on IFN-gamma induction after metastasis. The biological significance of these findings warrants further investigation.",

Biosynthesis of glycans and oligosaccharides is tissue-specific and developmentally regulated by number of glycosyltransferases of which fucosyl-, sialyl- and N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases often participate in synthesis of tumor type glycans. We analyzed the expression of selected glycosyltransferases (real-time PCR): fucosyltransferases FUT-1 and FUT-4, sialyltransferase SIAT4C and beta 1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (MGAT-5), in human melanoma cell lines: WM35 from primary tumor site and WM239, WM9, A375 from metastatic sites. In parallel their proliferation (crystal violet test) and adhesion to fibronectin and collagen IV (BD Biocoat assay) was assessed. Examined cell lines showed expression of all studied glycosyltransferases. The level of expression of fucosyltransferases was significantly higher in melanoma cell lines from metastatic site than from primary cell line: mRNA expression of FUT-1 was 100 times higher in A375 melanoma cell line from metastatic site (A375, solid tumor) than in WM35 primary cell line. The expression of FUT-4 in cell lines from metastatic sites: WM9 (lymph node) and WM239 (skin) was respectively 80 and 37 times higher than in WM 35 primary cell line. In all melanoma cell lines very low expression of MGAT-5 and high expression of SIAT4C was observed. Melanoma cells bound both to fibronectin and to collagen IV. LTA (Lotus tetragonolobus agglutinin), the lectin that specifically recognizes fucose residue of glycans and 20mM L-fucose by itself significantly reduced adhesion of all studied cell lines, both primary and metastatic, to fibronectin (20-50 %) and to collagen IV (20-50 %). In addition LTA reduced the proliferation (20-30 %) of metastatic cell lines (A375, WM9, WM239) and did not affect the growth of primary cell line (WM35).

Endocytosis is thought to play an essential role in the catabolism of HA due to the intracellular compartmentalization of the HA degrading hyaluronidase enzymes. Previous investigations have shown that keratinocytes, chondrocytes and breast tumor cell lines endocytose HA via the cell surface glycoprotein, CD44. However, other cell types endocytose HA using a CD44-independent mechanism that remains to be defined. The purpose of this study was to investigate HA endocytosis in B16-F10 melanoma cells. We found that B16-F10 melanoma cells expressed CD44 on their surfaces. Unexpectedly, CD44 did not play a role in the endocytosis of HA. Electron microscopy studies revealed that B16-F10 melanoma cells exhibited membrane ruffling, a characteristic feature of macropinocytosis, only after incubating the cells with the HA co-polymer. Moreover, B16-F10 melanoma cells endocytosed HA via macropinocytosis as assessed by drug inhibition studies and the co-localization of fluorescently labeled HA with fluorescent tracers under confocal microscopy.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the role and underlying mechanism of mutant GNAQ in the regulation of cell viability and migration of uveal melanoma cells. Uveal melanoma cells containing mutant GNAQ were transfected with scrambled or GNAQ small-interfering RNA. Compared with the control, GNAQ knockdown markedly inhibited cell viability and migration. However, tumor cells without GNAQ mutations exhibited enhanced viability and migration following transfection with HA-GαqQL. Additionally, GNAQ knockdown significantly downregulated the expression of Jag-1 (Notch ligand), Notch intracellular domain and Hes-1 (Notch target gene) in uveal melanoma cells. Conversely, the GNAQ overexpression promoted their expression. Cell viability and migration induced by GNAQ was significantly inhibited following treatment with 5 µmol/l MRK003, a Notch signaling inhibitor. Furthermore, the transfection of human influenza hemagglutinin A epitope (HA)-GαqQL into tumor cells caused Yes-associated protein (YAP) dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation, which stimulated the expression of Jag-1 and Hes-1. Positive correlations were observed between the GNAQ and Jag-1 mRNA levels and between the GNAQ and Hes-1 mRNA levels.

Gab2 protein expression correlated with clinical melanoma progression, and higher levels of expression were seen in metastatic melanomas compared with primary melanoma and melanocytic nevi. We found that overexpression of Gab2 potentiates, whereas silencing of Gab2 reduces, migration and invasion of melanoma cells. Gab2 mediated the hyperactivation of Akt signaling in the absence of growth factors, whereas inhibition of the PI3K-Akt pathway decreased Gab2-mediated tumor cell migration and invasive potential.

Treatment of melanoma cells with IFN-gamma resulted in up-regulation of all HLA class I alleles that was paralleled by the acquisition of resistance to lysis.

Several studies suggested that transfer of an activated ras oncogene into cultured rodent fibroblasts induces susceptibility to natural killer cell (NK)-mediated lysis. Experiments using human tumor cells, however, have produced conflicting data on the effect of ras activation in this respect. In studying the activation of the oncogene c-myc, which is often overexpressed in human melanoma, we have found that in cell lines expressing high levels of Myc protein, the sensitivity to lysis by NK cells was dramatically increased due to reduced expression of Human Leukocyte Antigen B locus products. Since the N-ras oncogene was found to be activated in 15% of human melanomas, we examined the possibility that in melanoma, in analogy to the murine systems, the mutated ras oncogene may influence NK susceptibility of human melanoma cells. Two N-ras genes harboring frequently found mutations were cloned into an expression vector. Transfection of the IGR39D melanoma cell line with wildtype and mutant N-ras constructs yielded several ras-expressing clones that were tested for NK sensitivity. Neither high expression of the wildtype N-ras protein, nor expression of two mutant proteins (N61-arg, N61-lys) was shown to result in enhanced NK-mediated lysis. We conclude that activation of ras oncogenes does not lead to the induction of an NK-sensitive phenotype in human melanoma cells.",

To test this notion, we analyzed the presence of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in 170 melanomas with established NRAS/BRAF mutational status and well-documented clinical follow-up by immunohistochemistry. Several notable observations were obtained: (i) phospho-ERK staining was very heterogeneous within the tumor; (ii) in most cases, ERK was phosphorylated in only a minority of tumor cells; (iii) the percentage of phospho-ERK-positive cells was not correlated with the mutational status of NRAS and/or BRAF; (iv) the Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) was expressed homogeneously in virtually all melanoma samples not reflecting the inhomogeneity of phospho-ERK; and, finally, (v) neither the portion of phospho-ERK-positive tumor cells nor the RKIP staining intensity showed any correlation to the clinical course of the patients. Furthermore, the ability of BRAF mutant melanoma cells to downregulate mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was shown in melanoma cell lines cultured at high densities or under nonadherent conditions.

But the role of UVA in melanoma progression toward an invasive phenotype is still not adequately investigated. For most proliferating tumor cells the preference of aerobic glycolysis has been described as the Warburg effect. Here we investigate the effect of UVA irradiation on changes in the Warburg effect and tumor progression toward invasive potential. On UVA irradiation, melanoma cell lines from initial tumors show an induction of the Warburg effect with increased glucose consumption and lactate production, which is at least partially mediated by reactive oxygen species. Associated with UVA treatment and enhanced lactic acid production, tumor-relevant proteases and in situ invasion is upregulated. Simultaneously, UVA increases intracellular concentrations of progression marker transketolase and activated protein kinase Akt, both involved in metabolic changes that increase with proliferation. Using invasion assays we show that lactic acid, resulting from the UVA enhanced and partially reactive oxygen species-mediated Warburg effect, increases the invasive potential of all melanoma cell lines investigated. Therefore, we demonstrate in melanoma cells that production of lactic acid, induced by UVA irradiation, increases invasiveness of melanoma cells via expression of tumor-relevant proteases. ",

Human MHC class I molecules are encoded by three different loci (HLA-A, -B, and -C). In primary human melanomas as well as melanoma cell lines, HLA class I expression is frequently downregulated in a B locus-specific manner. To study the involvement of promoter elements in HLA-B locus-specific downregulation, a series of reporter constructs containing 5'-flanking sequences of the HLA-A2 and -B7 genes were transfected into melanoma cell lines expressing high and low levels of HLA-B antigens. It is shown that enhancer A, which is generally believed to be a potent enhancer in HLA class I gene transcription, only weakly activates transcription in melanoma cell lines. In contrast, the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE), known to induce MHC class I expression in response to IFNs, as well as a region comprising site alpha/enhancer B significantly stimulate constitutive transcription of HLA class I genes. Although none of the promoter elements tested could be demonstrated to mediate HLA-B locus-specific downregulation, high and low HLA-B melanoma cell lines do differ in ISRE activity as well as in ISRE-binding nuclear factors. The finding that high and low HLA-B melanoma cell lines contain different transcription factors binding to elements not actively involved in the process of HLA-B locus abrogation suggests that these cell lines originate from distinct types of melanocyte precursor cells expressing a different set of transcription factors.",

In this study, we explored a hypothesized inverse relationship between MDA-9 and RKIP in melanoma. Tumor array and cell line analyses confirmed an inverse relationship between expression of MDA-9 and RKIP during melanoma progression. We found that MDA-9 transcriptionally downregulated RKIP in support of a suggested cross-talk between these two proteins. Furthermore, MDA-9 and RKIP physically interacted in a manner that correlated with a suppression of FAK and c-Src phosphorylation, crucial steps necessary for MDA-9 to promote FAK/c-Src complex formation and initiate signaling cascades that drive the MDA-9-mediated metastatic phenotype. Finally, ectopic RKIP expression in melanoma cells overrode MDA-9-mediated signaling, inhibiting cell invasion, anchorage-independent growth, and in vivo dissemination of tumor cells. Taken together, these findings establish RKIP as an inhibitor of MDA-9-dependent melanoma metastasis, with potential implications for targeting this process therapeutically.",

Analysis of BI-69A11 was performed in melanoma cells, a tumor type that commonly exhibits up-regulation of AKT. Treatment of the UACC903 human melanoma cells, harboring the PTEN mutation, with BI-69A11 caused efficient inhibition of AKT S473 phosphorylation with concomitant inhibition of AKT phosphorylation of PRAS40. Treatment of melanoma cells with BI-69A11 also reduced AKT protein expression, which coincided with inhibition of AKT association with HSP-90. BI-69A11 treatment not only caused cell death of melanoma, but also prostate tumor cell lines. Notably, the effect of BI-69A11 on cell death was more pronounced in cells that express an active form of AKT. Significantly, intra-peritoneal injection of BI-69A11 caused effective regression of melanoma tumor xenografts, which coincided with elevated levels of cell death.

The purified immunoconjugates showed similar binding specificity as did the fusion-phage clones. Binding occurred to human melanoma cells but not to human melanocytes or to several other types of normal cells and tumor cells. A 250-kDa melanoma protein was immunoprecipitated by the immunoconjugates and analyzed by mass spectrometry, using two independent procedures. A screen of protein sequence databases showed an exact match of several peptide masses between the immunoprecipitated protein and the core protein of a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, which is expressed on the surface of most human melanoma cells. The Fc effector domain of the immunoconjugates binds natural killer (NK) cells and also the C1q protein that initiates the complement cascade; both NK cells and complement can activate powerful cytolytic responses against the targeted tumor cells. An in vitro cytolysis assay was used to test for an immunoconjugate-dependent specific cytolytic response against cultured human melanoma cells by NK cells and complement. The melanoma cells, but not the human fibroblast cells used as the control, were efficiently lysed by both NK cells and complement in the presence of the immunoconjugates.

It has been previously reported that the substance P and neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor antagonists induce cell proliferation and cell inhibition, respectively, in human melanoma cell lines. Aprepitant is a selective high-affinity antagonist of the human NK-1 receptor. Until now, this drug has been used as an anxiolytic, antidepressant and antiemetic. Moreover, the antitumor action of aprepitant has been previously reported. However, the presence of NK-1 receptors in human melanomas and whether the antitumor action of the NK-1 receptor antagonist aprepitant is exerted on human malignant melanomas have not been previously described. The aims of this study are to show the presence of NK-1 receptors in human malignant melanomas and the antitumoral action of aprepitant against several human melanoma cell lines. Immunoblot analysis was used to determine the presence of NK-1 receptors in human melanoma cell lines, and immunohistochemistry was used to demonstrate NK-1 receptors in human melanoma samples. We performed an in vitro study of the cytotoxicity of the NK-1 receptor antagonist aprepitant on human melanoma cell lines. A coulter counter was used to determine viable cell numbers, followed by application of the tetrazolium compound MTS. The DAPI method was applied to demonstrate apoptosis. We observed that NK-1 receptors were present in all the melanoma samples studied as well as in human melanoma cell lines. We also showed that melanoma cell lines expressed mRNA for the NK-1 receptor. Moreover, after using a knockdown method, we showed that NK-1 receptors are involved in the viability of tumor cells. In this study, we also report that aprepitant, at 10-60 microM concentrations, elicits cell growth inhibition in a concentration-dependent manner in all melanoma cell lines studied, that the specific antitumor action of aprepitant occurs through the NK-1 receptor and that melanoma cell death is due to apoptosis. These findings show for the first time that the NK-1 receptor may be a promising new target and that the NK-1 receptor antagonist aprepitant could be a candidate as a new antitumor drug in the treatment of human melanoma.",

Seventeen melanoma cell lines and 11 nonmelanoma cell lines were infected with recombinant vaccinia virus containing the HLA-A2.1 gene. Infection by the vaccinia virus resulted in expression of functional HLA-A2 molecules on the cell surface of virtually 100% of infected cells within a 3.5-h period. The results showed that 11 of 17 (65%) naturally HLA-A2- melanoma cell lines were specifically lysed by the HLA-A2-restricted, melanoma-specific TIL after infection with the vaccinia-HLA-A2.1 virus. None of the nine human nonmelanoma cell lines tested (three colon cancer, four breast cancer, or two immortalized non-tumor cell lines) or two murine melanoma cell lines were lysed by the HLA-A2-restricted TIL after vaccinia-HLA-A2.1 infection. Coinfection of the vaccinia virus containing the beta 2-microglobulin gene with the vaccinia-HLA-A2.1 virus increased the surface expression of HLA-A2 and subsequent lysis by melanoma-specific tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. With this new method we could extend previous findings demonstrating that shared melanoma Ag recognized by HLA-A2-restricted tumor infiltrating lymphocytes exist among melanoma cells from different patients regardless of HLA type.

        "Doc_abstract":"microRNA-7-5p (miR-7-5p) is a tumor suppressor in multiple cancer types and inhibits growth and invasion by suppressing expression and activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway. While melanoma is not typically EGFR-driven, expression of miR-7-5p is reduced in metastatic tumors compared to primary melanoma. Here, we investigated the biological and clinical significance of miR-7-5p in melanoma. We found that augmenting miR-7-5p expression in vitro markedly reduced tumor cell viability, colony formation and induced cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, ectopic expression of miR-7-5p reduced migration and invasion of melanoma cells in vitro and reduced metastasis in vivo. We used cDNA microarray analysis to identify a subset of putative miR-7-5p target genes associated with melanoma and metastasis. Of these, we confirmed nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) subunit RelA, as a novel direct target of miR-7-5p in melanoma cells, such that miR-7-5p suppresses NF-κB activity to decrease expression of canonical NF-κB target genes, including IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8. Importantly, the effects of miR-7-5p on melanoma cell growth, cell cycle, migration and invasion were recapitulated by RelA knockdown. Finally, analysis of gene array datasets from multiple melanoma patient cohorts revealed an association between elevated RelA expression and poor survival, further emphasizing the clinical significance of RelA and its downstream signaling effectors. Taken together, our data show that miR-7-5p is a potent inhibitor of melanoma growth and metastasis, in part through its inactivation of RelA/NF-κB signaling. Furthermore, miR-7-5p replacement therapy could have a role in the treatment of this disease. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Melanoma is a highly metastatic and malignant skin cancer having poor rates of patient survival. Since the incidence of melanoma is steadily increasing in the population, finding prognostic and therapeutic targets are crucial tasks in cancer. The dioxin receptor (AhR) is required for xenobiotic-induced toxicity and carcinogenesis and for cell physiology and organ homeostasis. Yet, the mechanisms by which AhR affects tumor growth and dissemination are largely uncharacterized. We report here that AhR contributes to the tumor-stroma interaction, blocking melanoma growth and metastasis when expressed in the tumor cell but supporting melanoma when expressed in the stroma. B16F10 cells engineered to lack AhR (small hairpin RNA for AhR) exacerbated melanoma primary tumorigenesis and lung metastasis when injected in AhR+/+ recipient mice but not when injected in AhR- /- mice or when co-injected with AhR-/- fibroblasts in an AhR+/+ stroma. Contrary, B16F10 cells expressing a constitutively active AhR had reduced tumorigenicity and invasiveness in either AhR genetic background. The tumor suppressor role of AhR in melanoma cells correlated with reduced migration and invasion, with lower numbers of cancer stem-like cells and with altered levels of β1-integrin and caveolin1. Human melanoma cell lines with highest AHR expression also had lowest migration and invasion. Moreover, AHR expression was reduced in human melanomas with respect to nevi lesions. We conclude that AhR knockdown in melanoma cells requires stromal AhR for maximal tumor progression and metastasis. Thus, AhR can be a molecular marker in melanoma and its activity in both tumor and stromal compartments should be considered. ",

The function of VLA products on melanoma cells was assessed by adhesion assays to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins using a panel of melanoma clones previously characterized for the presence and heterogeneity of expression of the distinct VLA-alpha subunits. These experiments indicated that intra-tumor heterogeneity in the integrin profile can influence the interaction of neoplastic cells with ECM proteins. Inhibition of adhesion with antibodies to VLA-alpha subunits revealed that the presence on melanoma cells of VLA-alpha 2, VLA-alpha 5 and VLA-alpha 6 is relevant for the adhesion to type-IV collagen, fibronectin and laminin respectively. Culture of tumor cells in the presence of cytokines such as rIL-I beta, rTNF-alpha, rIFN-gamma or TGF-beta I could induce up- or down-modulation in the level of expression of multiple VLA integrins. Cytokine-mediated antigenic shifts in the VLA profile of melanoma cells were detected by cytofluorimetric analysis as early as 24 hr after cytokine exposure. The cytokine-dependent change in the matrix receptor profile of melanoma cells also affected the adhesion to ECM proteins as revealed by the enhanced adhesion of rTNF-alpha-treated cells to fibronectin.

Both colonies adhered to resting human endothelial cells (EC) to the same extent. Pre-treatment of EC for 6 hr with conditioned medium (CM) from colony 6, but not from colony 3, increased the adhesion of A375P melanoma and HT-29 colon-carcinoma cells to EC.

This resistance to treatment is mainly due to high heterogeneity and plasticity of melanoma cells strictly connected to changes in tumor microenvironment. Hypoxia can drastically alter cancer biology. Solid tumor cells under hypoxia gain stem-like features, they are more invasive and drug-resistant than their normoxic counterparts. These effects could be mediated by changes in miRNA expression under hypoxia. MiRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules that can negatively control gene expression. In the present study using microarray technology we evaluated the expression of miRNAs in melanoma cells derived from nodular melanoma and grown under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Using R environment for statistical analysis we found that 70 miRNAs were differentially-expressed, and 16 of them were significantly down-regulated in melanoma cells grown in hypoxic conditions compared to cells grown in normoxia. We intended to find transcripts whose expression is increased due to down-regulation of selected miRNAs. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that increased levels of HIF-2α, ABCB5, OCT4, SOX2 and ZEB1 in different melanoma populations under hypoxia could be a result of significant down-regulation of miR-340-5p. Inhibition of miR-340-5p confirmed that this miRNA negatively influences the expression of ABCB5.

In contrast to SkMel5 cells, treatment of MeWo cells with calcitriol resulted in a dose-dependent increase in mRNA for VDR and 24-OHase as well as in a suppression of cell proliferation (up to approximately 50%). Our findings demonstrate that local synthesis or metabolism of Vitamin D metabolites may be of importance for growth regulation of MM and melanoma cell lines.

Immunoliposomes have been previously shown to enhance the selective localization of immunoliposome-entrapped drugs to solid tumors with improvements in the therapeutic index of the drugs. Previously, we reported that the synthetic retinoid fenretinide (HPR) is an inducer of apoptosis in neuroblastoma (NB) cells, sharing the neuroectodermal origin with melanoma cells. HPR is a strong inducer of apoptosis also in melanoma cells, although at doses 10-fold higher than those achievable clinically. Thus, our purpose was to investigate the in vitro potentiation of its cytotoxic effect on melanoma cells in combination with long-circulating GD2-targeted immunoliposomes. GD2 is a disialoganglioside extensively expressed on tumors of neuroectodermal origin, including melanoma. Murine anti-GD2 antibody (Ab) 14.G2a and its human/mouse chimeric variant ch14.18 have been ligated to sterically stabilized liposomes by covalent coupling of Ab to the polyethylene glycol (PEG) terminus. Ab-bearing liposomes showed specific, competitive binding to and uptake by various melanoma cell lines compared with liposomes bearing non-specific isotype-matched Abs or Ab-free liposomes. Cytotoxicity was evaluated after 2 hr treatment, followed by extensive washing and 72 hr incubation. This treatment protocol was designed to minimize non-specific adsorption of liposomes to the cells, while allowing for maximum Ab-mediated binding. When melanoma cells were incubated with 30 microM HPR entrapped in anti-GD2 liposomes, a significant reduction in cellular growth was observed compared to free HPR, entrapped HPR in Ab-free liposomes or empty liposomes. Cytotoxicity was not evident in tumor cell lines of other origins that did not express GD2. Growth of NB cells was also inhibited by immunoliposomes with entrapped HPR.",

Distinct from non-malignant stem cells, cancer stem cells (CSC) show low proliferative rates, high self-renewing capacity, propensity to differentiate into actively proliferating tumor cells, and resistance to chemotherapy or radiation. They are often characterized by elevated expression of stem cell surface markers, in particular CD133, and sets of differentially expressed stem cell-associated genes. CSC are usually rare in clinical specimens and hardly amenable to functional studies and gene expression profiling. In this study, a panel of heterogenous melanoma cell lines was screened for typical CSC features.;Nine heterogeneous metastatic melanoma cell lines including D10 and WM115 were studied. Cell lines were phenotyped using flow cytometry and clonogenic assays were performed by limiting dilution analysis on magnetically sorted cells. Spheroidal growth was investigated in pretreated flasks. Gene expression profiles were assessed by using real-time rt-PCR and DNA microarrays. Magnetically sorted tumor cells were subcutaneously injected into the flanks of immunodeficient mice. Comparative immunohistochemistry was performed on xenografts and primary human melanoma sections.;D10 cells expressed CD133 with a significantly higher clonogenic capacity as compared to CD133- cells. Na8, D10, and HBL cells formed spheroids on poly-HEMA-coated flasks. D10, Me39, RE, and WM115 cells expressed at least 2 of the 3 regulatory core transcription factors SOX2, NANOG, and OCT4 involved in the maintenance of stemness in mesenchymal stem cells. Gene expression profiling on CD133+ and CD133- D10 cells revealed 68 up- and 47 downregulated genes (+/-1.3 fold). Two genes, MGP and PROM1 (CD133), were outstandingly upregulated. CD133+ D10 cells formed tumors in NSG mice contrary to CD133- cells and CD133 expression was detected in xenografts and primary human melanoma sections using immunohistochemistry.;Established melanoma cell lines exhibit, to variable extents, the typical features of CSCs.

Thus, numerous efforts have been made to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in this phenomenon. B16‑F10 melanoma cells have been demonstrated to be highly metastatic to the lungs in mice. The aim of the current study was to investigate the role of CXC motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) in the metastatic potential of B16‑F10 melanoma cells in mice. In vitro transfection of B16‑F10 tumor cells with CXCR4 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expressing plasmids (CXCR4 shRNA) significantly reduced the expression levels of CXCR4 mRNA (80%) and protein (68%), compared with the control. In addition, these results demonstrated that pulmonary metastasis was significantly inhibited (85%) in mice inoculated with CXCR4 shRNA‑transfected B16‑F10 melanoma cells. The polycation‑based nanoparticle (jetPEI) was used to investigate the effect of CXCR4 knockdown in vivo on the metastatic potential of B16‑F10 melanoma cells. The number of pulmonary metastatic nodules was significantly reduced (50%) in animals that received a retro‑orbital injection of jetPEI‑CXCR4‑1 shRNA. The current study demonstrated that CXCR4 serves a role in the metastatic potential of B16‑F10 melanoma cells. Currently there is a great interest in the development of antagonists for the therapeutic targeting of CXCR4 expression. Taking the results of the current study and the fact that CXCR4 is highly conserved between humans and mice into account, this experimental model of metastasis with B16‑F10 melanoma cells may aid in the discovery of CXCR4 antagonists with clinical implications.

However, little is known about the molecular underpinnings of this phenomenon. On the basis of gene profiling, protein detection, and immunohistochemistry, aggressive relative to poorly aggressive melanoma showed up-regulation of tissue factor (TF), TF pathway inhibitor 1 (TFPI-1) and 2 (TFPI-2), critical genes that initiate and regulate the coagulation pathways. The procoagulant function of TF on highly aggressive melanoma is shown to be regulated by TFPI-1 but not by TFPI-2. Thus, aggressive melanoma exhibits endothelial cell-like anticoagulant mechanisms that may contribute to the fluid-conducting potential of melanoma cell-lined networks, as studied by correlative in vivo Doppler flow measurements. Antibody inhibition experiments reveal that TFPI-2 is required for VM in vitro, but plasmin is an unlikely target protease of TFPI-2. Blockade of TFPI-2 suppressed matrix metalloproteinase-2 activation, and, therefore, TFPI-2 appears to regulate an essential pathway of VM. TFPI-2 is synthesized by endothelial and tumor cells, which deposit TFPI-2 into extracellular matrices. Culturing poorly aggressive melanoma cells on three-dimensional matrix containing recombinant TFPI-2 produces some of the phenotypic changes associated with aggressive, vasculogenic melanoma cells. Thus, TFPI-2 contributes to VM plasticity, whereas TFPI-1 has anticoagulant functions of relevance for perfusion of VM channels formed by TF-expressing melanoma cells.",

However, the intracellular signaling mechanisms which transduce and regulate the AMF motility response remain largely unknown. 12-(S)-HETE, a lipoxygenase metabolite of arachidonic acid which affects the cytoskeletal architecture of murine melanoma cells, also stimulates cell motility independently of PT-sensitive G-proteins and up-regulates gp78 surface expression. 12-(S)-HETE induces the phosphorylation of gp78 in a manner analogous to AMF and the motility response of these murine melanoma cells to both AMF and 12-(S)-HETE is inhibited by protein kinase C inhibitors. Furthermore, perturbation of the AMF receptor stimulated endogenous biosynthesis of 12(S)HETE.

SiRNA inhibition of VEGFR-2 expression abrogated these EMMPRIN effects. EMMPRIN regulation of VEGFR-2 was mediated through the over-expression of HIF-2alpha and its translocation to the nucleus where it forms heterodimers with HIF-1beta. These results were supported by an in vivo correlation between the expression of EMMPRIN with that of VEGFR-2 in human melanoma tissues as well as with the extent of HIF-2alpha localization in the nucleus. They demonstrate a novel mechanism by which EMMPRIN promotes tumor progression through HIF-2alpha/VEGFR-2 mediated mechanism, with an autocrine role in melanoma cell malignancy.

RA activates RA receptors, which function as ligand-dependent transcriptional modulators. S91 murine melanoma cells stop proliferating and then reversibly differentiate into a melanocytic cell type after the administration of RA. The genetic changes that take place during this process serve as an excellent model for the etiology of melanoma. The use of subtractive hybridization techniques yielded several differentially expressed cDNAs that are associated with RA-induced growth arrest. One clone, cyclin D1, is repressed and is probably a differentiation marker. Two other cDNAs represent novel, RA-inducible genes. Expression of another cDNA, clone 10d, is strongly down-regulated. It is the homologue of the human gene BM28 (CDCL1) that is indispensable for entry into S phase and cell division. S91 cells that are permanently transfected with a plasmid that constitutively expresses clone 10d become significantly more resistant to RA, suggesting that repression of this gene is a critical event in RA-induced growth arrest. The use of reverse transcription-PCR for the detection of expression in human melanoma in vitro was performed to study the potential role of clone 10d/BM28 in this disease. It is expressed in 80% of melanoma cell lines but is virtually undetectable in primary melanocytes. The expression of BM28 is not regulated by RA in human, RA-resistant melanoma cells.

Here, we search for novel melanoma-specific genes that may serve as biomarkers and therapeutic targets by using an in vitro genetic screen. One identified cDNA encoded TROY, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF). TROY is widely expressed during embryogenesis, but in adults expression is restricted to hair follicles and brain. However, TROY had never been associated with melanoma, and it was selected for further study. First we show that expression in melanoma is specific by semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of a large panel of established tumor cell lines. Next, specificity of expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry analysis of primary cell cultures and patient tissues. TROY is expressed in 2/2 primary melanoma cells and 45/45 melanoma tissue samples (p < 0.0001). With the exception of sebaceous glands, TROY is not expressed in normal skin biopsies (p < 0.0001) or primary skin cell cultures that contain keratinocytes and epidermal melanocytes, nor is it expressed in other skin tumor cells (p < 0.0001). Finally, we show that TROY regulates melanoma growth, because replication of melanoma cells with reduced TROY levels through treatment with short-interfering RNA was significantly decreased relative to control cells (p < 0.004). In summary, TROY is the first TNFRSF member that is a biomarker for melanoma. TROY also presents a potentially novel cell surface signaling target for inhibitors, cell and/or antibody-based immunotherapies.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the role of IL-8 in tumor growth and metastasis of human melanoma cells. Nonmetastatic SB-2 melanoma cells with negligible levels of IL-8 were transfected with IL-8 cDNA and subsequently analyzed for changes in their tumorigenic and metastatic potential. Enforced expression of IL-8 rendered the melanoma cells highly tumorigenic and increased their metastatic potential as compared with parental and control transfected cells. The IL-8-transfected cells displayed up-regulation in M(r) 72,000 collagenase type IV (MMP-2) mRNA and collagenase activity and increased invasiveness through Matrigel-coated filters. Moreover, when the MMP-2 promoter was linked upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene, CAT activity was up-regulated in IL-8 but not in control transfected cells, suggesting that IL-8 is involved in MMP-2 gene transcription. Activation of type IV collagenase by IL-8 can enhance the invasion of host stroma by the tumor cells and increase angiogenesis and, hence, metastasis.",

Increased ICAM-1 expression corresponds to greater binding of human leukocyte functional antigen-1 (CD11a/CD18)-expressing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to C8161 monolayers, suggesting that cytokine-treated melanoma cells would be more metastatic due to PBMC-tumor cell emboli. The purpose of this study was: (1) to test whether TNF-alpha-treated human melanoma cells are indeed more metastatic than untreated C8161 and (2) to determine whether ICAM-1 plays a role in metastasis of C8161. When surface ICAM-1 expression is upregulated, formation of lung metastases in nude mice increases 1.5- to 4-fold (P < 0.05) for human melanoma cell lines C8161, MeWo, and A375. Treatment of C8161 with ICAM-1 phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides using cationic lipids results in > 90% inhibition of ICAM-1 surface expression as determined by ELISA and flow cytometry. Antisense ICAM-1-treated cells form 41-64% fewer metastases than sham-treated cells. Metastasis does not increase when antisense-treated melanoma cells are exposed to TNF-alpha. However, treatment of C8161 with antisense 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) oligonucleotides inhibits metastases 39% in Lipofectin-treated cells, but does not inhibit TNF-alpha-induced upregulation of experimental metastases. Similar experiments were performed to measure PBMC adhesion to antisense oligonucleotide-treated C8161 cells; however, TNF-alpha-inducible increase in adhesion was unaffected by ICAM-1 or 5-LO antisense oligonucleotides. These results demonstrate that ICAM-1 is involved in melanoma metastasis, but probably not at the step of PBMC adhesion to C8161 cells.",

Injection of B16 melanoma cells, producing endogenous ß endorphin, in the flank of MOR-/- mice revealed a profound reduction in tumor growth, paralleled by a significantly higher infiltration of immune cells into the tumors, when compared to tumor growth after injection of B16 melanoma cells into wild-type mice. Opioids present in B16 cell supernatant significantly reduced the proliferation of normal but not MOR-/- leucocytes. Immunohistochemical analyses of biopsies from human melanoma tissues showed a positive correlation between expression of ß endorphin and tumor progression.

Heparanase (HPSE-1) is an ECM degradative enzyme, which degrades the heparan sulfate (HS) chains of HSPG at specific intrachain sites. To investigate effects of changes in heparanase gene expression in metastatic melanoma cells, we constructed adenoviral vectors containing the full-length human HPSE-1 cDNA in both sense (Ad-S/hep) and antisense orientations (Ad-AS/hep). We found increased HPSE-1 expression and activity in melanoma cell lines following Ad-S/hep infection by Western blot analyses and specific HPSE-1 activity assay. Conversely, HPSE-1 content was significantly inhibited following infection with Ad-AS/Hep. Importantly, HPSE-1 modulation by these adenoviral constructs correlated with invasive cellular properties in vitro and in vivo.

Confocal microscopy revealed the presence of the integrin alpha(v)beta(3) on melanoma membrane protrusions and pseudopods penetrating the endothelial junction. alpha(v)beta(3) was also enriched in heterotypic contacts between endothelial cells and melanoma cells. Transendothelial migration of melanoma cells was inhibited by either a cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp peptide or the anti-alpha(v)beta(3) monoclonal antibody LM609. Although both platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 and L1 are known to bind integrin alpha(v)beta(3), only L1 serves as a potential ligand for alpha(v)beta(3) during melanoma transendothelial migration. Also, polyclonal antibodies against L1 partially inhibited the transendothelial migration of melanoma cells. However, addition of both L1 and alpha(v)beta(3) antibodies did not show additive effects, suggesting that they are components of the same adhesion system.

        "Doc_abstract":"Metastatic melanoma is the most aggressive form of this cancer. It is important to understand factors that increase or decrease metastatic activity in order to more effectively research and implement treatments for melanoma. Increased cell invasion through the extracellular matrix is required for metastasis and is enhanced by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3 (TIMP3) inhibits MMP activity. It was previously shown by our group that miR-21, a potential regulator of TIMP3, is over-expressed in cutaneous melanoma. It was therefore hypothesized that increased levels of miR-21 expression would lead to decreased expression of TIMP3 and thereby enhance the invasiveness of melanoma cells. miR-21 over-expression in the melanoma cell lines WM1552c, WM793b, A375 and MEL 39 was accomplished via transfection with pre-miR-21. Immunoblot analysis of miR-21-overexpressing cell lines revealed reduced expression of TIMP3 as compared to controls. This in turn led to a significant increase in the invasiveness of the radial growth phase cell line WM1552c and the vertical growth phase cell line WM793b (p < 0.05), but not in the metastatic cell lines A375 or MEL 39. The proliferation and migration of miR-21 over-expressing cell lines was not affected. Reduced expression of TIMP3 was achieved by siRNA knockdown and significantly enhanced invasion of melanoma cell lines, mimicking the effects of miR-21 over-expression. Treatment of tumor cells with a linked nucleic acid antagomir to miR-21 inhibited tumor growth and increased tumor expression of TIMP3 in vivo in 01B74 Athymic NCr-nu/nu mice. Intra-tumoral injections of anti-miR-21 produced similar effects. This data shows that increased expression of miR-21 enhanced the invasive potential of melanoma cell lines through TIMP3 inhibition. Therefore, inhibition of miR-21 in melanoma may reduce melanoma invasiveness. ",

Mixed aggregation assays with MCAM-expressing and non-expressing cells revealed that MCAM can function as a heterophilic cell adhesion molecule interacting with a non-MCAM ligand. Although MCAM contains a potential glycosaminoglycan-binding site, cell-surface glycosaminoglycans do not appear to be involved in the heterophilic adhesion observed here since these molecules were not able to influence the adhesion. Using a functional adhesion assay, 4/4 melanoma cell lines examined were found to express an MCAM ligand. In contrast, no evidence for an MCAM ligand was found on the 2 carcinoma or 2 hematopoietic cell lines examined. Stable transfection of an MCAM ligand-negative colorectal cell line resulted in MCAM surface expression but not in homotypic adhesion, indicating that homophilic MCAM-MCAM adhesive interactions may not occur.

Recent studies have indicated that VM and tumorigenicity of human malignant melanoma may depend on the signaling pathways of an embryonic morphogen, Nodal. However, given the secretory nature of Nodal protein and melanoma cell heterogeneity, it remains unclear whether the Nodal-expressing cells participate directly or indirectly in VM that is potentially related to tumorigenic growth. We have developed a humanized murine xenograft model in which developing human melanomas may be sequentially studied during early stages of tumorigenic growth within a physiological human dermal microenvironment. Nodal protein localized diffusely to melanoma cell membranes, with occasional foci of accentuated reactivity in patterns suggestive of channel formation. Similar findings were detected in a limited number of patient-derived tumors. In situ hybridization confirmed Nodal mRNA to be restricted to tumor cells within xenografts that formed arborizing networks in patterns consistent with VM. These data indicate that Nodal gene expression is associated with formation of VM-like structures in a physiologically relevant model of human melanoma tumorigenesis, and further support a key role for Nodal expression in the formation of channel-like structures. The humanized xenograft model should be useful in future studies to define the mechanistic pathways responsible for VM and melanoma progression.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Metastatic melanoma is a poor prognosis skin cancer. Since conventional treatments including surgery and chemotherapy often fail, novel therapeutic strategies are needed. In particular, identification of melanoma associated antigen has fostered the progress of both active (vaccines) and adoptive immunotherapy. Some promising results have been obtained, but most melanoma patients are not yet cured possibly because of different immune-escape mechanisms operated by tumor cells. Several studies have addressed the use of interleukin (IL)-12 for melanoma therapy due to its immunoregulatory function and anti-tumor activity mediated by stimulation of T and NK effector cells. Unfortunately, IL-12 has shown considerable toxicity. We [1] have recently demonstrated that IL-12 exerts a direct anti-tumor activity on murine B16 melanoma cells expressing a functional IL-12 receptor (R). In our model low levels of endogenous IL-12 reduced proliferation, increased apoptosis, and defective microvessel formation of tumor cells. This review summarizes information about melanoma immunotherapy and highlights a novel mechanism of IL-12-mediated anti-tumor activity based upon the direct effect of the cytokine on IL-12R(+) tumor cells. In this view, new therapeutic approaches may be planned including: i) pre-screening of melanoma patients for IL-12Rbeta2 expression to identify potential responders, ii) administration of small and less frequent doses of IL-12 to avoid toxicity and iii) targeting of IL-12 to IL-12R(+) tumor cells, such as local administration in patients with skin tumors or injection of IL-12 fused to an antibody specific to tumor cells.",

We therefore evaluated the effects of resveratrol on melanoma cell lines co-cultured with vascular endothelial cells in monolayer and in three dimensional spheroids. We found that resveratrol stimulated isolated VEC proliferation, while it caused growth inhibition of VECs grown with melanoma cells in three-dimensional co-culture.

        "Doc_abstract":"As a point of convergence for numerous oncogenic signaling pathways, STAT3 is constitutively-activated at 50 to 90% frequency in diverse human cancers, including melanoma. A critical role of STAT3 in tumor cell survival, proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis and immune evasion has been recently demonstrated. STAT3 contributes to tumor cell growth by regulating the expression of genes that are involved in cell survival and proliferation. STAT3 promotes metastasis and angiogenesis by inducing expression of the metastatic gene, MMP-2, and the potent angiogenic gene, VEGF. STAT3 participates in the regulation of tumor immune evasion by inhibiting expression of proinflammatory mediators while promoting expression of immune-suppressing factors, which in turn activates STAT3 signaling in dendritic cells leading to immune tolerance. Thus, targeting STAT3 for therapy assaults cancer on multiple fronts. Many of the studies that defined STAT3's role in oncogenesis were carried out in melanoma cells and tumor models. In this review, we summarize the key role of STAT3 in cancer in general and melanoma in particular. With the emergence of small-molecule drugs that directly inhibit STAT3 or the oncogenic signaling pathways upstream of STAT3 in melanoma, a promising novel approach for melanoma therapy is emerging.",

We have stimulated the pulmonary innate immune system by macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2 (MALP-2), a specific agonist at Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2/6, and investigated its impact on experimental melanoma metastasis. In C57BL/6 mice, intratracheal application of MALP-2 induced a profound influx of neutrophils and macrophages into the lung, which peaked after 24 h (sixfold increase) and returned to baseline within 72 h. Further analysis revealed that MALP-2 also markedly induced VCAM-1 expression on pulmonary blood vessels. In vitro experiments demonstrated that this adhesion molecule mediates binding of B16F10 melanoma cells. Furthermore, in vivo or in vitro treatment with MALP-2 did not significantly affect the ability of immune cells to lyse melanoma cells. As a consequence, notwithstanding the profound pulmonary immune response induction and in contrast to conclusions drawn from some previous publications, the net extent of experimental metastasis did not change significantly, regardless of the application regimen of MALP-2 prior to, concomitant with or after tumor cell inoculation. Melanoma cells stably transfected with green fluorescent protein allowed tracking of early events after tumor cell dissemination and showed that MALP-2-mediated TLR2/6 activation did not interfere with pulmonary melanoma cell arrest. Likewise, boosting the immune induction after establishment of metastases did not change the clinical outcome. These unexpected results vividly counsel caution regarding predictions of immunomodulating therapies, as multiple intertwined effects may influence the net outcome.",

Observations that CICs have a distinct biology when compared to that of the bulk tumor cells and, importantly, are resistant to chemotherapies and radiation, suggest that CICs are involved in invasion, metastasis, and ultimately relapse. Lunasin, a bioactive peptide present in soybean, has both chemopreventive activity and chemotherapeutic activity against multiple cancer types. In this study, we tested the potential of Lunasin to specifically target CICs in melanoma tumor cell populations. In vitro studies using human melanoma cell lines showed that Lunasin treatment decreased the size of a subpopulation of melanoma cells expressing the surrogate CIC marker, Aldehyde Dehydrogenase, concomitant with a reduction in the ability to form colonies in soft agar assays, and reduced tumor growth in mouse xenografts. Similarly, Lunasin inhibited colony formation by isolated melanoma CICs in soft agar and reduced oncosphere formation in vitro and substantially inhibited tumor growth in mouse xenografts. Mechanistic studies revealed that Lunasin treatment of isolated melanoma CICs induced expression of the melanocyte-associated differentiation markers Tyrosinase and Microphthalmia-associated Transcription Factor concomitant with reduced expression of the stemness factor NANOG. These findings document for the first time that Lunasin has significant therapeutic activity against melanoma by specifically targeting melanoma CICs, and inducing a more differentiated, non-CIC phenotype. Thus, Lunasin may represent a novel therapeutic option for both chemoresistant and advanced metastatic melanoma management.",

These tumors induced numerous lymphatics at the invasive front, and compressed or destroyed VEGF receptor (R)-3-positive lymphatics were observed within the solid tumors. The lymphatics in the CAM and in the A375 melanomas could also be demonstrated with an antibody against Prox 1, a highly specific marker of lymphatic endothelial cells.

Such interactions were not observed with VEGF-C-negative Malme 3 M melanoma cells. Lymphangiogenesis was inhibited to some extent when A375 melanoma cells were transfected with cDNA encoding soluble VEGFR-3 (sflt4), and the BrdU labeling index of the lymphatics in these tumors was 3.9%.

In addition, MELOE-1 and -2 specific T cell clones recognized melanoma cells but very poorly normal melanocytes suggesting differential translation of meloe in normal vs tumor cells. This prompted us to elucidate the mechanisms of translation of these antigens in melanoma cells. We first demonstrated that no splicing event or cryptic promoter could generate shorter meloe transcripts containing only one of the two ORFs. Triggering meloe RNA degradation with a siRNA close to the ORF coding for MELOE-2 abrogated expression of both MELOE-1 and MELOE-2, thus confirming that the two ORFs are always associated. Next we showed, in a bicistronic reporter system, that IRES activities could be detected upstream of MELOE-1 and MELOE-2 and finally confirmed their translation from full length meloe cDNA in melanoma cells with eGFP constructs.

Analysis of patient-derived melanoma cell lines and tumor tissues, and interrogation of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data, revealed that DSG2 is frequently overexpressed in primary and metastatic melanomas compared to normal melanocytes. Notably, this overexpression was associated with poor clinical outcome. DSG2+ melanoma cells self-organized into tube-like structures on Matrigel, indicative of VM activity, which was inhibited by DSG2 knockdown or treatment with a DSG2-blocking peptide.

Seprase (also named fibroblast activation protein-α, antiplasmin-cleaving enzyme, and dipeptidyl prolyl peptidase 5) is expressed at high levels by stromal fibroblast, endothelial, and tumor cells in a variety of invasive tumors but is undetectable in the majority of normal adult tissues. To examine the transcriptional regulation of the gene, we cloned the human seprase promoter and demonstrated that endogenous seprase expression and exogenous seprase promoter activity are high in invasive melanoma cells but not in non-invasive melanoma cells/primary melanocytes. In addition, we identified a crucial TGF-β-responsive cis-regulatory element in the proximal seprase promoter region that enabled robust transcriptional activation of the gene. Treatment of metastatic but not normal/non-invasive cells with TGF-β1 caused a rapid and profound up-regulation of endogenous seprase mRNA, which coincided with an abolishment of the negative regulator c-Ski, and an increase in binding of Smad3/4 to the seprase promoter in vivo. Blocking TGF-β signaling in invasive melanoma cells through overexpression of c-Ski, chemically using SB-431542, or with a neutralizing antibody against TGF-β significantly reduced seprase mRNA levels. Strikingly, RNAi of seprase in invasive cells greatly diminished their invasive potential in vitro as did blocking TGF-β signaling using SB-431542.

However, its exact mechanism of action is unknown. I hypothesized that IFN-alpha exerts a direct effect on the melanoma cell via the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. Cell lysates from melanoma cell lines and patient tumor samples stimulated with IFN-alpha were incubated with radiolabeled oligonucleotides representing the high affinity sis-inducible element of c-fos and the IFN stimulated response element and then analyzed for STAT activation using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Melanoma cell lines showed no evidence for constitutive STAT activation in the absence of cytokine stimulation but exhibited rapid activation of STAT1 and STAT2 once treated with IFN-alpha. A distinct dose-response curve was noted with maximal STAT activation occurring at approximately 10(5) units/ml IFN-alpha. Genistein, a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, completely suppressed IFN-alpha-induced STAT activation. Malignant melanoma tumors obtained from 17 patients exhibited dose-dependent activation of STAT1 and STAT2 in response to treatment with IFN-alpha. Pretreatment of patient melanoma tumor cells with IFN-gamma resulted in a 4 log-fold decrease in the IFN-alpha concentration required for STAT activation and promoted the increased expression of STAT1, STAT2, and p48. In summary, IFN-alpha consistently activated STAT1 and STAT2 proteins in melanoma cell lines and in melanoma tumors obtained directly from patients. This signaling pathway was dramatically sensitized to IFN-alpha by pretreatment of melanoma cells with low concentrations of IFN-gamma. These results provide molecular evidence to support the hypothesis that the clinical response to IFN-alpha may be mediated, in part, by a direct effect on the melanoma cell.

The beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a cell surface receptor and the transmembrane precursor of the Abeta-peptide, which has an important role in Alzheimer's disease. The study presented here provides evidence that APP is expressed at high levels in advanced-stage melanomas, and that the cells cleave APP and secrete sAPP. We show that blocking the expression of APP by RNA interference impairs the proliferation of metastatic melanoma cells and leads to their terminal and irreversible differentiation. In addition, suppressing APP expression in a metastatic melanoma cell line renders the cells susceptible to several chemotherapeutic agents. Targeting APP may thus constitute a new approach to the treatment of this disease.",

In side-by-side experiments, we show that melanoma cells, either allogeneic or autologous, induced the growth of high avidity Melan-A-reactive CTLs from all donors, whereas essentially low avidity T cells were induced by peptide-pulsed PBLs. We also show that at least two cytokines, interleukin-6 and interleukin-2, were required to promote the growth of high avidity CTLs. Once sorted by tetramer labeling or cloning, the specificity and reactivity to tumor cells of peptide-specific T cells induced by allogeneic melanoma cells were confirmed. We then describe a relatively simple and efficient procedure that allowed us to obtain systematically high amounts (in the range of billion) of high avidity Melan-A/ MART-1-specific T cells from the PBLs of HLA-A2 melanoma patients and healthy donors in 3 months.

The anti-melanoma effect of EGCG has been previously suggested, but no clear mechanism of action has been established. In this study, we demonstrated that EGCG inhibits melanoma cell growth at physiological doses (0.1-1 μM). In the search for mechanisms of EGCG-mediated melanoma cell suppression, we found that NF-κB was inhibited, and that reduced NF-κB activity was associated with decreased IL-1β secretion from melanoma cells. Since inflammasomes are involved in IL-1β secretion, we investigated whether IL-1β suppression was mediated by inflammasomes, and found that EGCG treatment led to downregulation of the inflammasome component, NLRP1, and reduced caspase-1 activation. Furthermore, silencing the expression of NLRP1 abolished EGCG-induced inhibition of tumor cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a key role of inflammasomes in EGCG efficacy. This paper provides a novel mechanism for EGCG-induced melanoma inhibition: inflammasome downregulation→decreased IL-1β secretion→decreased NF-κB activities→decreased cell growth. In addition, it suggests inflammasomes and IL-1β could be potential targets for future melanoma therapeutics.",

In the current study, we have utilized the Bowes melanoma line for evaluating MT1-MMP in invasion and growth. Our studies extend the earlier observations to demonstrate that MT1-MMP expression in Bowes melanoma cells promotes selective invasion into matrigel but not matrices consisting of type-I collagen. Furthermore, MT1-MMP expressing melanoma cells exhibit increased migration in response to laminin 1 but not to type-I or type-IV collagen. MT1-MMP expression results in enhanced 3 dimensional growth in agarose gels and in long-term cultures within matrigel. The hydroxymate inhibitor BB94 inhibits MT1-MMP enhanced invasion and growth in 3 dimensional culture systems, but had no effect on increased motility.

The combination of recombinant human fibroblast interferon and the antileukemic agent mezerein corrects these abnormalities in cultured human melanoma cells resulting in irreversible growth arrest and terminal differentiation. Subtraction hybridization identifies a melanoma differentiation associated gene (mda-7) with elevated expression in growth arrested and terminally differentiated human melanoma cells. Colony formation decreases when mda-7 is transfected into human tumor cells of diverse origin and with multiple genetic defects. In contrast, the effects of mda-7 on growth and colony formation in transient transfection assays with normal cells, including human mammary epithelial, human skin fibroblast, and rat embryo fibroblast, is quantitatively less than that found with cancer cells. Tumor cells expressing elevated mda-7 display suppression in monolayer growth and anchorage independence. Infection with a recombinant type 5 adenovirus expressing antisense mda-7 eliminates mda-7 suppression of the in vitro growth and transformed phenotype. The ability of mda-7 to suppress growth in cancer cells not expressing or containing defects in both the retinoblastoma (RB) and p53 genes indicates a lack of involvement of these critical tumor suppressor elements in mediating mda-7-induced growth inhibition. The lack of protein homology of mda-7 with previously described growth suppressing genes and the differential effect of this gene on normal versus cancer cells suggests that mda-7 may represent a new class of cancer growth suppressing genes with antitumor activity.",

Malignant melanocytes are capable of influencing tumor-associated antigen expression. As of now, several varieties of melanoma-associated antigens (MAA) have been identified: MART1/melan A, tyrosinase, MITF, gp100, members of MAGE family, S100, CD63 and CD146. Peptides isolated from such molecules can induce MHC-restricted response of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. It has been shown that level and nature of specific antigen expression caused by melanocytes correlate with tumor stage and a relationship between survival and MAA expression on tumor cells identified. Morphological features, growth pattern and proliferation rate varied in melanoma cell cultures used in our study. Our experiments involved evaluation of changes in the properties of antigens HLA (class 1 and 2), tumor tissue samples and cells isolated from them, which were capable of stable proliferative activity during passages 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35, and assay for MAA content. Levels of the antigens were significantly lower following long-term culturing melanoma cell melanoma cells in vitro. At initial passages (1-5), antigen profile in most cultures was similar to that in tumor tissue samples. Later on each cell population showed greater antigen expression heterogeneity matched by increased number of cells going through mitotic cycle; their nuclei were stained with antibodies to Ki-67. No HLF A/B/C molecule expression took place during tumor cell culturing: stained cells--in 68.9% of cultures (passages 1-5) and 36.3% (passage 35). However, HLA DQ/DP/DR molecule identification showed an inverse relationship: 44.1% (passage 5) while virtually all the cell lines did synthesize those molecules after passage 35. Hence, MAA and MHC (class 1 and 2) antigens expression in tumor cell should be monitored when they are used for preparation of autologuos and allogenic vaccines. In case of allogenic vaccine production, cell lines capable of stable production of MAA should be selected.",

Cell surface HA expression was assessed with the HA-binding peptide Pep-1. B16-F1 melanoma cells showed significantly higher levels of Pep-1 binding compared with B16-F10 cells in vitro. On the other hand, expression levels of HA were comparable between B16-F1 and B16-F10 melanoma cells in cryostat sections. These results show that B16-F1 cells express high levels of HA in vitro and in vivo, while B16-F10 cells express high concentrations of HA only in the context of skin tumors. Finally, B16-F10 melanoma cells, but not B16-F1 cells, expressed high concentrations of HA after stimulation with lactate.

Successful invasion into the brain by tumor cells must include attachment to microvessel endothelial cells, penetration through the blood-brain barrier, and, of relevance, a response to brain survival and growth factors. Neurotrophins (NTs) are important in brain-invasive steps. Human melanoma cell lines express low-affinity NT receptor p75NTR in relation to their brain-metastatic propensity with their invasive properties being regulated by NGF, or nerve growth factor, the prototypic NT. They also express functional TrkC, the putative receptor for the invasion-promoting NT-3. In brain-metastatic melanoma cells, NTs promote invasion by enhancing the production of extracellular matrix (ECM)-degradative enzymes such as heparanase, an enzyme capable of locally destroying both ECM and the basement membrane of the blood-brain barrier. Heparanase is an endo-beta-d-glucuronidase that cleaves heparan sulfate (HS) chains of ECM HS proteoglycans, and it is a unique metastatic determinant because it is the dominant mammalian HS degradative enzyme. Brain-metastatic melanoma cells also produce autocrine/paracrine factors that influence their growth, invasion, and survival in the brain. Synthesis of these factors may serve to regulate NT production by brain cells adjacent to the neoplastic invasion front, such as astrocytes. Increased NT levels have been observed in tumor-adjacent tissues at the invasion front of human brain melanoma. Additionally, astrocytes may contribute to the brain-metastatic specificity of melanoma cells by producing NT-regulated heparanase. Trophic, autocrine, and paracrine growth factors may therefore determine whether metastatic cells can successfully invade, colonize, and grow in the CNS.",

Defining genes that control metastasis in vivo may provide new targets for intervening in this process with profound therapeutic implications. Melanoma differentiation associated gene-9 (mda-9) was initially identified by subtraction hybridization as a novel gene displaying biphasic expression during terminal differentiation in human melanoma cells. Mda-9, also known as syntenin, is a PDZ-domain protein overexpressed in many types of human cancers, where it is believed to function in tumor progression. However, a functional role of mda-9/syntenin in tumor growth and metastasis and the signaling pathways involved in mediating these biological activities remain to be defined. Evidence is now provided, using weakly and highly metastatic isogenic melanoma variants, that mda-9/syntenin regulates metastasis. Expression of mda-9/syntenin correlates with advanced stages of melanoma progression. Regulating mda-9/syntenin expression using a replication-incompetent adenovirus expressing either sense or antisense mda-9/syntenin modifies the transformed phenotype and alters metastatic ability in immortal human melanocytes and metastatic melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo in newborn rats. A direct relationship is observed between mda-9/syntenin expression and increased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, c-Jun-NH2-kinase, and p38. This study provides the first direct link between mda-9/syntenin expression and tumor cell dissemination in vivo and indicates that mda-9/syntenin expression activates specific signal transduction pathways, which may regulate melanoma tumor progression. Based on its ability to directly alter metastasis, mda-9/syntenin provides a promising new focus for melanoma cancer research with potential therapeutic applications for metastatic diseases.",

In the present study, we examined whether macrophage- melanoma cell interaction regulates vascular endothelial cell growth factor-A (VEGF-A) expression in macrophages. We analyzed the expression of mediators of monocyte recruitment and differentiation, such as monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) in malignant melanoma specimens and tumor cells with different metastatic potential. Our data demonstrate that MCP-1 and M-CSF are differentially expressed in human malignant melanomas from different thickness and depth of invasion and cell lines. Next, we examined the effect of MCP-1 and M-CSF on modulation of VEGFA expression in monocytes/macrophages. Treatment of human monocytes with M-CSF and MCP-1 enhanced VEGF-A expression by increased hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) expression and enhanced activation of the hypoxia response element (HRE). Further activation of monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) caused an increase in VEGF-A expression. We demonstrate that coculture of melanoma cells with monocytes enhanced VEGF-A secretion, and conditioned medium from MDMs enhanced melanoma cell expression of VEGF-A. Furthermore, conditioned medium from melanoma cells enhanced VEGF-A expression in human monocytes, which was abrogated by anti-M-CSF neutralizing antibody. In summary, we demonstrate that MCP-1 and M-CSF, critical for monocyte recruitment, activation, and differentiation, differentially regulate VEGF-A expression and may play an important role in monocyte/macrophage- mediated tumor angiogenesis.",

However, for in vivo studies, the duration of marker gene expression has been highly variable. We have developed a series of LVs harboring different promoters for expressing reporter gene in mouse cells. Long-term culture and colony formation of several LV-labeled mouse melanoma cells showed that promoters derived from mammalian house-keeping genes, especially those encoding RNA polymerase II (Pol2) and ferritin (FerH), provided the highest consistency for reporter expression. For in vivo studies, primary B16BL6 mouse melanoma were infected with LVs whose luciferase-green fluorescence protein fusion gene (Luc/GFP) was driven by either Pol2 or FerH promoters. When transplanted into syngeneic C57BL/6 mice, Luc/GFP-labeled B16BL6 mouse melanoma cells can be monitored by bioluminescence imaging in vivo, and GFP-positive cells can be isolated from the tumors by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Pol2-Luc/GFP labeling, while lower in activity, was more sustainable than FerH-Luc/GFP labeling in B16BL6 over consecutive passages into mice.

They have been used in different clinical settings to vaccinate cancer patients. We have previously used gamma-irradiated MART-1 expressing melanoma cells as a source of antigens to vaccinate melanoma patients by injecting irradiated cells with BCG and GM-CSF or to load immature DC and use them as a vaccine. Other clinical trials have used IFN-gamma activated macrophage killer cells (MAK) to treat cancer patients. However, the clinical use of MAK has been based on their direct tumoricidal activity rather than on their ability to act as antigen-presenting cells to stimulate an adaptive antitumor response. Thus, in the present work, we compared the fate of MART-1 after phagocytosis of gamma-irradiated cells by clinical grade DC or MAK as well as the ability of these cells to cross present MART-1 to CD8(+) T cells. Using a high affinity antibody against MART-1, 2A9, which specifically stains melanoma tumors, melanoma cell lines and normal melanocytes, the expression level of MART-1 in melanoma cell lines could be related to their ability to stimulate IFN-gamma production by a MART-1 specific HLA-A*0201-restricted CD8(+) T cell clone. Confocal microscopy with Alexa Fluor®(647)-labelled 2A9 also showed that MART-1 could be detected in tumor cells attached and/or fused to phagocytes and even inside these cells as early as 1 h and up to 24 h or 48 h after initiation of co-cultures between gamma-irradiated melanoma cells and MAK or DC, respectively. Interestingly, MART-1 was cross-presented to MART-1 specific T cells by both MAK and DC co-cultured with melanoma gamma-irradiated cells for different time-points. Thus, naturally occurring MART-1 melanoma antigen can be taken-up from dying melanoma cells into DC or MAK and both cell types can induce specific CD8(+) T cell cross-presentation thereafter.",

In addition, human melanoma cells were transduced in vivo by the direct injection of the IL-2/retroviral vector into melanoma xenografts in nude mice. The gene-modified melanoma cells expressed the IL-2 cytokine gene and secreted biologically active IL-2. Transduction of melanoma cells with the IL-2 gene did not affect the antigenic profile of the cells, but caused a strong abrogation of their tumorigenicity. One million parental cells formed subcutaneous tumors in nude mice. In contrast, various doses of up to 20 x 10(6) IL-2-transduced cells failed to form tumor in the mice. Coinjection of IL-2-producing cells with parental cells inhibited tumor formation even when highly tumorigenic doses of parental cells were used. Histochemical analysis of the injection sites of IL-2-modified cells showed an influx of host immune cells, predominantly macrophages, as early as the third day after inoculation. Neutrophils, mast cells, and eosinophils were also seen in the inflammatory exudate. Eventually, transduced cells showed signs of degeneration and necrosis and ultimately died in 4 weeks. Macrophages were seen in parental tumor sites only during the first few days after injection, and then parental tumors exhibited fast, progressive growth. The study suggests that melanoma cells transduced with the IL-2 cytokine gene may provide an effective vaccine for melanoma patients, whereas the in vivo transduction of tumors with cytokine genes is feasible and may represent a novel approach for the immunotherapy of cancer patients.",

However, a variety of clinical studies indicate that inhibiting the MAPK pathway is insufficient per se to effectively kill melanoma cells. Here, we report on a genetic and pharmacologic approach to identify survival factors responsible for the resistance of melanoma cells to MEK/ERK antagonists. In addition, we describe a new tumor cell-selective means to bypass this resistance in vitro and in vivo. By generating a panel of isogenic cell lines with specific defects in the apoptotic machinery, we found that the ability of melanoma cells to survive in the absence of functional MEK relies on an ERK-independent expression of the antiapoptotic factor Mcl-1 (and to a lesser extent, Bcl-x(L) and Bcl-2). Using computer-based modeling, we developed a novel Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3) mimetic. This compound, named TW-37, is the first rationally designed small molecule with high affinity for Mcl-1, Bcl-x(L), and Bcl-2. Mechanistic analyses of the mode of action of TW-37 showed a synergistic tumor cell killing in the presence of MEK inhibitors. Importantly, TW-37 unveiled an unexpected role of the MAPK pathway in the control of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This function was critical to prevent the activation of proapoptotic functions of p53 in melanoma cells, but surprisingly, it was dispensable for normal melanocytes. Our results suggest that this MAPK-dependent ROS/p53 feedback loop is a point of vulnerability of melanoma cells that can be exploited for rational drug design.",

Here, we highlight advances in our understanding of tumor cell behaviors and plasticity, focusing on the relationship between melanoma and the NC invasion programs. We summarize recent discoveries of NC cell guidance and emerging in vivo imaging strategies that permit single cell resolution of fluorescently labeled tumor cells, with a focus on our recently developed in vivo chick embryo transplant model. Crucial to the molecular pathogenesis of metastasis, we highlight advances in gene profiling of small cell numbers, including our novel ability to gather gene expression information during distinct stages of melanoma invasion. Lastly, we present preliminary details of a comparison of specific genetic pathways associated with the early phases of melanoma invasion and known NC induction and migration signals. Our results suggest that malignant melanoma cells hijack portions of the NC program to promote plasticity and facilitate metastasis. In summary, there is considerable power in combining an in vivo model system with molecular analysis of gene expression, within the context of established developmental signaling pathways, to identify and study the molecular mechanisms of metastasis.

Erlotinib, a small-molecule epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been widely studied for the treatment of human lung cancer and other solid tumors, but the erlotinib-targeted therapy has not been tested in melanoma. The objective of this study is to investigate the potency of erlotinib in suppressing the growth of human melanoma cells and whether IL-24 could enhance the antitumor activity of erlotinib. In cell viability and apoptosis assays, treatment with erlotinib dependently inhibited the growth of different melanoma cell lines and when combined with adenoviral vector-mediated IL-24 gene therapy, a significant increase in cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induction resulted (P<0.05). Immunoblot assay showed that the combination treatment of erlotinib and IL-24 considerably increased the cleavage of caspase-3 and caspase-9 and the expression of Apaf-1 protein in melanoma cells, inducing activation of the Apaf-1-dependent apoptotic pathways. Moreover, this combination treatment markedly inhibited phosphorylation of the EGFR, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, and Akt proteins, inactivating the Akt-dependent cell survival signaling pathway. These results show that a combination of IL-24-mediated molecular therapy and EGFR inhibitors such as erlotinib may be a promising treatment strategy for human melanoma and will serve as a basis for guiding the combination treatment designs in future preclinical and clinical trials.

Human melanoma progresses through different steps: nevocellular nevi, dysplastic nevi, in situ melanoma, radial growth phase melanoma (Breslow index < or = 0.75 mm), vertical growth phase melanoma (Breslow index > 0.75 mm), and metastatic melanoma. In agreement with progression, it acquires a rich vascular network, whereas an increasing proportion of tumor cells express the laminin receptor, which enables their adhesion to the vascular wall. Hence, both phenomena favour tumour cell extravasation and metastases. Melanocytic cells produce and release Fibroblast Growth Factor-2 (FGF-2), mainly in the steps of dysplastic nevus and melanoma in vertical growth phase.

Evidence is emerging that epigenetic changes might play a significant role in tumor cell plasticity and metastatic phenotype of melanoma cells.;In this study, we developed a systematic approach to identify genes implicated in melanoma progression. To do this, we used the Affymetrix GeneChip Arrays to screen 34,000 mouse transcripts in melan-a melanocytes, 4C pre-malignant melanocytes, 4C11- non-metastatic and 4C11+ metastatic melanoma cell lines. The genome-wide association studies revealed pathways commonly over-represented in the transition from immortalized to pre-malignant stage, and under-represented in the transition from non-metastatic to metastatic stage. Additionally, the treatment of cells with 10 µM 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5AzaCdR) for 48 hours allowed us to identify genes differentially re-expressed at specific stages of melan-a malignant transformation. Treatment of human primary melanocytes with the demethylating agent 5AzaCdR in combination to the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) revealed changes on melanocyte morphology and gene expression which could be an indicator of epigenetic flexibility in normal melanocytes. Moreover, changes on gene expression recognized by affecting the melanocyte biology (NDRG2 and VDR), phenotype of metastatic melanoma cells (HSPB1 and SERPINE1) and response to cancer therapy (CTCF, NSD1 and SRC) were found when Mel-2 and/or Mel-3-derived patient metastases were exposed to 5AzaCdR plus TSA treatment. Hierarchical clustering and network analyses in a panel of five patient-derived metastatic melanoma cells showed gene interactions that have never been described in melanomas.;Despite the heterogeneity observed in melanomas, this study demonstrates the utility of our murine melanoma progression model to identify molecular markers commonly perturbed in metastasis.

Besides promising approaches based on T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells have gained more and more attention as anti-melanoma effector cells. NK cell activation is inhibited by HLA class I molecules expressed by target cells, so they preferentially attack tumor cells that express low levels of HLA class I. Partial or complete loss of HLA class I expression is a frequent event during the development of melanoma. In parallel, ligands for activating NK cell receptors become induced upon malignant transformation. Thus, melanoma cells are often efficiently recognized and lysed by NK cells at least in vitro. In vivo, however, melanomas have developed multiple sophisticated strategies to escape from NK cell mediated attack. Several novel approaches aim at harnessing NK cells to treat melanoma patients and to counteract existing tumor escape mechanisms. This review summarizes the most recent advances in the field. ",

Previous studies have shown that expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and integrin alphavbeta3 correlate with melanoma progression. Recently, direct binding of matrix metalloproteinase-2 to alpha(v)beta3 was implicated in presenting activated matrix metalloproteinase-2 on the cell surface of invasive cells. In this study we investigated this, using the highly metastatic, alpha(v)beta3-negative melanoma cell lines MV3 and BLM, their beta3-transfected alpha(v)beta3 expressing counterparts, xenografts derived from these cell lines, and fresh human cutaneous melanoma lesions comprising all stages of melanoma progression. Expression and activation status of matrix metalloproteinase-2 were studied by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and zymographic analysis, respectively. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 protein expression in vitro was similar in both alpha(v)beta3-negative and alpha(v)beta3-positive cell lines Remarkable differences, however, exist in the localization of inactive and active matrix metalloproteinase-2. Soluble active matrix metalloproteinase-2 was detectable only in the conditioned medium of alpha(v)beta3-negative cell lines and undetectable in the alpha(v)beta3-positive cell lines. Conversely, active matrix metalloproteinase-2 was present exclusively on the cell surface of the alpha(v)beta3 expressing transfectants. Western blot analysis of other components that are involved in matrix metalloproteinase-2 activation showed that processing of proMT1-matrix metalloproteinase to the activated form was enhanced in beta3 transfectants, whereas secretion of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 was decreased. In vivo, the presence of functionally active matrix metalloproteinase-2 was significantly higher in xenografts derived from the alpha(v)beta3 expressing MV3 and BLM cell lines. In human cutaneous melanoma lesions, neither matrix metalloproteinase-2 nor integrin alpha(v)beta3 is detectable in melanoma in situ as determined by immunohistochemistry. In contrast, the number of matrix metalloproteinase-2-positive and alphavbeta3-positive tumor cells was clearly increased in primary melanomas, and melanoma metastases. Double staining experiments and confocal laser microscopy demonstrated that the percentage of cells coexpressing matrix metalloproteinase-2 and alpha(v)beta3 increased in advanced primary melanomas and melanoma metastases. In addition, zymography showed that functionally active matrix metalloproteinase-2 was frequently present in melanoma metastases. In these lesions a high proportion of matrix metalloproteinase-2- and alphavbeta3-double-positive melanoma cells were detectable. Our study demonstrates that the presence of activated matrix metalloproteinase-2 correlates with expression of alpha(v)beta3 in human melanoma cells both in vitro and in vivo, and also in fresh human melanoma lesions. These findings strongly suggest that co-ordinated expression of both factors may be required for melanoma cell invasion and metastasis formation.",

Here, we report that CD133(+) and ABCB5(+) subpopulations are colocalized in melanomas in perivascular niches that contain CD144 (VE-cadherin)(+) melanoma cells forming vessel-like channels, a phenomenon termed vasculogenic mimicry (VM). RNAi-mediated attenuation of CD133 established its critical function in morphogenesis of these perivascular niches as well as in melanoma tumorigenicity. Niche-associated genes CD144 and ABCB5 were downregulated in tumors derived from CD133 knockdown (KD) melanoma cells compared with controls. CD133KD cells also lacked the ability to form CD144(+) VM-like channels in a manner that was associated with a depletion of the ABCB5(+) cell subpopulation. Finally, CD133 KD cells exhibited poorer tumor growth in vivo. Taken together, our findings corroborate models in which CD133(+)/ABCB5(+) melanoma cells reside in a complex anastomosing microvascular niche that encompasses CD144(+) VM channels as well as authentic endothelial cell-lined blood vessels. Further, they indicate that CD133(+) cells act as stem-like cells, which drive tumor growth by promoting VM and the morphogenesis of a specialized perivascular niche in melanoma.",

High levels of all alternatively spliced HLA-G transcripts could be detected in melanoma cells by RT-PCR. Analysis of biopsies from a melanoma patient revealed a higher HLA-G transcription level in skin metastasis as compared to healthy skin, while specific amplification of the HLA-G5 transcript was only observable in the tumor. HLA-G protein expression could also be detected in two melanoma cell lines. HLA-G-positive tumors inhibit cytotoxic lysis by the NK cell line YT2C2-PR. This inhibition is not observed with B-EBV cell lines bearing matched class I specificities, and is thought to occur through interaction of HLA-G with inhibitory receptors that are distinct from known KIRs interacting with HLA-E or classical class I molecules.

Graded doses of swainsonine were administered either orally or via implanted Alzet miniosmotic pumps to athymic nude mice bearing subcutaneously implanted human MeWo melanoma cells. Swainsonine at 10 micrograms/ml in the drinking water or 0.5 mg/kg/day administered by miniosmotic pump reduced the growth rate of the MeWo tumors by approximately 50% and inhibited the expression of complex-type oligosaccharides in tumors and host intestine by only 10-20%. Swainsonine doses of 4 mg/kg/day reduced expression of complex-type oligosaccharides by 85% in vivo but afforded no additional inhibitory effect. A glycosylation mutant of MeWo called 3S5 has a defect in the synthesis of complex-type asparagine-linked oligosaccharides resulting in incomplete processing similar to that observed in swainsonine-treated MeWo tumor cells. Swainsonine did not inhibit the proliferation of 3S5 cells in vitro nor the growth of 3S5 tumors in nude mice.

To further demonstrate the importance of bcl-2 and validate the related antiapoptotic protein bcl-xL as targets for antisense therapy in melanoma, their implication as survival factors in melanoma cells of different clinical stages as well as in normal melanocytes was investigated. Primary cell cultures derived from 17 melanomas, the cell line A375, and normal melanocytes from healthy donors were treated with antisense oligonucleotides targeting either the bcl-xL mRNA or the bcl-2 and the bcl-xL mRNAs simultaneously. Bcl-2 and bcl-xL expression in cells was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Cell viability was assessed in 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide and apoptosis assays. Bcl-2 expression was low in melanoma cells of stages I, II, and III, hardly detectable in A375 cells, but high in normal melanocytes. Bcl-xL expression was high in all cell types tested. As shown in A375 cells and the stage III melanoma cells 0513, both the bcl-xL monospecific oligonucleotide 4259 and the bcl-2/bcl-xL bispecific oligonucleotide 4625 effectively reduced tumor cell viability by induction of apoptosis with IC50 values ranging from 200 to 350 nM.

In this study, we have characterized the molecular defects underlying HLA class I Ag loss in five melanoma cell lines derived from recurrent metastases following initial clinical responses to T cell-based immunotherapy. Point mutations in the translation initiation codon (ATG-->ATA) and in codon 31 (TCA-->TGA) of the beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m) gene were identified in the melanoma cell lines 1074MEL and 1174MEL, respectively. A hot-spot CT dinucleotide deletion within codon 13-15 was found in the melanoma cell lines 1106MEL, 1180MEL, and 1259MEL. Reconstitution of beta(2)m expression restored HLA class I Ag expression in the five melanoma cell lines; however, the HLA-A and HLA-B,-C gene products were differentially expressed by 1074MEL, 1106MEL, and 1259MEL cells. In addition, in 1259MEL cells, the Ag-processing machinery components calnexin, calreticulin, and low m.w. polypeptide 10 are down-regulated, and HLA-A2 Ags are selectively lost because of a single cytosine deletion in the HLA-A2 gene exon 4. Our results in conjunction with those in the literature suggest the emergence of a preferential beta(2)m gene mutation in melanoma cells following strong T cell-mediated immune selection. Furthermore, the presence of multiple HLA class I Ag defects within a tumor cell population may reflect the accumulation of multiple escape mechanisms developed by melanoma cells to avoid distinct sequential T cell-mediated selective events.",

A relatively high level of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) was found on C8161 cells. In contrast, levels of beta(2)-integrins (e.g., LFA-1 and Mac-1), the molecules that would be necessary for C8161 stable adhesion to the endothelium substrate, were found to be very low on these melanoma cells. As a result, C8161 transendothelial migration under a flow condition of 4 dyn/cm(2) decreased by 70% as compared to static migration. When human neutrophils (PMNs) were present in the tumor cell suspension, C8161 migration recovered by 85% over C8161 cells alone under the 4 dyn/cm(2) flow condition. Blocking ICAM-1 on C8161 cells or Mac-1 on PMNs significantly inhibited C8161-PMN adhesion and subsequent C8161 migration through the endothelium under flow conditions. In addition, increased interleukin-8 production and Mac-1 expression by PMNs were detected when they were co-cultured with C8161 melanoma cells.

We previously reported that the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) in melanoma tumor cells is strongly correlated with poor patient survival. Therefore, we hypothesized that nitric oxide (NO) produced by iNOS promotes the melanoma inflammatory tumor microenvironment associated with poor outcome. To understand the role of NO and iNOS in the melanoma inflammatory tumor microenvironment, polymerase chain reaction arrays of inflammatory and autoimmunity genes were performed on a series of stage III melanoma lymph node metastasis samples to compare the gene expression profiles of iNOS-expressing and nonexpressing tumor samples. The results indicate that expression of CXC chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) was inversely correlated with iNOS expression, and the high CXCL10-expressing cases had more favorable prognoses than the low CXCL10-expressing cases. Functional studies revealed that treating iNOS-negative/CXCL10-positive melanoma cell lines with a NO donor suppressed the expression of CXCL10. Furthermore, scavenging NO from iNOS-expressing cell lines significantly affected the chemokine expression profile. Culture supernatants from NO scavenger-treated melanoma cells promoted the migration of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which was diminished when the cells were treated with a CXCL10-neutralizing antibody. CXCL10 has been reported to be an antitumorigenic chemokine. Our study suggests that the production of NO by iNOS inhibits the expression of CXCL10 in melanoma cells and leads to a protumorigenic tumor microenvironment. Inhibiting NO induces an antitumorigenic environment, and thus, iNOS should be considered to be an important therapeutic target in melanoma.",

In-vitro effects of two lipophilic statins, simvastatin and lovastatin, and a hydrophilic statin, pravastatin, were investigated with respect to B16.F10 murine melanoma cell proliferation and viability. Our results show that only lipophilic statins exerted strong cytotoxic effects on B16.F10 melanoma cells. To gain further evidence on the pleiotropic effects of statins responsible for their cytotoxicity in B16.F10 cells, we have assessed their proapoptotic effects by Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide staining and measured tumor cell production of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1α by western blot analysis, nonenzymatic antioxidant levels by an antioxidant colorimetric assay, and superoxide dismutase activity through an indirect method on the basis of inhibition of xanthine oxidase activity. Protein array was also used to assess angiogenic/inflammatory protein production in B16.F10 cells. Our results pointed out that the cytotoxic actions exerted by lipophilic statins were mainly based on the suppressive actions of these drugs on hypoxia-inducible factor 1α expression and nonenzymatic antioxidant levels, as well as because of the inhibition of superoxide dismutase activity in B16.F10 melanoma cells.

We report that the loss of one major histocompatibility complex haplotype in human melanoma cells not only allowed them to evade immunosurveillance but also increased their intrinsic oncogenic potential. A second successive defect in MHC-I expression, MHC-I total downregulation, gave rise to melanoma cells that were more oncogenic per se in vivo and showed a higher proliferation rate and greater migratory and invasive potential in vitro. All these processes were reversed by restoring MHC-I expression via human leukocite antigen-A2 gene transfection. MHC-I cell surface expression was inversely correlated with intrinsic oncogenic potential. Modifications in the expression of various cell cycle genes were correlated with changes in MHC-I expression; the most important differences among the melanoma cell lines were in the transcriptional level of AP2-alpha, cyclin A1 and p21WAF1/CIP1. According to these results, altered MHC-I expression in malignant cells can directly increase their intrinsic oncogenic and invasive potential and modulate the expression of cell cycle genes. These findings suggest that human leukocite antigen class I molecules may act directly as tumor suppressor genes in melanoma.",

AS101 (ammonium trichloro(dioxoethylene-0,0')tellurate), a synthetic immunomodulator with minimal toxicity, was found to have antitumor effects in various tumor models. Our present study shows that AS101 has direct and indirect effects on tumor cells; AS101 inhibits the clonogenicity of B16 melanoma cells in vitro. Moreover, wild-type P53 expression, which is required for induction of Apo-1 expression, increased significantly in AS101-treated cells. We therefore investigated Fas expression in AS101-treated B16 cells and found that Fas, but not FasL, expression was significantly increased; moreover, Fas receptors were functional. Longer incubation with AS101 resulted in spontaneous apoptosis triggered by the Fas-FasL system. To explore the relationship of these results to the antitumor effects of AS101, we injected B16-F10 mouse melanoma cells into syngeneic C57BL/6 mice carrying the lpr mutation in the Fas gene and to gld mutant mice that lack functional FasL. Tumor development in control groups was lowest in the lpr mice, while no difference was observed between gld and wild-type mice. Among the AS101-treated groups, the most pronounced effect appeared in the lpr mice, while the lowest was seen in the gld mutant mice. Our study suggests that AS101 may render melanoma tumor cells more sensitive to Fas/FasL-induced apoptosis and may therefore have clinical potential.",

Using a phage display technique, we recently developed a synthetic peptide (GAHWQFNALTVR; Pep-1) that binds to and inhibits the function of HA. In this study, we have used Pep-1 to determine whether HA directly regulates the behavior of tumor cells. B16-F10 melanoma cells, which constitutively expressed CD44, showed significant adhesion to HA-coated plates, and this adhesion was blocked almost completely either by neutralizing antibodies against CD44 or by Pep-1. These results imply that CD44 is the primary HA receptor mediating the adhesive interaction of the melanoma cells with HA substrates. In contrast, Pep-1 failed to inhibit in vitro proliferation of B16-F10 melanoma cells or the in vitro growth of the cells after s.c. inoculation in mice. Importantly, single injection of Pep-1 significantly reduced the incidence of lung metastasis of i.v. inoculated melanoma cells and prolonged the survival of the tumor-bearing animals. These results suggest a direct contribution of HA to one or more steps in the initial seeding of melanoma cells in the lung microenvironment. Our observations also introduce a new concept that synthetic inhibitors of HA may represent unique tools for studying the roles of HA in tumor biology and perhaps a new class of therapeutic reagents.",

One of the known mechanisms underlying the loss of 5hmC is the decrease in expression of ten-eleven translocation family dioxygenase (TET) genes, which encode enzymes that catalyze the generation of 5hmC. Overexpressing TET2 was shown to partially reestablish a normal 5hmC profile in melanoma and decrease invasiveness in rodents. However, the feasibility to overexpress TETs in patients remains unclear. We and others have recently demonstrated that TETs require vitamin C as a cofactor to generate 5hmC. This finding prompted us to test whether vitamin C, as an alternative to overexpressing TETs, could rebuild 5hmC content in melanoma.;Consistent with previous reports, we found that the expression of TETs was decreased in various melanoma cell lines. In contrast, the expressions of sodium-dependent vitamin C transporters (SVCTs) were down-regulated in cell lines derived from melanoma metastases. Treatment of vitamin C at the physiological level (0.1 mM) promoted the content of 5hmC in melanoma cell lines derived from different stages toward the level of healthy melanocytes, which was comparable to the effect of overexpressing TET2. Vitamin C treatment decreased the malignancy of metastatic A2058 cells by inhibiting migration and anchorage-independent growth, while not exerting any effect on the rate of proliferation. Further, vitamin C treatment caused alterations in genome-wide transcriptions shown by RNA-seq, predominantly in ArhGAP30 and genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, which could underlie the decreased malignant phenotypes.;Our data support the idea that vitamin C treatment increases 5hmC content in melanoma cells, while causing a decrease in tumor-cell invasiveness and clonogenic growth in soft agar. Thus, vitamin C could be a potential epigenetic treatment for melanoma.",

As certain chemokines are found in abundance in organs that are common targets of metastasis and receptors for these chemokines are expressed by tumor cells, it was hypothesized that chemokine gradients might selectively facilitate metastasis to these organs. A later finding that these chemokines were produced by tumor cells, with evidence of autocrine effects, obliged the modification of that hypothesis. Many chemokines are also known to have opposing effects according to the type of cell they are acting on (tumor, inflammatory/immune, or endothelial cells), their functional status, or interactions with other molecules.

However, MCSP is not strictly tumor specific, because it is also expressed in a variety of normal tissues. Therefore, self tolerance should prevent the induction of strong T cell responses against these Ags by vaccination strategies. In contrast, breaking self tolerance to this Ag by effectively manipulating the immune system might mediate antitumor responses, although it would bear the risk of autoimmunity. Surprisingly, we could readily isolate CD4(+) Th cells from the blood of a healthy donor-recognizing peptide MCSP(693-709) on HLA-DR11-expressing melanoma cells. Broad T cell reactivity against this Ag could be detected in the peripheral blood of both healthy donors and melanoma patients, without any apparent signs of autoimmune disease. In some patients, a decline of T cell reactivity was observed upon tumor progression.

The effect of resveratrol on melanoma cell activation by IL-18 was also studied.;Resveratrol remarkably inhibited hepatic retention and metastatic growth of melanoma cells by 50% and 75%, respectively. The mechanism involved IL-18 blockade at three levels: First, resveratrol prevented IL-18 augmentation in the blood of melanoma cell-infiltrated livers. Second, resveratrol inhibited IL-18-dependent expression of VCAM-1 by tumor-activated hepatic sinusoidal endothelium, preventing melanoma cell adhesion to the microvasculature. Third, resveratrol inhibited adhesion- and proliferation-stimulating effects of IL-18 on metastatic melanoma cells through hydrogen peroxide-dependent nuclear factor-kappaB translocation blockade on these cells.;These results demonstrate multiple sites for therapeutic intervention using resveratrol within the prometastatic microenvironment generated by tumor-induced hepatic IL-18, and suggest a remarkable effect of resveratrol in the prevention of inflammation-dependent melanoma metastasis in the liver.",

We studied the use of HB1.F3.CD therapeutic NSCs, a well-characterized clonal cell line derived from human fetal telencephalon, for their potential of secreting prodrug-activating enzyme.

MCSP expression in a radial growth phase cell line also promotes an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition based on changes in cell morphology and the expression of several epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers. Finally, MCSP enhances the expression of c-Met and hepatocyte growth factor, and inhibiting c-Met expression or activation limits the increased growth and motility of multiple melanoma cell lines.

The gene for human interleukin-2 (IL-2) was transduced into the cells with a provirus (pZipNeoSVIL-2), packaged in GP + envAM12 cells. Integration of the IL-2 gene into genomic DNA of the transduced cells and its expression were established. The IL-2-secreting cell line (UISO-H-MEL-2-IL-2) was found to be free of recombinant retroviruses and other infectious agents. The IL-2-secreting cells will be subjected to 5000 rads X-irradiation and administered to 12 informed patients with metastatic malignant melanoma in a Phase I toxicity study. The dose of X-irradiation was sufficient to inactivate one hundred percent of the cells, but insufficient to completely inhibit IL-2 synthesis during a fourteen-day period of analysis. Patients who have failed all standard forms of treatment will become eligible for inclusion in the study if they develop metastatic melanoma, and if their tumor cells express products of the tyrosinase gene. The patients will differ with the cellular immunogen at no less than three of six MHC Class I alleles, but will share identity at the HLA-A2 Class I allele. The patient's antimelanoma immune response to the injected cells will be determined by both in vivo and in vitro parameters. Background studies performed in inbred mice indicate that X-irradiated IL-2-secreting cells that express both melanoma-associated antigens and allogeneic Class I histocompatibility antigens are more antigenic in terms of their capacity to induce an antimelanoma response than X-irradiated IL-2-secreting melanoma cells. Of significance for the future potential of this form of therapy in melanoma patients, the period of survival of mice was established melanoma treated with the IL-2-secreting allogeneic cells was significantly (P < 0.001) longer than that of untreated animals, or animals treated with X-irradiated melanoma cells. An analogous protocol was reviewed and approved by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee of the National Institutes of Health.",

Our group previously reported that in vitro riluzole treatment reduces cell growth in three-dimensional (3D) soft agar colony assays by 80% in cells with wildtype phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway activation. However, melanoma cell lines harboring constitutive activating mutations of the PI3K pathway (PTEN and NRAS mutations) showed only a 35% to 40% decrease in colony formation in soft agar in the presence of riluzole. In this study, we have continued our preclinical studies of riluzole and its effect on melanoma cells alone and in combination with inhibitors of the PI3 kinase pathway: the AKT inhibitor, API-2, and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, rapamycin. We modeled these combinatorial therapies on various melanoma cell lines in 3D and 2D systems and in vivo. Riluzole combined with mTOR inhibition is more effective at halting melanoma anchorage-independent growth and xenograft tumor progression than either agent alone. PI3K signaling changes associated with this combinatorial treatment shows that 3D (nanoculture) modeling of cell signaling more closely resembles in vivo signaling than monolayer models. Riluzole combined with mTOR inhibition is effective at halting tumor cell progression independent of BRAF mutational status. This makes this combinatorial therapy a potentially viable alternative for metastatic melanoma patients who are BRAF WT and are therefore ineligible for vemurafenib therapy. ",

Several mechanisms may account for this subversion, including the triggering of tolerance to tumor antigens [2, 3], TGF-alpha or IL-10 production, downregulation of MHC molecules, or upregulation of FasL expression [4, 5]. Melanoma cells may in some instances use FasL expression to protect themselves against tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) [4, 5]. Here, we show another, chemokine-dependent mechanism by which melanoma tumor cells shield themselves from immune reactions. Melanoma-inducible CCL5 (RANTES) production by infiltrating CD8 cells activates an apoptotic pathway in TIL involving cytochrome c release into the cytosol and activation of caspase-9 and -3. This process, triggered by CCL5 binding to CCR5, is not mediated by TNFalpha, Fas, or caspase-8. The effect is not unique to CCL5, as other CCR5 ligands such as CCL3 (MIP-1alpha) and CCL4 (MIP-1beta) also trigger TIL cell death, nor is it limited to melanoma cells, as it also operates in activated primary T lymphocytes. The model assigns a role to the CXC chemokine CXCL12 (SDF-1alpha) in this process, as this melanoma cell-produced chemokine upregulates CCL5 production by TIL, initiating TIL cell death.",

In the remaining patient marked differences were found in the percentage of melanoma cells stained by anti-HLA Class I antibodies in the two parts of the lymph node metastasis analyzed. Therefore this patient was not included in additional analyses to correlate the level of expression of HLA antigens with the clinical course of the disease. In all the lesions tested the percentage of melanoma cells stained by anti-HLA Class II antibodies was lower than or equal to but never higher than that stained by anti-HLA Class I antibodies.

We suggested that stathmin 1 (STMN1) might be a target of miR-193b. STMN1 normally regulates microtubule dynamics either by sequestering free tubulin heterodimers or by promoting microtubule catastrophe. Increased expression of STMN1 has been observed in a variety of human malignancies, but its association with melanoma is unknown. We now report that STMN1 is upregulated during the progression of melanoma relative to benign nevi, and that STMN1 is directly regulated by miR-193b. Using an experimental cell culture approach, overexpression of miR-193b using synthetic microRNAs repressed STMN1 expression, whereas inhibition of miR-193b with anti-miR oligos increased STMN1 expression in melanoma cells. The use of a luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-193b directly regulates STMN1 by targeting the 3'-untranslated region of STMN1 mRNA. We further demonstrated that STMN1 is overexpressed in malignant melanoma compared with nevi in two independent melanoma cohorts, and that its level is inversely correlated with miR-193b expression. However, STMN1 expression was not significantly associated with patient survival, Breslow depth, mitotic count or patient age. STMN1 knockdown by small-interfering RNA in melanoma cells drastically repressed cell proliferation and migration potential, whereas ectopic expression of STMN1 using lentivirus increased cell proliferation and migration rates. Subsequent gene expression analysis indicated that interconnected cytoskeletal networks are directly affected following STMN1 knockdown. In addition, we identified deregulated genes associated with proliferation and migration, and revealed that p21(Cip1/Waf1) and p27(Kip) could be downstream effectors of STMN1 signaling. Taken together, our study suggests that downregulation of miR-193b may contribute to increased STMN1 expression in melanoma, which consequently promotes migration and proliferation of tumor cells.",

Temozolomide, a promising new derivative of dacarbazine, is currently being tested for treatment of metastatic melanoma. Resistance to alkylating agents such as temozolomide correlates with increased expression of DNA repair protein O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). Interleukin-24 (IL-24; mda-7) is a tumor suppressor cytokine that selectively inhibits tumor cell growth by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in melanoma cell lines and solid tumors. This tumor-selective activity has been observed in multiple preclinical animal models and in clinical trials. In this study, we analyzed the ability of Ad-IL-24 and its protein product, IL-24, to overcome temozolomide resistance in human melanoma cells. We have shown that Ad-IL-24 via exogenous IL-24 protein induces combinatorial synergy of temozolomide-induced cell killing in temozolomide-resistant melanoma cells by inhibition of MGMT. Neutralizing antibodies against IL-24 or its receptors significantly blocked the apoptotic activity of IL-24 + MGMT treatment. We show that accumulation of functional p53 is essential for IL-24-induced down-regulation of MGMT. Using either MGMT small interfering RNA, p53 small interfering RNA, or a p53 dominant-negative mutant to block MGMT protein expression resulted in increased sensitization to temozolomide. However, MGMT blockade in combination with IL-24 + temozolomide resulted in loss of combinatorial synergy, indicating that MGMT expression is required for the reversal of temozolomide resistance in melanoma cells. This study shows that IL-24 can play a significant role in overcoming temozolomide resistance and that the clinical efficacy of temozolomide may be improved by using a biochemotherapy combination with IL-24.",

In the present study we have investigated possible mechanisms by which recombinant human interferons, IFN-alpha, -beta and -gamma, alter the antigenic profile of long- and short-term human melanoma cultures. IFN-alpha and -beta induced similar changes in the synthesis, expression and shedding of two TAAs, a HMW-MAA and a Cyt-MAA, in the established melanoma cell line Colo 38, whereas IFN-gamma exerted a differential effect on these melanoma associated antigens. Moreover, IFN-gamma was relatively more effective than IFN-alpha or -beta in upregulating the synthesis, expression and shedding of class I MHC antigens. At the same time a dramatic differential effect of the interferons was observed with class II MHC antigens. IFN-alpha or -beta induced a modest increase in the synthesis and expression of these antigens, whereas IFN-gamma was greater than 3-fold more active in inducing the synthesis and expression of DR/DP antigens and greater than 4- and greater than 10-fold more effective in increasing the synthesis and expression, respectively, of DQ antigens. Analysis of the levels of cytoplasmic mRNA for the DR-alpha and DQ-beta genes indicated no significant difference between IFN-alpha, beta or -gamma treated cells suggesting that IFN-gamma enhancement of the synthesis of DR and DQ antigens may occur at a posttranscriptional level. In the case of a newly established human melanoma cell line (MG-3) IFN-gamma enhanced the synthesis but not the expression of DR antigens and did not alter either the synthesis or expression of DQ antigens. Our studies indicate that the effects of interferons on the antigenic phenotype of melanoma cells will vary depending on the type of interferon employed, the antigen monitored and the target cell studied. In addition, it is also apparent that some of the biosynthetic steps involved in regulating the synthesis, expression and shedding of antigens may be coordinately regulated in some melanoma cells, whereas these processes may be under independent control in other melanoma populations.",

We have studied a set of human melanoma cell lines differing in their metastatic potential in nude mice as well as in normal melanocytes for changes in CD44 expression and function. All melanocytes and melanoma cell lines tested highly expressed the CD44 standard form (CD44s, 85 kDa) but variants at low levels only. With respect to one of the CD44-associated functions primarily involved in tumor progression we found that two highly metastatic tumor cell lines, MV3 and BLM, showed fivefold higher migration rates towards hyaluronate than melanomas with low metastatic potential and normal melanocytes. Moreover, the highly metastatic cell lines expressed four- to sixfold higher levels of the CD44 epitope involved in hyaluronic acid-binding (monoclonal antibody Hermes-1) than less aggressive melanomas and melanocytes. Hermes-1 efficiently blocked haptotaxis to hyaluronate, supporting the functional relevance of this epitope. In contrast, expression levels of other CD44s epitopes recognized by seven different anti-CD44 monoclonal antibodies were unchanged, suggesting that the migratory behaviour of the cells depends on the formation of the hyaluronate-binding Hermes-1 epitope rather than on the overall CD44s surface expression, which was virtually identical in all melanoma and melanocyte cell lines tested. Differences in the accessibility of the hyaluronate-binding epitope defined by Hermes-1 correlated with the phosphorylation state of CD44s, probably reflecting different activation states of the receptor. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation and pulse/chase studies revealed a three- to fivefold increase in CD44 synthesis in the highly aggressive melanoma cells as compared to the other cell lines and the melanocytes, indicating a reduction of CD44 half-life and up-regulation of turnover. Moreover, highly aggressive melanoma cell lines were found to shed significant amounts of CD44 from the cell surface and to secrete its ligand hyaluronic acid, which may refer to an \"autocrine' mechanism mediating melanoma cell motility.",

On the basis of previous expression studies, we aimed to trace melanoma cells in the blood of melanoma patients by RT-PCR of melanoma-inhibitory activity (MIA) mRNA. To detect sensitively MIA transcripts in total RNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we established a sensitive PCR-ELISA system. With this assay, we detected one melanoma cell in 2 ml of blood by a single round of 32 PCR cycles. A total of 295 PBMC samples isolated from 166 patients with melanocytic tumors were tested with the MIA RT-PCR-ELISA: (a) 58 patients (99 samples) with malignant melanomas in stage I; (b) 49 patients (65 samples) with malignant melanomas in stage II; and (c) 47 patients (116 samples) with metastasized melanomas (stages III and IV), with an additional 12 patients (15 samples) with benign melanocytic nevi. Forty-four (26.8%) of 164 samples isolated from patients with melanomas in stages I and II were positive for MIA mRNA; in stages III/IV, 33 (28.4%) of 116 samples of patients, irrespective of clinically evident disease, were positive. Eleven (84.6%) of 13 PBMC samples from patients with metastasized melanoma and clinically evident disease without treatment were MIA mRNA-positive in contrast to only 19 (25.7%) of 74 samples isolated from patients in stage IV with metastasis during chemotherapy. Furthermore, none of the 16 PBMC samples of patients in stage IV without clinically detectable metastases at that time point during chemotherapy was MIA mRNA-positive. Interestingly, of the 44 positive samples (26.8%) isolated from patients with melanomas in stages I and II, 20 were still positive when retested after complete excision of the tumor. Our results reveal that amplification of MIA mRNA from the PBMCs of patients with malignant melanomas by PCR-ELISA provides a useful means to detect tumor cells in the systemic blood circulation. A correlation between positive blood samples and tumor burden in stages III and IV was detected, and, in addition, a significant effect of chemotherapy with respect to the reduction of the number of systemically spread tumor cells was observed. However, MIA amplification seems to be of little value as a surrogate marker for clinical staging or the detection of metastatic disease.",

We recently showed that Survivin enhances melanoma cell motility through Akt-dependent upregulation of α5 integrin. However, the functional role of Survivin in melanoma metastasis is not clearly understood. We found that overexpression of Survivin in LOX and YUSAC2 human melanoma cells increased colony formation in soft agar, and this effect was abrogated by knockdown of α5 integrin by RNA interference. We employed melanoma cell xenografts to determine the in vivo effect of Survivin overexpression on melanoma metastasis. Although Survivin overexpression did not affect primary tumor growth of YUSAC2 or LOX subcutaneous tumors, or indices of proliferation or apoptosis, it significantly increased expression of α5 integrin in the primary tumors and formation of metastatic colonies in the lungs. Additionally, Survivin overexpression resulted in enhanced lung colony formation following intravenous (i.v.) injection of tumor cells in vivo and increased adherence to fibronectin-coated plastic in vitro. Importantly, in vivo inhibition of α5 integrin via intraperitoneal injection of an α5β1 integrin-blocking antibody significantly slowed tumor growth and reduced Survivin-enhanced pulmonary metastasis. Knockdown of α5 integrin in cells prior to i.v. injection also blocked Survivin-enhanced lung colony formation. These findings support a direct role for Survivin in melanoma metastasis, which requires α5 integrin and suggest that inhibitors of α5 integrin may be useful in combating this process.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein reverse transcriptase which RNA component (TERC) and reverse transcriptase (TERT) function together to elongate telomeres. If cells are to survive and proliferate indefinitely, telomere preservation is essential for the immortalization process. Somatic cells rarely possess TA, but over 90% of tumor cells express active telomerase. Increased cell proliferation and deregulation of cell cycle occur in human cancers, including cutaneous melanoma. The exact nature of links between TA, cell proliferation and apoptosis has not been extensively elucidated in cutaneous melanoma. We hypothesize a relationship between TA and cutaneous melanoma cell proliferation in a way that TA in telomere elongation is only an early event in cell immortalization. The telomere elongation makes their proliferation possible and being, at the same time, one of its limiting factors. But the TA other than telomere elongation (TERC independent) is crucial to initiate or restore melanoma cell proliferation. On the other hand, TA in telomere elongation, together with other factors (for example TNF), has an active anti-apoptotic role. This way melanoma cells overwhelm the apoptotic defense mechanisms, finally resulting in their indefinite proliferation. In evaluation of our hypothesis, we suggest thorough studies of both telomerase activity and proliferation in cutaneous melanoma on multiple checkpoints and targets. We also suggest combined analyses of TA and telomere length. This approach seems inevitable since it is obvious that telomerase is no longer just for the elongation of telomeres and, to our knowledge, most of the studies conducted so far evaluated TA as an expression of a single subunit or associated molecule.",

Here, we investigated the growth-inhibitory and antiangiogenic properties of PD0325901, a novel MEK inhibitor, in human melanoma cells. PD0325901 effects were determined in a panel of melanoma cell lines with different genetic aberrations. PD0325901 markedly inhibited ERK phosphorylation and growth of both BRAF mutant and wild-type melanoma cell lines, with IC(50) in the nanomolar range even in the least responsive models. Growth inhibition was observed both in vitro and in vivo in xenograft models, regardless of BRAF mutation status, and was due to G(1)-phase cell cycle arrest and subsequent induction of apoptosis. Cell cycle (cyclin D1, c-Myc, and p27(KIP1)) and apoptosis (Bcl-2 and survivin) regulators were modulated by PD0325901 at the protein level. Gene expression profiling revealed profound modulation of several genes involved in the negative control of MAPK signaling and melanoma cell differentiation, suggesting alternative, potentially relevant mechanisms of action. Finally, PD0325901 inhibited the production of the proangiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor and interleukin 8 at a transcriptional level. In conclusion, PD0325901 exerts potent growth-inhibitory, proapoptotic, and antiangiogenic activity in melanoma lines, regardless of their BRAF mutation status. Deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms of action of MEK inhibitors will likely translate into more effective treatment strategies for patients experiencing malignant melanoma.",

Because these animals lack functional B and T lymphocytes, they can accept human tumor xenografts and transfer of human effector cells. Here, we determined the ability of a human melanoma-specific, cytotoxic T-cell line (CTL) in suppressing the growth of spontaneously metastasizing human melanoma cells M24 met (HLA-A11, A33) in scid mice. This CTL line was highly cytotoxic and restricted by HLA-A11 against M24 met melanoma cells in vitro but poorly cytotoxic when tested against a human melanoma cell line that did not express HLA-A11. In order to evaluate the efficacy of this CTL line against M24 met melanoma cells in vivo, randomized groups of animals were given injections of either RPMI culture medium, interleukin 2 (IL-2), CTLs, or CTLs + IL-2. IL-2, per se, did not significantly reduce tumor metastases; however, injection of melanoma-specific, HLA-A11 restricted CTLs into scid mice, 1 day postexcision of the previously induced primary tumor, markedly reduced the number of metastatic foci in the lung and decreased metastatic involvement in lymph nodes. The combination of these CTLs with IL-2 proved even more effective, since almost all lung metastases were eradicated and metastatic involvement in both axillary and inguinal lymph nodes was substantially reduced. Our results indicate that these human CTLs maintain their ability for specific killing of metastasizing melanoma cells in scid mice.

In vitro, SKLB-M8 showed anti-proliferative activity with IC50 values of 0.07, 0.25, and 0.88 μM in A2058, CHL-1, and B16F10 cell lines, respectively. Flow cytometory analysis showed that SKLB-M8 induced G2/M arrest in three melanoma cell lines, and western blotting demonstrated that SKLB-M8 down-regulated the expression of cdc2, up-regulated p53 in A2058 and CHL-1 cells, and triggered cell apoptosis through down-regulating AKT and phosphorylated mTOR (p-mTOR). SKLB-M8 also inhibited HUVEC proliferation, migration, invasion, and tube formation in vitro with the inhibition of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2). In vivo, alginate-encapsulated tumor cell assay revealed that SKLB-M8 suppressed B16F10 tumor angiogenesis. In CHL-1- and B16F10-tumor-bearing mouse models, SKLB-M8 inhibited tumor growth by oral treatment with less toxicity.

In this study, we reported for the first time that human melanocytes and melanoma cells express MIF mRNA and produce MIF protein. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that MIF was mostly localized in the cytoplasm of melanocytes and G361 cells, a widely available human melanoma cell line. In particular, strong positive staining was observed at the dendrites of these cells. Expression of MIF mRNA and production of MIF protein were much higher in human melanoma cells such as G361, A375, and L32 than in normal cultured melanocytes. To assess the role of MIF overexpression in melanoma cells, G361 cells were transfected with an antisense human MIF plasmid. The results demonstrated that the cell growth rate of the transfected cells was markedly suppressed, suggesting that MIF participates in the mechanism of proliferation of melanoma cells. To further evaluate the function of MIF, we employed the Boyden chamber method to examine the effect on tumor cell migration and found that MIF enhanced the migration of G361 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, we administered anti-MIF antibody into tumor (G361 cells in a Millipore chamber)-bearing mice to assess the effect on tumor-associated angiogenesis. The anti-MIF antibody significantly suppressed tumor-induced angiogenesis.

Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) plays a major role in oncogenesis through its various functions in lipid transport, membrane trafficking, and signal transduction. Increased expression of Cav-1 in tumor cells has been associated with aggressiveness and poor survival. More recently, loss of stromal Cav-1 expression was linked to poor survival and increased metastatic potential in breast and prostate cancer. To date, there is no study addressing the clinical significance of Cav-1 expression in malignant melanoma (MM). Our study consisted of 44 cases of MM: 12 MM lymph node metastases from patients with short survival, 12 MM lymph node metastases from patients with long survival and 20 primary MM. All cases were stained with Cav-1 antibodies. Cav-1 expression in melanoma and stromal cells was quantified using a 3 point scale: 0 = no staining, 1 = diffuse weak staining or strong staining in < 30% of cells, and 2 = diffuse strong staining. A score of 0-1 represented low Cav-1 expression and a score of 2 represented high Cav-1 expression. In patients with MM lymph node metastases, a low stromal Cav-1 expression was associated with shorter survival when compared to the high stromal Cav-1 expression group (median survival 252 days versus 3,508 days, p value 0.0054). Conversely, high Cav-1 expression in melanoma cells was associated with a longer survival in primary MM (p < 0.0001). In conclusion, high expression of stromal Cav-1 correlates with longer survival in malignant melanoma metastases, and high expression of Cav-1 in melanoma cells correlates with longer survival in primary malignant melanoma.",

The cause and the molecular mechanism are still not clear.;In our study, mouse melanoma B16 cells were inoculated into mouse ischemic limbs and non-ischemic controls and the engrafted melanomas were subsequently observed. Vasculogenic mimicry channels in melanoma tumors of the two groups were counted and the expression of HIF-1alpha, MMP-2, MMP-9 and VEGF was assessed by immunohistochemical staining. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were used for immunohistochemical staining.;In the early stage of engrafted melanoma growth, the size of melanomas in ischemic limbs increased slower than in the controls. However, later there was no obvious difference in their size. Melanoma tumors in the ischemic group had more vasculogenic mimicry channels than those in the controls (P=0.039). Similarly, the expression of HIF-1alpha, MMP-2, MMP-9 and VEGF was higher in the ischemic group than in the non-ischemic controls (P=0.024, 0.047, 0.007 and 0.025, respectively). There was a positive association in melanoma cells of the ischemic group between expression of HIF-1alpha and VEGF, and also between MMP-9 and MMP-2. In the ischemic group, there was statistical significance for the correlation between HIF-1alpha and VEGF expression (r=0.456, P=0.038). Furthermore, MMP-2 expression was positively correlated with MMP-9 and VEGF expression (r=0.589 and 0.502, P=0.008 and 0.024, respectively).;Melanoma cells in a hypoxic microenvironment increased HIF-1alpha expression and induced the formation of vasculogenic mimicry channels to acquire an adequate blood supply. On the other hand, the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in tumor tissue increased to enhance the invasiveness.

The function of GMR in these nonhematopoietic cells is unknown. We studied the function of GMR in human melanoma cell lines. Six of seven cell lines tested (clones 1-5 and 3.44 of SK-MEL-131, SK-MEL-188, SK-MEL-23, SK-MEL-22, and SK-MEL-22A) expressed mRNA encoding the membrane-bound and soluble isoforms of the alpha subunit of the GMR. Melanoma cell lines in early stages of differentiation expressed the largest quantities of alpha-subunit mRNA. Although five of these lines expressed trace levels of mRNA encoding the beta subunit of the GMR, Scatchard analysis of equilibrium binding data derived from three of the cell lines showed that they expressed only low-affinity GMR. Clones 3.44 and 1-5 of SK-MEL-131, and SK-MEL-188 cells expressed receptors with a dissociation constant (kd) for GM-CSF in the following ranges: 0.7 to 0.8, 1.2 to 1.8, and 0.4 to 0.8 nmol/L, respectively. GM-CSF stimulated glucose uptake in four of the melanoma cell lines expressing the alpha subunit, presumably through facilitative glucose transporters, as uptake was blocked by cytochalasin B but not cytochalasin E. Stimulation of glucose uptake was transient, with maximum stimulation occurring at approximately 30 minutes in the presence of 1 nmol/L GM-CSF. GM-CSF stimulated glucose uptake 1.4- to 2.0-fold but did not stimulate cell proliferation. These results suggest a metabolic role for the low-affinity GMR in melanoma cell lines and indicate that the alpha subunit of the GMR can signal for increased glucose uptake in nonhematopoietic tumor cells.",

The gold standard for such analysis remains microscopic assessment of tissue sections, stained conventionally or by immunohistochemistry for appropriate tumor markers.

Recent studies have demonstrated a subgroup of patients whose sentinel nodes are negative on microscopy, but whose nodes yield an enhanced signal for melanoma markers when evaluated by RT-PCR. These enhanced signals reflect a mixture of signal sources, including small numbers of melanoma cells and cells other than melanoma cells that express the relevant markers(s). Because the preparative techniques for RT-PCR destroy the structural integrity of the tissues and disrupt individual cells, the exact cellular source of enhanced signal from a tissue cannot be demonstrated by conventional RT-PCR. RT in situ PCR, in which the RT-PCR technique is applied on a tissue section, does identify the cells that are the source of signal.

The efficacy of conventional therapeutic regimens for melanoma remains limited. Thus, it is important to explore novel effective therapeutic targets in the treatment of melanoma. The MAT2B gene encodes for the regulatory subunit of methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT). Recent studies have suggested that MAT2B may have functional roles other than modulating catalytic activity of MAT. In order to identify the roles of MAT2B in the tumorigenesis of malignant melanoma, we compared MAT2B expression profile in melanoma tissues with that in benign nevus samples. We employed lentivirus-mediated RNAi to downregulate the expression of MAT2B in malignant melanoma cell lines (A375 and Mel-RM), and investigated the effects of MAT2B on cell growth, colony-formation ability and apoptosis in vitro, as well as tumor growth of a xenograft model in vivo. The expression levels of BCL2 and XAF1 proteins, which were closely related to tumor cell apoptosis, were analyzed by western blot analysis. Our data showed that MAT2B was elevated in both primary and metastatic melanoma tissues compared with benign nevus samples. Lentivirus-mediated downregulation of MAT2B suppressed cell growth, colony formation and induced apoptosis in A375 and Mel-RM cell lines in vitro, affected protein expression of BCL2 and XAF1, extended the transplanted tumor growth in vivo. These results indicated that MAT2B was critical in the proliferation of melanoma cells and tumorigenicity. It may be considered as a potential anti-melanoma therapeutic target. ",

In the present study, we investigated whether targeting IL-8 by a fully human anti-IL-8 antibody (ABX-IL8) could be a potential therapeutic strategy to control angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis of melanoma. The human melanoma cells A375SM (high IL-8 producer) and TXM-13 (intermediate IL-8 producer) were injected subcutaneously into nude mice, which were then treated with ABX-IL8 (1 mg/3 times weekly, i.p., for 3 weeks). Tumor growth of both melanomas in ABX-IL8-treated mice was significantly inhibited when compared with control IgG-treated animals. ABX-IL8 treatment also suppressed experimental metastasis when the melanoma cells were injected intravenously. IL-8 blockade by ABX-IL8 significantly inhibited the promoter activity and the collagenase activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 in human melanoma cells, resulting in decreased invasion through reconstituted basement membrane in vitro. In vivo, ABX-IL8 treatment resulted in decreased expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2, and decreased vascularization (angiogenesis) of tumors concomitant with increased apoptosis of tumor cells. Moreover, in an in vitro vessel formation assay, ABX-IL8 directly interfered with the tubule formation by human umbilical vein endothelial cells.

Cryostat sections of 172 primary melanomas of the skin, 157 melanoma metastases and 56 nevi were investigated with an indirect immunoperoxidase method. Phenotypic heterogeneity was observed within lesions at all stages, and also within different tumors of the same patients. Despite this heterogeneity, principles of antigen expression were found. From the reaction pattern of MAbs, the following classifications of antigens were derived: \"constitutive\" markers of nevomelanocytic cells (M.2.2.4 and H.2.8.10) were found expressed over a wide range of local and systemic tumors. One MAA, K.1.2 (Suter et al., 1985), that declines with progression of melanoma, was classified as an \"early\" antigen, whereas MAA that appear in primary melanoma in proportion to invasiveness, and which are expressed in metastases of lymph nodes and visceral organs (A.1.43, and A.10.33), were classified as \"late\" markers of tumor progression. HLA-antigens were classified as \"intermediate\" markers, HLA-A,B,C, as an \"early-intermediate\", and HLA-DR as a \"late-intermediate\" marker. The occurrence of class II HLA, A.1.43-, and A.10.33-positive tumor cells in primary melanoma indicates a high metastatic potential of tumors, independent of tumor thickness.

Melanoma adhesion to the blood vessel wall is promoted by immune cell arrests and tumor-derived thrombin, a serine protease that converts soluble fibrinogen (sFg) into sFn. However, the molecular requirement for sFn-mediated melanoma-polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and melanoma-endothelial interactions under physiological flow conditions remain elusive. To understand this process, we studied the relative binding capacities of sFg and sFn receptors e.g., α(v)β(3) integrin and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expressed on melanoma cells, ICAM-1 on endothelial cells (EC), and CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1) on PMNs. Using a parallel-plate flow chamber, highly metastatic melanoma cells (1205Lu and A375M) and human PMNs were perfused over an EC monolayer expressing ICAM-1 in the presence of sFg or sFn. It was found that both the frequency and lifetime of direct melanoma adhesion or PMN-facilitated melanoma adhesion to the EC in a shear flow were increased by the presence of sFn in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, sFn fragment D and plasmin-treated sFn failed to increase melanoma adhesion, implying that sFn-bridged cell adhesion requires dimer-mediated receptor-receptor cross-linking. Finally, analysis of the respective kinetics of sFn binding to Mac-1, ICAM-1, and α(v)β(3) by single bond cell tethering assays suggested that ICAM-1 and α(v)β(3) are responsible for initial capture and firm adhesion of melanoma cells. These results provide evidence that sFn enhances melanoma adhesion directly to ICAM-1 on the EC, while prolonged shear-resistant melanoma adhesion requires interactions with PMNs.",

The extent of down-modulation depended on the level of c-myc expression in a dose-dependent way. Taken together, these data suggested to us that one of the results of high c-myc expression could be the induction of a NK susceptible phenotype in melanoma cells. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of c-myc on NK susceptibility. We have found that high expression of transfected c-myc genes indeed converts the melanoma cell lines from poor into good targets for NK cells. IFN-gamma was used to restore the class I HLA expression of the c-myc transfectants, and the resulting cells showed a decreased NK susceptibility.

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) is a transcription factor that is activated by IFN-alpha and is thought to mediate the majority of its antitumor effects. Loss of STAT1 has been found in IFN-resistant melanoma cells. We developed a murine melanoma cell line in a STAT1-deficient mouse. We also transfected B16 melanoma cells with a wild-type form of STAT1 to induce its overexpression. Using the resulting cell lines and STAT1-deficient mice, we tested whether IFN-alpha could exert an antitumor effect on melanoma cells in the absence of STAT1-mediated signal transduction.;A melanoma tumor was induced in STAT1-deficient mice via the application of DMBA (tumor initiator) followed by croton oil (tumor promoter). Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that the resulting tumor was a malignant melanoma. Immunoblot analysis, intracellular flow cytometry, and gel-shift analysis were used to confirm the lack of STAT1 in the derivative cell line (AGS-1). In addition, the STAT1 protein was overexpressed in B16 melanoma cells by stable transfection with a plasmid construct encoding wild-type STAT1. The effects of IFN-alpha on these cell lines were studied in vitro and in vivo.;STAT1 was not expressed in the AGS-1 murine melanoma cell line. Treatment with IFN-alpha did not lead to activation of STAT1. Cell proliferation assays revealed that while IFN-alpha did not exert an antiproliferative effect on this cell line, it was capable of prolonging the survival of STAT1-competent C57BL/6 mice bearing 1 x 10(6) AGS-1 tumor cells in the intraperitoneal position (n = 20, P < 0.05), as compared to PBS-treated controls. Also, the survival of IFN-alpha-treated mice (as compared to PBS-treated controls) was not affected by the overexpression of STAT1 in B16 tumor cells.;This data suggests that IFN-alpha can enhance survival in an animal model where STAT1-mediated signal transduction and gene regulation is absent within the tumor but is present within the host. This data also indicates that the overexpression of STAT1 within the tumor does not significantly enhance the effects of exogenously administered IFN-alpha in this model. These findings indicate that the bulk of the antitumor actions of IFN-alpha may be derived from its effects on host tissues.",

These results correlated with biochemical parameters such as lung collagen hydroxyproline, hexosamine and uronic acid contents, serum sialic acid and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase levels, and histopathological analysis. Treatment with thujone downregulated the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor. Thujone administration downregulated the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1, ERK-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and also upregulated the expression of nm-23, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1, and TIMP-2 in the lung tissue of metastasis-induced animals.

To date, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remain unknown. Since the loss of MTAP expression resulted in induced secretion of 5'-deoxy-5'-(methylthio)adenosine (MTA), we hypothesized that MTA might modulate the observed effects. We first determined MTA levels produced by tumor cells in vitro and in situ by means of stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Subsequently, we revealed induction of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and growth factor gene expression in melanoma cells accompanied by enhanced invasion and vasculogenic mimicry. In addition, MTA induced the secretion of basis fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and MMP3 from fibroblasts and the upregulation of activator protein-1 (AP-1) activity in melanoma cells and fibroblasts. In summary, we demonstrated a tumor-supporting role of MTA.",

In the pretext of inciting anticancer effect through inhibiting nitric oxide synthase (NOS) via estrogen receptors (ER) in ER-expressing skin cancer cells, we developed an estrogen-linked L-nitro-arginine molecule (ESAr) for inciting anticancer effect in melanoma cells. ESAr showed specific anticancer effect through diminishing aggressiveness and metastatic behavior in melanoma cells and tumor. In comparison, ESAr showed significantly higher antiproliferative effect than parent molecule L-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME, a NOS inhibitor) through induction of prominent apoptosis in melanoma cells. ESAr-pretreated aggressive melanoma cells could not form tumor possibly because of transformation/differentiation into epithelial-type cells. Furthermore, its antiangiogenic effect was demonstrated through ESAr-induced antiproliferation in HUVEC cells and apoptosis-induction in tumor-associated vascular endothelial cells, thereby significantly restricting severe growth in melanoma tumor. The targeting moiety, estrogen, at the therapeutic concentration of ESAr has apparently no effect in tumor-growth reduction. Albeit, no specific NOS-inhibition was observed, but ESAr could simultaneously induce these three cancer-specific antiaggressiveness factors, which the parent molecule could not induce. Our data rationalize and establish a new use of estrogen as a ligand for potentially targeting multiple cellular factors for treating aggressive cancers.",

We have previously reported on a mimotope-based vaccine against CSPG4 in a human melanoma xenograft model that resulted in reduction of tumor growth. Herein we describe the influence of hypoxia on the response to polyclonal anti-CSPG4-antibodies induced by this vaccine in combination with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib to enhance therapeutic efficacy by simultaneously targeting multiple signaling pathways. Melanoma cells were treated with polyclonal anti-CSPG4-antibodies and vemurafenib. Proliferation, migration and invasion were evaluated in a real-time setting in the impedance-based x-CELLigence® system. Western blotting and quantitative PCR arrays were used to determine protein and mRNA expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF1α), carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) and signaling pathway proteins. A melanoma xenograft model was used to detect HIF1α and CAIX expression in vivo. Hypoxia enhanced the antiproliferative response to vemurafenib. The migration and invasion capacities of vemurafenib-treated melanoma cells were increased, in spite of vemurafenib-decreased expression of HIF1α and CAIX. Polyclonal anti-CSPG4-antibodies reduced the Transwell migration of vemurafenib-treated, BRAF V600E-mutant and CSPG4-expressing melanoma cells in hypoxia. This was associated with the downregulation of phosphorylated AKT, a kinase contributing to tumor cell migration.

In malignant melanoma, its potential contribution to chemoresistance is uncertain. Here, we show that ABCB5, which functions as a determinant of membrane potential and regulator of cell fusion in physiologic skin progenitor cells, is expressed in clinical malignant melanoma tumors and preferentially marks a subset of hyperpolarized, CD133+ stem cell phenotype-expressing tumor cells in malignant melanoma cultures and clinical melanomas. We found that ABCB5 blockade significantly reversed resistance of G3361 melanoma cells to doxorubicin, an agent to which clinical melanomas have been found refractory, resulting in a 43% reduction in the LD50 from 4 to 2.3 micromol/L doxorubicin (P < 0.05). Our results identified ABCB5-mediated doxorubicin efflux transport as the underlying mechanism of resistance, because ABCB5 blockade significantly enhanced intracellular drug accumulation. Consistent with this novel ABCB5 function and mechanism in doxorubicin resistance, gene expression levels of the transporter across a panel of human cancer cell lines used by the National Cancer Institute for drug screening correlated significantly with tumor resistance to doxorubicin (r = 0.44; P = 0.016). Our results identify ABCB5 as a novel drug transporter and chemoresistance mediator in human malignant melanoma. Moreover, our findings show that ABCB5 is a novel molecular marker for a distinct subset of chemoresistant, stem cell phenotype-expressing tumor cells among melanoma bulk populations and indicate that these chemoresistant cells can be specifically targeted via ABCB5 to enhance cytotoxic efficacy.",

The fusion construct bound specifically to gp240 antigen-positive but not to antigen-negative cells. The TNF component of the construct was biologically active (specific activity = 1 x 10(7) U/mg) compared with free TNF (specific activity = 2.6 x 10(7) U/mg) and was more cytotoxic to antigen-positive A375-M melanoma cells (IC(50) = 100 pM) than TNF alone (IC(50) = 1,000 pM) and, additionally, was active against AAB-527 melanoma cells (IC(50) = 20 nM) resistant to TNF itself (IC(50) > 1,000 nM). The augmented cytotoxicity was mediated by antibody-specific binding to the cell surface. Both A375-M and AAB-527 cells were shown to express TNFR1 and TNFR2 on the cell surface.

We proposed that induction of a microtubule-stabilizing protein in primary melanoma could disrupt the dynamic instability of microtubules, inhibit cell division and prevent or delay tumor progression. Here we show, by Kaplan-Meier survival and multivariate Cox regression analysis, that patients diagnosed with MAP2+ primary melanomas have significantly better metastatic disease-free survival than those with MAP2- disease. Investigation of the mechanisms that underlie the effect of MAP2 on melanoma progression showed that MAP2 expression in metastatic melanoma cell lines leads to microtubule stabilization, cell cycle arrest in G2-M phase and growth inhibition. Disruption of microtubule dynamics by MAP2 resulted in multipolar mitotic spindles, defects in cytokinesis and accumulation of cells with large nuclei, similar to those seen in vivo in MAP2+ primary melanomas cells.

Our team has shown that melanoma cells, grown as spheroids in a neural cell crest medium, polarize toward an invasive phenotype, characterized by a higher motility, a poor proliferation rate and a gain of pluripotency gene expression (Nanog and Oct4) when compared with cells grown in two dimensions in a serum-contaning medium. In agreement with the phenotypic switching hypothesis, most of these features are reversible. Microarray studies comparing two- vs. three-dimensional cultures revealed the downregulation of a polycomb-like protein, PHF19 (PHD finger protein 19), in the spheroids. As Polycomb proteins are involved in the epigenetic control of gene expression, we hypothesized that PHF19 might play a role in the switch between proliferative and invasive phenotypes. In this report, we show that PHF19 silencing reduces the cell proliferation rate and increases the transendothelial migration capacities of melanoma cell lines. However, PHF19 does not modulate the transcription level of Oct4 and Nanog. In the search of an upstream transcriptional regulator of the above genes, we identified the Akt signaling cascade as an inhibitor of Oct4 and Nanog expression and an activator for PHF19 expression. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation, we further provide evidence that phospho-Akt is part of the transcriptional complex associated to the promoters of all three genes. Our data therefore indicate the role of PHF19 and its upstream regulator, Akt, in the phenotype switch of melanoma cells from proliferative to invasive states.",

Using A375 (BRAF-mutated) and Hs294t (non BRAF-mutated but highly metastatic) human melanoma cell lines, we found that in vitro treatment with silymarin resulted in a dose-dependent: (i) reduction in cell viability; (ii) enhancement of either Go/G1 (A375) or G2-M (Hs294t) phase cell cycle arrest with corresponding alterations in cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases; and (iii) induction of apoptosis. The silymarin-induced apoptosis of human melanoma cells was associated with a reduction in the levels of anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl), an increase in the levels of pro-apoptotic protein (Bax), and activation of caspases. Further, oral administration of silymarin (500 mg/kg body weight/2× a week) significantly inhibited (60%, P < 0.01) the growth of BRAF-mutated A375 melanoma tumor xenografts, and this was associated with: (i) inhibition of cell proliferation; (ii) induction of apoptosis of tumor cells; (iii) alterations in cell cycle regulatory proteins; and (iv) reduced expression of tumor angiogenic biomarkers in tumor xenograft tissues.

The determination of PAF synthesized by IFN gamma-stimulated tumor cells revealed that 70% of newly synthesized PAF was released into growth media, while the remaining 30% was associated with the cell bodies. An experimental protocol based on the use of WEB 2086, a PAF receptorial antagonist, was designed to explore which of the two fractions of PAF synthesized by IFN gamma-stimulated F10-M3 cells (released into the growth medium or associated with the cell bodies) is essential to their capacity to migrate through Matrigel. We found that the PAF secreted into growth medium is the fraction responsible for the enhanced invasiveness of melanoma cells stimulated with IFN gamma. We also investigated whether motility of melanoma cells is stimulated by IFN gamma, and, if so, whether PAF is involved in this effect. We found that WEB 2086 prevented the remodeling of stress fibers, examined as an index of cell motility, that we observed in F10-M3 cells stimulated with IFN gamma. Furthermore, the observation that PAF receptor is expressed in IFN gamma-stimulated melanoma cells suggests that the invasive phenotype (e.g. migration through a reconstituted basement membrane and motility) promoted by PAF is based on an autocrine mechanism. On the whole, these results might indicate that PAF contributes to the expression of properties typical of an invasive phenotype in tumor cells stimulated with cytokines.",

It is thus feasible to develop immunotherapeutic approaches based on the melanocytic marker profiles of melanoma cells. One of the predictors of the success rate of such a treatment is the extent of positive (target) tumor cells within the lesions of the patient. First, we investigated the presence of these three proteins in 18 human melanoma cell lines using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. In 11 cell lines, mRNA and protein of all three markers could be detected; in one cell line, only two markers were present, and six melanoma cell lines showed no evidence for these markers. Secondly, we stained frozen sections of 105 human melanocytic lesions, 13 common nevocellular nevi, 13 atypical nevi, 13 early primary melanomas (Breslow < 1.5 mm), 25 advanced primary melanomas (aPM; Breslow > or =1.5 mm), and 41 melanoma metastases (MM) with antibodies against glycoprotein 100, melanoma antigen recognized by T cells, and tyrosinase. In addition, we used the 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine reaction to detect tyrosinase enzyme activity as a confirmation of the tyrosinase immunohistochemical results in a subset of the lesions. In the benign lesions, glycoprotein 100 was more prominently expressed in epidermal melanocytes, whereas melanoma antigen recognized by T cells was encountered in all or nearly all dermal melanocytes in all nevocellular nevi and atypical nevus lesions. Tyrosinase was found in a lower percentage of melanocytes, both in the epidermis and in the dermis within these lesions. With regard to heterogeneity of staining within the malignant lesions, we found that 54% (early primary melanomas), 48% (aPMs), and 56% (MM) of the lesions stained within the same staining category for all three proteins studied. Approximately 17% of the aPM and MM lesions did not show positive tumor cells for any of the three proteins. We conclude that a subgroup of patients with high expression should be selected for immunotherapeutic treatment approaches based on the presence of these proteins.",

This in turn promoted cellular proliferation by activating PLD1 expression and subsequent AKT phosphorylation, which eventually resulted in suppressed ceramide generation and apoptosis. On the other hand, B16F10 melanoma tumors preferentially blocked the expression of PKCδ isotype, which otherwise could exhibit antagonistic effects on PKCα-PLD1-AKT signaling and rendered B16F10 cells more sensitive to apoptosis via generating ceramide and subsequently triggering caspase pathway.

However, some cancer cell types including malignant melanoma cells are resistant             to TRAIL cytotoxicity. Here, we show that diallyl trisulfide (DATS), a garlic             organosulfur compound, sensitizes melanoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis while             sparing normal cells. DATS also potentiates apoptosis induced by agonistic antibodies             against death receptors (DR) 4 and DR5. The amplification of DR-mediated apoptosis             was associated with increased mitochondrial membrane potential collapse and caspase-3/7             activation. However, these events were not sufficient for full sensitization.             TRAIL also induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, as indicated by the activation             of X-box-binding protein 1 and caspase-12 and DATS poten-tiated both events. Moreover,             inhibition of caspase-12, but not caspase-4, abolished the amplification of apoptosis,             indicating that ER stress plays a crucial role. On the other hand, DATS and/or             TRAIL induced minimal apoptosis and caspase-12 activation in melanocytes despite             their substantial expression of DR4 and DR5 on the cell surface. Our data suggest             that DATS amplifies death ligand-induced melanoma cell death by disrupting their             adaptation to ER-mediated death pathway.

However, systematic in vivo analyses of the functional relevance of L-plastin for tumor cell metastasis were so far lacking.;We investigated the relevance of L-plastin expression and phosphorylation by ectopical expression of L-plastin in human melanoma cells (MV3) and knock-down of endogenous L-plastin in prostate cancer (PC3M).

Vice versa, and in line with these findings, ectopic expression of L-plastin in L-plastin negative melanoma cells significantly increased the number of metastases. Strikingly, the metastasis promoting effect of L-plastin was not observed if a non-phosphorylatable L-plastin mutant was expressed.;Our data provide the first in vivo evidence that expression of L-plastin promotes tumor metastasis and, importantly, that this effect depends on an additionally required phosphorylation of L-plastin.

One of the mechanisms by which residual melanoma cells become chemoresistant is via the decreased efficiency of chemotherapeutics through the action of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins that are variably expressed by the tumor cells. The clinical relevance of the ABC transporters in the context of cancer is paramount. Inhibitors of these transporters have been shown to increase the efficacy of standard therapy in experimental systems. Their clinical application requires better understanding of the role individual transporters play in the mechanism and the development of more specific inhibitors with minimal off target effects. ABC transporters in tumor cells have been shown to confer multidrug resistance in many solid tumors. However, their role in melanomas is far from clear. Here, we prospectively identify ABCB8 as a specific and major player in the chemoresistance of several melanoma cell lines. ABCB8 knockdown with shRNA reduced doxorubicin resistance approximately 3- to 4-fold in these cells. Furthermore, we show that this reversal is specific to doxorubicin and not to other commonly used chemotherapeutics.

The gene expression pattern of the cocultured A2058 cells was only modestly affected, whereas the HS-68 fibroblast gene expression pattern was significantly altered. Interleukin-11 and inhibitor of DNA-binding domain-1 gene expression in the cocultured A2058 cells was down-regulated, indicative of a proinflammatory response and resistance to apoptosis, respectively. The overall pattern of up-regulated genes indicated triggering of the proinflammatory process.

These results were corroborated by additional coculture experiments with the melanoma cell lines WM-164, BLM, and SK-Mel-28 and immunohistochemistry on invasive human melanoma sections. Taken together, these results indicate that tumor cells cause a proinflammatory and melanoma growth-promoting response in stromal fibroblasts.

MIC-1 was overexpressed in approximately 67% of advanced melanomas, accompanied by fivefold to six-fold higher levels of secreted protein in serum of melanoma patients compared with normal individuals. Constitutively active mutant (V600E)B-Raf in melanoma regulated downstream MIC-1 expression. Indeed, small-interfering RNA-mediated targeting of MIC-1 or (V600E)B-Raf reduced expression and secretion by three-fold to fivefold. This decrease in MIC-1 levels reduced melanoma tumorigenesis by approximately threefold, but did not alter cultured cell growth, suggesting a unique function other than growth control. Instead, inhibition of MIC-1 was found to mechanistically retard melanoma tumor vascular development, subsequently affecting tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis. This role in melanoma angiogenesis was confirmed by comparing MIC-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) function in chick chorioallantoic membrane and matrigel plug assays. Similar to VEGF in melanomas, MIC-1 stimulated directional vessel development, acting as a potent angiogenic factor. Thus, MIC-1 is secreted from melanoma cells together with VEGF to promote vascular development mediated by (V600E)B-Raf signaling.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Uveal melanoma is an aggressive disease without effective adjuvant therapy for metastases. Despite genomic differences between cutaneous and uveal melanomas, therapies based on shared biological factors could be effective against both tumor types. High expression of glycoprotein-NMB (GPNMB) in cutaneous melanomas led to the development of CDX-011 (glembatumumab vedotin), a fully human monoclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of GPNMB conjugated to the cytotoxic microtubule toxin monomethylauristatin E. Ongoing phase II trials suggest that CDX-011 has activity against advanced cutaneous melanomas. To determine the potential role of CDX-011 in uveal melanomas, we studied their GPNMB expression. Paraffin-embedded tissues from 22 uveal melanomas treated by enucleation from 2004-2007 at one institution were evaluated immunohistochemically for expression of GPNMB using biotinylated CDX-011 (unconjugated) antibody. Melanoma cells were evaluated for percentage and intensity of expression. Spectral imaging was used in one case with high melanin content. Clinical data were reviewed. Twelve women and 10 men with a median age of 58.7 years (range: 28-83 years) were included. Eighteen of 21 tumors evaluated immunohistochemically (85.7%) expressed GPNMB in 10-90% of tumor cells with variable intensity (5 tumors, 1+; 11, 2+; and 2, 3+). Eleven of 18 tumors (61.1%) expressed GPNMB in >or=50% of cells. Spectral imaging showed diffuse CDX-011 (unconjugated) reactivity in the remaining case. Uveal melanoma, like cutaneous melanoma, commonly expresses GPNMB. Ongoing clinical trials of CDX-011 should be extended to patients with metastatic uveal melanoma to determine potential efficacy in this subset of patients with melanoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Melanomas are malignant tumors of melanocytes that, if not detected early, are highly aggressive and poorly treatable. Activation of extracellular signal-regulated (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling is commonly found in melanomas mainly through oncogenic mutations of B-Raf. We previously reported that activation of ERK/MAP kinase stimulates synthesis of fibronectin by upregulating the transcription factor early growth response-1 (Egr-1). To further analyze the link between ERK/MAP kinase pathway and fibronectin in melanoma, we have studied the regulation and role of fibronectin produced by melanoma cells bearing oncogenic B-Raf mutation. We show that fibronectin is expressed in situ during tumor progression and that high fibronectin and Egr-1 levels are found in cells expressing this mutation. Expression of active mutants of B-Raf induces fibronectin, whereas endogenous fibronectin is inhibited by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion of B-Raf or Egr-1. In contrast, stimulation of ERK pathway is insufficient to promote fibronectin upregulation in normal melanocytes. Finally, we show that suppression of fibronectin by siRNA leads to decreased melanoma cell invasiveness in vitro. These results reveal a tumor-specific regulation of fibronectin by constitutive ERK/MAP kinase signaling and indicate that self-production of fibronectin may play a role in melanoma tumorigenesis, by promoting tumor cell invasion.",

Emerging evidence suggests that T cells themselves may provoke immune escape of cancer cells. Here, we describe a well-controlled co-culture system for studying the dynamic T cell - cancer cell interplay, using human melanoma as a model. We explain starting material, controls, and culture parameters to establish reproducible and comparable cultures with highly heterogeneous tumor cells. Low passage melanoma cell lines and melanoma-specific CD8+ T cell clones generated from patient blood were cultured together for up to 3 days. Living melanoma cells were isolated from the co-culture system by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. We demonstrate that the characterization of isolated melanoma cells is feasible using flow cytometry for protein expression analysis as well as an Agilent whole human genome microarray and the NanoString technology for differential gene expression analysis. In addition, we identify five genes (ALG12, GUSB, RPLP0, KRBA2, and ADAT2) that are stably expressed in melanoma cells independent of the presence of T cells or the T cell-derived cytokines IFNγ and TNFα. These genes are essential for correct normalization of gene expression data by NanoString. Further to the characterization of melanoma cells after exposure to CTLs, this experimental system might be suitable to answer a series of questions, including how the affinity of CTLs for their target antigen influences the melanoma cell response and whether CTL-induced gene expression changes in melanoma cells are reversible. Taken together, our human T cell - melanoma cell culture system is well suited to characterize immune-related mechanisms in cancer cells. ",

Oct4 is expressed by CSC-like cells in different types of cancer. However, function of Oct4 in tumor cells is unclear. In this study, we showed that expression of Oct4 gene or transmembrane delivery of Oct4 protein promoted dedifferentiation of melanoma cells to CSC-like cells. The dedifferentiated melanoma cells showed significantly decreased expression of melanocytic markers and acquired the ability to form tumor spheroids. They showed markedly increased resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and hypoxic injury. In the subcutaneous xenograft and tail vein injection assays, these cells had significantly increased tumorigenic capacity. The dedifferentiated melanoma cells acquired features associated with CSCs such as multipotent differentiation capacity and expression of melanoma CSC markers such as ABCB5 and CD271. Mechanistically, Oct4-induced dedifferentiation was associated with increased expression of endogenous Oct4, Nanog and Klf4, and global gene expression changes that enriched for transcription factors. RNAi-mediated knockdown of Oct4 in dedifferentiated cells led to diminished CSC phenotypes. Oct4 expression in melanoma was regulated by hypoxia and its expression was detected in a sub-population of melanoma cells in clinical samples. Our data indicate that Oct4 is a positive regulator of tumor dedifferentiation. The results suggest that CSC phenotype is dynamic and may be acquired through dedifferentiation.

Melanoma shows weak response to TRAIL because of its low level of TRAIL death receptors. Here, we investigated whether indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, can potentiate TRAIL-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells. We showed that indomethacin was capable of promoting TRAIL-induced cell death and apoptosis in A375 melanoma cells. Mechanistically, indomethacin induced cell surface expression of death receptor 5 (DR5) in melanoma cells and also in various types of cancer cells. DR5 knockdown abolished the enhancing effect of indomethacin on TRAIL responses. Induction of the DR5 by indomethacin was found to be p53 independent but dependent on the induction of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP). Knockdown of CHOP abolished indomethacin-induced DR5 expression and the associated potentiation of TRAIL-mediated cell death. In addition, indomethacin-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production preceded upregulation of CHOP and DR5, and consequent sensitization of cells to TRAIL. We also found that indomethacin treatment downregulated survivin via ROS and the NF-κB-mediated signaling pathways. Interestingly, indomethacin also converted TRAIL-resistant melanoma MeWo and SK-MEL-5 cells into TRAIL-sensitive cells. Taken together, our results indicate that indomethacin can potentiate TRAIL-induced apoptosis through upregulation of death receptors and downregulation of survivin. ",

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous noncoding RNAs able to posttranscriptionally downregulate the expression of direct target genes. Using a melanoma progression model, miR-146a was identified as a key double-acting player in melanoma malignancy. In fact, miR-146a is able to enhance tumor growth, while it suppresses dissemination. It was determined that miR-146a coordinated melanoma cell growth by its direct targets lunatic fringe (LFNG) and NUMB, which operate on the NOTCH/PTEN/Akt pathway; while inhibition of metastasis formation was linked to decreased expression of ITGAV and ROCK1. Relevantly, miR-146a expression correlated with melanoma recurrence and was enriched in both patient-derived melanoma and cutaneous metastasis specimens, while its direct targets were depleted. However, miR-146a levels drop in circulating tumor cells (CTCs), suggesting the necessity for miR-146a expression to fluctuate during tumor progression in order to favor tumor growth and allow dissemination. This study reconciles the contradictory biologic functions of miR-146a in melanoma progression and unravels distinct molecular mechanisms that need to be considered for therapeutic interventions.;miR-146a controls melanoma progression in a dual way, promoting growth and inhibiting dissemination; however, it is poorly expressed in CTCs, resulting in overall tumor spreading and distant-site colonization.

We previously suggested that the immunogenicity of autologus tumor vaccines in humans may be augmented by engineering vaccinating tumor cell membranes to express alpha-galactosyl (alpha-gal) epitopes (i.e., Galalpha1,3Galbeta1,4GlcNAc-R). Subsequent in situ binding of natural anti-Gal IgG molecules to these epitopes would result in the formation of immune complexes that target tumor vaccines for uptake by APCs, via the interaction of the Fc portion of anti-Gal with Fcgamma receptors on APCs. This hypothesis was tested in a unique experimental animal model of knockout mice for alpha1,3galactosyltransferase (alpha1,3GT) and the mouse melanoma B16-BL6 (referred to here as BL6). Like humans, these mice lack alpha-gal epitopes and produce anti-GaL BL6 melanoma cels are highly tumorigenic, and like human tumor cells, they lack alpha-gal epitopes. Expression of alpha-gal epitopes on these melanoma cells was achieved by stable transfection with alpha,3GT cDNA. The transfected melanoma cells (termed BL6alphaGT) express approximately 2 x 10(6) alpha-gal epitopes per cell and readily form immune complexes with anti-Gal. Vaccination of the mice with 2 x 10(6) irradiated melanoma cells that express alpha-gal epitopes, followed by challenge with 0.5 x 10(6) live parental melanoma cells, resulted in protection for at least 2 months (i.e, no tumor growth) in one-third of the mice, whereas all mice immunized with irradiated parental melanoma cells developed tumors 21-26 days post-challenge. The proportion of protected mice doubled when the mice were immunized twice with irradiated melanoma cells expressing alpha-gal epitopes and challenged with 0.2 x 10(6) live BL6 cells. Histological studies on the developing tumors in challenged mice that were immunized with melanoma cells expressing alpha-gal epitopes demonstrated extensive infiltration of T lymphocytes and macrophages, whereas no mononuclear cell infiltrates were observed in tumors of mice immunized with parental tumor cells. Overall, these studies imply that immunization of alpha1,3GT knockout mice with BL6 melanoma cells that express alpha-gal epitopes elicits, in a proportion of the population, protective immune response against the same tumor lacking such epitopes. These studies further suggest that similar immunization of cancer patients with autologous tumor vaccines that are engineered to express alpha-gal epitopes may increase the immune response to autologous tumor-associated antigens and, thus, may elicit immune-mediated destruction of metastatic cells expressing these antigens.",

Therapies targeting this coinhibitory axis have proven clinically successful in the treatment of metastatic melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and other malignancies. Therapeutic agents targeting the epigenetic regulatory family of histone deacetylases (HDAC) have shown clinical success in the treatment of some hematologic malignancies. Beyond direct tumor cell cytotoxicity, HDAC inhibitors have also been shown to alter the immunogenicity and enhance antitumor immune responses. Here, we show that class I HDAC inhibitors upregulated the expression of PD-L1 and, to a lesser degree, PD-L2 in melanomas. Evaluation of human and murine cell lines and patient tumors treated with a variety of HDAC inhibitors in vitro displayed upregulation of these ligands. This upregulation was robust and durable, with enhanced expression lasting past 96 hours. These results were validated in vivo in a B16F10 syngeneic murine model. Mechanistically, HDAC inhibitor treatment resulted in rapid upregulation of histone acetylation of the PD-L1 gene leading to enhanced and durable gene expression. The efficacy of combining HDAC inhibition with PD-1 blockade for treatment of melanoma was also explored in a murine B16F10 model. Mice receiving combination therapy had a slower tumor progression and increased survival compared with control and single-agent treatments. These results highlight the ability of epigenetic modifiers to augment immunotherapies, providing a rationale for combining HDAC inhibitors with PD-1 blockade.",

Melanoma cells were found to be more susceptible to vitamin C toxicity than any other tumor cells. The present study has shown that sodium ascorbate decreases cellular iron uptake by melanoma cells in a dose- and time-dependent fashion, indicating that intracellular iron levels may be a critical factor in sodium ascorbate-induced apoptosis. Indeed, sodium ascorbate-induced apoptosis is enhanced by the iron chelator, desferrioxamine (DFO) while it is inhibited by the iron donor, ferric ammonium citrate (FAC). Moreover, the inhibitory effects of sodium ascorbate on intracellular iron levels are blocked by addition of transferrin, suggesting that transferrin receptor (TfR) dependent pathway of iron uptake may be regulated by sodium ascorbate. Cells exposed to sodium ascorbate demonstrated down-regulation of TfR expression and this precedes sodium ascorbate-induced apoptosis. Taken together, sodium ascorbate-mediated apoptosis appears to be initiated by a reduction of TfR expression, resulting in a down-regulation of iron uptake followed by an induction of apoptosis. This study demonstrates the specific mechanism of sodium ascorbate-induced apoptosis and these findings support future clinical trial of sodium ascorbate in the prevention of human melanoma relapse.",

The secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) a component of the ECM, impairs the proliferation of different cell types and modulates tumor cell aggressive features. This apparent paradox might result either from the biochemical properties of the different SPARC sources or from differential responses of malignant and stromal cells to SPARC. To test these hypotheses, we purified SPARC secreted by melanoma cells (hMel-SPARC) and compared its activity with different recombinant SPARC preparations, including a new one produced in insect cells. All 5 SPARC species were effective in inhibiting bovine aortic endothelial cell proliferation, adhesion and migration. We then used the melanoma-derived protein to assess SPARC effect on additional cell types. hMel-SPARC greatly impaired the proliferation of both normal and transformed human endothelial cells and exerted a moderate biphasic effect on human fetal fibroblasts proliferation, irrespective of their endogenous SPARC levels. However, SPARC had no effect on the proliferation of several human cancer cell lines regardless of their endogenous levels of SPARC expression. Importantly, downregulation of SPARC levels in melanoma cells using either an antisense RNA or a shRNA against SPARC sensitized them to hMel-SPARC addition in proliferation and migration assays, suggesting that malignant cells developed a SPARC-resistance mechanism. This was not a general resistance to growth suppressing agents, as melanoma cells with restricted SPARC expression were more resistant to chemotherapeutic agents. Thus, malignant cells expressing or not expressing SPARC developed alternative mechanisms that, in contrary to stromal cells, rendered them SPARC-insensitive.",

Some promise has been shown in treating certain melanomas by targeting activated signaling pathways resulting from specific mutations in proteins, such as BRAF and NRAS. Recently, the identification of embryonic signaling pathways in melanoma has helped us better understand certain biological characteristics, such as cellular heterogeneity and phenotypic plasticity, and has provided novel insight pertinent to diagnosis and therapy. For instance, our studies have shown that the TGF-β family member, Nodal, is expressed in melanoma and is responsible, at least in part, for tumor cell plasticity and aggressiveness. Since the majority of normal adult tissues do not express Nodal, we reason that this embryonic morphogen could be used to identify and target aggressive melanoma cells. We have also identified that molecular cross-talk between the Notch and Nodal pathways may represent a mechanism responsible for the overexpression of Nodal in melanoma. Further exploitation of the relationship between embryonic signaling pathways and cancer pathogenesis could lead to novel approaches for diagnosis and therapy in cancers, such as melanoma.",

Inhibiting mda-9/syntenin, using an adenovirus expressing antisense mda-9/syntenin or addition of c-Src siRNA, suppresses melanoma cell migration, anchorage-independent growth, and spontaneous tumor cell dissemination in vivo in a human melanoma animal metastasis model. These data are compatible with a model wherein interaction of MDA-9/syntenin with c-Src promotes the formation of an active FAK/c-Src signaling complex, leading to enhanced tumor cell invasion and metastatic spread.

Systemic IL-2 treatment has provided significant clinical benefit in a minority of patients with metastatic melanoma, leading to long-term survival in a few cases. We hypothesize that one previously unidentified mechanism of effective IL-2 therapy is through direct upregulation of the tumor suppressor IL-24 in melanoma tumor cells resulting in growth suppression. In this study, five melanoma cell lines were treated with high dose recombinant human IL-2. Three (A375, WM1341, WM793) showed statistically significant increases in IL-24 protein; two (WM35, MeWo) remained negative for IL-24 message and protein. This increase was abolished by preincubating with anti-IL-2 antibody or blocking with antibodies against the IL-2 receptor chains. These IL-2 responsive melanoma cell lines expressed IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ mRNA. The IL-2Rβγ complex was functional, as measured by IL-2-induced signal transducers and activators of transcription activation as well as IL-15 signaling through its shared receptor complex. IL-24 upregulation was observed in response to either IL-2 or IL-15. Cell growth was significantly decreased by treatment of IL-24-positive cells with IL-2 or IL-15, whereas no effect was seen in negative cells. Incubating the IL-24 inducible-cells with anti-IL-24 antibody as well as transfecting with IL-24 small interfering RNA effectively reversed the growth suppression seen with IL-2. Thus, we have shown that one mechanism of clinically effective IL-2 therapy may be the direct action of IL-2 on a biologically distinct subset of melanoma cells leading to upregulation of the tumor suppressor IL-24.",

We immunized C57Bl/6 mice with recombinant GRP78 and then implanted the B16F1 murine melanoma cell line as flank tumors.

Other members of the MAPK family, e.g., extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38, remained unaffected by the hypoxic stimulus. Activated JNK/SAPK could also be observed in the vicinity of hypoxic tumor areas in melanoma metastases as detected by immunohistochemistry. Functional analysis of JNK/SAPK activation in the melanoma cell line 530 revealed that activation of JNK/SAPK is involved in hypoxia-mediated tumor cell apoptosis. Both a dominant negative mutant of JNK/SAPK (SAPKbeta K-->R) and a dominant negative mutant of the immediate upstream activator of JNK/SAPK, SEK1 (SEK1 K-->R), inhibited hypoxia-induced apoptosis in transient transfection studies. In contrast, overexpression of the wild-type kinases had a slight proapoptotic effect. Inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38 pathways by the chemical inhibitors PD98058 and SB203580, respectively, had no effect on hypoxiainduced apoptosis. Under normoxic conditions, no influence on apoptosis regulation was observed after inhibition of all three MAPK pathways. In contrast to recent findings, JNK/SAPK activation did not correlate with Fas or Fas ligand (FasL) expression, suggesting that the Fas/FasL system is not involved in hypoxia-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells. Taken together, our data demonstrate that hypoxia-induced JNK/SAPK activation appears to play a critical role in apoptosis regulation of melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo, independent of the Fas/FasL system.",

This enigma is most evident in partially regressing melanomas, where efficient eradication of tumor cells is closely linked to uncontrolled tumor growth. Mechanisms involved in this differential susceptibility of tumor cells to the host immune response may include altered production of immunosuppressive cytokines, i.e., transforming growth factor (TGF) beta or interleukin (IL) 10. Since only limited amounts of tissue samples are available from primary tumors, a semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was established which allowed to estimate the amount of cytokine mRNA expressed in a small number of melanoma cells segregated by indirect immunomagnetic isolation. Thereby, we determined the expression of TGF-beta 1 and IL-10 mRNA in melanoma cells obtained from regressing and progressing areas of 9 primary tumors. TGF-beta 1 mRNA could be detected in all undiluted samples from progressing areas and in 7 samples from regression zones. Titration of the sample revealed that in 6 cases TGF-beta 1 mRNA could be detected at a significant higher titer in progressing than in regressing areas. IL-10 mRNA was present in 8 samples obtained from progressing and in 7 samples from regressing tumor areas. In 6 tumors IL-10 mRNA was detectable at a higher titer in the progression zones. Specificity of the PCR amplification was confirmed with a series of restriction enzyme digestions of the resulting PCR product. Based on these findings the hypothesis that immunosuppressive cytokines, such as TGF-beta 1 or IL-10, represent important factors for the melanoma cells to escape immune surveillance is supported.",

CTLA-4 is expressed on naïve T cells and regulatory T cells. Ipilimumab, an anti-CTLA-4 antibody, shows a distinct durable clinical benefit by inhibiting the immunosuppressive function of CTLA-4. PD-1, which is expressed on activated T cells, inhibits T cell responses against tumor cells. The antibodies against PD-1, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, produce anti-tumor responses in melanoma and other cancers due to T cell reactivation. Furthermore, clinical trials of combination therapies using immune checkpoint blockades with molecularly targeted therapies and other chemotherapeutic agents are being conducted.

HDM2 overexpression, defined as >20% tumor cells showing nuclear immunoreactivity, was observed in 1 of 16 (6%) dysplastic nevi, 3 of 11 (27%) melanomas in situ, and 81 of 145 (56%) invasive primary and metastatic melanomas. Comparable frequencies of HDM2 overexpression were observed among invasive primary cases with differing tumor thicknesses as well as among the metastatic cases: 21 of 40 (53%) at < or =1.5 mm; 31 of 50 (62%) at 1.6-3.9 mm; 10 of 17 (58%) at >4 mm; and 19 of 38 (50%) metastases.

Melanoma cell lines expressed HDM2 protein, but there was no evidence of amplification by SB. Our data suggest that HDM2 protein overexpression is common in invasive and metastatic melanoma.

Targeting Maml1 in melanoma cells efficiently knocks down the downstream transcriptional repressors Hey1 and Hes1, resulting in melanoma cell senescence, cellular differentiation, and increased melanin production. Significantly, higher IFNβ and chemokine gene transcripts have been observed, together with increased STAT1 and decreased STAT3 and NF-κB signaling activities. Although decreased cell proliferation contributes to slower tumor growth in vivo, the depletion of NK and CD8(+) T cells in an shMaml1-B16 tumor carrier mouse leads to more rapid tumor growth than that observed in control shC002-B16 tumors. This result demonstrates that the knockdown of Maml1 transcription and function contributes to increased immune surveillance. The knockdown of Maml1 transcription in the human melanoma cell line M537 also results in senescence, IFNβ upregulation, increased chemokine gene expression, and greater NK and CD8(+) T cell migration in a transwell system.

Here, we studied whether the glycocalyx is required for melanoma cell migration. We diminished the glycocalyx of human melanoma cells by inhibiting posttranslational N-glycosylation or by enzymatic digestion of the N-glycosides. This partial destruction of the glycocalyx reduced melanoma cell migration by up to 60%. It was accompanied by the disintegration of a characteristic pH nanoenvironment typically surrounding migrating cells. Restoring this pH profile by stimulating the activity of the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger NHE1 rescued cell migration even in the absence of an intact glycocalyx. The effects of partially removing the glycocalyx compared to those of knocking down beta(1)-integrin expression points to a close functional correlation between glycocalyx, integrins, and cell surface pH nanoenvironment. We conclude that the glycocalyx is required for tumor cell migration.

Until now, many immunotherapeutic investigations have focused on improving the effector side of the antitumor response, but only a few studies have been concerned with preventing the loss of tumor-associated antigen (TAA) expression. Loss of TAA should be an important problem for the recognition of tumor cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. If any agents that augment the expression of melanoma antigens were found, they could improve the efficacy of immunotherapy by increasing the antigens. To detect effective chemicals, we made a fluorescent cellular reporter system for screening promising candidate chemicals. In this system, the fusion gene of the Melan-A/MART-1 promoter sequence followed by the green fluorescent protein (GFP) coding region was stably transfected into MUX human melanoma cells which are known to express little or no Melan-A/MART-1. Melan-A/MART-1 is a well-known melanoma antigen recognized by autologous cytotoxic T cells, and is a glycoprotein associated with the melanosome, the organelle in which melanin synthesis proceeds. By using this screening system, daunorubicin, doxorubicin and cytochalasin D, which enhanced the green fluorescent, were selected and then were confirmed to actually increase the expression of Melan-A/MART-1 mRNA and protein in human melanoma cells of MU89, MM96L(+) and SK-MEL-28, but also in low-antigen presenting cells such as MM96L(-), MUX, and A375. In conclusion, we have successfully established a well-functioning screening system, which will allow us to find candidate chemicals that up-regulate or maintain the melanoma antigen expression.",

However, their participation in tumor cell evasion is still not completely understood. Here we demonstrate that several human melanomas (cell lines and freshly isolated metastases) do not express MICA on the cell surface but have intracellular deposits of this NKG2DL. Susceptibility to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity correlated with the ratio of NKG2DLs to HLA class I molecules but not with the amounts of MICA on the cell surface of tumor cells. Transfection-mediated overexpression of MICA restored cell surface expression and resulted in an increased in vitro cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma secretion by human NK cells. In xenografted nude mice, these melanomas exhibited a delayed growth and extensive in vivo apoptosis. Retardation of tumor growth was due to NK cell-mediated antitumor activity against MICA-transfected tumors, given that this effect was not observed in NK cell-depleted mice. Also, mouse NK cells killed MICA-overexpressing melanomas in vitro. A mechanistic analysis revealed the retention of MICA in the endoplasmic reticulum, an effect that was associated with accumulation of endoH-sensitive (immature) forms of MICA, retrograde transport to the cytoplasm, and degradation by the proteasome. Our study identifies a novel strategy developed by melanoma cells to evade NK cell-mediated immune surveillance based on the intracellular sequestration of immature forms of MICA in the endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, this tumor immune escape strategy can be overcome by gene therapy approaches aimed at overexpressing MICA on tumor cells.",

Following this observation, we have tried to establish whether there is a direct relationship between differentiation and c-met expression in B16 melanoma cells. Treatment of these cells with differentiating agents indicated that c-met expression was strongly induced by melanocyte stimulating hormone, while retinoic acid had almost no influence. c-met induction was triggered by engagement of the melanocortin receptor, cAMP elevation and PKA/PKC(&agr;) activation, as respectively shown by the effects of ACTH, cAMP elevating agents and specific PK inhibitors. Regulation of c-met expression via the melanocortin receptor and cAMP raises the intriguing possibility that autocrine and/or paracrine mechanisms acting in vivo on this circuit might influence (through c-met expression and activation) the metastatic behavior of these tumor cells, which we have shown to be dependent on their c-met expression.",

Interleukin-18 has been shown to have similar bioactivities to interleukin-12 and to have antitumor efficacy in experimental models. In this study, we investigated whether the introduction of the interleukin-18 gene to B16F10 melanoma cells can induce antitumor response or not. Before the transfection, we modified the interleukin-18 gene to enable transfected tumor cells to secrete bioactive interleukin-18, because interleukin-18 does not have a signal sequence and requires processing by the interleukin-1 converting enzyme to attain the mature form. We found that B16 melanoma cells transduced with hybrid cDNA consisting of the interferon-beta signal sequence and mature interleukin-18 sequence, but not native interleukin-18, secreted a large amount of interleukin-18 and exhibited retarded tumor growth when injected in syngeneic mice. The antitumor effect was mostly abrogated by administration of anti-interferon-gamma antibody, but was not affected by in vivo depletion of CD8+ T cells or natural killer cells. Histologic analysis revealed that vascularization was markedly reduced and that necrosis was extensively induced in interleukin-18-secreting B16F10 melanoma (B16/IL18) tissues, whereas abundant tumor vessel formation was observed in B16/IL18 tissues of interferon-gamma-neutralized mice. We also found that chemokines, interferon-inducible protein-10 and monokine induced by interferon-gamma, were produced in B16/IL18 tissues and that the expression of both chemokines was dependent on that of interferon-gamma in the tumor tissues. Further, we showed that B16 melanoma cells secreted both chemokines in response to interferon-gamma. In addition, the expression of angiogenin, an angiogenic factor of melanoma, in B16 melanoma cells was reduced by interferon-gamma treatment. These results indicate that gene transfer of secreted-type interleukin-18 to B16F10 melanoma cells is a useful method of triggering an antitumor response without any systemic adverse effects and that the antitumor efficacy is mainly mediated by antiangiogenic activity, which is possibly involved in at least two dynamic changes induced by interferon-gamma inside B16 melanoma cells: the upregulation of antiangiogenic chemokines, interferon-inducible protein-10 and monokine induced by interferon-gamma, and the downregulation of angiogenic factor, angiogenin.",

During the last decade, the presence of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) recognising melanoma-associated antigens has been unequivocally demonstrated in numerous different in vivo and in vitro models. However, most often these melanoma-specific T lymphocytes do not control tumor growth. Several mechanisms that involve changes in melanoma phenotype and/or in T-cell differentiation and function could explain the inability of the immune response to control melanoma. In the last few years it has been demonstrated that cellular cytotoxicity is the result of a balance between activating signals triggered by the TCR and costimulatory molecules and inhibitory signals triggered by inhibitory receptors expressed by the CTL. Because the final outcome of the immune response against melanoma depends on the balance between activating and inhibitory signals, the expression de novo on melanoma cells of ligands for inhibitory NKRs and the down-regulation of costimulatory molecules may favor the escape of tumor cells from immunosurveillance. In this paper we review how altered expression of molecules required for T-cell costimulation could result in impaired lysis of melanoma. The modulation of antimelanoma T-cell responses by a group of receptors originally described on NK cells (NK-associated receptors) but which are now known also to be expressed on a subset of cytolytic effector cells is reviewed. We hypothesize that the expression of ligands for NKRs on melanoma cells may contribute to T-cell-mediated immune responses against melanoma either enhancing or inhibiting activation and differentiation to effector cells. Blocking inhibitory receptors or increasing activating receptors could result in new strategies to improve T-cell-mediated rejection of melanoma.",

In the present study, we applied the technique to comparative studies on common glycoproteins present in the matched patient primary and metastatic melanoma cell lines. Metastatic melanoma cells (WM266-4) contained a large amount of polyLacNAc-type N-glycans in comparison with primary melanoma cells (WM115). To identify the glycoproteins expressing these N-glycans, glycopeptides having polyLacNAc-type N-glycans were captured by a Datura stramonium agglutinin (DSA)-immobilized agarose column. The captured glycopeptides were analyzed by LC/MS after removing N-glycans, and some glycoproteins such as basigin, lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 (LAMP-1), and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) were identified in both WM115 and WM266-4 cells. The expression level of polyLacNAc of CSPG4 in WM266-4 cells was significantly higher than that in WM115 cells. In addition, sulfation patterns of chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains in CSPG4 showed dramatic changes between these cell lines.

In fluorescence mode, B16 melanoma cells appeared as dark objects in the bright background of the GFP expressing murine cells of the C57BL/6 transgenic mouse, and the B16-EGFP melanoma cells had a bright signal within a dark background in C57BL/6 mice. In the C57BL/6 transgenic mouse, a population of fluorescent dendritic cells was observed in the vicinity of the tumor cells. The reflectance images provide a useful reference for those areas in the dermal tissues lacking a fluorescent signal.

Genetic instability and mutations of putative melanoma susceptibility genes are key factors involved in increased melanoma risk. The identification of the responsible loci and genes by karyotyping and genetic linkage analysis of tumors, affected individuals, and their families will allow further insight into molecular mechanisms of melanoma development. One susceptibility gene is located on chromosome 9p21. Changes in adhesiveness and cell motility are important for tumor progression and may even represent prime factors determining aggressiveness and metastatic potential. In melanoma, several adhesion receptors of the integrin family (eg, alpha V beta 3, alpha 4 beta 1, alpha 2 beta 1) and the CD44 receptor are potentially relevant in this process. Several mechanisms appear to be involved in the escape of melanoma from immunologic control, 1) downregulation of surface-expressed major histocompatibility complex class I molecules and the failure of tumor cells to process endogenously synthesized proteins for antigen presentation, 2) inhibition of the interaction of cytotoxic T cells with melanoma cells, eg, by soluble adhesion molecules (intercellular adhesion molecule 1), and 3) induction and maintenance of clonal anergy in tumor cell-specific T cells.",

This is followed by angiogenesis, the sprouting of new vessels from preexisting vasculature, to yield a more refined microcirculation. However, we and our collaborators have recently described a process termed \"vasculogenic mimicry,\" which consists of the formation of patterned, tubular networks by aggressive melanoma tumor cells (in three-dimensional cultures in vitro), that mimics endothelial-formed vasculogenic networks and correlates with poor clinical prognosis in patients. Previous microarray analysis from our laboratory comparing the highly aggressive versus the poorly aggressive melanoma cells revealed a significant increased expression of tyrosine kinases associated with the aggressive melanoma phenotype. Because of the important role of protein tyrosine kinases in phosphorylating various signal transduction proteins that are critical for many cellular processes (e.g., cell adhesion, migration, and invasion), we examined whether protein tyrosine kinases are involved in melanoma vasculogenic mimicry. Immunofluorescence analysis of aggressive melanoma cells forming tubular networks in vitro showed that tyrosine phosphorylation activity colocalized specifically within areas of tubular network formation. A phosphotyrosine profile of the aggressive melanoma cells capable of forming tubular networks indicated differences in tyrosine phosphorylated proteins compared with the poorly aggressive melanoma cells (incapable of forming tubular networks). Most notably, we identified epithelial cell kinase (EphA2) as being one receptor tyrosine kinase expressed and phosphorylated exclusively in the aggressive metastatic melanoma cells. Furthermore, general inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinases hindered tube formation, and transient knockout of EphA2 abrogated the ability of tumor cells to form tubular structures. These results suggest that protein tyrosine kinases, particularly EphA2, are involved in the formation of tubular networks by aggressive melanoma tumor cells in vitro, which may represent a novel therapeutic target for further clinical investigation.",

Slight to moderate growth inhibition produced by the compounds was associated with a stimulation of melanogenesis, as reflected by a striking enhancement of tyrosinase (EC 1.10.3.1) activity and an increase in cellular melanin content. Both antimetabolites acted synergistically with alpha-melanotropin (MSH), as regards the stimulation of melanogenesis. Exposure of the melanoma cells to MSH resulted in most experiments in a marked decrease of the intracellular polyamine pools, usually involving all three polyamines (putrescine, spermidine and spermine). The DFMO-induced stimulation of melanogenesis was totally suppressed by the administration of putrescine, whereas the MSH-stimulated tyrosinase activity was not influenced by the diamine. Although many recent reports indicate that terminal differentiation is accompanied by a distinct stimulation of polyamine biosynthesis, our results suggest that in certain cells polyamine deprivation may lead to an enhanced expression of differentiated phenotype.",

We assessed the prognostic significance of MGSA expression in 37 primary MM immunostained for MGSA. Immunostains were graded for intensity (0-3+), percentage of cells immunostained, and location of immunostain (intraepidermal, junctional, or dermal). In addition, 31 melanocytic and 23 dysplastic nevi were similarly studied for MGSA expression. All MM showed the presence of immunostain, 6 (16%) 1+, 12 (32%) 2+, and 19 (51%) 3+. Six (16%) had immunostain in < or = 50% tumor cells, 31 (84%) in >50%. A significant number of MM showed >50% tumor cells staining at the dermal-epidermal junction compared with intraepidermal staining (P <.0001). Intensity and amount of immunostain did not correlate with Clark's or Breslow's level. During a mean follow-up of 60 months (range: 5-101) on 27 patients, there were 4 local recurrences, 6 distant metastases, and 10 deaths. MGSA expression was not of prognostic significance with regard to survival (overall, disease free), or local recurrence or distant metastasis in primary MM. MGSA expression was similar in benign melanocytic and dysplastic nevi. Strong diffuse expression was noted in the junctional component of all junctional and most compound nevi. The dermal component consistently expressed less or no (in 45% of intradermal nevi) MGSA. MGSA expression does not correlate with prognosis in MM. Increased expression of MGSA at the dermal-epidermal junction in nevi and MM may indicate a role for MGSA in early local growth, before development of atypia.",

Improved understanding of the significance of ML-IAP immune responses in patients has possible therapeutic applications. We found ML-IAP frequently expressed in melanoma metastases by immunohistochemistry. To assess spontaneous immunity to ML-IAP, an overlapping peptide library representing full-length protein was utilized to screen cellular responses in stage I-IV patients and healthy controls by ELISPOT. A broad array of CD4(+) and CD8(+) cellular responses against ML-IAP was observed with novel class I and class II epitopes identified. Specific HLA-A*0201 epitopes were analyzed further for frequency of reactivity. The generation of specific CD4(+) and cytotoxic T cells revealed potent functional capability including cytokine responsiveness to melanoma cell lines and tumor cell killing. In addition, recombinant ML-IAP protein used in an ELISA demonstrated high titer antibody responses in a subset of patients. Several melanoma patients who received CTLA-4 blockade with ipilimumab developed augmented humoral immune responses to ML-IAP as a function of treatment which was associated with beneficial clinical outcomes. High frequency immune responses in melanoma patients, associations with favorable treatment outcomes, and its essential role in melanoma pathogenesis support the development of ML-IAP as a disease marker and therapeutic target.",

While interferon-regulated genes encoding proteins have been intensively studied since decades, the contribution of miRNAs to effects mediated by interferons is an emerging area of research.We recently described a distinct and dynamic regulation of a whole panel of microRNAs (miRNAs) after  IFN-γ-stimulation. The aim of this study was to analyze the transcriptional regulation of miR-29 family members  in detail, identify potential interesting target genes and thus further elucidate a potential signaling pathway  IFN-γ → Jak→ P-STAT1 → miR-29 → miR-29 target genes and its implication for melanoma growth.;Here we show that IFN-γ induces STAT1-dependently a profound up-regulation of the miR-29 primary cluster pri-29a~b-1 in melanoma cell lines. Furthermore, expression levels of pri-29a~b-1 and mature miR-29a and miR-29b were elevated while the pri-29b-2~c cluster was almost undetectable. We observed an inverse correlation between miR-29a/b expression and the proliferation rate of various melanoma cell lines. This finding could be corroborated in cells transfected with either miR-29 mimics or inhibitors. The IFN-γ-induced G1-arrest of melanoma cells involves down-regulation of CDK6, which we proved to be a direct target of miR-29 in these cells. Compared to nevi and normal skin, and metastatic melanoma samples, miR-29a and miR-29b levels were found strikingly elevated in certain patient samples derived from primary melanoma.;Our findings reveal that the miR-29a/b1 cluster is to be included in the group of IFN- and STAT-regulated genes.

In this study, IT9302, a nanomeric peptide (AYMTMKIRN), homologous to the C-terminal of the human IL-10 sequence, was demonstrated to mimic these previously described IL-10 effects on MHC class I-related molecules and functions. We observed a dose-dependent down-regulation of MHC class I at the cell surface of melanoma cells after 24-h treatment with IT9302. The IL-10 homologue peptide also caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the IFN-gamma-mediated surface induction of MHC class I in a melanoma cell line. We demonstrated, using Western blot and flow cytometry, that IT9302 inhibits the expression of TAP1 and TAP2 proteins, but not MHC class I H chain or low molecular protein molecules. Finally, peptide-treated melanoma cells were shown to be more sensitive to lysis by NK cells in a dose-dependent way.

However, the kinetics of this activation largely depended on the tumorigenicity of the cell line used. One week after inoculation with a poorly tumorigenic cell line (PTCL), peritoneal macrophages showed a maximal tumoricidal activity, which then slowly declined to disappear on the 4th week. Macrophages obtained after inoculation of a highly tumorigenic cell line (HTCL) were also activated, but the level of their tumoricidal activity was somewhat lower and decreased more rapidly. Irradiated melanoma cells were also able to activate peritoneal macrophages. The inoculation of a higher number of melanoma cells (less than or equal to 8 X 10(7) cells) resulted in a parallel increase in the cytotoxicity of peritoneal macrophages when activated by PTCL and in a parallel decrease when activated by HTCL. Activated macrophages taken 1 week after tumor cell inoculation and further kept in vitro without additional stimulation progressively lost their tumoricidal activity, within 48 hours after being harvested from PTCL-inoculated mice and within 24 hours after being collected from HTCL-inoculated animals. These data allied to the in vivo capacity of peritoneal cells rich in activated macrophages to prevent the growth of HTCL in nude mice strongly leaned toward the idea that macrophages are involved in the tumor growth control in the absence of a specific immune response.

        "Doc_abstract":"Malignant melanoma is a highly metastatic cancer that bears responsibility for the majority of skin cancer-related deaths. Amidst the research efforts to better understand melanoma progression, there has been increasing evidence that hints at a role for a subpopulation of virulent cancer cells, termed malignant melanoma stem or initiating cells (MMICs), in metastasis formation. MMICs are characterized by their preferential ability to initiate and propagate tumor growth and their selective capacity for self-renewal and differentiation into less tumorigenic melanoma cells. The frequency of MMICs has been shown to correlate with poor clinical prognosis in melanoma. In addition, MMICs are enriched among circulating tumor cells in the peripheral blood of cancer patients, suggesting that MMICs may be a critical factor in the metastatic cascade. Although these links exist between MMICs and metastatic disease, the mechanisms by which MMICs may advance metastatic progression are only beginning to be elucidated. Recent studies have shown that MMICs express molecules critical for hematopoietic cell maintenance and trafficking, providing a possible explanation for how circulating MMICs could drive melanoma dissemination. We therefore propose that MMICs might fuel melanoma metastasis by exploiting homing mechanisms commonly utilized by hematopoietic cells. Here we review the biological properties of MMICs and the existing literature on their metastatic potential. We will discuss possible mechanisms by which MMICs might initiate metastases in the context of established knowledge of cancer stem cells in other cancers and of hematopoietic homing molecules, with a particular focus on selectins, integrins, chemokines and chemokine receptors known to be expressed by melanoma cells. Biological understanding of how these molecules might be utilized by MMICs to propel the metastatic cascade could critically impact the development of more effective therapies for advanced disease.

Dicer, a type III endoribonuclease, is a critical component in microRNA biogenesis and is required for mature microRNA production. Abnormal Dicer expression occurs in numerous cancer types and correlates with poor patient prognosis. For example, increased Dicer expression in melanoma is associated with more aggressive tumors (higher tumor mitotic index and depth of invasion) and poor patient prognosis. However, the role that Dicer plays in melanoma development and immune evasion remains unclear. Here, we report on a newly discovered relationship between Dicer expression and tumor immunogenicity. To investigate Dicer's role in regulating melanoma immunogenicity, Dicer knockdown studies were performed. We found that B16F0-Dicer deficient cells exhibited decreased tumor growth compared to control cells and were capable of inducing anti-tumor immunity. The decrease in tumor growth was abrogated in immunodeficient NSG mice and was shown to be dependent upon CD8+ T cells. Dicer knockdown also induced a more responsive immune gene profile in melanoma cells. Further studies demonstrated that CD8+ T cells preferentially killed Dicer knockdown tumor cells compared to control cells. Taken together, we present evidence which links Dicer expression to tumor immunogenicity in melanoma.",

To evaluate this possibility, we examined the effect of treatment with a melanoma vaccine on the number of melanoma cells present in the circulation. PCR was used to detect melanoma cells that expressed the melanoma-associated antigens MART-1, MAGE-3, tyrosinase and/or gp100 in 91 patients with melanoma. Melanoma cells that expressed one or more of these markers were present more often in advanced disease, i.e. in 80% of patients with advanced stage IV compared to in less than one-third of patients with less advanced disease. We then measured circulating melanoma cells in a subset of 43 of these patients who were treated with a polyvalent, shed antigen, melanoma vaccine. The vaccine contains multiple melanoma-associated antigens including MART-1, MAGE-3, tyrosinase and gp100. Immunizations were given intradermally q2-3 weeks x4 and then monthly x3. Prior to vaccine treatment, circulating melanoma cells were detected in 14 (32%) patients. Following 4 and 7 months of vaccine treatment, melanoma cells that expressed any of these markers were present in only nine (21%) and three (7%) of patients, respectively. Thus, vaccine therapy was associated with clearance of melanoma cells from the circulation in 78% of initially positive patients. As the number of these cells declined steadily with increasing length of therapy, it is unlikely that this was due to a random change in their number. Rather it suggests that the decline was a result of the therapy. These observations suggest that the presence of melanoma cells in the circulation is related to the extent of the melanoma, and that their disappearance may provide an early marker of the efficacy of therapy. However, the practical utility of assaying circulating tumor cells as a guide to the effectiveness of therapy or of prognosis will need to be confirmed by correlations with clinical outcome.",

Indeed, we found that DMF inhibited proliferation of human melanoma cells A375 and M24met in vitro. The cell cycle was arrested at the G(2)-M boundary. Moreover, DMF was proapoptotic, as shown by cell cycle analysis and by Annexin V and Apo2.7 staining. These results were confirmed in vivo. DMF reduced proliferation rates of tumor cells as assessed by Ki-67 immunostaining and increased apoptosis as assessed by terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining.

Melanoma tumor cells often express inflammatory mediators through enhanced activation of NF-kappaB. The NF-kappaB activation appears to result from the enhancer formation including NF-kappaB and lysine acetyl transferases such as p300, CREB (cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein)-binding protein (CBP), and/or p300/CBP associating factor (PCAF). We observed that proteins expressed by Hs294T metastatic melanoma cells are highly acetylated compared with normal melanocytes, and dominant-negative PCAF reduced the basal and tumor necrosis factor-alpha-stimulated transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB. The promoter activity of NF-kappaB-regulated chemokines was also reduced by the expression of dominant-negative PCAF. The promoters of these chemokines contain a CCAAT displacement protein (CDP)-binding site near the NF-kappaB element. compared with vector-transduced cells, in CDP-transduced Hs294T cells: (i) over-expressed CDP bound efficiently to PCAF, (ii) tumor necrosis factor-alpha-stimulated chemokine expression and NF-kappaB-mediated transcription were reduced, and (iii) the binding of CBP to Rel A was reduced. These data suggest that CDP inhibits cytokine-induced NF-kappaB-regulated chemokine transcription. This study contributes to our understanding of the role of CDP in an enhanceosome of NF-kappaB-mediated chemokine transcription in human melanoma cells.",

In this study, we investigated the effect of hypoxia on the expression and channel activity of connexin 43 (Cx43) in melanoma cells and its impact on their susceptibility to NK cell-mediated lysis. Our results demonstrated that hypoxic stress increases Cx43 expression in melanoma cells via hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) transcriptional activity. Hypoxic cells displaying increased Cx43 expression were less susceptible to NK cell-mediated lysis compared with normoxic cells expressing a moderate level of Cx43. Conversely, when overexpressed in normoxic tumor cells, Cx43 improves their susceptibility to N cell-mediated killing. We show that the NK cell immune synapse formed with normoxic melanoma cells is more stable and contains a high level of gap-junctional Cx43 whereas that formed with hypoxic cells is less stable and contains a significant lower level of gap-junctional Cx43. We provide evidence that the activation of autophagy in hypoxic melanoma cells selectively degrades gap-junctional Cx43, leading to the destabilization of the immune synapse and the impairment of NK cell-mediated killing. Inhibition of autophagy by genetic or pharmacological approaches as well as expression of the non-degradable form of Cx43 significantly restore its accumulation at the immune synapse and improves N cell-mediated lysis of hypoxic melanoma cells. This study provides the first evidence that the hypoxic microenvironment negatively affects the immune surveillance of tumors by NK cells through the modulation of Cx43-mediated intercellular communications.

We also estimated the expression of ICAM-1 and regressive changes in malignant melanoma metastases, correlating the duration of treatment to these effects of IFN-alpha. Twenty-three IFN-alpha-treated and 10 untreated patients with regional metastatic malignant melanoma were studied. The duration of IFN-alpha treatment influenced the expression of ICAM-1.

Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) plays a pivotal role in integrating growth factor and adhesion-related signaling pathways, facilitating cell spreading and migration. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 and 2, implicated in tumor growth and survival, has also been linked to clinical melanoma progression. We have cloned the MCSP core protein and expressed it in the MCSP-negative melanoma cell line WM1552C. Expression of MCSP enhances integrin-mediated cell spreading, FAK phosphorylation, and activation of ERK1/2. MCSP transfectants exhibit extensive MCSP-rich microspikes on adherent cells, where it also colocalizes with alpha4 integrin. Enhanced activation of FAK and ERK1/2 by MCSP appears to involve independent mechanisms because inhibition of FAK activation had no effect on ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These results indicate that MCSP may facilitate primary melanoma progression by enhancing the activation of key signaling pathways important for tumor invasion and growth.",

Its targeting has anti-tumor effectiveness, which can also be obtained by RNA interference. The aim of our study was to explore the anti-tumor effectiveness of endoglin silencing by electrotransfer of plasmid DNA encoding short hairpin RNA against endoglin in two murine B16 melanoma variants with different metastatic potential on cells, spheroids and subcutaneous tumors in mice. The results demonstrate that endoglin silencing with gene electrotransfer reduces the proliferation, survival and migration of melanoma cells and also has anti-tumor effectiveness, as the therapy resulted in a high percentage of tumor cures (23% and 58% on B16F1 and B16F10 tumors, respectively). The effectiveness of the therapy correlated with endoglin expression in melanoma cells; in vitro the effects were more pronounced in B16F1 cells, which express more endoglin than B16F10. However, the opposite was observed in vivo in tumors, where there was a higher expression of endoglin and better anti-tumor effectiveness in the B16F10 tumor. In conclusion, targeting endoglin for the treatment of melanoma seems to be a concept worthy of further exploration due to the increased therapeutic effect of the therapy based on simultaneous vascular targeting and its direct effect on tumor cells.

Although the frequencies of CD20+ melanoma cells within the tumor lesions were initially about 2% and the bulk of tumor cells did not express CD20, rituximab treatment produced lasting remission of treated tumor lesions in the long-term.

These antitumor CD8+ T cells recognize peptide antigens presented on the surface of tumor cells by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. The MHC class I molecule is a heterodimer composed of an integral membrane glycoprotein designated the alpha chain and a noncovalently associated, soluble protein called beta2-microglobulin (beta 2m). Loss of beta 2m generally eliminates antigen recognition by antitumor CD8+ T cells.;We studied the loss of beta 2m as a potential means of tumor escape from immune recognition in a cohort of patients receiving immunotherapy.;We successfully grew 13 independent tumor cell cultures from tumor specimens obtained from 13 patients in a cohort of 40 consecutive patients undergoing immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma and for whom tumor specimens were available. These cell lines, as well as another melanoma cell line (called 1074mel) that had been derived from tumor obtained from a patient in a cytokine-gene therapy study, were characterized in vitro cytofluorometrically for MHC class I expression and by northern and western blot analyses for messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression, respectively, and ex vivo by immunohistochemistry.;After one melanoma cell line (1074mel) was found not to express functional beta 2m by cytofluorometric analysis, four (31%) of the 13 newly established melanoma cell lines were found to have an absolute lack of functional MHC class I expression. Northern blot analysis of RNA extracted from the five cell lines exhibiting no functional MHC class I expression showed that these cells contained normal levels of alpha-chain mRNA but variable levels of beta 2m mRNA. In addition, no immunoreactive beta 2m protein was detected by western blot analysis. When human beta 2m was transiently expressed with the use of a recombinant vaccinia virus, cell-surface MHC class I expression was reconstituted and the ability of these five cell lines to present endogenous antigens was restored. Immunohistochemical staining of tumor sections revealed a lack of immunoreactive MHC class I in vivo, supporting the notion that the in vitro observations were not artifactual. Furthermore, archival tumor sections obtained from patients prior to immunotherapy were available from three patients and were found to be beta 2m positive. This result was consistent with the hypothesis that loss of beta 2m resulted from immunotherapy.;These data suggest that the loss of beta 2m may be a mechanism whereby tumor cells can acquire immunoresistance.

PVAE reduced PMA-induced activation of MMP-9 and further inhibited cell invasion and migration. PVAE suppressed PMA-enhanced expression of MMP-9 protein, mRNA and transcription activity levels through suppression of NF-kappaB activation without changing the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase level. PVAE inhibited PMA-induced NF-kappaB nuclear translocation, which is upstream of PMA-induced MMP-9 expression and invasion. Furthermore, pretreatment with NF-kappaB activation inhibitor inhibited the PMA-induced MMP-9 expression and activity.

We further demonstrate a decrease of EphA2 both in expression and activity at 7 d after irradiation paralleled by an upregulation of EphA3. Analyzing downstream signaling after irradiation, we detected decreased Src kinase phosphorylation, but unchanged focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation, indicating, in part, irradiation-induced downregulation of signaling via the EphA2-Src-FAK axis in melanoma cells.

To test this, we performed multiparametric (11-color and 6-color) fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses to monitor phenotypic and functional property of CD4 T cells in response to melanoma cell antigen reexposure.

Human melanoma cells may escape immune recognition by a variety of means, including global or allelic down-regulation of MHC class I molecules. Stable MHC class I cell surface expression requires delivery of cytosolic peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum by the peptide transporter molecules TAP1 and TAP2, with peptides subsequently transported to the cell surface in complexes containing MHC class I heavy chain and beta2-microglobulin. We have evaluated a series of mechanisms resulting in MHC class I down-regulation in a human melanoma cell line, Mz18, typed as HLA-A2(+), A3(+), B7(+), B57(+), Cw1(+), and Cw6(+) by genomic PCR analysis. The melanoma cell line Mz18 exhibits a global down-regulation of MHC class I heavy chain transcripts; beta2-microglobulin; the proteasome subunits LMP2/7, involved in generating cytosolic peptide fragments; and the peptide transporter molecules TAP1 and TAP2, involved in peptide transport from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum. IFN-gamma treatment of Mz18 melanoma cells leads to up-regulation of LMP2/7 and TAP1/2, as well as to up-regulation of HLA-B and HLA-C MHC loci alleles, but not HLA-A2 or HLA-A3. Karyotypic analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization with chromosome 6 and MHC class I-specific probes showed complex rearrangement of one chromosome 6 involving the MHC class I locus on 6p and translocation of 6q to the long arm of chromosome 19. To evaluate the capability of melanoma Mz18 to present tumor-specific peptides to HLA-A2-restricted, melanoma-specific CTLs, we restored HLA-A2 surface expression by retroviral-mediated transfer of functional HLA-A2 cDNA. Melanoma peptides could only be presented and recognized by CTLs if the HLA-A2-transfected Mz18 cell line was first treated with IFN-gamma, thereby restoring LMP2/7 and TAP1/2 expression and function. Because several melanoma antigens recognized by T cells have been reported to be presented by HLA-A2 (MART-1/Melan-A, tyrosinase, gp100, and MAGE-3), the loss of HLA-A2 molecules may represent an important mechanism by which many melanomas evade immune recognition. These findings suggest that patients entering clinical trials for immunotherapy with melanoma vaccines should be carefully examined for tumor cell allelic MHC class I loss and whether such MHC class I antigen down-regulation can be restored by cytokines.",

Tumor cells obtain oxygen and nutriment through VM channels in the early, rapid-growth stage when blood vessels are insufficient. VM channels are characterized by tubular structures with tumor cells. Autophagy is a catabolic process, by which the cell digests damaged components or organelles of its own cytoplasm in response to nutrient deprivation, hypoxia, and the presence of non-functional protein aggregates. In fact, autophagy plays an important role in normal cell growth, development, and homeostasis. However, it is still controversial whether autophagy is also involved in cell death or cell survival in malignancy. In the present study, we therefore investigated the expression levels of two autophagy-related proteins, microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain 3 (LC3) and beclin-1, with respect to melanoma metastasis and vasculogenic mimicry. Melanoma is characterized by rapid growth, high-metastasis rate, and unpredictable behavior. A total of 70 human melanoma tissues were analyzed, showing that VM was present in 31 melanoma specimens (44.3%). Melanoma cells displayed high levels of autophagy when VM was present. Real-time quantitative PCR and immunohistochemical analyses showed that the expression levels of beclin-1 and LC3 mRNAs and proteins were both higher in the VM-positive melanoma than those in the VM-negative melanoma (p<0.05). Moreover, the expression of LC3, rather than beclin-1, was strongly associated with metastasis and poor clinical prognosis of human melanoma. Therefore, the enhanced autophagic activity may be related to VM and metastasis of melanoma.",

Concerning these similarities, we investigated the function of cytokine-suppressive anti-inflammatory drugs (CSAIDs), which act via inhibition of stress-activated MAP-kinases, in regulation of expression of proteolytic enzymes and in vitro invasion of malignant melanoma cells. The p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 reduced matrigel invasion of MeWo cells by 60%, while the MEK-1 inhibitor PD98059 did not have any effect on invasion. Active p38MAPK was detected in MeWo cells by immunoblotting and confocal microscopy. Cells showed a constitutive expression of matrix-metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 as well as tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2 mRNAs. Expression of MMP-1 or urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) was not detected by Northern blot. Inhibition of p38MAPK by the specific inhibitor SB203580 resulted in downregulation of MMP-2 mRNA and protein levels as well as gelatinolytic activity, while expression levels of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 mRNAs were not changed. The specific MEK-1 inhibitor PD98059 did not change expression of MMP-2 or TIMPs. Neither SB203580 nor PD98059 changed proliferation of cells. The results suggest that stress-activated protein kinases like p38MAPK are involved in regulation of expression of MMP-2 as well as in vitro invasion of malignant melanoma cells. Inhibitors of p38MAPK may be promising substances to interfere with a signaling cascade associated with invasion of malignant tumor cells.",

Oncostatin M (OSM) is the most active IL-6-type cytokine and inhibits the proliferation of various solid tumor cell lines. Multigene-based combination therapy may be an effective practice in cancer gene therapy. The therapeutic potential of a combination of IL-24 and OSM in treating cancers is still elusive. In this study, we aimed to examine the enhanced antitumor activity of adenovirus-mediated IL-24/OSM tumor suppressor gene cotransfer in human melanoma cells. We constructed an IL-24/OSM bicistronic adenovirus and assessed its combined effect on A375 human melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo by detecting and comparing apoptosis in the bicistronic antioncogene group (Ad-IL-24-OSM) and in the IL-24 or OSM single antioncogene group. We also investigated the possible mechanism underlying this effect. The bicistronic adenovirus-mediated coexpression of IL-24 and OSM induced additive growth suppression and apoptosis and an overlapping effect on the upregulation of p21, p53, Bax, and cleaved caspase-3 in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, Ad-IL-24-OSM treatment additively reduced the expression of CDK4 and cyclin D1 in A375 melanoma cells and the expression of CD34 and Cox-2 in A375 xenograft tumors in athymic nude mice. The enhanced antitumor activity elicited by Ad-IL-24-OSM was closely associated with the activation of the apoptotic pathway and the additive inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. Therefore, our results indicate that cancer gene therapy combining two or more tumor suppressors, such as IL-24 and OSM, may constitute a novel and effective therapeutic strategy for treating malignant melanoma and other cancers.

Neither the transcript levels of cathepsin B nor those of the natural inhibitors, cystatin B and C, were altered by the interaction of melanoma cells with collagen type I. However, protein expression and cellular localization of cathepsin B and its inhibitors were markedly affected. In contrast to low-invasive cells, high-invasive cells constitutively released procathepsin B when cultured on plastic. In addition, contact of invasive cells with fibrillar collagen type I resulted in the release of both mature forms of the protease. Perturbation studies using inhibitory antibodies against the beta1 subunit of the integrin receptor indicated a role for the beta1 integrin receptor family in the regulation of cathepsin B release. Cystatin B protein expression was much lower in high-invasive cells in both culture conditions, when compared to low-invasive cells. Cystatin C expression was comparable in all cells, but cell contact to fibrillar collagen type I induced its expression.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent and specific angiogenic growth factor both in vitro and in vivo that may participate in the formation of the vascular tumor stroma. In the present study, we examined the expression of VEGF in the paraffin sections of 20 eyes harboring retinoblastoma or posterior uveal melanoma, but also in corresponding tumor cellines. By using in situ hybridization, we found that all but one of the retinoblastomas expressed VEGF mRNA. Particularly high expression was detected in areas of loosely packed tumor cells with prominent chromatin. By contrast, none of the posterior uveal melanomas expressed significant amounts of VEGF mRNA. Immunostaining with an antibody against VEGF confirmed that retinoblastomas, but not posterior uveal melanomas, also contained detectable VEGF protein. To further study the expression of VEGF in these tumor cells we performed Northern blotting on a retinoblastoma celline, Y79, and on an uveal melanoma celline, OM431. Both of these cellines expressed low levels of VEGF mRNA under normal culture conditions. However, when the cells were cultured under hypoxic conditions, a strong increase in VEGF mRNA could be seen in Y79 cells but not in OM431 cells. By using a bioassay, we also found that hypoxia stimulated the secretion of VEGF protein into the culture medium of Y79 cells. In conclusion, we have shown that VEGF mRNA and protein are expressed in retinoblastomas but not in posterior uveal melanomas. Moreover we have shown that VEGF is hypoxia-inducible in retinoblastoma cells. These results suggest that focal hypoxia may act as a stimulus for VEGF production in retinoblastomas, that in turn may contribute to tumor growth by stimulating the formation of a vascular stroma.",

Ten clones identified from this MLTC seemed to recognize melanoma in an HLA-A1-restricted manner but failed to recognize a panel of previously described melanoma antigens. The screening of an autologous melanoma cDNA library with one HLA-Al-restricted melanoma-reactive T-cell clone resulted in the isolation of a cDNA clone called AIM-2 (antigen isolated from immunoselected melanoma-2). The AIM-2 transcript seemed to have retained an intronic sequence based on its alignment with genomic sequences as well as expressed sequence tags. This transcript was not readily detected after Northern blot analysis of melanoma mRNA, indicating that only low levels of this product may be expressed in tumor cells. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, however, demonstrated a correlation between T-cell recognition and expression in HLA-A1-expressing tumor cell lines. A peptide that was encoded within a short open reading frame of 23 amino acids and conformed to the HLA-A1 binding motif RSDSGQQARY was found to represent the T-cell epitope. The AIM-2-reactive T-cell clone recognized a number of neuroectodermal tumors as well as breast, ovarian, and colon carcinomas that expressed HLA-A1, indicating that this represents a widely expressed tumor antigen.

Thus, the elucidation of mechanisms that govern metastatic propensity is urgently needed. We found that protein kinase Cε (PKCε)-mediated activation of activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) controls the migratory and invasive behaviors of melanoma cells. PKCε-dependent phosphorylation of ATF2 promoted its transcriptional repression of the gene encoding fucokinase (FUK), which mediates the fucose salvage pathway and thus global cellular protein fucosylation. In primary melanocytes and cell lines representing early-stage melanoma, the abundance of PKCε-phosphorylated ATF2 was low, thereby enabling the expression of FUK and cellular protein fucosylation, which promoted cellular adhesion and reduced motility. In contrast, increased expression of the gene encoding PKCε and abundance of phosphorylated, transcriptionally active ATF2 were observed in advanced-stage melanomas and correlated with decreased FUK expression, decreased cellular protein fucosylation, attenuated cell adhesion, and increased cell motility. Restoring fucosylation in mice either by dietary fucose supplementation or by genetic manipulation of murine Fuk expression attenuated primary melanoma growth, increased the number of intratumoral natural killer cells, and decreased distal metastasis in murine isograft models. Tumor microarray analysis of human melanoma specimens confirmed reduced fucosylation in metastatic tumors and a better prognosis for primary melanomas that had high abundance of fucosylation. Thus, inhibiting PKCε or ATF2 or increasing protein fucosylation in tumor cells may improve clinical outcome in melanoma patients. ",

The term \"vasculogenic mimicry\" has been used to describe the manner in which highly aggressive, but not poorly aggressive melanoma tumor cells express endothelial and epithelial markers and form vasculogenic-like networks similar to embryonic vasculogenesis. Vasculogenic mimicry is one example of the remarkable plasticity demonstrated by aggressive melanoma cells and suggests that these cells have acquired an embryonic-like phenotype. Since the initial discovery of tumor cell vasculogenic mimicry by our laboratory, we have been focusing on understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate this process. This review will highlight recent findings identifying key signal transduction events that regulate melanoma vasculogenic mimicry and their similarity to the signal transduction events responsible for promoting embryonic vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Specifically, this review will focus on the role of the Eph receptors and ligands in embryonic vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, and vasculogenic mimicry.",

Expression of PD-L1 on the cell surface of either tumor cells or infiltrating immune cells is associated with a higher likelihood of response to PD-1 blockade in multiple studies. Most mAbs to PD-L1 in use are directed to its extracellular domain and immunohistochemically stain tumor tissue with a mixture of cytoplasmic and membrane staining. Cytoplasmic staining obscures the interpretation of a positive reaction on the tumor cell membrane, and thus affects the accuracy of PD-L1 scoring systems. We developed a mAb to the cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1, 405.9A11 (9A11), which is both more selective for membranous PD-L1 and more sensitive in IHC and Western blotting, compared with previous mAbs specific for the PD-L1 extracellular domain. Here, we compare immunohistochemical staining patterns of PD-L1 expression in five types of tumors, using five PD-L1 mAbs: 9A11, 7G11, and three commercially available mAbs. We demonstrate that 9A11, as well as two other cytoplasmic domain-specific mAbs, E1L3N and SP142, can clearly delineate the membrane of PD-L1-positive cells in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue and facilitate interpretation of staining results.",

Indeed, Hervieu demonstrates that dacarbazine (DTIC) exerts immunostimulatory effects by inducing local activation of natural killer (NK) and T cells, suggesting that upon treatment with DTIC, the tumor participates in the initiation of an immune response: (i) DTIC treatment elicits the expression of ligands of the immunoreceptor NKG2D on melanoma cells; (ii) engagement of the ligands by NKG2D on NK cells leads to their activation, allowing enhanced tumor-cell killing and the release of IFN-γ; and (iii) IFN-γ in turn upregulates major histocompatibility complex class I expression on tumor cells, which favors their recognition by cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTLs).",

The present study sought to understand the mechanistic role of LPA G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), not only in the tumor cells but also in stromal cells of the tumor microenvironment. B16F10 melanoma cells predominantly express LPA5 and LPA2 receptors but lack LPA1. LPA dose dependently inhibited invasion of cells across a Matrigel layer. RNAi-mediated knockdown of LPA5 relieved the inhibitory effect of LPA on invasion without affecting basal invasion. This suggests that LPA5 exerts an anti-invasive action in melanoma cells in response to LPA. In addition, both siRNA-mediated knockdown and pharmacologic inhibition of LPA2 reduced the basal rate invasion. Unexpectedly, when probing the role of this GPCR in host tissues, it was found that the incidence of melanoma-derived lung metastasis was greatly reduced in LPA5 knockout (KO) mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice. LPA1-KO but not LPA2-KO mice also showed diminished melanoma-derived lung metastasis, suggesting that host LPA1 and LPA5 receptors play critical roles in the seeding of metastasis. The decrease in tumor cell residence in the lungs of LPA1-KO and LPA5-KO animals was apparent 24 hours after injection. However, KO of LPA1, LPA2, or LPA5 did not affect the subcutaneous growth of melanoma tumors.;These findings suggest that tumor and stromal LPA receptors, in particular LPA1 and LPA5, play different roles in invasion and the seeding of metastasis.",

However, a subset of melanomas fail to be lysed by these T cells. In the present report, four different HLA-A x 0201+ melanoma cell lines not lysed by melanoma-reactive allogeneic CTL have been evaluated in detail. All four are deficient in expression of the melanocytic differentiation proteins (MDP) tyrosinase, Pme117/gp100, gp75/ trp-1, and MART-1/Melan-A. This concordant loss of multiple MDP explains their resistance to lysis by melanoma-reactive allogeneic CTL and confirms that a subset of melanomas may be resistant to tumor vaccines directed against multiple MDP-derived epitopes. All four melanoma lines expressed normal levels of HLAA x 0201, and all were susceptible to lysis by xenoreactive-peptide-dependent HLA-A x 0201-specific CTL clones, indicating that none had identifiable defects in antigen-processing pathways. Despite the lack of shared MDP-derived antigens, one of these MDP-negative melanomas, DM331, stimulated an effective autologous CTL response in vitro, which was restricted to autologous tumor reactivity. MHC-associated peptides isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography from HLA-A1 and HLA-A2 molecules of DM331 tumor cells included at least three peptide epitopes recognized by DM331 CTL and restricted by HLA-A1 or by HLA-A x 0201. Recognition of these CTL epitopes cannot be explained by defined, shared melanoma antigens; instead, unique or undefined antigens must be responsible for the autologous-cell-specific anti-melanoma response. These findings suggest that immunotherapy directed against shared melanoma antigens should be supplemented with immunotherapy directed against unique antigens or other undefined antigens, especially in patients whose tumors do not express MDP.",

Indirect immunofluorescent staining of a large number of surgically removed normal adult and fetal tissues with the MoAb 465.12S detected the cytoplasmic antigen in epithelial cells from several organs. The intensity of staining was greater in adult tissues than in the corresponding fetal tissues. Furthermore, the MoAb 465.12S stained nearly all of the surgically removed tumors tested but did not stain many of the normal tissues from which they originated. In almost all cases, the intensity and frequency of staining wa greater for tumor cells than for corresponding normal tissues. From cultured carcinoma and melanoma cells, the MoAb 465.12S immunoprecipitated four glycopolypeptides with molecular weights of 94,000, 75,000, 70,000, and 25,000. Incorporation of 3H-labeled sugars into the various components of the cytoplasmic antigen revealed that the M.W. 75,000 component was unusual in that it contained only glucosamine and mannose. The antigenic determinant defined by the MoAb 465.12S appears to be protein rather than carbohydrate in nature since it is heat sensitive and is expressed on the antigens synthesized by cells in presence of tunicamycin. Analysis of the spent culture medium of carcinoma and melanoma cell lines revealed that the cytoplasmic antigen is readily shed by these cells and consists of a major M.W. 94,000 and a minor M.W. 72,000 component. Treatment of cultured melanoma cells with the antibiotic tunicamycin showed that glycosylation of the cytoplasmic antigen is required for its shedding and/or stability in the spent culture medium.",

Control mice were treated with saline or BCG. Tumor growth and antigen expression were monitored after challenge with B16 mouse melanoma cells expressing sLe(x), sLe(a) and the ganglioside GM3. Tumor growth was reduced in mice immunized with BCG alone or cells with BCG or MPL, while tumors in mice receiving cells without adjuvants grew larger than in the control. Augmentation of IgM titers to sLe(x) and GM3 after immunization with BCG, or with cells with BCG or MPL correlated with retarded tumor growth, while increased IgG titers to sLe(x) significantly correlated with aggressive tumor growth in mice immunized with cells without adjuvants.

The engagement of endothelial cell-expressed Tim-3 with a non-galectin 9 putative receptor on B16 melanoma cells could trigger the NF-kappaB signaling pathway in B16 cells. The activated NF-kappaB not only promoted the proliferation of B16 cells, but also enhanced apoptosis resistance of B16 cells by up-regulating Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and down-regulating Bax. Consistently, Tim-3 facilitated the survival of B16 cells in the blood stream, arrested in the lung and following invasion, resulted in more metastatic nodules in the lung.

CD40L was present on the surface of activated (but not resting) platelets and was also released following platelet activation. Both recombinant soluble CD40L (rsCD40L) and activated platelet supernatants increased procoagulant activity (PCA) and TF antigen in tumor cells and monocytes. The increase in TF activity induced by both rsCD40L and activated platelet supernatants was inhibited by anti-CD40L antibody. Furthermore, contact of activated platelets with tumor cells increased cellular PCA, and this effect was also inhibited by anti-CD40L. In malignancy, the increase in cellular TF activity via CD40 (tumor cell)-CD40L (platelet) interaction may possibly enhance intravascular coagulation and hematogenous metastasis.",

We investigated the effects of 3D culture on the recognition of melanoma cells by antigen-specific HLA class I-restricted CTLs.;Culture of HBL melanoma cells expressing Melan-A/Mart-1 tumor-associated antigen and HLA-A0201 on poly-2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (polyHEMA)-coated plates resulted in the generation of aggregates of 400- to 500-microm diameters containing on average 30,000 cells and characterized by slower proliferation, as compared with monolayer (2-dimensional) cultures. HLA-A0201 restricted Melan-A/Mart-127-35-specific CTL clones were used to evaluate tumor cell immunorecognition measured as specific IFN-gamma production. Comparative gene and protein expression in 2D and 3D cultures was studied by real-time PCR and flow cytometry, respectively. Overall differences in gene expression profiles between 2D and 3D cultures were evaluated by high-density oligonucleotide array hybridization.;HLA-A0201 restricted Melan-A/Mart-127-35 specific CTL clones produced high amounts of IFN-gamma upon short-term (4-24 hours) coincubation with HBL cells cultured in 2D but not in 3D, thus suggesting altered antigen recognition. Indeed, Melan-A/Mart-1 expression, at both gene and protein levels, was significantly decreased in 3D as compared with 2D cultures. Concomitantly, a parallel decrease of HLA class I molecule expression was also observed. Differential gene profiling studies on HBL cells showed an increased expression of genes encoding molecules involved in intercellular adhesion, such as junctional adhesion molecule 2 and cadherin-like 1 (>20- and 8-fold up-regulated, respectively) in 3D as compared with 2D cultures.;Taken together, our data suggest that mere growth of melanoma cells in 3D architectures, in the absence of immunoselective pressure, may result in defective recognition by tumor-associated antigen-specific CTL.",

The CTL clone (LT12) was shown to lyse the primary T1 cells more efficiently in a classical cytotoxicity test. This differential susceptibility was not associated with MHC class I down-regulation and conjugate formation but correlated with a differential increase in Ca++ flux in the LT12 CTL when stimulated with the primary versus the metastatic tumor cells. Since LT12 uses perforin/granzyme B to kill its autologous target we analysed perforin and granzyme B mRNA expression in the CTL in the presence of either primary and metastatic melanoma cells. Quantitative PCR analysis showed an increased expression of granzyme B and perforin mRNA levels in LT12 when cocultured in the presence of the primary tumor. However, a similar level of (cytotoxic molecule) degranulation as revealed by CD107 expression was observed when LT12 was stimulated with T1 or G1 cells.

The role of alpha2beta1 integrin and CD44/CSPG receptor binding on human melanoma cell activation has been evaluated herein using triple-helical peptide ligands incorporating the alpha1(IV)382-393 and alpha1(IV)1263-1277 sequences, respectively. Gene expression and protein production of matrix metalloproteinases-1 (MMP-1), -2, -3, -13, and -14 were modulated with the alpha2beta1-specific sequence, whereas the CD44-specific sequence yielded significant stimulation of MMP-8 and lower levels of modulation of MMP-1, -2, -13, and -14. Analysis of enzyme activity confirmed different melanoma cell proteolytic potentials based on engagement of either the alpha2beta1 integrin or CD44/CSPG. These results are indicative of specific activation events that tumor cells undergo upon binding to select regions of basement membrane collagen.

Karyotypic alterations in tumor cells lead to malignant properties including uncontrolled proliferation, invasive capability, and metastatic potential. Peptide growth factors and their receptors serve as the major molecular signaling system in orchestrating tumor survival, growth, and interactions with the microenvironment. Aberrant expression of these factors by tumor cells confers growth advantage and competence for metastasis either by autocrine or paracrine mechanisms. In human melanoma, tumor progression is intimately associated with increasing growth autonomy of the malignant cells, perhaps due to the constitutive production of multiple growth factors. Among these, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is consistently expressed in cultured melanoma cells, but not in normal melanocytes, and it appears to be the main factor produced for autocrine stimulation. In addition, bFGF and other growth factors not apparently involved in autocrine loops are thought to have paracrine roles in tumor development and progression for triggering an inflammatory reaction, initiating angiogenesis and fibrous stroma formation, modulating the host immune response, and activating proteolytic enzymes produced by normal cells. Studies on autocrine and paracrine roles of growth factors in melanoma development and progression will require models that can account for the complex interactions between normal and malignant cells.",

The bcl-x gene gives rise to several alternative splice products resulting in proteins with distinct functions as the antiapoptotic Bcl-xL and proapoptotic Bcl-xS. Here, we describe a novel Bcl-x splice product of 138 amino acids termed Bcl-xAK (Atypical Killer), which encloses the Bcl-2 homology domains BH2 and BH4 as well as the transmembrane domain, but lacks BH1 and BH3. Weak endogenous expression of Bcl-xAK was seen in melanoma and other tumor cells. Interestingly, its overexpression by applying a tetracycline-inducible expression system resulted in significant induction of apoptosis in melanoma cells, which occurred in synergism with drug-induced apoptosis. After exogenous overexpression, Bcl-xAK was localized both in mitochondrial and in cytosolic cell fractions.

The miRNAs of this family have been shown to suppress epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and their down-regulation in some tumors promotes invasion and metastasis. Interestingly, while miR-200 is down-regulated in some cancers, it is up-regulated in others.;We show that levels of miR-200 are increased in melanoma cell lines compared to normal melanocytes and that miR-200 family members play a role in determining modes of tumor cell migration. Individual tumor cells can invade in either elongated, \"mesenchymal-type\" or rounded, \"amoeboid-like\" modes and these two modes of invasion are inter-convertible [1]. In melanoma cell lines, expression of miR-200 members does not suppress invasion but rather leads to a switch between modes of invasion. MicroRNA-200c results in a higher proportion of cells adopting the rounded, amoeboid-like mode of invasion, while miR-200a results in a protrusion-associated elongated mode of invasion. Functional target identification studies suggest that the morphological effects of miR-200c may be mediated by reduced expression of MARCKS, which has been linked to formation of cell protrusions. In contrast miR-200a reduces actomyosin contractility, a feature of rounded morphology.;Overall our findings call into question the general role of miR-200 in suppressing invasion and metastasis, and highlight novel distinguishing characteristics of individual miR-200 family members.",

In this article, we demonstrate that exposure of bcl-2 overexpressing melanoma cells to hypoxia induced phosphorylation of AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 proteins. On the contrary, no modulation of these pathways by bcl-2 was observed under normoxic conditions. When HIF-1alpha expression was reduced by RNA interference, AKT and ERK1/2 phosphorylation were still induced by bcl-2. Pharmacological inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways reduced the induction of VEGF and HIF-1 in response to bcl-2 overexpression in hypoxia. No differences were observed between control and bcl-2-overexpressing cells in normoxia, in terms of VEGF protein secretion and in response to PI3K and MAPK inhibitors. We also demonstrated that RNA interference-mediated down-regulation of bcl-2 expression resulted in a decrease in the ERK1/2 phosphorylation and VEGF secretion only in bcl-2-overexpressing cell exposed to hypoxia but not in control cells. In conclusion, our results indicate, for the first time, that bcl-2 synergizes with hypoxia to promote expression of angiogenesis factors in melanoma cells through both PI3K- and MAPK-dependent pathways.",

We investigated TIM-3 expression in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), and further analyzed whether the aberrant expression of TIM-3 is related to the prognosis for patients with lung cancer. Tumor tissue samples from 30 patients with NSCLC were involved. Results of immunohistochemical analysis showed that TIM-3 stained positive on tumor cells in 86.7% (26/30) patients with primary NSCLC. The TIM-3 expression in NSCLC tumor cells was correlated with histologic type and pathologic T classification of the disease (P < .05). More importantly, patients with TIM-3-positive tumor cells had a significantly shorter survival time than those with TIM-3-negative tumors. Multivariate analysis demonstrated the significant role of TIM-3 expression in tumor cells as an independent prognostic factor for patients with NSCLC (relative risk, 4.481; 95% confidence interval, 1.790-11.22; P = .0005).

        "Doc_abstract":"R24, an IgG3 mouse monoclonal antibody reactive with the disialoganglioside GD3, was found to be a potent mediator of human complement cytotoxicity and human effector cell cytotoxicity. Cytotoxicity correlated with the degree of antibody binding (GD3 cell surface expression) for each of the melanoma cell lines and melanocyte cell cultures tested. Melanoma cell lines binding low amounts of R24 (low GD3 cell surface expressors) were not lysed in R24-directed immune reactions, suggesting that a threshold number of R24 molecules bound per cell is necessary to initiate these cytotoxic mechanisms. Since both complement- and cell-mediated reactions lysed the same subpopulations of cells in each cell line, both mechanisms appeared to depend on similar threshold quantities of bound R24 molecules. However, due to the heterogeneity of R24 binding in each cell line, the numerical value for this threshold could not be determined. Only in cell lines binding greater than 10(7) R24 molecules per cell were greater than 90% of the cells lysed. Normal melanocytes in culture were not lysed by R24-directed immune mechanisms, due to their low GD3 expression, indicating that monoclonal antibodies such as R24 may show tumor specificity with regard to effector functions even though normal cells express the relevant antigen. In contrast to the potent in vitro activity of R24, treatment of nu/nu mice bearing human melanoma grafts resulted in tumor inhibition only when started within 3 days of tumor cell inoculation. No effect was seen on established tumors. Thus, this in vivo mouse model failed to predict the clinical and pathological findings observed in treatment trials of R24 in human melanoma patients--urticaria involving skin metastases, cellular infiltration of tumor tissue, and tumor regression. In addition to activating immunologic effector functions, R24 had direct effects on melanoma cells, blocking their ability to attach to surfaces and causing tumor cell aggregation. These effects were again related to the number of R24 molecules bound to the cell surface; no aggregation was seen with cell lines binding less than 4 X 10(5) molecules per cell. Both immune and nonimmune effector functions may be involved in the tumor inhibitory activity of R24 in humans.",

Growth and development of these cells after transplantation into the rat and mouse brain were studied by immunocytochemical and histological techniques. The implanted cells were localized by prelabelling the cell nuclei with bisbenzimide, a fluorescent marker which binds to DNA. Following transplantation into rats, B16/C3 melanoma cells were found to survive for at least 4-6 weeks. These cells initially expressed tyrosinase and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity and in some cases contained catecholamines. After 3 weeks, the cytoplasm of the transplanted cells began to accumulate melanin; catecholamines and tyrosinase immunoreactivity were no longer detected. Ultimately the cells became round in shape and densely pigmented. Growth of the tumor in the rats was restricted and the implant was encapsulated within a glial sheath. There was evidence of an immune reaction to the tumor in that cells with Ia antigen immunoreactivity were present surrounding the graft. The rat hosts were not adversely affected by the presence of the tumor, nor did the tumor cell grafts alter rotational behavior consequent to unilateral substantia nigra lesions. In mouse hosts, however, the melanoma grew rapidly, was not encapsulated by glia and led to death of all animals. These data suggest that the tumor was not rapidly destroyed in rats, even though its growth was controlled through immunological mechanisms. Both trophic and immunological mechanisms may therefore be involved in the regulation of survival and differentiation of intracerebral grafts of tumor cells.",

Inconsistent effects from growth stimulation to induction of apoptosis of malignant tumor cells, however, have been reported. Melanoma is an increasingly common and potentially lethal malignancy. It was reported that melanoma cells were more susceptible to ascorbate toxicity than any other tumor cells. The mechanisms accounting for ascorbate-induced apoptosis in human melanoma cells, however, have remained unclear. This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of sodium ascorbate on cytotoxicity and apoptosis in human malignant melanoma A375.S2 cells. A375.S2 cells were incubated with a certain range of concentrations of sodium ascorbate for various time periods. In order to examine the effects of sodium ascorbate on cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis and necrosis, we performed 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride assays and flow cytometry analysis. Polymerase chain reaction was used to examine the mRNA levels of p53, p21, p27, cyclin A, cyclin E, CDK2 and CDK4, which are associated with cell cycle S-phase arrest and apoptosis. Flow cytometric analysis showed that sodium ascorbate significantly induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in the A375.S2 cell line in a dose-dependent manner. The increased expressions of p53 and p21, and the decreased expressions of cyclin A, cyclin E, CDK2 and CDK4, indicated the cell cycle arrest at G1/S phase after the cells had been treated with sodium ascorbate. Induction of apoptosis involved an increase in the levels of p53, p21 and cellular Ca, and a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase 3 before culminating in apoptosis in sodium ascorbate-treated A375.S2 cells.",

A375P parental cells, A375P-Hygro, and A375P-IL-10-positive cells were injected s.c. and i.v. into nude mice. A375P-IL-10 cells produced significantly slower growing s.c. tumors and fewer lung metastases than control cells. The tumorigenicity of the human melanoma A375SM and the murine melanoma B16-BL6 cells was also significantly inhibited when they were admixed with A375P-IL-10 but not with A375P-Hygro before s. c. injection into nude mice. The suppression of tumor growth and metastasis was directly correlated with a decrease in neovascularity determined by immunostaining with anti-factor VIII. Because tumor-associated macrophages are the major source of angiogenic molecules in melanoma, we used reverse transcription-PCR to demonstrate that IL-10 down-regulates the production of vascular endothelial growth factor, the most potent angiogenic factor in activated macrophages. Other factors involved in angiogenesis such as IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-6, and the proteinase matrix metalloproteinase-9 were also inhibited in activated macrophages by supernatants from A375P-IL-10 cells.

However, little is known about the regulation of CREB and ATF-1 activities and their phosphorylation within the tumor microenvironment. We analyzed the effect of platelet-activating factor (PAF), a potent phospholipid mediator of inflammation, for its ability to activate CREB and ATF-1 in eight cultured human melanoma cell lines, and we found that PAF receptor (PAFR) was expressed in all eight lines. In metastatic melanoma cell lines, PAF induced CREB and ATF-1 phosphorylation via a PAFR-mediated signal transduction mechanism that required pertussis toxin-insensitive Galphaq protein and adenylate cyclase activity and was antagonized by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and p38 MAPK inhibitors. Addition of PAF to metastatic A375SM cells stimulated CRE-dependent transcription, as observed in a luciferase reporter assay, without increasing the CRE DNA binding capacity of CREB. Furthermore, PAF stimulated the gelatinase activity of MMP-2 by activating transcription and MMP-2 expression. MMP-2 activation correlated with the PAF-induced increase in the expression of an MMP-2 activator, membrane type 1 MMP. PAF-induced expression of pro-MMP-2 was causally related to PAF-induced CREB and ATF-1 phosphorylation; it was prevented by PAFR antagonist and inhibitors of p38 MAPK and protein kinase A and was abrogated upon quenching of CREB and ATF-1 activities by forced overexpression of a dominant-negative form of CREB. PAF-induced MMP-2 activation was also down-regulated by p38 MAPK and protein kinase A inhibitors. Finally, PAFR antagonist PCA4248 inhibited the development of A375SM lung metastasis in nude mice. This result indicated that PAF acts as a promoter of melanoma metastasis in vivo. We proposed that metastatic melanoma cells overexpressing CREB/ATF-1 are better equipped than nonmetastatic cells to respond to PAF within the tumor microenvironment.",

Activity of (R,R')-MNF positively correlated with the β2-AR expression levels across tested cell lines. The anti-motility activity of (R,R')-MNF was inhibited by the β2-AR antagonist ICI-118,551 and the protein kinase A inhibitor H-89. The adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin and the phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor Ro 20-1724 mimicked the ability of (R,R')-MNF to inhibit migration of melanoma cell lines in culture, highlighting the importance of cAMP for this phenomenon. (R,R')-MNF caused significant inhibition of cell growth in β2-AR-expressing cells as monitored by radiolabeled thymidine incorporation and xCELLigence system.

Tissue samples obtained from 17 patients were analyzed for expression of MC1R by immunohistochemistry. Additionally, uveal melanoma cell lines were treated with proinflammatory cytokines, after which MC1R cell surface expression was analyzed by flow cytometry.;Results demonstrated that MC1R is expressed by uveal melanoma to a significantly greater extent than other melanoma markers.

        "Doc_abstract":"Cancer metastasis involves multistep adhesive interactions between tumor cells (TCs) and endothelial cells (ECs), but the molecular mechanisms of intercellular communication in the tumor microenvironment remain elusive. Using static and flow coculture systems in conjunction with flow cytometry, we discovered that certain receptors on the ECs are upregulated on melanoma cell adhesion. Direct contact but not separate coculture between human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs) and a human melanoma cell line (Lu1205) increased intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and E-selectin expression on HUVECs by 3- and 1.5-fold, respectively, compared with HUVECs alone. The nonmetastatic cell line WM35 failed to promote ICAM-1 expression changes in HUVECs on contact. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed that EC-TC contact has a synergistic effect on the expression of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, and growth-related oncogene α (Gro-α). By using E-selectin cross-linking and beads coated with CD44 immunopurified from Lu1205 cells, we showed that CD44/selectin ligation was responsible for the ICAM-1 up-regulation on HUVECs. Protein kinase Cα (PKC-α) activation was found to be the downstream target of the CD44/selectin-initiated signaling, as ICAM-1 elevation was inhibited by siRNA targeting PKCα or a dominant negative form of PKCα (PKCα DN). Western blot analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) showed that TC-EC contact mediated p38 phosphorylation and binding of the transcription factor SP-1 to its regulation site. In conclusion, CD44/selectin binding signals ICAM-1 up-regulation on the EC surface through a PKCα-p38-SP-1 pathway, which further enhances melanoma cell adhesion to ECs during metastasis.",

We developed a fusion protein based on the tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 linked to a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (TIMP-1-GPI). The TIMP-1-GPI-fusion protein shows unique properties. Exogenous administration of TIMP-1-GPI can result in transient morphological changes to treated cells including modulation of proliferation and decreased resistance to apoptosis. The effect of TIMP-1-GPI on the biology of melanoma in the context of a defined hyperthermic dose was evaluated in vitro. Clonogenic assays were used to measure cell survival. Gelatinase zymography determined secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Monoclonal antibody against FAS/CD95 was applied to induce apoptosis. The expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and the secretion of immunoregulatory cytokines were then evaluated using Western blot and ELISA. TIMP-1-GPI combined with a sub-lethal hyperthermic treatment (41.8 degrees C for 2 h) suppressed tumor cell growth capacity as measured by clonogenic assay. The co-treatment also significantly suppressed tumor cell proliferation, enhanced FAS receptor surface expression increased tumor cell susceptibility to FAS-mediated killing. The increased sensitivity to FAS-induced apoptosis was linked to alterations in the apoptotic mediators Bcl-2, Bax, Bcl-XL and Apaf-1. The agent works in concert with sub-lethal hyperthermic treatment to render melanoma cells sensitive to FAS killing. The targeted delivery of TIMP-1-GPI to tumor environments in the context of regional hyperthermic therapy could be optimized through the use of thermosensitive liposomes.",

Patients were immunized by three vaccinations, each consisting of 60 x 106 irradiated (100 Gy) melanoma cells (secreting 120 ng of IL-2/10(6) cells/24 hr) administered subcutaneously at weekly intervals for 3 consecutive weeks. Side effects of treatment consisted of swelling of locoregional lymph nodes and induration at the site of injection, i.e., a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction. In three patients, vaccination induced inflammatory responses in distant metastases containing necrosis or apoptosis along with T cell infiltration. Apoptosis occurred only in Bcl-2-negative areas, not in Bcl-2-expressing parts of the metastases. Two other patients experienced complete or partial regression of subcutaneous metastases. Seven patients had protracted stabilization (4 to >46 months) of soft tissue metastases, including one patient who developed vitiligo after vaccination. Immune responses to the vaccine could be detected in 67% of the 27 patients measured. Vaccination was shown to induce a variable change in the number of anti-vaccine cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in peripheral blood, which did not correlate with response to treatment. However, in two of five patients the frequency of anti-autologous tumor CTLs measured was significantly higher than before vaccination. This study demonstrates the feasibility, safety, and therapeutic potential of vaccination of humans with allogeneic, gene-modified tumor cells, and that frequencies of vaccine-specific CTLs among patient lymphocytes can be determined by using a modified limited dilution analysis (LDA).",

Both sensitive and resistant cells were grown in the presence of tea tree oil at concentrations ranging from 0.005 to 0.03%. Both the complex oil (tea tree oil) and its main active component terpinen-4-ol were able to induce caspase-dependent apoptosis of melanoma cells and this effect was more evident in the resistant variant cell population.

(1993) Clin. Exp. Metastasis 11, 439-452]. We report here that the deranged expression of class I molecules by B16 melanoma cells is more than a mere acquisition of the capacity to escape immune recognition. Namely, cells of the B16 melanoma prompted splenic lymphocytes to commit death after coculture. However, a class I-expressing and nonmetastatic CL8-2 clone was found to be less potent as an inducer of apoptosis than class I-deficient and metastatic BL9 and BL12 clones. Both Thy1.2(+) and Thy1.2(-) splenocytes underwent cell death when exposed to the class I-deficient BL9 clone. A proportion of CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells among splenocytes exposed to the BL9 clone was lower than that observed in a coculture with cells of the CL8-2 clone. Consistently, none of the melanoma clones studied produced a ligand to the FAS receptor (FAS-L). Thus, our results provide evidence that (i) the production of FAS-L may not be the sole mechanism by which malignant cells induce apoptosis in immunocytes, and (ii) absence of MHC class I glycoproteins plays an important role in preventing the elimination of potential effector immunocytes by tumor cells.",

Since only limited data exist for human brain metastases, we aimed at characterizing tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and expression of immune checkpoints in the respective tumors. Two brain metastases cohorts, a mixed entity cohort (n = 252) and a breast carcinoma validation cohort (n = 96) were analyzed for CD3+, CD8+, FOXP3+, PD-1+ lymphocytes and PD-L1+ tumor cells by immunohistochemistry. Analyses for association with clinico-epidemiological and neuroradiological parameters such as patient survival or tumor size were performed. TILs infiltrated brain metastases in three different patterns (stromal, peritumoral, diffuse). While carcinomas often show a strong stromal infiltration, TILs in melanomas often diffusely infiltrate the tumors. Highest levels of CD3+ and CD8+ lymphocytes were seen in renal cell carcinomas (RCC) and strongest PD-1 levels on RCCs and melanomas. High amounts of TILs, high ratios of PD-1+/CD8+ cells and high levels of PD-L1 were negatively correlated with brain metastases size, indicating that in smaller brain metastases CD8+ immune response might get blocked. PD-L1 expression strongly correlated with TILs and FOXP3 expression. No significant association of patient survival with TILs was observed, while high levels of PD-L1 showed a strong trend towards better survival in melanoma brain metastases (Log-Rank p = 0.0537). In summary, melanomas and RCCs seem to be the most immunogenic entities. Differences in immunotherapeutic response between tumor entities regarding brain metastases might be attributable to this finding and need further investigation in larger patient cohorts. ",

Agents such as interleukin 2 (IL-2), which can augment effector cell function and promote destruction of antibody-coated tumor cells, might produce improved antitumor responses when combined with R24. In this series, we evaluated the combination of R24 and IL-2 in a Phase 1b study in patients with metastatic melanoma. Twenty-eight patients with metastatic melanoma were entered into the protocol at two institutions. Patients received 8 weeks of IL-2 by continuous i.v. infusion at a dose (4.5 x 10(5) Amgen units/m2/day) designed to selectively expand natural killer (NK) cells. In weeks 5 and 6, patients received R24 for a total of four doses. Twenty-four h after each R24 infusion, patients received a 2-h bolus dose of IL-2 to help promote activity of NK effectors against antibody-coated melanoma targets. Additional IL-2 boluses were administered in weeks 7 and 8. Doses were escalated through two bolus doses of R24 (5 or 15 mg/m2) and two bolus doses of IL-2 (2.5 or 5.0 x 10(5) units/m2). Although one patient experienced severe capillary leak syndrome during IL-2, therapy was otherwise well tolerated. At the higher dose level of R24, two of four patients experienced transient but severe abdominal and chest discomfort, necessitating dose reduction. One patient with ocular melanoma and liver metastases had a partial response. Two additional patients had minor responses. A dramatic increase in NK cell number was noted as a result of treatment, as was augmentation of cytolytic activity against cultured NK-sensitive targets. Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against cultured melanoma cells in the presence of exogenous R24 or in the presence of serum obtained from patients following R24 infusion also increased during treatment. Our experience indicates that R24 and low-dose IL-2 can be safely combined in patients with metastatic melanoma and that this combination can promote destruction of cultured melanoma cells.

During the transition from normal cells to benign and malignant lesions, and subsequently to metastatic cancer, stepwise changes in intercellular communications provide tumor cells with the ability to overcome cell-cell adhesion and micro-environmental controls from the host and to invade surrounding tissues and disperse to distant locations. Cadherins are major cell-cell adhesion molecules involved in the development and maintenance of skin. E-cadherin expressed in normal melanocytes mediates growth and invasion control by keratinocytes. Progressive loss of E-cadherin and gain of N-cadherin during melanoma development not only free melanoma cells from control by keratinocytes, but also provide new adhesion properties, resulting in switched partnerships with fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells. The cadherin subtype switching also dictates gap junctional specificity in melanocytic cells during tumor development. This selective intercellular communication may contribute to the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and migration of melanocytic cells in both physiologic and pathologic conditions. Abnormal up-regulation of the immunoglobin repeat-containing cell adhesion molecules Mel-CAM and L1-CAM potentiates invasion and migration of melanoma.

We tested this finding by studying the expression of CTp11 and NY-ESO-1 by melanoma samples from different stages of progression.;We collected 20 primary, 22 locoregional, and 10 distant metastatic melanoma samples. We extracted total RNA, and reverse transcription yielded cDNA, which was PCR-amplified using primers to detect beta-actin, tyrosinase, MART-1, NY-ESO-1, and CTp11. The PCR products were separated on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels and visualized by UV transillumination.;All samples were positive for beta-actin and MART-1 and all but two were positive for tyrosinase, confirming RNA integrity and the presence of melanoma. Twenty-seven samples were positive for NY-ESO-1, CTp11, or both. CTp11 tended to be expressed by primary melanomas and NY-ESO-1 by metastatic samples (P < 0.02).;There is a statistically significant difference in the distribution of the expression of CTp11 and NY-ESO-1 in melanoma from different stages of progression. NY-ESO-1 may be a marker of more advanced disease and CTp11 of less advanced disease.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Ags derived from commonly mutated oncogenic proteins seem ideally suited as targets for tumor immunotherapy. Nonetheless, only a few mutated epitopes efficiently presented by human tumors have thus far been identified. We describe here an approach to identify such epitopes. This approach involves: 1) identifying tumors expressing a ras mutation and isolating the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL); 2) transfecting COS cells to induce expression of unknown mutated peptides in the context of a patient's HLA class I molecules; and 3) screening epitope recognition by using TIL from the tumors expressing a ras mutation. By using this approach, there appeared to be a N-ras mutation (a glutamine-to-arginine exchange at residue 61 (Q61R)), detected in a melanoma lesion, which was recognized specifically by the autologous TIL in the HLA-A*0101 context. The ras peptide 55-64(Q61R) was the epitope of these TIL and was regularly presented by Q61R-mutated HLA-A*0101(+) melanoma cell lines. This peptide and its wild-type homolog (55-64(wt)) bound to HLA-A*0101 with similar affinities. However, only the mutated peptide could induce specific CTL expansion from PBL. All the CTL clones specific to the mutated peptide, failed to recognize the wild-type sequence on both COS and melanoma cells. These data thus show that oncogenic protein mutations can create shared tumor-specific CTL epitopes, efficiently presented by tumor cells, and that screening for oncogene-transfected COS cell recognition by TIL (from tumors containing mutations) is a powerful approach for the identification of these epitopes.",

Here, we utilized DNA microarray-based gene expression profiling techniques to identify molecular determinants of melanoma progression within a unique panel of isogenic human melanoma cell lines. When a poorly tumorigenic cell line, derived from an early melanoma, was compared with two increasingly aggressive derivative cell lines, the expression of 66 genes was significantly changed. A similar pattern of differential gene expression was found with an independently derived metastatic cell line. We further examined these melanoma progression-associated genes via use of a tailored TaqMan Low Density Array (LDA), representing the majority of genes within our cohort of interest. Considerable concordance was seen between the transcriptomic profiles determined by DNA microarray and TaqMan LDA approaches. A range of novel markers were identified that correlated here with melanoma progression. Most notable was TSPY, a Y chromosome-specific gene that displayed extensive down-regulation in expression between the parental and derivative cell lines. Examination of a putative CpG island within the TSPY gene demonstrated that this region was hypermethylated in the derivative cell lines, as well as metastatic melanomas from male patients. Moreover, treatment of the derivative cell lines with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 2'-deoxy-5-azacytidine (DAC), restored expression of the TSPY gene to levels comparable with that found in the parental cells. Additional DNA microarray studies uncovered a subset of 13 genes from the above-mentioned 66 gene cohort that displayed re-activation of expression following DAC treatment, including TSPY, CYBA and MT2A. DAC suppressed tumor cell growth in vitro. Moreover, systemic treatment of mice with DAC attenuated growth of melanoma xenografts, with consequent re-expression of TSPY mRNA. Overall, our data support the hypothesis that multiple genes are targeted, either directly or indirectly, by DNA hypermethylation during melanoma progression.",

In addition, treatment with PPP inhibited several mechanism involved in metastasis, including tumor cells adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins, activity and expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2, and cell migration as well as invasion through basement membranes and endothelial cell layer. Furthermore, PPP significantly delayed established of uveal melanoma tumor and drastically reduced the incidence of liver metastasis in mice.;Our data suggest that IGR-IR is crucial for growth and survival as well as invasion and metastasis of uveal melanoma cells.

We produced scFv antibodies directed against Melanoma AntiGEn A1 (MAGE A1) presented by human leukocyte antigen A1 (HLA-A1), in short M1/A1, and coupled these TCR-like antibodies to liposomes to achieve specific melanoma targeting. Two anti-M1/A1 antibodies with different ligand-binding affinities were derived from a phage-display library and reformatted into scFvs with an added cysteine at their carboxyl termini. Protein production conditions, ie, bacterial strain, temperature, time, and compartments, were optimized, and following production, scFv proteins were purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. Batches of pure scFvs were validated for specific binding to M1/A1-positive B-cells by flow cytometry. Coupling of scFvs to liposomes was conducted by employing different conditions, and an optimized procedure was achieved. In vitro experiments with immunoliposomes demonstrated binding of M1/A1-positive B-cells as well as M1/A1-positive melanoma cells and internalization by these cells using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Notably, the scFv with nonenhanced affinity of M1/A1, but not the one with enhanced affinity, was exclusively bound to and internalized by melanoma tumor cells expressing M1/A1.

Maturation of monocyte-derived DCs, as documented by phenotype analysis and T-cell immunostimulatory activity, was inhibited by phagocytosis of dying melanoma cells containing a large fraction of cells in early apoptosis (Annexin-V+ and propidium iodide-) but promoted by the same tumors when in late apoptosis/secondary necrosis (Annexin-V+ and propidium iodide+) or when dying by primary necrosis. These opposite effects on DC maturation were observed after the uptake of early or late apoptotic cells from most vertical growth phase primary tumors and all metastases but not after the uptake of dying cells from a radial growth phase primary tumor or normal adult melanocytes. Inhibition of DC maturation by early apoptotic melanoma cells correlated with expression of interleukin-10 in neoplastic cells and was prevented by preincubating the tumor cells with a neutralizing antibody to interleukin-10 before tumor uptake by DCs. Cross-presentation of the melanoma-associated antigen gp100(209-217) to peptide-specific CTLs by HLA-A*0201+ DCs was achieved 48-72 h after phagocytosis of HLA-A*0201- melanoma cells in apoptosis, or primary necrosis, but only when tumor necrosis factor-alpha was added to DCs 4 h after the initiation of tumor phagocytosis. These results suggest that phases of apoptosis and neoplastic transformation affect maturation of myeloid DCs that take up dying cells of the melanocyte lineage. However, neoplastic cells in late apoptosis, or even in primary necrosis, induce only a partial DC differentiation not sufficient to achieve cross-presentation of tumor antigens to CTLs unless further DC maturation is promoted by additional signals. These results suggest a novel mechanism of tumor escape that may prevent the development of antitumor immunity through the maturation block induced in DCs by neoplastic cells in the early phase of apoptosis.",

Cell viability and proliferation was detected by WST-1 assay and with the xCELLigence system, respectively. Apoptosis was measured by the annexin-V/PI flow cytometric assay. Western blot was used to measure cleaved caspase 3, survivin, P-STAT3, P-ERK and P-AKT. B16 and A375 cells were injected subcutaneously into C57BL/6J and BALB/c-nu mice, respectively. After 1 wk, IS solution at (50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg) was administered by intraperitoneal injection 3 times for a week. Tumor size was measured with an electronic digital caliper. IS inhibited the proliferation of melanoma cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Treatment of A375 cells with IS resulted in an increased number of apoptotic cells ranging from 5.6% to 26.3% mirrored by increases in cleaved caspase-3 and a decrease in survivin expression. IS significantly inhibited the activation of the JAK-STAT3 and MAPK pathways but promoted an unsustained activation peak of the PI3K-AKT pathway.

Furthermore, IS administration (50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg) resulted in 41% and 49% decreased tumor volume in B16 bearing mice, respectively.

However, what regulates immune cell infiltration of tumors remains to be identified. Stat3 is constitutively activated with high frequency in diverse cancers, promoting tumor cell growth and survival. Blocking Stat3 signaling in tumors in vivo results in tumor growth inhibition that involves killing of nontransfected tumor cells and infiltration of immune effector cells, suggesting that Stat3 activity in tumor cells might affect immune cell recruitment. However, dying tumor cells can also attract immune cells. In this study, we show in isogenic murine melanomas that natural Stat3 activity is associated with tumor growth and reduction of T cell infiltration. Blocking Stat3 signaling in the melanoma cells containing high Stat3 activity results in expression of multiple chemoattractants, leading to increased migration of lymphocytes, NK cells, neutrophils, and macrophages. In addition, blocking Stat3 triggers tumor cells to produce soluble factors capable of activating macrophage production of NO in vitro and in vivo. TNF-alpha and IFN-beta, which are secreted by Stat3-inhibited tumor cells, are able to activate macrophage NO production, whereas neutralizing TNF-alpha in the tumor supernatant from Stat3-blocked tumor cells abrogates nitrite production. Moreover, interrupting Stat3 signaling in tumor cells leads to macrophage-mediated, nitrite-dependent cytostatic activity against nontransduced tumor cells. These results suggest that tumor Stat3 activity affects recruitment of diverse immune effectors and it can be manipulated to activate the effector phase of innate immune responses.",

We report a method to enrich Circulating Melanoma Cells (CMCs) that does not presuppose malignant cell characteristics. CMCs were enriched by centrifugation of blood samples from healthy (N = 10) and patient (N = 11) donors, followed by RBC lysis and immunomagnetic depletion of CD45-positive leukocytes in a specialized magnetic separator. CMCs were identified by immunocytochemistry using Melan-A or S100B as melanoma markers and enumerated using automated microscopy image analyses. Separation was optimized for maximum sensitivity and recovery of CMCs. Our results indicate large number of CMCs in Stage IV melanoma patients. Analysis of survival suggested a trend toward decreased survival with increased number of CMCs. Moreover, melanoma-associated miRs were found to be higher in CMC-enriched fractions in two patients when compared with the unseparated samples, validating this method as applicable for molecular analyses. Negative selection is a promising approach for isolation of CMCs and other EpCAM -negative CTCs, and is amenable to molecular analysis of CMCs.

In the case of human melanoma cells, treatment with a combination of fibroblast interferon (IFN-beta) and the protein kinase C activator mezerein (MEZ) results in an irreversible loss of proliferative potential and tumorigenic properties with a concomitant induction of terminal differentiation. These changes in cellular properties are associated with an induction and suppression in specific subsets of genes that occur in a temporal manner. To identify the complete repertoire of gene changes occurring during melanoma reversion to a more differentiated state a number of molecular approaches are being used. These include, subtraction hybridization using temporally spaced cDNA libraries, random cDNA isolation and evaluation by reverse Northern blotting and high throughput microarray analysis of subtracted cDNA clones. In the present study we have used a novel approach, rapid subtraction hybridization (RaSH), to identify and clone an additional gene of potential relevance to cancer growth control and terminal cell differentiation. RaSH has identified a human ubiquitin-processing protease gene, HuUBP43, that is differentially expressed in melanoma cells as a function of treatment with IFN-beta or IFN-beta + MEZ. HuUBP43 is a type I interferon inducible gene that is upregulated in a diverse panel of normal and tumor cells when treated with IFN-beta via the JAK/STAT kinase pathway.

Cancer patients with brain metastases display poor prognosis and survival due to the lack of effective therapeutics and treatment strategies. Recent work using intravital microscopy and preclinical animal models indicates that metastatic cells colonize the brain, specifically in close contact with the existing brain vasculature. However, it is not known how contact with the vascular niche promotes microtumor formation. Here, we investigate the role of connexins in mediating early events in brain colonization using transparent zebrafish and chicken embryo models of brain metastasis. We provide evidence that breast cancer and melanoma cells utilize connexin gap junction proteins (Cx43, Cx26) to initiate brain metastatic lesion formation in association with the vasculature. RNAi depletion of connexins or pharmacological blocking of connexin-mediated cell-cell communication with carbenoxolone inhibited brain colonization by blocking tumor cell extravasation and blood vessel co-option. Activation of the metastatic gene twist in breast cancer cells increased Cx43 protein expression and gap junction communication, leading to increased extravasation, blood vessel co-option and brain colonization. Conversely, inhibiting twist activity reduced Cx43-mediated gap junction coupling and brain colonization. Database analyses of patient histories revealed increased expression of Cx26 and Cx43 in primary melanoma and breast cancer tumors, respectively, which correlated with increased cancer recurrence and metastasis. Together, our data indicate that Cx43 and Cx26 mediate cancer cell metastasis to the brain and suggest that connexins might be exploited therapeutically to benefit cancer patients with metastatic disease.",

The E-box transcription factor TWIST1 is essential to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell migration in the developing neural crest. In melanoma, which derives from the neural crest cell lineage, enhanced TWIST1 expression has been linked to worse clinical prognosis. However, mechanisms underlying TWIST1 expression and whether aberrant TWIST1 levels promote steps in melanoma progression remain unknown. Here, we report that elevated TWIST1 mRNA/protein expression is dependent on extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 signaling, which is hyperactive in the majority of melanomas. We show that TWIST1 protein levels are especially high in melanoma cell lines generated from invasive, premetastatic stage tumors. Furthermore, TWIST1 expression is required and sufficient to promote invasion through Matrigel and spheroid outgrowth in three-dimensional dermal-mimetic conditions. Alterations to spheroid outgrowth were not as a result of altered cell death, cell-cycle profile, or paradigm EMT protein changes. Importantly, we identify matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) as a novel downstream target of TWIST1. We have determined that TWIST1 acts, in a dose-dependent manner, as a mediator between hyperactive ERK1/2 signaling and regulation of MMP-1 transcription.

We show that NK cells, upon interaction with melanoma cells, can release a chemotactic form of High Mobility Group Box-1 (HMGB1) protein capable of attracting additional activated NK cells. We first demonstrate that the engagement of different activating NK cell receptors, including those mainly involved in tumor cell recognition can induce the active release of HMGB1. Then we show that during NK-mediated tumor cell killing two HMGB1 forms are released, each displaying a specific electrophoretic mobility possibly corresponding to a different redox status. By the comparison of normal and perforin-defective NK cells (which are unable to kill target cells) we demonstrate that, in NK/melanoma cell co-cultures, NK cells specifically release an HMGB1 form that acts as chemoattractant, while dying tumor cells passively release a non-chemotactic HMGB1. Finally, we show that Receptor for Advanced Glycation End products is expressed by NK cells and mediates HMGB1-induced NK cell chemotaxis. Proteomic analysis of NK cells exposed to recombinant HMGB1 revealed that this molecule, besides inducing immediate chemotaxis, also promotes changes in the expression of proteins involved in the regulation of the cytoskeletal network. Importantly, these modifications could be associated with an increased motility of NK cells. Thus, our findings allow the definition of a previously unidentified mechanism used by NK cells to amplify their response to tumors, and provide additional clues for the emerging role of HMGB1 in immunomodulation and tumor immunity.",

Both types of tumor cells displayed effective chemoattractive capacity towards immature, but not mature DC. Furthermore, conditioned medium of discrete melanoma lines induced upregulation of CD80, CD86, MHC class I, and MHC class II molecules on immature DC. However, de novo expression of E-cadherin and strong upregulation of CD15 could also be detected in the absence of CD83 expression. Melanoma-conditioned DC exhibited an increased adhesion capacity to a melanoma cell line in vitro and did not migrate in response to SLC chemokine. Tumor-infiltrating CD15(+) cells displaying DC morphology could also be detected by immunohistochemistry in the original tumor specimens from which discrete melanoma cell lines under investigation were derived. Colorectal cancer cell lines, although able to chemoattract immature DC, were apparently unable to modulate their phenotype. Altogether our results suggest that tumor cells can attract immature DC in vitro and, eventually, modulate their phenotype. As a result, DC mobility could be severely impaired.",

Here, we investigated the cellular effects of SSX2 expression. In A375 melanoma cells, SSX2 expression resulted in an increased DNA content and enlargement of cell nuclei, suggestive of replication aberrations. The cells further displayed signs of DNA damage and genomic instability, associated with p53-mediated G1 cell cycle arrest and a late apoptotic response. These results suggest a model wherein SSX2-mediated replication stress translates into mitotic defects and genomic instability. Arrest of cell growth and induction of DNA double-strand breaks was also observed in MCF7 breast cancer cells in response to SSX2 expression. Additionally, MCF7 cells with ectopic SSX2 expression demonstrated typical signs of senescence (i.e. an irregular and enlarged cell shape, enhanced β-galactosidase activity and DNA double-strand breaks). Since replication defects, DNA damage and senescence are interconnected and well-documented effects of oncogene expression, we tested the oncogenic potential of SSX2. Importantly, knockdown of SSX2 expression in melanoma cell lines demonstrated that SSX2 supports the growth of melanoma cells. Our results reveal two important phenotypes of ectopic SSX2 expression that may drive/support tumorigenesis: First, immediate induction of genomic instability, and second, long-term support of tumor cell growth.",

We used an ABP-specific monoclonal antibody to characterize ABP expression in 18 benign nevi and 28 primary and metastatic malignant melanomas. Heterogeneous expression of ABP staining was observed in metastatic melanoma. No clear differences in ABP staining were identified among compound nevi, dysplastic nevi, and superficial spreading melanoma; however, the lentiginous intraepidermal component of the benign and malignant lesions and the pagetoid cells of superficial spreading malignant melanoma were negative for ABP. In contrast, the nested intraepidermal and dermal components of both benign nevi and primary malignant melanoma were positive. The differential expression of ABP of the lentiginous component as opposed to the intraepidermal nests and pagetoid cells of benign nevi or melanoma may represent a capacity of the nested melanocytes to migrate from the epidermis to the dermis during maturation or invasion. Taken together, the findings support that ABP may be important for cell-cell adhesion during tumorigenesis and may play a role in tumor cell ameboid motility during tissue invasion.",

Tumor angiogenesis represents an integral component of cancer metastasis prompting us to investigate a possible role of mda-9/syntenin in inducing angiogenesis. Genetic (gain-of-function and loss-of-function) and pharmacologic approaches were used to modify mda-9/syntenin expression in normal immortal melanocytes, early radial growth phase melanoma, and metastatic melanoma cells. The consequence of modifying mda-9/syntenin expression on angiogenesis was evaluated using both in vitro and in vivo assays, including tube formation assays using human vascular endothelial cells, chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assays and xenograft tumor animal models. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments confirm that MDA-9/syntenin induces angiogenesis by augmenting expression of several proangiogenic factors/genes. Experimental evidence is provided for a model of angiogenesis induction by MDA-9/syntenin in which MDA-9/syntenin interacts with the extracellular matrix (ECM), activating Src and FAK resulting in activation by phosphorylation of Akt, which induces hypoxia inducible factor 1-α (HIF-1α). The HIF-1α activates transcription of insulin growth factor-binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2), which is secreted thereby promoting angiogenesis and further induces endothelial cells to produce and secrete VEGF-A augmenting tumor angiogenesis. Our studies delineate an unanticipated cell nonautonomous function of MDA-9/syntenin in the context of angiogenesis, which may directly contribute to its metastasis-promoting properties. As a result, targeting MDA-9/syntenin or its downstream-regulated molecules may provide a means of simultaneously impeding metastasis by both directly inhibiting tumor cell transformed properties (autonomous) and indirectly by blocking angiogenesis (nonautonomous).",

The MMA-1a gene is localized on chromosome 21q22.2 and its mRNA exists of 4 exons. Homology search displayed a splice variant of MMA-1a that lacks exon 3 and that was called MMA-1b. Expression profiles of MMA-1a and MMA-1b are determined by reverse transciptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Among 30 different normal tissue samples, expression of MMA-1a and MMA-1b was exclusively found in the testis after a first PCR of 30 cycles. Even more sensitive screening achieved by performing multiple semi-nested RT-PCR showed no or very low expression in the other normal tissues tested. During melanocytic tumor progression, MMA-1a and/or MMA-1b exhibited an emergence of expression in primary melanoma (20%) and melanoma metastasis samples (30%) after only 1 round of PCR. Expression of MMA-1a and/or MMA-1b was also identified in other tumor cell lines and fresh tumor samples of variable origin, e.g., lung, liver, bladder and soft tissues (sarcomas).

We have studied the molecular events underlying interferon-gamma-induced G0/G1 arrest in four metastatic melanoma cell lines with different responsiveness to interferon-gamma. The growth arrest did not result from enhanced expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27. Instead, it correlated with downregulation of cyclin E and cyclin A and inhibition of their associated kinase activities. We show that interferon-gamma-induced growth inhibition could be abrogated by overexpression of dominant negative STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1) in the melanoma cell line A375, suggesting that STAT1 plays a crucial part for the anti-proliferative effect. Erythropoietin stimulation of a chimeric receptor led to a concentration-dependent STAT1 activation and concomitant growth arrest when it contained the STAT recruitment motif Y440 of the interferon-gamma receptor 1. In contrast, dose-response studies for interferon-gamma revealed a discrepancy between levels of STAT1 activation and the extent of growth inhibition; whereas STAT1 was activated by low doses of interferon-gamma (10 U per mL), growth inhibitory effects were only visible with 100-fold higher concentrations. Our results suggest the presence of additional signals emanating from the interferon-gamma receptor, which may counteract the anti-proliferative function of STAT1.",

Using a TaqMan low-density array for 47 human ABC transporters, mRNA expression analysis was performed from normal human epidermal melanocytes (NHEM P2 and NHEM P3), nine different cell lines originating from primary melanoma (Mel Ei, Mel Juso, Mel Ho and Mel Wei), and metastases of malignant melanoma (Mel Im, Mel Ju, SK Mel 28, HTZ 19 and HMB2). Cell line-specific expression levels were compared with gene expression in pooled RNA from a variety of other human tissues. High expression levels were detected in pooled tissue RNA as well as in cells of melanocytic origin for ABCA5, ABCB2, ABCB6, ABCD3, ABCD4, ABCF1, ABCF2 and ABCF3, whereas ABCB5 revealed a melanocyte-specific high transcript level.

In summary, we present here for the first time an ABC-transporter mRNA expression profile in melanoma in comparison to normal melanocytes.

Using fixed archival tissues from 99 primary melanomas and lectin histochemistry, we found 65 tumors that contained melanoma cells that were PNA-positive. PNA-reactive cells were not identified in normal melanocytes or in the nevocytes of 24 nevi. PNA-reactive material accumulates adjacent to the nucleus in the area of the Golgi apparatus, initially as a tiny dot, but later in quantities sufficient to displace and indent the nucleus, producing a signet ring cell-like appearance. Tumor cells containing PNA-reactive material were associated with more evolved, deeper, and thicker tumors. Two melanomas up to Clark level II were PNA positive (20%), compared with 60% of level III, 76% of level IV, and 100% of level V.

        "Doc_abstract":"Tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a potential anticancer drug since it induces apoptosis preferentially in malignant but not in normal cells. Not all cancer cells, however, are TRAIL susceptible. Chemotherapeutic drugs and ionizing radiation have been found to be able to sensitize resistant tumor cells for TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Since ultraviolet B radiation (UVB) is a potent inducer of apoptosis but exhibits much less adverse effects, we studied whether UVB sensitizes TRAIL-resistant melanoma cells. Therefore, we analyzed the TRAIL-sensitive human cell line A-375 in comparison to the resistant cell line IGR-37. Both cell lines showed expression of the long form of the antiapoptotic FLICE inhibitory protein FLIP(L) which, however, was partially cleaved into the 43 kDa form in A-375 cells. In addition, only IGR-37 cells expressed the short splicing variant FLIP(S), which exerts high antiapoptotic activity. Accordingly, transient overexpression of FLIP(S) rendered A-375 cells resistant to TRAIL. Upon exposure to low UVB doses, TRAIL-treated IGR-37 cells underwent pronounced apoptosis and TRAIL sensitivity of A-375 cells was dramatically increased. In both cases, UVB caused an inhibition of flip expression. This study indicates that (i) the expression level and the processing status of FLIP may play a crucial role in determining the sensitivity of melanoma cells towards TRAIL and (ii) expression of FLIP is regulated by UVB.",

The aim of this study was to transduce a human melanoma cell line with the gene coding for human IL-4, and to analyze cytokine production, phenotypic characteristics, and antigen expression after transduction. A retroviral vector, constructed by inserting IL-4 cDNA into the LXSN vector, was used to infect the human melanoma cell line Me14932, known to express the MHC class I HLA-A2 and the melanoma-associated antigen Melan-A/MART-1, recognized by HLA-A2-restricted T-cells. The confluence of all G418-resistant cells (Me14932/IL-4) was then analyzed for proviral integration and IL-4 mRNA expression. Substantially stable IL-4 release was detected by ELISA in the supernatant of transduced cells, ranging from 1.6 to 4.6 ng/ml per 10(5) cells per 24 hr; such a cytokine displayed a specific biologic activity, as revealed by the stimulation of blast cell proliferation and the inhibition of lymphokine activated killer cell (LAK) induction by IL-2. After 200 Gy irradiation, IL-4 release remained detectable for 5 weeks, whereas cell proliferation ceased within 7 days. Morphology and immunophenotypic characteristics of the parental cell line (expression of MHC classes I and II, ICAM-1, LFA 3, melanoma-associated antigens, etc.) were retained by the IL-4 gene-transduced melanoma as assayed by microscopy and immunofluorescence; likewise, susceptibility to lysis by LAK cells as well as a T-cell clone recognizing the Melan-A/MART-1 antigen did not change. These results, together with the lack of replication-competent retrovirus, suggest that the Me14932/IL-4 cell line displays suitable characteristics for its use in the treatment of HLA-matched melanoma patients.",

Transcriptional activation of the HO-1 gene is considered to be an adaptive response to oxidative and cellular stress and confers a protective capacity against cell and tissue injury, which could affect the responsiveness to ALA-PDT. A time-dependent accumulation (0-16 h) of protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) within melanoma cells was seen after incubation with ALA (0.5 mM ALA). Over the same time interval, a significant increase (up to 25-fold) in HO-1 protein expression was observed. Thus, the production and degradation of PPIX (via heme by HO-1) were simultaneously enhanced, leading to a reduced intracellular concentration of the photodynamically active substance PPIX. Diminishing HO-1 activity by the HO-1 inhibitor tin protoporphyrin IX (SnPPIX) significantly enhanced the formation of PPIX up to 1.8 fold. A further strong increase in HO-1 protein expression (up to 128-fold) was seen after ALA-PDT treatment. Induction of HO-1 is an essential step in the 'rescue response' of tumor cells. The pharmacological inhibition of HO-1 activity by SnPPIX leads to a considerable increase in the sensitivity of tumor cells to ALA-PDT treatment. At low radiation doses (0.42 J/cm(2)), the percentages of death cells increased significantly from 7.3+/-1.3% to 43.7+/-6.4%. This effect could be further intensified by cellular depletion of HO-1 mRNA by siRNA. The combination of pharmacological inactivation of HO-1 with gene silencing led to an increase in the death rate of up to 54.1+/-8.6%. The results presented indicate that HO-1 can play a protective role against ALA-PDT mediated cytotoxicity so that a specific inhibition of HO-1 activity and/or expression might be used to increase the efficacy of ALA-based photodynamic therapy.",

More significantly, a threshold of gp100 mRNA expression required for T-cell stimulation and target-cell killing was identified. This threshold level corresponded to approximately 500 mRNA copies per 10(8) copies of rRNA.

The human mda-7gene isolated from melanoma cell lines, has been linked with human melanoma differentiation, and growth suppression. Moreover, transfection of human mda-7 constructs into human tumor cells suppresses the growth and colony formation of tumor cells from diverse origins. To confirm and relatively quantitate expression of rat c49a gene during repair, specific primer, reduced cycle RT-PCR (reverse transcription-PCR) was performed. RT-PCR showed an approximately 9 to 12-fold elevation of rat c49a mRNA at 12 h to 5 days above nonwounded controls that gradually decreased to approximately 1.5 to 3-fold by day 14. Cloning and sequence analysis of the entire 1200 base pair c49a gene product showed 78% nucleotide homology to human mda-7. Immunohistochemistry studies localized rat C49A expression primarily to fibroblast-like cells at the wound edge and base.

Immunoprecipitation by mAb Me14/D12 of lysates from [35S]methionine-labeled melanoma cells analyzed by SDS-PAGE revealed two polypeptide chains of 33 and 38 KDa, both under reducing and nonreducing conditions. Cross-linking experiments indicated that the two chains were present at the cell surface as a dimeric structure. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that the two chains of 33 and 38 KDa had isoelectric points of 6.2 and 5.7, respectively. Treatment of the melanoma cells with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, resulted in a reduction of the Mr from 33 to 24 KDa and from 38 to 26 KDa. Peptide maps obtained after Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease digestion showed no shared peptides between the two chains.

In this study, we investigated the pattern of IL-18 expression in the human system. IL-18 production was tested by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay in various tumor cell lines, including Raji (Burkitt's lymphoma), IM-9 (B lymphoblast), Jurkat (acute T cell leukemia), SK-MES-1 (squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell line), SK-MEL-2, G-361, DM-4, and DX-3 (melanoma cell lines).

Here, we report that enhanced IL-18 expression is positively correlated with malignant skin tumors such as SCC and melanoma, suggesting the importance role of IL-18 in malignancy of skin tumors.

In particular, the resistance to oxidative stress of melanoma cells likely contributes to their intrinsic drug resistance. In an attempt to develop novel strategies for overcoming the mechanisms of cellular protection against oxidative stress, in this study we have explored the efficacy of the combination of two prooxidant agents in two human melanoma cell clones. The selected clones are characterized by a marked difference in expression of gamma-glutamyltransferase, which is known to produce a persistent low level of oxidative stress resulting in the stimulation of protective systems. The gamma-glutamyltransferase-overexpressing clone exhibited a low susceptibility to arsenic trioxide-induced apoptosis, associated with low reactive oxygen species induction and increased catalase activity. The combination of arsenic trioxide with subtoxic concentrations of ascorbic acid resulted in a sensitization to apoptotic cell death. The expression of protective mechanisms, in particular catalase activity, accounted for the behavior of the resistant clone. The sensitization achieved by the combination was associated with a cellular response involving the ASK1/p38 axis, which is implicated in the regulation of catalase expression and the activation of apoptotic signals. In conclusion, the results of our study provide evidence that a rational combination of prooxidant agents may be effective in overcoming cellular tolerance to oxidative stress.",

We recently reported a single nucleotide insertion/deletion polymorphism (SNP) in the collagenase-1 (MMP-1) promoter (Rutter et al. [1998] Can. Res. 58:5321-5325), where the insertion of an extra guanine (G) at -1607 bp creates the sequence, 5'-GGAA-3 (2G allele), compared to the sequence 5'-GAA-3' (1G allele). The presence of 2G constitutes a binding site for the ETS family of transcription factors, and increases MMP-1 transcription in fibroblasts and A2058 melanoma cells cultured in vitro. In addition, the presence of the 2G allele has been linked to several aggressive malignancies as well as to enhanced expression of MMP-1. In this study, we describe a melanoma cell line, VMM5, that is 1G homozygous, but that is invasive and expresses high levels of MMP-1 constitutively. The high level of MMP-1 expression in VMM5 cells is due to the utilization of both the p38 and ERK1/2 transduction pathways. In contrast, in the A2058 cell line, which also expresses MMP-1 constitutively and which is 2G homozygous, only the ERK pathway is activated. Thus, our data suggest that in the absence of 2G allele and in the presence of the appropriate transcription factors, tumor cells may use alternative signal/transduction pathways and cis-acting sequences to achieve high levels of MMP-1 expression, which contribute to the ability of tumor cells to invade, regardless of their genotype.",

Recently, the tumor environment has been found to exert a profound influence on drug response through cell interaction with components from the extracellular matrix (ECM). In the present study, we investigated whether individual components from the ECM may affect cell survival and/or cell death induced by the cytotoxic agent cisplatin on the SP6.5 uveal melanoma cell line. Tumor cells were shown by immunofluorescence analyses to be surrounded by the ECM proteins fibronectin (FN), type IV collagen (CIV) and laminin (LM), both at the primary and metastatic sites. Binding of SP6.5 cells to FN, LM and CIV is primarily dictated by the expression of membrane bound integrins from the beta1 family as revealed by cell adhesion assays conducted on ECM-coated culture plates. Analysis of cell death by flow cytometry demonstrated that culturing SP6.5 cells in the presence of FN, CIV and LM, substantially reduced the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis after cisplatin treatment when compared with those seeded on a non-permissive matrix. These results suggest that adhesion of the SP6.5 uveal melanoma cells to the ECM proteins FN, CIV and LM might therefore confer resistance to the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin. The cellular resistance induced by the ECM proteins toward cisplatin could explain in part the local recurrence of metastasis derived from uveal melanoma often observed clinically after chemotherapy.",

Uveal melanoma cells expressed Fas but were insensitive to Fas triggering induced by bystander cytotoxic T lymphocytes or a Fas-specific agonistic antibody; this could not be ascribed to tumor counterattack against T cells or general resistance of the tumors to apoptosis. Treatment with inhibitors of metalloproteases rendered uveal melanomas sensitive to Fas-mediated cytotoxicity. Metalloprotease inhibitors did not affect the expression of Fas but increased the surface expression of Fas ligand (FasL), which correlated with the disappearance of soluble FasL from culture supernatants of tumor cells. FasL eluted from the surface of uveal melanomas specifically inhibited cytotoxic T lymphocyte lysis of tumor cells pretreated with an inhibitor of metalloproteases. In addition to uveal melanomas, a number of other tumor cell lines of various cellular origins were sensitized to Fas-mediated cytotoxicity by metalloprotease inhibitors. Our results show that autocrine secretion of FasL shields tumor cells from Fas-mediated killing by cytotoxic lymphocytes. This defines a novel mechanism of tumor escape from immune surveillance.",

We investigated the ability of various modified species of heparin and size homogeneous oligosaccharides derived from depolymerized heparin to inhibit: a) heparanase-mediated degradation of heparan sulfate (HS) in the extracellular matrix (ECM) deposited by cultured endothelial cells, and b) lung colonization of B16-BL6 melanoma cells in C57BL mice. For this purpose, melanoma cells or conditioned medium were incubated with metabolically sulfate-labeled subendothelial ECM in the absence and presence of heparin, heparin fragment or nonanticoagulant species of heparin. Labeled HS degradation fragments released into the incubation medium were analyzed by gel filtration over Sepharose 6B. The B16-BL6 melanoma cells were also tested for lung colonization following their intravenous administration to C57BL mice, in the absence and presence of the various species of heparin. Inhibition of both heparanase and melanoma lung colonization depended on the size and degree of sulfation of the heparin molecule, the position of sulfate groups, and the occupancy of the N position of the hexosamines. Inhibition of heparanase was best achieved by heparin species containing 16 sugar units or more and having sulfate groups at both the N and O positions. Low sulfate oligosaccharides were less effective heparanase inhibitors than medium and high sulfate fractions of the same size saccharide. While O-desulfation abolished the heparanase inhibiting effect of heparin. O-sulfated, N-substituted (e.g., N-acetyl or N-hexanoyl) species of heparin retained a high inhibitory activity, provided that the N-substituted molecules had a molecular size of about > or = 4,000 daltons. Potent inhibitors of heparanase activity were also efficient inhibitors of tumor invasion and lung colonization. The antimetastatic and anticoagulant activities of heparin were unrelated, as indicated by using heparin fractions with high and low affinity for antithrombin III. These heparins differ about 200-fold in their anticoagulant activity, but expressed similar high antiheparanase and antimetastatic activities. It appears that heparanase-inhibiting species of heparin interfere with the passing of tumor cells across the capillary wall, as they significantly inhibited metastasis even when injected up to 3 h after lodgment. Structural requirements for inhibition of heparanase activity and lung colonization of melanoma cells by species of heparin were different from those identified for a) release of ECM-bound basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and b) stimulation of bFGF receptor binding and mitogenic activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "Doc_abstract":"A correlation between cancer and hypercoagulability has been described for more than a century. Patients with cancer are at increased risk for thrombotic complications, and the clotting initiator protein, tissue factor (TF), is possibly involved in this process. In addition to TF, the presence of negatively charged phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylserine (PS), is necessary to support some of the blood-clotting reactions. There are few reports describing PS exposure by tumor cells. In this study, we characterized the procoagulant properties of the murine B16F10 and the human WM-266-4 melanoma cell lines. Flow cytometry analyses showed constitutive TF expression by both cell lines, in contrast to negative staining observed for the nontumorigenic melanocyte lineage, melan-A. In addition, tumor cells accelerate plasma clotting in a number-dependent manner. For WM-266-4, this ability was partially reversed by an anti-TF antibody but not by aprotinin, a nonspecific serine-protease inhibitor. Furthermore, flow-cytometric analyses showed the presence of PS at the outer leaflet of both cell lines. This phenomenon was determinant for the assembly of the intrinsic tenase (FIXa/FVIIIa) and prothrombinase (FXa/FVa) complexes, resulting in the activation of FX to FXa and prothrombin to thrombin, respectively. As a result, incubation of WM-266-4 with human plasma produces robust thrombin generation. In conclusion, simultaneous TF expression and PS exposure are responsible for the highly procoagulant pattern of the aggressive melanoma cell lines B16F10 and WM-266-4. Therefore, these cell lines might be regarded as useful models for studying the role of blood coagulation proteins in tumor biology.",

More specifically, we used a nonviral vector, the cationic polymer, polyethylenimine (PEI), to express a transmembrane SEA fusion construct (pSEA-TM) in B16F10-induced subcutaneous melanoma in mice. The efficacy of this in vivo transfection was enhanced by concomitant infusion of epinephrine to induce local vasoconstriction. In these conditions, repeated injections of pSEA-TM/PEI complexes elicited a significant response, as evidenced by tumor growth inhibition, without systemic adverse effects. T cell infiltration of the tumors, together with positive lymphocyte proliferation tests, suggested local and systemic immune responses. Altogether, PEI-mediated targeting of SEA to melanoma tumor cells in vivo efficiently stimulates the antitumor immune response without inducing the side effects observed with systemic administration of SEA.",

This correlated with a decreased ability of the tumor cells to undergo transendothelial migration (TEM) in vitro and form dynamic, F-actin-rich pseudopodia that penetrate capillary endothelial walls in vivo. Using multiple tumor cell lines, we show that the inability to form these membrane protrusions, which likely promote TEM and extravasation, can be explained by altered adhesion dynamics and impaired cell polarization that result when Rap1 activation or cycling is perturbed. Thus, targeting Rap1 could be a useful approach for reducing the metastatic dissemination of tumor cells that undergo active TEM.",

Strategies selected to promote antitumor responses have included genetic modifications of tumor cells to induce expression of costimulatory molecules. Moreover, alloantigens can also act as strong enhancers of the immune response. In this work, we have associated the expression of two costimulatory members of the TNF superfamily, CD40L and CD70 along with an allogenic MHC Class I (H-2K(d)) molecule expression on melanoma cells (B16F10, H-2(b)) to favor the antitumor immune response. B16F10 tumor growth slows significantly when CD40L and CD70 are coexpressed by tumor cells and the association with the allogenic molecule (H-2K(d)) enhances this effect. Growth kinetics of mock and CD40L-CD70-H-2K(d)-expressing B16F10 tumors in immunocompetent versus nu/nu and beige mice suggested that CD8(+) T lymphocytes and NK cells were involved in this antitumor immunity. A delay in mock tumor growth was observed when CD40L-CD70-H-2K(d)-expressing B16F10 cells and mock tumor cells were injected simultaneously and contralaterally. It was also shown that in vivo immunization of immunocompetent mice with CD40L-CD70-H-2K(d) B16F10 tumor cells improved the generation of cytotoxic lymphocytes against the wild-type melanoma cells expressing the syngenic MHC Class I molecule H-2K(b) (B16K1).

        "Doc_abstract":"Tumor cells often display alterations in their normal program of cellular differentiation. A promising approach for the treatment of cancer involves the induction of terminal differentiation and a loss of proliferative capacity in cancer cells. In human melanoma cells, the combination of mezerein (MEZ) and fibroblast interferon (IFN-beta), results in a rapid and irreversible suppression of cell growth with a concomitant increase in the synthesis of melanin. The induction of terminal differentiation is associated with alterations in the expression of several cellular genes, including fibronectin, ISG-15 and ISG-54, and changes in the expression of specific cell surface antigens, including intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and HLA Class I antigens. In the HO-1 human melanoma cell line, induction of terminal differentiation by MEZ plus IFN-beta results in an induction and/or increased expression of ICAM-1, HLA Class I antigens and HLA Class II antigens. IFN-beta and MEZ alone can modulate expression of these antigens to a lower extent than does the combination of compounds. Induction of terminal differentiation and the irreversible suppression of cell growth is not a prerequisite for antigenic modulation in HO-1 cells. This is indicated by the inability of immune interferon (IFN-gamma), a strong inducer of ICAM-1, HLA Class I antigens and HLA Class II antigens synthesis, or the combination of IFN-beta plus IFN-gamma which synergistically but reversibly suppresses HO-1 growth, to induce melanin synthesis or terminal differentiation in HO-1 cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Our previous studies have demonstrated that caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) suppresses the growth of melanoma cells and induces reactive oxygen species generation. However, the exact mechanism of the growth suppressive effects of CAPE was not clear. Here, we determined the potential mechanism of CAPE against melanoma in vivo and in vitro. Administration of 10 mg/kg/day CAPE substantially suppressed the growth of B16F0 tumor xenografts in C57BL/6 mice. Tumors from CAPE-treated mice showed reduced phosphorylation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, AKT, mammalian target of rapamycin and protein level of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) and enhanced the cleavage of caspase-3 and poly (ADP ribose) polymerase. In order to confirm the in vivo observations, melanoma cells were treated with CAPE. CAPE treatment suppressed the activating phosphorylation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase at Tyr 458, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 at Ser 241, mammalian target of rapamycin at Ser 2448 and AKT at Ser 473 in B16F0 and SK-MEL-28 cells in a concentration and time-dependent study. Furthermore, the expression of XIAP, survivin and BCL-2 was downregulated by CAPE treatment in both cell lines. Significant apoptosis was observed by CAPE treatment as indicated by cleavage of caspase-3 and poly (ADP ribose) polymerase. AKT kinase activity was inhibited by CAPE in a concentration-dependent manner. CAPE treatment increased the nuclear translocation of XIAP, indicating increased apoptosis in melanoma cells. To confirm the involvement of reactive oxygen species in the inhibition of AKT/XIAP pathway, cells were treated with antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) prior to CAPE treatment. Our results indicate that NAC blocked CAPE-mediated AKT/XIAP inhibition and protected the cells from apoptosis. Because AKT regulates XIAP, their interaction was examined by immunoprecipitation studies. Our results show that CAPE treatment decreased the interaction of AKT with XIAP. To establish the involvement of AKT in the apoptosis-inducing effects of CAPE, cells were transfected with AKT. Our results revealed that AKT overexpression attenuated the decrease in XIAP and significantly blocked CAPE-mediated apoptosis. Similarly, overexpression of XIAP further decreased CAPE-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our results suggest that CAPE suppresses phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT/XIAP pathway leading to apoptosis in melanoma tumor cells in vitro and in vivo.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer with estimated 48,000 deaths per year worldwide. The polyphenol curcumin derived from the plant Curcuma longa is well known for its anti-inflammatory and anti-cancerogenic properties. Accordingly, dietary intake of this compound may be suitable for melanoma prevention. However, how this compound affects basic cellular mechanisms in developing melanoma still remains elusive. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate for the first time the impact of oral curcumin administration on the miRNA signature of engrafting melanoma. For this purpose, the effects of a 4% curcumin diet were tested on melanoma, which were established by injection of murine B78H1 cells in the flank of C57BL/6 mice. Curcumin diet or standard chow (control) was administered two weeks prior to injection of tumor cells until termination of the experiment. High throughput chip-based array analysis was deployed to detect alterations in the miRNA signature of the tumors. Curcumin treatment significantly reduced the growth of the flank tumors. Furthermore the miRNA expression signature in tumors was substantially altered by curcumin intake with mmu-miR-205-5p over 100 times higher expressed when compared to controls. The expression levels of identified key miRNAs in the tumor samples were confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). A comparable expression pattern of these miRNAs was also detected in other curcumin-treated melanoma cell lines under in vitro conditions. Putative targets of curcumin-induced up-regulated miRNAs were enriched in 'o-glycan biosynthesis', 'endoplasmatic reticulum protein processing' and different cancer-related pathways. Western Blot analyses revealed that of these targets anti-apoptotic B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were significantly down-regulated in curcumin-treated tumors. These findings demonstrate a profound alteration of the miRNA expression signature in engrafting curcumin-treated melanoma with mmu-miR-205-5p being up-regulated most significantly. ",

Vemurafenib treatment led to the release of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) from the melanoma cells that increased the differentiation state of the fibroblasts, an affect associated with fibronectin deposition, increase in α-smooth muscle actin expression, and the release of neuregulin (NRG). At the same time, vemurafenib directly activated the fibroblasts through paradoxical stimulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, causing them to secrete hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Treatment with the BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination reversed the release of HGF. Adhesion of melanoma cells to fibronectin was critical in amplifying the fibroblast-derived NRG- and HGF-mediated PI3K/AKT (phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/AKT) survival signaling in the melanoma cells following BRAF inhibition. In coculture studies, combination treatment with inhibitors of BRAF/MET/HER kinase was ineffective at reversing the fibroblast-mediated therapeutic escape from BRAF inhibition. Instead, it was noted that combined BRAF/PI3K inhibition overcame fibroblast-mediated drug resistance in vitro and was associated with enhanced antitumor effects in an in vivo xenograft model. Thus, we show that melanoma cells and fibroblasts remodel their microenvironment in response to BRAF inhibition and that these adaptations allow tumor cells to evade therapy through increased PI3K/AKT survival signaling.

Mutational screening of the tumor revealed a number of driver mutations in oncogenes which enabled melanoma classification into a few molecular subtypes. BRAF is a key component of mitogen-activated kinase pathway; its activating mutation leads to accelerated melanoma cells proliferation, invasion and survival. Somatic mutations in BRAF were reported in various malignancies, including thyroid cancer, colorectal cancer and melanoma. Specific features of BRAF-positive tumors could have clinical implications as mutational alterations may have an impact on the biological behavior of the tumor and prognosis of the disease. In the present study, the frequency of BRAF V600E mutation was evaluated in Russian patients with melanocytic lesions, of which 41.25% were primary melanoma and 60% were melanocytic nevi. Melanoma patients with trunk localization were of younger age in the BRAF-positive group as compared with BRAF-negative patients. Immunohistochemical evaluations of Ki-67 expression, as well as matrix metalloproteinase-2, -9, were found to be equal in BRAF-positive and BRAF-negative tumors. MMP-2/MMP-9 immunoreactivity was observed in stromal and/or melanocytic cells both in melanoma and nevi patients. Besides tumor cells, MMP-9 expression was observed in lymphocytes in 27.2% of BRAF-positive and in 19.1% of BRAF-negative patients. Histopathological prognostic markers (Breslow thickness, mitotic index, ulceration, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes pattern) did not show any differences depending on BRAF V600E mutational status. The frequency of BRAF-positive melanomas in Russian cohort is similar to other Caucasian population rates.

Tumor cells may escape from NK lysis by counteracting NK cytotoxicity activating signals with inhibitory ones. Among the molecules that mediate an NK inhibitory signal, HLA-G1, a non-classical MHC Class I antigen, is of particular interest. HLA-G1 is ectopically expressed in various tumors, including melanoma and constitutes the major NK inhibitory ligand in the M8 melanoma cell line when coexpressed with HLA-A, -B, -C and -E molecules. We have evaluated the balance between 2 powerful signals that affect NK cell tumor lysis, one inhibitory and the other one activating, respectively HLA-G1 and MICA. For this purpose, we transfected the M8 melanoma cell line, which spontaneously expresses MICA, with HLA-G1 cDNA, using it as a target for the NKL effector. We carried out cytotoxicity assays, using antibodies that disrupt interactions between the MICA and HLA-G1 ligands and their respective NK effector counterparts, the NKG2D activating and ILT2 inhibitory receptors. Results showed that 1) MICA expressed in the M8 melanoma cell line triggered NK cell tumor lysis and 2) HLA-G1 coexpression mediated the inhibition of NK cytotoxicity by mitigating the MICA activating signal. HLA-G1 expression in a tumor cell line in which MICA is switched on would therefore appear to be a powerful way to turn off NK cells, supporting the emerging idea that the balance between positive and negative NK cytolysis signals critically influences tumor progression.",

However, several other molecular mechanisms might be related directly and/or indirectly to these changes, including microRNA (miRNA) regulation and DNA methylation.;To further explore the epigenetic mechanisms potentially underlying the phenotypic changes that occur after exposing metastatic melanoma cells to a hESC microenvironment.;A total of 365 miRNAs were screened using the TaqMan® Low Density Arrays. We also evaluated whether DNA methylation could be one of the factors regulating the expression of the inhibitor of Nodal, Lefty, in hESCs (where it is highly expressed) vs melanoma cells (where it is not expressed).;Using these experimental approaches, we identified miRNAs that are up- and down-regulated in melanoma cells exposed to a hESC microenvironment, such as miR-302a and miR-27b, respectively. We also demonstrate that Notch4 is one of the targets of miR-302a, which is upstream of Nodal. Additionally, one of the mechanisms that might explain the absence of the inhibitor of Nodal, Lefty, in cancer cells is silencing by DNA methylation, which provides new insights into the unregulated expression of Nodal in melanoma.;These findings suggest that epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation and regulation by microRNAs might play a significant role in tumor cell plasticity and the metastatic phenotype.",

To test this hypothesis, we transfected human A375P melanoma cells that do not express IL-10 with the murine IL-10 gene and subsequently analyzed for changes in tumor growth and metastasis in nude mice. Surprisingly, IL-10 gene transfer resulted in a loss of metastasis and significant inhibition of tumor growth. In addition, the growth of other murine or human melanoma cells was also inhibited when they were admixed with IL-10-transfected cells before injection into nude mice. We provide evidence that IL-10 exerts its antitumor and antimetastatic activity by inhibiting angiogenesis in vivo. The in vivo decrease in neovascularization found in IL-10-secreting tumors is most likely due to the ability of IL-10 to downregulate the synthesis of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-6, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in tumor-associated macrophages. Other studies have shown that IL-10 inhibits tumor metastasis through a natural killer (NK) cell-dependent mechanism. The inhibitory effects of IL-10 on tumor growth and metastasis were also demonstrated in other tumor models, including breast cancers. Furthermore, administration of rIL-10 into mice resulted in inhibition of tumor metastasis. Because IL-10 has little toxicity when given systemically to human volunteers, its efficacy as an antimetastatic agent should be further explored, both as an independent and in combination with other inhibitors of neovascularization.",

However, the relevance of down-regulation remains in question in terms of frequency of occurrence. Moreover the functional significance of epitope down-regulation, defining the relationship between MHC/epitope density and CTL interactions, is a matter of controversy, particularly with regard to whether the noted variability of expression of MHC/epitope occurs within a range likely to affect target recognition by CTLs. In this study, bulk metastatic melanoma cell lines originated from 25 HLA-A*0201 patients were analyzed for expression of HLA-A2 and MAAs. HLA-A2 expression was heterogeneous and correlated with lysis by CTLs. Sensitivity to lysis was also independently affected by the amount of ligand available for binding at concentrations of 0.001 to 1 mM. Natural expression of MAA was variable, independent from the expression of HLA-A*0201, and a significant co-factor determining recognition of melanoma targets. Thus, the naturally occurring variation in the expression of MAA and/or HLA documented by our in vitro results modulates recognition of melanoma targets and may (i) partially explain CTL-target interactions in vitro and (ii) elucidate potential mechanisms for progressive escape of tumor cells from immune recognition in vivo.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Determinants of T cell responses to tumor cells remain largely unknown. In the present study we have used long-term cultures of human melanoma cells and autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes to examine the influence of cytokines with T cell growth activity on the phenotype and cytotoxic and proliferative response of T cells to melanoma. It was found that addition of interleukin-4 (IL-4) inhibited the response of CD8+ T cells and promoted the response of the CD4 subset. IL-2 or IL-7 was effective in increasing melanoma-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity in cultures where CD8 T cells were predominant, whereas IL-4 followed by IL-2 was most effective in cultures where CD4 T cells predominated. IL-10 or IL-12 inhibited proliferation and CTL activity against melanoma in long-term cultures. The effects of IL-12 were reproduced in long-term cultures of T cells stimulated with mAb against CD3 and were shown to depend on prior exposure of T cells to IL-12 before IL-2. As yet unidentified factors, such as co-factor expression on melanoma, appear to be as important as exogenous cytokines in determining the nature of T cell responses to melanoma. These results suggest that analysis of responses in long-term culture may assist in defining the role of key cytokines and other determinants of immune responses to melanoma.",

As the abrogation of FOXO function is a key feature of many tumor cells, regulation of FOXO factors is receiving increasing attention in cancer research. In order to discover genes involved in the regulation of FOXO activity, we performed a large-scale RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) screen using cell-based reporter systems that monitor transcriptional activity and subcellular localization of FOXO. We identified genes previously implicated in phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling events, which are known to be important for FOXO function. In addition, we discovered a previously unrecognized FOXO-repressor function of TRIB2, the mammalian homolog of the Drosophila gene tribbles. A cancer-profiling array revealed specific overexpression of TRIB2 in malignant melanoma, but not in other types of skin cancer. We provide experimental evidence that TRIB2 transcript levels correlate with the degree of cytoplasmic localization of FOXO3a. Moreover, we show that TRIB2 is important in the maintenance of the oncogenic properties of melanoma cells, as its silencing reduces cell proliferation, colony formation and wound healing. Tumor growth was also substantially reduced upon RNAi-mediated TRIB2 knockdown in an in vivo melanoma xenograft model. Our studies suggest that TRIB2 provides the melanoma cells with growth and survival advantages through the abrogation of FOXO function. Altogether, our results show the potential of large-scale cell-based RNAi screens to identify promising diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets.",

Dysfunction of DCoH/PCD is associated with the human disorders hyperphenylalaninemia and vitiligo. In Xenopus, overexpression of the protein during development induces ectopic pigmentation. In this study loss of function experiments using DCoH/PCD-specific antibodies demonstrated that the protein is also absolutely necessary for pigment cell formation in Xenopus. In normal human skin DCoH/PCD protein is weakly expressed in the basal layer of the epidermis that consists of keratinocytes and melanocytes. Whereas only 4 of 25 benign nevi reacted with DCoH/PCD-specific antibodies, high protein levels were detectable in melanoma cell lines and 13 of 15 primary malignant melanoma lesions. The comparison with the commonly used melanoma markers S100 and HMB45 demonstrated that DCoH/PCD has an overlapping but distinct expression pattern in melanoma lesions.

We previously reported that Mitf expression, as detected by immunohistochemical analysis, is an independent prognostic marker in patients with intermediate-thickness melanoma. However, the clinical significance of Mitf expression in melanoma is not well delineated. In this prospective study, we attempted to demonstrate the correlation between Mitf expression in primary melanoma and the sentinel lymph node status and prognosis. We prospectively examined primary cutaneous melanomas from 94 patients undergoing nodal staging by sentinel lymph node biopsy. We quantified the percentage of tumor cells whose nuclei stained with the Mitf antibody visually. Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The correlation between Mitf expression and nodal status was evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Here we demonstrate that Mitf expression is directly correlated with both disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) over a median follow-up of 28.5 months. The mean DFS and OS in the eight patients whose melanomas did not stain positive for Mitf were 15.75±3.36 months (median, 12 months) and 38.17±5.18 months (median, 29 months), respectively. These results are significantly lower than those for patients who showed evidence of Mitf expression, in whom the mean DFS and OS were 66.1±4.03 months (median, not reached, P=0.0001) and 66.75±38.17 months (median, not reached, P=0.0001), respectively. The mean DFS and OS with greater than 25% (67 patients) of the melanoma cells staining positive for Mitf expression were 78.37±2.78 and 82.38±1.6 months, respectively, compared with 26.37±3.2 months (P=0.0001) and 44.53±4.5 months (P=0.0001), respectively, with up to 25% (27 patients) of cells stained positive for Mitf expression. In addition, there was a significant relationship between Mitf expression and nodal status, as evaluated by sentinel node biopsy. For example, none of the melanomas with greater than 50% Mitf expression had a positive sentinel node biopsy. Our study shows that expression of the molecular marker Mitf in primary cutaneous melanomas is a useful tool in assessing lymph node status. Mitf immunostaining in the primary tumor serves as a reliable predictor of occult lymph node metastases, as well as a favorable prognosticator of DFS and OS in melanoma patients. ",

Increased expression of uPAR is associated with metastasis in several tumor types. We studied the biological role of uPAR in melanoma and found that inhibition of uPAR via RNA interference induced massive death in three different metastatic cell lines. Annexin-V staining and caspase activation analysis revealed induction of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. The expression of members of the Bcl-2 family (Bax, Bcl-2, Bak and Bcl-x(L)) was changed in a pro-apoptotic manner. uPAR inhibition induced the expression of the tumor suppressor p53 and of its downstream target gene p21. Inhibition of p53 rescued cells from apoptosis indicating that p53 was critical for apoptosis induction. Apoptosis was observed in melanoma cells carrying activating BRAF mutations and occurred in the presence of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. uPAR can activate focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which is implicated in adhesion-dependent tumor cell survival. However, inhibition of FAK did not induce apoptosis. Our data suggest a new function of uPAR acting as a survival factor for melanoma by downregulating p53. Inhibition of uPAR induces a pro-apoptotic signalling pathway via p53 that is independent of ERK or FAK signalling. These findings may offer new treatment strategies for metastatic melanoma.",

In 7 cases the tumor infiltrated the optic nerve. Expression of p16 was studied by immunohistochemistry and recorded by assessment of the proportion of positive tumor cells and staining intensity. Results were expressed as staining index (IRS). Intragenic mutations were studied by PCR-SSCP followed by sequencing, while hypermethylation of the promoter region by CpG methylation assay. In 15% of cases less than 10% of melanoma cells were p16 positive, in 70% of cases less than 50% of cells, while in 7% more than 80% of cells stained for p16 (mean IRS for all cases was 4.87 +/- 2.43).

Recent studies have demonstrated that MB exhibits profound phototoxicity affecting a variety of tumor cell lines. However, the mechanistic explanation for methylene-blue-mediated photodynamic therapy (MB-PDT) in the context of melanoma therapy is still obscure. In the present study, B16F1 melanoma cells were treated by MB-PDT under different conditions, and thereafter subjected to cell viability detection assays. MB-PDT could induce intense apoptotic cell death through a series of steps beginning with the photochemical generation of reactive oxygen species that activate the caspase-9/caspase-3 apoptosis pathway. Blocking activation of caspase-3 and induction of oxidative stress by caspase inhibitor and by glutathione, respectively, markedly reduced apoptotic cell death in vitro. Importantly, proteomics study defining altered protein expression in treated cells suggests the involvement of several mitochondrial proteins playing important roles in electron transfer chain, implying mitochondrial dysfunction during the treatment. Furthermore, a transplantable mouse melanoma model was utilized to estimate the effectiveness of MB-PDT in vivo. The treated mice displayed decreased tumor size and prolonged survival days, which was associated with enhanced apoptotic cell death.

We recently reported that the induction of profound unresponsiveness in a T cell clone by melanoma cells expressing MHC class II antigens may provide a mechanism for these tumor cells to escape immunosurveillance. Here we demonstrate that two T cell clones (sTC3 and sTS5) produced high amounts of IL-10 after being rendered anergic by autologous melanoma cells. Co-culture of these T cell clones with melanoma cell transfectants expressing B7, which failed to induce anergy, resulted in a significantly lower production of IL-10. IL-10 production by the anergic T cell clones correlated with an impaired ability to produce IL-2 in response to TCR mediated activation. Neutralization of IL-10 reduced the duration of T cell unresponsiveness from 14 to only 4 days, but inhibition of IL-10 production during initiation of anergy showed no effect on it. Induction of the unresponsive state, as well as the subsequent IL-10 production in sTC3 cells, could be prevented by the addition of cyclosporin A to the primary co-culture of sTC3 and the autologous melanoma. Taken together, these results indicate that IL-10 is important for maintenance of T cell anergy induced by contact with nonprofessional antigen presenting cells such as MHC class II+ melanoma cells.

ACT results in the repopulation of the host with high frequencies of tumor-specific T cells; however, optimal function of these cells within the tumor micro-environment is required to reach long-term tumor clearance. We and others have shown that ongoing anti-tumor immune responses can be impaired by the expression of ligands, such as PD-L1 (B7-H1) on tumor cells. Such inhibitory molecules can affect T cells at the effector phase via their receptor PD-1. PD-L1/PD-1 interaction has indeed been shown crucial in inducing T-cell anergy and maintaining peripheral tolerance. In order to maximize anti-tumor responses, antibodies that target the PD-1/PD-L1 axis are currently in phase I/II trials. Alternatively, a more refined approach could be the selective targeting of PD-1 in tumor-specific T cells to obtain long-term resistance against PD-1-mediated inhibition. We addressed whether this goal could be achieved by means of retroviral siRNA delivery. Effective siRNA sequences resulting in the reduction of surface PD-1 expression led to improved murine as well as human T-cell immune functions in response to PD-L1 expressing melanoma cells. These data suggest that blockade of PD-1-mediated T-cell inhibition through siRNA forms a promising approach to achieve long-lasting enhancement of tumor-specific T-cell function in adoptive T-cell therapy protocols.",

The cytokine-gene-transfected B16 melanoma cells showed stronger adhesion to the lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells or cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), and higher sensitivity to cytotoxicity of LAK cells or CTL. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, we found that both MHC class I and ICAM-1 expression were increased after IL-2, IL-4 or IL-6 gene transfection. The increased level of MHC class I and ICAM-1 expression seems to be responsible for the high sensitivity of these gene-transfected B16 cells to LAK or CTL cytotoxicity because anti-(MHC class I) or anti-ICAM-1 mAb could inhibit the adhesion and cytotoxicity increment simultaneously. The CTL induction was partly inhibited by anti-ICAM-1 mAb and was completely blocked by anti-MHC class I mAb. These results suggested that the decreased tumorigenicity of IL-2-, IL- 4-, and IL-6-gene-transfected B16 melanoma cells may be partly due to the increased sensitivity to effector cell cytotoxicity mediated by increased expression of ICAM-1 or MHC class I molecules on the tumor cell surface after cytokine gene transfection.",

Eleven subjects received from three to 13 immunizations. Toxicities were restricted to grade 1-2 skin reactions at inoculation sites. Vaccination elicited local dendritic cell infiltrates and stimulated T cell-mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions to irradiated, autologous tumor cells. Antibody responses to tissue-type plasminogen activator (tTPA) and angiopoietins-1/2 were detected. Tumor biopsies showed programmed death-1 (PD-1)-positive CD8(+) T cells in association with PD ligand-1 (PD-L1)-expressing sarcoma cells.

        "Doc_abstract":"In melanoma, several signaling pathways are constitutively activated. Among these, the protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathways are activated through multiple signal transduction molecules and appear to play major roles in melanoma progression. Recently, it has been reported that tamoxifen, an anti-estrogen reagent, inhibits PKC signaling in estrogen-negative and estrogen-independent cancer cell lines. Thus, we investigated whether tamoxifen inhibited tumor cell invasion and metastasis in mouse melanoma cell line B16BL6. Tamoxifen significantly inhibited lung metastasis, cell migration, and invasion at concentrations that did not show anti-proliferative effects on B16BL6 cells. Tamoxifen also inhibited the mRNA expressions and protein activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Furthermore, tamoxifen suppressed phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and Akt through the inhibition of PKCalpha and PKCdelta phosphorylation. However, other signal transduction factor, such as p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) was unaffected. The results indicate that tamoxifen suppresses the PKC/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/ERK and PKC/phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways, thereby inhibiting B16BL6 cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. Moreover, tamoxifen markedly inhibited not only developing but also clinically evident metastasis. These findings suggest that tamoxifen has potential clinical applications for the treatment of tumor cell metastasis.",

IP-10 has been recently demonstrated to be a potent angiostatic protein in vivo. Whether IP-10 exerts its angiostatic function through binding to CXCR3, glycosaminoglycans, or both, is not clear. To clarify this issue, we created expression constructs for mutants of IP-10 that exhibit partial (IP-10C) or total (IP-10C22) loss of binding to CXCR3 or loss of binding to glycosaminoglycans (IP-10H and IP-10C22H). The A375 human melanoma cell line was transfected with these expression vectors, and stable clones were selected and inoculated subcutaneously into nude mice. As expected, tumor cells secreting wild-type IP-10 showed remarkable reduction in tumor growth compared to control vector-transfected tumor cells. Surprisingly, mutation of IP-10 resulting in partial loss of receptor binding (IP-10C), or loss of GAG binding (IP-10H), did not significantly alter the ability to inhibit tumor growth. This tumor growth inhibition was associated with a reduction in microvessel density, leading to the observed increase in both tumor cell apoptosis and necrosis. In contrast, expression of the IP-10C22 mutant failed to inhibit melanoma tumor growth. These data suggest that CXCR3 receptor binding, but not glycosaminoglycan binding, is essential for the tumor angiostatic activity of IP-10. We conclude that the arginine 22 amino acid residue of IP-10 is essential for both CXCR3 binding and angiostasis.",

The aims of this study were to investigate PITX1 gene expression in patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma and to evaluate its potential relevance to clinicopathological characteristics and tumor cell proliferation. Clinicopathological findings of patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma were analyzed retrospectively. PITX1 and Ki-67 expression were detected by immunohistochemistry in malignant melanoma and healthy tissue samples from each patient. Labeling indices were calculated based on PITX1 gene and Ki-67 expression. The correlation between PITX1and Ki-67 expressions was analyzed in cutaneous malignant melanoma cases. The relationship between PITX1 expression intensity and clinicopathological characteristics was also analyzed. PITX1 expression was observed in all (100%) normal healthy skin tissue samples. In addition, PITX1 expression was found in 56 (80%) and was absent in 14 (20%) of the 70 cutaneous malignant melanoma cases. Ki-67 positive expression was only detected in the 14 (20%) PITX1-negative cases. PITX1-positive tumor cells were observed on the surface, but Ki-67 positive tumor cells were observed in deeper zones of the tumor nests. PITX1 expression was downregulated in human cutaneous malignant melanoma lesions compared with healthy skin tissue, but Ki-67 expression was upregulated in concordance with the progression of cutaneous malignant melanoma.

Primary uveal melanoma can be treated with a variety of therapies that may limit the growth of the primary tumor in the eye and partially preserve vision. However, none of these treatment modalities prevents the development of metastases, which predominantly arise in the liver and universally remain fatal. Novel therapies are being explored for their effectiveness against uveal melanoma metastases and immunotherapy may be a potential option as an alternative or adjunctive treatment, even in the prophylactic setting. Uveal melanoma may be particularly responsive to T-cell-based immunotherapy because it originates in the immune-privileged eye. The localization of the primary tumor in the immune-privileged eye excuses the tumor cells from continuous immunological pressure. This may render primary uveal melanoma more immunogenic than tumor cells from non-privileged sites and allow expression of novel tumor antigens to which the patient's endogenous T cell repertoire is not tolerized. The clinical and genetic differences between cutaneous and uveal melanomas underscore the need for immunotherapy specifically designed for uveal melanoma patients. In this review, the current developments in the field of immunotherapy for uveal melanoma are discussed, with a special emphasis on T-cell-based strategies.",

The embryonic antigens are usually encoded by ES cell-specific genes, a number of which are associated with tumorigenesis and/or tumor progression. We examined the expression of ES cell-specific genes in the mouse B16 melanoma cell line to identify the factors promoting tumorigenesis. We found that endogenous growth-differentiation factor 3 (GDF3) expression was induced in implant B16 tumor during tumor progression in syngenic C57BL/6 mice. B16 F10, a subline with a high metastatic potential, continuously expressed GDF3 while low metastatic B16 F1 expressed comparatively decreased levels of GDF3. Overexpression of GDF3 promoted growth of implanted melanoma B16 F1 and F10 in syngenic mice. Ectopic expression of GDF3 was accompanied by an increased level of production of CD24/CD44. Such a profile was reported to be characteristic of melanoma stem cell-like cells. GDF3 expression was observed in embryonal carcinomas, primary testicular germ cell tumors, seminomas and breast carcinomas. However, the role of GDF3 in these cancers remains undetermined. Overexpression of GDF3 did not affect the growth of mouse hepatoma high or low metastatic sublines G5 or G1, both of which do not express GDF3. Since GDF3-driven CD24 acts as a receptor for endogenous innate immune ligands that modulate cell proliferation, CD24 is an effective determinant of tumorigenesis in malignant cell transformation. Finally, our results support the view that GDF3 has the ability to induce progression of CD24-inducible melanoma in mice.",

In the present study, we have extended these observations to include a highly invasive and metastatic melanoma cell line (C8161) which expresses a comparable amount of the alpha 5 beta 1 integrin (classic fibronectin receptor), but very little alpha v beta 3 integrin on its surface. When perturbed with an anti-alpha 5 beta 1 antibody, C8161 cells are 89% more invasive in vitro, and express and secrete increased levels of the gelatinase A. These changes were not elicited using antibodies to the alpha v beta 3 integrin. In addition, a 73% increase in invasion of C8161 cells through a fibronectin-enhanced matrix occurred, which could be abrogated by neutralizing antibodies to gelatinase A. Furthermore, we attempted to transiently mimic the invasive phenotype of the C8161 cells by diminishing the alpha v beta 3 integrin from the A375M cell surface through fluorescence-activated cell sorting selection or deoxynojirimycin treatment, and found these cells to be 30-50% more invasive than the parental population.

Germline mutations within the p16INK4 gene have also been described in a proportion of familial melanoma kindreds, suggesting that p16INK4 is the 9p21 \"melanoma\" gene. We have previously concluded that deletion of this chromosomal region can occur early (before metastasis) and in vivo in sporadic melanoma due to the identification of identical hemizygous losses on 9p21 in six autologous melanoma cell lines established from an individual patient (DX). These related cell lines have now been used to evaluate the timing of deletion/mutation of the p16INK4 and p15INK4B genes during tumor progression in melanoma. Surprisingly, homozygous deletions of a < or = 200-kb region surrounding p15INK4B, but not p16INK4, were detected in all six cell lines. Furthermore, single strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing analysis of the remaining p16INK4 allele in each case revealed only one intragenic mutation (in DX-6), whereas Western analysis provided evidence that p16INK4 protein was expressed in all six instances. These findings, taken together with those generated on other unrelated melanoma tumors and cell lines, suggest that hemizygous loss (or haplo-insufficiency) of the p16INK4 gene may be enough to place a melanocyte on a tumor pathway, and/or that the p16INK4 gene is not the sole 9p21 locus targeted in sporadic melanoma.",

Previously, we showed that the sesquiterpene lactone, dehydroleucodine (DhL), promotes the accumulation of DNA damage markers, such as H2AX and 53BP1, in human tumor cells. Also DhL was shown to trigger either cell senescence or apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner in HeLa and MCF7 cells. Here, we evaluated the effects of DhL on B16F0 mouse melanoma cells in vitro and in a pre-clinical melanoma model. DhL inhibited the proliferation of B16F0 cells by inducing senescence or apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. Also, DhL reduced the expression of the cell cycle proteins cyclin D1 and B1 and the inhibitor of apoptosis protein, survivin. In melanomas generated by subcutaneous injection of B16F0 cells into C57/BL6 mice, the treatment with 20 mg DhL /Kg/day in preventive, simultaneous and therapeutic protocols reduced tumor volumes by 70%, 60% and 50%, respectively. DhL treatments reduced the number of proliferating, while increasing the number of senescent and apoptotic tumor cells. To estimate the long-term effects of DhL, a mathematical model was applied to fit experimental data. Extrapolation beyond experimental time points revealed that DhL administration following preventive and therapeutic protocols is predicted to be more effective than simultaneous treatments with DhL in restricting tumor growth.",

Here we report on the occurrence of components of the PA system in the various stages of human melanoma tumor progression in situ.

Here we report in vivo evidence supporting a critical role for MC1R in regulating melanoma tumor growth and determining overall survival time. Inhibition of MC1R by its physiologically relevant competitive inhibitor, agouti signaling protein (ASIP), reduced melanin synthesis and morphological heterogeneity in murine B16-F10 melanoma cells. In the lungs of syngeneic C57BL/6 mice, mCherry-marked, ASIP-secreting lung tumors inhibited MC1R on neighboring tumors lacking ASIP in a dose dependent manner as evidenced by a proportional loss of pigment in tumors from mice injected with 1:1, 3:1 and 4:1 mixtures of parental B16-F10 to ASIP-expressing tumor cells. ASIP-expressing B16-F10 cells formed poorly pigmented tumors in vivo that correlated with a 20% longer median survival than those bearing parental B16-F10 tumors (p=0.0005). Mice injected with 1:1 mixtures also showed survival benefit (p=0.0054), whereas injection of a 4:1 mixture showed no significant difference in survival. The longer survival time of mice bearing ASIP-expressing tumors correlated with a significantly slower growth rate than parental B16-F10 tumors as judged by quantification of numbers of tumors and total tumor load (p=0.0325), as well as a more homogeneous size and morphology of ASIP-expressing lung tumors. We conclude that MC1R plays an important role in regulating melanoma growth and morphology. Persistent inhibition of MC1R provided a significant survival advantage resulting in part from slower tumor growth, establishing MC1R as a compelling new molecular target for metastatic melanoma. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Highly metastatic and chemotherapy-resistant properties of malignant melanomas stand as challenging barriers to successful treatment; yet, the mechanisms responsible for their aggressive characteristics are not fully defined. We show that a distinct population expressing CD133 (Prominin-1), which is highly enriched after administration of a chemotherapeutic drug, dacarbazine, has enhanced metastatic potential in vivo. CD133(+) tumor cells are located close to tumor-associated lymphatic vessels in metastatic organs such as the regional lymph nodes and lung. Lymphatic endothelial cells promote the migratory activity of a CD133(+) subset to target organs and regulation of lymphatic growth efficiently modulates the metastasis of CD133(+) tumor cells. We found that lymphatic vessels in metastatic tissues stimulate chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4)(+)/CD133(+) cell metastasis to target organs by secretion of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1). The CXCR4(+)/CD133(+) cells exhibited higher metastatic activity compared with CXCR4(-)/CD133(+) cells and, importantly, blockade of CXCR4 coupled with dacarbazine efficiently inhibited both tumor growth and metastasis; dacarbazine alone could not attenuate tumor metastasis. The current study demonstrates a previously unidentified role of the lymphatic microenvironment in facilitating metastasis of chemoresistant melanoma cells via a specific chemotactic axis, SDF-1/CXCR4. Our findings suggest that targeting the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis in addition to dacarbazine treatment could therapeutically block chemoresistant CD133(+) cell metastasis toward a lymphatic metastatic niche.",

This clone recognized all melanoma cell lines tested and, to a lower extent, melanocytes, in the context of human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen A2 (HLA-A2), but it did not recognize other tumor cell types. The gene coding for the antigen recognized by this clone was identified by the screening of a melanoma complementary DNA expression library. This antigen is overexpressed in melanomas, compared with other cancer cell lines and healthy tissues, and was thus called melanoma-overexpressed antigen (meloe). Remarkably, the structure of meloe was unusual, with multiple short open reading frames (ORFs). The peptide recognized by the CTL clone was encoded by one of these ORFs, called MELOE-1. Using a specific HLA-A2/peptide tetramer, we showed a correlation between the infusion of TILs containing MELOE-1-specific T cells and relapse prevention in HLA-A2 patients. Indeed, 5 out of 9 patients who did not relapse were infused with TILs that contained MELOE-1-specific T cells, whereas 0 out of the 21 patients who relapsed was infused with such TIL-containing lymphocytes.

To develop a model for identifying mechanisms of resistance to antigen-specific CTLs, poorly immunogenic B16-F10 melanoma was transduced to express the K(b)-binding peptide SIYRYYGL as a green fluorescent protein fusion protein that should be recognized by high-affinity 2C TCR transgenic T cells. Although B16.SIY cells expressed high levels of antigen and were induced to express K(b) in response to IFN-gamma, they were poorly recognized by primed 2C/RAG2(-/-) T cells. A screen for candidate inhibitory ligands revealed elevated PD-L1/B7H-1 on IFN-gamma-treated B16-F10 cells and also on eight additional mouse tumors and seven human melanoma cell lines. Primed 2C/RAG2(-/-)/PD-1(-/-) T cells showed augmented cytokine production, proliferation, and cytolytic activity against tumor cells compared with wild-type 2C cells. This effect was reproduced with anti-PD-L1 antibody present during the effector phase but not during the priming culture. Adoptive transfer of 2C/RAG2(-/-)/PD-1(-/-) T cells in vivo caused tumor rejection under conditions in which wild-type 2C cells or CTLA-4-deficient 2C cells did not reject.

However, the intratumoral injection of AdRGD causes limited transgene expression in healthy normal tissue, due to unwanted vector spread. Herein, we describe our attempt to overcome this limitation related to the safety of HSVtk/GCV treatment by using AdRGD carrying either melanoma-specific tyrosinase (Tyr) promoter or tumor-specific telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter instead of universal cytomegalovirus promoter. Our in vitro study revealed that Tyr promoter-regulated AdRGD exhibited high transgene expression specificity for melanoma cells, and that TERT promoter-regulated AdRGD could induce efficient gene expression in tumor cells, but was relatively quiescent in normal cells. Anti-B16BL6 melanoma effects in mice injected intratumorally with AdRGD-Tyr/HSVtk or AdRGD-TERT/HSVtk, after which GCV was injected intraperitoneally for 10 days, were comparable to those in mice injected with AdRGD-CMV/HSVtk at 10 times less vector dosage. On the other hand, AdRGD-Tyr/HSVtk and AdRGD-TERT/HSVtk did not induce severe adverse effects even when they were intravenously injected into mice at 10(9) plaque-forming units (PFU), whereas mice injected with AdRGD-CMV/HSVtk at 10(8) PFU exhibited body weight reduction and serum level increase of biochemical enzymes for hepatotoxicity.

CXCR4-B16 cells demonstrated marked increases (>10-fold) in pulmonary metastasis compared with vector (pLNCX2)-B16 after i.v. and s.c. inoculation of tumor cells. The increase in metastasis could be completely inhibited by T22, a small peptide antagonist of CXCR4.

Whereas expression of CXCR4 in B16 cells dramatically enhanced pulmonary metastasis, metastasis to the lymph nodes, liver, and kidney was rare.

In general, HLA Class I expression is even further decreased on metastases. Tumor cells that loose their HLA Class I antigens become less susceptible to lysis by specific T cells, but may become more sensitive to Natural Killer cells. Loss of HLA Class I can be observed at different levels, i.e. total loss of Class I, loss of expression of one locus or one haplotype, or even one specific allele. We studied HLA expression on human uveal melanoma and observed that loss of expression of a locus or one or more alleles is a common phenomenon. However, in contrast with the commonly accepted paradigm, loss of HLA Class I expression on the uveal melanoma was not associated with tumor cell escape and a worse survival, but with a better survival of the patients involved. We hypothesize that this is due to the route of metastases formation: in uveal melanoma, spreading of metastases is purely hematogeneous, and it is quite possible that NK-cell mediated surveillance of tumor cells in the blood is the underlying mechanism. This is supported by our finding that metastases of uveal melanoma have a high HLA Class I expression, leading to our conclusion that uveal melanoma is an exception to the general rule regarding HLA Class I expression in tumor immunology.",

COX-2 expression for these cases was compared with that in the previous study including 40 non-irradiated uveal melanoma cases. COX-2 expression was also correlated with tumor regrowth after radiotherapy.;Two cases (13.3%) were positive and thirteen (86.7%) were negative for COX-2 expression. One of the positive cases had been enucleated because of tumor regrowth and one because of radiotherapy complications. There was no relationship between tumor regrowth and COX-2 expression. COX-2 expression was significantly lower in irradiated cases than in non-irradiated cases in the previous study (p<0.001).;In contrast with studies showing an increase of COX-2 expression in other irradiated malignancies, irradiation was not a factor inducing COX-2 in uveal melanomas.

Thus, we investigated whether the intratumoral heterogeneity of CTA expression is inherited at cellular level, or evolves throughout cellular replication, leading to a phenotypically unstable tumor cell population with reduced immunogenicity and/or able to escape immune control. Utilizing a previously characterized ex vivo clonal model of intratumoral heterogeneity of CTA expression in melanoma, Mel 313 MAGE-A3-low clone 5 (clone 5(M3-low)) and MAGE-A3-high clone 14 (clone 14(M3-high)) were sub-cloned and analyzed for CTA profile. Molecular assays demonstrated that levels of MAGE-A3 expression were highly conserved among generated sub-clones, as compared to parental clones. A similar behavior was identified for an extensive panel of other CTA investigated. Inherited levels of MAGE-A3 expression correlated with the extent of promoter methylation among clone 5(M3-low) and clone 14(M3-high) sub-clones analyzed. Treatment of clone 5(M3-low) with a DNA hypomethylating agent (DHA) resulted in an up-regulated expression of MAGE-A3, which was inherited at single cell level, being still detectable at day 60 in its sub-clones. Bisulfite sequencing demonstrated that also MAGE-A3 promoter methylation status was inherited among sub-clones generated from DHA-treated clone 5(M3-low) and strictly correlated with MAGE-A3 expression levels in investigated sub-clones. Similar results were obtained for additional CTA studied. Altogether our findings demonstrate that constitutive and DHA-modified CTA profiles of melanoma cells are clonally inherited throughout cellular replications, thus providing relevant insights to improve the effectiveness of CTA-based immunotherapy.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Conventional cytostatic cancer treatments rarely result in the complete eradication of tumor cells. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies focus on antagonizing the immunosuppressive activity of established tumors. In particular, recent studies of antigen-loaded dendritic cells (DCs) eliciting a specific antitumor immune response has raised the hopes of achieving the complete elimination of tumor tissue. Genistein, fingolimod and betulin have already been described as active compounds in different types of cancer. Herein, we applied an integrated screening approach to characterize both their cytostatic and their immune-modulating properties side-by-side. As will be described in detail, our data confirmed that all three compounds exerted proapoptotic and antiproliferative activity in different B16 melanoma cell lines to a given extent, as revealed by an MTT assay, CFSE and DAPI staining. However, while genistein and fingolimod also affected the survival of primary bone marrow (BM) derived DCs of C57BL/6 mice, betulin exhibited a lower cytotoxicity for BMDCs in comparison to the melanoma cells. Moreover, we could show for the first time, that only betulin caused a simultaneous, highly specific immune-stimulating activity, as measured by the IL-12p70 release of Toll-like receptor 4-stimulated BMDCs by ELISA, which was due to increased IL-12p35 mRNA expression. Interestingly, the activation of DCs resulted in enhanced T lymphocyte stimulation, indicated by increased IL-2 and IFN-γ production of cytotoxic T cells in spleen cell co-culture assays which led to a decreased viability of B16 cells in an antigen specific model system. This may overcome the immunosuppressive environment of a tumor and destroy tumor cells more effectively in vivo if the immune response is specific targeted against the tumor tissue by antigen-loaded dendritic cells. In summary, cytostatic agents, such as betulin, that simultaneously exhibit immune stimulatory activity may serve as lead compounds and hold great promise as a novel approach for an integrated cancer therapy.

Inhibition of BRAF(V600E) by oncogene targeting therapy increases overall survival of patients with melanoma, but is unable to produce many durable responses. Adaptive drug resistance remains the main limitation to BRAF(V600E) inhibitor clinical efficacy and immune-based strategies could be useful to overcome disease relapse. Tumor microenvironment greatly differs between visceral metastasis and primary cutaneous melanoma, and the mechanisms involved in the antimetastatic efficacy of BRAF(V600E) inhibitors remain to be determined. To address this question, we developed a metastatic BRAF(V600E)-mutant melanoma cell line and demonstrated that the antimetastatic properties of BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 (a research analogue of vemurafenib) require host natural killer (NK) cells and perforin. Indeed, PLX4720 not only directly limited BRAF(V600E)-induced tumor cell proliferation, but also affected NK cell functions. We showed that PLX4720 increases the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, CD69 expression, and proliferation of mouse NK cells in vitro. NK cell frequencies were significantly enhanced by PLX4720 specifically in the lungs of mice with BRAF(V600E) lung metastases. Furthermore, PLX4720 also increased human NK cell pERK1/2, CD69 expression, and IFNγ release in the context of anti-NKp30 and IL2 stimulation. Overall, this study supports the idea that additional NK cell-based immunotherapy (by checkpoint blockade or agonists or cytokines) may combine well with BRAF(V600E) inhibitor therapy to promote more durable responses in melanoma.",

Treatment of B16-FI with IFN resulted in a decrease in binding structures for NK cells and concomitantly in augmented metastasizing capacity. In line with this, activation of NK cells and Mo, which led to reduction of metastatic nodes, was less efficient with IFN-treated B16-FI, while after elimination of non-adaptive immune defense, the number of metastases increased significantly, but irrespective of IFN treatment. On the other hand, IFN-treated B16-FI cells become more prone to killing by cytotoxic T-cells (CTL). This was due to increased lysability by CTL and to increased immunogenicity; i.e., a higher frequency of B16-specific CTL was observed after immunization with IFN-treated than with untreated B16-FI. The reverse phenomenon was observed with anomalous and/or lymphokine-activated killer cells (AK/LAK). The common cause of increased antigenicity and immunogenicity may reside in increased expression of class-I and de novo expression of class-II MHC antigens after IFN treatment. Increased antigenicity and immunogenicity of IFN-treated B16-FI was reflected by significant reduction of metastatic nodes, prolonged survival and increased TD100 in animals immunized with IFN-treated vs. untreated melanoma cells. Comparison of the divergent effects of IFN treatment on B16-FI melanoma cells showed that the benefit of increased antigenicity/immunogenicity clearly outweighed the disadvantage of reduced susceptibility to non-adaptive immune defense.",

The functional assay for CCR7 protein was Ca(2+) flux stimulated by the chemokine CCL21, a CCR7-specific ligand produced by lymphatic endothelial cells. B16 tumor cells were injected into the footpad of mice. Tumor cell metastasis to draining lymph nodes was assessed by measuring messenger RNA (mRNA) for tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TRP), a melanocyte-specific enzyme, with real-time, quantitative reverse transcription-coupled polymerase chain reaction. All statistical tests were two-sided.;One week after injection into the footpad, 701-fold (95% confidence interval [CI] = 64- to 1336-fold) more TRP mRNA was detected in draining lymph nodes from CCR7-B16 cell-injected mice than in those from control cell-injected mice. Three weeks after footpad injection, 58% (11 of 19) of the draining lymph nodes from CCR7-B16 cell-injected mice and 5% (one of 19) of those from control mice showed gross metastases (P<.001). CCR7-B16 cells isolated from lymph node metastases retained functional CCR7 expression. Lymph node metastasis of CCR7-B16 cells was blocked by neutralizing anti-CCL21 antibodies (metastasis in none of five lymph nodes) but not by control immunoglobulin G (three of five). Enhanced metastasis of CCR7-B16 cells was specific for a lymphatic route because both CCR7-B16 and control cells co-injected intravenously metastasized to the lung at the same frequency.;Expression of a single chemokine receptor gene, CCR7, increased B16 cell metastasis to draining lymph nodes, suggesting that cancer cells may co-opt normal mechanisms of lymph node homing during metastasis.",

Using in silico prediction and in vitro confirmation, we identified 127 MHC ligands and analyzed the T-cell responses against these ligands via the MHC multimer-based enrichment of peripheral blood from 39 melanoma patients and 10 healthy donors. To dissect the T-cell reactivity against this large peptide library, we used combinatorial-encoded MHC multimers and observed the T-cell responses against 17 different peptide-MHC complexes in the patient group and four in the healthy donor group. We confirmed the processing and presentation of HLA-A3-restricted T-cell epitopes from tyrosinase (TQYESGSMDK) and gp100 (LIYRRRLMK) and an HLA-A11-restricted T-cell epitope from gp100 (AVGATKVPR) via the cytolytic T-cell recognition of melanoma cell lines and/or K562 cells expressing the appropriate antigen and HLA molecule.

In the present study, we attempt to clarify the mechanism by which H7, a PKC inhibitor, inhibits tumor cell invasion and metastasis in the melanoma cell line B16BL6. It was found that H7 inhibits B16BL6 cell invasion and metastasis. We also observed that H7 inhibits the mRNA expression and protein activities of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, -2, -9 and MT1-MMP. Furthermore, H7 suppresses phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). However, other signal transduction factors, such as p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1/2 (JNK1/2), were unaffected. Moreover, U0126, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, also inhibited B16BL6 cell invasion and metastasis, as well as the mRNA expression and protein activities of MMP-1, -2, -9 and MT1-MMP. This indicates that H7 inhibits signal transduction through the PKC/MEK/ERK pathway, thereby inhibiting B16BL6 cell invasion and metastasis.

Contrary to our postulate, there was greater than 4-fold increase in metastasis in animals with cirrhosis compared to controls. Intravital videomicroscopy showed that the hepatic sinusoids were narrower and more tumor cells were retained in the terminal portal vein (TPV) in cirrhotic livers. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the expression of vascular adhesion molecules was significantly increased in cirrhosis. Using confocal microscopy and the fluorescent nitric oxide (NO) probe 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate, a significantly lower level of NO release was detected in livers with cirrhosis both in basal conditions and after tumor cell arrest. Eight hours after mesenteric vein tumor cell injection, the percentage of apoptotic tumor cells in the sinusoids was 17% +/- 2% in livers with cirrhosis and 30% +/- 5% in normal livers. More mitotic and Ki-67 labeled tumor cells were seen in livers with cirrhosis. In conclusion, the changes in architecture and adhesion molecule expression in livers with cirrhosis may cause more tumor cells to arrest in the TPV.

Such oncolytic adenoviruses have been well tolerated in cancer patients, but their anti-tumor efficacy needs to be enhanced. In this regard, it should be considered that cancer cells, dependent on their tissue of origin, can differ substantially from the normal host cells to which Ads are adapted by complex virus-host interactions. Consequently, viral replication efficiency, a key determinant of oncolytic activity, might be suboptimal in cancer cells. Therefore, we have analyzed both the replication kinetics of HAdV-5 and the virus-induced transcriptome in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) in comparison to cancer cells. This is the first report on genome-wide expression profiling of Ads in their native host cells. We found that E1A expression and onset of viral genome replication are most rapid in HBEC and considerably delayed in melanoma cells. In squamous cell lung carcinoma cells, we observed intermediate HAdV-5 replication kinetics. Infectious particle production, viral spread and lytic activity of HAdV-5 were attenuated in melanoma cells versus HBEC. Expression profiling at the onset of viral genome replication revealed that HAdV-5 induced the strongest changes in the cellular transcriptome in HBEC, followed by lung cancer and melanoma cells. We identified prominent regulation of genes involved in cell cycle and DNA metabolism, replication and packaging in HBEC, which is in accord with the necessity to induce S phase for viral replication. Strikingly, in melanoma cells HAdV-5 triggered opposing regulation of said genes and, in contrast to lung cancer cells, no weak S phase induction was detected when using the E2F promoter as reporter. Our results provide a rationale for improving oncolytic adenoviruses either by adaptation of viral infection to target tumor cells or by modulating tumor cell functions to better support viral replication.",

We established ten kinds of anti-GD3 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) of the mouse IgG3 subclass by immunization with purified GD3 and melanoma cells. One of the established mAb, KM641, showed major reactivity with GD3 and minor reactivity with GQ1b out of 11 common gangliosides in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Immunostaining of gangliosides, separated on thin-layer chromatography plates, using KM641 revealed that most of the melanoma cell lines contained immunoreactive GD3 and GD3-lactone at a high level, but only the adrenal gland and the urinary bladder out of 21 human normal tissues had immunoreactive GD3. In immunofluorescence, KM641 bound to a variety of living tumor cell lines especially melanoma cells, including some cell lines to which another anti-GD3 mAb R24, established previously, failed to bind. High-affinity binding of KM641 to a tumor cell line was quantified by Scatchard analysis (Kd = 1.9 x 10(-8) M). KM641 exerted tumor-killing activity in the presence of effector cells or complement against melanoma cells expressing GD3 at a high level. Not only natural killer cells but also polymorphonuclear cells were effective as the effector cells in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Intravenous injection of KM641 markedly suppressed the tumor growth of a slightly positive cell line, C24.22 (7.2 x 10(5) binding sites/cell), as well as a very GD3-positive cell line, G361 (1.9 x 10(7) binding sites/cell), inoculated intradermally in nude mice. KM641, characterized by a high binding affinity for GD3, has the potential to be a useful agent for passive immunotherapy of human cancer.",

Nearly complete regression of multiple metastatic melanoma lesions was observed in patient 1913 following adoptive transfer of autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. The autologous 1913 melanoma cell line expressed a mutated HLA-A11 class I gene product that was recognized by the bulk tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes as well as a dominant T cell clone derived from this line. A second dominant T cell clone, T1D1, did not recognize the mutated HLA-A11 product, but recognized an allogeneic melanoma cell line that shared expression of HLA-A11 with the parental tumor cell line. Screening of an autologous melanoma cDNA library with clone T1D1 T cells in a cell line expressing the mutated HLA-A11 gene product resulted in the isolation of a p14ARF transcript containing a 2-bp deletion in exon 2. The T cell epitope recognized by T1D1, which was encoded within the frameshifted region of the deleted p14ARF transcript, was also generated from frameshifted p14ARF or p16INK4a transcripts that were isolated from two additional melanoma cell lines. The results of monitoring studies indicated that T cell clones reactive with the mutated HLA-A11 gene product and the mutated p14ARF product were highly represented in the peripheral blood of patient 1913 1 wk following adoptive transfer, indicating that they may have played a role in the nearly complete tumor regression that was observed following this treatment.",

By contrast, subcutaneous inoculation of B16F10 melanoma cells induced significant DTH responses to the alloantigens expressed on the tumor cells and stimulated brisk rejection of the subcutaneously injected tumor cells. In spite of the T suppressor cell inhibition of DTH reactivity, significant cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity could be demonstrated in lymphoid cell suspensions from hosts harboring allogeneic intraocular tumors. The demonstrated cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity is particularly noteworthy because it occurs in the face of severely suppressed DTH responsiveness and thus implies that the intracameral presentation of alloantigens evokes a precise immunoregulatory process that selectively and concomitantly modulates specific cellular immune components; one immune process (cytotoxic T lymphocyte function) is stimulated whereas the other (DTH responsiveness) is down-regulated.",

However, recent studies have shown that prominin-1 expression is not restricted to stem cells but also occurs in modified forms in many mature adult human cells. Although prominin-1 has been studied extensively as a stem cell marker, its physiological function of the protein has not been elucidated. We investigated prominin-1 function in two cell lines, primary human endothelial cells and B16-F10 melanoma cells, both of which express high levels of prominin-1. We found that prominin-1 directly interacts with the angiogenic and tumor survival factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in both the primary endothelial cells and the melanoma cells. Knocking down prominin-1 in the endothelial cells disrupted capillary formation in vitro and decreased angiogenesis in vivo. Similarly, tumors derived from prominin-1 knockdown melanoma cells had a reduced growth rate in vivo. Further, melanoma cells with knocked down prominin-1 had diminished ability to interact with VEGF, which was associated with decreased bcl-2 protein levels and increased apoptosis. In vitro studies with soluble prominin-1 showed that it stabilized dimer formation of VEGF164, but not VEGF121. Taken together, our findings support the notion that prominin-1 plays an active role in cell growth through its ability to interact and potentiate the anti-apoptotic and pro-angiogenic activities of VEGF. Additionally, prominin-1 promotes tumor growth by supporting angiogenesis and inhibiting tumor cell apoptosis.",

Tumor cells producing high levels of MCAF were significantly lysed by macrophages treated with LPS, whereas parental or control transfected cells were not.

Pretreatment of macrophages with MCAF significantly enhanced their response to low concentrations of LPS, muramyl tripeptide, and a synthetic bacterial LPP, as measured by lysis of murine melanoma cells.

This prompted us to construct E1A 13S cDNA-derived mutants that were unable to transform baby mouse kidney cells in cooperation with E1B and to test their tumor-suppressive activity in BLM human melanoma cells. Anchorage-independent growth in soft agar was reduced for those cell lines expressing the E1AdelCR2 mutant, which lacks the entire conserved region 2 (CR2) sequences, or for cells expressing the E1AcR3Ex2 mutant, which contains CR3 plus exon 2 sequences. In contrast, cell lines expressing the entire E1A wild-type (E1AWT) or only the exon 2 sequences (E1AEx2) grew like the parental BLM cells. Moreover, inoculation of nude mice with BLM cells or cells expressing E1AEx2 revealed large tumors after 2 weeks. In contrast, tumors derived from E1AdelCR2- or E1ACR3Ex2-expressing cells exhibited a substantial delay in tumor growth accompanied by a loss of E1A expression in the outgrown tumors.

In this study, we show that treatment with HDACi enhances the expression of molecules (TAP1, TAP2, LMP2, LMP7, Tapasin and MHC class I) involved in antigen processing and presentation via the MHC class I pathway in melanoma cells. HDACi treatment of B16F10 cells also enhanced cell surface expression of class I and costimulatory molecules CD40 and CD86. Enhanced transcription of these genes is associated with a significant increase in direct presentation of whole protein antigen and MHC class I-restricted peptides by TSA-treated B16F10 cells.

A phase I clinical trial of this immunization strategy in patients with disseminated melanoma revealed the consistent induction in distant metastases of dense T and B cell infiltrates that effectuated substantial tumor necrosis and fibrosis. To delineate the target antigens of this vaccine-stimulated tumor destruction, we screened a melanoma cDNA expression library with postimmunization sera from a long-term responding patient (K030). High-titer IgG antibodies recognized melanoma inhibitor of apoptosis protein (ML-IAP), a caspase antagonist containing a single baculoviral IAP repeat and a COOH-terminal RING domain. Although K030 harbored antibodies to ML-IAP at the time of study entry, multiple courses of vaccination over 4 years increased antibody titers and elicited isotype switching. Moreover, lymphocyte infiltrates in necrotic metastases included CD4+ and CD8+ T cells specific for ML-IAP, as revealed by proliferation, tetramer, enzyme-linked immunospot, and cytotoxicity analysis. Whereas melanoma cells in densely infiltrated lesions showed strong ML-IAP expression by immunohistochemistry, lethal disease progression was associated with the loss of ML-IAP staining and the absence of lymphocyte infiltrates. These findings demonstrate that ML-IAP can serve as a target for immune-mediated tumor destruction, but that antigen-loss variants can accomplish immune escape.",

Methods The melanoma models of the BALB/c mice were established by subcutaneously injecting B16 melanoma cells. These mice were randomly divided into four groups. The treated groups received pulsed electric stimulation at pulse width of 1, 3, 5 ms, with field strength of 100 V/cm and frequency of 10 Hz for 10 minutes daily in 15 consecutive days. ECG of mice was recorded. Tumor volume was measured with vernier caliper. Morphological changes of tumors were observed by HE staining. The expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) mRNA was tested by real-time quantitative PCR, and the expression of PCNA protein was detected by immunofluorescence histochemistry. The ultrastructural changes of the cardiac tissues were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The serum levels of cardial troponin T (cTnT) and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB (CK-MB) were detected by ELISA. Results Compared with the control group, tumor volumes in all treated groups were reduced 7 days after PEFs treatment; more melanin granules in tumor cells were found in the treated groups; the expressions of PCNA mRNA and protein were down-regulated in all treated groups, and there were greater changes in the groups receiving the bigger pulse width. Myocardial injury was found in 3 ms group and 5 ms group, and the expressions of cTnT and CK-MB were significantly higher than those in the control group. Conclusion PEFs can inhibit tumor growth in melanoma-bearing mice. Increase of pulse width will aggravate myocardial injury. ",

Human cutaneous melanoma offers an excellent clinical model to study the possible contribution of such proteases to solid tumor progression because melanoma goes through a series of well defined stages in its pathogenesis; moreover, permanent cell lines have been established from these various stages. As a first step to analyzing the gelatinolytic enzymes in melanoma pathology, we examined cell lines derived from early stage primary melanomas in which patients were cured of their disease and compared the results to those obtained with cell lines established from advanced stage primary lesions or metastases (i.e., from patients who eventually succumbed to the disease). We found that 80% of cell lines examined from early stage lesions constitutively produced only the 72-kDa gelatinase A but never the 92-kDa gelatinase B. In contrast, the majority of advanced stage cell lines examined produced both the 72-kDa gelatinase A and the 92-kDa gelatinase B. Advanced stage cell lines that did not constitutively produce the 92-kDa gelatinase B could be induced to do so with transforming growth factor beta, interleukin 1 beta or 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate. In total, 0 of 5 early stage cell lines constitutively expressed the 92-kDa gelatinase B, and only 2 of 5 could be induced to produce this activity. In contrast, all advanced stage cell lines that were evaluated either constitutively or inducibly produced the 92-kDa gelatinase B. To analyze the mechanism by which 92-kDa gelatinase B production is switched on in the advanced stage melanoma cell lines, somatic cell hybrids were constructed using an advanced stage melanoma cell line as one partner and either one of two early stage cell lines as the other. Constitutive production of the 92-kDa gelatinase B in such hybrids was lost and could not be induced in such hybrids. Coculture of the early and advanced stage cell lines failed to recapitulate what was seen after somatic hybridization, and zymographic analysis of lysates from hybrid cell lines demonstrated no 92-kDa gelatinase B activity. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis demonstrated that the loss of 92-kDa gelatinase B production occurred at the level of steady-state mRNA for the enzyme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

In this study, we investigated whether interactions of KIR with their ligands on melanoma tumor cells could inhibit tumor cell lysis by NK and gamma delta T cell clones. Ligation of the NK cell receptor KIR3DL1 by HLA-Bw4 allotypes resulted in inhibition of cytotoxicity against HLA-B*4403-transfected melanomas as well as against melanomas endogenously expressing HLA-Bw4 allotypes. Similarly, interactions of KIR2DL2 or KIR2DL3 (KIR2DL2/3) with HLA-Cw3-related allotypes on melanomas resulted in decreased tumor cell lysis. We also investigated whether signaling via KIR affected melanoma recognition by CTL. Introduction of KIR3DL1 molecules into HLA-A*0201-restricted gp100-specific CTL resulted in inhibition of lysis of gp100+ melanomas co-expressing HLA-A*0201 and HLA-Bw4 allotypes.

Telomerase is thought to be essential in maintaining the proliferative capacity of tumor cells and, as a consequence, it could represent an attractive target for new anti-cancer therapies. In this study, we generated a hammerhead ribozyme composed of a catalytic domain with flanking sequences complementary to the RNA component of human telomerase and designed to cleave specifically a site located at the end of the telomerase template sequence. In vitro the ribozyme induced cleavage of a synthetic RNA substrate obtained by cloning a portion of the RNA component of human telomerase. The extent of cleavage was dependent on the ribozyme/substrate ratio as well as the Mg2+ concentration. Moreover, when added to cell extracts from two human melanoma cell lines (JR8 and M14), or three melanoma surgical specimens, the ribozyme inhibited telomerase activity in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. When the ribozyme was delivered to growing JR8 melanoma cells by (N-(1-(2,3 dioleoxyloxy)propil)-N,N,N trimethylammonium methylsulfate-mediated transfer, a marked inhibition of telomerase activity was observed. Next, the ribozyme sequence was cloned in an expression vector and JR8 cells were transfected with it. The cell clones obtained showed a reduced telomerase activity and telomerase RNA levels and expressed the ribozyme. Moreover, ribozyme transfectants had significantly longer doubling times than control cells and showed a dendritic appearance in monolayer culture. No telomere shortening, however, was observed in these clones. Overall, our results indicate that the hammerhead ribozyme is a potentially useful tool for the inactivation of telomerase in human tumors.",

The genes for IL-2 and gammaIFN were introduced retrovirally into B16 melanoma cells. Transduction with the gammaIFN, but not the IL-2, gene caused significant increases in the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens on B16-gammaIFN cells. The in vivo tumor-forming capacity of both IL-2- and gammaIFN-transduced B16 cells was drastically reduced when the cells were inoculated subcutaneously (SC) in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice. After intravenous (IV) inoculation, most of the B16-gammaIFN cells were rejected, but B16-IL-2 cells were relatively tumorigenic and formed pulmonary metastases. C57BL/6 mice bearing 4-day established parental B16 lung metastases were treated with B16 parental (B16P) unmodified cells, IL-2- or gammaIFN-modified B16 cells, or a combination of both transduced cells. Treatment consisted of a weekly intraperitoneal (IP) injection of one million irradiated (10,000 rad) tumor cells alone or in combination with exogenous IL-2 for a total of three to four injections. Immunotherapy with B16 parental or B16-IL-2 secreting cells caused a moderate reduction in the number of lung metastases. However, mice treated with gammaIFN-secreting B16 cells showed a significant reduction or complete elimination of lung metastases. There was no additive effect for combining both IL-2- and gammaIFN-modified tumor cells in the immunotherapy. Exogenous IL-2 (50,000-100,000 U/day for 3 days) caused a significant enhancement of the immunotherapeutic benefit of the vaccines. Moreover, mice treated with gammaIFN-modified B16 cells survived longer than the other groups. Twenty-five percent of these mice were tumor free and remained alive for an observation period of 4 months. The in vitro cytolytic activity of splenocytes in chromium release assays did not correlate in every case with the in vivo antitumor effect of the treatment.

Since tumor metastasis shortens patients' lifetime, establishment of therapy for anti-metastasis is very important. Osteopontin (OPN), which abundantly expressed in bone matrix, is involved in cell adhesion, migration, extracellular matrix (ECM) invasion and cell proliferation via interaction with its receptor, that is, alphavbeta3 integrin. OPN is believed to be a positive regulator of tumor metastasis in vivo. However, how OPN regulates metastasis is largely unknown. Here, we explore the role of OPN in cell migration. Serum from wild-type mice induced cell migration of B16 melanoma cells, while serum from OPN-deficient mouse suppressed this event. The presence of recombinant OPN significantly enhanced cell migration compared to albumin containing medium. OPN-induced cell migration was suppressed by inhibiting the ERK/MAPK pathway indicating that OPN-induced cell migration depends on this pathway. Overexpression of OPN in these cancer cells per se promoted cell proliferation and tended to increase B16 cell migration suggesting that OPN promotes bone metastasis by playing dual roles both in host microenvironment and in tumor cell itself. In conclusion, the elevated OPN expression in host tissue and tumor cell itself promotes tumor cell migration reading to tumor metastasis, suggesting that neutralization of OPN-induced signal might be effective in suppression of tumor metastasis.",

Using a preparation of tumor micro-fragments (TMF) established from melanoma biopsies, we characterized the tissue organization and biomarker expression by immunocytochemistry. Robust generation of TMF was established successfully and demonstrated on a broad range of primary melanoma tumors and tumor metastases. Organization and biomarker expression within the TMF were highly comparable with tumor tissue, in contrast to dissociated, cultivated tumor cells. Using isolated TMF, sensitivity to six clinically relevant chemotherapeutic drugs (dacarbazine, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, cisplatin, gemcitabine, and treosulfan) was determined by impedance spectroscopy in combination with a unique microcavity array technology we developed. In parallel, comparative analyses were performed on monolayer tumor cell cultures. Lastly, we determined the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents on TMF by impedance spectroscopy to obtain individual chemosensitivity patterns. Our results demonstrated nonpredictable differences in the reaction of tumor cells to chemotherapy in TMF by comparison with dissociated, cultivated tumor cells.

Arginine deprivation is a novel approach to target tumors which lack argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) expression. ASS is a key enzyme which converts citrulline to arginine. Tumors which usually do not express ASS include melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, some mesotheliomas and some renal cell cancers. Arginine can be degraded by several enzymes including arginine deiminase (ADI). Although ADI is a microbial enzyme from mycoplasma, it has high affinity to arginine and catalyzes arginine to citrulline and ammonia. Citrulline can be recycled back to arginine in normal cells which express ASS, whereas ASS(-) tumor cells cannot. A pegylated form of ADI (ADI-PEG20) has been formulated and has shown in vitro and in vivo activity against melanoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. ADI-PEG20 induces apoptosis in melanoma cell lines. However, arginine deprivation can also induce ASS expression in certain melanoma cell lines which can lead to in vitro drug resistance. Phase I and II clinical trials with ADI-PEG20 have been conducted in patients with melanoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, and antitumor activity has been demonstrated in both cancers.

There was more DNase I mRNA expression in the hypoxic group than in the control group (P<0.05) in vitro, and the expression of Endo G mRNA in the hypoxic groups was significantly higher than that in the control groups both in vitro and in vivo (P<0.05). VM and LPPCN cell numbers in the ischemic group were higher than those in the control group in the early stage of tumor growth. Finally, the survival time for patients whose samples showed LPPCN and VM was significantly shorter than that of patients with one or neither of those factors. We speculated that under hypoxic conditions, some melanoma cells might undergo LPPCN, thus providing a spatial foundation for VM channel formation.",

Glioblastoma cells exert their immunosuppressive effects by producing biologically active TGF-beta 2, whereas the immunosuppressive state induced by melanoma cells is TGF-beta-independent and requires direct contact between tumor cell and T cell. The TGF-beta-dependent immunosuppression is down-regulated by various protease inhibitors and up-regulated by estradiol via modulation of the production of biologically active TGF-beta 2 by glioblastoma cells leaving total activatable TGF-beta 2 unaffected. No such modulation is functional for the TGF-beta-independent pathway of immunosuppression.

Integrins are cell surface molecules which mediate cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions and are likely to be important for tumor cell survival and dissemination. The purpose of this study was to characterize the integrin and proteolytic enzyme repertoire from low (A375P), medium (A375M) and high metastatic (A375SM) human melanoma cell lines. These cell lines are also invasive through human amniotic membranes in vitro and their invasiveness parallels the reported metastatic phenotype. The types and levels of expression of the various integrin receptors were analysed by quantitative immunoprecipitation using a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed to known integrin subunits. In addition, cDNA probes to the integrin subunits were used in quantitative northern blot analysis. These data show that the integrin alpha v beta 3 increases 50- to 100-fold as these cells progress to a more metastatic phenotype. alpha 4 beta 1 levels also appeared to increase several fold, while other beta 1 integrins did not differ in their expression levels. The increased alpha v beta 3 expression in the more metastatic cells resulted in an increased adhesion to vitronectin and fibrinogen substrates in cell attachment assays. However, alpha v- and beta 3-specific antibodies did not inhibit A375 cell invasion through the amnion. Each cell line was found to release similar quantities of a 72-kDa gelatinase/type IV collagenase and tissue type plasminogen activator. These results suggest that during the progression of these tumor cells from a low to high metastatic phenotype, marked changes in integrin expression occurred which may facilitate interactions with platelets, endothelial cells and specific extracellular matrix proteins to promote metastasis.",

As for most cancers, it is melanoma metastases, rather than the primary malignancy, that is the principal cause of death. We previously showed that the introduction of a normal copy of chromosome 6 into the metastatic human melanoma cell line C8161 suppresses metastasis at a step subsequent to tumor cells entering the bloodstream. To better define the step(s) in metastasis blocked by the addition of chromosome 6 we engineered cells that constitutively express green fluorescent protein (GFP). When these tagged, chromosome 6 hybrid cells were injected intravenously into athymic mice, grossly detectable metastases did not form. However, fluorescence microscopy revealed micro-metastases (single cells or clusters of <10 cells) in the lungs, suggesting that these cells lodged in the lungs but failed to proliferate. Cells isolated from lung up to 60 days post-injection grew in culture and/or formed tumors when injected into the skin, indicating that they were still viable, but dormant. This result implies that the gene(s) on chromosome 6 interfere specifically with growth regulatory response in the lung, but not in the skin. Thus, the gene(s) responsible for metastasis suppression represents a new class of metastasis inhibitors acting at the final stages of the metastatic cascade--that is, affecting the ability of the cells to survive and proliferate at a specific secondary site.",

AMF stimulated the motility of the high-metastatic (K1735-M1) but not the low-metastatic variant (K1735-Cl.11) of the K1735 murine melanoma and increased expression of the 12-lipoxygenase enzyme predominantly in the high-metastatic counterpart. The K1735-M1 cells responded to motile stimulation with increased endogenous 12-(S)-HETE production, and, reciprocally, exogenous 12-(S)-HETE up-regulated surface gp78 and caused gp78 translocation from an intracellular perinuclear pool to tubulovesicles which extended to the cell periphery in the K1735-M1 cells exclusively.

Its product, p16, binds specifically to CDK4 and CDK6 in vitro and in vivo, inhibiting their kinase activity. CDKN2A is homozygously deleted or mutated in a large proportion of tumor cell lines and some primary tumors, including melanomas. The aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of CDKN2A and elucidate the mechanisms of p16 inactivation in a panel of 60 cell lines derived from sporadic melanomas. Twenty-six (43%) of the melanoma lines were homozygously deleted for CDKN2A, and an additional 15 (25%) lines carried missense, nonsense, or frameshift mutations. All but one of the latter group were shown by microsatellite analysis to be hemizygous for the region of 9p surrounding CDKN2A. p16 was detected by Western blotting in only five of the cell lines carrying mutations. Immunoprecipitation of p16 in these lines, followed by Western blotting to detect the coprecipitation of CDK4 and CDK6, revealed that p16 was functionally compromised in all cell lines but the one that carried a heterozygous CDKN2A mutation. In the remaining 19 lines that carried wild-type CDKN2A alleles, Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation indicated that 11 cell lines expressed a wild-type protein. Northern blotting was performed on the remaining eight cell lines and revealed that one cell line carried an aberrantly sized RNA transcript, and two other cell lines failed to express RNA. The promoter was found to be methylated in five cell lines that expressed CDKN2A transcript but not p16. Presumably, the message seen by Northern blotting in these cell lines is the result of cross-hybridization of the total cDNA probe with the exon 1beta transcript. Microsatellite analysis revealed that the majority of these cell lines were hemi/homozygous for the region surrounding CDKN2A, indicating that the wild-type allele had been lost. In the 11 cell lines that expressed functional p16, microsatellite analysis revealed loss of heterozygosity at the markers immediately surrounding CDKN2A in five cases, and the previously characterized R24C mutation of CDK4 was identified in one of the remaining 6 lines.

This risk can conceivably be overcome, at least partially, by transient transfection. The design of CARs, however, has so far not been optimized for use in non-permanent T cell modification. Here we compared the performance of T cells modified with three different first- and second-generation CARs, each specific for MCSP (HMW-MAA) which is commonly expressed by melanoma cells. Upon RNA transfer, the expression of all receptors was limited in time. The second-generation CARs, which combined CD28-CD3ζ signaling, were expressed at higher levels and more prolonged than first-generation CARs with CD3ζ only. The CD28 domain increased the cytokine production, but had only an indirect effect on the lytic capacity, by prolonging the CAR expression. Especially for the second-generation CARs, the scFv clearly impacted the level and duration of CAR expression and the T cell performance. Thus, we identified a CAR high in both expression and anti-tumor cell reactivity. T cells transfected with this CAR increased the mean survival time of mice after challenge with melanoma cells. To facilitate clinical application, this CAR was used to redirect T cells from late-stage melanoma patients by RNA transfection. These T cells mediated effective antigen-specific tumor cell lysis and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, even after cryoconservation of the transfected T cells. Taken together, the analysis identified a CAR with superior anti-melanoma performance after RNA transfer which is a promising candidate for clinical exploration.",

We examined the effect of tyrosine (Tyr) and phenylalanine (Phe), methionine (Met) or glutamine (Gln) restriction on attachment and spreading of A375 and MeWo melanoma cell lines on fibronectin and laminin. In A375 cells, restriction of Tyr/Phe or Met inhibited attachment to and spreading on laminin and fibronectin, inhibited alpha3 and alpha4 integrin expression, and inhibited accumulation of FAK-Tyr397 and F-actin at leading edges of cell protrusions. Tyr/Phe restriction also inhibited attachment-induced autophosporylation of FAK-Tyr397. In MeWo cells, the order of inhibition by amino acid restriction on cell attachment and spreading was as follows: Gln > Tyr/Phe > Met. Restriction of Gln reduced alpha5 integrin expression. All amino acid restrictions similarly inhibited phosphorylation of FAK-Tyr397, FAK-Tyr577, FAK-Tyr861 and paxillin-Tyr31. Gln restriction exhibited the strongest inhibition of actin cytoskeleton remodeling during the cell spreading. The present study reveals that specific amino acid restriction inhibits attachment and spreading of melanoma via inhibition of specific integrin expression, inhibition of integrin-mediated FAK phosphorylation, and modulation of actin cytoskeleton remodeling.

However, the molecular basis for MMP-2 overexpression in tumor cells remains unclear. In this study, by using K-1735 melanoma system, we demonstrated that highly metastatic C4, M2, and X21 tumor cells express elevated MMP-2 mRNA and enzymatic activity, whereas poorly metastatic C10, C19, and C23 tumor cells express much lower levels. Moreover, a concomitant elevated Stat3 activity has been detected in these metastatic tumor cells that overexpress MMP-2. Transfection of constitutively activated Stat3 into poorly metastatic C23 tumor cells directly activated the MMP-2 promoter, whereas the expression of a dominant-negative Stat3 in highly metastatic C4 tumor cells inhibited the MMP-2 promoter. A high-affinity Stat3-binding element was identified in the MMP-2 promoter and Stat3 protein bound directly to the MMP-2 promoter. Blockade of activated Stat3 through expression of a dominant-negative Stat3 significantly suppressed MMP-2 expression in the metastatic tumor cells. Therefore, overexpression of MMP-2 in the metastatic melanoma cells can be attributed to elevated Stat3 activity, and Stat3 upregulates the transcription of MMP-2 through direct interaction with the MMP-2 promoter. Furthermore, blockade of activated Stat3 in highly metastatic C4 cells significantly suppressed the invasiveness of the tumor cells, inhibited tumor growth, and prevented metastasis in nude mice. Collectively, these studies suggest that Stat3 signaling directly regulates MMP-2 expression, tumor invasion, and metastasis, and that Stat3 activation might be a crucial event in the development of metastasis.",

Transcriptomic alterations across resistant tumors were highly recurrent, in contrast to mutations, and were frequently correlated with differential methylation of tumor cell-intrinsic CpG sites. We identified in the tumor cell compartment supra-physiologic c-MET up-expression, infra-physiologic LEF1 down-expression and YAP1 signature enrichment as drivers of acquired resistance. Importantly, high intra-tumoral cytolytic T cell inflammation prior to MAPKi therapy preceded CD8 T cell deficiency/exhaustion and loss of antigen presentation in half of disease-progressive melanomas, suggesting cross-resistance to salvage anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy.

It was revealed that high expression of ADAM-10 positive cells was strictly related with lower intensity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (P = 0.037), which suggests that ADAM-10 regulates immunoresponse in melanoma initiation and progression. No statistically significant correlations were found between ADAM-10 expression in primary tumor cells and nodal metastases and other histopathological parameters analyzed. Decreased immunoreactivity of ADAM-10 in cancer cells from regional lymph nodes was correlated with worse prognosis; however this correlation was statistically nonsignificant (P = 0.065). Review of the literature shows that our study is the first one ever to describe the significance of ADAM-10 expression in correlation with detailed histopathological parameters of the primary tumor and data on long-term survival of cutaneous melanoma patients.

In this light, loss and down-regulation of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) class I molecules, while important for keeping tumors below the T-cell detection levels, may incite recognition of missing self. Conversely, the maintenance of normal levels of expression (or even up-regulation) may be favorable to tumors, at least in certain cases. In this study, we took advantage of a previously characterized panel of 15 early passage tumor cell lines (mainly from melanoma and lung carcinoma lesions) enriched with class I-low phenotypes. These cells were systematically characterized by Northern and/or Western blotting (e.g., mini-transcriptome/mini-proteome analysis) for the expression of HLA-A, -B, -C, beta(2)-microglobulin, and the members of the \"antigen processing machinery\" of class I molecules (LMP2, LMP7, TAP1, TAP2, tapasin, calreticulin, calnexin, and ERp57). In addition, we established four pairs of cultures, each comprising melanoma cells and normal melanocytes from the same patient. We found that approximately 97% of the 185 tested gene products are expressed (although often weakly), and in many cases coordinately regulated in 18 of 19 tumor cell lines. Linked expression patterns could be hierarchically arranged by statistical methods and graphically described as a class I HLA \"coordinome.\" Deviations (both down- and up-regulation) from the coordinome expression pattern inherited from the normal, paired melanocyte counterpart, were allowed but limited in magnitude, as if melanoma cells were trying to keep a \"low profile\" HLA phenotype. We conclude that irreversible HLA loss is a rare event, and class I expression in tumor cells almost invariably results from reversible gene regulatory (rather than gene disruption) events.",

Among them, ABCB5-expressing cells were proposed to display an enhanced tumorigenicity with stem cell-like properties. In addition, ABCB5(+) cells are thought to participate to chemoresistance through a potential efflux function of ABCB5. Nevertheless, the fate of these cells upon drugs that are used in melanoma chemotherapy remains to be clarified. Here we explored the effect of anti-melanoma treatments on the ABCB5-expressing cells. Using a melanoma xenograft model (WM266-4), we observed in vivo that ABCB5-expressing cells are enriched after a temozolomide treatment that induces a significant tumor regression. These results were further confirmed in a preliminary study conducted on clinical samples from patients that received dacarbazine. In vitro, we showed that ABCB5-expressing cells selectively survive when exposed to dacarbazine, the reference treatment of metastatic melanoma, but also to vemurafenib, a new inhibitor of the mutated kinase V600E BRAF and other various chemotherapeutic drugs. Our results show that anti-melanoma chemotherapy might participate to the chemoresistance acquisition by selecting tumor cell subpopulations expressing ABCB5. This is of particular importance in understanding the relapses observed after anti-melanoma treatments and reinforces the interest of ABCB5 and ABCB5-expressing cells as potential therapeutic targets in melanoma.",

Despite advances in the treatment of melanoma, patients with metastatic disease still have a poor prognosis and low survival rate. New strategies, including targeted radiotherapy, would provide options for patients who become resistant to therapies such as BRAF inhibitors. Very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) is expressed on melanoma tumor cells in higher levels in more aggressive and metastatic disease and may provide an ideal target for drug delivery and targeted radiotherapy. In this study, we evaluated (177)Lu- and (68)Ga-labeled DOTA-PEG4-LLP2A as a VLA-4-targeted radiotherapeutic with a companion PET agent for diagnosis and monitoring metastatic melanoma treatment. DOTA-PEG4-LLP2A was synthesized by solid-phase synthesis. The affinity of (177)Lu- and (68)Ga-labeled DOTA-PEG4-LLP2A to VLA-4 was determined in B16F10 melanoma cells by saturation binding and competitive binding assays, respectively. Biodistribution of the LLP2A conjugates was determined in C57BL/6 mice bearing B16F10 subcutaneous tumors, while PET/CT imaging was performed in subcutaneous and metastatic models. (177)Lu-DOTA-PEG4-LLP2A showed high affinity to VLA-4 with a Kd of 4.1 ± 1.5 nM and demonstrated significant accumulation in the B16F10 melanoma tumor after 4 h (31.5 ± 7.8%ID/g). The tumor/blood ratio of (177)Lu-DOTA-PEG4-LLP2A was highest at 24 h (185 ± 26). PET imaging of metastatic melanoma with (68)Ga-DOTA-PEG4-LLP2A showed high uptake in sites of metastases and correlated with bioluminescence imaging of the tumors. These data demonstrate that (177)Lu-DOTA-PEG4-LLP2A has potential as a targeted therapeutic for treating melanoma as well as other VLA-4-expressing tumors.

Human melanoma cells were transduced by two modified retroviral tet vectors containing the transactivator regulatory unit and the IL-2 gene driven by the tetO/promoter, respectively. In the absence of tet, IL-2 expression in the target cells was stable over several months. IL-2 production was in the range of 40 U/10(6) cells/24 hours. A fine tuning of IL-2 expression could be achieved by culturing the transduced cells with increasing doses of tet, whereby a concentration of 500 ng/mL tet in the culture medium abrogated IL-2 expression. Most importantly for clinical application, IL-2 expression by the transduced melanoma cells could also be regulated in vivo. When nu/nu mice were inoculated with the transduced tumor cells, they failed to develop tumors. Instead, the inhibition of IL-2 expression in the transduced tumor cells by oral administration of tet led to subcutaneous tumor growth; this growth rate was comparable with the growth rate of subcutaneously inoculated untransduced parental cells.

Even when treatment with fusion proteins was delayed up to 8 days after inoculation of tumor cells, it still resulted in complete eradication of micrometastases that were established at that time point. Selection of tumor cell lines expressing or lacking the targeted antigen of the administered fusion protein proved the specificity of the observed antitumor effect. Biodistribution analysis demonstrated that the tumor-specific fusion protein accumulated not only in subcutaneous tumors but also in lungs and livers affected with micrometastases.

IP3 accumulation and ERK1/2 activation were inhibited by pretreatment of the tumor cells with a Grm1-specific antagonist (LY367385) or by dominant negative mutants of Grm1, demonstrating the specificity of these events. We also show that ERK1/2 activation by Grm1 was PKC-dependent, but cAMP and PKA-independent. PKCepsilon was shown to play a pivotal role in Grm1-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation.

TF inhibitors may attenuate primary tumor growth and metastasis. In this study, we evaluated the effect of ixolaris, a TF inhibitor, on a murine model of melanoma B16F10 cells. Enzymatic assays performed with B16F10 and human U87-MG tumor cells as the TF source showed that ixolaris inhibits the generation of FX in either murine, human or hybrid FVIIa/TF complexes. The effect of ixolaris on the metastatic potential was further estimated by intravenous injection of B16F10 cells in C57BL/6 mice. Ixolaris (250 μg/kg) dramatically decreased the number of pulmonary tumor nodules (4 ± 1 compared to 47 ± 10 in the control group). Furthermore, a significant decrease in tumor weights was observed in primary tumor growth assays in animals treated with ixolaris (250 μg/kg) from days 3 to 18 after a subcutaneous inoculation of melanoma cells. Remarkably, immunohistochemical analyses showed that inhibition of melanoma growth by ixolaris is accompanied by a significant downregulation of both vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and microvascular density in the tumor mass. Our data demonstrate that ixolaris targets B16F10 cell-derived TF, resulting in the reduction of both the primary tumor growth and the metastatic potential of melanoma, as well as the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis.

Specifically, in this study a local model of the biochemical interactions between circulating melanoma tumor cells (TC) and substrate adherent polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) is developed. This model provides realistic three-dimensional distributions of bond formation and attendant attraction and repulsion forces that are consistent with the time dependent Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) framework of the full system model which accounts local pressure, shear and repulsion forces. The resulting full dynamics model enables exploration of TC adhesion to adherent PMNs, which is a known participating mechanism in melanoma cell metastasis. The model defines the adhesion molecules present on the TC and PMN cell surfaces, and calculates their interactions as the melanoma cell flows past the PMN. Biochemical rates of reactions between individual molecules are determined based on their local properties. The melanoma cell in the model expresses ICAM-1 molecules on its surface, and the PMN expresses the β-2 integrins LFA-1 and Mac-1. In this work the PMN is fixed to the substrate and is assumed fully rigid and of a prescribed shear-rate dependent shape obtained from micro-PIV experiments. The melanoma cell is transported with full six-degrees-of-freedom dynamics. Adhesion models, which represent the ability of molecules to bond and adhere the cells to each other, and repulsion models, which represent the various physical mechanisms of cellular repulsion, are incorporated with the CFD solver. All models are general enough to allow for future extensions, including arbitrary adhesion molecule types, and the ability to redefine the values of parameters to represent various cell types. The model presented in this study will be part of a clinical tool for development of personalized medical treatment programs. ",

We examined the expression pattern of Sox-10, as compared with S100, Melan-A, and HMB-45 in 93 lymph nodes (40 originally reported as positive and 53 originally reported as negative for metastasis) from 33 sentinel lymph node biopsies and regional lymphadenectomies.

Transcriptomes of six mouse tumors with differential response to AURKAi were analyzed by RNA sequencing, and TILs were characterized by flow cytometry. Chemokine RNA and protein expression were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Therapeutic response was queried in immunodeficient mice, in mice with CCL5-deficient tumors, and in mice cotreated with CD137 agonist to activate TILs. CCL5 expression in reference to TIS and markers of TILs was studied in human melanoma tumors using patient-derived xenografts (n = 3 patients, n = 3 mice each), in AURKAi clinical trial samples (n = 3 patients, before/after therapy), and in The Cancer Genome Atlas (n = 278). All statistical tests were two-sided.;AURKAi response was associated with induction of the immune transcriptome (P = 3.5 x 10-29) while resistance inversely correlated with TIL numbers (Spearman r = -0.87, P < .001).

Inhibition of this alternative vascularization pathway might be of clinical importance, especially as several anti-angiogenic therapies targeting endothelial cells are largely ineffective in melanoma. We show the presence of VM structures histologically in a series of human melanoma lesions and demonstrate that cell cultures derived from these lesions form tubes in 3D cultures ex vivo. We tested the ability of nicotinamide, the amide form of vitamin B3 (niacin), which acts as an epigenetic gene regulator through unique cellular pathways, to modify VM. Nicotinamide effectively inhibited the formation of VM structures and destroyed already formed ones, in a dose-dependent manner. Remarkably, VM formation capacity remained suppressed even one month after the complete withdrawal of Nicotimamid. The inhibitory effect of nicotinamide on VM formation could be at least partially explained by a nicotinamide-driven downregulation of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-Cadherin), which is known to have a central role in VM. Further major changes in the expression profile of hundreds of genes, most of them clustered in biologically-relevant clusters, were observed. In addition, nicotinamide significantly inhibited melanoma cell proliferation, but had an opposite effect on their invasion capacity. Cell cycle analysis indicated moderate changes in apoptotic indices. Therefore, nicotinamide could be further used to unravel new biological mechanisms that drive VM and tumor progression. Targeting VM, especially in combination with anti-angiogenic strategies, is expected to be synergistic and might yield substantial anti neoplastic effects in a variety of malignancies.",

Here, we isolate for the first time viable tumorigenic melanoma CTC and demonstrate that this cell population is capable of metastasis formation in human-to-mouse xenotransplantation experiments. The presence of CTC among peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of murine recipients of subcutaneous (s.c.) human melanoma xenografts could be detected based on mRNA expression for human GAPDH and/or ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 5 (ABCB5), a marker of malignant melanoma-initiating cells previously shown to be associated with metastatic disease progression in human patients. ABCB5 expression could also be detected in PBMC preparations from human stage IV melanoma patients but not healthy controls. The detection of melanoma CTC in human-to-mouse s.c. tumor xenotransplantation models correlated significantly with pulmonary metastasis formation. Moreover, prospectively isolated CTC from murine recipients of s.c. melanoma xenografts were capable of primary tumor initiation and caused metastasis formation upon xenotransplantation to secondary murine NOD-scid IL2Rγ(null) recipients. Our results provide initial evidence that melanoma CTC are tumorigenic and demonstrate that CTC are capable of causing metastatic tumor progression.

        "Doc_abstract":"The integrin multigene family, comprising at least 21 distinct heterodimeric complexes, includes receptors for all major extracellular proteins such as fibronectin, laminin, vitronectin, and collagens. These receptors play important roles in various physiological processes. Matrixmetallo-proteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases that degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM) components in physiological conditions. MMPs can degrade all structural components of the ECM, which is one of the critical aspects of tumor cell invasion. The role of matrilysin (MMP-7) in the progression of various carcinomas was recently addressed. Evidence of interplay between integrin function and ECM matrix integrity has come from experiments showing that integrin-ECM contacts can regulate expression and function of MMPs. In this communication, we report on an interesting interrelationship between cell surface alpha5beta1 integrin (fibronectin receptor) and MMPs (MMP-2 and MMP-7).;The zymographic analysis showed that ligation of cell surface alpha5beta1 integrin by alpha5 monoclonal antibody leads to the expression and activation of MMP-2 and MMP-7 in B16F10 melanoma cells. The immunoblot confirmed the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK in B16F10 cells grown in presence of alpha5 monoclonal antibody, indicating the transduction of signal via FAK. The immunocytochemical study demonstrated that alpha5beta1 integrin stimulation causes rearrangement of actin fibers and its accumulation in focal adhesion sites.;alpha5beta1 integrin-induced expression and activation of MMP-2 and -7 indicates the role of tumor cell surface integrin receptor in the modulation of MMPs and, thereby, the invasive property of tumor cells.",

In this study, we sought to establish from a large series of human melanoma metastases whether there exists a determined pattern in tumor cellular heterogeneity that may guide the development of future targeted immunotherapies.;From a cohort of 1,514 patients with metastatic melanoma, biopsies were procured over a 17-year period from 3,086 metastatic tumors involving various anatomic sites. To allow specific tumor cell profiling, we used established immunohistochemical methods to perform semiquantitative assessment for a panel of prototypic melanocyte differentiation antigens (MDA), including gp100, MART-1, and tyrosinase. To gain insight into the endogenous host immune response against these tumors, we further characterized tumor cell expression of MHC I and MHC II and, also, the concomitant CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell infiltrate.;Tumor cell profiling for MDA expression demonstrated an anatomic site-specific pattern of antigen expression that was highest in brain, intermediate in soft tissues/lymph nodes, and lowest in visceral metastases. Hierarchical clustering analysis supported that melanoma metastases have a phylogenetically determined, rather than a stochastic, pattern of antigen expression that varies by anatomic site. Furthermore, tyrosinase expression was more frequently lost in metastatic sites outside of the brain and was uniquely correlated with both endogenous CD8(+) and CD4(+) T-cell infiltrates.;Site-specific antigen heterogeneity represents a novel attribute for human melanoma metastases that should be considered in future therapy development and when assessing the responsiveness to antigen-specific immunotherapies.",

This cysteine proteinase was identified on the basis of its property to cleave human C3, the third component of complement. In an attempt to control procathepsin L secretion, we have recently generated an anti-cathepsin L single chain variable fragment (ScFv) from an anti-cathepsin L monoclonal antibody generated against recombinant cathepsin L. We herein selected clones stably transfected with this anti-cathepsin L ScFv and analyzed them for changes in tumor growth and metastasis. We show that in stably transfected clones, anti-cathepsin L ScFv strongly inhibited the secretion of procathepsin L without modifying the intracellular amount or processing pattern of cathepsin L forms. Confocal analysis demonstrated colocalization of endogenous cathepsin L and anti-cathepsin L ScFv. In addition, expression of this ScFv strongly inhibited generation of tumor and metastasis by these human melanoma clones in nude mice. In vivo, the anti-cathepsin L ScFv-transfected cells produced tumors with decreased vascularization (angiogenesis) concomitant with increased apoptosis of tumor cells. Matrigel assay also demonstrated that melanoma invasiveness was completely abolished. Thus, this is the first demonstration that anti-cathepsin L ScFv could be used to inhibit the tumorigenic and metastatic phenotype of human melanoma, depending on procathepsin L secretion, and could therefore be used as a molecular tool in a therapeutic cellular approach.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The efficient genetic modification of solid tumors in situ to stimulate therapeutic immune responses against them is currently under active investigation, but is not yet possible using existing gene transfer technologies. Thus, ex vivo/in vivo vaccination strategies have been proposed in which the patient's tumor is surgically excised, single cell suspensions are prepared, the therapeutic genes are introduced and then the gene-modified cells, after being gamma-irradiated, are injected back into the patient. However, even with high-efficiency gene delivery systems, this is a labor-intensive process. Moreover, it is often difficult to obtain sufficient numbers of gene-modified primary tumor cells during short-term culturing. On the other hand, extended in vitro passaging of primary tumor explants may alter their immunophenotypic properties. One approach to overcome these limitations would be to design universal vaccines consisting of standardized gene-transduced neoplastic cell lines or mixtures of gene-transduced cell lines to be combined with autologous tumor samples if available. Melanoma, which is notable for being one of the most immunogenic human malignancies, represents a cancer where shared tumor-associated antigens have been identified. We developed and analyzed several different retroviral vectors for their ability to stably express exogenous genes at high levels in a panel of melanoma cell lines. All vectors contained a reporter gene (nlslacZ) encoding beta-galactosidase with a nuclear localization signal and the neomycin phosphotransferase (neo) gene as selectable marker. One vector, DCCMV, which carried a bicistronic nlslacZ-neo transcriptional unit under the control of the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter in the U3 region of its 3' LTR, was found to perform consistently better than the other vectors. The DCCMV vector, which is an extreme example of the double-copy class of retroviral vectors, was subsequently used to generate melanoma cell lines constitutively secreting human interleukin-6 or a soluble form of the human interleukin-6 receptor for potential use in a phase II clinical vaccine trial for the treatment of melanoma patients. The DCCMV vector design may also be useful in gene therapy applications where the intent is to implant polymer-encapsulated cell lines genetically engineered to stably express high levels of bioactive proteins.",

As expected, most epithelial cells expressed epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr), whereas cells of hematopoietic origin were EGFr-.

Normal melanocytes and a proportion of melanomas are EGFr-, whereas a distinct subset of other melanomas, astrocytomas, and neuroblastomas is EGFr+. Expression of the EGFr in melanomas was closely related to the expression of phenotypic traits of differentiation. Less differentiated melanomas have an epithelioid morphology and are nonpigmented, Ia+, and EGFr+; in contrast, more differentiated melanomas have a dendritic morphology and are pigmented, Ia-, and EGFr-. In the melanoma cell panel used, expression of EGFr did not correlate with rate of proliferation. Expression of EGFr in tissues also showed a lack of correlation with the proliferative state of cells. Our findings indicate that expression of EGFr is related to cell lineage and specific stages of cellular differentiation, rather than only to cell proliferation.

Loss of DNMT3B results in hypomethylation of the miR-196b promoter and increased miR-196b expression, which directly targets the mTORC2 component Rictor. Loss of RICTOR in turn prevents mTORC2 activation, which is critical for melanoma formation and growth. These findings establish Dnmt3b as a regulator of melanoma formation through its effect on mTORC2 signaling. Based on these results, DNMT3B is a potential therapeutic target in melanoma. ",

Many studies have focused on the initiation of melanoma, but less is known about the effect of UVR on established tumor cells. Here, we show that after ultraviolet-B (UVB) irradiation, melanoma cells (MM) are able to secrete autocrine factors that enhance their motility. Time-lapse videomicroscopy of UVB irradiated (15 or 30 mJ/cm(2)) MM showed an initial decrease in MM cell motility one hour after irradiation, with subsequent increase 24 h after UV-B treatment. Conditioned media harvested from MM 24 h following UV-B irradiation specifically enhanced the motility of un-irradiated MM, suggesting that a newly synthesized soluble factor released by UVB MM is involved. As interleukin 8 (IL-8) is known to be up-regulated by different cell types after UV-B irradiation, we investigated IL-8 expression after UVB exposure. Quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA demonstrated an induction of IL-8 in MM by UVB (15 or 30 mJ/cm(2)), and addition of recombinant IL-8 to cell cultures enhanced cell motility to a similar degree than UVB. Importantly, blocking IL-8 activity by a neutralizing anti IL-8 antibody inhibited the up-regulation of MM motility after UVB treatment. We conclude that UVB enhances MM motility and that this effect is mediated at least in part by IL-8 released by MM in an autocrine fashion. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that UVB is not only involved in the initiation of melanoma, but may also be important for some aspects of tumor progression.",

Our current study assessed the expression levels of WT-1 protein in clinical samples, to determine whether the expression levels of the WT-1 protein may be used as a novel marker to assist differential diagnosis. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 15 cases of malignant melanomas and 25 cases of benign nevi were subjected to immunohistochemistry with a monoclonal antibody against the human WT-1 protein. The expression levels of WT-1 protein among normal, benign, and malignant melanocytes were semi-quantitatively assessed. Strong and uniform WT-1 immunoreactivities were seen in all or nearly all tumor cells in both the junctional and dermal components of all malignant melanomas, and also in a vast majority of the tumor cells of Spitz's (n = 8), recurrent (n = 2), and junction (n = 2) nevi. Distinct WT-1 immunoreactivities were also seen in some isolated individual tumor cells or tumor cell clusters in the junctional component of compound nevus (9) and in intradermal nevus (2). It is interesting to note that some isolated normal appearing melanocytes or cell clusters, and all morphologically distinct endothelial cells were strongly positive to WT-1. However, all tumor cells within the dermal component of compound (n = 9) or deep penetrating nevi (n = 1), or capsular nevus inclusion of lymph node (1) were devoid of WT-1 expression. Our findings suggest that the expression level of the WT-1 protein has no significant value in distinguishing between Spitz's nevi and malignant melanoma, but it may be a useful marker in differentiating between benign and malignant melanocytes within the dermal component.

This adhesion is predominant over integrin- or lectin-mediated adhesion in a dynamic flow experimental system employing a parallel plate laminar flow chamber (Lawrence, M. B., Smith, C. W., Eskin, S. G., and McIntire, L. V. (1990) Blood 75, 227-237). In this system, a tumor cell suspension flows over a glass plate coated with glycosphingolipid, lectin, or fibronectin, and adhesion is recorded on videotape. These conditions were designed to mimic the microvascular environment in which tumor metastatic deposition takes place. In contrast, lectin- and fibronectin-based mechanisms are predominant in previously used static adhesion systems. Under static conditions, the relative degree of adhesion of the four B16 variants to endothelial cells or to LacCer-coated plates was the same as their relative degree of GM3 expression (i.e. BL6 approximately F10 greater than F1 greater than WA4), and adhesion was inhibited in the presence of methyl-beta-lactoside, or liposomes containing LacCer or GM3. Adhesion was also inhibited by pretreatment of B16 cells with anti-GM3 antibody DH2 or sialidase and by pretreatment of endothelial cells with anti-LacCer antibody T5A7. Under dynamic flow conditions, WA4 cells did not adhere to mouse endothelial cells at high shear stress (greater than 2.5 dynes/cm2) but did adhere at lower shear stress. In contrast, BL6 and F10 cells adhered strongly at both low and high shear stress. BL6 cell adhesion to endothelial cells at both low and high shear stress was inhibited in the presence of antibody DH2, ethyl-beta-lactoside, or lactose, as well as by pretreatment of BL6 cells with sialidase. Thus, some clear differences, as well as similarities, in cell adhesion under static versus dynamic conditions are demonstrated. These findings suggest that melanoma cell adhesion to endothelial cells, based on GM3/LacCer interaction, initiates metastatic deposition, which may trigger a series of \"cascade\" reactions leading to activation of endothelial cells and expression of Ig family or selectin receptors, thereby promoting adhesion and migration of tumor cells.",

Multiple indirect arguments have supported the view that the immune system may control, at least in certain cases, malignant cell growth while direct demonstration is still lacking in the human. In an attempt to address this issue, we have selected a study model, namely spontaneously regressive melanoma. In previous series of experiments, the variability of T cell receptors (TCRs) in the lymphocytes infiltrating a regressive tumor lesion was investigated. Results demonstrated that clonal T cell populations, precisely defined through their V-D-J junctional sequences, were amplified in situ. One clone was predominant, expressing the V beta 16 variable gene segment. A specific anti-V beta 16 TCR mAb was generated here to purify and functionally characterize the corresponding cells. A tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte-derived V beta 16+ T cell line was developed using this reagent. These in vitro cultured cells were found to express the in vivo predominant TCR sequence exclusively and to display an HLA-B14-restricted cytotoxic activity against the autologous tumor cells. Immunohistochemical experiments, performed with the anti-V beta 16 mAb, showed that the corresponding CTLs are present in the tumor area, some of them being closely opposed to the melanoma cells. Together, these studies demonstrate the existence of a local adaptive immune response clinically associated to tumor regression, thus strongly supporting the validity of the immunosurveillance concept in certain human tumors.",

The expression of Ia antigen was induced by the culture of murine peritoneal macrophages with recombinant interferon-gamma (IFN). Maximal expression was achieved after 4 days of culture. Membrane vesicles shed from the murine B16 F10 melanoma cell line inhibited the in vitro induction of Ia expression by 40 to 90% in allogeneic and syngeneic systems. Inhibition was not due to toxicity, a reduction in IFN activity, phagocytosis or contamination of the vesicle preparation with endotoxin, which is an inhibitor of Ia expression. Inhibition exerted by vesicles was prostaglandin-dependent and was over-come by increasing concentrations of IFN. It is possible that the reduction of macrophage Ia antigen expression by tumor cell products, such as shed membrane vesicles, contributes to the immunosuppression of tumor-bearing hosts.

Co-treatment with actinomycin D rescued the cells from the \"commitment,\" suggesting that \"early\" gene activation events may be crucial for growth arrest. To understand the mechanism of IL-1 action, we are studying early genes whose expression is induced by the cytokine. Five early genes associated with IL-1 action in the melanoma cells were isolated by differential screening of a cDNA library, which was enriched for sequences representing IL-1 responsive genes (IRGs). Nucleotide sequencing identified four of the genes as gro-alpha, gro-beta, c-jun and nur77/NGF1-B/NAK1, respectively, while the fifth was judged as novel by GenBank search and designated IRG-9. None of the early genes was uniquely associated with the antiproliferative action of IL-1: other growth-inhibitory as well as growth-stimulatory signals induced these genes in diverse cell types. However, analysis of the induction patterns of the IRGs and other well known early genes revealed that IL-1 action in the melanoma cells is characterized by activation of a unique primary gene expression program. This program was defined by the magnitude and temporal pattern of induction of the five IRGs, feeble induction of c-fos, and lack of induction of Egr-1 and c-myc. We present evidence that this program is growth arrest-specific in the melanoma cells and that distinct cell type-specific programs are associated with IL-1 growth-regulatory actions in other tumor cells. Based on these data, we propose that early genes may play multifunctional roles in tumor growth control, but specificity for the growth arrest action of IL-1 is determined by the composite early gene induction program.",

In 83% of the cases colony formation was observed (plating efficiency, PE, greater than 0.01%). Twenty-seven per cent of the tumors gave PEs greater than 1%, 45% gave PEs in the range 0.1-0.9%, whereas 11% of the tumors gave 0.01-0.09%. The PEs were not correlated with the degree of pigmentation or with the clinical course. Evaluable chemosensitivity data were obtained on 104 metastases from 83 patients. Large differences in sensitivity were seen. In cases which were evaluable both in vivo and in vitro a clear correlation was found between the in vitro chemosensitivity, expressed as the expected growth delay, and the clinical response to chemotherapy. Tumors from patients with partial response, mixed response or stable disease after prior progression, all had rather high in vitro sensitivity to the drug used (expected growth delay greater than 2.0), whereas patients with progression had lower sensitivity. The results confirm that the soft agar method used here provides good culture conditions for human melanoma cells and show that chemosensitivity data can be obtained in a high percentage of melanoma patients.

Expression of CD7 decreases in M-CSF-differentiated macrophages and in melanoma-conditioned medium-induced macrophages (MCMI/Mφ) in comparison to monocytes. A ligand for CD7, SECTM1 (secreted and transmembrane protein 1), is highly expressed in many tumors, including melanoma cells. We show that SECTM1 binds to CD7 and significantly increases monocyte migration by activation of the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase) pathway. In human melanoma tissues, tumor-infiltrating macrophages expressing CD7 are present. These melanomas, with CD7-positive inflammatory cell infiltrations, frequently highly express SECTM1, including an N-terminal, soluble form, which can be detected in the sera of metastatic melanoma patients but not in normal sera.

Three of eight mice (37.5%) that received both bleomycin and the IL12 gene showed complete remission of the preestablished tumors and rejected subsequent rechallenge with the tumor cells. We also examined whether electrochemo-gene therapy for subcutaneous tumor mass induced suppression of pulmonary metastasis that had been established by intravenous inoculation of the melanoma cells.

Lung metastasis was induced using B16F-10 melanoma cells in C57BL/6 mice by three different modalities of administration: simultaneous, prophylactic, and after tumor development. Harmine significantly inhibited tumor nodule formation in the lung tissue and decreased various biochemical parameters associated with lung metastasis. Higher expression levels of pro-metastatic genes such as matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), extracellular signal[en]regulated kinase (ERK), and vascular endothelial factors (VEGFs), all of which play important roles in cancer cell migration and invasion, were observed in the metastatic group compared with normal, but were all down-regulated by treatment with harmine. Harmine was also able to inhibit tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and migration in vitro. In conclusion, harmine exerts anti-metastatic activity and this effect could be linked to the metastasis-related signaling pathway that includes ERK, VEGF, and MMPs.",

Innovative approaches aimed at inducing a more effective immune response against tumors have shown promising results in animal models. One approach involves the genetic modification of tumor cells so that they produce cytokines that stimulate an immune response.;The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of cytokine gene therapy for metastatic melanoma in a murine melanoma model.;B16F10 murine melanoma cells, which readily metastasize to the lungs, were transduced with a retroviral vector containing genes encoding neomycin resistance and human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). The presence of M-CSF messenger RNA in transduced cells was examined by coupled reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction. Concentrations of soluble M-CSF in cell culture supernatants were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). A clonal cell line, designated N+/CSF+, that expressed and secreted M-CSF was identified. Another clonal cell line, designated N+/CSF-, did not secrete M-CSF at levels detectable by ELISA. B16F10, N+/CSF-, and N+/CSF+ cells, individually or in combination, were injected intravenously or subcutaneously into C57BL/6 mice; we then evaluated the tumorigenicity and metastatic behavior of the cells, as well as the immune responses and survival of the mice. The immune responses assayed were the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and peritoneal exudate cell (PEC) tumoricidal activities.;Injection of B16F10 cells into the tail vein of C57BL/6 mice led to the establishment of lung metastases by week 2 and death by week 8. Injection of the N+/CSF+ or N+/CSF- cells led to the establishment of lung metastases that were detected at 2 and 3 weeks, respectively; however, these metastatic lesions were eliminated, and the animals had survival rates similar to those of the noninjected control mice. Injection of mice with a mixture of B16F10 and N+/CSF- cells resulted in the development of metastatic disease and 0% survival at 8 weeks, whereas mice that had been given an injection of a mixture of B16F10 and N+/CSF+ cells had an 80% survival rate at 8 weeks and survived at least two times longer (P = .007). The CTL and PEC tumoricidal activities in animals given an injection of N+/CSF+ cells suggested that monocytes and lymphocytes were responsible for the observed antitumor response.;These findings suggest that the expression of M-CSF by genetically modified melanoma cells caused an effective antitumor immune response in host C57BL/6 mice and, thus, prolonged survival over that observed in the control mice.",

In this study, using a novel ex vivo molecular-based approach at the single-cell level, we identified a single, naturally primed T cell clone that dominated the human CD8(+) T cell response to the Melan-A/MART-1 Ag. The dominant clone expressed a high-avidity TCR to cognate tumor Ag, efficiently killed tumor cells, and prevailed in the differentiated effector-memory T lymphocyte compartment. TCR sequencing also revealed that this particular clone arose at least 1 year before vaccination, displayed long-term persistence, and efficient homing to metastases. Remarkably, during concomitant vaccination over 3.5 years, the frequency of the pre-existing clone progressively increased, reaching up to 2.5% of the circulating CD8 pool while its effector functions were enhanced. In parallel, the disease stabilized, but subsequently progressed with loss of Melan-A expression by melanoma cells. Collectively, combined ex vivo analysis of T cell differentiation and clonality revealed for the first time a strong expansion of a tumor Ag-specific human T cell clone, comparable to protective virus-specific T cells.

        "Doc_abstract":"Emergence of the invasive phenotype is a key event in the progression of human melanoma from benign proliferative lesions to malignant lesions. Recently we successfully selected in vivo from a poorly metastatic M4Beu. human melanoma cell line two variants (7GP and T1P26) that generate a higher frequency of spontaneous metastases to the lungs into immune-suppressed neonatal rats. Both cell lines showed no significant differences in the integrin profile of the subunits analyzed except for beta3, which was reduced to a background level in metastatic variants. To investigate how these variant sublines of human melanomas manage to sustain growth in the absence of alpha(v)beta3, a subtractive immunization approach was used to elicit host antibody response against cell surface proteins expressed on metastatic variants. In this study, a new monoclonal antibody (MoAb), LY1, that is highly specific for the 7GP and T1P26 variants, was isolated. LY1 identifies a membrane protein of Mr 55,000 on melanoma variants with epitopes that were resistant to sugar-cleaving enzymes. Immunostaining cells from variants by LY1 showed that staining is distributed to the cell periphery with high labeling intensity at the cell-to-cell contact points. This MoAb significantly inhibited invasion of metastatic variants through a reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel) in vitro. Moreover, tumor growth of melanoma variants was dramatically affected in vivo with this MoAb. In vitro studies indicate that the LY1 MoAb does not inhibit chemotactic migration of the metastatic variants, the adhesion of tumor cells to vitronectin, collagen IV, fibronectin, and laminin, or cell proliferation. Expression of this antigen is high in human striated muscle, heart, spleen, brain, and lung and absent in kidney, liver, and pancreas. Using 59 fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissues of human melanomas and nevi, LY1-reactive cells were not observed in melanocytes, nevi, or radial growth phase primary melanomas. In sharp contrast, LY1 selectively stained melanocytes derived from the vertical growth phase of many primary melanomas and metastatic melanomas. These results provide evidence that the Mr 55,000 protein expressed by selected variants with increased metastatic properties in vivo plays a functionally important role in determining metastasis. This molecule may represent a new metastatic risk marker in human melanoma and may be of biological importance in the identification of fatal metastatic subpopulations that have acquired competence for metastasis production.",

One strategy to enhance immune recognition would be to express such molecules on the tumor cell. Here, we show that expression of a member of the B7 family of co-stimulatory molecules by CMT93 murine colorectal tumor or 1735 murine melanoma cells resulted in a local antitumor response in immunocompetent mice. The antitumor effect was diminished in athymic nude mice, indicating that T cells played an important part in this response. The ability of the B7-expressing tumor cells to generate systemic protective immunity was investigated by excision of tumors that developed from the initial inoculation followed by rechallenge with parental tumor cells. CMT93 is a poorly immunogenic tumor and no significant systemic immunity was elicited by the expression of B7-1 in these cells. 1735 melanoma is a mildly immunogenic tumor. Unexpectedly, the systemic immunity obtained with 1735 tumors expressing B7-1 or B7-2 was weaker than that generated by parental 1735 cells (p < 0.001, stratified logrank test), even when coexpression of interferon-gamma in the B7-1 cells produced high levels of surface MHC class I expression.

The degree of such infiltration and cell activation are considered significant prognostic factors reflecting the host's immune response to the tumor; thus, patients with peritumoral infiltration may have a better prognosis and may also achieve a better response to interleukin-2 (IL2) immunotherapy. There is evidence that the expression of cluster designation (CD) 25 antigen (IL2 receptor [IL2R]) is a good marker of activity of T lymphocytes against melanoma cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate in vivo the binding of 99mTc-IL2 to lymphocytes infiltrating cutaneous melanoma and to determine whether such uptake correlates with immunologic and histologic data, thus providing useful prognostic information for IL2 therapy in patients with advanced disease.;Thirty patients with cutaneous lesions suspected of being melanoma were studied. Planar gamma-camera images over known tumor sites were acquired 1 h after the injection of 111-185 MBq of 99mTc-IL2. Tumor uptake of 99mTc-IL2 was measured as a target-to-background (T/B) radioactivity ratio. All patients underwent surgery, and histologic evaluation of the resected lesion was performed. The percentage of different peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD16, CD25) and the percentage of IL2R-positive tumor cells on histologic sections were also measured.;At final histology, 21 lesions were found to be melanoma and 9 were classified as benign. In 15 of 21 (71%) melanomas and 2 of 9 (22%) benign cutaneous lesions, we found uptake of 99mTc-IL2.

Variants of murine B16 melanoma having different metastatic potentials (in the order BL6 greater than or equal to F10>F1>WA4) have been characterized by the same decreasing order of cell surface G(M3) expression level, relative adhesiveness to nonactivated ECs, and relative degree of G(M3)-dependent adhesion to Gg3Cer- or LacCer-coated plates. Degree of integrin-dependent cell adhesion and adhesion to IL-1-activated ECs was similar for BL6, F10, and F1. These results suggest that metastatic potential of these B16 variants is closely dependent on relative adhesion to nonactivated ECs, which is based on G(M3)-Gg3Cer or G(M3)-LacCer interaction. This possibility has been supported by further studies showing that blocking of G(M3)-dependent melanoma adhesion by mu M-order concentrations of G(M3) or Gg3Cer in liposomes, or by sialidase treatment of melanoma cells, strongly inhibited BL6 metastasis to lung. Paragloboside or sialylparagloboside did not affect G(M3)-dependent BL6 cell adhesion and did not inhibit metastasis. Spontaneous metastasis from subcutaneously-grown tumors was significantly reduced if G(M3)- or Gg3Cer-liposomes were intravenously injected during tumor growth.

Membrane vesicles shed from F10 cells did not affect the expression of macrophage H-2K or H-2D antigens under conditions shown to profoundly inhibit Ia antigen expression. Similarly, the induction of plasminogen activator and interleukin 1 from macrophages was not inhibited by the vesicles. The vesicles did not measurably decrease total cellular RNA or protein synthesis. Macrophages were sensitive to the inhibitory effects of the vesicles during the induction and maintenance phases of Ia expression. Pretreatment of macrophages with vesicles before culture with IFN did not reduce the induction of Ia. The rate of decline of Ia expression after removal of IFN was unaffected by the presence of vesicles. Removal of vesicles from cultures of IFN-treated macrophages resulted in only a partial recovery of Ia expression, suggesting that the inhibition of Ia expression may be a slowly reversible process. The selective and partially reversible inhibition of Ia expression by vesicles shed from the plasma membrane of tumor cells is a possible mechanism whereby tumor-bearing hosts may become immunocompromised.",

The Exotest allowed sensitive detection and quantification of exosomes purified from human tumor cell culture supernatants and plasma from SCID mice engrafted with human melanoma. Plasma levels of exosomes in melanoma-engrafted SCID mice correlated to tumor size. We evaluated the levels of plasma exosomes expressing CD63 and caveolin-1 in melanoma patients (n = 90) and healthy donors (n = 58). Consistently, plasma exosomes expressing CD63 (504+/-315) or caveolin-1 (619+/-310) were significantly increased in melanoma patients as compared to healthy donors (223+/-125 and 228+/-102, respectively).

Melanoma vaccines (active specific immunotherapy) are designed to modulate the immune system and have subsequent anti-tumor effects with minimal toxicity. Previous attempts to produce melanoma vaccines include immunization with whole tumor cells/cell lysates admixed with nonspecific adjuvants. While these vaccines generate enhanced anti-tumor immunity in a subset of patients, some of whom survive for longer than historical controls, no clinical benefit has so far been demonstrated in a properly controlled phase III study. Genetic modifications of tumor cells to make them express cytokines afford new-generation melanoma vaccines, and generate long-lasting systemic antitumor immunity in animal models. Translation of these preclinical results primarily into melanoma patients with advanced diseases shows the potential to induce systemic antitumor immune responses and in some instances tumor regression with acceptably low toxicity. The efficacy of this novel vaccine approach would be expected to be higher when used in a postsurgical adjuvant setting when the tumor load is small. Other novel vaccine approaches such as dendritic cell-based therapy also hold promise for the treatment of melanoma.

A3AR is highly expressed in tumor cells whereas lower expression was noted in a variety of normal cells. Recently we showed that A3AR activation in melanoma cells resulted in growth inhibition via a direct anti-proliferative effect which entailed cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 and down-regulation of cyclin D1 and c-Myc. In the present study we present an additional mechanism demonstrating that A3AR agonists activate natural killer (NK) cells which further enhance the anti-tumor effect of this group of molecules. NK cells mediate the natural cytotoxicity and their number and function is reduced in cancer patients. We show Cl-IB-MECA to inhibit tumor development via the activation of NK cells is an additional mechanism which accounts for the anti-tumor effect of A3AR agonists. This effect was noted at a low dose of 10 micro g/kg, demonstrating that the response is exclusively A3AR mediated. Treatment of naïve mice for four days yielded the highest effect on NK cell potentiation. In mice inoculated with B16-F10 melanoma cells and treated each orally with Cl-IB-MECA, melanoma growth inhibition correlated with higher serum level of IL-12 and potentiation of NK cells. Moreover, in adoptive transfer experiments in melanoma bearing mice, marked inhibition of lung metastatic foci was noted upon engraftment with splenocytes derived from Cl-IB-MECA treated mice.

This approach has proven most beneficial when the diagnosis is of early stage primary lesions. Likewise, patients undergoing resection for a solitary site of metastasis have shown a survival advantage. Identification of metastatic disease depends predominantly on radiographic techniques requiring the presence of significant tumor burdens for successful imaging. However, at that time, the role of surgery and/or biochemotherapy may be of limited value. Techniques to identify minimal disease states may permit more accurate assessment of prognosis. The detection of occult tumor cells by RT-PCR in the blood, lymph nodes, and bone marrow of melanoma patients provides one such approach to monitor tumor progression. Single-marker RT-PCR has been used as one such approach but is noted to have limitations in sensitivity and specificity based on the heterogeneity of tumor marker expression among tumors as well as within an individual tumor lesion or among multiple lesions in individual patients. We employed a multimarker reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay that demonstrates improved sensitivity over a single-marker approach. Currently, the consequences of detecting systemic subclinical metastasis remain unknown pending longer-term follow-up.

We have previously demonstrated that an adequate N-linked glycosylation of IGF-1R is required for its translocation to the cell surface in melanoma cells. This raises the possibility of using glycosylation inhibitors as therapeutic agents against IGF-1R-dependent malignancies. In this study we show that inhibition of N-linked glycosylation using tunicamycin or the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor lovastatin resulted in down-regulation of IGF-1R at the cell surface in Ewing's sarcoma cell lines (RD-ES and ES-1 cells). The down-regulation of plasma membrane-bound IGF-1R was correlated with a drastic decrease in IGF-1R autophosphorylation, suggesting biochemical inactivation of the receptor. Whereas RD-ES and ES-1 cells responded differently with regard to DNA synthesis, the decrease in IGF-1R expression was accompanied by a rapid and substantial decrease in survival of both cell lines. Our data suggest that relatively untoxic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (e.g. lovastatin) could have therapeutic significance in IGF-1R-dependent neoplasms like Ewing's sarcoma.",

A requisite component for improving gene-based therapies of brain cancer includes tumor suppressor genes that exhibit cancer constrained inhibitory activity. Subtraction hybridization identified melanoma differentiation associated gene-7 (mda-7) as a gene associated with melanoma cell growth, differentiation and progression. Ectopic expression of mda-7 by means of a replication-incompetent adenovirus (Ad), Ad.mda-7, induces growth suppression and apoptosis selectively in diverse human cancers, without producing any apparent harmful effect in normal cells. We presently demonstrate that Ad.mda-7 induces growth inhibition and apoptosis in malignant human gliomas expressing both mutant and wild-type p53, and these effects correlate with an elevation in expression of members of the growth arrest and DNA damage (GADD) gene family. In contrast, infection with a recombinant Ad expressing wild-type p53, Ad.wtp53, specifically affects mutant p53 expressing gliomas. When tested in early passage normal and immortal human fetal astrocytes, growth inhibition resulting from infection with Ad.mda-7 or Ad.wtp53 is significantly less than in malignant gliomas and no toxicity is evident in these normal cells. Moreover, infection of gliomas with Ad.mda-7 or treatment with purified GST-MDA-7 protein sensitizes both wild-type and mutant p53 expressing tumor cells to the growth inhibitory and antisurvival effects of ionizing radiation, and this response correlates with increased expression of specific members of the GADD gene family. Since heterogeneity in p53 expression is common in evolving gliomas, the present findings suggest that Ad.mda-7 may, in many instances, prove more beneficial for the gene-based therapy of malignant gliomas than administration of wild-type p53.",

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the most well-known angiogenic factor, and it has a potent function as a stimulator of endothelial survival, migration, as well as vascular permeability. Therefore, we have investigated whether vitamin C can regulate the angiogenic process through the modulation of VEGF production from B16F10 melanoma cells. VEGF mRNA expression and VEGF production at protein levels were suppressed by vitamin C. In addition, we found that vitamin C suppressed the expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and that decreased VEGF production by vitamin C was also restored by the administration of prostaglandin E2 which is a product of COX-2. These results suggest that vitamin C suppresses VEGF expression via the regulation of COX-2 expression. Mitogen-activated protein kinases are generally known as key mediators in the signaling pathway for VEGF production. In the presence of vitamin C, the activation of p42/44 MAPK was completely inhibited. Taken together, our data suggest that vitamin C can down-regulate VEGF production via the modulation of COX-2 expression and that p42/44 MAPK acts as an important signaling mediator in this process.",

Herein, we report that the combinatorial therapy of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly-IC) and antiprogrammed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) can be implemented with good results for tumors where no known TAAs have been identified.;Three cancer mouse models (melanoma, lung, and colon) were used to evaluate therapeutic efficacy and examine the immunologic mechanisms of the poly-IC/anti-PD-L1 mAb therapy.;The combined administration of poly-IC and anti-PD-L1 mAb into tumor-bearing mice generated potent immune responses resulting in the complete eradication or remarkable reduction of tumor growth. In some instances, the poly-IC/anti-PD-L1 mAb therapy induced long-lasting protection against tumor rechallenges. The results indicate that CD8 T cells but not CD4 T cells or NK cells mediated the therapeutic efficacy of this combinatorial therapy. Experiments using genetically deficient mice indicate that the therapeutic efficacy of this combinatorial therapy depended in part by the participation of type-I IFN, whereas IFN-γ did not seem to play a major role.;The overall results suggest that immunotherapy consisting of the combination of poly-IC/anti-PD-L1 mAb could be a promising new approach for treating patients with cancer, especially those instances where no reliable TAAs are available as a therapeutic vaccine.",

In vitro studies suggest that potent tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells can be induced against human melanoma. Melanoma specific T-cell activation depends on appropriate presentation to the immune system of recently defined melanoma-associated antigens presented in the context of self-HLA gene products. Full T-cell activation requires the co- stimulation by B7-CD28 interactions at the T-cell surface and the elaboration of immune cytokines to promote T-cell growth.

Therefore, these experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that overexpression of extracellular superoxide dismutase (ecSOD) would inhibit the growth of tumors arising from s.c. implantation of syngenic B16-F1 melanoma cells. C57BL/6 mice were infected i.m. with adenovirus containing either beta-galactosidase (Ad.lacZ) as control or the secreted extracellular isoform of SOD (Ad.ecSOD) 3 days before s.c. implantation of B16-F1 tumor cells. Serum SOD activity was elevated nearly approximately 5-fold over control animals. Two weeks after implantation, B16-F1 tumor size was 65% smaller in mice infected with Ad.ecSOD in comparison with mice infected with Ad.lacZ. However, the presence of SOD did not affect growth rates of B16-F1 cells in vitro. Consistent with smaller tumor volume, tumors from Ad.ecSOD-infected mice also expressed less vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Moreover, in vitro studies using B16-F1 cells confirm that SOD blunts oxidant-dependent VEGF expression. Importantly, CD31 expression and vessel density were markedly reduced in tumors from Ad.ecSOD-infected mice compared with controls.

Genetic tagging of tumor cells with the bacterial beta-galactosidase marker gene lacZ, radiolabeling of tumor cells with [I-125]IdUrd, and S-phase labeling of cells with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) were used simultaneously to track the fate of highly metastatic K-1735 X-21 melanoma cells injected into syngeneic C3H/HeN mice. The melanoma cells were transfected with a plasmid containing lacZ and neomycin resistance genes. After growth in selective medium, the cells were incubated in medium containing [I-125]IdUrd and then injected i.v. into mice. Lungs isolated at various times after i.v. injection were processed for staining with X-gal, radioactive monitoring, and immunohistochemical staining with a monoclonal antibody against BrdUrd. At early time points, the presence of lacZ-positive cells directly correlated with radioactivity associated with viable cells. However, the expression of the beta-galactosidase was only stable for 1 week, and by 3 weeks after injection, large metastases contained only a few lacZ-positive cells. The combination of lacZ tagging with BrdUrd proliferation assay accurately identified dividing tumor cells in micrometastases. The simultaneous use of these 3 techniques allowed us to conclude that quantitative analysis of tumor cell survival is best accomplished by radioactive labeling of cells, whereas the use of lacZ-tagged cells allowed for studies of localization. Analysis of tumor cell proliferation requires the use of both lacZ tagging and immunohistochemistry using anti-BrdUrd antibodies.

Associations were also found between EZH2 and important clinicopathologic variables. EZH2 expression showed significant prognostic impact in melanoma, prostate, and endometrial carcinoma in univariate survival analyses, and revealed independent prognostic importance in carcinoma of the endometrium and prostate. CONCLUSION Our findings point at EZH2 as a novel and independent prognostic marker in endometrial cancer, and validate previous findings on prostate and breast cancer. Further, EZH2 expression was associated with features of aggressive cutaneous melanoma. The fact that EZH2 might identify increased tumor cell proliferation and aggressive subgroups in several cancers may be of practical interest because the polycomb group proteins have been suggested as candidates for targeted therapy.

We studied whether LFA-1-ICAM-1 interactions affect tumor cell susceptibility to MHC-unrestricted lysis by TCR-CD3-CD16+ natural killer (NK) and TCR gamma delta + CD3+ CD16+/- lymphocytes. Moreover, tumor target cell susceptibility to anti-CD16 mAb-triggered lysis by TCR- NK cells was investigated. Therefore, ICAM-1+ or ICAM-1- tumor cell lines were used as target cells. Two melanoma-derived cell lines expressing little or no ICAM-1 were relatively resistant to MHC-unrestricted lysis as well as anti-CD16 mAb-triggered lysis by fresh or cloned TCR- NK cells. The ICAM-1- melanoma cell line was also relatively resistant to MHC-unrestricted lysis by TCR gamma delta + clones. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induced ICAM-1 expression on ICAM-1- tumor cells, and simultaneously increased target cell susceptibility to MHC-unrestricted as well as to anti-CD16 mAb-triggered lysis. This enhanced level of lysis was inhibited by anti-ICAM-1 mAb. Our data demonstrate that LFA-1-ICAM-1 interactions increase MHC-unrestricted or CD16-mediated cytolysis of tumor cells.

Despite advances in adjuvant therapies in recent years, the prognosis of these tumors has not improved. In fact, there are currently no consensus guidelines for the treatment of these neoplasms and the search for targetable biomarkers has not been successful so far. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) has emerged as a potential target for therapeutics in a number of malignant tumors, including melanoma, lung, and colorectal cancer. In normal conditions, PD-L1 is thought to promote immune homeostasis via a number of pathways, but mainly through downregulation of cytotoxic T cells. In some human neoplasms, however, overexpression of PD-L1 by tumor cells has been observed, which can modulate the immune system to allow cancer cells to evade host response. As this marker could potentially be a therapeutic target for these tumors, the immunohistochemical expression of PD-L1 in a group of carcinosarcomas was evaluated in the present study.;Twenty-nine cases of gynecologic carcinosarcomas were analyzed, corresponding to tumors originating from the uterus (25), ovary (2), fallopian tube (1), and pelvic epithelium (1). Immunohistochemistry for PD-L1 was performed on paraffin sections and the staining results were assessed semiquantitatively in both epithelial and mesenchymal components of each tumor.;Positive membranous staining for PD-L1 was detected in 25/29 tumors (86%). The epithelial components were strongly positive in 19/29 (65%) and weakly positive in 6/29 tumors (21%). The mesenchymal elements were strongly positive in 8/29 (27%) and weakly positive in 3/29 tumors (10%). With exception of 1, all tumors with positive sarcomatous components had staining of the carcinomatous element. Four tumors were negative for PD-L1 in both components.;This study shows that PD-L1 is expressed by the majority of carcinosarcomas, predominantly in the epithelial components. This is particularly important as most locoregional recurrences and distant metastases are of epithelial origin. This finding may serve as a basis for possible therapeutic approaches using antibodies that have already shown significant value in a number of other malignant tumors.",

Melanoma comprises multi-subpopulations of cancer cells some of which may possess stem cell-like properties. Although useful, the sphere-formation assay to identify stem cell-like or tumor initiating cell subpopulations in melanoma has been challenged, and it is unclear if this model can predict a functional phenotype associated with aggressive tumor cells.;We analyzed the molecular and functional phenotypes of melanoma spheroids formed in neural crest cell medium. Whether from metastatic or advanced primary tumors, spheroid cells expressed melanoma-associated markers. They displayed higher capacity to differentiate along mesenchymal lineages and enhanced expression of SOX2, NANOG, KLF4, and/or OCT4 transcription factors, but not enhanced self-renewal or tumorigenicity when compared to their adherent counterparts. Gene expression profiling attributed a neural crest cell signature to these spheroids and indicated that a migratory/invasive and immune-function modulating program could be associated with these cells. In vitro assays confirmed that spheroids display enhanced migratory/invasive capacities. In immune activation assays, spheroid cells elicited a poorer allogenic response from immune cells and inhibited mitogen-dependent T cells activation and proliferation more efficiently than their adherent counterparts. Our findings reveal a novel immune-modulator function of melanoma spheroids and suggest specific roles for spheroids in invasion and in evasion of antitumor immunity.;The association of a more plastic, invasive and evasive, thus a more aggressive tumor phenotype with melanoma spheroids reveals a previously unrecognized aspect of tumor cells expanded as spheroid cultures. While of limited efficiency for melanoma initiating cell identification, our melanoma spheroid model predicted aggressive phenotype and suggested that aggressiveness and heterogeneity of melanoma tumors can be supported by subpopulations other than cancer stem cells. Therefore, it could be constructive to investigate melanoma aggressiveness, relevant to patients and clinical transferability.",

This combination therapy led to the complete rejection of a lethal challenge with B78D14 murine melanoma cells in six of eight mice and a marked suppression of s.c. tumor growth in the two remaining animals. The tumor-protective immunity was mediated by MHC class I antigen- restricted CD8(+) T cells together with CD4(+) T cell help, which was required only for tumor cell killing in the effector phase of the immune response. A single oral vaccination with the DNA vaccine, which was carried by attenuated Salmonella typhimurium, was equally as effective as three such vaccinations applied at 2-week intervals. The immunological mechanisms involved in this antitumor effect were suggested by a decisively increased secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha TNFTnTNa and IFN-gamma from CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and a markedly up-regulated expression on CD8(+) T cells of high-affinity IL-2 receptor alpha chain (CD25), costimulatory molecule CD28, and adhesion molecule lymphocyte function-associated antigen-2 (LFA-2/CD2). Additionally, the combination therapy induced increased expression of costimulatory molecules B7.1 and CD48 on murine antigen-presenting cells. Taken together, our results suggest that IL-2 targeted to the tumor microenvironment by a specific antibody-IL-2 fusion protein is a potent enhancer of tumor-protective immunity induced by an oral DNA vaccine that may ultimately enhance the chances of success in its clinical application.",

In this model, CTL migrated toward tumor cells, resulting in tumor cell apoptosis. CTL migration was mediated by the CC chemokine receptor (CCR)4 expressed by the CTL and the CC chemokine ligand (CCL)2 secreted by the tumor cells, as evidenced by blockage of CTL migration by CCL2 or antibodies to CCL2 or CCR4. These results were confirmed in a Transwell migration assay in which the CTL actively migrated toward isolated CCL2 and migration was inhibited by anti-CCR4 antibody.

Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) is a multifunctional cytokine capable of eliciting mitogenic, motogenic and morphogenetic activities in responsive cells, and has been implicated in tumor development and metastasis. Binding of HGF/SF to its tyrosine kinase receptor c-Met stimulates multiple signal transduction pathways, leading to the activation of numerous transcription factors. We here report that HGF/SF can induce cyclin D1 expression in mouse melanoma cells, and that this up-regulation is mediated in part by the activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2). HGF/SF-mediated phosphorylation of ATF-2 was reduced in the presence of either the p38 kinase-specific inhibitor SB203580, a dominant negative p38 mutant, the SAPK/JNK inhibitor JNK-interacting protein-1 (JIP-1), or the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-specific inhibitor LY294002. Activation of p38 kinase by HGF/SF was partially blocked by the PI3K-specific inhibitor as well. The upstream kinases for p38, MKK3/6, did not become activated following HGF/SF exposure, and ATF-2 activation was undiminished by transient transfection of a dominant negative MKK6 mutant. However, transcriptional up-regulation of cyclin D1 by HGF/SF was partially inhibited by the p38 kinase-specific inhibitor, and cyclin D1 protein induction was partially blocked by a dominant negative ATF-2 mutant. Notably, the p38 kinase-specific inhibitor was able to block melanoma cell proliferation but not motility. We conclude that the ATF-2 transcription factor becomes activated by HGF/SF through p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK. Moreover, the p38-ATF-2 pathway can help mediate proliferation signals in tumor cells through transcriptional activation of key cell cycle regulators.",

The same parental melanoma cell line has now been transduced retrovirally to overexpress Hsp70 permanently. Here we demonstrate that MHC class I cell surface expression is again not altered and that these cells, in contrast with acutely Hsp70 overexpressing cells, do not show augmentation of CTL-mediated apoptosis. Also, long-term induction of Hsp70 in cells with the doxycycline-inducible Hsp70 construct leads to abrogation of increased lysability. Because, furthermore, after heat shock the same permanently Hsp70 overexpressing cells show Hsp70 induction and increased lysability, it is hypothesized that acutely available Hsp70 is able to chaperone proteins that are involved in CTL-mediated apoptosis of target cells and to thereby improve their lysability. We also observed that permanent but not acute Hsp70 overexpression resulted in decreased levels of Hsc70, the constitutively expressed member of the Hsp70 family. Down-regulation of Hsc70 occurs at the post-transcriptional level and can be observed also after long-term induction of Hsp70 in cells containing the doxycycline-inducible expression system. Hsc70 down-regulation might reflect a functional integration of the overexpressed Hsp70 on the basis of a chaperone network so that only acute induction will provide Hsp70 that can improve tumor cell lysability.

With melanoma, most studies do not show any clear relationship between CTC levels and stage of disease. Here, CTCs were enriched (∼400X) from blood of melanoma patients using a simple centrifugation device (OncoQuick), and 4 melanocyte target RNAs (TYR, MLANA, MITF, and MIF) were quantified using QPCR. Approximately one-third of melanoma patients had elevated MIF and MLANA transcripts (p<0.0001 and p<0.001, respectively) compared with healthy controls. In contrast, healthy controls had uniformly higher levels of TYR and MITF than melanoma patients (p<0.0001). There was a marked shift of leukocytes into the CTC-enriched fractions (a 430% increase in RNA recovery, p<0.001), and no relationship between CTC levels and stage of disease was found. CTCs were captured on microfabricated filters and cultured. Captured melanoma CTCs were large cells, and consisted of 2 subpopulations, based on immunoreactivity. One subpopulation (∼50%) stained for both pan-cytokeratin (KRT) markers and the common leukocyte marker CD-45, whereas the second subpopulation stained for only KRT. Since similar cells are described in many cancers, we also examined blood from colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients. We observed analogous results, with most captured CTCs staining for both CD-45/KRT markers (and for the monocyte differentiation marker CD-14). Our results suggest that immature melanocyte-related cells (expressing TYR and MITF RNA) may circulate in healthy controls, although they are not readily detectable without considerable enrichment. Further, as early-stage melanomas develop, immature melanocyte migration into the blood is somehow curtailed, whereas a significant proportion of patients develop elevated CTC levels (based on MIF and MLANA RNAs). The nature of the captured CTCs is consistent with literature describing leukocyte/macrophage-tumor cell fusion hybrids, and their role in metastatic progression.",

Irradiated tumor cells and H-2Db transfectants did not stimulate anti-tumor immunity while H-2Kb transfectants and NDV-modified F10.9 cells showing low and high expression of MHC class-I genes efficiently prevented metastasis of small established tumors. NDV-modified parental-cell vaccines functioned optimally and improved overall survival by about 60%, also at early stages of metastasis establishment. A synergistic effect of H-2Kb expression and virus modification on rejection of micrometastases was observed in mice bearing advanced tumors. Postoperative vaccination of mice carrying multiple metastases with NDV-modified vaccines caused significant, but incomplete, reduction of metastatic tumor load. The therapeutic effect of NDV-modified tumor vaccines was dependent on multiple immune mechanisms. Depletion of CD8, CD4 or NK cells by in vivo treatment with monoclonal antibodies reversed the immunotherapeutic effects of the vaccine.

The new trAb Ektomab that targets the melanoma-associated ganglioside antigen GD2 and the signaling molecule human CD3 (hCD3) on T cells demonstrated potent T-cell activation and tumor cell destruction in vitro. However, the relatively low affinity for the GD2 antigen raised the question of its therapeutic capability. To further evaluate its efficacy in vivo it was necessary to establish a mouse model.;We generated the surrogate trAb Surek, which possesses the identical anti-GD2 binding arm as Ektomab, but targets mouse CD3 (mCD3) instead of hCD3, and evaluated its chemical and functional quality as a therapeutic antibody homologue. The therapeutic and immunizing potential of Surek was investigated using B78-D14, a B16 melanoma transfected with GD2 and GD3 synthases and showing strong GD2 surface expression. The induction of tumor-associated and autoreactive antibodies was evaluated.;Despite its low affinity of approximately 10(7) M(-1) for GD2, Surek exerted efficient tumor cell destruction in vitro at an EC(50) of 70 ng/ml [0.47 nM]. Furthermore, Surek showed strong therapeutic efficacy in a dose-dependent manner and is superior to the parental GD2 mono-specific antibody, while the use of a control trAb with irrelevant target specificity had no effect. The therapeutic activity of Surek was strictly dependent on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, and cured mice developed a long-term memory response against a second challenge even with GD2-negative B16 melanoma cells. Moreover, tumor protection was associated with humoral immune responses dominated by IgG2a and IgG3 tumor-reactive antibodies indicating a Th1-biased immune response. Autoreactive antibodies against the GD2 target antigen were not induced.;Our data suggest that Surek revealed strong tumor elimination and anti-tumor immunization capabilities.

Antibody inhibition studies showed that two of these TIL clones were restricted by an HLA-A2 molecule which was identified as A2.1 by gene sequencing. The third CTL clone was not restricted by HLA-A2, but by a B or C HLA antigen. HLA-A2-restricted CTL clones M17-1 and M17-2 lysed 5 and 12 out of 15 HLA-A2+ allogeneic melanomas, respectively. Since they did not lyse autologous Epstein-Barr virus B cells, HLA-A2.1-transfected P815 cells, 13 HLA-A2+ non-melanoma tumor cell lines and 10 HLA-A2- melanomas, these clones appeared specific for melanoma-restricted epitopes presented by the HLA-A2.1 molecule. We then tried to determine why a few HLA-A2+ melanomas were refractory to TIL lysis. By using a combination of flow cytometry analysis, partial cloning and sequencing of their HLA-A2 genes, we show that failure to lyse did not result from low expression or polymorphism of the HLA-A2 molecule, or from deficient expression of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and LFA-3 by these melanomas. Taken together, our data confirm at the clonal level the existence of shared melanoma antigens recognized by TIL in the HLA-A2.1 context. They further show that individual peptides derived from these antigens are expressed by a large majority of HLA-A2+ melanomas. Identification of such peptides appears crucial for the future of vaccination therapies.",

A highly consistent trait of tumor stromal fibroblasts in most epithelial cancers is the induction of fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a member of the serine protease family. Recently it was demonstrated that FAP has both dipeptidyl peptidase and collagenolytic activity capable of degrading gelatin and type I collagen. In this study, we describe the expression and enzyme activity of FAP in benign and malignant melanocytic skin tumors. FAP-positive fibroblasts were detected immunohistochemically in the reactive stroma of all melanocytic nevi tested. In primary and metastatic melanomas an upregulation of FAP expression in the reactive mesenchyme could be observed. Whereas 30% of the nevi revealed additional FAP expression on subsets of melanocytic cells, melanoma cells from primary and metastatic melanomas were FAP negative. This may indicate a possible role for FAP in the control of tumor cell growth and proliferation during melanoma carcinogenesis. Consistent with this in vivo expression pattern FAP enzyme activity could be detected by a specific immunocapture assay in extracts of melanocytic nevi and melanoma metastases, whereas no significant activity was detectable in normal adult skin. Strong protein expression of FAP was observed in patterned structures restricted to a subset of the melanoma metastases. Our findings that these FAP-positive structures showed no overlap with endothelial cell surface markers, nor with various melanoma antigens, suggest that FAP is a marker for specific stromal-cell-derived patterns in cutaneous melanoma metastases.",

Also, there was an increase in cells positive for CDK inhibitor p27 in 3-D cultures from the B16F10 cell line. The expression of alpha and gamma catenin was down regulated in spheroids.

Our amelanotic melanomas exhibited the following morphology: epitheloid (72%), spindled (18.7%) or desmoplastic (5.3%). In addition, we obtained patient information and clinical presentations on most of the cases (74/75; 98.7%) and follow-up data on 40% (30/75) of the cases. The majority of amelanotic melanomas in men were found on the trunk (13/45; 29%), head and neck (12/45; 26.7%), and lower limb (13/45; 29%) and in women were found on the lower limb (12/30; 40%), upper limb (10/30; 33.3%) and head and neck (6/30; 20%). In addition, we found that an increase in mitotic index correlated with worse survival (p < 0.026), whereas there were no differences in survival for other pathological features, such as nuclear atypia or solar elastosis. Furthermore, in cases with available tissue, all amelanotic melanoma expressed microphthalmia-associated transcription factor and tyrosinase, suggesting that the tumor cells retained melanocytic lineage and an enzyme in melanin formation, respectively.

PSA enhanced the tumorigenic and metastatic potential of mouse melanoma cells in HDAC3- and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1-(MCP1)-dependent manner. The PSA-mediated enhancement of metastatic potential involved the induction of HDAC3, MCP1, and CD11b (a macrophage marker) expression in the lung tumor tissues. We examined an interaction between anaphylaxis and tumor growth and metastasis at the molecular level. Conditioned medium from antigen-stimulated bone marrow-derived mouse mast cell cultures induced the expression of HDAC3, MCP1, and CCR2, a receptor for MCP1, in B16F1 mouse melanoma cells and enhanced migration and invasion potential of B16F1 cells. The conditioned medium from B16F10 cultures induced the activation of FcεRI signaling in lung mast cells in an HDAC3-dependent manner. FcεRI signaling was observed in lung tumors derived from B16F10 cells. Target scan analysis predicted HDAC3 to be as a target of miR-384, and miR-384 and HDAC3 were found to form a feedback regulatory loop. miR-384, which is decreased by PSA, negatively regulated HDAC3 expression, allergic inflammation, and the positive feedback regulatory loop between anaphylaxis and tumor metastasis.

In B16a cells, disruption of the microfilaments and intermediate filaments inhibits mobility of alpha IIb beta 3 on the cell surface.

The human melanocytic cell system with normal melanocytes, precursor nevus cells, and primary and metastatic melanoma cells has been extensively studied for the phenotypic properties of the cells, including their requirements for exogenous growth factors and other mitogens. In high calcium-containing W489 medium, normal melanocytes require four supplements: IGF-I (or insulin); bFGF, TPA, and alpha-MSH. Nevus cells are largely independent of bFGF. Depletion of TPA from medium is not as detrimental to nevus cells as it is to melanocytes, but the phorbol ester is still essential for maintenance of the typical nevic phenotype. Primary melanoma cells require at least one growth factor, IGF-I (or insulin), for continuous proliferation. On the other hand, metastatic cells of melanoma as well as of carcinomas of colon and rectum, bladder, ovary, and cervix are able to proliferate after a short adaptation period in medium depleted of any growth factors and other proteins. Doubling times of metastatic tumor cells in protein-free medium are only 30-60% longer than in FCS-containing medium. The growth autonomy of human tumor cells is apparently due to the endogenous production of growth factors. Likely candidates for autocrine growth stimulation of human tumor cells are TGF-alpha, TGF-beta, and PDGF. Melanoma and colorectal carcinoma cells express functional EGF/TGF-alpha receptors, and produce TGF-alpha, indicating that this growth factor is produced for autocrine stimulation. In addition to the use of anti-growth factor antibodies, other strategies for the inhibition of autocrine growth stimulation include mAbs to growth factor receptors, soluble receptors, receptor-mimicking antiidiotype antibodies, and active immunization against growth factors. Whether any of these therapeutic approaches is clinically feasible will need to be determined in extensive preclinical investigations.",

The intent was to enhance antigen presentation by increasing interactions between the tumor cell lines in the vaccine and GM-CSF receptor positive antigen presenting cells (APC), notably the patient's Langerhans cells residing within the intradermal injection site. B16.F10 cells engineered to express either membrane-bound or secreted GM-CSF were compared in the B16.F10 mouse melanoma model.

Vaccination with irradiated mbGM-CSF B16.F10 also provided strong protection from wild-type tumor challenge, improved therapeutic effects against established tumors, and retarded lung metastases. These results demonstrate that mbGM-CSF B16.F10 cells can induce strong systemic immunity that protects against and therapeutically treats B16.F10 melanoma more effectively than analogous vaccines containing only secreted GM-CSF.

We previously reported that expression of high levels of TF in a human melanoma cell line promotes metastasis. Both the cytoplasmic domain of TF and its extracellular domain complexed with factor VIIa are required for the metastatic effect. To further explore the mechanism of TF-mediated metastasis, we investigated the possibility that a protease-activated receptor (PAR) might play a role. For this purpose, we first determined the expression levels of the known PARs (PAR1-4) in a human melanoma cell line, SIT1, that has low endogenous levels of TF and low metastatic potential. We found negligible levels of all of the known PARs and transfection of this cell line with human TF cDNA did not alter expression of the known PARs. To study the possible role of PAR1 in TF-mediated metastasis, we prepared a panel of transfected cell lines with varying levels of TF and PAR1. Our studies show that TF promotes metastasis by a pathway that does not involve high expression of known PARs by tumor cells. In addition, while overexpression of PAR1 is insufficient to induce metastasis in cells with low TF expression, it enhances the metastatic potential of cells with high TF expression, indicating a possible synergy between TF and PAR1 in promoting metastasis.",

Elevated levels of 8-OHdG have been regarded as an independent prognostic factor in different types of cancer. Various enzymes, such as human 8-oxoguanine DNA-glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), act as protection against oxidative stress. The low activity of such enzymes has been consistently associated with increased risk of progression in several tumor types. The aim of this study was to investigate whether 8-OHdG, hOGG1 and G6PD expression in tumor tissues might be a predictor of survival in melanoma patients. The expression of 8-OHdG, hOGG1 and G6PD was immunohistochemically investigated in primary cutaneous melanoma and the effect on survival was analyzed. Furthermore, the immunostaining for p53 and survivin was evaluated and the relationship among 8-OHdG, hOGG1, G6PD, p53 and survivin expression was analyzed. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with low expression of nuclear 8-OHdG had significantly longer survival time compared with those with a high expression (P=0.032), whereas cancer-specific survival of patients was not associated with hOGG1 or G6PD expression.

RLIP76 is overexpressed in many tumors, required for tumor angiogenesis, and blockade of RLIP76 results in tumor regression in multiple models. We report here that RLIP76 was required for expression and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in carcinoma and melanoma cells. Conditioned medium derived from RLIP76-depleted tumor cells, but not control knockdown cells, could not stimulate proliferation, migration, or Matrigel cord formation in endothelial cell cultures, which indicates that RLIP76 regulates angiogenic components of the tumor cell secretome. Recombinant VEGF added to conditioned medium from RLIP76-knockdown tumor cells restored these endothelial cell functions. Transcriptional activity of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), which drives VEGF expression, was blocked in RLIP76-depleted tumor cells. RLIP76 was required for PI3-kinase activation, known to regulate HIF-1, in these cells. However, HIF-1α expression and nuclear localization were unaffected by RLIP76 knockdown, which suggests that RLIP76 regulates HIF-1 at the functional level. Thus, RLIP76 regulates tumor cell transactivation of endothelial cells via control of VEGF expression and secretion, providing a new important link in the mechanism of tumor cell induction of angiogenesis.",

Independent and complementary techniques, such as whole-specimen confocal microscopy and magnetic resonance imaging, were used to detect in vivo localization of NP constructs with suitable tracers (i.e., fluorophores or magnetic metals). Targeted HFt-MSH-PEG NPs accumulated persistently at the level of primary melanoma and with high selectivity with respect to other organs. Melanoma localization of untargeted HFt-PEG NPs, which lack the α-MSH moiety, was less pronounced. Furthermore, HFt-MSH-PEG NPs accumulated to a significantly lower extent and with a different distribution in a diverse type of tumor (TS/A adenocarcinoma), which does not express α-MSH receptors. Finally, in a spontaneous lung metastasis model, HFt-MSH-PEG NPs localized at the metastasis level as well.

Among its numerous pro-cancer roles, galectin (gal)-1 expressed and/or secreted by both cancer and endothelial cells stimulates proliferation and angiogenesis. This study first shows that gal-1 is more highly expressed at both mRNA and protein levels than its congeners in melanomas and particularly in advanced lesions. The roles of gal-1 were further investigated in vivo in the highly proliferating and vascularized pseudometastatic B16F10 mouse melanoma model using stable knockdown B16F10 cells and wild-type versus gal-1 knockout mice, and then in vitro in B16F10 tumoral and lung microvascular cells. Gal-1 depletion in the B16F10 tumor cells but not in the tumor-bearing mice significantly increased melanoma-bearing mice survival. Tumor-derived gal-1 thus seems to have more critical roles than the host-derived one. In fact, gal-1 displays distinct effects on the H-Ras-dependent p53/p21 pathways: in primary lung microvessel endothelial cells, gal-1 seems to be involved in the maintenance of senescent status through the induction of both p53 and p21 while it stimulates B16F10 cancer cell proliferation through a p53/p21 decrease.

As a first step to understand the role of TGF-beta and the structurally related activin during melanoma metastasis, expression of metastasis-related genes was examined in murine melanoma cells. Treatment with TGF-beta1 or activin A down-regulated E-cadherin in B16 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In epithelial cells, TGF-beta-induced high mobility group A2 (HMGA2) gene product is suggested to down-regulate E-cadherin through up-regulation of zinc-finger transcription factors Slug and Snail, and basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Twist. Unlike the regulation in epithelial cells, TGF-beta1 treatment rather decreased mRNA expression of HMGA2, indicating a distinct mechanism on TGF-beta/activin-induced down-regulation. Transfection of double-stranded interfering RNA (dsRNAi) for activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) type I receptors revealed that ALK5, a prototype of TGF-beta receptor, mainly transmits TGF-beta signals on the E-cadherin down-regulation at the mRNA level, and that a prototype receptor ALK4 elicited the activin effect. TGF-beta/activin potentiated down-regulation of E-cadherin and HMGA2 also in B16 sublines that are susceptible to metastasis. However, the extent of down-regulation tended to be smaller, and less Smad2, a signal mediator for TGF-beta/activin, was phosphorylated in response to the ligand, resulting from less expression of type I receptors in the B16 sublines. These results suggest that the receptor expression level determines strength of the signals for TGF-beta/activin through phosphorylation of Smad2, which explains pluripotency of the ligand family partly.",

In this study, we investigated the effect of precisely silencing the endo-exonuclease expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) upon treatment with a variety of DNA damaging agents in mouse B16F10 melanoma cells. A maximum of 3.6 to approximately 4-fold reduction in endo-exonuclease mRNA expression was achieved, over a period of 48-72 h of post transfection with a concomitant reduction in protein expression (approximately 4-5 fold), resulting in a substantial reduction (approximately 45-50%) of the corresponding nuclease activity.

These processes critically depend on the interaction of tumor cells with various extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Because only little quantitative information about expression of ECM gene products in general and expression in response to alterations of the surrounding environment is available, the present study was designed. Four human glioblastoma cell lines (U373MG, U138MG, U251MG, GaMG) as well as four human melanoma cell lines (MV3, BLM, 530, IF6) were tested with semiquantitative RT-PCR for their ability to express mRNA of different human ECM components (fibronectin, decorin, tenascin, collagen I, collagen IV, versican). In addition, two human medulloblastoma (MHH-Med 1, MHH-Med 4) and two fibrosarcoma (HT1080, U2OS) cell lines were analyzed. Cells which were grown in DMEM medium containing 10% FCS expressed most of the analyzed protein components. When the same medium, but depleted of ECM proteins by filtrating through a membrane with cut-off at > 100 kD was used, basal mRNA expression of the ECM proteins was changed in most of the examined cell lines. Using serum free conditions, most of the cell lines again showed a variation in the expression pattern of mRNA encoding for the different ECM proteins compared to the other medium conditions. Comparing different cell lines from one tumor entity or different tumor groups, ECM expression was heterogeneous with regard to the different tumor entities as well as within the entities themselves. Migration assays revealed heterogeneous responses between the different cell lines, ECM components and culture conditions, making it difficult to correlate ECM expression patterns and migratory behavior. Our results revealed that all examined cell lines are able to produce ECM proteins in vitro. This suggests that tumor cells can modulate their microenvironment in vitro which has to be taken into consideration for studies related to migration and invasion.",

Hypoxia plays a pivotal role in the formation of VM. Hypoxia-induced Bcl-2 overexpression is observed in many types of tumors including melanoma, in which it is associated with tumorigenicity and angiogenesis. VE-cadherin, the major endothelial adhesion molecule controlling cellular junctions and blood vessel formation, is also overexpressed in melanoma. Despite these connections, whether hypoxia induces VM formation via VE-cadherin regulation by Bcl-2 is not confirmed. We used human melanoma cells to upregulate or knockdown the expression of Bcl-2 to investigate the possible molecular mechanism of VM formation under hypoxia. Bcl-2 overexpression increased VE-cadherin expression and VM formation under normoxia, whereas Bcl-2 siRNA significantly decreased VE-cadherin expression and VM formation under hypoxia. We then demonstrated that Bcl-2 regulated VE-cadherin transcription activity by Western blot, three-dimensional cultures, reporter gene assay, and clinical analysis. Therefore, Bcl-2-dependent VE-cadherin overexpression may be an important mechanism by which hypoxia induces VM.",

The treatment induced similar functional changes in different lesions from the same patient. Stromal and immune response-related genes were the most frequently upregulated, particularly in lesions that responded to treatment by stabilizing or regressing. T-cell infiltration and enhanced major histocompatibility complex class II expression were observed in a subset of patients. Stable, chemo-sensitive lesions exhibited activation of genetic programs related to extracellular matrix remodeling, including increased expression of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) by tumor cells. These events were associated with local response to treatment and with superior survival in our group of patients. In contrast, SPARC expression was downregulated in lesions resistant to DTIC. Thus, chemotherapy drugs originally selected for their direct cytotoxicity to tumor cells may also influence disease progression by inducing changes in the tumor microenvironment.",

In this study, we set up a preclinical study to investigate the usefulness of a DNA vaccine producing mouse HSP105 whole protein for cancer immunotherapy in vivo using BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, Colon26, a syngeneic endogenously HSP105-expressing colorectal cancer cell line, and B16.F10, a melanoma cell line. The DNA vaccine was used to stimulate HSP105-specific T-cell responses. Fifty percent of mice immunized with the HSP105 DNA vaccine completely suppressed the growth of subcutaneous Colon26 or B16.F10 cells accompanied by massive infiltration of both CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells into tumors. In cell transfer or depletion experiments we proved that both CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells induced by these vaccines play critical roles in the activation of antitumor immunity. Evidence of autoimmune reactions was not present in surviving mice that had rejected tumor cell challenges. We found that HSP105 was highly immunogenic in mice and that the HSP105 DNA vaccination induced antitumor immunity without causing autoimmunity.

All of the human tumor cells were heterozygous for the nm23-HI-specific allelic DNA fragments, with no allelic deletions or gross alterations detected.

        "Doc_abstract":"Cancer mortality usually results from the tumor invading the local environment and metastasizing to vital organs, e.g. liver, lung, and brain. Degradation of the extracellular matrix is, therefore, the sine qua non of tumor cell invasion. this degradation is mediated mainly by MMPs, and thus, inhibition of MMP synthesis is a target for anticancer agents. Tumor cells must traverse both the basement membrane (type IV collagen) and the interstitial stroma (type I collagen). Therefore, we used scanning electron microscopy to examine the invasive behavior of several aggressive tumor cell lines, A2058 melanoma cells, and SCC and FaDu squamous cell carcinomas through these matrices; and we monitored the ability of all-trans retinoic acid and several RAR-specific ligands to block invasion. We demonstrate that several retinoids, which are specific RAR alpha, beta, or gamma agonists/antagonists, selectively inhibited MMP synthesis in the three tumor cell lines. However, there was not a common pattern of MMP inhibition by a particular retinoid. For instance, a RAR alpha antagonist suppressed MMP-1 and MMP-2 synthesis in the melanoma cell line, but not in the FaDu or SCC-25 cells. On the other hand, synthesis of MMP-1 and MMP-9 by the FaDu cells was affected hardly at all, while a RAR gamma antagonist reduced the levels of MMP-2. Only all-trans retinoic acid reduced MMP-1 synthesis in these cells. We postulate that the differences may be related to a differential pattern of RAR expression in each of these cells, and that the RARs expressed by each cell line may not be targets of these RAR specific compounds. All-trans retinoic acid is a pan ligand, binding to all three RARs and, therefore, may modulate gene expression more generally. We conclude that the power of these new ligands lies in their specificity, which can be directed towards modulating expression of certain RARs and, thus, of certain MMPs. By blocking MMP synthesis, retinoids may be effective in cancer therapy by decreasing tumor invasiveness.",

The GM-CSF DNA-coated gold particles are delivered to tumor cells using helium pressure with a hand held gene delivery device. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that vaccination of mice with irradiated, GM-CSF-transfected melanoma cells provided protection from subsequent challenges with non-irradiated, non-transfected tumor cells. Ongoing human tumor immunotherapy studies use patients' melanoma or renal carcinoma cells transfected with a retroviral vector containing GM-CSF cDNA as a vaccine to elicit anti-tumor immune responses. PMGT transfection, unlike retroviral transfection, does not require tumor cells to proliferate in vitro to undergo gene transfer. Instead, tumor tissue can be dissociated into small tissue clumps or cell aggregates and then immediately transfected using the gene gun. PMGT physically inserts the DNA without the need for cell surface interaction with viral components or exposure of the patient to viral antigens. As described in this protocol, fresh human sarcoma and melanoma specimens can be transfected with the GM-CSF DNA-coated gold particles with subsequent production of biologically active GM-CSF protein. In this study tumor tissue will be obtained from patients with melanoma or sarcoma. Tumor tissue will be dissociated, irradiated, and transfected with GM-CSF DNA by PMGT. In this ascending dosage study, two dose levels of GM-CSF DNA will be studied in 2 groups of 6 patients each. Patients will receive two intradermal injections of the irradiated, transfected tumor in a single extremity. On days 3 and 14 post-vaccination, patients will undergo surgical excision of the vaccination sites to assess GM-CSF production and infiltration of immune effector cells. On Day 25, patients will undergo DTH testing with intradermal injection in their opposite extremity of 5 x 10(6) irradiated non-transfected autologous tumor cells cryopreserved at the time of vaccine preparation. This injection site will be assessed on day 28 post-vaccination and surgical excision of the DTH testing site will be performed on day 28 if a positive reaction is noted. The patients will be observed for local and systemic toxicity on days 2, 3, 5, 8, 14, 25, and 28 after the vaccination.

Such putative tumor-specific antigens should be recognizable by the immune system. However, malignant cells are of self origin and only poorly immunogenic, which limits their capability to induce an anticancer immune response. To overcome this problem, tumor cells have been isolated, genetically engineered to secrete cytokine gene products and administered as cancer vaccines. We used adenovirus-enhanced transferrinfection (AVET), which allows high-level transient transgene expression, to introduce cytokine gene expression vectors into murine melanoma cells. The efficiency of AVET makes laborious selection and cloning procedures obsolete. We administered such modified tumor cells as cancer vaccines to syngeneic animals and investigated their impact on the induction of anticancer immunity. We found that IL-2 or GM-CSF gene-transfected murine melanoma cells are highly effective vaccines. Both of these cytokine-secreting vaccines cured 80% of animals which bore a subcutaneous micrometastasis prior to treatment, and induced potent antitumor immunity. The generation of antitumor immunity by these cytokine-secreting vaccines requires three different steps: (1) tumor antigen uptake and processing by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) at the site of vaccination; (2) migration of these APCs into the regional lymph nodes where T-cell priming occurs; (3) recirculation of specific, activated T-cells that recognize distinct tumor load and initiate its elimination. Extending our previously reported studies, we have now comprehensively analysed the requirements for effective antitumor vaccination in animals. This may also become the basis for treatment of human cancer patients.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Heparanase (HPSE-1) is involved in the degradation of both cell-surface and extracellular matrix (ECM) heparan sulfate (HS) in normal and neoplastic tissues. Degradation of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) in mammalian cells is dependent upon the enzymatic activity of HPSE-1, an endo-beta-d-glucuronidase, which cleaves HS using a specific endoglycosidic hydrolysis rather than an eliminase type of action. Elevated HPSE-1 levels are associated with metastatic cancers, directly implicating HPSE-1 in tumor progression. The mechanism of HPSE-1 action to promote tumor progression may involve multiple substrates because HS is present on both cell-surface and ECM proteoglycans. However, the specific targets of HPSE-1 action are not known. Of particular interest is the relationship between HPSE-1 and HSPG, known for their involvement in tumor progression. Syndecan-1, an HSPG, is ubiquitously expressed at the cell surface, and its role in cancer progression may depend upon its degradation. Conversely, another HSPG, perlecan, is an important component of basement membranes and ECM, which can promote invasive behavior. Down-regulation of perlecan expression suppresses the invasive behavior of neoplastic cells in vitro and inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo. In this work we demonstrate the following. 1) HPSE-1 cleaves HS present on the cell surface of metastatic melanoma cells. 2) HPSE-1 specifically degrades HS chains of purified syndecan-1 or perlecan HS. 3) Syndecan-1 does not directly inhibit HPSE-1 enzymatic activity. 4) The presence of exogenous syndecan-1 inhibits HPSE-1-mediated invasive behavior of melanoma cells by in vitro chemoinvasion assays. 5) Inhibition of HPSE-1-induced invasion requires syndecan-1 HS chains. These results demonstrate that cell-surface syndecan-1 and ECM perlecan are degradative targets of HPSE-1, and syndecan-1 regulates HPSE-1 biological activity. This suggest that expression of syndecan-1 on the melanoma cell surface and its degradation by HPSE-1 are important determinants in the control of tumor cell invasion and metastasis.",

Propelled by a selective pressure to overcome tissue homeostatic mechanisms, a metastatic \"super-cell\" emerges whose phenotype is associated with the cellular capacity for uncontrolled growth, resistance to apoptosis, high invasive potential, and effective neoangiogenesis. While genetic alterations arise early in the course of melanoma development, the progression toward metastatic disease is accompanied by deregulated expression of a number of transcription factors. In melanoma, acquisition of the metastatic phenotype involves the loss of Activator Protein-2alpha (AP-2alpha) and gain in expression of cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-binding protein/Activating Transcription Factor-1 (CREB/ATF-1) family transcription factors. Together with the upregulation of ATF-2, SNAIL/SLUG, Nuclear Factor kappaB, STAT3 and 5, and other transcription factors, these changes result in the aberrant expression of cellular adhesion molecules, matrix-degrading enzymes as well as other factors that enable a complex interaction of metastatic cells with the extracellular milieu. Similar to the case of oncogene addiction, the tumorigenicity and metastatic potential of melanoma can be greatly inhibited by altering the activity of the above-named transcription factors, therefore indicating new treatment prospects.",

In this report we demonstrate that twelve different Hsp90 inhibitors (iHsp90) share the ability to increase the expression of differentiation antigens and MHC Class I antigens. These iHsp90 are active in several molecular and cellular assays on a series of tumor cell lines, including eleven human melanomas, a murine B16 melanoma, and two human glioma-derived cell lines. Intra-cytoplasmic antibody staining showed that all of the tested iHsp90 increased expression of the melanocyte differentiation antigens Melan-A/MART-1, gp100, and TRP-2, as well as MHC Class I. The gliomas showed enhanced gp100 and MHC staining. Quantitative analysis of mRNA levels showed a parallel increase in message transcription, and a reporter assay shows induction of promoter activity for Melan-A/MART-1 gene. In addition, iHsp90 increased recognition of tumor cells by T cells specific for Melan-A/MART-1. In contrast to direct Hsp90 client proteins, the increased levels of full-length differentiation antigens that result from iHsp90 treatment are most likely the result of transcriptional activation of their encoding genes. In combination, these results suggest that iHsp90 improve recognition of tumor cells by T cells specific for a melanoma-associated antigen as a result of increasing the expressed intracellular antigen pool available for processing and presentation by MHC Class I, along with increased levels of MHC Class I itself. As these Hsp90 inhibitors do not interfere with T cell function, they could have potential for use in immunotherapy of cancer. ",

Surface marker analysis revealed that TILs and PBLs mainly consisted of CD3+ T cells and that TILs generally displayed a lower CD4/CD8 ratio. Differences were found in the expression of CD25 (IL-2 receptor) and DR (MHC class II) antigens, which were increased in TILs, and in the percentage of CD16+ natural killer (NK) cells, which was reduced in TILs as compared to PBLs. Accordingly, the NK activity of TILs was lower than that of PBLs, whereas neither TILs nor PBLs expressed spontaneous cytolytic activity against fresh autologous tumor cells, melanoma cells and the \"NK-resistant\" A549 lung carcinoma cell line. After 4 days of culture in medium with recombinant-interleukin-2 (rIL-2), TILs and PBLs acquired cytolytic activity against all cell targets, but TILs expressed higher levels of cytotoxicity than autologous PBLs only in 3 patients out of 16 tested. More importantly, both TILs and PBLs displayed similar levels of cytotoxic activity against autologous tumor cells. TILs and PBLs from 8 patients were also analyzed by a limiting dilution microculture system. Cloning efficiency was remarkably lower in TILs, and surface marker analysis of T cell clones confirmed that an accumulation of CD8+ lymphocytes, which displayed cytolytic activity in a lectin-dependent assay, occurred at the tumor site. The non-MHC-restricted cytolytic activity of TIL- and PBL-derived T cell clones against K562, A549, and allogeneic melanoma cells and the cytolytic activity against autologous tumor cells showed no significant differences. Only 53% of TIL clones released IL-2 in response to PHA + TPA stimulation, whereas 68% of PBL-derived clones were IL-2 producers.

Also, we found an independent prognostic importance of vascular phenotype by endothelial cell expression of bFGF; cases with positive vessels had the best prognosis and these tumors revealed a low frequency of vascular invasion (14%) when compared with bFGF-negative vessels (47%). This bFGF-negative phenotype was significantly increased in metastatic lesions.

Melanoma vaccines are designed for the purpose of immune modulation and subsequent anti-tumor effects in the process of an active specific immunotherapy.

While these vaccines generated enhanced anti-tumor immunity in a subset of patients, some of which showing prolonged survival compared to historical controls, no clinical benefit has so far been demonstrated in a properly controlled phase III study. New-generation melanoma vaccines, which are based on genetic modifications of tumor cells to express cytokines, generated long-lasting systemic anti-tumor immunity in animal models. Translation of these preclinical results primarily into melanoma patients with advanced diseases, shows the potential of these vaccines to induce systemic anti-tumor immune responses and in some instances tumor regression with acceptably low toxicity. Higher efficacy of this novel vaccine approach would be expected when used in a postsurgical adjuvant setting when the tumor load is small. Also other novel vaccine approaches such as dendritic cell-based therapy hold promise for the treatment of melanoma.

The mRNA of alpha IIb, alpha 5, beta 1 and beta 3 was detectable in the 4 subpopulations by Northern blotting. A gradual increase in mRNAs and cell-surface immunoreactivity of the alpha IIb beta 3 receptor, but not in their gene copies, was observed from the low to the high metastatic subpopulations. The ability of tumor cells to adhere to fibronectin and subendothelial matrix (SEM) increased in parallel. In the high metastatic cells, the alpha IIb beta 3 receptors, but not the alpha 5 beta 1 receptors, were localized to focal adhesion plaques. Incubation of the high metastatic cells with alpha IIb beta 3-specific antibodies reduced their matrix adhesion, TCIPA and lung-colonizing abilities.

However, the mechanisms of lymphatic invasion and metastasis to regional lymph nodes are poorly understood. Nitric oxide is a free radical molecule synthesized from L-arginine by nitric oxide synthases that plays a critical role in various physiological and pathological processes, including tumor growth and angiogenesis. We have tested whether inducible nitric oxide synthase expression correlates with lymphatic vessel density identified with D2-40 antibody and/or blood microvessel density identified with CD105/endoglin in a series of melanocytic nevi (n=28) and cutaneous melanomas (n=38), representative of various pT. Inducible nitric oxide synthase expression was significantly lower in melanocytic nevi in comparison with primary and metastatic melanomas (P<0.001). Mean microvessel density was significantly higher in primary and metastatic melanomas in comparison with melanocytic nevi (P<0.001 for intratumoral and P=0.001 for peritumoral vessels). Vertical growth phase melanomas showed a higher intratumoral microvessel density in comparison with radial growth phase melanomas (P=0.02). The number of peritumoral lymphatics was significantly lower in nevi as compared with primary and metastatic melanomas (P=0.01). No correlation between microvessel or lymphatic vessel and clinical outcome was found in melanomas. A significant direct correlation was observed between inducible nitric oxide synthase immunostaining in melanocytic tumor cells and the density of lymphatic vessels (peritumoral: P=0.001; intratumoral: P=0.08), and the density of peritumoral blood microvessel (P=0.02). Our findings support the hypothesis that inducible nitric oxide synthase is implicated not only in blood, but also in lymphatic vascular neoformation in melanoma.

Biochemical and immunocytochemical evidence shows that the platelet integrin receptor alpha IIb beta 3 is present on the cell surface, at focal adhesion plaques and in the perinuclear region of metastatic B16a murine melanoma cells. Antibody to the fibronectin receptor alpha 5 beta i, inhibits basal adhesion by approx. 30%, whereas antibodies to alpha IIb beta 3 are ineffective. The surface immunoreactivity of tumor cells for alpha IIb beta 3 can be enhanced by pre-treatment (5 min) with a lipoxygenase metabolite of arachidonic acid [i.e. 12-(S)-HETE] in a dose-dependent manner (max. effect approx. 0.1 microM). Other lipoxygenase metabolites are ineffective. B16a cells possess a large intracellular pool of alpha IIb beta 3, from which the receptor complex translocates to the cell surface following 12-(S)-HETE pretreatment. This pre-treatment of tumor cells enhances their adhesion to fibronectin, which is mediated exclusively by alpha IIb beta 3 receptors. 12-(S)-HETE also facilitates the redistribution of alpha IIb beta 3 in the plasma membrane with localization at the focal adhesion plaques. The cytoskeleton of the B16a cell is characterized by an absence of distinct microtubules in interphase cells and the presence of prominent microfilaments and vimentin intermediate filaments. In B16a cells, the disruption of intermediate filaments and/or microfilaments prevents the 12-(S)-HETE-induced increase in plasma membrane alpha IIb beta 3 and enhanced tumor-cell adhesion to fibronectin. The microtubule-disrupting agent, colchicine, is ineffective in both respects. We conclude that the lipoxygenase metabolite of arachidonic acid, 12-(S)-HETE, regulates the surface expression and function of the alpha IIb beta 3 integrin in B16a cells. Further, these data support the hypothesis that microfilaments and intermediate filaments have a profound role in regulating the expression of a multifunctional integrin in B16a tumor cells.",

In tumor progression, it has primarily an immunosuppressive role but is also thought to regulate neovascularization. However, the latter role is still in debate. When B16F10 melanoma was subcutaneously injected into CD73 knockout mice, changes in the tumor vasculature were not always observed. However, we demonstrated earlier that the growth and vascularization of B16F10 melanoma in CD73 knockout mice depend on the low presence of CD73 on tumor cells. To further analyze the role of CD73 on tumor growth and vascularization, we compared the changes in B16F10 melanoma subcutaneously injected into right flank of wild-type mice, CD73 knockout mice lacking host CD73 only, and CD73 knockout mice with tumor cell CD73 either inhibited with AOPCP (adenosine α,β-methylene 5'-diphosphate) or permanently knocked down through genetic modification. We report here that both inhibition and knockdown of tumor CD73 further inhibited tumor growth compared to host CD73 knockout alone. MAP-kinase signaling pathway activation also decreased more strongly in the stable knockdown. There was a significant reduction in the angiogenic activation of blood microvessels as observed by decreased anti-VEGFR2 staining. Stable CD73 knockdown also reduced endothelial cell proliferation as measured by anti-CD105 staining. However, only chemical inhibition with AOPCP significantly augmented the reduction in intratumoral microvessel density induced by host CD73 knockout. Such reduction was not observed when tumor CD73 was knocked down due to the much slower tumor growth and decreased oxygen demand as indicated by the low expression of Bad, a hypoxia marker. Decreased CD73 activity also led to the decreased expression of angiogenic factors, including VEGF and bFGF that was only partially reversed by hypoxia in tumors treated with AOPCP. Both inhibition and knockdown of tumor CD73 significantly decreased tumor macrophage infiltration and induced microenvironment changes, thereby influencing MI or MII macrophage polarization. Additionally, tumor cell CD73 is important in metastasis formation through adenosine-independent attachment to endothelium. We conclude that even low tumor cell CD73 expression has an undeniable role in melanoma progression, including the regulation of many aspects of angiogenesis. CD73 is thus a viable target in anti-angiogenic melanoma therapy. ",

Serum from the mice immunized with tumor-cell vaccine was used to detect IFN-γ expression by ELISA. The expression of TGF-β2, ZEB1, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin of tumor tissues was detected by RT-PCR and immunofluorescence, respectively.;The mice vaccinated with B16F10-ESAT-6-gpi/IL-21 had significantly fewer nodules in the lung and lower lung weight [(285.8 ± 19.01) mg vs. (406.3 ± 27.12) mg], with lower levels of TGF-β2, ZEB1 and N-cadherin proteins but higher level of E-cadherin protein within the tumor tissue, as compared with the control mice. Meanwhile, the immunized mice had significantly increased CD8(+) T cell killing activity [(42.62 ± 3.465)% vs. (22.29 ± 1.804)%] and IFN-γ expression level [(55.200 ± 7.173) pg/ml vs. (6.435 ± 1.339) pg/ml] over the control mice.;The B16F10-ESAT-6-gpi/IL-21 vaccine can inhibit the metastasis of melanoma in the lung in vaccinated melanoma-bearing mice. This inhibitory effect is associated with CD8(+) T cell immune response and a higher level of IFN-γ, which may influence on the mesenchymal-epithelial transition of tumor cells.",

Loss of expression of the p16INK4 tumor suppressor protein, the product of the CDKN2 gene, has been associated with a wide variety of human malignancies. Mutations, loss of heterozygosity and deletions of the CDKN2 locus have been reported in sporadic and familial cutaneous malignant melanomas (CMM). To investigate the role of the alterations of p16 expression in melanoma, we evaluated by immunohistochemistry the p16 expression and cell proliferation in 79 primary CMM and 10 benign melanocytic nevi (BMN). Forty-six melanomas (58%) and all BMN were found to be p16 positive; 33 melanomas (42%) were considered p16 negative. The extent of invasion according to Clark was significantly higher in p16-negative tumors than in p16-positive tumors. Cell proliferation as expressed by the proportion of positive cells in Ki-67 immunostaining was found to be significantly higher in p16-negative tumors than in p16-positive tumors, although there was no significant difference in the mitotic index between p16-positive and p16-negative tumors. In p16-positive tumors, the number of Ki-67-positive cells correlated with the mitotic index; in p16-negative tumors, there was no correlation between these parameters. Our data suggest that loss of p16 expression is more common in advanced melanomas, and that G1/S checkpoint regulation is disrupted in p16-negative melanomas. Our results show that loss of p16 expression is a common event in primary melanomas, which further substantiates the role of p16 as a major tumor suppressor.",

Evidence about the role of CXCR4/CXCL12 axis has been reported in several cancers including melanoma. Our goal was to investigate if CXCR4 expression has a prognostic value in malignant melanoma.;Immunohistochemical expression of CXCR4 was evaluated on 71 specimens of primary cutaneous melanoma with a Breslow tumor thickness of >1 mm after radical resection. Associations between baseline patient features and tumors were analyzed by chi(2) test. The prognostic value of CXCR4 expression was evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses adjusted by age, sex, Breslow tumor thickness, presence of ulceration, and sentinel lymph node metastases.;CXCR4 expression was detected in 31 of 71 (43.6%) primary cutaneous melanomas. Membrane or cytoplasmic staining for CXCR4 protein was absent in 56% of the tumors. The positive cases were divided into three score classes according to their staining: low in 15 cases (21%), moderate in 10 (14%), and high in 6 (8%). After a median follow-up of 38 months, 26 patients progressed (16 of 26 expressed CXCR4) and 19 died (12 of 19 expressed CXCR4). The CXCR4 expression on tumor cells was correlated with an unfavorable prognosis with a median disease-free and overall survival of 22 and 35 months, respectively. The hazard ratios of relapse and death, compared with patients with CXCR4-negative tumors, were 2.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-6.1) and 3.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-7.2), respectively. Median time-to-event (progression and survival) was not reached in patients with CXCR4-negative tumors. In the multivariate analysis, CXCR4 expression, presence of ulceration, and sentinel lymph node status emerged as independent prognostic factors.;This article provides the first evidence that CXCR4 expression could be an independent and powerful prognostic marker in primary cutaneous malignant melanomas.",

A direct correlation was observed between the levels of cathepsin B mRNA and the metastatic potentials of these three melanoma variants. The relative amount of cathepsin B mRNA in B16a, which is the melanoma variant with the highest metastatic potential, was at least 3 times greater than that found in any of the normal murine tissues surveyed. Similar results were obtained in analyses of either solid tumors or of cultures of tumor cells, confirming that the tumor cells themselves were the source for the elevated expression of cathepsin B mRNA. Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of three cathepsin B transcripts of 5.0, 4.0, and 2.2 kilobases in the melanoma variants, while only the 2.2-kilobase transcript was seen in the normal murine tissues. Concurrently with the mRNA analysis, enzyme assays for cathepsin B activity were also performed using synthetic peptide substrates. The assays revealed increased cathepsin B activities in the melanoma variants, corresponding well with the increased cathepsin B mRNA levels, and in addition demonstrated that all three of the melanoma variants secreted a latent form of cathepsin B into conditioned medium, which could be activated by limited proteolysis with pepsin.

This technique uses the human monoclonal antibody (HumAb) L612, specific to a tumor-related antigen (ganglioside) GM3 that is expressed on the cell surface of human tumor cells and not normal cells. L612 coupled to a DNA oligonucleotide for exponential amplification by DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to enhance the detection signal. The DNA-HumAb conjugate was assessed for detection of a small number of human cancer cells after PCR amplification and Southern blot analysis. To assess the assay specificity human melanoma and other cancer cell lines, as well as healthy donor and melanoma patients, bloods were assessed. Cellular immuno-PCR requires < 1 ng/ml DNA-HumAb complex and was shown to have a detection level of < 10 cells in titration studies in which melanoma cells were diluted in 2 million healthy donor peripheral blood lymphocytes.

This observation provides support for the concept that it is the transformed phenotype which is specifically sensitive to CAPE. In the present study, we have determined the effect of CAPE on the growth and antigenic phenotype of a human melanoma cell line, HO-1, and a human glioblastoma multiforme cell line, GBM-18. For comparison, we have also tested the effects of mezerein (MEZ), mycophenolic acid (MPA) and retinoic acid (RA), which can differentially modulate growth, differentiation and the antigenic phenotype in these human tumor cell lines. Growth of both cell lines was suppressed by CAPE in a dose-dependent fashion, with HO-1 cells being more sensitive than GBM-18 cells. The antiproliferative effect of CAPE was enhanced in both cell types if CAPE and MEZ were used in combination. Growth suppression was associated with morphological changes in H0-1 cells, suggesting induction of a more differentiated phenotype. CAPE also differentially modulated the expression of several antigens on the surface of the two tumor cell lines. These results suggest a potential role for CAPE as an antitumor agent, an antigenic modulating agent and possibly a differentiation inducing agent.",

In this report, we present a new strategy involving molecular subtraction to identify novel melanoma-associated gene sequences. Toward this end, 156 complementary DNA clones were isolated with a subtracted melanoma complementary DNA probe (melanoma minus lung carcinoma) after screening 2 x 10(4) independent recombinants of a melanoma expression library by in situ plaque hybridization. These clones were then polymerase chain reaction amplified, screened for duplication, and categorized into 53 discrete genes. By applying poissonian distribution to the numbers of duplicate isolates, we found most of the genes to be rare messages, present at less than 1 copy/200 molecules of mRNA in a typical somatic cell. Messages specific for a type of tissue are usually expressed in this range. The expression of the 53 genes was further studied in human tumor cell lines and normal tissues. Partial sequence data obtained for 20 complementary DNA clones revealed 8 novel human genes. The mRNA transcripts for 5 of the novel genes were identified by Northern blot analysis. Thus, molecular subtraction appears to be applicable for the identification of novel tumor-associated sequences. Some of the potential advantages and limitations of this technology are discussed, including its application to the molecular characterization of immunogenic melanoma-associated antigens.",

These tumors are usually defined by an enrichment of cancer stem cells and characterized by the higher expression of chemotherapy-resistant proteins. In this work we develop the first aptamer that targets chemotherapy-resistant tumors expressing MRP1 through a novel combinatorial peptide-cell SELEX. With the use of the MRP1 aptamer we engineer a MRP1-CD28 bivalent aptamer that is able to bind MRP1-expressing tumors and deliver the CD28 costimulatory signal to tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. The bi-specific aptamer is able to enhance costimulation in chemotherapy-resistant tumors. Melanoma-bearing mice systemically treated with MRP1-CD28 bivalent aptamer show reduced growth, thus proving an improved mice survival.Besides, we have designed a technically feasible and translational whole-cell vaccine (Aptvax). Disaggregated cells from tumors can be directly decorated with costimulatory ligand aptamers to generate the vaccine Aptvax.

Multiple indirect arguments have supported the view that the immune system may control, at least in certain cases, malignant cell growth while direct demonstration is still lacking in the human. In an attempt to address this issue, we have selected a study model, namely spontaneously regressive melanoma. A primary cutaneous lesion was investigated. T cell repertoire analysis showed the in situ amplification of at least two tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TILs) expressing the V beta 13 and V beta 16 variable TCR gene segments respectively. The two clones were precisely characterized by sequence of the TCR beta chain junctional region. Further functional study demonstrated that both lymphocytes displayed a selective cytotoxic activity against autologous tumor cells. The V beta 16+ cells, predominant in vivo, were shown to be closely opposed to the melanoma cells. Together, these studies demonstrated the existence of a local adaptative immune response associated to tumor regression, thus strongly supporting the validity of the immunosurveillance concept. A gastric metastasis which occurred three years after the primary lesion has been studied here. Overexpression of the V beta 13 and V beta 16 TCR segments was no longer detected by direct PCR analysis in situ. Sequencing transcripts from V beta 13+ and V beta 16+ TILs confirmed that the two CTLs, identified in the primary lesions, were not represented with high frequency. The V beta 13+ cell was however shown to be present while the V beta 16+ CTL was not detected. Yet, characterization of a tumor cell line derived from the gastric site indicated that the peptidic antigen(s) which induced the initially successfully immune response was still expressed. The present data illustrate that it has become possible to perform very precise analysis of local immune responses during cancer development. Such an improvement together with the recently initiated molecular characterization of tumor associated peptidic antigens, should provide the basis for improved strategies of cancer immunotherapy.",

In melanomas, LPHA staining colocalized with CD63 and gp100. In pigmented melanomas, the vesicles were melanized and are known as \"coarse melanin.\" LPHA-positive, coarse melanin was a feature of both tumor cells and melanophages and accounted for the well-known hypermelanotic regions of primary melanomas. LPHA-positive tumor cells varied widely in primaries (melanoma and others), ranging from 0 to 100% for a given tumor, whereas metastases were far more homogeneous (P = 0.0080), with vesicular, LPHA-positive tumor cells comprising >75% of 15 of 16 metastatic melanomas and renal cell carcinomas. In studies by others, GNT-V elicited formation of autophagy-dependent, LPHA-positive vesicles in mink lung alveolar cells (Hariri et al., Mol. Biol. Cell, 11: 255-268, 2000), suggesting that the coarse vesicles in tumors reported here may have been induced by GNT-V. Expression of the phenotype was so common and pervasive that it appeared to be an integral component of the biology of tumor progression. The origin of this phenotype and its biological significance are as yet unclear and will require considerable further study.",

The development of tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen (TACA) vaccines has been problematic due to poor immunogenicity. However, when appropriate targets can be identified, passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against TACAs has been shown to have antitumor activity. Fas ligand (FasL) is a transmembrane protein that induces apoptosis in cells expressing its receptor, Fas. When grafted into mice, FasL-expressing tumor cells break immunologic tolerance to self-antigens and induce antibody-mediated tumor immunity. Here, five IgM mAbs were produced from mice vaccinated with FasL-expressing B16F10 mouse melanoma cells. They recognize various syngeneic and allogeneic murine tumor cell lines. One mAb, TM10, recognizes a range of human tumor cell lines, including melanoma, prostate, and ovarian cancer. It does not bind to untransformed cells. The epitopes recognized by all the mAbs were carbohydrates expressed on proteins. Using carbohydrate microarrays, the antigenic targets of TM10 were found to be high-mannose core structures of N-linked glycans. In normal cells, high-mannose clusters are hidden by extensive saccharide branching but they become exposed in cancer cells as a result of abnormal glycosylation pathways. Vaccination with FasL-expressing tumors therefore enables the immune system to break tolerance to self-antigens, allowing identification of novel TACAs that can form the basis of future humoral anticancer therapy.",

We show that IL-10-pretreatment of DC not only reduces their allostimulatory capacity, but also induces a state of alloantigen-specific anergy in both primed and naive (CD45RA+) CD8(+) T cells. To investigate the influence of IL-10-treated DC on melanoma-associated antigen-specific T cells, we generated a tyrosinase-specific CD8(+) T-cell line by several rounds of stimulation with the specific antigen. After coculture with IL-10-treated DC, restimulation of the T-cell line with untreated, antigen-pulsed DC demonstrated peptide-specific anergy in the tyrosinase-specific T cells. Addition of IL-2 to the anergic T cells reversed the state of both alloantigen- or peptide-specific anergy. In contrast to optimally stimulated CD8(+) T cells, anergic tyrosinase-specific CD8(+) T cells, after coculture with peptide-pulsed IL-10-treated DC, failed to lyse an HLA-A2-positive and tyrosinase-expressing melanoma cell line. Thus, our data demonstrate that IL-10-treated DC induce an antigen-specific anergy in cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells, a process that might be a mechanism of tumors to inhibit immune surveillance by converting DC into tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells.",

Apoptotic B16 cells induced more IL-10 secretion by DC than live B16 cells.

Collectively, our data showed that the ability of Slit3 to reduce the migratory activity of synovial cells from patients with RA and melanoma cells can be mimicked by small protein fragments derived from Slit3.

Loss of E-cadherin, which is caused by several tumor-promoting factors, is associated with metastasis and poor prognosis in many neoplasms. In this study, we aimed to identify small molecule compounds that restore the expression of E-cadherin, because these molecules are most likely to suppress tumor malignancy by restoring E-cadherin function and/or by inhibiting signals that suppress E-cadherin expression. Here, we developed a fluorescence screen system based on E-cadherin expression. A pilot drug library screen revealed that methotrexate (MTX) strongly induces E-cadherin expression in a colorectal cancer cell line, SW620. From the screen for 9600 compounds, we identified 9 hit compounds, which restored the expression of E-cadherin in SW620 and/or a melanoma cell line, SK-MEL-28. We confirmed that MTX and the other identified compounds transcriptionally promote E-cadherin expression. Among these, 2 compounds suppressed migration/invasion capacity in colorectal cancer cells and 3 in melanoma cells. A compound reduced SW620 migration and invasion with subtle effects on cell viability in SW620, SK-MEL-28, and a non-tumor cell line, HaCaT, with decrease in AKT and ERK1/2 protein levels. One of the other compounds reduced SK-MEL-28 cell migration and invasion and affected the viability only of SW620 and SK-MEL-28 cells but not HaCaT cells.

        "Doc_abstract":"An early event in melanocytic tumor growth is the upregulation of Notch signaling. When an active form of Notch1 is overexpressed in primary human melanocytes, it increases cell growth, survival and invasive properties, promoting melanoma progression. Recent evidence suggested that tumor initiation and growth are driven by a subset of tumor-initiating cells termed cancer stem cells. Notch1 plays a predominant role in the maintenance of melanoblasts, including melanocyte stem cells, by preventing initiation of apoptosis. Moreover, the importance of Notch1 in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis is supported by growing evidence in various cancers. Nestin has been widely used as a marker for melanocyte stem cells as well as an angiogenic marker to evaluate neovascularity of endothelial cells in tumors. To gain an insight into the impact of Notch1 activation on the maintenance of melanocyte stem cells and angiogenesis in melanoma, the expression levels of activated Notch1 and nestin were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 114 primary cutaneous melanomas and 35 lymph node metastases. Activated Notch1 and nestin expression was also evaluated in four dysplastic melanocytic nevi. This study provides evidence that activated Notch1 is overexpressed in cutaneous melanoma, in tumor cells as well as in microvessel endothelium, and that it can promote tumor angiogenesis. Indeed, the overexpression of activated Notch1 in both tumor and vascular endothelial cells was significantly associated with microvascular density in melanoma samples. Thus, activated Notch1 inhibitors may provide a therapeutic strategy in the treatment of melanoma by blocking tumor-associated vascularization. ",

In this study, we investigated how silencing of beta-catenin affects metastatic aspects of melanoma cells.

Pure DM displays a low density of fusiform melanocytes in a collagen-rich matrix. In mixed DM, tumor cell density is higher, and parts of the tumor lack abundant stromal fibrosis. Both pure and mixed DMs usually express S100 protein homogenously. We report herein an unusual biphenotypic tumor characterized by the association of a pure DM with an undifferentiated solid spindle cell nodule. It occurred on the scalp of a 66-year-old man. A biopsy of the undifferentiated spindle cell nodule was initially interpreted at a commercial laboratory as atypical fibroxanthoma. The pure DM was seen only in the excisional specimen. All cells of the pure DM stained for S100 protein and SOX10. The adjacent solid sarcomatoid spindle cell nodule lacked expression of S100 protein, SOX10, as well as melan-A, gp100, and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor in >95% of its tumor cells. Although focal expression of melanocyte differentiation antigens in the solid tumor component made us favor a combined DM with sarcomatoid dedifferentiation, we also considered the possibility of a collision scenario, that is, a pleomorphic dermal sarcoma incidentally colliding with a DM. To further assess a possible relationship of the sarcomatoid nodule with the DM, we performed next-generation sequencing analysis on each component separately. The analysis revealed shared chromosomal copy number changes and a high number of common mutations, thereby supporting the concept of a DM with a dedifferentiated sarcomatoid component.

Vaccination with irradiated tumor cells engineered to secrete granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) augments host immunity through improved tumor antigen presentation by recruited dendritic cells and macrophages. By analyzing the immune response of a metastatic melanoma patient who achieved a long-term response to vaccination, we identified melanoma inhibitor of apoptosis protein (ML-IAP) as a target for immune-mediated tumor destruction. Vaccination stimulated a coordinated cellular and humoral reaction to ML-IAP that was associated with extensive tumor necrosis, whereas lethal disease progression was linked with the loss of ML-IAP expression and the absence of intra-tumoral lymphocyte infiltrates. These findings demonstrate that ML-IAP can serve as a tumor rejection antigen, although additional vaccine targets will be required to circumvent immune escape and tumor heterogeneity.",

Cells were injected into the pleural cavities of syngeneic immunocompetent mice, and MPE volume and pleural tumors were quantified at necropsy (day 14). MCP-1 and other mediators were determined by cytometric bead array and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and mononuclear and endothelial cells were identified by immunolabeling of F4/80 and factor VIII-related antigen respectively. Mouse survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Vascular permeability in mice with MPE was assessed using albumin-binding Evans blue. Statistical tests were two-sided.;LLC cells expressing shRNA against MCP-1 elaborated less than 5% of the MCP-1 level in cells expressing nonspecific shRNA (control cells), and intrapleural delivery of these cells resulted in less MPE (mean MPE volume = 86 and 585 muL, respectively; difference = 499 muL; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 331 to 669 muL; P < .001), reduced MCP-1 levels in the pleural fluid, and lower mortality than when control cells were delivered. Overexpression of MCP-1 in intrapleurally injected B16 melanoma cells led to increased MPE and reduced survival.

We therefore developed a novel real time nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to quantify rare transcripts using the light cycler system. Tyrosinase mRNA expressed by melanocytes and melanoma cells was used as a model. Ten-milliliter samples of ethylenediaminetetra-acetate (EDTA) blood from healthy volunteers were spiked with 10-10(4) RVH melanoma cells. Following RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, a nested PCR with specific primers was performed. Resonance energy transfer between fluorescently labeled hybridization probes specific for the amplified portion of the tyrosinase transcript allowed continuous monitoring of the second round of PCR. The number of preamplification cycles in the first round was varied between 20 and 35. Our results show that nested PCR revealed quantitative data, regardless of the number of cycles used in the first round. The range of real time data can span four logs of target mRNA concentrations (1-10(3) tumor cells/ml of blood) and the x-intercepts of the log phases were always consistent with the amount of transcripts in the sample. These experiments indicate that nested PCR, which is much more sensitive than single-round PCR, is a useful tool for the quantification of rare transcripts--a result with important implications for the study of minimal residual disease. The assay is currently being adapted for other tumor types including leukemias as well as other solid tumors.",

Multiple mechanisms of melanoma-induced immune escape, which are likely to cause the failure of the spontaneous or vaccine-induced immune responses to promote tumor regression in humans, have been elucidated. In addition, a number of negative factors in the tumor microenvironment dampen antitumor immune responses, including cytokines (like transforming growth factor-β or interleukin-10), suppressive cells (regulatory T cells and myelosuppressive dendritic cells), defective antigen presentation by tumor cells (human leukocyte antigen or T antigen expression loss, antigen processing machinery defects), amino acid catabolizing enzymes (indoleamine-2-3 dioxygenase, arginase), and immune inhibitory pathways (like cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4/cluster of differentiation 28, programmed death 1/programmed death 1 ligand 1).

        "Doc_abstract":"While there are many obstacles to immune destruction of autologous tumors, there is mounting evidence that tumor antigen recognition does occur. Unfortunately, immune recognition rarely controls clinically significant tumors. Even the most effective immune response will fail if tumors fail to express target antigens. Importantly, reduced tumor antigen expression often results from changes in gene regulation rather than irrevocable loss of genetic information. Such perturbations are often reversible by specific compounds or biological mediators, prompting a search for agents with improved antigen-enhancing properties. Some recent findings have suggested that certain conventional chemotherapeutic agents may have beneficial properties for cancer treatment beyond their direct cytotoxicities against tumor cells. Accordingly, we screened an important subset of these agents, topoisomerase inhibitors, for their effects on antigen levels in tumor cells. Our analyses demonstrate upregulation of antigen expression in a variety of melanoma cell lines and gliomas in response to nanomolar levels of certain specific topoisomerase inhibitors. To demonstrate the ability of CD8+ T cells to recognize tumors, we assayed cytokine secretion in T cells transfected with T cell receptors directed against Melan-A/MART-1 antigen. Three days of daunorubicin treatment resulted in enhanced antigen expression by tumor cells, in turn inducing co-cultured antigen-specific T cells to secrete Interleukin-2 and Interferon-γ. These results demonstrate that specific topoisomerase inhibitors can augment melanoma antigen production, suggesting that a combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy may be of potential value in the treatment of otherwise insensitive cancers.",

Furthermore, specific human leukocyte antigen-restricted T cell activation is hypothesized to occur in response to peptide-based immunotherapy, which may lead to the preferential killing of tumor cells bearing the relevant MA. The development of melanoma antigen-loss variants may subsequently occur in vivo.;Analysis of 532 melanoma lesions from 204 patients was performed on fine-needle aspiration biopsy specimens. Lesions were graded for the expression of the MAs gp100 and MART-1 with use of immunocytochemistry. A total of 351 melanoma lesions were divided into cohorts on the basis of the treatment received. The pretreatment group (n = 175) consisted of lesions obtained before any form of gp100 immunotherapy, with the posttreatment group (n = 176) consisting of lesions obtained after vaccination with a modified gp100 epitope, gp209-2M +/- interleukin 2 (IL-2).;The percentage of lesions not expressing the gp100 antigen is greater than the percentage not expressing MART-1 (26% vs 14%). The frequency of lesions with high expression (> 75%) of gp100 significantly decreased with therapy (47% vs 34%) and conversely negative lesions increased (18% vs 29%). Treatment of lesions with peptide alone (no IL-2) revealed a significant decrease in gp100 expression (47% vs 32%), enhanced with the addition of IL-2 to therapy (47% vs 35%). The expression of MART-1 remained essentially unchanged unless IL-2 was added (54% vs 54%, MART-1 peptide alone, 54% vs 43%, MART-1 peptide + IL-2). Of 94 patients (181 lesions) assessed for gp100 expression before treatment, 10 patients responded to therapy. Pretreatment lesions in responding patients expressed some level of gp100 in all cases compared with 27% of nonresponding lesions, which were negative for gp100 expression. CONCLUSIONS. This study indirectly demonstrates that vaccination with an MA-derived peptide can result in immune selection in vivo.

It enhances solid tumor growth and provides an ability to establish metastasis at peripheral sites by tumor cell migration. Thymosin beta-4 (TB4) is an actin-sequestering protein to control cytoskeletal reorganization. Here, we investigated whether angiogenesis and tumor metastasis are dependent on hypoxia conditioning-induced TB4 expression in B16F10 melanoma cells. TB4 expression in B16F10 cells was increased by hypoxia conditioning in a time-dependent manner. In addition, we found an increase of angiogenesis and HIF-1α expression in TB4-transgenic (Tg) mice as compared to wildtype mice. When wound healing assay was used to assess in vitro tumor cell migration, hypoxia conditioning for 1 h enhanced B16F10 cell migration. When TB4 expression in B16F10 cells was inhibited by the infection with small hairpin (sh) RNA of TB4 cloned in lentiviral vector, tumor cell migration was retarded. In addition, hypoxia conditioning-induced tumor cell migration was reduced by the infection of lentiviral shRNA of TB4. HIF-1α stabilization and the expression of VEGF isoform 165 and 121 in hypoxia were also reduced by the infection of lentiviral shRNA of TB4 in B16F10 cells. We also found an increase of tumor growth and lung metastasis count in TB4-Tg mice as compared to wildtype mice. Collectively, hypoxia conditioning induced tumor cell migration by TB4 expression-dependent HIF-1α stabilization. It suggests that TB4 could be a hypoxia responsive regulator to control tumor cell migration in angiogenesis and tumor metastasis.",

PDGF is made up as dimers of A and B polypeptide chains which are combined to generate the three isoforms of PDGF (AA, AB, BB). These bind with different specificities and affinities to two types of cell surface receptors (the alpha-receptor and the beta-receptor), both being members of the protein tyrosine kinase family of growth factor receptors. A number of human tumor cell lines, particularly those established from glioma and sarcoma, have been shown to produce PDGF and express the cognate receptor type. In these instances, tumor cell growth may be enhanced by an autocrine receptor activation. In other tumor cell types, where PDGF is produced in the absence of receptor expression, the growth factor may act in a paracrine fashion.

This report shows that u-PA is an autocrine mitogen in the human melanoma cell line GUBSB and that inhibition of receptor-bound u-PA by specific anti-u-PA antibodies causes a significant suppression of cell proliferation in this system. The GUBSB cell line secretes 70-80% of the u-PA in its active form and expresses high-affinity u-PA receptors with a Kd of 5.2 x 10(-10) M and 2.8 x 10(4) binding sites per cell. Approximately 70% of the u-PA receptors on these cells are occupied by endogenously secreted u-PA. Addition of the monoclonal anti-u-PA antibody MPW5UK (10 nM), directed against the active site of u-PA, twice daily to the cell cultures resulted in a significant decrease of [3H]thymidine incorporation by the tumor cells, whereas a 10 times higher concentration of the monoclonal antibody MPW4UK, which does not inhibit plasminogen activator activity of u-PA, was necessary to achieve the same effect. In addition, diisopropyl fluorophosphate-inactivated u-PA, in a concentration 50-fold higher than the concentration necessary to saturate the u-PA receptor (250 pM), decreased [3H]thymidine incorporation similarly to the specific antibody, proving that active u-PA is required for the mitogenic effect. Inhibition of endogenous u-PA production by cycloheximide reduced [3H]thymidine incorporation significantly; after addition of exogenous u-PA, [3H]thymidine incorporation increased again in the cycloheximide-treated cells. Therefore, inhibition of receptor-bound u-PA might represent a tool not only to inactivate cell-bound proteolytic activity, necessary for invasion, but also to exert a specific antiproliferative effect on certain tumor cells.",

Under these culture conditions, cells of the Leu-11+ fraction acquired a stronger LAK activity against fresh autologous or allogeneic melanoma cells as compared with Leu-11- cells or unfractionated PBL. To better characterize the cells responsible for this cytolytic activity, we directly cloned Leu-11+ and Leu-11- FACS-sorted cells in the presence of 1% PHA, irradiated spleen feeder cells, and rIL 2. From 6 to 10% of the Leu-11+ cells and from 42 to 66% of the Leu-11- cells plated gave rise to clonal progenies that were tested simultaneously for cytolytic activity against fresh melanoma cells and NK-sensitive K562 target cells in a 4-hr 51Cr-release assay. Most of the Leu-11+ microcultures lysed fresh melanoma target cells (35 out of 38 and 26 out of 34 in two separate experiments), whereas only a few clones derived from the Leu-11- cell fraction had this capability (four out of 45 and one out of 41). All the clones lysing fresh melanoma cells also efficiently killed K562 target cells, whereas other clones lysing only K562 could be found among Leu-11+ and Leu-11- clones. Nine clones expressing LAK activity were tested for their reactivity against a panel of different tumor target cells. All clones were able to lyse a broad panel of target cells including NK-sensitive and NK-resistant cultured or noncultured human tumor target cells, as well as mouse tumor cell lines. Surface marker analysis of 14 clones displaying LAK activity, all derived from Leu-11+ cells, showed that they were all T3 (CD3)-, whereas 10 out of 14 expressed the T11 (CD2) antigen and only four were weakly stained by an anti-T8 (CD8) mAb. All 14 clones expressed the T40 (CD7) T cell marker and DR and LFA-1 antigens.

        "Doc_abstract":"Downregulation of MHC class Ia molecule expression is a widespread mechanism used by tumor cells to escape antitumor T-cell-mediated immune responses. However, it is not known why NK cells cannot lyse these MHC class-Ia-deficient tumor targets. Tumors must select additional routes of escape from NK cells. An attractive hypothesis is that the aberrant expression of nonclassical HLA class Ia molecules in tumors provides the required inhibitory signal to NK cells, rendering tumor cells resistant to NK lysis. To analyze the possible role of HLA-E molecules in providing tumor cells with an NK escape mechanism, we studied the cell surface expression of this HLA class Ib molecule in a variety of tumor cell lines with well-defined HLA class Ia alterations. Tests were done with the monoclonal antibody 3D12 recognizing cell surface HLA-E molecules. Our results indicate that HLA-E was mainly detected in leukemia-derived cell lines. In addition, HLA-E was detected in tumor cell lines of different origin. This expression was related with the availability of free beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m) in the cytoplasm of tumor cells. Expression was detected in tumor cell lines showing an imbalance in heavy chain/beta(2)m expression, particularly in tumor cell lines with alterations in the expression of heavy-chain genes. Several lines of evidence favor these conclusions: (1) In the FM55 and NW145 melanoma tumor systems, the reduction in HLA class Ia expression paralleled the increased cell surface detection of HLA-E. (2) A cervical tumor (808) and a melanoma cell line (R22.2) expressing a single HLA-A1 allele also expressed HLA-E. (3) The addition of human beta(2)m to tumor cell lines that expressed the HLA-E(G) allele increased HLA-E cell surface expression. (4) There was no HLA-E cell surface expression in tumor cell lines with total loss of HLA class Ia expression, including cell lines with low transcription of HLA class I heavy chains or with beta(2)m mutations. Our findings suggest that the biological consequences of these cumulative genetic and molecular changes in tumor cells lead to the appearance of HLA-E in a limited number of tumor cell lines with peculiar phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, namely: HLA-class Ia downregulation, free beta(2)m and HLA-E(G) genotype. The aberrant HLA-E expression might be of particular biological relevance in those HLA tumor phenotypes that express a single HLA-A allele when NK inhibition is markedly reduced due to the downregulation of HLA-B and -C alleles.",

The antibodies were used to target specific cell-surface receptors of the integrin type expressed by three human tumor cell lines, a melanoma (M21), and osteosarcoma (KRIB) and a fibroblastoma (WI-38). Based on in vitro adhesion assays and flow cytometric analysis, we found that all three cell lines interacted with gamma1(RGD)3 but not with gamma1RGD. Binding of tumor cells to surface-immobilized gamma1(RGD)3 was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the RGD-containing synthetic peptides GdRGDSP and RGDS.

They named the process \"vasculogenic mimicry\" (VM). Folberg used PAS staining to show VM network, and identified 7 morphologic patterns of PAS-positive channels uveal melanomas which were confirmed as tubular type and patterned matrix type. Maniotis suggested PAS-positive patterns of VM in uveal melanoma are indeed a form of tumor microcirculation which is different from angiogenesis, and it is not a stromal host response at the interface between the tumor and the surrounding host stroma. VM has also been observed in carcinomas of the breast, prostate, ovary and lung, glioblastoma, synoviosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and phaeochromocytoma, and in the process of placenta formation from cytotrophoblasts. The molecular \"signature\" of aggressive melanoma cells is illustrative of an undifferentiated cell with a gene expression profile that is similar to that of embryonic-like cells.

The two malignancies are poorly responsive to conventional treatment regimens such as chemotherapy. Temozolomide (TMZ) is a DNA-alkylating agent used for the treatment of glioma, astrocytoma, and melanoma. Resistance to alkylating agents such as TMZ correlates with increased expression of DNA repair protein O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). Several studies in animal models have demonstrated that decreasing MGMT level with gene therapy could overcome TMZ resistance and enhance tumor cell death. In the present review, we provide an overview of recent advances in this field.",

Secondary objectives included validation of the gene delivery technology (particle-mediated gene transfer), determining the host immune response to the tumor after vaccination, and monitoring patients for evidence of antitumor response. Sixteen patients were treated with either of two different doses of GM-CSF-treated tumor cells. One patient received treatment with both doses of tumor cells. No treatment-related local or systemic toxicity was noted in any patient. Patients administered 100% treated cells (i.e., with a preparation of tumor cells that had all been exposed to GM-CSF DNA transfection) had a more extensive lymphocytic infiltrate at the vaccine site than did patients given 10% treated cells (a preparation of tumor cells in which 10% had been exposed to GM-CSF transfection) or nontreated tumor. The generation of a systemic immune response to autologous tumor by a delayed-type hypersensitivity response to the intradermal placement of nontransfected tumor cells was noted in one patient. One patient had a transient partial response of metastatic tumor sites. The entire procedure, from tumor removal to vaccine placement, was accomplished in less than 6 hr in all patients.

The present study was undertaken to investigate the possible relationship between cell surface receptors for two such growth factors: the c-Met proto-oncogene, which constitutes the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF), and the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R). Their role as a prognostic factor was also clarified.;Paraffin-embedded tumor specimens from 132 patients with primary uveal melanoma were analyzed by using well-established specific antibodies against c-Met and IGF-1R. The intercorrelation of receptor expression and association with melanoma-related survival of patients were determined by univariate and multivariate analyses.;Whereas the expression of both IGF-1R and c-Met was significantly associated with melanoma-specific mortality by univariate analysis (P = 0.004 and P = 0.007, respectively) only IGF-1R showed independent prognostic value by multivariate analysis, P = 0.004. The prognostic value of IGF-1R was stronger than such currently used prognostic parameters as tumor cell type and tumor diameter (P = 0.021 and P = 0.026, respectively). The expression patterns of the two growth factors receptors were weakly intercorrelated.;In conclusion, the data suggest that the receptors for IGF-1 and HGF/SF may play a role in the spread of uveal melanoma and its affinity to the liver. The strong correlation between IGF-1R expression and melanoma-specific mortality points to the use of IGF-1R as a prognostic tool.",

Our data demonstrate that VEGFR-1 and to a lesser extent VEGFR-2 are expressed in a number of human tumor tissues and derived cells in culture. VEGFR-1 protein is expressed in 26 of 42 glioma tissues, 22 of which show a coexpression of VEGFR-1 with VEGFR-2; 1 glioma tissue expresses exclusively VEGFR-2. In the derived glioma cell cultures, we found VEGFR-1 mRNA expression in 6 of 11 cultures, with one coexpressing VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. Of four established glioma cell lines, two expressed VEGFR-1. In addition VEGFR-1 protein expression was demonstrated in 30 of 37 tumor tissues of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck, with VEGFR-2 coexpression in 15 tissues and an expression of VEGFR-2 alone in 1 tissue. Derived tumor cell cultures showed mRNA expression of VEGFR-1 alone in seven of seven cases. Established melanoma cell lines expressed VEGFR-1 mRNA in four of five lines, with VEGFR-2 coexpression in two lines. Concerning the functional significance of VEGF receptor expression, VEGF treatment of VEGFR-1-expressing tumor cells induced the inhibition of cell proliferation by 25 to 55% and the inhibition of tumor cell migration by 29 to 55%. Thus our data indicate that the coexpression of VEGF and VEGFR-1 in tumor cells could have an inhibitory effect on tumor cell proliferation and migration, a mechanism possibly induced as a response to a deficiency in nutrient and oxygen supply.",

Expression of FAK-CD inhibited cell growth in BT474 human breast cancer cells and C8161 human melanoma cells. To characterize the nature of growth inhibition, we developed an inducible system of FAK-CD expression and demonstrated that the induced FAK-CD protein localized to focal adhesions, causing cellular rounding, an irreversible loss of adhesion, and subsequent cell death.

Thus, in the present study, the anti-metastatic mechanism of aqueous extract of Cambodian Phellinus linteus (CPL) was evaluated. Cambodian mushroom was identified as a Phellinus species with 99% homology of Phellinus linteus by DNA sequence analysis and comparison by the National Center for Biotechnology Information. CPL did not exhibit any significant cytotoxicity against B16BL6 cells, invasive melanoma cells at 1 mg/ml. However, CPL inhibited platelet aggregation induced by B16BL6 cells and also disrupted the adhesion to gelatin and invasion of B16BL6 cells in a concentration dependent manner. Similarly, CPL dose-dependently inhibited the pulmonary metastatic colonies in C57BL/6 mice intravenously injected by B16BL6 cells up to 55.5% at a dose of 50 mg/kg compared with untreated control. CPL also down-regulated the expression of urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA), one of key proteins associated with invasion and metastasis of tumor cells in a concentration dependent fashion, while CPL didn't significantly affect the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP-2) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

The cytotoxic activity of the vaccine-induced CTLs was independent of GD2 expression, suggesting recognition of a novel tumor-associated Ag cross-reacting with 47-LDA. Glycan microarray and immunoblotting studies using 14G2a mAb demonstrated that this Ab is highly specific for the entire carbohydrate motif of GD2 but also cross-reacts with a 105 kDa glycoprotein expressed by GD2(+) and GD2(-) neuroblastoma and melanoma cells. Functional studies of tumor cells grown in three-dimensional collagen cultures with 14G2a mAb showed decreases in matrix metalloproteinase-2 activation, a process regulated by the 105 kDa-activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM/CD166). A recombinant CD166 glycoprotein was shown to be recognized by 14G2a Ab and inhibition of CD166 expression by RNA interference ablated the cell sensitivity to lysis by 47-LDA-induced CD8(+) T cells in vitro and in vivo. The binding of 14G2a to CD166 was not disruptable by a variety of exo- and endo-glycosidases, implying recognition of a non-glycan epitope on CD166. These results suggest that the vaccine-induced CTLs recognize a 47-LDA cross-reactive epitope expressed by CD166, and reveal a novel mechanism of induction of potent tumor-specific cellular responses by mimotopes of tumor-associated carbohydrate Ags.",

Also PP2A downregulation was proposed to take part in carcinogenesis. Recently, PP2A activation was shown to be activated in response to DNA damage. To obtain further information on the role of PP2A in tumors and response to DNA damage, we investigated the relationship between PP2A methylation and activity, cell proliferation, Akt activation, c-Myc expression and PTEN activity in B16 melanoma cells untreated and after chloroethylnitrosourea (CENU) treatment. In untreated cells, okadaic acid, an antagonist of PP2A methylation, inhibited PP2A activity, stimulated cell proliferation, increased Akt activation and c-Myc expression. Xylulose-5-phosphate, an agonist of PP2A methylation, increased PP2A activity, decreased cell proliferation, Akt activation and c-Myc expression. However, both PP2A methylation modulators increased PTEN activity. During the response to CENU treatment, PP2A methylation and activity were strongly increased, Akt activation and c-Myc expression were decreased. However PTEN activity was increased. After tumor cell growth recovery, these modifications were moderately decreased. PP2A methylation was quantified and correlated positively with PP2A activity, and negatively with criteria for cell aggressiveness (cell proliferation, Akt activation, c-Myc expression). Based on these data, PP2A methylation status controls PP2A activity and oncoproteins expression and PP2A is strongly activated after CENU treatment thus partly explaining the growth inhibition in response to this agent. It follows that PP2A promethylating agents are potential candidates for anticancer drugs.",

The protocol involves intratumoral injections of replication-incompetent adenoviral vectors encoding immunoconjugates composed of the Fc region of an IgG1 immunoglobulin conjugated to a tumor-targeting domain. One targeting domain is factor VII that binds to tissue factor expressed on endothelial cells lining the tumor neovasculature and on tumor cells; the active site of factor VII was mutated to inhibit the initiation of blood coagulation. Another targeting domain is a single-chain Fv antibody that binds to a cognate antigen expressed on human melanoma cells. The adenoviral vectors infect mainly the cells of the injected tumor, which synthesize and secrete the immunoconjugates. The bloodborne immunoconjugates induce a cytolytic immune response against the targeted neovasculature endothelial cells and tumor cells. The mouse model experiments showed that intratumoral delivery of the factor VII immunoconjugate, either alone or together with the single-chain Fv immunoconjugate, resulted in growth inhibition and regression of the injected tumor, and also of distant metastatic tumors, without evidence of damage to normal organs. There was extensive destruction of the tumor neovasculature, presumably mediated by the factor VII immunoconjugate bound to tissue factor on neovasculature endothelial cells. Because tissue factor is generally expressed on neovascular endothelial cells and tumor cells, a factor VII immunoconjugate could be used for immunotherapy against a broad range of human solid tumors.",

One of the well-known diagnostic pitfalls in melanoma sentinel lymph node evaluation is the presence of nodal melanocytic nevi, which has been demonstrated in up to 26% of lymphadenectomy specimens and specifically in melanoma patients. Melanocytic markers enhance the sensitivity of melanoma detection in sentinel lymph nodes. However, established markers such as anti-melan-A/MART1, S100 protein and SOX10 antibodies cannot discriminate melanoma metastasis from nodal nevi. Recent studies have demonstrated strong expression of neural stem/progenitor cell markers nestin and SOX2 in melanoma. In this study, we tested the diagnostic utility of nestin and SOX2 in differentiating metastatic melanomas from nodal nevi. Twenty-three lymph nodes with metastatic melanomas and 17 with nodal nevi were examined. Of the 23 metastatic melanomas, 18 showed diffuse and strong (3+) nestin, 4 showed rare cells with strong (3+) nestin, and one showed diffuse but faint (1+) nestin staining. Nuclear SOX2 was positive in 13 metastatic melanomas. In contrast, 15 nodal nevi showed no nestin, and 2 showed rare cells with very faint (<1+) nestin staining. SOX2 was negative in 13 nodal nevi. Overall, nestin was strongly expressed in metastatic melanomas (n=22/23; 96%), but not in nodal melanocytic nevi (n=15/17; 88%; P<0.0001). SOX2 was also expressed in metastatic melanomas (n=13/23; 57%) but not in the majority of nodal melanocytic nevi (n=13/16; 81%; P=0.02). In one lymph node harboring metastatic melan-A-negative desmoplastic melanoma, nestin and SOX2 strongly highlighted the infiltrating tumor cells, suggesting the potential clinical value of these two markers in desmoplastic melanoma lymph node biopsies. This study provides evidence that nestin and SOX2 can effectively differentiate nodal melanocytic nevi from metastatic melanomas and serve as powerful diagnostic adjuncts in melanoma staging.",

Paclitaxel+AS101 directly inhibited the clonogenicity of B16 melanoma cells in a synergistic, dose-dependent manner. We suggest that this results from both reduced paclitaxel-induced bone marrow toxicity and induction of differential signal-transduction pathways, which lead to apoptosis of tumor cells. Paclitaxel+AS101 synergistically activated c-raf-1 and MAPK ERK1 and ERK2. This activation was essential for the synergistic induction of p21(waf) protein. Cell-cycle analysis of B16 cells treated with both compounds revealed an increased accumulation in G(2)M, though AS101 alone produced significant G(1) arrest. These activities were ras-dependent. AS101+paclitaxel induced significant synergistic phosphorylation (inactivation) of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Whereas phosphorylation of Bcl-2 by paclitaxel was raf-dependent only, the synergistic effect of both compounds together was ras-, raf- and MAPK-dependent. No effect of the combined treatment on Bax protein expression was observed. We suggest that AS101 renders more cells susceptible to Bcl-2 phosphorylation by paclitaxel, possibly by increasing the accumulation of paclitaxel-induced cells in G(2)M. Exposure of B16 cells to clinically achievable concentrations of paclitaxel+AS101 increased the rate of apoptosis of treated cells. Apoptosis induced by AS101 alone was both raf- and MAPK-dependent, while that induced by paclitaxel was raf-dependent only.",

We have examined CD8+ T-cell immunity to MAs and a viral antigen (influenza) in uncultured T cells of healthy donors and melanoma patients using autologous, mature, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with peptide antigens and viral vectors. Antigen-specific IFN-gamma-producing T cells reactive with HLA-A*0201-restricted peptides from four melanoma antigens (MelanA/MART-1, MAGE-3, tyrosinase, and gp100) were detected only at low frequencies (<30 per 2 x 10(5) peripheral blood mononuclear cells for each of the MAs) from HLA-A2.1-positive healthy donors (n = 12) and patients with stages III/IV melanoma (n = 8). Detection of MA-specific, but not influenza matrix peptide (Flu-MP)-specific, T cells required a high concentration (10 microg/ml) of the peptide in this assay. Furthermore, these T cells did not recognize endogenously processed antigen on tumor cell lines or cells infected with viral vectors capable of expressing MAs. The use of autologous, mature DCs led to a significant increase in the number of Flu-MP, but not MA-specific, T cells in 16-h ELISPOT assays for both melanoma patients and healthy donors. In 1-week cocultures with DCs pulsed with 10 microg/ml peptide, MelanA/MART-1-specific T cells did not readily proliferate or differentiate into lytic effectors, in contrast to strong influenza-specific lytic responses. Therefore, despite distinct memory responses to influenza antigens, melanoma patients and healthy controls have a paucity of MA-reactive memory T cells, failing to rapidly generate IFN-gamma-secreting lytic effectors in short-term assays, even when stimulated by DCs.",

DNA repair pathways are multiple and are able to repair, usually in an error-free manner, all kinds of DNA damage induced by exogenous and endogenous genotoxic agents. This review describes the role of DNA repair process in protecting us from cancer and particularly nucleotide excision deficiencies that are associated with melanoma development. Resistance of tumoral cells to antitumoral regimen can be caused by overexpression of DNA repair processes. We showed that melanoma metastasis was associated with higher expression of some DNA repair pathways leading to a better surveillance of replication fork fidelity. We showed a partially coordinated regulation of these repair genes. P53 and several transcription factors may regulate numerous of these repair genes. The repair pathways that are overexpressed in metastatic melanoma are those particularly efficient in repairing the major DNA damage produced by cytotoxic treatments. This implies that better analysis of DNA repair regulation is necessary to identify novel therapeutic targets and to allow clinicians to propose tailored therapies.",

We have previously shown that RhoA GTPase and its effector ROCK negatively control FasL membrane expression in murine melanoma B16F10 cells. In this study, we found that B16F10 treatment with the ROCK inhibitor H1152 reduced melanoma development in vivo through FasL membrane overexpression. Although H1152 treatment did not reduce tumor growth in vitro, pretreatment of tumor cells with this inhibitor delayed tumor appearance, and slowed tumor growth in C57BL/6 immunocompetent mice. Thanks to the use of mice-bearing mutated Fas receptors (B6/lpr), we found that reduced tumor growth, observed in immunocompetent mice, was linked to FasL overexpression induced by H1152 treatment. Tumor growth analysis in immunosuppressed NUDE and IFN-γ-KO mice highlighted major roles for T lymphocytes and IFN-γ in the H1152-induced tumor growth reduction. Histological analyses of subcutaneous tumors, obtained from untreated versus H1152-treated B16F10 cells, showed that H1152 pretreatment induced a strong intratumoral infiltration of leukocytes. Cytofluorometric analysis showed that among these leukocytes, the number of activated CD8 lymphocytes was increased. Moreover, their antibody-induced depletion highlighted their main responsibility in tumor growth reduction. Subcutaneous tumor growth was also reduced by repeated intravenous injections of a clinical ROCK inhibitor, Fasudil. Finally, H1152-induced ROCK inhibition also reduced pulmonary metastasis implantation independently of T cell-mediated immune response. Altogether, our data suggest that ROCK inhibitors could become interesting pharmacological molecules for melanoma immunotherapy. ",

In this study, we examined whether the expression of the target gene in tumor cells can be suppressed by the delivery of RNAi effectors to primary and metastatic tumor cells. To quantitatively evaluate the RNAi effects in tumor cells, mouse melanoma B16-BL6 cells were stably transfected with both firefly (a model target gene) and sea pansy (an internal standard gene) luciferase genes to obtain B16-BL6/dual Luc cells. The target gene expression in subcutaneous primary tumors of B16-BL6/dual Luc cells was significantly suppressed by direct injection of the RNAi effectors followed by electroporation. The expression in metastatic hepatic tumors was also significantly reduced by an intravenous injection of either RNAi effector by the hydrodynamics-based procedure.

We describe the chemoenzymatic synthesis of two G(M3)-derived reagents and their use in the panning of a phage-displayed human single-chain Fv (scFv) antibody library derived from the blood of cancer patients. Three scFv-phage clones, GM3A6, GM3A8, and GM3A15, were selected for recombinant expression and were characterized using BIAcore and flow cytometry. BIAcore measurements using the purified, soluble scFvs yielded dissociation constants (K(d)) ranging from 4.2 x 10(-7) to 2.1 x 10(-5) M. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate the ability of each scFv to discriminate between normal human cells (human dermal fibroblast, HDFa), melanoma cells (HMV-1, M21, and C-8161), and breast cancer cells (BCM-1, BCM-2, and BMS). GM3A6 displayed cross-reactivity with normal cells, as well as tumor cells, and GM3A15 possessed little or no binding activity toward any of the cell lines tested. However, GM3A8 bound to five of the six tumor cell lines and showed no measurable reactivity against the HDFa cells. Hence, we have demonstrated that a synthetic G(M3) panning reagent can be used to isolate a fully human scFv that is highly specific for native G(M3) on the surface of tumor cells. The result is a significant step toward effective immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer.",

In this study, the tumor recognition ability of a natural killer cell-activating receptor, DNAM-1 was harnessed to design CARs that target multiple tumor types. DNAM-1 ligands, PVR and nectin-2, are expressed on primary human leukemia, myeloma, ovarian cancer, melanoma, neuroblastoma, and Ewing sarcoma. DNAM-1 CARs exhibit high tumor cell cytotoxicity but low IFN-γ secretion in vitro. In contrast to other CAR designs, co-stimulatory domains did not improve the expression and function of DNAM-1 CARs. A DNAM-1/CD3zeta CAR reduced tumor burden in a murine melanoma model in vivo. In conclusion, DNAM-1-based CARs may have the potential to treat PVR and nectin-2 expressing hematological and solid tumors.",

These genes in turn are involved in a plethora of biochemical as well as cell biological processes, including glucose metabolism, apoptosis and angiogenesis. In melanoma, HIF-1alpha has been implicated in tumor progression with effects upon metastasis and angiogenesis. However, its role in malignant transformation by oncogenes has not been described. Bedogni et al. (Cancer Cell 2005, 8:443-54) report that the hypoxic microenvironment in the skin contributes to melanocyte transformation and tumor growth induced by oncogenes Ras and Akt, which are frequently activated in melanoma. HIF-1alpha activity was found to be required in Akt-induced melanocyte transformation and tumor growth and it was suppressed greatly by mTOR inhibition with rapamycin. Since mTOR regulates HIF-1alpha expression and its transcriptional activity, rapamycin was proposed as a promising hypoxia-related therapeutic approach in melanoma treatment. This study sheds light upon the role of HIF-1alpha in the early stage of melanoma development and highlights the importance of the Akt-mTOR pathway in the regulation of HIF-1alpha.",

These studies are feasible and readily conducted on frozen tissue as is routinely done in typing of lymphoma. The demonstration of heterogeneity using this monoclonal antibody panel, and other antibodies yet to come, may be important for prognostication. Tumor cell heterogeneity of surface antigens reflects disruption of the tumor cell's patterned gene expression. This should be regarded as an indication of different clones of cells (subsets) with a tumor, whether primary or secondary. It is entirely possible that autologous immune cells can kill or at least restrict the growth of subsets of melanoma cells having certain surface antigenic phenotypes while they are incompetent to handle other subsets. This would enable a particular phenotype within a primary melanoma to survive and escape the immunologic regression known to occur in 3 to 6 percent of these tumors. Such patients may present years later with metastases in the brain, liver, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, or lymph nodes. There are also implications in chemotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy for melanoma in this regard. It could be theorized that these agents may dispose of or restrict the growth of some phenotypes, leaving others in a resistant state. Perhaps the MDR gene is activated. Alternatively a tumor suppressor gene(s) could be absent or inactivated, as in neuroblastoma and carcinoma of the breast and lung. Markers present at the cell membrane surfaces and in the membranes themselves constitute an important field for study in the understanding of tumorigenesis. Many of these markers are present in embryos as early as the 4-to-8-cell stage and in blastocysts. Embryonic antigens in the intercell mass of blastocysts are stage-specific embryonic antigens. They are signals for organ development and the differentiation of cells. At various stages of this development, these markers disappear, especially upon differentiation into tissue types and specific organs. These cell signals are therefore organogenesis markers. Detecting a given antigen is not simple because it may be present but not immunohistochemically detectable because glycosylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, or sulfation have not taken place, or have resulted in a structural conformation not recognized by monoclonal antibodies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Here, we utilized a syngeneic subcutaneous murine model of B16F10 melanoma to explore the role of NLRC4 in tumor suppression. We found that NLRC4-deficient mice exhibited enhanced tumor growth that was independent of the inflammasome components ASC and caspase-1. Nlrc4 expression was critical for cytokine and chemokine production in tumor-associated macrophages and was necessary for the generation of protective IFN-γ-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Tumor progression was diminished when WT or caspase-1-deficient, but not NLRC4-deficient, macrophages were coinjected with B16F10 tumor cells in NLRC4-deficient mice. Finally, examination of human primary melanomas revealed the extensive presence of NLRC4+ tumor-associated macrophages. In contrast, there was a paucity of NLRC4+ tumor-associated macrophages observed in human metastatic melanoma, supporting the concept that NLRC4 expression controls tumor growth.

Strong expression of KIT (>90%) in tumor cells was present in 55% of primary UM and in 76% of UM metastases. This overexpression of both KIT and SCF suggests the clinical application of imatinib mesylate in metastatic UM. This notion was tested in a clinical study using Simon's two-stage design. Patients received imatinib (600 mg p.o. daily) until progress or unacceptable toxicities. The trial did not enter stage II as no objective response was observed in the first group.

Furthermore, since most of the TAA used for active specific immunotherapy are self-antigens, a challenge facing tumor immunologists is to develop strategies which are effective in breaking tolerance to self-antigens.

In the present study, the contribution of these endothelium-specific ligand/receptor systems to tumor angiogenesis was evaluated. A375v human melanoma cells, which express at least the angiogenic growth factors VEGF, VEGF-C, and Ang-1, were stably transfected to overexpress the extracellular ligand-binding domains of the endothelium-specific receptor tyrosine kinases fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (Flt-1), Flt-4, Tie-1, and Tie-2, respectively.

Strikingly, T cells genetically modified with CD8-LV killed melanoma cells reproducibly more efficiently than CD8(+) cells transduced with a conventional lentiviral vector.

Instead, CD8-LV transduced cells showed increased granzyme B and perforin levels as well as an up-regulation of CD8 surface expression in a small subpopulation of cells.

The results showed that i) the expression levels of MAGE-A1, -A3 and -A11 proteins in the glioma tissues were 64.1, 51.3 and 57.7%, respectively and that no MAGE-A1, -A3 or -A11 expression was detected in the normal brain specimens; ii) the expression levels of MAGE-A1 and -A11 increased with ascending pathological grades and were positively correlated with the ki-67 labeling index; and iii) the OS of the patients in the groups with high MAGE-A1 (P=0.005) and -A11 (P=0.019) expression was statistically lower compared with the groups with low expression and no significant differences in OS were detected between the patients in the groups with high and low MAGE-A3 expression (P=0.304). Based on these results, we conclude that MAGE-A1, -A3 and -A11 may be used as ideal targets for glioma immunotherapy, and that MAGE-A1 and -A11 expression may be involved in tumor cell proliferation. These proteins may be potential indicators of a poor prognosis in glioma patients.",

They show a divergent expression pattern in certain adult tissues with a prominent localization of nidogen 2 in blood vessel BMs. Deletion of either nidogen 1 or 2 in mice had no effect on BM formation, suggesting complementary functions. However, studies in these mice revealed isoform-specific functions with nidogen 1-deficient mice showing neurological abnormalities and wound-healing defects not seen in the absence of nidogen 2. To investigate this further nidogen 1- or 2-deficient mice were intravenously injected with B16 murine melanoma cells, and lung metastasis was analyzed. The authors could show that loss of nidogen 2, but not of nidogen 1, significantly promotes lung metastasis of melanoma cells. Histological and ultrastructural analysis of nidogen 1- and 2-deficient lungs did not reveal differences in morphology and ultrastructure of BMs, including vessel BMs. Furthermore, deposition and distribution of the major BM components were indistinguishable between the two mouse strains. Taken together, these results suggest that absence of nidogen 2 might result in subtle changes of endothelial BMs in the lung, which would allow faster passage of tumor cells through these BMs, leading to a higher metastasis rate and more larger tumors.",

In vitro cytotoxicity of doxorubicin encapsulated in liposomes was enhanced by antibody coupling, but still behind free doxorubicin. However, in vivo antitumor therapeutic efficacy of doxorubicin encapsulated in the immunoliposomes was far greater than the free drug or in conventional liposomes. Doxorubicin encapsulated in anti-G(M3) immunoliposomes was able to reduce in vivo tumor growth and metastasis of B16BL6 mouse melanoma cells more greatly than any other formulations of the drug.

Western blot, immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR were performed to analyze protein and mRNA expression. The effect of electroporation on muscles was determined by histology, while tumor apoptosis and the proliferation index were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides tumor accumulation was measured by FACS and confocal microscopy.;The G3139/Electroporation combined therapy produced a significant inhibition of tumor growth (TWI, more than 50%) accompanied by a marked tumor re-growth delay (TRD, about 20 days). The efficacy of this treatment was due to the higher G3139 uptake in tumor cells which led to a marked down-regulation of bcl-2 protein expression. Moreover, the G3139/EP combination treatment resulted in an enhanced apoptotic index and a decreased proliferation rate of tumors. Finally, an increased tumor response was observed after treatment with the triple combination G3139/DDP/EP, showing a TWI of about 75% and TRD of 30 days.;These results demonstrate that electroporation is an effective strategy to improve the delivery of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides within tumor cells in vivo and it may be instrumental in optimizing the response of melanoma to chemotherapy. The high response rate observed in this study suggest to apply this strategy for the treatment of melanoma patients.",

Response was assessed after each 8-week treatment cycle. Patients received up to 12 cycles until disease progression or a complete response occurred.;A total of 296 patients received treatment through February 24, 2012. Grade 3 or 4 drug-related adverse events occurred in 14% of patients; there were three deaths from pulmonary toxicity. No maximum tolerated dose was defined. Adverse events consistent with immune-related causes were observed. Among 236 patients in whom response could be evaluated, objective responses (complete or partial responses) were observed in those with non-small-cell lung cancer, melanoma, or renal-cell cancer. Cumulative response rates (all doses) were 18% among patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (14 of 76 patients), 28% among patients with melanoma (26 of 94 patients), and 27% among patients with renal-cell cancer (9 of 33 patients). Responses were durable; 20 of 31 responses lasted 1 year or more in patients with 1 year or more of follow-up. To assess the role of intratumoral PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) expression in the modulation of the PD-1-PD-L1 pathway, immunohistochemical analysis was performed on pretreatment tumor specimens obtained from 42 patients. Of 17 patients with PD-L1-negative tumors, none had an objective response; 9 of 25 patients (36%) with PD-L1-positive tumors had an objective response (P=0.006).;Anti-PD-1 antibody produced objective responses in approximately one in four to one in five patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, melanoma, or renal-cell cancer; the adverse-event profile does not appear to preclude its use.

In this study, we investigated the plasma levels of MMP-2 and TGF-beta and their correlation in 49 primary cutaneous melanoma and 10 metastatic melanoma. Plasma MMP-2 and TGF-beta levels in patients with primary melanoma were significantly higher than those of healthy controls. These protein levels were significantly higher in patients with metastatic melanoma. A positive correlation between plasma levels of MMP-2 and TGF-beta in melanoma patients supports the hypothesis that TGF-beta triggers the release of MMP-2. The immunohistochemistry analysis shows that MMP-2 and TGF-beta were highly expressed in tumor tissues as well as in matched plasma samples. This finding suggests that these proteins are released from tumor cells. Overall, our data indicate that MMP-2 and TGF-beta may represent novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets in melanoma and the determination of their concentration could be a useful diagnostic and prognostic indicator. TGF-beta, leading the tissue invasion mediated by MMP-2, is a strong promoter of tumor progression.

The successful surface expression of CD80 was obtained in both cultured tumor cell lines and primary cultured tumor cells. Transduction of CD80 alone was not sufficient to induce cytotoxicity of peripheral blood lymphocytes against allogeneic tumor cell lines except for melanoma cells. We, therefore, investigated a combined effect of CD80-Ad-infected tumor cells and interleukin 12 (IL-12). Although 7-day cultivation of autologous or allogeneic lymphocytes with CD80-Ad-infected tumor cells and IL-12 slightly enhanced cytotoxicity against some allogeneic tumor cells, no substantial cytotoxicity was observed against autologous tumor cells. When we extended the culture period to 14 days in the presence of IL-2, a prominent enhancement of cytotoxicity was observed against both allogeneic and autologous tumor cells. Cytotoxicity against autologous tumor cells, but not against allogeneic tumor cells, was efficiently inhibited by anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody. Furthermore, the selective cytotoxicity against a panel of targets indicated that the induced CTLs recognize specific antigens on autologous tumor cells. These results suggest that stimulation with a combination of IL-12- and CD80-modified tumor cells and subsequent expansion with IL-2 may efficiently generate tumor-specific CTLs from autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes.

Trophic factors such as the neurotrophins play an important role in tumor cell invasion into the CNS and in the survival of small numbers of malignant cells under stress conditions. Trophic factors promote BBB invasion by enhancing the production of basement membrane-degrading enzymes in neurotrophin-responsive cells. The expression of certain neurotrophin receptors on brain-metastasic neuroendocrine cells occurs in relation to their invasive and survival properties. For example, CNS-metastatic melanoma cells respond to particular neurotrophins (nerve growth factor, neurotrophin-2) that can be secreted by normal cells within the CNS. In addition, a paracrine form of transferrin is important in CNS metastasis, and brain-metastatic cells respond to low levels of transferrin and express high levels of transferrin receptors. CNS-metastatic tumor cells can also produce autocrine factors and inhibitors that influence their growth, invasion and survival in the brain. Synthesis of paracrine factors and cytokines may influence the production of trophic factors by normal brain cells adjacent to tumor cells. Moreover, we found increased amounts of neurotrophins in brain tissue at the invasion front of human melanoma tumors in CNS biopsies. Thus the ability to form metastatic colonies in the CNS is dependent on tumor cell responses to trophic factors as well as autocrine and paracrine growth factors and probably other underdescribed factors.",

In several studies, NF-κB activation was shown to be an adverse prognostic factor, and in melanoma it was proposed as an event that promotes tumor progression. This study aimed to evaluate whether NF-κB activation in tumor tissues, assessed by the expression of the NF-κB p65 subunit, has an effect on the survival of melanoma patients. The expression of NF-κB was immunohistochemically investigated, and the correlation with survival was analyzed. Furthermore, the immunostaining for p53 and survivin was evaluated, and the relationship of these apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors with NF-κB expression was analyzed. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with low levels of NF-κB in the nuclei of tumor cells had a significantly longer survival compared to those with high levels. Multivariate analysis confirmed the predictive value of nuclear NF-κB, showing that its expression maintains significance after the model was adjusted using clinicopathological factors. The results demonstrate the correlation of NF-κB p65 nuclear staining with the disease-specific 5-year survival of melanoma patients and suggest that nuclear NF-κB p65 may be promising as an early independent prognostic factor in patients with primary cutaneous melanoma.",

Serological screening of cDNA expression libraries, SEREX, has recently been shown to provide another route for defining immunogenic human tumor antigens. The detection of antibody responses against known CTL-defined tumor antigens, e.g., MAGE-1 and tyrosinase, raised the question whether antibody and CTL responses against a defined tumor antigen can occur simultaneously in a single patient. In this paper, we report on a melanoma patient with a high-titer antibody response against the \"cancer-testis\" antigen NY-ESO-1. Concurrently, a strong MHC class I-restricted CTL reactivity against the autologous NY-ESO-1-positive tumor cell line was found. A stable CTL line (NW38-IVS-1) was established from this patient that reacted with autologous melanoma cells and with allogeneic human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2(-), NY-ESO-1-positive, but not NY-ESO-1-negative, melanoma cells. Screening of NY-ESO-1 transfectants with NW38-IVS-1 revealed NY-ESO-1 as the relevant CTL target presented by HLA-A2. Computer calculation identified 26 peptides with HLA-A2-binding motifs encoded by NY-ESO-1. Of these, three peptides were efficiently recognized by NW38-IVS-1. Thus, we show that antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses against human tumor antigens may occur simultaneously. In addition, our analysis provides a general strategy for identifying the CTL-recognizing peptides of tumor antigens initially defined by autologous antibody.",

In this study, we used an animal model to further demonstrate MAGEs as a potential immunotherapy target for tumorigenesis in vivo.;In the current study, we developed a MAGE1/MAGE3/TBHSP70 recombinant protein vaccine and evaluated its protective efficacy against tumor development by challenge vaccine-immunized mice with MAGE-expressing human tumor cell lines in a Hu-PBL-SCID mouse model. The cellular immune reactions were monitored by ELISPOT and cytotoxicity assays.;Splenocytes isolated from vaccine-immunized mice presented potent cytokine secretion capacity and CTL-specific cytotoxic. Vaccine-immunized mice had a significant tumor regression and prolonged survival compared with controls (both p < 0.05). In vitro, rMAGE1-MAGE3-TBHSP70 showed a potent tumor-antigen-specific immune response in both hepatocellular carcinoma and pulmonary carcinoma cell lines.;This newly-developed recombinant protein vaccine may serve as a new immunotherapy for cancer.",

The labeled components were examined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Each tumor type had a distinctive pattern of labeled glycoproteins when the results from both procedures 1 and 2 were considered. Cell surface glycoproteins of malignant melanoma could not be labeled by procedure 2, whereas the other cell lines had at least two major glycoproteins that could be labeled by this method. Very similar profiles of melanoma glycoproteins were labeled by procedures 1 and 3. From these results the conclusion was reached that cell surface glycoproteins of melanomas are substituted with sialic acid so that their D-galactose and/or N-acetyl-D-galactosamine residues are available for oxidation by galactose oxidase only after neuraminidase treatment. An alternative explanation that these sugars are sterically accessible to galactose oxidase only after neuraminidase treatment also has to be considered. All melanoma lines studied were characterized by having two major cell surface glycoproteins with molecular weights of 110,000 and 90,000, respectively. Lines, however, varied considerably in their expression of other components. In particular, heterogeneity was shown in the expression of gp220, a component identified as fibronectin by immunoprecipitation with a specific antiserum, and in the expression of gp37/32, a pair of glycoproteins having the characteristics of la-like antigens. Of the other cell lines studied, astrocytomas most closely resembled melanoma in their glycoprotein profiles. The brain tumors, however, had two or three glycoproteins, including gp110, which could be labeled by galactose oxidase-[3H]borohydride without neuraminidase treatment.",

Interlesional antigenic heterogeneity was present in 22/33 (67%) patients with disseminated metastases including at least one internal organ, but only in 4/26 (15%) patients whose metastases were restricted to skin and/or skin-draining lymph nodes (P less than or equal to 0.01). Chemotherapy cannot be the main reason for interlesional phenotypic heterogeneity, as seen by comparison of treated and untreated patients. Aneuploid melanoma metastases, as an indication for instability on the chromosomal level, were found in the majority of patients (84%) regardless of their clinical situation.

Despite such clinical efficacy, the optimal means of DC priming is unknown. The goal of this study was to compare three methods of tumor preparation: irradiation, boiling, or freeze thaw lysis for DC priming. Mouse bone marrow-derived DCs were loaded with defined ratios of E.G7 tumor cells expressing a model tumor antigen, OVA. Sensitized DCs were used for stimulation of OVA-specific CTLs derived from OT-1 T-cell receptor transgenic mice. IFN-gamma release, determined by ELISA at 24 and 48 h, was used to assess the expression of antigens by DCs. DCs loaded with irradiated tumors were effective stimulators for OT-1 CTLs, whereas DCs stimulated with freeze-thawed or boiled tumors did not stimulate IFN-gamma production. Freeze-thaw lysis appeared to inhibit CTL activity in vitro and in two of three cases, this effect was not overcome by the addition of OVA. The ability to load irradiated tumor cells was reproduced in two analogous human melanoma models using melanoma cell lines expressing gp100 and CTL clones specific for a gp100 melanoma antigen. Consistent with the in vitro data, only DC/irradiated tumor vaccines were effective in preventing or delaying outgrowth of E.G7 and a poorly immunogenic murine squamous cell carcinoma (SCCVII), on local tumor challenge. These data demonstrate that the method of tumor cell preparation clearly influences the ability of DCs to present antigen to T cells. Correlation of in vitro data with the generation of protective immunity in vivo suggests the utility of irradiated tumor-primed DCs as a means to generate protective immunity in patients with solid malignancies.",

Integrin-ECM ligand interaction leads to phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. It has been reported that integrins also regulate expression and function of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In this present work, we cultured human A375 melanoma cells in the presence of fibronectin to study fibronectin-integrin mediated modulation of MMP activity.;A375 cells were cultured in serum-free culture medium (SFCM) in the presence of fibronectin (25 microg/0.75 ml), SFCM was collected and gelatin zymography was performed. Western blot and RT-PCR were performed with A375 cells cultured in the presence of fibronectin.;Culture of A375 cells in the presence of fibronectin led to expression of MMP-9 and activation of MMP-2 within 2 h. When cells were treated with ERK inhibitor (PD98059) or PI-3K inhibitor (LY294002) and grown in the presence of fibronectin, MMP-9 expression and MMP-2 activation was inhibited. Tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and ERK were increased in A375 cells grown in the presence of fibronectin. Increased MMP-9 mRNA expression and processing of MT1-MMP were also observed in A375 cells grown in the presence of fibronectin.;Our findings indicate culture of A375 cells in SFCM in the presence of fibronectin perhaps generates a signaling cascade that leads to expression of MMP-9 and activation of MMP-2 in culture supernatants within 2 h.

The present study was undertaken to investigate the possible relationship between cell surface receptors for two such growth factors: the c-Met proto-oncogene, which constitutes the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF), and the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R). Their role as a prognostic factor was also clarified.;Paraffin-embedded tumor specimens from 132 patients with primary uveal melanoma were analyzed by using well-established specific antibodies against c-Met and IGF-1R. The intercorrelation of receptor expression and association with melanoma-related survival of patients were determined by univariate and multivariate analyses.;Whereas the expression of both IGF-1R and c-Met was significantly associated with melanoma-specific mortality by univariate analysis (p = 0.004 and p = 0.007, respectively) only IGF-1R showed independent prognostic value by multivariate analysis, p = 0.004. The prognostic value of IGF-1R was stronger than such currently used prognostic parameters as tumor cell type and tumor diameter (p = 0.021 and p = 0.026, respectively). The expression patterns of the two growth factors receptors were weakly intercorrelated.;In conclusion, the data suggest that the receptors for IGF-1 and HGF/SF may play a role in the spread of uveal melanoma and its affinity to the liver. The strong correlation between IGF-1R expression and melanoma-specific mortality points to the use of IGF-1R as a prognostic tool [Economou MA, All-Ericsson C, Bykov V, Girnita L, Bartolazzi A, Larsson O & Seregard S (2005): Receptors for the liver synthesized growth factors IGF-1 and HGF/SF in uveal melanoma: intercorrelation and prognostic implications.",

Both the lymphoid tumor line MDAY-D2 and B16F10 melanoma cells were less metastatic when grown in swainsonine (0.3 micrograms/ml) for 48 h prior to injection of the cells into the lateral tail veins of mice. The addition of swainsonine (2.5 micrograms/ml) to the drinking water of the mice further reduced the incidence of lung colonization by B16F10 melanoma cells.

In particular, recent studies point toward a disease-progressing role of proangiogenic M2 macrophages in melanomas with monosomy 3. Although most studies implicate a protective effect of PPAR-gamma activation in tumors, PPAR-gamma has also been shown to promote the polarization of M1 macrophages toward the M2 phenotype. The purpose of this investigation was first, to characterize the phenotype of tumor infiltrating macrophages and second, to study PPAR-gamma expression in uveal melanomas with molecular gene expression profile as prognostic predictors for patients' outcome. Twenty specimens from patients with uveal melanoma were analyzed for clinical and histologic tumor characteristics. The molecular RNA profile (class 1 or class 2) was commercially determined. Using immunohistochemical techniques, the specimens were dual labeled for CD68 and CD163. CD68 + CD163- M1 macrophages and CD68 + CD163+ M2 macrophages were analyzed in ten high power fields sparing macrophage-poor areas and a mean value was calculated for each tumor. The tumors were immunostained for von Willebrand factor and the micro vascular density (MVD) was analyzed according to Foss. To assess the proliferative rate of each tumor, Ki67 expression was evaluated in ten high power fields followed by calculation of a mean value. Expression of PPAR-gamma was evaluated using a score from 0 (no staining) to 3 (tumor entirely stained). Statistical analysis and a respective correlation were made between histologic characteristics, molecular profile, type of tumor infiltrating macrophages (M1 vs. M2), MVD, proliferative rate, and PPAR-gamma expression. Our results showed a correlation between the ratio of M2/M1 macrophages and the molecular profile with a ratio of approximately 1 corresponding to molecular class 1 and a ratio of approximately 2 corresponding to molecular class 2 (p = 0.01). The ratio of M2/M1 macrophages was higher in tumors with extraocular extension (p = 0.01). PPAR-gamma was predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm of tumor cells. Its expression showed no association with the molecular RNA profile (p = 0.83). This study confirmed that the ratio of M2/M1 macrophages is another prognostic factor in uveal melanoma. Thus, polarization of macrophages plays an important role for patients' outcome.

Using a recently developed preclinical model of spontaneous melanoma CNS metastasis, we have identified alterations in expression of endothelin receptor B (EDNRB) as a potential factor that influences brain metastatic potential. Induced overexpression of this gene mediated enhanced overall metastatic disease, and resulted in an increased incidence of spontaneous CNS metastases. In contrast, the overexpression of other highlighted genes, such as BCL2A1, did not affect the incidence of CNS metastases but nevertheless appears to facilitate intracranial tumor growth. The prometastatic effect in the CNS associated with EDNRB appears to be mediated by the interaction with its ligands resulting in enhanced tumor cell proliferation and thus intracranial melanoma growth. That EDNRB contributes to melanoma metastasis is underscored by the fact that its therapeutic inhibition by the EDNRB-specific inhibitor A192621 translated into improved outcomes when treating mice with either visceral metastases or intracranial tumors. The identification of an influential role of EDNRB in CNS melanoma spontaneous metastasis may provide both a target for therapeutic intervention as well as a potential prognostic marker for patients having an increased predisposition for incidence of CNS melanoma metastases.",

Class I HLA and beta 2-microglobulins were not detected on the majority of nevus cells but were expressed by 3 of 5 dysplastic nevi, by the majority of tumor cells in 12 of 14 primary cutaneous melanomas, and in 13 of 24 metastases. The different expression of Class I HLA and beta 2-microglobulins in primary and metastatic lesions suggests that loss of these antigens may be associated with progression of malignancy. Class II HLA were not detected in common nevi but were locally present in 1 of 5 dysplastic nevi, 7 of 14 cases of primary cutaneous melanoma, and all 24 cases of metastatic lesions tested. These findings suggest that increase in Class II HLA expression may be associated with progression of malignancy. The staining patterns obtained with monoclonal antibodies to distinct determinants of Class I HLA and Class II HLA were superimposable within each type of antigen. Therefore, the discrepancies in the literature about the expression of histocompatibility antigens by lesions of melanocytic origin are not likely to reflect the different specificity of the antibodies used by the various investigators.",

These tumors fully mirrored the heterogeneity of the parental melanoma and could be passaged more than 5 times. In contrast, in more immunocompromised NOD/SCID/IL2rγ(null) mice, or in natural killer cell-depleted nude or NOD/SCID mice, both CD271-positive and CD271-negative tumor cell fractions established tumors. However, tumors resulting from either fraction did not phenocopy the parental tumors, and tumors derived from the CD271-negative cell fraction could not be passaged multiple times. Together, our findings identify CD271-positive cells as melanoma stem cells.

The diagnosis of skin tumors by invasive techniques has become a risk to the patients, so the search for new non-invasive techniques has been the subject of research in recent years. The objective of this work is to propose a non-invasive method prognosis based on the identification of specific biomarkers of the cancer, known as metabolomics analysis. For this study, we used B16F10 melanoma tumor cells and metabolic profiles were obtained at three time-periods by (1)HNMR and comparison with the cell cycle, apoptosis pathways and proliferation index. The metabolic profiles show the relationship between the metabolites found with energy metabolism, pathways of apoptosis and proliferation, which showed increases in proportion during growth and progression. Were found 29 metabolites, of which the differentially expressed are: lactate, aspartate, glycerol, lipids, alanine, myo-inositol, phosphocholine, choline, acetate, creatine and taurine. Choline and creatine are closely related with tumor progression, and are inversely expressed in later stages of tumor growth, which demonstrates the ability to be markers of tumor progression or monitoring the pharmacological efficacy when combined with other therapies. We conclude that the metabolome appeared as effective non-invasive technique predicts, besides providing possible biomarkers of melanoma.",

We generated recombinant fusion proteins containing the TAT protein transduction domain and either wild-type Survivin (TAT-Surv-WT) or a dominant-negative mutant (TAT-Surv-T34A). The TAT-Surv proteins were purified by sequential affinity and ion-exchange chromatography, and at 30 nM concentration demonstrated rapid entry into cells at 30 min. Whereas TAT-Surv-WT had minimal effect on YUSAC2 or WM793 melanoma cells, TAT-Surv-T34A induced cell detachment, DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 activation and mitochondrial release of apoptosis-inducing factor at low microM concentrations. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of mice bearing subcutaneous YUSAC2 xenografts with TAT-Surv-T34A (10 mg/kg) was associated with rapid tumor accumulation at 1 h, and increased tumor cell apoptosis and aberrant nuclei formation in situ. Repeated i.p. injection of TAT-Surv-T34A resulted in a 40-50% reduction in growth and mass of established tumors, compared to those similarly injected with saline buffer or TAT-Surv-WT.

The activation was exceedingly prompt, affected the great majority of Met in the cells, persisted so long as the cells remained adherent, and was rapidly reversed as soon as the cells were detached from substrata. Activation of Met required that cells be adherent but not that they spread on the substratum, and it occurred in the absence of any apparent ligand for the receptor. Ligand-independent activation of Met occurred in several varieties of tumor cells but not in normal endothelial cells that express the receptor.

Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) acts as a negative regulator of matrix metalloproteinases and thus prevents tumor cell invasion and metastasis by preserving extracellular matrix integrity. In the present study, we investigated whether increasing serum TIMP-1 levels by gene transfer would decrease experimental pulmonary metastasis of melanoma in C57BL/6 mice. Female animals bearing B16F10 melanoma pulmonary metastasis were injected intramuscularly twice per week with 100 microg of plasmid DNA encoding the human TIMP-1 cDNA (TIMP-1pDNA). Substantive levels of serum human TIMP-1 were observed 3 days after single injection and were found for 6 days thereafter. Pulmonary metastasis was significantly reduced in the mice following 4 weeks of TIMP-1 treatment as compared to the controls that were treated with the plasmid DNA vector alone. Further reduction of pulmonary metastasis and increase in survival were realized by intraperitoneal injection of 1000 U of IL-2 twice per week in combination with TIMP-1 treatment. In a parallel in vitro study, a 3-fold increase in TIMP-1 expression was observed in NIH3T3 cells after IL-2 treatment. Therefore, up-regulation of TIMP-1 expression by IL-2 likely contributed to the additive effect of IL-2 and TIMP-1 in reducing metastatic disease in the animal model. In conclusion, our findings support the potential of TIMP-1 gene therapy for the prevention of metastatic melanoma.",

How melanoma lesions escape from functional antigen-specific immune recognition remains poorly understood. We have identified the concomitant loss of the immunodominant T cell-defined MART-1/Melan-A antigen and downregulation of the TAP-1 gene in a recurrent metastatic melanoma that was resected in 1993. This phenotype was not observed for an earlier autologous melanoma lesion resected in 1987. The \"antigen loss\" could be restored in the variant tumor cell line by simultaneously providing both the MART-1/Melan-A gene (by retroviral transfer) and the TAP-1 gene (by a bioballistic approach) resulting in tumor cell sensitivity to MART-1/Melan-A-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. This suggests that tumor escape from immune surveillance may have occurred in vivo as a sequential result of (a) antigen loss, and (b) downregulation of the peptide-transporter protein TAP-1 expression by this patient's tumor over a 6-yr period from 1987 to 1993.

Adenoviral-mediated delivery of mda-7/IL-24 (Ad.mda-7) provokes apoptosis selectively in a wide spectrum of cancers in vitro in cell culture, in vivo in human tumor xenograft animal models and in patients with advanced carcinomas and melanomas. In human prostate cancer cells, a role for mitochondrial dysfunction and induction of reactive oxygen species in the apoptotic process has been established. Ectopic overexpression of bcl-xL and bcl-2 prevents these changes including apoptosis induction in prostate tumor cells by Ad.mda-7. We now document that this resistance to apoptosis can be reversed by treating bcl-2 family overexpressing prostate tumor cells with ionizing radiation in combination with Ad.mda-7 or purified GST-MDA-7 protein. Additionally, radiation augments apoptosis induction by mda-7/IL-24 in parental and neomycin-resistant prostate tumor cells. Radiosensitization to mda-7/IL-24 is dependent on JNK signaling, as treatment with the JNK 1/2/3 inhibitor SP600125 abolishes this effect. Considering that elevated expression of bcl-xL and bcl-2 are frequent events in prostate cancer development and progression, the present studies support the use of ionizing radiation in combination with mda-7/IL-24 as a means of augmenting the therapeutic benefit of this gene in prostate cancer, particularly in the context of tumors displaying resistance to radiation therapy owing to bcl-2 family member overexpression.",

We expressed the cDNA of the Fc portion of the murine IgG2a heavy chain on the surface of tumor cells such that its C terminus projected away from the tumor cell surface, mimicking a natural antibody-tagging event. In vitro, Fc receptor-positive natural killer (NK) cells specifically recognized and lysed B16 melanoma cells expressing surface IgFc. Macrophages bound to B16-Fc cells significantly more than to parental B16 cells and surface IgFc expression promoted formation of the terminal complement pore complex leading to cell lysis and death. Expression of IgFc dramatically delayed the ability of B16 cells to form tumors in vivo, attributable largely to the effects of NK cells. Furthermore, fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis showed that cells from outgrowth B16 IgFc tumors had lost all IgFc expression. When additional immunostimulatory signals were provided at the time of IgFc-mediated tumor cell killing through expression of heat shock protein 70 (hsp70), significant antitumor immunity was generated. Intratumoral delivery of an adenoviral vector expressing IgFc was effective at treating locally accessible tumors but did not impact metastatic disease. However, delivery of adenoviral vectors expressing both IgFc and hsp70 cured both local and metastatic tumors established for 6 days before viral treatment.

Their induction correlates with inhibition of cell growth while they are often repressed in the course of malignant transformation and tumor development.

Conversely, the antiproliferative responses of IFN-alpha in sensitive human melanoma cells are accompanied by 1-8U induction. Here we provide direct evidence that recombinant expression of 1-8U in human cell lines is sufficient to block cell proliferation.

Immune-(cell) therapy is a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of intractable cancers. The effectiveness of certain chemotherapeutics in inducing immunogenic tumor cell death thus promoting cancer eradication has been reported. Ginsenoside Rg3 is a ginseng saponin that has antitumor and immunomodulatory activity. In this study, we treated tumor cells with Rg3 to verify the significance of inducing immunogenic tumor cell death in antitumor therapy, especially in DC-based immunotherapy. Rg3 killed the both immunogenic (B16F10 melanoma cells) and non-immunogenic (LLC: Lewis Lung Carcinoma cells) tumor cells by inducing apoptosis. Surface expression of immunogenic death markers including calreticulin and heat shock proteins and the transcription of relevant genes were increased in the Rg3-dying tumor. Increased calreticulin expression was directly related to the uptake of dying tumor cells by dendritic cells (DCs): the proportion of CRT(+) CD11c(+) cells was increased in the Rg3-treated group. Interestingly, tumor cells dying by immunogenic cell death secreted IFN-γ, an effector molecule for antitumor activity in T cells. Along with the Rg3-induced suppression of pro-angiogenic (TNF-α) and immunosuppressive cytokine (TGF-β) secretion, IFN-γ production from the Rg3-treated tumor cells may also indicate Rg3 as an effective anticancer immunotherapeutic strategy. The data clearly suggests that Rg3-induced immunogenic tumor cell death due its cytotoxic effect and its ability to induce DC function.

We report here that Mmp1a is a functional MMP1 homologue that promotes invasion and metastatic progression of mouse lung cancer and melanoma. LLC1 (Lewis lung carcinoma) and primary mouse melanoma cells harboring active BRAF express high levels of endogenous Mmp1a, which is required for invasion through collagen. Silencing of either Mmp1a or PAR1 suppressed invasive stellate growth of lung cancer cells in three-dimensional matrices. Conversely, ectopic expression of Mmp1a conferred an invasive phenotype in epithelial cells that do not express endogenous Mmp1a. Consistent with Mmp1a acting as a PAR1 agonist in an autocrine loop, inhibition or silencing of PAR1 resulted in a loss of the Mmp1a-driven invasive phenotype. Knockdown of Mmp1a on tumor cells resulted in significantly decreased tumorigenesis, invasion, and metastasis in xenograft models. Together, these data demonstrate that cancer cell-derived Mmp1a acts as a robust functional homologue of MMP1 by conferring protumorigenic and metastatic behavior to cells.",

Earlier investigations controversially discussed a possible immunosuppressive function of artemsinin and its derivatives. This poses the question, whether immunosuppressive activity counteracts the anticancer activity in vivo. To clarify this issue, we used a transgenic mouse spontaneous melanoma model, in which ret transgene is expressed in melanocytes under the control of metallothionein-I promoter. ret-transgenic mice were previously reported to accumulate melanoma-specific effector memory T cells and natural killer (NK) cells in the primary tumors and metastatic lymph nodes. In the present investigation, we monitored effects of artesunate on the CD4 and CD8 T cells as well as Treg and NK cells from ret-transgenic tumor-bearing mice and nontransgenic littermates in vivo. In addition, we investigated cytostatic and cytotoxic activity of artesunate on ret-tumor cells established from the mouse primary tumor. Artesunate inhibited growth of ret-tumor cells and induces their apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner (0.1-200 micromol/l). Furthermore, we did not find considerable effects of artesunate on the immune function as measured by major cell populations of the immune system; that is, CD4 and CD8 T cells as well as Treg and NK cells both from ret-transgenic mice and nontransgenic C57BL/6 littermates treated for 2 weeks with a daily dose of 1 mg artesunate.

Strikingly, elevated concentrations of sULBP2, but not of sMICA, were strongly associated with disease progression (P < 0.0001) and tumor load (P = 0.0003). Elevated serum levels of either sNKG2DL correlated with reduced overall survival, albeit considerably stronger for sULBP2 (P < 0.0001) than for sMICA (P = 0.011).

They were stimulated to proliferate in culture in response to I-Ab antigen-bearing syngeneic spleen cells in a class II MHC-restricted manner. This stimulation was inhibited completely by the addition of anti-L3T4a (GK1.5) or anti-I-Ab (3JP) monoclonal antibodies. The autoreactive T cell clones lysed syngeneic I-Ab+ target cells such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) blasts. They also lysed I-A- bystander cells such as Cloudman and B16 melanoma and lymphoid tumor cells in the presence of I-Ab+ stimulator cells but not I-Ad+ cells. This bystander killing was most likely mediated by soluble factors released from the autoreactive T cells in response to I-Ab antigens, because culture supernatants from activated autoreactive T cells inhibited the proliferation of B16 melanoma cells in vitro and also had significant cytolytic activity. Both lymphotoxin and interferon-gamma were released from activated autoreactive T cells, suggesting that these cytotoxic lymphokines were responsible for autoreactive T cell-mediated cytolysis. The finding that the two clones, established independently and by different methods, show self-class II MHC antigen-restricted cytolysis, and bystander cytolysis suggests that these properties are not restricted to a unique population of autoreactive T cells.

Tumor cells often lose the balance of oxidation and antioxidation, but the role of G6PD in such an imbalance is still largely unknown. To investigate the related function of G6PD in tumor cells, we established a stable line of A375 human melanoma cells with G6PD gene knockdown by a shRNA lentiviral cloning and expression system. The A375-G6PDDelta cells displayed the stable GFP coexpression after repeated freeze-thaw cycles and multiple passages, accompanied by an 88.83% suppression of the endogenous G6PD expression and a 78.47% decrease in G6PD activity. In comparison with the A375-WT cells, they were characterized by a reduced proliferation with the MTT proliferation assay, a 25% decrease in colony-forming efficiency, and an up to 40% increase of apoptotic rate with flow cytometry analysis. When further challenged by diamide-induced oxidative stress, these cells showed that a median lethal dose (LD(50)) of 1.2 mM decreased from that of the A375-WT cells (1.8 mM), and levels of NADPH and GSH decreased by 2.4-, 8.8-fold, respectively, with a 7.3-fold increase of H(2)O(2), as those of A375-WT cells. These results demonstrated that A375-G6PDDelta is a new, stable G6PD-deficient human tumor cell line, and that silencing G6PD expression decreased tumor-cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis. In addition, G6PD gene knockdown rendered tumor cells more susceptible to diamide-induced oxidative stress.

        "Doc_abstract":"Despite their well-documented immunogenicity, malignant melanomas belong to the most aggressive tumor types. A potential explanation for this is the suboptimal activation of tumor infiltrating T cells. In order to boost immune responses against tumors, a variety of treatment modalities have been tested in animal models and in clinical setting. Antigen-nonspecific approaches (e.g., IFN-alpha and IL-2), as well as active specific immunotherapeutical modalities based on the use of autologous or allogeneic tumor cell-save been investigated in clinical trials of melanoma. The identification of melanoma-associated antigens has opened new avenues in antigen-specific immunotherapy. A promising alternative for the delivery of different forms of melanoma antigens is the application of dendritic cells, the most potent antigen presenting cells capable of eliciting efficient T-cell response. Beside active immunotherapy, immune response against melanoma antigens could be increased through the adoptive transfer of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes or antigen specific T-cell clones. The most important conclusion that can be drawn from the results of published immunotherapy studies is that these modalities are able to induce durable complete tumor regressions,mostly with reasonable toxicity; however, generally only in a minority of patients. This points to the importance of appropriate patient selection, with regard to the expression of the targeted antigens and HLA molecules, as well as to the general immunocompetence of the patients. A crucial and still unsolved question is monitoring immune activation during treatment, although there are promising new tools that could prove useful in this respect. The presence of tumor-reactive CTL in the circulation or in the tumors does not guarantee an efficient immune response. It is important to assess if these T cells are in an activated and functional state. Finally, in several single target antigen-based clinical studies a therapy-induced immunoselection of antigen-negative clones, leading to disease progression, was observed. This could be overcome with the use of antigen cocktails or whole tumor approaches. A better understanding of the mechanisms of action of immunotherapeutical modalities may enhance the success rate of these strategies.",

To verify whether inhibition of TCTP expression induces changes in the malignant phenotype, in the classical, well established model of \"flat reversion,\" v-src-transformed NIH3T3 cells were transfected with antisense TCTP. By inhibiting the expression of TCTP, the number of revertant cells was raised to 30%, instead of the reported rate for spontaneous flat revertants of 10(-6). Because TCTP encodes for a histamine-releasing factor, we tested the hypothesis that inhibitors of the histaminic pathway could be effective against tumor cells. We show that some antihistaminic compounds (hydroxyzine and promethazine) and other pharmacological compounds with a related structure (including thioridazine and sertraline) kill tumor cells and significantly decrease the level of TCTP.

The development of appropriate in vitro models that reflect the in vivo tumor environment is a key factor for the study of this malignancy. The local tumor microenvironment plays a critical role in the ability of tumor cells to proliferate and metastasize. While interactions among various cell types are known to be important for tumor growth, most in vitro models utilize only tumor cells, ignoring the importance of tumor-stroma interactions, as well as the contribution of immune cells, which may be important for potential therapies. In addition, the cellular architecture found in vivo, known to be involved in changes in gene expression, is not reflected in standard two-dimensional culture systems. In this study, we have utilized rotating-vessel bioreactors to culture minced human melanoma specimens, allowing the culture of three-dimensional structures which reflect the cellular architecture and heterogeneous composition of the tumor site in vivo. The viability of the pieces in culture can be maintained for 1-2 wk. Immunohistochemical analysis shows multiple cellular types similar to the in vivo situation. Therefore, this system provides a unique model of human melanoma that mimics the in vivo tumor environment much more closely than current culture methods. This novel system may be utilized to determine the mechanism of action of current therapy protocols, as well as to develop new treatment regimens.",

We sought to determine whether transduction of CIK cells with T cell receptor (TCR) genes specific for tumor-associated antigens could generate effector cells endowed with a double mechanism of tumor recognition. HLA-A2-restricted TCR-transduced (TD) CIK directed against the melanoma antigens Mart1 and NY-ESO1 were generated by lentiviral transduction and successfully expanded over a 3-4-week period. TD-CIK cells were both CD3(+)/CD56(-) and CD3(+)/CD56(+) (31±8% and 59±9%, respectively), indicating that both major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted T cells and MHC-unrestricted CIK could be targeted by lentiviral transduction. At the end of the culture, the majority of both unmodified and TD-CIK displayed an effector memory phenotype, without considerable expression of replicative senescence and exhaustion markers. Functionally, TD-CIK specifically recognized tumor cells expressing the relevant antigen as well as maintained their MHC-unrestricted tumor activity. The cytotoxic activity of TD-CIK against HLA-A2(+) melanoma cell lines was significantly higher than the untransduced counterparts at a low effector:target ratio (cytotoxic activity of TD-CIK was from 1.9- to 4.3-fold higher than untransduced counterparts). TD-CIK were highly proficient in releasing high amount of IFN-γ upon antigen-specific stimulation and were able to recognize primary melanoma targets. In conclusion, we showed that (1) the reproducibility and simplicity of CIK transduction and expansion might solve the problem of obtaining adequate numbers of potent antitumor effector cells for adoptive immunotherapy; (2) the presence of both terminal effectors as well as of less differentiated progenitors might confer them long survival in vivo; and (3) the addition of an MHC-restricted antigen recognition allows not only targeting tumor surface antigens but also a wider range of cytoplasmic or nuclear antigens, involved in tumor proliferation and survival. TD-CIK cells with a double mechanism of tumor recognition are an attractive and alternative tool for the development of efficient cell therapeutic strategies. ",

The purpose of this study was to establish whether expression of the human alpha 4 integrin subunit gene might be similarly regulated in human uveal melanoma which has varying degrees of invasiveness, and whether such modifications are determined by alterations in the transcriptional activity directed by the alpha 4 gene promoter. Two metastatic variants (MH5 and MH10) derived from a human uveal melanoma (SP6.5) were used. Expression studies were performed by transiently transfecting each of these cell lines with recombinant plasmids bearing various lengths of the alpha 4 promoter fused to the CAT reporter gene, and were further validated by Northern blot analyses of the alpha 4 transcript. Both transient transfection and mRNA analyses provided evidence that the transcriptional activity directed by the alpha 4 promoter sequences extending up to position -76 and -120 was indeed inversely correlated to the potential of uveal melanoma to yield metastasis. Experiments in electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) demonstrated that binding of the nuclear proteins that likely account for transcription of the alpha 4 gene to alpha 4.1 (namely Bp1, Bp2, Bp4, and Bp5) was dramatically reduced in uveal melanoma, but not in normal uveal melanocytes. These results highlight the fundamental function the alpha 4 integrin subunit may play in the ability of tumor cells to evade the primary tumor and form metastasis.",

We previously reported that the expression of keratin is a universal phenomenon seen in cultured melanoma cell lines, as demonstrated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, western blot, and electron microscopy analyses. To further investigate the specificity of keratin function in melanocytic cells, we first examined the presence of keratin proteins in cultured human melanocytes, and unexpectedly found keratin subunits in melanocytes by the above-mentioned procedures. The keratin (K) subunits were composed of K1, K5, K8, K10, K14, K16, and K18, together with vimentin. Neural crest cells, which contain immature embryonic melanocytes developing from ectoderm, already expressed keratins; however, under electron microscopy, the expressed keratin did not form filamentous structures. Although the ATP synthase alpha-chain, which is expressed universally in cultured epidermal tumor cell lines, was also expressed in cultured melanocytes and neural crest cells, a novel malignant melanoma-related protein (MMRP) was absent in melanocytes and neural crest cells.

To determine if T-cell-defined melanoma antigens are expressed on other tumors of neuroectodermal origin, four melanoma-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) cultures derived from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) were tested for lysis of a panel of 23 HLA-A2+ neuroectodermal tumor cell lines of various histologies, including retinoblastoma (1), neuroblastoma (8), neuroepithelioma (6), astrocytoma (2), neuroglioma (1), and Ewing's sarcoma (5). Low expression of MHC class I and/or ICAM-1 molecules was found on 22 of 23 neuroectodermal tumor lines, and could be enhanced by treatment with interferon gamma (IFN gamma). Following IFN gamma treatment, three Ewing's sarcoma lines were lysed by at least one melanoma TIL culture, and levels of lysis were comparable to melanoma lysis by these TIL. Lysis could be inhibited by monoclonal antibodies directed against MHC class I molecules and against CD3, indicating specific immune recognition of tumor-associated antigens. None of the other neuroectodermal tumors tested were lysed by TIL, but they could be lysed by non-MHC-restricted lymphokine-activated killer cells. This demonstration of immunological cross-reactivity between melanomas and Ewing's sarcomas, two tumors of distinct histological types with a common embryonic origin, has implications for the developmental nature of these CTL-defined tumor antigens. It also raises the possibility that specific antitumor immunotherapies, such as vaccines, may be reactive against more than one form of cancer.",

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from an HLA-DR4 healthy donor were used to induce HER-2/neu peptide-specific CD4(+) T cell clones by in vitro immunization with HER-2/neu peptide (884-899)-pulsed autologous dendritic cells (DCs). Strong proliferation and significant levels of IFN-gamma were induced by the CD4(+) T cell clones in response to specific stimulation with autologous DCs loaded with HER-2(884-899). Furthermore, these clones also recognized HER-2/neu(+) tumor cell lines, and tumor cells from breast, colorectal and pancreatic adenocarcinomas induced to express HLA-DR4, but also the HLA-DR4(+) melanoma cell line FM3 transfected to express HER-2/neu. The recognition of tumor cells was strongly inhibited by an anti-HLA-DR mAb.

Among these proteins, it was discovered a second transferrin receptor (TfR2), that seems to play a key role in the regulation of iron homeostasis. Its mutations are responsible for type 3 hemochromatosis (Type 3 HH). Although TfR2 expression in normal tissues was restricted at the level of liver and intestine, we observed that TfR2 was frequently expressed in tumor cell lines. Particularly frequent was its expression in ovarian cancer, colon cancer and glioblastoma cell lines; less frequent was its expression in leukemic and melanoma cell lines. Interestingly, in these tumor cell lines, TfR2 expression was inversely related to that of receptor 1 for transferrin (TfR1). Experiments of in vitro iron loading or iron deprivation provided evidence that TfR2 is modulated in cancer cell lines according to cellular iron levels following two different mechanisms: (i) in some cells, iron loading caused a downmodulation of total TfR2 levels; (ii) in other cell types, iron loading caused a downmodulation of membrane-bound TfR2, without affecting the levels of total cellular TfR2 content. Iron deprivation caused in both conditions an opposite effect compared to iron loading. These observations suggest that TfR2 expression may be altered in human cancers and warrant further studies in primary tumors. Furthermore, our studies indicate that, at least in tumor cells, TfR2 expression is modulated by iron through different biochemical mechanisms, whose molecular basis remains to be determined.",

To learn more about the immunohistochemical profile of nodal nevi we examined 15 nodal nevi for the expression of S-100 protein, gp100 (HMB-45), Melan-A/MART-1 (A103), and tyrosinase (T311), and we studied the expression of Ki-67 (MIB-1) in nodal nevi and 40 melanoma metastases (35 lymph node and five cutaneous metastases). All nodal nevi were homogeneously immunoreactive for S-100 protein, tyrosinase, and Melan-A/MART-1. Two nodal nevi were focally positive for gp100. Fourteen of 15 nodal nevi were completely negative for Ki-67. One large cellular nodal nevus showed nuclear labeling in <0.2% of melanocytes. All metastases showed MIB-1 labeling. However, the percentage of labeled tumor cells varied widely, ranging from 2% to 80%. These results demonstrate that MIB-1 and HMB-45 are helpful reagents for the distinction of nodal nevi from melanoma.

Three different injection schedules were used for each drug: (a) daily injection, starting 24 h before injection of the tumor cells; (b) single dose, 24 h preceding tumor challenge; (c) daily injection, starting 24 h after the injection of the tumor cells. All three compounds significantly reduced tumor lung deposits (Apigenin = Quercetin > Tamoxifen). However, when treatment was delayed by 24 h after tumor cells (schedule c), multiple daily doses of Apigenin or Quercetin were less effective that a single dose of the same compound given 24 h before tumor challenge (schedule b). Apigenin and Quercetin, but not Tamoxifen, were found to inhibit VCAM-1 expression in a dose-dependent manner in HUVEC and in murine pulmonary endothelial cells. In ex vivo experiments, the number of tumor cells adhering to lung vessels was significantly diminished in animals treated with a single dose of Apigenin and Quercetin.

In vivo, IRF-8 KO mice are highly permissive to B16 melanoma growth due to failure of immune cells to properly exert immunosurveillance. B16 cells and immune cells isolated from the spleen of wild type (WT) and IRF-8 KO mice were co-cultured for one week in a PDMS platform and monitored by fluorescence microscopy and time-lapse recordings. We observed that WT spleen cells migrated through microchannels connecting the culturing chambers towards B16 cells and tightly interacted with tumor cells, forming clusters of activation. In contrast, IRF-8 KO immune cells poorly interacted with melanoma cells. In parallel, B16 cells were more attracted towards microchannels, acquiring a more invasive behaviour in the presence of IRF-8 KO spleen cells, with respect to WT cells.

This study reveals the effect of high voltage pulsed, repetitive cold atmospheric plasma jets which are chemically activated with oxygen, on B16 tumoral cells (murine melanoma cell line) and COLO320DM multidrug resistant cells (human colon cancer cell line). The tests have been performed on human colon cancer cell line COLO320DM and murine melanoma cell line B16-F10.

A treatment time-dependent apoptosis has been observed only in the case of 816-F10 cells interacting with helium-oxygen plasma and no apoptosis has been identified when the cells were treated only with helium plasma jets. These results indicate the need of oxygen for the chemical activation of plasma.

GD2 has been used as a target for passive and active immunotherapy in patients with malignant melanoma and neuroblastoma. We have generated 47-LDA mimotope of GD2 by screening a phage display peptide library with anti-GD2 mAb 14G2a and reported that vaccination with the 47-LDA mimotope elicited GD2 cross-reactive IgG antibody responses as well as MHC class I-restricted CD8(+) T cells to syngeneic neuroblastoma tumor cells. The cytotoxic activity of the vaccine-induced CTLs was independent of GD2 expression, suggesting recognition of a novel tumor-associated antigen cross-reacting with 47-LDA. Immunoblotting studies using 14G2a mAb demonstrated that this antibody cross-reacts with a 105 kDa glycoprotein expressed by GD2(+) and GD2(-) neuroblastoma and melanoma cells. Functional studies of tumor cells grown in three-dimensional (3D) collagen cultures with 14G2a mAb showed decreases in matrix metalloproteinase-2 activation, a process regulated by 105 kDa activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecules (ALCAM/CD166). The CD166 glycoprotein was shown to be recognized by 14G2a antibody, and inhibition of CD166 expression by RNA interference ablated the cell sensitivity to lysis by 47-LDA-induced CD8(+) T cells in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that the vaccine-induced CTLs recognize a 47-LDA cross-reactive epitope expressed by CD166 and reveal a novel mechanism of induction of potent tumor-specific cellular responses by mimotopes of tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens.",

In this study, we employed CD73 gene-targeted mice to investigate the role of host-derived CD73 on antitumor immunity and tumor cell metastasis. We found that CD73 ablation significantly suppressed the growth of ovalbumin-expressing MC38 colon cancer, EG7 lymphoma, AT-3 mammary tumors, and B16F10 melanoma. The protective effect of CD73 deficiency on primary tumors was dependent on CD8(+) T cells and associated with an increased frequency of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells in peripheral blood and tumors and increased antigen-specific IFN-γ production. Replicate studies in bone marrow chimeras established that both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic expression of CD73 was important to promote tumor immune escape. Using adoptive reconstitution of T regulatory cell (Treg)-depleted DEREG (depletion of regulatory T cells) mice, we demonstrated that part of the protumorigenic effect of Tregs was dependent on their expression of CD73. CD73-deficient mice were also protected against pulmonary metastasis of B16F10 melanoma cells after intravenous injection. Unexpectedly, we found that the prometastatic effect of host-derived CD73 was dependent on CD73 expression on nonhematopoietic cells. CD73 expression on nonhematopoietic cells, most likely endothelial cells, was critical for promoting lung metastasis in a manner independent from immunosuppressive effects. Notably, in vivo blockade of CD73 with a selective inhibitor or anti-CD73 monoclonal antibody significantly reduced tumor growth and metastasis of CD73-negative tumors. Taken together, our findings indicate that CD73 may be targeted at multiple levels to induce anticancer effects including at the level of tumor cells, Tregs, and nonhematopoietic cells.",

We investigated IDO gene expression in melanoma cell lines and clinical specimens as compared to mature DC (mDC). Furthermore, we explored effects of L-kynurenine (L-kyn) and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA) on survival and antigen-dependent and independent proliferation of CD8(+) cells. We observed that IDO gene expression in cultured tumor cells and freshly excised samples is orders of magnitude lower than in mDC, providing highly efficient antigen presentation to CD8(+) T cells. Non toxic concentrations of L-kyn or 3-HAA did not significantly inhibit antigen-specific CTL responses. However, 3-HAA, but not L-kyn markedly inhibited antigen-independent proliferation of CD8(+) T cells induced by common receptor gamma-chain cytokines IL-2, -7 and -15.

The ability of B16 cells to adhere to fibronectin, which is in part mediated by the alpha IIb beta 3 integrin receptor, is predictive of metastatic potential. We determined that exposure to 0.25-2.5 Gy gamma radiation significantly enhanced B16 cell adhesion to fibronectin. The radiation-enhanced adhesion was dependent on enhanced expression of the alpha IIb beta 3 integrin. We observed that 15 min after 0.5 Gy radiation, 99% of irradiated B16 tumor cells were positively labeled with monoclonal antibodies directed against alpha IIb beta 3 compared to 22% of sham-irradiated cells. Radiation-enhanced expression of the alpha IIb beta 3 receptor is reversible and down-regulation begins within 2-4 h postirradiation. Finally, we found that irradiation significantly enhanced the ability of B16 cells to form metastases in a lung colony assay. It is concluded that a relationship exists between radiation effects on the B16 tumor cells, alpha IIb beta 3 receptor expression, adhesion in vitro, and metastasis in vivo. We suggest that low-dose radiation, at levels comparable to those used in fractionated or hyperfractionated radiotherapy, may alter the metastatic phenotype and potential of surviving tumor cells via a rapid alteration in their surface expression of alpha IIb beta 3 integrin receptors.",

D178 or FF amelanotic melanomas were implanted s.c. in Syrian hamsters. One group of D178- or FF-bearing hamsters (TD178 or TFF group) received intratumoral injections of pcDNA-Tyrs constructed as a tyrosinase expression plasmid. The other hamsters (pD178 and pFF groups) were injected with pUC119, and control hamsters (D178 and FF groups) only with transfection reagents. All the groups underwent immunofluorescence analysis of tyrosinase expression and BPA biodistribution studies. BNCT experiments were done at the Kyoto University Research Reactor. Tyrosinase expression increased in the tumors of the TD178 and TFF groups but remained the same in the pD178 and pFF groups. Tumor boron concentrations in the TD178 and TFF groups increased significantly (TD178: 49.7 +/- 12.6 versus D178: 27.2 +/- 4.9 microg/g, P < 0.0001; TFF: 30.7 +/- 6.6 versus FF: 13.0 +/- 4.7 microg/g, P < 0.0001).

Here we used human melanoma cell line mS and two variants selected from mS population: a) MDR variant of mS selected by colchicine (mS-0.5) and b) mS-trRAR/2--variant obtained by introduction of expressing retinoic acid receptor RAR-alpha cDNA into mS cell. The differentiation status, expression of MDR1 gene and Pgp functioning were compared in wild-type cells and mS variants. Electron microscopic examination of melanosomes showed that the mS-0.5 subline comprised more differentiating cells in the population than parental mS cultures and that these cells were at later stages of melanogenesis. The increase in the degree of differentiation in mS-0.5 population coincided with MDR1 gene overexpression, occurrence of Pgp molecules on the cell membrane and acceleration of Pgp-mediated Rhodamine 123 (Rh123) efflux. mS-trRAR/2, proved to be more differentiated than mS cells. The MDR1 mRNA level and Rh123 efflux were not elevated in mS-trRAR/2 cells, however, retinoic acid (RA) treatment increased both the degree of differentiation and Rh123 efflux in mS-trRAR/2 to a greater extent than in mS cultures. Thus, the data obtained in this study are in favor of the suppositions mentioned above. The mechanisms of coordinated alterations of differentiation and Pgp activity in MDR cells are discussed.",

Each tumor cell line showed a dose-dependent increase in SCE frequency above the spontaneous level in its own specific manner. The response in the malanoma cell was consistently below that of the control, but only the response to the highest dose of MMC (10(-9) M) was significantly lower than that of the control. The response of the colon tumor cells varied with respect to that of the control. Thus, it appears that karyotypic instability in tumor cells is not necessarily associated with elevated baseline or induced SCE/chromosome rates.

We demonstrated for the first time that eIF3f is downregulated in most human tumors using a cancer profiling array and confirmed by real-time reverse transcription PCR in melanoma and pancreatic cancer. Overexpression of eIF3f inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in melanoma and pancreatic cancer cells. Silencing of eIF3f protects melanoma cells from apoptosis. We further investigated the biological function of eIF3f. In vitro translation studies indicate that eIF3f is a negative regulator of translation and that the region between amino acids 170 and 248 of eIF3f is required for its translation regulatory function. Ectopic expression of eIF3f inhibits translation and overall cellular protein synthesis. Ribosome profile and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) fragmentation assays revealed that eIF3f reduces ribosomes, which may be associated with rRNA degradation.

Here we show that B16 metastatic murine melanoma cells exhibit a 5-fold higher cell surface GT activity than their nonmetastatic counterparts, although total GT activity in NP-40 solubilized cells is similar for both melanoma variants. Interestingly, on living cells, this cell surface GT almost exclusively galactosylates an endogenous glycoprotein (Mr = 110,000). This metastasis-associated GT is specific for terminal D-N-acetylglucosamine, catalyzes the formation of a beta 1-4 linkage, does not recognize polylactosaminoglycans, and has its specificity altered from D-N-acetylglucosamine to D-glucose by alpha-lactalbumin; yet the Mr = 110,000 protein is not a major substrate when exogenous bovine GT is used on the outside of living cells. In addition to this protein-specific endogenous GT activity, another cell surface GT activity that selectively galactosylates glucosylceramide is also prominent. Endogenous galactosylation of both protein and glycolipid substrates is reduced when the membrane is solubilized by the detergent NP-40 but remains unaltered in the presence of digitonin, which permeabilizes but does not dissolve the membrane. These data suggest that the GTs and their substrates are associated on the cell surface. Chloroquine treatment of intact cells leads to a 4-fold and a 3-fold increase in galactosylation of the Mr = 110,000 protein and glucosylceramide, respectively, suggesting that these two substrates normally reside mostly in the lysosomal or Golgi compartments. The increased expression of lysosomal membrane proteins on the surfaces of highly metastatic cells may, in part, also explain the galactosylation differences observed. These studies further suggest that increased surface localization of certain glycosyltransferases with highly restricted in situ substrate specificities may be a common feature of highly metastatic tumor cells.",

The number of each type of microcirculation pattern was counted. Invasion and metastasis were observed. Epithelial cell kinase (EphA2), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 expression and their mRNA levels were detected by immunohistochemical staining and real-time PCR and compared between the two groups. Five invasions and six lung metastases were found in the subretinal group while no invasion and metastasis were found in the groin group. The number of vasculogenic mimicry (VM) was significantly higher in the subretinal group (P=0.000). However, no significant difference in the numbers of mosaic and endothelium-dependent vessels was observed between the two groups (P=0.076 and 0.146, respectively).

Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) from Ligusticum wallichil Franch. possesses anti-inflammatory and antitumor activities. It has recently been suggested that autocrine IL-8 may play a role in tumor cell survival, invasion and migration. The role of TMP in association with IL-8 in the tumor cell migratory process remains unclear. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether TMP influences the migratory ability of a human ovarian carcinoma cell line (SKOV3) via regulation of IL-8 expression in vitro. Cell counts showed that treatment of SKOV3 with TMP (25-100 µg/ml) for 24 h did not decrease cell numbers, while an effect of TMP on the down-regulation of the expression of IL-8 was observed. In addition, migration of SKOV3 cells was suppressed after treatment with TMP (25-100 µg/ml) for 24 h. Therefore, expression of IL-8 by SKOV3 cells correlates with their metastatic potential. Western blot analysis revealed that ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation was blocked by TMP. Furthermore, IL-8 mRNA expression was inhibited significantly after co-incubation with PD98059 (ERK inhibitor) and SB203580 (p38 inhibitor), respectively. Notably, these changes were the results of activator protein-1 (AP-1) activity suppression rather than that of NF-κB.

The expression pattern of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), FLT-1, KDR and thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) was studied by immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. CD105 stained significantly less vessels, but gave only limited additional prognostic information compared with Factor-VIII, and MVD was an independent prognostic factor for both markers. Ninety-eight percent of all cases showed expression of VEGF, and higher expression was found significantly more frequent in thinner and less vascularized tumors. Possible autocrine loops were suggested by co-expression of VEGF and its two receptors in tumor cells, and by a significant correlation between KDR and tumor cell proliferation (Ki-67) in the subgroup of thicker tumors. Staining of VEGF receptors in endothelium was not correlated with MVD. Strong expression of TSP-1 in tumor stroma was found in 43% of the primary tumors, and was significantly correlated with increased thickness, proliferation and MVD, as well as decreased survival. These data suggest that MVD is associated with prognosis in cutaneous melanomas, and that the VEGF system and particularly TSP-1 seem to be involved in the regulation of angiogenesis and progression of these tumors.",

Induction of ACAID requires that alloantigen presentation occur via the anterior chamber; injection by other routes failed to elicit this phenomenon. Antigenic material must remain in the anatomically intact eye for at least 10 days; removal of the injected dye before this time prevented the establishment of ACAID. The similar temporal requirement for an anatomically intact spleen confirms the validity of the concept of a camero-splenic axis for processing of intracamerally injected alloantigens. Deployment of an alternate model of ACAID, using LP/J mice injected intracamerally with B16F10 melanoma, showed the antigen-specific inductive signal for ACAID (transmitted via the camero-splenic axis) was not in the form of viable alloantigen-bearing tumor cells that metastasize to the spleen. B16F10 melanoma cells were never found in the spleens or any other extraocular sites after intracameral injection, despite the fact these mice manifested ACAID and harbored enormous ocular tumors.

For the primary tumor, this neovascularization provides nutrients and oxygen as well as a route by which metastatic tumor cells gain access to the circulatory system. Among these metastatic tumor cells, there are subgroups of cells that express an angiogenesis-inducing cells phenotype (AICs) as well as others that do not. Tumor cells not expressing the angiogenesis-inducing cells phenotype (non-AICs) invade new tissues and remain as dormant micrometastases unless they accompany AICs. Thus, either alone or with non-AICs, angiogenesis-inducing cells form rapidly growing, clinically detectable metastases. Much of the current research in this area is concentrated on the vascularization of primary tumors, but the regulation of angiogenesis by extravasating or invading tumor cells has not being extensively studied. We have developed a working model, which demonstrates that human metastatic prostate cancer cells (PC-3) appear to induce human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) to translocate across a Matrigel-coated 8 mm membrane. The parameters of this model (i.e. pore size, seeding-cell density, seeding times) were established using highly invasive murine melanoma cells (B16F10) seeded on murine microvascular endothelial cells (CD3).

The objective of this study was to determine how IFN-gamma influences the inflammatory response within this dynamic environment following radiotherapy. B16/OVA melanoma cells were implanted into C57BL/6 (wild-type (WT)) and IFN-gamma-deficient (IFN-gamma-/-) mice. Seven days after implantation, mice received 15 Gy of localized tumor irradiation and were assessed 7 days later. Irradiation up-regulated the expression of VCAM-1 on the vasculature of tumors grown in WT but not in IFN-gamma-/- mice. Levels of the IFN-gamma-inducible chemokines MIG and IFN-gamma-inducible protein 10 were decreased in irradiated tumors from IFN-gamma-/- mice compared with WT. In addition to inducing molecular cues necessary for T cell infiltration, surface MHC class I expression is also up-regulated in response to IFN-gamma produced after irradiation. The role of IFN-gamma signaling in tumor cells on class I expression was tested using B16/OVA cells engineered to overexpress a dominant negative mutant IFN-gamma receptor (B16/OVA/DNM). Following implantation and treatment, expression of surface class I on tumor cells in vivo was increased in B16/OVA, but not in B16/OVA/DNM tumors, suggesting IFN-gamma acts directly on tumor cells to induce class I up-regulation. These increases in MHC class I expression correlated with greater levels of activated STAT1. Thus, IFN-gamma is instrumental in creating a tumor microenvironment conducive for T cell infiltration and tumor cell target recognition.",

Immune reactivity to that epitope was detected by DR4-peptide tetramer staining, and enzyme-linked immunospot assay of fresh and restimulated CD4(+) T cells from patients over the course of the 12-month vaccine regimen. The postvaccine CD4(+) T cells exhibited a mixed T-helper 1/T-helper 2 phenotype, proliferated in response to the antigen and promiscuously recognized the peptide epitope bound to different human leukocyte antigen-DRbeta alleles. For 1 DRbeta1*0401(+) patient, antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells recognized human leukocyte antigen-matched antigen-expressing tumor cells, secreted granzyme B, and also exhibited cytolysis that was MHC class II-restricted.

The 10-year melanoma-specific survival was significantly associated with ezrin immunoreactivity (P = 0.018). After adjustment by Cox regression for tumor size, cell type, microvascular loops and networks, and microvascular density, a clinically meaningful 0.15 difference in 10-year melanoma-specific survival persisted.;The presence of ezrin immunoreactivity in uveal malignant melanoma is associated with higher mortality and with two independent high-risk characteristics: microvascular density and number of infiltrating macrophages.

        "Doc_abstract":"This protocol presents a new therapeutic approach to the treatment of patients with otherwise incurable malignant metastatic melanoma. Its objective is to define the safety of escalating doses of an anti-cancer treatment involving intratumoral injections of cells that produce recombinant retroviruses. The experimental treatment is based on the introduction into tumoral cells of a suicide gene coding for the herpes simple virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV1-TK). Cells that express HSV1-TK become sensitive to ganciclovir (GCV). GCV has no toxicity for normal cells, but kills cells expressing the HSV1-TK enzyme. Such toxicity is restricted to cells undergoing division. Introduction of the gene into tumoral cells is obtained through the intratumoral injection of murine fibroblasts modified by genetic engineering (M11 cells). These cells continuously produce recombinant defective retroviruses containing the HSV1-TK gene. Retroviruses can integrate their genes only when the cells they infect are undergoing division. Thus, after intratumoral injection of M11 cells, the tumoral cells, but not the quiescent cells of the healthy tissue surrounding them, express the HSV1-TK gene and can be destroyed by GCV. In addition, tumoral cells that do not express the gene, but which are located in the immediate vicinity of the transduced cells, are also destroyed through a \"bystander effect,\" also restricted to cells undergoing division. It is therefore not necessary for all the tumoral cells to express HSV1-TK for all of them to be destroyed. Finally, preliminary data suggest that this localized tumoricidal activity may trigger a more general antineoplastic action, by facilitating a specific antitumoral immune response. The efficacy of the above therapeutic approach has been evidenced with animals in the treatment of brain tumors, of colic adenocarcinoma hepatic metastases and of malignant melanoma. A therapeutic trial on recurrent brain tumors or metastases has begun in the USA, using a similar approach. We propose a phase I-II clinical study of the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma. The patients enrolled in the study must present a metastatic malignant melanoma that is no longer treatable by conventional therapy (life expectancy of patients < 12 months). Progressively increased doses of M11 cells (1 x 10(8), 2 x 10(8), 3 x 10(8) cells/cm3 of tumor) will be injected transcutaneously in the cutaneous, sub-cutaneous or ganglionary tumoral nodules. For a given dosage, four patients receiving the treatment will be studied. Four additional patients will be enrolled at the higher tolerated dosage. We will study the safety and the tumoricidal effect of the direct intratumoral injection of M11 cells followed by treatment with GCV at a constant, intravenous dosage of 10 mg/kg/d x 14 days.",

Although strong CTL activity may be induced ex vivo against most of these antigens, often in the presence of excess cytokines and antigen, a clear understanding of the functional status of CTL in vivo and their impact on tumor growth, is still lacking. Several mechanisms are described that potentially contribute to tumor cell evasion of the immune response, suggesting that any antitumor efficacy achieved by immune effectors may be offset by factors that result ultimately in tumor progression. Nevertheless, most of these MAA are currently being investigated as immunizing agents in clinical studies, the conflicting results of which are reviewed.

The staining results were assessed independently for tumor cells and stroma cells in comparison to inbuilt reference structures. Vimentin is found in all melanocytic lesions in the tumor as well as in the stroma cells. In malignant lesions, the tumor cell staining intensity varies between neighboring regions; particularly in malignant melanoma the staining is pronounced in the tumor periphery (chi 2 test: p less than 0.05). Actin is only weakly positive in nevus cells and primary melanoma tumor cells, but strongly expressed in metastatic tumor cells (p less than 0.001). Nevus fibroblasts are only weakly positive, whereas the stroma fibroblasts in the malignant lesions are strongly positive (p less than 0.001). The same is true for myosin and tubulin expression in dermal fibroblasts (p less than 0.001), whereas the tumor cells are equally (weakly) positive in all melanocytic lesions. Our study shows that there are significant differences in the immunohistochemical expression of cytoskeletal components in various melanocytic tumors.

Initial studies confirm an inverse correlation between mda-7 expression and melanoma development and progression. Forced expression of mda-7 by means of a plasmid or via a replication incompetent adenovirus (Ad.mda-7) promotes growth suppression and induces apoptosis in a broad array of human cancers. In contrast, mda-7 does not induce growth suppressive or toxic effects in normal cells. Based on structure (containing an IL-10 signature motif), secretion by cells (including subsets of T-cells) and location on chromosome 1q (in an area containing IL-10-family genes), mda-7 has now been renamed mda-7/IL-24. Studies by several laboratories have uncovered many of mda-7/IL-24's unique properties, including cancer-specific apoptosis-induction, cell cycle regulation, an ability to inhibit angiogenesis, potent 'bystander antitumor activity' and a capacity to enhance the sensitivity of tumor cells to radiation, chemotherapy and monoclonal antibody therapy. Moreover, based on its profound cancer tropism, substantiated by in vivo human xenograft studies in nude mice, mda-7/IL-24 (administered as Ad.mda-7) was evaluated in a phase I clinical trial in patients with melanomas and solid cancers. These studies document that mda-7/IL-24 is well tolerated and demonstrates evidence of significant clinical activity. In these contexts, mda-7/IL-24 represents a unique cytokine gene with potential for therapy of human cancers. The present review focuses on three unique properties of mda-7/IL-24, namely its potent 'bystander antitumor activity', ability to sensitize tumor cells to radiation, and its antiangiogenesis properties.

Novel molecular biomarkers, which are involved in malignant transformation, proliferation, angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, are currently under investigation to elucidate the risk for lymph node metastasis. To this end, the vascular endothelial growth factors VEGF-C and VEGF-D have been identified to promote lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic spread through activation of its receptor, Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3). Prompted by this assumption, we estimated the degree of lymphangiogenesis by semiquantitative immunohistochemical analysis of the expression of VEGFR-3 and the panvascular marker CD31 in primary cutaneous melanoma (n=26) and correlated these findings with the sentinel lymph node (SLN) status. The cohort was selected for matched prognostic markers in SLN-positive and SLN-negative patients. In contrast to other studies, we observed an inverse correlation between expression of these markers with lymph node metastases. Additionally, no difference between intratumoral versus peritumoral CD31- or VEGFR-3 expression on blood vessels versus lymphatic capillaries could be detected. Interestingly, VEGFR-3 upregulation was not restrained to vascular structures but also appeared on tumor cells. In summary, in our series VEGFR-3/CD31 immunohistochemical staining of primary melanoma does not serve as a valid marker to predict lymph node involvement. As lymphatic spread is a complex, multi-step process, several different biomarkers have to be combined to define new prognostic subgroups in cutaneous melanoma.",

However, three cell types, undifferentiated basal keratinocytes, their differentiated derivatives, and breast adenocarcinoma cells, showed an expression pattern distinct from the typical one, having abundant 3-kb mRNA but no detectable 2.1-kb mRNA. The mRNA was translated and the product secreted. This expression pattern was not observed before in human cells and was not found in tumor cells of keratinocytes, squamous carcinoma cells, or many other adenocarcinoma cells. We showed by Northern hybridization that the SPARC-expressing melanocytic melanoma cell lines produced laminin, a component of extracellular matrix. Other cell types expressing the SPARC mRNA were also reported to synthesize extracellular matrix components. Thus, our results indicate an association between SPARC gene expression and production of extracellular matrix. However, the opposite is not true since non-SPARC-producers may or may not produce extracellular matrix.

By flow cytometry, unstimulated primary lung ECs showed constitutive expression of vascular cellular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), whereas skin-derived ECs did not. All B16 cell lines tested showed constitutive expression of alpha(4) and beta(1) integrin chains but showed no expression of beta(2) integrins. CXCR4-B16 arrest on VCAM-1/immunoglobulin-coated plates and tumor necrosis factor alpha-stimulated ECs under physiological shear stress conditions (1.5 dynes/cm(2)) was rapid, resistant to shear stress of 10 dynes/cm(2), and showed no evidence of rolling before arrest. In vitro, CXCR4-B16 cell binding to ECs was blocked by anti-beta(1) and anti-CXCL12 monoclonal antibodies. In vivo, metastasis of CXCR4-B16 cells to murine lungs was strongly inhibited by anti-CXCL12 and two different anti-beta(1) monoclonal antibodies. Finally, CXCR4-B16 exposed to CXCL12 rapidly increased binding affinity for soluble VCAM-1/immunoglobulin as detected by a flow cytometric assay. Thus, beta(1) integrins play a critical role in CXCR4-mediated B16 tumor cell metastasis in vivo and may be a potential target for inhibition of tumor metastasis, particularly to the lung.",

In current practice, most patients with BRAF V600 mutant melanomas will see both modalities. Several in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that combining immunotherapy with MAPK inhibition may have synergistic effects. First, mouse models show that adoptive cell therapy (ACT) can be enhanced by vaccination. Rapid tumor destruction by vemurafenib could provide a vaccine-like stimulus to adoptively transferred T cells. Second, both in mice and in early clinical trials, melanoma metastases treated with MAPK inhibitors seem to display increased T-cell infiltrates. Third, MAPK inhibition upregulates the expression of some melanoma antigens and, therefore, may enhance T-cell recognition of vemurafenib-treated melanomas. Fourth, vemurafenib may sensitize tumor cells to immune destruction. Finally, some investigators have found that an optimal antitumor effect from MAPK inhibition is dependent on an intact host immune response. Currently, the Surgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute has initiated a phase II trial combining the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib with ACT using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in patients with BRAF-mutant tumors to investigate the safety and efficacy of this combination. The proposed mechanisms for synergy between these two modalities can be complex, and their optimal combination may require testing a variety of sequences and schedules.",

The aim of this study was to assess the expression of nonclassical HLA-G antigens in ex vivo human melanoma biopsies. HLA-G mRNA levels corresponding to both membrane-bound and soluble protein isoforms were analyzed in tumor specimens obtained from primary or metastatic melanomas of 23 patients. High levels of HLA-G transcription were detected in tumor specimens in 5 of 23 patients and found to be comparable in both lymph node and skin metastases. HLA-G mRNA transcript levels at tumor sites in 18 of these patients were compared with those in samples of their own healthy skin and were higher in the tumor tissue in 12 patients. Differential expression of mRNA transcripts corresponding to soluble and membrane-bound HLA-G was also observed in some tumor biopsies. HLA-G protein expression was detected in tumors that exhibited high levels of HLA-G transcription by immunofluorescence of frozen sections and Western blot analysis of both tumor and healthy skin biopsies, using anti-HLA-G-specific monoclonal antibodies. This work provides evidence that HLA-G gene transcription and protein expression can be up-regulated ex vivo in melanoma.

FAP-alpha and DPPIV can form heteromeric complexes with each other and may function coordinately to modulate the growth, differentiation, adhesion, and metastasis of tumor cells. This review is focused on FAP-alpha and summarizes a series of studies showing that elevated expression of FAP-alpha results in profound changes in growth and malignant behavior of tumor cells. Depending on the model system investigated, FAP-alpha expression causes dramatic promotion or suppression of tumor growth. In the case of tumor promotion, FAP-alpha expression can drive tumor growth by increasing angiogenesis and by decreasing the anti-tumor response of the immune system. In the case of tumor suppression, FAP-alpha can decrease tumorigenicity of mouse melanoma cells and restore contact inhibition and growth factor dependence even when it is catalytically inactive, implying that protein-protein interactions mediate these effects. Understanding how FAP-alpha activates cell signaling is critical to determining how FAP-alpha mediates growth promotion versus growth suppression in the different model systems and ultimately in human cancer patients. In particular, the roles of FAP-alpha protease activity and FAP-alpha complex formation with DPPIV and other surface molecules in activating cell signaling need to be elucidated since these represent potential targets for therapeutic intervention.",

Both clones expressed cytotoxicity in a reasonable stable manner without dependence on IL2 for growth or function. Interferon had no effect on the cytotoxicity of the hybrids against the natural killer (NK)-sensitive target cells K562 or the DW cells. The cytotoxic activities of the hybrids against the sensitizing target cells DW, however, could be markedly facilitated in the presence of IL2-containing supernatants in the assay medium and less so in the presence of lectin. The range of the cytotoxic activities of the two clones was identical and restricted to the DW cells and another melanoma cell line, suggesting the possibility of a shared target molecule(s) between these two target cells for these cytotoxic hybrids. These observations indicate that the hybrids might require a mediator present in IL2 supernatant for optimum expression of cytotoxicity and suggest that the hybrids express the cytotoxic specificity of the hybridized CTL. These hybrids offer unique opportunities for critical examination of the molecular mechanisms of cellular cytotoxicity and specificities exhibited by activated human CTL.",

Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) generated from the H-2Kb+ BL6 lesions (Thy 1.2+, CD8+, CD4-) efficiently lysed H-2Kb+ melanoma (CL8-1 and 2Kb38) and the H-2Kb+ nonrelated 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA)-105 sarcoma, but not the H-2Kb- parental melanoma BL6-8. This strongly suggests that CL8-1, 2Kb38, and MCA-105 express identical or cross-reactive T cell epitopes recognized by CL8-1 TILs in the context of the H-2Kb class I allele. To identify the T cell epitopes, peptides were acid-eluted from various cells, and fractionated by HPLC. Five HPLC fractions (F1mel-F5mel) of 70 tested contained peptides derived from H-2Kb+ CL8-1 melanoma (but not H-2Kb- melanomas) that were capable of conferring susceptibility to CL8-1 TIL lysis on H-2b-expressing target cells (EL4, C1R.Kb), but not on H-2d-expressing P815 target cells. CL8-1 TILs failed to recognize peptides derived from H-2Kb+ nonmelanoma targets such as EL4 or normal B6 splenocytes. Interestingly, CL8-1 TILs appeared to recognize peptide species contained in two HPLC fractions derived from the MCA-105 sarcoma (F1sar and F5sar).

Incubation of plasma membranes isolated from cultured human melanoma cells with [gamma-32P]ATP in the presence of Ca2+ and ethylene-bis-(oxyethylenenitrilo)-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) resulted in specific phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues on a 75kDa protein (pp75). 3.

Even though the tumor cells lacked expression of CD40, CD80, and CD86 costimulatory molecules, the i.v. injection of tumor/Gal resulted in IFN-gamma secretion by NKT and NK cells. These innate responses to tumor/Gal, including the induction of IL-12p70, were comparable to or better than alpha-GalCer-loaded DCs. B16 melanoma cells that were stably transduced to express higher levels of CD1d showed an increased capacity relative to wild-type B16 cells to present alpha-GalCer in vivo. Three different tumor cell lines, when loaded with alpha-GalCer, failed to establish tumors upon i.v. injection, and the mice survived for at least 6 mo. The resistance against tumor cells was independent of CD4 and CD8 T cells but dependent upon NKT and NK cells. Mice were protected from the development of metastases if the administration of live B16 tumor cells was followed 3 h or 3 days later by the injection of CD1d(high)-alpha-GalCer-loaded B16 tumor cells with or without irradiation.

Following exposure to alpha-thrombin, Walker 256 carcinosarcoma cells and B16 amelanotic melanoma cells became more adherent to both endothelial cell monolayers and the subendothelial matrix component, fibronectin. Preincubation of W256 and B16a cells with doses of alpha-thrombin from 0.01 to 10.0 U/ml produced a bell shape dose-response curve with the maximal effect (a 2-5-fold increase in adhesion) observed at 0.1 U/ml (corresponding to 0.8 nM). Complexes of alpha-thrombin with its inhibitors, hirudin and antithrombin III-heparin, diminished its effect on tumor cell adhesion. The effect of thrombin on tumor cell adhesion may be mediated by the alpha IIb beta 3 integrin as thrombin increased cell surface expression of the alpha IIb beta 3 complex. The significance of the in vitro observations was further substantiated by results of in vivo studies. Pretreatment of B16a cells with alpha-thrombin resulted in a 2-fold increase in the number of metastatic lung colonies in an experimental metastasis model.

The most frequent genetic alteration during metastatic progression detected was the loss of p16INK4a protein expression (four of 14 cases), whereas no somatic p16INK4a gene mutations were found in any primary or metastatic tumors. LOH analyses showed that most of the chromosome losses including 6q, 8p, 9p, 9q, and 18q were shared between primary tumors and their metastases. Nevertheless, LOH of 6q and 11q and LOH of 7q not detected in primary tumors were, respectively, observed in two lymph node metastases. These results suggest that loss of p16INK4a protein expression (but not p16INK4a gene mutation) and the losses of chromosome arms 6q, 7q, and 11q play an important role in the acquisition of metastatic potential in sporadic melanoma. Furthermore, comparison of genetic profiles between the primary tumor and its metastasis revealed in several cases that heterogenous tumor cell populations might already exist at the early stage of tumorigenesis and evolve independently in the primary tumor and its metastasis, strongly suggesting that metastatic progression of sporadic melanoma is not accounted for by a linear progression model.",

Expression vectors with cDNA encoding either full-length wild-type or His321 mutant form, isolated from a flat revertant of Ras-transformed cells and a carboxyl-terminal truncate, C-del of gelsolin, were transfected into a highly metastatic murine melanoma cell line, B16-BL6.

We characterized phenotypes of transfectants, such as growth rate, colony formation in soft agar, cell motility and metastasis formation in vivo. Transfectants expressing the wild-type, His321 mutant and C-del gelsolin exhibited reduced growth ability in soft agar. Although expression of integrin beta1 or alpha4 on the cell surface of transfectants was not changed, wild-type and His321 mutant gelsolin, except for C-del gelsolin, exhibited retardation of cell spreading, reduced chemotatic migration to fibronectin and suppressed lung colonization in spontaneous metastasis assay.

We report that HDIL-2 increased both frequencies and absolute numbers of Th17 cells on day 4 of treatment. The administration of HDIL-2 to patients with melanoma increased IL-6 production by peripheral immune cells, a cytokine vital in the downregulation of FoxP3 expression and expansion of the Th17-cell population. Furthermore, we demonstrated that FoxP3CD4 T cells express IL-17 in patients with melanoma undergoing HDIL-2 therapy.

Subcutaneous transplant lines were then established from the melanotic and the amelanotic zones of such a melanoma and were carried in transgenic male hosts to ensure the male composition of the stroma. Thus, the male-specific H-Y histocompatibility antigen, which is ubiquitously expressed on male cells, could provide the target for an immune attack against the stroma. The transplant lines were next passaged once in transgenic females preimmunized against the H-Y antigen by having received and rejected a graft of C57BL/6 nontransgenic male skin. The antistromal immune response of these hosts did not prevent recovery of the tumors, which required a substantially prolonged latency. However, after retransplantation to nonimmunized males and females, the latency was markedly shortened from the original level.

Whole genome transcriptional analysis clearly indicate that regression of melanoma metastases is due to an acute immune rejection mediated by the upregulation of genes involved in antigen presentation and interferon mediated response (STAT-1/IRF-1) in all the regressing metastases from both patients. In contrast, progressing metastases showed low transcription levels of genes involved in these pathways. Histological analysis showed T cells and HLA-DR positive infiltrating cells in the regressing but not in the progressing metastases. Quantitative expression analysis of HLA-A,B and C genes on microdisected tumoral regions indicate higher HLA expression in regressing than in progressing metastases. The molecular signature obtained in melanoma rejection appeared to be similar to that observed in other forms of immune-mediated tissue-specific rejection such as allograft, pathogen clearance, graft versus host or autoimmune disease, supporting the immunological constant of rejection. We favor the idea that the major factor determining the success or failure of immunotherapy is the nature of HLA Class I alterations in tumor cells and not the type of immunotherapy used.

Birnbaum, Fibroblast Growth Factors in Normal and Malignant Melanocytes, pp. 232-243. New York: The New York Academy of Sciences, 1991). We have studied the expression of the Tie endothelial cell receptor tyrosine kinase mRNA in skin and primary cutaneous melanomas as well as in their skin and brain metastases by in situ hybridization. The Tie probe hybridized very weakly with the vascular endothelium of capillaries of normal skin, while it was detected in larger arteries and veins as well as in capillaries around sweat glands. However, capillaries and medium-sized vessels within cutaneous and brain metastases of melanoma were strongly positive for Tie mRNA. In contrast, endothelial cells contained very little or no FGFR-1 transcripts, whereas abundant FGFR-1 mRNA was present in melanoma tumor cells and in fibrovascular stroma. In agreement with these findings, a Tie-specific amplified cDNA band was obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from melanoma metastases but not from normal skin. These results suggest a role for the Tie receptor in the angiogenesis associated with melanoma metastases.",

Lymphoid cells obtained from buffy coats were separated on Ficoll-Paque, cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen, thawed, and cultured for 1-2 weeks in the presence of crude IL-2 (containing phytohemagglutinin) before injection. CLC were tested for sterility, percent E-rosette-forming cells, and cytotoxicity against K562, allogeneic melanoma, and breast cancer cell lines and autologous tumor cells. Enhanced cytotoxicity was expressed by IL-2 CLC, as compared with nonstimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). Arrest of tumor growth (compared with untreated lesions) was observed in eight lesions and partial regression in three lesions. Moreover, complete regression was noted in one large melanoma lesion treated with low-dose irradiation prior to intralesional administration of CLC and in three small intracutaneous melanoma lesions treated with CLC only. Histopathological findings of responding lesions showed infiltration with lymphoid cells and macrophages, with the tumor cells sparsely dispersed. No untoward side effects of CLC injections were observed. The present study points to the feasibility of trials of adoptive immunotherapy in cancer patients as indicated by the following: (a) response of lymphoid cells to IL-2 adequate--although reduced--in patients with metastatic disease, including those after chemo- or radiotherapy; (b) possibility of cryopreservation of PBL and repeated culturing in IL-2 after thawing, with cytotoxic activity unimpaired; (c) demonstrably enhanced cytotoxicity in vitro of IL-2 CLC; (d) demonstrable--although limited--clinical response to in situ treatments with IL-2 CLC; (e) good tolerance of treatment with CLC.",

By immunostaining, ADAM 12 (meltrin alpha) was up-regulated in several human carcinomas and could be detected along the tumor cell membranes. Because of this intriguing staining pattern, we investigated whether human ADAM 12 supports tumor cell adhesion. Using an in vitro assay using recombinant polypeptides expressed in Escherichia coli, we examined the ability of individual domains of human ADAM 12 and ADAM 15 to support tumor cell adhesion. We found that the disintegrin-like domain of human ADAM 15 supported adhesion of alphavbeta3-expressing A375 melanoma cells. In the case of human ADAM 12, however, recombinant polypeptides of the cysteine-rich domain but not the disintegrin-like domain supported cell adhesion of a panel of carcinoma cell lines. On attachment to recombinant polypeptides from the cysteine-rich domain of human ADAM 12, most tumor cell lines, such as MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells, were rounded and associated with numerous actin-containing filopodia and used a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan to attach. Finally, we demonstrated that authentic full-length human ADAM 12 could bind to heparin Sepharose. Together these results suggest a novel role of the cysteine-rich domain of ADAM 12 -- that of supporting tumor cell adhesion.",

Downregulation of MHC class I expression is thought to be a mechanism by which tumor cells escape from T cell-mediated lysis. In primary human melanomas and melanoma cell lines, HLA-B expression is frequently downmodulated, correlating with elevated expression of the c-myc oncogene. Transfection experiments have shown that c-myc induces HLA-B downregulation through a -68 to +13 base pairs (bp) core promoter fragment, containing CCAAT and TATA-like (TCTA) boxes. Since (i) c-myc has been reported to activate the human p53 promoter and (ii) p53 is capable of repressing a large array of basal promoters, we investigated whether c-myc-induced HLA-B abrogation is mediated by p53. In this article, it is shown that the HLA-B core promoter is indeed repressed by wild-type p53, making p53 a candidate for mediating c-myc-induced HLA-B downregulation. However, transfection of c-myc into p53-null cell lines still resulted in suppression of the basal HLA-B promoter, demonstrating that c-myc and p53 repress the minimal HLA-B promoter through independent mechanisms.",

Colon tumor recognition by Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells was highly dependent on isopentenyl pyrophosphate production and ICAM-1 expression by target cells. Finally, similar reactivity patterns against colon carcinoma cell lines were observed using polyclonal Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells of various origins, and Vgamma9Vdelta2 lymphocytes were present in the majority of colon tumor samples studied.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the angiogenesis and metastasis of melanoma are promoted by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin 8 (IL-8), platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF), and/or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Cells from human melanoma lines (A-07, D-12, R-18, and U-25) transplanted to BALB/c nu/nu mice were used as tumor models. Expression of angiogenic factors was studied by ELISA, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Angiogenesis was assessed by using an intradermal angiogenesis assay. Lung colonization and spontaneous lung metastasis were determined after i.v. and intradermal inoculation of tumor cells, respectively. The specific roles of VEGF, IL-8, PD-ECGF, and bFGF in tumor angiogenesis, lung colonization, and spontaneous metastasis were assessed in mice treated with neutralizing antibody. The melanoma lines expressed multiple angiogenic factors, and each line showed a unique expression pattern. Multiple angiogenic factors promoted angiogenesis in the most angiogenic melanoma lines, whereas angiogenesis in the least angiogenic melanoma lines was possibly promoted solely by VEGF. Tumor growth, lung colonization, and spontaneous metastasis were controlled by the rate of angiogenesis and hence by the angiogenic factors promoting the angiogenesis. Lung colonization and spontaneous metastasis in A-07 were inhibited by treatment with neutralizing antibody against VEGF, IL-8, PD-ECGF, or bFGF. Each of these angiogenic factors may promote metastasis in melanoma, because inhibition of one of them could not be compensated for by the others.

When combined with αFAP-PE38, LV-3Ag exhibited greatly enhanced antitumor effects on tumor growth in an established B16 melanoma model. The mechanism of action underlying this combination treatment likely modulates the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment and, consequently, activates cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells capable of specifically recognizing and destroying tumor cells.

Therefore, we investigated the role of osteopontin in the experimental metastasis of tumor cells using recently established osteopontin-deficient mice.

Through this route, the number of lung tumors formed was higher than in the intracardiac route and was again less in osteopontin-deficient mice compared with wild-type mice. In conclusion, in an experimental metastasis assay, the number of tumors found in bone (after intracardiac injection) and lung (after left femoral vein injection) was significantly reduced in osteopontin-deficient mice compared with wild-type mice.

We have previously characterized tumor-associated alpha 2-M synthesized and secreted by human tumor cell lines. Of the cell lines studied, the melanoma cell line HMB-2 produced the largest amount of this glycoprotein. Immunofluorescence staining of cultured HMB-2 cells suggested that the cell population is heterogeneous with respect to alpha 2-M production. We have now isolated clones from the parental HMB-2 cells and characterized eight representative ones in detail. They varied considerably in the quantity of alpha 2-M secreted, from 4.2 to 46.5% of total protein. No relationship between the production of alpha 2-M by these clones and their pigmentation or tumorigenicity in nude mice was found. However, statistically there was a strong correlation between the modal chromosome number and population doubling time (r2 = 0.88, P less than 0.001) and also between the modal chromosome number and alpha 2-M production (r2 = 0.73, P less than 0.01). The growth rate of the clones correlated with the level of alpha 2-M in culture medium (r2 = 0.69, P less than 0.01). Clones with lower alpha 2-M production had a proportionally shorter population doubling time than the clones with intermediate or high production. Northern hybridization indicated quantitative variation in the alpha 2-M mRNA expressed by the parental cells and the clones, that was comparable but not identical with the quantity of alpha 2-M in the respective culture media; both parental cells and clones expressed platelet-derived growth factor A-chain mRNAs with little difference in levels. Serum-free medium from low alpha 2-M producer clones stimulated normal stationary fibroblasts significantly more than clones producing intermediate or high amounts of alpha 2-M. alpha 2-M decreased and anti-alpha 2-M IgG increased the stimulation. These results suggest that production of tumor-associated alpha 2-M is related to both autocrine and paracrine growth-stimulating activity of the tumor cells.",

This review summarizes recent findings regarding the expression, structure and function of proteolytic enzymes at or near the cell surface in cell-cell and cell-stroma interactions during melanoma progression. Cell-surface (membrane) peptidases are a multi-functional group of ectoenzymes that have been implicated in the control of growth and differentiation of many cellular systems. The potential, but yet speculative, role of other membrane-bound molecules, such as multifunctional surface proteins with adhesion and protease activity (ADAM gene family) or the ephrin/Eph receptor protein kinases in the pathogenesis of melanoma are discussed.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The cytotoxic activity of NK cells is regulated by class I MHC proteins. Although much has been learned about NK recognition of class I autologous targets, the mechanisms of NK self-tolerance are poorly understood. To examine the role of a nonpolymorphic, ubiquitously expressed class Ib Ag, Q9, we expressed it on class I-deficient and NK-sensitive B78H1 melanoma. Presence of this Qa-2 family member on tumor cells partially protected targets from lysis by bulk lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. H-2K(b)-expressing B78H1 targets also reduced LAK cell activity, while H-2D(b) offered no protection. Importantly, blocking with F(ab')(2) specific for Q9 or removal of this GPI-attached molecule by phospholipase C cleavage restored killing to the level of vector-transfected cells. Experiments with LAK cells derived from H2(b) SCID and B6 mice established that NK1.1(+)TCR(-) NK and NK1.1(+)TCR(+) LAK cells were the prevalent cytolytic populations inhibitable by Q9. Treatment of mice with poly(I:C) also resulted in generation of Q9-regulated splenic cytotoxicity. LAK cells from different mouse strains responded to Q9, suggesting that the protective effect of this molecule is not detectably influenced by Ly49 polymorphisms or the presence/absence of Q9 in NK-harboring hosts. We propose that Q9 expressed on melanoma cells serves as a ligand for yet unidentified NK inhibitory receptor(s) expressed on NK1.1(+) NK/T cells.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Early in cancer development, tumour cells express vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a secreted molecule that is important in all stages of angiogenesis, an essential process that provides nutrients and oxygen to the nascent tumor and thereby enhances tumor-cell survival and facilitates growth. Survivin, another protein involved in angiogenesis, is strongly expressed in most human cancers, where it promotes tumor survival by reducing apoptosis as well as favoring endothelial cell proliferation and migration. The mechanisms by which cancer cells induce VEGF expression and angiogenesis upon survivin up-regulation remain to be fully established. Since the PI3K/Akt signalling and β-catenin-Tcf/Lef dependent transcription have been implicated in the expression of many cancer-related genes, including survivin and VEGF, we evaluated whether survivin may favor VEGF expression, release from tumor cells and induction of angiogenesis in a PI3K/Akt-β-catenin-Tcf/Lef-dependent manner. Here, we provide evidence linking survivin expression in tumor cells to increased β-catenin protein levels, β-catenin-Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity and expression of several target genes of this pathway, including survivin and VEGF, which accumulates in the culture medium. Alternatively, survivin downregulation reduced β-catenin protein levels and β-catenin-Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity. Also, using inhibitors of PI3K and the expression of dominant negative Akt, we show that survivin acts upstream in an amplification loop to promote VEGF expression. Moreover, survivin knock-down in B16F10 murine melanoma cells diminished the number of blood vessels and reduced VEGF expression in tumors formed in C57BL/6 mice. Finally, in the chick chorioallantoid membrane assay, survivin expression in tumor cells enhanced VEGF liberation and blood vessel formation. Importantly, the presence of neutralizing anti-VEGF antibodies precluded survivin-enhanced angiogenesis in this assay. These findings provide evidence for the existance of a posititve feedback loop connecting survivin expression in tumor cells to PI3K/Akt enhanced β-catenin-Tcf/Lef-dependent transcription followed by secretion of VEGF and angiogenesis.

Mechanistically, CD80 mediates its effects through its extracellular domain, which blocks the cell surface expression of PDL1 but does not prevent intracellular expression of PDL1 protein.

In the present study, a melanoma library was screened by SEREX (serological analysis of cDNA expression libraries), and 43 genes were isolated, 2 of which, NY-MEL-1 and NY-MEL-3, encode novel gene products with differential tissue expression. NY-MEL-1 encodes a new rab GTP-binding protein, rab38. Among >40 rab proteins, rab38 has a unique COOH terminus which would allow posttranslational farnesylation and palmitoylation, lipid modifications normally occurring in ras proteins but not in other rab proteins. It is also the only rab gene showing a predominant mRNA expression in melanocytes, a cell-specific expression pattern likely related to melanosomal transport and docking. Northern blot analysis showed no detectable expression in other normal tissues. Consistent with this lineage specificity, rab38 mRNA is expressed in 80-90% of melanoma (17 of 19), but rarely in nonmelanocytic malignancies (1 of 16). The second novel gene isolated, NY-MEL-3, encodes a mitotic protein highly homologous to the Xenopus chromosome condensation protein XCAP-G, designated hCAP-G. Analysis of hCAP-G mRNA expression showed highest expression in the testis among normal tissues and variable expression in tumor cells, reflecting the proliferative activity in these cells. This mitosis-related expression suggests hCAP-G as a possible proliferation marker and a potential prognostic indicator in cancer.

It is the leading cause of skin cancer deaths with a median overall survival for advanced-stage metastatic disease of <6 months. Despite advances in the field with conventional and targeted therapies, the heterogeneity of melanoma poses the greatest ongoing challenge, ultimately leading to relapse and progression to a more drug-resistant tumor in most patients. Particularly noteworthy are recent findings, indicating that these therapies exert selective pressure on tumors resulting in the activation of pathways associated with cancer stem cells that are unresponsive to current therapy. Our previous studies have shown how Nodal, an embryonic morphogen of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, is one of these critical factors that is reactivated in aggressive melanoma and resistant to conventional chemotherapy, such as dacarbazine. In the current study, we sought to determine whether BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) therapy targeted Nodal-expressing tumor cells in uniquely matched unresectable stage III and IV melanoma patient samples before and after therapy that preceded their eventual death due to disease. The results demonstrate that BRAFi treatment failed to affect Nodal levels in melanoma tissues. Accompanying experiments in soft agar and in nude mice showed the advantage of using combinatorial treatment with BRAFi plus anti-Nodal monoclonal antibody to suppress tumor growth and metastasis. These data provide a promising new approach using front-line therapy combined with targeting a cancer stem cell-associated molecule-producing a more efficacious response than monotherapy.Laboratory Investigation advance online publication, 24 October 2016; doi:10.1038/labinvest.2016.107.",

The production of DNA crosslinks by MLN was determined by the recently described ethidium bromide fluorescence assay [De Jong et al., Int. J. Cancer 37, 557 (1986)]. A direct correlation between the percentage of DNA crosslinks (Ct) and cytotoxicity of melphalan has not been previously reported utilizing the fluorescence assay.

The concentrations of MLN necessary to reduce colony growth to 37% of control and 10% of control were 6.7 microM (EC37) and 26 microM (EC10) respectively. Utilizing the ethidium bromide fluorescence assay (EFA), the relationship between MLN concentration (x axis) and DNA crosslinks expressed as Ct (y axis) was best described by a power curve (y = 0.28 x 0.81; r = 0.985). The respective Ct values at the EC37 and EC10 of MLN were 1.3 and 3.8%.
