The pathway and prognosis of strong pigmentation of melanoma metastases in the SN is unclear. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of pigmentation and growth pattern of metastases in the SN with respect to survival. A total of 389 patients underwent an SN procedure (1997-2011). Ninety-five patients had a positive SN and material from 75 patients was available for review. The median follow-up time was 75 months (range 6-164). Pigmentation was scored from 0 to 2 using the following scale: 0=absent, 1=slight, and 2=strong. Growth pattern was scored as either eccentric (1) or infiltrative (2). SN tumor burden was measured according to the Rotterdam criteria. The primary melanoma had a median Breslow thickness of 2.90 mm (0.8-12.00 mm). Ulceration was present in 34 patients (45.3%). There was a median SN tumor burden of 0.5 mm (0.05-7.00 mm). In a total of 75 patients, 59 patients (79%) had no pigmentation, 13 patients (17%) had slight pigmentation, and three patients (4%) had strong pigmentation in the SN. Because of the small numbers, the classification was modified to either absent 59 (79%) or present 16 (21%) pigmentation, respectively. The SN tumor burden was significantly higher (P=0.031) for patients with pigmentation. Patients with pigmentation had a 5-year melanoma-specific survival (MSS) of 47% and a 10-year MSS of 33%. Patients without pigmentation had a 5-year MSS of 70% and a 10-year MSS of 59% (P=0.06). There was no difference in MSS for patients with an eccentric or an infiltrative growth pattern, nor did it correlate with other prognostic factors. Multivariate analysis for MSS showed five significant factors associated with worse prognosis: male sex (P=0.036), nodular melanoma (P=0.001), truncal site (P=0.0001), SN tumor burden more than 1.0 mm (P=0.022), and positive completion lymph node dissection (P=0.004). The 5-year MSS for SN tumor burden is 94% for 0.1 mm or less, 66% for 0.1-1.0 mm, and 41% for more than >1.0 mm (P<0.001). The 10-year MSS for SN tumor burden is, respectively, 94, 51, and 35% (P<0.001).

(2) Mitotic rate replaces level of invasion as a primary criterion for defining T1b melanomas.

Our previous works have shown that IL-10 and IFNγ co-regulate indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)-expressing immunosuppressive dendritic cells (DCs) in melanoma SLNs. The goal of this study is to examine the relationship between melanoma SLN tumor burden and the degree of SLN immune dysfunction as a model to study tumor-induced immune dysfunction. We hypothesize that SLN tumor burden correlates with the degree of SLN immune dysfunction.;Patients undergoing SLN biopsy for clinical stages I and II melanomas were enrolled in the study under an IRB-approved protocol. During the SLN biopsy, non-hot and non-blue portion of the SLN was harvested, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and mRNA was extracted. By using quantitative real-time PCR, gene expressions of cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, IFNγ, TGFβ, GM-CSF) and the surrogates of immunosuppressive regulatory and effector cells (IDO-expressing DCs and Foxp3-expressing T-regs, respectively) were measured and correlated against the SLN tumor burden (MART1) and against each other. The data were log transformed for normalization. Statistical test used Student's t-test and stepwise multivariate regression analysis. Statistical significance was determined at P < 0.05.;SLNs of 74 patients were analyzed in this analysis. Ten of seventy-four patients (13.5%) had tumor-positive SLNs. MART1 gene expression showed a significant difference between the SLN (+) and SLN (-) groups (P = 0.04). Among the various cytokines, multivariate analysis showed that only IFNγ gene expression correlated independently with MART1 gene expression (P < 0.0001, r = 0.91). Similar multivariate analyses show that IFNγ (P < 0.0001, r = 0.78), IL-10 (P = 0.0037, r = 0.60), and TGFβ (P < 0.0001, r = 0.95) gene expressions correlated independently with IDO gene expression. IFNγ (P < 0.0001, r = 0.87) and GM-CSF (P = 0.042, r = 0.76) gene expressions correlated independently with Foxp3 gene expression. MART1 gene expression showed independent correlation with IDO (P = 0.0002, r = 0.75) and Foxp3 (P = 0.0002, r = 0.75) gene expressions.;SLN tumor burden correlates with immunosuppressive IDO and Foxp3 expressions within the SLNs of melanoma patients. Our data are consistent with our theory that melanoma induces expressions of specific cytokines, which in turn, stimulate immune suppressors within the SLN. This study also supports our previous finding that IL-10 and IFNγ co-regulate IDO within the SLN. In our data, IFNγ is the sole cytokine that correlates with the SLN tumor burden and seems to play a central role in tumor-induced immunological changes in the SLN immune microenvironment.",

This study examines the importance of quality of the surgical resection measured by the extent of lymph node dissection (quartile of the total number of lymph nodes removed) to determine if this factor is an important prognostic factor for survival.;We reviewed our computer-assisted database of more than 8,700 melanoma patients prospectively collected from 1971 through the present to identify patients who underwent lymph node dissection for stage III melanoma. We included only patients who had their nodal dissections performed at our institute. Patients who underwent sentinel lymph node dissection were excluded. These patients were then analyzed as a group and by individual lymphatic basins: cervical, axillary, and inguinal basins. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to examine the model that included tumor burden, thickness of the primary melanoma, gender, age, clinical status of the lymph nodes (palpable versus not palpable), and the primary site. The survival and recurrence rates were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model.;Five hundred forty-eight patients underwent regional lymph node dissections. Of these patients, 214 underwent axillary dissections, 181 inguinal dissections, and 153 cervical dissections. The extent of the nodal dissections was based on the quartile of nodes excised, ranging from 1 to 98 (mean +/- SD = 25.8 +/- 15.8). Patients were stratified by tumor burden and quartile of number of lymph nodes removed. The overall 5-year survival of patients with four or more lymph nodes having tumor and the highest quartile of lymph nodes removed was 44% and was 23% for the lowest quartile of total lymph nodes excised (p = 0.05). By univariate analysis, tumor burden (p = 0.0001), quartile of total lymph nodes removed (p = 0.043), and primary site (p = 0.047) were statistically significant for predicting overall survival. Gender, clinical status of the nodes, primary tumor thickness, age, and dissected basin were not significant (p > 0.05). By multivariate analysis only the tumor burden (p = 0.0001) and quartile of lymph nodes resected (p = 0.044) were statistically significant.;The extent of lymph node dissection for melanoma when analyzed by quartiles is an independent factor in overall survival.

An inverse correlation between IL-6 levels and sEGF-R was observed (r =-0.33; P = 0.040). No relationship between sEGF-R and time to progression or overall survival was observed while circulating IL-6 was found as a predictive factor of survival.

The antigen was measured in a double determinant enzyme immunoassay (DDEIA) using NKI/C-3 as catcher antibody. Results from in vitro experiments indicated that the antigen is actively shed from living cells. In sera from melanoma patients with a small tumor burden, the antigen concentrations were in the range of those of controls (0-22 U/ml).

The antigen concentrations in sera from patients with multiple metastases of other tumors were within the range of controls. Several sera from patients with multiple metastases of colon, pancreatic, and stomach carcinoma, however, contained increased antigen concentrations (45-80 U/ml). These results correspond with the reactions of NKI/C-3 in tissue sections of some malignancies other than melanoma. During the follow-up of melanoma patients the concentrations of circulating antigen correlated with tumor progression. The predictive value of the NKI/C-3 assay was no better than determination of serum lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase or gamma glutamyl transferase activity.",

We have developed and characterized an accurate, sensitive, and reproducible bioluminescent B16 melanoma model that allows for serial, real-time analyses of tumor burden in live mice. We demonstrate that this model is applicable to subcutaneous tumors, lung metastases, and intracranial tumors and offers a solution to many of the limitations of previous models. As proof of principle, we use this model to show the efficacy of a live, Listeria monocytogenes vaccine expressing the melanoma antigen tyrosinase-related protein-2 to protect mice against intravenous B16 melanoma challenge. Additionally, we extend our approach to include the human A375 melanoma model and are able to show in vivo differences between sub-lines with varying metastatic potential.

Six tissue samples from metastatic lesions of six different patients were stained with the same antibodies by immunohistochemistry.

So far, almost without exception, clinical trials conducted with single or multiple agent chemotherapy, biological therapy (interferon-alpha, interleukin-2), and biochemotherapy have failed to demonstrate consistent survival benefit. Without effective alternate treatments, surgery must be considered the primary treatment of melanoma, independent of disease stage. Although surgery is clearly favored as the treatment of localized melanoma, consensus opinion and clinician preference become divided once melanoma progresses beyond its primary site. Many physicians will adopt an attitude of resignation and hesitancy when treating metastatic melanoma. As a result, patients with advanced disease are often treated with medications that produce little survival or palliative benefit at the expense of significant toxicity. Numerous studies have demonstrated clear and durable survival advantages for patients undergoing complete resection of metastatic melanoma.

In addition, these matured DC demonstrated enhanced ability to stimulate antigen specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in vitro. In a protection model, C57BL/6 mice vaccinated with either antigen-pulsed immature or CpG matured DC were unable to reject a lethal B16 melanoma challenge. In contrast, long-term protection was achieved in mice vaccinated with both CpG and antigen-pulsed DC, which correlated with an enhanced antigen specific T cell immune response. In a therapeutic model of established subcutaneous B16 melanoma, C57BL/6 mice treated intratumorally with CpG and B16 lysate-pulsed DC demonstrated a reduced tumor burden and prolonged survival. In a similar model of established subcutaneous tumor, mice treated with CpG-matured DC pulsed with a melanoma peptide, TRP-2, alone were unable to achieve tumor regression. Conversely, mice that received the combined vaccine of CpG and peptide-pulsed DC displayed a reduced tumor burden.

The antigen is also expressed by tumor cells in vivo. Melanoma and nevus cells, but not normal melanocytes, were specifically stained by the immunoperoxidase procedure. The proteoglycan antigen, purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using a monoclonal antibody that specifically detects this antigen, was used to immunize rabbits. The resulting serum was tested by sequential immunoprecipitation and found to react with the same population of molecules detected by the anti-proteoglycan monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, the reactivity patterns of the rabbit serum and of the monoclonal antibodies with a variety of tumor and normal cells were the same. Based on the these data, we conclude that the entire proteoglycan molecule is a melanoma-associated antigen. The monoclonal antibodies and immunoglobulin from the rabbit serum were tested in a double determinant immunoassay for the detection of antigen in a total of 339 sera from patients with various diseases. Elevated levels of circulating proteoglycan antigen were found in 76% of patients with a high metastatic melanoma tumor burden compared to 2% of healthy donors.

To evaluate whether serum IL-6 is a useful disease marker in metastatic malignant melanoma (MMM), we studied the time course of endogenous IL-6 secretion in 41 patients treated with cisplatinum, IL-2, and IFN-alpha. Furthermore, the relationship of endogenous IL-6 concentrations to the tumor burden and/or the clinical response was also evaluated. The baseline serum IL-6 levels were significantly higher in patients with MMM than in the control group (P = 0.002). When tumor burden was taken into consideration, we found that IL-6 levels were higher in patients with high tumor burden than in patients with low tumor burden. During treatment in the whole patient population, a higher serum IL-6 level was observed in nonresponding as compared to responding patients at days 7 (P = 0.0005), 21 (P = 0.002), and 35 (P = 0.009). The follow-up of serum IL-6 in patients with MMM according to the tumor burden and clinical response demonstrated that: (a) IL-6 levels were significantly higher at days 7 and 21 in patients with high tumor burden as compared to those with low tumor burden; and (b) IL-6 levels remain significantly higher in nonresponding patients as compared to responding patients regardless of the tumor burden. From these results, we can conclude that endogenous IL-6 may play a role in the failure of IL-2 therapy in such patients, since the very early IL-6 increase is correlated with the tumor mass and nonresponse to biochemotherapy. Therefore, it seems that the early detection of endogenous IL-6 may represent valuable information for monitoring the response to biochemotherapy in patients with MMM.",

Melanoma is the third most frequent cancer histology and consequently comprises a significant portion of brain metastasis patients. Unlike the more frequent lung and breast cancers, melanoma represents a particularly challenging entity because of its radioresistant nature. Stereotactic radiosurgery appears to overcome the inherent radioresistance of brain metastasis from melanoma and, thereby, affords a high rate of local tumor control. Reports from leading centers indicate a favorable benefit to risk profile for radiosurgery in melanoma patients. Local tumor control after radiosurgery generally exceeds 80%, and neurological complications as a result of radiosurgery are infrequent. A higher performance status and lower intracranial tumor burden in melanoma patients at the time of radiosurgery are associated with longer survival. Radiosurgery may be used in conjunction upfront with radiotherapy, resection, and chemotherapy or as a salvage therapy in selected melanoma patients. Careful radiological and neurological follow-up is required to assess local tumor control and distant intracranial disease progression. Further clinical studies will be required to better define the role of upfront and salvage radiosurgery in selected cohorts of patients with brain metastasis from melanoma.

Female B6D2F1 mice injected via the tail vein with murine B16F10 melanoma developed lung metastases within ~10 days. In the first experiment, the prevention of lung metastasis was assessed in the model treated with either vehicle, MK-0429 at 100 and 300 mg/kg orally twice daily or cyclophosphamide at 300 mg/kg, i.p. once daily. Study endpoints included determination of the study time period to achieve metastasis in lungs in this model, evaluation of the health effects on the study animals, the total number of lung colonies identified and lung tumor area. Unlike cyclophosphamide, the MK-0429 treatment did not lead to a significant weight reduction in mice. MK-0429 at 100 and 300 mg/kg reduced the number of metastatic tumor colonies by 64 and 57%, respectively, and the high dose also reduced the tumor area by 60% as compared to the vehicle. The second experiment employed B16F10 luciferase-expressing cells to examine the de novo progression of melanoma metastasis over 15 days with bioluminescent imaging of mice treated with MK-0429 at 300 mg/kg as compared to the vehicle.

However, MK-0429 reduced the progression of ventral and dorsal lung metastases by 22 and 38%, respectively, as compared to the vehicle, by study completion. Quantification of ex vivo tumor burden showed a 30-40% reduction in lung colonies by MK-0429.

Unlike in the case of the lymph nodes, peripheral blood or bone marrow do not contain melanocytes excluding the possibility of fals positive reactions. Considering the pronounced heterogeneity of melanoma cells the most reliable molecular marker is the expression of tyrosinase. Several studies indicate that the quantity of circulating melanoma cells correlates with tumor burden and disease progression and reflects the effect of therapy. On the other hand, molecular techniques detect circulating melanoma cells much more frequently than the clinical manifestation of the disease progression (molecular recurrence), questioning the clinical significance of the detection of a small number of melanoma cells in the circulation.

Clinicopathologic factors, including extent of microscopic disease within SLNs, were evaluated as potential predictors of positive non-SLNs.;Overall, 359 (16.3%) of the 2,203 patients identified had a positive SLN. Positive non-SLNs were identified in 48 (14.0%) of the 343 patients with positive SLNs who underwent cTLND. On univariate analysis, several measures of SLN microscopic tumor burden, one versus three or more SLNs harvested, tumor thickness more than 2 mm, age older than 50 years, and Clark level higher than III were predictive of positive non-SLNs; primary tumor ulceration and number of positive SLNs had no apparent impact. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, measures of SLN microscopic tumor burden were the most significant independent predictors of positive non-SLNs; tumor thickness more than 2 mm and number of SLNs harvested also predicted additional disease. A model was developed that stratified patients according to their risk for non-SLN involvement.;In melanoma patients with positive SLNs, SLN tumor burden, primary tumor thickness, and number of SLNs harvested may be useful in identifying a group at low risk for positive non-SLNs and be spared the potential morbidity of a cTLND.",

On the basis of previous expression studies, we aimed to trace melanoma cells in the blood of melanoma patients by RT-PCR of melanoma-inhibitory activity (MIA) mRNA. To detect sensitively MIA transcripts in total RNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we established a sensitive PCR-ELISA system. With this assay, we detected one melanoma cell in 2 ml of blood by a single round of 32 PCR cycles. A total of 295 PBMC samples isolated from 166 patients with melanocytic tumors were tested with the MIA RT-PCR-ELISA: (a) 58 patients (99 samples) with malignant melanomas in stage I; (b) 49 patients (65 samples) with malignant melanomas in stage II; and (c) 47 patients (116 samples) with metastasized melanomas (stages III and IV), with an additional 12 patients (15 samples) with benign melanocytic nevi. Forty-four (26.8%) of 164 samples isolated from patients with melanomas in stages I and II were positive for MIA mRNA; in stages III/IV, 33 (28.4%) of 116 samples of patients, irrespective of clinically evident disease, were positive. Eleven (84.6%) of 13 PBMC samples from patients with metastasized melanoma and clinically evident disease without treatment were MIA mRNA-positive in contrast to only 19 (25.7%) of 74 samples isolated from patients in stage IV with metastasis during chemotherapy. Furthermore, none of the 16 PBMC samples of patients in stage IV without clinically detectable metastases at that time point during chemotherapy was MIA mRNA-positive. Interestingly, of the 44 positive samples (26.8%) isolated from patients with melanomas in stages I and II, 20 were still positive when retested after complete excision of the tumor. Our results reveal that amplification of MIA mRNA from the PBMCs of patients with malignant melanomas by PCR-ELISA provides a useful means to detect tumor cells in the systemic blood circulation. A correlation between positive blood samples and tumor burden in stages III and IV was detected, and, in addition, a significant effect of chemotherapy with respect to the reduction of the number of systemically spread tumor cells was observed. However, MIA amplification seems to be of little value as a surrogate marker for clinical staging or the detection of metastatic disease.",

Previously we have shown that Coxsackievirus A21 (CVA21) lytically infects in vitro cultures of malignant melanoma cells and is efficient at reducing the tumor burden of mice bearing slow-growing SK-Mel-28 melanoma xenografts. The oncolytic activity of CVA21 against in vivo melanoma xenografts, which possess rapid growth rates and more extensive vascular structure than SK-Mel-28 xenografts warrants further investigation. In the present study we evaluated the oncolytic action of CVA21 against rapidly growing melanoma xenografts (ME4405) which exhibit a highly vascular phenotype. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that in vitro cultures of ME4405 cells expressed comparable levels of the CVA21 cellular receptors, ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecules-1) and DAF (decay accelerating factor) to SK-Mel-28 cells. Despite similar levels of CVA21 receptor expression, SK-Mel-28 cells appear to be more susceptible to viral lysis than ME4405 cells, even though the kinetics of virus replication in both lines was comparable. Intratumoral, intraperitoneal or intravenous administration of CVA21 were equally effective in reducing the tumor volume of ME4405 xenografts in immunodeficient mice, and provides further evidence for the use of CVA21 as a novel oncolytic agent against varying phenotypes of malignant melanoma.",

In this context of limited response to single target agents, novel candidate molecules capable of effectively inducing tumor inhibition along with targeting multiple critical nodes of melanoma signaling assume translational significance. In this regard, we investigated the anti-cancer effects of a novel dichlorophenyl urea compound called COH-SR4 in melanoma. The SR4 treatment decreased the survival and inhibited the clonogenic potential of melanomas along with inducing apoptosis in vitro cultures. SR4 treatments lead to inhibition of GST activity along with causing G2/M phase cell cycle arrest. Oral administration of 4 mg/kg SR4 leads to effective inhibition of tumor burdens in both syngeneic and nude mouse models of melanoma. The SR4 treatment was well tolerated and no overt toxicity was observed. The histopathological examination of resected tumor sections revealed decreased blood vessels, decrease in the levels of angiogenesis marker, CD31, and proliferation marker, Ki67, along with an increase in pAMPK levels. Western blot analyses of resected tumor lysates revealed increased PARP cleavage, Bim, pAMPK along with decreased pAkt, vimentin, fibronectin, CDK4 and cyclin B1.

This major collaborative study of predicting melanoma outcome was conducted specifically for this project, and the results were used to finalize the criteria for this evidence-based staging system. In fact, this was the largest prognostic factors analysis of prospectively followed melanoma patients ever conducted. Important results that shaped the staging criteria involved both the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) criteria and stage grouping for all four stages of melanoma. Major changes in the staging include: (1) melanoma thickness and ulceration are the dominant predictors of survival in patients with localized melanoma (Stages I and II); deeper level of invasion (ie, IV and V) was independently associated with reduced survival only in patients with thin or T1 melanomas. (2) The number of metastatic lymph nodes and the tumor burden were the most dominant predictors of survival in patients with Stage III melanoma; patients with metastatic nodes detected by palpation had a shorter survival compared with patients whose nodal metastases were first detected by sentinel node excision of clinically occult or \"microscopic\" metastases. (3) The site of distant metastases (nonvisceral versus lung versus all other visceral metastatic sites) and the presence of elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were the dominant predictors of outcome in patients with Stage IV or distant metastases. (4) An upstaging was implemented for all patients with Stage I, II, and III disease when a primary melanoma is ulcerated by histopathological criteria.

Tyrosinase-related protein 2 (TRP-2) is a melanogenic enzyme expressed by both melanocytes and melanomas that is reported to be a candidate melanoma rejection antigen. To study the role of self-reactive CD8+ T cells in tumor immunity and autoimmunity, we generated mice that bear a T-cell receptor transgene (TCR Tg) specific for the TRP-2(180-188) epitope. TRP-2 TCR Tg mice did not spontaneously develop depigmentation despite systemic expression of TRP-2 in the skin. Peripheral T cells from these TCR Tg mice exhibited a naive phenotype and proliferated in response to TRP-2 in vitro. In addition, transfer of in vitro-activated Tg T cells reduced B16 pulmonary tumor burden, but not subcutaneous tumors. We next sought to determine the in vivo responses of the Tg T cells to endogenous and tumor-derived TRP-2. Adoptive transfer of naive TCR Tg T cells into wild-type C57BL/6 mice, in combination with a TRP-2-pulsed dendritic cell vaccine, induced proliferation of the Tg T cells and resulted in migration of the Tg T cells into a subcutaneous B16 melanoma tumor. Although these tumor-infiltrating Tg T cells remained reactive against TRP-2, they did not reduce growth of the primary subcutaneous tumor; similarly, these in vivo-primed effector cells had no significant effect on the growth of pulmonary nodules. These data demonstrate that despite in vivo priming, tumor-infiltrating T cells may fail to reduce tumor burden. Determining the basis for the inability of the tumor microenvironment to sustain effective antitumor responses will be critical for designing newer, more potent antitumor immunotherapies.",

The results of these latter studies in 51 patients with Stage III (distantly metastatic) melanoma and in five patients with earlier stages of disease indicate that: (1) when the interval from primary therapy to recurrence is greater than one year and when liver, bone and brain are not involved, partial or total clinical regression may be noted in up to 25% of patients with metastatic disease receiving immunochemotherapy; (2) when total regression does occur, the effect usually lasts from one to three years; (3) cytoreductive (debulking) surgery, when possible, in cutaneous, nodal retroperitoneal, and visceral regions may enhance the response to specific active immunochemotherapy, although some debulked patients had less tumor burden and this factor alone may lead to an improved prognosis in patients undergoing any subsequent treatment; (4) when circulating inhibitory factors are modified through preimmunization chemotherapy, an enhanced host response may be seen; and (5) Cancer Serum Indices (CSI) may be useful in predicting recurrence and in following tumor load and response to therapy.

The following phenothiazines were evaluated: perphenazine, fluphenazine, thioridazine trifluoperazine and chlorpromazine. All agents induced a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability in wild-type and in MDR B16 melanoma cells. Thioridazine displayed the highest antiproliferative activity. Flow cytometric analyses of 24-h treated B16 melanoma cells revealed an increase in fragmented DNA (16.3 vs 71.3% and 87.2% in controls, 25 microM and 50 microM thioridazine-treated, respectively). Apoptosis was confirmed by co-staining of thioridazine-treated B16 cells (12.5 microM) with propidium iodide and Hoechst 33342 reagents. Caspase-3 expression, a typical mediator of apoptosis, was markedly increased following a 4-h exposure of B16 cells to thioridazine (25 microM and 50 microM). This increase could be blocked by a specific caspase-3 inhibitor. In vivo studies were performed using female C57/Bl mice. Animals were inoculated with wild-type B16 cells by i.v. injection into the tail vein. Mice were treated with thioridazine (10 and 15 mg/kg x3/week i.p. or 15, and 25 mg/kg/day p.o.) and control animals received saline. Mice were monitored for 21-30 days. Body weight was recorded. After autopsy, the lung weight and number of pulmonary melanoma colonies were determined. Thioridazine administration (i.p. or p.o.) resulted in the reduction of lung tumor burden and an increase in mice survival.

Patients with positive SLNB results are currently offered completion lymph node dissection (CLND) of the affected lymph node basin. This procedure entails considerable morbidity and is often applied to patients with shortened life expectancies. Because 80% of CLNDs yield no additional positive nodes and there is no proof that CLND leads to survival improvement, criteria are needed to limit this procedure to those most likely to harbor nonsentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases.;A retrospective review of 349 cases of melanoma from January 1999 to April 2007 that underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy at a single institution was done. Statistical analysis was used to compare two subgroups of patients: a positive CLND group and a negative CLND group. These two groups were compared with regards to multiple variables related to patient demographics, primary tumor characteristics, and SLN tumor burden.;Age and total size of SLN tumor deposit were the factors with the strongest correlation with CLND positivity. By applying a risk score model that uses the cutoff values of age 55 y and SLN tumor deposit of 5 mm, it is possible to predict CLND positivity in SLN-positive melanoma patients.;The likelihood of CLND positivity in SLN-positive melanoma patients can be predicted from two criteria readily available: size of SLN tumor deposit and patient age.",

We evaluated the therapeutic effect of each vector alone and in combination for efficacy in C57BL/6 mice with preestablished (2 d) B16 melanoma-derived pulmonary metastases, using the number of lung metastases as the efficacy parameter. Intraperitoneal administration of Adgp75 (10(8) PFU) reduced tumor burden to 45 +/- 7% of controls (P < 0.01), and AdIL12 administration (10(8) PFU, intraperitoneally) reduced the number of metastases to 43 +/- 7% of controls (P < 0.01). The combination of Adgp75 (10(8) PFU, intraperitoneally) and AdIL12 (10(8) PFU, intraperitoneally) provided further protection (15 +/- 3%; P < 0.01 as compared with naive control; P < 0.01 compared with Adgp75 or AdIL12 alone). Mice receiving AdIL12 showed increased natural killer cell (NK cell) function in an in vitro cytotoxicity assay, with a dose- dependent lysis of YAC-1 cells and, to a lesser extent, lysis of B16 cells. To assess the relative contribution of major histocompatibility complex I (MHC I) Dependent and Independent activity in combination therapy with Adgp75 plus AdIL12, we performed adoptive transfer experiments, using splenocytes from mice receiving Adgp75, AdIL12, or Adgp75 + AdIL12, from among which NK cells had been selectively depleted in vitro prior to adoptive transfer. Each group showed significant decreases in tumor burden resembling those with primary treatment. Interestingly, NK-cell depletion from among cells derived from the Adgp75- and AdIL12-treated mice significantly altered the therapeutic response (P < 0.01 compared with the Adgp75 + AdIL12 group), suggesting a significant role of NK-cell-mediated cytolysis in vivo, although there was still a significantly reduced tumor burden (P < 0.01 compared with that of naive controls). Collectively, these data support the concept that the combination of AdIL12 and Adgp75 provides additive effects against pulmonary metastases of B16 melanoma by MHC-independent (NK cell) means as well as MHC-dependent cytotoxic lymphocyte means, suggesting that this therapy may be a useful adjuvant in the treatment of metastatic melanoma.",

Cysteine proteases contribute to invasive properties of many cancer cell types. To analyze the contribution of cysteine proteases to metastasis we have over-expressed in B16 melanoma cells the natural cysteine protease inhibitor, cystatin C. We measured in vitro invasion of cystatin over-expression clones with Boyden chamber type assays. Tail-vein injections of cells were used to compare lung tumor colonization. Subcutaneous tumor growth and tumor cell metastasis from primary tumors were also analyzed. Apoptosis of tumor cells was measured in lung tissues following melanoma cell injection. RESULTS: Results show the in vitro invasion of cystatin C over-expressing cells was dramatically inhibited. Lung tumor colonization was also reduced. Increased tumor cell apoptosis was found to be an important factor and may be related to the reduced tumor burden noted in this system of melanoma metastasis. CONCLUSION: Cysteine proteases therefore, may be a target for future anti-metastatic therapies.",

They were characterized for Aldh1a1 activity, stem cell markers and migration and invasion in vitro. Their tumorigenicity in vivo was analyzed using xenografts and lung metastasis assays as well as in vivo imaging.;Depletion of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1a1 (Aldh1a1) impairs the pro-tumorigenic and pro-metastatic advantage of melanoma cells lacking AhR expression (sh-AhR).

However, Aldh1a1 downmodulation in AhR-expressing B16F10 cells did not significantly affect tumor growth in vivo.

Interestingly, Sox2 increased Aldh1a1 expression in sh-AhR but not in sh-AhR + sh-Aldh1a1 cells, suggesting that Aldh1a1 and Sox2 may be co-regulated in melanoma cells.

Melanoma-induced suppression of CTL expansion was correlated with upregulated apoptotic activity and hampered the induction of memory precursor effector cells. Adoptive transfer of resting LCMV antigen-specific T-cells before or after tumor establishment demonstrated that a critical period of in vivo exposure of resting T-cells to growing melanoma was responsible for the induction of suppressed expansion. This suppression was durable; surgical resection of melanoma after in vivo exposure to resting T-cells but before antigenic stimulation did not restore full expansion.;These data suggest that growing melanoma tumors exert a global, antigen-independent influence on resting T-cells that fundamentally reprograms their ability to undergo proliferative expansion in response to subsequent antigenic stimulation.

However, 50% of patients with deep (> 4 mm) primary melanomas, 60-85% of those with regional lymph node metastases (AJCC Stage III), and 95% of those with metastases to distant sites (AJCC Stage IV) will experience recurrence, which is associated with a dismal prognosis. Adjuvant therapy of melanoma assumes that treatment will be more effective when the tumor burden is small. In the 1970s and 1980s, randomized trials tested the efficacy of chemotherapy, nonspecific immunotherapy, levamisole, and regional perfusion therapy in patients with AJCC Stage II and III melanoma. Dacarbazine (DTIC) alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs or with nonspecific immunotherapy did not significantly improve disease free or overall survival. Of the four levamisole trials, only the study conducted by the National Cancer Institute of Canada revealed a reduction in recurrence and mortality; however, this reduction was not significant by multivariate analysis. The value of regional perfusion therapy following resection of high risk extremity melanomas is currently being determined by multiinstitutional studies conducted by the World Health Organization and the North American Perfusion Group. Multi-institutional trials also are examining the adjuvant role of interferon-alpha in patients with deep (> 3 mm) primary melanomas or positive regional lymph nodes; results should reveal its optimum dose and duration of treatment (3 x 10(6) U for > or = 2 years versus 10 x 10(6) U/m2 for 1 year, subcutaneously 3 times a week) and its impact on survival. A randomized trial of interferon-gamma undertaken by the Southwest Oncology Group was discontinued after interim analysis indicated an adverse effect.

T test, Chi-square test, and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed.;There were 16 patients who underwent surgical treatment (laparoscopic liver resection, n = 2 and laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation, n = 14), compared to 28 patients who received systemic therapy. The groups were similar regarding demographics and size of primary tumor. The interval between diagnoses of primary tumor and liver metastases was longer for the surgical group (58 vs 22 months, respectively, p = 0.010). Although the dominant liver tumor size was similar, the average number of liver tumors was 4 in the surgical group and 10 in the systemic therapy group (p < 0.0001). The median survival after diagnosis of liver metastases was 35 months in the surgical group and 15 months in the systemic therapy group (p ≤ 0.0001). Five-year survival was zero in the systemic therapy group and 22 % in the surgical group.;This study shows that surgical treatment of liver metastases in selected patients with uveal melanoma, who have limited liver tumor burden and a long interval to metastases development, may result in long-term survival.",

With newer reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR)-based assays, sensitivities reported are as high as identifying one cancer cell in a background of a million normal cells. Although this sensitivity is 100-times what the human eye can differentiate under the microscope, the new challenge becomes determining the relevance of this low-volume disease in the regional basin, in particular, the sentinel lymph node (SLN). Patients with melanomas greater than 0.75 mm in tumor thickness participated in a research study that examined their SLNs with routine histology, immunhistochemical staining and a RT-PCR assay based on the tyrosinase probe. A total of 311 patients were involved in the study and patients whose SLN were negative from all three assays for metastatic disease had a good survival, with a 92% disease-free survival (DFS) and a 97% overall survival (OS) regardless of the tumor thickness or the ulceration status of the primary melanoma. Patients upstaged with the RT-PCR assay had a significantly decreased DFS and OS compared with patients who were SLN negative. Patients who had enough tumor burden in the SLN that allowed their metastatic disease to be identified with routine histology had a 48% recurrence rate at 5 years. A recently published meta-analysis confirmed that molecular staging of the SLN in melanoma contains important prognostic information. Micrometastatic disease missed by routine histology in the SLN in melanoma patients is clinically relevant disease. Molecular staging has the potential of providing a more accurate staging in the SLN, for prognostication and directing adjuvant therapies.",

In a variety of small mammals, left pneumonectomy (PNX) initiates rapid compensatory hyperplasia of the remnant lung lobes restoring normal tissue mass, structure and function. Post-PNX compensatory lung growth is known to promote lung tumor formation in carcinogen-treated mice. The present study tests the hypothesis that PNX enhances experimental metastasis to lung. C57B1/6 mice subjected to PNX were given an intravenous injection of B16F10 melanoma cells at various stages of compensatory lung growth. Animals injected with B16F10 cells during the linear phase of the response had 77% to 260% more pulmonary metastases than mice subjected to thoracotomy (P < 0.01). Moreover, measurements of tumor area (mm2) revealed that PNX mice harbored a substantially larger lung tumor burden than control animals. Normalization of the tumor cell inoculum to lung mass yielded similar results. PNX had no effect on growth of sub-cutaneous B16F10 melanoma tumors, suggesting that experimental melanoma metastasis was enhanced by local alterations in the lung microenvironment. These results suggest (1) that PNX is a relevant model in which to investigate mechanisms of local cancer recurrence and, (2) melanoma cell metastatic potential is influenced, at least in part, by local factors modified during post-PNX compensatory lung growth.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The surgical management of melanoma has evolved over the last 100 years. when early concepts of lymphatic permeation of the tumors and metastases led surgeons to perform radical operative procedures. Wide excision of primary melanoma is now performed with 1- to 2-cm radial margins, significantly reducing the need for complex plastic closures, skin grafts. and hospital admissions. Although elective lymph node dissection remains controversial as a therapeutic procedure, the development of SL has improved the staging of the regional lymph nodes and diminished the morbidity of lymph node dissection. The role of SL for routine care of melanoma patients remains unknown. Metastasectomy, which is the surgical resection of distant metastases with tumor-free surgical margins, has not been popular for AJCC stage IV patients with multiple metastases, because surgery is considered a local therapy and therefore of little value for management of disseminated disease. Nevertheless, the many reports of long-term survival after resection of distant melanoma metastases to diverse soft tissue and organ sites clearly indicate that this form of cytoreductive surgery can be extremely successful in carefully selected patients. Unlike chemotherapy, complete surgical metastasectomy can rapidly render a patient disease-free with only a short period of postoperative morbidity. Most patients fully recover from the surgical procedure within 6 weeks, returning to most or all activities. The ability to select patients for surgery is based on the development of more sophisticated imaging techniques, which allow better preoperative differentiation of patients with single versus multiple metastases and improve the surgeon's ability to identify and resect multiple metastatic sites. The overall data suggest that patients whose metastases can be completely resected will experience improved overall survival and occasional long-term cure regardless of the metastatic organ site and number of metastases. We believe that increased understanding of the biology of the primary and metastases, dramatic improvement in the accuracy of staging metastatic disease, and better techniques of surgical resection provide the best chance for long-term palliation or cure of melanoma. Cytoreductive surgery should be considered a form of immunotherapy. The long-term clinical benefit of this therapy depends on the patient's immune response to, the surgical reduction in tumor burden: an immune response that controls subclinical micrometastases should optimize postoperative survival.",

In patients receiving BCG adjuvant therapy, 90 per cent with microscopic disease in one lymph node appeared free of disease as compared to 40 per cent with macroscopic disease in multiple nodes.

The majority of patients who undergo CLND are found to have histologically negative non-sentinel nodes, and yet are exposed to the potential morbidity of CLND, including infection, wound complications, and lymphedema. We do not yet know if there is a survival benefit from CLND that justifies its morbidity and we are currently unable to identify clinical and pathologic factors that may be associated with the likelihood of benefit from CLND. Controversy regarding the management of melanoma patients with a positive sentinel node highlights the need for continued investigation in melanoma biology, treatment, and outcomes. Patients with minimal tumor burden in their regional nodes would especially benefit from a better understanding of the appropriate management strategies. Ongoing clinical trials are aimed at determining whether CLND is superior to nodal observation and surveillance in patients with positive sentinel nodes, and at determining the outcome of patients with minimal disease in their sentinel node who forego CLND.

Patients undergoing current treatment with cytostatics (n = 18) revealed a strong increase in sMICB serum level (P < 0.0005), whereas treatment with IFN-α alone or combined with cytostatics (n = 19) showed no change in serum sMICB concentration. According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, elevated sMICB serum levels were associated with a poor overall and a progression-free survival. Multivariate analysis revealed sMICB serum concentration as an independent predictive factor for progression-free and overall survival. Our results show a prognostic relevance of serum sMICB in melanoma patients, indicating that the evaluation of sMICB serum level may be important for the selection of therapeutic strategies.",

Eighteen dogs had stable disease (n = 9; 36%) or progressive disease (9; 36%). Response to treatment was significantly associated with carboplatin dose on a milligram per kilogram basis (15.1 mg/kg 16.9 mg/lb] of body weight vs 12.6 mg/kg [5.7 mg/lb]). Evidence of gastrointestinal toxicosis could be assessed in 27 dogs. Mean body weight of 5 dogs that developed gastrointestinal toxicosis was significantly less than that of 22 dogs without gastrointestinal toxicosis (9.9 kg [21.8 lb] vs 19.3 kg [42.5 lb]).;Carboplatin had activity against macroscopic spontaneously occurring malignant melanomas in dogs and should be considered as an adjunctive treatment for microscopic local or metastatic tumors.

We have established an efficient method for extraction and reverse transcription of tyrosinase mRNA from paraffin sections that permits the close correlation of the RT-PCR results with (immuno)histologic findings in adjacent sections. One hundred fifty-three SLNs and 6 non-SLN specimens originating from 92 melanoma and 4 nonmelanoma patients were studied to test the reliability of this approach. The predictive value of positive RT-PCR results was 0.98 for the presence of melanoma or nevus cells; the corresponding negative predictive value was 0.83. Furthermore, the detection rate of tyrosinase mRNA significantly correlated with tumor burden. Among the 33 melanoma-positive SLNs without nevus cells, positive RT-PCR results were obtained in all specimens with extended peripheral (S2) or deeply invasive (S3) micrometastases but in only 46% of the cases with few localized melanoma cells in the subcapsular zone (S1). Routine (immuno)histologic evaluation alone had missed microclusters of melanoma cells in one SLN and small nevus cell aggregates in six other SLNs. They were detected only during microscopic reexamination caused by a positive RT-PCR result. We conclude that histology and immunohistochemistry remain the indispensable gold standard for the identification of melanoma and nevus cells in SLNs. Additional molecular analyses using adjacent paraffin sections may further improve the diagnostic accuracy by sensitizing and guiding the microscopist's attention.",

A weighted score Non-Sentinel Node Risk Score [N-SNORE] incorporating predictive factors was derived, and the efficacy of N-SNORE at stratifying risk of NSN involvement was studied.;Factors independently predictive of NSN positivity included primary tumor regression, proportion of harvested SNs involved by melanoma (%PosSN), sex (trend), and SN tumor burden indices (maximum size of largest deposit [MaxSize], % cross-sectional area of SN occupied by tumor, tumor penetrative depth, intranodal location of tumor) and perinodal lymphatic invasion (PLI). Of SN tumor burden criteria, MaxSize was the strongest predictor. N-SNORE was the sum of scores for five parameters: sex (female = 0, male = 1), regression (absent = 0, present = 2), %PosSN (absent = 0, present = 2), MaxSize (≤ 0.5 mm = 0, 0.51 to 2.00 mm = 1, 2.01 to 10.00 mm = 2, > 10.00 mm = 3), and PLI (absent = 0, present = 3).

We postulated that a recombinant interleukin 2/diphtheria toxin conjugate (DAB/IL2; Denileukin Diftitox; Ontak) may serve as a useful strategy to deplete Treg cells and break tolerance against neoplastic tumors in humans.;We administered DAB/IL2 (12 microg/kg; four daily doses; 21 day cycles) to 16 patients with metastatic melanoma and measured the effects on the peripheral blood concentration of several T cell subsets and on tumor burden.;We found that DAB/IL2 caused a transient depletion of Treg cells as well as total CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (< 21 days). T cell repopulation coincided with the de novo appearance of melanoma antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in several patients as determined by flow cytometry using tetrameric MART-1, tyrosinase and gp100 peptide/MHC conjugates. Sixteen patients received at least one cycle of DAB/IL2 and five of these patients experienced regressions of melanoma metastases as measured by CT and/or PET imaging. One patient experienced a near complete response with the regression of several hepatic and pulmonary metastases coupled to the de novo appearance of MART-1-specific CD8+ T cells. A single metastatic tumor remained in this patient and, after surgical resection, immunohistochemical analysis revealed MART1+ melanoma cells surrounded by CD8+ T cells.;Taken together, these data indicate that transient depletion of T cells in cancer patients may disrupt the homeostatic control of cognate immunity and allow for the expansion of effector T cells with specificity against neoplastic cells. Several T cell depleting agents are clinically available and this study provides strong rationale for an examination of their efficacy in cancer patients.;NCT00299689 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier).",

Median MART-1 and tyrosinase mRNA levels in SNs were significantly different in patients with metastasis compared with patients with BNIs (P < 0.05) and patients without melanocytic lesions (P < 0.001). However, a \"gray-zone\" was observed where distinction, based on mRNA levels, could not be made between the three groups.

However, in approximately one third of cases without RT-PCR evidence of MART-1 expression, extensive histopathologic SN investigation is not necessary, thus substantially reducing the cost of SN analysis.

SIII metastases, defined by a depth of invasion (d) greater than 1 mm below the capsular level, imply a risk of more than 50% for the presence of nonsentinel lymph node metastases in the same basin and for the emergence of distant metastases within 5 years of follow-up. Corresponding risks with SI metastases (d </= 0.3 mm) and SII metastases (0.3 mm < d </= 1 mm) do not exceed 15%. The survival curve for patients with SIII metastases approaches that of patients in the pre-SLNE era who underwent delayed lymph node dissection for subsequently detected nodal macrometastases. The survival of patients with initially removed SI and SII metastases is much better, similar to that of patients with S0 metastases.

In the present study we determined sFas/CD95 serum concentration in 125 melanoma patients of different clinical stages of disease compared with 30 healthy controls using an ELISA. sFas/CD95 serum level was significantly elevated (P < 0.0005) in melanoma patients (mean +/- SE = 8.60 +/- 0.26 ng/ml) compared with healthy controls (mean +/- SE = 6.27 +/- 0.25 ng/ml). Univariate analysis revealed a correlation of sFas/CD95 serum concentration with advanced stages of disease (P = 0.009). Only a slight increase in sFas/CD95 serum level (P = 0.057) could be observed in regard to the tumor burden. Patients undergoing current treatment with cytostatics (n = 18) revealed a strong increase in sFas/CD95 serum level (P < 0.0005), whereas treatment with IFN-alpha alone or combined with cytostatics (n = 19) showed no change in serum sFas/CD95 concentration. According to univariate analysis, elevated sFas/CD95 serum levels were associated with a poor overall (P < 0.005) and a progression-free (P < 0.0005) survival. Multivariate analysis revealed sFas/CD95 serum concentration as an independent predictive factor for progression-free (P = 0.011), but not overall (P = 0.078), survival.

The ability of human NK cells to mediate antitumor activity in vivo was investigated by evaluating the number of lung nodules and survival of mice given injections of human NK cells i.v. early after injection of CR3 tumor cells. Under these conditions, human NK cells effectively reduced lung nodule counts and prolonged survival when coinjected with interleukin 2 (IL-2). Multiple injections of IL-2 given during the first 16 h post-NK injection did not further enhance the tumor reduction. Significantly increased antitumor activity against CR3 tumor cells in vivo was observed in mice receiving NK cells coinjected with IL-2 and interleukin 12 (IL-12) in comparison to NK cells and IL-2 only. However, coinjection of IL-12 with human NK cells alone did not reduce the tumor burden. These results demonstrate the antitumor activity of human NK cells against human melanoma in severe combined immunodeficient mice and its augmentation by IL-2, alone or in combination with IL-12, suggesting that this model can be used to further investigate the interaction between human NK cells and human tumors.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Cutaneous melanoma is characterized by a high propensity for metastasis. Currently, surgical intervention remains the mainstay of therapy. This approach has proven most beneficial when the diagnosis is of early stage primary lesions. Likewise, patients undergoing resection for a solitary site of metastasis have shown a survival advantage. Identification of metastatic disease depends predominantly on radiographic techniques requiring the presence of significant tumor burdens for successful imaging. However, at that time, the role of surgery and/or biochemotherapy may be of limited value. Techniques to identify minimal disease states may permit more accurate assessment of prognosis. The detection of occult tumor cells by RT-PCR in the blood, lymph nodes, and bone marrow of melanoma patients provides one such approach to monitor tumor progression. Single-marker RT-PCR has been used as one such approach but is noted to have limitations in sensitivity and specificity based on the heterogeneity of tumor marker expression among tumors as well as within an individual tumor lesion or among multiple lesions in individual patients. We employed a multimarker reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay that demonstrates improved sensitivity over a single-marker approach. Currently, the consequences of detecting systemic subclinical metastasis remain unknown pending longer-term follow-up. The detection of occult melanoma cells using molecular techniques in conjunction with known clinicopathologic prognostic factors may provided a novel and efficient approach in monitoring tumor progression and further identify high-risk patients diagnosed early in the disease course.",

It was designed as an exploratory study. The setting was a single-center study in a university hospital. The study was carried out on 27 patients. IHP was used with modifications during three different time periods (IHP I, IHP II and IHP III), in technique and temperature (amount of melphalan: 0.5, 1.0 and 2 mg/kg body weight in the perfusate; 41, 40 and 40 degrees C). Tumor response was estimated according to WHO criteria with computed tomography or MRI. Mortality and morbidity were secondary measures. Six of 11 patients in the IHP I cohort experienced a partial response (PR). In the IHP II cohort, two patients of 11 experienced a complete response and five a PR. In the IHP III cohort, five of five patients experienced a PR. Six postoperative deaths were reported (27%) (three in the IHP I and three in the IHP II series), secondary to liver insufficiency and multiorgan failure. Treatment of liver metastases of malignant melanoma with isolated hyperthermic melphalan perfusion has shown an impressive tumor response rate, which seems to be higher than the response rates reported for other systemic chemotherapy regimens. The maximum tolerated dose for melphalan in the perfusate was surpassed with a 2 mg/kg body weight. By modifying the technique and restricting the allowed tumor burden, the response rate remained high and the mortality was reduced.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The first analysis of our clinical trial on interest of using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) as adjuvant therapy for stage III (regional lymph nodes) melanoma was published in 2002 [5]. The aim of this paper is to update clinical results of 7 years of follow-up after the last treated patient. In the trial conducted between December 1993 and January 1999, patients without any detectable metastases after lymph node excision were randomly assigned to receive either TIL plus interleukin-2 (IL-2) for 2 months, or IL-2 only. The duration of the relapse-free interval was the primary objective. Eighty-eight patients were enrolled in the study. Currently, the last analysis performed in June 2006, after a median follow-up of 114.8 months, did not show change of non-significant extension of the relapse-free interval or overall survival. However, this second analysis strengthens our first hypothesis about the relationship between number of invaded lymph nodes and TIL treatment effectiveness. In the group with only one invaded lymph node, the estimated relapse rate was significantly lower (P (adjusted) = 0.0219) and the overall survival was increased (P (adjusted) = 0.0125) in the TIL+IL-2 arm compared with the IL-2 only arm. No differences between the two arms, either with regard to the duration of disease-free survival (P (adjusted) = 0.38) or overall survival (P (adjusted) = 0.43), were noted in the group with more than one invaded lymph node, whatever the number of invaded lymph nodes. Treatment was compatible with normal daily activity. This study, with a very long follow up (median of almost 10 years), postulates for the first time relationship between TIL efficiency in stage III melanoma (AJCC) and number of invaded lymph nodes, indicating that tumor burden might be a crucial factor in the production of an effective in vitro expansion of T cells specific for autologous tumor antigen, a finding which could be of value in future vaccine development for the treatment of melanoma.",

Assessing maximum metastasis diameters, up to 27% of patients positive by the less extensive protocols went from 1 metastasis diameter group to a larger one when complete step-sectioning was performed. No patients were down-staged. Apparently minor protocol changes (eg, adding an extra step) led to substantial changes in maximum metastasis diameter. Similar protocol-dependent results were noted measuring the maximum centripetal tumor depth and the microanatomical location of metastases. By using semiquantitative tumor burden estimates, stage migration was always unidirectional (ie, moving from a lower to higher stage). Stereologic tumor burden estimates in step-sectioned SLNs also varied according to the number of step sections assessed, but could increase, decrease, or remain constant, so that stage migration was multidirectional.;Adding extra steps to pathology protocols when assessing semiquantitative parameters leads to unidirectional stage migration (\"the protocol trap\").

The data were examined to define optimal test values for assignment of risk. According to this model, patients with lesions greater than 1.75 mm and NANA less than 2 mumol/ml have a more than 12-fold greater risk of recurrence by 2 years than those with lesions less than or equal to 1.75 mm and NANA less than or equal to 2 mumol/ml.",

Both copper chelates were nontoxic to host mice given in the treatment schedule used here. Transplanted B16 melanoma cells were rejected after ip inoculation into CDF1 mice unless they were pretreated with copper chelates, which permitted 100% tumor takes. A limited number of tumor takes were observed in untreated NIH Swiss mice, and treatment with copper chelates doubled the number of ip tumor takes. Treatment with NC-Cu+1 enhanced tumor pigmentation and inhibited tumor encapsulation, a characteristic not shared with NTA-Cu+2. Tumors without capsules grew as unrestrained ascites and this was associated with an earlier onset of morbidity and decreased survival. Only mice treated with copper chelates permitted sc tumor takes. Treatment with NC-Cu+1 caused a reversible suppression of body weight, indicating that tumors grew slowly and independently of host body weight accretion until treatment was stopped. Treatment with NC-Cu+1 enhanced tumorigenicity of sc tumors as evidenced by an earlier onset of palpability, enhanced tumor takes in NIH Swiss mice, decreased final tumor weight and tumor burden, and shortened host survival. These results suggest that copper chelates alter the biological growth characteristics of B16 melanoma in both a murine and copper chelate-specific manner, and that the growth-promoting activity of NC-Cu+1 on tumors is related to the oxidation state of copper in chelates and enhanced copper nutriture of tumors.

In this retrospective study, we (i) sought to identify clinico-pathological features predicting NSLN status, as well as disease-free (DFS) and -specific (DSS) survival and (ii) evaluated the applicability of previously published algorithms, which were able to define a group of patients at zero-risk for NSLN-metastasis.;This analysis included 504 consecutive melanoma patients stage I and II who underwent successful SLN-biopsy (SLNB) at our institute between 1998 and 2005. Metastatic SLN were re-evaluated for tumor burden and categorized according to two different micro-anatomic classifications and the S/U-score (Size of the sentinel node metastasis > 2 mm/Ulceration of the primary melanoma) was assessed. DFS and DSS were calculated for all analyses.;Out of 504 melanoma patients stage I or II, 85 (17%) were SLN-positive and 18 of 85 (21%) were found with positive NSLN in the CLND specimen. Median follow-up was 31 months. Neither primary tumor characteristics (age, gender, Clark level, Breslow thickness, ulceration of the primary melanoma, site and histological subtype of the primary melanoma), nor features of the sentinel node tumor (number and site of draining lymph node basins, number of positive sentinel nodes and size of sentinel node tumor (< 2 mm vs. > or = 2 mm) were able to predict additional positive lymph nodes in the CLND specimen. Likewise the implementation of published algorithms was not able to identify patients at negligible risk for harboring NSLN metastases. Upon univariate analysis, disease-free survival in SLN-positive patients was correlated with Breslow thickness, sentinel node tumor size > 2 mm and S/U score. In respect to disease-specific survival the significant prognostic parameters were Breslow thickness, ulceration, sentinel node tumor size > 2 mm and the S/U score. After a median follow-up of 31 months recurrence rates (37% vs. 78%, p=0.02) and death from disease (24% vs. 50%, p<0.01) were significantly different in patients with SLN-metastasis only as compared to patients with NSLN-metastasis.;NSLN status cannot be predicted in this data analysis by using clinico-pathological characteristics.

The role of some relevant signaling proteins was also analyzed.;RG caused death of A375 cells through induction of caspase 3-mediated apoptosis and Beclin-1-associated autophagy. Moreover, RG administration (75 mg/kg body weight) which showed no acute or chronic toxicity, showed significant reduction in the skin tumor burden of DMBA-painted mice. RG also demonstrated potent anti-lipid peroxidative and antioxidant functions during the course of skin cancer induction by DMBA.;Chemopreventive potential of RG was demonstrated from overall results of this study, indicating its possible use in therapeutic formulation of an effective drug to treat skin cancer.",

Analysis of survival indicated that the tumor status of the nodes was the most important prognostic factor. Breslow's thickness had a significant impact on survival in tumors of 4 mm or thicker, and ulceration dropped to a borderline significant P-value. To assess the tumor burden in positive SNB, all slides (148 SN pos) were reviewed. Twenty per cent of these patients had evidence of metastasis in other nodes. Of the remaining 80% with a single tumor-involved SN, 62% had a single metastatic deposit.

Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) is an analytically sensitive technique for quantifying small concentrations of DNA. We studied the plasma concentrations of cfBRAF(V600E) by ddPCR in patients with melanoma during therapy with BRAF inhibitors.;Plasma concentrations of cfBRAF(V600E) were measured in 8 controls and 20 patients with advanced melanoma having the BRAF(V600E) mutation during treatment with BRAF inhibitors at baseline, first month, best response, and progression.;The BRAF(V600E) mutation was detected by ddPCR even at a fractional abundance of 0.005% in the wild-type gene. Agreement between tumor tissue BRAF(V600E) and plasma cfBRAF(V600E) was 84.3%. Baseline cfBRAF(V600E) correlated with tumor burden (r = 0.742, P < 0.001). cfBRAF(V600E) concentrations decreased significantly at the first month of therapy (basal median, 216 copies/mL; Q1-Q3, 27-647 copies/mL; first response median, 0 copies/mL; Q1-Q3, 0-49 copies/mL; P < 0.01) and at the moment of best response (median, 0 copies/mL; Q1-Q3, 0-33 copies/mL; P < 0.01).

Univariate logistic regression techniques were used to assess potential significant associations. Decision tree analysis was used to identify which features best predicted patients at low risk for harboring additional disease.;The likelihood of finding additional disease on completion lymph node dissection was significantly associated with primary location on the head and neck or lower extremity (P = 0.01), Breslow thickness >4 mm (P = 0.001), the presence of angiolymphatic invasion (P < 0.0001), satellitosis (P = 0.004), extranodal extension (P = 0.0002), three or more positive SLN (P = 0.02) and tumor burden within the SLN >1% surface area (P = 0.004).

The impact of treatment on relapse rate is most pronounced early during the treatment interval. The overall benefit of treatment in this trial was analyzed stratified by tumor burden and the presence or absence of microscopic nonpalpable and palpable regional lymph node metastasis. The benefit of therapy with IFN alpha-2b was greatest among node-positive strata. Toxicity of IFN alpha-2b required dose modification in the majority of patients, but treatment at > or = 80% of the scheduled dose was feasible in the majority of patients through the IV phase of treatment, and for more than 3 months of SC maintenance therapy.

Currently, because of metastatic spread, there are no effective treatment options for late-stage metastatic melanoma patients. Studies over the past two decades have provided insight into several complex molecular mechanisms as to how these malignancies evade immunological control, indicating the importance of immune escape or suppression for tumor survival. Thus, it is essential to develop innovative cancer strategies and address immune obstacles with the goal of generating more effective immunotherapies. One important area of study is to further elucidate the role and significance of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the maintenance of the tumor microenvironment. These cells possess a remarkable ability to suppress immune responses and, as such, facilitate tumor growth. Thus, MDSCs represent an important new target for preventing tumor progression and escape from immune control. In this study, we investigated the role of MDSCs in immune suppression of T cells in an antigen-specific B16 melanoma murine system utilizing a novel synthetic tyrosinase (Tyr) DNA vaccine therapy in both prophylactic and therapeutic models. This Tyr vaccine induced a robust and broad immune response, including directing CD8 T-cell infiltration into tumor sites. The vaccine also reduced the number of MDSCs in the tumor microenvironment through the downregulation of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, interleukin-10, CXCL5 and arginase II, factors important for MDSC expansion. This novel synthetic DNA vaccine significantly reduced the melanoma tumor burden and increased survival in vivo, due likely, in part, to the facilitation of a change in the tumor microenvironment through MDSC suppression.",

Thus far, 2-amino-5-bromo-6-(3-fluorophenyl)-4(3H)pyrimidinone ( ABMFPP ) and its sister compound 2-amino-5-bromo-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-4(3H)pyrimidinone ( ABOFPP ) were found to be superior to other pyrimidinones including 2-amino-5-bromo-6-(6-phenyl)-4-pyrimidinone which is currently under clinical investigation. Neither ABMFPP nor ABOFPP alone had any significant activity against P388 leukemia. However, a marked synergistic effect was observed when a single i.p. injection of CY at 24 hr after tumor inoculation (10(6) cells/mouse) was followed by multiple i.p. injections of either ABMFPP or ABOFPP . For instance, the increase of life span was about 180% when animals received both CY (150 mg/kg) and ABMFPP (125 mg/kg/injection) as compared to 100% increased life span when animals received CY alone, and 0% increased life span when animals received ABMFPP alone. Also, 80% of the animals were long-term survivors (greater than 30 days) when animals received the combination therapy as compared to 20% survivors when animals received CY alone. The synergistic effect exhibited by ABMFPP or ABOFPP correlated positively to the initial reduction of tumor burden by CY. The optimal gap between CY and pyrimidinone administration was one day. The best therapeutic response was observed when pyrimidinone was given every 4 days for a total of 7 injections; however, other schedules and dosing frequencies also gave significant responses. The synergistic effect was also observed with B 16 melanoma when animals received the combination therapy. The significance of these findings, in terms of theoretical consideration as well as drug development, is discussed.",

N-BPs inhibit farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) synthase, thereby inhibiting protein prenylation and causing cellular toxicity. We found that ZA decreased Tax+ tumor and B16 melanoma viability and caused the accumulation of unprenylated Rap1a proteins in vitro. However, it is presently unclear whether N-BPs exert anti-tumor effects in bone independent of inhibition of osteoclast (OC) function in vivo. Therefore, we evaluated the impact of treatment with ZA on B16 melanoma bone tumor burden in irradiated mice transplanted with splenic cells from src(-/-) mice, which have non-functioning OCs. OC-defective mice treated with ZA demonstrated a significant 88% decrease in tumor growth in bone compared to vehicle-treated OC-defective mice.

We review the literature on managing the adverse effects and kinetics of tumor regression with ipilimumab and provide guidelines on their management. During treatment with these antibodies, a unique set of adverse effects may occur, called immune-related adverse events (irAEs). These include rashes, which may rarely progress to life-threatening toxic epidermal necrolysis, and colitis, characterized by a mild to moderate, but occasionally also severe and persistent diarrhea. Hypophysitis, hepatitis, pancreatitis, iridocyclitis, lymphadenopathy, neuropathies, and nephritis have also been reported with ipilimumab. Early recognition of irAEs and initiation of treatment are critical to reduce the risk of sequelae. Interestingly, irAEs correlated with treatment response in some studies. Unique kinetics of response have been observed with CTLA-4 blockade with at least four patterns: (1) response in baseline lesions by week 12, with no new lesions seen; (2) stable disease, followed by a slow, steady decline in total tumor burden; (3) regression of tumor after initial increase in total tumor burden; and (4) reduction in total tumor burden during or after the appearance of new lesion(s) after week 12.

We further evaluated the presence of specific PCR-positive mRNA markers in peripheral blood as well as in regional nodes as an expression of tumor progression. Peripheral blood samples from 317 MM patients with either localized (n = 219) or metastatic (n = 98) disease were processed to obtain total cellular RNA. RT-PCR was performed using tyrosinase (TYR), p97, and MelanA/MART1 as mRNA markers. PCR products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and Southern blot hybridization. In addition, paraffin-embedded samples of histologically proven tumor-negative lymph nodes from the subset of patients with localized disease were analyzed by RT-PCR, using radiolabeled primers for TYR and MelanA/MART1. The presence of mRNA markers was significantly correlated with tumor burden with a good correlation between risk of recurrence (evaluated in stage I-III patients) and increasing number of PCR-positive markers (p = 0.0002). Currently, for each patient, PCR results obtained at different times during follow-up are being analyzed, and any variation in the number of PCR-positive markers is being correlated to the clinical status. Molecular screening of histologically negative nodes for the presence of metastatic MM cells is also under evaluation. Preliminary assessment of a subset of MM patients with higher risk of recurrence will require longer follow-up in order to define the role of RT-PCR in monitoring these patients.",

Here, we used a mouse model of human breast cancer bone metastasis to examine the effects of risedronate and NE-10790, a phosphonocarboxylate analogue of the bisphosphonate risedronate, on osteolysis and tumor growth. Osteolysis was measured by radiography and histomorphometry. Tumor burden was measured by fluorescence imaging and histomorphometry. NE-10790 had a 70-fold lower bone mineral affinity compared with risedronate. It was 7-fold and 8,800-fold less potent than risedronate at reducing, respectively, breast cancer cell viability in vitro and bone loss in ovariectomized animals. We next showed that risedronate given at a low dosage in animals bearing human B02-GFP breast tumors reduced osteolysis by inhibiting bone resorption, whereas therapy with higher doses also inhibited skeletal tumor burden. Conversely, therapy with NE-10790 substantially reduced skeletal tumor growth at a dosage that did not inhibit osteolysis, a higher dosage being able to also reduce bone destruction. The in vivo antitumor activity of NE-10790 was restricted to bone because it did not inhibit the growth of subcutaneous B02-GFP tumor xenografts nor the formation of B16-F10 melanoma lung metastases. Moreover, NE-10790, in combination with risedronate, reduced both osteolysis and skeletal tumor burden, whereas NE-10790 or risedronate alone only decreased either tumor burden or osteolysis, respectively. In conclusion, our study shows that decreasing the bone mineral affinity of bisphosphonates is an effective therapeutic strategy to inhibit skeletal tumor growth in vivo.",

The main objective of our work was to investigate the relationship between mutant BRAF DNA in plasma and clinical response. Thirty-eight stage IV patients with a V600 mutated BRAF melanoma were included prior to any treatment. DNA was extracted from plasma and mutant DNA was detected using the amplification-refractory mutation system method. Before the beginning of any treatment, the corresponding BRAF mutation was detected in 29 of the 38 tested plasma samples (76.3% positive per cent agreement). We observed a strong correlation between the presence of circulating mutated DNA and overall survival (OS; P=.02), and with the number of metastatic sites (P=.01). The presence of circulating mutated DNA was also strongly correlated with serum LDH activity (P<.01) and S100 protein concentration (P<.01). Finally, seven patients presented discordant BRAF status in different tumor sites. In all these patients, the test performed on ctDNA was positive, suggesting that ctDNA analysis might be less sensitive to tumor heterogeneity. Altogether, these results suggest that plasmatic mutant BRAF DNA is a prognostic factor of OS, correlated with tumor burden. In addition, it represents an interesting alternative source of DNA to detect BRAF mutations before treatment. ",

Depending on the challenge and the context, constitutively expressed COX-1 or the transiently induced COX-2 isoform are of relevance. Moreover, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of skin is a prominent example of epithelial neoplasia that consistently overexpresses COX-2 in the parenchyme and the mesenchyme of premalignant and malignant lesions, while COX-1 expression remains unaltered. Pharmacological, clinical, and experimental animal studies as well as a few epidemiological studies document the importance of PG signaling in non-melanoma skin cancer including SCC and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in humans and mice. Increased levels of PGE(2) and PGF(2α) in premalignant and/or malignant epithelial skin cancers are due to the constitutive upregulation of enzymes involved in PG biosynthesis, such as COX-2, and downregulation of the tumor suppressor gene 15-hydroxy-prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH), which is involved in the inactivation of PG, thus counteracting the activities of COX. Most remarkably, genetic studies show that mice which are deficient in COX-2 or COX-1 are protected from the development of SCC when applying the multi-stage chemical carcinogenesis protocol. Conversely, the forced overexpression of COX-2 in the proliferative basal compartment of the stratified skin epidermis results in spontaneous hyperplasia and dysplasia in transgenic mice and furthermore a sensitization for cancer development by conferring an auto-promoted skin phenotype. In multi-stage carcinogenesis, it also becomes clear that aberrant COX-2 overexpression and activity are causally involved in tumor promotion and tumor progression rather than initiation. In contrast, using as inducer of carcinogenesis the complete carcinogen UV B light, depletion of COX-2 but not of COX-1 makes mouse skin resistant for SCC, indicating that here, only COX-2 is essential. Depending on the type of challenge, COX-2-dependent signaling contributes to the pre-invasive growth of the skin epidermis by a delayed onset of terminal differentiation, or stimulation of hyperproliferation and survival. With respect to BCC, the genetic ablation of COX-2 but also of COX-1 leads to a strongly reduced tumor burden in the skin of Patched (Ptch)1(+/-) mice, which due to the deletion of a Ptch1 allele, spontaneously develop BCC resembling human familial basal cell nevus syndrome and sporadic BCC. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and the COX-2-selective inhibitors (COXibs) exhibit impressive efficacy inhibiting tumor burden in various mouse models of SCC and BCC. Most importantly, in humans the interruption of COX-2 signaling is an effective strategy to treat and chemo-prevent non-melanoma skin cancer in individuals who are at high risk for the disease. However, any potential beneficial effect of this medicine has to be balanced against the adverse effects that are known to be associated with these drugs in a subset of patients.",

The therapeutic benefit is unknown. This review analyzed the necessity of CLND in sentinel node positive patients.;Prognosis of sentinel node positive patients is highly heterogeneous. The Rotterdam and Dewar criteria and S-classification are important sentinel node tumor burden criteria to stratify melanoma patients for prognosis and risk of NSN metastases. Patients with less than 0.1 mm metastases seem to have similar prognosis as sentinel node negative patients, especially when located in the subcapsular area. This depends on the use of an extensive sentinel node pathology protocol identifying possibly clinically irrelevant micrometastases.;Consensus on the sentinel node pathology work-up and analysis protocols are crucial for correct risk stratification and for clinical decision-making. Primary and sentinel node tumor burden parameters and patient comorbidities should be taken into consideration when offering CLND to an individual patient.

Patients with stable or responding disease were maintained on treatment until tumor resolution or progression. Systemic toxicity was infrequent, dose-related, and limited to mild flu-like symptoms that resolved within 24 hours. Local inflammation, at times with pustule formation, was consistently seen with doses of > or =10(7) PFU/lesion. Chronically treated lesions showed a dense infiltration, with CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, histiocytes, and eosinophils. All seven patients developed an antivaccinia humoral immune response 14-21 days following revaccination. Despite the presence of these antivaccinia antibodies, the reporter gene was expressed, as judged by the development of anti-beta-galactosidase antibodies in all patients. Passenger cytokine gene function was evidenced by the presence of virally encoded GM-CSF mRNA at injection sites both early (weeks 1 and 5) and late (week 31) in the course of treatment. Eosinophilia at treatment sites indicated that physiologically significant levels of functional cytokine were generated. However, there were no changes in the total number of peripheral white blood cells or in the numbers or percentages of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, monocytes, or eosinophils. GM-CSF was not detected in the sera. The two patients with the largest tumor burdens failed to respond even at treatment sites. Three patients had mixed responses, with regression of treated and untreated dermal metastases and progression of disease elsewhere. One patient had a partial response, with regression of injected and uninjected regional dermal metastases. Residual melanoma was excised, rendering the patient disease free. One patient with only dermal metastases confined to the scalp achieved a complete remission.

We report long-term outcomes in patients with in-transit extremity melanoma who underwent isolated limb perfusion (ILP) in an era of increasingly accurate staging, uniform operative and treatment conditions, and regular long-term follow-up. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between May 1992 and February 2005, 91 patients (median age, 57 years; 50 women, 41 men) underwent a 90-minute hyperthermic ILP (melphalan, 10 to 13 mg/L limb volume, tumor necrosis factor [TNF; n = 44], or interferon [n = 38]) using uniform operative technique and intraoperative leak monitoring. Patients were prospectively followed for response, in-field progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Parameters associated with in-field PFS and OS were analyzed by standard statistical methods. Results There was one operative death (1.1%). There were 62 complete responses (69%) and 23 partial responses (26%) in 90 assessable patients. At a median potential follow-up of 11 years, median in-field PFS was 12.4 months and median OS was 47.4 months; 5 and 10-year actuarial OS probabilities were 43% and 34%, respectively. Female sex and low tumor burden (< or = 20 lesions) were associated with prolonged in-field PFS (male:female hazard ratio [HR], 2.07; 95% CI, 1.27 to 3.38; 21+ v < or = 20 tumors HR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.21 to 4.34; P < .011 for both). Female sex was associated with improved OS (P = .027; male:female HR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.07 to 3.09). CONCLUSION In appropriately selected patients, ILP has clinical benefit. The use of TNF was not associated with improved in-field PFS, while female sex was associated with better survival.",

The aims of the present study were to determine whether extensive sectioning of SLNs resulted in more accurate categorization of histologic features of tumor deposits and to assess prognostic associations of histologic parameters obtained using more intensive sectioning protocols.;From patients with a single primary cutaneous melanoma who underwent SLN biopsy between 1991 and 2008, those in which the maximum size of the largest tumor deposit (MaxSize) in SLNs was <0.1 mm in the original sections were identified. Five batches of additional sections were cut from the SLN tissue blocks at intervals of 250 μm. The 1st batch was cut from the blocks without any trimming; these sections were therefore immediately adjacent to the original sections. Each batch included 5 sequential sections, the 1st and 5th stained with hematoxylin-eosin, and the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th stained immunohistochemically with S-100, HMB-45, and Melan-A, respectively. In each batch of sections, the following histologic features of tumor deposit(s) in the SLNs were evaluated: MaxSize; tumor penetrative depth (TPD) (defined as the maximum depth of tumor deposit(s) from the inner margin of the lymph node capsule), and intranodal location (classified as subcapsular if the tumor deposit(s) were confined to the subcapsular zone or parenchymal if there was any involvement of the nodal parenchyma beyond the subcapsular zone). The measured histologic parameters were compared in each batch of sections. The association of histologic parameters with overall survival was assessed for the parameters measured in each batch of sections.;There were 20 eligible patients (15 females, 5 males, median age 60 years). After a median follow-up duration of 40 months, 4 patients had died from melanoma and 2 patients of unknown causes. Completion lymph node dissection (CLND) was performed in 13 cases (65%) and was negative in all cases. Relative to the measured values on the original sections, all 3 parameters were upstaged in subsequent batches of sections, but no further upstaging of MaxSize, TPD, or location was seen beyond batch 3, batch 4, and batch 2, respectively. Increasing MaxSize was associated with significantly poorer overall survival in batches 1, 2, and 3. Parenchymal involvement was significantly associated with poorer survival in batches 2-5. TPD was not significantly associated with overall survival.;The results of this study indicate that very small (<0.1 mm) deposits of melanoma in SLNs may be associated with adverse clinical outcomes and that this is due, at least in part, to the underestimation of SLN tumor burden in the initial sections. Our evidence does not support clinical decision-making on the assumption that patients with very small melanoma deposits in SLNs have the same outcome as those who are SLN-negative.",

Such combination therapy may be most useful when \"metronomic\" doses of antineoplastic drugs are used, thereby potentially avoiding some of the immunosuppressive effects of these drugs. Recent studies have shown that some conventional antineoplastic drugs can be exploited for antiangiogenic capacities, a strategy that requires drugs to be administered at regular intervals. We therefore investigated whether such metronomic therapy with the alkylating agent cyclophosphamide (CTX) could be effectively combined with immunotherapy eliciting tumor-reactive CTLs. An immunization protocol using injection of recombinant DNA followed by injection of recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara strain was used to initiate a specific CTL response in mice capable of providing resistance to challenge with the murine melanoma B16.F10. Combining this immunotherapeutic regime with metronomic delivery of CTX resulted in antitumor activity that was dramatically enhanced over either treatment administered alone and was also significantly greater than combining immunotherapy with CTX administered by a maximum tolerated dose regime. Whereas both metronomic and maximum tolerated dose delivery of CTX did cause deletion of proliferating tumor-specific CTLs in the blood, this deletion occurred with slower kinetics with the metronomic schedule. Further analysis showed that metronomic CTX treatment did not delete cells with low expression of CD43, a \"memory\" phenotype, and that these cells maintained potent restimulatory capacity. The combination of immunotherapy and metronomic CTX therapy may be well suited to clinical management of cancer.",

Tumor cells were implanted s.c. in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice, half of which were treated with beta-all trans retinoic acid (RA). Although RA failed to exhibit direct toxicity on this variant at the concentration used, the immunologic aberrations induced by the tumors were diminished by i.p. RA administration (at 45 micrograms twice/week for 3 weeks). In mice bearing B16-F10 tumors, tumor burdens were decreased from 2.9% of body weight to 1.6%. The mitogenic responses of splenic lymphocytes to concanavalin A (ConA) were increased in tumor-bearing mice following this RA treatment. The presence of these tumor cells decreased the absolute number of CD4- and CD8-positive splenic lymphocytes. Following RA treatment, the CD8-positive population was increased in tumor-bearing mice, while the CD4+ population was not significantly altered. Since previous studies indicated that plasma membrane fragments (or vesicles) could alter lymphocyte distributions and proliferative capacities, the in vitro shedding of membrane fragments from B16-F10 tumor cells was assayed and observed to be decreased after continuous treatment of cultures with 10(-6) M RA for 21 days. Membrane shedding from B16-F10 cells was inhibited by 48.5% following RA treatment.

The role of immune system against infection is self-evident. Although the role of the immune system in the immune surveillance of cancer has not been proven, the immune system is believed to play an interactive role in the regulation of tumor growth. Immunotherapy is the application of the immune system to fight against the tumor. Although immunotherapeutic approaches have been tried in many types of cancer, both malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma seem to show occasional, but definitive response to immunotherapy. The fact that immune eradication of tumor is most efficient when the tumor burden is minimal speaks for the fact that immunotherapy may be most effective for control of microscopic disease. Therefore, to maximize the effect of immunotherapy, the tumor burden needs to be reduced, hopefully to microscopic level either by surgery or in combination with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Also, new strategies are needed to develop more potent vaccines and stimulate effector cells to eradicate tumor cells under the most optimal conditions. ",

Immune modulators such as IL-2 and anti-CTLA-4 can mediate tumor regression in patients with metastatic melanoma and renal cancer, two tumor types that appear exceptional in their ability to spontaneously harbor endogenous antitumor immune cells. The responses can be long lasting, but the number of patients who benefit from these molecules remains limited. Combinations of these agents with cytotoxic and biologic agents are being investigated as a means to increase response rates and in an attempt to broaden application to other cancer types. Rare responses to cancer vaccines suggest that a better understanding of the underlying biology and mechanism of actions may lead to wider application in the future. The most effective form of immunotherapy thus far, capable of eradicating large tumor burdens in melanoma patients, is the ACT of TIL given to patients after lymphodepletion. As an alternative, lymphocytes engineered to recognize tumor-associated antigens can be safely infused to patients. With this approach, tumor regression is now being reported for cancers other than melanoma, but success remains constrained by the identification of antigens expressed with high specificity by cancer cells and not by normal tissues.",

We combined IL-12 gene transfer with 4-1BB costimulation to explore a previously noted cooperative anti-tumor effect against this model tumor. We hypothesize that the innate immune response mediated by IL-12-activated natural killer (NK) cells initiates the activation of the immune system, leading to the priming of T cells, whereas 4-1BB costimulation enhances the function of primed tumor-specific T cells. The effect of the combination therapy on the growth of subcutaneous (s.c.) tumors and pulmonary metastasis was examined. The combination therapy significantly retarded the growth of subcutaneously-inoculated tumors, and 50% of tumor-bearing mice survived with complete tumor regression. In contrast, neither IL-12 gene transfer nor anti-4-1BB antibody administration alone was as effective. Enhanced CTL activity against both B16-F10 tumor cells and TRP-2-pulsed EL4 syngeneic tumor cells was observed in tumor-bearing animals treated with the combination therapy 2 weeks after treatment and, in long-term survivors from this combination therapy, at >120 days. In a pulmonary metastatic model, only the combination therapy generated significant protection against metastasis. In vivo depletion of NK or CD8(+) but not CD4(+) subsets eliminated the protective immunity. Furthermore, NK cell depletion significantly reduced both tumor-specific CTL activity and the number of tumor-specific IFN-gamma-producing cells, suggesting that this synergistic effect requires the participation of both NK and CD8(+) T cells.",

FDG uptake has been correlated with proliferation rate, and thus, the degree of malignancy of a given tumor (i.e., grading). Consecutively, a relationship of survival prognosis and the extent of tumor burden as well as degree of FDG accumulation--determined by FDG-PET--has been suggested in various tumors. The aim of this study was to assess the potential of fluor-18-FDG-PET in order to evaluate the survival prognosis in melanoma. Patient data (n=95) were retrospectively analyzed, and the results of functional FDG-PET staging was correlated with survival data. Time of staging (diagnosis of primary versus recurrence) had no statistically significant effect on survival prognosis when patients were matched for pertaining node metastasis (NM) stages. Differences in survival were owing to the presence of metastatic disease rather than time of staging. Tumor (T)-stage (T1-T4) alone had no effect on survival prognosis when patients were matched for NM stages. Differences in survival were also due to higher rates of lymph node (LN) and organ metastases in higher T-stages. Detection of LN metastases (N1M0) had a statistically significant and predominant impact on 5-year survival (N0M0 80% versus N1M0 45%; p<0.01). Additional presence of distant metastases in LN-positive patients (N1M1) had only a statistically insignificant further impact on survival (5-year survival in N1M0 45% versus N1M1 29%; p>0.05). Exclusive presence of organ metastases (N0M1) showed a statistically significant drop of survival with a 5-year survival of 61% in N0M1 versus 80% in N0M0, respectively (p<0.03). Further, the combined presence of LN and distant metastases had the worst prognosis (5-year survival in N1M1 29% versus N0M1 61%; p<0.02). Based on a qualitative 4-point scoring system, patients with malignancy-typical FDG uptake showed an overall 5-year survival of 38%, as compared to patients with malignancy-suspicious lesions (71%; p <or= 0.02) or patients without evidence of disease (80%; p<0.001). When PET and computed tomography (CT) findings were compared, survival was best in patients with both studies (CT and PET) being negative (5-year survival, 83%), worst when PET and CT were positive (5-year survival, 61%; p<0.02), and showed an intermediate survival when PET was positive, but with CT still negative (5-year survival, 73%). In patients staged by FDG-PET, significant risk factors--as identified by univariate und multivariate analyses--were (i) malignancy-typical FDG uptake, (ii) detection of LN, and (iii) organ metastases. In conclusion, FDG-PET offers valid prognostic information, demonstrating a good relationship of functional TNM-stage and actual survival prognosis. The results obtained in one PET study seem to be as suitable as the combined results of conventional staging, including clinical and morphologic (e.g., CT) methods and clinical follow-up. FDG-PET was more accurate in tumor detection and seemed to detect tumor spread earlier, as compared to CT.",

This effect may not be antigen-specific as three histologically distinct tumors generated CD25(+) Treg that could suppress the T-cell immune response to a melanoma vaccine. Importantly, since ex vivo depletion of CD25(+) Treg from TBM spleen cells prior to reconstitution and vaccination fully restored the generation of therapeutic effector T cells, even in animals with established tumor burden, we have initiated a translational clinical trial of this strategy in patients with metastatic melanoma.",

Inadequate homing of infused NK cells to the tumor site represents a key factor that may explain the poor anti-tumor effect of NK cell therapy against solid tumors. One of the major players in the regulation of lymphocyte chemotaxis is the chemokine receptor chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 3 (CXCR3) which is expressed on activated NK cells and induces NK cell migration toward gradients of the chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL9, 10 and 11). Here, we show that ex vivo expansion of human NK cells results in a tenfold increased expression of the CXCR3 receptor compared with resting NK cells (p = 0.04). Consequently, these NK cells displayed an improved migratory capacity toward solid tumors, which was dependent on tumor-derived CXCL10. In xenograft models, adoptively transferred NK cells showed increased migration toward CXCL10-transfected melanoma tumors compared with CXCL10-negative wild-type tumors, resulting in significantly reduced tumor burden and increased survival (median survival 41 vs. 32 days, p = 0.03). Furthermore, administration of interferon-gamma locally in the tumor stimulated the production of CXCL10 in subcutaneous melanoma tumors resulting in increased infiltration of adoptively transferred CXCR3-positive expanded NK cells.

To seek evidence that inducible vascular adhesive properties can regulate hepatic metastasis, groups of 9-14 c57bl/6 mice were given 1.5 microg of interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha) 4 h before the injection of 3 x 10(5) B16F1 melanoma cells into a mesenteric vein. After 7 days, these mice had an 11-22-fold greater hepatic tumor burden than controls given i.p. saline. In both groups, small metastases were seen in the portal tract region. Twice as many 125I-labeled UdR-labeled B16F1 cells were detected in the livers of IL-1alpha-treated animals 5 min after injection, and 7 times as many were found after 24 h. Intravital videomicroscopy showed marked differences in the arrest pattern of the B16F1 cells between controls and IL-1alpha-treated mice. In controls, arrest occurred at a median distance of 32 microm beyond the sinusoidal inlet, where the median sinusoidal diameter was 16 microm. However, in IL-1alpha-treated mice, arrest occurred in the presinusoidal portal vein branches, which had a median diameter of 34 microm. Maximum observed tumor cell velocities were 2-fold less in the IL-1alpha-treated mice, although there was no significant difference in the flow rate of RBCs. To look for effects on the adhesive properties of the hepatic microvasculature, 5 x 10(4) B16F1 cells were incubated for 15 min on 5-microm sections of liver from control and IL-1alpha-treated mice. Three-fold more cells adhered to sections of liver from IL-1alpha-treated mice. This phenomenon was blocked by GRGDS peptides and by antibodies to E-selectin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and the alpha v integrin subunit. We postulate that pretreatment of mice with IL-1alpha alters a number of adhesive interactions between B16F1 cells and the hepatic microvasculature, contributing to the site of arrest and to the subsequent fate of the arrested cells.",

Serum from animals held in an enriched environment (EE) inhibited cancer proliferation in vitro and was markedly lower in leptin. Hypothalamic brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was selectively upregulated by EE, and its genetic overexpression reduced tumor burden, whereas BDNF knockdown blocked the effect of EE.

Each of these randomized trials demonstrated no clinical benefit, although again there was a significant correlation between antibody response after vaccination and disease free and overall survival. To better understand this paradox, we established a surgical adjuvant model targeting GD2 ganglioside on EL4 lymphoma cells injected into the foot pad followed by amputation at variable intervals. Our findings are (1) comparable strong therapeutic benefit resulted from treatment of mice after amputation with a GD2-KLH conjugate vaccine or with anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody 3F8.

Thirty-five patients were enrolled between March 2001 and March 2003. Though all patients included presented with large tumor burdens and progressive diseases, 71% of them experienced stability after vaccination, with durations up to 19 months. Among RCC patients 3/22 (14%) presented objective responses. The median time to progression was 4 months for melanoma and 5.7 months for RCC patients; no significant untoward effects were noted. Furthermore, immune function, as evaluated by cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions to recall antigens and by peripheral blood proliferative responses to tumor-specific and nonspecific stimuli, presented a clear tendency to recover in vaccinated patients.

These undesirable diseases become a major social and economic burden. As both primary and secondary bone tumors develop in the unique bone tissue, it is therefore necessary to understand bone cell biology in tumor bone environment. Recent findings of the Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL)/RANK/osteoprotegerin (OPG) molecular triad, the key regulators of bone remodeling, opened new era of bone research. Although RANK is an essential receptor for osteoclast formation, activation and survival, functional RANK expression has been recently identified on several bone-associated tumor cells. When RANK is expressed on secondary bone tumor cells, it is implicated in tumor cell migration, whereas this is not the case for primary bone tumors. In any case, RANK is not involved in RANK-positive cell proliferation or death. In two models of bone metastases secondary to melanoma or prostate carcinoma, in vivo neutralization of RANKL by OPG resulted in complete protection from paralysis, due to metastases of vertebral body, and a marked reduction in tumor burden in bones, but not in other organs. OPG also decreased tumor formation and tumor burden in a mouse model of primary bone tumor, osteosarcoma. In all these models, tumor cells express RANK. These data revealed that local differentiation factors, such as RANKL, play an important role in cell migration in a metastatic tissue-specific manner. These findings substantiate the novel direct role of RANKL/RANK in bone-associated tumors, and its capability of representing new therapeutic targets.",

The genetic absence of B cells strongly facilitated CpG-induced tumor progression.

Furthermore, concomitant with higher production of IFN-γ, the apoptosis rate in the lungs of mice adoptively transferred with CpG-activated B cells was increased.

There are over 3.5 million NMSC diagnoses in two million patients annually, with men having a 3-fold greater incidence of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) compared with women. Chronic inflammation has been linked to tumorigenesis, with a key role for the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme. Diclofenac, a COX-2 inhibitor and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, currently is prescribed to patients as a short-term therapeutic agent to induce SCC precursor lesion regression. However, its efficacy as a preventative agent in patients without evidence of precursor lesions but with significant UVB-induced cutaneous damage has not been explored. We previously demonstrated in a murine model of UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis that when exposed to equivalent UVB doses, male mice had lower levels of inflammation but developed increased tumor multiplicity, burden and grade compared with female mice. Because of the discrepancy in the degree of inflammation between male and female skin, we sought to determine if topical treatment of previously damaged skin with an anti-inflammatory COX-2 inhibitor would decrease tumor burden and if it would be equally effective in the sexes. Our results demonstrated that despite observed sex differences in the inflammatory response, prolonged topical diclofenac treatment of chronically UVB-damaged skin effectively reduced tumor multiplicity in both sexes. Unexpectedly, tumor burden was significantly decreased only in male mice.

This immune response apparently can be augmented by nonspecific immunologic stimulates such as BCG. These agents are effective for destroying tumor when injected locally into intracutaneous disease but are not as effective for subcutaneous disease. Preliminary clinical trials indicated that immune stimulants are effective when administered systemically. The effect is only minimal for diseminated disease, but the therapeutic benefit is clearly augmented for patients with a minimal residual tumor burden, such as those patients with metastases to regional lymph nodes. Thus immunotherapy is a systemically active mode of therapy. Its toxicity is minimal, and it appears to be effective in a wide spectrum of the disease. However, immunotherapy is not effective for a large residual tumor burden; consequently it must be used in combination with other modes of treatment such as irradiation therapy or chemotherapy. Early experiences with BCG immunotherapy for malignant melanoma and C. parvum for oat cell carcinoma are encouraging. It is remarkable that a nonspecific immunologic stimulant does, in fact, have this effect. Immunotherapy experiments in animals suggest that in order to achieve maximal benefit. BCG must have close contact with tumor cells or must be combined with a tumor-associated antigen.

In contrast, in 74 American Joint Committee on Cancer stages I-IV melanoma patients, we found that development of lymph node metastases is a key event triggering CD8(+) T-cell-mediated immunity to self-epitopes encoded by melanocyte differentiation antigens. This was shown by the increased peripheral precursor frequency to Melan-A/Mart-1, gp100, and tyrosinase epitopes in stage III and IV compared with stage I and II patients, and by accumulation of functional memory T cells directed to Melan-A/Mart-1(26-35) in tumor-invaded lymph nodes. However, in tumor-invaded lymph nodes of most patients, CD8(+) T cells directed to melanocyte differentiation antigens or to tumor-restricted antigens (MAGE-3 and NY-ESO-1 epitopes), showed a CCR7(+) CD45RA(+) CD27(+) CD28(+) perforin(-) \"precursor\" phenotype. Only in 7 of 23 cases antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells in invaded lymph nodes showed a predominant CCR7(-) CD45RA(-) CD27(+) CD28(-) perforin(+) \"preterminally differentiated\" phenotype. In the latter subset of patients, by immunohistochemistry in lymph node lesions, we found that CD8(+) T lymphocytes intermingling with the neoplastic tissue expressed a CCR7(-) CD45RO(+)/RA(-) phenotype, whereas CD4(+) lymphocytes did not infiltrate the tumor. Furthermore, perforin and granzyme B were expressed on a higher fraction of the CD8(+) cells surrounding the invading tumor compared with the lymphocytes infiltrating the neoplastic tissue. In addition, no evidence for tumor regression was found in such metastatic lesions, as documented by absence of neoplastic cell necrosis or apoptosis. These data indicate that neoplastic cells in the lymph nodes and/or increased tumor burden in metastatic disease activate CD8(+) T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity to self-epitopes. However, the paucity of terminally differentiated CD8(+) T cells at tumor site suggests that immunotherapy strategies may require not only the boosting of tumor immunity, but also effective means to promote CD8(+) T-cell differentiation in the neoplastic tissue.",

We have therefore attempted to enhance the anti-metastatic therapeutic efficacy of adoptively transferred A-NK cells with standard anticancer chemotherapeutic agents. We have found that chemoimmunotherapy with A-NK cells plus cyclophosphamide to be more effective than A-NK cell adoptive immunotherapy alone. We have now built on these findings, by examining the ability of novel biologic response modifiers (low molecular weight benzothiazole compounds) to augment adoptive immunotherapy with A-NK cells. Two compounds KB-R4107 (4-methoxy-2-(4-t-butylphenyl)benzothiazole) and KB-R4250 (4-methoxy-2-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)benzothiazole) enhanced reduction of B16 melanoma pulmonary metastases mediated by A-NK cell adoptive immunotherapy. Both compounds were administered for 5 days prior to administration of A-NK cells at 100 mg/kg p.o. All experimental groups initially contained at least 7 animals and were examined for tumor burden on day 10. With B16 melanoma cells administered on day 0 and A-NK cells administered on Day 4, KB-R4107 and KB-R4250 yielded on average a 64% and 52% reduction in metastatic burden, respectively compared to an average 17% reduction using A-NK cells alone.

However, currently available therapies remain less successful than desired. To study the mechanisms of action and possible improvements in cell-transfer therapies, we use a murine model system with analogous components to the treatment of patients. T cell receptor transgenic CD8+ T cells (pmel-1) specifically recognizing the melanocyte differentiation antigen gp100 are adoptively transferred into lympho-depleted mice bearing large, established, 14-day subcutaneous B16 melanoma (0.5-1 cm in diameter) on the day of treatment. Adoptive cell transfer in combination with interleukin interleukin-2 or interleukin-15 cytokine administration and vaccination using an altered form of the target antigen, gp100, can result in the complete and durable regression of large tumor burdens. Complete responders frequently develop autoimmunity with vitiligo at the former tumor site that often spreads to involve the whole coat. These findings have important implications for the design of immunotherapy trials in humans.",

Isolated hepatic perfusion (IHP) administers intensive therapy to the liver while limiting systemic toxicity and thus may have an important role in the management of unresectable liver metastases. This review s describes the development of IHP, initial clinical results, open and percutaneous IHP techniques, and contemporary long-term treatment outcomes. IHP with melphalan or tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) has been shown to achieve hepatic response rates of greater than 50% with progression-free survival of greater than 12 months among patients with refractory ocular melanoma liver metastases. The only series describing outcomes of IHP for neuroendocrine liver metastases notes an overall response rate of 50% and a median actuarial overall survival of 48 months after IHP treatment with melphalan or TNFα. The majority of studies that have evaluated IHP have been performed in patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRCLM). In aggregate, survival results from retrospective studies and phase I/II clinical trials suggest that IHP demonstrated no significant survival benefit compared with systemic chemotherapy alone as first-line therapy. In contrast, IHP does improve outcomes relative to that provided by second-line chemotherapy for CRCLM, with overall response rates of 60% and median duration of liver response of 12 months. Continued evaluation of IHP for unresectable liver metastases is necessary to establish its role in multidisciplinary treatment approaches. ",

The immunity responsible for tumor eradication, as well as the immunity responsible for the resistance of the cured mice to further tumor challenge, was mediated by the Lyt 2 subset of T-cells which contains cytotoxic T-cells.

Bones, ovaries, adrenals and the brain were most affected by metastasis, following an intraarterial injection of B16/F1 and B16/F10 melanoma and FS/L10 fibrosarcoma cells into C57BL/6 mice. Melanoma cells showed a marked metastatic preference for bone, while fibrosarcoma cells developed brain metastasis in all animals. Tumor burden in bones was highest (19+/-2%) for B16/F10 cells, compared to B16/F1 (10+/-2%) or FS/L10 (3+/-1%) cells. Autoradiographic studies demonstrated organ- and cell type-specific differences in tumor cell proliferation, with B16/F10 cells displaying the lowest labelling indexes in bone (12+/-2% for B16/F10 vs 28+/-2% and 27+/-4% for B16/F1 and FS/L10 cells, respectively). To test if bone-derived factors differentially affected tumor cell growth in these three cell lines H-3-thymidine uptake by these tumor cells was assessed after in vitro incubation with bone-derived conditioned medium. Under these conditions, we observed stimulation of B16/F10 cell proliferation, but inhibition of uptake in the other two cell lines. Thus, these results demonstrate that, in this in vivo experimental model, growth properties of metastatic cells are organ- and cell type-specific. Additionally, we show that the in vitro proliferative behavior of tumor cells in the presence of bone-derived factors correlates and may predict skeletal tumor growth properties in vivo.",

The data of the determinations of sialic acid content and distribution on T-cells, using microanalytical methods such as HPLC and a colorimetric test, show that the total sialic acid content is increased by about 60% and that nearly 80-90% of the sialic acids consist of N-acetyl-9-O-acetyl-neuraminic acid, in comparison to the healthy controls (not containing O-acetylated neuraminic acid). Investigations on lymphocytes of malignant melanoma patients show similar changes of sialic acid content and distribution on the cell surface. Increased sialic acid levels are also found in the plasma of patients with cancer but no O-acetylated derivative can be found. Furthermore the examinations show that the separation of the T-lymphocytes from the total lymphocyte fraction is not required. Determination of sialic acids in the total lymphocyte fraction can be a simplification in carrying out further diagnostic investigations. A high level of sialic acids as \"antirecognition factor\" seems to be not only a marker of tumor cells but also an attribute of T-lymphocytes, involved in the defence against the malignoma (malignant melanoma, breast cancer).

Tumor-bearing mice were exposed to sham ELF-MFs and ELF-MFs (0.4 T, 7.5 Hz) 2 h/day for 27 days. Metastatic tumor burden of lung was significantly decreased after ELF-MF treatment. Compared to the control group, expressions of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP2, MMP9) and forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) in lung nodules significantly decreased in the ELF-MF group. Moreover, in vitro, after stimulated with anti-CD3, anti-CD28 antibodies and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and treated with ELF-MFs for 2 h, expression of Foxp3 in total T cells was significantly decreased. Differentiation rate of Treg cells was inhibited from 32.0% to 22.1% by ELF-MFs. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species (ROS) was increased and phospho-serine/threonine protein kinase (p-AKT) was inhibited in both T cells and Jurkat cells. ROS scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine reversed inhibition of AKT pathway and expression of Foxp3 from 18.6% to 26.6% in T cells. Taken together, our data show that ELF-MF exposure promoted the inhibitory effect of ROS on AKT pathway and decreased Foxp3 expression, which provides an explanation for why ELF-MF exposure can inhibit differentiation of Treg cells and enhance antitumor effect in metastatic melanoma mouse model.",

Generation of mice expressing enzymatically inactive VAP-1 showed that the oxidase activity of VAP-1 was necessary to support neoangiogenesis, myeloid cell recruitment, and tumor growth in vivo. These data describe VAP-1 as the first adhesion molecule known to be involved in the recruitment of Gr-1+CD11b+ myeloid cells into tumors.

Similarly, human NGR-TNF induced stronger antitumor effects than human TNF, even with 30 times lower doses. Coadministration of murine NGR-TNF with a CNGRC peptide or an anti-CD13 antibody markedly decreased its antitumor effects.

In addition, long-term survivor mice were protected against an RMA lymphoma tumor rechallenge. The B7H6-specific BiTE therapy also decreased tumor burden in murine melanoma and ovarian cancer models.

Patients with LSF of greater than 20% were deemed unsuitable for 90Y.;The study included 79 (21.5%) colorectal, 73 (20%) neuroendocrine, 70 (19.1%) HCC, 40 (10.9%) intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, 40 (10.9%) melanoma, 20 (5.5%) breast, and 44 (12%) other tumors including lung and pancreatic cancers. Lung shunt fractions of less than 10% and 10% to 20% were observed in 235 patients (64.2%) and 131 patients (35.8%), respectively. Median LSFs were as follows: colorectal cancer (7.60%), neuroendocrine tumor (7.01%), HCC (11.47%), cholangiocarcinoma (7.00%), melanoma (6.00%), breast cancer (7.00%), and others, including lung and pancreatic metastases to the liver (8.36%). The HCC median LSF was significantly higher than that in non-HCC tumors, 11.47% versus 7.10% (P < 0.001). High LSF (≥ 10%) in HCC correlated with poorer survival from first 90Y compared with low LSF (<10%; 4.5 vs 16.4 months, P = 0.003). Similarly, for metastatic disease, high LSF demonstrated significantly poorer survival compared with low LSF in colorectal liver metastases (13.5 vs 7.0 months, P = 0.013), neuroendocrine liver metastases (33.0 vs 9.1 months, P < 0.001), and melanoma liver metastases (12.0 vs 5.0 months, P = 0.03). No correlation between tumor burden on cross-sectional imaging and LSF was observed (r = 0.35).;In patients who are candidates for 90Y therapy, higher LSF is a poor prognostic factor for OS in HCC and metastatic liver tumors.",

Early detection of cancer at primary and metastatic sites by noninvasive imaging modalities would be beneficial for both therapeutic intervention and disease management. Noninvasive imaging modalities such as bioluminescence (optical), positron emission tomography (PET)/X-ray computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide complementary information and accurately measure tumor growth as confirmed by histopathology. Methods. We validated two metastatic tumor models, MDA-MD-231-Luc and B16-F10-Luc intravenously injected, and 4T1-Luc cells orthotopically implanted into the mammary fat pad. Longitudinal whole body bioluminescence imaging (BLI) evaluated metastasis, and tumor burden of the melanoma cell line (B16-F10-Luc) was correlated with (PET)/CT and MRI. In addition, ex vivo imaging evaluated metastasis in relevant organs and histopathological analysis was used to confirm imaging. Results. BLI revealed successful colonization of cancer cells in both metastatic tumor models over a 4-week period. Furthermore, lung metastasis of B16-F10-Luc cells imaged by PET/CT at week four showed a strong correlation (R (2) = 0.9) with histopathology. The presence and degree of metastasis as determined by imaging correlated (R (2) = 0.7) well with histopathology findings. Conclusions. We validated two metastatic tumor models by longitudinal noninvasive imaging with good histopathology correlation. ",

Documented elevated serum levels of VEGF were associated with a lethal hepatic syndrome characterized by massive sinusoidal dilation and endothelial cell proliferation and apoptosis. Systemic levels of VEGF correlated with the severity of liver pathology and overall clinical compromise. A striking reversal of VEGF-induced liver pathology and prolonged survival were achieved by surgical excision of VEGF-secreting tumor or by systemic administration of a potent VEGF antagonist (VEGF-TRAP(R1R2)), thus defining a paraneoplastic syndrome caused by excessive VEGF activity. Moreover, this VEGF-induced syndrome resembles peliosis hepatis, a rare human condition that is encountered in the setting of advanced malignancies, high-dose androgen therapy, and Bartonella henselae infection.

Bioluminescence imaging systems rely on a bioluminescent signal from tumor cells, typically generated from expression of the firefly luciferase gene. However, previous reports have suggested that either a high level of luciferase or the resultant light reaction produced upon addition of D-luciferin substrate can have a negative influence on tumor cell growth. To address this issue, we designed an expression vector that allows simultaneous fluorescence and luminescence imaging. Using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), we generated clonal cell populations from a human breast cancer (MCF-7) and a mouse melanoma (B16-F10) cell line that stably expressed different levels of luciferase. We then compared the growth capabilities of these clones in vitro by MTT proliferation assay and in vivo by bioluminescence imaging of tumor growth in live mice. Surprisingly, we found that neither the amount of luciferase nor biophotonic activity was sufficient to inhibit tumor cell growth, in vitro or in vivo. These results suggest that luciferase toxicity is not a necessary consideration when designing bioluminescence experiments, and therefore our approach can be used to rapidly generate high levels of luciferase expression for sensitive imaging experiments.",

Bropirimine alone was marginally active against some experimental tumors such as B16 melanoma but was ineffective against others such as P388 or L1210 leukemia. However, it produced statistically significant synergistic activity against P388 leukemia when used in combination with cyclophosphamide (CY). The aim of this investigation was to determine whether the synergism could be achieved with different types of cytotoxic drugs. Actinomycin D (act D), adriamycin, 5-azacytidine, cisplatin, melphalan, mitomycin C, and vincristine were selected. Using an experimental protocol identical to that of CY and bropirimine combination therapy, and using a more or less equally effective dosage of the drug for the initial reduction of tumor burden (i.e., around 100% increase of life span), cisplatin and bropirimine also produced a statistically significant synergism over the treatment with cisplatin alone. The combination of bropirimine with either adriamycin, mitomycin, or vincristine was beneficial but the effect was not as consistent or as striking as that seen with the CY and bropirimine combination. It is clear, however, that the combination of act D and bropirimine was not synergistic under the experimental conditions. Since the antitumor activity of pyrimidinone has been reported to be mediated in part by its stimulation of natural killer cell activity, the effect of these cytotoxic drugs on the immunomodulatory activity of bropirimine was investigated. Like CY, cisplatin did not alter the augmentation of natural killer cell activity by bropirimine. However, adriamycin, mitomycin, or vincristine showed a marked inhibition (25-50%) of the augmentation. Act D completely inhibited the immunomodulating activity of bropirimine 4 days after drug administration and continued to show marked inhibition 18 days later. This may partially explain the reasons for lack of synergism between act D and bropirimine. A prolonged immunosuppressive effect exhibited by act D and the degree of tumor repopulation during this period could render bropirimine ineffective. In addition to the magnitude of initial tumor burden reduction by the chemotherapeutic drugs, the present results indicate that the immunosuppressive property of these drugs may also affect the outcome of chemoimmunotherapy.",

Recently, it has become evident that P-cadherin contributes to the oncogenesis of many tumor types, including melanoma, prostate, breast, and colon carcinomas. Although cadherin switching is a crucial step in metastasis, the role of P-cadherin in colon cancer metastasis to the liver is unknown. In this study, we performed gene expression analysis and found that the level of P-cadherin was higher in tissue from liver metastases of colon cancer than in the corresponding primary colon cancer tissues. IHC analysis also showed that P-cadherin expression was significantly higher in liver metastases than in paired primary colorectal cancer tumors. Knockdown of P-cadherin in colon cancer cells inhibited wound healing, proliferation, and colony formation and resulted in developing fewer liver metastatic foci and reducing the tumor burden in vivo. Inhibition of P-cadherin expression also induced the up-regulation of E-cadherin and the down-regulation of β-catenin and its downstream target molecules, including survivin and c-Myc. In summary, these results uncover a novel function of P-cadherin in the regulation of colon cancer metastasis to the liver, suggesting that blocking the activity of P-cadherin or its associated signaling may be a valuable target for the treatment of hepatic metastases of colon carcinomas.",

FL mediated significant (p < or = 0.05) therapeutic activity against pulmonary metastases of the murine MC-38 colon adenocarcinoma, particularly when cytokine administration was initiated before tumor inoculation. However, progressive intraabdominal tumors sometimes were observed even in the relative absence of pulmonary metastases. Significant, although less dramatic, antimetastatic effects were observed with MCA-205 and MCA-102 sarcomas and D5 (B16BL6) melanoma. In contrast, FL was ineffective against subcutaneous MC-38 tumors or against several intracranial tumors. This suggests that besides the administration dose, the efficacy of this cytokine depends on the tumor type and possibly the location of the inoculated tumor. Antitumor activities of FL were abolished by whole-body irradiation (500 cGy) and partially abolished by systemic depletion of CD8, CD4, or natural killer cells.

Diseases for which ABMT is indicated are selected on the basis of sensitivity to escalation of drug and radiation dose. These diseases include non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, leukemia, small cell carcinoma of the lung, melanoma, neuroblastoma, metastatic breast cancer and Ewing's sarcoma.

Clinical trials of intensive therapy plus ABMT have produced encouraging results in terms of response rate and long-term survival for selected patients with poor-prognosis malignant diseases which are resistant or refractory to conventional forms of cancer therapy. When these preliminary results are analysed, it is apparent that the outcome of this treatment modality is affected by several factors such as disease status or tumor burden at the time of ABMT, the anti-tumor effect of the pretransplant intensive therapy and the extent of bone marrow invasion by tumor cells.

Despite the different modalities of cancer treatment, no effective curative therapy of metastatic lesions is available. To possess metastatic potential, a cell has to be able to invade the surrounding tissue, spread via lymphatics and/or the bloodstream, extravasate, and multiply at secondary sites. There is increasing evidence for a positive correlation between matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity and tumor cell invasion. Agents blocking MMP-2 have been shown to prevent tumor cell invasion in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of MMPs has, therefore, become the focus of considerable interest in connection with a variety of potential therapeutic applications. We have discovered a nontoxic MMP-2-selective inhibitor effective at nanomolar range on recombinant MMP.

IL-15 is a pleiotropic cytokine with important effects on cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems. The NK cell- and CD8(+) T cell-mediated functions of IL-15 against tumor cells have been well documented. However, it has not been established whether IL-15 has innate anti-tumor functions independent of these cells. Here, we explored the innate anti-tumor potential of IL-15 using a B16F10 melanoma tumor model. IL-15tg mice exhibited significantly more resistance to tumor growth and metastasis compared to B6 mice, and to IL-15(-/-) mice, which exhibited increased susceptibility to B16F10 challenge. In vivo depletion of NK cells and CD8(+) T cells abrogated the innate resistance to B16F10 cells in B6 but not in IL-15tg mice. In addition, lung macrophages from IL-15tg mice produced significantly higher levels of NO and IL-12 compared with macrophages from B6 or IL-15(-/-) mice. To examine whether IL-15 has innate anti-tumor activity independent of NK cells and CD8(+) T cells, we developed Ad-Op-hIL-15; this resulted in significantly higher levels of biologically active hIL-15. Delivery of Ad-Op-hIL-15 into RAG-2(-/-)/gamma(c)(-/-) mice significantly suppressed tumor burden in the lungs compared with the control adenovirus vector.

We designed a comprehensive approach to in situ immunization using poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-biodegradable microparticles (MPs) loaded with doxorubicin (Dox) and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG) that deliver Dox (chemotherapy) and CpG (immunotherapy) in a sustained-release fashion when injected intratumorally. Dox induces immunogenic tumor cell death while CpG enhances tumor antigen presentation by DCs. PLGA MPs allow their safe co-delivery while evading the vesicant action of Dox. In vitro, we show that Dox/CpG MPs can kill B and T lymphoma cells and are less toxic to DCs. In vivo, Dox/CpG MPs combined with antibody therapy to enhance and maintain the T cell response generated systemic immune responses that suppressed injected and distant tumors in a murine B lymphoma model, leading to tumor-free mice. The combination regimen was also effective at reducing T cell lymphoma and melanoma tumor burdens. In conclusion, Dox/CpG MPs represent an efficient and safe tool for in situ immunization that could provide a promising component of immunotherapy for patients with a variety of types of cancer. ",

Denileukin diftitox (DD)-mediated depletion of regulatory T cells significantly slowed EL4 growth in vivo in a T cell-dependent fashion.

Thus, there is a critical need for quantitative imaging methods to measure lymphatic flow. Indocyanine green (ICG) has been used for optical imaging of the lymphatic system, but it is unstable in solution and may rapidly enter venous capillaries after local injection. We developed a novel liposomal formulation of ICG (LP-ICG), resulting in vastly improved stability in solution and an increased fluorescence signal with a shift toward longer wavelength absorption and emission. When injected intradermally to mice, LP-ICG was specifically taken up by lymphatic vessels and allowed improved visualization of deep lymph nodes. In a genetic mouse model of lymphatic dysfunction, injection of LP-ICG showed no enhancement of draining lymph nodes and slower clearance from the injection site. In mice bearing B16 luciferase-expressing melanomas expressing vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C), sequential near-IR imaging of intradermally injected LP-ICG enabled quantification of lymphatic flow. Increased flow through draining lymph nodes was observed in mice bearing VEGF-C-expressing tumors without metastases, whereas a decreased flow pattern was seen in mice with a higher lymph node tumor burden. This new method will likely facilitate quantitative studies of lymphatic function in preclinical investigations and may also have potential for imaging of lymphedema or improved sentinel lymph detection in cancer.",

Fetal microchimeric cells (FMCs) engraft into the maternal bone marrow for decades after delivery and are able to migrate to blood and tissues. This phenomenon was hypothesized to have a detrimental role in autoimmune diseases, but data are still controversial and debated. In malignant tumors, fetal cell microchimerism has been postulated to have a positive effect on tumor burden, although some evidence suggests that FMCs may be involved in neoplastic progression. At the peripheral level, circulating FMCs are less frequently detected in patients with thyroid cancer, breast cancer or other solid, hematologic malignancies than in healthy individuals, which suggests a protective role for fetal cell microchimerism. In tissues, FMCs have been found in tumor sections from malignancies such as thyroid, breast, cervix, lung cancers and melanomas and have been shown to differentiate into epithelial, hematopoietic, endothelial and mesenchymal cells. FMCs with hematopoietic differentiation have been postulated to have a role in destroying the tumor, whereas mesenchymal and epithelial cells could participate in repair processes. Endothelial cells, on the other hand, are believed to play a part in tumor progression. This Review provides an overview of the role of fetal cell microchimerism in autoimmune and benign or malignant nonautoimmune diseases. Moreover, the mechanisms by which fetal cell microchimerism is believed to modulate the protection against cancer or tumor progression will be discussed, together with future research directions.",

Less is known about the functions of the structurally related receptor ERBB3 (HER3) in the skin. We assessed the requirement of ERBB3 for skin homeostasis, wound healing, and tumorigenesis by crossing mice carrying a conditional Erbb3 allele with animals expressing cre under the control of the keratin 5 promoter. Erbb3(del) mice, lacking ERBB3 specifically in keratinocytes, showed no obvious abnormalities. The EGFR was upregulated in Erbb3(del) skin, possibly compensating the loss of ERBB3. Nonetheless, healing of full-thickness excisional wounds was negatively affected by ERBB3 deficiency. To analyze the function of ERBB3 during tumorigenesis, we employed the established DMBA/TPA multi-stage chemical carcinogenesis protocol. Erbb3(del) mice remained free of papillomas for a longer time and had significantly reduced tumor burden compared to control littermates. Tumor cell proliferation was considerably reduced in Erbb3(del) mice, and loss of ERBB3 also impaired keratinocyte proliferation after a single application of TPA. In human skin tumor samples, upregulated ERBB3 expression was observed in squamous cell carcinoma, condyloma, and malignant melanoma. Thus, we conclude that ERBB3, while dispensable for the development and the homeostasis of the epidermis and its appendages, is required for proper wound healing and for the progression of skin tumors during multi-stage chemical carcinogenesis in mice. ERBB3 may also be important for human skin cancer progression. The latter effects most probably reflect a key role for ERBB3 in increasing cell proliferation after stimuli as wounding or carcinogenesis. ",

A new method to non-invasively measure tumor burden, as yet untested to monitor spontaneous metastases, is the use of transplanted tumors expressing secretable human beta-chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) that can be measured in urine. We describe examples of beta-hCG-transfected tumor cell lines for evaluating the effect of different therapies on metastatic disease, which in some cases involved monitoring tumor growth for >100 days. We used beta-hCG-tagged mouse B16 melanoma and erbB-2/Her-2-expressing human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 models, and drug treatments included metronomic low-dose cyclophosphamide chemotherapy with or without a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2-targeting antibody (DC101) or trastuzumab, the erbB-2/Her-2-targeting antibody. Both experimental and spontaneous metastasis models were studied; in the latter case, an increase in urine beta-hCG always foreshadowed the development of lung, liver, brain, and kidney metastases. Metastatic disease was unresponsive to DC101 or trastuzumab monotherapy treatment, as assessed by beta-hCG levels. Our results also suggest that beta-hCG levels may be set as an end point for metastasis studies, circumventing guidelines, which have often hampered the use of advanced disease models.

Using a B16-F10 murine melanoma model in C57BL/6 mice, we previously demonstrated that aerosol delivery of PEI-p53 DNA resulted in highly significant reductions in the tumor burden (P < .001) in treated animals, and also lead to about 50% increase in the mean length of survival of the mice-bearing B16-F10 lung tumors. The mechanisms of this antitumor effect of p53 are investigated in this report. Here, we demonstrate that the p53 transfection leads to an up-regulation of the antiangiogenic factor thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) in the lung tissue and the serum of the mice. Furthermore, there is a down-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the lung tissue and serum of the B16-F10 tumor-bearing mice treated with PEI-p53 DNA complexes, compared with untreated tumor-bearing animals. In addition, staining for von Willebrand factor (vWF), a marker for the angiogenic blood vessels, revealed that p53 treatment leads to a decrease in the angiogenic phenotype of the B16-F10 tumors. Immunohistochemistry for transgene expression reveals that the PEI-p53 aerosol complexes transfect mainly the epithelial cells lining the airways, with diffuse transfection in the alveolar lining cells, as well as, the tumor foci in the lung tissue. There was also some evidence of apoptosis in the lung tumor foci of animals treated with p53.

When Nmd CH3transferase activity of rat hepatocytes in primary culture was investigated with the addition of dexamethasone, epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and N1-methylnicotinamide (1-CH3Nmd), changes in activity were not correlated with DNA synthesis, suggesting that the increase of this enzyme activity in the tumor host liver was not directly related to liver cell proliferation. Thus, in order to make use of the increase of this enzyme activity as a tumor burden marker, a procedure for its estimation by measuring the blood level of 1-CH3Nmd, a metabolite of Nmd produced by Nmd CH3transferase, was established. The 1-CH3Nmd level in the blood of mice bearing Ehrlich ascites tumor 4 h after s.c. loading of Nmd (500 mg/kg body weight) was closely correlated with this enzyme activity in the liver (r = 0.835, P less than 0.00001) from the early to the terminal stage of tumor development. Furthermore, similar correlations were seen in the animal groups bearing various other tumors, such as s.c. implanted Ehrlich ascites tumor (solid form) and i.p. implanted sarcoma S-180, hepatoma MH-134, Yoshida ascites sarcoma and leukemia L-1210, but not solid tumors such as Lewis lung carcinoma and melanoma B-16, although almost all of the animals bearing these tumors showed a higher enzyme activity than their control normal animals.",

This feed-forward stimulation increased apoptosis in MDA cells. Here, we tested whether TRAIL-expressing hMSCs, in combination with a sub-toxic-dose of a chemotherapy drug doxorubicin, would overcome TRAIL resistance and create synergistic effects on targeting metastatic TNBC.;To optimize conditions for the combination treatment, we (i) selected an optimal condition to activate hMSCs for TRAIL expression, (ii) selected an optimal dose of doxorubicin treatment, (iii) examined underlying mechanisms in vitro and (iv) tested the efficacy of the optimized conditions in a xenograft mouse model of human breast cancer lung metastasis.;The results showed that DNA fragments from apoptotic MDA triggered hMSCs to increase further TRAIL expression in an absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2)-dependent manner, and thus higher TRAIL-expressing hMSCs stimulated with synthetic DNA, poly(deoxyadenylic-deoxythymidylic) acid [poly(dA:dT)], more effectively suppressed tumor progression in vivo. Furthermore, activated hMSCs increased apoptosis in MDA cells when combined with a sub-toxic dose of doxorubicin, which was mediated by up-regulating TRAIL and Fas-related pathways. When we combined the optimized conditions, pre-activated hMSCs with poly (dA:dT) synergistically reduced tumor burden even with minimal doxorubicin treatment in a xenograft mouse model of human breast cancer lung metastasis.;These results suggest that the treatment of hMSCs with a sub-toxic dose of doxorubicin can overcome TRAIL resistance and be a potential novel therapy for TNBC metastasis treatment.",

Targeted oncolytic virotherapy has demonstrated promise in preclinical studies, and more than ten viral species have subsequently entered clinical trials. JX-594 has been modified to augment the intrinsic targeting and oncolytic potential of the vaccinia virus and to enhance antitumor immunity by the expression of the GM-CSF transgene in situ. In vitro and in vivo animal studies have demonstrated the replication specificity of JX-594 for cancer cell lines and tumors, and the restriction of serum human GM-CSF expression to tumor-bearing animals, resulting in significantly reduced tumor burden and an increase in median survival. In phase I trials, JX-594 was well tolerated, with mild systemic toxicity reported. In a phase I trial in seven patients with melanoma, one partial response and one complete response after surgery were observed. In another phase I trial in patients with hepatic carcinoma, three out of ten evaluable patients had a partial response and six had stable disease; the MTD was also established. A phase II trial in patients (expected n = 30) with unresectable primary hepatocellular carcinoma was recruiting at the time of publication, with completion expected in March 2010, and a phase III trial in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma was planned for the second half of 2010.

Furthermore, predictors of outcome in sentinel lymph node positive Merkel cell carcinoma patients are poorly defined. In breast carcinoma, isolated immunohistochemically positive tumor cells have no impact, but in melanoma they are considered significant. The significance of sentinel lymph node metastasis tumor burden (including isolated tumor cells) and pattern of involvement in Merkel cell carcinoma are unknown. In this study, 64 Merkel cell carcinomas involving sentinel lymph nodes and corresponding immunohistochemical stains were reviewed and clinicopathological predictors of outcome were sought. Five metastatic patterns were identified: (1) sheet-like (n=38, 59%); (2) non-solid parafollicular (n=4, 6%); (3) sinusoidal, (n=11, 17%); (4) perivascular hilar (n=1, 2%); and (5) rare scattered parenchymal cells (n=10, 16%). At the time of follow-up, 30/63 (48%) patients had died with 21 (33%) attributable to Merkel cell carcinoma. Patients with pattern 1 metastases had poorer overall survival compared with patients with patterns 2-5 metastases (P=0.03), with 22/30 (73%) deaths occurring in pattern 1 patients. Three (10%) deaths occurred in patients showing pattern 5, all of whom were immunosuppressed. Four (13%) deaths occurred in pattern 3 patients and 1 (3%) death occurred in a pattern 2 patient. In multivariable analysis, the number of positive sentinel lymph nodes (1 or 2 versus >2, P<0.0001), age (<70 versus ≥70, P=0.01), sentinel lymph node metastasis pattern (patterns 2-5 versus 1, P=0.02), and immune status (immunocompetent versus suppressed, P=0.03) were independent predictors of outcome, and could be used to stratify Stage III patients into three groups with markedly different outcomes. In Merkel cell carcinoma, the pattern of sentinel lymph node involvement provides important prognostic information and utilizing this data with other clinicopathological features facilitates risk stratification of Merkel cell carcinoma patients who may have management implications.

        "Doc_abstract":"Tumor progression depends on the support of cells in the microenvironment, and is driven in part by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS can damage DNA, and the repair of damaged DNA is a well-known process involved in tumor initiation and promotion, but the role of DNA repair in tumor progression is not fully understood. In this regard the X-ray cross complementing 1 (XRCC1) protein is known to orchestrate the assembly of repair complexes at sites of DNA single strand breaks either directly or indirectly through repair of damaged bases, largely as the result of ROS-induced damage. XRCC1 polymorphisms have been shown to be associated with increased cancer. It was therefore of interest to investigate the effect of XRCC1 gene mutations on cancer progression. In an attempt to make XRCC1 point mutant mice, we generated a truncated protein (XRCC1tp) by the insertion of a neomycin cassette in intron12 of the XRCC1 gene. This unique finding allowed us to investigate cellular and tumor progression phenotypes in mice associated with expression and function of an altered XRCC1 protein on one allele. XRCC1tp cells showed increased toxicity to MMS, enhanced MMS-induced depletion of NADH suggesting increased PARP activity, and normal functional repair of MMS-induced DNA damage. Six months following treatment with the alkylating carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM) at 10 mg/kg once a week for 6 weeks, XRCC1tp mice had a decrease in average colon tumor volume of 14±3 mm(3) compared to 34±4 mm(3) in WT littermates (p ≤ 0.03, N= 20/genotype). XRCC1tp mice had a 72 per cent decrease in B16 melanoma tumor burden compared to wt littermates. Average tumor volume in transgenic PyMT metastatic breast cancer mice expressing XRCC1tp was 359 cubic mm in PyMT mice expressing XRCC1tp compared to 730 cubic mm in PyMT mice expressing XRCC1wt (p ≤ 0.001, N= 20/genotype). These data suggest that the presence of an XRCC1 truncated protein alters XRCC1 function independent of DNA repair, and is associated with anti-tumor activity.",

        "Doc_abstract":"In spite of widespread anecdotal and scientific evidence much remains to be understood about the long-suspected connection between psychological factors and susceptibility to cancer. The skin is the most common site of cancer, accounting for nearly half of all cancers in the US, with approximately 2-3 million cases of non-melanoma cancers occurring each year worldwide. We hypothesized that a high-anxious, stress-prone behavioral phenotype would result in a higher chronic stress burden, lower protective-immunity, and increased progression of the immuno-responsive skin cancer, squamous cell carcinoma. SKH1 mice were phenotyped as high- or low-anxious at baseline, and subsequently exposed to ultraviolet-B light (1 minimal erythemal dose (MED), 3 times/week, 10-weeks). The significant strengths of this cancer model are that it uses a normal, immunocompetent, outbred strain, without surgery/injection of exogenous tumor cells/cell lines, and produces lesions that resemble human tumors. Tumors were counted weekly (primary outcome), and tissues collected during early and late phases of tumor development. Chemokine/cytokine gene-expression was quantified by PCR, tumor-infiltrating helper (Th), cytolytic (CTL), and regulatory (Treg) T cells by immunohistochemistry, lymph node T and B cells by flow cytometry, adrenal and plasma corticosterone and tissue vascular-endothelial-growth-factor (VEGF) by ELISA. High-anxious mice showed a higher tumor burden during all phases of tumor development. They also showed: higher corticosterone levels (indicating greater chronic stress burden), increased CCL22 expression and Treg infiltration (increased tumor-recruited immuno-suppression), lower CTACK/CCL27, IL-12, and IFN-γ gene-expression and lower numbers of tumor infiltrating Th and CTLs (suppressed protective immunity), and higher VEGF concentrations (increased tumor angiogenesis/invasion/metastasis). These results suggest that the deleterious effects of high trait anxiety could be: exacerbated by life-stressors, accentuated by the stress of cancer diagnosis/treatment, and mediate increased tumor progression and/or metastasis. Therefore, it may be beneficial to investigate the use of chemotherapy-compatible anxiolytic treatments immediately following cancer diagnosis, and during cancer treatment/survivorship.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is a widely accepted method for staging breast cancer and melanoma, and it has recently been proposed as a means of improving staging in colorectal cancer. However, lymphatic mapping in colorectal cancer has been plagued by studies demonstrating high false-negative rates. The purpose of this study was to evaluate possible mechanisms for high false-negative rates after SLN biopsy in colorectal cancer. We hypothesized that poor accuracy may be due to bulky tumor or complete replacement of lymph nodes by tumor.;Patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma underwent standard colorectal resection with lymphatic mapping. At operation, 1 mL of isosulfan blue dye was injected at the tumor site, using either an in vivo or an ex vivo technique. Routine pathological evaluation was performed. The sentinel node was examined by hematoxylin and eosin stains, and if these results were negative, by cytokeratin immunohistochemistry. The patient's age, operation type, tumor stage, tumor diameter, method of SLN detection, presence of palpable nodes, and pathological description of nodes completely replaced by tumor were recorded.;Fifty patients (mean age, 62.8, 50% men) undergoing colorectal cancer resection underwent 51 lymphatic mapping procedures. Right- and left-sided colorectal resections were almost equally distributed (48% vs 42%). SLNs were successfully identified in 47 of 51 specimens (92%). The mean number of SLNs obtained from each specimen was 1.5 (range, 1-5). Routine pathological evaluation demonstrated lymph node metastasis in 20 of the 47 patients (43%) who had an SLN identified. The SLN was positive for metastasis in 10 of these 20 patients (50%). Ten of 20 patients with metastatic disease had a negative SLN, resulting in a false-negative rate of 50%. The false-negative rate was significantly higher in patients undergoing left-sided procedures versus right-sided procedures. Differences among gender, tumor stage, tumor diameter, method of SLN detection, presence of palpable nodes, and pathological description of nodes completely replaced by tumor were not associated with a higher false-negative rate.;Identification of the SLN in colorectal cancer is technically possible in more than 90% of patients. However, SLN status correlates poorly with the true nodal status of the colorectal cancer, and the false-negative rate is 50%. This high false-negative rate is not clearly explained by extensive tumor burden, and it was also independent of gender, tumor stage, and type of lymphatic mapping technique. However, staging accuracy was lower in patients who underwent left-sided colorectal resection. Further studies are needed to clarify the limitations of lymphatic mapping in colorectal cancer.",

The goal of this review was to evaluate the use of yttrium-90 hepatic arterial therapy in the management of hepatic metastases and surgical downstaging.;We reviewed our prospective hepatic arterial therapy registry and found 44 patients who had received Sir Sphere treatment for unresectable hepatic malignancies from 11/06 to 7/08. Response was assessed by using CT-imaging and characterized using modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST). All patients were managed in a multidisciplinary tertiary referral center specializing in hepatic malignancies.;A total of 44 patients, 34 men and 10 women, with a median age of 60 y (range 44-8), received 67 treatments. The disease types treated were one adenosquamous tongue, one adrenal, nine carcinoid, three cholangiocarcinoma, four esophageal, one gastric, one gastrinoma, one GIST, four HCC, 15 colorectal, one melanoma, one non-small-cell lung, one occular, and one sarcoma. Four patients treated proceeded to resection because of downstaging of disease or no evidence of extrahepatic progression. The median age in these patients was 61 y (range 49-62). All of the patients had less than 25% tumor burden in the liver. Surgical therapy consisted of two patients undergoing right hepatic lobectomy, one patient who also underwent two wedge resections of segment 3, and one patient who had a left lateral hepatectomy with right lobe microwave ablation. The median length of postoperative stay was 7 d. There was no evidence of liver dysfunction following resection in any of the patients. None of the patients show evidence of recurrence in the liver following resection. One patient has had progression of disease in the lungs following resection, histologically confirmed as metastatic rectal carcinoma. All of the patients are currently alive with a median survival of 2 y.;Hepatic directed yttrium-90 is a minimally invasive, highly effective therapy that can be utilized to downstage the hepatic burden and/or assess the biology of the disease to allow for appropriate treatment. The use of yttrium-90 microspheres for radio-embolization of metastases in the liver can successfully downstage the lesions to allow for surgical resection in patients with amenable predictors, and can provide a significantly better prognosis in these patients.
