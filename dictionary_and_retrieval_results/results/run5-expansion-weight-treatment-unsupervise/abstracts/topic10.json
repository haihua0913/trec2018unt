        "Doc_abstract":"Point mutations in the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase gene have recently been identified in mucosal, acral lentiginous, and chronically sun-damaged melanomas. We have identified the first human melanoma cell line with an endogenous L576P mutation, the most common KIT mutation in melanoma ( approximately 30-40%). In vitro testing showed that the cell viability of the L576P mutant cell line was not reduced by imatinib, nilotinib, or sorafenib small molecule KIT inhibitors effective in nonmelanoma cells with other KIT mutations. However, the viability of the mutant cells was reduced by dasatinib at concentrations as low as 10 nM (P = 0.004). Molecular modeling studies found that the L576P mutation induces structural changes in KIT that reduce the affinity for imatinib (DeltaDeltaGbind = -2.52 kcal/mol) but not for dasatinib (DeltaDeltaGbind = +0.32 kcal/mol). Two metastatic melanoma patients with the L576P KIT mutation were treated with dasatinib, including one patient previously treated with imatinib. Both patients had marked reduction (>50%) and elimination of tumor F18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avidity by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging after dasatinib treatment. These data support the selective inhibitory effect of dasatinib against cells harboring the most common KIT mutation in melanoma, and thus has therapeutic implications for acrallentiginous, chronic sun-damaged, and mucosal melanomas.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Activating mutations in the BRAF kinase have been reported in a large number of cases of malignant melanoma. This suggests that therapy with specific RAF kinase inhibitors may find use in treating this disease. If the response to RAF kinase inhibition is dependent on the presence of an activated BRAF protein, it will be necessary to evaluate cases of malignant melanoma for the presence or absence of BRAF mutations. High-resolution amplicon melting analysis is able to detect single base-pair changes in DNA isolated from paraffin-embedded tissue sections and obviates the need for direct DNA sequencing. Results can be available within 48 hours. In this report, we used high-resolution amplicon melting analysis to evaluate 90 cases of malignant melanoma for BRAF mutations. Of these 90 cases, 74 were metastatic melanomas, 12 were primary cutaneous melanomas, and 4 were in situ melanomas. BRAF activation mutations were found in 43 cases (48%). Forty-one of these mutations were in exon 15. The mutations in exon 15 included V600E (34 cases), V600K (6 cases), and V600R (1 case). Two activating mutations were found in exon 11, G469V and G469R. The presence or absence of a BRAF mutation in the junctional component of an invasive melanoma was maintained in the invasive component. We also evaluated these 90 cases, as well as an additional 10 cases (total of 100) for the expression of c-kit. The majority of invasive and metastatic malignant melanomas did not express c-kit, although all in situ lesions and the junctional components of invasive lesions were strongly c-kit positive. Surprisingly, 2 cases of metastatic malignant melanoma (2%) showed strong and diffuse c-kit expression and contained a c-kit-activating mutation, L576P, as detected by high-resolution amplicon melting analysis and confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. These 2 c-kit mutation-positive cases did not contain BRAF mutations. The presence of a c-kit-activating mutation in metastatic malignant melanoma suggests that a small number of melanomas may progress by a somatic mutation of the c-kit gene. The presence of BRAF- and c-kit-activating mutations in malignant melanoma suggests new approaches to treating this disease involving specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors may prove worthwhile and that mutation analysis by high-resolution melting analysis might help guide therapy.",

No driver mutations related to the MAPK cascade including RAS and BRAF were detected in the chronically sun-damaged (CSD) group of melanoma. Dual or triple driver mutations were found in four of 40 (10%) samples from the primary melanomas, and three of 37 (8%) of the metastatic melanomas. Fourteen of 26 (54%) samples of non-CSD melanoma, and 3 of 6 (50%) melanomas of unknown primary origin had the BRAF V600E mutation. Mutations in membrane-bound receptors including KIT, ERBB4 and EPHB6 were detected in 8 of 77 (10%) samples. Of 17 pairs of primary and metastatic melanomas from the same patient, the primary mutation pattern was changed to a novel one in three cases, and only one of the plural mutations in the primary melanoma was found in the metastatic lesions in two cases.;BRAF V600E is a predominant mutation in non-CSD melanoma and melanomas of unknown primary origin. Mutational heterogeneity may exist in the primary melanoma (intra-tumor heterogeneity), and between the primary and metastatic lesions (inter-tumor heterogeneity).",

        "Doc_abstract":"Patients with metastatic melanoma have a poor prognosis and few treatment options are available. We evaluated the anti-tumor activity and safety of nilotinib, a KIT inhibitor, in patients with metastatic melanoma harboring KIT alterations, either mutations or amplifications.;This study was open-label, single center, prospective phase II clinical trial. Between October 2009 and April 2011, 11 patients with metastatic melanoma harboring KIT gene mutations or KIT gene amplifications were enrolled in the first stage of phase II study and nilotinib was administered orally at a dose of 400 mg twice a day until disease progression or intolerable toxicities. The primary endpoint was response rate and secondary endpoints were safety, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).;Of 11 patients, 9 patients were evaluable for treatment response. Of 9 patients, three patients had KIT mutations in exon 11, Leu576Pro, Val559Ala and Lys558Arg; and 6 patients had KIT amplifications > 50 copies compared to control DNA. Two patients achieved partial response (22.2%) and 5 patients achieved stable disease (55.6%). In two patients who responded to nilotinib, both had KIT mutations and showed durable response for 8.4 months and 10.0+ months. Of note, one patient with KIT amplification had stable disease with response for 6 months. A decrease in tumor size from baseline was observed in four patients (44.4%). Nilotinib 800 mg/d was very well tolerated with grade 1 nausea and grade 1 dry-eye being the most common adverse events.;We have decided to publish the preliminary results because anti-tumor activity of nilotinib was promising in KIT mutated patients. Although our results are preliminary, nilotinib had very favorable toxicity profile with durable response in metastatic melanoma patients with KIT mutations. The anti-tumor activity of nilotinib in melanoma patients with KIT amplification is yet to be determined in future studies. Currently, phase II nilotinib trial is ongoing in Korea as multi-center study.",

        "Doc_abstract":"A subgroup of testicular seminomas has been reported to contain activating mutations in KIT, the transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor encoded by the c-kit gene. Most mutations are in exon 17, although exon 11-activating mutations have recently been described. For patients refractory to standard therapeutic protocols for seminoma, the presence of c-kit-activating mutations in some of these neoplasms might suggest an alternative therapy with KIT targeting drugs. We used the novel mutation scanning technique, high-resolution melting amplicon analysis, to screen a series of 22 testicular seminomas for c-kit-activating mutations. Four cases (18%) had exon 17-activating mutations and these included D816Y, D816V, Y823N and one case that contained both D816E and D820H. A single case (5%) had an exon 11-activating mutation. Interestingly, the exon 11-activating mutation was L576P, the same mutation that characterizes the rare c-kit mutation-positive cases of malignant melanoma. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for c-kit suggested that most seminomas are probably polysomic for c-kit and there was not a significant difference in c-kit FISH characteristics between the mutation-positive and mutation-negative cases. The use of high-resolution melting amplicon analysis as a screening technique will allow for the rapid identification of patients with testicular seminomas whose tumors contain c-kit-activating mutations. This could benefit patients whose tumors are refractory to standard therapeutic protocols.",
