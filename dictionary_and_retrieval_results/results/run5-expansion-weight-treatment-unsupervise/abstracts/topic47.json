        "Doc_abstract":"PTEN mutations are among the most frequent genetic alterations found in human prostate cancers. Our previous works suggest that although precancerous lesions were found in Pten heterozygous mice, cancer progression and metastasis only happened when both alleles of Pten were deleted. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of PTEN in prostate cancer control, we generated two pairs of isogenic, androgen receptor (AR)-positive prostate epithelial lines from intact conditional Pten knock-out mice that are either heterozygous (PTEN-P2 and -P8) or homozygous (PTEN-CaP2 and PTEN-CaP8) for Pten deletion. Further characterization of these cells showed that loss of the second allele of Pten leads to increased anchorage-independent growth in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo without obvious structural or numerical chromosome changes based on SKY karyotyping analysis. Despite no prior exposure to hormone ablation therapy, Pten null cells are tumorigenic in both male and female severe combined immunodeficiency mice. Furthermore, knocking down PTEN can convert the androgen-dependent Myc-CaP cell into androgen independence, suggesting that PTEN intrinsically controls androgen responsiveness, a critical step in the development of hormone refractory prostate cancer. Importantly, knocking down AR by shRNA in Pten null cells reverses androgen-independent growth in vitro and partially inhibited tumorigenesis in vivo, indicating that PTEN-controlled prostate tumorigenesis is AR dependent. These cell lines will serve as useful tools for understanding signaling pathways controlled by PTEN and elucidating the molecular mechanisms involved in hormone refractory prostate cancer formation.",

Conversely, the upregulation of the chemokine (CXC) receptor 4 (CXCR4) is associated with prostate cancer progression and metastasis. Studies have shown that loss of PTEN permits CXCR4-mediated functions in prostate cancer cells. Loss of PTEN function is typically due to genetic and epigenetic modulations, as well as active site oxidation by reactive oxygen species (ROS); likewise ROS upregulates CXCR4 expression. Herein, we show that ROS accumulation permitted CXCR4-mediated functions through PTEN catalytic inactivation. ROS increased p-AKT and CXCR4 expression, which were abrogated by a ROS scavenger in prostate cancer cells. ROS mediated PTEN inactivation but did not affect expression, yet enhanced cell migration and invasion in a CXCR4-dependent manner. Collectively, our studies add to the body of knowledge on the regulatory role of PTEN in CXCR4-mediated cancer progression, and hopefully, will contribute to the development of therapies that target the tumor microenvironment, which have great potential for the better management of a metastatic disease.",

Here, we investigated how the PTEN genotype affected the antitumor effect of NVP-BEZ235 in human prostate cancer cells. In this setting, NVP-BEZ235 induced cell death in a PTEN-independent manner. NVP-BEZ235 selectively induced apoptotic cell death in the prostate cancer cell line DU145, which harbors wild-type PTEN; however, in the PC3 cell line, which is PTEN-null, treatment with NVP-BEZ235 resulted in autophagic cell death. Consistently, NVP-BEZ235 treatment did not result in the cleavage of caspase-3; instead, it resulted in the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, indicating autophagic cell death; these results suggest that an alternate mechanism of cell death is induced by NVP-BEZ235 in PTEN-null prostate cancer cells.

Many prostate cancers harbor inactivating PTEN mutations, enhancing Akt phosphorylation. This activates the principal antiapoptotic pathway downstream of the IGF1R, calling into question the value of IGF1R targeting in this tumor. The aim of the current study was to assess the effect of IGF1R gene silencing in prostate cancer cells that lack functional PTEN protein. In human DU145, LNCaP and PC3 prostate cancer cells, transfection with IGF1R small interfering RNA induced significant enhancement of apoptosis and inhibition of survival, not only in PTEN wild-type DU145 but also in PTEN mutant LNCaP and PC3. This was attributed to attenuation of IGF signaling via Akt, ERKs and p38. In both DU145 and PC3, IGF1R knockdown led to enhancement of sensitivity to mitoxantrone, etoposide, nitrogen mustard and ionizing radiation. There was no sensitization to paclitaxel or 5-fluorouracil, which do not damage DNA, suggesting that chemosensitization results from impairment of the DNA damage response, in addition to removal of apoptosis protection. These results support the concept of IGF1R targeting in prostate cancer, and indicate that PTEN loss does not render tumor cells refractory to this strategy.",

These observations support the hypothesis that AR isoform accumulation is a consequence of selective therapeutic pressure on the full length AR. The Pten deficient prostate cancer model proceeds with well-defined kinetics including progression to castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). While surgical castration and enzalutamide treatments yield an initial therapeutic response, Pten-/-epithelia continue to proliferate yielding locally invasive primary tumor pathology. That most epithelium remains AR positive, but ligand independent, suggests the presence of oncogenic AR variants. To address this hypothesis, we have used a panel of recently described Pten-/- tumor cell lines derived from both from hormone intact (E4, E8) and castrated Pten mutants (cE1, cE2) followed by RACE PCR to identify and characterize three novel truncated, amino terminus containing AR variants (mAR-Va, b, c). Variants appear not only conserved throughout progression but are correlated with nearly complete loss of full length AR (AR-FL) at castrate androgen levels. The overexpression of variants leads to enhanced transcriptional activity of AR while knock down studies show reduced transcriptional output. Collectively, the identification of truncated AR variants in the conditional PTEN deletion model supports a role for maintaining the CRPC phenotype and provides further therapeutic applications of this preclinical model.

Loss of PTEN function is associated with constitutive survival signaling through the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt pathway. Therefore, we asked if reconstitution of PTEN function would lead to the reversal of resistance to apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Adenovirus-mediated expression of PTEN completely suppressed constitutive Akt activation in LNCaP prostate cancer cells and enhanced apoptosis induced by a broad range of apoptotic stimuli. PTEN expression sensitized cells to death receptor-mediated apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor, anti-Fas antibody, and TRAIL. PTEN also sensitized cells to non-receptor mediated apoptosis induced by a kinase inhibitor staurosporine and chemotherapeutic agents mitoxantrone and etoposide. PTEN-mediated apoptosis was accompanied by caspase-3 and caspase-8 activation and was inhibited by a broad specificity caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk. Bcl-2 overexpression also blocked PTEN-mediated apoptosis. Lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN is required for apoptosis as the PTEN G129E mutant selectively deficient in lipid phosphatase activity was unable to sensitize cells to apoptosis. PTEN-mediated apoptosis involves a FADD-dependent pathway for both death receptor-mediated and drug-induced apoptosis as coexpression of a dominant negative FADD mutant blocked PTEN-mediated apoptosis. Since in death receptor signaling, FADD mediates activation of caspase-8, which in turn cleaves BID, and since caspase-8 is activated in PTEN-mediated apoptosis, we examined BID cleavage in PTEN-mediated apoptosis. PTEN facilitated BID cleavage after treatment with low doses of staurosporine and mitoxantrone. BID cleavage was inhibited by dominant negative FADD. Taken together, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that PTEN promotes drug-induced apoptosis by facilitating caspase-8 activation and BID cleavage through a FADD-dependent pathway.",

The authors examined PTEN and additional protein markers in primary tumors from patients with high-risk, localized prostate cancer who received adjuvant docetaxel in a prospective multicenter trial (TAX2501).;Fifty-six of 77 patients enrolled in TAX2501 had primary prostatectomy specimens available for immunohistochemical analysis of PTEN, MYC, ERG, tumor protein p53 (p53), antigen KI-67 (Ki67), and phosphorylated forms of Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and S6 ribosomal protein. Protocol-defined progression included a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level ≥ 0.4 ng/mL, radiologic/clinical recurrence, or death. Univariate and multivariable proportional hazards regression analyses were used to investigate the influence of PTEN status (and other protein markers) on progression-free survival (PFS).;In this exploratory, post hoc analysis, PTEN protein loss (vs presence) was observed in 61% of patients and was associated with lower preoperative PSA levels, higher clinical stage, lower Ki67 expression, the presence of p53, and the presence of ERG. In univariate analysis, the factors associated with PFS included Gleason sum, seminal vesicle invasion, PTEN status, MYC expression, and Ki67 expression. In multivariable analysis, only 3 variables emerged as independent prognostic factors for PFS: PTEN status (P = .035), MYC expression (P = .001), and Ki67 expression (P < .001). A prognostic model was constructed that incorporated clinical covariates as well as information on PTEN, MYC, and Ki67.;The current results indicated that PTEN status, MYC expression, and Ki67 expression in primary tumor samples may predict PFS more accurately than clinical factors alone in men with high-risk prostate cancer who receive adjuvant docetaxel after prostatectomy. If validated, these hypothesis-generating findings may have prognostic and therapeutic implications and may aid clinical trial design.",

This pathway is constitutively active and drives prostate cancer (PCa) progression to advanced metastatic disease. PTEN, a critical tumor and metastasis suppressor gene negatively regulates cell survival, proliferation, migration and angiogenesis via the PI3K/Akt pathway. PTEN is mutated, downregulated/dysfunctional in many cancers and its dysregulation correlates with poor prognosis in PCa. Here, we demonstrate that microRNA-4534 (miR-4534) is overexpressed in PCa and show that miR-4534 is hypermethylated in normal tissues and cell lines compared to PCa tissues/cells. miR-4534 exerts its oncogenic effects partly by downregulating the tumor suppressor PTEN gene. Knockdown of miR-4534 impaired cell proliferation, migration/invasion and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in PCa. Suppression of miR-4534 and its effects on tumor growth was confirmed in a xenograft mouse model. We performed parallel experiments in non-cancer RWPE1 cells by overexpessing miR-4534 followed by functional assays. Overexpression of miR-4534 induced pro-cancerous characteristics in this non-cancer cell line. Statistical analyses revealed that miR-4534 has potential to independently distinguish malignant from normal tissues and positively correlated with poor overall and PSA recurrence free survival. Taken together, our results show that depletion of miR-4534 in PCa induces a tumor suppressor phenotype partly through induction of PTEN. These results have important implications for identifying and defining the role of new PTEN regulators such as microRNAs in prostate tumorigenesis. Understanding aberrantly overexpressed miR-4534 and its downregulation of PTEN will provide mechanistic insight and therapeutic targets for PCa therapy.",

Although the importance of dietary stilbenes such as resveratrol and pterostilbene as anti-cancer agents is well recognized, our understanding of their miRNA-targeting capabilities is still limited. In our previous study, we reported that resveratrol downregulates PTEN-targeting members of the oncogenic miR-17 family, which are overexpressed in prostate cancer. This study investigates the resveratrol and pterostilbene induced miRNA-mediated regulation of PTEN in prostate cancer. Here, we show that both compounds decrease the levels of endogenous as well as exogenously expressed miR-17, miR-20a and miR-106b thereby upregulating their target PTEN. Using functional luciferase reporter assays, we demonstrate that ectopically expressed miR-17, miR-20a and miR-106b directly target PTEN 3'UTR to reduce its expression, an effect rescued upon treatment with resveratrol and pterostilbene. Moreover, while stable lentiviral expression of miR-17/106a significantly decreased PTEN mRNA and protein levels and conferred survival advantage to the cells, resveratrol and more so pterostilbene was able to dramatically suppress these effects. Further, pterostilbene through downregulation of miR-17-5p and miR-106a-5p expression both in tumors and systemic circulation, rescued PTEN mRNA and protein levels leading to reduced tumor growth in vivo. Our findings implicate dietary stilbenes as an attractive miRNA-mediated chemopreventive and therapeutic strategy, and circulating miRNAs as potential chemopreventive and predictive biomarkers for clinical development in prostate cancer.

Several mechanisms of cell defense can be turned on in one cell. The interconnections between different mechanisms involved in drug resistance are poorly studied. In the present study we used PC3 and DU145 human prostate cell lines to show that PTEN functional status determines level of cell resistance to some drugs, it correlates with expression level of MRP1 and BCRP proteins. We showed that Pgp is not involved in development of drug resistance in these cells.

With an oral dosage of 50mg/kg, BENC-511 decreased tumor growth more than 50% in 27 days, which was accompanied with PARP cleavage, but did not show overt toxicity. This study lays a solid rationale for the development of BENC-511 as a drug for the treatment of PTEN-deficient and androgen-independent prostate cancers. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Parthenolide has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antitumor properties. However, whether and how parthenolide enhances tumor sensitivity to radiation therapy are unknown. In this study, we show that inhibition of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway is a common mechanism for the radiosensitization effect of parthenolide in prostate cancer cells LNCaP, DU 145, and PC3. Parthenolide inhibits radiation-induced NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity and the expression of its downstream target sod2, the gene coding for an important antiapoptotic and antioxidant enzyme (manganese superoxide dismutase) in the three prostate cancer cells. Different susceptibilities to parthenolide's effect are observed in two radioresistant cancer cells, DU 145 and PC3, with DU 145 cells showing higher sensitivity. This differential susceptibility to parthenolide is due, in part, to the fact that in addition to NF-kappaB inhibition, parthenolide activates the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt prosurvival pathway in both cell lines. However, the activated Akt in DU 145 cells is kept at a relatively low level compared with that in PC3 cells due to the presence of functional PTEN. Transfection of wild-type PTEN into PTEN-null cells, PC3, confers the enhanced radiosensitization effect of parthenolide in PTEN-expressing cells. When PTEN expression is knocked down in DU 145 cells, the cells become more resistant to parthenolide's effect. Taken together, these results suggest that parthenolide inhibits the NF-kappaB pathway and activates the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt pathway in prostate cancer cells. The radiosensitization effect of parthenolide is due, in part, to the inhibition of the NF-kappaB pathway. The presence of PTEN enhances the radiosensitization effect of parthenolide, in part, by suppressing the absolute amount of activated p-Akt.",

The goal of the present study was to determine the safety and efficacy of VSV treatment of prostate tumors that arise in situ in immunocompetent, transgenic prostate-specific PTEN-null (PTEN(-/-)) mice. Interferon-sensitive VSV(AV3 strain), which expresses luciferase, was injected intraprostatically into tumor-bearing PTEN(-/-) and control mice and then monitored for tissue bioluminescence over 96 hours. Virus readily dispersed throughout the bodies of mice after only 3 hours; however, it persisted at high levels for >72 hours in PTEN(-/-) mice, but at relatively low levels and for only approximately 48 hours in controls. Plaque assays provided a similar pattern, with much higher concentrations of replicating virus in prostates of PTEN(-/-) mice than in controls. Transient, low levels of virus were detected in the spleens of both groups. Apoptotic analyses by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining revealed that VSV(AV3) is able to selectively infect and kill prostate cells in PTEN(-/-) mice, while sparing normal cells in control mice. The primary mechanism for cell kill is apparently apoptotic oncolysis as opposed to neutrophil invasion as has been reported using xenograft models. These results suggest that control of locally advanced human prostate cancer may be achievable through intraprostatic injection and amplification of a safe oncolytic virus, such as VSV(AV3).",

Current prognostic variables, stage, and Gleason score have limitations in assessing treatment regimens for individual patients, especially in the intermediate-risk group of Gleason score 7. ERG:TMPRSS2 fusion and loss of PTEN are some of the most common genetic alterations in prostate cancer. Immunohistochemistry of PTEN and ERG has generated interest as a promising method for more precise outcome prediction but requires further validation in population-based cohorts. We studied the predictive value of ERG and PTEN expression by immunohistochemistry in two large radical prostatectomy cohorts comprising 815 patients with extensive follow-up information. Clinical end points were initiation of secondary therapy, overall survival, and disease-specific survival. Predictions of clinical outcomes were also assessed according to androgen receptor (AR) activity. PTEN loss, especially in ERG-negative cancers, predicted initiation of secondary treatments and shortened disease-specific survival time, as well as stratifying Gleason score 7 patients into different prognostic groups with regard to secondary treatments and disease-specific survival. High AR immunoreactivity in ERG-negative cancers with PTEN loss predicted worse disease-specific survival. We also observed that in Gleason score 7 ERG-negative cases with PTEN loss and high AR expression have significantly shorter disease-specific survival time compared with ERG-positive cases. Our conclusion is that loss of PTEN is a strong determining factor for shorter disease-specific survival time and initiation of secondary therapies after radical prostatectomy. The predictive value of PTEN immunoreactivity is further accentuated in ERG-negative cancers with high AR expression. Negative PTEN expression, accompanied by ERG status, can be used to stratify patients with Gleason score 7 into different survival groups. Assessment of PTEN and ERG status could provide an additional tool for initial diagnostics when determining the prognosis and subsequent follow-up regimen for patients treated by radical prostatectomy.",

LIG4 expression was predominantly localized in the nucleus of the cells with increased intensities in malignant as compared to benign prostate epithelium. In prostate cancer, LIG4 expression was found in 91% of interpretable tumors, including 12% cancers with weak, 23% with moderate and 56% with strong LIG4 positivity. Strong LIG4 expression was tightly linked to advanced Gleason score (P<0.0001) and positive nodal involvement (P=0.03). There was a remarkable accumulation of strong LIG4 expression in tumors harboring TMPRSS2:ERG fusion and PTEN deletions (P<0.0001 each). High LIG4 expression was also tightly related to early biochemical recurrence when all tumors (P<0.0001) or the subsets of ERG-negative (P=0.0004) or ERG-positive prostate cancers (P=0.006) were analyzed. Multivariate analysis including parameters that are available before surgery demonstrated independent association with biochemical recurrence for advanced Gleason grade on biopsy, high preoperative PSA level, high clinical stage (P<0.0001 each) and for LIG4 immunostaining (P=0.03). Our study identifies LIG4 as a predictor of an increased risk for early PSA recurrence in prostate cancer.

We found that specific homozygous deletion of Sox4 in the adult prostate epithelium strongly inhibited tumor progression initiated by homozygous loss of Pten. Mechanistically, Sox4 ablation reduced activation of AKT and β-catenin, leading to an attenuated invasive phenotype. Furthermore, SOX4 expression was induced by Pten loss as a result of the activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling, suggesting a positive feedback loop between SOX4 and PI3K-AKT-mTOR activity.

Infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) is associated with reduced disease-free survival following radical prostatectomy. However, the association between PTEN loss, TAM infiltration and radiotherapy response of CaP cells remains to be evaluated. Immunohistochemical and molecular analysis of surgically-resected Gleason 7 tumors confirmed that PTEN loss correlated with increased CXCL8 expression and macrophage infiltration. However PTEN status had no discernable correlation with expression of other inflammatory markers by CaP cells, including TNF-α. In vitro, exposure to conditioned media harvested from irradiated PTEN null CaP cells induced chemotaxis of macrophage-like THP-1 cells, a response partially attenuated by CXCL8 inhibition. Co-culture with THP-1 cells resulted in a modest reduction in the radio-sensitivity of DU145 cells. Cytokine profiling revealed constitutive secretion of TNF-α from CaP cells irrespective of PTEN status and IR-induced TNF-α secretion from THP-1 cells. THP-1-derived TNF-α increased NFκB pro-survival activity and elevated expression of anti-apoptotic proteins including cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1 (cIAP-1) in CaP cells, which could be attenuated by pre-treatment with a TNF-α neutralizing antibody. Treatment with a novel IAP antagonist, AT-IAP, decreased basal and TNF-α-induced cIAP-1 expression in CaP cells, switched TNF-α signaling from pro-survival to pro-apoptotic and increased radiation sensitivity of CaP cells in co-culture with THP-1 cells. We conclude that targeting cIAP-1 can overcome apoptosis resistance of CaP cells and is an ideal approach to exploit high TNF-α signals within the TAM-rich microenvironment of PTEN-deficient CaP cells to enhance response to radiotherapy.

This mouse model was also used to examine the therapeutic efficacy of sorafenib alone or in combination with everolimus. Preclinical efficacy was assessed by comparing the reduction of tumor burden, proliferation, angiogenesis and the induction of apoptosis. Molecular responses were assessed by immunohistochemical, TUNEL and western blot assays.;Pharmacodynamic analysis revealed that a single dose of sorafenib decreased activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis at doses of 30-60 mg/kg, but activated JAK/STAT3 signaling. Levels of cleaved casapase-3 increased in a dose dependent manner. Chemoprevention studies showed that chronic sorafenib administration was capable of inhibiting tumor progression through the reduction of cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis and the induction of apoptosis. In intervention models of established castration-naïve and castration-resistant prostate cancer, treatment with sorafenib provided modest but statistically insignificant reduction in tumor burden. However, sorafenib significantly inhibited cancer cell proliferation and MVD but had minimal effects on the induction of apoptosis. Interestingly, the administration of sorafenib increased the expression levels of the androgen receptor, p-GSK3β and p-ERK1/2 in castration-resistant prostate cancers. In both intervention models, combination therapy demonstrated a clear tendency of enhanced antitumor effects over monotherapy. Notably, the treatment combination of sorafenib and everolimus overcame therapeutic escape from single agent therapy in castration-resistant prostate cancers.;In summary, we provide insights into the molecular responses of sorafenib therapy in a clinically relevant model of prostate cancer and present preclinical evidence for the development of targeted treatment strategies based on the use of multikinase inhibitors in combination with mTOR inhibitors for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.",

Targeted inhibition of downstream pathways, namely mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) may prove to be important in the treatment of HRPC because of the prevalence of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) loss, and it has been shown preclinically that mTOR inhibition reverses the phenotype of PTEN loss. Further investigation is necessary for the targeted inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinases and mTOR in HRPC.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of Palomid 529 (P529), a novel TORC1/TORC2 inhibitor, in association with docetaxel (DTX) and cisplatin (CP). This work utilizes a wide panel of prostatic cancer cell lines with or without basal activation of Akt as well as two in vivo models of aggressive HRPC. The blockade of Akt/mTOR activity was associated to reduced cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Comparison of IC50 values calculated for PTEN-positive and PTEN-negative cell lines as well as the PTEN transfection in PC3 cells or PTEN silencing in DU145 cells revealed that absence of PTEN was indicative for a better activity of the drug. In addition, P529 synergized with DTX and CP. The strongest synergism was achieved when prostate cancer (PCa) cells were sequentially exposed to CP or DTX followed by treatment with P529. Treatment with P529 before the exposure to chemotherapeutic drugs resulted in a moderate synergism, whereas intermediated values of combination index were found when drugs were administered simultaneously. In vivo treatment of a combination of P529 with DTX or CP increased the percentage of complete responses and reduced the number of mice with tumor progression.

The lack of our understanding of underlying genetic alterations for the transition from androgen-dependent (AD) to ADI prostate cancer growth hampers our ability to develop target-driven therapeutic strategies for the efficient treatment of ADI prostate cancer.;By screening a library of activated human kinases, we have identified TPL2, encoding a serine/threonine kinase, as driving ADI prostate cancer growth. TPL2 activation by over-expressing either wild-type or a constitutively activated form of TPL2 induced ADI growth, whereas the suppression of TPL2 expression and its kinase activity in ADI prostate cancer cells inhibited cell proliferation under androgen-depleted conditions. Most importantly, TPL2 is upregulated in ADI prostate cancers of both the Pten deletion mouse model and the clinical prostate cancer specimens.;Together these data suggest that TPL2 kinase plays a critical role in the promotion of ADI prostate cancer progression.

        "Doc_abstract":"A major challenge to oncolytic virus therapy is that individual cancers vary in their sensitivity to oncolytic viruses, even when these cancers arise from the same tissue type. Variability in response may arise due to differences in the initial genetic lesions leading to cancer development. Alternatively, susceptibility to viral oncolysis may change during cancer progression. These hypotheses were tested using cells from a transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Primary cultures from murine cancers derived from prostate-specific Pten deletion contained a mixture of cells that were susceptible and resistant to VSV. Castration-resistant cancers contained a higher percentage of susceptible cells than cancers from noncastrated mice. These results indicate both susceptible and resistant cells can evolve within the same tumor. The role of Pten deletion was further investigated using clonal populations of murine prostate epithelial (MPE) progenitor cells and tumor-derived Pten(-/-) cells. Deletion of Pten in MPE progenitor cells using a lentivirus vector resulted in cells that responded poorly to interferon and were susceptible to VSV infection. In contrast, tumor-derived Pten(-/-) cells expressed higher levels of the antiviral transcription factor STAT1, activated STAT1 in response to VSV, and were resistant to VSV infection. These results suggest that early in tumor development following Pten deletion, cells are primarily sensitive to VSV, but subsequent evolution in tumors leads to development of cells that are resistant to VSV infection. Further evolution in castration-resistant tumors leads to tumors in which cells are primarily sensitive to VSV.;There has been a great deal of progress in the development of replication-competent viruses that kill cancer cells (oncolytic viruses). However, a major problem is that individual cancers vary in their sensitivity to oncolytic viruses, even when these cancers arise from the same tissue type. The experiments presented here were to determine whether both sensitive and resistant cells are present in prostate cancers originating from a single genetic lesion in transgenic mice, prostate-specific deletion of the gene for the tumor suppressor Pten. The results indicate that murine prostate cancers are composed of both cells that are sensitive and cells that are resistant to oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Furthermore, androgen deprivation led to castration-resistant prostate cancers that were composed primarily of cells that were sensitive to VSV. These results are encouraging for the use of VSV for the treatment of prostate cancers that are resistant to androgen deprivation therapy.",

These inhibitors have recently become a standard therapy in renal cell carcinoma and offer significant promise in prostate cancer. Through an understanding of the key pathways involved in prostate cancer progression, a rational drug design can be aimed at the molecules critical to cellular signaling. This may enable administration of selective therapies based on the expression of molecular targets, more appropriately individualizing treatment for prostate cancer patients. One pathway with a prominent role in prostate cancer is the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Current estimates suggest that PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling is upregulated in 30-50% of prostate cancers, often through loss of PTEN. Molecular changes in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway have been demonstrated to differentiate benign from malignant prostatic epithelium and are associated with increasing tumor stage, grade, and risk of biochemical recurrence. Multiple inhibitors of this pathway have been developed and are being assessed in the laboratory and in clinical trials, with much attention focusing on mTOR inhibition. Current clinical trials in prostate cancer are assessing efficacy of mTOR inhibitors in combination with multiple targeted or traditional chemotherapies, including bevacizumab, gefitinib, and docetaxel. Completion of these trials will provide substantial information regarding the importance of this pathway in prostate cancer and the clinical implications of its targeted inhibition.

Unfortunately, resistance to docetaxel therapy is an ultimate occurrence. Alterations in androgen receptor (AR) expression and signaling are associated mechanisms underlying resistance to docetaxel treatment in CRPC. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone, which regulates the activation, maturation and stability of critical signaling proteins involved in prostate cancer, including the AR. This knowledge and recent advances in compound design and development have highlighted Hsp90 as an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of CRPC. We recently reported the development of a MYC-CaP castrate resistant (MYC-CaP/CR) transplant tumor model, which expresses amplified wild type AR. Within, we report that a second generation Hsp90 inhibitor, NVP-AUY922, inhibits cell growth and significantly induces cell death in MYC-CaP/CR and Pten-CaP/cE2 cell lines. NVP-AUY922 induced proteasome degradation of AR, though interestingly does not require loss of AR protein to inhibit AR transcriptional activity. Further, NVP-AUY922 increased docetaxel toxicity in MYC-CaP/CR and Pten-CaP/cE2 cell lines in vitro. Finally, NVP-AUY922/docetaxel combination therapy in mice bearing MYC-CaP/CR tumors resulted in greater anti-tumor activity compared to single treatment. This study demonstrates that NVP-AUY922 elicits potent activity towards AR signaling and augments chemotherapy response in a mouse model of CRPC, providing rationale for the continued clinical development of Hsp90 inhibitors in clinical trials for treatment of CRPC patients.

Following the androgen receptor (AR) pathway, it is the second major driver of PCa growth.;To assess efficacy of novel PI3K/AKT-targeted therapies in PCa models, as a single agent and in combination with androgen deprivation.;Twelve human PCa cell lines were tested in vitro for sensitivity to the AKT inhibitor AZD5363 and the PI3K beta/delta inhibitor AZD8186. The combination of AZD5363 and AZD8186 with castration was evaluated in vivo in PTEN-negative versus PTEN-positive patient-derived xenografts. Tumors and plasma were collected for biomarker analysis.;In vitro growth inhibition was determined by methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay. In vivo efficacy was monitored by caliper measurements of subcutaneous tumor volume. PI3K/AKT and AR pathway activity was analyzed by Western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and real-time polymerase chain reaction.;AZD5363 and AZD8186 inhibited in vitro growth of 10 of 12 and 7 of 12 PCa cell lines, respectively, with increased sensitivity under androgen depletion. In vivo, AZD5363 and AZD8186 as single agents significantly inhibited growth of PTEN-negative PC346C xenografts compared to placebo by 60% and 66%, respectively. Importantly, combination of either agent with castration resulted in long-lasting tumor regression, which persisted after treatment cessation. Expression of AR-target genes kallikrein-related peptidase 3 (KLK3, also known as PSA); transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2); and FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) was upregulated after PI3K/AKT inhibition. Neither compound inhibited tumor growth in the PTEN-positive PC310 model.;Combination with hormonal therapy improved efficacy of PI3K/AKT-targeted agents in PTEN-negative PCa models. Upregulation of AR-target genes upon PI3K/AKT inhibition suggests a compensatory crosstalk between the PI3K-AR pathways. These data strongly advocate for further clinical evaluation.;Inactivation of the PTEN gene is a common event promoting prostate cancer (PCa) progression. This preclinical study illustrates the potent anticancer activity of novel PTEN-targeted drugs on PCa models, particularly in combination with hormonal therapy.",

Taxol chemotherapy is one of the few therapeutic options for patients with CRPC albeit the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. We have demonstrated recently that Taxol (paclitaxel and its semisynthetic analogue docetaxel) treatment of 22Rv1, a CRPC cell line that expresses the tumor suppressor gene PTEN, inhibits AR transcriptional activity. In contrast, paclitaxel failed to inhibit AR activity in the PTEN-deficient C4-2 CRPC cells. Docetaxel treatment of 22Rv1 xenografts in mice induced mitotic arrest and a decrease in expression of the AR target gene prostate-specific antigen (PSA) mainly in tumor cells adjacent to vascular vessels. Further studies demonstrated that Taxol inhibition of the AR is mediated, at least in part, by Taxol-induced nuclear accumulation of FOXO1, a key downstream effector protein of PTEN and increased association of FOXO1 with the AR. These studies suggest that the status of the functional PTEN/FOXO pathway and the drug bioavailability may be the two key determinants for Taxol chemoresistance of CRPC in the clinic.",

Mechanisms that dictate nuclear import and, less extensively, nuclear export of PTEN have been described, however the relevance of these processes in disease states, particularly cancer, remain largely unknown. We investigated the impact of acid ceramidase on the nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of PTEN. Immunohistochemical analysis of a human prostate tissue microarray revealed that nuclear PTEN was lost in patients whose tumors had elevated acid ceramidase. We found that acid ceramidase promotes a reduction in nuclear PTEN that is dependent upon sphingosine 1-phosphate-mediated activation of Akt. We were further able to show that sphingosine 1-phosphate promotes formation of a complex between Crm1 and PTEN, and that leptomycin B prevents acid ceramidase and sphingosine 1-phosphate mediated loss of nuclear PTEN, suggesting an active exportin-mediated event. To investigate whether the tumor promoting aspects of acid ceramidase in prostate cancer depend upon its ability to export PTEN from the nucleus, we used enforced nuclear expression of PTEN to study docetaxel-induced apoptosis and cell killing, proliferation, and xenoengraftment. Interestingly, while acid ceramidase was able to protect cells expressing wild type PTEN from docetaxel, promote proliferation and xenoengraftment, acid ceramidase had no impact in cells expressing PTEN-NLS. These findings suggest that acid ceramidase, through sphingosine 1-phosphate, promotes nuclear export of PTEN as a means of promoting tumor formation, cell proliferation, and resistance to therapy.

Human metastatic, androgen-independent C4-2 prostate cancer cells and NOD-SCID mice bearing PTEN-deficient, metastatic and PSA-secreting, patient-derived subrenal capsule LTL-313H prostate cancer tissue xenografts were treated with docetaxel and Aneustat, alone and in combination. In vitro, Aneustat markedly inhibited C4-2 cell replication in a dose-dependent manner. When Aneustat was combined with docetaxel, the growth inhibitions of the drugs were essentially additive. In vivo, however, the combination of docetaxel and Aneustat enhanced anti-tumor activity synergistically and very markedly, without inducing major host toxicity. Complete growth inhibition and shrinkage of the xenografts could be obtained with the combined drugs as distinct from the drugs on their own. Analysis of the gene expression of the xenografts using microarray indicated that docetaxel + Aneustat led to expanded anticancer activity, in particular to targeting of cancer hallmarks that were not affected by the single drugs.

Analysis of human prostate tissues, xenograft and transgenic mouse models of prostate cancer, and prostate cancer cell lines has provided support for the role of MTA1 in advanced disease and its potential role in initial stages of prostate tumor progression. Recent discoveries have highlighted a critical role for MTA1 in inflammation-triggered prostate tumorigenesis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, prostate cancer survival pathways, and site metastasis. Evidence for MTA1 as an upstream negative regulator of tumor suppressor genes such as p53 and PTEN has also emerged. MTA1 is involved in prostate tumor angiogenesis by regulating several pro-angiogenic factors. Evidence for MTA1 as a prognostic marker for aggressive prostate cancer and disease recurrence has been described.

In line with this important role of PTEN, mice that are heterozygous for a PTEN-null allele (PTEN+/− mice) spontaneously develop a variety of tumours in multiple organs. PTEN is a phosphatase with selectivity for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, which is produced by the class I isoforms of PI3K (p110α, p110β, p110γ and p110δ). Previous studies indicated that PTEN-deficient cancer cell lines mainly depend on p110β, and that p110β, but not p110α, controls mouse prostate cancer development driven by PTEN loss. In the present study, we investigated whether the ubiquitously expressed p110α can also functionally interact with PTEN in cancer. Using genetic mouse models that mimic systemic administration of p110α- or p110β-selective inhibitors, we confirm that inactivation of p110β, but not p110α, inhibits prostate cancer development in PTEN+/− mice, but also find that p110α inactivation protects from glomerulonephritis, pheochromocytoma and thyroid cancer induced by PTEN loss. This indicates that p110α can modulate the impact of PTEN loss in disease and tumourigenesis. In primary and immortalized mouse fibroblast cell lines, both p110α and p110β controlled steady-state PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels and Akt signalling induced by heterozygous PTEN loss. In contrast, no correlation was found in primary mouse tissues between PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels, PI3K/PTEN genotype and cancer development. Taken together, our results from the present study show that inactivation of either p110α or p110β can counteract the impact of PTEN inactivation. The potential implications of these findings for PI3K-targeted therapy of cancer are discussed.",

The fact that PTEN encodes a lipid phosphatase with specificity towards phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate renders it a gate-keeper of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. Numerous physiological processes have been ascribed to this evolutionarily conserved molecule including proliferation, cell size determination, survival, differentiation, and cell fate specification. Indeed, mutation in PTEN gene is the genetic cause of Cowden Syndrome. Structurally, the 54-kilodalton protein is composed of two major functional domains crucial for catalytic and membrane binding functions. Additional regulatory regions in both amino- and carboxyl-termini further dictate its structural integrity, catalytic activity, and subcellular localization. Extensive characterization of PTEN primary coding sequence has revealed a multitude of post-translational modifications that fine-tune its biochemical properties. These include phosphorylation, ubiquitination, redox modifications, and acetylation. This article aims to provide an in-depth review of the diverse post-translational modifications of PTEN, focusing on their biological relevance in both normal and cancer cells.

Here, we use whole genome sequencing of a prostate cancer tumor, computational analyses, and experimental validation to identify and predict novel oncogenic activity arising from a point mutation in the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) tumor suppressor protein. We demonstrate that this mutation (p.A126G) produces an enzymatic gain-of-function in PTEN, shifting its function from a phosphoinositide (PI) 3-phosphatase to a phosphoinositide (PI) 5-phosphatase. Using cellular assays, we demonstrate that this gain-of-function activity shifts cellular phosphoinositide levels, hyperactivates the PI3K/Akt cell proliferation pathway, and exhibits increased cell migration beyond canonical PTEN loss-of-function mutants. These findings suggest that mutationally modified PTEN can actively contribute to well-defined hallmarks of cancer. Lastly, we demonstrate that these effects can be substantially mitigated through chemical PI3K inhibitors. These results demonstrate a new dysfunction paradigm for PTEN cancer biology and suggest a potential framework for the translation of genomic data into actionable clinical strategies for targeted patient therapy.

Aberrant activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR has been implicated not only in the survival and metastasis of prostate cancer cells but also in the development of drug resistance. As such, selective inactivation of this pathway may provide opportunities to attack prostate cancer from all fronts. However, while preclinical studies examining specific inhibitors of PI3K or mTOR have yielded promising results, the evidence from clinical trials is less convincing. Emerging evidence from the analyses of some solid tumors suggests that a class of dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, which bind to and inactivate both PI3K and mTOR, may achieve better anti-cancer outcomes. In this review, we will summarize the mechanisms of action of these inhibitors, their effectiveness when used alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic compounds, and their potential to serve as the next generation therapies for prostate cancer patients, particularly those who are resistant to the frontline chemotherapeutic drugs.

Clinical trials showed insignificant clinical benefit in patients with castration resistant prostate cancer both when EGFR inhibitors were administered as monotherapy or in association with antiandrogens or chemotherapeutics. Why, differently to other tumors, have EGFR inhibitors been so ineffective in human prostate cancer? This is the question that we have set in this report.;For this purpose, the effectiveness of erlotinib, a selective EGFR inhibitor, in a wide range of prostate cancer cells (wild type or engineered to overexpress peculiar proteins including androgen receptor and PTEN).;We demonstrated that the effectiveness of erlotinib was inversely correlated to the EGFR/Her2 ratio rather than EGFR/p-EGFR or Her2/p-Her2 levels. Chronic treatment with bicalutamide induced overexpression of Her2 and reduction of EGFR/Her2ratio and this was associated with increased Akt and Erk activity. In these conditions of treatment a reduced efficacy of erlotinib was observed. At the same time, an increased efficacy versus erlotinib was documented in cancer cells chronically exposed to DHT. In these culture conditions low levels of Her2 and increased EGFR/Her2 ratio were evidenced.;Taken together, our results seem to suggest that a low EGFR/Her2 ratio and PTEN absence are the main factors responsible of erlotinib inefficacy. Therefore the inhibition of EGFR could have important antitumor effects in hormone-naive rather than in hormonally treated patients.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Epigenetic mechanisms may be the main driving force for critical changes in gene expression that are responsible for progression of prostate cancers. The three most extensively characterized mechanisms for epigenetic gene-regulation are (i) changing patterns of DNA methylation, (ii) histone acetylations/deacetylations, and (iii) alterations in regulatory feedback loops for growth factors. Several studies have indicated that DNA hypermethylation is an important mechanism in prostate cancer for inactivation of key regulatory genes such as E-cadherin, pi-class glutathione S-transferase, the tumor suppressors CDKN2 and PTEN, and IGF-II. Similarly, histone acetylations and deacetylations are frequently associated respectively with transcriptional activation (e.g. IGFBP-2 and p21) and repression (e.g. Mad:Max dimers) of genes linked to prostate cancer progression. Recently, histone acetyltransferase and deacetylase activities have been shown to be intrinsic with transcriptional coregulator proteins that bind to steroid receptors (e.g. SRC-1 and PCAF). Changes in regulatory feedback loops for growth factors with prostate cancer progression tend toward shifts from paracrine to autocrine control where the receptor and ligand are produced by the same cell. While there are several examples of this progression pattern in prostate tumors such as with IGF, FGF, TGF-alpha and their respective receptors, the precise mechanism (i.e. epigenetic or mutational) is less certain. In the context of treatment options, the contribution of mutational versus epigenetic events to prostate cancer progression is an important consideration. Irreversible genetic changes are likely to be less amenable to therapeutic control than are epigenetic ones.",

Expression patterns of Akt, FoxO1a, FoxO3a, FoxO4, and their phosphorylated form, DNA binding activity and downstream signaling molecules during different stages of disease progression were examined by immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay (ELISA), and immunohistochemistry. Inhibition of FoxO3a activity was attained by using FoxO3a peptide treatment to TRAMP mice.;In TRAMP mice, FoxO3a activity is negatively regulated by Akt/PKB through post-translational modification. Progressive increase in Akt activation during prostate cancer progression led to increase phosphorylation of FoxO3a and binding with 14-3-3, which potentially affected its transcriptional activity in age-specific manner. Furthermore, blocking FoxO3a activity resulted in accelerated prostate cancer progression in these mice, which was associated with the loss of cell cycle control and increased proliferation and survival markers.;Restoration of FoxO3a activity represents an attractive therapeutic target in the chemoprevention and possibly in inhibition of progression of prostate cancer.",

However, a significant number of these patients will recur and be in need of second-line therapies. The knowledge of molecular arrangements after pharmacological therapy seems to be a new primary prerequisite to predict the efficacy or the failure of a secondary therapy. Based on these considerations, we have conducted this study in order to analyze the expressions of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), Akt, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), phospho-EGFR (p-EGFR), human EGFR2 (Her2), and phospho-Her2 (p-Her2) after bicalutamide treatment. For this purpose, we evaluated retrospectively 69 prostate cancer tissues derived from patients who received radical prostatectomy as the only treatment, and 81 from patients who received bicalutamide for 120 days before surgery. In addition, we analyzed at different time points the effects of castration performed on athymic mice bearing the LuCaP 35 xenograft line at different times. We observed that bicalutamide treatment increased significantly the levels of p-Akt, EGFR, and Her2 with a concomitant reduction in PTEN. This effect was time dependent and required of sufficient time to be evident as indicated by data obtained with the LuCaP 35 tumors. A logistic multiple regression analysis revealed that a switch of p-Akt control from a PTEN/EGFR- to Her2-after bicalutamide treatment was possible. Since Akt and Her2 can be associated with reduced drug sensitivity, our report suggests that the evaluation of molecular arrangements after bicalutamide treatment could be useful to identify subsets of patients who will be molecular permissive for new adjuvant anti-target therapies.",

Drugs targeting the PI3K pathway aim to inhibit proliferation, promote apoptosis, and enhance chemosensitivity and radiosensitivity of cancer cells. The phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) phosphatidylinositol 3'-phosphatase is a key negative regulator of the PI3K pathway. Inactivation of the PTEN tumor suppressor results in constitutive activation of the PI3K pathway and is found in approximately 50% of advanced prostate cancers, which correlates with a high Gleason score and poor prognosis. Inhibition of the PI3K pathway leads to apoptosis of prostate cancer cells; however, the precise mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. Here we report that apoptotic cell death of PTEN-deficient LNCaP and PC3 prostate cancer cells induced by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 can be abrogated by disrupting Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) interactions with recombinant Fas:Fc fusion protein or FasL neutralizing antibody (Nok-1), or by expressing dominant-negative Fas-associated death domain. Furthermore, we find that apoptosis induced by expression of wild-type PTEN, driven by a tetracycline-inducible expression system in LNCaP cells, can be inhibited by blocking Fas/FasL interaction using Fas:Fc or Nok-1. These data show that apoptosis induced by blockade of the PI3K pathway in prostate tumor cells is mediated by an autocrine Fas/FasL apoptotic mechanism and the Fas apoptotic pathway is both necessary and sufficient to mediate apoptosis by PI3K inhibition.",

However, the mechanisms leading to this aberrant PTEN localization in human cancers are currently unknown. We have previously reported that ubiquitinylation of PTEN at specific lysine residues regulates its nuclear-cytoplasmic partitioning. Here we show that functional promyelocytic leukaemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies co-ordinate PTEN localization by opposing the action of a previously unknown PTEN-deubiquitinylating enzyme, herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease (HAUSP, also known as USP7), and that the integrity of this molecular framework is required for PTEN to be able to enter the nucleus. We find that PTEN is aberrantly localized in acute promyelocytic leukaemia, in which PML function is disrupted by the PML-RARalpha fusion oncoprotein. Remarkably, treatment with drugs that trigger PML-RARalpha degradation, such as all-trans retinoic acid or arsenic trioxide, restore nuclear PTEN. We demonstrate that PML opposes the activity of HAUSP towards PTEN through a mechanism involving the adaptor protein DAXX (death domain-associated protein). In support of this paradigm, we show that HAUSP is overexpressed in human prostate cancer and is associated with PTEN nuclear exclusion. Thus, our results delineate a previously unknown PML-DAXX-HAUSP molecular network controlling PTEN deubiquitinylation and trafficking, which is perturbed by oncogenic cues in human cancer, in turn defining a new deubiquitinylation-dependent model for PTEN subcellular compartmentalization.",

Local CaP recurrence after RT is a pattern of treatment failure attributable to radioresistance of cancer cells. One major obstacle to RT is that there is a limit to the amount of radiation that can be safely delivered to the target organ. Recent results indicate that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, autophagy, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cells (CSCs) are involved in CaP metastasis and radioresistance. Emerging evidence also suggests that combining a radiosensitizer with RT increases the efficacy of CaP treatment. Understanding the mechanisms of radioresistance will help to overcome recurrence after RT in CaP patients and prevent metastasis. In this review, we discuss the novel findings of PI3K/Akt/PTEN/mTOR signaling pathway, autophagy, EMT and CSCs in the regulation of CaP metastasis and radioresistance, and focus on combination of radiosensitizers with RT in the treatment of CaP in preclinical studies to explore novel approaches for future clinical trials.

However, activation of mTOR is also dependent of kinases other than AKT. Here, we show that activation of mTOR is not dependent on AKT in a prostate-specific PTEN-deficient mouse model of prostate cancer. Pathway bifurcation of AKT and mTOR was noted in both mouse and human prostate tumors. We demonstrated for the first time that cotargeting mTOR and AKT with ridaforolimus/MK-8669 and M1K-2206, respectively, delivers additive antitumor effects in vivo when compared to single agents.

A log2 ratio-based copy number analysis detected common genomic abnormalities in prostate cancer including AR amplification in 5/10 CRPC patients.

Inhibitors of PI3Kβ have potential to reduce growth of tumors in which loss of PTEN drives tumor progression. We have developed a small-molecule inhibitor of PI3Kβ and PI3Kδ (AZD8186) and assessed its antitumor activity across a panel of cell lines. We have then explored the antitumor effects as single agent and in combination with docetaxel in triple-negative breast (TNBC) and prostate cancer models. In vitro, AZD8186 inhibited growth of a range of cell lines. Sensitivity was associated with inhibition of the AKT pathway. Cells sensitive to AZD8186 (GI50 < 1 μmol/L) are enriched for, but not exclusively associated with, PTEN deficiency. In vivo, AZD8186 inhibits PI3K pathway biomarkers in prostate and TNBC tumors. Scheduling treatment with AZD8186 shows antitumor activity required only intermittent exposure, and that increased tumor control is achieved when AZD8186 is used in combination with docetaxel. AZD8186 is a potent inhibitor of PI3Kβ with activity against PI3Kδ signaling, and has potential to reduce growth of tumors dependent on dysregulated PTEN for growth.

        "Doc_abstract":"One of the major obstacles in curing prostate cancer is the development of drug resistance. It is not only imperative to discover the molecular basis of resistance but also to find therapeutic agents that can disrupt the resistant pathways. Tumor necrosis factor TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand TRAIL-like ligands or agonist TRAIL-receptor monoclonal antibodies have entered phase I and II clinical trials with a very limited cytotoxic profile when used systemically in a variety of cancers. Therefore, TRAIL-receptor agonists are new proapoptotic pharmaceutical agents with great potential as new cancer therapeutic agents. Although many cancer cells undergo TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, some are resistant to TRAIL. Therefore, we have been investigating mechanisms to overcome TRAIL resistance in cancer cells so that TRAIL-associated compounds can be used effectively in clinical trials. Epigenetic inactivation of proapoptotic genes, or activation of survival signaling, can cause cross-resistance to several anti-tumor therapies and to immune cytotoxic lymphocytes. We hypothesize that 5-aza-2 deoxycytidine aza-dCR, decitabine may render TRAIL-resistant prostate cancer cells sensitive to caspase-8-mediated apoptosis and may, therefore, be therapeutically efficient. We evaluated the antiproliferative effects of decitabine on the following four prostate cancer cell lines: well-differentiated AR positive LnCaP p53(+), PTEN- and 22rv1 p53(+) and PTEN(+)]; poorly-differentiated AR negative PC3 p53-, PTEN- and DU145 p53 mutant, PTEN(+). Here, we provide evidence that treatment with sub-optimal concentrations of decitabine are additive to TRAIL effects in well-differentiated PCa cells whereas the same treatment shows synergistic effects in poorly-differentiated PCa cells through increased caspase-8 expression, down-modulation of Akt activation and through the expression of certain anti-apoptotic molecules including FLIP, PED/PEA-15, survivin and c-IAP-1. Our findings demonstrate that decitabine at relatively low concentrations restores caspase-8 expression and sensitises resistant PCa cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis leading to important implications in novel therapeutic strategies targeting defective apoptosis pathways in advanced prostate tumors.",

Genetic ablation of Par-4 induces fully invasive prostate carcinomas in PTEN-heterozygous mice. In contrast, Par-4 deficiency alone, like PTEN heterozygosis, results in lesions that are unable to progress beyond the benign neoplastic stage known as PIN. At this PIN transition, the mutual induction of Par-4 and PTEN is an additional regulatory step in preventing cancer progression. Par-4 deficiency cooperates with PTEN haploinsufficiency in prostate cancer initiation and progression and their simultaneous inactivation, in addition to enhancing Akt activation, sets in motion a unique mechanism involving the synergistic activation of NFkappaB. These results suggest that the concurrent interruption of complementary signaling pathways targeting PI3K/Akt and NFkappaB activation could provide new and effective strategies for cancer therapy.",

PTEN-/- cells were transduced with a small hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentiviral vector containing either scrambled nucleotides (SCRM) or sequences targeted to PDGF D (shPDGF D). Tumorigenesis and morphogenesis of these cell lines were evaluated in vivo via subcutaneous injection of male nude mice and in vitro using Matrigel 3-dimensional (3D) culture. Effects of irradiation on clonogenic survival, cell migration, and invasion were measured with respect to the PTEN status and the PDGF D expression level. In addition, apoptosis and cell cycle redistribution were examined as potential mechanisms for differences seen.;PTEN-/- cells were highly tumorigenic in animals and effectively formed foci in 3D culture. Importantly, loss of PDGF D in these cell lines drastically diminished these phenotypes. Furthermore, PTEN-/- cells demonstrated increased clonogenic survival in vitro compared to PTEN+/+, and attenuation of PDGF D significantly reversed this radioresistant phenotype. PTEN-/- cells displayed greater migratory and invasive potential at baseline as well as after irradiation. Both the basal and radiation-induced migratory and invasive phenotypes in PTEN-/- cells required PDGF D expression. Interestingly, these differences were independent of apoptosis and cell cycle redistribution, as they showed no significant difference.;We propose that PDGF D represents a potentially promising target for PCa treatment resistance in the absence of PTEN function, and warrants further laboratory evaluation and clinical study.",

PTEN mutation leads to constitutive activation of protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt with phosphorylation at the PKB/Akt sites Thr-308 and Ser-473. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) has been shown to regulate PKB/Akt activity with the loss of PTEN in prostate cancer. We now demonstrate that ILK activity regulates PKB/Akt activity in glioblastoma cells. The activity of ILK is constitutively elevated in a serum-independent manner in PTEN mutant cells, and transfection of wild-type PTEN under the control of an inducible promoter into mutant PTEN cells inhibits ILK activity. Transfection of ILK antisense (ILKAS) or exposure to a small-molecule ILK inhibitor suppresses the constitutive phosphorylation of PKB/Akt on Ser-473 in PTEN-mutant glioblastoma cell lines. In addition, the delivery of ILKAS to PTEN-negative glioblastoma cells resulted in apoptosis. Rag-2M mice bearing established ( approximately 100 mg) human U87MG glioblastoma tumors, treated QD x 5 for 3 consecutive weeks with ILKAS (i.p. 5 mg/kg), exhibited stable disease with < or =7% increase in tumor volume over the 3-week course of treatment.

        "Doc_abstract":"Licorice extract which is used as a natural sweetener has been shown to possess inhibitory effects against prostate cancer, but the mechanisms responsible are poorly understood. Here, we report a compound, isoangustone A (IAA) in licorice that potently suppresses the growth of aggressive prostate cancer and sought to clarify its mechanism of action. We analyzed its inhibitory effects on the growth of PTEN-deleted human prostate cancer cells, in vitro and in vivo. Administration of IAA significantly attenuated the growth of prostate cancer cell cultures and xenograft tumors. These effects were found to be attributable to inhibition of the G1/S phase cell cycle transition and the accumulation of p27(kip1). The elevated p27(kip1) expression levels were concurrent with the decrease of its phosphorylation at threonine 187 through suppression of CDK2 kinase activity and the reduced phosphorylation of Akt at Serine 473 by diminishing the kinase activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Further analysis using recombinant proteins and immunoprecipitated cell lysates determined that IAA exerts suppressive effects against CDK2 and mTOR kinase activity by direct binding with both proteins. These findings suggested that the licorice compound IAA is a potent molecular inhibitor of CDK2 and mTOR, with strong implications for the treatment of prostate cancer. Thus, licorice-derived extracts with high IAA content warrant further clinical investigation for nutritional sources for prostate cancer patients. ",

We have been investigating the mechanisms underlying androgen-independent prostate cancer in Nkx3.1;Pten mutant mice, which display salient features of the disease, including a requirement for wild-type androgen receptor (AR) signaling. We now demonstrate that the Akt and Erk MAP kinase signaling pathways are activated in androgen-independent lesions of these mice. Forced activation of either Akt or Erk signaling in an androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell line promotes hormone-independent but AR-dependent growth in culture. Although these pathways act additively in culture, they act synergistically in vivo to promote tumorigenicity and androgen independence in the context of the prostate microenvironment. We propose that androgen independence emerges by means of epithelial-stromal competition, in which activation of Akt and Erk promotes AR activity in the prostate epithelium while counteracting antagonistic effects of the stroma.",

It has been observed that the expression levels of AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3 vary, but the levels of phospho-Ser473 AKT and phospho-Thr308 AKT are quite unique in these cancer cell lines, and that CL-1 cells have the highest basal levels of AKT activation among these cell lines. In PC-3 cells, CMEP has been found to inhibit only AKT activation at both normal and serum-starvation conditions, not to inhibit PI3K, PDK1, or MAPK. More importantly, it has been discovered that CMEP inhibits cell proliferation, and induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells which have high-levels of AKT activation and lack PTEN or harbor PTEN mutation, such as CL-1, LNCaP, and PC-3; only shows a minimal activity in DU-145 cancer cells which do not have AKT activation. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that CMEP treatment inhibits phospho-Ser473 AKT and phospho-p70S6K while stimulating TSC2 in the tumor tissue from CL-1-bearing mice.

The paucity of biomarkers to predict prostate tumor biology makes it important to identify key pathways that confer poor prognosis and guide potential targeted therapy. Using a murine forward mutagenesis screen in a Pten-null background, we identified peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (Pparg), encoding a ligand-activated transcription factor, as a promoter of metastatic CaP through activation of lipid signaling pathways, including up-regulation of lipid synthesis enzymes [fatty acid synthase (FASN), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), ATP citrate lyase (ACLY)]. Importantly, inhibition of PPARG suppressed tumor growth in vivo, with down-regulation of the lipid synthesis program. We show that elevated levels of PPARG strongly correlate with elevation of FASN in human CaP and that high levels of PPARG/FASN and PI3K/pAKT pathway activation confer a poor prognosis. These data suggest that CaP patients could be stratified in terms of PPARG/FASN and PTEN levels to identify patients with aggressive CaP who may respond favorably to PPARG/FASN inhibition. ",

We report that on a C57BL/6 background, in contrast to previous studies on mixed 129 genetic backgrounds, Pten locus heterozygosity is fully penetrant for the development of prostate adenocarcinoma. Grossly observable tumors were detected at 6 months of age, and, by 10 to 12 months, 100% of examined mice developed adenocarcinoma of the anterior prostate. Furthermore, double heterozygotes carrying both Pten and Tsc2-null alleles showed no increase relative to Pten(+/-) heterozygotes in either lesion development or progression. Lesions in both Pten(+/-); Tsc2(+/-), and Pten(+/-) mice exhibited loss of PTEN expression and activation of PI3K signaling. PI3K activation occurred early in prostate intraepithelial neoplasia lesion formation in these animals, consistent with loss of PTEN function, and contributed to the etiology of tumors that developed in Pten(+/-) mice.

This was further supported by the observation that the activity of AR luciferase reporter genes was inhibited by paclitaxel. In contrast, paclitaxel treatment failed to inhibit AR activity in the PTEN-null CRPC cell line C4-2. However, pretreatment of C4-2 cells with the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 restored paclitaxel inhibition of the AR. Treatment of 22Rv1 xenografts in mice with docetaxel induced mitotic arrest and a decrease in PSA expression in tumor cells adjacent to vascular vessels. We further showed that paclitaxel induces nuclear accumulation of FOXO1, a known AR suppressive nuclear factor, and increases the association of FOXO1 with AR proteins in the nucleus. FOXO1 knockdown with small interfering RNA attenuated the inhibitory effect of paclitaxel on AR transcriptional activity, expression of PSA and Nkx3.1, and cell survival.

Some prostate cancer cells express constitutively active Akt/protein kinase B due to a complete loss of lipid phosphatase PTEN gene, a negative regulator of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. Constitutively active Akt promotes cellular survival and resistance to chemotherapy and radiation. We have recently noticed that some human prostate cancer cells are resistant to TRAIL. We therefore examined the intracellular mechanisms of cellular resistance to TRAIL. The cell lines expressing the highest level of constitutively active Akt were more resistant to undergo apoptosis by TRAIL than those expressing the lowest level. Down-regulation of constitutively active Akt by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, reversed cellular resistance to TRAIL. Treatment of resistant cells with cycloheximide (a protein synthesis inhibitor) rendered cells sensitive to TRAIL. Transfecting dominant negative Akt decreased Akt activity and increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis in cells with high Akt activity. Conversely, transfecting constitutively active Akt into cells with low Akt activity increased Akt activity and attenuated TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of TRAIL sensitivity occurs at the level of BID cleavage, as caspase-8 activity was not affected. Enforced expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 or Bcl-X(L) inhibited TRAIL-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. We therefore identify Akt as a constitutively active kinase that promotes survival of prostate cancer cells and demonstrate that modulation of Akt activity, by pharmacological or genetic approaches, alters the cellular responsiveness to TRAIL. Thus, TRAIL in combination with agents that down-regulate Akt activity can be used to treat prostate cancer.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The protein kinase Akt plays an important role in cell proliferation and survival in many cancers, including prostate cancer. Due to its kinase activity, it serves as a molecular conduit for inhibiting apoptosis and promoting angiogenesis in most cell types. In most of the prostate tumors, Akt signaling is constitutively activated due to the deletion or mutation of the tumor suppressor PTEN, which negatively regulates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase through lipid phosphatase activity. Recently, we identified a natural compound, psoralidin, which inhibits Akt phosphorylation, and its consequent activation in androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC) cells. Furthermore, ectopic expression of Akt renders AIPC cells resistant to chemotherapy; however, psoralidin overcomes Akt-mediated resistance and induces apoptosis in AIPC cells. While dissecting the molecular events, both upstream and downstream of Akt, we found that psoralidin inhibits phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation and transcriptionally represses the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and its target genes (Bcl-2, Survivin, and Bcl-xL, etc.), which results in the inhibition of cell viability and induction of apoptosis in PC-3 and DU-145 cells. Interestingly, psoralidin selectively targets cancer cells without causing any toxicity to normal prostate epithelial cells. In vivo xenograft assays substantiate these in vitro findings and show that psoralidin inhibits prostate tumor growth in nude mice. Our findings are of therapeutic significance in the management of prostate cancer patients with advanced or metastatic disease, as they provide new directions for the development of a phytochemical-based platform for prevention and treatment strategies for AIPC.",

In phase II trials of patients with cancer, response to microtubule inhibitors increases when these drugs are combined with estramustine. We aimed to assess whether combining estramustine with chemotherapy increases survival in patients with castration-refractory prostate cancer.;We systematically searched for randomised clinical trials that compared chemotherapy regimens with and without estramustine in patients with histologically-proven prostate cancer and were published between 1966 and 2004. Data from these studies were verified centrally and updated individual patient data were analysed. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Secondary endpoints were prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, time to PSA progression, and toxicity. A Cox regression model that was stratified by trial and adjusted for covariates at baseline was used.;The initial search identified seven eligible trials that included 742 patients, from which data from five trials including 605 patients had been collected. Individual patient data from two trials (137 patients) were no longer available. The 605 patients had been accrued between Jan 1, 1993 and Dec 1, 2003 and randomly assigned to chemotherapy plus estramustine or to chemotherapy without estramustine. Chemotherapy (with or without estramustine) consisted of docetaxel, paclitaxel, ixabepilone, and vinblastine. Median follow-up was 2.8 years (range 0.0-3.4), and 510 deaths had occurred by the end of follow-up. Cox regression analysis stratified by trial showed that concentrations of serum haemoglobin (p<0.0001), use of chemotherapy plus estramustine (p=0.008), performance status (p=0.002), and serum PSA concentrations (p=0.04) were associated independently with overall survival. Overall survival was significantly better in patients assigned chemotherapy plus estramustine (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.77 [95% CI 0.63-0.93], p=0.008). Estimated absolute increase in overall survival when estramustine was added to chemotherapy was 9.5% (SE 4.0) at 1 year after randomisation. We did not note a significant association between treatment effect on overall survival and age, concentration of serum haemoglobin, performance status, or serum PSA concentration. Patients who received chemotherapy plus estramustine had a better PSA response than those who received chemotherapy without estramustine (RR 0.53 [0.38-0.72], p<0.0001). Time to PSA progression was significantly longer in patients assigned chemotherapy plus estramustine than in those assigned chemotherapy without estramustine (HR 0.74 [0.58-0.94], p=0.01). Patients assigned chemotherapy and estramustine had more grade 3 or grade 4 thromboembolic events compared with those assigned chemotherapy without estramustine (12 of 271 vs 1 of 275).;In patients with castration-refractory prostate cancer, addition of estramustine to chemotherapy increases time to PSA progression and overall survival compared with chemotherapy without estramustine. However, this benefit should be balanced with the risk of increased thromboembolic events in patients who receive estramustine and chemotherapy in combination compared with chemotherapy without estramustine.",

Akt is strongly inhibited by perifosine, an orally active alkyl-lysophospholipid currently being evaluated as an anti-cancer agent in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. To determine whether perifosine may enhance the antitumor activity of the anti-EGF receptor monoclonal antibody cetuximab/C225 in PTEN-deficient cancer cells, we exposed MDA468 breast cancer cells (which contain mutated PTEN gene) and PC3 prostate cancer cells (in which the PTEN gene is deleted) to perifosine and cetuximab, alone and in combination. Treatment of the cells with perifosine reduced baseline levels of phosphorylated Akt, phosphorylated p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and p38MAPK, and increased baseline levels of phosphorylated stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/c-jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK). A 72-h exposure of the MDA468 and PC3 cells to perifosine alone resulted in cell death in a dose-dependent manner, which was enhanced by cetuximab. Addition of subtoxic doses of perifosine to cetuximab treatment also enhanced the cetuximab-induced growth inhibition. The combination treatment enhanced the inhibition of phosphorylation of Akt, p44/42MAPK and p38MAPK, but offset the phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK that was activated by perifosine treatment alone. Taken together, the data showed that perifosine enhances the antitumor activity of cetuximab in PTEN-deficient cancer cells. Further evaluation of the combination treatment in preclinical and clinical studies is warranted.",

However, the detailed mechanism by which sodium selenite specifically kills tumor cells remains unclear. Herein, we demonstrated that supranutritional doses of selenite-induced apoptosis in CRC cells through reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent modulation of the PI3K/AKT/FoxO3a signaling pathway. First, we found that selenite treatment in HCT116 and SW480 CRC cells caused inhibition of AKT and the nuclear accumulation of FoxO3a by western blot and immunofluorescence analyses, respectively, thereby facilitating transcription of the target genes bim and PTEN. Modulation of the AKT/FoxO3a/Bim signaling pathway by chemical inhibitors or RNA interference revealed that these events were critical for selenite-induced apoptosis in CRC cells. Additionally, we discovered that FoxO3a-mediated upregulation of PTEN exerted a further inhibitory effect on the AKT survival pathway. We also corroborated our findings in vivo by performing immunohistochemistry experiments. In summary, our results show that selenite could induce ROS-dependent FoxO3a-mediated apoptosis in CRC cells and xenograft tumors through PTEN-mediated inhibition of the PI3K/AKT survival axis. These results help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying selenite-induced cell death in tumor cells and provide a theoretical basis for translational applications of selenium.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Prostate cancer (PCa) is a clinically heterogeneous disease and current treatment strategies are based largely on anatomical and pathological parameters. In the recent past, several DNA sequencing studies of primary and advanced PCa have revealed recurrent patterns of genomic aberrations that expose mechanisms of resistance to available therapies and potential new drug targets. Suppression of androgen receptor (AR) signalling is the cornerstone of advanced prostate cancer treatment. Genomic aberrations of the androgen receptor or alternative splicing of its mRNA are increasingly recognised as biomarkers of resistance to AR-targeted therapies such as abiraterone or enzalutamide. Genomic aberrations of the PI3K-AKT axis, in particular affecting PTEN, are common in PCa, and compounds targeting different kinases in this pathway are showing promise in clinical trials. Both germline and somatic defects in DNA repair genes have been shown to sensitise some patients to therapy with PARP inhibition. In addition, abnormalities in mismatch-repair genes are associated with response to immune checkpoint inhibition in other solid tumours and present a tantalising therapeutic avenue to be pursued. Aberrations in CDK4/6-RB1 pathway genes occur in a subset of PCas, may associate with differential sensitivity to treatment, and are likely to have clinical implications beyond prognostication. Inhibitors of CDK4/6 are already being tested in prostate cancer clinical trials. Furthermore, deletions of RB1 are strongly associated with a neuroendocrine phenotype, a rare condition characterized by a non-AR-driven transcriptomic profile. Finally, aberrations in genes involved in regulating the chromatin structure are an emerging area of interest. Deletions of CHD1 are not infrequent in PCa and may associate with increased AR activity and genomic instability, and these tumours could benefit from DNA-damaging therapies. This review summarises how genomic discoveries in PCa are changing the treatment landscape of advanced CRPC, both by identifying biomarkers of resistance and by identifying vulnerabilities to be targeted.

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are known to promote differentiation and inhibit proliferation. Previously published reports from other organ systems led us to investigate a mechanistic relationship between PTEN and BMP signaling in prostate epithelial cells.;We analyzed growth rate and PTEN expression in E6, BPH-1, and C4-2B prostate epithelial cells treated with BMP-4. We also treated doxacyclin-inducible PTEN-C4-2B cells with BMP-4 and doxacyclin to determine the effect of BMP on growth and PTEN expression in conditions of increasing PTEN expression. We determined the dependency of BMP-mediated growth inhibition via siRNA knockdown of PTEN expression and BMP treatment. We determined PTEN protein stability by determining the effect of BMP-4 on PTEN protein at time points after treatment with cyclohexamide, a translation inhibitor.;We found that BMP-4 induces PTEN in E6 and BPH-1 cells and reduces proliferation. Knockdown of PTEN attenuated the growth-inhibiting effects of BMP-4 in these cells. BMP-4 had no effect in PTEN-negative C4-2B cells, but doxacyclin-driven PTEN C4-2B cells responded to BMP-4 with enhanced PTEN and growth inhibition. BMP-4 also increased PTEN protein stability.;BMP signaling induces PTEN expression and sustains PTEN protein expression resulting in inhibition of prostate epithelial cell growth. These data are the first to identify a mechanistic linkage between BMP signaling and PTEN in the prostate, both of which are independently identified as tumor suppressors and suggest possible coordinate dysregulation in prostate cancer.",

As a key enzyme for FA synthesis fatty acid synthase (FASN) is often overexpressed in human prostate cancers and its expression correlates with worse prognosis and poor survival. P300 is an acetyltransferase that acts as a transcription co-activator. Increasing evidence suggests that P300 is a major PCa promoter, although the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that P300 binds to and increases histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27Ac) in the FASN gene promoter. We provided evidence that P300 transcriptionally upregulates FASN expression and promotes lipid accumulation in human PCa cells in culture and Pten knockout prostate tumors in mice. Pharmacological inhibition of P300 decreased FASN expression and lipid droplet accumulation in PCa cells. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that expression of P300 protein positively correlates with FASN protein levels in a cohort of human PCa specimens. We further showed that FASN is a key mediator of P300-induced growth of PCa cells in culture and in mice. Together, our findings demonstrate P300 as a key factor that regulates FASN expression, lipid accumulation and cell growth in PCa.

The aim of this study was to evaluate if the hormonal therapy with BCLT can affect the EGFR-targeted therapy using primary cultures obtained from 22 human PCa tissues harvested after radical prostatectomy (RP) in patients who received (n=10) BCLT and those that did not (n=12) as neoadjuvant hormone therapy (NHT). We demonstrated that cultures derived from PCa tissues harvested after NHT presented significantly higher EGFR and Her2 levels compared to cultures derived from control patients. However, cultures derived from patients with NHT were less sensitive to gefitinib when compared to cultures derived from control patients. Conversely, BCLT effectiveness did not seem to be different in the two groups and was partially additive with gefitinib in the NHT group and additive/synergistic in the control group. Cultures (8/22) were negative for the expression of the PTEN gene and we observed no differences in the two groups. Thus the different IC50 values observed for gefitinib and the partial additivity in the combination treatment with gefitinib and BCLT is influenced by EGFR/Her2 ratio because it was shown that EGFR inhibition was lower when Her2 is overexpressed. Taken together, our results indicate that anti-EGFR targeted therapies and a possible combination therapy involving gefitinib and BCLT should be performed early in naive patients when Her2 is not overexpressed and before the anti-androgenic hormone therapy induces such an undesirable effect.",

As yet, there are no validated descriptions of prostate cancer subgroups derived from integrated genomics linked with clinical outcome.;In a study of 482 tumour, benign and germline samples from 259 men with primary prostate cancer, we used integrative analysis of copy number alterations (CNA) and array transcriptomics to identify genomic loci that affect expression levels of mRNA in an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) approach, to stratify patients into subgroups that we then associated with future clinical behaviour, and compared with either CNA or transcriptomics alone.;We identified five separate patient subgroups with distinct genomic alterations and expression profiles based on 100 discriminating genes in our separate discovery and validation sets of 125 and 103 men. These subgroups were able to consistently predict biochemical relapse (p = 0.0017 and p = 0.016 respectively) and were further validated in a third cohort with long-term follow-up (p = 0.027). We show the relative contributions of gene expression and copy number data on phenotype, and demonstrate the improved power gained from integrative analyses. We confirm alterations in six genes previously associated with prostate cancer (MAP3K7, MELK, RCBTB2, ELAC2, TPD52, ZBTB4), and also identify 94 genes not previously linked to prostate cancer progression that would not have been detected using either transcript or copy number data alone. We confirm a number of previously published molecular changes associated with high risk disease, including MYC amplification, and NKX3-1, RB1 and PTEN deletions, as well as over-expression of PCA3 and AMACR, and loss of MSMB in tumour tissue. A subset of the 100 genes outperforms established clinical predictors of poor prognosis (PSA, Gleason score), as well as previously published gene signatures (p = 0.0001). We further show how our molecular profiles can be used for the early detection of aggressive cases in a clinical setting, and inform treatment decisions.;For the first time in prostate cancer this study demonstrates the importance of integrated genomic analyses incorporating both benign and tumour tissue data in identifying molecular alterations leading to the generation of robust gene sets that are predictive of clinical outcome in independent patient cohorts.",

The first phase, which is the growth of the androgen-dependent cancer (AD-Ca) responds well to androgen depletion treatment while the second phase, that could be termed as androgen depletion-independent cancer (ADI-Ca) does not. We used two separate prostate tumors, one AD-Ca and one ADI-Ca from the conditional Pten deletion mouse model to generate from each a pair of cell lines. The AD-Ca cell lines (E2 and E4) and the ADI-Ca cell lines (cE1 and cE2) display bi-allelic deletion at the Pten gene locus, an event which is specific for the prostate epithelium for this mouse model, and a fairly similar level of expression of the androgen receptor (AR). The ADI-Ca cell lines (cE series) grow well in the absence of androgen, display increased AR transcription under androgen-deprived environment, and retain the sensitivity to increased proliferation when androgen is supplemented. The AD-Ca cell lines (E series) grow slowly in the absence of androgen, and, unlike cE cells, do not show increased AR expression when maintained in the absence of androgen. The detection of epithelial cell markers, such as CK8, CK14, CK18 and E-cadherin in the cE series is conforming with the polygonal epithelial morphology of these cells in culture. The E cells also present mostly polygonal-shaped morphology with a small percent of cells with fibroblastoid morphology, and produce little or very low levels of cytokeratins, but increased levels of vimentin, Twist and Slug, the markers known to be associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Each of the cell lines, when inoculated subcutaneously into male or female NOD.SCID mice induced tumors within eight weeks with 100% incidence. Histopathological examinations of the tumor sections, however, led to noticeable biological differences. The cE series engenders adenocarcinomas, particularly in male hosts, and the E series induces sarcomatoid carcinomas (positively stained for CK8 and AR as well as vimentin expression) in either male or female hosts. These new cell lines are promising models for the elucidation of the androgen metabolism and their role in prostate cancer.",

Prostate cancer cells transfected with EP4-siRNA and treatments with EP4 antagonist suggest a link between EP4, and Snail activation, potentially via p-Akt. Cells treated with EP4 antagonist exhibited a significant decrease in Snail, mesenchymal markers and cell migration, and cell cycle arrest with a gain in E-cadherin levels.;Our findings provide key evidence that support there being a role of PGE(2)/EP4/p-Akt in Snail signaling and conferring cell survival advantage.

Cells were exposed to various concentrations of ethanolic neem leaf extract (ENLE) (25-125 μg/ml). The doses were fixed by cell viability (MTT) assay. For apoptotic detection in situ apoptosis assay, caspase-3 activity and protein expression of cytochrome c and Poly-ADP Ribose Polymerase (PARP) were analysed as well as mRNA expression of Bcl-2 family proteins was studied by RT-PCR. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and p-Akt were analysed by western blotting and mRNA expression of Akt 1 and 2, PTEN was performed by RT-PCR. Immunoblotting of cyclin D1 and p21 was done to access the inhibition of cell proliferation.;ENLE gives 50% inhibition at a dose of 100 μg/ml in both PC-3 and LNCaP cells and considered as effective dose. ENLE decreased the protein expression of PI3K as well as p-Akt and the mRNA expression of Akt 1and 2 in both the cells. There was a significant decrease in mRNA expression of PTEN in LNCaP cells. ENLE induced apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation by inhibiting PI3K/Akt pathway. Decrease in p-Akt leads to increase in the protein level of Bad, p21 and decrease in the cyclin D1, respectively. ENLE treatment increased the cytochrome c expression and caspase-3 activity as well as regulated the mRNA expression of Bcl-2 family proteins thereby inducing apoptosis to both the cell lines. In situ apoptosis assay showed increased red fluorescence in 100 μg/ml of ENLE in both PC-3 and LNCaP cell lines.;The results suggested that ENLE induces apoptosis and inhibits cell proliferation through inhibiting PI3K/Akt pathway in both PC-3 and LNCaP cells.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains largely dependent on androgen receptor (AR). Residual tissue androgens are consistently detected within CRPC tumors and play a critical role in facilitating AR-mediated signaling pathways which lead to disease progression. Testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) are the major androgens detected in tumors. They are produced through three biosynthesis pathways: Δ(4), Δ(5), and backdoor pathways. Both androgens bind to and stimulate AR activation. The current study investigates the effects of pomegranate extracts (POM) and their ability to inhibit androgen biosynthesis using PCa cell lines (22RV1 and LNCaP) in vitro as well as the PTEN knockout mouse model representing prostate cancer. Steroids were extracted using ethyl acetate or solid phase extraction, and then analyzed by UPLC/MS/MS. The results showed that POM (0-12μg/mL) reduced the production of testosterone, DHT, DHEA, androstenedione, androsterone, and pregnenolone in both cell lines. In addition our in vivo data supports this observation with a reduction in serum steroids determined after 20 weeks of POM treatment (0.17 g/L in drinking water). In accordance with these results, Western blotting of cell lysates and tPSA analysis determined that PSA was significantly decreased by the treatment of POM. Interestingly, AKR1C3 and AR levels were shown to be increased in both cell lines, perhaps as a negative feedback effect in response to steroid inhibition. Overall, these results provide mechanistic evidence to support the rationale for recent clinical reports describing efficacy of POM in CRPC patients.",

Overexpression of the Bcl-2 family members, including Mcl-1, in PCa cells is known to inhibit intracellular mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis. Here we report the development of a novel transgenic mouse model that spontaneously develops prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and adenocarcinoma by the inducible, conditional knockout of transforming growth factor β receptor type II in stromal fibroblastic cells (Tgfbr2(ColTKO)). The Tgfbr2(ColTKO) prostate epithelia demonstrated down-regulation of luminal and basal differentiation markers, as well as Pten expression and up-regulation of Mcl-1. However, unlike in men, Tgfbr2(ColTKO) prostates exhibited no regression acutely after castration. The administration of Sabutoclax (BI-97C1), a pan-active Bcl-2 protein family antagonist mediated apoptosis in castrate-resistant PCa cells of Tgfbr2(ColTKO) mice and human subcutaneous, orthotopic, and intratibial xenograft PCa models. Interestingly, Sabutoclax had little apoptotic effect on benign prostate tissue in Tgfbr2(ColTKO) and wild-type mice. Sabutoclax was able to block c-Met activation, a critical axis in PCa metastatic progression. Further, Sabutoclax synergistically sensitized PC-3 cells to the cytotoxic effects of docetaxel (Taxotere). Together, these data suggest that Sabutoclax inhibits castrate-resistant PCa alone at the primary and bone metastatic site as well as support sensitivity to docetaxel treatment.",

Cell survival was evaluated by clonogenic assay or sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay upon irradiation in the absence or presence of the AR antagonist enzalutamide.;PTEN loss resulted in upregulation of AR expression in a PDGF-D dependent manner and irradiation selectively increased the nuclear AR protein level and its activity in a murine cell model.

Similarly to the murine model, PDGF-D overexpression increased the nuclear AR level and its transcriptional activity in LNCaP cells. PDGF-D over-expression was associated with radioresistance and enzalutamide treatment effectively reversed PDGF-D-mediated radioresistance in LNCaP cells.;We have demonstrated that AR, a target of the PTEN and PDGF D-downstream signaling program, contributes to radiation resistance in human PCa cells.

In a recent screen for mediators of resistance to IGF-1R inhibitor AZ12253801, we identified RAD51, required for the strand invasion step of HR. These findings prompted us to test the hypothesis that IGF-1R-inhibited cells accumulate DSBs formed at endogenous DNA lesions, and depend on residual HR for their repair. Indeed, initial experiments showed time-dependent accumulation of γH2AX foci in IGF-1R -inhibited or -depleted prostate cancer cells. We then tested effects of suppressing HR, and found that RAD51 depletion enhanced AZ12253801 sensitivity in PTEN wild-type prostate cancer cells but not in cells lacking functional PTEN. Similar sensitization was induced in prostate cancer cells by depletion of BRCA2, required for RAD51 loading onto DNA, and in BRCA2(-/-) colorectal cancer cells, compared with isogenic BRCA2(+/-) cells. We also assessed chemical HR inhibitors, finding that RAD51 inhibitor BO2 blocked RAD51 focus formation and sensitized to AZ12253801. Finally, we tested CDK1 inhibitor RO-3306, which impairs HR by inhibiting CDK1-mediated BRCA1 phosphorylation. R0-3306 suppressed RAD51 focus formation consistent with HR attenuation, and sensitized prostate cancer cells to IGF-1R inhibition, with 2.4-fold reduction in AZ12253801 GI50 and 13-fold reduction in GI80. These data suggest that responses to IGF-1R inhibition are enhanced by genetic and chemical approaches to suppress HR, defining a population of cancers (PTEN wild-type, BRCA mutant) that may be intrinsically sensitive to IGF-1R inhibitory drugs.",

Since inactivation of the AKT/protein kinase B negative regulator gene PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) is common in prostate cancer (PCa), we compared PTEN wild-type DU145 PCa cells (low basal AKT activity) with PTEN-mutant LNCaP PCa cells (high basal AKT activity) for their apoptosis responses to the methylselenol precursor methylseleninic acid (MSeA) and sodium selenite, an inorganic salt. Our results show that LNCaP cells withstood approximately 4 times higher doses of MSeA than DU145 cells, although they were slightly more sensitive than the latter to selenite-induced apoptosis. Treatment by MSeA modestly attenuated AKT phosphorylation and increased phospho-ERK1/2 in LNCaP cells. Selenite treatment increased the phosphorylation of p53 Ser15 and both kinases, but the selenite-induced apoptosis was not influenced by chemical inhibitors of either kinase. In contrast, PI3K/AKT inhibitors greatly sensitized LNCaP cells to apoptosis induced by MSeA, accompanied by increased mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and multiple caspase activation without changing p53 Ser15 phosphorylation. The apoptosis was further accentuated by extracellular signal regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) inhibition without further increase in cytochrome c release. The general caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk completely blocked MSeA-induced apoptosis when both kinases were inhibited, whereas a caspase-8 inhibitor exerted a greater protection than did a caspase-9 inhibitor. Transfection of DU145 cells with a constitutively active AKT increased their resistance to MSeA-induced apoptosis. In summary, AKT played an important role in regulating apoptosis sensitivity of LNCaP and DU145 cells to MSeA. An MSeA-induced activation of ERK1/2 in LNCaP cells also contributed to resistance to apoptosis. However, these kinases did not significantly regulate caspase-mediated apoptosis induced by selenite in LNCaP cells. These findings support the differential involvement of these protein kinase pathways in regulating apoptosis induction by different forms of selenium.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Irreversible cell growth arrest, a process termed cellular senescence, is emerging as an intrinsic tumor suppressive mechanism. Oncogene-induced senescence is thought to be invariably preceded by hyperproliferation, aberrant replication, and activation of a DNA damage checkpoint response (DDR), rendering therapeutic enhancement of this process unsuitable for cancer treatment. We previously demonstrated in a mouse model of prostate cancer that inactivation of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (Pten) elicits a senescence response that opposes tumorigenesis. Here, we show that Pten-loss-induced cellular senescence (PICS) represents a senescence response that is distinct from oncogene-induced senescence and can be targeted for cancer therapy. Using mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we determined that PICS occurs rapidly after Pten inactivation, in the absence of cellular proliferation and DDR. Further, we found that PICS is associated with enhanced p53 translation. Consistent with these data, we showed that in mice p53-stabilizing drugs potentiated PICS and its tumor suppressive potential. Importantly, we demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of PTEN drives senescence and inhibits tumorigenesis in vivo in a human xenograft model of prostate cancer. Taken together, our data identify a type of cellular senescence that can be triggered in nonproliferating cells in the absence of DNA damage, which we believe will be useful for developing a \"pro-senescence\" approach for cancer prevention and therapy.",

We have previously reported that Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase alpha (PIP5Kα), is a lipid kinase that links to CDK1 and AR pathways. The discovery of PIP5Kα inhibitor highlight the potential of PIP5K1α as a drug target in PCa. In this study, we show that AR-V7 expression positively correlates with PIP5K1α in tumor specimens from PCa patients. Overexpression of AR-V7 increases PIP5K1α, promotes rapid growth of PCa in xenograft mice, whereas inhibition of PIP5K1α by its inhibitor ISA-2011B suppresses the growth and invasiveness of xenograft tumors overexpressing AR-V7. PIP5K1α is a key co-factor for both AR-V7 and AR, which are present as protein-protein complexes predominantly in the nucleus of PCa cells. In addition, PIP5K1α and CDK1 influence AR-V7 expression also through AKT-associated mechanism dependent on PTEN-status. ISA-2011B disrupts protein stabilization of AR-V7 which is dependent on PIP5K1α, leading to suppression of invasive growth of AR-V7-high tumors in xenograft mice. Our study suggests that combination of enzalutamide and PIP5K1α may have a significant impact on refining therapeutic strategies to circumvent resistance to antiandrogen therapies.",

For this reason, inhibition of such targets is an exciting avenue for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to treat patients with advanced PCa. Previous reports demonstrated that HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) increases DNA damage and induce greater apoptosis in PCa cell lines that express androgen receptor (AR). In this study we utilized the AR negative PCa cell line and observed that re-expression of AR (PC3-AR) results in greater levels of apoptosis when treated with the pan-DACi, panobinostat (PAN). PAN mediated apoptosis in PC3 and PC3-AR cells was associated with increased levels of double strand DNA breaks, indicated by p-ɣH2AX. Further, PAN treatment in PC3-AR cells resulted in moderate attenuation of the ATM-Akt-ERK DNA damage response pathway. For this reason, we combined PAN with the dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitor, BEZ235. Combination of PAN with BEZ235 resulted in significant attenuation of the DNA damage repair protein ATM and significantly increased anti-tumor activity compared to each single treatment. Overall, superior anti-tumor activity with combination of PAN with BEZ235 was independent of AR status. These findings suggest that this therapeutic strategy should be further developed in clinical trials. ",

        "Doc_abstract":": Elucidating the cell of origin of cancer has great significance in stratifying patients into appropriate treatment groups and for developing novel targeted therapies. Early studies demonstrate that only stem-like basal cells in the normal human prostate (NHP) can function as the cell of origin for prostate cancer (PCa). Here, we show that the organoids derived from bulk NHP luminal cells can also be tumorigenically transformed. We further show that the WIT medium, which is used to culture human mammary epithelial progenitor cells, when combined with the ROCK inhibitor, can readily propagate a population of progenitor-like cells from the primary NHP luminal cell isolates. Such functionally defined luminal progenitors can be transformed by distinct sets of genetic perturbations (i.e., AR+AKT/ERG or c-MYC+PTEN knockout) to form tumor glands. Genome-wide RNA-Seq analysis of freshly purified unperturbed human benign prostatic basal and luminal cells and culture-expanded lineage-specific stem/progenitor populations reveals that the luminal progenitors possess a distinct gene expression profile that is greatly enriched in advanced, castration-resistant, and metastatic PCa, and it associates with poor patient survival. The ability of the simple two-dimensional culture system reported herein to greatly enrich NHP progenitor-like cells should facilitate biological and biochemical studies as well as high-throughput screening in these cells and in progenitor-like PCa cells.;The development of a novel two-dimensional cell culture system demonstrated that the luminal progenitor cells in adult human prostate can serve as a cell of origin for prostate cancer.",

ErbB2 recruitment potentiated EGF-induced signals and was associated with the most pronounced effects of EGF despite low EGFR expression. In this way, the sum of EGFR and ErbB2 receptor phosphorylation proved to be a more sensitive indicator of EGF-induced proliferation than quantification of the expression of either receptor alone. Both Akt and ERK were rapidly phosphorylated in response to EGF, with ERK phosphorylation being the weakest in PC3 cells.

        "Doc_abstract":"The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/AKT signaling cascades play critical roles in the transmission of signals from growth factor receptors to regulate gene expression and prevent apoptosis. Components of these pathways are mutated or aberrantly expressed in human cancer (e.g., Ras, B-Raf, PI3K, PTEN, Akt). Also, mutations occur at genes encoding upstream receptors (e.g., EGFR and Flt-3) and chimeric chromosomal translocations (e.g., BCR-ABL) which transmit their signals through these cascades. These pathways interact with each other to regulate growth and in some cases tumorigenesis. For example, in some cells, PTEN mutation may contribute to suppression of the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade due to the ability of elevated activated Akt levels to phosphorylate and inactivate Raf-1. We have investigated the genetic structures and functional roles of these two signaling pathways in the malignant transformation and drug resistance of hematopoietic, breast and prostate cancer cells. Although both of these pathways are commonly thought to have anti-apoptotic and drug resistance effects on cells, they display different cell-lineage-specific effects. Induced Raf expression can abrogate the cytokine dependence of certain hematopoietic cell lines (FDC-P1 and TF-1), a trait associated with tumorigenesis. In contrast, expression of activated PI3K or Akt does not abrogate the cytokine dependence of these hematopoietic cell lines, but does have positive effects on cell survival. However, activated PI3K and Akt can synergize with activated Raf to abrogate the cytokine dependence of another hematopoietic cell line (FL5.12) which is not transformed by activated Raf expression by itself. Activated Raf and Akt also confer a drug-resistant phenotype to these cells. Raf is more associated with proliferation and the prevention of apoptosis while Akt is more associated with the long-term clonogenicity. In breast cancer cells, activated Raf conferred resistance to the chemotherapeutic drugs doxorubicin and paclitaxel. Raf induced the expression of the drug pump Mdr-1 (a.k.a., Pgp) and the Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic protein. Raf did not appear to induce drug resistance by altering p53/p21Cip-1 expression, whose expression is often linked to regulation of cell cycle progression and drug resistance. Deregulation of the PI3K/PTEN/Akt pathway was associated with resistance to doxorubicin and 4-hydroxyl tamoxifen, a chemotherapeutic drug and estrogen receptor antagonist used in breast cancer therapy. In contrast to the drug-resistant breast cancer cells obtained after overexpression of activated Raf, cells expressing activated Akt displayed altered (decreased) levels of p53/p21Cip-1. Deregulated expression of the central phosphatase in the PI3K/PTEN/Akt pathway led to breast cancer drug resistance. Introduction of mutated forms of PTEN, which lacked lipid phosphatase activity, increased the resistance of the MCF-7 cells to doxorubicin, suggesting that these lipid phosphatase deficient PTEN mutants acted as dominant negative mutants to suppress wild-type PTEN activity. Finally, the PI3K/PTEN/Akt pathway appears to be more prominently involved in prostate cancer drug resistance than the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. Some advanced prostate cancer cells express elevated levels of activated Akt which may suppress Raf activation. Introduction of activated forms of Akt increased the drug resistance of advanced prostate cancer cells. In contrast, introduction of activated forms of Raf did not increase the drug resistance of the prostate cancer cells. In contrast to the results observed in hematopoietic cells, Raf may normally promote differentiation in prostate cells which is suppressed in advanced prostate cancer due to increased expression of activated Akt arising from PTEN mutation. Thus in advanced prostate cancer it may be advantageous to induce Raf expression to promote differentiation, while in hematopoietic cancers it may be beneficial to inhibit Raf/MEK/ERK-induced proliferation. These signaling and anti-apoptotic pathways can have different effects on growth, prevention of apoptosis and induction of drug resistance in cells of various lineages which may be due to the expression of lineage-specific factors."},

Molecular subset analysis using pre-existing phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) deletion data revealed that loss of p(Ser2448) -mTOR expression is of prognostic relevance and defines a subpopulation of PTEN-deleted and ERG-fusion-positive cancers with a particular poor outcome. The results of our study strongly suggest that loss of p(Ser2448)-mTOR expression is a marker for activated AKT/mTOR signaling. Tumors with concomitant PTEN deletion and activated mTOR signaling indicated by loss of p(Ser2448)-mTOR expression characterize a small (4%) but clinically significant subset of prostate cancers that might optimally benefit from anti-mTOR therapies.",

In order to investigate whether selenium modulates Akt by hitherto unidentified molecular mechanisms, we examined the effect of selenium on the stability and activity of Akt. Selenium induced destabilization of Akt which is coupled to its own enzyme activation. Mutation of T308 and S473 of Akt to alanine as well as the inhibition or depletion of upstream kinases for Akt activation blocked Akt degradation. These features of Akt degradation are reminiscent of the 'activation-induced suicidal degradation' mechanism. PTEN was also required for Akt destabilization as Akt activation alone was unable to elicit Akt degradation in the absence of PTEN. Conversely, PTEN introduction in PTEN-null prostate cancer cells restored the ability to degrade Akt upon selenium treatment. Collectively, selenium seems to achieve ultimate negative regulation of Akt signaling by destabilizing the protein, and this regulation mechanism might provide a paradigm for the anti-cancer activity of selenium.",

        "Doc_abstract":"One of the foremost problems in the prostate cancer (PCa) field is the inability to distinguish aggressive from indolent disease, which leads to difficult prognoses and thousands of unnecessary surgeries. This limitation stems from the fact that the mechanisms of tumorigenesis in the prostate are poorly understood. Some genetic alterations are commonly reported in prostate tumors, including upregulation of Myc, fusion of Ets genes to androgen-regulated promoters, and loss of Pten. However, the specific roles of these aberrations in tumor initiation and progression are poorly understood. Likewise, the cell of origin for PCa remains controversial and may be linked to the aggressive potential of the tumor. One important clue is that prostate tumors co-express basal and luminal protein markers that are restricted to their distinct cell types in normal tissue. Prostate epithelium contains layer-specific stem cells as well as rare bipotent cells, which can differentiate into basal or luminal cells. We hypothesize that the primary oncogenic cell of origin is a transient-differentiating bipotent cell. Such a cell must maintain tight temporal and spatial control of differentiation pathways, thus increasing its susceptibility for oncogenic disruption. In support of this hypothesis, many of the pathways known to be involved in prostate differentiation can be linked to genes commonly altered in PCa. In this article, we review what is known about important differentiation pathways (Myc, p38MAPK, Notch, PI3K/Pten) in the prostate and how their misregulation could lead to oncogenesis. Better understanding of normal differentiation will offer new insights into tumor initiation and may help explain the functional significance of common genetic alterations seen in PCa. Additionally, this understanding could lead to new methods for classifying prostate tumors based on their differentiation status and may aid in identifying more aggressive tumors. ",

In the CAF, we show that BMP2 or BMP7, but not transforming growth factor beta-1, can strikingly stimulate secretion of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), also known as CXCL12. The CAF cells express type I and type II BMP receptors as well as the receptor for SDF-1, CXCR4. SDF-1 activation is associated with BMP-induced Smad phosphorylation, and the stimulatory effect is blocked by BMP antagonist, noggin. The findings that BMP treatment can increase SDF-1 pre-mRNA levels in a time-dependent manner and actinomycin D treatment can abolish stimulatory effect of BMP suggest a transcriptional modulation of SDF-1 by BMP signaling. Using a human microvascular endothelial cell line, we show that SDF-1 present in the conditioned medium from the stimulated CAF can significantly induce tube formation, an effect relating to angiogenic function. Furthermore, we found that BMP2 can also protect the CAF from serum starvation-induced apoptosis independent of SDF-1, implying that BMP may induce other factors to sustain the survival of these cells. In short, this report establishes a novel BMP-SDF-1 axis in the prostate tumor along with a new prosurvival effect of BMP that when considered together with our previously described oncogenic properties of BMP indicate a circuitry for heterotypic cell interactions potentially critical in prostate cancer.",

We have previously reported acute and late incidence of genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity; here we report protocol-defined 5-year relapse-free survival outcomes.;We did an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial at seven Dutch radiotherapy centres. We enrolled patients with intermediate-risk to high-risk T1b-T4NX-N0MX-M0 localised prostate cancer, a prostate-specific antigen concentration of 60 μg/L or less, and a WHO performance status of 0-2. We used a web-based application to randomly assign (1:1) patients to either hypofractionated radiotherapy of 64·6 Gy (19 fractions of 3·4 Gy, three fractions per week) or conventionally fractionated radiotherapy of 78·0 Gy (39 fractions of 2·0 Gy, five fractions per week). Based on an estimated α/β ratio for prostate cancer of 1·5 Gy, the equivalent total dose in fractions of 2·0 Gy was 90·4 Gy for hypofractionation compared with 78·0 Gy for conventional fractionation. The primary endpoint was relapse-free survival. All analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis in all eligible patients. The HYPRO trial completed recruitment in 2010 and follow-up is ongoing. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN85138529.;Between March 19, 2007, and Dec 3, 2010, 820 patients were enrolled, of whom 804 were eligible and assessable for intention-to-treat analyses.

However, the mechanisms on aberrant elevation of ARF in cancers are still poorly understood. We previously showed that ARF (p14ARF in human and p19Arf in mouse) elevation correlates with PTEN loss and stabilizes SLUG to reduce cell adhesion in prostate cancer (PCa). Here we report that ARF is essential for MMP7 expression, E-Cadherin decrease and the anchorage loss to the extracellular matrix (ECM) in PCa in vitro and in vivo. We found that Mmp7 is aberrantly elevated in cytosol and nucleus of malignant prostate tumors of Pten/Trp53 mutant mice. Interestingly, p19Arf deficiency strikingly decreases Mmp7 levels but increases E-Cadherin in Pten/Trp53/p19Arf mice. ARF knockdown markedly reduces MMP7 in human PCa cells. Conversely, tetracycline-inducible expression of ARF increases MMP7 with a decrease of E-Cadherin in PCa cells. Importantly, MMP7 physically binds ARF to show the co-localization in nucleus. Co-expression of MMP7 and ARF promotes cell migration, and MMP7 knockdown decreases wound healing in PCa cells. Furthermore, MMP7 elevation correlates with ARF expression in advanced human PCa.

When the cancer recurs, early stages can be controlled with hormone ablation therapy to delay the rate of cancer progression but, over time, the cancer overcomes its hormone dependence, becomes highly aggressive and metastasizes. Clinical trials have shown that pomegranate juice (PJ) inhibits PCa progression. We have previously shown that the PJ components luteolin (L), ellagic acid (E) and punicic acid (P) together inhibit growth of hormone-dependent and -independent PCa cells and inhibit their migration and chemotaxis towards CXCL12, a chemokine that is important in PCa metastasis. On the basis of these findings, we hypothesized that L+E+P inhibit PCa metastasis in vivo. To test this possibility, we used a severe combined immunodeficiency mouse model in which luciferase-expressing human PCa cells were injected subcutaneously near the prostate. Tumor progression was monitored with bioluminescence imaging weekly. We found that L+E+P inhibits PC-3M-luc primary tumor growth, inhibits the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis for metastasis and none of the tumors metastasized. In addition, L+E+P significantly inhibits growth and metastasis of highly invasive Pten (-/-) ;K-ras (G12D) prostate tumors. Furthermore, L+E+P inhibits angiogenesis in vivo, prevents human endothelial cell (EC) tube formation in culture and disrupts preformed EC tubes, indicating inhibition of EC adhesion to each other. L+E+P also inhibits the angiogenic factors interleukin-8 and vascular endothelial growth factor as well as their induced signaling pathways in ECs. In conclusion, these results show that L+E+P inhibits PCa progression and metastasis. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Using androgen receptor (AR) knockout mice to determine AR functions in selective prostate cancer (PCa) cells, we determined that AR might play differential roles in various cell types, either to promote or suppress PCa development/progression. These observations partially explain the failure of current androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to reduce/prevent androgen binding to AR in every cell. Herein, we identified the AR degradation enhancer ASC-J9, which selectively degrades AR protein via interruption of the AR-AR selective coregulator interaction. Such selective interruption could, therefore, suppress AR-mediated PCa growth in the androgen-sensitive stage before ADT and in the castration-resistant stage after ADT. Mechanistic dissection suggested that ASC-J9 could activate the proteasome-dependent pathway to promote AR degradation through the enhanced association of AR-Mdm2 complex. The consequences of ASC-J9-promoted AR degradation included reduced androgen binding to AR, AR N-C terminal interaction, and AR nuclear translocation. Such inhibitory regulation could then result in suppression of AR transactivation and AR-mediated cell growth in eight different mouse models, including intact or castrated nude mice xenografted with androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells or androgen-insensitive C81 cells and castrated nude mice xenografted with castration-resistant C4-2 and CWR22Rv1 cells, and TRAMP and Pten(+/-) mice.

PC3 cells, which lack the lipid phosphatase PTEN, were treated overnight with a reversible inhibitor of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, LY294002 (a treatment which was found to reversibly decrease Akt enzymatic activity). The inhibitor was then washed out and mRNA collected 2, 6, and 10 h later and compared by microarray analyses with mRNAs present immediately after removal of the inhibitor. One of the identified induced mRNAs, Fra-1, was further studied by transient transfections of a reporter construct containing its 5' regulatory region. This construct was found to be directly induced 4- to 5-fold by co-transfection with constitutively active Akt3 but not kinase dead Akt. The regulation by Akt3 was found to be due to two specific regions in the Fra-1 regulatory sequence which match Sp1 consensus sites. Finally, gel shift studies showed that the binding of Sp1 to one of these sites was dependent on the PI 3-kinase pathway. These results indicate that LY294002 treatment and washout is a useful method to study the activation of Akt in the context of a tumor cell.

Recent studies have suggested a potential synergy between vaccination and androgen ablation, yet the enhanced T-cell function is transient. Using a defined tumor antigen model, UV-8101-RE, we found that concomitant castration significantly increased the frequency and function of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells early after the immunization of wild-type mice. However, at a late time point after immunization, effector function was reduced to the same level as noncastrated mice and was accompanied by a concomitant amplification in CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Treg) following immunization. We investigated whether Treg expansion occurred following castration of prostate tumor-bearing mice. In the prostate-specific Pten(-/-) mouse model of prostate cancer, we observed an accelerated Treg expansion in mice bearing the castration-resistant endogenous prostate tumor, which prevented effector responses to UV-8101-RE. Treg depletion together with castration elicited a strong CD8(+) T-cell response to UV-8101-RE in Pten(-/-) mice and rescued effector function in castrated and immunized wild-type mice. In addition, Treg expansion in Pten(-/-) mice was prevented by in vivo interleukin (IL)-2 blockade suggesting that increased IL-2 generated by castration and immunization promotes Treg expansion. Our findings therefore suggest that although effector responses are augmented by castration, the concomitant expansion of Tregs is one mechanism responsible for only transient immune potentiation after androgen ablation.",

The DNA damage checkpoint barrier (γH2AX, pATM, p53) mechanism was activated during CaP tumorigenesis, albeit less and with delayed culmination compared to other cancers, possibly reflecting lower replication stress (slow proliferation despite cases of Rb loss and cyclin D1 overexpression) and progressive loss of ATM activator NKX3.1. Oxidative stress (8-oxoguanine lesions) and NQO1 increased during disease progression. NQO1 genotypes of 390 men did not indicate predisposition to CaP, yet loss of NQO1 in CaP suggested potential progression-opposing tumour suppressor role. TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement and PTEN loss, events sensitizing to PARPi, occurred frequently along with heterogeneous loss of DNA repair factors 53BP1, JMJD1C and Rev7 (all studied here for the first time in CaP) whose defects may cause resistance to PARPi.

PTEN loss leads to acceleration of Kras(G12D)-driven pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in mice and these tumours have high levels of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling. To test whether these KRAS PTEN pancreatic tumours show mTOR dependence, we compared response to mTOR inhibition in this model, to the response in another established model of pancreatic cancer, KRAS P53. We also assessed whether there was a subset of pancreatic cancer patients who may respond to mTOR inhibition.;We found that tumours in KRAS PTEN mice exhibit a remarkable dependence on mTOR signalling. In these tumours, mTOR inhibition leads to proliferative arrest and even tumour regression. Further, we could measure response using clinically applicable positron emission tomography imaging. Importantly, pancreatic tumours driven by activated KRAS and mutant p53 did not respond to treatment. In human tumours, approximately 20% of cases demonstrated low PTEN expression and a gene expression signature that overlaps with murine KRAS PTEN tumours.;KRAS PTEN tumours are uniquely responsive to mTOR inhibition.

Loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10) can hyperactivate mTOR through AKT and represents one of the most frequent events in human prostate cancer. We show here that conditional inactivation of mTor in the adult mouse prostate is seemingly inconsequential for this postmitotic tissue. Conversely, inactivation of mTor leads to a marked suppression of Pten loss-induced tumor initiation and progression in the prostate. This suppression is more pronounced than that elicited by the sole pharmacological abrogation of mTORC1. Acute inactivation of mTor in vitro also highlights the differential requirement of mTor function in proliferating and transformed cells. Collectively, our data constitute a strong rationale for developing specific mTOR inhibitors targeting both mTORC1 and mTORC2 for the treatment of tumors triggered by PTEN deficiency and aberrant mTOR signaling.",

EF24 inhibits the NF-κB but not the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in DU145 human prostate cancer cells and B16 murine melanoma cells. EF24 induces apoptosis in these cells apparently by inhibiting miR-21 expression, and also enhances the expression of several miR-21 target genes, PTEN and PDCD4. EF24 treatment significantly suppressed the growth of DU145 prostate cancer xenografts in immunocompromised mice and resulted in tumor regression. EF24 enhanced the expression of the miR-21 target PTEN in DU145 tumor tissue, but suppressed the expression of markers of proliferating cells (cyclin D1 and Ki67). In syngeneic mice injected with B16 cells, EF24 treatment inhibited the formation of lung metastasis, prolonged animal survival, inhibited miR-21 expression and increased the expression of miR-21 target genes. Expression profiling of miRNAs regulated by EF24 in vitro and in vivo showed that the antitumor activity of EF24 reflected the enhanced expression of potential tumor suppressor miRNAs as well as the suppressed expression of oncogenic miRNAs, including miR-21. Taken together, our data suggest that EF24 is a potent anticancer agent and selectively targets NF-κB signaling and miRNA expression, indicating that EF24 has significant potential as a therapeutic agent in various cancers.

Research efforts are dedicated to overcome this problem by understanding the molecular basis of the transition from benign cells to prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), localized carcinoma, and metastatic cancer. Identification of proteins that inhibit dissemination of cancer cells will provide new perspectives to define novel therapeutics. Development of antimetastatic drugs that trigger or mimic the effect of metastasis suppressors represents new therapeutic approaches to improve patient survival. This review focuses on different biochemical and cellular functions of metastasis suppressors known to play a role in prostate carcinogenesis and progression. Ten putative metastasis suppressors implicated in prostate cancer are discussed. CD44s is decreased in both PIN and cancer; Drg-1, E-cadherin, KAI-1, RKIP, and SSeCKS show similar expression between benign epithelia and PIN, but are downregulated in invasive cancer; whereas, maspin, MKK4, Nm23 and PTEN are upregulated in PIN and downregulated in cancer. Moreover, the potential role of microRNA in prostate cancer progression, the understanding of the cellular distribution and localization of metastasis suppressors, their mechanism of action, their effect on prostate invasion and metastasis, and their potential use as therapeutics are addressed.",

We compiled copy gains and losses, with a particular focus on those genes highly implicated in mCRPC progression and previously validated as being aberrant in metastatic tissue samples and genomic studies of reference mCRPC datasets. Genomic gains in >25% of CTCs were observed in AR, FOXA1, ABL1, MET, ERG, CDK12, BRD4, and ZFHX3, while common genomic losses involved PTEN, ZFHX3, PDE4DIP, RAF1, and GATA2. Analysis of aCGH in a sample with sequential enzalutamide resistant visceral progression showed acquired loss of AR amplification concurrent with gain of MYCN, consistent with evolution toward a neuroendocrine-like, AR-independent clone.;Genomic analysis of pooled CTCs in men with mCRPC suggests a reproducible, but highly complex molecular profile that includes common aberrations in AR, ERG, c-MET, and PI3K signaling during mCRPC progression, which may be useful for predictive biomarker development.",

However, the molecular basis of their interaction and clinical impact remains to be fully examined. SPRY2 loss may functionally synergize with aberrant cellular signalling to drive PC and to promote treatment-resistant disease. Here, we report evidence for a positive feedback regulation of the ErbB-PI3K/AKT cascade by SPRY2 loss in in vitro as well as pre-clinical in vivo models and clinical PC. Reduction in SPRY2 expression resulted in hyper-activation of PI3K/AKT signalling to drive proliferation and invasion by enhanced internalization of EGFR/HER2 and their sustained signalling at the early endosome in a PTEN-dependent manner. This involved p38 MAPK activation by PI3K to facilitate clathrin-mediated ErbB receptor endocytosis. Finally, in vitro and in vivo inhibition of PI3K suppressed proliferation and invasion, supporting PI3K/AKT as a target for therapy particularly in patients with PTEN-haploinsufficient-, low SPRY2- and ErbB-expressing tumours. In conclusion, SPRY2 is an important tumour suppressor in PC since its loss drives the PI3K/AKT pathway via functional interaction with the ErbB system.",

Issues covered include those related to stem cells and embryonic signalling, oncogene/tumor suppressor abnormalities, androgen signalling, apoptosis and the nature of tumor-stromal interactions. Emphasis is placed on signalling pathway abnormalities, their causation, consequences and interactions. For example, genomic abnormalities involving the TMPRSS2-ETS and PTEN loci and the resulting signalling effects suggest the importance of genomic instability as a crucial factor in the emergence of this neoplasm. Together with new insights into signalling pathways consequent to abnormalities such as these, a greater understanding of the pathophysiology involved in prostatic carcinogenesis will lead to targeted approaches for both therapy and chemoprevention in the future.",

Eligible patients had clinical stage T1c-T3b N0M0 prostate adenocarcinoma with intermediate-risk and high-risk factors according to 2005 National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated randomisation schedule to receive either 4 months of androgen deprivation combined with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy at a minimum dose of 76 Gy (range 76-82 Gy; short-term androgen deprivation group) or the same treatment followed by 24 months of adjuvant androgen deprivation (long-term androgen deprivation group), stratified by prostate cancer risk group (intermediate risk vs high risk) and participating centre. Patients assigned to the short-term androgen deprivation group received 4 months of neoadjuvant and concomitant androgen deprivation with subcutaneous goserelin (2 months before and 2 months combined with high-dose radiotherapy). Anti-androgen therapy (flutamide 750 mg per day or bicalutamide 50 mg per day) was added during the first 2 months of treatment. Patients assigned to long-term suppression continued with the same luteinising hormone-releasing hormone analogue every 3 months for another 24 months. The primary endpoint was biochemical disease-free survival. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02175212.;Between Nov 7, 2005, and Dec 20, 2010, 178 patients were randomly assigned to receive short-term androgen deprivation and 177 to receive long-term androgen deprivation. After a median follow-up of 63 months (IQR 50-82), 5-year biochemical disease-free survival was significantly better among patients receiving long-term androgen deprivation than among those receiving short-term treatment (90% [95% CI 87-92] vs 81% [78-85]; hazard ratio [HR] 1·88 [95% CI 1·12-3·15]; p=0·01). 5-year overall survival (95% [95% CI 93-97] vs 86% [83-89]; HR 2·48 [95% CI 1·31-4·68]; p=0·009) and 5-year metastasis-free survival (94% [95% CI 92-96] vs 83% [80-86]; HR 2·31 [95% CI 1·23-3·85]; p=0·01) were also significantly better in the long-term androgen deprivation group than in the short-term androgen deprivation group. The effect of long-term androgen deprivation on biochemical disease-free survival, metastasis-free survival, and overall survival was more evident in patients with high-risk disease than in those with low-risk disease. Grade 3 late rectal toxicity was noted in three (2%) of 177 patients in the long-term androgen deprivation group and two (1%) of 178 in the short-term androgen deprivation group; grade 3-4 late urinary toxicity was noted in five (3%) patients in each group. No deaths related to treatment were reported.;Compared with short-term androgen deprivation, 2 years of adjuvant androgen deprivation combined with high-dose radiotherapy improved biochemical control and overall survival in patients with prostate cancer, particularly those with high-risk disease, with no increase in late radiation toxicity.

Thus targeting of apoptotic players is of critical significance in prostate cancer therapy since loss of apoptosis and resistance to anoikis are critical in aberrant malignant growth, metastasis and conferring therapeutic failure. The majority of therapeutic agents act through intrinsic mitochondrial, extrinsic death receptor pathways or endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways to induce apoptosis. Current therapeutic strategies target restoring regulatory molecules that govern the pro-survival pathways such as PTEN which regulates AKT activity. Other strategies focus on reactivating the apoptotic pathways either by down-regulating anti-apoptotic players such as BCL-2 or by up-regulating pro-apoptotic protein families, most notably, the caspases. Caspases are a family of cystine proteases which serve critical roles in apoptotic and inflammatory signaling pathways. During tumorigenesis, significant loss or inactivation of lead members in the caspase family leads to impairing apoptosis induction, causing a dramatic imbalance in the growth dynamics, ultimately resulting in aberrant growth of human cancers. Recent exploitation of apoptosis pathways towards re-instating apoptosis induction via caspase re-activation has provided new molecular platforms for the development of therapeutic strategies effective against advanced prostate cancer as well as other solid tumors. This review will discuss the current cellular landscape featuring the caspase family in tumor cells and their activation via pharmacologic intervention towards optimized anti-cancer therapeutic modalities.

Preliminary findings reported after 5 years of follow-up showed that escalated-dose conformal radiotherapy improved biochemical progression-free survival. Based on the sample size calculation, we planned to analyse overall survival when 190 deaths occurred; this target has now been reached, after a median 10 years of follow-up.;RT01 was a phase 3, open-label, international, randomised controlled trial enrolling men with histologically confirmed T1b-T3a, N0, M0 prostate cancer with prostate specific antigen of less than 50 ng/mL. Patients were randomly assigned centrally in a 1:1 ratio, using a computer-based minimisation algorithm stratifying by risk of seminal vesicle invasion and centre to either the control group (64 Gy in 32 fractions, the standard dose at the time the trial was designed) or the escalated-dose group (74 Gy in 37 fractions). Neither patients nor investigators were masked to assignment. All patients received neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy for 3-6 months before the start of conformal radiotherapy, which continued until the end of conformal radiotherapy. The coprimary outcome measures were biochemical progression-free survival and overall survival. All analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. Treatment-related side-effects have been reported previously. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN47772397.;Between Jan 7, 1998, and Dec 20, 2001, 862 men were registered and 843 subsequently randomly assigned: 422 to the escalated-dose group and 421 to the control group. As of Aug 2, 2011, 236 deaths had occurred: 118 in each group. Median follow-up was 10·0 years (IQR 9·1-10·8). Overall survival at 10 years was 71% (95% CI 66-75) in each group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·99, 95% CI 0·77-1·28; p=0·96). Biochemical progression or progressive disease occurred in 391 patients (221 [57%] in the control group and 170 [43%] in the escalated-dose group). At 10 years, biochemical progression-free survival was 43% (95% CI 38-48) in the control group and 55% (50-61) in the escalated-dose group (HR 0·69, 95% CI 0·56-0·84; p=0·0003).;At a median follow-up of 10 years, escalated-dose conformal radiotherapy with neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy showed an advantage in biochemical progression-free survival, but this advantage did not translate into an improvement in overall survival. These efficacy data for escalated-dose treatment must be weighed against the increase in acute and late toxicities associated with the escalated dose and emphasise the importance of use of appropriate modern radiotherapy methods to reduce side-effects.;UK Medical Research Council.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Prostate cancer development is often associated with deletion or silencing of tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway, leading to resistance to various therapies in both the preclinical and clinical setting. Therefore, the PI3K-Akt pathway plays a central role in various cellular processes promoting survival signaling that can contribute to the malignant phenotype, and, consequently, is an attractive pharmacologic target. However, as single agents, the efficacy of AKT inhibitors may be limited by resistance mechanisms that result in minimal cell death in tumor cells.;We investigated the effects of the Akt inhibitor AZD5363 on cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, and Akt downstream pathway proteins. Survival mechanisms induced by AZD5363 were investigated. We then examined the impacts of inhibition of autophagy in combination with AZD5363 on cell proliferation and apoptosis. Furthermore, the anticancer activity of combination treatment of the lysosomotropic inhibitor of autophagy (chloroquine) with the Akt inhibitor AZD5363 was evaluated in PC-3 prostate cancer xenografts.;Here, we show that the Akt inhibitor AZD5363 affected the Akt downstream pathway by reducing p-mTOR, p-P70S6K, and p-S6K. While AZD5363 monotherapy induced G(2) growth arrest and autophagy, it failed to induce significant apoptosis in PC-3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines. Blocking autophagy using pharmacologic inhibitors (3-methyladenine, chloroquine, and bafilomycin A) or genetic inhibitors (siRNA targeting Atg3 and Atg7) enhanced cell death induced by Akt inhibitor AZD5363 in these tumor prostate cell lines. Importantly, the combination of AZD5363 with chloroquine significantly reduced tumor volume by 84.9% compared with the control group and by 77.5% compared with either drug alone in PC3 xenografts.;Taken together, these data show that the Akt inhibitor AZD5363 synergizes with the lysosomotropic inhibitor of autophagy chloroquine to induce apoptosis and delay tumor progression in prostate cancer models that are resistant to monotherapy AZD5363, providing a new therapeutic approach potentially translatable to patients.",

Here, we examine whether patients experience differences in acute gastrointestinal and genitourinary adverse effects.;In this randomised non-inferiority phase 3 trial, done in seven radiotherapy centres in the Netherlands, we enrolled intermediate-risk or high-risk patients aged between 44 and 85 years with histologically confirmed stage T1b-T4 NX-0MX-0 prostate cancer, a PSA concentration of 60 ng/mL or lower, and WHO performance status of 0-2. A web-based application was used to randomly assign (1:1) patients to receive either standard fractionation with 39 fractions of 2 Gy in 8 weeks (five fractions per week) or hypofractionation with 19 fractions of 3·4 Gy in 6·5 weeks (three fractions per week). Randomisation was done with minimisation procedure, stratified by treatment centre and risk group. The primary endpoint is 5-year relapse-free survival. Here we report data for the acute toxicity outcomes: the cumulative incidence of grade 2 or worse acute and late genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity. Non-inferiority of hypofractionation was tested separately for genitourinary and gastrointestinal acute toxic effects, with a null hypothesis that cumulative incidences of each type of adverse event were not more than 8% higher in the hypofractionation group than in the standard fractionation group. We scored acute genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxic effects according to RTOG-EORTC criteria from both case report forms and patients' self-assessment questionnaires, at baseline, twice during radiotherapy, and 3 months after completion of radiotherapy. Analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. Patient recruitment has been completed. This study is registered with www.controlled-trials.com, number ISRCTN85138529.;Between March 19, 2007, and Dec 3, 2010, 820 patients were randomly assigned to treatment with standard fractionation (n=410) or hypofractionation (n=410). 3 months after radiotherapy, 73 (22%) patients in the standard fractionation group and 75 (23%) patients in the hypofractionation group reported grade 2 or worse genitourinary toxicity; grade 2 or worse gastrointestinal toxicity was noted in 43 (13%) patients in the standard fractionation group and in 42 (13%) in the hypofractionation group. Grade 4 acute genitourinary toxicity was reported for two patients, one (<1%) in each group. No grade 4 acute gastrointestinal toxicities were observed. We noted no significant difference in cumulative incidence by 120 days after radiotherapy of grade 2 or worse acute genitourinary toxicity (57·8% [95% CI 52·9-62·7] in the standard fractionation group vs 60·5% (55·8-65·3) in the hypofractionation group; difference 2·7%, 90% CI -2·99 to 8·48; odds ratio [OR] 1·12, 95% CI 0·84-1·49; p=0·43). The cumulative incidence of grade 2 or worse acute gastrointestinal toxicity by 120 days after radiotherapy was higher in patients given hypofractionation (31·2% [95% CI 26·6-35·8] in the standard fractionation group vs 42·0% [37·2-46·9] in the hypofractionation group; difference 10·8%, 90% CI 5·25-16·43; OR 1·6; p=0·0015; non-inferiority not confirmed).;Hypofractionated radiotherapy was not non-inferior to standard fractionated radiotherapy in terms of acute genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity for men with intermediate-risk and high-risk prostate cancer. In fact, the cumulative incidence of grade 2 or worse acute gastrointestinal toxicity was significantly higher in patients given hypofractionation than in those given standard fractionated radiotherapy.

        "Doc_abstract":"Previous work has shown that prostate cancer in a Pten-null murine model is dependent on the p110β isoform of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), while breast cancer driven by either polyoma middle T antigen (MT) or HER2 is p110α dependent. Whether these differences in isoform dependence arise from tissue specificity or from the nature of the oncogenic signal activating the PI3K pathway is important, given increasing interest in using isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors in cancer therapy. To approach this question, we studied the PI3K isoform dependence of our recently constructed prostate cancer model driven by MT. Since MT activates a number of signaling pathways, we first confirmed that the MT-driven prostate cancer model was actually dependent on PI3K. A newly generated transgenic prostate line expressing an MT allele (Y315F) known to be defective for PI3K binding displayed a markedly reduced ability to drive tumor formation. We next selectively ablated expression of either p110α or p110β in mice in which wild-type MT was expressed in the prostate. We found that tumor formation driven by MT was significantly delayed by the loss of p110α expression, while ablation of p110β had no effect. Since the tumor formation driven by MT is p110α dependent in the prostate as well as in the mammary gland, our data suggest that PI3K isoform dependence is driven by the mode of PI3K pathway activation rather than by tissue type.;Middle T antigen (MT), the oncogene of polyomavirus, can drive tumor formation in a variety of cell types and tissues. Interestingly, MT has no intrinsic enzymatic activity but instead functions by binding and activating cellular signaling proteins. One of the most important of these is the lipid kinase PI3K, which was first studied in MT immunoprecipitates. Ubiquitously expressed PI3K comes in two major isoforms: p110α and p110β. Previous work in animal models showed that p110α was the key isoform in breast tumors driven by oncogenes, including MT and HER2, while p110β was key in prostate tumors driven by Pten loss. We asked the simple question of whether a prostate tumor driven by MT depends on p110α, which would suggest that the mode of activation determines p110 isoform dependence, or p110β, which would suggest that tissue type determines isoform dependence. The clear answer is that MT depends on p110α in both the prostate and breast.",

We subsequently used immunohistochemistry to examine KLLN expression and association with Gleason grade and score in 109 prostatectomy samples. KLLN's tumor-suppressive effect was studied in androgen-dependent and androgen-independent cell models.;Patients were diagnosed with peripheral zone prostate carcinomas without metastasis at the time of prostatectomy. Each patient's primary tumor comprised at least 2 tumoral regions with different Gleason grades.;KLLN expression decreased from normal prostate tissue to primary carcinomas (P < .0001). The loss of epithelial and stromal KLLN expression is associated with poor differentiation and high Gleason scores (P < .0001), consistent with our in vitro observation that KLLN inhibits tumor cell proliferation and invasiveness. KLLN decreases prostate-specific antigen levels and suppresses androgen-mediated cell growth by inhibiting androgen receptor (AR) transcription. As an androgen receptor-regulated target, KLLN also functions as a transcriptional activator, directly promoting the expression of TP53 and TP73, with consequent elevated apoptosis, regardless of AR status.;Our observations suggest that KLLN is a transcription factor directly regulating AR, TP53, and TP73 expression, with a role in prostate carcinogenesis. Loss of KLLN associates with high Gleason scores, suggesting that KLLN might be used as a potential prognostic marker for risk management and as a novel therapy target for advanced prostate carcinomas.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) are ubiquitous receptors involved in the control of a variety of cellular processes frequently found altered in cancer cells. The EGFR has been recently described to play a transduction role of uPAR stimuli, mediating uPA-induced proliferation in highly malignant cells that overexpress uPAR. We compared the uPA production, the presence of uPAR, AR, EGFR and Her2 with the chemotaxis and the Matrigel invasion in ten human PCa cell lines and observed that: (1) the levels of Her2, but not of EGFR, as well as the uPA secretion, cell motility and Matrigel invasion were statistically higher in AR negative than in AR positive PCa cells; (2) the uPA secretion and uPA Rexpression were positively related to Matrigel invasion; (3) the EGF was able to stimulate chemotaxis and Matrigel invasion in a dose-dependent manner; (4) the EGF-induced cell migration was statistically higher inAR negative than in AR positive cells with a similar increase with respect to basal value (about 2.6 fold); (5) the Matrigel invasion was statistically higher in AR negative than in AR positive PCa cells also if the increment of Matrigel invasion after EGF treatment was statistically higher in AR positive respect to AR negative cells; (6) the EGF induced uPA secretion and its membrane uptake through the increment of uPAR; and (7) these effects were blocked by EGFR/Her2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors with IC(50) lower than those needed to inhibit cell proliferation and required PI3K/Akt, MAPK and PI-PLC activities as verified by inhibition experiments. These enzymatic activities were regulated in different manners in PTEN positive and negative cells. In fact, the inhibition of PI3K blocked the EGF-induced invasiveness in PTEN positive cells but not in PTEN negative cells, in which PI3K activity was not influenced by EGFR/Her2 activation, whereas the inhibition of MAPK was able to block the invasive phenomena in both cell types. Taken together, our data suggest that the blockade of EGFR could attenuate the invasive potential of PCa cells. In addition, considering that the EGFR expression is related to higher Gleason grade of PCa and that EGFR levels are increased after anti androgenic therapy, this therapeutic approach could slow down the metastasis formation which represents the most dramatic event of PCa progression.",

Here we describe a mouse model with spontaneous anal squamous cell cancer, wherein a combined deletion of Tgfbr1 and Pten in stratified squamous epithelia was induced using inducible K14-Cre. Histopathologic analyses confirmed that 33.3% of the mice showed increased susceptibility to ASCC and precancerous lesions. Biomarker analyses demonstrated that the activation of the Akt pathway in ASCC of the Tgfbr1 and Pten double knockout (2cKO) mouse was similar to that observed in human anal cancer. Chemopreventive experiments using mTOR inhibitor-rapamycin treatment significantly delayed the onset of the ASCC tumors and reduced the tumor burden in 2cKO mice by decreasing the phosphorylation of Akt and S6. This is the first conditional knockout mouse model used for investigating the contributions of viral and cellular factors in anal carcinogenesis without carcinogen-mediated induction, and it would provide a platform for assessing new therapeutic modalities for treating and/or preventing this type of cancer.

Pharmacological inhibition of Akt is a promising strategy for treating tumors resistant to growth factor receptor antagonists due to mutations in PI3K or PTEN. We have developed allosteric, isozyme-specific inhibitors of Akt activity and activation, as well as ex vivo kinase assays to measure inhibition of individual Akt isozymes in tissues. Here we describe the relationship between PK, Akt inhibition, hyperglycemia and tumor efficacy for a selective inhibitor of Akt1 and Akt2 (AKTi). In nude mice, AKTi treatment caused transient insulin resistance and reversible, dose-dependent hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Akt1 and Akt2 phosphorylation was inhibited in mouse lung with EC50 values of 1.6 and 7 μM, respectively, and with similar potency in other tissues and xenograft tumors. Weekly subcutaneous dosing of AKTi resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of LNCaP prostate cancer xenografts, an AR-dependent tumor with PTEN deletion and constitutively activated Akt. Complete tumor growth inhibition was achieved at 200 mpk, a dose that maintained inhibition of Akt1 and Akt2 of greater than 80% and 50%, respectively, for at least 12 hours in xenograft tumor and mouse lung. Hyperglycemia could be controlled by reducing C(max), while maintaining efficacy in the LNCaP model, but not by insulin administration. AKTi treatment was well tolerated, without weight loss or gross toxicities. These studies supported the rationale for clinical development of allosteric Akt inhibitors and provide the basis for further refining of pharmacokinetic properties and dosing regimens of this class of inhibitors.",

In prostate cancer, ETS family members, such as ERG, ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5, are frequently overexpressed due to chromosomal translocations, but the molecular mechanisms by which they promote prostate tumorigenesis remain largely undefined. Here, we show that ETS family members, such as ERG and ETV1, directly repress the expression of the checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), a key DNA damage response cell-cycle regulator essential for the maintenance of genome integrity. Critically, we find that ERG expression correlates with CHK1 downregulation in human patients and demonstrate that Chk1 heterozygosity promotes the progression of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia into prostatic invasive carcinoma in Pten(+) (/-) mice. Importantly, CHK1 downregulation sensitizes prostate tumor cells to etoposide but not to docetaxel treatment. Thus, we identify CHK1 as a key functional target of the ETS proto-oncogenic family with important therapeutic implications.;Genetic translocation and aberrant expression of ETS family members is a common event in different types of human tumors. Here, we show that through the transcriptional repression of CHK1, ETS factors may favor DNA damage accumulation and consequent genetic instability in proliferating cells.

Histopathological lesions were assessed in 7-, 30-, 90-, 200-, and 400-day human prostate xenografts. Gene expression for cell cycle, tumor suppressors, and apoptosis-related genes (ie, CDKN1A, CASP9, ESR2, PTEN, and TP53) was performed for 200-day estrogen-treated xenografts. Glandular hyperplasia was observed in xenografts given both an initial and secondary exposure to estradiol in both 200- and 400-day xenografts. Persistent estrogenic effects were verified using immunohistochemical markers for cytokeratin 10, p63, and estrogen receptor α.

Several dozen HIF-1 targets are known, including the gene encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1alpha expression increases as a result of decreased ubiquitination and degradation. The tumor suppressors VHL (von Hippel-Lindau protein) and p53 target HIF-1alpha for ubiquitination such that their inactivation in tumor cells increases the half-life of HIF-1alpha. Increased phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and AKT or decreased PTEN activity in prostate cancer cells also increases HIF-1alpha expression by an undefined mechanism. In breast cancer, increased activity of the HER2 (also known as neu) receptor tyrosine kinase is associated with increased tumor grade, chemotherapy resistance, and decreased patient survival. HER2 has also been implicated as an inducer of VEGF expression. Here we demonstrate that HER2 signaling induced by overexpression in mouse 3T3 cells or heregulin stimulation of human MCF-7 breast cancer cells results in increased HIF-1alpha protein and VEGF mRNA expression that is dependent upon activity of PI3K, AKT (also known as protein kinase B), and the downstream kinase FRAP (FKBP-rapamycin-associated protein). In contrast to other inducers of HIF-1 expression, heregulin stimulation does not affect the half-life of HIF-1alpha but instead stimulates HIF-1alpha synthesis in a rapamycin-dependent manner. The 5'-untranslated region of HIF-1alpha mRNA directs heregulin-inducible expression of a heterologous protein. These data provide a molecular basis for VEGF induction and tumor angiogenesis by heregulin-HER2 signaling and establish a novel mechanism for the regulation of HIF-1alpha expression.",

When the volume of the tumors grown subcutaneously in athymic nude mice reached 50-60 mm(3), three intratumoral injections of the following four formulations were performed during week 1 and then during week 3: (1) saline, (2) DC + Tf + pCMVlacZ, (3) DC + Tf + pCMVPTEN, and (4) DC + Tf + pCMVp53 (standard formulation). There was no significant difference in tumor volume and survival between group 1 and group 2 animals. As compared with group 1 controls, group 3 animals had slower tumor growth during the first 3 weeks but thereafter their tumor growth rate was similar to that of the controls. By day 2 posttreatment, group 4 animals had significantly lower tumor volume relative to initial tumor volume as well as controls at the comparable time point. Also, animals treated with p53 survived longer. Treatment with DC, Tf, pCMVp53, DC + pCMVp53, or Tf + pCMVp53 had no effect on tumor volume or survival. Expression of p53 protein and apoptosis were detected in tumors treated with the standard formulation, thus associating p53 protein expression and apoptosis with efficacy. However, p53 protein was expressed in only a fraction of the tumor cells, suggesting a role for bystander effects in the efficacy of p53 gene therapy.

The precise interplay between tumor and stroma remains poorly understood. TLRs mediate interactions between environmental stimuli and innate immunity and trigger proinflammatory signaling cascades. Our finding that TLR7 expression is upregulated in both epithelial and stromal compartments in human and murine pancreatic cancer led us to postulate that carcinogenesis is dependent on TLR7 signaling. In a mouse model of pancreatic cancer, TLR7 ligation vigorously accelerated tumor progression and induced loss of expression of PTEN, p16, and cyclin D1 and upregulation of p21, p27, p53, c-Myc, SHPTP1, TGF-β, PPARγ, and cyclin B1. Furthermore, TLR7 ligation induced STAT3 activation and interfaced with Notch as well as canonical NF-κB and MAP kinase pathways, but downregulated expression of Notch target genes. Moreover, blockade of TLR7 protected against carcinogenesis. Since pancreatic tumorigenesis requires stromal expansion, we proposed that TLR7 ligation modulates pancreatic cancer by driving stromal inflammation. Accordingly, we found that mice lacking TLR7 exclusively within their inflammatory cells were protected from neoplasia.

        "Doc_abstract":"FK506 binding proteins (FKBPs) are the intracellular ligands of FK506 and rapamycin, two natural compounds with powerful and clinically efficient immunosuppressive activity. In recent decades, a relevant role for immunosuppressants as anticancer agents has emerged. Especially, rapamycin and its derivatives are used, with successful results, across a variety of tumors. Of note, rapamycin and FK506 bind to FKBP12, and the resulting complexes interfere with distinct intracellular signaling pathways driven, respectively, by the mammalian target of rapamycin and calcineurin phosphatase. These pathways are related to T-cell activation and growth. Hyperactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), particularly in cancers that have lost the tumor suppressor gene PTEN, plays an important pathogenetic role in tumor transformation and growth. The signaling pathway involving calcineurin and nuclear factors of activated T-lymphocytes is also involved in the pathogenesis of different cancer types and in tumor metastasis, providing a rationale for use of FK506 in anticancer therapy. Recent studies have focused on FKBPs in apoptosis regulation: Targeting of FKBP12 promotes apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, FKBP38 knockdown sensitizes hepatoma cells to apoptosis, and FKBP51 silencing overcomes resistance to apoptosis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, prostate cancer, melanoma, and glioma. Interestingly, derivatives of FK506 that have the same FKBP12-binding properties as FK506 but lack functional immunosuppressant activity, exert the same apoptotic effect as FK506 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.These findings suggest that a direct FKBP inhibition represents a further mechanism of immunosuppressants.' anticancer activity. In this review, we focus on the role of FKBP members in apoptosis control and summarize the data on the antitumor effect of selective targeting of FKBP.",

        "Doc_abstract":"According to the Canadian Society of Internal Medicine, the Canadian general internist is in the ideal position to promote patient health through disease prevention. To explore the general internist's contribution to disease prevention, the authors quantified the extent to which opportunities for prevention were addressed by the general internal medicine (GIM) service in an acute care teaching hospital in Calgary.;The authors interviewed 100 adult patients before discharge from the hospital's GIM service between May 14, 1997, and Dec. 2, 1997. The number of potential opportunities for preventive intervention were identified for each patient from 10 possible interventions recommended by the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination (now the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care): breast cancer screening, Papanicolaou smear for cervical cancer, counselling on menopausal hormone replacement therapy, digital rectal examination for prostate cancer, smoking cessation counselling, cholesterol measurement, therapy or monitoring for hypertension, influenza vaccination, pneumococcal vaccination and colorectal cancer screening. The authors determined which interventions the patient had undergone before the current admission to hospital and, using patient recall and postdischarge medical chart review, which opportunities for intervention were addressed by the GIM service during the current admission. An opportunity for preventive intervention was considered as addressed by the GIM service if it was performed during the current admission or if the general internist informed the patient or the patient's family physician of the need for such intervention in the near future.;Among the 10 preventive interventions considered, a mean of 3.8 potential opportunities for prevention were identified for each patient. Of these, 46.5% had been addressed before the current admission, and 8.7% were addressed by the GIM service during the admission. Therefore, at the time of discharge, a mean of 55.2% of opportunities had been addressed. Among the opportunities not previously addressed, the GIM service most frequently addressed digital rectal examination for prostate cancer and cholesterol measurement.;General internists are discharging patients without sufficiently addressing opportunities for disease prevention. Preventive care protocols may be needed to limit the frequency of missed opportunities for prevention in patients admitted to tertiary care GIM services.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Our objective was to explore alteration of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway in ampullary carcinoma. Immunohistochemical studies were employed to evaluate expression of amphiregulin as well as expression and activation of EGFR. A lab-developed assay was used to identify mutations in the EGFR pathway genes, including KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, PTEN, and AKT1. A total of 52 ampullary carcinomas were identified, including 25 intestinal-type and 24 pancreatobiliary-type tumors, with the intestinal type being associated with a younger age at diagnosis (P=0.03) and a better prognosis (P<0.01). Expression of amphiregulin correlated with better differentiation (P<0.01), but no difference was observed between two major histologic types. Expression and activation of EGFR was more commonly seen in the pancreatobiliary type (P<0.01). Mutations were detected in 50% of the pancreatobiliary type and 60% of the intestinal type. KRAS was the most common gene mutated in the pancreatobiliary type (42%) as well as the intestinal type (52%). Other mutations detected included PIK3CA, SMAD4 and BRAF. KRAS mutations at codons 12 and 13 did not adversely affect overall survival. In conclusion, EGFR expression and activation were different between intestinal- and pancreatobiliary-type ampullary carcinoma. KRAS mutation was common in both histologic types; however, the incidence appeared to be lower in the pancreatobiliary type compared with its pancreatic counterpart, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Mutational analysis of the EGFR pathway genes may provide important insights into personalized treatment for patients with ampullary carcinoma. ",

Nuclear EGFR levels were inversely correlated with survival and response to radiotherapy. Here, we sought to identify the determinants and correlates of nuclear EGFR content.;We analyzed an oropharyngeal cancer tissue microarray for the expression of the key molecules of the EGFR signaling cascade using an automated image analysis technique (AQUA) scored on a scale of 0 to 255, which permits protein quantitation and subcellular localization. Patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer treated with radiotherapy or surgery and radiotherapy were eligible. Data were analyzed using Spearman correlations and multiple linear regression with robust SEs.;Of the 95 tumors included in this study, 72 (75%) had sufficient tissue for analysis of nuclear EGFR. Nuclear EGFR levels were associated with membranous/cytoplasmic EGFR levels (rho = 0.82, P < 0.001), nuclear extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2 (rho = 0.30, P = 0.01), and nuclear proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; rho = 0.36, P = 0.003). Nuclear phosphorylated-Akt, cyclin D1, phosphatase and tensin homolog (mutated in multiple cancers 1) (PTEN), p53, and proliferation marker Ki-67 levels did not correlate with nuclear EGFR level. In multivariable analysis, only PCNA retained its significant association (P = 0.01).;These results are consistent with preclinical data showing that EGFR may function as a tyrosine kinase in the nucleus, phosphorylating and stabilizing PCNA. The nuclear activity of EGFR may constitute a novel therapeutic target.",

Fifteen out of 231 patients (6.5%) were found to have bladder cancer with the mean age at onset of 57.1 +/- 8.7 years. The estimated average period of engaging in this dyestuff exposure for these 15 patients was 92.4 +/- 47.3 months. The mean latent periods from the initial and last exposure until tumor development were 28.8 +/- 5.7 years and 16.6 +/- 7.0 years, respectively. Good negative correlation was observed between exposure periods and latent periods from the last exposure to onset (R = -0.06814). All 15 patients demonstrated tumors in the bladder, and one patient had a metachronous upper urinary tract cancer after treatment for bladder cancer. All tumors were histologically transitional cell carcinomas except for one adenocarcinoma. For initial treatment, five underwent total cystectomy, eight had transurethral resection (TUR) of the tumor, and one had partial cystectomy. Five out of 8 patients who had TUR have developed recurrent bladder tumors, and two of those patients underwent total cystectomy for second treatments. The mean follow-up period was 8.6 +/- 5.2 years, with two dying of cancer. For detection and monitoring, flow cytometric (FCM) analyses were available in five cases with bladder tumor and in two follow-up cases after bladder preserving treatments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

We aimed to initiate worldwide surveillance of cancer survival by central analysis of population-based registry data, as a metric of the effectiveness of health systems, and to inform global policy on cancer control.;Individual tumour records were submitted by 279 population-based cancer registries in 67 countries for 25·7 million adults (age 15-99 years) and 75,000 children (age 0-14 years) diagnosed with cancer during 1995-2009 and followed up to Dec 31, 2009, or later. We looked at cancers of the stomach, colon, rectum, liver, lung, breast (women), cervix, ovary, and prostate in adults, and adult and childhood leukaemia. Standardised quality control procedures were applied; errors were corrected by the registry concerned. We estimated 5-year net survival, adjusted for background mortality in every country or region by age (single year), sex, and calendar year, and by race or ethnic origin in some countries. Estimates were age-standardised with the International Cancer Survival Standard weights.;5-year survival from colon, rectal, and breast cancers has increased steadily in most developed countries. For patients diagnosed during 2005-09, survival for colon and rectal cancer reached 60% or more in 22 countries around the world; for breast cancer, 5-year survival rose to 85% or higher in 17 countries worldwide. Liver and lung cancer remain lethal in all nations: for both cancers, 5-year survival is below 20% everywhere in Europe, in the range 15-19% in North America, and as low as 7-9% in Mongolia and Thailand. Striking rises in 5-year survival from prostate cancer have occurred in many countries: survival rose by 10-20% between 1995-99 and 2005-09 in 22 countries in South America, Asia, and Europe, but survival still varies widely around the world, from less than 60% in Bulgaria and Thailand to 95% or more in Brazil, Puerto Rico, and the USA. For cervical cancer, national estimates of 5-year survival range from less than 50% to more than 70%; regional variations are much wider, and improvements between 1995-99 and 2005-09 have generally been slight. For women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005-09, 5-year survival was 40% or higher only in Ecuador, the USA, and 17 countries in Asia and Europe. 5-year survival for stomach cancer in 2005-09 was high (54-58%) in Japan and South Korea, compared with less than 40% in other countries. By contrast, 5-year survival from adult leukaemia in Japan and South Korea (18-23%) is lower than in most other countries. 5-year survival from childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is less than 60% in several countries, but as high as 90% in Canada and four European countries, which suggests major deficiencies in the management of a largely curable disease.;International comparison of survival trends reveals very wide differences that are likely to be attributable to differences in access to early diagnosis and optimum treatment.
