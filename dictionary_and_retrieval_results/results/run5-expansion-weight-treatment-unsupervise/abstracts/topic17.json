        "Doc_abstract":"The inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway, which often occurs through mutations in TP53 (encoding tumor protein 53) is a common step in human cancer. However, in melanoma-a highly chemotherapy-resistant disease-TP53 mutations are rare, raising the possibility that this cancer uses alternative ways to overcome p53-mediated tumor suppression. Here we show that Mdm4 p53 binding protein homolog (MDM4), a negative regulator of p53, is upregulated in a substantial proportion (âˆ¼65%) of stage I-IV human melanomas and that melanocyte-specific Mdm4 overexpression enhanced tumorigenesis in a mouse model of melanoma induced by the oncogene Nras. MDM4 promotes the survival of human metastatic melanoma by antagonizing p53 proapoptotic function. Notably, inhibition of the MDM4-p53 interaction restored p53 function in melanoma cells, resulting in increased sensitivity to cytotoxic chemotherapy and to inhibitors of the BRAF (V600E) oncogene. Our results identify MDM4 as a key determinant of impaired p53 function in human melanoma and designate MDM4 as a promising target for antimelanoma combination therapy. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Intrinsic and acquired resistance of metastatic melanoma to (V600E/K)BRAF and/or MEK inhibitors, which is often caused by activation of the PI3K/AKT survival pathway, represents a major clinical challenge. Given that p53 is capable of antagonising PI3K/AKT activation we hypothesised that pharmacological restoration of p53 activity may increase the sensitivity of BRAF-mutant melanoma to MAPK-targeted therapy and eventually delay and/or prevent acquisition of drug resistance. To test this possibility we exposed a panel of vemurafenib-sensitive and resistant (innate and acquired) (V600E/K)BRAF melanomas to a (V600E/K)BRAF inhibitor (vemurafenib) alone or in combination with a direct p53 activator (PRIMA-1(Met)/APR-246). Strikingly, PRIMA-1(Met) synergised with vemurafenib to induce apoptosis and suppress proliferation of (V600E/K)BRAF melanoma cells in vitro and to inhibit tumour growth in vivo. Importantly, this drug combination decreased the viability of both vemurafenib-sensitive and resistant melanoma cells irrespectively of the TP53 status. Notably, p53 reactivation was invariably accompanied by PI3K/AKT pathway inhibition, the activity of which was found as a dominant resistance mechanism to BRAF inhibition in our lines. From all various combinatorial modalities tested, targeting the MAPK and PI3K signalling pathways through p53 reactivation or not, the PRIMA-1(Met)/vemurafenib combination was the most cytotoxic. We conclude that PRIMA-1(Met) through its ability to directly reactivate p53 regardless of the mechanism causing its deactivation, and thereby dampen PI3K signalling, sensitises (V600E/K)BRAF-positive melanoma to BRAF inhibitors.",

Differentiation may be an alternative to apoptosis for inducing melanoma cell cycle exit. Epigenetic mechanisms regulate differentiation, and DNA methylation alterations are associated with the abnormal differentiation of melanoma cells. The effects of the deoxycytidine analogue decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine), which depletes DNA methyl transferase 1 (DNMT1), on melanoma differentiation were examined. Treatment of human and murine melanoma cells in vitro with concentrations of decitabine that did not cause apoptosis inhibited proliferation accompanied by cellular differentiation. A decrease in promoter methylation, and increase in expression of the melanocyte late-differentiation driver SOX9, was followed by increases in cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKN) p27/CDKN1B and p21/CDKN1A that mediate cell cycle exit with differentiation. Effects were independent of the TP53, p16/CDKN2A and also the BRAF status of the melanoma cells. Resistance, when observed, was pharmacologic, characterized by diminished ability of decitabine to deplete DNMT1. Treatment of murine melanoma models in vivo with intermittent, low-dose decitabine, administered sub-cutaneously to limit high peak drug levels that cause cytotoxicity and increase exposure time for DNMT1 depletion, and with tetrahydrouridine to decrease decitabine metabolism and further increase exposure time, inhibited tumor growth and increased molecular and tumor stromal factors implicated in melanocyte differentiation.

        "Doc_abstract":"Malignant melanoma is a cancer characterized by high chemoresistance although p53 is rarely mutated. Here, we show that p53 wild-type melanoma cells acquire resistance to cell death induced by fotemustine (FM), which is a representative of alkylating DNA interstrand cross-linking agents used in melanoma therapy. We show that drug-induced resistance is a result of p53-dependent upregulation of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) genes xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C (XPC) and damaged DNA-binding protein 2 (DDB2), which stimulate the repair of DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) arising from O(6)-chloroethylguanine. Consequently, TP53 mutated cells are unable to repair ICLs, leading to prolonged ATM, ATR and checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) activation, and finally apoptosis. The roles of p53 and NER in ICL-triggered cell death were confirmed by knockdown of p53 and XPC. Upregulation of XPC and DDB2 in p53wt cells following a single drug treatment is a robust and sustained response that lasts for up to 1 week. Pretreatment with an inducing dose followed by a high and toxic dose of FM provoked an adaptive response as the killing outcome of the challenge dose was reduced. Upregulation of XPC and DDB2 was also observed in a melanoma mouse xenograft model following systemic administration of FM. Additionally, XPC and DDB2 induction occurred upon treatment with other cross-linking anticancer drugs, such as cisplatin and mafosfamide, indicating it is a general response of cancer cells to this group of chemotherapeutics. Collectively, the data indicate that p53-dependent upregulation of XPC and DDB2 is a key mechanism upon genotoxic stress, whereby melanoma cells acquire resistance towards DNA cross-linking agents. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of upregulation of NER following a single dose of a DNA interstrand cross-linker, which is a robust and long-lasting effect that impacts the killing response of cancer cells to subsequent treatments.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the molecular effects of jararhagin on SK-Mel-28 cells and fibroblasts, concerning the expression of integrins, cadherins, caspases, and TP53 genes. Sub-toxic doses of jararhagin were administered to confluent cells. RT-PCR was performed following extraction of total RNA.

To get new insights into the biology of melanoma in XP patients, we studied 20 melanomas from four XP-C and two XPV patients in terms of pathology, immunohistochemistry of p53, mutations in exons 4-9 of the p53 gene, and polymorphisms of the p53 gene at codon 72. All statistical tests were two-sided. The majority of the XP melanomas were of the lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM) type, as found in the elderly. p53 point mutations were found in 60% of XP-C melanomas and in only 10% of XPV melanomas, this latter frequency being similar to what has been reported in the general population. Mutations show the specific UV-signature because the majority were CC to tandem and C to T transitions located at the bipyrimidine sites known to be hotspots of UV-induced DNA lesions. All DNA lesions giving rise to mutations in XP-C melanomas were located on the nontranscribed strand of the p53 gene, demonstrating that these patients' cells were able to carry out preferential repair in vivo.

It is believed that the ability to evade apoptosis is the key mechanism for the rapid growth of cancer cells. However, the exact mechanism for failure in the apoptotic pathway in melanoma cells is unclear. p53, the most frequently mutated tumour suppressor gene in human cancers, is a key apoptosis inducer. However, p53 mutation is only found in 15-20% of melanoma biopsies. Recently, it was found that Apaf-1, a downstream target of p53, is inactivated in metastatic melanoma. Specifically, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the Apaf-1 gene was found in 40% of metastatic melanoma. To determine if loss of Apaf-1 expression is indeed involved in melanoma progression, we employed the tissue microarray technology and examined Apaf-1 expression in 70 human primary malignant melanoma biopsies by immunohistochemistry. Our data showed that Apaf-1 expression is significantly reduced in melanoma cells compared with normal nevi (chi(2)=6.02, P=0.014). Our results also revealed that loss of Apaf-1 was not associated with the tumour thickness, ulceration or subtype, patient's gender, age and 5-year survival. In addition, our in vitro apoptosis assay revealed that overexpression of Apaf-1 can sensitise melanoma cells to anticancer drug treatment. Taken together, our data indicate that Apaf-1 expression is significantly reduced in human melanoma and that Apaf-1 may serve as a therapeutic target in melanoma.",

Undifferentiated metastasis was diagnosed synchronous to primary tumor (n=1), following skin melanoma by 3 months to 9 years (n=11) and preceding it by 1 year (n=1). Sites of undifferentiated metastases were axillary (3), inguinal (1), or submandibular (1) lymph nodes, digestive tract (2), bone/soft tissue (2), lung/pleura (2), and disseminated (n=3). Histology of metastases mimicked undifferentiated pleomorphic or spindle cell sarcoma with variable myxoid and giant cell areas (n=10) and cytokeratin-positive undifferentiated small cell sarcoma (n=1). Three cases showed heterologous dedifferentiation: pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma (n=1), teratocarcinosarcoma-like with prominent rhabdomyoblasts (n=1), and adenocarcinoma-like with metaplastic bone (n=1). All cases were negative for S100, melanoma cocktail, HMB45, Melan A, and SOX10. Other markers showed following results: smooth muscle actin (1/14), p16 (1/14), TP53 (2/12), pancytokeratin (4/14), desmin (5/14), h-caldesmon (0/9), and MDM2/CDK4 (0/5). SMARCB1 was intact in 8/8 cases. Genotyping showed BRAF(V600E) mutation (5/14), NRAS mutation (5/14), and BRAF/NRAS wild-type (4/14). In conclusion, undifferentiated/dedifferentiated metastatic melanoma is likely underrecognized and frequently mistaken for undifferentiated sarcoma or other neoplasms. Diagnosis of undifferentiated sarcoma at sites where melanoma metastasis are frequent (eg, inguinal and axillary region) should be made with great caution and warrants exploration of the remote history. Genotyping is a helpful surrogate marker in classifying such difficult cases. In the light of available targeted therapies, recognition of undifferentiated/dedifferentiated metastatic melanoma is mandatory for appropriate treatment.",

Tumor suppressor p53-mediated apoptosis is essential for the response to radio- and chemotherapy. Although p53 is not frequently mutated in melanoma, it is inactivated by integrin Î±v-mediated signaling, as we previously demonstrated 1, which may account, at least partially, for increased apoptosis resistance of malignant melanoma. In this study we addressed the question whether functional restoration of p53 by APR-246 (PRIMA-1Met), which can reactivate mutant p53 and induce massive apoptosis in cancer cells, is able to restore the function of inactive p53 in melanoma. Using a three-dimensional collagen gel (3D-collagen) to culture melanoma cells carrying wild-type p53, we found that APR-246 treatment resulted in activation of p53, leading to increased expression of p53 pro-apoptotic targets Apaf1 and PUMA and activation of caspase- 9 and -3. Moreover, APR-246 triggered melanoma cell apoptosis that was mediated by p53 and caspase 9. Importantly, APR-246 treatment also suppressed human melanoma xenograft tumors in vivo in a p53-dependent manner. Thus, wild-type p53 reactivation may provide a novel approach for malignant melanoma treatment, with APR-246 as a candidate drug for such a development.",

However, the mechanisms involved remain to be fully elucidated. In this report, we show that one of the MAGE proteins, MAGE-D2, suppresses the expression of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) death receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2) and plays an important role in protecting melanoma cells from apoptosis induced by TRAIL. MAGE-D2 was commonly expressed at increased levels in melanoma cells compared with melanocytes. Although its inhibition by small interfering RNA (siRNA) did not cause cell death, it rendered melanoma cells more sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. This was associated with enhanced formation of TRAIL death-inducing signaling complex and up-regulation of TRAIL-R2, and was blocked by a recombinant TRAIL-R2/Fc chimeric protein or siRNA knockdown of TRAIL-R2. Regulation of TRAIL-R2 by MAGE-D2 appeared to be mediated by p53, in that knockdown MAGE-D2 did not up-regulate TRAIL-R2 in p53-null or mutant p53 melanoma cells. In addition, inhibition of MAGE-D2 did not result in up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 in wild-type p53 cell lines with p53 inhibited by short hairpin RNA. Indeed, knockdown of MAGE-D2 led to up-regulation of p53 due to a transcriptional increase. The regulatory effect of MAGE-D2 on TRAIL-R2 expression and TRAIL-induced apoptosis was recapitulated in studies on fresh melanoma isolates. Taken together, these results identify the expression of MAGE-D2 as an important mechanism that inhibit TRAIL-induced apoptosis and suggest that targeting MAGE-D2 may be a useful strategy in improving the therapeutic efficacy of TRAIL in melanoma.",

A possible approach to more effective therapy is induction of p53-dependent apoptosis. This approach is promising, since the wild-type p53 is expressed in most melanomas. An attempt was made to estimate the functional activity of p53 in several malignant melanoma cell lines. Most lines were characterized by a high protein level and nuclear localization of p53. All cell lines expressing the wild-type p53 showed stabilization of p53, its translocation into the nucleus, and activation of several target genes in response to DNA-damaging agents, suggesting that p53 was functionally active. A high-molecular-weight protein localized in the cytoplasm and mimicking a p53 epitope was found in several cell lines. It was shown that the DO-1 epitope of this protein does not derive from p53, ruling out cytoplasmic retention of p53 in melanoma cell lines. A mechanism of camptothecin-induced stabilization of p53 by decreasing the level of the HDM2 mRNA was described for melanoma cells but not for normal melanocytes, which suggested a differential effect of camptothecin on tumor-derived and primary cells.",

Immunoblotting was performed to determine the expression of various proteins regulated by miR-18b. The effects of miR-18b overexpression in melanoma cell lines were investigated using assays of colony formation, cell viability, migration, invasion, and cell cycle and in a xenograft model (n = 10 mice per group). Chromatin immunoprecipitation and methylation assays were performed to determine the mechanism of microRNA silencing.;Expression of miR-18b was substantially reduced in melanoma specimens and cell lines by virtue of hypermethylation and was reinduced (by 1.5- to 5.3-fold) in melanoma cell lines after 5-AZA-deoxycytidine treatment. MDM2 was identified as a target of miR-18b action, and overexpression of miR-18b in melanoma cells was accompanied by 75% reduced MDM2 expression and 2.5-fold upregulation of p53, resulting in 70% suppression of melanoma cell colony formation. The effects of miR-18b overexpression on the p53 pathway and on melanoma cell growth were reversed by MDM2 overexpression. Stable overexpression of miR-18b produced potent tumor suppressor activity, as evidenced by suppressed melanoma cell viability, induction of apoptosis, and reduced tumor growth in vivo. miR-18b overexpression suppressed melanoma cell migration and invasiveness and reversed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.;Our results demonstrate a novel role for miR-18b as a tumor suppressor in melanoma, identify the MDM2-p53 pathway as a target of miR-18b action, and suggest miR-18b overexpression as a novel strategy to reactivate the p53 pathway in human tumors.",

Levels of tumor suppressor protein p53 are very low in cells due to its rapid turnover by UPP-mediated degradation. While p53 is mutated in human cancers, most human melanomas maintain wild-type conformation. In this study, to investigate the effects of UPP inhibitor invitro and in vivo, we used a genetically-engineered mouse model (GEMM) that has the same genetic alterations as those of human melanomas. Melanoma cells were established from mouse tumors and named 8B20 cells. Treatment of 8B20 cells with the UPP inhibitors, MG132 and clasto-lactacystin-Î²-lactone, led to an increase in levels of p53 while treatment with non-proteasomal inhibitors did not alter p53 levels. UPP inhibitors induced formation of heavy molecular weight ubiquitinated proteins, a hallmark of UPP inhibition, and p53-specific poly-ubiquitinated products in 8B20 cells. To further decipher the mechanism of p53 stabilization, we investigated half-life of p53 in cells treated with cycloheximide to block de novo protein synthesis. Treatment of 8B20 cells with MG132 led to an increase in the half-life of p53. Further analysis revealed that p53 stabilization was not mediated by phosphorylation of Ser-15 and Ser-20 residues. In vivo studies showed that MG132 induced p53 overexpression and reduced tumor growth, suggesting an important role of p53 stabilization in controlling melanoma. Taken together, our studies provide a proof of principle for using a GEMM to address the mechanisms of action and efficacy of melanoma treatment.",

Wild-type (wt) p53 is important in both G(1) and G(2) cell cycle arrest, and cyclin D1 (CD1) is necessary for G(1)-->S progression in melanoma cells. We reported that an adenoviral vector containing wt p53 significantly reduced [(3)H]thymidine uptake in melanoma cells containing mutant but not wt p53. Subsequently we showed that CD1 decreased melanoma proliferation and increased apoptosis. We now extend these findings by evaluating the effect on preformed melanomas of (1) intratumoral therapy with wt p53 alone, (2) wt p53 in combination with antisense (AS) CD1, both short (< or =14 days) and longer term, and (3) doubling the dose or repeat doses of wt p53 or AS CD1. Two melanoma cells lines that metastasize in SCID mice (451 and 1205) were used, one containing a p53 mutation (451) and the other a normal p53 gene sequence (1205). Compared to injection with a control adenoviral vector containing beta-galactosidase (LacZ), intratumoral injection of wt p53 slowed the growth of tumors formed from 451 cells. Using 5 x 10(8) plaque forming units as our standard intratumoral dose, neither doubling the dose of LacZ, p53 or AS CD1, nor repeat doses of the vectors, was as effective as combined therapy with wt p53+AS CD1, which resulted in the shrinkage of all tumors treated and 4/7 (57%) tumors vanished. No tumors treated with wt p53 or AS CD1 alone vanished. Wt p53+AS CD1 treatment resulted in significantly more cells undergoing apoptosis compared to either therapy alone. In summary, combining the separately effective treatment vectors p53 and AS CD1 led to an enhanced growth-suppressive and apoptotic effect, supporting a role for combination gene therapy to treat human malignant melanoma.",

To study the effect of p53 on melanocyte function and melanomagenesis, we crossed the â€˜high-p53â€™Mdm4+/âˆ’ mouse to the well-established TP-ras0/+ murine melanoma progression model. After treatment with the carcinogen dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA), TP-ras0/+ mice on the Mdm4+/âˆ’ background developed fewer tumors with a delay in the age of onset of melanomas compared to TP-ras0/+ mice. Furthermore, we observed a dramatic decrease in tumor growth, lack of metastasis with increased survival of TP-ras0/+: Mdm4+/âˆ’ mice. Thus, p53 effectively prevented the conversion of small benign tumors to malignant and metastatic melanoma. p53 activation in cultured primary melanocyte and melanoma cell lines using Nutlin-3, a specific Mdm2 antagonist, supported these findings.

Although melanoma cells often retain wild-type p53 tumour suppressor protein and express it at high levels, the p53 mediated apoptosis pathway is suppressed. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are a promising group of compounds inducing differentiation, growth arrest and apoptosis in tumour cells in preclinical studies. We have studied the cellular effects of trichostatin A (TSA), a HDAC inhibitor, in a panel of melanoma cell lines and its mechanism of action in relation to p53. TSA stabilized wild-type p53, but p53 protein accumulation was overridden by simultaneous downregulation of p53 mRNA leading to a decrease in p53 protein. While growth arrest was induced in all cell lines studied and apoptosis in most (6/7), these cellular effects were independent of the p53 status of the cells. Inhibiting p53 function by a dominant negative p53 (p53(175His)) confirmed that the HDAC inhibitor induced apoptosis was independent of wild-type p53, even though TSA slightly activated p53 in a reporter assay. The results indicate that while the action of TSA is independent of p53, the activation of the apoptosis pathway by the HDAC inhibitors may provide therapeutic approaches for melanoma treatment.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Advanced melanoma is difficult to treat, in part because of greater resistance to therapy compared with other cancer types. The mechanisms underlying this resistance are not well-understood. One factor that is reported to be involved in melanoma cell survival is PAX3, a transcription factor normally expressed during embryonic development, and which is critically required for development of neural crest-derivatives, including skin melanocytes. PAX3 expression is deregulated in primary melanomas and most melanoma cell lines. Here we have investigated whether targeting PAX3 expression in melanoma cell lines together with chemotherapeutic treatment increases susceptibility to therapeutic cell death. Using PAX3-specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (PAX3-AS) to treat melanoma cell lines in vitro, we showed dose-dependent reduction of proliferation of melanoma cells, and induction of apoptosis compared with control treatments. Induction of apoptosis was accompanied by the induction of active caspase-3 in UACC62 and M14 cells, and p53 protein in UACC62 cells. Treatment of melanoma cells with cisplatin induces DNA damage and cytotoxicity, which is thought to be via p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Treatment of either p53 mutant (M14) or wild-type (UACC62) melanoma cells with cisplatin, and varying doses of PAX3-AS, resulted in percentages of cells undergoing apoptosis equivalent to the sum of the individual treatments, irrespective of mutation status [e.g., UACC62, 43.8% (1 micromol/L PAX3-AS), 30.1% (20 micromol/L cisplatin), 69.6% (PAX3-AS + cisplatin); M14, 12.6% (1 micromol/L PAX3-AS), 41.5% (40 micromol/L cisplatin), 50.2% (PAX3-AS + cisplatin)].

This notorious refractoriness to therapy challenges investigators to identify agents that overcome melanoma resistance to apoptosis. Whereas many survival pathways contribute to the death-defying phenotype in melanoma, a defect in apoptotic machinery previously highlighted inactivation of Apaf-1, an apoptosome component engaged after mitochondrial damage. During studies involving Notch signaling in melanoma, we observed a gamma-secretase tripeptide inhibitor (GSI; z-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO), selected from a group of compounds originally used in Alzheimer's disease, induced apoptosis in nine of nine melanoma lines. GSI only induced G2-M growth arrest (but not killing) in five of five normal melanocyte cultures tested. Effective killing of melanoma cells by GSI involved new protein synthesis and a mitochondrial-based pathway mediated by up-regulation of BH3-only members (Bim and NOXA). p53 activation was not necessary for up-regulation of NOXA in melanoma cells. Blocking GSI-induced NOXA using an antisense (but not control) oligonucleotide significantly reduced the apoptotic response. GSI also killed melanoma cell lines with low Apaf-1 levels. We conclude that GSI is highly effective in killing melanoma cells while sparing normal melanocytes. Direct enhancement of BH3-only proteins executes an apoptotic program overcoming resistance of this lethal tumor. Identification of a p53-independent apoptotic pathway in melanoma cells, including cells with low Apaf-1, bypasses an impediment to current cytotoxic therapy and provides new targets for future therapeutic trials involving chemoresistant tumors.",

Similarly, immunolabeling for p53 protein has been used to detect mutations in the corresponding gene, as a reflection of possible cellular transformation in the same context. Both of these techniques were applied to 253 melanocytic tumors of the skin to assess their possible utility in the diagnosis and subcategorization of such lesions. They included 76 banal (common) nevi (CN), 39 Spitz nevi (SN), 62 superficial spreading malignant melanomas in radial growth (SSMMs), 32 nodular malignant melanomas (NMMs), 21 lentigo maligna melanomas in radial growth (LMMs), and 23 melanomas arising in association with preexisting compound nevi (MCN). One hundred cells were counted randomly in each tumor, and dark, exclusively nuclear reactivity was scored as positive labeling; results were recorded as percentages. Negligible Ki-67 and p53 labeling was seen in CN and SN, at a level that was similar to that obtained in cases of LMM and MCN. The largest proportion of Ki-67-positive and p53-positive cells was observed in NMMs, followed by SSMMs. Radial growth-phase SSMMs and LMMs demonstrated immunoprofiles that were similar to those of melanocytic nevi, and MCN did so as well. The prototypical malignant melanocytic tumor representing the vertical growth phase-nodular melanoma--demonstrated a statistically significant difference from all other lesions in this study with respect to Ki-67 index (P = .008, chi2) and p53 reactivity (P < .000001, chi2). Subsequent concurrent use of a Ki-67 threshold index of 10% and a p53 index of 5% correctly indicated the presence of vertical growth in 75% of NMMs, whereas only 8% of radial growth phase melanomas of other types were colabeled at the same levels of reactivity for the two markers (P < .00001, chi2). Thus, although the distinction between benign and malignant melanocytic tumors could and should not be based on immunohistology for Ki-67 and p53, these results suggest that the latter determinants may, in fact, be used as an adjunct to morphology in the recognition of the vertical growth phase in cutaneous malignant melanomas.",

This type of tumor is particularly resistant to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and the surgery remains the principal treatment for patients with localized melanoma. For this reason, there is particular interest in the melanoma biological therapy.;Using two p53 mutant melanoma models stably expressing an inducible c-myc antisense RNA, we have investigated whether Myc protein down-regulation could render melanoma cells more susceptible to radiotherapy, reestablishing apoptotic p53-independent pathway. In addition to address the role of p53 in the activation of apoptosis, we studied the effect of Myc down-regulation on radiotherapy sensitivity also in a p53 wild-type melanoma cell line.;Myc down-regulation is able per se to induce apoptosis in a fraction of the cell population (approximately 40% at 72 hours) and in combination with gamma radiation efficiently enhances the death process. In fact, approximately 80% of apoptotic cells are evident in Myc down-regulated cells exposed to gamma radiation for 72 hours compared with approximately 13% observed after only gamma radiation treatment. Consistent with the enhanced apoptosis is the inhibition of the MLH1 and MSH2 mismatch repair proteins, which, preventing the correction of ionizing radiation mismatches occurring during DNA replication, renders the cells more prone to radiation-induced apoptosis.;Data herein reported show that Myc down-regulation lowers the apoptotic threshold in melanoma cells by inhibiting MLH1 and MSH2 proteins, thus increasing cell sensitivity to gamma radiation in a p53-independent fashion.

We performed comprehensive targeted exon sequencing analysis of 467 cancer-related genes in a larger series of 15 anorectal melanomas, focusing on potentially actionable variants based on gain- and loss-of-function mutations. We report the identification of oncogenic driver events in the majority (93%) of anorectal melanomas. These included variants in canonical MAPK pathway effectors rarely observed in cutaneous melanomas (including an HRAS mutation, as well as a BRAF mutation resulting in duplication of threonine 599), and recurrent mutations in the tumor suppressor NF1 in 20% of cases, which represented the second-most frequently mutated gene after KIT in our series.

Furthermore, evidence suggests that nitric oxide, a reaction product of nitric oxide synthase, exhibits antiapoptotic activity in melanoma cells. We therefore hypothesized that nitric oxide antagonizes chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Whether nitric oxide is capable of regulating cell growth and apoptotic responses to cisplatin treatment in melanoma cell lines was evaluated. We demonstrate herein that depletion of endogenously produced nitric oxide can inhibit melanoma proliferation and promote apoptosis. Moreover, our data indicate that the depletion of nitric oxide leads to changes in cell cycle regulation and enhances cisplatin-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells. Strikingly, we observed that the depletion of nitric oxide inhibits cisplatin-induced wild type p53 accumulation and p21(Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1) expression in melanoma cells. When cisplatin-induced p53 binding to the p21(Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1) promoter was examined, it was found that nitric oxide depletion significantly reduced the presence of p53-DNA complexes after cisplatin treatment. Furthermore, dominant negative inhibition of p53 activity enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Together, these data strongly suggest that endogenously produced nitric oxide is required for cisplatin-induced p53 activation and p21(Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1) expression, which can regulate melanoma sensitivity to cisplatin.",

A specific melanoma differentiation-associated (mda) cDNA, mda-6, is described whose expression inversely correlates with melanoma progression and growth. mda-6 is identical to WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 that encodes the M(r) 21,000 protein (p21) that is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Actively growing normal melanocyte, SV40-immortalized human melanocyte and dysplastic nevus cell lines synthesize elevated levels of mda-6 mRNA; whereas, actively proliferating radial and early vertical growth phase primary melanomas as well as metastatic human melanoma cells produce reduced levels of mda-6 mRNA. Treatment of primary and metastatic human melanoma cells with IFN-beta + MEZ results in growth inhibition and an increase in mda-6 expression. mda-6 expression also increases when human melanoma cells are grown to high saturation densities or when grown in serum-free medium. Using anti-p53 and anti-p21 antibodies, an inverse correlation is found between p53 and p21 protein levels during growth arrest and differentiation. Induction of growth arrest and terminal differentiation in H0-1 human melanoma cells by IFN-beta + MEZ results in a temporal decrease in wild-type p53 protein levels with a corresponding increase in p21 levels. In the Matrigel-assisted melanoma progression model, mda-6 expression decreases in early vertical growth phase primary human melanoma cells selected for autonomous or enhanced tumor formation in nude mice.

Because even melanomas harboring wild-type (wt) p53 show an abnormal response to radiation and p53 mutations occur late during melanoma progression, we investigated whether the effect of the bcl-2/bcl-xL bispecific antisense oligonucleotide 4625 is dependent on the p53 status in human C8161 melanoma cells. Upon treatment with oligonucleotide 4625, p53-mut C8161 cells showed earlier DNA damage, which occurred concomitantly with the reduction of bcl-2 and bcl-xL expression and the increase in the expression of proapoptotic bax. Loss of cell viability, bcl-2 down-regulation, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, indicative of apoptosis, also occurred in wt p53 C8161 cells on treatment with oligonucleotide 4625. These effects, however, were mediated by strong induction of p53 without changes in p21 WAF1 expression in wt p53 cells, whereas a 70% decrease in p21 WAF1 expression was observed in mut p53 cells. In contrast to many other anticancer agents to which the apoptotic response is decreased because of p53 mutations, our data suggest that the bcl-2/bcl-xL bispecific antisense oligonucleotide 4625 effectively induces p53-independent apoptosis in human C8161 melanoma cells.",

UVA and UVB components of sunlight are implicated in melanomagenesis; however the majority of studies have focused on the effects of UVB and UVC light. Interestingly, melanoma tumour sequencing has revealed an overrepresentation of mutations signature of unrepaired UV-induced DNA damage. Repair of UVA-induced DNA damage is thought to occur primarily through the Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) pathway, which recognises and repairs damage either coupled to transcription (Transcription Coupled Repair; TCR), or through global genome scanning (Global Genome Repair; GGR). Current literature suggests NER is deficient in melanoma, however the cause of this remains unknown; and whether reduced NER activity in response to UVA may be involved in melanoma development remains uncharacterised. In this study we aimed to determine if melanoma cells exhibit reduced levels of NER activity in response to UVA.;Melanocyte and melanoma cell lines were UVA-irradiated, and DNA damage levels assessed by immunodetection of Cyclobutane Pyrimidine Dimer (CPD) and (6-4) Photoproduct [(6-4)PP] lesions. Expression of NER pathway components and p53 following UVA treatment was quantified by qPCR and western blot.;UVA did not induce detectable induction of (6-4)PP lesions, consistent with previous studies. Repair of CPDs induced by UVA was initiated at 4Â h and complete within 48Â h in normal melanocytes, whereas repair initiation was delayed to 24Â h andÂ >40Â % of lesions remained in melanoma cell lines at 48Â h. This was coupled with a delayed and reduced induction of GGR component XPC in melanoma cells, independent of p53.;These findings support that NER activity is reduced in melanoma cells due to deficient GGR. Further investigation into the role of NER in UVA-induced melanomagenesis is warranted and may have implications for melanoma treatment.",

We analysed the functionality of the p53-signaling pathway in a panel of seven human melanoma cell lines consisting of one p53-deficient line, two lines with mutant p53, and four lines expressing wild-type p53. Only lines with wild-type p53 were characterized by elevated levels of endogenous p21, high activity of p53-responsive reporters and accumulation of p53 in response to genotoxic stress, common properties of functional p53. The presence of wild-type p53 was associated with depletion or loss of p14ARF and p16 expression. The levels of p33ING1b and p24ING1c, two major products of Ing1 locus and putative coregulators of p53, were elevated in all cell lines tested; however, ectopic expression of either ING1 isoform had no effect on cell proliferation. All lines retained expression of Apaf-1, and all but one remained sensitive to ectopic expression of retrovirus-transduced p53. Our data indicate that regardless of abnormally high levels of p53 in melanomas, their p53 remains competent in transactivation of its targets, and, if highly overexpressed, capable of growth inhibition.

Despite the latest success of BRAF V600E-targeted therapies, responses are typically short lived and relapse is all but certain. Furthermore, a percentage (40%) of melanoma cells is BRAF wild type. Emerging evidence suggests a role for normal host cells in the occurrence of drug resistance. In the current study, we compared a variety of cell culture models with an organotypic incomplete skin culture model (the \"dermal equivalent\") to investigate the role of the tissue microenvironment in the response of melanoma cells to the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (Dox). In the dermal equivalent model, consisting of fibroblasts embedded in type I collagen matrix, melanoma cells showed a decreased cytotoxic response when compared with less complex culture conditions, such as seeding on plastic cell culture plate (as monolayers cultures) or on collagen gel. We further investigated the role of the microenvironment in p53 induction and caspase 3 and 9 cleavage. Melanoma cell lines cultured on dermal equivalent showed decreased expression of p53 after Dox treatment, and this outcome was accompanied by induction of interleukin IL-6, IL-8, and matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9. Here, we show that the growth of melanoma cells in the dermal equivalent model inflects drug responses by recapitulating important pro-survival features of the tumor microenvironment. These studies indicate that the presence of stroma enhances the drug resistance of melanoma in vitro, more closely mirroring the in vivo phenotype. Our data, thus, demonstrate the utility of organotypic cell culture models in providing essential context-dependent information critical for the development of new therapeutic strategies for melanoma. We believe that the organotypic model represents an improved screening platform to investigate novel anti-cancer agents, as it provides important insights into tumor-stromal interactions, thus assisting in the elucidation of chemoresistance mechanisms.

The level of survivin expression was significantly higher in the p53 positive group of melanomas compared with the p53 negative one, suggesting a cooperative effect in favouring the progression of melanoma, while no correlation was found between survivin and p16. Moreover, the altered expression of nuclear survivin, p53 and p16 were all associated with poor survival, as demonstrated by univariate analysis. However, these biomarkers have been shown to have superior predictive value when studied in combination (P<0.0001) rather than alone, while the risk of mortality grew progressively with increasing the number of altered biomarkers.

Repurposing approved and abandoned non-oncological drugs is an alternative approach to the identification and development of anticancer therapeutics, and antimalarials that target autophagic-lysosomal functions have recently attracted considerable attention as candidates for oncological repurposing. Since cumulative research suggests that dependence on autophagy represents a specific vulnerability of malignant melanoma cells, we screened a focused compound library of antimalarials for antimelanoma activity. Here we report for the first time that amodiaquine (AQ), a clinical 4-aminoquinoline antimalarial with unexplored cancer-directed chemotherapeutic potential, causes autophagic-lysosomal and proliferative blockade in melanoma cells that surpasses that of its parent compound chloroquine. Monitoring an established set of protein markers (LAMP1, LC3-II, SQSTM1) and cell ultrastructural changes detected by electron microscopy, we observed that AQ treatment caused autophagic-lysosomal blockade in malignant A375 melanoma cells, a finding substantiated by detection of rapid inactivation of lysosomal cathepsins (CTSB, CTSL, CTSD). AQ-treatment was associated with early induction of energy crisis (ATP depletion) and sensitized melanoma cells to either starvation- or chemotherapeutic agent-induced cell death. AQ displayed potent antiproliferative effects, and gene expression array analysis revealed changes at the mRNA (CDKN1A, E2F1) and protein level (TP53, CDKN1A, CCND1, phospho-RB1 [Ser 780]/[Ser 807/811], E2F1) consistent with the observed proliferative blockade in S-phase.

To improve tumor response to DTIC current clinical trials in melanoma focus on combining a novel targeted agent with chemotherapy. Here, we demonstrate that tyrosinase which is commonly overexpressed in melanoma activates the bioflavonoid quercetin (Qct) and promotes an ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-dependent DNA damage response. This response sensitizes melanoma cells that overexpress tyrosinase to DTIC. In DB-1 melanoma cells that overexpress tyrosinase (Tyr(+) cells), the threshold for phosphorylation of ATM and p53 at serine 15 was observed at a low dose of Qct (25 microM) when compared to the mock transfected pcDNA3 cells, which required a higher dose (75 microM). Both pcDNA3 and Tyr(+) DB-1 cells demonstrated similar increases in phosphorylation of p53 at other serine sites, but in the Tyr(+) cells, DNApk expression was found to be reduced compared to control cells, indicating a shift towards an ATM-mediated response. The DB-1 control cells were resistant to DTIC, but were sensitized to apoptosis with high dose Qct, while Tyr(+) cells were sensitized to DTIC with low or high dose Qct. Qct also sensitized SK Mel 5 (p53 wildtype) and 28 (p53 mutant) cells to DTIC. However, when SK Mel 5 cells were transiently transfected with tyrosinase and treated with Qct plus DTIC, SK Mel 5 cells demonstrated a more than additive induction of apoptosis. Therefore, this study demonstrates that tyrosinase overexpression promotes an ATM-dependent p53 phosphorylation by Qct treatment and sensitizes melanoma cells to dacarbazine. In conclusion, these results suggest that Qct or Qct analogues may significantly improve DTIC response rates in tumors that express tyrosinase.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Interleukin (IL)-1-mediated inflammation is proposed to contribute to the development and progression of some cancers. IL-1 family member proteins are known to be expressed constitutively in many melanoma tumor cells, and we hypothesize that these support molecular pathways of inflammation and facilitate tumor growth. To investigate the expression of IL-1Î± and IL-1Î² in melanoma patients, and their association with disease progression, immunohistochemical staining was carried out on tissues from 170 patients including benign nevi, primary melanomas, and metastatic melanomas. IL-1Î² levels were low (or zero) in benign nevi and higher in primary and metastatic melanomas (P < 0.0001). IL-1Î± was expressed in about 73% of nevi and 55% of metastatic melanomas, with levels significantly higher in primary tumors (P < 0.0001); most (98%) primary melanoma samples were positive for IL-1Î±. In vitro studies with seven human melanoma cell lines showed that five cell lines expressed IL-1Î± and IL-1Î² proteins and mRNA. We identified for the first time several important downstream signaling pathways affected by endogenous IL-1, including reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, COX-2, and phosphorylated NF-ÎºB inhibitor (IÎºB) and stress-activated protein kinase/c-jun-NH(2)-kinase; all of which were decreased by siRNA to IL-1s. Downregulation of IL-1Î±, IL-1Î², or MyD88 substantially increased p21 and p53 levels. Treatment with IL-1 receptor type I neutralizing antibody or IL-1 pathway-specific siRNAs led to growth arrest in IL-1-positive melanoma cells. Furthermore, blocking the IL-1 pathway increased autophagy in IL-1-positive melanoma cells. These results indicate that the endogenous IL-1 system is functional in most human melanoma and interrupting its signaling inhibits the growth of IL-1-positive melanoma cells.",

Thirty-two patients with mucosal melanoma of the head and neck who received local treatment with or without adjuvant chemotherapy were reviewed. Clinicopathologic parameters including anatomic sites, gender, age (60 vs.>60years), stage, level of invasion, p53 and MDM2 [murine double minute 2] expressions, performance status, and adjuvant chemotherapy were evaluated. The patients' median age was 62years, and 16 (50%) received adjuvant chemotherapy. Expressions of p53 and MDM2 were demonstrated in six of 24 and three of 26 cases, respectively. Predictors of poor survival according to univariate analysis were level of invasion and anatomic location of the primary tumor. Patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy had prolonged survival (p=0.002), which was also shown in the multivariate Cox regression model (HR, 0.24; p=0.014). Our analysis suggests a significant role of adjuvant chemotherapy and different patterns of p53 and MDM2 expression in HNMM relative to cutaneous melanomas.

        "Doc_abstract":"In the present report, the role of ATR-Chk1-Wee1 and ATM-Chk2-p53-p21 pathways in stress-induced cell cycle control is analysed in melanoma cells. Treatment of p53 wild-type melanoma cells with the genotoxic agent doxorubicin induces G2-M arrest, inhibitory phosphorylation of cell cycle kinase Cdc2 (CDK1) and enhanced expression of p53/p21. Wee1 inhibition under doxorubicin pulse-treatment reduces G2-M arrest and induces apoptosis. Inhibition of upstream kinase Chk1 under doxorubicin treatment almost completely abolishes stress-induced G2-M arrest and induces enhanced apoptosis. Interestingly, Chk1 inhibition alone even further increases apoptosis. While Chk1 inhibition alone almost completely abolishes G0-G1 arrest, combined treatment with doxorubicin re-establishes G0-G1 arrest. Moreover, Chk1 inhibition alone induces only a slight p53/p21 induction, while a strong induction of both proteins is observed by the combination with doxorubicin. These findings are suggestive for a particular role of p53/p21 in G0-G1, and Chk1 in G0-G1 and G2-M arrest. In line with this, the p53-mutant SK-Mel-28 melanoma cells do not mount a significant G0-G1 arrest under combined doxorubicin and Chk1 inhibitor treatment but rather show extensive apoptosis. Moreover, knockdown of p21 dramatically reduces stress-induced G0-G1 arrest under doxorubicin and Chk1 inhibitor treatment accompanied by massive DNA damage and apoptosis induction. Treatment of melanoma cells with an inhibitor of Chk2 upstream kinase ATM and doxorubicin almost completely abolishes G0-G1 arrest. Taken together, both Chk1 and Wee1 are mediators of G2-M arrest, while p53, p21 and Chk1 are mediators of G0-G1 arrest in melanoma cells. Combined treatment with chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin and Chk1 inhibitors may help to overcome apoptosis resistance of p53-proficient melanoma cells. But treatment with Chk1 inhibitor alone may even be more efficient.",

To support the search for possible sensitizers, we explored the effects of the cellular oncoproteins c-Myc and N-Ras, which can decrease the clonogenic potential of irradiated p53-negative IGR39D melanoma cells. Using stable transfectants of this cell line, we showed that mutant N-Ras decreased the proliferation rate by inducing a prolonged cell cycle arrest. In contrast, c-Myc made these melanoma cells more prone to radiation-induced cell death. Membrane blebbing, the formation of apoptotic bodies and caspase activation, as measured by cleavage of Asp-Glu-Val-Asp (DEVD) substrate and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), indicate that these cells die by an apoptotic process. c-Myc also sensitized these p53-deficient melanoma cells to treatment with various cytotoxic drugs and heat shock. Similar results were obtained in inducible c-Myc models of IGR39D and in another melanoma cell line, 9007, which expresses functional p53. Together, these findings indicate that c-Myc is capable of sensitizing typically resistant tumour cells and that this occurs irrespective of the functional status of the p53 protein.

Exenteration of the orbit due to the extrascleral extension of malignant melanoma of the uvea is very rare, unfortunately, even today in certain cases it is necessary to make such a mutilating surgery.;Case report--65 year old female patient, sent to our Departement in 2008 with the finding of the pigment deposits on the posterior pole of the left eye. Ultrasound study found elevations of up to 3 mm, she was asked to come for further control in three months interval. She did not coma, furthermore she sporadically attended another eye clinic. In 2011 she was treated for secondary glaucoma--cyclocryopexia. Due to pain another surgery--tarzoraphia was indicated. In 2012 she underwent surgery at St. Elisabeth Cancer Institute in Bratislava--Nefrectomia transperitoneally l. dx., excision hepatis. Histological examination in addition to the primary papillary renal carcinoma--mucinous tubular T1 Nx Mx type, found the metastasis of malignant melanoma to the liver and right kidney. She underwent the diagnostic procedure to find the origo of the melanoma. The patient was subsequently admitted to our clinic with blind painfull eye for enucleation.

Canine malignant melanoma is a rapidly metastatic disease that generally is incurable. The loss of function of cellular safeguards built into the genetic program and of immune surveillance systems that cooperate to prevent tumor formation and progression appear to be important underlying causes of canine malignant melanoma. In effect, many existing cancer treatments restore the function of 1 or the other of these mechanisms. For example, chemotherapy and radiotherapy often kill tumor cells by initiating a genetic suicide mechanism (apoptosis), and immunotherapy initiates or enhances a response by the body's immune cells to identify and destroy cancer cells by mechanisms that rely on direct cytotoxicity or apoptotic cell death. Nevertheless, standard therapeutic approaches have not proved effective in treatment of canine malignant melanoma, with only marginal improvement in the outcome of dogs with this disease. The advantages of an improved understanding of the molecular basis of canine cancer are underscored by recent promising advances in diagnosis and in immunologic and genetic therapies that may help reduce the mortality of dogs affected with malignant melanoma.",

Nevertheless, acquired resistance and nonresponders to therapy require different strategies. An innovative approach is presented here that is based on the combination of innate immune system activation and simultaneous targeting of the oncogene urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR). We generated two triphosphate-conjugated siRNAs targeting uPAR (ppp-uPAR) by inÂ vitro transcription. Specific uPAR knockdown and simultaneous activation of the retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) was shown in different human melanoma cells, fibroblasts, and melanocytes. The compounds induced massive apoptosis in melanoma cells, whereas fibroblasts and melanocytes were less sensitive. The effects were less pronounced when the IFN receptor was blocked. Treatment with ppp-uPAR led to accumulation of p53 and induction of RIG-I-dependent proapoptotic signaling. The apoptotic effects induced by ppp-uPAR were maintained in melanoma cell lines that had acquired double resistance to B-RAF and MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibition. Systemic intraperitoneal application of ppp-uPAR in nude mice significantly reduced growth of human melanoma xenografts and elicited a systemic innate immune response with increased serum cytokine levels.

DNA repair pathways are multiple and are able to repair, usually in an error-free manner, all kinds of DNA damage induced by exogenous and endogenous genotoxic agents. This review describes the role of DNA repair process in protecting us from cancer and particularly nucleotide excision deficiencies that are associated with melanoma development. Resistance of tumoral cells to antitumoral regimen can be caused by overexpression of DNA repair processes. We showed that melanoma metastasis was associated with higher expression of some DNA repair pathways leading to a better surveillance of replication fork fidelity. We showed a partially coordinated regulation of these repair genes. P53 and several transcription factors may regulate numerous of these repair genes. The repair pathways that are overexpressed in metastatic melanoma are those particularly efficient in repairing the major DNA damage produced by cytotoxic treatments.

        "Doc_abstract":"Wild-type p53 is commonly expressed in melanoma but does not appear to be effective in the induction of apoptosis. One explanation is that p53 is targeted for degradation by the E3 ligase MDM2. However, we found in this study that blockade of the interaction of p53 and MDM2 by the MDM2 antagonist nutlin-3 in melanoma cells did not induce apoptosis, even though it upregulated p53 and its proapoptotic targets. Nevertheless, nutlin-3 enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis as a result of p53-mediated upregulation of TRAIL-R2. Unexpectedly, nutlin-3 upregulated Mcl-1, which attenuated apoptotic signaling triggered by TRAIL, and inhibited apoptosis induced by the microtubule-targeting drug docetaxel. The increase in Mcl-1 was related to a p53-independent transcriptional mechanism, but stabilization of the Mcl-1 protein played a dominant role, as nutlin-3 upregulated the Mcl-1 protein to a much greater extent than the Mcl-1 mRNA, and this was associated with prolonged half-life time and reduced ubiquitination of the protein. Knockdown of p53 blocked the upregulation of the Mcl-1 protein, indicating that p53 plays a critical role in the stabilization of Mcl-1. The contrasting effects of nutlin-3 on TRAIL- and docetaxel-induced apoptosis were confirmed in fresh melanoma isolates. Collectively, these results show that nutlin-3 may be a useful agent in combination with TRAIL and, importantly, uncover a novel regulatory effect of p53 on the expression of Mcl-1 in melanoma cells on treatment with nutlin-3, which may antagonize the therapeutic efficacy of other chemotherapeutic drugs in addition to docetaxel in melanoma.",

Annexin-V staining and caspase activation analysis revealed induction of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. The expression of members of the Bcl-2 family (Bax, Bcl-2, Bak and Bcl-x(L)) was changed in a pro-apoptotic manner. uPAR inhibition induced the expression of the tumor suppressor p53 and of its downstream target gene p21. Inhibition of p53 rescued cells from apoptosis indicating that p53 was critical for apoptosis induction. Apoptosis was observed in melanoma cells carrying activating BRAF mutations and occurred in the presence of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. uPAR can activate focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which is implicated in adhesion-dependent tumor cell survival. However, inhibition of FAK did not induce apoptosis. Our data suggest a new function of uPAR acting as a survival factor for melanoma by downregulating p53.

In this study, we purified the sesquiterpene lactones (SLs), Tomentosin and Inuviscolide from Inula viscosa (Compositae) leaves and studied their anti-cancer potency against human melanoma cell lines in order to develop new agents for melanoma treatment. SLs inhibited the proliferation of three human melanoma cell lines: SK-28, 624 mel and 1363 mel in a dose-dependent manner. We further investigated SLs mechanism of action using SK-28 as a representative cell line model. SLs caused cell-cycle arrest at G(2)/M, accompanied by the appearance of a sub-G0 fraction, indicative of apoptotic cell death. Induction of apoptosis was further confirmed by changes in membrane phospholipids, changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi) and by detection of Caspase-3 activity. Rapid inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdc2 (Thr14 and Tyr15) was seen early after treatment, followed by a later decrease in the expression level of both Cyclin b1 and Cdc2. Induction of p53 and p21(waf1) proteins and phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 were also detected early after treatment. The anti-apoptotic proteins, p65 subunit of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), and Survivin were reduced in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, these changes partially explain the ability of the SLs to induce G(2)/M arrest and apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis by Tomentosin and Inuviscolide in human aggressive melanoma cell lines has high pharmacological value and implies that SLs might be developed as new agents for melanoma treatment.",

Metformin caused a G(2)/M cell cycle arrest associated with apoptotic death of melanoma cells, as confirmed by the flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle/DNA fragmentation, phosphatidylserine exposure and caspase activation. Metformin-mediated apoptosis of melanoma cells was preceded by induction of oxidative stress and mitochondrial membrane depolarization, measured by flow cytometry in cells stained with appropriate fluorescent reporter dyes. The expression of tumor suppressor protein p53 was increased, while the mRNA levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 were reduced by metformin, as revealed by cell-based ELISA and real-time RT-PCR, respectively. Treatment with metformin did not stimulate expression of the cycle blocker p21, indicating that p21 was dispensable for the observed cell cycle arrest. The activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was not required for the anti-melanoma action of metformin, as AMPK inhibitor compound C completely failed to restore viability of metformin-treated B16 cells. Metformin induced autophagy in B16 cells, as demonstrated by flow cytometry-detected increase in intracellular acidification and immunoblot-confirmed upregulation of autophagosome-associated LC3-II. Autophagy inhibitors ammonium chloride and wortmannin partly restored the viability of metformin-treated melanoma cells. Finally, oral administration of metformin led to a significant reduction in tumor size in a B16 mouse melanoma model. These data suggest that anti-melanoma effects of metformin are mediated through p21- and AMPK-independent cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and autophagy associated with p53/Bcl-2 modulation, mitochondrial damage and oxidative stress.",

Additionally, CP-31398 was found to be able to convert mutant p53 to wild-type conformation in several cell lines.;To examine if CP-31398 can revert all mutant p53 proteins to wild-type function.;We studied a series of apoptotic responses to CP-31398 in three melanoma cell lines varying in p53 mutation status.;Upon a moderate dose of CP-31398 treatment (15 microg mL(-1)), only the wild-type p53 MMRU and the single p53 point mutation MeWo cells exhibited apoptosis. Another melanoma cell line, Sk-mel-110, containing multiple p53 mutations, did not exhibit apoptosis. Although CP-31398 enhanced overall p53 protein level, its ability to promote proper folding of p53 protein was limited to CP-31398-sensitive MMRU and MeWo cells. These sensitive cells showed an increased Bax and PUMA transcription, altered mitochondrial membrane potential, followed by the release of cytochrome c, and cleaved caspase-9 and caspase-3. We also demonstrated that Apaf-1 was not involved in CP-31398-mediated apoptosis.;Our results suggest that the ability of CP-31398 to revert mutant p53 proteins to wild-type conformation may be correlated to p53 mutational status.

He was underwent to an abdomino-perineal resection (APR). Histopathology of the specimen showed a melanoma (S-100 stain positive). Two years after the resection, metastases in the abdomen and right lung were found. He died one and half years later. Primary anorectal melanoma is a rare and very aggressive disorder. According to current data, one should always perform a S-100 stain when anorectal sarcoma is suspected. A positive S-100 stain suggests the tumour to be most likely a melanoma. Subsequently, thorough dissemination studies need to be performed. Depending on the outcome of the dissemination studies, a surgical resection has to be performed. Nowadays, a sphincter-saving local excision combined with adjuvant loco-regional radiotherapy should be preferred in case of small tumors. The same loco-regional control is achieved with less \"loss of function\" compared to non-sphincter saving surgery.

This mutation enhances IkappaB kinase (IKK)/nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase/activator protein signaling cascades. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of targeting either B-Raf or IKKbeta in combination with the DNA alkylating agent temozolomide for treatment of advanced metastatic melanoma. Xenografts of Hs294T human metastatic melanoma cells exhibiting the BRAFV600E mutation were treated with inhibitors of IKKbeta (BMS-345541), B-Raf (BAY 54-9085), and/or temozolomide. Drug response was mechanistically analyzed in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we determined that the antitumor activity of all three drugs depends on inhibition of NF-kappaB. BMS-345541 inhibits IKKbeta-mediated phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha and thus blocks the nuclear localization of NF-kappaB, whereas BAY 54-9085 inhibits activation of NF-kappaB through a mechanism that does not involve stabilization of IkappaBalpha. Moreover, BMS-345541, but not BAY 54-9085, activates the death pathways of p53 and c-Jun-NH2-kinase, contributing to the killing of melanoma cells. Temozolomide inhibits both NF-kappaB and extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity, conferring effective in vivo antitumor activity. Thus, temozolomide, but not BAY 54-9085, has a synergistic in vivo antitumor effect with BMS-345541. We conclude that the efficacy of antimelanoma therapy depends on inhibition of expression of antiapoptotic genes transcriptionally regulated by NF-kappaB. In contrast, drug targeting of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway alone in melanoma cells is ineffective for melanoma therapy in cases where NF-kappaB is not also targeted.",

In the current study, the effect of adenovirus-mediated E2F-1 gene transfer on human melanoma cell growth was investigated.;Two human melanoma cell lines, SK-MEL-28 (wild-type p53) and SK-MEL-2 (mutant p53), were treated by mock infection, infection with a control vector expressing the beta-galactosidase gene (Ad5CMV-LacZ), or infection with a vector expressing E2F-1 (Ad5CMV-E2F-1) at a multiplicity of infection of 100. Cell proliferation and viability were determined by WST-1 assay and trypan blue exclusion, respectively. Apoptosis was assessed by cell flow cytometry and confirmed by cell morphology, in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl nick end labeling assay, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage assay.;Marked overexpression of E2F-1 was evident in both cell lines 24 hours after infection with Ad5CMVE2F-1 by Western blot analysis. E2F-1 overexpression resulted in growth inhibition and rapid loss of cell viability. Overexpression of E2F-1 also resulted in premature S-phase entry and G(2) arrest at 24 hours followed by apoptotic cell death at 48 hours. After Ad5CMVE2F-1 infection, expression of Bax and Bak was unchanged, whereas Mcl-1 levels decreased markedly. In SK-MEL-28 cells, Bcl-XL levels also declined after E2F-1 expression. Bcl-2 was undetectable in SK-MEL-28 cells but was increased in SK-MEL-2 cells in response to E2F-1 overexpression.;Adenovirus-mediated E2F-1 gene transfer efficiently induces widespread apoptosis in human melanoma cells. E2F-1 overexpression induced apoptosis in cell lines containing wild-type and mutant p53, suggesting that this effect does not require wild-type p53 function. Anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family, notably Mcl-1 and Bcl-XL, may be involved in mediating the response to E2F-1.

The antifolate agents induced apoptosis in SK-MEL-2 and SK-MEL-28 cells as confirmed by the TUNEL technique and Comet Assay. Western-blot analysis showed a down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein level and PARP cleavage, otherwise p53 and Bax expressions were not modulated. Moreover, these antifolate-induced apoptosis was accompanied by both pro-caspase-9 and -8 activations. These results were supported by the use of the pan-caspases inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK that almost completely decreased the amount of apoptosis in both the melanoma cell lines treated with antifolate.

Temozolomide, a promising new derivative of dacarbazine, is currently being tested for treatment of metastatic melanoma. Resistance to alkylating agents such as temozolomide correlates with increased expression of DNA repair protein O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). Interleukin-24 (IL-24; mda-7) is a tumor suppressor cytokine that selectively inhibits tumor cell growth by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in melanoma cell lines and solid tumors. This tumor-selective activity has been observed in multiple preclinical animal models and in clinical trials. In this study, we analyzed the ability of Ad-IL-24 and its protein product, IL-24, to overcome temozolomide resistance in human melanoma cells. We have shown that Ad-IL-24 via exogenous IL-24 protein induces combinatorial synergy of temozolomide-induced cell killing in temozolomide-resistant melanoma cells by inhibition of MGMT. Neutralizing antibodies against IL-24 or its receptors significantly blocked the apoptotic activity of IL-24 + MGMT treatment. We show that accumulation of functional p53 is essential for IL-24-induced down-regulation of MGMT. Using either MGMT small interfering RNA, p53 small interfering RNA, or a p53 dominant-negative mutant to block MGMT protein expression resulted in increased sensitization to temozolomide. However, MGMT blockade in combination with IL-24 + temozolomide resulted in loss of combinatorial synergy, indicating that MGMT expression is required for the reversal of temozolomide resistance in melanoma cells. This study shows that IL-24 can play a significant role in overcoming temozolomide resistance and that the clinical efficacy of temozolomide may be improved by using a biochemotherapy combination with IL-24.",

It was shown that TSA treatment led to a transient G(2)/M phase delay and accumulation of unphosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRB) in all cases. TSA significantly induced protein expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(WAF1/CIP1) in a dose-dependent manner in all cell lines including those not expressing p21(WAF1/CIP1) constitutively, whereas the levels of both wild-type and mutated p53 protein were reduced. The effect on p53 was not a direct result of inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) activation by TSA, as treatment of the cells with the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase-1 (MEK1) inhibitor PD98059 did not result in decreased p53 protein level. Furthermore, TSA treatment led to reduction in cyclin D1 whereas cyclin D3 accumulated, the latter due to increased protein stability. Similarly, cyclin A protein was reduced whereas cyclin E level was elevated. The effect on p27(Kip1), CDK4 and CDK2 was only marginal. In all the examined cell lines, TSA treatment resulted in a profound induction of apoptosis and cleavage of poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP) indicative of caspase activity. Similarly, TSA-mediated apoptosis was reversed by the caspase-inhibitor z-vad-fmk.

First-line chemotherapeutics used in melanoma therapy are the methylating agents dacarbazine (DTIC) and temozolomide (TMZ) and the chloroethylating agents BCNU and fotemustine. Here, we determined the mode of cell death in 11 melanoma cell lines upon exposure to TMZ and fotemustine. We show for the first time that TMZ induces apoptosis in melanoma cells, using therapeutic doses. For both TMZ and fotemustine apoptosis is the dominant mode of cell death. The contribution of necrosis to total cell death varied between 10 and 40%. The O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) activity in the cell lines was between 0 and 1100 fmol mg(-1) protein, and there was a correlation between MGMT activity and the level of resistance to TMZ and fotemustine. MGMT inactivation by O(6)-benzylguanine sensitized all melanoma cell lines expressing MGMT to TMZ and fotemustine-induced apoptosis, and MGMT transfection attenuated the apoptotic response. This supports that O(6)-alkylguanines are critical lesions involved in the initiation of programmed melanoma cell death. One of the cell lines (MZ7), derived from a patient subjected to DTIC therapy, exhibited a high level of resistance to TMZ without expressing MGMT. This was related to an impaired expression of MSH2 and MSH6. The cells were not cross-resistant to fotemustine. Although these data indicate that methylating drug resistance of melanoma cells can be acquired by down-regulation of mismatch repair, a correlation between MSH2 and MSH6 expression in the different lines and TMZ sensitivity was not found. Apoptosis in melanoma cells induced by TMZ and fotemustine was accompanied by double-strand break (DSB) formation (as determined by H2AX phosphorylation) and caspase-3 and -7 activation as well as PARP cleavage. For TMZ, DSBs correlated significantly with the apoptotic response, whereas for fotemustine a correlation was not found. Melanoma lines expressing p53 wild-type were more resistant to TMZ and fotemustine than p53 mutant melanoma lines, which is in marked contrast to previous data reported for glioma cells treated with TMZ. Overall, the findings are in line with the model that in melanoma cells TMZ-induced O(6)-methylguanine triggers the apoptotic (and necrotic) pathway through DSBs, whereas for chloroethylating agents apoptosis is triggered in a more complex manner.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The treatment of melanoma has been revolutionized over the past decade with the development of effective molecular and immune targeted therapies. The great majority of patients with melanoma have mutations in oncogenes that predominantly drive signaling through the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Analytic tools have been developed that can effectively stratify patients into molecular subsets based on the identification of mutations in oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes that drive the MAPK pathway. At the same time, potent and selective inhibitors of mediators of the MAPK pathway such as RAF, MEK, and ERK have become available. The most dramatic example is the development of single-agent inhibitors of BRAF (vemurafenib, dabrafenib, encorafenib) and MEK (trametinib, cobimetinib, binimetinib) for patients with metastatic BRAFV600-mutant melanoma, a subset that represents 40% to 50% of patients with metastatic melanoma. More recently, the elucidation of mechanisms underlying resistance to single-agent BRAF inhibitor therapy led to a second generation of trials that demonstrated the superiority of BRAF inhibitor/MEK inhibitor combinations (dabrafenib/trametinib; vemurafenib/cobimetinib) compared to single-agent BRAF inhibitors. Moving beyond BRAFV600 targeting, a number of other molecular subsets--such as mutations in MEK, NRAS, and non-V600 BRAF and loss of function of the tumor suppressor neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1)--are predicted to respond to MAPK pathway targeting by single-agent pan-RAF, MEK, or ERK inhibitors. As these strategies are being tested in clinical trials, preclinical and early clinical trial data are now emerging about which combinatorial approaches might be best for these patients.",

We previously sequenced 24 cancer genes in those cell lines. Eleven of the genes were found to be mutated in three or more of the lines. Using a pharmacogenomic approach, we analyzed the relationship between drug activity and mutations in those 11 genes (APC, RB1, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, PTEN, STK11, MADH4, TP53, and CDKN2A). That analysis identified an association between mutation in BRAF and the antiproliferative potential of phenothiazine compounds. Phenothiazines have been used as antipsychotics and as adjunct antiemetics during cancer chemotherapy and more recently have been reported to have anticancer properties. However, to date, the anticancer mechanism of action of phenothiazines has not been elucidated. To follow up on the initial pharmacologic observations in the NCI-60 screen, we did pharmacologic experiments on 11 of the NCI-60 cell lines and, prospectively, on an additional 24 lines. The studies provide evidence that BRAF mutation (codon 600) in melanoma as opposed to RAS mutation is predictive of an increase in sensitivity to phenothiazines as determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt assay (Wilcoxon P = 0.007). That pattern of increased sensitivity to phenothiazines based on the presence of codon 600 BRAF mutation may be unique to melanomas, as we do not observe it in a panel of colorectal cancers. The findings reported here have potential implications for the use of phenothiazines in the treatment of V600E BRAF mutant melanoma.",

Additional slides were investigated applying standard immunohistochemical methods with antibodies specific for cyclin D1 protein, pRB, p53, p21, p16, BCL-2, and MIB-1.;Cyclin D1 protein and pRB were negative in retinoblastoma using the applied antibodies. In contrast, cyclin D1 protein expression was observed in 65% of uveal melanomas; a positive correlation between cyclin D1 cell positivity and tumour cell type, location, growth fraction, as well as with pRB positivity was observed. p53, p21, and p16 could be demonstrated in both tumours. An inverse relation between p53 and p21 expression was demonstrated in most choroidal melanomas and in some retinoblastomas. Apart from a decrease in the growth fractions of the tumours as determined by MIB-1, a significant difference in the expression of G1-S phase transition markers in vital areas of uveal melanoma and retinoblastoma following treatment with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy was not observed.;Retinoblastomas and uveal melanomas, two tumours of differing pRB status, differ also in their immunohistochemical pattern for markers of the G1-S phase transition of the cell cycle. The results of the present study support the concept of (a) an autoregulatory loop between pRB and cyclin D1 in tumours with a functional pRB and the disruption of this loop in the presence of pRB mutation, as well as (b) a checkpoint mechanism in late G1, whose regulation via loss of p16 or pRB, or overexpression of cyclin D1 constitutes a common pathway to malignancy.

It phosphorylates p53, for example, and induces its nuclear export, HDM2-dependent ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation. GSK-3Î² can either enhance or inhibit programmed cell death, depending on the nature of the pro-apoptotic stimulus. We previously showed that the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib activated GSK-3Î² and that this activation attenuated the cytotoxic effects of the drug in various BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines. In this report, we describe the results of studies exploring the effects of GSK-3Î² on the cytotoxicity and antitumor activity of sorafenib combined with the HDM2 antagonist MI-319.;MI-319 alone increased p53 levels and p53-dependent gene expression in melanoma cells but did not induce programmed cell death. Its cytotoxicity, however, was augmented in some melanoma cell lines by the addition of sorafenib. In responsive cell lines, the MI-319/sorafenib combination induced the disappearance of p53 from the nucleus, the down modulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, the translocation of p53 to the mitochondria and that of AIF to the nuclei. These events were all GSK-3Î²-dependent in that they were blocked with a GSK-3Î² shRNA and facilitated in otherwise unresponsive melanoma cell lines by the introduction of a constitutively active form of the kinase (GSK-3Î²-S9A). These modulatory effects of GSK-3Î² on the activities of the sorafenib/MI-319 combination were the exact reverse of its effects on the activities of sorafenib alone, which induced the down modulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and the nuclear translocation of AIF only in cells in which GSK-3Î² activity was either down modulated or constitutively low. In A375 xenografts, the antitumor effects of sorafenib and MI-319 were additive and associated with the down modulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, the nuclear translocation of AIF, and increased suppression of tumor angiogenesis.;Our data demonstrate a complex partnership between GSK-3Î² and HDM2 in the regulation of p53 function in the nucleus and mitochondria. The data suggest that the ability of sorafenib to activate GSK-3Î² and alter the intracellular distribution of p53 may be exploitable as an adjunct to agents that prevent the HDM2-dependent degradation of p53 in the treatment of melanoma.",

Because of the declining success in melanoma therapy, the curative treatment for advanced stage melanoma has been a challenge for clinicians. Several mutations such as N-RAS, p53, BRAF including mutant-BRAF that lead to activation of kinase pathway, are implicated in the development of malignant melanoma. However, the current literature depicts that the prognostic role of BRAF mutation in disease progression is still controversial. While its higher level in advanced stage disease is associated with decreased overall survival (OS), some studies show that it failed to confer as an independent prognostic predictor of the disease. This has also led researchers to accomplish newer therapeutic strategies that lead to improved disease-response and grant survival benefits. Vemurafenib, a BRAF inhibitor agent, is one of the few available targeted therapies that is FDA approved and provides promising results in metastatic disease. However, its resistance at an early stage is of great concern. Recent implementation of combinational therapies including \"targeted therapy\", immunotherapy, and biological agents has appealed many researchers to define the adjunctive role of available therapies and their limitations in advanced stage and metastatic melanoma. This commends the need for future multi-institutional studies to confirm the clinical validity of different therapeutic strategies on a large scale population. ",

The development of innovative therapies with improved efficacy is critical to treatment of this disease. Here, we show that aberrant expression of two proteins, p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), is associated with poor patient survival. Using tissue microarray analysis, we found that patients exhibiting both weak PUMA expression and strong p-Akt expression in their melanoma tumor tissue had significantly worse 5-year survival than patients with either weak PUMA or strong p-Akt expression alone (P < 0.001). Strikingly, no patients exhibiting strong PUMA expression and weak p-Akt expression in primary tumor tissue died within 5 years of diagnosis. We propose a two-pronged therapeutic strategy of (a) boosting PUMA expression and (b) inhibiting Akt phosphorylation in melanoma tumor tissue. Here, we report that a recombinant adenovirus containing human PUMA cDNA (ad-PUMA) efficiently inhibits human melanoma cell survival in vitro, rapidly induces apoptosis, and dramatically suppresses human melanoma tumor growth in a severe combined immunodeficient mouse xenograft model. In melanoma cells strongly expressing p-Akt, we show that Akt/protein kinase B signaling inhibitor-2 (API-2; a small-molecule Akt inhibitor) reduces cell survival in a dose- and time-dependent manner and enhances ad-PUMA-mediated growth inhibition of melanoma cells. Finally, we show that, by combining ad-PUMA and API-2 treatments, human melanoma tumor growth can be inhibited by >80% in vivo compared with controls.

The present study aimed to investigate the signaling pathways that mediated GA-induced inhibition of human malignant skin melanoma proliferation.;The study was conducted using A375 cells and the corresponding tumor transplanted in nude mice.;Incubation of A375 cells with 1-10 Î¼g/ml GA decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis. GA concentration-dependently increased p66shc expression and intracellular ROS levels. GA also decreased the oxygen consumption rate and the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in A375 cells. Experimental inhibition of p66shc by siRNA suppressed GA-induced increase of ROS, decrease of oxygen consumption rate, MMP and cell viability, whilst suppressing GA-induced increase of apoptosis. GA concentration-dependently upregulated p53 and Bax expression in A375 cells. GA also increased p53-TA-luciferase activity and p53-binding to Bax promoter, which was inhibited by Sip53. Experimental inhibition of p53 with Sip53 blocked GA-induced decrease of the oxygen consumption rate and cell viability, and blocked the increase of apoptosis. In tumor-bearing nude mice, GA notably inhibited tumor growth, and this action was suppressed by N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a potent antioxidant, and by PFT-Î±, a p53 inhibitor. In A375 tumors transplanted in nude mice, GA increased both p66shc and p53 expression. NAC and PFT-Î± treatment did not significantly affect p66shc expression in tumors grown in mice treated with GA. In contrast, both NAC and PFT-Î± treatment inhibited GA-induced p53 expression in mouse tumors.;Results provided novel preclinical insights into the chemotherapeutic use of GA by highlighting the importance of p66shc/ROS-p53/Bax pathways in the antitumor effect of GA in malignant melanoma.",

Following a complete downregulation after birth, ROR1 was shown to re-express in various types of cancers. Little is known about ROR1 expression and function in melanoma. Here we show that ROR1 is aberrantly expressed in both melanoma cell lines and tumors and that its expression associates with poor Post-Recurrence Survival of melanoma. Using gain- and loss-of-function approaches we found that ROR1 enhances both anchorage-dependent and -independent growth of melanoma cells. In addition, ROR1 decreases cell adhesion and increases cell motility and migration. Mechanistically, ROR1 was found to induce upregulation of Akt and the mesenquimal markers N-cadherin and vimentin. The regulation of N-cadherin by ROR1 relies on both Akt dependent and independent mechanisms. ROR1 does not affect Wnt canonical pathway but was found to be engaged in a positive feedback loop with Wnt5a. In summary, we show that ROR1 contributes to melanoma progression and is a candidate biomarker of poor prognosis. Although further studies are needed to confirm this possibility, the present work indicates that ROR1 is a good prospective target for melanoma cancer therapy. Â© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Here, we have investigated anti-proliferative activity of myriocin, serine palmitoyltransferase inhibitor, in the de novo sphingolipid pathway, and its mechanism in B16F10 melanoma cells.;We assessed cell population growth by measuring cell numbers, DNA synthesis, cell cycle progression, and expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins. Ceramide, sphingomyelin, sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate levels were analysed by HPLC.;Myriocin inhibited proliferation of melanoma cells and induced cell cycle arrest in the G(2) /M phase. Expressions of cdc25C, cyclin B1 and cdc2 were decreased in the cells after exposure to myriocin, while expression of p53 and p21(waf1/cip1) was increased. Levels of ceramide, sphingomyelin, sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate in myriocin-treated cells after 24 h were reduced by approximately 86%, 57%, 75% and 38%, respectively, compared to levels in control cells.;Our results suggest that inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis by myriocin in melanoma cells may inhibit expression of cdc25C or activate expression of p53 and p21(waf1/cip1) , followed by inhibition of cyclin B1 and cdc2, resulting in G(2) /M arrest of the cell cycle and cell population growth inhibition. Thus, modulation of sphingolipid metabolism by myriocin may be a potential target of mechanism-based therapy for this type of skin cancer.",

We now investigated whether U0126, differentially regulates melanoma signaling in response to UV radiation or betulinic acid, a drug lethal against melanoma. This report shows that U0126 inhibits early response (ERK) kinase activation and cyclin A expression in wt p53 C8161 melanoma exposed to either UV radiation or betulinic acid. However, U0126 does not protect from UV damage, but counteracts betulinic acid-mediated apoptosis in the same cells. Protection from the latter drug by joint treatment with U0126 was also evident in wt p53 MelJuso melanoma and mutant p53 WM164 melanoma. The latter cells were the most responsive to betulinic acid, showing a selective decline in the cdk4 protein, without a comparable change in other key cell cycle proteins like cdc2, cdk2, cdk7 or cyclin A, prior to apoptosis-associated PARP fragmentation. Laser scanning cytometry also showed that betulinic acid induced a significant increase in chromatin condensation in WM164 melanoma irrespective of whether they were in adherent form or as multicellular spheroids. All these betulinic acid-induced changes were counteracted by U0126. Our data show for the first time that (a) cdk4 protein is an early target of betulinic acid-induced apoptosis and (b) unrestricted ERK signaling favours betulinic acid-induced apoptosis, but this is counteracted by U0126, partly through counteracting chromatin condensation and restoring Akt activation decreased by betulinic acid treatment.",

In melanoma, aberrant neuroblastoma-RAS (NRAS) signaling fuels tumor progression in about 20% of patients. Current therapeutics for NRAS-driven malignancies barely affect overall survival. To date, pathway interference downstream of mutant NRAS seems to be the most promising approach. In this study, data revealed that mutant NRAS induced Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) expression, and pharmacologic inhibition of Plk1 stabilized the size of NRAS mutant melanoma xenografts. The combination of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) and Plk1 inhibitors resulted in a significant growth reduction of NRAS mutant melanoma cells in vitro, and regression of xenografted NRAS mutant melanoma in vivo. Independent cell cycle arrest and increased induction of apoptosis underlies the synergistic effect of this combination. Data further suggest that the p53 signaling pathway is of key importance to the observed therapeutic efficacy. This study provides in vitro, in vivo, and first mechanistic data that an MEK/Plk1 inhibitor combination might be a promising treatment approach for patients with NRAS-driven melanoma. As mutant NRAS signaling is similar across different malignancies, this inhibitor combination could also offer a previously unreported treatment modality for NRAS mutant tumors of other cell origins.

Serum-deprived conditions enhance the cytotoxic effect of terfenadine and caspase-4 and -2 are activated upstream of caspase-9. Moreover, although we found an increase in ROS levels, the apoptosis was ROS independent. Conversely, terfenadine treatment in complete medium induced ROS-dependent apoptosis. Caspase-4, -2, and -9 were simultaneously activated and p73 and Noxa induction were involved. ROS inhibition prevented p73 and Noxa expression but not p53 and p21 expression, suggesting a role for Noxa in p53-independent apoptosis in melanoma cells. Finally, we found that terfenadine induced autophagy, that can promote apoptosis. These findings demonstrate the great potential of terfenadine to kill melanoma cells through different cellular signaling pathways and could contribute to define new therapeutic strategies in melanoma.",

We found a significant elevation of Plk1 immunostaining in melanoma tissues. Further, a second generation small molecule Plk1 inhibitor, BI 6727, resulted in reductions in growth, viability and clonogenic survival, as well as an increase in apoptosis of A375 and Hs 294T melanoma cells.

In a quest for alternative therapy targets, we had previously identified Signal Sequence Receptor 2 (SSR2) as a gene with high expression in a subgroup of human primary melanomas. Now we show that SSR2 exerts a prosurvival functionality in human melanoma cells and that high expression levels of SSR2 are associated with an unfavourable disease outcome in primary melanoma patients. Consistent with SSR's role in translocation of proteins from the ribosome across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, our data supports induction of SSR2 as a part of the ER stress response. This response included SSR2 upregulation upon development of therapy resistance to BRAF inhibitors, as well as the dependency of cell survival of BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma cells on SSR2. Complementary gain and loss of function data showed the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) to ER stress as an inducer of SSR2 via transcriptional regulation through X-Box Binding Protein 1s (XBP1s) and support an ER stress-UPR-Transcription Factor XBP1s-SSR2 response axis in human melanocytic cells. Together with its dispensability for survival in normal human cells, these data propose SSR2 as a potential therapeutic target in (therapy-resistant) human melanoma. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Cutaneous malignant melanoma, the most lethal of the skin cancers, known for its intractability to current therapies, continues to increase in incidence, providing a significant public health challenge. There is a consensus that skin cancer is initiated by sunlight exposure. For non-melanoma skin cancer there is substantial evidence that chronic exposure to the ultraviolet B radiation (UVB) (280-320 nm) portion of the sunlight spectrum is responsible. Experimentally, UVB is mutagenic and chronic UVB exposure can cause non-melanoma skin cancer in laboratory animals. Non-melanoma tumors in animals and in humans show characteristic UVB signature lesions in the tumor suppressor p53 and/or in the patched (PTCH) gene. An action spectrum or wavelength dependence for squamous cell carcinoma in the mouse shows a major peak of efficacy in the UVB. For malignant melanoma, however, the situation is unclear and the critical direct target(s) of sunlight in initiating melanoma and even the wavelengths responsible are as yet unidentified. This lack of information is in major part a result of a paucity of animal models for melanoma which recapitulate the role of sunlight in initiating this disease. The epidemiology of melanoma differs significantly from non-melanoma skin cancer. Intense sporadic sunlight exposure in childhood, probably exacerbated by additional adult exposure, is associated with elevated melanoma risk. Melanoma is also a disease of gene-environment interactions with underlying genetic factors playing a significant role. These major differences indicate that extrapolation from information for non-melanoma skin cancer to melanoma is unlikely to be useful. We summarize in this review the experimental information available on the role of UV radiation in melanoma and give an overview of animal melanoma models. A new model derived by neonatal UV irradiation of hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) transgenic mice is described which recapitulates the etiology, the histopathology and molecular pathogenesis of human disease. It is anticipated that the HGF/SF transgenic model will provide a means to access the mechanism(s) by which sunlight initiates this lethal disease and provide an appropriate vehicle for derivation of appropriate therapeutic and preventive strategies.",

We found that curcumin caused cell death in eight melanoma cell lines, four with wild-type and four with mutant p53. We demonstrate that curcumin-induced apoptosis is both dose- and time-dependent. We found that curcumin did not induce p53, suggesting that curcumin activates other apoptosis pathways. Our data show that curcumin activates caspases-3 and -8 but not caspase-9, supporting the rationale that apoptosis occurs via a membrane-mediated mechanism. Both a caspase-8 and broad-based caspase inhibitor, but not a caspase-9 specific inhibitor, suppressed curcumin-induced cell death. To further support our hypothesis that curcumin induces activation of a death receptor pathway, we show that curcumin induces Fas receptor aggregation in a FasL-independent manner and that low-temperature incubation, previously shown to inhibit receptor aggregation, prevented curcumin-induced cell death. Moreover, we demonstrate that expression of dominant negative FADD significantly inhibited curcumin-induced cell death. In addition, our results indicate that curcumin also blocks the NF-kappaB cell survival pathway and suppresses the apoptotic inhibitor, XIAP.

Pharmacological concentration of arsenic in combination with a widely known oxidant, menadione was explored in this study to synergistically sensitize malignant melanoma cells to apoptosis. The molecular mechanism of apoptosis and the signaling-pathways involved were thoroughly investigated. MATERIALS METHODS AND RESULTS: Menadione synergized NaAsO(2) to significantly increase ROS generation and facilitate the major apoptotic signaling events: alteration of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release and anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 down-regulation and subsequent activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 followed by poly-ADP-ribose polymerase-1 cleavage. Antioxidant N-acetyl-L: -cysteine antagonized these events. Investigation of the signaling-pathway revealed significant suppression of AP-1 activity but not NF-kappaB upon NaAsO(2) and menadione application. An increase in p38 phosphorylation and p53 protein expression did also dictate the apoptotic response. Suppression of p38 activation with SB203580 and inhibition of p53 expression by siRNA attenuated apoptosis. Transfection of p53, in p53 null HCT cells augmented the apoptotic events. Moreover, the treatment also led to tumor size reduction in BALB/c mice developed by intra-dermal B16 mouse melanoma cell injection; however, it had no detectable pro-proliferative or pro-apoptotic effect on non-tumor keratinocytes, normal fibroblasts or PBMC.;This study thus provides an insight into innovative mechanisms of melanoma sensitization, a proper cure against which is still elusive.

Our previous study showed that AT-II can inhibit B16 cells proliferation. Here we investigate the mechanistic basis for the anti-proliferative activity of AT-II in B16 melanoma cells.;Cell viability was examined by MTT assay. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were determined by flow cytometry. Protein expression was determined by Western blotting.;AT-II treatment for 48 h dose-dependently inhibited cell proliferation with an IC(50) of 82.3 Î¼M, and induced G1 phase cell cycle arrest. Moreover, treatment with 75 Î¼M AT-II induced apoptosis. These observations were associated with the decrease of the expression of Cdk2, phosphorylated-Akt, phosphorylated-ERK and Bcl-2, the increase of the expression of phosphorylated-p38, phosphorylated-p53, p21, p27, and activation of caspases-8, -9 and -3. In addition, a chemical inhibitor of p53, PFTÎ±, significantly decreased AT-II-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis.;We demonstrated that the G1-arresting and apoptotic effects of AT-II in B16 cells involve p38 activation as well as ERK and Akt inactivation, and the cytotoxic/apoptotic effects of AT-II are potentially p53 dependent. These findings provided chemical and pharmacological basis for the traditional application of Baizhu in melanoma treatment.",

The level of BiP/GRP78 is highly elevated in various human cancers. The purpose of this study is to examine the prognostic significance of BiP/GRP78 expression in patients with malignant melanoma. A total of 133 malignant melanoma patients were analyzed, and tumor specimens were stained by immunohistochemistry for BiP/GRP78, PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), Ki-67, p53 and microvessel density (MVD) determined by CD34. BiP/GRP78 and PERK were highly expressed in 40Â % (53/133) and 78Â % (104/133), respectively. BiP/GRP78 disclosed a significant relationship with PERK expression, thickness, T factor, N factor, disease staging, cell proliferation (Ki-67) and MVD (CD34). By multivariate analysis, the high expression of BiP/GRP78 was identified as an independent prognostic factor for predicting poor survival against malignant melanoma. The increased BiP/GRP78 expression was clarified as an independent prognostic marker for predicting worse outcome.

In this paper, we investigated the molecular changes induced by such a compound, underlying cell growth arrest and apoptosis in melanoma cells.;To shed light on the mechanisms of action of D6, we firstly demonstrated its quick cellular uptake and subsequent block of cell cycle in G2/M phase transition. A gene expression profile analysis of D6-treated melanoma cells and fibroblasts was then carried out on high density microarrays, to assess gene expression changes induced by this compound. The expression profile study evidenced both an induction of stress response pathways and a modulation of cell growth regulation mechanisms. In particular, our data suggest that the antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities of D6 in melanoma could be partially driven by up-regulation of the p53 signalling pathways as well as by down-regulation of the PI3K/Akt and NF-kB pathways. Modulation of gene expression due to D6 treatment was verified by western blot analysis for single proteins of interest, confirming the results from the gene expression profile analysis.;Our findings contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of action of D6, through a comprehensive description of the molecular changes induced by this compound at the gene expression level, in agreement with the previously reported anti-tumour effects on melanoma cells.",

Despite many advances in cancer treatment over the last several decades, the prognosis for patients with advanced melanoma remains poor. New treatment methods and strategies are necessary. The main hallmark of cancer is uncontrolled cellular proliferation with alterations in the expression of proteins. Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-related proteins posttranslationally modify proteins and thereby alter their functions. The ubiquitination process is involved in various physiological responses, including cell growth, cell death, and DNA damage repair. E3 ligases, the most specific enzymes of ubiquitination system, participate in the turnover of many key regulatory proteins and in the development of cancer. E3 ligases are of interest as drug targets for their ability to regulate proteins stability and functions. Compared to the general proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, which blocks the entire protein degradation, drugs that target a particular E3 ligase are expected to have better selectivity with less associated toxicity. Components of different E3 ligases complexes (FBW7, MDM2, RBX1/ROC1, RBX2/ROC2, cullins and many others) are known as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in melanomagenesis. These proteins participate in regulation of different cellular pathways and such important proteins in cancer development as p53 and Notch. In this review we summarized published data on the role of known E3 ligases in the development of melanoma and discuss the inhibitors of E3 ligases as a novel approach for the treatment of malignant melanomas.

The inhibition of osteoclasts' growth has been suggested as the main mechanism of the inhibitory effect of pamidronate on bone metastases. Recent findings indicated that bisphosphonates also have a direct apoptotic effect on other types of tumour cells. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates were shown to inhibit farnesyl diphosphate synthase, thus blocking the synthesis of higher isoprenoids. By this mechanism they inactivate monomeric G-proteins of the Ras and Rho families for which prenylation is a functional requirement. On the background of the known key role of G-proteins in tumorigenesis, we investigated a possible beneficial use of pamidronate in the treatment of malignant melanoma. Our results indicate that pamidronate inhibits the cell growth and induces apoptosis in human melanoma cells in vitro. Susceptibility to pamidronate did not correlate to CD95 ligand sensitivity or p53 mutational status. Furthermore it is interesting to note that overexpression of bcl-2 did not abolish pamidronate-induced apoptosis.

In the present study, we show that up-regulation of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 is another mechanism critical for protection of melanoma cells against ER stress-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of Mcl-1 by small interference RNA (siRNA) rendered melanoma cells sensitive to apoptosis induced by the ER stress inducers thapsigargin and tunicamycin, but this sensitization was partially reversed by siRNA knockdown of PUMA or Noxa, as shown in Mcl-1-deficient melanoma cells. Both PUMA and Noxa were increased by ER stress through transcriptional up-regulation, but only up-regulation of Noxa was dependent on p53, whereas up-regulation of PUMA seemed to be mediated by a p53-independent mechanism(s). Up-regulation of Mcl-1 was also due to increased transcription that involved the IRE1alpha and activating transcription factor 6 signaling pathways of the unfolded protein response. In addition, activation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway seemed to be necessary for optimal up-regulation of Mcl-1. Taken together, these results reveal the mechanisms of resistance of melanoma cells to apoptosis induction mediated by BH3-only proteins upon ER stress, and identify Mcl-1 as a target for the treatment of melanoma in combination with therapeutics that induce ER stress.",

In vivo analysis of B16-F10 allografts revealed a persistent inhibition of tumour growth rate when melanomas were treated with intra-tumoural injections of climacostol. In addition, it significantly improved the survival of transplanted mice, decreased tumour weight, induced a remarkable reduction of viable cells inside the tumour, activated apoptosis and up-regulated the p53 signalling network. Importantly, climacostol toxicity was more selective against tumour than non-tumour cells.

We have investigated the growth-inhibitory properties of this compound alone and in combination with ionizing radiation in a panel of established human melanoma cell lines as well as in normal human melanocytes. Betulinic acid strongly and consistently suppressed the growth and colony-forming ability of all human melanoma cell lines investigated. In combination with ionizing radiation the effect of betulinic acid on growth inhibition was additive in colony-forming assays. Betulinic acid also induced apoptosis in human melanoma cells as demonstrated by Annexin V binding and by the emergence of cells with apoptotic morphology. The growth-inhibitory action of betulinic acid was more pronounced in human melanoma cell lines than in normal human melanocytes. Notably, despite the induction of apoptosis, analysis of the expression of Bcl-2 family members in betulinic-acid-treated cells revealed that expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 was induced. Furthermore, the antiproliferative action of betulinic acid seemed to be independent of the p53 status. The properties of betulinic acid make it an interesting candidate, not only as a single agent but also in combination with radiotherapy.

Previously, we have demonstrated that SFN inhibits the metastasis of B16F-10 melanoma cells in both in vivo and in vitro models. Melanomas are among the aggressive tumor types because of their notorious resistance to treatment and their high tendency to metastasize. In this study, we investigated the influence of SFN on the induction of apoptosis in B16F-10 melanoma cells, which was evidenced by morphological changes such as membrane blebbing, presence of apoptotic bodies, DNA condensation, and also by nuclear DNA fragmentation. SFN-induced apoptosis was associated with the activation of caspases 3 and 9, Bax, and p53 and the downregulation of Bcl-2, caspase-8, Bid, and NF-kB. Caspase-3 is a most likely candidate to mediate SFN-induced apoptosis. In addition to the caspase-dependent pathway, our results also showed the involvement of proinflammatory cytokines, namely tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±), interleukin (IL)-1Î², IL-6, IL-12p40, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and the nuclear translocation of factors kappa B (NF-ÎºB) p65, NF-ÎºB p50, NF-ÎºB c-Rel, c-FOS, ATF-2, and CREB-1 in SFN-induced apoptosis. These results raise the possibility that SFN may be a promising candidate for molecular-targeting chemotherapy against melanoma.",

Oncostatin M (OSM) is the most active IL-6-type cytokine and inhibits the proliferation of various solid tumor cell lines. Multigene-based combination therapy may be an effective practice in cancer gene therapy. The therapeutic potential of a combination of IL-24 and OSM in treating cancers is still elusive. In this study, we aimed to examine the enhanced antitumor activity of adenovirus-mediated IL-24/OSM tumor suppressor gene cotransfer in human melanoma cells. We constructed an IL-24/OSM bicistronic adenovirus and assessed its combined effect on A375 human melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo by detecting and comparing apoptosis in the bicistronic antioncogene group (Ad-IL-24-OSM) and in the IL-24 or OSM single antioncogene group. We also investigated the possible mechanism underlying this effect. The bicistronic adenovirus-mediated coexpression of IL-24 and OSM induced additive growth suppression and apoptosis and an overlapping effect on the upregulation of p21, p53, Bax, and cleaved caspase-3 in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, Ad-IL-24-OSM treatment additively reduced the expression of CDK4 and cyclin D1 in A375 melanoma cells and the expression of CD34 and Cox-2 in A375 xenograft tumors in athymic nude mice. The enhanced antitumor activity elicited by Ad-IL-24-OSM was closely associated with the activation of the apoptotic pathway and the additive inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. Therefore, our results indicate that cancer gene therapy combining two or more tumor suppressors, such as IL-24 and OSM, may constitute a novel and effective therapeutic strategy for treating malignant melanoma and other cancers.

Presently, we attempted to identify potentially antitumor bioactive molecules using the whole cell surface as the recognizable static matrix. Such methodology could be advantageous in cancer therapy because it does not require previous characterization of target molecules. Using a C7C phage display library, we screened for peptides binding to the B16F10-Nex2 melanoma cell surface after pre-absorption on melan-A lineage. After a few rounds of enrichment, 50 phages were randomly selected, amplified, and tested for inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. Seven were active, and the corresponding peptide of each phage was chemically synthesized in the cyclic form and tested in vitro. Three peptides were able to preferentially inhibit the melanoma lineage. A unique peptide, [-CSSRTMHHC-], exhibited in vivo antitumor inhibitory activity against a subcutaneous melanoma challenge, rendering 60% of mice without tumor growth. Further, this peptide also markedly inhibited in vitro and in vivo the tumor cell invasion and cell-to-cell adhesiveness in vitro.

Inconsistent effects from growth stimulation to induction of apoptosis of malignant tumor cells, however, have been reported. Melanoma is an increasingly common and potentially lethal malignancy. It was reported that melanoma cells were more susceptible to ascorbate toxicity than any other tumor cells. The mechanisms accounting for ascorbate-induced apoptosis in human melanoma cells, however, have remained unclear. This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of sodium ascorbate on cytotoxicity and apoptosis in human malignant melanoma A375.S2 cells. A375.S2 cells were incubated with a certain range of concentrations of sodium ascorbate for various time periods. In order to examine the effects of sodium ascorbate on cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis and necrosis, we performed 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride assays and flow cytometry analysis. Polymerase chain reaction was used to examine the mRNA levels of p53, p21, p27, cyclin A, cyclin E, CDK2 and CDK4, which are associated with cell cycle S-phase arrest and apoptosis. Flow cytometric analysis showed that sodium ascorbate significantly induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in the A375.S2 cell line in a dose-dependent manner. The increased expressions of p53 and p21, and the decreased expressions of cyclin A, cyclin E, CDK2 and CDK4, indicated the cell cycle arrest at G1/S phase after the cells had been treated with sodium ascorbate. Induction of apoptosis involved an increase in the levels of p53, p21 and cellular Ca, and a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase 3 before culminating in apoptosis in sodium ascorbate-treated A375.S2 cells.",

A requisite component for improving gene-based therapies of brain cancer includes tumor suppressor genes that exhibit cancer constrained inhibitory activity. Subtraction hybridization identified melanoma differentiation associated gene-7 (mda-7) as a gene associated with melanoma cell growth, differentiation and progression. Ectopic expression of mda-7 by means of a replication-incompetent adenovirus (Ad), Ad.mda-7, induces growth suppression and apoptosis selectively in diverse human cancers, without producing any apparent harmful effect in normal cells. We presently demonstrate that Ad.mda-7 induces growth inhibition and apoptosis in malignant human gliomas expressing both mutant and wild-type p53, and these effects correlate with an elevation in expression of members of the growth arrest and DNA damage (GADD) gene family. In contrast, infection with a recombinant Ad expressing wild-type p53, Ad.wtp53, specifically affects mutant p53 expressing gliomas. When tested in early passage normal and immortal human fetal astrocytes, growth inhibition resulting from infection with Ad.mda-7 or Ad.wtp53 is significantly less than in malignant gliomas and no toxicity is evident in these normal cells. Moreover, infection of gliomas with Ad.mda-7 or treatment with purified GST-MDA-7 protein sensitizes both wild-type and mutant p53 expressing tumor cells to the growth inhibitory and antisurvival effects of ionizing radiation, and this response correlates with increased expression of specific members of the GADD gene family. Since heterogeneity in p53 expression is common in evolving gliomas, the present findings suggest that Ad.mda-7 may, in many instances, prove more beneficial for the gene-based therapy of malignant gliomas than administration of wild-type p53.",

This study aimed at investigating the efficacy of the other hybrid compound with four-carbon spacer (IN4CPBD) and elucidating its anti-metastatic mechanism. Human melanoma A375 cells with IN4CPBD treatment underwent cytotoxicity and apoptosis-associated assays. Transwell migration assay, Western blotting, and ELISA were used for mechanistic study. IN4CPBD exhibited potent melanoma cytotoxicity through interrupting G1/S cell cycle progression, increasing DNA fragmentation and hypodipoidic DNA contents, and reducing mitochondrial membrane potential. Caspase activity elevation suggested that both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways were involved in IN4CPBD-induced melanoma apoptosis. IN4CPBD up-regulated p53 and p21, thereby concomitantly derailing the equilibrium between Bcl-2 and Bax levels. Transwell migration assay demonstrated that stromal cell-derived factor-1Î± (SDF-1Î±) stimulated A375 cell motility, while kinase inhibitors treatment confirmed that Rho/ROCK, Akt, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK pathways were involved in SDF-1Î±-enhanced melanoma migration. IN4CPBD not only abolished the SDF-1Î±-enhanced chemotactic motility but also suppressed constitutive MMP-9 and VEGF expression. Mechanistically, IN4CPBD down-regulated Akt, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK total proteins and MYPT1 phosphorylation. In conclusion, beyond the fact that IN4CPBD induces melanoma cell apoptosis at cytotoxic dose, the interruption in the VEGF expression and the SDF-1Î±-related signaling at cytostatic dose may partially constitute the rationale for its in vivo anti-metastatic potency.",

The death ligand TRAIL appears as promising in cancer treatment; however, melanoma cells reveal both preexisting and inducible TRAIL resistance. Here, we present evidence that the recently described indirubin derivative 8-Rha-Î² enhances melanoma cell sensitivity for death ligands and overcomes resistance to TRAIL and CD95 agonists. Indirubin is known from traditional Chinese medicine and is a potent kinase inhibitor. Unraveling of apoptotic signaling pathways revealed that TRAIL resulted in a quick (within 8h) downregulation of both agonistic TRAIL receptors DR4 and DR5, in a kind of negative feed-back loop. Treatment with indirubin, however, mediated upregulation of both receptors, thus compensating this negative feed-back loop by TRAIL. Furthermore, indirubin activated intrinsic apoptosis pathways, seen in loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c. The mitochondrial response appeared as related to upregulation of Bax and Bad and to downregulation of Mcl-1. Remarkably, indirubin in combination with TRAIL was also able to overcome apoptosis resistance due to ectopic Bcl-2 overexpression. The tumor suppressor p53 appeared as master regulator of these propapoptotic changes and is the transactivator of proapoptotic proteins which was upregulated by indirubin. Taking into account the physiological role of death ligands in immune surveillance, sensitization of melanoma cells for death ligands may be supportive for an anti-tumor immune response. Furthermore, combinations with kinase inhibitors, such as indirubin 8-Rha-Î² may help for a breakthrough of TRAIL-mediated strategies in melanoma.",

Here, we employed an adenoviral vector where transgene expression is controlled by p53 to deliver the p19 alternate reading frame (Arf) and interferon-Î² (IFNÎ²) complementary DNAs in the B16 mouse model of melanoma. In vitro, cell death was enhanced by combined gene transfer (63.82Â±15.30% sub-G0 cells); yet introduction of a single gene resulted in significantly fewer hypoploid cells (37.73Â±7.3% or 36.96Â±11.58%, p19Arf or IFNÎ², respectively, P<0.05). Annexin V staining and caspase-3 cleavage indicate a cell death mechanism consistent with apoptosis. Using reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR, we show that key transcriptional targets of p53 were upregulated in the presence of p19Arf, although treatment with IFNÎ² did not alter expression of the genes studied. In situ gene therapy revealed significant inhibition of subcutaneous tumors by IFNÎ² (571Â±25â€‰mm3) or the combination of p19Arf and IFNÎ² (489Â±124â€‰mm3) as compared with the LacZ control (1875Â±33â€‰mm3, P<0.001), whereas p19Arf yielded an intermediate result (1053Â±169â€‰mm3, P<0.01 vs control).

Programmed cell death was preceded by a strong activation of the AP-1 complex in CD437-treated cells as demonstrated by gel retardation and chloramphenicol transferase (CAT) assays. Northern blot analysis showed a time-dependent increase in the expression of c-fos and c-jun encoding components of AP-1, whereas bcl-2 and p53 mRNA levels remained constant. CD437 also exhibited a strong growth inhibitory effect on MeWo melanoma cells in a xenograft model. In tissue sections of CD437-treated MeWo tumors from these animals, apoptotic melanoma cells and c-fos overexpressing cells were colocalized by TdT-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-digoxigenin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining and in situ hybridization. Taken together, this report identifies CD437 as a retinoid that activates and upregulates the transcription factor AP-1, leading eventually to programmed cell death of exposed human melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether synthetic retinoids such as CD437 represent a new class of retinoids, which may open up new ways to a more effective therapy of malignant melanoma.",

Its roles and underlying mechanisms on melanoma cell growth, however, are not fully clarified. To validate the potential of SPARC as a therapeutic target, we examined the effect of the knockdown of SPARC with SPARC-specific siRNA on the growth of human melanoma cell lines. SPARC siRNAs exerted a potent knockdown effect. Silencing of SPARC resulted in growth inhibition with G(1) arrest accompanied by accumulation of p21, a G(1) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, in MeWo and CRL1579 cells. Moreover, the induction of p53 was observed in MeWo cells, but not in CRL1579 cells. Conditioned media containing SPARC from MeWo cells could not restore the growth of SPARC-silenced MeWo cells. This result suggests that intracellular SPARC, but not secreted SPARC, is involved in cell proliferation. In addition, silencing of SPARC induced apoptosis in MeWo and CRL1579 cells. Furthermore, when MeWo cells in which SPARC expression was transiently knocked down by SPARC siRNA were implanted in nude mice, the tumor growth was suppressed.

In the present study, we demonstrated the ability of apoptosis-related protein (APR)-2 to trigger cell death via mechanism mediated by both endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress [as evidenced by the increase of intracellular Ca(2+) release, the activation of both, inositol-requiring enzyme 1Î± (IRE1Î±) and calpain and cleavage of caspase-4] and mitochondrial dysregulation as evidenced by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, Cytochrome c release and cleavage of caspases-9 and -3, and poly adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase (PARP). Also, the activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK) 1, c-jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the transcription factors AP-1 and p53, and the induction of Bax expression were noted in APR-2-expressing cells. Both immune fluorescence staining and western blotting revealed the localization of APR-2 at ER and Bax protein at both mitochondria and ER. However, data of inhibitory experiments demonstrated that APR-2-induced apoptosis of melanoma cells is mediated by three parallel pathways: one of them IRE1/tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2/ASK1/JNK/Cyt.c/caspase-9/caspase-3/PARP) seems to be mitochondrial dependent, whereas, the other two pathways namely calpain/caspase-4/caspase-9/caspase-3/PARP and protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase/ATF4/C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP)/Bim seem to be mitochondrial independent.

The bulk of this variation is stochastic and functionally neutral, with only a small minority representing \"drivers\" that contribute to the genesis and maintenance of tumors. Drivers are often directly or inversely correlated across tumors, reflecting the molecular and regulatory signaling pathways in which they operate. Here, a profile of genetic and epigenetic drivers in 110 human melanoma cell lines was generated and searched for non-random distribution patterns. Statistically significant mutual exclusivity was revealed among components of each of the p16(INK4A)-CDK4-RB, RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways. In addition, an inverse correlation was observed between promoter hypermethylation of retinoic acid receptor Î² (RARB) and CDKN2A alterations affecting p14(ARF) (P < 0.0001), suggesting a functional link between RARÎ² signaling and the melanoma-suppressive activities of p14(ARF). Mechanistically, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment increased the expression of p14(ARF) in primary human melanocytes and the steady-state levels of p14(ARF) in these cells were shown to be regulated via RARÎ². Furthermore, the ability of ATRA to induce senescence is reduced in p14(ARF)-depleted melanocytes, and we provide proof-of-concept that ATRA can induce irreversible growth arrest in melanoma cells with an intact RARÎ²-p14(ARF) signaling axis, independent of p16(INK4A) and p53 status.;These data highlight the power of mutual exclusivity analysis of cancer drivers to unravel molecular pathways and establish a previously unrecognized cross-talk between RARÎ² and p14(ARF) with potential implications for melanoma treatment.",

Melanomas from both groups of bigenic RXRÎ±(ep-/-) mice are larger in size with higher proliferative capacity, and exhibit enhanced angiogenic properties and increased expression of malignant melanoma markers. Analysis of tumor adjacent normal skin from these mice revealed altered expression of several biomarkers indicative of enhanced melanoma susceptibility, including reduced expression of tumor suppressor p53 and loss of PTEN, with concomitant increase in activated AKT. Loss of epidermal RXRÎ± in combination with UVB significantly enhances invasion of melanocytic cells to draining lymph nodes in bigenic mice expressing oncogenic NRAS(Q61K) compared with controls with functional RXRÎ±.

Melanoma shows weak response to TRAIL because of its low level of TRAIL death receptors. Here, we investigated whether indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, can potentiate TRAIL-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells. We showed that indomethacin was capable of promoting TRAIL-induced cell death and apoptosis in A375 melanoma cells. Mechanistically, indomethacin induced cell surface expression of death receptor 5 (DR5) in melanoma cells and also in various types of cancer cells. DR5 knockdown abolished the enhancing effect of indomethacin on TRAIL responses. Induction of the DR5 by indomethacin was found to be p53 independent but dependent on the induction of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP). Knockdown of CHOP abolished indomethacin-induced DR5 expression and the associated potentiation of TRAIL-mediated cell death. In addition, indomethacin-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production preceded upregulation of CHOP and DR5, and consequent sensitization of cells to TRAIL. We also found that indomethacin treatment downregulated survivin via ROS and the NF-ÎºB-mediated signaling pathways. Interestingly, indomethacin also converted TRAIL-resistant melanoma MeWo and SK-MEL-5 cells into TRAIL-sensitive cells.

Recently, we showed that up-regulation of this gene by the histone deacetylase inhibitor MS-275 was responsible for sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis through c-FLIP repression in melanoma. The present study aimed at investigating whether, in addition to inducing H3 hyperacetylation at the c-myc promoter, MS-275 could enhance cell death through the regulation of miRNAs involved in apoptosis, such as the miR-17-92 cluster. Following MS-275 treatment, a decrease in miR-92a-3p was observed either in TRAIL-resistant or TRAIL-sensitive cutaneous and uveal melanoma cells. Prediction tools revealed that miR-92a-3p targeted MYCBP2. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments showed that the 3'-UTR of MYCBP2 mRNA was the target of miR-92a-3p, as ectopic expression of miR-92a-3p resulted in MYCBP2 downregulation whereas miR-92a-3p knockdown markedly increased the expression of MYCBP2. Silencing of MYCBP2 counteracted the pro-apoptotic effects exerted by the down-regulation of miR-92a-3p and prevented c-myc-induced repression of c-FLIP, indicating a pivotal role of MYCBP2 as a mediator of miR-92a-3p and c-myc function. Together, our findings indicate that the MS-275-triggered downregulation of the oncogenic miR-92a-3p- which leads to the overexpression of its target gene MYCBP2 - is an event required for the enhanced susceptibility of melanoma cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.

Focused gene expression array analysis followed by immunoblot detection revealed that DP rapidly activates the cytotoxic unfolded protein response (UPR; involving phospho-PERK, phospho-eIF2Î±, Grp78, CHOP, and Hsp70) and the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis with p53 upregulation and modulation of Bcl-2 family members (involving Noxa, Mcl-1, and Bcl-2).

SiRNA-based antagonism of PMAIP1 expression blocked DP-induced upregulation of the proapoptotic BH3-only effector Noxa and prevented downregulation of the Noxa-antagonist Mcl-1, rescuing melanoma cells from DP-induced apoptosis. Intraperitoneal administration of DP displayed significant antimelanoma activity in a murine A375 xenograft model. It remains to be seen if melanoma cell-directed induction of UPR and apoptosis using DP or improved DP-derivatives can be harnessed for future chemotherapeutic intervention.",

In the case of cultured human melanoma cells, no one to our knowledge has investigated whether resveratrol exerts similar anti-proliferative activities in cells with different metastatic potential. Therefore, we examined the effects of this polyphenol on the growth of weakly metastatic Line IV clone 3 and on autologous, highly metastatic Line IV clone 1 cultured melanoma cells. Comparable inhibition of growth and colony formation resulted from treatment by resveratrol in both cell lines. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that resveratrol-treated clone 1 cells had a dose-dependent increase in S phase and a concomitant reduction in the G(1) phase. No detectable change in cell cycle phase distribution was found in similarly treated clone 3 cells. Western blots demonstrated a significant increase in the expression of the tumor suppressor gene p53, without a commensurate change in p21 and several other cell cycle regulatory proteins in both cell types. Chromatography of Line IV clone 3 and clone 1 cell extracts on resveratrol affinity columns revealed that the basal expression of dihydronicotinamide riboside quinone reductase 2 (NQO2) was higher in Line IV clone 1 than clone 3 cells. Levels of NQO2 but not its structural analog NQO1 were dose-dependently increased by resveratrol in both cell lines. We propose that induction of NQO2 may relate to the observed increased expression of p53 that, in turn, contributes to the observed suppression of cell growth in both melanoma cell lines.",

We propose a strategy for melanoma prevention based on using analogs of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) that function as melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) agonists. Treatment of human melanocytes with alpha-MSH results in stimulation of eumelanin synthesis, reduction of apoptosis that is attributable to reduced hydrogen peroxide generation and enhanced repair of DNA photoproducts. These effects should contribute to genomic stability of human melanocytes, thus preventing their malignant transformation to melanoma. Based on these findings, we synthesized and tested the effects of 3 tetrapeptide alpha-MSH analogs, Ac-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-NH2, n-Pentadecanoyl- and 4-Phenylbutyryl-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-NH2, on cultured human melanocytes. The latter two analogs were more potent than the former, or alpha-MSH, in stimulating the activity of tyrosinase, thus melanogenesis, reducing apoptosis and release of hydrogen peroxide and enhancing repair of DNA photoproducts in melanocytes exposed to UV radiation (UVR). The above analogs are MC1R agonists, as their effects were abrogated by an analog of agouti signaling protein, the physiological MC1R antagonist, and were absent in melanocytes expressing loss-of-function MC1R. Analogs, such as 4-Phenylbutyryl-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-NH2 with prolonged and reversible effects, can potentially be developed into topical agents to prevent skin photocarcinogenesis, particularly melanoma.",

In dermatology, such mutations have been identified in melanoma, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. These have partly led to the establishment of new, targeted therapies. Treatment successes have been particularly impressive for melanoma with small molecule inhibitors directed against the mutated BRAF oncogene and in basal cell carcinoma with inhibitors directed against the hedgehog signaling pathway. New sequencing technologies, in particular next generation sequencing, have led to a better and more comprehensive understanding of malignant tumors. This approach confirmed the pathogenic role of BRAF, NRAS and MAP kinase pathways for melanoma. At the same time, a series of further interesting target molecules with oncogenic mutations such as ERBB4, GRIN2A, GRM3, PREX2, RAC1 and TP53 were identified. New aspects have recently been shown for squamous cell carcinoma by detection of mutations in the NOTCH signaling pathway.

To gain an understanding of its mechanism of action, the effects of ipilimumab on T-cell populations and on humoral immune responses were studied in patients with advanced melanoma from 2 phase II trials. Antibody levels against 5 tumor antigens were assessed at baseline and up to 12 weeks after ipilimumab treatment. Serologic reactivity to the cancer-testis antigen NY-ESO-1 increased by at least 5-fold at week 12 of treatment in 10% to 13% of patients. Increased antibody levels were also observed to the tumor antigens Melan-A, MAGE-A4, SSX2, and p53. Immunocompetence was evaluated with tetanus boosters administered before ipilimumab and pneumococcal and influenza vaccines given 5 days after ipilimumab treatment. At week 7, most patients who received ipilimumab and vaccine showed greater humoral responses relative to baseline titers. For peripheral T-cell populations, statistically significant increases in the percent of activated (HLA-DR) CD4 and CD8 T cells with concomitant decreases in naive CD4 and CD8 T cells were observed after ipilimumab treatment. These changes were evident by week 4 of treatment. Increases were also observed in central memory, effector memory, and activated ICOS CD4 T cells, but not in ICOS CD8 T cells or in FoxP3 CD4 regulatory T cells.

To develop T-oligo as an innovative, effective therapeutic drug and to understand its mechanism of action, we investigated the antitumor effects of T-oligo or T-oligo complexed with a novel cationic alpha helical peptide, PVBLG-8 (PVBLG), in a p53 null melanoma cell line both in vitro and in vivo. The uptake of T-oligo by MM-AN cells was confirmed by immunofluorescence, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis indicated that the T-oligo-PVBLG nanocomplex increased uptake by 15-fold. In vitro results showed a 3-fold increase in MM-AN cell growth inhibition by the T-oligo-PVBLG nanocomplex compared with T-oligo alone. Treatment of preformed tumors in immunodeficient mice with the T-oligo-PVBLG nanocomplex resulted in a 3-fold reduction in tumor volume compared with T-oligo alone. This reduction in tumor volume was associated with decreased vascular endothelial growth factor expression and induction of thrombospondin-1 expression and apoptosis. Moreover, T-oligo treatment downregulated procaspase-3 and procaspase-7 and increased catalytic activity of caspase-3 by 4-fold in MM-AN cells. Furthermore, T-oligo induced a 10-fold increase of senescence and upregulated the melanoma tumor-associated antigens MART-1, tyrosinase, and thrombospondin-1 in MM-AN cells, which are currently being targeted for melanoma immunotherapy. Interestingly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of p73 (4-10-fold) abolished this upregulation of tumor-associated antigens. In summary, we suggest a key role of p73 in mediating the anticancer effects of T-oligo and introduce a novel nanoparticle, the T-oligo-PVBLG nanocomplex, as an effective anticancer therapeutic. ",

We found that statins significantly inhibited spontaneous metastasis and tumor growth. Statins inhibited the mRNA expression and enzymatic activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in vivo and also suppressed the mRNA and protein expression of very late antigens (VLAs). Moreover, statins inhibited the prenylation of Rho as well as the phosphorylation of LIM kinase, serum response factor (SRF), and c-Fos downstream of the Rho signaling pathway. In addition, statins enhanced p53, p21, and p27 expression and reduced phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinase and expression of cyclin D1 and E2.

Here we report that PHGDH, the key metabolic enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the serine biosynthesis pathway, is a target of p53 in human melanoma cells. p53 suppresses PHGDH expression and inhibits de novo serine biosynthesis. Notably, upon serine starvation, p53-mediated cell death is enhanced dramatically in response to Nutlin-3 treatment. Moreover, PHGDH has been found recently to be amplified frequently in human melanomas. We found that PHGDH overexpression significantly suppresses the apoptotic response, whereas RNAi-mediated knockdown of endogenous PHGDH promotes apoptosis under the same treatment. These results demonstrate an important role of p53 in regulating the serine biosynthesis pathway through suppressing PHGDH expression and reveal serine deprivation as a novel approach to sensitize p53-mediated apoptotic responses in human melanoma cells.

Mutations in BRAF have led to clinical use of BRAF-inhibitors in advanced melanoma, and mutations in Hedgehog signaling to smoothened inhibitors in basal cell carcinoma. The development of tumor resistance to these treatments is leading to many new drug development initiatives and the exploration of multiple signalling pathways. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma continues to rise steeply in incidence with very limited therapeutic options for locally advanced or metastatic disease. New genetic technologies find significant levels of mutation in Notch gene family as well as other already recognized gene mutations, such as TP53. The mutational burden in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is massive, challenging the identification of driver genes and inhibiting translation from genomics to the clinic. Clinical experience with targeted therapies, such as epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, or immune modulatory drugs suggests that these agents may be of benefit to patients, while a more complete understanding of the mechanisms behind squamous cell carcinogenesis awaits further progress.

RA treatment resulted in an increase of p21, p27 and p53 protein levels and G1 arrest in UM cells, which correlated with significant down-modulation of surface Her2/neu proto-oncogene expression. In addition, RA-treated UM cells exhibited increased sensitivity to both MHC class I-restricted killing by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and NK cell-mediated lysis that were accompanied by more efficient conjugate formation between UM cells and killer lymphocytes.

A375 cells were treated with kojic acid at 8 microg/mL for 24, 48, and 72 h. With the use of 2-D PAGE and MALDI-Q-TOF MS and MS/MS analyses, proteomic profiles of A375 cells between control and kojic acid treatment were compared, and 30 differentially expressed proteins, containing 2 up-regulated proteins and 28 down-regulated proteins, were identified. Among these proteins, 17 isoforms of 5 identical proteins were observed and 11 chaperone proteins showed the high proportion of protein spots with 36.7% of total proteins. Bioinformatic tools were used to search for protein function and prediction of protein interaction. Sixteen differentially expressed proteins exhibited interaction network linked to the downstream regulations of p53 tumor suppressor and cell apoptosis, which may lead to suppress the melanogenesis and tumorigenesis of kojic acid treated A375 cells. In addition, GRP75, VIME and 2AAA were validated by Western blot analysis, whereas GRP75, 2AAA, HS90B, ENPL and KPYM were validated by RT-PCR.

In all cases, including TMZ-resistant cells, PHA-848125 IC(50) values were significantly below the maximum plasma concentrations achievable in the clinic. In the most PHA-848125-sensitive cell line, the drug caused a concentration-dependent G(1) arrest. PHA-848125 also impaired phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein at CDK2 and CDK4 specific sites, decreased retinoblastoma protein and cyclin A levels, and increased p21(Cip1), p27(Kip1) and p53 expression. Combined treatment with fixed ratios of TMZ plus PHA-848125 was studied in three melanoma cell lines. PHA-848125 was added to the cells 48 h after TMZ and cell growth was evaluated after 3 additional days of culture. Parallel experiments were performed in the presence of O(6)-benzylguanine (BG), to prevent repair of methyl adducts at O(6)-guanine induced by TMZ. Drug combination of TMZ plus BG and PHA-848125 produced additive or synergistic effects on cell growth, depending on the cell line. In the absence of BG, the combination was still more active than the single agents in the cell line moderately sensitive to TMZ, but comparable to PHA-848125 alone in the two TMZ-resistant cell lines. When TMZ plus BG were used in combination with PHA-848125 against cultured normal melanocytes, neither synergistic nor additive antiproliferative effects were observed.

In this study, the cell cycle dependence of p53 accumulation and pRb hypophosphorylation in four human melanoma cell lines that are wild type for p53 was investigated using two-parameter flow cytometry measurements of p53 or pRb protein content and DNA content. The hypoxia-induced increase in p53 protein was higher in S-phase than in G1 and G2 phases in all cell lines. The accumulation of p53 in S-phase during hypoxia was not related to hypoxia-induced apoptosis or substantial cell cycle specific cell inactivation during the first 24 h of reoxygenation. pRb was hypophosphorylated in all cell cycle phases by hypoxia treatment. The results did not support a direct link between p53 and pRb during hypoxia because p53 was induced in a cell cycle-specific manner, whereas no cell cycle-dependent differences in pRb hypophosphorylation were detected. Only a fraction of the cell populations (0.60+/-0.10) showed hypophosphorylated pRb. Thus, pRb is probably not the only mediator of the hypoxia-induced cell cycle block seen in all cells and all cell cycle phases.

The present study aims to investigate the anti-cancer effect of Centratherum anthelminticum (L.) seeds chloroform fraction (CACF) on human melanoma cells and to elucidate the molecular mechanism involved.;A chloroform fraction was extracted from C. anthelminticum (CACF). Bioactive compounds of the CACF were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Human melanoma cell line A375 was treated with CACF in vitro. Effects of CACF on growth inhibition, morphology, stress and survival of the cell were examined with MTT, high content screening (HSC) array scan and flow cytometry analyses. Involvement of intrinsic or extrinsic pathways in the CACF-induced A375 cell death mechanism was examined using a caspase luminescence assay. The results were further verified with different caspase inhibitors. In addition, Western blot analysis was performed to elucidate the changes in apoptosis-associated molecules. Finally, the effect of CACF on the NF-ÎºB nuclear translocation ability was assayed.;The MTT assay showed that CACF dose-dependently inhibited cell growth of A375, while exerted less cytotoxic effect on normal primary epithelial melanocytes. We demonstrated that CACF induced cell growth inhibition through apoptosis, as evidenced by cell shrinkage, increased annexin V staining and formation of membrane blebs. CACF treatment also resulted in higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and lower Bcl-2 expression, leading to decrease mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Disruption of the MMP facilitated the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, which activates caspase-9 and downstream caspase-3/7, resulting in DNA fragmentation and up-regulation of p53 in melanoma cells. Moreover, CACF prevented TNF-Î±-induced NF-ÎºB nuclear translocation, which further committed A375 cells toward apoptosis.;Together, our findings suggest CACF as a potential therapeutic agent against human melanoma malignancy.",

Aberrant expression of class I MAGE proteins occurs in melanomas and many other malignancies, and MAGE proteins have long been recognized as tumor-specific targets; however, their functions have largely been unknown. Here, we show that suppression of class I MAGE proteins induces apoptosis in the Hs-294T, A375, and S91 MAGE-positive melanoma cell lines and that members of all three families of MAGE class I proteins form complexes with KAP1, a scaffolding protein that is known as a corepressor of p53 expression and function. In addition to inducing apoptosis, MAGE suppression decreases KAP1 complexing with p53, increases immunoreactive and acetylated p53, and activates a p53 responsive reporter gene. Suppression of class I MAGE proteins also induces apoptosis in MAGE-A-positive, p53wt/wt parental HCT 116 colon cancer cells but not in a MAGE-A-positive HCT 116 p53-/- variant, indicating that MAGE suppression of apoptosis requires p53. Finally, treatment with MAGE-specific small interfering RNA suppresses S91 melanoma growth in vivo, in syngenic DBA2 mice. Thus, class I MAGE protein expression may suppress apoptosis by suppressing p53 and may actively contribute to the development of malignancies and by promoting tumor survival. Because the expression of class I MAGE proteins is limited in normal tissues, inhibition of MAGE antigen expression or function represents a novel and specific treatment for melanoma and diverse malignancies.",

In this study, we investigated the potential therapeutic effects of the mitotic inhibitor paclitaxel on three melanoma cell lines with differing sensitivity to the BRAF inhibitor. Of the two BRAF inhibitor-resistant cell lines, A375P/Mdr cells harboring the BRAF V600E mutant were resistant and the wild-type BRAF SK-MEL-2 cells were sensitive to paclitaxel. In particular, paclitaxel caused the growth inhibition of SK-MEL-2 cells to a much greater extent than it caused growth inhibition of A375P cells. Paclitaxel exhibited no significant effect on the phosphorylation of MEK-ERK in any cell lines tested, regardless of both the BRAF mutation and the drug resistance, implying that paclitaxel activity is independent of MEK-ERK inhibition. In A375P cells, paclitaxel treatment resulted in a marked emergence of apoptotic cells after mitotic arrest, concomitant with a remarkable induction of p21(Cip1). However, paclitaxel only moderately increased the levels of p21(Cip1) in A375P/Mdr cells, which exhibited a strong resistance to paclitaxel. The p21(Cip1) overexpression partially conferred paclitaxel sensitivity to A375P/Mdr cells. Interestingly, we found an extremely low background expression level of p21(Cip1) in SK-MEL-2 cells lacking normal p53 function, which caused much greater G2/M arrest than that seen in A375P cells. Taken together, these results suggest that paclitaxel may be an effective anticancer agent through regulating the expression of p21(Cip1) for the treatment of BRAF mutant melanoma cells resistant to BRAF inhibitors.

The combination of recombinant human fibroblast interferon (IFN-beta) and the antileukemic compound mezerein (MEZ) results in an irreversible loss of proliferative capacity and terminal cell differentiation in H0-1 human melanoma cells. In contrast, either agent alone induces reversible growth arrest and/or specific components of the differentiation process without inducing terminal differentiation. The current study investigates changes in cell cycle, cell cycle gene expression and E2F transcription factor complex formation during the processes of reversible and irreversible (terminal) differentiation. Induction of both terminal differentiation and reversible differentiation (MEZ treatment) results in a temporal decrease in DNA synthesis and the percentage of cells in S phase and a decrease in the expression of cell cycle and growth regulated genes, including cdc2, cyclin A, cyclin B, histone H1, histone H4, nm23-H1, p53 and c-myc. Persistent gene expression changes occur in terminally differentiated cells, but not in reversibly differentiated cells. H0-1 cells contain several E2F binding activities, including uncomplexed E2F, an E2F-p107-cyclin A-cdk2 kinase complex and an Rb-E2F complex. Induction of growth arrest by MEZ results in a slow migrating gelshift band that contains E2F associated with the pRb2/p130 protein. There is also a loss of the Rb-E2F complex. Induction of terminal differentiation after treatment with IFN-beta + MEZ generates a second pRb2/p130-E2F complex that migrates considerably faster than the pRb2/p130-E2F complex resulting from growth arrest. The slower migrating complex may contribute to growth arrest, whereas the faster migrating complex may play a role in terminal differentiation. Our results demonstrate that terminal cell differentiation involves a co-ordinate and continuous suppression of a number of cell cycle and growth related genes and results in the development of a novel E2F transcription factor complex not apparent in growth arrested and reversibly differentiated human melanoma cells.",

Nitroprusside releases nitric oxide (NO) when intact, or acts in a NO-independent manner via iron and residual cyanide after light exposure (lex-SNP). When tested at 300 microM in 72 h treatments by cytometric live-dead assays, intact SNP caused a 50% lethality versus a 30% lethality induced by lex-SNP. No protection from SNP toxicity was seen when inhibiting the PI3-kinase pathway with LY294002 or c-Jun NH(2) kinase signaling with SP600125. However, pretreatment with UO126 protected from SNP-mediated cell death including counteracting apoptosis-associated Bax expression and PARP cleavage, plus reversing loss of Cu,Zn-SOD. Moreover, addition of exogenous SOD also protected cells from SNP toxicity. In spite of the greater earlier effects of intact SNP, cells treated with single doses of either intact or lex-SNP, revealed about a 90% mortality in longer 120 h treatments, and these were also counteracted by UO126 or exogenous SOD.

By contrast, the incidence of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the other major keratinocyte-derived tumour of the skin, of melanoma and of internal malignancies increases to a significantly lesser extent. Here we report that genetic and pharmacological suppression of calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) function promotes tumour formation in mouse skin and in xenografts, in immune compromised mice, of H-ras(V12) (also known as Hras1)-expressing primary human keratinocytes or keratinocyte-derived SCC cells. Calcineurin/NFAT inhibition counteracts p53 (also known as TRP53)-dependent cancer cell senescence, thereby increasing tumorigenic potential. ATF3, a member of the 'enlarged' AP-1 family, is selectively induced by calcineurin/NFAT inhibition, both under experimental conditions and in clinically occurring tumours, and increased ATF3 expression accounts for suppression of p53-dependent senescence and enhanced tumorigenic potential. Thus, intact calcineurin/NFAT signalling is critically required for p53 and senescence-associated mechanisms that protect against skin squamous cancer development.",

In the present study, we aims to investigate the anti-skin cancer activity of casticin on melanoma cells in vitro and the antitumor effect of casticin on human melanoma xenografts in nu/nu mice in vivo. A flow cytometric assay was performed to detect expression of viable cells, cell cycles, reactive oxygen species production, levels of [Formula: see text] and caspase activity. A Western blotting assay and confocal laser microscope examination were performed to detect expression of protein levels. In the in vitro studies, we found that casticin induced morphological cell changes and DNA condensation and damage, decreased the total viable cells, and induced G2/M phase arrest. Casticin promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, decreased the level of [Formula: see text], and promoted caspase-3 activities in A375.S2 cells. The induced G2/M phase arrest indicated by the Western blotting assay showed that casticin promoted the expression of p53, p21 and CHK-1 proteins and inhibited the protein levels of Cdc25c, CDK-1, Cyclin A and B. The casticin-induced apoptosis indicated that casticin promoted pro-apoptotic proteins but inhibited anti-apoptotic proteins. These findings also were confirmed by the fact that casticin promoted the release of AIF and Endo G from mitochondria to cytosol. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) assay showed that casticin inhibited the NF-[Formula: see text]B binding DNA and that these effects were time-dependent. In the in vivo studies, results from immuno-deficient nu/nu mice bearing the A375.S2 tumor xenograft indicated that casticin significantly suppressed tumor growth based on tumor size and weight decreases. Early G2/M arrest and mitochondria-dependent signaling contributed to the apoptotic A375.S2 cell demise induced by casticin. In in vivo experiments, A375.S2 also efficaciously suppressed tumor volume in a xenotransplantation model.

We report the use of a purified bacterial redox protein, azurin, that enters human cancer (melanoma UISO-Mel-2) cells and induces apoptosis. The induction of apoptosis occurs readily in melanoma cells harboring a functional tumor suppressor protein p53, but much less efficiently in p53-null mutant melanoma (UISO-Mel-6) cells. A redox-negative mutant form of azurin (M44K/M64E) demonstrates much less cytotoxicity to the UISO-Mel-2 cells than the wild-type protein. Azurin has been shown to be internalized in UISO-Mel-2 cells and is localized predominantly in the cytosol and in the nuclear fraction. In the p53-null UISO-Mel-6 cells, azurin is localized only in the cytosol. Thus, intracellular trafficking of azurin to the nucleus is p53-dependent. Azurin forms a complex with p53, thereby stabilizing it and raising its intracellular level in cytosolic, mitochondrial, and nuclear fractions. Corresponding to an increasing level of p53, an inducer of apoptosis, the level of Bax also increases in mitochondria, allowing significant release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol, thus initiating the onset of apoptosis. The M44K/M64E mutant form of azurin, deficient in cytotoxicity, is also deficient in forming a complex with p53 and is less efficient in stabilizing p53 than wild-type azurin. Azurin has been shown to allow regression of human UISO-Mel-2 tumors xenotransplanted in nude mice and may potentially be used in cancer treatment.",

As a previous study indicated that ROS was stimulated in evodiamine-induced human melanoma A375-S2 cell apoptosis, the goal of this study was to investigate the role of NO in the cells. In this study, it was found that evodiamine has a strong inductive effect on NO production synthesized by inducible NOS (iNOS) enzyme in a positive-feedback manner. The generated NO was further showed to induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest and linked to the activation of p53 and p21. After interruption of p38 and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) by pre-treatment with SB203580 and PDTC, iNOS expression, NO synthesis and cell damage were all significantly blocked.

Since transition metal complexes including those of Ru(III), show important anticancer activity with limited toxicity, we investigated the potential antitumor efficacy of Ru(II) complexed to KTZ or clotrimazole (CTZ) compared to Ru(II) alone or uncomplexed azoles. RuCl2(KTZ)2 exerted greater apoptosis- associated caspase-3 activation than RuCl2(CTZ)2, KTZ, CTZ or RuCl2(MeCN)4 against several human tumor cell monolayers. PARP cleavage and a decrease in S+G2 cells were evident after RuCl2(KTZ)2 treatment in genetically matched C8161 melanoma monolayers with unequal p53 functional status. Release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and Mn-SOD suggest mitochondria as a target of RuCl2(KTZ)2. Treatment of WM164 melanoma monolayers with 25 microM of cisplatin or RuCl2(KTZ)2 showed that the latter is more effective than cisplatin at inducing PARP fragmentation and proapoptotic Bak expression. Such results suggest that these Ru(II) and Pt(II) metal complexes are unequally effective and act through alternative signaling pathways. In studies with multicellular spheroids, which frequently are more resistant to cytotoxic anticancer drugs than monolayers, those from wt p53 C8161 melanoma underwent PARP fragmentation in response to RuCl2(KTZ)2. In contrast, spheroids of mut p53 A431 carcinoma overexpressing EGF receptor were resistant to either RuCl2(KTZ)2 or anti-EGF receptor C225 MAb. However, joint treatment with both agents restored growth arrest and apoptosis in these spheroids. In contrast to the antitumor action of cisplatin, which is known to be hampered by p53 dysfunction, we show that RuCl2(KTZ)2 is active irrespective of p53 functional status against several adherent tumor cells and synergizes with anti-EGF receptor C225 MAb to kill tumor spheroids resistant to either agent.",

MDM2, encoded by a p53-activated gene, acts as a negative-feedback regulator of p53 by promoting p53 degradation. Moreover, MDM2 inhibits p53 by binding to and concealing its N-terminal transcription-activating domain. p53 can be activated by nutlin-3a, a molecule designed to bind MDM2 and prevent its interaction with p53. Actinomycin D promotes phosphorylation and accumulation of p53 via a mechanism that involves high expression of MDM2. We hypothesized that co-treatment of cells with actinomycin D and nutlin-3a would lead to synergistic activation of p53 by stimulating kinases and preventing accumulated MDM2 from binding to p53. Indeed, co-treatment of various cell lines with actinomycin D and nutlin-3a resulted in a synergistic increase of p53 phosphorylation on serine 46. We focused on this residue because it is a marker of the highest level of p53 activation. Co-treatment was associated with conspicuous decrease in a marker of mTOR activity in NCI-H28 cells and very strong activation of p53 targets, including CDKN1A and PML, in A549 cells. Other p53 target genes (SESN1, SESN2, TIGAR, DRAM1) were also efficiently upregulated; however, a marker of apoptosis (active caspase-3) appeared only in some cancer cell lines (e.g., A375 and other cell lines derived from melanoma) indicating that phosphorylation of p53 on serine 46 is not straightforwardly associated with induction of apoptosis. Moreover, our data suggest that melanoma may be a suitable target for drug combination used in this study. ",

Once senescence is overcome, the nevus can exhibit dysplastic features and readily progress to more lethal stages. Recent advances have convincingly demonstrated that senescence represents a true barrier to the progression of many types of cancer, including melanoma. Thus, understanding the mechanism(s) by which melanoma evades senescence has become a priority in the melanoma research community. Senescence in most cells is regulated through some combination of activities within the RB and p53 pathways. However, differences discovered among various tumor types, some subtle and others quite profound, have revealed that senescence frequently operates in a context-dependent manner. Here we review what is known about melanocyte senescence, and how such knowledge may provide a much-needed edge in our struggles to contain or perhaps vanquish this often-fatal malignancy.",

It has been suggested that the constitutive activation of PI3K/AKT signaling with concurrent loss of function of the tumor suppressor molecule PTEN contributes to cancer formation. Members of the PI3K-PTEN-AKT pathway, including these proteins and mTOR, are altered in melanoma tumors and cell lines. A hallmark of activation of the pathway is the loss of function of PTEN. Indeed, loss of heterozygosity of PTEN has been observed in approximately 30% of human melanomas, implicating this signaling pathway in this cancer. PI3K signaling activation, via loss of PTEN function, can inhibit proapoptotic genes such as the FoxO family of transcription factors, while inducing cell growth- and cell survival-related elements such as p70S6K and AKT. Determining how the PI3K-PTEN-AKT signaling pathway, alone or in cooperation with other pathways, orchestrates the induction of target genes involved in a diverse range of activities is a major challenge in research into melanoma initiation and progression.

Here we present evidence indicating that MageA2 protein, belonging to the MAGE-A subfamily, confers wild-type-p53-sensitive resistance to etoposide (ET) by inducing a novel p53 inhibitory loop involving recruitment of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) to MageA2/p53 complex, thus strongly down-regulating p53 transactivation function. In fact, enhanced MageA2 protein levels, in addition to ET resistance, correlate with impaired acetylation of both p53 and histones surrounding p53-binding sites. Association between MAGE-A expression levels and resistance to ET treatment is clearly shown in short-term cell lines obtained from melanoma biopsies harboring wild-type-p53, whereas cells naturally, or siRNA-mediated expressing low MAGE-A levels, correlate with enhanced p53-dependent sensitivity to ET.

In the present study, we have synthesized four Pt complexes containing (2 - benzimidazole [4, 5-f] - [1, 10] phenanthroline) ligand and found that they could effectively enhance the X-ray-induced growth inhibition against A375 human melanoma cells through induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest. In contrast, they showed much lower cytotoxicity toward human normal cells. The complexes also dramatically inhibited the TrxR activity and caused intracellular ROS overproduction, due to the Auger electron effect of heavy metal element under X-ray radiation. Excessive ROS triggered DNA damage and activated downstream signaling pathways, including the phosphorylation of p53 and p38MAPK, and down-regulation of phosphorylated AKT and ERK, finally resulted in increase of radiosensitivity and inhibition of tumor reproduction. Taken together, our results suggest that the synthetic Pt complexes could be further developed as sensitizers of X-ray radiotherapy. ",

To overcome this barrier, we sought to discover chemical compounds that inhibit binding between MAGE and KAP-1 proteins.

We investigated p53 status and responses to p53-activating drugs using tumour-associated stromal cells from A375 melanoma and PC3 prostate carcinoma xenografts, and a spontaneous prostate tumour model (TRAMP). p53 accumulation after treatment with different p53-activating drugs was diminished in tumour-associated stromal cells compared to normal stromal cells. Tumour-associated stromal cells were also less sensitive to p53-activating drugs - this effect could be reproduced in normal stromal cells by p53 knockdown. Unlike normal stromal cells, tumour stromal cells failed to arrest in G(2) after etoposide treatment, failed to upregulate p53-inducible genes, and failed to undergo apoptosis after treatment with vincristine. The lower levels of p53 in tumour stromal cells accompanied abnormal karyotypes and multiple centrosomes. Impaired p53 function in tumour stroma might be related to genomic instability and could enable stromal cell survival in the destabilising tumour microenvironment.",

In our previous work, we constructed the pCLPG retroviral vector where transgene expression is controlled by p53 through a p53-responsive promoter. The use of this vector to introduce p19Arf into tumor cells that harbor p53wt should yield viral expression of p19Arf which, in turn, would activate the endogenous p53 and result in enhanced vector expression and tumor suppression. Since nutlin-3 can activate p53 by blocking its interaction with mdm2, we explored the possibility that the combination of p19Arf gene transfer and nutlin-3 drug treatment may provide an additive benefit in stimulating p53 function.;B16 (mouse melanoma) and C6 (rat glioma) cell lines, which harbor p53wt, were transduced with pCLPGp19 and these were additionally treated with nutlin-3 or the DNA damaging agent, doxorubicin. Viral expression was confirmed by Western, Northern and immunofluorescence assays. p53 function was assessed by reporter gene activity provided by a p53-responsive construct. Alterations in proliferation and viability were measured by colony formation, growth curve, cell cycle and MTT assays. In an animal model, B16 cells were treated with the pCLPGp19 virus and/or drugs before subcutaneous injection in C57BL/6 mice, observation of tumor progression and histopathologic analyses.;Here we show that the functional activation of endogenous p53wt in B16 was particularly challenging, but accomplished when combined gene transfer and drug treatments were applied, resulting in increased transactivation by p53, marked cell cycle alteration and reduced viability in culture. In an animal model, B16 cells treated with both p19Arf and nutlin-3 yielded increased necrosis and decreased BrdU marking. In comparison, C6 cells were quite susceptible to either treatment, yet p53 was further activated by the combination of p19Arf and nutlin-3.;To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply both p19Arf and nutlin-3 for the stimulation of p53 activity. These results support the notion that a p53 responsive vector may prove to be an interesting gene transfer tool, especially when combined with p53-activating agents, for the treatment of tumors that retain wild-type p53.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Therapeutic applications of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for treating various diseases have increased in recent years. To ensure that treatment is effective, an adequate MSC dosage should be determined before these cells are used for therapeutic purposes. To obtain a sufficient number of cells for therapeutic applications, MSCs must be expanded in long-term cell culture, which inevitably triggers cellular senescence. In this study, we investigated the surface markers of human umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs (hUCB-MSCs) associated with cellular senescence using fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis and 242 cell surface-marker antibodies. Among these surface proteins, we selected the melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM/CD146) for further study with the aim of validating observed expression differences and investigating the associated implications in hUCB-MSCs during cellular senescence. We observed that CD146 expression markedly decreased in hUCB-MSCs following prolonged in vitro expansion. Using preparative sorting, we found that hUCB-MSCs with high CD146 expression displayed high growth rates, multilineage differentiation, expression of stemness markers, and telomerase activity, as well as significantly lower expression of the senescence markers p16, p21, p53, and senescence-associated Î²-galactosidase, compared with that observed in hUCB-MSCs with low-level CD146 expression. In contrast, CD146 downregulation with small interfering RNAs enhanced the senescence phenotype. In addition, CD146 suppression in hUCB-MSCs caused downregulation of other cellular senescence regulators, including Bmi-1, Id1, and Twist1. Collectively, our results suggest that CD146 regulates cellular senescence; thus, it could be used as a therapeutic marker to identify senescent hUCB-MSCs.;One of the fundamental requirements for mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapies is the expansion of MSCs during long-term culture because a sufficient number of functional cells is required. However, long-term growth inevitably induces cellular senescence, which potentially causes poor clinical outcomes by inducing growth arrest and the loss of stem cell properties. Thus, the identification of markers for evaluating the status of MSC senescence during long-term culture may enhance the success of MSC-based therapy. This study provides strong evidence that CD146 is a novel and useful marker for predicting senescence in human umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs (hUCB-MSCs), and CD146 can potentially be applied in quality-control assessments of hUCB-MSC-based therapy.",

Tyrosinase expression increases during tumorigenesis, which could allow for selective treatment of this tumor type by strategies that use tyrosinase activity.

Two pathways are proposed for exploiting tyrosinase expression: (a) a p53-dependent pathway leading to apoptosis or arrest and (b) a reactive oxygen species-mediated induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress in p53 mutant tumors. Both strategies could use tyrosinase-mediated activation of quercetin, a dietary polyphenol that induces the expression of p53 and modulates reactive oxygen species. In addition to antitumor signaling properties, activation of quercetin could complement conventional cancer therapy by the induction of phase II detoxification enzymes resulting in p53 stabilization and transduction of its downstream targets. In conclusion, recent advances in tyrosinase enzymology, prodrug chemistry, and modern chemotherapeutics present an intriguing and selective multitherapy targeting system where dietary bioflavonoids could be used to complement conventional cancer treatments.",

We used a pooled RNA interference screen targeting more than 16,500 genes to discover loss-of-function events that could drive resistance to RAF inhibition. The highest ranking gene was NF1, which encodes neurofibromin, a tumor suppressor that inhibits RAS activity. NF1 loss mediates resistance to RAF and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors through sustained MAPK pathway activation. However, cells lacking NF1 retained sensitivity to the irreversible RAF inhibitor AZ628 and an ERK inhibitor.

ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) was once thought to be the primary driver of T-oligo-induced DNA damage responses; however, recent experiments have highlighted other key proteins that may also play a significant role.;To identify proteins associated with T-oligo, MM-AN cells were treated with biotinylated T-oligo or complementary oligonucleotide, cell lysates were run on SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), and the protein bands observed after treatment of cells with T-oligo or complementary oligonucleotide were analyzed using mass spectrometry. To study the effect of T-oligo on expression of hnRNP C1/C2 (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C1 and C2) and purine-rich element binding proteins (Pur proteins), cells were treated with T-oligo, and immunoblotting experiments were performed. To determine their role in senescence, cells were treated with shRNA (short hairpin ribonucleic acid) against these proteins, and senescence was studied using the senescence associated beta-galactosidase assay.;Using mass spectrometry, RNA-binding hnRNP C1/C2 and DNA-binding Pur proteins were found to associate with T-oligo. hnRNP C1/C2 exhibited increased expression (3.6-12.0-fold) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and in melanoma cells (4.5-5.2-fold), and Pur proteins exhibited increased expression of 2.2-fold in NSCLC and 2.0-fold in melanoma cells after T-oligo treatment. Experimental knockdown of hnRNP C1/C2 and Pur-beta completely abrogated T-oligo induced senescence in both MU melanoma and H358 NSCLC cells. Additionally, knockdown of Pur-beta prevented T-oligo-induced phosphorylation of p53, hypophosphorylation of pRb, and upregulation of E2F1, p21, and p53.;These novel findings highlight proteins essential to T-oligo's anticancer effects that may be of interest in telomere biology and cancer therapeutics.",

Under hypoxia, Tip110 stabilized p53, which in return destabilized Tip110. In addition, Tip110 regulated hypoxia-inducible factor 1Î± (HIF-1Î±), likely through enhancement of its protein stability. Furthermore, Tip110 upregulated p300, a known coactivator for both p53 and HIF-1Î±. Expression of a p53(22/23) mutant deficient in p300 binding accelerated Tip110 degradation under hypoxia. Tip110 knockdown resulted in the inhibition of cell proliferation and cell death in the presence of p53. Finally, significantly less Tip110, p53, and HIF-1Î± was detected in the hypoxic region of bone metastasis tumors in a mouse model of human melanoma cells.

This review summarises current studies on the dysregulation of the microRNA-34 (miR-34) family in different types of cancers and its role in the p53 network. The structure of the miR-34 family members includes p53-binding sites reflecting their function as tumour suppressors downstream of the p53 pathway. miR-34 dysregulation occurs in cancers, including several epithelial cancers, melanomas, neuroblastomas, leukemias and sarcomas, in the presence or absence of the p53 mutation. For these cancers, functional restoration of miR-34 is a useful novel therapy. As evidenced from preclinical and clinical studies, the miR-34 family plays an important role in the treatment of miR-34-dysregulated cancers with mutant or wild-type p53.

Acquired resistance to T-cell-based immunotherapy has been associated with loss of functional beta2-microglobulin expression. This anomaly appears to be particularly relevant in tumors exhibiting a defect in DNA-mismatch repair, and induces structural abnormalities in HLA cell-surface expression that are not reversible by cytokine treatment. We examined HLA expression in 118 melanoma, colon or larynx tumors to identify total loss of HLA class I expression with or without somatic beta2-microglobulin gene mutation. Microsatellite instability was investigated in these tumors to determine whether a replication error phenotype (RER+) implied a particular alteration in HLA phenotype. A total of 7.6% of the tumors showed the RER+ phenotype, and 12.7% were HLA-ABC-negative. In the RER+ group, only one tumor was HLA-ABC-negative and no beta2-microglobulin mutation was identified. In contrast, in the HLA-ABC-negative group, only one tumor showed microsatellite instability. None of the three melanomas that contained beta2-microglobulin mutation exhibited the mutator phenotype. These findings suggest that beta2-microglobulin mutation in human melanoma tumors may arise through a mechanism that does not necessarily involve microsatellite instability.

In this report, we show that 264scTCR/IL-2 inhibits the growth of primary tumors derived from the A375 (p53+/HLA-A2.1+) human melanoma and exhibits significantly better antitumor activity than recombinant human IL-2 alone. Moreover, treatment with 264scTCR/IL-2 results in tumor growth retardation in mice bearing large A375 tumors and other p53+/HLA-A2.1+ human tumors but does not affect tumor outgrowth of HLA-A2.1-negative tumors. This suggests that antigen targeting plays a substantial role in the efficacy of 264scTCR/IL-2 against p53+/HLA-A2+ tumors. Further, the antitumor activity of 264scTCR/IL-2 was found to be likely mediated by NK cell activation and tumor infiltration. A biologically active chimeric version of the molecule (c264scTCR/IL-2) also exhibits favorable pharmacokinetic properties required of a clinical candidate for this novel class of potent antitumor activities and targeted anticancer immunotherapeutics.",

Breast cancer studies revealed unique splicing mechanisms concerning BRCA1. In sporadic breast cancers the involvement of DNA-repair genes was proved to be dependent on the histological type. Bone-metastatic tumors have been characterized by decreased NM23 and increased c-met and p53 expressions. C-erbB2 genotype of the primary tumor was not maintained frequently in bone metastases. Application of DNA-microarray and quantitative PCR technologies improved the prediction of therapeutic sensitivity of breast cancers. Colorectal cancer studies revealed regional inhomogenities (clusters) in various geographical regions of Hungary, which were distinct in the case of colonic and rectal cancers. To increase the sensitivity of fecal blood test of colorectal cancer screening, a new double-antibody test was developed and tested in a large cohort of patients. Genetic analysis revealed that hypermethylation is a significant factor in microsatellite instability which, and plays a role in silencing of APC and E-cadherin genes as well. The Hungarian pattern of TS polymorphism was also determined and was correlated not only with the efficacy of 5-FU treatment but with the progression of the disease as well. Population-based studies have been carried out in head and neck cancer patients (HNC) and smokers as well to reveal the genetic background of increasing tumor incidence. These studies revealed polymorphism in XRCC1/3 methylation enzyme gene which has preventive role. Other studies found frequent local immunosuppression in HNC patients. Studies indicated that the success of irradiation in this cancer type is dependent on the anti-vascular effects. Pediatric cancer studies determined the parameters of neuroblastoma screening based on VMA measurements. New splice variants of the WT1 gene involved in the monitoring of MRD of ALL patients was also described this year. We also obtained positive experimental data for the retinoic acid therapy of ALL. Melanoma studies extensively used DNA-microarray technology which identified 4 melanoma-specific and 2 melanoma progression-specific genes. In experimental human melanoma xenograft models we have identified 3 anti-metastatic agents: low molecular weight heparin, 2-methoxyestradiol and erythropoietin-alpha, where the later was characterized by specific effects on tumor vasculature.",

To elucidate the role of SIRT1 in human skin carcinogenesis, we have examined SIRT1 protein expression in 20 cases each of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), basal cell carcinoma (BCC), Bowen's disease (BD), and actinic keratosis (AK) by immunohistochemical analysis. Overexpression of SIRT1 is frequently observed in all kinds of non-melanoma skin cancers included in this study. In particular, strong expression was observed in all cases of BD. In addition, no obvious difference between AK and SCC was observed in the expression of SIRT1, suggesting that overexpression of SIRT1 may have some relevance to the early stage of skin carcinogenesis.

Here, we describe the presence of thiolated p53 and the dynamic nature of this modification in human tissues using unique and specific polyclonal antibodies raised against a 12-residue p53 peptide bearing a mixed disulfide at Cys-141. The affinity- purified antibodies (glut-p53) were sequence-specific in that they recognized the antigenic peptide but not the unthiolated peptide or a scrambled glutathionylated peptide in ELISAs. On immunoblots, the purified antibodies did not react with native p53 or recombinant p53 (rp53), but readily detected the glutathionylated or cysteinylated or ethanethiol-treated rp53 only under nonreducing conditions. Untreated HCT116 cells showed low levels of glut-p53, which increased markedly after H(2)O(2), diamide, cisplatin, and doxorubicin treatments. Glut-p53 levels decreased sharply after cells were passed into oxidant-free medium, suggesting efficient dethiolation. The mutant p53 present in HT29 and T47D human cancer cells was also recognized. In vitro, the glut-p53 was rapidly degraded by rabbit reticulocyte lysates. Human prostate and prostate cancer tissues showed an abundant presence of glut-p53 in luminal epithelium, a site well known to generate ROS. Melanoma and colon cancer samples were also positive for glut-p53. The availability of the thiolation-specific antibodies should enhance our knowledge of p53 regulation in redox-perturbed states found in various diseases including cancer.",

In this study we have compared the influence of abrogation of PARP-1 expression by stable gene silencing to that of the pharmacological inhibition of cellular PARP activity using PARP-1/-2 inhibitors on the chemosensitivity of tumour cells to the wide spectrum methylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) and to the N3-adenine selective methylating agent {1-methyl-4-[1-methyl-4-(3-methoxysulfonylpropanamido)pyrrole-2-carboxamido]-pyrrole-2-carboxamido}propane (Me-Lex). Silencing of PARP-1 in melanoma or cervical carcinoma lines enhanced in vitro sensitivity to TMZ and Me- Lex, and induced a higher level of cell accumulation at the G2/M phase of cell cycle with respect to controls. GPI 15427, which inhibits both PARP-1 and PARP-2, increased sensitivity to TMZ and Me-Lex both in PARP-1-proficient and - deficient cells. However, it induced different cell cycle modulations depending on PARP-1 expression, provoking a G2/M arrest only in PARP-1 silenced cells. Treatment of PARP-1 silenced cells with TMZ or Me-Lex resulted in a more extensive phosphorylation of Chk-1 and p53 as compared to PARP-1 proficient cells. The combination of the methylating agents with GPI 15427 increased Chk-1 and p53 phosphorylation both in PARP-1 proficient or deficient cells. When mice challenged with PARP-1 silenced melanoma cells were treated with the TMZ and PARP inhibitor combination there was an additional reduction in tumour growth with respect to treatment with TMZ alone. These results suggest the involvement of PARP-2 or other PARPs, in the repair of DNA damage provoked by methylating agents, highlighting the importance of targeting both PARP-1 and PARP-2 for cancer therapy.",

MVE dose-dependently reduced viability of melanoma (B16) and glioma (U251) cells, but not peripheral blood mononuclear cells. It arrested cell cycle in S+G2/M phase, which was associated with the activation of MAP kinase p38 and up-regulation of antiproliferative genes p53, p21 and p27. MVE induced oxidative stress, while antioxidants abrogated its antitumor effect. Furthermore, MVE induced mitochondrial depolarization, activation of caspase-9 and -3, Parp cleavage, phosphatidylserine exposure and DNA fragmentation. The mitochondrial apoptotic pathway was associated with the up-regulation of proapoptotic genes Pten, Bak1, Apaf1, and Puma and down-regulation of antiapoptotic genes survivin and Xiap. MVE also stimulated the expression of autophagy-related genes Atg5, Atg7, Atg12, Beclin-1, Gabarab and Sqstm1, as well as LC3-I conversion to the autophagosome associated LC3-II, while autophagy inhibitors exacerbated its cytotoxicity. Finally, the most abundant phenolic components of MVE, ferulic, p-hydroxybenzoic, caffeic and chlorogenic acids, did not exert a profound effect on viability of tumor cells, suggesting that other components individually or in concert are the mediators of the extracts' cytotoxicity.

        "Doc_abstract":"Non-melanoma skin cancer represents one-third of all malignancies and its incidence is expected to rise until the year 2040. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) represents 20Â % of all non-melanoma skin cancer and is a deadly threat owing to its ability to metastasize to any organ in the body. Therefore, a better understanding of cSCC is essential to strengthen preventative measures and curable treatment options. Currently, research demonstrates that cSCC is diagnosed at a rate of 15-35 per 100,000 people and is expected to increase 2-4Â % per year. With respect to metastatic cSCC, this disease is more common in men; people over the age of 75Â years; and inhabitants of the south and mid-west USA. In 2010, the American Joint Committee on Cancer updated the Cancer Staging Manual's primary tumor designation to now include high-risk factors; however, factors such as immunosuppression and tumor recurrence were not included. Other staging systems such as Brigham and Women's Hospital have allowed for increased stratification of cSCC. High-risk cSCC is defined as a cSCC that is staged as N0, extends beyond basement membrane, and has high-risk features associated with sub-clinical metastasis. High-risk features are depth of invasion (>2Â mm), poor histological differentiation, high-risk anatomic location (face, ear, pre/post auricular, genitalia, hands, and feet), perineural involvement, recurrence, multiple cSCC tumors, and immunosuppression. Epidermal growth factor receptor and nuclear activeÂ IÎºB kinase (IKK) expression are also predictive of metastatic capabilities. Clinically, the initial lesions of a cSCC tumor can present as a painless plaque-like or verrucous tumor that can ultimately progress to being large, necrotic, and infected. Tumors can also present with paresthesias or lymphadenopathy depending on the location involved. With respect to prognosis, metastatic cSCC is lethal, with several large studies demonstrating a mortality rate of >70Â %. Therefore, treatment of metastatic cSCC is difficult and depends on the location involved and extent of metastasis. Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and any combination of the above. Surgery alone can be used for metastatic cSCC treatment, but is not as effective as surgery in conjunction with radiation therapy. Radiation therapy has some success as a monotherapy in low-risk or cosmetically sensitive areas such as the external ear, eyelid or nose. According to the 2013 National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines, cisplatin as a single agent or combined with 5-fluorouracil hold the strongest support for the treatment of metastatic cSCC; however, the supporting evidence is inconsistent and a curative chemotherapeutic approach is still lacking. Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors are a newer class of agents being used in metastatic cSCC and hold some promise as a therapy for this disease. Other areas of interest in finding curative treatments for metastatic cSCC include p53, hypermethylation of specific genes, chromatin remodeling genes, and the RAS/RTK/PI3K pathway. This review addresses the epidemiology, staging, risk factors, clinical presentation, management, and new trends in the treatment of high-risk and metastatic cSCC.",

UV radiation has been mainly implicated as the cause of non-melanoma skin cancer, although some role for UV in malignant melanoma has been suggested. The induction of skin cancer is mainly caused by the accumulation of mutations caused by UV damage. Cellular mechanisms exist to repair the DNA damage, or to induce apoptosis to remove severely damaged cells; however, the additive effects of mutations in genes involved in these mechanisms, or in control of the cell cycle, can lead to abnormal cell proliferation and tumor development. The molecular events in the induction of skin cancer are being actively investigated, and recent research has added to the understanding of the roles of tumor suppressor and oncogenes in skin cancer. UV radiation has been shown to induce the expression of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, and is known to produce \"signature\" mutations in p53 in human and mouse skin cancers and in the tumor suppressor gene patched in human basal cell carcinoma. The role of UV radiation in suppression of immune surveillance in the skin, which is an important protection against skin tumor development, is also being investigated. The knowledge gained will help to better understand the ways in which skin cancer arises from UV exposure, which will in turn allow development of better methods of treatment and prevention.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Previously we have demonstrated an apoptosis inducing activity for a rat hepatocyte conditioned medium (CM) presumably mediated by acidic isoferritins. Here, we present support for this assumption since isoferritins purified from different rat hepatocyte CM significantly enhanced the frequency of apoptotic cells in primary rat hepatocytes, an effect completely inhibited by a neutralizing anti-H-ferritin antibody. The apoptosis induction appears to be related to a 43 kDa ferritin subunit contained in the isoferritins released from primary hepatocytes, presumably representing a ferritin heavy/light chain heterodimer. In addition, these isoferritins immunologically crossreact with antibodies raised against placental isoferritin p43-PLF (which also contains a 43 kDa ferritin subunit) and melanoma-derived H-chain ferritin, representing ferritin isoforms which reveal immunomodulatory properties. Furthermore, p53 and FasL are upregulated upon isoferritin treatment in a time dependent mode, and apoptosis induction can be suppressed by neutralizing anti-FasL antibodies. Proapoptotic Bid is upregulated too and translocated into mitochondria in primary hepatocytes exposed to the isoferritins purified from the CM. Finally, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and dexamethasone (DEX), which counteract proapoptotic mitochondrial signalling, almost completely abolished the proapoptotic effect of the hepatocyte derived isoferritins. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that acidic isoferritins with homology to immunomodulatory ferritin isoforms (p43-PLF, melanoma-derived-H-chain ferritin) are released from hepatocytes in vitro, and are able to stimulate upregulation of p53 and mediate apoptosis involving Fas (CD95) signalling as well as addressing the intrinsic mitochondrial proapoptotic pathway.",

However, the manner by which these proliferative pathways are affected by the tumor suppressor protein p53 is not fully understood. We report here the results of an investigation of the status of p53 on two human melanoma cell lines with wild-type p53 (SK-Mel-186) or mutant p53 (SK-Mel-110). The basal levels of the activated extracellular-signal regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) were high in cells with wild-type p53, but low in cells with mutant p53. The 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced activation of ERK1/2 through the phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine at 202 and 204, respectively, was demonstrated in both cell lines, however, in a discrete manner. TPA-induced activation of ERK1/2 was sustained in wild-type p53 cells, while only a transient activation was seen in mutant p53 cells. Inhibition of MAPK kinase (MEK), an upstream kinase, by U0126, blocked TPA-induced activation of ERK1/2 in wild-type p53 cells and in mutant p53 cells. Treatment of wild-type p53 (SK-Mel 186) cells with small interfering RNA (siRNA) of p53 displayed a transient induction of activation of ERK1/2 following TPA treatment, indicating that p53 has a role in the regulation of the activation of ERK1/2. NF-kappaB activity decreased significantly in cells with wild-type p53, while enhanced NF-kappaB activity was evident in cells with mutant p53. The expression of either wild-type or mutant p53 had a similar effect on TPA-induced Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, indicating specificity for the ERK pathway. Similarly, AP-1 binding activity showed a transient variation in both cell lines after TPA treatment but with different kinetics. These observations suggest that both wild-type and mutant p53 can modulate the activation pathways for ERK1/2, and NF-kappaB distinctively, while modulating the pathways of JNK and AP-1 similarly. These differences may influence cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Despite the lack of protective melanin and increased oxidative stress due to mM concentrations of epidermal H2O2 in vitiligo, there is no significantly increased risk for chronic actinic damage and non-melanoma skin cancer. Therefore the question arises, which protective mechanisms could be involved in the skin of these patients preventing the initiation of these cancers. Recently an overexpression of p53 has been shown in vitiligo. Unfortunately there was no further characterization of this elevated p53. Employing a functional colour yeast assay, the study presented herein demonstrates for the first time the overexpression of a functioning wild-type p53 protein in both depigmented and 'normal' pigmented epidermis of patients with vitiligo compared with healthy controls. Surprisingly long-term narrowband UVB (311 nm) treatment does not alter this expression. Moreover, MDM-2, PCNA and p21 protein expression remain unchanged compared with healthy controls. This increased epidermal p53 in vitiligo coincides with decreased thioredoxin reductase (TR) protein levels in both depigmented and pigmented skin whereas mRNA expression is unaffected. Because TR is one transcriptional target of p53, these results support a wild-type functionality, which was further supported by the specific p53 FASAY yeast test. To our knowledge this is the first example of persistent elevated functioning wild-type p53 in humans. Based on our results we hypothesize that the low incidence for actinic damage, basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma as documented in vitiligo could well reside in a protective function of up-regulated wild-type p53.",

Many possible causes of multiple malignancies have been reported such as genetic alterations, exposure to anti-cancer chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunosuppressive therapy and reduced immunologic response. We report a female patient with multiple sclerosis and quadruple cancers of different embryological origin. Patient was diagnosed with stage III (T3, N1a, MO) medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), multicentric micropapillary thyroid carcinoma, scapular and lumbar melanomas (Clark II, Breslow II), and lobular invasive breast carcinoma (T1a, NO, MO). All tumors present in our patient except micropapillary thyroid carcinomas were investigated for gene alterations known to have a key role in cancer promotion and progression. Tumor samples were screened for the p16 alterations (loss of heterozygosity and homozygous deletions), loss of heterozygosity of PTEN, p53 alterations (mutational status and loss of heterozygosity) and mutational status of RET, HRAS and KRAS. Each type of tumor investigated had specific pattern of analyzed genetic alterations. The most prominent genetic changes were mutual alterations in PTEN and p53 tumor suppressors present in breast cancer and two melanomas. These co-alterations could be crucial for promoting development of multiple malignancies. Moreover the insertion in 4(th) codon of HRAS gene was common for all tumor types investigated. It represents frameshift mutation introducing stop codon at position 5 which prevents synthesis of a full-length protein. Since the inactivated RAS enhances sensitivity to tamoxifen and radiotherapy this genetic alteration could be considered as a good prognostic factor for this patient. ",

Nongenotoxic activation of p53 by targeting specific molecular pathways therefore provides an attractive therapeutic strategy in cancers with wild-type p53. Here, we explored the antitumor potential of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors in combination with a small molecule inhibitor of p53-murine double minute 2 (MDM2) interaction. We show that low doses of CDK inhibitors roscovitine and DRB synergize with the MDM2 antagonist nutlin-3a in the induction of p53 activity and promote p53-dependent apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Statistical measurement of the combination effects shows that the drug combination is additive on the reduction of cell viability and synergistic on inducing apoptosis, a critical end point of cytotoxic drugs. The degree of apoptosis observed 24 to 48 h after drug treatment correlated with the accumulation of p53 protein and concomitant induction of proapoptotic proteins Puma and PIG3. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects of this drug combination are validated in a range of tumor-derived cells including melanoma, colon carcinoma, breast adenocarcinoma, and hepatocarcinoma cells. Furthermore, this drug combination does not induce phosphorylation of Ser(15) on p53 and does not induce genotoxic stress in the cell. Given that many cytotoxic drugs rely on their ability to induce apoptosis via DNA damage-mediated activation of p53, the data presented here may provide a new therapeutic approach for the use of CDK inhibitors and MDM2 antagonists in combinatorial drug therapy.",

We detected 24 p53 mutations in 15/25 (60%) NMSCs, 1 deletion and 23 base substitutions, the majority (78%) being UV-specific C to T transitions at bipyrimidine sites. Importantly, 35% (6/17) are tandem mutations, including 4 UV signature CC to TT transitions possibly linked to modulated DNA repair caused by the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA). We found 8 p53 mutations in 7/17 (41%) precancerous actinic keratosis (AK), suggesting that p53 mutations are early events in RTR skin carcinogenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis shows a good correlation between p53 accumulation and mutations. HPV DNA was detected in 78% of skin lesions (60% Basal Cell Carcinomas, 82%AK and 79% SCCs). Thus, immunosuppression has increased the risk of infections by HPVs, predominantly epidermodysplasia verruciformis, speculated to play a role in skin cancer development. No association is found between HPV status and p53 mutation. Moreover, p53 codon 72 or frequencies of three XPD genotypes of RTRs are comparable with control populations.

Although the mechanism by which DENSpm induces apoptosis has been examined, the effect of DENSpm on autophagy has not been investigated yet. Therefore, in this study, our objective was to determine the role of p53 in the DENSpm-induced autophagy/apoptotic regulation in a time-dependent manner in colon cancer cells. Exposure of HCT 116 colon cancer cells to DENSpm decreased cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner. However, the p53 mutant, SW480, and deficient HCT 116 p53(-/-) cells were more resistant to DENSpm treatment compared to HCT 116 p53(+/+) cells. The resistant profile caused by p53 defect also caused a cell type-specific response to PA pool depletion and SSAT overexpression. In addition to PA depletion, DENSpm induced apoptosis by activating the mitochondria-mediated pathway in a caspase-dependent manner regardless of p53 expression in colon cancer cells. Concomitantly, we determined that DENSpm also affected autophagy in HCT 116 p53(+/+), SW480 and HCT 116 p53(-/-) colon cancer cells for different periods of exposure to DENSpm.

Because the cure rate of these neoplasias by conventional treatment is very low, new therapeutic approaches are needed. Entrapping high concentrations of cytotoxic drugs and/or oligonucleotides within stabilized liposomal formulations represents an emerging modality of antitumor treatment. Here, we tested the in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects of a novel antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (asODN) liposomal formulation, the coated cationic liposomes (CCL), by targeting the c-myc and the c-myb oncogenes on melanoma and neuroblastoma, respectively, through the use of a monoclonal antibody against the disialoganglioside GD2, selectively expressed by neuroectoderma-derived tumors. Our methods produced GD2-targeted liposomes that stably entrapped 90 percent of added asODNs. These liposomes showed selective binding for GD2-positive tumor cells in vitro. Neuroblastoma cells treated with free myb-as or nontargeted CCL-myb-as showed the same level of c-myb protein expression as control cells. In contrast, c-myb protein expression of cells treated with aGD2-CCL-myb-as was inhibited by approximately 70 percent. Melanoma and neuroblastoma cell proliferation was inhibited to a greater extent by GD2-targeted liposomes containing c-myc or c-myb asODNs than by nontargeted liposomes or free asODNs. Mice bearing established subcutaneous human melanoma xenografts treated with aGD2-CCL-myc-as exhibited significantly reduced tumor growth and increased survival. The mechanism for the antitumor effects appears to be downregulation of the expression of the c-myc protein, induction of p53, and inhibition of Bcl-2 proteins, leading to extensive tumor cell apoptosis. In contrast, the increased life span obtained in a neuroblastoma pseudometastatic mouse model with the liposomal c-myb asODNs seems to be due to a synergistic mechanism: specific targeting to neuroblastoma cancer cells, downmodulation of c-myb protein expression, and stimulation of the innate immune system. These results suggest that inhibition of c-myc or c-myb proto-oncogenes by GD2-targeted antisense therapy could provide an effective approach for the treatment of neuroectodermal tumors in an adjuvant setting.",

This barrier can be circumvented by using the truncated form of the E2F-1 gene (E2Ftr) (amino acids 1 through 375), which lacks the E2F-1 transactivation domain and cell cycle-promoting effects.;The authors constructed 3 adenoviral vectors that expressed E2Ftr under regulation of the tetracycline (Tet)-off system (AdTet-E2Ftr1, AdTet-E2Ftr2, and AdTet-E2Ftr3). These vectors were compared for E2Ftr expression and apoptosis induction in cancer cells and normal cells. E2Ftr antitumor activity in vivo also was assessed in a melanoma xenograft model.;One of the 3 vectors, AdTet-E2Ftr3, had the highest E2Ftr protein expression levels, which were correlated with the greatest induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cancer cell growth. E2Ftr induced apoptosis in a variety of cancer cell lines independent of p53 status with little cytotoxicity in normal cell lines. In a mouse melanoma xenograft model, AdTet-E2Ftr3 exhibited an approximately 80% decrease in tumor size compared with controls in vivo.;The current results indicated that AdTet-E2Ftr3 is a novel anticancer agent that has significant therapeutic activity in vitro and in vivo.",

In this report, we demonstrate that treatment of 1-LN prostate cancer cells with this antibody decreases cell surface expression of GRP78, Akt(Thr308) and Akt(Ser473) kinase activities and reduces phosphorylation of FOXO, and GSK3beta. This treatment also suppresses activation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK and MKK3/6; however, it upregulates MKK4 activity. JNK, as determined by its phosphorylation state, is subsequently activated, triggering apoptosis. Incubation of cells with antibody reduced levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, while elevating pro-apoptotic BAD, BAX and BAK expression as well as cleaved caspases-3, -7, -8 and -9. Silencing GRP78 or p53 gene expression by RNAi prior to antibody treatment abrogated these effects.

These patients respond well to imatinib mesylate, raising the question as to whether patients with a PDGF receptor mutation in other tumor types should receive a tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. We characterized 10 novel somatic point mutations in PDGFRA that have been reported in isolated cases of glioblastoma, melanoma, acute myeloid leukemia, peripheral nerve sheath tumors and neuroendocrine carcinoma. The PDGFRA transmembrane domain mutation V536E stimulated Ba/F3 cell growth and signaling via ERK and STAT5 in the absence of ligand. This mutant, identified in glioblastoma, was strongly inhibited by imatinib. Modeling suggested that the mutation modulates the packing of the transmembrane domain helices in the receptor dimer. By contrast, two mutations in highly conserved residues affected the receptor traffic to the cell surface or kinase activity, thereby preventing the response to PDGF. The other mutations had no significant impact on the receptor activity. This functional analysis matched the predictions of SIFT and PolyPhen for only five mutations and these algorithms do not discriminate gain from loss of function. Finally, an E996K variant that had been identified in a melanoma cell line was not expressed in these cells. Altogether, several newly identified PDGFRA mutations do not activate the receptor and may therefore represent passenger mutations. Our results also underline the importance of characterizing novel kinase alterations in cancer patients. ",

This study evaluates immunohistochemistry using Ki-67, an antibody to a nuclear protein expressed in proliferating cells, and DO-7, an antibody to the product of the tumour suppressor gene p53, as prognostic indicators for these tumours. Immunohistochemistry with Ki-67 has been correlated with the behaviour of many different tumours, but its value as a prognostic indicator in astrocytic tumours is diminished by the conflicting results of previous studies. Immunohistochemistry with antibodies to the p53 protein has been used as a prognostic indicator in melanomas and some carcinomas, but the relation between prognosis and accumulation of this protein in astrocytic tumours has not been clarified. We have tested the hypothesis that survival is correlated with Ki-67 immunolabelling indices (LIs) and patterns of p53 immunolabelling in the cerebral astrocytic tumours of a large cohort of patients (n = 123) for whom clinical indices were well documented. Astrocytic tumours were divided into three histological types: fibrillary astrocytoma (n = 24), anaplastic astrocytoma (n = 31), and glioblastoma (n = 68). Histological type and patient age were independent predictors of survival. Median Ki-67 LIs differed significantly (P < 0.0001) between the types of astrocytic tumour, and tumours with a Ki-67 LI < 2% had a significantly (P < 0.0001) better prognosis. Ki-67 LI as a continuous variable carried a significant (P = 0.0043) unadjusted hazard to survival which was lost when adjusted for other variables, notably histological type. By contrast, no relation was found between survival and three categories of p53 labeling (p53-negative, p53 LI < 40%, and p53 LI > 60%). The results indicate that, whereas Ki-67 immunohistochemistry predicts survival in patients with astrocytic tumours, conventional histological appraisal remains the best guide to prognosis, and immunohistochemistry for p53 has no value in the assessment of these tumours.",

Biological activity was first demonstrated in melanoma cell lines and was confirmed in mice bearing human melanoma xenografts. These in vivo studies also established a favorable safety margin for betulinic acid, as systemic side effects were not observed at any dose. Recently, considerable in vitro evidence has demonstrated that betulinic acid is effective against small- and non-small-cell lung, ovarian, cervical, and head and neck carcinomas. Published data suggest that betulinic acid induces apoptosis in sensitive cells in a p53- and CD95-independent fashion. While the precise molecular target and mechanism of action remain elusive and are the focus of a number of ongoing research programs, accumulated experimental evidence indicates that betulinic acid functions through a mitochondrial-mediated pathway. Supplemental reports suggest that the generation of reactive oxygen species, inhibition of topoisomerase I, activation of the MAP kinase cascade, inhibition of angiogenesis, and modulation of pro-growth transcriptional activators and aminopeptidase N activity may play a role in betulinic acid-induced apoptosis. These potential mechanisms of action may enable betulinic acid to be effective in cells resistant to other chemotherapeutic agents.

However, many cancers remain resistant to TRAIL. To overcome TRAIL resistance, combination therapies using sensitizers of the TRAIL pathway would be an efficacious approach. To investigate potential sensitizers of TRAIL-induced apoptosis, we used TRAIL-resistant human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-associated adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) cells as a model system. So far, HTLV-1-associated ATL is incurable by presently known therapies. Here, we show that wogonin and the structurally related natural flavones apigenin and chrysin break TRAIL resistance in HTLV-1-associated ATL by transcriptional down-regulation of c-FLIP, a key inhibitor of death receptor signaling, and by up-regulation of TRAIL receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2). This effect is mediated through transcriptional inhibition of the p53 antagonist murine double minute 2 (Mdm2), leading to an increase in p53 levels and, consequently, to up-regulation of the p53 target gene TRAIL-R2. We also show that these flavones can sensitize to TNFÎ±- and CD95-mediated cell death. Furthermore, we show that wogonin, apigenin, and chrysin also enhance TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in other human cancer cell lines including breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, colon cancer cell line HT-29, hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2, melanoma cell line SK-MEL-37, and pancreatic carcinoma cell line Capan-1 by the same mechanism.

The construct was transfected into dexamethasone receptor negative F1 and receptor positive F10 cells of the B16 murine melanoma. The transferred gene was switched on in two transfectant clones of F10, by exposure to 10(-6) M dexamethasone, but not in clones of the receptor negative F1 line. One of the F10 transfectant clones (F10-192/10) was characterized further. A 13.5-fold increase in 18A2/mts1 transcripts was found in this clone upon exposure to dexamethasone. There was also a seven-fold increase in lung colonization in an experimental metastasis assay, together with increased expression of depolymerized tubulin and enhanced detection of p53 protein. The number of cells in the S phase increased by 2.5-fold following dexamethasone treatment of the clone. These data suggest a direct involvement of the 18A2/mts1 gene in lung colonization by the tumor cells. The 18A2/mts1 protein promotes tubulin depolymerization, sequesters the p53 phosphoprotein, and induces the cells to enter the S phase, but the relevance of these in the metastatic process remains to be elucidated.",

In this study, TUNEL assay and flow cytometric analysis also indicate that one of the causes of A375-S2 cell death induced by oridonin was apoptosis. The cell death was preceded by the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. Twelve hours after treatment with oridonin, the ratio of Bax/Bcl-xL protein expression was increased and release of cytochrome c was decreased by an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) MAPK inhibitor (PD98059) and a phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3-K) inhibitor (wortmannin). A mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) inhibitor, decylubiquinone, suppressed the release of cytochrome c without affecting Bax expression. The activation of p53 by oridonin was also blocked by wortmannin. In addtion, PD98059 and wortmannin significantly decreased oridonin-induced DNA fragmentation, but the p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) did not after DNA fragmentation. Oridonin induced A375-S2 cell apoptosis by activating parallel p53 and ERK pathways, increasing the ratio of Bax/Bcl-xL protein expression, and promoting the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, resulting in apoptotic cell death.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The conserved serine/threonine kinase mTOR (the mammalian target of rapamycin), a downstream effector of the PI3K/AKT pathway, forms two distinct multiprotein complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 is sensitive to rapamycin, activates S6K1 and 4EBP1, which are involved in mRNA translation. It is activated by diverse stimuli, such as growth factors, nutrients, energy and stress signals, and essential signalling pathways, such as PI3K, MAPK and AMPK, in order to control cell growth, proliferation and survival. mTORC2 is considered resistant to rapamycin and is generally insensitive to nutrients and energy signals. It activates PKC-Î± and AKT and regulates the actin cytoskeleton. Deregulation of multiple elements of the mTOR pathway (PI3K amplification/mutation, PTEN loss of function, AKT overexpression, and S6K1, 4EBP1 and eIF4E overexpression) has been reported in many types of cancers, particularly in melanoma, where alterations in major components of the mTOR pathway were reported to have significant effects on tumour progression. Therefore, mTOR is an appealing therapeutic target and mTOR inhibitors, including the rapamycin analogues deforolimus, everolimus and temsirolimus, are submitted to clinical trials for treating multiple cancers, alone or in combination with inhibitors of other pathways. Importantly, temsirolimus and everolimus were recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma, PNET and giant cell astrocytoma. Small molecules that inhibit mTOR kinase activity and dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitors are also being developed. In this review, we aim to survey relevant research, the molecular mechanisms of signalling, including upstream activation and downstream effectors, and the role of mTOR in cancer, mainly in melanoma.",

Ircinin-1 treatment on SK-MEL-2 cells resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth and induced apoptotic cell death. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that ircinin-1 resulted in G1 arrest in cell cycle progression which was associated with a marked decrease in the protein expression of D-type cyclins and their activating partners Cdk 4 and 6 with concomitant inductions of p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27KIP1. The induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 appears to be transcriptionally upregulated and is p53-independent. In addition, ircinin-1 suppressed the phosphorylation of pRb protein and increased the co-association of pRb or proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) with p21WAF1/CIP1 in these cells. Ircinin-1 treatment also resulted in induction of apoptosis as determined by morphological changes, DNA fragmentation, alternated ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, cleavages of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and PLC-gamma1, and flow cytometric analysis. Ircinin-1 also induced cytochrome c release, cleavage activations of caspase-3 and -9, and upregulation of Fas and Fas-L. Even though the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) was expressed in ircinin-1-untreated or -treated SK-MEL-2 cells, only the level of cIAP-1, but not XIAP or cIAP-2, was decreased during ircinin-1-induced apoptosis at Western blot and RT-PCR studies. Taken together, these findings suggest that ircinin-1 has strong potential for development as an agent for prevention against skin cancer.",

We have developed an aerosol system utilizing a cationic polymer, polyethyleneimine (PEI), for topical gene delivery to the lungs as a novel approach for treatment of lung cancer. Using a B16-F10 murine melanoma model in C57BL/6 mice, we previously demonstrated that aerosol delivery of PEI-p53 DNA resulted in highly significant reductions in the tumor burden (P < .001) in treated animals, and also lead to about 50% increase in the mean length of survival of the mice-bearing B16-F10 lung tumors. The mechanisms of this antitumor effect of p53 are investigated in this report. Here, we demonstrate that the p53 transfection leads to an up-regulation of the antiangiogenic factor thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) in the lung tissue and the serum of the mice. Furthermore, there is a down-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the lung tissue and serum of the B16-F10 tumor-bearing mice treated with PEI-p53 DNA complexes, compared with untreated tumor-bearing animals. In addition, staining for von Willebrand factor (vWF), a marker for the angiogenic blood vessels, revealed that p53 treatment leads to a decrease in the angiogenic phenotype of the B16-F10 tumors. Immunohistochemistry for transgene expression reveals that the PEI-p53 aerosol complexes transfect mainly the epithelial cells lining the airways, with diffuse transfection in the alveolar lining cells, as well as, the tumor foci in the lung tissue. There was also some evidence of apoptosis in the lung tumor foci of animals treated with p53. The data suggest that aerosol delivery of PEI-p53 complexes leads to inhibition of B16-F10 lung metastases, in part by suppression of angiogenesis.",

Clinical investigations have been completed or are under way to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bortezomib alone or in combination with chemotherapy in multiple myeloma, both at relapse and presentation, as well as in other cancer types. The antiproliferative, proapoptotic, antiangiogenic, and antitumor activities of bortezomib result from proteasome inhibition and depend on the altered degradation of a host of regulatory proteins. Exposure to bortezomib has been shown to stabilize p21, p27, and p53, as well as the proapoptotic Bid and Bax proteins, caveolin-1, and inhibitor kappaB-alpha, which prevents activation of nuclear factor kappaB-induced cell survival pathways. Bortezomib also promoted the activation of the proapoptotic c-Jun-NH2 terminal kinase, as well as the endoplasmic reticulum stress response. The anticancer effects of bortezomib as a single agent have been demonstrated in xenograft models of multiple myeloma, adult T-cell leukemia, lung, breast, prostate, pancreatic, head and neck, and colon cancer, and in melanoma. In these preclinical in vivo studies, bortezomib treatment resulted in decreased tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis, as well as increased survival and tumor apoptosis. In several in vitro and/or in vivo cancer models, bortezomib has also been shown to enhance the antitumor properties of several antineoplastic treatments. Importantly, bortezomib was generally well tolerated and did not appear to produce additive toxicities when combined with other therapies in the dosing regimens used in these preclinical in vivo investigations. These findings provide a rationale for further clinical trials using bortezomib alone or in combination regimens with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, or novel agents in patients with hematologic malignancies or solid tumors.",

MYC has been reported to protect cells from apoptosis activation but also to sensitize cells to apoptotic stimuli. We have previously demonstrated that the down-regulation of Myc protein activates apoptosis in melanoma cells and increases the susceptibility of cells to various antitumoral treatments. Beyond the well-known role in the G1-->S transition, MYC is also involved in the G2-M cell cycle phases regulation.;In this study we have investigated how MYC could influence cell survival signalling during G2 and M phases. We used the microtubules damaging agent paclitaxel (PTX), to arrest the cells in the M phase, in a p53 mutated melanoma cell line with modulated Myc level and activity. An overexpression of Myc protein is able to increase endoreduplication favoring the survival of cells exposed to antimitotic poisoning. The PTX-induced endoreduplication is associated in Myc overexpressing cells with a reduced expression of MAD2, essential component of the molecular core of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), indicating an impairment of this checkpoint. In addition, for the first time we have localized Myc protein at the spindle poles (centrosomes) during pro-metaphase in different cell lines.;The presence of Myc at the poles during the prometaphase could be necessary for the Myc-mediated attenuation of the SAC and the subsequent induction of endoreduplication. In addition, our data strongly suggest that the use of taxane in antitumor therapeutic strategies should be rationally based on the molecular profile of the individual tumor by specifically analyzing Myc expression levels.",

HIFalpha protein levels are increased in most solid tumours and correlate with patient prognosis. The link between HIF and apoptosis, a major determinant of cancer progression and treatment outcome, is poorly understood. Here we show that Caenorhabditis elegans HIF-1 protects against DNA-damage-induced germ cell apoptosis by antagonizing the function of CEP-1, the homologue of the tumour suppressor p53. The antiapoptotic property of HIF-1 is mediated by means of transcriptional upregulation of the tyrosinase family member TYR-2 in the ASJ sensory neurons. TYR-2 is secreted by ASJ sensory neurons to antagonize CEP-1-dependent germline apoptosis. Knock down of the TYR-2 homologue TRP2 (also called DCT) in human melanoma cells similarly increases apoptosis, indicating an evolutionarily conserved function. Our findings identify a novel link between hypoxia and programmed cell death, and provide a paradigm for HIF-1 dictating apoptotic cell fate at a distance.",

Recent technical advances have enabled the identification of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes in various tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). However, little is known about which TAA and its epitope are the most immunogenic and useful for a cancer vaccine for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We examined the expression of 17 kinds of TAA in 9 pancreatic cancer cell lines and 12 pancreatic cancer tissues. CTL responses to 23 epitopes derived from these TAAs were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT), CTL, and tetramer assays in 41 patients, and factors affecting the immune responses were investigated. All TAAs were frequently expressed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells, except for adenocarcinoma antigens recognized by T cells 1, melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE)-A1, and MAGE-A3. Among the epitopes recognized by CTLs in more than two patients in the ELISPOT assay, 6 epitopes derived from 5 TAAs, namely, MAGE-A3, p53, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), Wilms tumor (WT)-1, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)2, could induce specific CTLs that showed cytotoxicity against pancreatic cancer cell lines. The frequency of lymphocyte subsets correlated well with TAA-specific immune response. Overall survival was significantly longer in patients with TAA-specific CTL responses than in those without. P53, hTERT, WT-1, and VEGFR2 were shown to be attractive targets for immunotherapy in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and the induction of TAA-specific CTLs may improve the prognosis of these patients.

        "Doc_abstract":"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have long been linked to cancer progression owing to their ability to breakdown tissue barriers for metastatic spread. Accordingly, multiple studies have examined the potential value of these enzymes as targets for cancer therapy. Unfortunately, most clinical trials with MMP inhibitors have yielded negative results which has made necessary to re-evaluate the role of these proteases in cancer. Recent works mainly based on the use of mouse models deficient in specific MMPs have revealed that these enzymes play many roles in cancer distinct from matrix destruction, influencing early steps of tumor evolution, and expanding their pro-tumorigenic properties. However, these in vivo studies have also shown that, unexpectedly, some MMP family members like MMP8 may have paradoxical anti-tumor functions. Nevertheless, the final validation of these MMPs as bona fide tumor suppressors requested the identification of the putative genetic or epigenetic changes underlying their inactivation during cancer development. To this purpose, very recent large-scale genomic studies have explored the possibility that MMPs could be genetically altered in a panel of human malignant tumors from different sources. These studies have demonstrated that MMP8 is a frequently mutated gene in human melanoma. Functional analysis of the identified mutations has confirmed that all of them lead to the loss-of-function of MMP8 and enhance the progression of melanoma, thus providing definitive evidence that MMP8 is a tumor-suppressor gene. Parallel studies have extended these findings to other MMP-related metalloproteinases such as ADAMTS15, which has been found to be genetically inactivated in human colorectal cancer. This review describes the identification and validation of some MMPs and related enzymes as anti-tumor proteases and speculates about the molecular mechanisms underlying their protective roles in tumor development. Finally, the review explores the clinical applications derived from the identification of MMPs that favour the host instead of the tumor.",

Since its identification in the early 1990s, Rap2B has elicited a considerable interest. Numerous studies indicate that Rap2B exerts specific biological functions, including binding and stimulating phospholipase C-Îµ and interferon-Î³. In addition, downregulation of Rap2B affects the growth of melanoma cells. The present review summarizes the possible effectors and biological functions of Rap2B.

In this study, we revealed that various metastatic cancer cells showed consistently higher levels of antiapoptotic proteins, including Bcl-2, nuclear factor-kappaB, MDM2, DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and lower levels of proapoptotic proteins, including Bax and p53 than low metastatic parental cells. This was followed by chemo- and radioresistance in metastatic cancer cells compared with their parental cells. EGFR and DNA-PK activity, which are known to be associated with chemo- and radioresistance, were demonstrated to be mutually regulated by each other. Treatment with PKI166, an EGFR inhibitor, suppressed etoposide-induced activation of DNA-PK in A375SM metastatic melanoma cells. In addition, PKI166 enhanced markedly the chemosensitivities of metastatic cancer cell sublines to various anticancer drugs in comparison with those of low metastatic cancer cells. These results suggest that the activities of DNA-PK and EGFR, which is positively correlated with each other, may contribute to metastatic phenotype as well as therapy resistance, and the EGFR inhibitor enhances the effect of anticancer drugs against therapy-resistant metastatic cancer cells via suppression of stress responses, including activation of DNA-PK.",

A review of the literature is undertaken, establishing the role of each technique in achieving clear surgical margins. A case example is presented, highlighting the role of the DRAPE approach.

In this study, the authors investigated the antimetastatic potential of nomilin and its possible mechanism of action. Metastasis was induced in C57BL/6 mice through the lateral tail vein using highly metastatic B16F-10 melanoma cells. Administration of nomilin inhibited tumor nodule formation in the lungs (68%) and markedly increased the survival rate of the metastatic tumor-bearing animals. These results correlated with the biochemical parameters and histopathological analysis. Nomilin showed an inhibition of tumor cell invasion and activation of matrix metalloproteinases. Treatment with nomilin induced apoptotic response, characterized by an increase in the sub-G1 fraction of cells with chromatin condensation and membrane blebbing, a typical ladder of DNA fragmentation, and detection of apoptotic cells by TUNEL assay. Nomilin treatment also exhibited a downregulated Bcl-2 and cyclin-D1 expression and upregulated p53, Bax, caspase-9, caspase-3, p21, and p27 gene expression in B16F-10 cells. Proinflammatory cytokine production and gene expression were found to be downregulated in nomilin-treated cells.

However, the precise mechanism by which PCL induces tumor cell death is still only rudimentarily understood. In the present study, PCL was shown to markedly inhibit the growth of human melanoma A375 cells with concomitant low toxicity to the normal melanocytes. Subsequently, PCL was found to simultaneously induce A375 cell apoptosis and autophagy. The mechanism of apoptosis following treatment with PCL involved regulation of Bax, Bcl-x(L) and Bcl-2 proteins, which then caused collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential, leading to cytochrome c release and caspase activation. The treatment with PCL also abrogated the glutathione antioxidant system, and induced mitochondria to generate massive ROS accumulation, which subsequently resulted in p38 and p53 activation. Further experimental data confirmed that the ROS-p38-p53 pathway could be involved in the stimulation of autophagy, suggesting that autophagy may play a death-promoting role via the above-mentioned apoptotic pathway. In conclusion, these findings indicate that PCL induces both apoptosis and autophagy in cancer cells through a mitochondria-mediated ROS-p38-p53 pathway.",

Moreover, physalin A-induced apoptosis was triggered by activation of p53-Noxa pathway and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The administration of ROS scavengers NAC and GSH resulted in the complete inhibition of physalin A-induced ROS generation and apoptosis. Application of p53 inhibitor PFT-Î± or transfection with Noxa-siRNA could also lead to the same results. Autophagy, demonstrated by the punctuate distribution of monodansylcadaverine staining, as well as the change of LC3-II/LC3-I proportion and Beclin 1 activation, played a protective role against apoptosis via up-regulation of the p38-NF-ÎºB survival pathway in A375-S2 cells. Additionally, inhibition of autophagy by the specific autophagic inhibitor 3MA or blocking the p38-NF-ÎºB pathway with p38 inhibitor SB203580 or NF-ÎºB inhibitor PDTC obviously promoted physalin A-induced apoptosis.;Physalin A induced apoptotic cell death via p53-Noxa-mediated ROS generation, and autophagy played a protective role against apoptosis through up-regulating the p38-NF-ÎºB survival pathway in A375-S2 cells.

Here we sought to determine if this cytotoxic effect could be restricted to transformed keratinocytes relative to their normal human epidermal keratinocyte (NHEK) counterparts, and ascertain a potential mechanistic basis for the selectivity. The NHEK cells proliferated much slower than the premalignant HaCaT and malignant COLO 16 keratinocytes, and exogenous uridine added to the culture medium did not affect this growth. Similarly, DHODH expression and the bioenergetic characteristics of the normal cells were markedly dissimilar from those observed in the transformed cells indicating that de novo pyrimidine synthesis was involved with keratinocyte proliferation. Moreover, a short-term exposure to TFN caused a wild-type p53 response in the NHEK cells illustrating that pyrimidine metabolic stress could regulate this tumor suppressor protein in the normal cells. TFN-induced apoptosis occurred primarily in S phase HaCaT cells. This cell death was sensitive to uridine, an antioxidant, and a caspase inhibitor, and the suppression of Bcl-X(L) and the induction of Mn superoxide dismutase preceded it. These events suggested that mitochondrial/redox stress was involved with the cytotoxic effect of TFN. Conversely, a long-term exposure to TFN caused G(0)/G(1) arrest in the NHEK cells, which supported a cytoprotective role for p53 against TFN-induced apoptosis. Together, these results propose that TFN could be useful in the prevention or therapy of non-melanoma skin cancers and possibly other hyperproliferative keratinocytic diseases.",

Both extracts inhibited tumor growth of B16 mouse melanoma cells inoculated subcutaneously into syngeneic C57BL/6 mice and reduced viability of B16 cells in vitro, whereby GLme exhibited stronger effect. Furthermore, anticancer activity of GLme was demonstrated for the first time against two other rodent tumor cell lines, L929-mouse fibrosarcoma and C6-rat astrocytoma. The mechanism of antitumor activity of GLme comprised inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death mediated by upregulated p53 and inhibited Bcl-2 expression. Moreover, the antitumor effect of the GLme was associated with intensified production of reactive oxygen species, whereas their neutralization by the antioxidant, N-acetyl cysteine, resulted in partial recovery of cell viability.

Members of the MAGE-A (melanoma antigen family A) gene family are frequently clustered in mammalian genomes and are exclusively expressed in the testes of normal animals but abnormally activated in a wide variety of cancers. We investigated the potential roles of these genes in spermatogenesis by generating a mouse model with a 210-kb genomic deletion encompassing six members of the Magea gene cluster (Magea1, Magea2, Magea3, Magea5, Magea6 and Magea8). Male mice carrying the deletion displayed smaller testes from 2 months old with a marked increase in apoptotic germ cells in the first wave of spermatogenesis. Furthermore, we found that Magea genes prevented stress-induced spermatogenic apoptosis after N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) treatment during the adult stage. Mechanistically, deletion of the Magea gene cluster resulted in a dramatic increase in apoptotic germ cells, predominantly spermatocytes, with activation of p53 and induction of Bax in the testes. These observations demonstrate that the Magea genes are crucial in maintaining normal testicular size and protecting germ cells from excessive apoptosis under genotoxic stress. ",

However, despite mir320a induction, NONO mRNA and protein expression are not affected by UVC. We found through RNA immunoprecipitation that UVC rays induce the ubiquitous RNA-binding protein HUR to bind NONO 5'UTR in a site overlapping mir320a binding site. Both HUR silencing and its pharmacological inhibition induced NONO downregulation following UVC exposure, whereas concomitant mir320a silencing restored NONO stability. UVC-mediated mir320a upregulation is triggered by p53 binding to its promoter, which lies within a region marked by H3K4me3 and H3K27ac signals upon UVC treatment. Silencing mir320a sensitizes cells to DNA damage. Overall our findings reveal a new mechanism whereby HUR protects NONO from mir320-mediated degradation upon UVC exposure and identify a new component within the complex network of players underlying the DNA damage response adding mir320a to the list of p53-regulated targets upon genotoxic stress.",

Along with this potency, complex 2 b exhibited a high degree of selectivity between human cancer and normal cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that 2 b promotes radiation-induced accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) by reacting with cellular glutathione (GSH) and then causing DNA stand breaks. The subsequent DNA damage induces phosphorylation of p53 (p-p53) and upregulates the expression levels of p21, which inhibits the expression of cyclin-B, leading to G2M arrest. Moreover, p-p53 activates caspases-3 and -8, triggers cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), finally resulting in apoptosis.

Akt inhibitor decreased the viability of UV-irradiated cells which was treated with silymarin. In addition, the effect of UV irradiation on the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members [extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)] was also reversed by silymarin. Moreover, ERK inhibitor (PD98059) and p38 inhibitor (SB203580) augmented UV-induced apoptosis in silymarin treated A375-S2 cells. Consequently, silymarin partially reduced UV-induced apoptosis by activating the Akt pathway, and silymarin's protective effect was also exerted by MAPK family members.",

NAG-1 expression is substantially increased during cancer development and progression especially in gastrointestinal, prostate, pancreatic, colorectal, breast, melanoma, and glioblastoma brain tumors. Aberrant increases in the serum levels of secreted NAG-1 correlate with poor prognosis and patient survival rates in some cancers. In contrast, the expression of NAG-1 is up-regulated by several tumor suppressor pathways including p53, GSK-3Î², and EGR-1. NAG-1 expression is also induced by many drugs and dietary compounds which are documented to prevent the development and progression of cancer in mouse models. Studies with transgenic mice expressing human NAG-1 demonstrated that the expression of NAG-1 inhibits the development of intestinal tumors and prostate tumors in animal models. Laboratory and clinical evidence suggest that NAG-1, like other TGF-Î² family members, may have different or pleiotropic functions in the early and late stages of carcinogenesis. Upon understanding the molecular mechanism and function of NAG-1 during carcinogenesis, NAG-1 may serve as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer and a therapeutic target for the inhibition and treatment of cancer development and progression.",

An important effector of the ISR is activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), a transcription factor that regulates genes involved in redox homeostasis and amino acid metabolism and transport. Because both inhibition and overactivation of the ISR can induce tumor cell death, modulators of ATF4 expression could prove to be clinically useful. In this study, chemical libraries were screened for modulators of ATF4 expression. We identified one compound, E235 (N-(1-benzyl-piperidin-4-yl)-2-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-benzo[d]imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-7-carboxamide), that activated the ISR and dose-dependently increased levels of ATF4 in transformed cells. A dose-dependent decrease in viability was observed in several mouse and human tumor cell lines, and knockdown of ATF4 significantly increased the antiproliferative effects of E235. Interestingly, low Î¼M doses of E235 induced senescence in many cell types, including HT1080 human fibrosarcoma and B16F10 mouse melanoma cells. E235-mediated induction of senescence was not dependent on p21 or p53; however, p21 conferred protection against the growth inhibitory effects of E235. Treatment with E235 resulted in an increase in cells arrested at the G2/M phase with a concurrent decrease in S-phase cells. E235 also activated DNA damage response signaling, resulting in increased levels of Ser15-phosphorylated p53, Î³-H2AX, and phosphorylated checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2), although E235 does not appear to cause physical DNA damage. Induction of Î³-H2AX was abrogated in ATF4 knockdown cells. Together, these results suggest that modulation of the ISR pathway with the small molecule E235 could be a promising antitumor strategy.",

In this article, we report the generation of a fiber-mutant Adv vector, using the Adv genomic DNA-terminal protein complex (DNA-TPC) cotransfection method. First, a fiber-mutant construct in a plasmid carrying the right-side two-thirds of the human adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) genome (pTR) was cotransfected with Ad5 DNA-TPC, yielding the recombinant Adv with the desired fiber mutation. The DNA-TPC from the mutant Adv was then utilized to produce a second-step recombinant Adv with an expression cassette in the place of E1. By this procedure, we generated a fiber mutant, F/K20, that has a linker and a stretch of 20 lysine residues added at the C terminus of the fiber. By using Adv carrying a reporter lacZ gene (AxCAZ2) with either F/K20 or wild-type fiber (F/wt), we examined the transduction efficiency of F/K20-Adv. No significant difference in the transduction efficiency between F/K20 and F/wt-Adv was observed for a human fibroblast line, WI-38, or various tumor cell lines, including melanoma, prostate, esophageal, and pancreatic cancer lines. In clear contrast, F/K20-Adv showed a remarkably enhanced efficiency in genetic transduction of human glioma cells. In all four human glioma lines tested, the multiplicities of infection (MOIs) for transduction of 50% of the population (ED50) were decreased with F/K20-Adv compared with F/wt-Adv: 7-fold for T98G, 14-fold for U251, 9-fold for U373, and 42-fold for U87 cells. Therefore, we attempted to apply F/K20-Adv for gene therapy of malignant glioma. Glioma cells infected with F/K20-Adv carrying genes for interleukin 2 or interleukin 12 produced a high level of each cytokine at a much lower MOI than did cells infected with F/wt-Adv. Infection with F/K20-Adv carrying the wild-type p53 tumor suppressor gene resulted in an enhanced level of p53 protein expression and an increased incidence of F/K20-Adv in transduction efficiency for malignant glioma, providing promising tools for gene therapy.",

Although psoralen plus ultraviolet A treatment is highly effective, careful follow-up cohort studies have shown that it greatly increases risk for the development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma. Strategies to reduce the risk of cancer development in psoralen plus ultraviolet A-treated populations are highly desirable. In prior studies, we demonstrated that green tea and constituent polyphenols protect against ultraviolet B-induced carcinogenesis and reduce the growth rate of established tumors in skin. In this study, we show that pre- and post-treatment with standardized green tea extract in psoralen plus ultraviolet A treatment populations abrogates the psoralen plus ultraviolet A-induced photochemical damage to skin. Intact mouse and human skin and reconstituted human skin were employed to assess the effect of both topical and oral administration of standardized green tea extract against psoralen plus ultraviolet A-induced photodamage. Oral administration of standardized green tea extract prior to and during multiple psoralen plus ultraviolet A treatments reduced hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis in murine skin. Standardized green tea extract treatment also inhibited accumulation of c-fos and p53 protein induction following a single exposure to psoralen plus ultraviolet A. c-fos and p53 positive cells in psoralen plus ultraviolet A-treated skin were found to be increased by 55.4 +/- 13. 6% and 62.3 +/- 10.5%, respectively, compared with saline-treated unexposed control skin. Oral administration of 0.4 or 0.8% standardized green tea extract inhibited c-fos protein accumulation by 18.5% and 46.2% (p < 0.05), respectively, and p53 protein accumulation by 26.1% and 54.3% (p < 0.05), respectively. Similarly proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining, a marker of cell proliferation was induced (73.7%) in psoralen plus ultraviolet A-treated skin. Oral administration of 0.4% or 0.8% standardized green tea extract 1 d after psoralen plus ultraviolet A treatment was effective in reducing psoralen plus ultraviolet A-induced inflammatory responses including erythema and edema formation. When standardized green tea extract was applied to EpiDerm, a reconstituted human skin equivalent, psoralen plus ultraviolet A-induced 8-methoxypsoralen-DNA adduct formation and p53 protein accumulation were inhibited. Topical application of 0.2 mg 8-methoxypsoralen per cm2 followed by exposure to ultraviolet A (2.5 J per cm2) resulted in delayed erythema formation in human subjects. Pretreatment of human skin with topical application of 0.2 mg standardized green tea extract per cm2 30 min prior to psoralen plus ultraviolet A treatment resulted in an almost complete abrogation of psoralen plus ultraviolet A-induced erythema. In summary, these data demonstrate that standardized green tea extract protects against psoralen plus ultraviolet A-induced phototoxicity by inhibiting DNA damage and diminishing the inflammatory effects of this modality.",

Various approaches for using bacteria in cancer therapy include the use of bacteria as sensitizing agents for chemotherapy, as delivery agents for cancer drugs and as agents for gene therapy. The tumor regression stimulated by infecting microorganisms has been attributed to activation of the immune system of the host. However, recent studies indicate that when tumor-harboring mice with defective immune systems are infected with certain microorganisms, the regression of the tumor is still observed, suggesting that there are other host factors contributing to the microbial associated regression of tumors. Since the use of live or attenuated bacteria for tumor regression has associated toxic effects, studies are in progress to identify a pure microbial metabolite or any component of the microbial cell that might have anti-cancer activity. It has now been demonstrated that a redox protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a cupredoxin, can enter into human cancer cells and trigger the apoptotic cell death. In vivo, this cupredoxin can lead to the regression of tumor growth in immunodeficient mice harboring xenografted melanomas and breast cancer tumors without inducing significant toxic effects, suggesting that it has potential anti-cancer activity. This bacterial protein interacts with p53 and modulates mammalian cellular activity. Hence, it could potentially be used as an anti-cancer agent for solid tumors and has translational value in tumor-targeted or in combinational-biochemotherapy strategies for cancer treatments. Here, we focus on diverse approaches to cancer biotherapy, including bacteriolytic and bacterially-derived anti-cancer agents with an emphasis on their mechanism of action and therapeutic potential.",

We hypothesized that reducing susceptibility of T cells to activation-induced cell death (AICD), which increases during the rapid in vitro expansion of therapeutic T cells before their infusion, might improve the persistence of adoptively transferred cells. Our investigations revealed that repetitive stimulation of the T-cell receptor (TCR) induced AICD, as a result of activating the DNA damage response pathway through ATM-mediated Ser15 phosphorylation of p53. Activation of this DNA damage response pathway also occurred upon antigen-specific restimulation in TCR-transduced TIL1383I T cells prepared for adoptive transfer to patients as part of a clinical trial. Notably, treatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) significantly reduced upregulation of the DNA damage marker Î³H2AX, subsequent ATM activation, and cell death. In the Pmel mouse model of melanoma, the presence of NAC during ex vivo T-cell expansion improved the persistence of adoptively transferred cells, reduced tumor growth, and increased survival. Taken together, our results offer a preclinical proof of concept for the addition of NAC to current therapeutic T-cell expansion protocols, offering immediate potential to improve the quality and therapeutic efficacy of adoptive T-cell therapeutics infused into patients.

Analytical studies performed with bendamustine and representative esters revealed pronounced cellular accumulation of the derivatives compared to the parent compound.

        "Doc_abstract":"The emergence of drug resistant tumours that are able to escape cell death pose a major problem in the treatment of cancers. Tumours develop resistance to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents by acquiring the ability to repair their DNA. Combination therapies that induce DNA damage and disrupt the DNA damage repair process may therefore prove to be more effective against such tumours. The developmentally important transcription factor TBX2 has been suggested as a novel anticancer drug target, as it is overexpressed in several cancers and possesses strong anti-senescence and pro-proliferative functions. Importantly, we recently showed that when TBX2 is silenced, we are able to reverse several features of transformation in both breast cancer and melanoma cells. Overexpression of TBX2 has also been linked to drug resistance and we have shown that its ectopic expression results in genetically unstable polyploidy cells with resistance to cisplatin. Whether the overexpression of endogenous TBX2 levels is associated with cisplatin resistance in TBX2-driven cancers has, however, not been shown. To address this we have silenced TBX2 in a cisplatin-resistant breast cancer cell line and we show that knocking down TBX2 sensitises the cells to cisplatin by disrupting the ATM-CHK2-p53 signalling pathway. Cell cycle analyses demonstrate that when TBX2 is knocked down there is an abrogation of an S-phase arrest but a robust G2/M arrest that correlates with a reduction in phosphorylated CHK2 and p53 levels. This prevents DNA repair resulting in TBX2-deficient cells entering mitosis with damaged DNA and consequently undergoing mitotic catastrophe. These results suggest that targeting TBX2 in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs such as cisplatin could improve the efficacy of current anticancer treatments. ",

These include, amongst others, ERBB2, C-RAF, CDK4, AKT/PKB, steroid hormone receptors, mutant p53, HIF-1alpha , survivin and telomerase hTERT. Therefore, modulation of this single drug target offers the prospect of simultaneously inhibiting all the multiple signalling pathways and biological processes that have been implicated in the development of the malignant phenotype. The chaperone function of HSP90 requires the formation of a multichaperone complex, which is dependent on the hydrolysis of ATP and ADP/ATP exchange. Most current inhibitors of HSP90 act as nucleotide mimetics, which block the intrinsic ATPase activity of this molecular chaperone. The first-in-class inhibitor to enter and complete phase I clinical trials was the geldanamycin analogue, 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin. The results of these trials have demonstrated that HSP90 is a valid drug target. Evidence of clinical activity has been seen in patients with melanoma, breast and prostate cancer. This article provides a personal perspective of the present efforts to increase our understanding of the molecular and cellular consequences of HSP90 inhibition, with examples from work in our own laboratory.

Notch activation results in the promotion of growth arrest and the onset of differentiation, therefore suggesting that specific Notch activation may regulate skin homeostasis by balancing these processes, i.e. Notch signaling functions as a molecular switch that controls the transition of cells between skin layers during the epidermal differentiation process. Recent advances in the study of Notch signaling have confirmed that there is cross-talk between the Notch signaling pathway and a variety of other signaling molecules including Sonic hedgehog (Shh), beta-catenin and the p53 family member, p63. The absence of Notch activity allows Wnt and Shh signaling to persist in a tissue where they are normally repressed. In addition, Notch counteracts the action of p63 to maintain immature cell characteristics. However, aberrant Notch signaling results in the development of psoriasis and skin cancers such as squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma. Future efforts to further define how Notch controls cell proliferation and differentiation may lead to the application of Notch in new therapies for various skin diseases.",

The mass-like clinical presentation and histologic features result in frequent misclassification, resulting in inappropriate clinical management. There are only a few reported cases in the English literature. Twenty-one patients with parotid gland solitary fibrous tumor were compiled from the English literature (Medline 1960-2011) and integrated with this case report. The patients included 11 males and 11 females, aged 11-79Â years (mean, 51.2Â years), who presented with a parotid gland painless mass gradually increasing in size or with compression symptoms, with a mean duration of symptoms of 24.7Â months. The mean tumor size was 4.5Â cm. Grossly, all tumors were described as well-circumscribed to encapsulated, firm, homogenous white to tan masses. Seven patients had a preoperative fine needle aspiration performed, with the majority interpreted to represent pleomorphic adenoma or cementifying fibroma. Histologically, the tumors were well circumscribed, although many tumors showed focally entrapped normal salivary gland acini and ducts at the edge. The tumors were cellular, arranged in haphazard short interlacing fascicles of spindled to epithelioid cells. The spindled cells showed tapering cytoplasm with monotonous, round to oval nuclei with coarse nuclear chromatin distribution. Keloid-like to wiry collagen was present between the neoplastic cells. Mitoses were identified in most cases, while necrosis was absent. Isolated, patulous vessels were present, but a well developed \"hemangiopericytoma-like\" vascular pattern was not seen. Three tumors were classified as malignant, showing marked nuclear pleomorphism and increased mitoses. When immunohistochemistry was performed, all tumors showed strong and diffuse vimentin, with a majority showing CD34, bcl-2 and CD99 immunoreactivity; all cases tested were negative for S100 protein, cytokeratin, EMA, CAM5.2, smooth muscle actin, muscle specific actin, desmin, MYOD1, myogenin, CD117, GFAP, CD31, FVIII-RAg, collagen IV, p63, p53, calponin, caldesmon, CD56, NFP, and ALK-1. The principle differential diagnoses include pleomorphic adenoma, myoepithelioma, nodular fasciitis, schwannoma, fibromatosis coli, spindle cell \"sarcomatoid\" carcinoma, and spindle cell melanoma. All patients were managed with surgery, while two patients also received radiation therapy. Metastatic disease was identified in one patient immediately after excision. All patients with follow-up were alive without evidence of disease (nÂ =Â 18), but the average follow-up is only 1.9Â years. One patient is alive with disease at 12Â months. Parotid gland SFT is a rare tumor, usually presenting in middle aged adults as a slowly growing mass. Characteristic histologic appearance with CD34 and bcl-2 immunoreactivity support the diagnosis.

The human gene maps to chromosome 15q11. This imprinted region is implicated in the pathogenesis of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), a neurodevelopmental disorder, where NDN is one of multiple genes silenced by deletion, maternal uniparental disomy or translocation. Due to this association, much interest has focused on the role of NDN in neuronal development and differentiation. However, a considerable number of studies have identified additional functions of NDN. Taken together these studies suggest a pleiotropic protein with diverse functions some of which may be relevant to tumorigenesis. Downregulation of NDN occurs in carcinoma cell lines and primary tumors, suggesting a tumor suppressor role. Our working hypothesis is that NDN is a worthy candidate for further studies with regard to a potential tumor suppressor role. In this article we outline the considerable evidence supporting the hypothesis that NDN has multiple functions, some of which indicate that it could be a tumor suppressor. The roles of NDN in key processes such as interaction with p53 and E2F-1, hematopoietic stem cell quiescence, transcriptional repression, angiogenesis, differentiation and interaction with the polycomb group gene BMI1 are discussed. Confirmation of NDN as a tumor suppressor may have implications for monitoring of PWS patients and could present a novel cancer therapeutic target.",

CIMP has been reported to be useful for predicting prognosis and response to treatment in a variety of tumor types, but it remains unclear whether or not CIMP is a universal phenomenon across human neoplasia or if there should be cancer-specific definitions of the phenotype. Recently, it was shown that somatic isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) mutations, frequently observed in gliomas, establish CIMP in primary human astrocytes by remodeling the methylome. Interestingly, somatic IDH1 and IDH2 mutations, and loss-of-function mutations in ten-eleven translocation (TET) methylcytosine dioxygenase-2 (TET2) associated with a hypermethylation phenotype, are also found in multiple enchondromas of patients with Ollier disease and Mafucci syndrome, and leukemia, respectively. These data provide the first clues for the elucidation of a molecular basis for CIMP. Although CIMP appears as a phenomenon that occurs in various cancer types, the definition is poorly defined and differs for each tumor. The current perspective discusses the use of the term CIMP in cancer, its significance in clinical practice, and future directions that may aid in identifying the true cause and definition of CIMP in different forms of human neoplasia.",

Identification of prognostic factors related to tumor biology might improve this assessment. We investigated the prognostic significance of the melanoma cell adhesion molecule (M-CAM) in EOC. Using the same antibody, M-CAM expression was tested by Western blotting in protein extracts and by immunohistochemestry in tissue microarrays generated from 133 consecutively resected, well characterized EOC samples. Fisher test, Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards analysis were used to relate M-CAM expression to clinico-pathological variables and to time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS). In vitro biochemical analysis showed a progressively increased M-CAM expression from normal to malignant cells. M-CAM protein, detected immunohistochemically, was significantly associated with advanced tumor stage, serous and undifferentiated histotype, extent of residual disease and p53 accumulation. Presence or absence of M-CAM significantly divided patients according to their TTP (median, 22 vs. 79 months, respectively; log-rank p = 0.001) and OS (median, 42 vs. 131 months, respectively; log-rank p = 0.0003). In the subgroup of advanced stage patients who achieved complete response after front-line treatment, M-CAM expression and absence of residual disease were significantly associated with shorter TTP (p = 0.003, HR 5.25, 95% Cl 1.79-15.41 and p = 0.011, HR 3.77, 95% Cl 1.36-10.49 respectively) at the multivariate level. In the same sub-group of patients, M-CAM expression remained the only parameter significantly associated with OS (p = 0.005, HR 3.35, 95% Cl 1.42-6.88). M-CAM is a marker of early relapse and poorer outcome in EOC. In particular, M-CAM expression identifies a subgroup of front-line therapy-responding patients who undergo dramatic relapses, thus helping to better select patients who might benefit from new/alternative therapeutic modalities.",

Recent data have shown that IL-24 is secreted as a glycosylated protein and functions as a pro-Th1 cytokine and as a potent anti-angiogenic molecule. In this study, we analyzed the activity of Ad-mda7 and its protein product, secreted IL-24, against human breast cancer cells. We show that Ad-mda7 transduction of human breast cancer cells results in G(2)/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death, which correlates with secretion of IL-24 protein. Neutralizing antibody against IL-24 significantly inhibited Ad-mda7 cytotoxicity. IL-24 and IL-10 both engage their cognate receptors on breast cancer cells resulting in phosphorylation and activation of STAT3, however, IL-10 receptor binding failed to induce cell killing, indicating that tumor cell killing by IL-24 is independent of STAT3 phosphorylation. Treatment with exogenous IL-24 induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells and this effect was abolished by addition of anti-IL-24 antibody or anti-IL-20R1, indicating that bystander cell killing is mediated via IL-24 binding to the IL-20R1/IL-20R2 heterodimeric receptor complex. Co-administration of the related cytokine IL-10 inhibited killing mediated by IL-24 and concomitantly inhibited IL-24 mediated up-regulation of the tumor suppressor proteins, p53 and p27(Kip1). In summary, we have defined a tumor-selective cytotoxic bystander role for secreted IL-24 protein and identified a novel receptor-mediated death pathway in breast cancer cells, wherein the related cytokines IL-24 and IL-10 exhibit antagonistic activity.",

Proline is oxidized to glutamate in the mitochondria, with the rate-limiting step catalyzed by proline dehydrogenase (PRODH). PRODH expression is inducible by p53, leading to increased proline oxidation, reactive oxygen species formation, and induction of apoptosis. Paradoxical to its role in apoptosis, proline also protects cells against oxidative stress. Here we explore the mechanism of proline protection against hydrogen peroxide stress in melanoma WM35 cells. Treatment of WM35 cells with proline significantly increased cell viability, diminished oxidative damage of cellular lipids and proteins, and maintained ATP and NADPH levels after exposure to hydrogen peroxide. Inhibition or siRNA-mediated knockdown of PRODH abolished proline protection against oxidative stress, whereas knockdown of Î”(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase, a key enzyme in proline biosynthesis, had no impact on proline protection. Potential linkages between proline metabolism and signaling pathways were explored. The combined inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2 eliminated proline protection. A significant increase in Akt activation was observed in proline-treated cells after hydrogen peroxide stress along with a corresponding increase in the phosphorylation of the forkhead transcription factor class O3a (FoxO3a). The role of PRODH in proline-mediated protection was validated in the prostate carcinoma cell line PC3. Knockdown of PRODH in PC3 cells attenuated phosphorylated levels of Akt and FoxO3a and decreased cell survival during hydrogen peroxide stress. The results provide evidence that PRODH is essential in proline protection against hydrogen peroxide-mediated cell death and that proline/PRODH helps activate Akt in cancer cells.",

We report that both TF and TR could exert inhibition of A431 (human epidermoid carcinoma) and A375 (human malignant melanoma) cell proliferation without adversely affecting normal human epidermal keratinocyte cells. Growth inhibition of A375 cells occurred through apoptosis, as evident from cell cycle arrest at G(0)/G(1) phase, increase in early apoptotic cells, externalization of phosphatidylserine and DNA fragmentation. In our pursuit to dissect the molecular mechanism of TF- and TR-induced apoptosis in A375 cells, we investigated whether cell death is being mediated by mitochondria. In our system, Bax translocation to mitochondria persuaded depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release in cytosol and induced activation of caspase-9, caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Our intricate investigations on apoptosis also explained that TF and TR augmented Bax:Bcl2 ratio, up-regulated the expression of p53 as well as p21 and inhibited phosphorylation of the cell survival protein Akt. Furthermore, TF and TR elicited intracellular reactive oxygen species generation in A375 cells. These observations raise speculations that TF as well as TR might exert chemopreventive effect through cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptogenic signals via mitochondrial death cascade in human skin cancer cells.",

To overcome this toxicity, we modified the original compound by covalently attaching a nitric oxide (NO) group. We compared the efficacy of the parental and NO-modified drugs in vitro and in vivo. The novel compound saquinavir-NO (Saq-NO) significantly reduced the viability of a wide spectrum of human and rodent tumor cell lines at significantly lower concentration than the unmodified drug. In contrast to Saq, Saq-NO had no effect on the viability of primary cells and drastically reduced B16 melanoma growth in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice. In addition, at the equivalent of the 100% lethal dose of Saq, Saq-NO treatment caused no apparent signs of toxicity. Saq-NO blocked the proliferation of C6 and B16 cells, up-regulated p53 expression, and promoted the differentiation of these two cell types into oligodendrocytes or Schwann-like cells, respectively. Although it has been well documented that Saq decreases tumor cell viability by inhibiting Akt, the anticancer properties of Saq-NO were completely independent of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway. Moreover, Saq-NO transiently up-regulated Akt phosphorylation, delivering a protective signal that could be relevant for primary cell protection and the absence of drug toxicity in vivo. It was unlikely that released NO was independently responsible for these drug effects because Saq-NO treatment increased intracellular and secreted NO levels only slightly.

In addition to this application, other approved antitumor applications for IFN-Î±2a are AIDS-related Kaposi's Sarcoma and Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) and other approved antitumor applications for IFN-Î±2b are Malignant Melanoma, Follicular Lymphoma, and AIDS-related Kapoisi's Sarcoma. In the ensuing years, a considerable number of studies have been conducted to establish the mechanisms of the induction and action of IFN's anti-tumor activity. These include identifying the role of Interferon Regulatory Factor 9 (IRF9) as a key factor in eliciting the antiproliferative effects of IFN-Î± as well as identifying genes induced by IFN that are involved in recognition of tumor cells. Recent studies also show that IFN-activated human monocytes can be used to achieve >95% eradication of select tumor cells. The signaling pathways by which IFN induces apoptosis can vary. IFN treatment induces the tumor suppressor gene p53, which plays a role in apoptosis for some tumors, but it is not essential for the apoptotic response. IFN-Î± also activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which is associated with cell survival. Downstream of PI3K is the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) which, in conjunction with PI3K, may act in signaling induced by growth factors after IFN treatment.

        "Doc_abstract":"The chemopreventive and antitumor properties of perillyl alcohol (POH) that were studied preclinically indicate that topical POH inhibits both UVB-induced murine skin carcinogenesis (squamous cell tumor models) and 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene-induced murine melanoma (transgenic models involving tyrosinase-driven Ras). A previous phase 1 clinical trial in participants with normal-appearing skin showed that topical POH cream was well tolerated at a dose of 0.76% (w/w). Here, we performed a 3-month, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2a trial of two different doses of topical POH in individuals with sun-damaged skin. Participants applied POH cream twice daily to each dorsal forearm. Baseline and end-of-study biopsies were taken from each participant to evaluate whether the topical application of POH was effective in reversing actinic damage as evidenced by normalization of quantitative skin histopathologic scores and change in nuclear chromatin pattern as measured by karyometric analysis. There was a borderline reduction in the histopathologic score of the lower-dose POH group compared with the placebo (P = 0.1), but this was not observed in the high-dose group. However, in the high-dose group, a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of nuclei deviating from normal was observed by the use of karyometric analysis (P < 0.01). There was no statistical significance shown in the lower-dose group. No changes were observed in p53 expression, cellular proliferation (by proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression), or apoptosis in either treatment group compared with the placebo group. These results suggest that whereas our karyometric analyses can detect a modest effect of POH in sun-damaged skin, improved delivery into the epidermis may be necessary.",

        "Doc_abstract":"As dermatologists, we have all been active in educating patients about sun awareness and sun protection. This is even more important for children, as childhood exposure to ultraviolet light is a significant risk for both melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers. The importance of an educational approach in appropriate sun awareness in childhood is further underscored by the recent findings by Rivers et al., in the Vancouver Moles Cohort study, presented at the 1999 American Academy of Dermatology meeting. In a placebo-controlled trial, the findings of Rivers et al. clearly demonstrated that the use of sunscreens can significantly decrease the formation of nevae in children, providing further evidence to support sun awareness education initiatives. The lead article by Gooderham and Guenther in the Basic and Clinical Sciences section evaluates the effectiveness of a particular sun awareness program, and gives valuable insights into how more effective approaches may be used in the future. In addition to ultraviolet light playing a causal role in cutaneous malignancies, it is known to induce a number of other skin problems. One particularly difficult group of disorders is the photosensitive dermatoses, including solar urticaria. Bissonnette et al. describe an innovative approach to the management of refractory solar urticaria with plasma exchange. In the Grand Rounds section, Strauss et al. review the case of an acute SLE and give an insightful discussion related to bullous eruptions in acutely ill children. The mechanism of ultraviolet-light-induced carcinogenesis involves UV-induced DNA damage. Over the past decade, it has become clear that tumour suppressor genes can regulate these processes. In the Review section, Tron et al. discuss the role of the suppressor gene p53, which is mutated or lost in nonmelanoma skin cancer. P53 is crucial in protecting keratinocytes from the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation, and in their instructive article, these authors use gene-targeted mutant mice lacking p53 to further evaluate the role in UV-induced DNA damage. With the warm weather upon us, we are spending more time in the outdoors and, as a result, are exposed to a vast number of environmental onslaughts. These include such things as Rickettsial disease, summarized in our CME section Summary Notes. Furthermore, in a comprehensive review, Dr. Sasseville examines another outdoor threat as he delineates the wide spectrum of plant contact dermatitis. This represents an important and in-depth reference on phytodermatitis. Our specialty, and indeed all of medicine, is being dramatically altered by recent advances in our understanding of disease at a molecular level. This new understanding of disease has led to the potential of modifying gene expression through the use of gene therapy. This is particularly attractive in skin disease, where gene therapy can be delivered quite readily through the skin. This advancement is insightfully discussed in the article by Somani et al., \"Gene Therapy and Dermatology,\" which is both valuable for the cognoscenti and noncognoscenti alike, and serves as an important reference work in this area.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Increased cell proliferation, which is a hallmark of aggressive malignant neoplasms, requires a general increase in protein synthesis and a specific increase in the synthesis of replication-promoting proteins. Transient increase in the general protein synthesis rate, as well as preferential translation of specific mRNAs coding for growth promoting proteins (e.g. cyclin D1), takes place during normal mitogenic response. A number of extensively studied growth signal transduction pathways (Ras, PI3K, MAPK, mTOR-dependent pathways) activate the function and expression of various components of the translational machinery. In abnormal situations, constitutive activation of signal transduction pathways (e.g. oncogenic activation of Ras or Myc) leads to continuous upregulation of key elements of translational machinery. On the other hand, tumor suppressor genes (p53, pRb) downregulate ribosomal and tRNA synthesis, and their inactivation results in uncontrolled production of these translational components. During recent years, a significant effort has been dedicated to determining whether expression of translation factors is increased in human tumors using clinical biopsy specimens. The results of these studies indicate that expression of particular translation initiation factors is not always increased in human neoplasms. The pattern of expression is characteristic for a particular tumor type. For example, eIF-4E is usually increased in bronchioloalveolar carcinomas but not in squamous cell carcinomas of the lung. Interestingly, in certain highly proliferative and aggressive neoplasms (e.g. squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, melanoma), the expression of eIF-4E is barely detectable. These findings suggest that mechanisms for increasing general protein synthesis in various neoplasms differ significantly. Finally, the possibility of qualitative alterations in the translational machinery, rather than a simple increase in the activity of its components, is discussed along with the possibility of targeting those qualitative differences for tumor therapy.",

        "Doc_abstract":"In the quest to reduce mortality and morbidity from cancer, there is continued effort to identify novel biomarkers to aid in the early detection and the accurate prediction of tumour behaviour. One group of proteins that is emerging as a potentially important group of markers in multiple tumour types is the S100 family. This review summarises the biological and clinical relevance of these proteins in relation to different tumour types.;A literature search was performed using the PubMed database and the reference lists of relevant articles. Single case studies were excluded and only reports with a clinical relevance from 1961 to 2007 were included.;The search yielded over 1000 published articles and reports. Important reports and studies were reviewed, screened and tracked for further relevant publications. Only the most relevant publications are discussed with relation to individual members of the S100 family.;There is increasing evidence that altered expression of S100 family members is seen in many cancers including breast, lung, bladder, kidney, thyroid, gastric, prostate and oral cancers. S100 proteins are commonly up-regulated in tumours and this is often associated with tumour progression. In contrast S100A2, S100A11 and S100A9 have been documented as tumour suppressors in some cancers but as tumour promoters in others. This demonstrates the complexity of the family and variability of their functions. Although the precise roles of these proteins in cancer is still to be discovered many of the family are associated with promoting metastases through interactions with matrix metalloproteinases or by acting as chemoattractants. There is also evidence that some members can regulate transcription factors such as p53. S100B already has a role in a clinical setting in the diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of malignant melanoma. As our understanding of this family develops it is likely that many more members will aid the diagnosis, monitoring and potential treatment of cancers in the future.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Protection against sun-induced damage leading to photocarcinogenesis in skin is a highly desirable goal. Among various strategies, chemopreventive approaches utilizing non-toxic agents to prevent the occurrence of precancerous lesions or their surrogate markers are potentially attractive. Epidemiological and experimental studies provide evidence that some naturally occurring chemical agents in the human diet can diminish cancer risk. Aside from water, tea is the most common beverage consumed worldwide. Black tea accounts for nearly 80% of total tea production. Black tea and green tea are derived from the same plant, Camelia sinensis. Green tea contains monomeric polyphenols known as flavanols and black tea contains dimeric flavanols and polymeric polyphenols known as theaflavins (TFs) and thearubigins (TRs). Over the past fifteen years our laboratory has been exploring the feasibility of using tea and its constitutents as an approach to skin cancer prevention. We demonstrated that green tea, black tea and constituent polyphenols protect against chemical- and ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced carcinogenesis and reduce the growth of established tumors in skin. We have also shown the efficacy of green and black tea extracts against UVB and psoralen + ultraviolet A (PUVA)-induced early damage in skin. Although PUVA is highly effective in treating certain skin diseases, careful follow-up studies of cohorts of patients have shown that similar to UVB, PUVA treatment increases the risk for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma. We have found that oral administration of a standardized green tea extract (SGTE) prior to and during treatment of SKH-1 mice diminished PUVA-induced skin hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis. SGTE-treatment also inhibited PUVA-induced accumulation of c-fos and p53 proteins and epithelial hyperproliferation. Both topical application and oral administration of SGTE after PUVA-treatment reduced skin inflammation and cell hyperproliferation. Topical application of SGTE to human skin prior to PUVA-treatment inhibited the delayed skin inflammatory response. Similarly, oral and topical administration of standardized black tea extract (SBTE) and its two major polyphenolic sub-fractions protect against UVB-induced erythema in SKH-1 mice. Furthermore, topical application of tea extracts to human volunteers protects against UVB-induced erythema. In summary, these studies indicate that tea extracts are effective in reducing UVB- and PUVA-mediated DNA damage, expression of early response genes and early inflammatory changes in skin. These studies verify a conceptual rationale for employing naturally occurring dietary constitutents as an approach to cancer chemoprevention.",

Preclinical studies demonstrated activity in cisplatin-resistant tumours and tumours with mutated p53 status. Phase I & II clinical studies gave preliminary indications of activity in melanoma, pancreatic, lung and ovarian cancers. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy and confirm the toxicity of BBR3464 when given either as first- or second-line treatment for advanced disease in patients with gastric and gastro-oesphageal adenocarcinoma. Two multicentre, open label, Gehan design studies were conducted; one study used BBR3464 as first-line and the other as second-line treatment for metastatic or locally advanced disease. Nineteen first-line and 26 second-line patients were enrolled receiving a total of 74 and 53 infusions, respectively. Initially, seven patients in the second-line study received BBR3464 using the planned schedule of 1.1 mg/m2 every 4 weeks; however, 5 of these patients experienced dose-limiting grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia; subsequent patients in both studies were treated using the modified schedule of 0.9 mg/m2, every 21 days. In 1 of 17 evaluable, previously untreated patients, regression of multiple skin lesions was noted with stabilisation of lung metastases and maxillary sinus mass, lasting 155 days. In the first-line study, the median time to progression was 85 days [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 42, 127] (2.8 months) and in the second-line study, the median time to progression was 71 days [95% CI: 42, 109] and 38 days [95% CI: 32, 73] in the 1.1 and 0.9 mg/m2 dose level groups, respectively. Toxicity data were available for 45 patients. Neutropenia was the main toxicity seen (G3: 40%, G4: 40%). Febrile neutropenia was observed in six patients (15%) treated with 0.9 mg/m2 compared with five patients (71%) treated with 1.1 mg/m2 BBR3464. Other drug-related toxicities (G3/4) included: anaemia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, mucositis and fatigue. Diarrhoea and nausea/ vomiting were adequately controlled by the use of loperamide and antiemetics, respectively. Recruitment to the second-line study was closed early due to the poor response rate (1/17 evaluable, 6%; 95% CI: 1%, 27%) and short time to progression noted in the first-line study. Further studies with BBR3464 in this tumour type are not recommended.",

        "Doc_abstract":"There is often a considerable lapse of time between the definition of what causes a disease in the laboratory and the development of successful therapy. However, the history of medicine teaches us that the need to understand the scientific basis of disease before the discovery of new treatments is both essential and inevitable. During the middle of the 19th century, the work of the great German pathologist, Rudolf Virchow, defined disease as having an anatomic or histologic basis. In the clinic, this scientific perspective would lead to increasingly effective and, often, increasingly aggressive surgical approaches to disease. Later in the 19th century, Koch's discovery of the tubercle bacillus (a discovery Virchow disbelieved and publication of which he thwarted, since he hypothesized that cancer, not microbes, caused consumption!), would define a microbiological basis for disease. With bacteria defined as a major cause of human suffering, the stage was set for the development of the discovery of effective antibiotics. In the early 20th century, the pioneering work of Banting, Best and others would show that disease can also have an endocrine or metabolic basis. This new body of scientific knowledge would lead not only to the specific discovery of insulin as an effective treatment for diabetes but also to a more general understanding of the role of hormones, vitamins and co-factors in human health and disease. Basic medical research and its successful translation into effective treatments has fundamentally altered the cause of human death. In the developed world, where access to the benefit of this work is available, infectious disease is not the problem it was in the days of Pasteur, Metchnikoff and Ehrlich. As we approach the millennium, science is now teaching us that diseases, particularly cancer, can have a molecular or genetic basis. Can successful application of this new knowledge be far behind? We are already seeing the application of this new knowledge in cancer drug screening and cancer drug development. At the NCI, for example, the old in vivo mouse screen using mouse lymphomas has been shelved; it discovered compounds with some activity in lymphomas, but not the common solid tumors of adulthood. It has been replaced with an initial in vitro screen of some sixty cell lines, representing the common solid tumors-ovary, G.I., lung, breast, CNS, melanoma and others. The idea was to not only discover new drugs with specific anti-tumor activity but also to use the small volumes required for in vitro screening as a medium to screen for new natural product compounds, one of the richest sources of effective chemotherapy. The cell line project had an unexpected dividend. The pattern of sensitivity in the panel predicted the mechanism of action of unknown compounds. An antifolate suppressed cell growth of the different lines like other antifolates, anti-tubulin compounds suppressed like other anti-tubulins, and so on. It now became possible, at a very early stage of cancer drug screening, to select for drugs with unknown-and potentially novel-mechanisms of action. The idea was taken to the next logical step, and that was to characterize the entire panel for important molecular properties of human malignancy: mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53, expression of important oncogenes like ras or myc, the gp170 gene which confers multiple drug resistance, protein-specific kinases, and others. It now became possible to use the cell line panel as a tool to detect new drugs which targeted a specific genetic property of the tumor cell. Researchers can now ask whether a given drug is likely to inhibit multiple drug resistance or kill cells which over-express specific oncogenes at the earliest phase of drug discovery. In this issue of The Oncologist, Tom Connors celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of cancer chemotherapy. His focus is on the importance of international collaboration in clinical trials and the negative impact of unnecessary bureaucracy and regulation. As a student of Tom's in the 1970s in London, working on hepatoma-specific alkylating agents at Charing Cross Hospital in collaboration with his lab on the other side of town, I can attest to the fact that the regulatory hurdles to cancer drug development just twenty years later have added immeasurably to the effort and cost of cancer drug development. However, I look with optimism to the future of cancer diagnosis, prevention and treatment. It is a future where what we are learning now about the molecular and genetic basis of cancer will find their clinical outlet just as surely as the anatomic, microbial, metabolic and endocrine basis for disease has in the past. This new knowledge will provide new techniques in molecular diagnosis, which will allow us to predict which in situ cancers are destined for malignant behavior, and which can be safely watched without the need for intervention. Individual patient risk for particular cancers will be accurately predictable, so that patients can alter lifestyle habits or begin other prevention strategies. Oncogenes and growth suppressor genes give us new targets to inhibit or replace. Tumor-specific kinases will meet their inhibitors. The oncologist will play a leading role in understanding, applying and interpreting this new information in the clinic-an exciting and challenging future!"}]
