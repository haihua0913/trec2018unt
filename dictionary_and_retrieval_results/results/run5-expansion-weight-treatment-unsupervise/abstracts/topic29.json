        "Doc_abstract":"Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are in the focus of targeted therapy for epithelial tumors. Our study addressed the role of EGFR, HER2 and HER3 expression and dimerization in esophageal cancers in situ and in vitro in the context of therapeutic EGFR and HER2 inhibitors. In archival pretreatment biopsies of esophageal carcinomas (n = 110), EGFR was preferentially expressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs) (22.4%; p = 0.088) and HER2 (34.4%; p < 0.001) with HER3 (91.5%; p < 0.001) in esophageal (Barrett's) adenocarcinomas (EACs). In situ proximity ligation assays revealed mainly EGFR and HER2 homodimers in ESCC and EAC cases, respectively. However, EAC cases also exhibited HER2/HER3 heterodimers. In vitro ESCC (OE21) cells displayed a significant response to erlotinib, gefitinib and lapatinib, with loss of AKT phosphorylation, G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. In EAC cells (OE19, OE33 and SK-GT-4), lapatinib was similarly effective in strongly HER2-positive (mainly HER2 homodimers and some HER2/EGFR heterodimers) OE19 and OE33 cells. The HER2-targeting antibodies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab) given alone were largely ineffective in ESCC and EAC cells. However, both antibodies significantly induced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in EAC (OE19 and OE33) cells upon co-culture with peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The study reveals that overexpression of EGFR and HER2 predominantly results in homodimers in ESCCs and EACs, respectively. Still, some EACs also show HER2 dimerization plasticity, e.g., with HER3. Such RTK dimerization patterns affect responses to EGFR and HER2 targeting inhibitors in ESCC and EAC cells in vitro and hence may influence future prediction for particularly HER2-targeting inhibitors in EACs.",

We selected 4 human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (TT, TE2, TE6, and TE10), and determined their expression of EGFR and HER2. We examined the ability of CI-1033 to inhibit cell growth in vitro and in vivo. EGFR and HER2 were overexpressed in all 4 esophageal cancer cells. We found that CI-1033 could inhibit the growth of esophageal cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner with the inhibition of phosphorylation of both MAPK and AKT. The oral administration of CI-1033 exerted a significant antitumor effect on esophageal cancer tumors in athymic nude mice. Our results suggest that CI-1033 effectively inhibits the growth of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma which co-expresses both EGFR and HER2 with the inhibition of phosphorylation of both MAPK and AKT.

This study was to evaluate antitumor activity of Ec-LDP-Hr-AE, a recently developed bispecific enediyne-energized fusion protein targeting both epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), on esophageal cancer. The fusion protein Ec-LDP-Hr-AE consists of two oligopeptide ligands and an enediyne antibiotic lidamycin (LDM) for receptor binding and cell killing, respectively. The current study demonstrated that Ec-LDP-Hr had high affinity to bind to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells, and enediyne-energized fusion protein Ec-LDP-Hr-AE showed potent cytotoxicity to ESCC cells with differential expression of EGFR and HER2. Ec-LDP-Hr-AE could cause significant G2-M arrest in EC9706 and KYSE150 cells, and it also induced apoptosis in ESCC cells in a dosage-dependent manner. Western blot assays showed that Ec-LDP-Hr-AE promoted caspase-3 and caspase-7 activities as well as PARP cleavage. Moreover, Ec-LDP-Hr-AE inhibited cell proliferation via decreasing phosphorylation of EGFR and HER2, and further exerted inhibition of the activation of their downstream signaling molecules. In vivo, at a tolerated dose, Ec-LDP-Hr-AE inhibited tumor growth by 88% when it was administered to nude mice bearing human ESCC cell KYSE150 xenografts. These results indicated that Ec-LDP-Hr-AE exhibited potent anti-caner efficacy on ESCC, suggesting it could be a promising candidate for targeted therapy of esophageal cancer. ",

Combination             therapies with EGFR and HER2-targeting agents and cytotoxic agents are considered             a potential therapeutic option for esophageal cancer. We evaluated the antitumor             effects of lapatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor which simultaneously inhibits             EGFR and HER2, 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) alone and in combination on esophageal cancer             cells. The antiproliferative activity of lapatinib, 5-Fu and lapatinib plus 5-Fu             was measured by MTT assay and the combination index (CI) values were calculated.             Additionally, cell cycle distribution of lapatinib alone and the combination with             5-Fu were detected by flow cytometry analysis. Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide             stain were used for analyzing the apoptotic cells after cells were treated with             either agent alone or in combination. The EGFR and HER2 activated signaling pathways             were monitored by western blotting. The combination of lapatinib and 5-Fu synergistically             inhibited cell proliferation and exhibited an enhanced proapoptotic effect on             esophageal cancer cells. The potentiation effect of combined treatment was associated             with downregulation of EGFR and HER2 signaling pathways because data from western             blot analysis showed that lapatinib in combination with 5-Fu markedly reduced             the phosphorylation of EGFR and HER2, and inhibited the activation of downstream             signaling molecules, such as AKT and ERK. A significant G1 arrest was also observed             in cell cycle analysis after exposing cells to lapatinib, however, combination             with 5-Fu did not enhance G1 arrest.

So we investigated the mutation status of EGFR and KRAS in Chinese patients with ESCC, and explored their correlations with clinicopathological features. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded surgically resected tumor samples were obtained from 50 randomly selected Chinese patients with ESCC. EGFR mutations in exons 18-21 were detected by Scorpions amplification refractory mutation system technology. KRAS mutations in codons 12, 13 were detected by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products. The correlations between clinicopathological features and the mutation status of EGFR and KRAS were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. In the present study, EGFR mutations were found in 7 (14%) out of 50 patients, including G719X missense mutation (n= 1), in-frame deletion (n= 2), and L858R missense mutation (n= 5). Six (12%) out of 50 patients had KRAS mutations in codon 12. Concurrent EGFR and KRAS mutations were detected in one sample. The presences of EGFR and KRAS mutations were not associated with gender, age, smoking history, cell differentiation, or cancer stage. In conclusion, the incidence of EGFR mutations in Chinese patients with ESCC was higher than that of previous reports, and the incidence of KRAS mutations was not low.

Multimodal programs that incorporate radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery for localized tumors may result in a modest survival advantage. However, significant strides in this disease can result from the inclusion of targeted therapies. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family represents one such target and is receiving increasing attention due to the advent of specific inhibitors. Studies conducted by us and others have shown that the overexpression of EGFR family signaling intermediates is common in Barrett's esophagus and EAC. In the latter case, EGFR expression may have prognostic significance. EGFR inhibitors, including oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies, result in a synergistic antitumor effect with chemotherapeutic agents or with radiotherapy. Therefore, several ongoing studies include EGFR-directed therapy either alone or in combination with chemoradiotherapy for this disease. Our study of gefitinib, oxaliplatin and radiotherapy suggested that gefitinib can be safely incorporated into an oxaliplatin-based chemoradiation program for esophageal cancer, although the clinical activity of this combination is modest.

Expression of EGFR and phosphorylated proteins associated with EGFR signaling pathway, i.e. p-Akt and p-Erk, were assessed with immunohistochemistry (IHC) for all patients.

Of note, significantly better overall survival was observed in patients with coexistence of high EGFR expression and low p-Akt expression (p = 0.030).Our data allowed us to put forward a hypothesis that high EGFR and low p-Akt expression may predict a clinical benefit of EGFR antagonists such as nimotuzumab combined with RT or CRT.

        "Doc_abstract":"Wnt signaling is an important evolutionary conserved pathway that is not only involved in determination of cellular development, self-renewal, and fate, but also has significant roles in tumor development and progression. Deregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and aberrant expression of its components is commonly observed in solid tumors. Such aberrant regulation of Wnt signaling is commonly related to either malfunction of its components or crosstalk with other cellular processes such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling cascade. Therefore, identification of the roles of major involved components may be useful to identify new therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. In this study, we assessed EGFR and PYGO2 mRNA expression in tumors and margin normal tissues from 55 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients using real-time qRT-PCR, and evaluated clinicopathology relative to the two genes' expression levels. Significant PYGO2 and EGFR overexpression was observed in 30.9 % (P = 0.017) and 38.2 % (P = 0.006) of tumors, respectively. PYGO2 and EGFR expression were significantly associated not only with each other (P < 0.001), but also with tumor staging and depth (P < 0.001). Furthermore, PYGO2 expression was significantly correlated with the tumor grade (P = 0.043) and size (P = 0.023). We identify PYGO2 as a new molecular marker of invasive tumors, introducing its probable oncogenic role in ESCC progression and aggressiveness. In line with other reports, we also illustrate the oncogenic function of EGFR in the development of ESCC through advance stages. We also observed a significant correlation between PYGO2 and EGFR in ESCC tumors, which reveals a mutual convergent influence of these factors in tumor progression and development. Considering aberrant expression, mutual positive feedback, and the significant clinical relevance of these genes in ESCC, we introduce them as appropriate therapeutic targets in adjuvant therapy of ESCC.",

This study investigated the efficacy of gefitinib combination with radiation in 20 elderly patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) who were not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy. Immunohistochemistry was performed to analyze epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression, and the amplified refractory mutation system was used to detect EGFR mutations. Treatment response was assessed by endoscopy and computed tomography. Treatment toxicity was evaluated using the National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria. The data showed that among these 20 patients, 5 experienced a complete response (CR), 13 a partial response (PR), and 2 had stable disease. The overall response rate (CR + PR) was 90%, the median overall survival (OS) was 14.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.0-17.9 months), and the median progression-free survival was 7.0 months (95% CI: 0-17.2 months).

        "Doc_abstract":"There exists a highly tumorigenic subset of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells defined by high expression of CD44. A novel therapy targeting these cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) is needed to improve prognosis of ESCC. CSCs of ESCC have a mesenchymal phenotype and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is critical to enrich and maintain CSCs. EGFR, frequently overexpressed in ESCC, has pivotal roles in EMT induced by TGF-β in invasive fronts. Thus, EMT in invasive fronts of ESCC might be important for CSCs and EGFR could be a target of a novel therapy eliminating CSCs. However, effects of EGFR inhibitors on CSCs in ESCC have not been fully examined. EGFR inhibitors, erlotinib and cetuximab, significantly suppressed enrichment of CSCs via TGF-β1-mediated EMT. Importantly, EGFR inhibitors sharply suppressed ZEB1 that is essential for EMT in ESCC. Further, EGFR inhibitors activated Notch1 and Notch3, leading to squamous cell differentiation. EGFR inhibition may suppress expression of ZEB1 and induce differentiation, thereby blocking EMT-mediated enrichment of CSCs. In organotypic 3D culture, a form of human tissue engineering, tumor cells in invasive nests showed high expression of CD44. Erlotinib significantly blocked invasion into the matrix and CD44 high expressing CSCs were markedly suppressed by erlotinib in organotypic 3D culture. In conclusion, EMT is a critical process for generation of CSCs and the invasive front of ESCC, where EMT occurs, might form a CSC niche in ESCC. EGFR inhibitors could suppress EMT in invasive fronts and be one therapeutic option targeting against generation of CSCs in ESCC. ",

This study aimed to examine the effects of nimotuzumab on acquired radioresistance in human esophageal carcinoma cells and to investigate its underlying mechanisms.;The radioresistant human esophageal carcinoma cell line KYSE-150R was generated by using fractionated irradiation. KYSE-150R cells were pretreated with or without nimotuzumab before ionizing radiation. Cell growth and colony formation were measured to quantitate the effects of radiation. The γ-H2AX foci assay was employed to determine cellular DNA-repairing capacity.

The average number of γ-H2AX foci increased in the irradiated cells treated with nimotuzumab. Nimotuzumab inhibited phosphorylation of the EGFR and its downstream molecules AKT and ERK. Phosphorylation of the DNA repair-related proteins DNA-PKcs, ATM, and RAD51 was also inhibited by nimotuzumab.;These results indicate that nimotuzumab can inhibit key cancer survival mechanisms, the EGFR signaling pathway, and DNA repair and thereby reverse acquired radioresistance in KYSE-150R cell line.",

A validated assay for EGFR copy number in EC is needed, to allow investigation of EGFR copy number gain as a predictive biomarker for the anti-EGFR responsive subgroup of patients. We developed a scoring system in EC based upon established systems for EGFR fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH) in lung cancer, and applied this in a series of 160 UK patients with advanced EC.;Dual colour FISH on formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsies were scored independently by two operators as: disomy (score = 1), low trisomy (score = 2), high trisomy (score = 3), low polysomy (score = 4), high polysomy (score = 5) and amplification (score = 6). EGFR FISH positive cases (scores 5 and 6) were found in 32/160 (20 %) tumours, with high polysomy in 22 (13.8 %) and amplification in 10 (6.3 %).

We show that the distribution of RHBDF2 in tylotic skin is altered in comparison with that in normal skin, and immortalized tylotic keratinocytes have decreased levels of total epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and display an increased proliferative and migratory potential relative to normal cells, even when normal cells are stimulated with exogenous epidermal growth factor. It would thus appear that EGFR signaling is dysregulated in tylotic cells. Furthermore, we also show an altered localization of RHBDF2 in both tylotic and sporadic squamous esophageal tumors.

The aim of the present study was to investigate invasion- and metastasis-related genes in esophageal carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo.;A metastasis model using a Matrigel invasion clonal selection approach was employed to establish a highly invasive subline EC9706-P4 from the esophageal carcinoma cell (ESCC) line EC9706. The differentially expressed genes of the subline and the parental cells determined by gene microarrays were further analyzed by RT-PCR and Western blotting.;We identified sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) as an invasion and metastasis-related gene of esophageal cancer. SPHK1 was overexpressed in the EC9706-P4 subline with high invasive capacity. Among six ESCC lines tested, KYSE2 and KYSE30 cells showed the highest SPHK1 mRNA and protein expressions as well as the most invasive phenotype. By Western blotting, in 7/12 cases (58%), SPHK1 expression was higher in esophageal carcinomas than in the companion normal tissue. In 23/30 cases (76%), SPHK1 protein expression was upregulated in the tumors compared to matched normal tissue by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Esophageal carcinoma tissue microarray analysis indicated that SPHK1 expression correlated with the depth of tumor invasion (P < 0.0001) and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.016). By Kaplan-Meier analysis, strong SPHK1 expression was significantly associated with clinical failure (P < 0.01), suggesting the involvement of SPHK1 in aggressiveness of human esophageal carcinoma. SPHK1 overexpression significantly increased the invasiveness of EC9706 cells in vitro and also increased EC9706 cell growth and spontaneous metastasis in vivo, promoting significant increases in tumor growth, tumor burden and spontaneous lung metastasis in nude mice. SPHK1 expression significantly correlated with the expression of many EGFR pathway genes associated with invasion of cancer cells. SPHK1 protein expression also significantly correlated with the phosphorylation of EGFR.;In summary, our data implicate SPHK1 in the metastasis of esophageal cancer. Our study also identified downstream mediators of SPHK1 in esophageal cancer cells that may mediate enhanced malignant behavior, and several of these mediators may be useful as therapeutic targets.",

Blockade of EGFR signal transduction can be a promising strategy for cancer therapy. Approximately 40-70% of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs) show high expression of EGFR. In this study, we examined the antitumor effect of gefitinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, against ESCC cells in vitro and in vivo. In three ESCC cell lines (TE8, T.T and T.Tn), cell proliferation had been inhibited in a dose-dependent manner and IC(50) values (respectively, 8.49, 18.9 and 17.3muM). Gefitinib inhibited EGF-induced autophosphorylation of EGFR and its downstream signaling pathways, Ras/Raf/MAPK and PI3K/Akt, and caused G(1) arrest of cell cycle and apoptosis confirmed with flow cytometry. We examined the effect of gefitinib on nude mice bearing established TE8 and T.T xenografts. Gefitinib (100 or 200mg/kg once-daily, p.o.) showed antitumor activity in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in a significantly improved survival of treated mice as compared with untreated mice. Immunohistochemical examination of the harvested tumor was performed to examine the status of phosphorylated EGFR, PCNA, Factor VIII and apoptosis. We found inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation, cell cycle arrest (by PCNA staining), decrease of microvessel density (Factor VIII) and induction of apoptosis by TUNEL staining.

EGFR protein overexpression was present only in 4% of the cases. The median expression of HER2 mRNA was not different between tumors and adjacent mucosa. Still, 7% of the tumors presented at least a 25-fold higher expression of this gene when compared to its paired counterpart. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that 21% of the tumors were positive for HER2 (scores 2+ and 3+), although only 3+ tumors presented amplification of this gene. Mutation analysis for EGFR (exons 18-21), KRAS (codons 12 and 13) and BRAF (V600E) showed no mutations in any of the hotspots of these genes in almost 100 patients analyzed.

This last polymorphism was also evaluated in 304 healthy controls, which presented a similar frequency (73.7%) in comparison with ESCC patients. The absence of mutations of EGFR, KRAS and BRAF as well as the overexpression of EGFR and HER2 in less than 10% of the patients suggest that this signaling pathway is altered in only a small proportion of patients with ESCC.;HER receptors target therapies may have the potential to be effective in only a minor fraction of patients with ESCC.",

For preoperative chemoradiation, only 2 of 10 randomized trials showed advanced survival compared to surgery alone, and, therefore, more Phase III trials and, consequently, meta-analyses are needed. Until now, for palliative chemotherapy, no survival benefit has been shown. This is largely due to a lack of studies and difficulties in performing randomized trials.

For esophageal cancer, most studies have been performed with EGFR inhibitors, including cetuximab, gefitinib, erlotinib and trastuzumab.

Given recent reports of TKI-responsive cases of esophageal and pancreatic cancer, this study was designed to determine the prevalence of EGFR mutations in these gastrointestinal cancers.;We sequenced exons 18 to 21 of EGFR from 21 cases of Barrett's esophagus, 5 cases of high-grade esophageal dysplasia, 17 cases of esophageal adenocarcinoma, and 55 cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Subsets of esophageal (n = 7) and pancreatic cancer cases (n = 5) were obtained from patients who were subsequently treated with gefitinib or erlotinib-capecitabine, respectively.;Mutations of EGFR were identified in two esophageal cancers (11.7%), three cases of Barrett's esophagus (14.2%), and two pancreatic cancers (3.6%). The mutations consisted of the recurrent missense L858R and in-frame deletion delE746-A750, previously characterized as activating EGFR mutations in non-small cell lung cancer. We also identified the TKI drug resistance-associated EGFR T790M mutation in an untreated case of Barrett's esophagus and the corresponding adenocarcinoma.;The presence of activating mutations within EGFR in both esophageal and pancreatic adenocarcinomas defines a previously unrecognized subset of gastrointestinal tumors in which EGFR signaling may play an important biological role.

Restoration of RAR-beta(2) inhibited growth and colony formation of esophageal cancer cells, which was correlated with COX-2 suppression. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms for RAR-beta(2)-mediated suppression of COX-2 expression using BPDE as a tool. We found that BPDE-induced COX-2 expression was through inhibition of RAR-beta(2) and consequently, induction of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1/2 (Erk1/2) phosphorylation, and c-Jun expression. Esophageal cancer cells that do not express RAR-beta(2) did not respond to BPDE for induction of COX-2. BPDE was also unable to induce COX-2 expression after RAR-beta(2) expression was manipulated in these esophageal cancer cells. Furthermore, BPDE induced time-dependent methylation of RAR-beta(2) gene promoter in esophageal cancer cells. Transfection of RAR-beta(2) expression vector into esophageal cancer cells suppressed expression of EGFR, Erk1/2 phosphorylation, c-Jun, and COX-2. In addition, co-treatment of RAR-beta(2)-positive cells with BPDE and the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 caused little change in c-Jun and COX-2 expression. This study demonstrated that BPDE-suppressed expression of RAR-beta(2) results in COX-2 induction and restoration of RAR-beta(2) expression reduces COX-2 protein in esophageal cancer cells, thereby further supporting our previous finding that RAR-beta(2) plays an important role in suppressing esophageal carcinogenesis.",

Thus, the molecular diagnosis of KRAS and BRAF mutations is clinically important in therapeutic decision making. However, the frequency of KRAS and BRAF mutations in ESCCs remains inconclusive because of the limited sample sizes of previous studies (all N ≤ 80). Pyrosequencing is a nonelectrophoretic nucleotide extension sequencing technology that can be used for mutation testing.;The frequency of KRAS and BRAF mutations was examined using a nonbiased database of 203 resected ESCCs and a high-throughput pyrosequencing assay.;The validity of the KRAS pyrosequencing method was initially demonstrated by detection of all 4 types of KRAS mutations [c.35G>T (codon 12 GGT>GTT), c.35G>A (codon 12 GGT>GAT), c.34G>T (codon 12 GGT>TGT), c.38G>A mutation (codon 13 GGC>GAC)], which had been previously diagnosed using Scorpion-ARMS technology, in 9 colon cancer tissues (9 of 9; 100 %). Similar results were demonstrated for BRAF mutational status in 3 colon cancer cell lines (HCT116, Colo201, and HT29), which were validated by Sanger dideoxy sequencing. Subsequently, the KRAS mutation was found to be extremely rare (1 of 203; 0.5 %), and the BRAF mutation was absent (0 of 203; 0 %), in the dataset of 203 ESCCs.;These results suggest that KRAS and BRAF mutations play a limited role in the development of ESCC and that mutation analysis is not useful as a screening test for sensitivity to anti-EGFR therapy in ESCC.",

In this study, we investigated acquaporin-8 expression and signaling via epidermal growth factor receptor-extracellular signal-regulated kinases1/2 in human esophageal cancer Eca-109 cells by western blot, immunofluorescence and wound healing (scratch) assays. Our results showed that epidermal growth factor (EGF) induced both Eca-109 migration and AQP8 expression. Wound healing results showed that cell migration was increased by 1.23-1.10-fold at 24 h and 48 h after EGF treatment. AQP8 expression was significantly increased (1.19-fold) at 48 h after EGF treatment in Eca-109. The EGFR kinase inhibitor, PD153035, blocked EGF-induced AQP8 expression and cell migration. AQP8 expression was decreased from 3.65-fold (EGF-treated) to 0.55-fold (PD153035-treated) in Eca-109. Furthermore, the MEK [MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)/Erk1/2]/Erk1/2 inhibitor U0126 also inhibited EGF-induced AQP8 expression and cell migration. AQP8 expression was decreased from 3.92-fold (EGF-treated) to 1.38-fold (U0126-treated) in Eca-109.

Genotyping of BCL2 (ala43thr), FAS (A-670G), CCND1 (G870A), EGF (+61A/G) and EGFR (G497A) polymorphisms were determined using the polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism methodology.

The aim of this study was to assess whether EGFR expression predicts EA staging and patient survival. Methods. In this historical cohort, consecutive patients with EA managed between 2000 and 2010 were considered eligible for the study. Surgical specimens of patients treated with transhiatal esophagectomy were evaluated to establish EGFR expression and tumor differentiation. Staging was classified according with tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) system. Survival was determined according to either medical register or patient's family contact. Results. Thirty-seven patients who underwent esophagectomy without presurgical chemotherapy or radiotherapy were studied. EGFR expression was found in 16 patients (43%). EGFR expression was more frequent as higher was the TNM (I and II = 0% versus III = 47% versus IV = 100%; P < 0.001). Average survival in months was significantly shorter in the group of patients with EGFR expression (10.5 versus 21.7; P = 0.001). Conclusions. In patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma treated with transhiatal esophagectomy, EGFR expression was related to higher TNM staging and shorter survival.

Twenty patients survived more than 6 months for a 6-month overall survival rate of 36% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 24-50%). The median overall survival was 4.0 months (95% CI: 3.2-5.9). Median progression-free survival was 1.8 months (95% CI: 1.7-1.9). One partial response and two unconfirmed partial responses were observed. Two patients experienced grade 4 fatigue.

The logistic regression analysis for treatment response with various parameters showed that only a high expression of VEGF was significantly associated with a complete response. Unlike other well-known studies, higher expression of VEGF was significantly correlated with a complete response to CCRT in this study.

For localized gastric/gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) cancer there are conflicting data that a peri-operative approach with cisplatin-based chemotherapy improves survival, with the benefits seen in esophageal cancer likely less than a 5-10% incremental improvement. Further trends toward improvement in local control and survival, when combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy are given pre-operatively, are suggested by recent phase III trials. In fit patients, a significant survival benefit with pre-operative chemoradiation is seen in those patients who achieve a pathologic complete response. In esophageal/GEJ cancer, definitive chemoradiation is now considered in medically inoperable patients. In squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, surgery after primary chemoradiation is not clearly associated with an improved overall survival, however, local control may be better. In localized gastric/GEJ cancer, the integration of bevacizumab with pre-operative chemotherapy is being explored in large randomized studies, and with chemoradiotherapy in pilot trials. The addition of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor and anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 antibody treatment to pre-operative chemoradiation continues to be explored. Early results show the integration of targeted therapy is feasible. Metabolic imaging can predict early response to pre-operative chemotherapy and biomarkers may further predict response to pre-operative chemo-targeted therapy. A multimodality approach to localized gastro-esophageal cancer has resulted in better outcomes. For T3 or node-positive disease, surgery alone is no longer considered appropriate and neo-adjuvant therapy is recommended. The future of neo-adjuvant strategies in this disease will involve the individualization of therapy with the integration of molecular signatures, targeted therapy, metabolic imaging and predictive biomarkers.",

We investigated the antitumor effects of ZD1839 alone or in combination with TRAIL against human esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) lines. Although all ESCC cells expressed EGF receptor at a protein level, the effect of ZD1839 on cell growth did not correlate with the level of EGFR expression and phosphorylation of EGF receptor protein in ESCC lines. ZD1839 caused a dose-dependent growth arrest at G0-G1 phase associated with increased p27 expression. As TE8 cells are resistant to TRAIL, we tested whether ZD1839 combined with TRAIL induced apoptosis of TE8 cells via the inhibition of EGF receptor signaling by ZD1839. ZD1839 inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt, and enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis via activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9, and inactivation of Bcl-xL. Our results indicated that ZD1839 has anti-cancer properties against human esophageal cancer cells. ZD1839 also augmented the anti-cancer activity of TRAIL, even in TRAIL-resistant tumors.

In this pilot study, we investigated the safety and efficacy of concurrent erlotinib and radiotherapy as an alternative treatment modality for esophageal carcinoma patients who are intolerant to chemoradiotherapy. Pathologically diagnosed esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients who could not tolerate concurrent chemoradiotherapy were enrolled. All patients were treated with concurrent erlotinib and intensity-modulated radiation therapy. Erlotinib was given orally for 60 days (150 mg per day). Radiotherapy (total dose, 60 Gy) was given at dosages of 2 Gy for a total of 30 times. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to assess epidermal growth factor receptor expression. Toxicities were evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0). The overall survival, progression-free survival, and local-regional relapse-free survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Between December 2007 and March 2011, 18 patients were enrolled. The median age was 71.5 years. Primary disease was stages II, III, and IV in 3, 8, and 4 patients, respectively.

We observed similar effects of EGCG in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma KYSE 150 cells and epidermoid squamous cell carcinoma A431 cells. Pretreatment of KYSE 150 cells with EGCG (20 micromol/L) for 0.5 to 24 hours in HAM's F12 and RPMI 1640 mixed medium at 37 degrees C, before the addition of EGF, resulted in a decreased level of phosphorylated EGFR (by 32-85%). Prolonged treatment with EGCG (8 or 24 hours) also decreased EGFR protein level (both by 80%). EGCG treatment for 24 hours also caused decreased signals of HER-2/neu in esophageal adenocarcinoma OE19 cells. These effects of EGCG were prevented or diminished by the addition of superoxide dismutase (SOD, 5 units/mL), or SOD plus catalase (30 units/mL), to the cell culture medium. A similar phenomenon on inactivation of EGFR was observed in A431 cells as well. Under culture conditions for KYSE 150 cells, EGCG was unstable, with a half-life of approximately 30 minutes; EGCG dimers and other oxidative products were formed. The presence of SOD in the culture medium stabilized EGCG and increased its half-life to longer than 24 hours and some EGCG epimerized to (+)-gallocatechin-3-gallate. A mechanism of superoxide radical-mediated dimerization of EGCG and H2O2 formation is proposed. The stabilization of EGCG by SOD in the culture medium potentiated the activity of EGCG in inhibiting KYSE 150 cell growth. The results suggest that in cell culture conditions, the auto-oxidation of EGCG leads to EGFR inactivation, but the inhibition of cell growth is due to other mechanisms. It remains to be determined whether the presently observed auto-oxidation of EGCG occurs in vivo. In future studies of EGCG and other polyphenolic compounds in cell culture, SOD may be added to stabilize EGCG and to avoid possible artifacts.",

We report here early results of a planned phase I/II study of gefitinib, oxaliplatin, and RT for locally advanced, unresectable esophageal cancer.;The protocol consisted of oral gefitinib 250 mg daily for 1 year plus intravenous oxaliplatin 85 or 100 mg/m(2) on days 1, 15, and 29, and RT (50.4 Gy in 28 1.8-Gy fractions). Four-quadrant biopsies were obtained at 1-cm intervals along the length of the tumor before and after treatment and the specimens were immunostained for EGFR, Erk, Akt, and their phosphorylated (activated) forms.;Enrollment was halted at 6 evaluable cases [all male; median age, 72.5 years (range, 51-75); and all with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1]. All 6 tumors were adenocarcinomas; 5 were stage III and 1 stage IVA. Oxaliplatin was given at 85 mg/m(2) in 3 cases and at 100 mg/m(2) in 3 cases. Gefitinib therapy lasted a median 24 weeks; the median number of oxaliplatin doses was 6.5. Best responses were mucosal complete response (n = 1), partial response (n = 1), stable disease (n = 1), and progressive disease (n = 3). EGFR was expressed by tumor in 5 cases and Erk and Akt in 6 cases before treatment; no changes were noted after treatment. EGFR expression did not correlate with survival or response. No grade 4 toxicities were noted; grade 3 toxicities were diarrhea (n = 1), vomiting (n = 1), fatigue (n = 1), and constipation (n = 2). Median overall and disease-free survival times were 10.8 months and 8.4 months.;Gefitinib in combination with oxaliplatin and RT was tolerable, but had limited clinical activity and did not down-regulate total or activated EGFR, Akt, or Erk in esophageal tumor samples.",

In the present study, the potential therapeutic value of nimotuzumab (an antiepidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] monoclonal antibody) in combination with chemotherapy and radiotherapy was evaluated on Eca109 and TE-1 ESCC cells, with high and low expression of EGFR, respectively. It was shown that nimotuzumab enhanced the sensitivity of Eca109 cells to other cytotoxic agents (paclitaxel and cis-platinum) and X-ray radiation, and the cytotoxicity was associated with increased autophagy. Conversely, the chemo- and radio-sensitivity of TE-1 cells showed no improvement with addition of nimotuzumab, but could be increased by combining with rapamycin, an autophagy inducer. Therefore, it was concluded that autophagic activation mediated by nimotuzumab could promote autophagic cell death and produce additive antitumor effects. ",

These changes were found not only in tumor specimens, but also in adjacent non-tumor (grossly normal) tissue specimens obtained from patients with esophageal cancer.

The overall response and treatment toxicity were analyzed using SPSS software. All the patients completed the treatment schedule. The response to treatment was assessed at treatment completion and reassessed after 1-2 months: 1 patient achieved complete response (CR), 10 patients achieved partial response (PR), 4 patients exhibited stable disease and 1 patient developed disease progression and succumbed to radiation pneumonitis (RP) 1 month later.

The 5-year survival rate of ESCC remains dismal despite improvements in treatments such as surgical resection and adjuvant chemoradiation, and current clinical staging approaches are limited in their ability to effectively stratify patients for treatment options. The aim of the present study, therefore, was to develop an immunohistochemistry-based prognostic model to improve clinical risk assessment for patients with ESCC.;We developed a molecular prognostic model based on the combined expression of axis of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), phosphorylated Specificity protein 1 (p-Sp1), and Fascin proteins. The presence of this prognostic model and associated clinical outcomes were analyzed for 130 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded esophageal curative resection specimens (generation dataset) and validated using an independent cohort of 185 specimens (validation dataset).;The expression of these three genes at the protein level was used to build a molecular prognostic model that was highly predictive of ESCC survival in both generation and validation datasets (P = 0.001). Regression analysis showed that this molecular prognostic model was strongly and independently predictive of overall survival (hazard ratio = 2.358 [95% CI, 1.391-3.996], P = 0.001 in generation dataset; hazard ratio = 1.990 [95% CI, 1.256-3.154], P = 0.003 in validation dataset).

Early metastatic disease and late diagnosis are common reasons responsible for this tumor's poor clinical outcome. The prognosis of esophageal cancer is very poor because patients usually do not have symptoms in early disease stages. Squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus frequently complicates patients with multiple co-morbidities and these patients often require interdisciplinary diagnosis and treatment procedures. At present time, neoadjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy followed by surgery are regarded as the international standard of care. Meta-analyses have confirmed that this approach provides the patient with better local tumor control and an increased overall survival rate. It is recommended that patients with positive tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy and who are poor surgical candidates should consider definitive radiochemotherapy without surgery as a treatment option. In future, EGFR antibodies may also be administered to patients during therapy to improve the current treatment effectiveness. Positron-emission tomography proves to be an early response-imaging tool used to evaluate the effect of the neoadjuvant therapy and could be used as a predictive factor for the survival rate in ESCC. The percentage proportions of residual tumor cells in the histopathological analyses represent a gold standard for evaluating the response rate to radiochemotherapy.

Four patients with locally advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma were treated with gefitinib (250 mg/day) for 14 days and pharmacokinetic (PK) studies were conducted to monitor plasma drug concentrations. Tumor cells were sampled by endoscopic biopsy prior to (baseline, day 0) and at the completion of (day 14) treatment. Cells obtained at baseline were exposed to gefitinib in short-term cell culture conditions (ex vivo assay). Western blot analyses with phospho-specific antibodies were performed to evaluate activation and biochemical response to therapy of EGFR and its downstream signaling components ERK and AKT ex vivo and in vivo. The in vivo profiles were correlated with the gefitinib-mediated alteration in proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression, a marker of cell proliferation. The correlation between EGFR expression and ERK activity was also investigated by immunohistochemical analysis in pretreatment biopsies. Mutational status of the genes encoding EGFR, K-RAS, and PI3KCA (the phosphoinositide 3-kinase catalytic subunit p110) as well as expression levels of PTEN protein were tested in order to investigate potential confounders of the gefitinib effect. All patients completed the gefitinib therapy. PK studies demonstrated constant gefitinib concentrations during the treatment, confirming persistent exposure of target tissue to the drug at sufficient levels to achieve EGFR blockade. Ex vivo culture with gefitinib resulted in distinct response patterns representing various states of activity of the ERK and AKT pathways. The results of the ex vivo studies correctly predicted the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of the agents in tumor tissue in vivo. PCNA expression correlated with ERK pathway inhibition, but not with gefitinib-mediated inhibition of EGFR activity alone. Immunohistochemical analysis performed on pretreatment biopsies correlated with Western blot analysis of EGFR and phospho-ERK expression. No mutations were identified in exons 18-21 of EGFR, exons 2 and 3 of K-RAS or exons 9 and 22 of PI3KCA. Levels of PTEN were comparable across tumors. The novel pharmacodynamic approach described in this proof of principle study may be useful to refine the patient selection to maximize the potential benefits of drugs and design individualized rational therapies for cancer patients.",

Significant tumor regression was observed in the Trastuzumab-treated EC044 HER-2 positive model (IHC 2+). A second HER-2 positive (IHC 2+) model, EC039, harbored a known PIK3CA mutation and showed strong activation of the AKT signaling pathway and was insensitive to Trastuzumab treatment, but could be resensitised using a combination of Trastuzumab and AKT inhibitor AZD5363. In summary, we established 5 PDECX mouse models and demonstrated tumor regression in response to Trastuzumab treatment in a HER-2 IHC 2+ model, but resistance in a HER-2 IHC 2+/PIK3CA mutated model.;This study demonstrates Trastuzumab-induced tumor regressions in HER-2 positive tumors, and highlights PIK3CA mutation as a potential resistance mechanism to Trastuzumab treatment in pre-clinical patient-derived EC xenograft models.",

In addition, beta-adrenoceptor is involved in the control of cancer cell proliferation. This study sought to elucidate whether a functional connection exists between these two disparate receptor systems. EGF was used to stimulate HKESC-1 cells, an esophageal squamous cancer cell line, in which beta-adrenoceptor activity was monitored by measuring intracellular cAMP levels in the absence or presence of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Results showed that EGF significantly increased cAMP levels and cell proliferation, both of which were attenuated by atenolol [(+)-4-[2-hydroxy-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]propoxy]benzeneacetamide] or ICI 118,551 [(+/-)-1-[2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1H-inden-4-yl)oxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-butanol], which are antagonists for the beta-adrenoceptor. Further mechanistic investigation revealed that the cellular release of epinephrine and the expression of its synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase were induced by EGF. The expression of beta(1)-adrenoceptor and the downstream signal transducer protein kinase A were also up-regulated. In this connection, AG1478 [4-(3-chloroanilino)-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline], an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, abrogated all these EGF-elicited alteration. Collectively, this study demonstrates that beta-adrenergic signaling could be up-regulated at multiple levels upon EGFR activation to mediate the mitogenic signals in esophageal cancer cells. This novel finding not only unveils the sinister liaison between EGFR and beta-adrenoceptors but also sheds new light on the purported therapeutic use of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in the treatment of esophageal cancer.",

H-Ras, c-Myc, or Akt, but not epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), induced transformed colonies in soft agar. By contrast, bioluminescence imaging of genetically altered immortalized esophageal cells revealed that Akt, EGFR, or H-Ras, but not c-Myc, resulted in tumor formation in immunodeficient mice. H-Ras-driven tumors showed highly tumorigenic phenotypes with 2.6 +/- 0.6 days for doubling, whereas Akt and EGFR tumors doubled every 9.5 +/- 1.6 and 6.1 +/- 1.2 days, respectively. H-Ras-driven tumors expressed the hypoxia-inducible factor target Glut1, whereas Akt- or EGFR-driven tumors had evidence of angiogenesis and no detectable Glut1 expression. Proliferation rates among these tumors were similar, but there was reduced apoptosis in the more aggressive H-Ras-driven tumors that also developed aneuploidy and multiple centrosomes. c-Myc overexpression did not result in tumorigenic conversion but introduction of Bcl-XL into c-Myc-expressing cells generated tumors. Although cytokeratin expression was typical of squamous carcinoma, gene expression profiling was done to compare the four different types of engineered tumors with human esophageal squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas. Interestingly, c-Myc plus Bcl-XL transformants mimicked squamous carcinomas, whereas H-Ras-, EGFR-, and Akt-driven tumors were similar to adenocarcinomas in their molecular profiles. These genetically engineered models may provide new platforms for understanding human esophagus cancer and may assist in the evaluation of new therapies.",

Smoking and drinking alcohol are environmental risk factors for ESCC, whereas single nucleotide polymorphisms in ADH1B and ALDH2, which increase harmful intermediates produced by drinking alcohol, are genetic risk factors. We conducted a large-scale genomic analysis of ESCCs from patients in Japan to determine the mutational landscape of this cancer.;We performed whole-exome sequence analysis of tumor and nontumor esophageal tissues collected from 144 patients with ESCC who underwent surgery at 5 hospitals in Japan. We also performed single-nucleotide polymorphism array-based copy number profile and germline genotype analyses of polymorphisms in ADH1B and ALDH2. Polymorphisms in CYP2A6, which increase harmful effects of smoking, were analyzed. Functions of TET2 mutants were evaluated in KYSE410 and HEK293FT cells.;A high proportion of mutations in the 144 tumor samples were C to T substitution in CpG dinucleotides (called the CpG signature) and C to G/T substitutions with a flanking 5' thymine (called the APOBEC signature). Based on mutational signatures, patients were assigned to 3 groups, which associated with environmental (drinking and smoking) and genetic (polymorphisms in ALDH2 and CYP2A6) factors. Many tumors contained mutations in genes that regulate the cell cycle (TP53, CCND1, CDKN2A, FBXW7); epigenetic processes (MLL2, EP300, CREBBP, TET2); and the NOTCH (NOTCH1, NOTCH3), WNT (FAT1, YAP1, AJUBA) and receptor-tyrosine kinase-phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathways (PIK3CA, EGFR, ERBB2). Mutations in EP300 and TET2 correlated with shorter survival times, and mutations in ZNF750 associated with an increased number of mutations of the APOBEC signature. Expression of mutant forms of TET2 did not increase cellular levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in HEK293FT cells, whereas knockdown of TET2 increased the invasive activity of KYSE410 ESCC cells. Computational analyses associated the mutations in NFE2L2 we identified with transcriptional activation of its target genes.;We associated environmental and genetic factors with base substitution patterns of somatic mutations and provide a registry of genes and pathways that are disrupted in ESCCs.

However, patients who achieved pathological complete response can experience more survival benefit. Therefore, it is critical to identify the responders early in the course of treatment. Published data demonstrate that clinic-histopathological factors, molecular biomarkers, and functional imaging are predictive of neoadjuvant therapy. The existing biomarkers, including epidermal growth factor receptors, angiogenetic factors, transcription factors, tumor suppressor genes, cell cycle regulators, nucleotide excision repair pathway, cytokines, and chemotherapy associated genes, need to be validated and novel biomarkers warrant further exploration. Positron emission tomography (PET) is useful for differentiating the responders of neoadjuvant CRT. The most valuable parameters and the time point of performing PET in the course of treatment remains to be elucidated. Furthermore, predictive models incorporating the multiple categories of factors need to be established with a large, prospective, and homogeneous patient cohort in the future. Standardization of staging, biomarker detection method, and image acquisition protocol will be critical for the generalization of this model. Prospective, multi-center controlled trials, which stratified patients according to these predictive factors, will help guide individualized treatment strategies for patients with esophageal cancer.

This study evaluates the role of clinical and cellular markers in predicting CR and OS in patients with esophageal cancer.;Patients were treated with infusional cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil combined with daily radiotherapy followed by esophagectomy. Pretreatment tumors (n = 54) were analyzed for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), bax, and bcl-2 expression by immunohistochemistry and for p53 mutations by direct DNA sequencing of exons 5-8. Clinical covariates included patients' age at enrollment; gender; Barrett's metaplasia; and tumor location, histology, and differentiation. Logistic regression and survival analyses were used to evaluate the predictors.;Age ranged from 32 to 75 years; most patients were male (45 male; 9 female); and tumors were distal (47 distal; 7 mid), adenocarcinoma (41 adenocarcinomas; 13 squamous cell carcinomas), and moderately differentiated (33 moderate; 6 well; 15 poor). Female gender predicted CR (odds ratio 7.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-41). The OS was 43% at 5 years. Presence of CR (P < 0.001 log rank) and p53 mutation (P = 0.051 log rank) correlated with increased OS, whereas increased EGF-R expression predicted poor OS (P = 0.009 log rank). EGF-R remained significant when adjusted for clinical covariates. There was a trend toward increased OS related to better tumor differentiation and decreased bcl-2.;These data suggest that EGF-R and p53 mutation may be used as both outcome predictors and targets for molecular therapy for esophageal cancer.",

The purpose of this study was to establish a set of indicators to identify superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients at a high risk of metastasis. In all, 271 superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma esophagectomy cases were reviewed retrospectively. The relationships between clinicopathological parameters and immunohistochemical findings (p53, cyclin D1, EGFR and VEGF) on tissue microarrays, on the one hand, and lymph node metastasis were assessed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Patients with intraluminal masses and ulcerated masses had a high risk of lymph node metastasis. Patients with superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (1) thinner than 1200 μm; (2) confined to the mucosa; (3) with submucosal invasion <250 μm; (4) with submucosal invasion ≥250 μm but with negative VEGF expression and well/moderately differentiated or basaloid histology; or (5) with submucosal invasion ≥250 μm but with weak VEGF expression and well-differentiated histology had almost no risk of lymph node metastasis. We recommend endoscopic resection for all erosive, papillary and plaque-like superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinomas where endoscopic resection is clinically feasible, and esophagectomy for all other erosive, papillary and plaque-like cases and all intraluminal masses and ulcerated tumors. No additional treatment is needed for endoscopic resection cases with superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (1) thinner than 1200 μm; (2) confined to the mucosa; (3) with submucosal invasion <250 μm; (4) with submucosal invasion ≥250 μm but with negative VEGF expression and well/moderately differentiated or basaloid histology; or (5) with submucosal invasion ≥250 μm but with weak VEGF expression and well-differentiated histology.

This prospective, single-armed, open label phase II study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of paclitaxel (T)/cisplatin (P) with nimotuzumab (N) as first-line treatment in advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Patients with pathologic confirmed unresectable locally advanced or metastatic ESCC were treated with the TPN regimen: nimotuzumab 200 mg weekly, paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) on day 1 and cisplatin 30 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 2; repeat cycle every 3 weeks for six cycles. Radiotherapy was allowed to be admitted after four cycles of TPN treatment. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). The secondary endpoint was the overall survival (OS), duration of disease control (DDC) and toxicities. From March 2011 to April 2013, a total of 59 patients were enrolled and 56 were eligible for the final analysis. Overall RR was 51.8% and disease control rate (DCR) (CR + PR + SD) was 92.9%. Local treatment (radiotherapy or surgery) followed by chemotherapy improved the duration of disease control for patients with metastatic disease and local-regional advanced disease to 8.2 months and more than 23 months, respectively. The OS for patients with metastatic disease was 14.0 months (95% CI: 6.8-21.2 months). The most common G3/4 toxicities were neutropenia (46.4%), nausea (48.3%), alopecia (78.6%), anorexia (42.8%), vomiting (55.4%), arthralgia (62.5%) and anorexia (5%). Adding nimotuzumab to the standard TP regiment was safe, and well tolerated. The TPN regimen is an effective combination as the first-line chemotherapy for the patients with advanced ESCC, and appears more active than current standard regimens. ",

We have discussed the scientific findings and the impact on practice guidelines and ongoing clinical trials. The report on KRAS status in patients with metastatic CRC receiving epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeted antibody treatment has led to a change in National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline that recommends only patients with wild-type KRAS tumor should receive this treatment. The results of double biologics (bevacizumab and anti-EGFR antibody) plus chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with metastatic CRC has shown a worse outcome than bevacizumab-based regimen. Microsatellite Instability has again been confirmed to be an important predictor in patients with stage II colon cancer receiving adjuvant treatment. Adjuvant gemcitabine therapy for pancreatic cancer was investigated by the CONKO-001 study; this resulted in superior survival as compared with observation and can be regarded as an acceptable option, without the addition of radiotherapy. The addition of bevacizumab to gemcitabine and erlotinib was not supior to gemcitabine and erlotinib for advanced disease. Second-line therapy for advanced pancreatic cancer with 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin resulted in a survival benefit. Irinotecan plus cisplatin and paclitaxel plus cisplatin result in similar survival when combined with radiotherapy for esophageal cancer. The novel fluoropyrimidine S1 appears to be active in gastric cancer, as a single agent or as combination therapy. Adjuvant intraperitoneal mitomycin-C may decrease the incidence of peritoneal recurrence of gastric cancer. Sorafenib is an effective agent in Asian patients with hepatocellular carcinoma secondary to hepatitis B; its utility in child's B cirrhosis remains to be proven.

Specifically, we postulate that novel combination treatments targeting members of the EGFR family and IGF-1R will yield significant anti-tumor effects in in vitro models of EC and TNBC possibly overcoming mechanisms of resistance. We show that the combination of HER-1 and HER-2 or HER-1 and IGF-1R peptide mimics/vaccine antibodies exhibited enhanced antitumor properties with significant inhibition of tumorigenesis in OE19 EC and MDA-MB-231 TNBC cell lines. Our work elucidates the mechanisms of HER-1/IGF-1R and HER-1/HER-2 signaling in these cancer cell lines, and the promising results support the rationale for dual targeting with HER-1 and HER-2 or IGF-1R as an improved treatment regimen for advanced therapy tailored to difference types of cancer.

These results led to several phase II encouraging therapeutic trials evaluating the combination of cetuximab with radiochemotherapy in locally advanced esophageal cancers. Numerous encouraging phase II trials evaluating cetuximab combined with chemotherapy in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma or gastroesophageal junction cancer were reported. These promising results are still to be confirmed by the ongoing phase III trials. Several studies reported HER2 overexpression in gastric cancer (7-34%), which appeared to be associated with poorer prognosis. Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular HER2 domain. The international phase III trial known as ToGA (Trastuzumab for Gastric Cancer) aimed to determine the clinical efficacy and acceptable toxicity profile of trastuzumab in combination with first-line chemotherapy in HER2-overexpressing gastric or gastroesophageal cancer.

Although 73 patients (57%) required brief hospitalizations during preoperative therapy, there were no treatment-related deaths, and 94% of patients remained candidates for resection after the completion of treatment. Six patients (6%) died after surgery.;This novel combined-modality regimen is highly active in the treatment of locoregional esophageal cancer, producing an actuarial 3-year survival of 41%. Although this preoperative regimen produced moderate acute toxicity, there were no treatment-related deaths and the large majority of patients were able to undergo subsequent esophageal resection. These results, obtained in a community-based setting and involving multiple surgeons, radiation oncologists, and medical oncologists, compare favorably with those of previous single-center and multicenter results. Further evaluation of novel combined-modality programs is warranted, as is the incorporation of epidermal growth factor receptor antagonists or other targeted agents.",

We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent method and immunohistochemistry to detect the expression of VEGF, EGFR, ES, HER-2, and NF-κBp in the serum and tissue with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and to analyze the relationship between biomarkers and clinical pathology and curative effects. Our findings were as follows: 1. The serum levels of VEGF and ES in Han patients were obviously higher than those of Uygur and Kazakh patients (P < 0.05). The VEGF positive rate in patients at a later clinical stage was higher than that of the patients at an earlier clinical stage (stages II-IV were 14.29, 50.00, and 50.00%, respectively, P < 0.05), meanwhile it was higher than that of patients without lymph node metastases (78.13 vs 25.00%, P < 0.05). The curative effective rate of patients with negative expression of VEGF was higher than that of patients with positive expression of VEGF (74.67 vs 41.40%, P < 0.05). 2. The expression of EGFR protein in male patients was higher than that of female patients (69.77 vs 35.29%, P < 0.05). Before treatment, the serum EGFR level in patients was higher than the normal group (P < 0.05). 3. The serum ES level in patients before and after treatment was significantly higher than in the normal group (P < 0.05). 4. The HER-2 positive rate in higher differentiated tumor tissue was lower than that in lower differentiated tumor tissue. (The positive rate of I, II, III grade was 70.00, 30.00, and 20.00%, respectively, P < 0.05). 5.

Lapatinib ditosylate (LAP), a dual anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anti-HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor with preclinical activity against GC, has been approved in HER2-positive breast cancer. We aimed to study the activity of LAP in HER2-amplified GC.;Patients (pts) with HER2-positive (gene amplification or increased copy numbers based on predefined criteria) advanced GC were randomly allocated 1:1 to receive LAP 1250mg per day 1-21 plus capecitabine (CAP) 2000mg/m(2) on days 1-14 of a 21-day cycle or LAP 1500mg monotherapy day 1-21 after having failed on a platinum-based first-line therapy. HER2 status was assessed centrally. The primary end-point was the objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.1). We aimed to include 38 pts per arm to show an interesting response rate of ⩾20% in either of the two arms.;37 pts were enrolled (18 to LAP+CAP, 19 to LAP). Pts had received a median of three prior treatment lines. 12 pts in the LAP+CAP group (67%) and 12 pts in the LAP group (63%) had received prior trastuzumab. Only two pts (11.1%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.37-34.7), both in the LAP+CAP arm, achieved an objective response. The study was closed prematurely for futility. Median time to progression was 42 (95% CI: 38-61) days in the LAP group and 83 (95% CI: 42-86) days in the LAP+CAP group. Other secondary efficacy end-points (progression-free and overall survival) were comparable in the two treatment groups. Rates of diarrhoea were higher with LAP+CAP (61%; 95% CI: 35-83) compared to 26% (95% CI 9-51) with LAP mono, whereas other adverse events were mostly similar between the groups (18 [100%] versus 17 [90%]).;Lapatinib showed insufficient activity in HER2-amplified pretreated advanced GC.

Sadly, advances in treatment have not followed the same trend, and the prognosis for patients with esophageal ACA remains poor, with a 5-year survival rate of only 15%. Like most cancers, early detection is the key to improving prognosis, but this outcome has proven difficult in the esophagus for several reasons: 1) patients present with advanced disease because \"alarm symptoms,\" such as dysphagia, occur at a late stage, and 2) high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and early ACA are not visible on routine surveillance endoscopy. Currently, the recommended surveillance strategy involves collection of random biopsies, an imperfect technique that is limited by sampling error and is infrequently used because of the considerable time and cost it requires. Even in patients with biopsy-proven dysplasia, adequate guidance for clinical management decisions is still lacking. Dysplasia alone is not an entirely reliable biomarker for the risk of progression to ACA because the natural history of this condition is extremely variable. Clearly, there is a need for additional biomarkers that can better characterize this disease and thus improve our ability to treat patients on an individual basis. As we better understand the molecular changes that lead to the development of this cancer, new molecular biomarkers are needed to allow for more personalized diagnoses, surveillance, and treatment. Targeted agents against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are currently being evaluated for their role in combination chemotherapy for metastatic esophageal ACA. As these studies progress, a reliable approach for determining receptor status in individual patients is essential. Molecular imaging uses fluorescent probes that target specific cell-surface receptors, and has the potential to evaluate an individual patient's gene expression profile. By topically applying fluorescent probes to dysplastic epithelium during endoscopy, a variety of receptors can be visualized, and the response to treatment can be monitored in real time. This technique can mitigate the limitations of current surveillance protocols, allow for improved cancer detection, and be used for personalized treatment in the future.",

As a result of its potential role in the selection of therapy, HER-2/neu testing has reached near-standard-of-practice status in breast cancer. There is considerable interest in HER-2/neu as a prognostic factor and target of therapy in tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. In this review of HER-2/neu expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinomas of the esophagus, stomach, and colon, a wide range of expression of HER-2/neu from 0 to 83% likely reflects both differences in methods and reagents, as well as study bias associated with patient selection (i.e., early versus advanced disease). For esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, little information exists as to the prognostic significance of HER-2/neu expression. In adenocarcinoma associated with Barrett's esophagus there is contradictory data. However, most of the information available indicates that this marker has significant prognostic value. In gastric adenocarcinoma, the wide expression range may truly reflect patient selection because HER-2/neu positivity appears linked to advanced rather than early disease with limited invasion. The majority of studies favor a significant prognostic value of HER-2/neu status for this tumor. Finally, in colorectal cancer HER-2/neu overexpression also appears to be a significant adverse outcome indicator as judged by the current published literature. In conclusion, given that either HER-2/neu protein overexpression or gene amplification is associated with approximately one-fourth of all gastrointestinal tract malignancies, strategies designed to employ the marker in therapy selection appear warranted. During the next several years it will not be surprising to see these tumors treated with antiHER-2/neu modalities such as Herceptin, likely in combination with other agents initially for patients with advanced disease, and possibly for individuals with high-risk lesions in an adjuvant setting.",

Recently, an important role for TGFβ signaling has been described in the crosstalk between epithelial and stromal cells regulating squamous tumor cell invasion in mouse models of head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Loss of TGFβ signaling, in either compartment, leads to HNSCC however, the mechanisms involved are not well understood. Using organotypic reconstruct cultures (OTC) to model the interaction between epithelial and stromal cells that occur in dysplastic lesions, we show that loss of TGFβ signaling promotes an invasive phenotype in both fibroblast and epithelial compartments. Employing immortalized esophageal keratinocytes established to reproduce common mutations of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, we show that treatment of OTC with inhibitors of TGFβ signaling (A83-01 or SB431542) enhances invasion of epithelial cells into a fibroblast-embedded Matrigel/collagen I matrix. Invasion induced by A83-01 is independent of proliferation but relies on protease activity and expression of ADAMTS-1 and can be altered by matrix density. This invasion was associated with increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL1 and EGFR ligands HB-EGF and TGFα. Altering EGF signaling prevented or induced epithelial cell invasion in this model. Loss of expression of the TGFβ target gene ROBO1 suggested that chemorepulsion may regulate keratinocyte invasion. Taken together, our data show increased invasion through inhibition of TGFβ signaling altered epithelial-fibroblasts interactions, repressing markers of activated fibroblasts, and altering integrin-fibronectin interactions. These results suggest that inhibition of TGFβ signaling modulates an array of pathways that combined promote multiple aspects of tumor invasion. ",

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is one of the most important cytokines which has been shown to play a critical role in cholesteatoma. In this investigation, we studied the effects of EGF on the proliferation of keratinocytes and EGF-mediated signaling pathways underlying the pathogenesis of cholesteatoma. We examined the expressions of phosphorylated EGF receptor (p-EGFR), phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), cyclinD1, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in 40 cholesteatoma samples and 20 samples of normal external auditory canal (EAC) epithelium by immunohistochemical method. Furthermore, in vitro studies were performed to investigate EGF-induced downstream signaling pathways in primary external auditory canal keratinocytes (EACKs). The expressions of p-EGFR, p-Akt, cyclinD1, and PCNA in cholesteatoma epithelium were significantly increased when compared with those of control subjects. We also demonstrated that EGF led to the activation of the EGFR/PI3K/Akt/cyclinD1 signaling pathway, which played a critical role in EGF-induced cell proliferation and cell cycle progression of EACKs. Both EGFR inhibitor AG1478 and PI3K inhibitor wortmannin inhibited the EGF-induced EGFR/PI3K/Akt/cyclinD1 signaling pathway concomitantly with inhibition of cell proliferation and cell cycle progression of EACKs. Taken together, our data suggest that the EGFR/PI3K/Akt/cyclinD1 signaling pathway is active in cholesteatoma and may play a crucial role in cholesteatoma epithelial hyper-proliferation. This study will facilitate the development of potential therapeutic targets for intratympanic drug therapy for cholesteatoma. ",

Although recurrent mutations have been characterized in EAC, little is known about their clinical and prognostic significance. Aneuploidy is predictive of clinical outcome in many malignancies but has not been evaluated in superficial EAC.;We quantified copy number changes in 41 superficial EAC using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays. We identified recurrent chromosomal gains and losses and calculated the total copy number abnormality (CNA) count for each tumor as a measure of aneuploidy. We correlated CNA count with overall survival and time to first recurrence in univariate and multivariate analyses.;Recurrent segmental gains and losses involved multiple genes, including: HER2, EGFR, MET, CDK6, KRAS (recurrent gains); and FHIT, WWOX, CDKN2A/B, SMAD4, RUNX1 (recurrent losses). There was a 40-fold variation in CNA count across all cases. Tumors with the lowest and highest quartile CNA count had significantly better overall survival (p = 0.032) and time to first recurrence (p = 0.010) compared to those with intermediate CNA counts. These associations persisted when controlling for other prognostic variables.;SNP arrays facilitate the assessment of recurrent chromosomal gain and loss and allow high resolution, quantitative assessment of segmental aneuploidy (total CNA count). The non-monotonic association of segmental aneuploidy with survival has been described in other tumors. The degree of aneuploidy is a promising prognostic biomarker in a potentially curable form of EAC.",

The patients in the chemoradiotherapy group received 5-fluorouracil combined with cisplatin plus 60 Gy of radiation, and those in the surgery group received an esophagectomy with radical node dissection. Biologic markers were investigated immunohistochemically using pretreatment biopsy specimens.;The baseline clinical TNM stage was more advanced in the chemoradiotherapy group than in the surgery group. With a median follow-up period of 43 months, the 5-year survival rate was 46% in the chemoradiotherapy and 51% in the surgery group, without statistical significance (p = 0.47, log-rank test). Cox regression analysis for prognosis revealed that epidermal growth factor receptor positivity, high microvessel density, and cyclin D1 positivity yielded a low value for relative risk (0.66, 0.54, and 0.62, respectively), which favored chemoradiotherapy over surgery, without statistical significance.;This nonrandomized study showed a trend for the chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of esophageal carcinoma, but the results need to be confirmed by additional study.",

A standardized modified scoring system was recently introduced for gastroesophageal HER2 scoring. We aimed to validate this scoring system, including an analysis of interobserver variability of immunohistochemistry (IHC) scoring.;In total, 323 patients with histologically confirmed invasive gastric or esophageal adenocarcinoma were examined for HER2 by IHC and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH).

Interobserver variability on IHC scoring using the currently standard modified HER2 scoring system was determined among three clinical pathologists. Clinicopathologic characteristics were retrospectively retrieved from the patient records.;HER2 positivity was found in 50 (15.5%) of 323 patients. Interobserver agreement on IHC scoring was high (κ = 0.78). Most disagreement was found in diffuse or mixed tumor types and in weak to moderate stained samples (IHC 2 +).

From April 2000 to January 2005, 11 patients with squamous or adenocarcinoma of the esophagus were enrolled. Patients received either 50, 100 or 150 mg oral erlotinib/day beginning on the first day of radiation (three patients in each dose cohort). Concurrent cisplatin (75 mg/m2 i.v., days 8 and 36) and 5-FU (1000 mg/m2 i.v., days 8-11 and 36-39) were also given with 50.4 Gy thoracic radiation, delivered at 180 cGy/day, 5 days/week. Toxicity was evaluated using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0). Erlotinib with concurrent 5-FU, cisplatin and thoracic radiation was well-tolerated at 50, 100 and 150 mg/day. The major toxicities were diarrhea (grade 1=18%, grade 2=18%), skin rash (grade 4=54.5%), nausea (grade 1=18%, grade 2=54%, grade 3=9%) and dehydration (grade 3=27%). All patients experienced esophagitis during treatment (grade 1=55%, grade 2=32%, grade 3=9%, grade 4=9%). Two patients were discontinued from the study secondary to non-erlotinib-related toxicities. We conclude that the phase I study demonstrates the safety and tolerability of erlotinib delivered at 150 mg/day with concurrent 5-FU, cisplatin and thoracic radiation. The major toxicities encountered were grade 1-2 diarrhea, grade 1 skin rash, grade 1-3 nausea and grade 3 dehydration. A phase II study is planned.",

Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or GEJ is an aggressive disease with early lymphatic and hematogenous dissemination. Molecular pathology has revealed many molecular mechanisms of disease progression, which are related to prognosis. Some of these factors can be seen as prognostic factors per se. Better knowledge of molecular bases may lead to new paradigms, improved prognostication, early diagnosis and individually tailored therapeutic options.;A review of recent English literature (1990-October 2005) concerning esophageal adenocarcinoma was performed. This review focuses on genetic and molecular changes as prognosticators of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and GEJ.;A bewildering number of biomarkers have been described. Many genes and molecules have prognostic impact (cyclin D1, EGFR, Her-2/Neu, APC, TGF-beta, Endoglin, CTGF, P53, Bcl-2, NF-kappaB, Cox-2, E-cadherin, beta-catenin, uPA, MMP-1,3,7,9, TIMP, T( h )1/T( h )2 balance, CRP, PTHrP).;Adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and GEJ show multiple genetic alterations, which indicate that progression of cancer is a multistep complex process with many different alterations. Presumably, it is not one molecular factor that can predict the biological behavior of this cancer. The combination of diverse genetic alterations may better predict prognosis. In future, gene expression analysis with microarrays may reveal important prognostic information and the discovery of new genes and molecules associated with tumor progression and dissemination will enhance prognostication and offers adjuvant therapeutic options.",

Adverse effects affecting kidneys consist in an increase or a new onset proteinuria, a decrease of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and/or a proximal renal tubular dysfunction (PRTD) that rarely leads to Fanconi's syndrome. EACS guidelines propose to screen PRTD in patients with chronic renal insufficiency, with a sudden decrease of eGFR, with hypophosphataemia (if non-renal causes such as vitamin D deficiency are excluded) and with a new onset proteinuria. We aim to evaluate the prevalence of PRTD by comparing the group of patients under TDF to the group free of TDF, in our cohort of 300 patients. We also aim to evaluate the accuracy of EACS criteria for screening PRTD in routine settings and to assess the utility of urinary samples in PRTD diagnosis.;During two consecutive years, we collected annually blood and urine samples at the same time in our outpatient clinic. We assessed kidney function, plasma levels and fractional excretion of phosphate, uric acid, potassium, plasma glucose and proteinuria. PRTD was defined by the presence of at least two out of the five following criteria: fractional excretion (FE) of phosphate >20% (or >10% when serum phosphate <0.8 mmol/L), non-diabetic glycosuria (positive urine glucose with plasma glucose <70 mg/dL), renal tubular acidosis (urinary pH >5.5 and serum bicarbonate <21 mmol/L), uric acid FE >10% or potassium FE >10%. After the first year, patients with TDF regimen who were diagnosed with PRTD were shifted to TDF-free regimen and included again in the study.;For PRTD (first line), they are expressed in number of diagnoses/total number of patients in this group. The second line resumes the number of PRTD diagnose patients who should have been screened according to EACS criteria.;PRTD screening according to EACS criteria is not sufficient to diagnose every case, especially minor PRTD, mainly because the prevalence is low and its diagnosis remains difficult in routine settings. We recommend performing a urine test including proteinuria every year for patients undergoing TDF treatment. The next step will be to follow PRTD patients to evaluate the time laps until full recovery after TDF shift.",
