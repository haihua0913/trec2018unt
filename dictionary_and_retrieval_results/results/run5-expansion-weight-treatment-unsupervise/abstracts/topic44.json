An increased BRAF copy number was found in 18/47 primary samples tested; 15 of them (83.3%) were pilocytic astrocytomas. A BRAF mutation was found in 3/48 primary tumors, all with a normal BRAF copy number and no GNAQ mutation. One sample had a GNAQ209 mutation (Q209P626) with a normal BRAF gene; none of the tumors had a GNA11Q209 mutation. Recurrent or progressive tumors, analyzed in four patients, had the same molecular genotype as their primary. Increased BRAF copy number and activating BRAF mutations may be involved in the development of low-grade glioma via overactivation of the Ras/Raf pathway.

In addition, BRAF is mutated in the majority of low-grade gliomas and its expression and activity is significantly increased in the majority of high-grade gliomas. Although the importance of RTKs and RAS signaling in glioma development has been shown, the role of BRAF has yet to be characterized. We evaluated the effect of activated BRAF in glioma formation using the retroviral replication-competent avian leukosis virus long terminal repeat, splice acceptor (RCAS)/TVA system to transfer genes encoding activated forms of BRAF, KRas, Akt and Cre to nestin-expressing neural progenitor cells in Ink4a/Arf(lox/lox) mice in vivo. Although expression of activated BRAF alone is not sufficient for tumorigenesis, the combination of activated BRAF and Akt or BRAF with Ink4a/Arf loss is transforming. Interestingly, activated BRAF generates gliomas with characteristics similar to activated KRas in the context of Akt but not Ink4a/Arf loss.

A four-tiered WHO grading scheme has been successfully applied to a spectrum of diffusely infiltrative astrocytomas, but it is not fully applicable to other gliomas, including oligodendrogliomas and ependymomas. Recent genetic studies have revealed that the major categories of gliomas, such as circumscribe astrocytomas, infiltrating astrocytomas/oligodendrogliomas, and glioblastoma, roughly correspond to major genetic alterations, including isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) 1/2 mutations, TP53 mutations, co-deletion of chromosome arms 1p/19q, and BRAF mutation/fusion. These genetic alterations are clinically significant in terms of the response to treatment(s) and/or the prognosis. It is, thus, rational that future classification of gliomas should be based on genotypes, rather than phenotypes, although the genetic features of each tumor are not sufficiently understood at present to draw a complete map of the gliomas, and genetic testing is not yet available worldwide, particularly in Asian and African countries. This review summarizes the current concepts of the WHO classification, as well as the current understanding of the major genetic alterations in glioma and the potential use of these alterations as diagnostic criteria.",

Despite the lack of a complete understanding of the biology of these tumors, significant advances have been made in the past decades. One of the key discoveries made in the area of malignant gliomas is that these tumors can be induced and maintained by aberrant signaling networks. In this context, the Ras pathway has been extensively exploited, from both basic and translational perspectives. Although somatic oncogenic mutations of Ras genes are frequent in several cancer types, early investigations on gliomas revealed disappointing facts that the Ras mutations are nearly absent in malignant gliomas and that the BRAF mutations are present in a very small percentage of gliomas. Therefore, the observed deregulation of the Ras-RAF-ERK signaling pathway in gliomas is attributed to its upstream positive regulators, including, EGFR and PDGFR known to be highly active in the majority of malignant gliomas. In contrast to the initial negative results on the somatic mutations of H-Ras, K-Ras and BRAF, recent breakthrough studies on pediatric low-grade astrocytomas uncovered genetic alterations of the BRAF gene involving copy number gains and rearrangements. The 7q34 rearrangements result in a novel in-frame KIAA1549:BRAF fusion gene that possesses constitutive BRAF kinase activity resembling oncogenic BRAF (V600E). In light of the earlier findings and recent breakthroughs, this review summarizes our current understanding of the Ras-RAF-ERK signaling pathway in gliomas and the outcome of preclinical and clinical studies that evaluated the efficacy of Ras-targeted therapy in malignant gliomas.",

Exome sequencing and array CGH were performed on available samples followed by detailed genetic analysis of the entire sHGG cohort. Clinical and outcome data of genetically distinct subgroups were obtained.;sHGG was observed in 2.9% of PLGGs (26 of 886 patients). Patients with sHGG had a high frequency of nonsilent somatic mutations compared with patients with primary pediatric high-grade glioma (HGG; median, 25 mutations per exome; P = .0042).

        "Doc_abstract":"Brain tumors are the most common solid pediatric malignancy. For high-grade, recurrent, or refractory pediatric brain tumors, radiation therapy (XRT) is an integral treatment modality. In the era of personalized cancer therapy, molecularly targeted agents have been designed to inhibit pathways critical to tumorigenesis. Our evolving knowledge of genetic aberrations in pediatric gliomas is being exploited with the use of specific targeted inhibitors. These agents are additionally being combined with XRT to increase the efficacy and duration of local control. In this review, we discuss novel agents targeting three different pathways in gliomas, and their potential combination with XRT. BRAF is a serine/threonine kinase in the RAS/RAF/MAPK kinase pathway, which is integral to cellular division, survival, and metabolism. Two-thirds of pilocytic astrocytomas, a low-grade pediatric glioma, contain a translocation within the BRAF gene called KIAA1549:BRAF that causes an overactivation of the MEK/MAPK signaling cascade. In vitro and in vivo data support the use of MEK or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors in low-grade gliomas expressing this translocation. Additionally, 15-20% of high-grade pediatric gliomas express BRAF V600E, an activating mutation of the BRAF gene. Pre-clinical in vivo and in vitro data in BRAF V600E gliomas demonstrate dramatic cooperation between XRT and small molecule inhibitors of BRAF V600E. Another major signaling cascade that plays a role in pediatric glioma pathogenesis is the PI3-kinase (PI3K)/mTOR pathway, known to be upregulated in the majority of high- and low-grade pediatric gliomas. Dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors are in clinical trials for adult high-grade gliomas and are poised to enter studies of pediatric tumors. Finally, many brain tumors express potent stimulators of angiogenesis that render them refractory to treatment. An analog of thalidomide, CC-5103 increases the secretion of critical cytokines of the tumor microenvironment, including IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-10, and is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of recurrent or refractory pediatric central nervous system tumors. In summary, several targeted inhibitors with radiation are currently under investigation in both translational bench research and early clinical trials. This review article summarizes the molecular rationale for, and the pre-clinical data supporting the combinations of these targeted agents with other anti-cancer agents and XRT in pediatric gliomas. In many cases, parallels are drawn to molecular mechanisms and targeted inhibitors of adult gliomas. We additionally discuss the potential mechanisms underlying the efficacy of these agents.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The tumors classified as gliomas include a wide variety of histologies including the more common (astrocytoma, glioblastoma), as well as the less common histologies (oligodendroglioma, mixed oligoastrocytoma, pilocytic astrocytoma). Recent efforts at comprehensive genetic characterization of various primary brain tumor types have identified a number of common alterations and pathways common to multiple tumor types. Common pathways in glioma biology include growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases and their downstream signaling via the MAP kinase cascade or PI3K signaling, loss of apoptosis through p53, cell cycle regulation, angiogenesis via VEGF signaling, and invasion. However, in addition to these common general pathway alterations, a number of specific alterations have been identified in particular tumor types, and a number of these have direct therapeutic implications. These include mutations or fusions in the BRAF gene seen in pilocytic astrocytomas (and gangliogliomas). In oligodendrogliomas, mutations in IDH1 and codeletion of chromosomes 1p and 19q are associated with improved survival with upfront use of combined chemotherapy and radiation, and these tumors also have unique mutations of CIC and FUBP1 genes. Low grade gliomas are increasingly seen to be divided into two groups based on IDH mutation status, with astrocytomas developing through IDH mutation followed by p53 mutation, while poor prognosis low grade gliomas and primary glioblastomas (GBMs) are characterized by EGFR amplification, loss of PTEN, and loss of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. GBMs can be further characterized based on gene expression and gene methylation patterns into three or four distinct subgroups. Prognostic markers in diffuse gliomas include IDH mutation, 1p/19q codeletion, and MGMT methylation, and MGMT is also a predictive marker in elderly patients with glioblastoma treated with temozolomide monotherapy.

Neither 1p, 9p, and 10q nor 19q showed significant association with outcome in PAs, although p16 deletion was more common in PAs of the midbrain, brainstem, and spinal cord. Loss of heterozygosity on 17p13 correlated with increased risk of recurrence in cerebellar tumors. BRAF gene rearrangements were more common in cerebellar tumors than non-cerebellar tumors and associated with classic biphasic histology in the cerebellum. However, clinical outcome was independent of BRAF status. The molecular biology of PAs differs according to location, yet BRAF rearrangements do not appear to produce PAs with different behavior. Nevertheless, such tumors may have altered sensitivity to pathway-specific adjuvant therapy. Additionally, deletion on 17p13 may be an adverse prognostic biomarker in cerebellar tumors.",

Furthermore, the levels of phospho-mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK), a downstream effector of RAS, are also increased. In mice, activated KRas cooperates with the loss of INK4a-ARF locus or with activated Akt to induce gliomas, confirming an important role for this pathway in glioma biology. However, to correctly target therapies against the RAS signaling pathway, it is necessary to identify the effectors that contribute to RAS-mediated gliomagenesis. In this study, we investigated the contribution of RAF signaling in glioma oncogenesis. We find that the levels of RAF-1 and BRAF proteins and RAF kinase activity are increased in human GBM samples. We confirm the importance of this finding by demonstrating a causal role for a constitutively active Raf-1 mutant in glioma formation in mice. Specifically, we find that activated Raf-1 cooperates with Arf loss or Akt activation to generate gliomas similar to activated KRas under the same conditions. Our study suggests that the oncogenic effect of KRas in glioma formation may be transduced at least in part through Raf signaling and that therapeutic targeting of this pathway may be beneficial in glioma treatment.",

There have been many advances over the last two decades as we widen our search for a molecular basis of gliomagenesis. Many biomarkers have been discovered to be important in the management of gliomas, including 1p19q co-deletion, MGMT promoter methylation, BRAF and IDH1 mutations. In this review, we attempt to summarise the available literature on these biomarkers and their use in the diagnosis and management of gliomas. We pay special attention to the recently discovered IDH1 mutation, which is already proving to be a valuable new marker for favourable prognosis and may also indicate a greater response to therapy. 1p19q co-deletions have been shown to delineate a clinically distinct tumour type and are now routinely tested for in certain situations and can help direct treatment. MGMT promoter methylation is one of the most commonly studied biomarkers in gliomas. It has been shown to be a strong positive prognostic marker in gliomas, with positive tumours being more sensitive to chemotherapy. However, a lack of alternatives means that it is not yet a routine mutation tested for clinically. BRAF mutations are new markers found in pilocytic astrocytomas. Although the prognostic value of such mutations is not yet known, they may play a significant role in the diagnosis and treatment of such tumours. IDH1 mutations are 'the new kid on the block' and seem to play a central role in the pathogenesis of gliomas. They represent an independent and favourable prognostic marker and are a new molecular marker for disease diagnosis. Its role in determining response to chemotherapy is still controversial but with further study, IDH1 mutations may prove to be an invaluable marker in the management of gliomas.",

This can be particularly challenging with small biopsies that often yield limited amounts of tissue for pathologic study, especially considering the marked differences in prognosis and therapy after a pathologic diagnosis. This paper will review some basic principles of gliosis as an astrocytic reaction to a wide range of central nervous system insults and focus on some common diagnostic pitfalls such as (1) gliosis associated with brain tumor mimics, including demyelinating disease and infections, (2) gliosis associated with nonglial tumors such as craniopharyngioma, hemangioblastoma, metastases, and central nervous system lymphoma. New diagnostic methods have facilitated the differentiation between reactive astrocytosis and the diffuse gliomas. Of these, the use of mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH-1) as a marker of diffuse infiltrating astroctomas, oligodendrogliomas, and a subset of glioblastomas (secondary glioblastomas) is particularly exciting for tissue diagnosis and patient prognosis. In addition IDH-1 may be useful to distinguish a diffuse infiltrating glioma from low-grade \"focal\" neoplasms such as the pilocytic astocytoma in histologically ambiguous cases. The discovery of BRAF mutations as molecular signatures of some pilocytic astrocytomas, gangliogliomas, and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas has provided another diagnostic tool for the pathologist. Only after a definitive diagnosis of a diffuse infiltrating glioma or a focal glioma is made should a tumor grade be applied and some practical issues in current glioma grading are provided.",

In recent years molecular studies have identified a number of genetic and epigenetic markers that could contribute to an improved tumor classification and better prediction of response to therapy and prognosis in the individual patient. The most important molecular tests with differential diagnostic relevance in patients with astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors include the detection of genetic mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), IDH2, alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX), histone H3.3 (H3F3A) and v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) genes as well as the demonstration of codeletions of chromosomal arms 1p and 19q. Important predictive markers that have been linked to the response to alkylating chemotherapy are O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation in glioblastoma patients and 1p/19q codel status in anaplastic glioma patients. Oncogenic c11orf95/RELA fusion gene formation is characteristic for a subgroup of patients with supratentorial ependymoma. In addition to diagnostic testing of individual genes, novel microarray and next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques show promising perspectives in glioma diagnostics. The assessment of DNA methylation profiles using DNA methylation arrays representing 450,000 CpG dinucleotides distributed throughout the human genome (450 k array test) now allows the robust molecular classification of gliomas into clinically relevant entities and variants. Moreover, glioma-associated gene panel NGS promises the timely parallel sequencing of relevant diagnostic and predictive marker genes in a single test. It will now be a major task to integrate these novel results and techniques into the conventional histological procedures in the up-coming revision of the WHO classification. ",

Among all, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation, 1p/19q codeletion, and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutations have been identified as favorable prognostic markers. MGMT promoter methylation is the only potential predictive marker for response to temozolomide and alkylating agents in glioblastoma (GBM), but it is not of assistance in diagnostics. IDH1 mutations and 1p/19q codeletion are also useful for classifying and grading gliomas, since 1p/19q codeletion is tightly linked to oligodendroglial lineage, and IDH1 mutations are restricted to grade II/III gliomas, while not to primary GBM.

High-throughput profiling techniques for gene expression and epigenetic modification have provided new subtype classifications for GBM as well as lower grade gliomas, which may be of prognostic and predictive values. Efforts to identify molecular markers that predict the benefits of novel molecularly targeted treatments will enable better patient stratification and individualization of treatment.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Gliomas are the most frequent tumors of the central nervous system. The WHO classification, based on the presumed cell origin, distinguishes astrocytic, oligodendrocytic and mixed gliomas. A grading system is based on the presence of the following criteria: increased cellular density, nuclear atypias, mitosis, vascular proliferation and necrosis. The main histological subtype of grade I gliomas are pilocytic astrocytomas, which are benign. Diffuse astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas and oligoastrocytomas are low-grade (II) or high-grade (III and IV) tumors. Glioblastomas correspond to grade IV astrocytomas. C. Daumas-Duport et al. have proposed another classification based on histology and imaging data, which distinguishes oligodendrogliomas and mixed gliomas of grade A (without endothelial proliferation and/or contrast enhancement), oligodendrogliomas and mixed gliomas of grade B (with endothelial proliferation or contrast enhancement), glioblastomas and glioneuronal malignant tumors. Both classifications lack reproducibility. Many studies have searched for a molecular classification. Recurrent abnormalities in gliomas have been found. They encompassed recurrent chromosomal alterations, such as lost of chromosome 10, gain of chromosome 7, deletion of chromosome 1p and 19q, but also activation of the Akt pathway (amplification of EGFR), dysregulation of the cell cycle (deletion of p16, p53). These studies have enabled the description of two molecular subtypes for glioblastomas. De novo glioblastomas, which occur in young patients without of a prior history of brain tumor and harbor frequent amplification of EGFR, deletion of p16 and mutation of PTEN while mutation of p53 is infrequent. Secondary glioblastomas occur in the context of a preexisting low-grade glioma and are characterized by more frequent mutation of p53. On the other side, combined complete deletion of 1p and 19q as the result of the translocation t(1;19)(q10;p10) is highly specific of oligodendrogliomas. However, histological and molecular classifications do not always correspond as many alterations are shared by high-grade tumors, whatever their histological type. Besides, few molecular alterations have a prognostic value. Among them combined 1p19q loss is associated with a better prognosis and response to treatment for oligodendrogliomas. Another promising marker is MGMT, a DNA repairing enzyme. If inactivated (by methylation of the promoter of the gene) a better sensitivity is observed with nitrosoure agents. However, some concerns exist for the method of detection of this abnormality. Quality control for molecular techniques is also required before using them for therapeutic strategy. In the future, studies of gene expression profiles by cDNA-microarray as well as works in the field of neural progenitor cells will probably provide new insights in gliomagenesis.",

Understanding the genetic alterations that drive glioma formation and progression may help improve patient prognosis by identification of novel treatment targets. Recently, two major studies have performed in-depth mutation analysis of glioblastomas (the most common and aggressive subtype of glioma). This systematic approach revealed three major pathways that are affected in glioblastomas: The receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, the TP53 pathway and the pRB pathway. Apart from frequent mutations in the IDH1/2 gene, much less is known about the causal genetic changes of grade II and III (anaplastic) gliomas. Exceptions include TP53 mutations and fusion genes involving the BRAF gene in astrocytic and pilocytic glioma subtypes, respectively. In this review, we provide an update on all common events involved in the initiation and/or progression across the different subtypes of glioma and provide future directions for research into the genetic changes.

Although these tumors are typically slow growing, they may be associated with significant morbidity and mortality because of recurrence and malignant progression, even in the setting of optimal resection. LGG in pediatric and adult age groups are currently classified by morphologic criteria. Recent years have heralded a molecular revolution in understanding brain tumors, including LGG. Next-generation sequencing has definitively demonstrated that pediatric and adult LGG fundamentally differ in their underlying molecular characteristics, despite being histologically similar. Pediatric LGG show alterations in FGFR1 and BRAF in pilocytic astrocytomas and FGFR1 alterations in diffuse astrocytomas, each converging on the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. Adult LGG are characterized by IDH1/2 mutations and ATRX mutations in astrocytic tumors and IDH1/2 mutations and 1p/19q codeletions in oligodendroglial tumors. TERT promoter mutations are also noted in LGG and are mainly associated with oligodendrogliomas. These findings have considerably refined approaches to classifying these tumors. Moreover, many of the molecular alterations identified in LGG directly impact on prognosis, tumor biology, and the development of novel therapies. ",

This article provides an overview and critical appraisal of the types of genetic and epigenetic aberrations that have gained significance in the molecular diagnostics of gliomas, namely deletions of chromosome arms 1p and 19q, promoter hypermethylation of the O6-methylguanine-methyl-transferase (MGMT) gene, and the mutation status of the IDH1 and IDH2 genes. In addition, the frequent oncogenic aberration of BRAF in pilocytic astrocytomas may serve as a novel diagnostic marker and therapeutic target.

Current therapies rely on neurosurgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or combination of these conventional modalities and although histopathology helps to direct therapy, molecular pathology has so far not played a major role in the management of paediatric glioma. However, increasing knowledge of glioma biology is starting to impact on drug development towards targeted therapies. Pilocytic astrocytoma, the most common childhood low grade brain tumour, has recently been shown to harbour an activated BRAF/MAPK/ERK pathway in the majority of cases; this represents an attractive target for new agents. The molecular biology of adult malignant glioma is now well described and targeted therapies against VEGFR are already playing a role in the management of glioblastoma. It is likely that high grade gliomas in children and adults share common aberrant molecular pathways but the frequency and mechanisms involved probably will exhibit key differences and on-going comprehensive molecular analyses of paediatric high grade glioma are essential to determine which targets are important in children. However, selection for specific targeted therapy is unlikely to be based on, or restricted by, age but will require individual case by case testing for target presence in order to direct and maximise the efficacy of molecular therapy. Brainstem glioma remains a tumour with a dismal prognosis but relatively little is known about the underlying biology and progress will require a concerted effort to collect tissue by biopsy and autopsy to allow appropriate analysis to identify and validate targets.

Temozolomide, an oral imidazotetrazine prodrug, while considered standard of care for adult HGG, has not shown the same degree of benefit in the treatment of pediatric HGG. There are significant biologic differences that exist between adult and pediatric HGG, and targets specifically aimed at the biology in the pediatric population are required. Novel and specific therapies currently being investigated for pediatric HGG include small molecule inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, histone deacetylase, the RAS/AKT pathway, telomerase, integrin, insulin-like growth factor receptor, and γ-secretase. Surgery is also the mainstay for LGG. There are defined front-line, multiagent chemotherapy regimens, but there are few proven second-line chemotherapy options for refractory patients. Approaches such as the inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, inhibition of MEK1 and 2, as well as BRAF, are discussed. Further research is required to understand the biology of pediatric gliomas as well as the use of molecularly targeted agents, especially in patients with surgically unresectable tumors.",

B-FABP is also expressed in astrocytoma tumors and in some malignant glioma cell lines. To address the role of B-FABP in malignant glioma, we have studied the growth properties of clonal populations of malignant glioma cells modified for B-FABP expression. Here, we demonstrate that expression of B-FABP in B-FABP-negative malignant glioma cells is accompanied by the appearance of radial glial-like properties, such as increased migration and extended bipolar cell processes, as well as reduced transformation. Conversely, B-FABP depletion in B-FABP-positive malignant glioma cells results in decreased migration, reduction in cell processes, and a more transformed phenotype. Moreover, expression of B-FABP in astrocytomas is associated with regions of tumor infiltration and recurrence. Rather than being a direct manifestation of the tumorigenic process, we propose that the ability of high-grade astrocytoma cells to migrate long distances from the primary tumor reflects properties associated with their cell of origin. Thus, targeting B-FABP-expressing cells may make a significant impact on the treatment of these tumors.",

Their distinct ability to infiltrate into the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the brain makes it impossible to treat these tumors using surgery and radiation therapy. A number of different studies have suggested that hyaluronan (HA), the principal glycosaminoglycan (GAG) in the ECM of the brain, is the critical factor for glioma invasion. HA-induced glioma invasion was driven by two important molecular events: matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion and up-regulation of cell migration. MMP secretion was triggered by HA-induced focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation, which transmits its signal through ERK activation and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) translocation. Another important molecular event is osteopontin (OPN) expression. OPN expression by AKT activation triggers cell migration. These results suggest that HA-induced glioma invasion is tightly regulated by signaling mechanisms, and a detailed understanding of this molecular mechanism will provide important clues for glioma treatment.",

This strongly suggests that this pathway is necessary for glioma formation and maintenance. To further define the role of this pathway in the development of high-grade gliomas, we used the established RCAS/TVA glioma mouse model to test the ability of activated MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK), a RAF effector, to induce tumors in vivo in the context of activated AKT or Ink4a/Arf loss. Although expression of activated MEK alone in neural progenitor cells is not sufficient for tumorigenesis, the combination of activated MEK and AKT or MEK with Ink4a/Arf loss is transforming. The data reveal that activation of the classical RAS/MAPK pathway, which is mediated through MEK, leads to the development of high-grade gliomas in vivo and suggest that MEK may be a relevant target for glioma therapy. To test this, we treated both mouse and human glioma cells with the MEK inhibitor PD0325901. Although this treatment induced apoptosis in a significant percentage of the cells, the effect was enhanced by combined treatment with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235.

The purpose of this work was to investigate whether apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) histograms of untreated low-grade astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas exhibit different characteristics due to their biological differences, and whether a diagnosis of tumour subtype can be made at presentation using the histogram alone, which, if possible, would have an impact on clinical practise. Fifteen patients with astrocytoma (AC) [11 male (mean age +/- standard deviation) 40 +/- 11 years], nine with oligodendroglioma (OD) (four male, 45 +/- 13 years) and three with oligoastrocytoma (OA) (two male, 60 +/- 11 years) were recruited and diffusion-weighted images (b = 0 and 1000 s mm(-2)) were acquired every 6 months to date or until malignant transformation. Whole tumour ADC histograms were calculated, a multiple discriminant analysis was performed and quantitative morphological parameters extracted, the AC and OD subtypes were then compared using Student's unpaired t-test. Classification of the histograms was also performed. ODs had significantly lower group ADC values than ACs and up to 83% of the subjects could be correctly classified into the OD and AC groups by reference to the histogram. The group differences were most significant for the multiple discriminant analysis (p = 1 x 10(-5)) and at the 10th centile point [AC = 1170 +/- 170, OD = (1030 +/- 80) x 10(-6) mm(2) s(-1)] (p = 0.01). ODs have a lower ADC than ACs with differences throughout the histogram. Both tumour types show similar intra-tumour heterogeneity, as seen from the equal group peak heights, but ACs shows more intra-group heterogeneity. ADC histogram analysis may aid non-invasive sub-classification of low-grade glioma histological subtypes.",

Here we perform a genome-wide RNAi screen to identify transcriptional regulators of ATF5. Our results reveal an essential survival pathway in malignant glioma, whereby activation of a RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase or phosphoinositide-3-kinase signaling cascade leads to induction of the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein-3-like-2 (CREB3L2), which directly activates ATF5 expression. ATF5, in turn, promotes survival by stimulating transcription of myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1 (MCL1), an antiapoptotic B cell leukemia-2 family member. Analysis of human malignant glioma samples indicates that ATF5 expression inversely correlates with disease prognosis. The RAF kinase inhibitor sorafenib suppresses ATF5 expression in glioma stem cells and inhibits malignant glioma growth in cell culture and mouse models. Our results demonstrate that ATF5 is essential in malignant glioma genesis and reveal that the ATF5-mediated survival pathway described here provides potential therapeutic targets for treatment of malignant glioma.",

Standard treatments and current development of new therapies for malignant gliomas are reviewed, focusing specifically on growth factors and their receptors (e.g. epidermal growth factor receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor), as well as the intracellular effector molecules that are downstream of these growth factors (e.g. Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin, and protein kinase C). The efficacies of other novel targeted inhibitors such as deacetylase inhibitors and heat shock protein 90 inhibitors in the treatment of gliomas are also discussed, as well as new combination therapies. In order for new agents to increase treatment efficacy, new targets need to be developed, drug delivery efficiency needs to be improved, and new biomarkers need to be discovered.

Theoretically the brain tumor can be heated by heat conduction through the heated implants. Several implants were placed inside the brain tumor directly by operation, or by CT stereotactic procedure. The patients were divided into two groups according to the tumor location as (A) in cortical or subcortical region (13 cases) and (B) in thalamus or basal ganglia (11 cases). Hyperthermia, 60 minutes each, 2 to 3 times per week, was safely repeated in all the cases. External irradiation was always combined with hyperthermia in most of the cases and with chemotherapy in some of them. Follow-up CTs demonstrate a remarkable response in many cases of B group. In fact ICR, 4PR and 3MR were achieved in this group, resulting in 45.5% of the response. In contrast gliomas in A group showed a less favorable response, resulting in 23.1% of the response (3 PRs in 13 cases).

Furthermore, overexpression of OPN was observed following chemotherapy. To elucidate whether OPN plays a role in chemotherapy resistance and to investigate its downstream signaling pathway, this study used small interfering RNA (siRNA) to silence the expression of OPN in U251 human neuronal glioma astrocytoma cells. OPN downregulation in U251 cells enhanced the apoptotic effects induced by temozolomide (TMZ) and cisplatin (DDP). Furthermore, OPN siRNA suppressed the nuclear factor κ‑light‑chain‑enhancer of activated B cells (NF‑κB) activation and B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2) expression that was induced by chemotherapy. Taken together, these results demonstrated that the expression levels of OPN are involved in glioma chemoresistance.

B-MD is expected to provide reference for clinical individual chemotherapy of glioma, but also provide powerful tools for the evaluation of new anticancer drugs in vivo.

While a few small series have reported its occurrence in children, little is known about the molecular characteristics of pediatric GC. We reviewed clinical, radiological, and histological features of pediatric patients with primary GC treated at our institution over 15 years. Targeted sequencing of mutational hotspots in H3F3A, IDH1/2, and BRAF, and genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation and copy number abnormalities was performed in available tumors. Thirty-two patients [23 (72 %) with type 1 and 9 (28 %) with type 2 GC] were identified. Median age at diagnosis was 10.2 years (range 1.5-19.1). A median of 4 cerebral lobes (range 3-8) was affected at diagnosis. In addition, symmetrical bithalamic involvement was observed in 9 (28 %) patients. Twenty-two patients (69 %) had an anaplastic astrocytoma. Despite aggressive therapy, only two patients younger than 3 years at diagnosis are long-term survivors. Clustering analysis of methylation array data from 18 cases classified tumors as IDH (n = 3, 17 %), G34 (n = 4, 22 %), mesenchymal (n = 3, 17 %), and RTK I 'PDGFRA' (n = 8, 44 %). No tumors were classified as K27 subgroup. PDGFRA was the most commonly amplified oncogene in 4 of 22 tumors (18 %). H3F3A p.G34 occurred in all cases classified as G34. Two of 3 cases in the IDH subgroup had IDH1 p.R132H. No H3F3A p.K27 M, IDH2 p.R172, or BRAF p.V600E mutations were observed. There was a trend towards improved survival in the IDH subgroup (P = 0.056). Patients with bithalamic involvement had worse outcomes (P = 0.019).

Nevertheless, the absence of RKIP expression was an independent prognostic marker in glioma. Additionally, by in vitro downregulation of RKIP, we found that RKIP inhibition induces a higher viability and migration of the cells, having no effect on cellular proliferation and angiogenesis, as assessed by in vivo CAM assay. In conclusion, this is the largest series studied so far evaluating the expression levels of this important cancer suppressor protein in glioma tumors.

The aim of this study is to explore mitotic and centrosomal dysregulation in gliomas, which may provide novel targets for treatment.;A case-control study was performed using 34 resected gliomas, which were separated into low- and high-grade groups. Normal human brain tissue was used as a control. Using immunohistochemical analysis, immunofluorescent microscopy, and RT-PCR, detection of centrins 1 and 2, gamma-tubulin, hNinein, Aurora A, and Aurora B, expression was performed. Analysis of the GBM8401 glioma cell line was also undertaken to complement the in vivo studies.;In high-grade gliomas, the cells had greater than two very brightly staining centrioles within large, atypical nuclei, and moderate-to-strong Aurora A staining. Comparing with normal human brain tissue, most of the mRNAs expression in gliomas for centrosomal structural proteins, including centrin 3, gamma-tubulin, and hNinein isoforms 1, 2, 5 and 6, Aurora A and Aurora B were elevated. The significant different expression was observed between high- and low-grade glioma in both gamma-tubulin and Aurora A mRNA s. In the high-grade glioma group, 78.6% of the samples had higher than normal expression of gamma-tubulin mRNA, which was significantly higher than in the low-grade glioma group (18.2%, p < 0.05).;Markers for mitotic dysregulation, such as supernumerary centrosomes and altered expression of centrosome-related mRNA and proteins were more frequently detected in higher grade gliomas. Therefore, these results are clinically useful for glioma staging as well as the development of novel treatments strategies.",

Deregulated expression of adhesion molecules on glioma cells is thought to contribute to this process. Junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs) include several IgSF members involved in leukocyte trafficking, angiogenesis, and cell polarity. They are expressed mainly by endothelial cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Here, we report JAM-C expression by human gliomas, but not by their normal cellular counterpart. This expression correlates with the expression of genes involved in cytoskeleton remodeling and cell migration. These genes, identified by a transcriptomic approach, include poliovirus receptor and cystein-rich 61, both known to promote glioma invasion, as well as actin filament associated protein, a c-Src binding partner. Gliomas also aberrantly express JAM-B, a high affinity JAM-C ligand. Their interaction activates the c-Src proto-oncogene, a central upstream molecule in the pathways regulating cell migration and invasion. In the tumor microenvironment, this co-expression may thus promote glioma invasion through paracrine stimuli from both tumor cells and endothelial cells. Accordingly, JAM-C/B blocking antibodies impair in vivo glioma growth and invasion, highlighting the potential of JAM-C and JAM-B as new targets for the treatment of human gliomas.",

The RMPAhigh gliomas were associated with poor prognosis compared to the RMPAlow gliomas. The RMPAhigh and RMPAlow glioma subtypes harbored unique sets of genomic alterations in the RTK signaling-related genes. The RMPAhigh gliomas were enriched in immature vessel cells and tumor associated macrophages, and both cell types expressed high levels of pro-angiogenic RTKs including MET, VEGFR1, KDR, EPHB4 and NRP1. In gliomas with major genomic lesions unrelated to RTK pathway, high RMPA signature was associated with short survival.

Additionally, recent studies have demonstrated the existence             of brain glioma stem cells (BGSCs) which are tumorigenic, self-renewable and dominate             the biological behavior of gliomas. Currently BGSCs are committed as a new target             of glioma therapies. However, few studies have focused on the expression of Bcl-2             in BGSCs.

Routine histological preparations and post-contrast preoperative MRI/CT-scan were simultaneously reviewed in order to assess the impact on survival of the following features: presence or absence of a polymorphous or gemistocytic astrocytic component, of necrosis and of contrast enhancement (CH); endothelial hyperplasia (EH) assessed as absent, present minor (HE+) or (HE++) when conform to the threshold of HE defined in the SA grading system of oligodendrogliomas. The tumors were graded A: no CH and no EH; in B: CH and /or HE++, and A/B: EH + but no CE.;70.1% of the tumors were classified as \"pure\" oligodendroglioma, 19.5% as \"polymorphous oligo-astroastrocytoma\" and 10.3% as \"gemistocytic oligo-astrocytoma\". In grade A, or B tumors, the presence of a polymorphous or a gemistocytic component had no significant influence on survival; however respectively 53% and 65% of these tumours versus 32% of \"pure\" oligodendrogliomas were grade B at the time of diagnosis. In either histological subtypes, survival was not significantly different when HE was absent or minor (HE+). After regrouping of the histological subtypes and of the tumors with HE+ or absent, the series included 153 oligodendrogliomas grade A and 98 grade B. Survival in patients with grade A versus grade B tumors was respectively 142 versus 52 months (p<0.0001). In grade B tumors, necrosis had no significant influence on survival. Ring-shaped contrast enhancement surrounding large foci of necrosis was observed in only 4 cases. In tumors with or without CE, patient survival was respectively 148 versus 40 months (p<0.0001). On post contrast MRI done in 235 patients, only 7 tumors (3%) were grade A/B (EH++ but no CH).;From these results and our previous observation that, according to the SA classification of gliomas, only oligodendrogliomas or oligo-astrocytomas may not show CE, we propose that for retrospective studies: 1) tumors diagnosed according to the Ste-Anne classification as oligodendroglioma or oligo-astrocytoma be regrouped in a unique category, 2) independent of their histological type and grade according to the WHO, gliomas that do not show CE be regrouped with SA oligodendrogliomas grade A, 3) concerning gliomas that show CE on MRI: oligodendrogliomas or oligo-astrocytomas WHO grade II or III, as well as WHO secondary glioblastomas or glioblastomas with an oligodendroglial component, be regrouped with SA oligodendrogliomas grade B; however tumors that show ring-like CE surrounding large foci of necrosis and finger-like \"peritumoral\" edema should be excluded or analysed separately.",

During this immunohistochemical study, the presence and tissue localization of VEGF121 was observed in anaplastic, high-grade astrocytomas (AAs) and in glioblastoma multiforme (GBMs) employing the specific monoclonal antibody against it.

VEGF121 expression was identified mostly within the cytoplasm of tumor cells, suggesting an embryonic, undifferentiated and more malignant cellular IP of high-grade gliomas. Tumor-related neo-angiogenesis and endothelial cell proliferation were also present. The great majority of high-grade astrocytic gliomas are incurable with the three classic therapeutic modalities.

In this study, we have examined glioma migration in living brain tissue by using two novel in vivo model systems. Within the brain, glioma cells migrate like nontransformed, neural progenitor cells-extending a prominent leading cytoplasmic process followed by a burst of forward movement by the cell body that requires myosin II. In contrast, on a two-dimensional surface, glioma cells migrate more like fibroblasts, and they do not require myosin II to move. To explain this phenomenon, we studied glioma migration through a series of synthetic membranes with defined pore sizes. Our results demonstrate that the A and B isoforms of myosin II are specifically required when a glioma cell has to squeeze through pores smaller than its nuclear diameter. They support a model in which the neural progenitor-like mode of glioma invasion and the requirement for myosin II represent an adaptation needed to move within the brain, which has a submicrometer effective pore size.

However, if gliomas can be made to be more immunogenic or if a tumor vaccine can be produced, then access to all tumor cells including those that infiltrate into the brain can be achieved through the patient's immune response. Several strategies have been investigated for immunotherapy. Laboratory studies and animal models have shown that these immune cells will attack the tumor cell, reduce the size of implanted tumors, and that the immune memory is sufficient to suppress tumor growth when the animal is rechallenges with a tumor implant. Since the development of hybridoma technology, monoclonal antibodies against human cancer cells have been produced and antigens have been identified. Hagiwara reported the production of a human monoclonal antibody, CLN-IgG, made by fusing UC 729-6, human lymphoblastoid B-cell line, with lymphocytes obtained from a patient with the cervical carcinoma. It has been reported that CLN-IgG recognized the antigen expressed in various histological types of human cancers including malignant gliomas. The effect of human monoclonal antibody(CLN-IgG) on malignant brain tumors was evaluated in patients with malignant glioma. Early phase II study was concluded that this specific immunotherapy with CLN-IgG is safe and effective therapy in patients with malignant glioma. We treated 10 cases of malignant gliomas with CLN-IgG. All patients had received radiotherapy and chemotherapy before this immunotherapy using the human monoclonal antibody. The human monoclonal antibody(CLN-IgG) was administered intravenously once or twice/week during 24 weeks. Six cases of glioblastoma, 1 medulloblastoma and 3 cases of potine glioma histologically unverified, were treated. Five cases of 6 glioblastomas died 4 to 12 months after this treatment, 3 cases of pontine glioma showed good responses, 2 cases showed marked decrease of tumor size and 1 case showed no regrowth of tumor on MRI imaging. For the above reasons, Human monoclonal antibody(CLN-IgG) might be useful as an immunotherapy of malignant gliomas.",

To date there is not a single approved drug to effectively treat these tumors and thus novel therapies are desperately needed. Recent studies suggest that a significant fraction of these tumors contain alterations in cell cycle regulatory genes including amplification of the D-type cyclins and CDK4/6, and less commonly, loss of Ink4a-ARF leading to aberrant cell proliferation. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic approach of targeting the cyclin-CDK-Retinoblastoma (Rb) pathway in a genetically engineered PDGF-B-driven brainstem glioma (BSG) mouse model. We found that PD-0332991 (PD), a CDK4/6 inhibitor, induces cell-cycle arrest in our PDGF-B; Ink4a-ARF deficient model both in vitro and in vivo. By contrast, the PDGF-B; p53 deficient model was mostly resistant to treatment with PD. We noted that a 7-day treatment course with PD significantly prolonged survival by 12% in the PDGF-B; Ink4a-ARF deficient BSG model. Furthermore, a single dose of 10 Gy radiation therapy (RT) followed by 7 days of treatment with PD increased the survival by 19% in comparison to RT alone. These findings provide the rationale for evaluating PD in children with Ink4a-ARF deficient gliomas. ",

Cathepsin B and uPAR are overexpressed in gliomas and they are postulated to play central roles in glioma metastasis. In this study, efficient downregulation of cathepsin B and uPAR by siRNA treatments significantly reduced glioma cell adhesion to laminin as compared to vitronectin, fibronectin, or collagen I in U251 and 4910 glioma cell lines. Brain glioma tissue array analysis showed high expression of CD151 in clinical samples when compared with normal brain tissue. Cathepsin B and uPAR siRNA treatment led to the downregulation of CD151 and laminin-binding integrins α3 and β1. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that downregulation of cathepsin B and uPAR decreased the interaction of CD151 with uPAR cathepsin B, and α3β1 integrin. Studies on the downstream signaling cascade of uPAR/CD151/α3β1 integrin have shown that phosphorylation of FAK, SRC, paxillin, and expression of adaptor cytoskeletal proteins talin and vinculin were reduced with knockdown of cathepsin B, uPAR, and CD151. Treatment with the bicistronic construct reduced interactions between uPAR and CD151 as well as lowering α3β1 integrin, talin, and vinculin expression levels in pre-established glioma tumors of nude mice. In conclusion, our results show that downregulation of cathepsin B and uPAR alone and in combination inhibit glioma cell adhesion by downregulating CD151 and its associated signaling molecules in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, the results of the present study show that targeting the uPAR-cathepsin B system has possible therapeutic potential.",

BMP-2 is also closely associated with various malignant tumors. microRNAs negatively and posttranscriptionally regulate gene expression and function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Herein, we report that miR-656 expression was significantly downregulated in glioma cell lines and tissues. We identified and confirmed that BMP receptor, type 1A (BMPR1A) is a direct target of miR-656. The expression of BMPR1A was negatively correlated with that of miR-656 in human glioma tissues. We further demonstrated that miR-656 suppressed glioma cell proliferation, neurosphere formation, migration and invasion with or without exogenous BMP-2. Engineered knockdown of BMPR1A diminished the antiproliferation effect of miR-656 in vitro. Moreover, the canonical BMP/Smad and non-canonical BMP/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways were inhibited by miR-656 overexpression. Several cancer-related signaling molecules, including cyclin B, cyclin D1, matrix metalloproteinase-9, p21 and p27, were also involved in miR-656 function in glioma cells. The tumor-suppressing function of miR-656 was validated using an in vivo intracranial xenograft mouse model. Notably, ectopic expression of miR-656 markedly reduced tumor size and prolonged the survival of mice treated with or without BMP-2. These results elucidate the function of miR-656 in glioma progression and suggest a promising application for glioma treatment. ",

Chemotherapy frequently results in DNA damage. When such damage is sensed by the cell, programmed cell death, or apoptosis, may be initiated. However, chemotherapy-induced DNA damage may activate nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and block apoptosis. We inhibited NF-kappaB using a gene therapy approach to determine whether this would render human glioma cells more susceptible to chemotherapy. U87 and U251 glioma cell lines were infected with either treatment adenovirus containing the gene for a mutant non-degradable form of IkappaBalpha, which is an inhibitor of NF-kappaB nuclear translocation, or empty control virus. Following viral infection, cells were treated either with BCNU, carboplatin, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), or SN-38. Chemotherapy resulted in a marked increase in active intranuclear NF-kappaB. This response was greatly decreased by insertion of the mutant repressor gene. Similarly, a significant increase in cell killing by all chemotherapy age was demonstrated following infection with treatment virus. Expression of the mutant repressor gene also resulted in increased apoptosis by TUNEL assay following chemotherapy. Numerous genes are responsible for glioma chemoresistance. DNA damage by chemotherapy may induce the antiapoptotic factor NF-kappaB and prevent programmed cell death. Insertion of a mutant inhibitor of NF-kappaB strips cells of this antiapoptotic defense and renders them more susceptible to killing by chemotherapy via increased apoptosis.",

Due to heterogeneity and different degrees of vascularisation cell subpopulations possess varying resistance to chemo- or radiation therapy. Therefore, therapy is dependent on the ability to specifically target a tumour cell. Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a bimodal method, in radiation therapy, taking advantage of the ability of the stable isotope boron-10 to capture neutrons. It results in disintegration products depositing large amounts of energy within a short length, approximately one cell diameter. Thereby, selective irradiation of a target cell may be accomplished if a sufficient amount of boron has been accumulated and hence the cell-associated boron concentration is of critical importance. The accumulation of boron, boronophenylalanine (BPA), was investigated in two human glioma cell subpopulations and a human fibroblast cell line in vitro. The cells were incubated at low boron concentrations (0-5 microg B/ml). Oil filtration was then used for separation of extracellular and cell-associated boron. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) was used for boron determination. Significant (P < 0.05) differences in accumulation ratio (relation between cell-associated and extracellular boron concentration) between human malignant glioma cell lines were found. Human fibroblasts, used to represent normal cells, showed a growth-dependent uptake and a lower accumulation ratio than the glioma cells.

Aurora B expression is greater in cultured malignant glioma U251 cells compared to proliferating normal human astrocytes, and expression is maintained in U251 flank xenografts. Aurora B inhibition with AZD1152-HQPA blocked cell division in four different p53-mutant glioma cell lines (U251, T98G, U373, and U118). AZD1152-HQPA also inhibited Aurora C activation loop threonine autophosphorylation at the effective antiproliferative concentrations in vitro. Reduction in cell viability of U251 (p53(R273H)) cells was secondary to cytokinesis blockade and apoptosis induction following endoreplication.

The differential expression of methyltransferase G9a, histone H3K9me2 and histone H3K9me1 in in human brain glioma and adjacent tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, a growth curve of U251 cells following treatment with BIX‑01294 was determined using the MTT assay. In addition, the apoptosis percentage of U251 cells was analyzed by TUNEL assay and the expression levels of apoptosis‑associated proteins, including B‑cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2), Bcl‑2‑associated X protein (Bax), caspase‑9 and caspase‑3, and the acetylation of histones, including H3K27me1, H3K27me2 and H3 in U251 were analyzed by western blot following BIX‑01294 treatment. The positive rate of G9a in glioma tissues was 86% (43/50), which was significantly different from 42% (21/50) in adjacent tissues (P<0.01). The positive rate of H3K9me2 in glioma tissues was 82% (41/50), which was significantly different from 38% (19/50) in adjacent tissues (χ²=18.38; P<0.01). The expression of G9a and H3K9me2 were associated with the World Health Organization (WHO) glioma grade. The positive rate of H3K9me1 in glioma tissues was 54% (27/50) and 44% (22/50) in adjacent tissues, though this result was not significantly different (χ²=1.21, P>0.05). BIX‑01294 inhibited the proliferation of U251, downregulated expression of Bcl‑2, and upregulated expression of Bax, caspase‑3 and caspase‑9, and induced apoptosis of U251. BIX‑01294 downregulated H3K9me1, H3K9me2, H3K27me1 and H3K27me2, however, it did not affect the acetylation of H3K9me3 and H3. High expression of G9a and H3K9me2 in glioma tissue samples was associated with the WHO grade, which indicated that G9a and H3K9me2 may promote generation and development of glioma. BIX‑01294 inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of glioma cells, changes in methylation of H3K9 and H3K27 resulting in conformational changes of chromosome may be an underlying mechanism.

In resected glioma specimens, the authors demonstrated that malignant gliomas have varying levels of CAR, alphavbeta3, and alphavbeta5 expression.;A correlation between CAR expression and the transduction efficiency of AdV carrying the green fluorescent protein in various human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cell lines and GBM primary cell lines was observed. To increase transgene activity in in vitro glioma cells with low or deficient levels of CAR, the authors used basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) as a targeting ligand to redirect adenoviral infection through its cognate receptor, FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1), which was expressed at high levels by all glioma cells. These findings were confirmed by in vivo study data demonstrating enhanced transduction efficiency of FGF2-retargeted AdV in CAR-negative intracranial gliomas compared with AdV alone, without evidence of increased angiogenesis.;Altogether, the results demonstrated that AdV-mediated gene transfer using the FGF2/FGFR system is effective in gliomas with low or deficient levels of CAR and suggested that FGF2-retargeting of AdV may be a promising approach in glioma gene therapy.",

Therefore, disruption of PDGF ligand/receptor complex represents a promising strategy for the treatment of malignant gliomas. However, the mechanisms of the antitumour effect exerted by the inhibition of PDGF-mediated cell growth remain unclear. In the present study, using anti-PDGF neutralising antibody, we investigated the effect of the inhibition of PDGF signalling on malignant glioma U87-MG, D54, and T98G cells with high levels of PDGF-A and -B. As a control, normal fibroblast MRC5 cells expressing low levels of PDGF-A and -B were used. Treatment with anti-PDGF neutralising antibody did not affect the expressions of PDGF-A, PDGF-B, and Akt, but suppressed the level of phosphorylated Akt in tumour cells, indicating the inhibition of PDGF signalling. The cell viability of all malignant glioma cells tested in this study was significantly inhibited in a time-dependent manner following the treatment compared to that of fibroblast cells (P<0.02 to <0.05). The antitumour effect of anti-PDGF antibody was suppressed by the activation of Akt and enhanced by the downregulation of Akt. Interestingly, the inhibition of PDGF signalling induced the development of acidic vesicular organelles and the autophagosome membrane association of the microtubule-associated protein light chain 3, which are characteristic of autophagy, in malignant glioma cells, while apoptotic cell death was not observed. Together these findings imply a new concept of autophagy for PDGF autocrine inhibition in malignant gliomas.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that the expression of miRNA‑34a (miR‑34a) is significantly associated with the grade and prognosis of glioma. However, the exact function of miR‑34a on glioma progression and underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. The present study investigated the function of miR‑34a in U87 human glioma cells by exogenously transfecting cells with an miR‑34a mimic. Overexpression of miR‑34a inhibited proliferation, and induced apoptosis of U87 cells. The current study also demonstrated that B‑cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2) was the target gene of miR‑34a, as demonstrated by luciferase assays. Furthermore, restoring the expression of Bcl‑2 was indicated to partially block the miR‑34a‑induced apoptosis. Thus, data from the present study identified miR‑34a as a tumor suppressor in glioma by, at least partially, targeting Bcl‑2.

To establish the role of PDGF-B in glioma angiogenesis, we overexpressed PDGF-B in U87MG glioma cells. Although PDGF-B stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGF-Rbeta in U87MG cells, treatment with recombinant PDGF-B or overexpression of PDGF-B in U87MG cells had no effect on their proliferation. However, an increase of secreted PDGF-B in conditioned media of U87MG/PDGF-B cells promoted migration of endothelial cells expressing PDGF-R beta, whereas conditioned media from U87MG cells did not increase the cell migration. In mice, overexpression of PDGF-B in U87MG cells enhanced intracranial glioma formation by stimulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in neovessels and by attracting vessel-associated pericytes. When PDGF-B and VEGF were overexpressed simultaneously by U87MG tumors, there was a marked increase of capillary-associated pericytes as seen in U87MG/VEGF(165)/PDGF-B gliomas. As a result of pericyte recruitment, vessels induced by VEGF in tumor vicinity migrated into the central regions of these tumors. These data suggest that PDGF-B is a paracrine factor in U87MG gliomas, and that PDGF-B enhances glioma angiogenesis, at least in part, by stimulating VEGF expression in tumor endothelia and by recruiting pericytes to neovessels.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Despite major advances in the management of malignant gliomas of which glioblastomas represent the ultimate grade of malignancy, they remain characterized by dismal prognoses. Glioblastoma patients have a median survival expectancy of only 14 months on the current standard treatment of surgical resection to the extent feasible, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy plus temozolomide, given concomitantly with and after radiotherapy. Malignant gliomas are associated with such dismal prognoses because glioma cells can actively migrate through the narrow extra-cellular spaces in the brain, often travelling relatively long distances, making them elusive targets for effective surgical management. Clinical and experimental data have demonstrated that invasive malignant glioma cells show a decrease in their proliferation rates and a relative resistance to apoptosis (type I programmed cell death) as compared to the highly cellular centre of the tumor, and this may contribute to their resistance to conventional pro-apoptotic chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Resistance to apoptosis results from changes at the genomic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional level of proteins, protein kinases and their transcriptional factor effectors. The PTEN/ PI3K/Akt/mTOR/NF-kappaB and the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascades play critical roles in the regulation of gene expression and prevention of apoptosis. Components of these pathways are mutated or aberrantly expressed in human cancer, notably glioblastomas. Monoclonal antibodies and low molecular-weight kinase inhibitors of these pathways are the most common classes of agents in targeted cancer treatment. However, most clinical trials of these agents as monotherapies have failed to demonstrate survival benefit. Despite resistance to apoptosis being closely linked to tumorigenesis, tumor cells can still be induced to die by non-apoptotic mechanisms such as necrosis, senescence, autophagy (type II programmed cell death) and mitotic catastrophe. Temozolomide brings significant therapeutic benefits in glioblastoma treatment. Part of temozolomide cytotoxic activity is exerted through pro-autophagic processes and also through the induction of late apoptosis. Autophagy, type II programmed cell death, represents an alternative mechanism to overcome, at least partly, the dramatic resistance of many cancers to pro-apoptotic-related therapies. Another way to potentially overcome apoptosis resistance is to decrease the migration of malignant glioma cells in the brain, which then should restore a level of sensitivity to pro-apoptotic drugs. Recent series of studies have supported the concept that malignant gliomas might be seen as an orchestration of cross-talks between cancer cells, microenvironment, vasculature and cancer stem cells. The present chapter focuses on (i) the major signaling pathways making glioblastomas resistant to apoptosis, (ii) the signaling pathways distinctly activated by pro-autophagic drugs as compared to pro-apoptotic ones, (iii) autophagic cell death as an alternative to combat malignant gliomas, (iv) the major scientific data already obtained by researchers to prove that temozolomide is actually a pro-autophagic and pro-apoptotic drug, (v) the molecular and cellular therapies and local drug delivery which could be used to complement conventional treatments, and a review of some of the currently ongoing clinical trials, (vi) the fact that reducing the levels of malignant glioma cell motility can restore pro-apoptotic drug sensitivity, (vii) the observation that inhibiting the sodium pump activity reduces both glioma cell proliferation and migration, (viii) the brain tumor stem cells as a target to complement conventional treatment.",

After intravenous and peritumoral injection, BOEC/MV-Edm deliver the viruses selectively to irradiated orthotopic U87 gliomas in mice. At the tumor, MV-Edm produced by the BOECs infect glioma cells. Subsequent spread from tumor cell to tumor cell leads to focal infection and cytopathic effects that decrease tumor size and, in the case of peritumoral injection, prolong survival of mice.

The design of neutral MP-MUS involved the use of a seeker molecule capable of binding to mitochondrial MAO-B, which is up-regulated ≥fourfold in glioma cells. Once the binding occurs, MP-MUS is converted into a positively charged moiety, P(+) -MUS, which accumulates inside mitochondria at a theoretical maximal value of 1000:1 gradient. The LD50 of MP-MUS against glioma cells is 75 μM, which is two- to threefold more potent than temozolomide, a primary drug for gliomas. Importantly, MP-MUS was found to be selectively toxic toward glioma cells. In the concentration range of 150-180 μM MP-MUS killed 90-95 % of glioma cells, but stimulated the growth of normal human astrocytes.

Taken together, our results suggest             that pMU and pMC treatments switch glioma cells from the glycolytic to the OXPHOS             pathway through an inhibitory effect on Akt, ROS induction and an increase of             cytosolic cytochrome c accumulation.

        "Doc_abstract":"Growth factor receptors and angiogenesis play major roles in the oncogenesis of gliomas. Over the last several years, several noncytotoxic molecular targeted therapies have been developed against growth factor receptors and tumor angiogenesis. In gliomas, two main anti-growth factor receptor strategies have been evaluated in phase I/II clinical trials: (a) small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and (b) monoclonal antibodies that target growth factors or growth factor receptors other than vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Up to now, few glioma patients have responded to small TKIs (0%-14%) or monoclonal antibodies (three case reports) delivered as a single agent. Greater doses, combined therapies, as well as the identification of molecular biomarkers predictive of response and resistance are important in order to optimize drug delivery and improve efficacy. Antiangiogenic therapies are promising for the treatment of gliomas. Thalidomide and metronomic chemotherapy were the first antiangiogenic strategies evaluated, but they have shown only modest activity. Recent studies of bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF antibody, and irinotecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, have demonstrated a high response rate, suggesting that targeted antiangiogenic therapies may play a significant role in the management of high-grade gliomas in the future. However, the toxicity profiles of these agents are not fully defined and the radiological evaluation of possible tumor response is challenging. Clinical evaluation of several VEGF receptor TKIs is currently ongoing; one of these inhibitors, cediranib, has already demonstrated interesting activity as a single agent. The integrin inhibitor cilengitide represents another promising strategy.",

A few studies reported that the immune system affected glioma development, and immune biomarkers helped understand the disease and formulate effective immunotherapy for patients. Currently, no B lymphocyte-based prognostic signature was reported in gliomas. By applying 78 B cell lineage-specific genes, we conducted a whole-genome gene expression analysis in 782 high grade gliomas derived from three independent datasets by Cox regression analysis and risk score method for signature identification, and then used Gene Ontology, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, and other statistical methods for functional annotations of the signature-defined differences. We developed a five B cell-associated gene signature for prognosis of high grade glioma patients, which is independent of clinicopathological and genetic features. The signature identified high risk patients suitable for chemoradiotherapy, whereas low risk patients should rule out chemotherapy with radiotherapy only. We found that tumors of TCGA Mesenchymal subtype and wild type IDH1 were preferentially stratified to the high risk group, which bore strong immunosuppressive microenvironment, while tumors of TCGA Proneural subtype and mutated IDH1 were significantly accumulated to the low risk group, which exhibited less immunosuppressive state.

Recently, we reported the down-regulation of MHC class I (MHC-I) products in invading tumor cells in human and mouse GL261 gliomas. Here, we tested the hypothesis that whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) up-regulates MHC-I expression on GL261 tumors and enhances the effectiveness of immunotherapy.;MHC-I molecule expression on GL261 cells was analyzed in vitro and in vivo by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, respectively. To test the response of established GL261 gliomas to treatment, mice with measurable (at CT imaging) brain tumors were randomly assigned to four groups receiving (a) no treatment, (b) WBRT in two fractions of 4 Gy, (c) vaccination with irradiated GL261 cells secreting granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, or (d) WBRT and vaccination. Endpoints were tumor response and survival.;An ionizing radiation dose of 4 Gy maximally up-regulated MHC-I molecules on GL261 cells in vitro. In vivo, WBRT induced the expression of the beta2-microglobulin light chain subunit of the MHC class I complex on glioma cells invading normal brain and increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration. However, the survival advantage obtained with WBRT or vaccination alone was minimal. In contrast, WBRT in combination with vaccination increased long-term survival to 40% to 80%, compared with 0% to 10% in the other groups (P < 0.002). Surviving animals showed antitumor immunity by rejecting challenge tumors.;Ionizing radiation can be successfully combined with peripheral vaccination for the treatment of established high-grade gliomas.",

Using glioma cDNA microarray analysis, we found that FKBP5 was overexpressed in glioma tumors. This finding was further validated by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. The roles of FKBP5 in glioma cells were then examined. We found that cell growth was suppressed after FKBP5 expression was inhibited by short interfering RNA transfection and enhanced by FKBP5 overexpression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and DNA binding was enhanced by FKBP5 overexpression. The expression level of I-kappa B alpha and phosphorylated NF-kappaB was regulated by the expression of FKBP5. These data suggest that FKBP5 is involved in NF-kappaB pathway activation in glioma cells. In addition, FKBP5 overexpression in rapamycin-sensitive U87 cells blocked the cells' response to rapamycin treatment, whereas rapamycin-resistant glioma cells, both PTEN-positive and -negative, were synergistically sensitive to rapamycin after FKBP5 was knocked down, suggesting that the FKBP5 regulates glioma cell response to rapamycin treatment.

Even with targeted therapeutic agent, bevacitumab, malignant glioma often develops resistance and recurrence. Thus, developing alternative interventions (therapeutic targets, biomarkers) is urgently required. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) has been long implicated in B cell malignancies but surprisingly it has recently been shown to also play a tumorigenic role in solid tumors such as ovarian and prostate cancer. Bioinformatics data indicates that Btk is significantly higher in clinical glioma samples as compared to normal brain cells and Btk expression level is associated with stage progression. This prompts us to investigate the potential role of Btk as a therapeutic target for glioma. Here, we demonstrate Btk expression is associated with GBM tumorigenesis. Down-regulation of Btk in GBM cell lines showed a significantly reduced abilities in colony formation, migration and GBM sphere-forming potential. Mechanistically, Btk-silenced cells showed a concomitant reduction in the expression of CD133 and Akt/mTOR signaling. In parallel, Ibrutinib (a Btk inhibitor) treatment led to a similar anti-tumorigenic response. Using xenograft mouse model, tumorigenesis was significantly reduced in Btk-silenced or ibrutinib-treated mice as compared to control counterparts. Finally, our glioma tissue microarray analysis indicated a higher Btk staining in the malignant tumors than less malignant and normal brain tissues. Collectively, Btk may represent a novel therapeutic target for glioma and ibrunitib may be used as an adjuvant treatment for malignant GBM.",

The starting dosage of DFMO was 3 grams/m(2) p.o. q. 8 h for 14 days before and 4 weeks after 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea; PCV was administered as described previously (1). Clinical and radiological (gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging) follow-ups were nominally at the end of each 6- or 8-week cycle (PCV at 6 weeks; DFMO-PCV at 8 weeks). Laboratory evaluations for hematological and other adverse effects were at 2-week intervals.;In the DFMO-PCV arm, there were 114 evaluable patients with 78.1% anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), 3.5% anaplastic oligoastrocytoma (AOA), 14% anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO), and 4.4% other malignant gliomas.

Although improved survival estimates for the DFMO-PCV treatment group persisted over the course of the study, analysis of survival differences over the entire follow-up period did not yield significance (P = 0.11). However, careful analysis of the corresponding hazard and hazard ratio functions indicated that the real treatment difference was limited to the first 24 months of follow-up (P = 0.02).

Median survival, measured from registration, was 75.8 and 61.1 months, respectively, for the DFMO-PCV and PCV arms. The treatment effect persisted when the AA histology was separated from AO and AOA histologies. This effect persisted even after adjusting for the covariates of age, Karnofsky performance status, and extent of surgery. There was a statistically significant increase in grade 3 adverse events for diarrhea and anemia associated with DFMO-PCV. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events of nausea, ototoxicity, and thrombocytopenia were not significantly increased among groups.;The addition of DFMO to the nitrosourea-based PCV regimen in this Phase III study demonstrated a sustained benefit in survival probabilities for AG patients but not in the corresponding hazard rates. Survival analysis from registration found a DFMO-PCV median survival of 6.3 years (49 of 114 events), whereas that for PCV alone was 5.1 years (55 of 114 events). The hazard function demonstrated a difference over the first 2 years of study (hazard ratio 0.53, P = 0.02) but not after 2 years (hazard ratio 1.06, P = 0.84), supporting the conclusion that DFMO adds to the survival advantage of PCV chemotherapy for AG patients by direct temporal interaction with PCV.",

Cathepsin B and urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) together are known to be overexpressed in gliomas and, as such, are attractive targets for gene therapy. In the present study, we used plasmid constructs to induce the RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated down-regulation of uPAR and cathepsin B in SNB19 human glioma cells. We observed that the simultaneous down-regulation of uPAR and cathepsin B induces the up-regulation of proapoptotic genes and initiates a collapse in mitochondrial Deltapsi. Cathepsin B and uPAR down-regulated cells showed increases in the expression of activated caspase-8 and DFF40/caspase-activated DNase. Nuclear translocation of AIF and Fas ligand translocation to the cell membrane were also observed. Ki67 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein levels decreased, thereby indicating apoptosis. These results suggest the involvement of uPAR-cathepsin B complex on the cell surface and its role in maintaining the viability of SNB19 glioma cells. In conclusion, RNAi-mediated down-regulation of uPAR and cathepsin B initiates a partial extrinsic apoptotic cascade accompanied by the nuclear translocation of AIF. Our study shows the potential of RNAi-mediated down-regulation of uPAR and cathepsin B in developing new therapeutics for gliomas.",

In Group A (8 patients), the hippocampus was preserved. In Group B (7 patients), glioma removal was associated with hippocampectomy.;No patient died or suffered a permanent deficit after surgery. Postoperatively, in Group A, no patients were seizure free (4 patients were in Engel Class II and 4 were in Class III). In Group B, all 7 patients were seizure free (Class I) (p = 0.02). Only 62.5% of patients returned to work in Group A, whereas all patients are working full time in Group B.

Hippocampal resection allowed seizure control in all patients, with an improvement in KPS scores, since all patients resumed their social and professional activities.

TCTP can promote the growth and suppress apoptosis of tumor cels. However, few studies have reported the effects of TCTP in gliomas. In the present study, a glioma cell line was established, which was stably transfected with TCTP short hairpin ribonucleic acid (shRNA), to investigate the impact of downregulated expression of TCTP on the proliferation, apoptosis and invasion of glioma cells. Western blot and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses demonstrated that TCTP shRNA effectively reduced the expression of TCTP in the U251 glioma cell line. MTT and colony formation assays revealed that downregulated expression of TCTP significantly inhibited glioma cell proliferation. Cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry revealed that the cells in the pRNA‑H1.1‑TCTP group were arrested in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Western blot analysis detected downregulated expression levels of cyclins, including Cyclin D1, Cyclin E and Cyclin B. Annexin V‑fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide and Hoechst staining demonstrated that the apoptotic rate of the cells in the pRNA‑H1.1‑TCTP group was significantly higher than that of the cells in the pRNA‑H1.1‑control group, with upregulated expression levels of B-cell-associated X protein and cleaved‑caspase‑3 and downregulated expression of B-cell lmyphoma-2 in the apoptotic process. Wound healing and Transwell assays revealed that downregulated expression of TCTP significantly inhibited the migration and invasiveness of the glioma cells; and the expression levels and activities of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)‑2 and MMP‑9 were also significantly affected. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that downregulated expression of TCTP significantly inhibited proliferation and invasion, and induced apoptosis in the glioma cells. These results suggested that TCTP may be important in glioma development and metastasis. Therefore, TCTP is expected to become an effective target for glioma gene therapy.",

Since then, it has been shown very convincingly that viruses can directly cause several human cancers by various mechanisms. Epidemiological data imply that viruses are the second most important risk factor for cancer development in humans, exceeded only by tobacco consumption. Although the ability of certain viruses (hepatitis B and C, human papillomavirus, etc) to cause cancer has been time tested and proven scientifically, there are several other potential viral candidates whose role in oncogenesis is more controversial. One such controversial scenario involves the role of cytomegalovirus (CMV) in malignant gliomas, the most common form of primary brain tumour. CMV first attracted attention about a decade ago when CMV gene products were found in glioma tissue but not in normal brain. Since this initial observation, several different groups have shown an oncomodulatory effect of CMV; however, direct association between CMV infection and incidence of glioma is lacking. In this review, we will evaluate the evidence, both preclinical and clinical, regarding the possible role of CMV in gliomagenesis and maintenance. We will also critically evaluate the rationale for using antiviral drugs in the treatment of patients with glioma. ",

Recently described genetic aberrations involving this pathway are critical for tumorigenesis. Tandem duplication of 7q34 encodes BRAF and produces several KIAA1549-BRAF novel oncogenic fusions. Activating point mutations of BRAF, such as BRAF (V600E), also lead to pilocytic astrocytoma. Loss of the NF1 gene allows hyperactivation of the oncogene KRAS. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the novel molecular aberrations described in pilocytic astrocytomas and their clinical relevance for prognosis and treatment. The prognostic indications of these aberrations are discussed with regard to tumor location, tumor pathology, and patient age.

A lack of appropriate models limits the study of this invasion in vivo, which makes it difficult to fully understand its anatomy and the role of dynamic interactions with structures of the normal brain. We developed a novel methodology by utilizing multiphoton laser scanning microscopy (MPLSM) to image the movement of glioma cells deep within the normal brain of live mice in real time. This allowed us to track the invasion of individual RFP-expressing GL261 cells in relation to perfused vasculature or GFP-labeled endothelial cells repetitively over days, up to a depth of 0.5 mm. Glioma cells moved faster and more efficiently when the abluminal site of a blood vessel was utilized for invasion. Cells that invaded perivascularly were frequently found next to (a) multiple capillary structures where microvessels run parallel to each other, (b) capillary loops or glomeruloid-like bodies, and (c) dilated capillaries. Dynamic MPLSM for more than 48 h revealed that single invasive glioma cells induced intussusceptive microvascular growth and capillary loop formation, specifically at the microvascular site with which they had contact. As the main tumor grew by cooption of existing brain vessels, these peritumoral vascular changes may create a beneficial environment for glioma growth.

However, it remains obscure whether PEITC has potential selective lethality to malignant glioma cells. Thus in this study, we performed multiple analysis such as MTT assay, Hoechst 33258 staining, flow cytometry, foci formation, RT-PCR, Western blot, and transfection to explore the selective lethality of PEITC to malignant glioma cells and the underlying mechanisms. We found that PEITC induced a selective apoptosis and suppressed tumorigenicity and migration of malignant glioma cells. Furthermore, we found PEITC significantly induced GSH depletion, ROS production, caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation, and miR-135a upregulation in malignant glioma cells but not in normal cells. Moreover, PEITC activated the miR-135a-mitochondria dependent apoptosis pathway as demonstrated by downregulation of STAT6, SMAD5 and Bcl-xl while upregulation of Bax expression and Cytochrome-C release in malignant glioma cell lines but not in the immortalized human normal glial HEB cells. Correspondingly, the above PEITC-induced activation of the ROS-MiR-135a-Mitochondria dependent apoptosis pathways in malignant glioma was attenuated by pre-transfection with miR-135a inhibitor, pre-treatment with multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) inhibitor Sch B, or combination with glutathione (GSH). These results revealed that PEITC selectively induced apoptosis of malignant glioma cells through MRP1-mediated export of GSH to activate ROS-MiR-135a-Mitochondria dependent apoptosis pathway, suggesting a potential application of PEITC for treating glioma.

Proteases such as MMP9, cathepsin B and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) are over expressed in gliomas and contribute to enhanced cancer cell proliferation. Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair mechanism plays a major role in double strand break (DSB) repair in mammalian cells.;Here we show that silencing MMP9 in combination with uPAR/cathepsin B effects NHEJ repair machinery. Expression of DNA PKcs and Ku70/80 at both mRNA and protein levels in MMP9-uPAR (pMU) and MMP9-cathepsin B (pMC) shRNA-treated glioma xenograft cells were reduced. FACS analysis showed an increase in apoptotic peak and proliferation assays revealed a significant reduction in the cell population in pMU- and pMC-treated cells compared to untreated cells. We hypothesized that reduced NHEJ repair led to DSBs accumulation in pMU- and pMC-treated cells, thereby initiating cell death. This hypothesis was confirmed by reduced Ku70/Ku80 protein binding to DSB, increased comet tail length and elevated γH2AX expression in treated cells compared to control. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that EGFR-mediated lowered DNA PK activity in treated cells compared to controls. Treatment with pMU and pMC shRNA reduced the expression of DNA PKcs and ATM, and elevated γH2AX levels in xenograft implanted nude mice. Glioma cells exposed to hypoxia and irradiation showed DSB accumulation and apoptosis after pMU and pMC treatments compared to respective controls.;Our results suggest that pMU and pMC shRNA reduce glioma proliferation by DSB accumulation and increase apoptosis under normoxia, hypoxia and in combination with irradiation.

Integrin-mediated angiogenesis is hypothesized to play a central role in the development and the progression of central nervous system neoplasms. Accordingly, it is considered a potential target for antiangiogenic therapy. In the current study, we compare the expression of alpha(v)beta(3) in ependymomas, oligodendrogliomas, pilocytic astrocytomas, medulloblastomas, and vestibular schwannomas (acoustic neuromas). Samples of 5 tumors of each of the 5 tumor types were harvested surgically and frozen. After the pathological diagnosis was confirmed, immunohistochemistry was performed using an anti- alpha(v)beta(3) monoclonal antibody (LM609). The expression of alpha(v)beta(3) was assessed using a 4-tiered (0-3) grading scheme reflecting the percentage of positively staining vessels. All vestibular schwannomas demonstrated strong (grade 3) alpha(v)beta(3) expression. The expression was uniformly prominent in Antoni B regions of the tumors. Of 5 ependymomas, 4 demonstrated uniformly strong alpha(v)beta(3). Oligodendrogliomas, medulloblastomas, and pilocytic astrocytomas demonstrated more variable alpha(v)beta(3). alpha(v)beta(3) may contribute significantly to angiogenesis in vestibular schwannomas and ependymomas. Despite the high vascular density of oligodendrogliomas, pilocytic astrocytomas, and medulloblastomas, these tumors had variable moderate alpha(v)beta(3) expression. This discrepancy suggests temporal and/or regional variability in the angiogenesis in these types of tumor. This study provides the first demonstration of alpha(v)beta(3) expression in vestibular schwannomas, medulloblastomas, and pilocytic astrocytomas.",

Therefore, the targeting of mTOR signaling is considered a promising therapy for malignant gliomas. However, the mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effects of a selective mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, on malignant glioma cells are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was thus to elucidate how rapamycin exerts its cytotoxic effects on malignant glioma cells. We showed that rapamycin induced autophagy but not apoptosis in rapamycin-sensitive malignant glioma U87-MG and T98G cells by inhibiting the function of mTOR. In contrast, in rapamycin-resistant U373-MG cells, the inhibitory effect of rapamycin was minor, although the phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase, a molecule downstream of mTOR, was remarkably inhibited. Interestingly, a PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, and an Akt inhibitor, UCN-01 (7-hydroxystaurosporine), both synergistically sensitized U87-MG and T98G cells as well as U373-MG cells to rapamycin by stimulating the induction of autophagy. Enforced expression of active Akt in tumor cells suppressed the combined effects of LY294002 or UCN-01, whereas dominant-negative Akt expression was sufficient to increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to rapamycin. These results indicate that rapamycin exerts its antitumor effect on malignant glioma cells by inducing autophagy and suggest that in malignant glioma cells a disruption of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway could greatly enhance the effectiveness of mTOR inhibitors.",

Here, we show that subtoxic doses of capsaicin effectively sensitize multiple malignant glioma cell lines to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis. Although TRAIL alone mediated partial proteolytic processing of procaspase-3 in glioma cells, cotreatment with capsaicin and TRAIL efficiently restored complete activation of caspases. We found that treatment of various gliomas with capsaicin significantly upregulated DR5, a death receptor of TRAIL, and downregulated the caspase inhibitor survivin. The induction of DR5 was mediated by CHOP/GADD153. The reduction in survivin protein level was associated with downregulation of cyclin B and Cdc2 expression, suggesting that inhibition of Cdc2 activity might contribute to capsaicin-induced survivin downregulation. Taken together, these results indicate that the activity of capsaicin toward DR5 and survivin contributes to the amplification of caspase cascades, thereby restoring TRAIL sensitivity in malignant glioma cells. Interestingly, normal astrocytes were resistant to combined treatment with capsaicin and TRAIL. Neither capsaicin-induced DR5 upregulation/survivin downregulation nor the partial processing of procaspase-3 by TRAIL was induced in astrocytes. Thus, a combined regimen using capsaicin and TRAIL may provide a safe and effective strategy for treating malignant gliomas.",

Although various immune therapies for brain tumors are successful in rodents, there is currently no effective therapy in humans. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms by which intracerebral IL-12 mediates rejection of GL261 cells in a syngenic mouse glioma model. Wild type mice revealed smaller tumors as compared to mice lacking functional T and B cells indicating that considerable immune dependent tumor rejection occurs physiologically in this model. However, glioma rejection was significantly enhanced in mice expressing IL-12 in the CNS and was predominantly dependent on the presence of CD8+ T cells while CD4+ T cells had less impact. Interestingly, the rejection of tumors was independent of IFN-gamma. Our findings contrast results obtained after in vitro or systemic stimulation with IL-12 and demonstrate that successful IL-12 induced glioma rejection critically depends on the localization, duration and time of IL-12 expression.",

We previously unraveled a negative crosstalk between integrin α5β1 and p53 pathway, which was proposed to be part of the resistance of glioblastoma to chemotherapies. The restoration of p53 tumor-suppressor function is under intensive investigations for cancer therapy. However, p53-dependent apoptosis is not always achieved by p53-reactivating compounds such as Nutlin-3a, although full transcriptional activity of p53 could be obtained. Here we investigated whether integrin α5β1 functional inhibition or repression could sensitize glioma cells to Nutlin-3a-induced p53-dependent apoptosis. We discovered that α5β1 integrin-specific blocking antibodies or small RGD-like antagonists in association with Nutlin-3a triggered a caspase (Casp) 8/Casp 3-dependent strong apoptosis in glioma cells expressing a functional p53. We deciphered the molecular mechanisms involved and we showed the crucial role of two anti-apoptotic proteins, phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes 15 (PEA-15) and survivin in glioma cell apoptotic outcome. PEA-15 is under α5β1 integrin/AKT (protein kinase B) control and survivin is a p53-repressed target. Moreover, interconnections between integrin and p53 pathways were revealed. Indeed PEA-15 repression by specific small-interfering RNA (siRNA)-activated p53 pathway to repress survivin and conversely survivin repression by specific siRNA decreased α5β1 integrin expression. This pro-apoptotic loop could be generalized to several glioma cell lines, whatever their p53 status, inasmuch PEA-15 and survivin protein levels were decreased. Our findings identify a novel mechanism whereby inhibition of α5β1 integrin and activation of p53 modulates two anti-apoptotic proteins crucially involved in the apoptotic answer of glioma cells. Importantly, our results suggest that high-grade glioma expressing high level of α5β1 integrin may benefit from associated therapies including integrin antagonists and repressors of survivin expression.

Malignant glioma cells secrete thrombospondin-1 which participates in the motility of glioma cells and binds cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan. To clarify the invasion mechanism of tumor cells, expression of the syndecans (syndecan-1, -2, -3, and -4), a major cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan family, was analyzed in malignant gliomas. Involvement of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) on syndecan-1 expression was also investigated. Using reverse transcription-PCR, the authors analyzed the expression of syndecan-1, -2, -3, and -4 in 10 malignant glioma cell lines, 2 glioblastoma specimens, and 2 normal brain specimens. All malignant glioma cell lines and glioblastoma specimens expressed all types of syndecan mRNA, except in one glioma cell line that lacked syndecan-3 expression. On the other hand, normal brain specimens expressed syndecan-2, -3, and -4 mRNA, but did not syndecan-1 mRNA. Syndecan-1 protein was localized in the cell surface of all malignant glioma cell lines by flow cytometry. Various levels of active nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) was detected in all malignant glioma cell lines using immunoblotting. The expression of active NF-kappaB and syndecan-1 increased in U251 glioma cells after tumor necrosis factor-alpha or interleukin-1beta treatment, which can activate NF-kappaB. The amplification of active NF-kappaB and syndecan-1 by tumor necrosis factor-alpha or interleukin-1beta was suppressed by an inhibitor of NF-kappaB activation (emodin). Emodin also downregulated the expression of syndecan-1 mRNA in U251 cells. These results indicate that malignant glioma cells express all types of syndecans and suggest that NF-kappaB participates in the upregulation of the syndecan-1 expression at the transcriptional level, and increased expression of syndecan-1 could associate with extracellular matrices including thrombospondin-1.",

The aim of this study was to assess the ability of different interleukins (IL), IL-2, IL-12 and IL-21, produced by transduced glioma cells to activate an immune response and trigger intracranial tumor rejection. Such experiments were performed by the use of a slow-growing clone of GL261 (GL D2-60) that was used as orthotopic glioma model. Using GL D2-60-transduced cells, all cytokines elicited an immune response against the tumor. Most notably 100% of the animals receiving a primary implant of IL-21-transduced cells rejected the implant, and 76% of these animals survived to a subsequent rechallenge with GL261 parental cells, while the other transduced cytokine genes were not as effective. Rejection responses were also obtained by admixing wild-type tumor cells with IL-21-producing GL D2-60 cells, indicating a local bystander effect of IL-21. More importantly, IL-21-secreting GL D2-60 cells or 1 microg of rIL-21 protein stereotactically injected into established GL D2-60 tumors were able to trigger glioblastoma rejection in 90 and 77% of mice, respectively. Again most of these mice survived to GL261 rechallenge. Immune mice showed antibody responses to glioma antigens, predominantly involving IgG2a and IgG2b isotypes, which mediated complement- or cell-dependent glioma cell lysis. Antibody responses were crucial for glioma immunotherapy by IL-21-secreting GL D2-60 cells, as immunotherapy was uneffective in syngeneic microMT B-cell-deficient mice. These results suggest that IL-21 should be considered as a suitable candidate for glioma immunotherapy by local delivery.",

The anti-apoptotic b cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) gene is associated with treatment resistance, and is transactivated by the paired box transcription factor 8 (PAX8). In earlier studies, we demonstrated that increased PAX8 expression in glioma cell lines was associated with the expression of telomerase. In this current study, we more extensively explored a role for PAX8 in gliomagenesis.;PAX8 expression was measured in 156 gliomas including telomerase-negative tumours, those with the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism or with a non-defined telomere maintenance mechanism (NDTMM), using immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR. We also tested the affect of PAX8 knockdown using siRNA in cell lines on cell survival and BCL2 expression.;Seventy-two percent of glioblastomas were PAX8-positive (80% telomerase, 73% NDTMM, and 44% ALT). The majority of the low-grade gliomas and normal brain cells were PAX8-negative. The suppression of PAX8 was associated with a reduction in both cell growth and BCL2, suggesting that a reduction in PAX8 expression would sensitise tumours to cell death.;PAX8 is increased in the majority of glioblastomas and promoted cell survival. Because PAX8 is absent in normal brain tissue, it may be a promising therapeutic target pathway for treating aggressive gliomas.",

Treatment with rottlerin significantly decreased Cdc2 activity through the downregulation of cyclin A, cyclin B, and Cdc2 proteins, whereas the sensitizing effect of rottlerin on TRAIL-induced apoptosis was independent of PKCdelta activity.

We assessed cell proliferation by labeling cells with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester and quantifying the fluorescence by FACS analysis. We also examined the cell cycle status using BrdU/propidium iodide double staining and FACS analysis. We evaluated changes in gene expression by microarray analysis following treatment with A-192621 in glioma cells. We examined the role of ETRB by reducing its expression level using small interfering RNA (siRNA).;We report that two ETRB-specific antagonists, A-192621 and BQ788, reduce the number of viable cells in two glioma cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We describe similar results for two melanoma cell lines. The more potent of the two antagonists, A-192621, decreases the mean number of cell divisions at least in part by inducing a G2/M arrest and apoptosis. Microarray analysis of the effects of A-192621 treatment reveals up-regulation of several DNA damage-inducible genes. These results were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. Importantly, reducing expression of ETRB with siRNAs does not abrogate the effects of either A-192621 or BQ788 in glioma or melanoma cells. Furthermore, BQ123, an endothelin receptor type A (ETRA)-specific antagonist, has no effect on cell viability in any of these cell lines, indicating that the ETRB-independent effects on cell viability exhibited by A-192621 and BQ788 are not a result of ETRA inhibition.;While ETRB antagonists reduce the viability of glioma cells in vitro, it appears unlikely that this effect is mediated by ETRB inhibition or cross-reaction with ETRA. Instead, we present evidence that A-192621 affects glioma and melanoma viability by activating stress/DNA damage response pathways, which leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. This is the first evidence linking ETRB antagonist treatment to enhanced expression of DNA damage-inducible genes.",

In this study, we used in vitro and in vivo assays to examine the differentiation effects of wogonin, a major active constituent of Scutellaria baicalensis, on glioma C6 and U251 cells. We found that wogonin can suppress cell proliferation and induce G0/G1 arrest under a concentration-dependent manner. Wogonin also triggered significant reduction in the G1 cell-cycle regulatory proteins cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 and 4 along with overexpression of cell-cycle inhibitory proteins p27. Immunofluorescence and western blot analysis indicated that wogonin increased the expression of lineage-specific differentiation marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). In mechanisms, we verified that wogonin significantly diminished the phosphorylated level of protein kinase B (AKT), and maintenance of low β-catenin expression level was dependent on glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) activation at Ser9. Blocking GSK3β/β-catenin pathway was required for wogonin-induced proliferation inhibition and terminal differentiation by using canonical activator lithium chloride (LiCl) and inhibitor dickkopf-1 (Dkk1). Moreover, intravenous administration of wogonin delayed the growth of C6 glioma in the intracranial tumor model. These findings provide the evidence and mechanistic support for wogonin-based differentiation therapies for malignant glioblastoma. Furthermore, inhibition of GSK3β/β-catenin pathway may be a key and requisite factor in glioma differentiation. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"The tumor suppressor gene PTEN (MMAC1, TEP1) encodes a dual-specificity phosphatase and is considered a progression-associated target of genetic alterations in human gliomas. Recently, it has been reported that the introduction of wild type PTEN into glioma cells containing endogenous mutant PTEN alleles (U87MG, LN-308), but not in those which retain wild-type PTEN (LN-18, LN-229), causes growth suppression and inhibits cellular migration, spreading and focal adhesion. Here, we show that PTEN gene transfer has no effect on the chemosensitivity of the four cell lines. Further, a correlational analysis of the endogenous PTEN status of 12 human glioma cell lines with their sensitivity to seven different cancer chemotherapy drugs reveals no link between PTEN and chemosensitivity. In contrast, ectopic expression of wild type PTEN, but not the PTEN(G129R) mutant, in PTEN-mutant gliomas markedly sensitizes these cells to irradiation and to CD95-ligand (CD95L)-induced apoptosis. PTEN-mediated facilitation of CD95L-induced apoptosis is associated with enhanced CD95L-evoked caspase 3 activity. Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), previously shown to inhibit CD95L-induced apoptosis in nonglial COS7 cells, is inactivated by dephosphorylation. Interestingly, both PTEN-mutant U87MG and PTEN-wild-type LN-229 cells contain phosphorylated PKB constitutively. Wild-type PTEN gene transfer promotes dephosphorylation of PKB specifically in U87MG cells but not in LN-229 cells. Sensitization of U87MG cells to CD95L-apoptosis by wild-type PTEN is blocked by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). The protection by IGF-1 is inhibited by the phosphoinositide 3-OH (PI 3) kinase inhibitor, wortmannin. Although PKB is a down-stream target of PI 3 kinase, the protection by IGF-1 was not associated with the reconstitution of PKB phosphorylation. Thus, PTEN may sensitize human malignant glioma cells to CD95L-induced apoptosis in a PI 3 kinase-dependent manner that may not require PKB phosphorylation.",

Surgical treatment is accepted to be the first line of therapy, with recent studies revealing that maximal possible tumor reduction exerts significant impact on patient outcome. Consideration of tumor localization in relation to functionally eloquent brain areas has been gaining increasing importance. Despite existing assessment methods, the availability of a simple but reliable preoperative grading based on functional data would therefore prove to be indispensable for the prediction of postoperative outcome and hence for overall survival in glioma patients. We performed a clinical investigation comprising 322 patients with gliomas and developed a novel classification system of preoperative tumor status, which considers tumor operability based on two graduations (Friedlein Grading - FG): FGA with lesions at safe distance to eloquent regions which can be completely resected, and FGB referring to tumors which can only be partially resected or biopsied. Investigation of outcome revealed that FGA were characterized by a significantly longer overall survival time compared to FGB. We offer the opportunity to classify brain tumors in a dependable and reproducible manner. The FGA/B grading method provides high prognostic value with respect to overall survival time in relation to the extent of location-dependent tumor resection. ",

Standard tumor destructive treatment of glioma proved to be suppressive for peripheral blood lymphocytes, since all subsets tested revealed statistically significant down regulation. Unlike the lymphocyte counts and activities of patients from the control group who gave preoperative values after 3-6 months), mistletoe treatment induced a statistically significant up regulation of cell counts (CD-3, CD4, CD-8 cells) and activities (CD-25, HLA/DR positive cells) after 3 months, as compared to preoperative values.

Our previous work and that of others strongly suggest a relationship between the infiltrative phenotype of glioma and the expression of cathepsin B and uPAR. Though their role in migration and adhesion are well studied the effect of these molecules on cell cycle progression has not been thoroughly examined.;Cathepsin B and uPAR single and bicistronic siRNA plasmids were used to downregulate these molecules in SNB19 and U251 glioma cells. FACS analysis and BrdU incorporation assay demonstrated G0/G1 arrest and decreased proliferation with the treatments, respectively. Immunoblot and immunocyto analysis demonstrated increased expression of p27(Kip1) and its nuclear localization with the knockdown of cathepsin B and uPAR. These effects could be mediated by alphaVbeta3/PI3K/AKT/FOXO pathway as observed by the decreased alphaVbeta3 expression, PI3K and AKT phosphorylation accompanied by elevated FOXO3a levels. These results were further confirmed with the increased expression of p27(Kip1) and FOXO3a when treated with Ly294002 (10 microM) and increased luciferase expression with the siRNA and Ly294002 treatments when the FOXO binding promoter region of p27(Kip1) was used. Our treatment also reduced the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin D2, p-Rb and cyclin E while the expression of Cdk2 was unaffected. Of note, the Cdk2-cyclin E complex formation was reduced significantly.;Our study indicates that cathepsin B and uPAR knockdown induces G0/G1 arrest by modulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and further increases expression of p27(Kip1) accompanied by the binding of FOXO3a to its promoter.

In glioma, biological assays have shown CAI to be active in inhibiting the phenotypes of invasion and angiogenesis. The exact mechanism of action is not clearly understood, although it appears to work via inhibition of calcium influx in several signal transduction pathways that inhibit cell cycle progression. Recent evidence implicates apoptosis as a contributing mechanism of chemotherapy-induced tumor cytotoxicity. Therefore, we studied the effects of CAI on apoptosis in bovine aortic endothelial cells and a human glioma cell line (U251N) using a variety of methods, including: (a) cell morphology; (b) terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling analysis of in situ DNA strand breaks; (c) agarose gel electrophoresis to visualize DNA fragmentation; and (d) flow cytometry.

Carboplatin dosing was by target area under the curve (AUC) according to the Calvert protocol. Patients were allocated to one of five treatment regimes: cohort A (n = 2) received 50 ng/kg RMP-7 and target AUC 5 mg/ml/min carboplatin; cohort B (n = 3) 100 ng/kg RMP-7 + AUC 5; cohort C (n = 2) 100 ng/kg RMP-7 + AUC 7; cohort D (n = 2) 200 ng/kg RMP-7 + AUC 7; cohort E (n = 5) 300 ng/kg RMP-7 + AUC 7. Treatment was given once every 4 weeks with magnetic resonance imaging scans every 2 months. Patients received 37 cycles in total (median 2, range 1-7). The drug combination, as a cancer treatment, was tolerated in all groups. Effects possibly related to RMP-7 included flushing, nausea, headache and mild increase in heart rate, all transient. 3 patients in cohort E experienced grade 3/4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. These toxicities are consistent with known effects of carboplatin at this dose range. In cohort E (n = 5) 1 patient improved and another remained stable for > or = 6 months. In summary, the dose was escalated to the maximum dose of RMP-7 given to volunteers without additional related side-effects.

Each patient underwent subtotal surgical resection, with a subset receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation. Our primary outcomes of interest were pre-operative and post-operative functional status. One year survival rate was 100%. All patients had stable or improved American Spine Injury Association score immediately after surgery, which was maintained at 3months in 83.3% of patients. Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) was stable at 3month follow up in 50% of patients, but all had decreased KPS 1year after surgery. A subset of patients received post-operative radiation and chemotherapy with 0% tumor recurrence rate at 3months. We assessed the molecular profiles of tumors from two patients in our series and found that each had mutations in TP53, but had wildtype BRAF, IDH-1, and MGMT. Taken together, our data show that patients with high grade spinal cord gliomas have an excellent survival at 1year, but with some decline in functional status within this period.

Macroautophagy was monitored by immunohistochemical analysis employing anti-light chain 3 isoform B (LC3B) and anti-lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) antibodies; chaperone-mediated autophagy was monitored by anti-LAMP2A antibody immunostaining. Furthermore, detection of LC3B protein by Western blotting was performed on six specimens obtained from the preserved frozen tissues of three patients.

By Real-Time-PCR and western blot analysis, we found that TRPV2 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein were expressed in benign astrocyte tissues, and its expression progressively declined in high-grade glioma tissues as histological grade increased (n = 49 cases), and in U87MG cells and in MZC, FCL and FSL primary glioma cells. To investigate the function of TRPV2 in glioma, small RNA interfering was used to silence TRPV2 expression in U87MG cells. As evaluated by RT-Profiler PCR array, siTRPV2-U87MG transfected cells displayed a marked downregulation of Fas and procaspase-8 mRNA expression, associated with upregulation of cyclin E1, cyclin-dependent kinase 2, E2F1 transcriptor factor 1, V-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bcl-X(L)) mRNA expression. TRPV2 silencing increased U87MG cell proliferation as shown by the increased percentage of cells incorporating 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine expressing beta(III)-tubulin and rescued glioma cells to Fas-induced apoptosis. These events were dependent on extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation: indeed inhibition of ERK activation in siTRPV2-U87MG transfected cells by treatment with PD98059, a specific mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor, reduced Bcl-X(L) protein levels, promoted Fas expression, and restored Akt/protein kinase B pathway activation leading to reduced U87MG cell survival and proliferation, and increased sensitivity to Fas-induced apoptosis. In addition, transfection of TRPV2 in MZC glioma cells, by inducing Fas overexpression, resulted in a reduced viability and an increased spontaneous and Fas-induced apoptosis. Overall, our findings indicate that TRPV2 negatively controls glioma cell survival and proliferation, as well as resistance to Fas-induced apoptotic cell death in an ERK-dependent manner.",

We studied the pathologic characteristics of 116 intracranial PAs from 4 institutions representing 3 distinct geographic regions to identify factors that may be associated with biological behavior. The study included 65 boys and 51 girls with a median age of 6 years. Median follow-up for all patients was 101 months, during which time 38 patients had recurrence. Progression-free and overall survivals were better in patients who underwent gross total resection. We were not able to identify any differences in pathologic and molecular markers among the 4 institutions from 3 different countries. However, progression-free survival varied significantly among institutions. Sox-2 was the most prevalent stem cell marker in PA, and many tumors showed synaptophysin positivity. BRAF immunostaining was not useful in determining BRAF duplication. BRAF duplication was more typical of posterior fossa tumors. There was a strong correlation between BRAF duplication and pERK immunostaining, suggesting that the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway is active in these tumors.

The purpose of this study was to determine if the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) from diffusion imaging can help to differentiate between newly diagnosed grade II OD and AC subtypes and to evaluate the ADC and FA values for the mixed population of oligoastrocytomas (OA). Fifty-three patients with newly diagnosed grade II gliomas were studied using a 1.5T whole body scanner (23 ODs, 16 ACs, and 14 OAs). The imaging protocol included post-gadolinium T1-weighted images, T2-weighted images, and either three and/or six directional diffusion imaging sequence with b = 1000 s/mm(2). Diffusion-weighted images were analyzed using in-house software to calculate maps of ADC and for six directional acquisitions, FA. The intensity values were normalized by values from normal appearing white matter (NAWM) to generate maps of normalized apparent diffusion coefficient (nADC) and normalized fractional anisotropy (nFA). The hyperintense region in the T2 weighted image was defined as the T2All region. A Mann-Whitney rank-sum test was performed on the 25th, median, and 75th nADC and nFA among the three subtypes. Logistic regression was performed to determine how well the nADC and nFA predict subtype. Lesions diagnosed as being OD had significantly lower nADC and significantly higher nFA, compared to AC. The nADC and nFA values individually classified the data with an accuracy of 87%. Combining the two did not enhance the classification. The patients with OA had nADC and nFA values between those of OD and AC. This suggests that ADC and FA may be helpful in directing tissue sampling to the most appropriate regions for taking biopsies in order to make a definitive diagnosis.",

ATF5 is an anti-apoptotic protein that is highly expressed in malignant glioma and is essential for glioma cell survival. Accumulating evidence indicates that human malignant gliomas are universally infected with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Recent studies have shown that HCMV may be resistant to the induction of apoptosis by disrupting cellular pathways in glioblastoma. To investigate the potential anti-apoptotic function of HCMV in glioma, malignant U87 glioma cells were infected with HCMV. The present study showed that HCMV infection suppressed apoptosis in glioblastoma U87 cells by regulating the expression of ATF5. Furthermore, in glioblastoma U87 cells, HCMV infection induced cellular proliferation in parallel with an increase in the expression level of ATF5 and B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 to Bcl-2-associated X protein ratio. Loss of ATF5 function was achieved using a dominant-negative form of ATF5 in U87 cells, whereby cells appeared to grow marginally following HCMV infection when compared with the control. However, the anti-apoptotic ability was appeared to decline in the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay. These results indicate that ATF5 signaling pathways may be important in the anti-apoptotic activity of HCMV-infected glioblastoma cells; therefore, the anti-apoptotic molecular mechanisms of HCMV in human glioblastoma cells were investigated in the current study. Prevention of HCMV infection may present a potential and promising approach for the treatment of malignant gliomas.",

Chemoresistance is a common feature of malignant gliomas. Since receptor tyrosine kinases contribute to chemoresistance in tumors, we addressed whether PDGFR signaling might confer selective growth advantage to chemoresistant cells. The effects of the PDGFR inhibitor STI571 on proliferation and PDGFR signaling were compared in chemosensitive and cisplatin-selected, chemoresistant sublines derived from glioma and from two other PDGFR-expressing tumors (ovarian carcinoma and neuroblastoma). The chemoresistant glioma U87/Pt cells were twofold more sensitive to STI571 growth-inhibitory effects than the chemosensitive U87 cells, and two- to threefold more sensitive than five unrelated glioma cell lines. The other two paired cell lines were equally responsive. Sensitization of U87/Pt cells correlated with upregulation of the PDGF-B isoform and with PDGF-BB-induced Akt overactivation, which was prevented by STI571. STI571 specifically inhibited PDGF-BB-, but not PDGF-AA- or stem cell factor-mediated signaling. In serum-containing medium, STI571 decreased phospho-Akt in U87/Pt cells, but not in U87, while activating extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) in both. STI571 antiproliferative effects were partially reverted by constitutively active Akt. Cotreatment with inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K) or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) resulted in enhanced growth inhibition in glioma cells. Our results suggest that increased PDGF-BB signaling may sensitize chemoresistant glioma cells to STI571, suggesting a therapeutic potential for STI571 in patients with malignant gliomas refractory to chemotherapy. Simultaneous blockade of PDGFR and PI3K or Erk pathway may enhance therapeutic targeting in gliomas.",

We also observed that the broad caspase inhibitor, Z-Asp-2, 6-dichlorobenzoylmethylketone rescued pCU-induced apoptosis in U251 cells but not in 5310 cells. Immunoblot analysis of caspase-9 immunoprecipitates for Apaf-1 showed that uPAR and cathepsin B knockdown activated apoptosome complex formation in U251 cells. Downregulation of uPAR and cathepsin B also retarded nuclear translocation and interfered with DNA binding activity of CREB in both U251 and 5310 cells. Further western blotting analysis demonstrated that downregulation of uPAR and cathepsin B significantly decreased expression of the signaling molecules p-PDGFR-β, p-PI3K and p-Akt. An increase in the number of TUNEL-positive cells, increased Bax expression, and decreased Bcl-2 expression in nude mice brain tumor sections and brain tissue lysates confirm our in vitro results.;In conclusion, RNAi-mediated downregulation of uPAR and cathepsin B initiates caspase-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis in U251 cells and caspase-independent mitochondrial apoptosis in 5310 cells.

Its expression and function in brain tumors are, however, not yet known. In this study, we investigated expression of the bisecting GlcNAc structure in a series of pediatric brain tumors and its relationship to tumor response to vinblastine. A plant lectin (E-PHA) that recognizes the bisecting GlcNAc structure was used for detection of this molecule in a total of 90 pediatric brain tumors and normal brain tissue specimens. Our results showed that, whereas E-PHA staining was undetectable in the normal brain tissue, pediatric brain tumor specimens exhibited different levels of reactivity. Lectin staining was particularly prominent in high-grade astrocytomas (73%) and ependymomas (72%). In astrocytomas, there was a positive correlation with the tumor grade, which suggests that the bisecting GlcNAc may be of particular interest as a tumor marker for diagnosis and/or prognosis. By using a human glioma cell culture model, we have found that treatment of these cells with E-PHA lectin enhances their sensitivity to vinblastine. E-PHA interacted directly with the drug transporter P-glycoprotein and inhibited its drug efflux function. In a drug-resistant glioma cell line transfected with the mdr1 gene, drug resistance was reversed by E-PHA.

At the Medical College of Wisconsin, 34 patients less than 15 years of age (median, 7.3 years of age) with cerebellar astrocytomas were seen from 1965 to 1988. Effect of histologic condition and treatment on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was analyzed. Progression was defined as radiographic evidence of an enlarging mass and/or signs and symptoms indicative of advancing disease. Histologic material was reviewed and classified by the system of Winston and Gilles. Twenty-eight patients had glioma A tumors, and six patients had glioma B tumors. For patients with glioma A (n = 28), 5-year actuarial OS rate was 100%. For patients with glioma B (n = 6), 5-year actuarial OS rate was 41%. PFS rate was 66% and 0% for patients with glioma A and glioma B, respectively. The poorer PFS for patients with B histologic tumors was statistically significant (P less than 0.001). The median time to progression was 36 months and 23 months for patients with glioma A and B, respectively. Patients were retrospectively divided into total resection and observation, total resection and irradiation, subtotal resection and observation, and subtotal resection and irradiation groups, which were composed of 12, 2, 3, and 17 patients, respectively. Five-year actuarial OS rates were 100%, 50%, 50%, and 100%, respectively. PFS rates were 60%, 50%, 33% and 58%, respectively. These data support the Gilles classification as a prognostic tool because patients with B tumors had a higher incidence of disease progression and accounted for all deaths.

Tetraarsenic oxide (As4O6 [TAO]) is a trivalent arsenic compound that has potential anticancer and antiangiogenic effects in selected cancer cell lines at a lower concentration than arsenic trioxide (As2O3 [ATO]), which has been more widely tested in vitro and in vivo. The authors tried to determine the cytotoxic concentration of TAO in malignant glioma cell lines and whether TAO would show anti-invasive effects under conditions independent of cell death or apoptosis.;The human phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-deficient malignant glioma cell lines U87MG, U251MG, and U373MG together with PTEN-functional LN428 were cultured with a range of micromolar concentrations of TAO. The invasiveness of the glioma cell lines was analyzed. The effect of TAO on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion and membrane type 1 (MT1)-MMP expression was measured using gelatin zymography and Western blot, respectively. Akt, or protein kinase B, activity, which is a downstream effector of PTEN, was assessed with a kinase assay using glycogen synthesis kinase-3β (GSK-3β) as a substrate and Western blotting of phosphorylated Akt.;Tetraarsenic oxide inhibited 50% of glioma cell proliferation at 6.3-12.2 μM. Subsequent experiments were performed under the same TAO concentrations and exposure times, avoiding the direct tumoricidal effect of TAO, which was confirmed with apoptosis markers. An invasion assay revealed a dose-dependent decrease in invasiveness under the influence of TAO. Both the gelatinolytic activity of MMP-2 and MT1-MMP expression decreased in a dose-dependent manner in all cell lines, which was in accordance with the invasion assay results. The TAO decreased kinase activity of Akt on GSK-3β assay and inhibited Akt phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner in all cell lines regardless of their PTEN status.;These results showed that TAO effectively inhibits proliferation of glioblastoma cell lines and also exerts an anti-invasive effect via decreased MMP-2 secretion, decreased MT1-MMP expression, and the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation under conditions devoid of cytotoxicity. Further investigations using an in vivo model are needed to evaluate the potential role of TAO as an anti-invasive agent.",

Thirty-four patients had been pretreated with a first-line nitrosourea-based chemotherapy regimen (group A), and 19 patients had also been pretreated with a second-line chemotherapy regimen consisting of carboplatin and teniposide (group B). Twenty-one of the patients had also been procarbazine pretreated, whereas the remaining 32 patients were not procarbazine pretreated.;The response was assessed in 51 patients, 28 of whom had glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and 23 of whom had anaplastic astrocytoma (AA). There were two complete responses (CR) (4%) and 13 partial responses (PR) (25.5%). The overall response rate (CR + PR) was 29.5% (SE, 6.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 23 to 35.8). Seventeen patients (32%) had stable disease (SE, 6.2; 95% CI, 21 to 33.6). The median TTP was 13 weeks for patients with GBM and 33 weeks for patients with AA (P = .006). The median survival time (MST) was 27 weeks for patients with GBM and 57 weeks for those with AA (P = .006).;Combined PCB and tamoxifen as a second-line regimen gave a reasonably high response rate in patients with heavily pretreated high-grade gliomas. However, although it resulted in an improvement in the patients' quality of life and/or performance status, it was not followed by an increased TTP or MST.",

We have characterized sphere-cultured glioma-derived cancer-initiating cells (GICs) from experimental gliomas induced by platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) in neonatal Gtv-a Arf(-/-) mice. We found that the GICs can maintain their stem cell-like characteristics in absence of exogenous epidermal growth factor and fibroblast growth factor 2 and that this culture condition was highly selective for tumor-initiating cells where as few as five GICs could induce secondary tumor formation after orthotopic transplantation. Addition of FBS to the medium caused the GICs to differentiate into cells coexpressing glial fibrillary acidic protein and Tuj1, and this differentiation process was reversible, suggesting that the GICs are highly plastic and able to adapt to different environments without losing their tumorigenic properties. On inhibition of virally transduced PDGF-B by small interfering RNA treatment, the GICs stopped proliferating, lost their self-renewal ability, and started to uniformly express CNPase, a marker of oligodendrocyte precursor cells and mature oligodendrocytes. Most importantly, PDGF-B depletion completely abrogated the tumor-initiating capacity of the GICs. Our findings suggest that interfering with PDGF-controlled differentiation could be a therapeutic avenue for patients diagnosed with the PDGF-driven proneural subtype of human glioblastoma.",

With the aim to better understand the resistance/susceptibility processes associated to temozolomide (TMZ) treatment, the current study was performed in three human malignant glioma cell lines by focusing on several levels: (a) apoptotic index and senescence, (b) DNA damage, and (c) interaction of HSPB1 with players of the DNA damage response. Three human glioma cell lines, Gli36, U87, and DBTRG, were treated with TMZ evaluating cell viability and survival, apoptosis, senescence, and comets (comet assay). The expression of HSPA (HSPA1A and HSPA8), HSPB1, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), MLH1, and MSH2 was determined by immunocytochemistry, immunofluorescence, and Western blot. Immunoprecipitation was used to analyze protein interaction. The cell lines exhibited differences in viability, apoptosis, and senescence after TMZ administration. We then focused on Gli36 cells (relatively unstudied) which showed very low recovery capacity following TMZ treatment, and this was related to high DNA damage levels; however, the cells maintained their viability. In these cells, MGMT, MSH2, HSPA, and HSPB1 levels increased significantly after TMZ administration. In addition, MSH2 and HSPB1 proteins appeared co-localized by confocal microscopy. This co-localization increased after TMZ treatment, and in immunoprecipitation analysis, MSH2 and HSPB1 appeared interacting. In contrast, HSPB1 did not interact with MGMT. We show in glioma cells the biological effects of TMZ and how this drug affects the expression levels of heat shock proteins (HSPs), MGMT, MSH2, and MLH1. In Gli36 cells, the results suggest that interactions between HSPB1 and MSH2, including co-nuclear localization, may be important in determining cell sensitivity to TMZ. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"DNA hypermethylation-mediated gene silencing is a frequent and early contributor to aberrant cell growth and invasion in cancer. Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors in adults and the second most common tumor in children. Morbidity and mortality are high in glioma patients because tumors are resistant to treatment and are highly invasive into surrounding brain tissue rendering complete surgical resection impossible. Invasiveness is regulated by the interplay between secreted proteases (eg, cathepsins) and their endogenous inhibitors (cystatins). In our previous studies we identified cystatin E/M (CST6) as a frequent target of epigenetic silencing in glioma. Cystatin E/M is a potent inhibitor of cathepsin B, which is frequently overexpressed in glioma. Here, we study the expression of cystatin E/M in normal brain and show that it is highly and moderately expressed in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, respectively, but not in neurons. Consistent with this, the CST6 promoter is hypomethylated in all normal samples using methylation-specific PCR, bisulfite genomic sequencing, and pyrosequencing. In contrast, 78% of 28 primary brain tumors demonstrated reduced/absent cystatin E/M expression using a tissue microarray and this reduced expression correlated with CST6 promoter hypermethylation. Interestingly, CST6 was expressed in neural stem cells (NSC) and markedly induced upon differentiation, whereas a glioma tumor initiating cell (TIC) line was completely blocked for CST6 expression by promoter methylation. Analysis of primary pediatric brain tumor-derived lines also showed CST6 downregulation and methylation in nearly 100% of 12 cases. Finally, ectopic expression of cystatin E/M in glioma lines reduced cell motility and invasion. These results demonstrate that epigenetic silencing of CST6 is frequent in adult and pediatric brain tumors and occurs in TICs, which are thought to give rise to the tumor. CST6 methylation may therefore represent a novel prognostic marker and therapeutic target specifically altered in TICs.",

The anesthetic-induced reversion of the stellated cell shape seems to be mediated by a number of cellular alterations. Central to the effect is most likely a RhoA/Rho-kinase activation, but also the MAPKK/MEK and the Akt/protein kinase B pathway are activated by the anesthetics. With the use of specific inhibitors we were able to show that activation of the MAPKK/MEK pathway inhibits, whereas activation of the Akt/protein kinase B pathway stimulates the reversal of the stellated cell shape by the anesthetics.

However, few options are effective for patients who experience treatment failure. We conducted a multicenter, phase II study to assess the efficacy and safety of continuous dose-intense TMZ for recurrent GBM. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with malignant glioma at progression after standard TMZ 150 to 200 mg/m(2) x 5 days in a 28-day cycle for three or more cycles were stratified by tumor type (anaplastic glioma group A, GBM, group B). Ninety-one patients with GBM were prospectively divided into three groups (early [B1], extended [B2], and rechallenge [B3]) according to the timing of progression during adjuvant therapy. All patients received continuous dose-intense TMZ 50 mg/m(2)/d for up to 1 year or until progression occurred. Response was assessed by using RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors). Results A total of 116 of 120 patients were evaluable for efficacy. For patients with GBM, 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) was 23.9% (B1, 27.3%; B2, 7.4%; B3, 35.7%). One-year survival from time of study entry was 27.3%, 14.8%, and 28.6% for the B1, B2 and B3 groups, respectively. For patients with anaplastic glioma, 6-month PFS was 35.7%; 1-year survival was 60.7%. The most common grades 3 and 4 nonhematologic toxicities were nausea/vomiting (6.7%) and fatigue (5.8%). Grades 3 and 4 hematologic toxicities were uncommon. CONCLUSION Rechallenge with continuous dose-intense TMZ 50 mg/m(2)/d is a valuable therapeutic option for patients with recurrent GBM. Patients who experience progression during the first six cycles of conventional adjuvant TMZ therapy or after a treatment-free interval get the most benefit from therapy.",

In recent years, several authors showed the benefit of intraoperative ultrasound partially matched with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The aim of this study was to find out if intraoperative neuronavigation in combination with intraoperative ultrasound has any impact on the complete resection of gliomas. A comparison between the ultrasound-controlled resection of brain tumors and operations controlled by navigated ultrasound was performed.;A total of 92 patients (54 men and 39 women) with a mean age of 53.2 years underwent 93 operations over a period of 4 years (2007-2010). They harbored a tumor with suspicion of glioma; 32 of them had undergone previous surgery, and additional chemotherapy, and 29 of them had undergone irradiation. Overall, 49 operations were performed with navigated ultrasound (group A) and 44 with non-navigated ultrasound (group B). A standardized early postoperative MRI was performed . Complete or gross total resection (GTR) was defined by a resection of ≥ 95% of the tumor. Skin incision and craniotomy were planned after registration of the neuronavigation system. The ultrasound system was used systematically before and after opening the dura, and during and at the end of resection.;GTR could be achieved in 28 of 49 cases in group A and in 23 of 44 cases in group B. In group A, sensitivity and specificity of tumor remnants detected by ultrasound were higher than in group B. Concerning recurrent gliomas, the sensitivity of ultrasound visualizing tumor remnants was lower than in primary tumors. In case of preoperatively planned GTR, in both groups (navigated and non-navigated ultrasound) similar tumor remnant sizes were postoperatively detected by MRI. In nine cases the removal was incomplete because of eloquently located tumors. There was no significant difference between navigated and not-navigated ultrasound concerning GTR (p > 0.05).;Navigated ultrasound is an important technical tool that helps in intraoperative orientation.

Comparison of two alternative treatments of cultured C6 (p53(+)) and 9L (p53(-)) rat glioma cells showed significantly reduced survival for both cell lines, especially 9L, when radiation was applied prior to virus versus radiation alone. High p53 protein expression mediated by VV-TK-p53 was measured in infected cells. Single modality treatment of C6 cells with psoralen and UV (PUV)-inactivated VV-TK-p53 (PUV-VV-TK-53) or radiation significantly decreased survival compared with PUV-inactivated L-15 (PUV-L-15) control virus. However, no difference was observed between radiation and combination treatments of C6 cells. In contrast, radiation followed by PUV-VV-TK-53 resulted in dramatic reduction of 9L cell viability, compared to single modality treatment. Flow cytometry analysis of Annexin-V-stained 9L cells showed that radiation and PUV-VV-TK-53 caused a significant decrease in live cells (17.2%) as compared to other treatments and control (61.6-98.3%). Apoptosis was observed in 37.2% of cells, while the range was 0.7-7.8% in other treatment groups; maximal p53 level was measured on day 7 post-infection. In athymic mice bearing C6 tumors, VV-TK-53 plus radiation in both single and multiple therapies resulted in significantly smaller tumors by day 30 compared to the agents given only once. Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor sections demonstrated p53 protein expression over 20 days after VV-TK-53 treatment. Analysis of blood and spleen cells of mice given multiple combination treatments showed significant splenomegaly, leukocytosis, and increased DNA synthesis and response to mitogen. Multiple combination treatments were also associated with significantly elevated natural killer and B cells in the spleen. There were no overt toxicities, although depression in red blood cell and thrombocyte parameters was noted. Collectively, the data demonstrate that radiation significantly improves the efficacy of VV-mediated tumor suppressor p53 therapy and may be a promising strategy for glioma treatment. Furthermore, the results support the conclusion that the mechanisms underlying the enhanced anti-tumor effect of combination treatment include apoptosis/necrosis and upregulation of innate immune defenses.",

Data are available on 64 patients (52 low-grade and 12 high-grade gliomas). DTI-FT was acquired by a 3-T MR scanner with a single-shot EPI sequence (TR/TE 8986/80 ms, b=1000 s/mm) with gradients applied along 32 non-collinear directions. 3D Fast Field Echo (FFE) T1-weighted imaging (TR/TE 8/4 ms) was performed for anatomic guidance. The corticospinal tract (CST), superior longitudinal, inferior fronto-occipital and uncinatus fasciculi were reconstructed. Data were transferred to the neuronavigational system. Functional subcortical sites identified during ISM were correlated with fiber tracts depicted by DTI-FT. In high-grade gliomas, DTI-FT depicted tracts mostly at the tumor periphery; in low-grade gliomas, fibers were frequently located inside the tumor mass. There was a high correlation between DTI-FT and ISM (sensitivity for CST=95%, language tracts=97%). For a proper reconstruction of the tracts, it was necessary to use a low FA threshold of fiber tracking algorithm and to position additional regions of interest (ROIs). The combination of DTI-FT and ISM decreased the duration of surgery, patient fatigue, and intraoperative seizures. Combination of DTI-FT and ISM allows accurate identification of eloquent fiber tracts and enhances surgical performance and safety maintaining a high rate of functional preservation.",

Here we show that TMZ and BCNU have an earlier effect on nuclear organization and chromatin structure. In particular, we report that TMZ and BCNU induce clustering of pericentromeric heterochromatin regions and increase the amount of heterochromatic proteins MeCP2 and HP1alpha bound to chromatin. These drugs also decrease global levels of histone H3 acetylation and increase levels of histone H3 trimethylated on lysine 9 (H3-triMeK9). These events precede the senescence status. We conclude that TMZ and BCNU efficacy in glioma treatment may implicate a first event characterized by changes in heterochromatin organization and its silencing which is then followed by apoptosis and senescence.",

Finally, we analyzed whether the DNA methylation level could be used as a prognostic factor and/or a biomarker in an antiglioma therapy using folate supplementation as an adjuvant.;Our data show that gliomagenesis is accompanied by a reduction in 5 mC levels and that this low level of 5 mC is a poor prognostic factor in Glioblastoma Multiforme patients. We also show that folate supplementation enhanced the DNA remethylation through the Sp1/Sp3-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of genes coding for Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b proteins, two de novo methyltranferases. Finally, we show that the folate-induced DNA methylation limits proliferation and increases the sensitivity to temozolomide-induced apoptosis in glioma cells through methylation of the genes implicated in these processes (PDGF-B, MGMT, survivin, and bcl-w).;This study suggests that folate supplementation could be a promising adjuvant for the future design of antiglioma therapies in preclinical and/or clinical studies.",

In this study, the human glioblastoma cell line U87 was stably transfected with a lentivirus vector expressing a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting AKT2. Knockdown of AKT2 by the shRNA inhibited U87 cell proliferation and increased the rate of apoptosis. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analysis revealed that cells stably underexpressing AKT2 showed lower expression of the anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and enhanced expression of the apoptosis effector caspase-3 compared to U87 cells stably transfected with a control vector. Furthermore, expression levels of AKT2 were correlated with the IC50 of the antitumor drug VM-26 (teniposide); the VM-26 IC50 was reduced from 6.46±0.42μg/ml in control glioma cells to 1.15±0.22μg/ml in U87 cells underexpressing AKT2. Combined AKT2 knockdown and VM-26 treatment inhibited cell proliferation in vitro more effectively than either treatment alone. Knockdown of AKT2 expression was associated with decreased expression of the multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) without affecting MRP1 mRNA expression. However, the mRNA and protein levels of MDR1 (p-glycoprotein) were unaffected by AKT2 knockdown. These results indicate that inhibition of AKT2 expression may be an effective means for overcoming AKT2-associated chemoresistance in human malignant glioma cells and may represent a potential gene-targeting approach to treat glioma.",

Mice were injected s.c. with U87 cells. Tumors were allowed to grow to a size of approximately 0.5 x 0.5 cm (after about 3 weeks), and the mice were randomized to receive either: (a) 100 mg/kg AG3340 in vehicle; or (b) vehicle control (0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose, 0.1% pluronic F68), both given daily i.p. Tumor area was measured twice weekly, and animals were sacrificed when moribund, or earlier if premorbid histology was examined. In vivo inhibition of tumor growth was profound, with AG3340 decreasing tumor size by 78% compared with controls after 31 days (when controls were sacrificed; P < 0.01, Wilcoxon test). Control animals survived 31 days after the i.p. injections began, and AG3340 mice survived 71 days, representing a >2-fold increase in survival associated with tumor growth delay. Histological examination found that AG3340-treated tumors were smaller, had lower rates of proliferation, and significantly less invasion than control-treated tumors. Hepatic or pulmonary metastases were not seen in either group. In a separate experiment, the tumors were smaller and sampled after a shorter duration of treatment; the changes in proliferation were more marked and occurred earlier than differences in tumor invasion between the two groups. Furthermore, in vitro cell growth was not inhibited at AG3340 concentrations of <1 mM. AG3340 plasma concentrations in vivo, 1 h after administration, ranged from 67 to 365 nM. Thus, AG3340 produced a profound inhibition of glioma tumor growth and invasion. AG3340 markedly increased survival in this in vivo glioma model.

The purpose of the present study was to determine the efficacy of boronated epidermal growth factor (EGF) either alone or in combination with boronophenylalanine (BPA) as delivery agents for an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) -positive glioma, designated F98(EGFR). A heavily boronated precision macromolecule [boronated starburst dendrimer (BSD)] was chemically linked to EGF by heterobifunctional reagents. Either F98 wild-type (F98(WT)) receptor (-) or EGFR gene-transfected F98(EGFR) cells, which expressed 5 x 10(5) receptor sites/cell, were stereotactically implanted into the brains of Fischer rats, and 2 weeks later biodistribution studies were initiated. For biodistribution studies rats received an intratumoral (i.t.) injection of (125)I-labeled BSD-EGF and were euthanized either 6 or 24 h later. At 6 h, equivalent amounts of BSD-EGF were detected in F98(EGFR) and F98(WT) tumors. Persistence of the bioconjugate in F98(EGFR) tumors was specifically determined by EGFR expression. By 24 h 33.2% of injected dose/g of EGF-BSD was retained by F98(EGFR) gliomas compared with 9.4% % of injected dose/g in F98(WT) gliomas, and the corresponding boron concentrations were 21.1 microg/g and 9.2 microg/g, respectively. Boron concentrations in normal brain, blood, liver, kidneys, and spleen all were at nondetectable levels (<0.5 microg/g). On the basis of these results, BNCT was initiated at the Brookhaven National Laboratory Medical Research Reactor. Two weeks after implantation of 10(3) F98(EGFR) or F98(WT) tumor cells, rats received an i.t. injection of BSD-EGF (approximately 60 microg (10)B/approximately 15 microg EGF) either alone or in combination with i.v. BPA (500 mg/kg). Rats were irradiated at the Brookhaven Medical Research Reactor 24 h after i.t. injection, which was timed to coincide with 2.5 h after i.v. injection of BPA for those animals that received both capture agents. Untreated control rats had a mean survival time (MST) +/- SE of 27 +/- 1 day, and irradiated controls had a MST of 31 +/- 1 day. Animals bearing F98(EGFR) gliomas, which had received i.t. BSD-EGF and BNCT, had a MST of 45 +/- 5 days compared with 33 +/- 2 days for animals bearing F98(WT) tumors (P = 0.0032), and rats that received i.t. BSD-EGF in combination with i.v. BPA had a MST of 57 +/- 8 days compared with 39 +/- 2 days for i.v. BPA alone (P = 0.016). Our data are the first to show in vivo efficacy of BNCT using a high molecular weight boronated bioconjugate to target amplified EGFR expressed on gliomas, and they provide a platform for the future development of combinations of high and low molecular weight agents for BNCT.",

Here, we present an immunohistochemical analysis of the expression pattern of ET-1 receptor subtypes (ET(A)-R and ET(B)-R) and a functional study of their potential role in human oligodendrogliomas and oligoastrocytomas. By comparison, we assessed the corresponding expression patterns of glioblastomas. Interestingly, a nuclear localization of ET-1 receptor subtypes (associated or not with a cytoplasmic labeling) was constantly observed in tumor cells from all three glioma types. Moreover, we noted a distinct receptor distribution in the different gliomas: a nuclear expression of ET(B)-R by tumor cells was found to be restricted to oligodendrogliomas and oligoastrocytomas, while a nuclear expression of ET(A)-R was only detected in tumor cells from some glioblastomas. Using primary cultures of oligodendroglial tumor cells, we confirmed the selective expression of nuclear ET(B)-R, together with a plasma membrane expression, and further demonstrated that this receptor was functionally coupled to intracellular signaling pathways known to be involved in cell survival and/or proliferation: extracellular signal-regulated kinase and focal adhesion kinase activation, actin cytoskeleton reorganization. In addition, impairment of ET(B)-R activation in these cells by in vitro treatment with an ET(B)-R-specific antagonist induced cell death. These data point to ET-1 as a possible survival factor for oligodendrogliomas via ET(B)-R activation and suggest that ET(B)-R-specific antagonists might constitute a potential therapeutic alternative for oligodendrogliomas.",

Ninety MRI studies were performed of 18 patients with malignant glioma before and 6, 18, 26, 52, and 72 weeks after the end of stereotactic radiotherapy. The signal time courses of the contrast-enhanced tumors were analyzed using a pharmacokinetic two-compartment model that calculates for the parameter A, reflecting the degree of MRI signal enhancement [no units] and the exchange rate constant k21 [min(-1)]. Before radiotherapy, the amplitude A was significantly (P < .05) lower in patients with subsequent local tumor control (n = 8; mean A = .34 +/- .15) compared to patients without subsequent local tumor control (n = 10; mean A = .94 +/- .71). In the local tumor control group, early after stereotactic radiotherapy (at 6-18 weeks), there was a significant (P < .05) time-dependent decrease in the parameter k21, whereas there was still no alteration in the tumor volume. A low amplitude A before radiotherapy, combined with an early drop of k21 after stereotactic radiotherapy, reliably characterized the group of patients with subsequent tumor volume decrease. Our preliminary results suggest that two contrast-enhanced dynamic MR studies, one before and one early after stereotactic radiotherapy, offer important information on local tumor control within the first 6 to 18 weeks after stereotactic radiotherapy. Moreover, this response may be evidenced before tumor volume changes and provides a therapeutic window to broaden treatment options and to improve treatment outcome.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The expression of inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family members contributes to the resistance of human cancers to apoptosis induced by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. We report that the infection of malignant glioma cells and several other tumor cell lines with adenoviruses encoding antisense RNA to X-linked IAP (XIAP) depletes endogenous XIAP levels and promotes global caspase activation and apoptosis. In contrast, non-neoplastic SV-FHAS human astrocytes and other non-neoplastic cells express XIAP at very low levels and resist these effects of adenovirus-expressing XIAP antisense RNA (Ad-XIAP-as). Caspase inhibitors such as z-Val-Ala-DL-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk) delay caspase processing and XIAP depletion, suggesting that XIAP depletion results both from antisense-mediated interference with protein synthesis and proteolytic cleavage by activated caspases. However, zVAD-fmk neither prevents nor delays cell death, indicating a caspase-independent pathway to cell death triggered by IAP depletion. Similarly, B-cell lymphoma-X(L) (BCL-X(L)) inhibits caspase activity, but fails to rescue from apoptosis. Loss of p65/nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) protein and NF-kappaB activity is an early event triggered by Ad-XIAP-as and probably involved in Ad-XIAP-as-induced apoptosis. Finally, Ad-XIAP-as gene therapy induces cell death in intracranial glioma xenografts, prolongs survival in nude mice and may reduce tumorigenicity in synergy with Apo2L/TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in vivo. Altogether, these data define a powerful survival function for XIAP and reinforce its possible role as a therapeutic target in human glioma cells.",

The major goal of the present study was to construct a plasmid-based bax gene vector (pGL1-Bax) and evaluate its expression in vitro and in vivo using athymic mice with subcutaneously growing C6 glioma. Preliminary experiments of efficacy and safety were also performed using pGL1-Bax alone and in combination with previously constructed pGL1-TNF-alpha, as well as with radiation. pGL1-Bax was expressed by C6 cells and was correlated with apoptosis, indicating that the construct and the bax protein were functional. Although intratumoral injections of pGL1-Bax alone, up to total doses of 450 micro g, did not significantly affect tumor growth, consistently smaller tumors were obtained when pGL1-TNF-alpha plus pGL1-Bax were injected 16-18 hr prior to tumor irradiation. Furthermore, in mice with two tumors, one treated and one untreated, progression of the untreated tumor was delayed in the animals receiving all three modalities. No prohibitive toxicities were noted, based on mouse body weights and in vitro assays of blood and spleen. Significant increases in spleen mass, total leukocyte counts, percentage of granulocytes, spontaneous blastogenesis, and CD71-expressing B cells were primarily associated with tumor presence and not treatment type. Overall, the results are promising and suggest that TNF-alpha/Bax gene therapy may be beneficial against highly malignant tumors of the brain.

The Ad-uPAR-Cath B-infected cells revealed a marked reduction in tumor growth and invasiveness as compared with the parental and vector controls.

Furthermore, using a near infrared fluorescence probe, in vivo imaging for cathepsin B indicated low/undetectable levels of fluorescence after injection of the Ad-uPAR-Cath B construct into pre-established s.c. tumors as compared with Ad-CMV-treated and untreated tumors. The effect with bicistronic construct (Ad-uPAR-Cath B) was much higher than with single (Ad-uPAR/Ad-Cath B) constructs.

In this study, we have investigated 6-OHDA-induced nitrosative cell death and its self-defense mechanism in C6 glioma cells. Treatment of C6 cells with 6-OHDA increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and subsequent production of nitric oxide (NO). Furthermore 6-OHDA treatment led to peroxynitrite generation and nitrotyrosine formation. 6-OHDA-induced nitrosative stress ultimately caused apoptotic cell death as determined by decreased Bcl-2/Bax ratio, activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and cleavage of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP), which were attenuated by peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst, 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)prophyrinato iron(III) (FeTPPS). In another experiment, exposure of C6 glioma cells to 6-OHDA resulted in an increased expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and 6-OHDA-induced cytotoxicity was effectively suppressed by the HO-1 inducer SnCl(2) and aggravated by HO-1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP), supporting the cytoprotective role of HO-1. To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying 6-OHDA-mediated HO-1 induction, we have examined the possible involvement of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which plays an important role in the transcriptional regulation of phase II detoxifying and antioxidant enzymes. 6-OHDA treatment increased nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of Nrf2, which seemed to be partly mediated by activation of upstream kinases such as Akt/protein kinase B (PKB). Taken together these findings suggest that HO-1 up-regulation via Nrf2 activation may mediate the cellular adaptive survival response to 6-OHDA-induced nitrosative cell death in C6 glioma cells.",

Radiology and pathology were reviewed by central independent reviewers. Paraffin shavings for RNA extraction were taken and tested for fusion events involving KIAA1549:BRAF. Tumors were classified as unilateral or bithalamic based on their origin on imaging. Univariate and multivariate analyses on factors influencing survival were performed.;Seventy-two thalamic tumors were identified from 11 institutions. Females represented 53% of the study population, and the mean age at presentation was 8.9 years. Sixty-two tumors were unilateral and 10 bithalamic. Unilateral tumors had a greater propensity to grow inferiorly towards the brainstem. These tumors were predominantly low grade in comparison to bithalamic tumors which were high-grade astrocytomas. The 5-year overall survival was 61 ± 13% for unithalamic tumors compared to 37 ± 32% for bithalamic tumors (p = 0.097). Multivariate analysis indicated tumor grade as the only significant prognostic factor for unithalamic tumors. Six unilateral tumors, all low grade, were BRAF fusion positive.;Unilateral and bilateral thalamic tumors behave differently. Surgical resection is an appropriate treatment option in unilateral tumors, most of which are low grade, but outcome is not related to extent of resection (EOR). Bilateral thalamic tumors have a poorer prognosis, but the occasional patient does remarkably well. The efficacy of chemotherapy and radiotherapy has not been clearly demonstrated. Novel therapeutic approaches are required to improve the prognosis for malignant unilateral thalamic tumors and bilateral thalamic tumors.",

Boron-10 is known to accumulate selectively only in brain tumor cells. This work was aimed to clarify the subcellular biodistribution of BSH in a rat glioma model using immunohistochemical approach. Wistar rats were used for this experiment. An intracerebral injection of 5.0 x 10(6) C6 glioma cells was introduced into the region of cerebral hemisphere. Fifty milligrams of \"'B/kg BSH was infused intravenously two weeks after implantation. Host rats were divided into six groups according to the sampling time: 1, 4, 8, 16, 24 and 48 h after the start of BSH infusion. Immunohistochemical study was carried out using anti-BSH antibody. Boron was already found in a whole cell 1 h after BSH infusion, and then seemed to collect in a cell nuclei around 8-16 h after infusion. It was still recognized in tumor cell 48 h after infusion. This study supports the following hypothesis on selective boron uptake in a tumor. BSH can pass through the disrupted blood-brain barrier (BBB) easily and can come in contact with tumor cells; there, BSH can bind on the extracellular surface of plasma membrane to choline residues. After binding to the plasma membrane, boron with choline residues may be internalized into the cell by endocytic pathways and eventually travel to cell nuclei, and then stay there for a long time.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The intrinsic radioresistance of certain cancer cells may be closely associated with the constitutive activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activity, which may lead to protection from apoptosis. Recently, nonapoptotic cell death, or autophagy, has been revealed as a novel response of cancer cells to ionizing radiation. In the present study, the authors analyzed the effect of pitavastatin as a potential inhibitor of NF-kappaB activation on the radiosensitivity of A172, U87, and U251 human glioma cell lines.;The pharmacological inhibition of NF-kappaB activation was achieved using pitavastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. Growth and radiosensitivity assays were performed using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Hoechst 33258 staining, supravital acridine orange staining, and electron microscopy were performed utilizing 3 glioma cell lines with or without pitavastatin pretreatment to identify apoptosis or autophagy after irradiation.;The growth of these 3 glioma cell lines was not significantly inhibited by pitavastatin at a concentration of up to 1 microM. Treatment with 0.1 microM of pitavastatin enhanced radiation-induced cell death in all glioma cell lines, with different sensitivity. Apoptosis did not occur in any pretreated or untreated (no pitavastatin) cell line following irradiation. Instead, autophagic cell changes were observed regardless of the radiosensitivity of the cell line. An inhibitor of autophagy, 3-methyladenine suppressed the cytotoxic effect of irradiation with pitavastatin, indicating that autophagy is a result of an antitumor mechanism. Using the most radiosensitive A172 cell line, the intracellular localization of p50, a representative subunit of NF-kappaB, was evaluated through immunoblotting and immunofluorescence studies. The NF-kappaB of A172 cells was immediately activated and translocated from the cytosol to the nucleus in response to irradiation. Pitavastatin inhibited this activation and translocation of NF-kappaB.;Autophagic cell death rather than apoptosis is a possible mechanism of radiation-induced and pitavastatin-enhanced cell damage, and radiosensitization by the pharmacological inhibition of NF-kappaB activation may be a novel therapeutic strategy for malignant gliomas.",

Our objectives are to identify factors that influence the uptake and retention of BOPP in vitro and to determine BOPP distribution in a human glioma cell line in vitro. This information will aid the development of compounds and treatment strategies that increase the effectiveness of BNCT therapy for GBM.;The amount, distribution pattern, and site of internalization of BOPP were assessed using fluorescence microscopy. Living human glioma (SF-767) cells were imaged after a 24-h exposure to BOPP (20-135.6 microg/ml, normal serum). Dose-dependent uptake of BOPP was determined using both fluorescence microscopy of individual living cells and inductively-coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) analysis of cell pellets. Lysosome- or mitochondria-specific fluorescent probes were used to identify the cellular compartment containing BOPP. Two human fibroblast cell lines, AG-1522 (LDL receptor-positive) and GM019-15C (LDL receptor-deficient), were used to investigate LDL receptor-dependent BOPP uptake. The dependence of BOPP uptake on lipoproteins in the media was determined by exposing each of the three cell types to BOPP in medium containing either normal (NS) or lipoprotein deficient serum (LPDS).;BOPP accumulated in the lysosomes of human glioma cells in vitro, and not in the mitochondria, as reported for C6 rat glioma cells in vitro. BOPP uptake was concentration-dependent and was also dependent on the amount of lipoproteins in the medium. Over the range of incubation concentrations studied and at the single exposure duration time point investigated (24 h), all cells retained a similar amount of BOPP. At the lowest incubation concentration (20 microg/ml, NS), the amount of boron retained was near 10(9) atoms per cell (15 microg B/g cells). Lysosomes containing high concentrations of BOPP were randomly distributed throughout the cytoplasm; however, larger lysosomes containing BOPP were concentrated around the cell nucleus. Little or no BOPP accumulated in the cell nucleus. At incubation concentrations of 20 and 40 microg/ml (24-h time point), BOPP uptake in SF-767 cells was reduced in LPDS compared with NS (66% reduction). A similar result was observed for normal human fibroblasts (AG-1522 cells, 40 microg/ml, 24 h). At 40 microg/ml, in both NS and LPDS at 24 h, BOPP accumulation in LDL receptor-deficient human fibroblasts (GM019-15C cells) was reduced relative to AG-1522 cells. BOPP accumulation in GM019-15C cells (40 microg/ml, 24 h) was not affected by serum lipoprotein levels.;In cell culture, BOPP is taken up by human glioma cells via the LDL pathway and is compartmentalized into cellular lysosomes. Knowledge of this mechanism of BOPP uptake and retention will be important in attempts to modify toxicity and efficacy of this drug.",

Flow cytometric analyses were carried out to measure the cell-cycle, apoptosis, and mitotic index. Mitotic catastrophe was detected by immunofluorescence. The efficacy of NVP-BKM120 was tested using intracranial U87 glioma model.;We tested the biologic effects of a selective PI3K inhibitor NVP-BKM120 in a set of glioma cell lines. NVP-BKM120 treatment for 72 hours resulted in a dose-dependent growth inhibition and effectively blocked the PI3K/Akt signaling cascade. Although we found no obvious relationship between the cell line's sensitivity to NVP-BKM120 and the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) statuses, we did observe a differential sensitivity pattern with respect to p53 status, with glioma cells containing wild-type p53 more sensitive than cells with mutated or deleted p53. NVP-BKM120 showed differential forms of cell death on the basis of p53 status of the cells with p53 wild-type cells undergoing apoptotic cell death and p53 mutant/deleted cells having a mitotic catastrophe cell death. NVP-BKM120 mediates mitotic catastrophe mainly through Aurora B kinase. Knockdown of p53 in p53 wild-type U87 glioma cells displayed microtubule misalignment, multiple centrosomes, and mitotic catastrophe cell death. Parallel to the assessment of the compound in in vitro settings, in vivo efficacy studies using an intracranial U87 tumor model showed an increased median survival from 26 days (control cohort) to 38 and 48 days (treated cohorts).;Our present findings establish that NVP-BKM120 inhibits the PI3K signaling pathways, leading to different forms of cell death on the basis of p53 statuses.

These improvements began with the demonstration of a survival benefit when daily temozolomide was administered with 6 weeks of standard radiation and for 6 months thereafter. This treatment regimen is often associated with significant lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and progressive blood-brain barrier dysfunction that can result in clinical and radiologic deterioration without true tumor progression (\"pseudoprogression\"). With new evidence that combining this cytotoxic agent with radiation improves survival in this malignancy, many investigators have modified the regimen to further improve patient outcomes. These largely uncontrolled studies highlight controversies regarding the optimal therapy of this disease. This review focuses on the following selected controversies: (a) What is the appropriate temozolomide dose, schedule, and duration in the postradiation period? (b) How should other U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies (such as carmustine wafers and bevacizumab) be incorporated into this treatment regimen? (c) Should the results in glioblastoma be extrapolated to patients aged >70 and to patients with lower grade gliomas? and (d) How should novel therapeutic approaches be added to radiation and temozolomide in clinical trials for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma?",

Binding of FGFs triggers the intracellular Ras/Raf/ERK signaling pathway leading to cell proliferation. Down-regulation of FGFR1 and, consequently, inactivation of its signaling pathways represent novel treatment strategies for glioblastoma. In this study, we investigated the internalization and endocytic trafficking of FGFR1 in the human glioma cell line U373. Stimulation with FGF-2 induced cell rounding accompanied by increased BrdU and pERK labeling. The overexpression of FGFR1 (without FGF treatment) resulted in enhanced phosphorylated FGFR1 suggesting receptor autoactivation. Labeled ligand (FGF-2-Cy5.5) was endocytosed in a clathrin- and caveolin-dependent manner. About 25 % of vesicles carrying fluorescently tagged FGFR1 represented early endosomes, 15 % transferrin-positive recycling endosomes and 40 % Lamp1-positive late endosomal/lysosomal vesicles. Stimulation with FGF-2 increased the colocalization rate in each of these vesicle populations. The treatment with the lysosomal inhibitor leupeptin resulted in FGFR1 accumulation in lysosomes, but did not enhance receptor recycling as observed in neurons. Analysis of vesicle distributions revealed an accumulation of recycling endosomes in the perinuclear region. In conclusion, the shuttling of receptor tyrosine kinases can be directly visualized by overexpression of fluorescently tagged receptors which respond to ligand stimulation and follow the recycling and degradation pathways similarly to their endogenous counterparts.",

Immunotherapy could offer a possibility to eradicate remnant tumor cells after conventional therapy. Experimental immunotherapy can induce partial cure of established intracerebral tumors in several rodent models. One reason for the limited therapeutic effects could be immunosuppression induced by both the growing tumor and the induced immune reaction. NO has been implicated in tumor-derived immune suppression in tumor-bearing hosts, and unspecific inhibitors of NO synthase have been shown to boost antitumor immunity. In this study, we show that the inducible NO synthase (iNOS)-specific inhibitor mercaptoethylguanidine (MEG) superiorly enhanced lymphocyte reactivity after polyclonal stimulation compared with the iNOS-specific inhibitor L-NIL and the unspecific NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME. Both iNOS inhibitors increased the number and proliferation of T cells but not of B cells. When combined during postimmunization with IFN-gamma-secreting N32 rat glioma cells of rats harboring intracerebral tumors, only MEG increased the cure rate. However, this was only achieved when MEG was administered after immunizations. These findings implicate that NO has both enhancing and suppressive effects after active immunotherapy.",

Resistant tumors were obtained and characterized, as were tumors that reverted to sensitivity. Characterization included expression profiling, assessment of MEK signature and compensatory pathways, MEK inhibition, BRAF expression, and cytokine levels. Combination treatment of BT-40/AZD-resistant tumors with the MEK inhibitor and a STAT3 inhibitor (LLL12) was assessed.;Resistance was unstable, tumors reverting to selumetinib sensitivity when passaged in untreated mice, and MEK was equally inhibited in sensitive and resistant tumors by selumetinib. Drug resistance was associated with an enhanced MEK signature and increased interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 expression. Selumetinib treatment induced phosphorylation of STAT3 (Y705) only in resistant xenografts, and similar results were observed in BRAF(V600E) astrocytic cell lines intrinsically resistant to selumetinib. Treatment of BT-40-resistant tumors with selumetinib or LLL12 had no significant effect, whereas combined treatment induced complete regressions of BT-40/AZD-resistant xenografts.;Resistance to selumetinib selected in vivo in BT-40 tumor xenografts was unstable. In resistant tumors, selumetinib activated STAT3, and combined treatment with selumetinib and LLL12 induced complete responses in resistant BT-40 tumors.

As oncomirs promote growth of cancer cells and support survival during chemotherapy, thus microRNA-silencing therapies could be a valuable approach to be associated with anticancer drugs and chemotherapy treatments. miR-155 microRNA was found overexpressed in different types of cancer, such as leukaemias (PML, B-cell lymphomas), lung cancer and glioblastoma. GABA-A receptor downregulation was found correlated with glioma grading, with decreasing levels associated with higher grade of malignancies. A relationship between knock-down of miR-155 and re-expression of GABRA 1 protein in vivo was recently individuated. This finding has implication on the effectiveness of RNA-silencing approaches against miR-155 with the scope to control proliferation and signalling pathways regulated by GABA-A receptor. Applying microRNAs for treatment of brain tumours poses several problems, and fields to be solved are mainly the passage of the brain-blood barrier and the targeted delivery to specific cell types. Glioblastoma multiforme cells bud off microvesicles that deliver cytoplasmic contents to nearby cells. Thus, the exploitation of these mechanisms to deliver antagomir therapeutics targeting microvescicles in the brain could take the lead in the near future in the treatment for brain cancers in substitution of invasive surgical intervention.",

The initial course of radiation consisted of 3000 cGy whole brain in ten fractions 5 days a week. After a 2-week rest, treatment was continued to a portal restricted to the computerized tomography scan demonstrated abnormality plus a margin for an additional 2100 cGy (total 5100 cGy/17 fx/36 days). The optic chiasm and hypothalamus were excluded from the high dose region. Following review of all pathologic specimens, three patients with grade II glioma, three lacking histologic confirmation, two unbiopsied and eleven not receiving the prescribed treatment were excluded from the survival analysis. No patients were lost to follow-up. Surviving patients were followed 85 months (median); range 68-125 months. All remaining patients were followed until death. The median actuarial survival for 73 grade III and IV patients was 12.5 months. The 5-year actuarial survival was 10%. The median survival for 54 grade IV patients was 10 months. The 5-year survival was 4%. For 19 grade III patients the median survival was 22.5 months. The 5-year survival was 26%. There was one long-term grade IV survivor (68 mos.) and four long-term grade III survivors (76, 85, 108, 125 mos). No patient developed optic nerve or chiasm injury. One patient, an 85 months survivor, had biopsy documented radionecrosis and hemiparesis. The incidence of necrosis among 62 patients alive 6 months or more (and therefore at risk of brain necrosis) is 1/62 (2%). The incidence among survivors is 1/5. The nominal standard dose for this regimen is 1749 ret. The predictive value of the \"nominal standard dose\" and \"equivalent dose\" formulae for brain necrosis is explored. We conclude (a) that this regimen provides a survival probability equivalent to conventional treatment for grade III and IV supratentorial gliomas, (b) that neither the equivalent nor nominal standard doses predicted the incidence of brain necrosis, (c) that the time dose schedule is well tolerated and has an acceptable risk-benefit ratio, (d) that its advantage to the patient is decreased time requirement and cost.",

Here, we show that two glioblstoma U251 cell clones stably expressing LRRC4 were established. LRRC4 expression significantly inhibited the expression of some cytokines and their receptors determined by microarray and Western blot assays, and dramatically reduced cytokine-induced AP-1, NF-kB, and CyclinD1 activation in glioma cells. Furthermore, LRRC4 expression in glioma cells significantly downregulated spontaneous and cytokine-induced expression of K-RAS and phosphorylation of c-Raf, ERK, AKT, NF-kBp65, p70S6K, and PKC, suggesting that LRRC4 inhibited receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathways. Moreover, treatment with bFGF, IGF1, or IGF2 stimulated LRRC4(-/-), but not the LRRC4(+), glioma cell proliferation, indicating that LRRC4 mitigated cytokine-stimulated proliferation in glioma cells. In addition, treatment of LRRC4(-/-) glioma cells with EGF, IGF2, or PDGF promoted long distance mobilization, but induced little migration in LRRC4(+) glioma cells, suggesting that LRRC4 retarded cytokine-promoted glioma cell migration in vitro. Finally, human vessel endothelial cells (ECV304) treated with VEGF grew, aligned and formed hollow tube-like structures in vitro. In contrast, LRRC4(+) ECV304 treated with VEGF failed to form vessel-tube structures. Collectively, LRRC4 expression inhibited the expression of some growth factors, cytokines and their receptors, and the capacity of glioma cells responding to cytokine stimulation, leading to inhibition of glioma cell proliferation. Conceivably, induction of LRRC4 expression may provide new intervention for human glioma in the clinic.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate in a rat glioma cell line (C6) the effect of VB biotechnologically produced by S. vulgaris plant cell cultures in the regulation of the inflammatory response. We used a model of central nervous system inflammation induced by bacterial endotoxin/cytokine (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/interferon (IFN)-gamma, 1 microg/ml and 100 U/ml, respectively). Our results show that the treatment with LPS/IFN-gamma for 24 h elicited the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity as determined by NO(x) accumulation in the culture medium. Preincubation with VB (10-100 microg/ml) abrogated the mixed cytokine-mediated induction of iNOS. The effect was concentration-dependent. Our studies also showed an inhibitory effect of VB on neuronal nitric oxide synthase expression. Moreover, Western blot analysis showed that this glycoside prevents specifically the activation of the proinflammatory enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in glioma cells without simultaneous inhibition of COX-1 enzyme. Moreover, we found that VB reduced the expression of proinflammatory enzymes in LPS/IFN-gamma through the inhibition of the activation of nuclear factor kappa B and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. The mechanisms underlying in vitro the neuroprotective properties of VB involve modulation of transcription factors and consequent altered gene expression, resulting in downregulation of inflammation. These findings provide support that VB may provide a promising approach for the treatment of oxidative-stress-related neurodegenerative diseases.",

After approximately five population doubling times with standard tissue culture conditions, 3H-Tdr-incorporation was determined by a liquid scintillation counting protocol. Data points were evaluated for mono- and combined treatment dose-effects. A model-free 3D-response surface was created and compared to the theoretical additive response surface. Local additivity was analysed for any desired ratio of combined treatment as well as for isoboles. No significant sub- or supraadditive effects were observed, indicating additive effects in all 3 tumors. No sequence dependence of effects could be demonstrated. In case radiotherapy and ifosfamide-chemotherapy are active treatment modalities and additive effects are found, we conclude that the combination of ifosfamide and radiotherapy might be attractive for the treatment of malignant brain tumors and should be further studied.",

Other manifestations, such as hydrocephalus, diancephalic syndrome, neurologic deficits, and growth and developmental delays, may be present as well. Surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy are used as treatment strategies. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical presentation of OPG patients and their final outcomes in response to treatment.;Thirty-seven patients with an initial diagnosis of OPG were studied as part of a single-center retrospective cohort for their clinical presentation, treatment, and response to treatment over a 10-year period.;The mean age of the patients was 37.1 months, and there was a nearly equal sex distribution. The most prevalent manifestation was visual impairment (94.4%), and other symptoms included nystagmus (50%), growth and developmental delays (27.8%), neurological deficits (19.4%), diencephalic syndrome (13.5%), proptosis (11.1%), and hydrocephalus (29.7%). Tumor staging revealed that 10.8% of the cases were stage A, 54.1% were stage B, and 35.1% were stage C. In 30 evaluable patients, the response to treatment included complete response (CR; 23.3%), partial response (PR; 43.3%), stable disease (23.3%), progressive disease (3.3%), and death due to disease (6.7%). A significant association was detected between tumor staging and the response to treatment, with higher rates of CR and PR in stage B and a higher mortality rate in stage C (p = 0.005).;OPG occur more commonly in the first decade of life, with visual disturbance as the most prevalent symptom.

This change is prevented by the presence of serum from different species (chicken, mouse, rat, horse, adult bovine, fetal bovine, and human) in the cell culture medium. In this communication the component in serum responsible for this effect is identified as lysophosphatidic acid for the following reasons: First, lysophosphatidic acid alone at concentrations which are present in serum reverts the morphological response. Second, both lysophosphatidic acid and the component in serum no longer revert the morphological response after treatment with phospholipase B (E.C.3.1.1.5). Third, lysophosphatidic acid and serum produce an analogous intracellular Cai2+ signal in rat glioma C6 cells as measured by fluorescence spectrophotometry with the Ca2+ ion indicator Fura 2. Fourth, both the morphological response and the Cai2+ increase are prevented by pretreatment of the cells with 100 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Finally, a maximal Cai2+ increase induced by FCS prevents the subsequent Cai2+ signal by lysophosphatidic acid. Interestingly, the morphological response is also reverted by Al3+ together with F- ions and also by lower n-alkanols such as ethanol and n-propanol suggesting that a regulatory GTP-binding protein is involved in the reversion. It is further shown that activation of the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate cleavage signal system is not responsible for the reversion of the morphological response.",

The oncolytic vector was a HSV recombinant virus in which both copies of the gamma 1 34.5 gene were replaced with the murine genes encoding the cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) or interleukin-10 (IL-10). The hypothesis predicted that if an immune response plays a role in survival following intratumoral treatment of tumor-bearing animals with HSV, expression of IL-4 should prolong survival whereas expression of IL-10 should reduce it. The results are that (1) these cytokines can be expressed by HSV in productively infected cells both in vitro and in vivo; (2) HSV-expressing IL-4 or IL-10 genes were able to infect and destroy glioma cells in vitro; (3) intracerebral inoculation of HSV expressing either IL-4 or IL-10 into syngeneic murine glioma GL-261 cells implanted in the brains of immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice produced dramatically opposite physiologic responses. The IL-4 HSV significantly prolonged survival of tumor bearers, whereas tumor-bearing mice that received the IL-10 HSV had a median survival that was identical to that of saline treated controls; (4) immunohistochemical analyses of mouse brains at 3 and 7 days after virus inoculation showed marked accumulation of inflammatory cells composed primarily of macrophages/microglia, with various proportions of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, but few B lymphocytes. We conclude that the cytokines expressed from genes encoded in the viral genome influence HSV therapy of tumors and this is probably due to the host immune response.

Mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), and tensor-decomposition DTI maps (p and q) were obtained. Histogram and fDM analyses were performed on co-registered baseline and post-chemotherapy maps. DTI changes were compared with modifications of tumour area and volume [according to Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria], and seizure response.;After three cycles of TMZ, 20/21 patients were stable according to RANO criteria, but DTI changes were observed in all patients (Wilcoxon test, P ≤ 0.03). After six cycles, DTI changes were more pronounced (P ≤ 0.005). Seventy-five percent of patients had early seizure response with significant improvement of DTI values, maintaining stability on FLAIR. Early changes of the 25th percentiles of p and MD predicted final volume change (R(2) = 0.614 and 0.561, P < 0.0005, respectively). TMZ-related changes were located mainly at tumour borders on p and MD fDMs.;DTI-based histogram and fDM analyses are useful techniques to evaluate the early effects of TMZ chemotherapy in LGG patients.;• DTI helps to assess the efficacy of chemotherapy in low-grade gliomas. • Histogram analysis of DTI metrics quantifies structural changes in tumour tissue. • Functional diffusion maps (fDMs) spatially localize the changes of DTI metrics. • Changes in DTI histograms and fDMs precede changes in conventional MRI. • Early changes in DTI histograms and fDMs correlate with seizure response.",

Few such data for pediatric glioma lines, particularly those from low-grade tumors, are currently available.;We used clonogenic assays of proliferative survival to quantitate cytoxicity of the chloroethylating agent 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) and the methylating agent temozolomide in 11 glioma and five medulloblastoma lines. Twelve lines are newly established and characterized here, nine of them from low-grade gliomas including pilocytic astrocytomas.;(a) MGMT is a major determinant of BCNU resistance and the predominant determinant of temozolomide resistance in both our glioma and medulloblastoma lines. On average, O(6)-benzylguanine reduced LD10 for BCNU and temozolomide, 2.6- and 26-fold, respectively, in 15 MGMT-expressing lines. (b) O6-Benzylguanine reduced DT (the threshold dose for killing) for BCNU and temozolomide, 3.3- and 138-fold, respectively.

When C6 cells were exposed to arsenite (50-100 microM for 1 h) or heat (42 degrees C for 30 min), expression of hsp27 and alpha B-crystallin was stimulated, with levels of the two proteins reaching a maximum after 10-16 h of culture. Induction of hsp27 was markedly enhanced when cells were exposed to arsenite in the presence of isoproterenol (20 microM) or epinephrine (20 microM) but not in the presence of phenylephrine. The stimulatory effects of isoproterenol and epinephrine were blocked completely by propranolol, an antagonist of beta-adrenergic receptors. Cholera toxin (2 micrograms/ml), forskolin (20 microM), and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (2.5 mM), all of which are known to increase intracellular levels of cyclic AMP, also stimulated the arsenite- or heat-induced accumulation of hsp27. Treatment of cells with each of these modulators alone did not result in the induction of hsp27. The level of hsp70 in C6 cells, as estimated by western blot analysis, was also enhanced by arsenite or heat stress. However, induction of hsp70 by stress was barely stimulated by isoproterenol. By contrast, induction of alpha B-crystallin by heat or arsenite stress was suppressed when isoproterenol, cholera toxin, forskolin, or dibutyryl cyclic AMP was present during the stress period. Northern blot analysis of the expression of mRNAs for hsp70, hsp27, and alpha B-crystallin showed that the modulation of the stress-induced accumulation of the three hsps by the various agents was regulated at the level of the corresponding mRNA. These results indicate that stress responses of hsp70, hsp27, and alpha B-crystallin in C6 rat glioma cells are regulated differently and, moreover, that when the level of cyclic AMP increases in cells, the response to stress of hsp27 is stimulated but that of alpha B-crystallin is suppressed.",

Since dysregulation of this pathway results in high, constitutive NFκB activation in various cancers and immune disorders, the development of specific drugs to target this pathway has become a focus for treating these diseases. NFκB regulates various aspects of the cellular response to interferon (IFN). However, the role of the upstream regulator of the NFκB signaling pathway, the inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK) complex, on IFN function has not been examined. In the present study, we examined the effects of 2 IKK inhibitors, N-(1,8-Dimethylimidazo[1,2-a]quinoxalin-4-yl)-1,2-ethanediamine hydrochloride (BMS-345541) and 2-[(aminocarbonyl)amino]-5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-thiophenecarboxamide (TPCA-1), on IFN action in several human glioma cell lines. IKK inhibitors inhibit glioma cell proliferation, as well as TNF-induced RelA (p65) nuclear translocation and NFκB-dependent IL8 gene expression. Importantly, BMS-345541 and TPCA-1 differentially inhibit IFN-induced gene expression, completely suppressing MX1 and GBP1 gene expression, while having only a minor effect on ISG15 expression. Furthermore, these IKK inhibitors displayed marked differences in blocking IFN-induced antiviral action against cytopathic effects and replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). Our results show that the IKK complex plays an important function in IFN-induced gene expression and antiviral activity. Since VSV and EMCV are oncolytic viruses used in cancer therapy, our results indicate the potential synergy in combining IKK inhibitors with oncolytic viruses.",

Transgenic rodent models have revealed a role for CREB in higher-order brain functions, such as memory and drug addiction behaviors. CREB overexpression in transgenic animals imparts oncogenic properties on cells in various tissues, and aberrant CREB expression is associated with tumours. It is the central position of CREB, downstream from key developmental and growth signalling pathways, which gives CREB this ability to influence a spectrum of cellular activities, such as cell survival, growth and differentiation, in both normal and cancer cells. We show that CREB is highly expressed and constitutively activated in patient glioma tissue and that this activation closely correlates with tumour grade. The mechanism by which CREB regulates glioblastoma (GBM) tumour cell proliferation involves activities downstream from both the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways that then modulate the expression of three key cell cycle factors, cyclin B, D and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Cyclin D1 is highly CREB-dependent, whereas cyclin B1 and PCNA are co-regulated by both CREB-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The precise regulatory network involved appears to differ depending on the tumour-suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog status of the GBM cells, which in turn allows CREB to regulate the activity of the PI3K itself. Given that CREB sits at the hub of key cancer cell signalling pathways, understanding the role of glioma-specific CREB function may lead to improved novel combinatorial anti-tumour therapies, which can complement existing PI3K-specific drugs undergoing early phase clinical trials.

The role of melatonin as an immunomodulator is, in some cases, contradictory. Although melatonin is reported to influence a variety of inflammatory and immune responses, evidence supporting its effects on important glioma cells-derived mediators is incomplete. We studied, in rat glioma cell line (C6), the role of melatonin (100 microm-1 mm) in the regulation of the expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) caused by incubation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/interferon (IFN)-gamma (1 microg/mL and 100 U/mL, respectively) and defined the mode of melatonin's action. Treatment with LPS/IFN-gamma for 24 hr elicited the induction of inducible (iNOS) activity as determined by nitrite and nitrate (NO(x)) accumulation in the culture medium. Preincubation with melatonin abrogated the mixed cytokines-mediated induction of iNOS. The effect of melatonin was concentration-dependent. Moreover, Western blot analysis showed that melatonin inhibited LPS/IFN-gamma-induced expression of COX-2 protein, but not that of constitutive cyclooxygenase. Inhibition of iNOS and COX-2 expression was associated with inhibition of activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB). The ability of melatonin to inhibit NF-kappaB activation was further confirmed by studies on the degradation of the inhibitor of NF-kappaB, IkappaB-alpha. Increased production of lipid peroxidation products using thiobarbituric acid assay were found in cellular contents from activated cultures. Lipid peroxidation was decreased by melatonin treatment in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, several genes having roles in heat-shock response were downregulated in melatonin-treated cells, such as 70 proteins, reflecting the reduced oxidative stress in these cells. The mechanisms underlying in vitro the neuroprotective properties of melatonin involve modulation of transcription factors and consequent altered gene expression, resulting in downregulation of inflammation.",

In primary malignant gliomas, the amplification/alteration of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been shown to play a significant role in enhancing glioma burden. In an effort to dissect the role of EGFR expression in glioma progression in vivo and evaluate targeted therapies for gliomas, we have genetically engineered glioma cells to visualize the dynamics of EGFR and targeted therapies in real time in vivo. Using engineered lentiviral vectors bearing fusions between EGFR and its exon 2 to 7 deleted variant (EGFRvIII) with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and Renilla luciferase (Rluc), we show that there is a direct correlation between EGFR expression and glioma cell proliferation in the initial stages of glioma progression. To monitor and evaluate EGFR-targeted therapies, we have engineered (a) short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) and (b) clinically used monoclonal antibody, cetuximab. Using EGFR-GFP-Rluc/firefly luciferase (Fluc)-DsRed2 glioma model, we show that both shRNAs and cetuximab result in a considerable reduction in glioma cell proliferation in culture and glioma burden in vivo that can be monitored in real time at a cellular resolution.

        "Doc_abstract":"Chaperone-rich cell lysates (CRCLs) may play an important role in the development of anti-tumor vaccines. Tumor-derived CRCLs have been reported to activate dendritic cells (DCs) to elicit potent anti-tumor activity. However, the role of DC-derived exosomes (DEXs) secreted from DCs loaded with CRCLs in the treatment of tumors has not been clearly determined. In the present study, DEXs were generated from DCs loaded with CRCLs derived from GL261 glioma cells. These DEXs, designated DEX (CRCL-GL261), were then used to treat DCs to create DEX (CRCL-GL261)-DCs. The DEX (CRCL-GL261)-DCs were found to promote cell proliferation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in vitro compared with DEX (GL261)-DCs, which were loaded with DEXs derived from DCs loaded with GL261 tumor cell lysates. DEX (CRCL-GL261)-DCs significantly prolonged the survival of mice with tumors and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. In addition, DEX (CRCL-GL261)-DCs induced enhanced T cell infiltration in intracranial glioma tissues compared with other treatments. DEX (CRCL-GL261)-DCs induced strong production of anti-tumor cytokines, including interleukin-2 and interferon-γ. Moreover, depletion of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells significantly impaired the anti-tumor effect of DEX (CRCL-GL261)-DCs. Finally, DEX (CRCL-GL261)-DCs were found to negatively regulate Casitas B cell lineage lymphoma (Cbl)-b and c-Cbl signaling, leading to the activation of phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling in T cells. In summary, we present evidence that DEX (CRCL-GL261)-DCs induce more potent and effective anti-tumor T cell immune responses and delineate the underlying mechanism by which DEX (CRCL-GL261)-DCs exerted their anti-tumor activity through modulating Cbl-b and c-Cbl signaling. These results provide novel and promising insight for the development of an anti-tumor vaccine.",

Patients have an extremely favorable prognosis after surgical resection, qualifying tumors for a grade I designation by the World Health Organization. The molecular data on PA support a key role for the BRAF oncogene in the pathogenesis of these tumors, with the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion being the most common alteration identified in sporadic cases, particularly those occurring in the posterior fossa. Constitutive activation of BRAF leads to downstream activation of the MEK/MAPK/ERK/p16 pathway, which interestingly is also used by cells to activate oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). In fact, the presence of an active OIS pathway might explain the periods of dormancy or spontaneous regression or both, that can be seen in PA. In addition to reviewing the historical evolution, clinicopathologic, predictive, prognostic, and molecular features of PA, we discuss current therapeutic strategies and the caveats that should be considered for the development of therapies that could be used to more effectively treat challenging cases. Individualized treatment requires identification of the type of MAPK alteration, as several alterations in BRAF have been described in addition to the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion. Combination regimens would also appear crucial to achieve tumor eradication and prevent the development of drug resistance. Balancing mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway inhibition with abrogation of an active OIS should be carefully considered as well to preserve any existing protective pathways. Importantly, PAs are largely indolent tumors, and care should be taken to avoid overtreatment, as aggressive therapy could cause more harm than good. ",

In this paper, we present the case of a 17-year-old girl affected by combined aspergillosis and mucormycosis, following treatment of a recurrent glioma. The patient was hospitalized for a suspected cellulitis of the right hemi-face, involving frontal maxillary area and the upper airways and was immediately put on intravenous antibiotic therapies; after performing nasal septum and maxillary biopsies, concomitant mucormycosis and aspergillosis were diagnosed and antimycotic therapy with liposomal B-amphotericin was administered. After evaluation by the oral surgeon and otolaryngologist, surgical cranio-facial necrosectomy was suggested, but refused by the parents of the patient. The girl died only few days later, due to a respiratory arrest. Awareness of this pathology with prompt diagnosis and early treatment may improve the outcome of these infections and reduce the mortality. ",

Cells were treated with the compounds each day and cell proliferation was monitored for up to 5 days of exposure. AEA time- and concentration-dependently inhibited C6 cell proliferation. After 4 days of treatment, AEA and 2-AG inhibited C6 cell proliferation with similar potencies (IC(50) values of 1.6 and 1.8 microM, respectively), whereas palmitoylethanolamide showed no significant antiproliferative effects at concentrations up to 10 microM. The antiproliferative effects of both AEA and 2-AG were blocked completely by a combination of antagonists at cannabinoid receptors (SR141716A and SR144528 or AM251 and AM630) and vanilloid receptors (capsazepine) as well as by alpha-tocopherol (0.1 and 10 microM), and reduced by calpeptin (10 microM) and fumonisin B(1) (10 microM), but not by L-cycloserine (1 and 100 microM).

It is concluded that the antiproliferative effects of the endocannabinoids upon C6 cells are brought about by a mechanism involving combined activation of both vanilloid receptors and to a lesser extent cannabinoid receptors, and leading to oxidative stress and calpain activation.

Its most malignant form, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is almost invariably fatal, due in part to the intrinsic resistance of GBM to radiation- and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. We analyzed B-cell leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) anti-apoptotic proteins in GBM and found myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) to be the highest expressed in the majority of malignant gliomas. Mcl-1 was functionally important, as neutralization of Mcl-1 induced apoptosis and increased chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. To determine how Mcl-1 was regulated in glioma, we analyzed the promoter and identified a novel functional single nucleotide polymorphism in an uncharacterized E26 transformation-specific (ETS) binding site. We identified the ETS transcription factor ELK4 as a critical regulator of Mcl-1 in glioma, since ELK4 downregulation was shown to reduce Mcl-1 and increase sensitivity to apoptosis. Importantly the presence of the single nucleotide polymorphism, which ablated ELK4 binding in gliomas, was associated with lower Mcl-1 levels and a greater dependence on Bcl-xL. Furthermore, in vivo, ELK4 downregulation reduced tumor formation in glioblastoma xenograft models. The critical role of ELK4 in Mcl-1 expression and protection from apoptosis in glioma defines ELK4 as a novel potential therapeutic target for GBM.",

We investigated whether the widely used chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide (TMZ) can sensitize glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) from human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. GSCs were isolated from GBM, and stem cell properties were confirmed by immunocytochemistry and in vivo tumorigenicity. Primary GSCs (PGCs) were produced by serum treatment of GBM-derived cells. Changes in expression levels of various TRAIL-related signaling factors before and after TRAIL or TRAIL + TMZ treatment were measured by Western blotting. Overexpression vectors and siRNAs were used to investigate mechanism of TRAIL sensitivity. GSCs showed greater resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis than PGCs and had lower basal caspase activity. Caspase knockdown in PGCs reduced TRAIL sensitivity. Expression levels of c-Fas-associated death domain-like interleukin 1-converting enzyme-like inhibitory protein long and short isoforms (c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS) were significantly higher in GSCs than PGCs, and siRNA-mediated c-FLIP knockdown in GSCs enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis. TMZ enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis in GSCs and downregulated c-FLIP expression. Add of TMZ also upregulated the expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase casitas B-lineage lymphoma (c-Cbl). Moreover, overexpression of c-Cbl alone reduced c-FLIP expression, and c-Cbl knockdown both enhanced c-FLIP expression and reduced the potentiating effect of TMZ on TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The result indicated that TMZ may overcome TRAIL resistance in GSCs by suppressing c-FLIP expression through c-Cbl-mediated ubiquitination and degradation.",

These patients on single-drug chemotherapy allowed us to evaluate the effects of each agent on sister chromatid exchange (SCE) induction in vivo.

Blood (5-10 ml) was drawn by venipuncture before treatment, within 10 h after treatment, and for two BCNU-treated patients at various other times. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were cultured by standard techniques for analysis of SCE. Eight weeks after irradiation but before chemotherapy, the mean SCE frequency in the patients' peripheral blood lymphocytes was 9.6 SCEs/metaphase. Following treatment with AZQ or BCNU, the baseline SCE frequency was increased more than 2-fold or 3-fold, respectively. Two months after BCNU treatment, there was less than a 25% reduction in SCE levels compared to samples taken and cultured within 10 h after treatment. These data show that lesions leading to SCE in human peripheral blood lymphocytes are relatively longlived, and that on a mg/m2 basis, AZQ is a more potent inducer of SCE in vivo than is BCNU.",

We have established a stable CD4(+) Th cell clone (Th35-1A) from the PBMCs of a patient with primary cutaneous melanoma. The Th cell clone is noncytolytic and proliferates specifically in the presence of irradiated autologous melanoma cells or autologous EBV-transformed B cells pulsed with melanoma tumor cell lysates. Th35-1A produces IFN-gamma (a Th1-type cytokine) after autologous tumor cell stimulation, and its proliferative reactivity is HLA class II-restricted. Th cells showed helper activity for PWM responses of PBMCs. Using a panel of HLA class II-matched and unmatched EBV-B cells as APCs and allogeneic melanoma tumor cell lysate as stimulant, DR7 was delineated as the HLA class II restriction element used by the Th cell clone. In agreement with these results, transfection of an allogeneic melanoma cell line with HLA-DR7 isolated from autologous EBV-B cells rendered the cell line stimulatory for Th35-1A cells. Specificity studies using autologous EBV-B cells (EBV-B35) pulsed with a panel of allogeneic tumor cell lysates of various tissue origins indicated that the Th cell clone recognizes an antigen shared by melanoma and glioma cells. The availability of the Th cell clone may lead to the development of new therapies against melanoma, using adoptive Th cell transfer and/or active immunization with a shared Th cell antigen.",

HCAR is heterogeneously expressed in various tissues and types of human cancer cells, which has implications for the use of adenoviruses as vectors in cancer gene therapy. Using immunoblotting, real-time PCR, FACS-analysis and sensitivity to infection with adenovirus-lacZ, we analyzed the expression level of hCAR in glioma Grade IV cell lines. With real-time PCR, we also analyzed hCAR expression in primary human astrocytomas of different malignancy grades, as well as in their xenograft derivatives. Analysis of a set of 10 cell lines showed great variation in hCAR expression. Susceptibility to Ad5lacZ correlated well with hCAR expression, whereas no correlation was observed with the expression of alphavbeta3/alphavbeta5 integrins, proposed to function as co-receptors for adenoviruses. A great variation of CAR expression was also observed in primary astrocytomas of different malignancy grades. The mean value of CAR expression was significantly lower in 22 Grade IV tumors as compared to the values for 6 Grade II (p = 0.01) and 6 Grade III (p = 0.01) tumors. When the hCAR expression in 11 xenografts derived from Grade IV gliomas were compared to the levels detected in the original parental tumors, a mean 12-fold higher expression was seen in the xenografts (P = 0.01). Two xenografts with low hCAR expression grew considerably faster than the hCAR-expressing cells. Our results have relevance for the use of adenoviruses in gene therapy against astrocytomas.",

The objectives of this study were to explore YKL-40 protein expression status and World Health Organization (WHO) pathologic grades of primary human astrocytoma and to investigate the role of YKL-40 in the proliferation of both established and primary astrocytoma cells in vitro.;WHO grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 primary astrocytomas (210 patients) were evaluated for YKL-40 protein expression status in immunohistochemical analyses. In addition, after transfection with a plasmid that contained YKL-40 small-interfering RNA (siRNA), cell proliferation and the cell cycle were measured with a cell-viability assay and flow cytometry. Expression levels of phosphorylated, total mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase B (AKT) were detected by Western blot analysis.;The percentage of positive cells and the staining intensity differed significantly between different pathologic tumor grades (P < .001). The YKL-40 immunoreactivity score increased markedly with increased pathologic grade (F = 18.89; P < .001). In the in vitro experiment, the cell cycle was arrested in G(1) phase. An inhibitor of the p38 MAPK, SB203580, could partially abrogate the cell proliferation inhibition effect by siRNA treatment. The expression levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and phosphorylated AKT were notably decreased in siRNA-transfected U87 cells. In contrast, the expression levels of phosphorylated p38 and phosphorylated c-jun N-terminal kinase 1 and 2 increased significantly (P < .01).;YKL-40 expression status correlated well with the pathologic grade of primary astrocytomas. The current results also indicted that YKL-40 plays a pivotal role in glioma cell proliferation through activation of the MAPK and AKT pathways.

Using the glioblastoma cell line 86HG39, we demonstrated that treatment of the glioma cells with OSM also leads to a differentiation of the malignant glioma cells as judged by a strong increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein expression. The differentiation and the growth inhibition were not significantly blocked by expression of a dominant-negative (dn) signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) 3 protein. OSM exerted a reduction in DNA synthesis even in the presence of a high expression level of dnStat3.

We investigated the influence of hypoxia, nutrient deprivation and current standard therapies on B10 cytotoxicity. The human glioma cell lines LN-308 and LNT-229 were exposed to B10 alone or together with irradiation, temozolomide, nutrient deprivation or hypoxia. Cell growth and viability were evaluated by crystal violet staining, clonogenicity assays, propidium iodide uptake and LDH release assays. Cell death was examined using an inhibitor of lysosomal acidification (bafilomycin A1), a cathepsin inhibitor (CA074-Me) and a short-hairpin RNA targeting cathepsin B. Hypoxia substantially enhanced B10-induced cell death. This effect was sensitive to bafilomycin A1 and thus dependent on hypoxia-induced lysosomal acidification. Cathepsin B appeared to mediate cell death because either the inhibitor CA074-Me or cathepsin B gene silencing rescued glioma cells from B10 toxicity under hypoxia. B10 is a novel antitumor agent with substantially enhanced cytotoxicity under hypoxia conferred by increased lysosomal cell death pathway activation. Given the importance of hypoxia for therapy resistance, malignant progression, and as a result of antiangiogenic therapies, B10 might be a promising strategy for hypoxic tumors like malignant glioma.

Imatinib treatment (orally once daily) was initiated 4 days after s.c. injection of rat C6 glioma cells into athymic nude mice and patupilone administration (i.v. once per week) was started 3 or 4 days after imatinib treatment.;As a single agent, imatinib was inactive in the regimens selected (100 mg/kg: T/C 86% and 116%; 200 mg/kg: T/C 68% and 84%; two independent experiments), but well tolerated (gain in body weight and no mortalities). Patupilone weekly monotherapy demonstrated dose-dependent antitumour effects (1 mg/kg: T/C 67% and 70%; 2 mg/kg: T/C 32% and 63%; 4 mg/kg: T/C 3% and 46%). As expected, dose-dependent body weight losses occurred (final body weight changes at 1 mg/kg were -7% and -3%; at 2 mg/kg were -23% and -13%; and at 4 mg/kg were -33% and -15%). Combining 2 mg/kg patupilone and 200 mg/kg per day imatinib in one experiment produced a non-statistically significant trend for an improved antitumour effect over patupilone alone (combination, T/C 9%), while in the second experiment, enhancement was seen with the combination and reached statistical significance versus patupilone alone (combination, T/C 22%; P=0.008). Reduction of the imatinib dose to 100 mg/kg per day resulted in no enhancement of antitumour activity in combination with 2 mg/kg patupilone. Reduction of the patupilone dose to 1 mg/kg resulted in a reduced antitumour effect, and only a trend for synergy with either imatinib dose (combination, T/C 46% and 40%). Pooling the data from the two experiments confirmed a significant synergy for the combination of 2 mg/kg patupilone and 200 mg/kg per day imatinib (P=0.032), and a trend for synergy at the 1 mg/kg patupilone dose. Reduction in the imatinib dose to 100 mg/kg per day resulted only in additivity with either dose of patupilone. Body weight losses were dominated by the effect of patupilone, since no greater body weight loss was observed in the combination groups.;Combining patupilone with high-dose imatinib produced an increased antitumour effect without affecting the tolerability of treatment in a relatively chemoresistant rat C6 glioma model.

The contents of GM3 with different cell densities were consistent, being more than 0.4 micromol/g of the cellular weight, which was high enough to be recognized by the antibody. Trypsin treatment of the cells did not increase antibody reactivity. The extracted GM3 retained its antigenicity, being intensely stained with M2590 on a TLC plate; there was no change in chromatographic mobility either, indicating no modification of its chemical structure. The fluorescent microscope disclosed scattered dot-like staining of GM3, particularly at the periphery of the cells. We were able to expose cryptic GM3 fully within 12 h by dispersion of the cells to a sparse density. Surface labeling of GM3 with the use of limited sodium periodate oxidation of sialylated residue equally labeled GM3 either from the confluent cells or the sparse cells. Disassembly of actin filaments with cytochalasin B (10 microM) partially exposed cryptic GM3 of confluent cells, indicating reversibility of the crypticity.

Treatment of C6 glioma cells with Toxin B and exoenzyme C3 resulted in cell death suggesting the role of geranylgeranylated protein(s) in the survival of glioma cells. Relative apoptotic death observed in cells transfected with dominant negative constructs of RhoA, Rac, and cdc42 imply Rho A as playing the major role in cell survival. Furthermore, the inhibition of Rho A kinase (ROCK), a direct downstream effector of Rho A, by Y-27632 or dominant negative of ROCK, induced apoptosis in glioma cells. These findings indicate that RhoA/ROCK pathway is involved negatively in the regulation of glioma cell death pathway. Moreover, in vivo studies of lovastatin treatment in animals implanted with C6 glioma cell tumors also resulted in smaller tumor size and induced apoptosis in the tumor tissue. The implantation of stably transfected C6 glioma cells with expression vector of C3 exoenzyme, dominant negative of RhoA and ROCK, resulted in significant smaller tumor mass, further establishing the importance of geranylgeranylated proteins, specifically RhoA and its downstream effecter ROCK, in cell survival and tumor genesis.",

NG2 has been shown to function as a co-receptor for PDGF ligands whose aberrant expression is common in gliomas. We have recently generated a glioma model based on the overexpression of PDGF-B in neural progenitors and here we investigated the possible relevance of NG2 during PDGF-driven gliomagenesis.;The survival curves of NG2-KO mice overexpressing PDGF-B were compared to controls by using a Log-rank test. The characteristics of tumors induced in NG2-KO were compared to those of tumors induced in wild type mice by immunostaining for different cell lineage markers and by transplantation assays in adult mice.;We showed that the lack of NG2 does not appreciably affect any of the characterized steps of PDGF-driven brain tumorigenesis, such as oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC) induction, the recruitment of bystander OPCs and the progression to full malignancy, which take place as in wild type animals.;Our analysis, using both NG2-KO mice and a miRNA based silencing approach, clearly demonstrates that NG2 is not required for PDGF-B to efficiently induce and maintain gliomas from neural progenitors. On the basis of the data obtained, we therefore suggest that the role of NG2 as a target molecule for glioma treatment should be carefully reconsidered.",

This migratory behaviour depends partially on lysosomal cysteine cathepsins. Reportedly, the expression of cathepsins B, L and S gradually increases in the progression from benign astrocytoma to the malignant glioblastoma, although their specific roles in glioma progression have not been revealed. The aim of this study was to clarify their specific contribution to glioblastoma cell invasion. The differences between the matrix invading cells and non-invading core cells from spheroids derived from glioblastoma cell culture and from glioblastoma patients' biopsies, and embedded in type I collagen, have been studied at the mRNA, protein and cathepsin activity levels. Analyses of the two types of cells showed that the three cathepsins were up-regulated post-translationally, their specific activities increasing in the invading cells. The cystatin levels were also differentially altered, resulting in higher ratio of cathepsins B and L to stefin B in the invading cells. However, using specific synthetic inhibitors and silencing strategies revealed that only cathepsin B activity was involved in the invasion of glioblastoma cells, confirming previous notion of cathepsin B as tumour invasiveness biomarker. Our data support the concept of specific roles of cysteine cathepsins in cancer progression. Finally the study points out on the complexity of protease regulation and the need to include functional proteomics in the systems biology approaches to understand the processes associated with glioma invasion and progression.",

In the current study, we show an inverse correlation between PDPN expression and PTEN levels in primary human GB and glioma cell lines, and we report elevated PDPN protein levels in the subventricular zone of brain tissue sections of PTEN-deficient mice. In human glioma cells lacking functional PTEN, reintroduction of wild-type PTEN, inhibition of the PTEN downstream target protein kinase B/AKT, or interference with transcription factor AP-1 function resulted in efficient downregulation of PDPN expression. In addition, we observed hypoxia-dependent PDPN transcriptional control and demonstrated that PDPN expression is subject to negative transcriptional regulation by promoter methylation in human GB and in glioma cell lines. Treatment of PTEN-negative glioma cells with demethylating agents induced expression of PDPN. Together, our findings show that increased PDPN expression in human GB is caused by loss of PTEN function and activation of the PI3K-AKT-AP-1 signaling pathway, accompanied by epigenetic regulation of PDPN promoter activity. Silencing of PDPN expression leads to reduced proliferation and migration of glioma cells, suggesting a functional role of PDPN in glioma progression and malignancy. Thus, specific targeting of PDPN expression and/or function could be a promising strategy for the treatment of patients with primary GB.",

Deregulated signaling through this pathway contributes to development of gliomas and their resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. Targeting the PI3K signaling pathway has thus emerged as a promising approach to successful treatment of gliomas. We assessed the radiosensitizing potential of four small-molecule inhibitors that differ in their activities against specific isoforms of the PI3K 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110). p110alpha inhibitors blocked phosphorylation of both protein kinase B/Akt and S6 in all cell lines examined, effectively decreased cellular proliferation, and produced additive cytotoxic effects in combination with radiation therapy. The p110beta inhibitor exhibited limited biochemical effects and failed to decrease cellular proliferation or viability as either a single agent or in combination with radiation or rapamycin. In vivo studies examining the effects of the p110alpha inhibitor in combination with radiation indicated a significant reduction in tumor growth rate induced by the combined treatment compared with each treatment modality alone. This translated into a trend toward prolonged time-to-failure for mice in the combination treatment group.

A novel gene KIAA0495/p53-dependent apoptosis modulator (PDAM) was found frequently deregulated, with 37 of 58 (63.8%) OTs examined showing reduced expression compared with normal brain. Chromosome 1p loss and epigenetic modifications were the major mechanisms contributing to PDAM downregulation. The role of PDAM in chemosensitivity was also evaluated. PDAM knockdown had no effect on sensitivity to vincristine, lomustine, temozolomide and paclitaxel, but could induce cisplatin resistance in glioma cells harboring wild-type p53. B-cell CCL/lymphoma 2 (BCL2)-like 1 (BCL2L1) exhibited significant upregulation, while BCL2 showed partial derepression in PDAM-silenced cells after cisplatin treatment, suggesting that alteration of anti-apoptotic genes contributed in part to cisplatin resistance. Knockdown of BCL2L1 abrogated the induced cisplatin-resistant phenotype. Moreover, our data suggested that PDAM might function as a non-protein-coding RNA.

BSH after intra-arterial infusion (i.a.) was found to move into the peripheral organs more easily than after intra-venous (i.v.) infusion. In patients with malignant glioma, the average values of boron concentration in tumor and the tumor to blood ratio (T/B ratio) after i.a. infusion were 26.8 +/- 19.5 micrograms/g (range, 6.1-104.7 micrograms/g) and 1.77 +/- 1.30 (range, 0.47-6.65) respectively.

On disease progression a three fractions per day radiotherapy regimen (3 FRT) in split-course (two series of 22.50 Gy in 15 fractions and five days separated by a two weeks period of rest) was then delivered to the patients. All patients had a measurable mass on the CT scan. 19 were entered into the study: 13 as first line therapy (group A) and six for salvage treatment (group B). Tolerance was globally good. Eight patients were considered responders at the end of five cycles of Cis PII-RT. They were all group A patients. Median symptom-free interval was six months for the whole population. Survival was twelve months. The 3 FRT was well tolerated but does not seem to have improved the therapeutic gain of the chemoradiotherapy combination. The present study concerns patients whose prognosis was poor on inclusion: surgery inadvisable or unsatisfactory and diagnosis mainly based on biopsy only. The number and the duration of responses justify further study into Cis PII as first line therapy as either an effective cytotoxic drug or a potential radio enhancer.",

Patients were stratified as newly diagnosed and untreated (stratum A), newly diagnosed after external beam radiotherapy (XRT) (stratum B), and recurrent (stratum C). (131)I-ch81C6 was administered either before (stratum A) or after (stratum B) conventional XRT for newly diagnosed patients. In addition, chemotherapy was prescribed for all patients after (131)I-ch81C6 administration. Dose escalation was performed independently for each stratum. Patients were observed for toxicity and response until death or progressive disease.;We treated 47 patients with (131)I-ch81C6 doses up to 4.44 GBq (120 mCi), including 35 with newly diagnosed tumors (strata A and B) and 12 with recurrent disease (stratum C). Dose-limiting hematologic toxicity defined the MTD to be 2.96 GBq (80 mCi) for all patients, regardless of treatment strata. Neurologic dose-limiting toxicity developed in 3 patients; however, none required further surgery to debulk radiation necrosis. Median survival was 88.6 wk and 65.0 wk for newly diagnosed and recurrent patients, respectively.;The MTD of (131)I-ch81C6 is 2.96 GBq (80 mCi) because of dose-limiting hematologic toxicity. Although encouraging survival was observed, (131)I-ch81C6 was associated with greater hematologic toxicity, probably due to the enhanced stability of the IgG2 construct, than previously observed with (131)I-murine 81C6.",

In C6 glioma cells, short term (10 min) treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) results in a dose-dependent translocation of PKC alpha, PKC delta and PKC theta. Long term (24 hr) treatment with appropriate doses of TPA results in the complete down-regulation of PKC delta but not of PKC alpha PKC theta. This property was used to determine which isoform might be involved in the activation of the glial cell Na(+)-H+ exchanger. It was found that (a) TPA has dose-dependent effects on PKC alpha, PKC delta, and PKC theta translocation and on Na(+)-dependent, EIPA-sensitive Na(+)-H+ exchanger stimulation; (b) the antiporter is blocked both by staurosporine and in cells in which PKC alpha, PKC delta, and PKC theta have been completely down-regulated; (c) the inactive form (alpha-TPA) of TPA, which does not include translocation of the three isoforms (alpha, delta, and theta) has no effect on the antiporter; (d) Western blot analysis demonstrated dose-dependent TPA (10, 30, 100, and 1000 nM)-induced translocation of PKC alpha, PKC delta, and PKC theta. TPA (10, 30, 100, and 1000 nM)-induced Na(+)-H+ exchanger activation was also found to be dose dependent. There was no difference in TPA-induced Na(+)-H+ exchanger activation between 30 and 100 nM; it correlated with the extent of TPA-induced PKC delta translocation over the same concentration range, suggesting that isoform responsible for the exchanger activation is PKC delta; (e) When 1 microM TPA is added after prior treatment of the cells with 10 nM TPA, an additive effect on Na(+)-H+ exchanger is seen that is not observed when the initial stimulus in 30 nM TPA, as would be expected if the PKC delta isoform were responsible for exchanger activation; (f) Finally, when PKC delta, but not PKC alpha and PKC theta, is completely down-regulated by 24-hr pretreatment with 10, 30, or 100 nM TPA, the Na(+)-H+ exchanger can no longer be stimulated by 1 microM TPA; when 1 nM TPA pretreatment is used, no down-regulation occurs and the exchanger still responds to 1 microM TPA. We have shown that the Na(+)-H+ exchanger in C6 glioma cells can be stimulated by TPA-induced PKC activation and, for the first time, that PKC delta is involved in the activation of this antiporter. Our results also suggest that different members of the PKC family within a single cell elicit specific physiological responses.",

No signs of apoptotic cell death were found using in situ end labelling with biotin-labelled nucleotides or with DNA integrity analysis in agarose gel electrophoresis. An immunohistochemical method for analysis of cisplatin-DNA adducts was used to elucidate the distribution of cisplatin in brain tumour, normal brain and kidney. Addition of AmB to cisplatin caused increased adduct formation in kidneys, particularly in tubular cells. It seems plausible that the nephrotoxicity, at least in part, was mediated by increased levels of cisplatin-DNA adducts. Pretreatment with AmB did not have any obvious effect on the formation of adducts in the cerebral cortex. The adduct levels in the tumours from animals pretreated with AmB were not significantly increased compared with those treated with cisplatin only. Thus, addition of AmB to cisplatin caused excessive nephrotoxicity suggesting a decrease in the therapeutic ratio of cisplatin.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) correspond to a tumor cell subpopulation, involved in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumor initiation and acquired chemoresistance. Currently, drug-induced differentiation is considered as a promising approach to eradicate this tumor-driving cell population. Recently, the effect of cannabinoids (CBs) in promoting glial differentiation and inhibiting gliomagenesis has been evidenced. Herein, we demonstrated that cannabidiol (CBD) by activating transient receptor potential vanilloid-2 (TRPV2) triggers GSCs differentiation activating the autophagic process and inhibits GSCs proliferation and clonogenic capability. Above all, CBD and carmustine (BCNU) in combination overcome the high resistance of GSCs to BCNU treatment, by inducing apoptotic cell death. Acute myeloid leukemia (Aml-1) transcription factors play a pivotal role in GBM proliferation and differentiation and it is known that Aml-1 control the expression of several nociceptive receptors. So, we evaluated the expression levels of Aml-1 spliced variants (Aml-1a, b and c) in GSCs and during their differentiation. We found that Aml-1a is upregulated during GSCs differentiation, and its downregulation restores a stem cell phenotype in differentiated GSCs. Since it was demonstrated that CBD induces also TRPV2 expression and that TRPV2 is involved in GSCs differentiation, we evaluated if Aml-1a interacted directly with TRPV2 promoters. Herein, we found that Aml-1a binds TRPV2 promoters and that Aml-1a expression is upregulated by CBD treatment, in a TRPV2 and PI3K/AKT dependent manner. Altogether, these results support a novel mechanism by which CBD inducing TRPV2-dependent autophagic process stimulates Aml-1a-dependent GSCs differentiation, abrogating the BCNU chemoresistance in GSCs.

        "Doc_abstract":"We have reported previously that s.c. immunization of rats with IL-4 transduced 9L gliosarcoma cells (9L-IL-4) induced a potent antitumor immunity against intracranial, parental 9L tumors. Subcutaneous implantation of 9L-IL-4 influenced the systemic humoral response, which was demonstrated by Th2-type isotype-switching and the induction of cellular immune responses, which played a critical role in the rejection of tumors. Serological analyses of recombinant cDNA expression libraries (SEREX), has recently emerged as a powerful method for serological identification of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) and/or tumor rejection antigens (TRAs). Because IL-4 is known to activate B cells and to promote humoral responses, and inasmuch as induction of humoral responses by central nervous system tumors has been reported to be minimal, we investigated whether the induction of a potent humoral immune response against 9L TAAs or TRAs in rats immunized s.c. with 9L-IL4 could be demonstrated. Screening of 5 x 10(5) independent clones of 9L-expression cDNA library for the presence of reactive antibodies in the serum from a 91-IL-4 immunized rat led to the identification of three different TAAs. One 9L TAA (clone 29) was demonstrated to be calcyclin, a member of the S-100 family of calcium-binding proteins. The second 9L TAA (clone 37) was demonstrated to be the rat homologue of the J6B7 mouse immunomodulatory molecule. The third TAA (clones 158 and 171) was determined to be the rat homologue of the mouse Id-associated protein 1 (MIDA1), a DNA-binding, protein-associated protein. Northern blotting demonstrated that message for calcyclin was overexpressed in 9L cells. Message encoding MIDA1 was highly expressed in parental 9L cells and thymus and, to a lesser degree, in testis, suggesting that MIDA1 was comparable with the cancer/testis category of TAAs. Sera obtained from animals bearing 9L-IL-4 were found to have a higher a frequency and titer of antibodies to these antigens when compared with sera obtained from rats bearing sham-transduced 9L (9L-neo) cells. To determine whether immunization with these TAAs induced antitumor immunity, animals were immunized by intradermal injection with expression plasmids encoding calcyclin or MIDA1. Subsequent challenge of rats with parental 9L resulted in significant suppression of tumor growth in animals immunized with MIDA1, but not with calcyclin. These results indicate that MIDA1 is an effective 9L TRA and will be useful for the investigation of specific antitumor immunity in this glioma model. Furthermore, these results suggest that this approach, termed \"cytokine-assisted SEREX (CAS),\" may serve as an effective strategy for identification of TRAs for in animal-glioma models of cytokine gene therapy, and potentially in humans undergoing cytokine gene therapy protocols as well.",

As determined by a radioligand binding assay, there were 1.2 x 10(5) EGFRvIII sites per cell compared with an undetectable number on F98WT cells. The tumorigenicity of the F98(npEGFRvIII) glioma was studied following i.c. implantation of 10(3), 10(4), or 10(5) cells into CD-Fischer rats. Mean survival times were 23, 17, and 13 days, respectively, which were equivalent to those obtained with F98EGFR and F98WT cells. As determined by magnetic resonance imaging, the mean doubling times for the F98WT and F98(npEGFRvIII) gliomas were similar (59.8 +/- 4.8 versus 52 +/- 3.3 hours).

For experimental cancer it has been shown that MitA mediates the expression of genes involved in tumor progression such as genes involved in immunosurveillance, cell motility or cell death. MitA works synergistically with Apo2L/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), and with antiangiogenic agents. We were therefore interested in analyzing whether MitA might be a suitable agent for glioma therapy. We demonstrate herein that the cell death sensitizing effects of MitA are cell line specific, independent of the endogenous status of the tumor suppressor p53 as well as of the endogenous expression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) or basal sensitivity towards death ligand-induced cell death. In glioma cells, MitA reduced the secretion and activity of the migration-involved matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), diminished vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and increased recepteur d'origine nantais (RON) kinase messenger RNA (mRNA), paralleled by a significant reduction of glioma cell migration. In contrast to other cancer types, in glioma cells MitA did not alter the expression of the immunorelevant genes major histocompatibility complex I class related (MIC)-A, MIC-B or UL16 binding proteins (ULBP). We conclude that, whereas MitA-mediated reduction of XIAP expression and sensitization to Apo2L/TRAIL are cell line specific, its antimigratory effects are more general and might be the result of altered expression of MMP, VEGF, and/or RON kinase. Therefore, MitA might be a potential agent to reduce glioma cell migration.",

However, the clinical application of 5-ALA for surgery in primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is uncommon. Here, we present a case of PCNSL treated using 5-ALA-induced fluorescence-guided resective surgery. A 70-year-old woman presented with cerebellar ataxia, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed an irregularly shaped and homogenously enhanced mass with surrounding brain edema in the vermis that extended to the right hemisphere of the cerebellum. Under the preoperative diagnosis of a malignant glioma in the cerebellum, the patient underwent 5-ALA-induced fluorescence-guided surgery. Under blue light illumination, the tumor revealed strong 5-ALA-induced fluorescence. The tumor was identified as a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. After partial resection, the patient received adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Importantly, the neurological deficit of the patient improved, and recurrence of the tumor was not observed 21 months post-surgery. Together with previous reports, this case study emphasizes the efficacy of the surgical application of 5-ALA for PCNSL. ",

Matrix metalloproteases (MMP)-9 and cathepsin B have been shown to participate in the processes of tumor growth, vascularization and invasion of gliomas. In the present study, we used a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven DNA template approach to induce hairpin RNA (hpRNA)-triggered RNA interference (RNAi) to block MMP-9 and cathepsin B gene expression with a single construct. Transfection of a plasmid vector-expressing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) for MMP-9 and cathepsin B significantly inhibited MMP-9 and cathepsin B expression and reduced the invasive behavior of SNB19, glioblastoma cell line in Matrigel and spheroid invasion models. Downregulation of MMP-9 and cathepsin B using RNAi in SNB19 cells reduced cell-cell interaction of human microvascular endothelial cells, resulting in the disruption of capillary network formation in both in vitro and in vivo models. Direct intratumoral injections of plasmid DNA expressing hpRNA for MMP-9 and cathepsin B significantly inhibited established glioma tumor growth and invasion in intracranial tumors in vivo. Further intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of plasmid DNA expressing hpRNA for MMP-9 and cathepsin B completely regressed pre-established tumors for a long time (4 months) without any indication of these tumor cells. For the first time, these observations demonstrate that the simultaneous RNAi-mediated targeting of MMP-9 and cathepsin B has potential application for the treatment of human gliomas.",

As a preface to continued clinical investigation of this vaccination strategy, we have studied the contribution of an optimized IGF-1R AS-ODN, designated \"NOBEL\", to the induction of immunity to mouse GL261 glioma cells. The impact of NOBEL on mechanisms contributing to the development of GL261 immunity was first examined in the periphery. GL261 cells are naturally immunogenic when implanted into the flanks of congenic C57BL/6 mice, immunizing rather than forming tumors in around 50 % of these animals but causing tumors in the majority of mice lacking T and B lymphocytes. Overnight treatment with NOBEL in vitro reduces IGF-1R expression by GL261 cells but has minimal effect on cell viability and does not reduce the capacity of the cells to form tumors upon implantation. In contrast, tumors are extremely rare when GL261 cells are mixed with NOBEL at inoculation into the flanks of C57BL/6, and the recipient mice become immune to subcutaneous and intracranial challenge with untreated GL261. Adaptive immune mechanisms contribute to this effect, as immunocompromised mice fail to either fully control tumor formation or develop immunity following flank administration of the GL261/NOBEL mix. NOBEL's structure has known immunostimulatory motifs that likely contribute to the immunogenicity of the mix, but its specificity for IGF-1R mRNA is also important as a similarly structured sense molecule is not effective.",

These include R3616, which has both copies of gamma(1)34.5 deleted, R4009, which has a stop codon inserted after codon 28 in both copies of the gamma(1)34.5 gene, R849, which contains a lacZ gene inserted in place of the gamma(1)34.5, R908, which lacks 41 codons in frame after codon 72 of the gamma(1)34.5, and R939, which carries a stop codon precluding the translation of the COOH-terminal domain of the gamma(1)34.5 gene. We report the following: (a) all five mutant HSVs were avirulent in experimental animals but were cytotoxic for human tumor cells in vitro and in vivo; (b) the gamma(1)34.5- HSV replicated in human glioma cells almost as efficiently as wild-type HSV-1(F) based on replication assays, in situ hybridization for viral DNA, and expression of infected cell protein 27; (c) capacity of mutant HSVs to kill human cells derived from glioblastoma multiforme (CH-235MG, D-37MG, D-54MG, D-65MG, U-251MG, U-373MG, and SK-MG-1), anaplastic astrocytoma (Hs-683), anaplastic glioma (U-87MG and U-138MG), gliosarcoma (D-32GS), or normal human astrocytes demonstrated that glioma cells varied in their susceptibility to HSV-mediated cytotoxicity and that cultured astrocytes were two to three orders of magnitude less susceptible to killing than were malignant glia; and (d) scid mice, which received 0.5 or 5 x 10(6) plaque-forming units of R4009, either were coinoculated at the time of intracranial transplantation with 106 U251MG or D-54MG human glioma cells or received the cells intratumorally 5 days after tumor induction and experienced significant increases in median survivals, with no histopathological indication of an infectious encephalitic process.

To extend these findings and to uncover the underlying mechanisms, the ensuing experiments were undertaken. We hypothesized that immunizations combining both GM-CSF and IFNgamma systemically would increase the number of immature myeloid cells, which then would mature and differentiate into dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, thereby augmenting tumor antigen presentation and T-cell activation. Indeed, the combined therapy induced a systemic increase of both immature and mature myeloid cells but also an increase in T regulatory cells (T-regs). Cytotoxic anti-tumor responses, mirrored by an increase in Granzyme B-positive cells as well as IFNgamma-producing T-cells, were augmented after immunizations with GM-CSF and IFNgamma. We also show that the combined therapy induced a long-term memory with rejection of intracerebral (i.c.) rechallenges. Depletion of T-cells showed that both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were essential for the combined GM-CSF and IFNgamma effect. Finally, when immunizations were delayed until day 5 after tumor inoculation, only mice receiving immunotherapy with both GM-CSF and IFNgamma survived. We conclude that the addition of recombinant IFNgamma to immunizations with GM-CSF producing tumor cells increased the number of activated tumoricidal T-cells, which could eradicate established intracerebral tumors. These results clearly demonstrate that the combination of cytokines in immunotherapy of brain tumors have synergistic effects that have implications for clinical immunotherapy of human malignant brain tumors.",

The mechanism by which CIL-102 inhibits growth remains poorly understood in human astrocytoma cells. Herein, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which CIL-102 affects the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell cycle G2/M arrest in glioma cells. Treatment of U87 cells with 1.0μM CIL-102 resulted in phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK1/2), downregulation of cell cycle-related proteins (cyclin A, cyclin B, cyclin D1, and cdk1), and phosphorylation of cdk1Tyr(15) and Cdc25cSer(216). Furthermore, treatment with the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 abolished CIL-102-induced Cdc25cSer(216) expression and reversed CIL-102-inhibited cdk1 activation. In addition, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), an ROS scavenger, blocked cell cycle G2/M arrest and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Cdc25cSer(216) in U87 cells. CIL-102-mediated ERK1/2 and ROS production, and cell cycle arrest were blocked by treatment with specific inhibitors.

These models can serve as a platform in which to test novel therapeutics prior to the initiation of human clinical trials. In this study, an in vitro high-throughput drug screen as part of the DIPG preclinical consortium using cell-lines derived from our DIPG models identified BMS-754807 as a drug of interest in DIPG. BMS-754807 is a potent and reversible small molecule multi-kinase inhibitor with many targets including IGF-1R, IR, MET, TRKA, TRKB, AURKA, AURKB. In vitro evaluation showed significant cytotoxic effects with an IC50 of 0.13 μM, significant inhibition of proliferation at a concentration of 1.5 μM, as well as inhibition of AKT activation. Interestingly, IGF-1R signaling was absent in serum-free cultures from the PDGF-B; H3.3K27M; p53 deficient model suggesting that the antitumor activity of BMS-754807 in this model is independent of IGF-1R. In vivo, systemic administration of BMS-754807 to DIPG-bearing mice did not prolong survival. Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that tumor tissue drug concentrations of BMS-754807 were well below the identified IC50, suggesting that inadequate drug delivery may limit in vivo efficacy. In summary, an unbiased in vitro drug screen identified BMS-754807 as a potential therapeutic agent in DIPG, but BMS-754807 treatment in vivo by systemic delivery did not significantly prolong survival of DIPG-bearing mice.

These tumors are histological variants of glioblastoma, displaying a similar genetic profile and dismal prognosis. Up-regulation of PDGFR subfamily of tyrosine kinase members, PDGFR-alpha and c-Kit, and their intracellular effectors RAS/RAF/MAPK has a crucial role in the cancer development. In addition, signal transduction mediated by activating mutations of c-Kit and PDGFR can be effectively blocked by specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as Imatinib mesylate. The aim of this study was to characterize the molecular alterations of PDGFR signaling in gliosarcomas. Six cases were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for the expression of PDGFR-alpha, c-Kit and their ligands PDGF-A and SCF, respectively. The cases were further evaluated for the presence of activating mutations of PDGFR-alpha (exons 12 and 18) and c-kit (exons 9, 11, 13, and 17), as well as B-RAF (exons 11 and 15). Expression of PDGF-A was found in all cases and co-expression of PDGFR-alpha was observed in three cases. Four cases showed expression of SCF, and c-Kit was observed only in one case that also expressed SCF. Generally, immunoreaction predominates in the glial component. The mutational analysis of PDGFR-alpha showed the presence of an IVS17-50insT intronic insertion in two cases, one of them also with a 2472C > T silent mutation; this silent mutation was also found in another case. Glioma cell line analysis of IVS17-50insT insertion showed no influence on PDGFR-alpha gene splicing. No mutations were detected in c-kit and B-RAF oncogenes. Our results indicate that activating mutations of PDGFR-alpha, c-kit and B-RAF are absent in gliosarcomas. Nevertheless, the presence of a PDGFR-a/PDGFA and c-Kit/SCF autocrine/paracrine stimulation loop in a proportion of cases, supports the potential role of specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the treatment of gliosarcomas.",

The high specificity of this fusion to PA when compared with other CNS tumors has diagnostic utility. In addition, the frequency of alteration of this key pathway provides an opportunity for molecularly targeted therapy in this tumor. Here, we review the current knowledge on mechanisms of MAPK activation in PA and some of the downstream consequences of this activation, which are now starting to be elucidated both in vitro and in vivo, as well as clinical considerations and possible future directions.",

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether its efficacy could be enhanced by an X-ray boost administered after BNCT. Two brain tumor models were used, the F98 glioma as a model for primary brain tumors and the MRA 27 human melanoma as a model for metastatic brain tumors.;For biodistribution studies, either 10(5) F98 glioma cells were implanted stereotactically into the brains of syngeneic Fischer rats or 10(6) MRA 27 melanoma cells were implanted intracerebrally into National Institutes of Health (NIH)-rnu nude rats. Biodistribution studies were performed 11-13 days after implantation of the F98 glioma and 20-24 days after implantation of the MRA 27 melanoma. Animals bearing the F98 glioma received a combination of two boron-containing drugs, sodium borocaptate at a dose of 30 mg/kg and boron phenylalanine (BPA) at a dose of 250 mg/kg. MRA 27 melanoma-bearing rats received BPA (500 mg/kg) containing an equivalent amount of 10B (27 mg B/kg). The drugs were administered by either intracarotid or i.v. injection.;The tumor boron concentration after intracarotid injection was approximately 50% greater in the F98 glioma and MRA 27 melanoma after intracarotid injection (20.8 and 36.8 microg/g, respectively) compared with i.v. injection (11.2 and 19.5 microg/g, respectively). BNCT was carried out at the Brookhaven National Laboratory Medical Research Reactor approximately 14 days after tumor implantation of either the F98 glioma or the MRA 27 melanoma. Approximately 7-10 days after BNCT, subsets of animals were irradiated with 6-MV photons, produced by a linear accelerator at a total dose of 15 Gy, delivered in 5-Gy daily fractions. F98 glioma-bearing rats that received intracarotid or i.v. sodium borocaptate plus BPA, followed 2.5 h later by BNCT and 7-10 days later by X-rays, had similar mean survival times (61 days and 53 days, respectively, p = 0.25), and the non X-irradiated, BNCT-treated animals had a mean survival time of 52 and 40 days, respectively, for intracarotid vs. i.v. injection; the latter was equivalent to that of the irradiated animals. The corresponding survival time for MRA 27 melanoma-bearing rats that received intracarotid or i.v. BPA, followed by BNCT and then X-irradiation, was 75 and 82 days, respectively (p = 0.5), 54 days without X-irradiation (p = 0.0002), 37 days for X-irradiation alone, and 24 days for untreated controls. In contrast to the data obtained with the F98 glioma, MRA 27 melanoma-bearing rats that received i.v. BPA, followed by BNCT, had a highly significant difference in mean survival time compared with the irradiated controls (54 vs. 37 days, p = 0.008).;Our data are the first to suggest that a significant therapeutic gain may be obtained when BNCT is combined with an X-ray boost. Additional experimental studies are required to determine the optimal combination of X-radiation and neutron doses and whether it is more advantageous to administer the photon boost before or after BNCT.",

Primary cultured cells from the human brain tumor were used to determine the effectiveness of drugs for its treatment using Factor B (the accumulated cells in SG2M phases after anti-cancer drug treatment as the percentage of cells that was previously in SG2M phases) in comparison with the results (dose-response curves) obtained by glioma cell line.

We conducted a multicenter randomized phase II study comparing the efficacy and safety of TMZ administered concomitantly and sequentially to RT versus RT alone in patients with newly diagnosed GBM.;One hundred thirty patients with pathologically confirmed, newly diagnosed GBM were randomly assigned (110 assessable patients) to receive either TMZ 75 mg/m(2)/d orally, concomitantly with RT (60 Gy in 30 fractions; group A, n = 57), followed by six cycles of TMZ (150 mg/m(2) on days 1 through 5 and 15 to 19 every 28 days), or RT alone (60 Gy in 30 fractions; group B, n = 53).;Median time to progression was 10.8 months in group A and 5.2 months in group B (P = .0001).

These options have been evaluated for populations with a median age of approximately 58 years. We therefore addressed the issue of whether elderly patients (>65 years) could also benefit from cytoreductive surgery (CS) and adjuvant treatment using alkylating chemotherapy. One-hundred and three patients suffering from newly diagnosed, primary supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme >65 years (median 70.8 years) were identified in our single-center glioma database (2002-2007) and retrospectively divided into group A (n = 31) treated with surgery alone (biopsy, BY, n = 21, CS n = 10), group B (n = 37) surgery plus radiation (BY n = 18, CS n = 19), and group C (n = 35) surgery, RT and CHX (BY n = 4, CS n = 31). Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OAS) were determined in each group and correlated to age, Karnofsky performance score (KPS), and extent of resection (biopsy (BY), partial (PR), and complete resection (CR)). Progression was defined according the Macdonald criteria. For all patients PFS and OAS were 3.2 months and 5.1 months (m) respectively. PFS and OAS for groups A/B/C were 1.8/3.2/6.4 m (P = 0.000) and 2.2/4.4/15.0 m (P = 0.000), respectively. Median age for groups A/B/C was 74.4/70.6/68.5 years and median KPS was 60/70/80. Age (<75, ≥75) was inversely correlated with OAS (5.8/2.5 m, P = 0.01). KPS (<70, ≥70) was correlated with OAS 2.4/6.5 m (P = 0.000). Extent of resection (BY, PR, or CR) correlated with PFS (2.1/3.4/6.4 m, P = 0,000) and OS (2.2/7.0/13.9 m, P = 0,000), respectively. Our study shows that elderly GBM patients can benefit from maximum treatment procedures with cytoreductive microsurgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Treatment options are obviously affected by KPS and age. The most impressive outcome predictor in this population was the extent of microsurgical resection for patients treated with adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

Using FACS analysis and western blotting for the alphaVbeta3 integrin heterodimer, we determined that down-regulating uPAR subsequently causes the down-regulation of the alphaVbeta3 integrin heterodimer. As evidenced by western blot analysis of ERK1/2, pERK1/2, p38MAPK, p-p38MAPK, AKT, pAKT and PI3-k, the MEK and PI3-k pathways are inhibited. From cytoskeleton studies, we observed that the down-regulation of uPAR caused cytoskeletal condensation and that the simultaneous down-regulation of uPAR and cathepsin B was even more effective at inducing cytoskeletal condensation than uPAR alone.

        "Doc_abstract":"The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway is an important regulator of a wide spectrum of tumor-related biological processes, including cell proliferation, survival, and motility, as well as neovascularization. Protein kinase B/Akt is activated in a complex manner through the phosphorylation of protein kinase B/Akt on Thr308 and Ser473. Although protein-dependent kinase-1 has been shown to phosphorylate Akt at Thr308, it is not clear whether there is a distinct kinase that exclusively phosphorylates Akt at Ser473. A possible candidate is integrin-linked kinase (ILK), which has been shown to phosphorylate Akt at Ser473 in vitro. ILK is a multidomain focal adhesion protein that is believed to be involved in signal transmission from integrin and growth factor receptors. Further, ILK is implicated in the regulation of anchorage-dependent cell growth/survival, cell cycle progression, invasion and migration, and tumor angiogenesis. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that ILK inhibition would inhibit these processes in gliomas in which it is constitutively expressed. We found that a newly developed small-molecule compound (QLT0267) effectively inhibited signaling through the ILK/Akt cascade in glioma cells by blocking the phosphorylation of Akt and downstream targets, including mammalian target of rapamycin and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta. Treatment of glioma cells with 12.5 micromol/L QLT0267 inhibited cell growth by 50% at 48 hours. An anchorage-dependent cell growth assay confirmed the cell growth-inhibitory effect of QLT0267. Further, the decrease in cell growth was associated with a dramatic accumulation of cells in the G2-M phase of the cell cycle. Although the cell growth-inhibitory effects of the ILK inhibitor were achieved only at a high concentration, the QLT0267 was able to reduce cellular invasion and angiogenesis at much lower concentrations as shown by in vitro invasion assays and vascular endothelial growth factor secretion. Thus, blocking the ILK/Akt pathway is a potential strategy for molecular targeted therapy for gliomas.",

This study assesses grading of astrocytomas based on Raman spectroscopy for a future application in intra-surgical guidance. Our predictive classification models distinguish the surgically relevant classes \"normal tissue\" and \"low\" and \"high grade astrocytoma\" in Raman maps of moist bulk samples (80 patients) acquired with a fibre-optic probe. We introduce partial class memberships as a strategy to utilize borderline cases for classification. Borderline cases supply the most valuable training and test data for our application. They are (a) examples of the sought boundary and (b) the cases for which new diagnostics are needed. Besides, the number of suitable training samples increases considerably: soft logistic regression (LR) utilizes 85% more spectra and 50% more patients than linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The predictive soft LR models achieve ca. 85, 67 and 84% (normal, low and high grade) sensitivity and specificity. We discuss the different heuristics of LR and LDA in the light of borderline samples. While we focus on prediction, the spectroscopic interpretation of the predictive models agrees with previous descriptive studies. Unsaturated lipids are used to differentiate between normal and tumour tissues, while the total lipid content prominently contributes to the determination of the tumour grade. The high-wavenumber region above 2,800 cm(-1) alone did not allow successful grading.

Our recent study suggested that Akt is a crucial mediator of apoptosis sensitivity in response to ABT-737 in glioma cell lines. Inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt are currently being assessed clinically in patients with glioma. Because PI3K/Akt inhibition would be expected to have many proapoptotic effects, we hypothesized that there may be unique synergy between PI3K inhibitors and Bcl-2 homology 3 mimetics. Toward this end, we assessed the combination of the PI3K/Akt inhibitor NVP-BKM120 [5-(2,6-dimorpholinopyrimidin-4-yl)-4-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-amine] and the Bcl-2 family inhibitor ABT-737 in established and primary cultured glioma cells. We found that the combined treatment with these agents led to a significant activation of caspase-8 and -3, PARP, and cell death, irrespective of PTEN status. The enhanced lethality observed with this combination also appears dependent on the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c, smac/DIABLO, and apoptosis-inducing factor to the cytosol. Further study revealed that the upregulation of Noxa, truncation of Bid, and activation of Bax and Bak caused by these inhibitors were the key factors for the synergy. In addition, we demonstrated the release of proapoptotic proteins Bim and Bak from Mcl-1. We found defects in chromosome segregation leading to multinuclear cells and loss of colony-forming ability, suggesting the potential use of NVP-BKM120 as a promising agent to improve the anticancer activities of ABT-737.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning BRAFi-based therapy is therefore an important issue. Here we identified a previously unsuspected mechanism of BRAFi resistance driven by elevated Hedgehog (Hh) pathway activation that is observed in a cohort of melanoma patients after vemurafenib treatment. Specifically, we demonstrate that melanoma cell lines, with acquired in vitro-induced vemurafenib resistance, show increased levels of glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 and 2 (GLI1/GLI2) compared with naïve cells. We also observed these findings in clinical melanoma specimens. Moreover, the increased expression of the transcription factors GLI1/GLI2 was independent of canonical Hh signaling and was instead correlated with the noncanonical Hh pathway, involving TGFβ/SMAD (transforming growth factor-β/Sma- and Mad-related family) signaling. Knockdown of GLI1 and GLI2 restored sensitivity to vemurafenib-resistant cells, an effect associated with both growth arrest and senescence. Treatment of vemurafenib-resistant cells with the GLI1/GLI2 inhibitor Gant61 led to decreased invasion of the melanoma cells in a three-dimensional skin reconstruct model and was associated with a decrease in metalloproteinase (MMP2/MMP9) expression and microphthalmia transcription factor upregulation. Gant61 monotherapy did not alter the drug sensitivity of naïve cells, but could reverse the resistance of melanoma cells chronically treated with vemurafenib. We further noted that alternating dosing schedules of Gant61 and vemurafenib prevented the onset of BRAFi resistance, suggesting that this could be a potential therapeutic strategy for the prevention of therapeutic escape. Our results suggest that targeting the Hh pathway in BRAFi-resistant melanoma may represent a viable therapeutic strategy to restore vemurafenib sensitivity, reducing or even inhibiting the acquired chemoresistance in melanoma patients.Oncogene advance online publication, 17 October 2016; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.348.",

PHF20 appears to be a novel antigen in glioma, and has also termed glioma-expressed antigen 2. PHF20 is thought to contribute to the development of cancers, including glioblastoma, lung cancer, colon cancer and ovarian cancer. However, little is known about the function of PHF20 in various cancers. Here we report that PHF20 contains two consensus sites for protein kinase B (PKB) phosphorylation (RxRxxS/T). PKB can directly phosphorylate PHF20 on Ser291 in vitro and in vivo. It has been shown that PKB participates in the tumor suppressor p53 regulated gene expression program and has a direct effect on p21 regulation after DNA damage. UV-induced DNA damage results in accumulation of p53 and PKB activation. Interestingly, PKB-mediated PHF20 phosphorylation led to an inhibition of p53 induction following UV treatment, leading to the reduction of p21 transcriptional activity. Using anti PHF20 and anti pPKB (S473) antibodies, these events were mapped in various human cancer tissues. Taken together, these data suggest that PHF20 is a novel substrate for PKB and its phosphorylation by PKB plays an important role in tumorigenesis via regulating of p53 mediated signaling.",

The ability to detect these enzymes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) would be a minimally invasive method of evaluating brain tumors.;CSF from 66 patients with white blood cell counts of < or = 5 microL were analyzed for the presence of gelatinolytic activity by zymography. Twenty-nine patients had malignant astrocytomas, 10 had brain metastases from systemic malignancies, 4 had systemic cancer not involving the central nervous system, 4 had nonmalignant neurologic diseases, and 19 were healthy controls. Fifteen CSF samples had positive cytologies. The zymographic results were retrospectively correlated with clinical information and CSF cytologic data.;CSF from all patients with malignant astrocytomas or brain metastases contained precursor gelatinase A (pMMP2) and precursor gelatinase B (pMMP9), whereas control CSF contained only pMMP2. All patients with positive CSF cytologies had activated MMP2. A similar correlation was observed between the presence of activated MMP9 and positive CSF cytology.;The precursor and activated forms of gelatinases A and B can be detected in the CSF of patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors. The distribution of gelatinase activity in CSF distinguishes patients with malignant gliomas or brain metastases from those without brain tumors, and distinguishes patients with meningeal carcinomatosis from those without CSF spread of tumor, regardless of their brain tumor status. Analysis of MMPs in the CSF may be a sensitive technique for diagnosing CNS tumors and provide an early indication of tumor recurrence. This technique may also provide longitudinal information that would be useful in evaluating ongoing treatment and predicting tumor behavior.",

Surgery followed by standard radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide is the standard of care in patients with glioblastoma, however the prognosis remains poor with a median survival in the range of 12-15 months. Common genetic abnormalities in glioblastoma are associated with aberrant activation or suppression of cellular signal transduction pathways and resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. Special attention has been focused on targets such as epidermal growth factor receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and on pathways such as the phosphatidylinositol-3kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin and Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein-kinase pathways. Several signal transduction inhibitors have been examined in preclinical and clinical malignant glioma trials, including antiangiogenic agents (bevacizumab, enzastaurin), and inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (gefitinib and erlotinib), mammalian target of rapamycin (temsirolimus, everolimus) and integrin (cilengitide). Although preliminary clinical results of the use of targeted agents have not translated into significantly better survival, more recent phase II trials are exploring the combination of multitargeted drugs with cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy in order to overcome the resistance of tumors to single-agent targeted therapies. This review summarizes the current results with cytotoxic and targeted molecular agents in glioblastoma and the development of new chemoradiation strategies under evaluation to increase their effectiveness.",

Opiate receptor down-regulation and desensitization were homologous as indicated by the lack of apparent change in muscarinic, alpha 2-adrenergic, and PGE1 receptor binding and also retention, albeit modulation, of the ability of carbachol and norepinephrine to inhibit PGE1-stimulated increases in cyclic AMP levels after 24 hr of etorphine treatment. PGE1-stimulated increases in cyclic AMP levels remained identical in etorphine-treated and control cells. Several lines of evidence indicate that receptor desensitization and receptor down-regulation in NG108-15 cells are two separate cellular adaptation processes. (a) With an agonist which appears to be efficiently coupled, i.e., an agonist whose apparent Kd value is much larger than its apparent IC50 value for regulation of cyclic AMP levels (Ki), the concentration of ligand required to produce half-maximal down-regulation is analogous to its Ki value, whereas the concentration of ligand required to produce half-maximal desensitization is related to its Kd value; (b) receptor desensitization precedes receptor down-regulation; (c) only opiate agonists could produce receptor down-regulation, whereas both opiate agonists and partial agonists could desensitize post-receptor occupancy events. Still further evidence for dissociability of these processes was obtained by incubating NG108-15 cells with etorphine at 30 degrees for 2 hr. Under these conditions, there was a decrease in etorphine's ability to regulate adenylate cyclase while [3H]diprenorphine binding remained unaltered. IC50 values of D-Ala2-D-Leu5-enkephalin's competition for [3H]diprenorphine binding to intact cells increased 19.6-fold after etorphine treatment for 90 min, while naloxone IC50 values remained unaltered. This apparent increase in IC50 values was much lower, about 2-fold, when receptor binding was carried out in membranes isolated from cells treated with etorphine chronically. Furthermore, analysis of [3H]etorphine binding to such membranes in the presence of 10 mM Mg2+ indicated a loss of receptor binding sites with no change in apparent affinity, whereas [3H]diprenorphine binding revealed no significant alteration in either Bmax or Kd values. Therefore, during opiate receptor desensitization, a reduction of agonist high-affinity site occurs with no apparent alteration in total receptor number.",

Treatment with lovastatin resulted in the induction of LPS/IFN-gamma-mediated iNOS mRNA and increased nitric oxide (NO) production. The addition of mevalonate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) reversed the lovastatin-mediated effect, whereas FPP had no effect. An inhibitor of geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor (GGTI 298) further induced the cytokine and lovastatin-mediated iNOS expression, suggesting the involvement of geranylgeranylated proteins in the regulation of iNOS. Bacterial toxin B (inactivates RhoA, B, and C; CDC42; Rac proteins), C3 ADP-ribosyltransferase (C3) toxin from C. botulinum (inactivates RhoA, B, and C proteins), and Y-27632 (selective inhibitor of Rho-associated kinases) increased the LPS/IFN-gamma-mediated iNOS expression. Lovastatin treatment induced NO by increasing NF-kappaB translocation and its association with the CREB-binding protein (CBP/p300) via the downregulation of RhoA. Inhibition of RhoA resulted in increased activation of IKKalpha. Cotransfection studies with dominant-negative form of RhoA and iNOS-luciferase or NF-kappaB-luciferase reporter constructs further support these observations. Taken together, these studies show that downregulation of RhoA by lovastatin resulted in increased iNOS expression via the activation of NF-kappaB-CBP/p300 pathway in transformed brain cells.",

We treated human brain cancer and HL-60 leukemia cells, normal B-lymphoid cells, and murine melanoma cells in vitro with different concentrations of Ruta in combination with Ca3(PO4)2. Fifteen patients diagnosed with intracranial tumors were treated with Ruta 6 and Ca3(PO4)2. Of these 15 patients, 6 of the 7 glioma patients showed complete regression of tumors. Normal human blood lymphocytes, B-lymphoid cells, and brain cancer cells treated with Ruta in vitro were examined for telomere dynamics, mitotic catastrophe, and apoptosis to understand the possible mechanism of cell-killing, using conventional and molecular cytogenetic techniques. Both in vivo and in vitro results showed induction of survival-signaling pathways in normal lymphocytes and induction of death-signaling pathways in brain cancer cells. Cancer cell death was initiated by telomere erosion and completed through mitotic catastrophe events. We propose that Ruta in combination with Ca3(PO4)2 could be used for effective treatment of brain cancers, particularly glioma.",

Here, we have assessed the efficacy of the microtubule inhibiting agent epothilone B on glioblastoma cell motility, a prerequisite cellular program of invasive glioblastomas. Using cell migration assays and immunofluorescence techniques we demonstrated that epothilone B abrogated glioblastoma cell motility as a consequence of α-actinin 4 redistristrubiton and the breakdown of cellular structures (leading edge, stress fibers) it is associated with during cell migration. Evaluation of the microtubule actin cross linking factor in glioblastoma cells also revealed epothilone B invoked changes in this cytoskeleton cross linking protein, resembling α-actinin 4 changes in response to epothilone B. We have demonstrated in this study that epothilone B antagonizes glioblastoma cell motility due to the disruption of cytoskeleton binding proteins that aide in preserving the structural organization of the cytoskeleton filamentous network. Furthermore, we provide preclincial evidence that epothilone B effects on glioblastomas are not limited to the impairment of dividing tumors cells but that it also targets migratory and invasive glioblastoma cells, suggesting that this agent has potential clinical benefit due to its ability to target divergent cellular programs in the glioblastoma tumor mass.",

Other studies reported SIRT2 to be involved in mitotic progression in the normal cell cycle. We herein investigated whether SIRT2 functions in the mitotic checkpoint in response to mitotic stress caused by microtubule poisons. By monitoring chromosome condensation, the exogenously expressed SIRT2 was found to block the entry to chromosome condensation and subsequent hyperploid cell formation in glioma cell lines with a persistence of the cyclin B/cdc2 activity in response to mitotic stress. SIRT2 is thus a novel mitotic checkpoint protein that functions in the early metaphase to prevent chromosomal instability (CIN), characteristics previously reported for the CHFR protein. We further found that histone deacetylation, but not the aberrant DNA methylation of SIRT2 5'untranslated region is involved in the downregulation of SIRT2. Although SIRT2 is normally exclusively located in the cytoplasm, the rapid accumulation of SIRT2 in the nucleus was observed after treatment with a nuclear export inhibitor, leptomycin B and ionizing radiation in normal human fibroblasts, suggesting that nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling regulates the SIRT2 function. Collectively, our results suggest that the further study of SIRT2 may thus provide new insights into the relationships among CIN, epigenetic regulation and tumorigenesis.",

Hypoxia, a hallmark of aggressive tumor behavior often noted in GBMs, has been associated with resistance to therapy, poorer survival, and more malignant tumor phenotypes. Based on the existence of a set of novel imaging techniques and modeling tools, our objective was to assess a hypothesized quantitative link between tumor growth kinetics [assessed via mathematical models and routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] and the hypoxic burden of the tumor [assessed via positron emission tomography (PET) imaging]. Our biomathematical model for glioma kinetics describes the spatial and temporal evolution of a glioma in terms of concentration of malignant tumor cells. This model has already been proven useful as a novel tool to dynamically quantify the net rates of proliferation (rho) and invasion (D) of the glioma cells in individual patients. Estimates of these kinetic rates can be calculated from routinely available pretreatment MRI in vivo. Eleven adults with GBM were imaged preoperatively with (18)F-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO)-PET and serial gadolinium-enhanced T1- and T2-weighted MRIs to allow the estimation of patient-specific net rates of proliferation (rho) and invasion (D). Hypoxic volumes were quantified from each FMISO-PET scan following standard techniques. To control for tumor size variability, two measures of hypoxic burden were considered: relative hypoxia (RH), defined as the ratio of the hypoxic volume to the T2-defined tumor volume, and the mean intensity on FMISO-PET scaled to the blood activity of the tracer (mean T/B). Pearson correlations between RH and the net rate of cell proliferation (rho) reached significance (P < 0.04). Moreover, highly significant positive correlations were found between biological aggressiveness ratio (rho/D) and both RH (P < 0.00003) and the mean T/B (P < 0.0007).",

Then, adenovirus-mediated small hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression vectors rAd5-Akt1+COX-2 (rAd5-A+C) that target sequences of human COX-2 and Akt1 were used to examine the inhibitory effects on cell proliferation, invasion and apoptosis in SGC7901 gastric adenocarcinoma and U251 glioma cells. Cell growth was inhibited by over 70%, as indicated by a MTT assay, and was accompanied by G1/G0 phase arrest in the rAd5-A+C treated group, indicating poor cell growth activities. The number of cells invading through the matrigel in the rAd5-A+C treated group was significantly decreased (36.2+/-3.1) compared with that of the control group SGC7901 (105.0+/-4.0) and the nonsense sequence group rAd5-HK (102.5+/-6.4). In addition, the tumor volumes in the SGC7901 subcutaneous nude mouse model treated with rAd5-A+C was significantly smaller than those of the control group and nonsense sequence group rAd5-HK. When COX-2 and Akt1 were dramatically downregulated, Ki-67, CyclinD1, MMP-2, MMP-9 and Bcl-2 were also downregulated. Our results demonstrated that p-Akt and COX-2 were overexpressed in gastric adenocarcinomas and their expression levels were elevated with the ascending order of tumor malignancy; rAd5-A+C targeting COX-2 and Akt1 downregulated their expression significantly in a sequence-specific manner, exerting inhibitory effects on SGC7901 and U251 cell proliferation, invasion and apoptosis.

Younger age and higher KPS were associated with longer survival. After adjusting for patient factors and drop-out, survival was longer after PCV + RT (HR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.49-0.9, p = 0.0084; HR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.54-1.01, p = 0.0592) in models with MMSE and B-QOL. In addition, there were no differences in MMSE and B-QOL scores between arms (p = 0.4752 and p = 0.2767, respectively); higher scores predicted longer survival.;MMSE and B-QOL scores held steady in the upper range in both arms for survivors. Younger, fitter patients had better MMSE and B-QOL and longer survival.",

Target validation was established using the thymidine kinase (TK) 1(+) wild-type, murine L929 cell line and its TK1(-) mutant counterpart, which were implanted s.c. (s.c.) into nude mice. Two intratumoral (i.t.) injections of (10)B-enriched N5-2OH were administered to tumor-bearing mice at 2-hour intervals, after which BNCT was carried out at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Research Reactor. Thirty days after BNCT, mice bearing TK1(+) L929 tumors had a 15x reduction in tumor volume compared with TK1(-) controls. Based on these favorable results, BNCT studies were then initiated in rats bearing intracerebral (i.c.) RG2 gliomas, after i.c. administration of N5-2OH by Alzet osmotic pumps, either alone or in combination with i.v. (i.v.) boronophenylalanine (BPA), a drug that has been used clinically. The mean survival times (MSTs) of RG2 glioma bearing rats were 45.6 +/- 7.2 days, 35.0 +/- 3.3 days, and 52.9 +/- 8.9 days, respectively, for animals that received N5-2OH, BPA, or both. The differences between the survival plots of rats that received N5-2OH and BPA alone were highly significant (P = 0.0003). These data provide proof-of-principle that a 3CTA can function as a boron delivery agent for NCT. Further studies are planned to design and synthesize 3CTAs with enhanced chemical and biological properties, and increased therapeutic efficacy.",

SSAT levels were downregulated at both the mRNA and protein levels by shRNA-mediated simultaneous knockdown of MMP-9 and uPAR/cathepsin B. In addition, we noted a prominent reduction in the expression of SSAT with MMP-9 and uPAR/cathepsin B knockdown in the tumor regions of 5310 injected nude mice brains. Further, SSAT knockdown in glioma xenograft cells significantly reduced their migration potential. Interestingly, MMP-9, uPAR and cathepsin B overexpression in these xenograft cells significantly elevated SSAT mRNA and protein levels. The migratory potential of MMP-9/uPAR/cathepsin B-overexpressed 4910 and 5310 cells was not affected by either glybenclamide (Kir 6.x inhibitor) or tertiapin-Q (Kir 1.1 and 3.x inhibitor) but instead was significantly inhibited by either barium or Kir4.2 siRNA treatments. Co-localization of α9 integrin with Kir4.2 was observed in both 4910 and 5310 xenograft cells. However, MMP-9 and uPAR/cathepsin B knockdown in these cells prominently reduced the co-localization of α9 with Kir4.2. Taken together, our results clearly demonstrate that α9β1 integrin-mediated cell migration utilizes SSAT and the Kir4.2 potassium channel pathway, and inhibition of the migratory potential of these glioma xenograft cells by simultaneous knockdown of MMP-9 and uPAR/cathepsin B could be attributed to the reduced SSAT levels and co-localization of α9 integrin with Kir4.2 inward rectifier potassium channels.",

To clarify the biological and clinical behavior of these rare tumors, the authors retrospectively identified 59 patients with gemistocytic astrocytoma whose tumors were diagnosed and treated between June, 1976, and July, 1989. Three patients who were lost to follow-up review were excluded, as were two whose original slides could not be obtained and three whose tumors were diagnosed at recurrence or at autopsy. The pathological material of the remaining 51 patients was reviewed using two sets of histological criteria. Thirteen patients (Group A) had \"pure\" gemistocytic astrocytoma, defined as a glial tumor with more than 60% gemistocytes/high-power field and a background of fibrillary astrocytes. Fifteen patients (Group B) had \"mixed\" gemistocytic astrocytoma, defined as a glial tumor with 20% to 60% gemistocytes/high-power field and a background of anaplastic astrocytes. Twenty-three tumors did not meet these criteria and were excluded from analysis. The median age of the patients was 48.5 years in Group A and 38.3 years in Group B (p less than 0.05). In both groups, the median Karnofsky Performance Scale score was greater than 90%. All patients underwent surgical procedures (four total and 19 partial resections, and five biopsies) and postoperative radiation therapy. The majority also had interstitial brachytherapy, chemotherapy, or both. Ten patients had one reoperation for tumor recurrence and one had two reoperations; other treatments for recurrence included brachytherapy, chemotherapy, and repeat irradiation. All four patients who originally underwent gross total resection are still alive; all five who had a biopsy have died. There was no significant difference in median survival times between groups: 136.5 weeks in Group A (range 10 to 310+ weeks) and 135.6 weeks in Group B (range 31 to 460+ weeks). Analysis of all 28 patients showed a better prognosis for patients less than 50 years of age (185 vs. 36 weeks survival time; p less than 0.001), patients with preoperative symptoms lasting for more than 6 months (228.1 vs. 110.2 weeks survival time; p less than 0.05), and patients with seizures as the first symptom (185.7 vs. 80 weeks survival time; p less than 0.01). Survival time did not correlate with the presence of perivascular lymphocytic infiltration. The authors conclude that the presence of at least 20% gemistocytes in a glial neoplasm is a poor prognostic sign, irrespective of the pathological background. It is proposed that gemistocytic astrocytomas be classified with anaplastic astrocytomas and treated accordingly.",

All patients were previously managed with radiotherapy 60 Gy total dose and chemotherapy with nitrosoureas and platinum compounds. At recurrence they were subdivided in homogeneous groups, all treated with the same systemic chemotherapy protocol: 27 GBL (group A) only systemically treated, 20 GBL (group B) treated also locally by delivering 4mg of mitoxantrone every 20 days through the Ommaya reservoire, and 25 GBL (group C) treated with a second surgery and locally as group B. Of the AA group, 13/27 were treated locally trough the Ommaya reservoir after repeat surgery. A trend to different demographic features among subgroups (with locoregionally treated patients and patients undergoing repeat surgery being younger than the others) was seen in this non-randomized study, but this was not statistically significant. Median overall survival was 27, 26 and 15.5 months respectively for groups c, b and a (log-rank = 0.1). After tumor recurrence median survival was 16.8, 12 and 6.6 months respectively for groups c, b and a (log-rank = 0.001) For the 29 AA, overall survival was 48.5 and 100 months (log-rank = 0.03) if treated locally with second tumor debulking. Our results stress the opinion that a second operation could be indicated only if it is a part of a therapeutic protocol to allow a locoregional treatment.

Positron emission tomography (PET) is the best-validated noninvasive technique able to demonstrate the presence of hypoxia in vivo. The locally developed PET tracer for imaging hypoxia, 1-alpha-D: -(5-deoxy-5-[(18)F]-fluoroarabinofuranosyl)-2-nitroimidazole ((18)F-FAZA), has been shown to accumulate in experimental models of tumour hypoxia and to clear rapidly from the circulation and nonhypoxic tissues. The safety and general biodistribution patterns of this radiopharmaceutical in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC), small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) or non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), malignant lymphoma, and high-grade gliomas, were demonstrated in this study.;Patients with known primary or suspected metastatic HNSCC, SCLC or NSCLC, malignant lymphoma or high-grade gliomas were dosed with 5.2 MBq/kg of (18)F-FAZA, then scanned 2-3 h after injection using a PET or PET/CT scanner. Images were interpreted by three experienced nuclear medicine physicians. The location and relative uptake scores (graded 0 to 4) of normal and abnormal (18)F-FAZA biodistribution patterns, the calculated tumour-to-background (T/B) ratio, and the maximum standardized uptake value were recorded.;Included in the study were 50 patients (32 men, 18 women). All seven patients with high-grade gliomas showed very high uptake of (18)F-FAZA in the primary tumour. In six out of nine patients with HNSCC, clear uptake of (18)F-FAZA was observed in the primary tumour and/or the lymph nodes in the neck. Of the 21 lymphoma patients (15 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 6 with Hodgkin's disease), 3 demonstrated moderate lymphoma-related uptake. Of the 13 lung cancer patients (12 NSCLC, 1 SCLC), 7 had increased (18)F-FAZA uptake in the primary lung tumour. No side effects of the administration of (18)F-FAZA were observed.;This study suggests that (18)F-FAZA may be a very useful radiopharmaceutical to image hypoxia in the tumour types selected. Especially the high uptake by gliomas was encouraging. Given the good imaging properties, including acceptable T/B ratios in the tumour categories studied, (18)F-FAZA could be considered as a very promising agent for assessing the hypoxic fraction of these tumour types.",

The more activated the inflammatory cells, the more activated the tumors appeared to be. In the tumor with the largest infiltration (Case 3), inflammatory cells were stained for interferon-gamma, interleukin-2, interleukin-1 beta, lymphotoxin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and transforming growth factor-beta. The tumor cells also expressed interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, transforming growth factor-beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and prostaglandin E. In contrast, in the tumor with the least inflammatory response (Case 1), the tumor cells did not express any cytokines. Expression of cytokines by glioma cells was modest in the two cases with modest inflammatory responses. Cellular inflammation, primarily consisting of T cells and macrophages with few or no B cells or natural killer cells, was two- to 15-fold greater outside the tumor than within. In contrast to leukocytes outside the tumor, which were activated and expressing class II major histocompatibility antigens, leukocytes within the tumor parenchyma or at the tumor's edge were negative for these antigens. In the four specimens studied here, the tumor cells themselves were also negative for class II major histocompatibility antigens. These findings, although preliminary, suggest that inflammatory cells within gliomas are inactivated and that glioma cells may increase the expression of immunosuppressive cytokines in response to an increased lymphocyte infiltrate. This observation, if corroborated by more extensive studies, may help to explain the failure of immune treatments in glioblastoma multiforme.",

The author spent nearly 1 year in Klatzo's laboratory at the NHI in Bethesda, and the first part of results presented here originate directly from this collaboration. It was shown that following cortical injury, movement of edema fluid into the tissue occurs by bulk flow, and that the driving force is a small tissue pressure gradient. Resolution of edema fluid is achieved by clearance into the ventricular and subarachnoid CSF, is enhanced in the presence of pressure gradients and is supported by re-absorption into capillaries. Using appropriate techniques, the formation rate as well as clearance of edema into CSF and tissue resorption could be determined in human brain metastases and malignant gliomas. Three examples of clinical applications based on the discussed mechanisms are presented: a. Fluorescence-guided surgery of gliomas is based on the accumulation of 5-ALA in tumour cells; there being enzymatically converted to PP-IX, a compound with deep red fluorescence. This fluorescence is used for the more accurate surgical removal of gliomas. b. Radioimmunotherapy of gliomas uses an anti-tenascin antibody, coupled with a nuclide, administered postoperatively into the tumour cavity, from where it diffuses into tissue, couples to the receptor at the glioma cells. Then the isotope destroys the tumour cells. c. Convection-enhanced delivery is based on the interstitial infusion of an appropriate cytotoxic drug into the white matter at low pressure. Thus, the method employs bulk flow, distributes a drug in a larger tissue volume and eventually achieves drug concentrations greater than systemic levels. Experimental studies and clinical results are presented for all three clinical applications.I am very grateful to Z. Czernicki and the organizing group for being offered the great honour of presenting the first Igor Klatzo Lecture. In this report first previous results of bulk flow and diffusion in the development and resolution of brain edema will be revisited, then some recent examples will be shown as to how this knowledge of diffusion and bulk flow can be transferred into clinical applications.A great part of the work on bulk flow and diffusion was done during a stay in I. Klatzo's laboratory in Bethesda in 1973/1974 (Fig. 1). Since then a long collaboration developed with I. Klatzo and M. Spatz. Due to given limits, I will concentrate on the studies of our group.

Histologic diagnosis revealed ependymoma (20 cases), astrocytoma (15 cases), glioblastoma multiforme (1 case), and other histologic diagnoses (8 cases). We performed 20 gross total resections, 19 partial resections, and 5 biopsies. The mean follow-up period was 25.8 months (3 months-10 years). Surgical results were improvement in 11 patients (25%), stabilization in 24 (54%), and deterioration in 9 (20%). The first 28 cases (group A) were diagnosed using conventional myelography and CT myelography. The more recent 16 cases (group B) were diagnosed with MRI and operated on using techniques such as ultrasonic aspiration, intraoperative monitoring and ultrasound imaging. Radical surgery (total excision) was performed in 36% (n = 10) of group A, while it was possible in 62% (n = 10) of group B. Deterioration after operation was noted in 28% (n = 8) of group A, but only 6.2% (n = 1) of group B. These results stress the importance of a preoperative MRI scan and the positive effects of intraoperative ultrasound imaging, ultrasonic aspiration, and evoked potential monitoring on surgical results. With the help of these tools, most intramedullary spinal cord tumors may be diagnosed and treated surgically with significantly decreased risk.

Accord-ingly, in the new Sainte-Anne grading system of oligodendrogliomas, endothelial hyperplasia and contrast enhancement, both being indicators of microangiogenesis, are key criteria for the distinction of grade A from grade B tumours. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent angiogenic factor: a strong correlation between VEGF expression, Sainte-Anne malignancy grade and patient outcome might thus be expected. In order to assess this hypothesis, VEGF immunostaining was performed in a series of 34 oligodendrogliomas that included 11 grade B and 23 grade A, of which nine became grade B during the study period (mean clinical and imaging follow-up: 41 months). VEGF expression correlated strongly with Sainte-Anne tumour grade (P < 0.001), and inversely with patient survival (P < 0.001) and recurrence-free survival (P = 0.002). One hundred per cent of grade B but only 17% of grade A were VEGF-positive. By contrast, the MIB-1 labelling index did not correlate with VEGF expression, total survival or recurrence-free survival. In accordance with the grading system, this study showed that, in oligodendrogliomas, VEGF expression and microangiogenesis are progression-related phenomena that confer on these tumours a growth advantage by presumably reducing hypoxia-induced apoptotic cell death. These findings might have important implications in the future for the indication and timing of anti-angiogenic therapies.",

After treatment, CD4+ T cell count increased and CD8+ T cell count decreased than their pre treatment levels. Serum IgA and IgG levels were decreased in both benign and malignant brain tumor patients before treatment than in control subjects. Serum IgM level has been increased in both benign and malignant tumor patients before and after treatment than in control subjects. Anaplastic malignant astrocytoma, medulloblastoma and glioblastoma multiforme patients showed higher IgM level than astrocytoma, meningioma and ependymoma patients. In conclusions, the depressed host cellular immunity in benign and malignant tumor patients before treatment may be due to the changes in CD4+ and CD8+ counts in addition to tumour specific immunosuppressive factors. Treatment procedures such as surgery, CT and RT may play certain role in the post operative depressed immunosuppression in malignant tumor patients. Humoral immune mechanism (CD19+) in the ICT patients was less markedly affected.",

Surgery represents the standard therapy, with the goal of obtaining complete resection even at the risk of neurological morbidity. MRI is the gold standard for diagnosis and assessment of intramedullary tumors. Nevertheless, sometimes MRI may not accurately differentiate between different types of intramedullary tumors, in particular if they are associated with syringes or intra- and peritumoral cysts. This could subsequently affect surgical strategies. Intraoperative ultrasound (ioUS) has become in the last few years a very useful tool for use during neurosurgical procedures. Various ioUS modalities such as B-mode and Doppler have been applied during neurosurgical procedures. On the other hand, the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is not yet well defined and standardized in this field. We report a case of a young patient harboring a cervicothoracic intramedullary tumor, for which the preoperative neuroradiologi-cal diagnosis was in favor of a diffuse astrocytoma with nodular components whereas ioUS demonstrated 3 distinct intramedullary nodules. CEUS showed highly vascularized lesions, compatible with hemangioblastomas. These findings, particularly those obtained with CEUS, allowed better definition of the lesions for diagnosis, enhanced understanding of the physiopathological aspects, and permitted the localization of all 3 nodules, thus limiting spinal cord manipulation and allowing complete resection of the lesions, with an uneventful postoperative neurological course. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of intraoperative CEUS in a case of intramedullary hemangioblastoma. ",

With the method 2, 6 had partial response (24%), 18 had stabilized disease (72%) and 1 had progressive disease.;Response rate to PCV chemotherapy in this study was lower than response observed in the literature. Because of the infiltrative feature of oligodendroglioma, we think that the radiological response of these tumors should be evaluated on T2 weighted-MRI.

All four cell lines demonstrated significant reactivity with anti-neuroectodermal-associated MAb. No apparent pattern of reactivity with anti-lymphoid MAb was seen; notably, there was a uniform absence of detectable Thy-1. Review of the complete antibody reactivity profile revealed a dichotomy between lines TE-671 and Daoy and lines D283 Med and D341 Med, which have been previously shown to express neurofilament protein in culture and xenografts, and to exhibit neuroblastic morphological features in biopsy and xenograft tissue sections.

In this context, low density lipoproteins (LDL) play a key role in the delivery of the photosensitizer in tumor cells. We correlate the physicochemical parameters of the berberine association to LDL with the influence of LDL-delivery on its accumulation in a glioma cell line and on its photo-induced activity in view of antitumor PDT. Our results evidence an important binding of 400 berberine molecules per LDL. Changes in berberine and apoprotein fluorescence suggest different fixation types, involving various LDL compartments including the vicinity of the apoprotein. The berberine association to LDL does not affect their recognition by the specific B/E receptors, of which over-expression increases the cellular uptake of LDL-preloaded berberine. Fluorescence microscopy evidences the mitochondrial labeling of the glioma model cells, with no significant modification upon LDL-delivery. Moreover, the cellular delivery of berberine by LDL increases its photocytotoxic effects on such cells. So, this research illustrates the potential of berberine as a photosensitizing agent for PDT, in particular due to their behavior towards LDL as plasma vehicles, and gives insights into its mechanisms of cell uptake.

For each tumor, we ascertained information on patient age, sex, tumor location, oncological treatment, and survival after surgery. The analysis of the tumor volume and the extent of tumor resection (incomplete versus complete resection of the macroscopic tumor) was made retrospectively from the preoperative radiological investigations and, when available, also from postoperative radiology. We performed semiquantitative immunohistochemical evaluation of the presence of intermediate filament (nanofilament) proteins glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin, nestin, and synemin in tumor cells. The intermediate filament system helps cells and tissues to cope with various types of stress, and thus, it might affect the malignant potential of grade IV astrocytoma. We propose a subclassification of astrocytomas grade IV with respect to the expression of the intermediate filament proteins glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin, nestin, and synemin, namely, type A, B, and C. Our results suggest that the expression of the intermediate filament proteins glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin, nestin, and synemin is coregulated in grade IV astrocytomas.

The latter condition is the most critical to be realized as none of the boron carriers used for experimental or clinical purposes proved at the moment an optimal selectivity for cancer cells compared to normal cells. In addition to complex physical factors, the assessment of the intracellular concentration of boron represent a crucial parameter to predict the dose delivered to the cancer cells during the treatment. Nowadays the dosimetry calculation and then the prediction of the treatment effectiveness are made using Monte Carlo simulations, but some of the model assumption are still uncertain: the radiobiological dose efficacy and the probability of tumour cell survival are crucial parameters that needs a more reliable experimental approach. The aim of this work was to evaluate the differential ability of two cell lines to selectively concentrate the boron-10 administered as di-hydroxyboryl-phenylalanine (BPA)-fructose adduct, and the effect of the differential boron intake on the damage produced by the irradiation with thermal neutrons; the two cell lines were selected to be representative one of normal tissues involved in the active/passive transport of boron carriers, and one of the tumour. Recent in vitro studies demonstrated how BPA is taken by proliferating cells, however the mechanism of BPA uptake and the parameters driving the kinetics of influx and the elimination of BPA are still not clarified. In these preliminary studies we analysed the survival of F98 and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) cells line after irradiation, using different thermal fluencies at the same level of density population and boron concentration in the growing medium prior the irradiation. This is first study performed on endothelium model obtained by a primary human cell line (HUVEC). The perspective application of this work is to develop a model able to foresee the effects produced by different combination of boron influx with a thermal neutron fluencies, applying a standardized radiobiological methodology, and in particular to continue the investigation of the radiobiological effects on the endothelium model as the main tissue involved in the transport of boronated molecules.",

It has also been evaluated in several clinical trials for treatment of brain tumors such as high-grade glioma. In this study, we investigated the influence of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) on distribution of gefitinib to the central nervous system. In vitro studies conducted in Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells indicate that both P-gp and BCRP effectively transport gefitinib, limiting its intracellular accumulation. In vivo studies demonstrated that transport of gefitinib across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is significantly limited. Steady-state brain-to-plasma (B/P) concentration ratios were 70-fold higher in the Mdr1a/b(-/-) Bcrp1(-/-) mice (ratio of approximately 7) compared with wild-type mice (ratio of approximately 0.1). The B/P ratio after oral administration increased significantly when gefitinib was coadministered with the dual P-gp and BCRP inhibitor elacridar. We investigated the integrity of tight junctions in the Mdr1a/b(-/-) Bcrp1(-/-) mice and found no difference in the brain inulin and sucrose space between the wild-type and Mdr1a/b(-/-) Bcrp1(-/-) mice. This suggested that the dramatic enhancement in the brain distribution of gefitinib is not due to a leakier BBB in these mice. These results show that brain distribution of gefitinib is restricted due to active efflux by P-gp and BCRP. This finding is of clinical significance for therapy in brain tumors such as glioma, where concurrent administration of a dual inhibitor such as elacridar can increase delivery and thus enhance efficacy of gefitinib.",

In phase A, pGL1-TNF-alpha expression within tumors was dose dependent and transient, with highest levels seen at 18 h after injection, whereas no TNF-alpha protein was detected in plasma. Low erythrocyte counts, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were associated with tumor presence, but the reduction in these variables was most striking in the group receiving 450 microg of pGL1-TNF-alpha, the group that also exhibited thrombocytopenia at 72 h. In phase B, treatment with pGL1-TNF-alpha at 15 or 150 microg resulted in the greatest degree of splenomegaly, increased spontaneous blastogenesis by splenocytes, and high leukocyte and lymphocyte numbers in the spleen. In these same two groups, flow cytometry analyses of spleen cells showed that high levels of natural killer (panNK+) cells, B (CD19+) lymphocytes, and cells expressing the CD71 and CD25 activation markers were present (p < 0.05). An enhancing effect was also noted in some of the measurements with parental plasmid p WS4 and tumor presence. In phase C, the slowest tumor progression was observed in the groups receiving 15 and 150 microg pGL1-TNF-alpha together with radiation; tumor volumes were 51 and 43% smaller, respectively, than for PBS-injected controls by the end of the study.

        "Doc_abstract":"We reviewed the anti-cancer effects of DCA, an orphan drug long used as an investigational treatment for various acquired and congenital disorders of mitochondrial intermediary metabolism. Inhibition by DCA of mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases and subsequent reactivation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and oxidative phosphorylation is the common mechanism accounting for the drug's anti-neoplastic effects. At least two fundamental changes in tumor metabolism are induced by DCA that antagonize tumor growth, metastases and survival: the first is the redirection of glucose metabolism from glycolysis to oxidation (reversal of the Warburg effect), leading to inhibition of proliferation and induction of caspase-mediated apoptosis. These effects have been replicated in both human cancer cell lines and in tumor implants of diverse germ line origin. The second fundamental change is the oxidative removal of lactate, via pyruvate, and the co-incident buffering of hydrogen ions by dehydrogenases located in the mitochondrial matrix. Preclinical studies demonstrate that DCA has additive or synergistic effects when used in combination with standard agents designed to modify tumor oxidative stress, vascular remodeling, DNA integrity or immunity. These findings and limited clinical results suggest that potentially fruitful areas for additional clinical trials include 1) adult and pediatric high grade astrocytomas; 2) BRAF-mutant cancers, such as melanoma, perhaps combined with other pro-oxidants; 3) tumors in which resistance to standard platinum-class drugs alone may be overcome with combination therapy; and 4) tumors of endodermal origin, in which extensive experimental research has demonstrated significant anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic effects of DCA, leading to improved host survival.

        "Doc_abstract":"The possibility of links between psychosocial factors and cancer incidence and progression has generated considerable scientific and public interest. Tachykinins, including substance P, neurokinin A and B, hemokinin-1 and endokinins, are a family of neuropeptides, acting through three types of transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors denoted NK1, NK2 and NK3. Besides their role as neurotransmitters in peripheral and central nervous system, tachykinins and their receptors are also expressed in several non neuronal cells contributing to the fine connections between nervous systems and peripheral organ system such as respiratory, cardiovascular, immune, endocrine, gastrointestinal and genitourinary. Being so much involved in regulating physiological functions, they, of course, can concur to pathological conditions including cancer. Tachykinins can act on different steps of carcinogenesis. Tumors expressing NK receptors, such as astrocytoma, glioma, neuroblastoma, pancreatic cancer and melanoma, can misuse tachykinin-induced signaling, operating in normal cells, to promote proliferation and survival of cancer cells and to release cytokines and soluble mediators favoring tumor growth. In neuroblastoma, breast and prostate carcinomas tachykinins facilitate tumor metastatic infiltration in the bone marrow. In neuroendocrine carcinoma, tachykinins are responsible of symptoms associated with these pathologies including flushing, diarrhea, wheezing and right heart disease. In addition, regardless tumor histology, tachykinins may favor cancer incidence and metastatic progression by influencing blood flux and neovascularization in tumor formation as well as inducing immunosuppression mediated by neurogenic inflammation due to stress or surgery. However, the precise involvement of tachykinins in cancer pathologies and the potentiality to become effective pharmacological drug targets remain to be fully defined.",

Animals were killed 1, 2.5, and 5 h later, and their brains were removed for boron determination. For BNCT experiments, which were initiated 14 days after intracerebral implantation of 1000 F98 cells, BSH (30 mg B/kg b.wt. was administered intravenously (i.v.) without BBB-D, or i.c. with or without BBB-D.

Between March 1985 and September 1988, 70 successive children with newly diagnosed medulloblastoma from eight centers were treated in this prospective nonrandomized study. Patients were assigned to two risk groups. Group A included patients with macroscopically complete or subtotal excision, no brainstem involvement, no atypical cells in the cerebrospinal fluid, normal myelography, and who were more than 2 years of age. Group B patients encompassed those who did not fit the criteria for Group A. Two children were excluded from analysis after histological review confirmed ependymoma. Thus, a population of 68 children was selected, with 31 in Group A and 37 in Group B. Treatment consisted of two courses of the \"eight drugs in 1 day\" (\"8/1\") regimen followed by two courses of high-dose methotrexate (12 g/m2). Radiotherapy was begun during the 7th week after surgery in Group A and during the 5th week in Group B. In patients older than 2 years, the median radiation dose to the posterior fossa, the spinal axis, and the brain was 54 Gy, 36 Gy, and 27 Gy, respectively. Group B patients received postirradiation chemotherapy with four 8/1 courses monthly. The median time from surgery to radiation therapy was 50 days (range 21 to 141 days). One fatality due to chicken pox on Day 102 and one World Health Organization Grade IV infection occurred. The estimated 5- and 7-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 62% and 59%, respectively. These were 74% and 62% in Group A and 57% and 57% in Group B. Patient age, extent of resection, and radiation dose to the whole brain had no prognostic value. Patients with metastasis had a nonsignificant trend for a worse prognosis than patients with nonmetastatic disease (7-year DFS 45% vs. 68%, p = 0.11). In Group B, the 7-year DFS rates for children who received more or less than 30 Gy to the brain were 69% and 52% respectively (p = 0.15). There were recurrences in the posterior fossa (37%), spine (20%), and brain (20%). After a review of radiotherapeutic treatments, only one supratentorial failure could be blamed on reduction of the supratentorial radiation dose.

Dose escalation occurred if no dose-limiting toxicities, defined as any Grade 4-5 toxicity or Grade 3 toxicity requiring hospitalization, occurred during treatment.;Of 14 patients, 5 were treated with weekly patupilone at 1.5 mg/m(2), 4 at 2.0 mg/m(2), 4 at 2.5 mg/m(2), and 1 at 4 mg/m(2). Of 18 patients, 7 were treated in the 6-mg/m(2) group, 6 in the 8-mg/m(2) group, and 5 in the 10-mg/m(2) group. Primary central nervous system malignancies received RT to a median dose of 60 Gy. Central nervous system metastases received whole brain RT to a median dose of 37.4 Gy, and patients with recurrent gliomas underwent stereotactic RT to a median dose of 37.5 Gy. One dose-limiting toxicity (pneumonia) was observed in group receiving 8-mg/m(2) every 3 weeks. At the subsequent dose level (10 mg/m(2)), two Grade 4 dose-limiting toxicities occurred (renal failure and pulmonary hemorrhage); thus, 8 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks was the maximal tolerated dose and the recommended Phase II dose.;Combined with a variety of radiation doses and fractionation schedules, concurrent patupilone was well tolerated and safe, with a maximal tolerated dose of 8 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks.",

We studied a homogeneous series using the Sainte-Anne grading scale in order to better understanding the history of these tumors with or without treatment and to assess prognosis and associated factors.;A retrospective series of 318 adult patients with oligodendroglioma (OLG) treated at Hôpital Sainte-Anne, Paris (SA) and Hôpital Neurologique, Lyons (L) between 1984 and 2003 was analyzed: 182 grade A OLG (SA + L), 136 grade B among which a homogenous series of 98 (SA) were included. For grade A: age at diagnosis ranged from 21 to 70 (mean: 41), sex ratio was 1.28. For grade B: age at diagnosis ranged from 12 to 75 (mean: 45.5), sex-ratio was 1.58. The main first symptoms were: epilepsy (A: 91.5%; B: 76%), intracranial hypertension (A: 7.9%; B: 14.6%), neurological deficit (A: 5.1%; B: 17.7%). The most frequent locations were: frontal, insular and central for both A and B. Mean size was 55 mm for grade A, 62 mm for B. Calcifications were found in 20% of A, 48.5% of B. No tumor was enhanced on imaging (CT/MRI) in grade A, all but 7 in grade B. All patients underwent surgery either for biopsy (A: 47.2%; B: 53%), or removal which was partial (A: 26.4% vs B: 19.4%) or extended (A: 36.3% vs B: 37.8%). Fifty-six patients underwent 2 procedures and 12 three procedures. Radiotherapy was performed in 76.9% of grade A, and 91% of B patients, in the immediate postoperative period for 71% A and 82.7% B. Chemotherapy was delivered for 36% of grade A (in the event of transformation to grade B or failure of radiotherapy) and 67.5% of B patients. Among grade A tumors, 38% transformed into grade B within a mean delay of 51 months with a mean follow-up of 78 months.;Median survival was 136 months for grade A and 52 for grade B. Survival at 5, 10 and 15 was 75.5%, 51% and 22.4% for grade A vs 45.2%, 31.3% and 0% for grade B respectively. In univariate and multivariate analysis, grade A survival was associated with age at diagnosis, tumor size, large removal and response to radiotherapy. Grade B survival was associated with age at diagnosis, wide removal and sharply defined limits of the tumor on imaging.;Analysis of both published data and this series underlines many prognostic parameters. It shows that OLG are heterogeneous tumors even in each grade (A and B). Treatment should consequently progress towards more targeted procedures for patients mainly with postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy.",

Initial symptoms were caused in 10 cases by the tumour, in 8 cases by aneurysmal rupture. In 2 cases the tumour was discovered years after the exclusion of the aneurysm. The tumour was supratentorial in 14 cases, and was more commonly a meningioma (44% of cases) or glioma (38% of cases). A total of 25 aneurysms were observed in the 18 patients: 8 had ruptured and 17 were incidental. The aneurysms were more commonly on the internal carotid artery (40%). Surgical treatment was undertaken in 13 patients, and consisted of: a) tumour resection plus aneurysmal exclusion in 6 patients, b) only tumour resection in 5 patients with incidental aneurysms, and c) only exclusion of the aneurysm in 2 patients later developing malignant gliomas. Rupture of incidental aneurysms was never observed. The prognosis was linked mainly to the nature of the tumour in cases with malignant tumours, and to the evolution of subarachnoid haemorrhage in patients with ruptured aneurysms. As a whole, a satisfactory recovery was observed in 7 patients, and death occurred in 11 patients, mainly due to progressive evolution of the malignant tumour (in 6 cases) or to fatal aneurysmal rebleeding (in 3 cases). It is concluded that tumours associated with aneurysms should be operated on at the same time whenever possible, and decisions regarding exclusion of incidental aneurysms should be balanced against the risks of the procedure.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Tumours of the central nervous system are the most common solid tumour, accounting for a quarter of the 1500 cases of childhood cancer diagnosed each year in the U.K. They are the most common cause of cancer-related death in children. Treatment consists of surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Survival rates have generally increased, but many survivors suffer from radiotherapy-related neurocognitive and endocrine side effects as well as an increased risk of secondary cancer. Adjuvant chemotherapy is normally given in combination to circumvent chemoresistance, but several studies have demonstrated it to be ineffective in the absence of radiotherapy. The identification of children with drug-resistant disease at the outset could allow stratification of those that are potentially curable by chemotherapy alone. Ultimately, however, what is required is a means to overcome this drug resistance and restore the effectiveness of chemotherapy. Medulloblastomas and ependymomas account for over 30% of paediatric brain tumours. Advances in neurosurgery, adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy have led to improvements in 5-year overall survival rates. There remain, however, significant numbers of medulloblastoma patients that have intrinsically drug-resistant tumours and/or present with disseminated disease. Local relapse in ependymoma is also common and has an extremely poor prognosis with only 25% of children surviving first relapse. Each of these is consistent with the acquisition of drug and radiotherapy resistance. Since the majority of chemotherapy drugs currently used to treat these patients are transport substrates for ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1 (ABCB1) we will address the hypothesis that ABCB1 expression underlies this drug resistance.

Here, we evaluated the antitumor effects of NK cell-based immunotherapy by serial noninvasive imaging of apoptosis using a caspase-3 sensor in mice with human glioma xenografts. Human glioma cells expressing both a caspase-3 sensor as a surrogate marker for caspase-3 activation and Renilla luciferase (Rluc) as a surrogate marker for cell viability were established and referred to as D54-CR cells. Human NK92 cells were used as effector cells. Treatment with NK92 cells resulted in a time- and effector number-dependent increase in bioluminescence imaging (BLI) activity of the caspase-3 sensor in D54-CR cells in vitro. Caspase-3 activation by NK92 treatment was blocked by Z-VAD treatment in D54-CR cells. Transfusion of NK92 cells induced an increase of the BLI signal by caspase-3 activation in a dose- and time-dependent manner in D54-CR tumor-bearing mice but not in PBS-treated mice. Accordingly, sequential BLI with the Rluc reporter gene revealed marked retardation of tumor growth in the NK92-treatment group but not in the PBS-treatment group. These data suggest that noninvasive imaging of apoptosis with a caspase-3 sensor can be used as an effective tool for evaluation of therapeutic efficacy as well as for optimization of NK cell-based immunotherapy.-Lee, H.

Biochemical assays indicated that ON123300 was a strong inhibitor of Ark5 and CDK4, as well as growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases such as β-type platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFRβ). ON123300 inhibited U87 glioma cell proliferation with an IC(50) 3.4 ± 0.1 μmol/L and reduced phosphorylation of Akt, yet it also unexpectedly induced Erk activation, both in a dose- and time-dependent manner that subsequently was attributed to relieving Akt-mediated C-Raf S259 inactivation and activating a p70S6K-initiated PI3K-negative feedback loop. Cotreatment with the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib produced synergistic cytotoxic effects. Pursuant to the in vitro studies, in vivo pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies of ON123300 were completed in mice bearing intracerebral U87 tumors following intravenous doses of 5 and 25 mg/kg alone, and also at the higher dose concurrently with gefitinib. ON123300 showed high brain and brain tumor accumulation based on brain partition coefficient values of at least 2.5. Consistent with the in vitro studies, single agent ON123300 caused a dose-dependent suppression of phosphorylation of Akt as well as activation of Erk in brain tumors, whereas addition of gefitinib to the ON123300 regimen significantly enhanced p-Akt inhibition and prevented Erk activation. In summary, ON123300 demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics, and future development for brain tumor therapy would require use of combinations, such as gefitinib, that mitigate its Erk activation and enhance its activity.",

Apparently divergent results, showing excess fibrinolysis (i.e., increased plasminogen activator activity) or its inhibition (i.e., increased inhibitor activity), have been reported. The 9L rat brain tumor is a gliosarcoma and a model used to study treatment paradigms for human gliomas. To study the roles of fibrin and fibrinolysis in this brain tumor model, we used these features to investigate the nature of the plasminogen activator (PA) and thrombin inhibitors in normal rat brain and in the 9L rat brain tumor, growing both in vitro and in vivo in rat brain. The results indicate that cells cultured from the tumor in vitro express PA inhibitory activity which is both of the protease nexin I and PA inhibitor 1 types. However, the serpin PA inhibitory activity in extracts of both the normal brain and tumor is of the protease nexin I/PA inhibitor 3 type. This activity is higher in the tumor than in the surrounding \"normal\" tissue. In addition, we present evidence for a novel thrombin inhibitor which (a) is present only in the tumor growing in rat brain and undetectable either in the normal brain tissue or in vitro, (b) is in a latent, but sodium dodecyl sulfate-activatable, state, and (c) does not bind urokinase.

The lesions are typically solitary. The majority of the lesions are located in the periventricular area, whereas in a few cases they are located in the supratentorial area. Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas constitute most PCNSLs, whereas T-cell, low-grade, anaplastic, and Hodgkin lymphomas are rarely encountered. The morphology of PCNSL shows a characteristic angiocentric pattern and is positive for B-cell markers by immunohistochemistry. The differential diagnosis of PCNSL includes central nervous system gliomas, metastatic tumors, demyelinating disorders, subacute infarcts, and space-occupying lesions due to an infectious etiology. The understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of PCNSL and the identification of molecular biomarkers have lagged behind that of systemic nodal lymphomas.

Patients were assigned to classes based on the presence (Class A) or absence (Class B) of statistically significant invasion parameters to create an invasive imaging signature; imaging genomic analysis was subsequently performed using GenePattern Comparative Marker Selection module (Broad Institute).;Our results show that patients with a combination of deep white matter tracts and ependymal invasion (Class A) on imaging had a significant decrease in overall survival as compared to patients with absence of such invasive imaging features (Class B) (8.7 versus 18.6 months, p < 0.001). Mitochondrial dysfunction was the top canonical pathway associated with Class A gene expression signature. The MYC oncogene was predicted to be the top activation regulator in Class A.;We demonstrate that MRI biomarker signatures can identify distinct GBM phenotypes associated with highly significant survival differences and specific molecular pathways. This study identifies mitochondrial dysfunction as the top canonical pathway in a very aggressive GBM phenotype. Thus, imaging-genomic analyses may prove invaluable in detecting novel targetable genomic pathways.",

(b) To validate the fully automatic CT/MET-PET image fusion technique with respect to accuracy and robustness. (c) To give a short glance at the clinical consequences for patients with brain tumors.;In 12 patients with brain tumors (9 meningeomas, 3 gliomas), CT, MRI, and MET-PET were performed for stereotactic fractionated radiation treatment planning. The CT and MET-PET investigations were performed using a relocatable mask for head fixation. Fifteen external reference markers (5 on each lateral and 5 on the frontal localizer plate) that could be identified in CT and MET-PET were applied on the stereotactic localizer frame; the marker positions were exactly defined for both investigations. The MRI/CT fusion was done completely automatically. The CT/MET-PET fusion was performed using two different methods: The gold standard was the CT/PET fusion based on the reference markers, and the test method was the automatic, intensity-based CT/PET fusion, independent of the external markers. The markers visible on CT and transmission PET were matched using a point-to-line matching algorithm. To quantify the amount of misregistration, the two fusion methods were compared by calculating the mean value of deviation between corresponding points inside a cubic volume of interest of > or =512 cm(3) defined within the cranial cavity. The gross tumor volume (CT/MRI) outlined on CT and T1-MRI with contrast medium was compared with the gross tumor volume (PET) defined in the reoriented MET-PET data sets. The clinical impact of MET-PET in tumor volume definition for stereotactic radiotherapy will be discussed.;The fully automatic integration of MET-PET into stereotactic radiation treatment planning was successfully realized in all patients investigated. Mean deviation of the intensity-based automatic CT/PET fusion compared with the external marker-based gold standard was 2.4 mm; the standard deviation was 0.5. The algorithm's robustness was evaluated, and the discrepancy of fusion results due to different initial image alignments was determined to be below 1 mm inside the test volume of interest. In patients with meningiomas and gliomas, MET-PET was shown to deliver additional information concerning tumor extension.;The precision of the automatic CT/PET image fusion was high. A mean deviation of 2.4 mm is acceptable, considering that it is approximately equal to the pixel size of the PET data sets.

We studied the effects of estradiol, progesterone and their receptor antagonists (ICI 182,780 and RU 486) on PR isoforms content in U373 and D54 human astrocytoma cell lines, respectively derived from grades III and IV astrocytomas, by Western blot analysis.

We observed that in U373 cells estradiol increased the content of both PR isoforms whereas in D54 cells it had no effects. Estradiol effects were blocked by ICI 182,780. In both cell lines, PR isoforms content was down-regulated by progesterone after estradiol treatment. This effect was blocked by RU 486. We observed that overexpression of PR-A significantly diminished the increase in U373 cells number produced after progesterone treatment.

The cell number versus time data were fitted mathematically to the two-term exponential model. Parameters b and d were independent of the drug concentration, while a increased c decreased as the drug dose increased. The concentration independence of b and d indicated that both cell proliferation and cell death kinetics were independent of the drug treatment, which suggests constant times for cell cycle and apoptosis. The concentration dependence of c suggests that the time until the cells started regrowing depended on the treatment, repair mechanisms taking longer after heavy damage. The two-term exponential model predicted tumor repopulation in this in vitro system. These results indicated that the velocities of the logarithm of cell growth and cell death were independent of drug treatment, while the recovery time of the tumor repopulation was dependent on the drug dose.

To examine the structures of these mRNAs, we isolated cDNA clones from rat brain and genomic DNA from rat liver. Characterization of these clones as well as Northern blot analysis indicated that the various mRNAs differed in the lengths of their 5' leader sequences. RNase protection assays revealed that the gene for alpha-crystallin B chain contains multiple start sites. The transcriptional start sites of the longer mRNAs are preceded by a putative CAAT box and that of the shorter mRNA by a putative TATA box. The shorter mRNA encodes the alpha-crystallin B chain protein, whereas the longer mRNA contained three extra small open reading frames upstream of the AUG start codon for the protein. The shorter mRNA is abundant in lens, heart, muscle, and kidney, while the longer mRNAs are constitutively expressed at low levels in a wide variety of tissues. The shorter mRNA was increased by treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in rat C6 glioma cells.

Although a viral cause has been suggested in some cases, the exact cause of the disease is still under investigation. Primary CNS lymphoma has a distinct affinity for perivascular extension. Although granular nodules may be seen at gross pathologic inspection, diffuse microscopic spread is always present, which accounts for the ability of this tumor to produce distant disease and local recurrences. The dense cellularity of the tumor and its predilection for the periventricular region also explains its typical hyperattenuated appearance on unenhanced computed tomographic scans and hypointensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images.

Cell death caused by PDT (through the generation of reactive oxygen species) can occur either by apoptosis (interphase death or as a secondary event following mitosis) and/or necrosis depending on the cell type, concentration and intracellular localization of the sensitizer, and the light dose. Since, apoptosis induced by PDT treatment plays an important role in determining the photodynamic efficacy, in the present work we have investigated the role of apoptotic cell death in relation to the observed differences in sensitivity to HpD-PDT between a human glioma cell line (BMG-1) carrying wild-type tumour suppressor gene p53 and a human squamous carcinoma cell line (4451) with mutated p53. HpD (photosan-3; PS-3) -PDT induced apoptosis was studied by: [A] flow-cytometric analysis of DNA content (sub G0/G1 population); [B] phosphatidylserine externalization (Annexin-V +ve cells); [C] cell size and cytoskeleton reorganization (light-scatter analysis); and [D] fluorescence microscopy (morphological features). PS-3-PDT induced a significantly higher level of apoptosis in BMG-1 cells as compared to 4451 cells. This was dependent on the concentration of PS-3 as well as post-irradiation time in both the cell lines. At 2.5 microg/ml of PS-3 the fraction of BMG-1 cells undergoing apoptosis (60%) was nearly 6 folds higher than 4451 cells (10%). In BMG-1 cells the induction of apoptosis increased with PS-3 concentration up to 5 microg/ml (>80%). However, a decrease was observed at a concentration of 10 microg/ml, possibly due to a shift in the mode of cell death from apoptosis to necrosis. In 4451 cells, on the other hand, the increase in apoptosis could be observed even up to 10 microg/ml of PS-3 (60%). Present results show that the higher sensitivity to PS-3-PDT in glioma cells arise on account of a higher level of apoptosis and suggest that induction of apoptosis is an important determinant of photodynamic sensitivity in certain cell types.",

This was confirmed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, immunoprecipitation, and western blot analysis with antiferritin antibody. In addition, hypoxia was able to induce the synthesis of ferritin in a cell line derived from human oligodendroglioma cells but not in astrocytes or neurons. Actinomycin D (1-15 micrograms/ml) treatment did not block the hypoxic induction of ferritin synthesis, whereas cycloheximide (1 microM) gave complete inhibition.

To find out the new treatment modality for drug-resistant GB and MCL cells, combining of bradykinin (BK) antagonists with conventional temozolomide (TMZ) treatment, and screening of thiazolidinones derivatives were the main objectives of this work. As it was revealed here, BKM-570 was the lead compound among BK antagonists under investigation (IC50 was 3.3 μM) in human GB cells. It strongly suppressed extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) and protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation. BK antagonists did not decrease the viability of MCL cells, thus showing the cell-specific mode, while thiazolidinone derivatives, a novel group of promising anti-tumour compounds inhibited proliferation of MCL cells: IC₅₀ of ID 4526 and ID 4527 compounds were 0.27 μM and 0.16 μM, correspondingly. However, single agents are often not effective in clinic due to activation of collateral pathways in tumour cells. We demonstrated a strong synergistic effect after combinatorial treatment by BKM-570 together with TMZ that drastically increased cytotoxic action of this drug in rat and human glioma cells. Small proportion of cells was still viable after such treatment that could be explained by presence of TMZ-resistant cells in the population.

We previously showed that methylxanthines, including caffeine and theophylline, have antitumor and antiinflammatory effects, which are in part mediated by their inhibition of phosphodiesterase (PDE). A member of the PDE family, PDE4, is widely expressed in and promotes the growth of glioblastoma, the most common type of brain tumor. The purpose of this study was to determine whether theobromine could exert growth inhibitory effects on U87-MG, a cell line derived from human malignant glioma. We show that theobromine treatment elevates intracellular cAMP levels and increases the activity of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, whereas it attenuates p44/42 extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity and the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin kinase and nuclear factor-kappa B signal pathways. It also inhibits cell proliferation.

However, (157)Gd offers several advantages over boron, such as higher cross section for thermal neutrons and the possibility to perform magnetic resonance imaging during neutron irradiation, thereby combining therapy and diagnostics. We have developed different liposomal formulations of gadolinium-DTPA (Magnevist®) for application in neutron capture therapy of glioblastoma. The formulations were characterized physicochemically and tested in vitro in a glioma cell model for their effectiveness.;Liposomes entrapping gadolinium-DTPA as neutron capture agent were manufactured via lipid/film-extrusion method and characterized with regard to size, entrapment efficiency and in vitro release. For neutron irradiation, F98 and LN229 glioma cells were incubated with the newly developed liposomes and subsequently irradiated at the thermal column of the TRIGA reactor in Mainz. The dose rate derived from neutron irradiation with (157)Gd as neutron capturing agent was calculated via Monte Carlo simulations and set in relation to the respective cell survival.;The liposomal Gd-DTPA reduced cell survival of F98 and LN229 cells significantly. Differences in liposomal composition of the formulations led to distinctly different outcome in cell survival. The amount of cellular Gd was not at all times proportional to cell survival, indicating that intracellular deposition of formulated Gd has a major influence on cell survival. The majority of the dose contribution arises from photon cross irradiation compared to a very small Gd-related dose.;Liposomal gadolinium formulations represent a promising approach for neutron capture therapy of glioblastoma cells. The liposome composition determines the uptake and the survival of cells following radiation, presumably due to different uptake pathways of liposomes and intracellular deposition of gadolinium-DTPA. Due to the small range of the Auger and conversion electrons produced in (157)Gd capture, the proximity of Gd-atoms to cellular DNA is a crucial factor for infliction of lethal damage. Furthermore, Gd-containing liposomes may be used as MRI contrast agents for diagnostic purposes and surveillance of tumor targeting, thus enabling a theranostic approach for tumor therapy.",

Both PMC and PKC are differentially regulated during T-cell development. The level of PMC expression is highest in CD4-8-, intermediate in CD4+8+, and lowest in J11d-, CD4, or CD8 single-positive thymocytes. PKC is equally expressed by all three thymic populations. In striking contrast to thymocytes, resting peripheral lymph node T cells and T-cell clones express little if any PMC and reduced levels of PKC. Neither PKC nor PMC is significantly induced upon the activation of lymph node T cells: treatment with anti-CD3 antibodies or anti-CD3 and interleukin-2 fails to induce PKC, whereas PMC is not induced by anti-CD3 alone and is only slightly induced by anti-CD3 and interleukin-2. In contrast to the situation with T cells, PMC and PKC are constitutively expressed at moderate levels in mature B cells. PMC is greatly increased in B-cell blasts generated by cross-linking the antigen receptor with anti-immunoglobulin. These results demonstrate that PMC and PKC are differentially regulated during the development and activation of B and T cells, suggesting that cellular events that rely upon PKC and PMC may differ during ontogeny and activation of different lymphocyte subsets.",

Group A received 5% epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA); Group B received 2.5% EACA; and Group C served as a control. There was no statistical difference among the three groups with regard to: 1) age at time of tumor transplantation; 2) the interval between implant and treatment; or 3) tumor volume at time of treatment. Blood measurements of EACA, performed in a limited number of animals, have shown that the drug at 5% concentration had reached toxic levels. Statistically significant differences between the three groups were noted in the following categories: 1) rate of tumor growth; 2) tumor volume at time of death, where Group A had smaller tumors than Group C; and 3) mean survival times of Groups A and B as compared to Group C.

        "Doc_abstract":"BACKGROUND: Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) have been proposed as a new therapy for patients with cancer, including malignant brain tumors. Antisense ODNs are taken up by tumor cells and selectively block gene expression. Use of ODNs for brain tumors is attractive due to their theoretical specificity, relative ease of production and, to date, paucity of reported adverse effects. This article presents current information regarding antisense ODNs and their possible future use for the treatment of brain tumors. METHODS: The available published experimental and clinical information regarding antisense ODN treatment of glioblastoma cells and administration into the central nervous system (CNS) was reviewed. Other clinically relevant information pertaining to the molecular biology of antisense ODNs was also collected and summarized. RESULTS: Targets for antisense ODN therapy in malignant glioma cells have included c-myc, c-myb, c-sis, c-erb B, CD44, p34cdc2, bFGF, PDGF, TGF-beta, IGF-1, PKC-alpha tumor necrosis factor, urokinase, and S100beta protein. Few in vivo studies of ODN treatment of brain tumors have yet been reported. Systemically administered ODNs enter the brain only in extremely small quantities; therefore, microinfusion into the brain has been recommended. CONCLUSIONS: Antisense ODNs have been used successfully to block glioblastoma gene expression in vitro and expression of multiple genes within the CNS of experimental animals. Upcoming clinical trials will address the safety of antisense ODN use against malignant brain tumors.",

The effect of guggulipid and nimesulide on LPS-induced neuroinflammatory changes is also not properly understood. This work demonstrated the mechanism of actions of guggulipid and nimesulide on inflammatory genes expressions in LPS-stimulated rat astrocytoma cells, C6. We observed that LPS (10 μg/ml) treatment of rat astrocytoma cells, C6, for 24 h significantly increased intracellular Ca(2+) ion and expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB), C/EBP homologous protein 10 (CHOP), c-fos, and c-jun proteins. At transcriptional stage, LPS upregulated mRNA levels of cyclooxygenase-2 and IL-6 with downregulation in IL-1α, IL-1β, and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) through activating NF-kB translocation. Treatment with guggulipid reversed these LPS-induced changes in rat astrocytoma cells. Treatment with nimesulide also attenuated LPS-induced Ca(2+) ion, iNOS, NF-kB, and c-fos expressions, but does not significantly influence CHOP, c-jun protein expressions, and mRNA levels of IL-6, IL-1α, IL-1β, and mPGES-1 genes. In conclusion, our findings elucidated the molecular mechanism of neuroinflammation in response to LPS and its modulation by guggulipid and nimesulide in rat astrocytoma cells (C6), which suggest the use of these drugs in the treatment of neuroinflammation-associated disorders.",

Several works have reported the therapeutic interest of the radiotherapy modality at preclinical level, but biological mechanisms responsible for the described efficacy are not fully understood to date. The aim of this study was to identify the early transcriptomic responses of normal brain and glioma tissue in rats after MRT irradiation (400Gy). The transcriptomic analysis of similarly irradiated normal brain and tumor tissues was performed 6 hours after irradiation of 9 L orthotopically tumor-bearing rats. Pangenomic analysis revealed 1012 overexpressed and 497 repressed genes in the irradiated contralateral normal tissue and 344 induced and 210 repressed genes in tumor tissue. These genes were grouped in a total of 135 canonical pathways. More than half were common to both tissues with a predominance for immunity or inflammation (64 and 67% of genes for normal and tumor tissues, respectively). Several pathways involving HMGB1, toll-like receptors, C-type lectins and CD36 may serve as a link between biochemical changes triggered by irradiation and inflammation and immunological challenge. Most immune cell populations were involved: macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer, T and B lymphocytes. Among them, our results highlighted the involvement of Th17 cell population, recently described in tumor. The immune response was regulated by a large network of mediators comprising growth factors, cytokines, lymphokines. In conclusion, early response to MRT is mainly based on inflammation and immunity which appear therefore as major contributors to MRT efficacy. ",

Maximum follow-up included six examinations per patient by either method during 18 months. Criteria were set for: (1) regression (> or = 25% tumor reduction), (2) status quo (< 25% reduction and < 25% increase), and (3) progression of disease (> or = 25% tumor increase). Results were compared with the clinical state of disease. Changes of tumor volume, contrast enhancement, necrosis, hemorrhage and edema on MRI were compared to changes in 201thallium uptake volumes and 1H-MRS metabolite ratios.;Six patients were followed with a total of twenty-four examinations with 201thallium SPECT, MRI and 1H-MRS, respectively, between February 1997 and October 1998. Five patients developed clinical progression of disease, 4 out of 5 cases showed SPECT progression, 4 out of 5 cases MRI progression, and 1 out of 2 interpretable cases 1H-MRS progression at final assessment before clinical deterioration. During the phase of clinically stable disease; (A) the criterion for regression or status quo was met in 10 out of 13 assessments with SPECT, 11 out of 13 with MRI, and 8 out of 9 interpretable 1H-MRS; (B) the criterion for progression was met in 3 out of 13 with SPECT, 2 out of 13 with MRI, and 1 out of 9 interpretable 1H-MRS. The accuracy of SPECT, MRI, and 1H-MRS in identifying changes of tumor burden concordant with patients' clinical course was 78%, 83%, and 82%, respectively. SPECT regression was associated with MRI decrease of tumor size, contrast enhancement, edema and hemorrhage. SPECT progression was associated with MRI increase of the same parameters and the increase of necrosis. 1H-MRS regression was associated with decrease of edema. 1H-MRS progression was associated with increase of tumor size, hemorrhage, and increase or decrease of contrast enhancement.;Both 201thallium SPECT and 1H-MRS evaluation showed sensitivity for detection of astrocytoma progression. We did not find a higher accuracy of SPECT or MRS than of MRI in astrocytoma chemotherapy monitoring. Treatment induced MRI changes were associated with 201thallium uptake variations. 1H-MRS was difficult to apply for astrocytoma treatment monitoring. Improvements regarding size of measurement area such as multivoxel MRS and fat suppression pulses appeared desirable, and also the use of functional techniques with superior resolution such as dual isotope SPECT. However, our results suggest that 201thallium SPECT and 1H-MRS can provide additional information to MRI for chemotherapy efficacy evaluation in selected cases.",

The median survival after operation for the 1561 patients was 6 months, and only 7.5% lived 2 years.

ER subtypes have been identified in human astrocytomas, the most common and aggressive primary brain tumors. We studied the role of ER subtypes in cell growth of two human astrocytoma cell lines derived from tumors of different evolution grades: U373 and D54 (grades III and IV, respectively). E2 significantly increased the number of cells in both lines and the co-administration with an ER antagonist (ICI 182, 780) significantly blocked E2 effects. ERα was the predominant subtype in both cell lines. E2 and ICI 182, 780 down-regulated ERα expression. The number of U373 and D54 cells significantly increased after PPT (ERα agonist) treatment but not after DPN (ERβ agonist) one. To determine the role of SRC-1 and SRC-3 coactivators in ERα induced cell growth, we silenced them with RNA interference. Coactivator silencing blocked the increase in cell number induced by PPT. The content of proteins involved in proliferation and metastasis was also determined after PPT treatment. Western blot analysis showed that in U373 cells the content of PR isoforms (PR-A and PR-B), EGFR, VEGF and cyclin D1 increased after PPT treatment while in D54 cells only the content of EGFR was increased.

        "Doc_abstract":"We report a rare case of a dura-based intracranial schwannoma in the temporal fossa. A 77-year-old man admitted to our hospital with a 5 months history of mild recent memory disturbance. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a slight enhanced solid mass with a cystic mass in the right temporal lobe. Preoperative diagnosis was glioma and then total resection was performed by the transsylvian approach. Dense adhesion of the tumor to dura matter of the middle cranial fossa was confirmed during surgery. Microscopic examination of the tumor showed biphasic pattern with cellular Antoni A and hypocellular Antoni B areas. Immunohistochemically, the tumor was positive for S-100, vimentin and Schwann/2E and was negative for GFAP. From these findings, the tumor was diagnosed as a schwannoma arising from the dura matter of the middle fossa. The patient was discharged from our hospital with no neurological deficits. Intracranial schwannomas, which are not associated with cranial nerves, are rare. Our case was classified according to the origin into dura-based intracranial schwannoma. To our knowledge, only 14 cases of dura-based intracranial schwannoma have been reported, mostly in children and young adults. This represents the oldest case in the literature of dura-based intracranial schwannoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors display extensive histomorphological heterogeneity, with great variability in the extent of invasiveness, angiogenesis, and necrosis. The identification of genes associated with these phenotypes should further the molecular characterization, permitting better definition of glioma subsets that may ultimately lead to better treatment strategies. Therefore, we performed a differential mRNA display analysis comparing six GBM-derived primary cell cultures from patients having tumors with varied histomorphological features. We identified stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1) as a gene with varied expression. SDF1 (cytokine) and CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) interactions are implicated in modulating cell migration. They are also implicated in modulating the immune response in AIDS patients by macrophage-mediated T-cell apoptosis. GBM patients also fail to mount an immune response, although their tumors are seemingly exposed to immune cells in regions of angiogenesis, where the blood-brain barrier is absent, or in areas of necrosis. To determine whether the expression and localization of SDF1 and CXCR4 are consistent with such a role in these brain tumors, immunohistochemical analyses of these proteins were performed on normal brain and astrocytomas (grades II-IV). In normal brain tissue, low levels of SDF1 (0.5+) were observed in astrocytic processes, in neurons, and in the occasional phagocytic cells around vessels. CXCR4 expression was negative in brain tissue but was observed in phagocytic cells within the vessel lumen. In tumors, SDF1 and CXCR4 expression was colocalized when both were expressed, and SDF1 and CXCR4 expression increased with increasing tumor grade (from 0.5+ to 6+). Additionally, CXCR4 was expressed in neovessel endothelial cells. The proteins were expressed in regions of angiogenesis and degenerative, necrotic, and microcystic changes. Those tumors displaying greater amounts of these features had greater staining intensity of the proteins. The expression of SDF1 and CXCR4 did not colocalize with the proliferation marker MIB-1. Thus, our data suggest that SDF1 and CXCR4 expressions: (a) increase with increasing grade; (b) colocalize to regions within these tumors where their interaction may contribute to angiogenesis and/or modulation of the immune response; and (c) may serve to characterize subsets of GBMs.",

However, to trigger effector function, tumor antigen must be re-presented to T cells, via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins, at the tumor site. In normal brain, MHC+ antigen-presenting cells (APC) are rare, but abundant after gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) injection. Here we studied tumor-bearing brains. IFN-gamma (or buffer) was injected stereotactically into brains with established tumors from a panel of immunologically varied glioma cell lines, some expressing b-galactosidase as a micro-tumor marker. Four days later, cryostat sections were stained for tumor and MHC proteins. In phosphate-buffered saline-injected controls, class II MHC+ potential APC (microglia, macrophages) were seen only at (some) tumor sites. In rats that received IFN-gamma, class II+ potential APC were widespread, including all actual and potential micro-tumor sites and all tumor-free areas. In the same slides, neither class I nor class II MHC antigen was detected in neural cells or most tumor cells. This MHC pattern favors indirect re-presentation of tumor antigen, by tumor-adjacent APC. The robust response to IFN-gamma might also be exploited in other ways: activated microglia and macrophages can attack tumor directly, and class II+ APC may help mark micro-tumor sites.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Radiation-induced necrosis (RN) is a relatively common side effect of radiation therapy for glioblastoma. However, the molecular mechanisms involved and the ways RN mechanisms differ from regulated cell death (apoptosis) are not well understood. Here, we compare the molecular mechanism of cell death (apoptosis or necrosis) of C6 glioma cells in both in vitro and in vivo (C6 othotopically allograft) models in response to low and high doses of X-ray radiation. Lower radiation doses were used to induce apoptosis, while high-dose levels were chosen to induce radiation necrosis. Our results demonstrate that active caspase-8 in this complex I induces apoptosis in response to low-dose radiation and inhibits necrosis by cleaving RIP1 and RI. When activation of caspase-8 was reduced at high doses of X-ray radiation, the RIP1/RIP3 necrosome complex II is formed. These complexes induce necrosis through the caspase-3-independent pathway mediated by calpain, cathepsin B/D, and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). AIF has a dual role in apoptosis and necrosis. At high doses, AIF promotes chromatinolysis and necrosis by interacting with histone H2AX. In addition, NF-κB, STAT-3, and HIF-1 play a crucial role in radiation-induced inflammatory responses embedded in a complex inflammatory network. Analysis of inflammatory markers in matched plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) isolated from in vivo specimens demonstrated the upregulation of chemokines and cytokines during the necrosis phase. Using RIP1/RIP3 kinase specific inhibitors (Nec-1, GSK'872), we also establish that the RIP1-RIP3 complex regulates programmed necrosis after either high-dose radiation or TNF-α-induced necrosis requires RIP1 and RIP3 kinases. Overall, our data shed new light on the relationship between RIP1/RIP3-mediated programmed necrosis and AIF-mediated caspase-independent programmed necrosis in glioblastoma. ",

Sunitinib has not shown significant activity in GBM clinical trials, despite positive results seen in preclinical xenograft studies. We performed in vivo studies in transgenic Friend leukemia virus strain B mice: wild-type, Mdr1a/b(-/-), Bcrp1(-/-), and Mdr1a/b(-/-)Bcrp1(-/-) genotypes were examined. The brain-to-plasma area under the curve ratio after an oral dose (20 mg/kg) was similar to the steady-state tissue distribution coefficient, indicating linear distribution kinetics in mice over this concentration range. Furthermore, the distribution of sunitinib to the brain increased after administration of selective P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp) pharmacological inhibitors and a dual inhibitor, elacridar, comparable to that of the corresponding transgenic genotype. The brain-to-plasma ratio after coadministration of elacridar in wild-type mice was ≈ 12 compared with ≈ 17.3 in Mdr1a/b(-/-)Bcrp1(-/-) mice. Overall, these findings indicate that there is a cooperation at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in restricting the brain penetration of sunitinib, and brain delivery can be enhanced by administration of a dual inhibitor. These data indicate that the presence of cooperative efflux transporters, P-gp and Bcrp, in an intact BBB can protect invasive glioma cells from chemotherapy.

We tested this using a specific inhibitor of NFkappaB activation, the NEMO binding domain (NBD) peptide, that has been shown previously to be effective in various in vivo models of acute inflammation. Incubation of rat glioma cells with the NBD peptide blocked IL-1beta-induced NFkappaB nuclear translocation. Furthermore, after injection of a biotinylated version of the NBD peptide into the lateral ventricle of the brain, we found that it readily diffused to its potential cellular targets in vivo. To test the effects of the peptide on NFkappaB activation and Cox-2 expression in the brain, we injected it intracerebroventricularly (36 microg/rat) into rats before intraperitoneal injection of IL-1beta (60 microg/kg). Treatment with NBD peptide completely abolished IL-1beta-induced NFkappaB activation and Cox-2 synthesis in microvasculature. In contrast, the peptide had no effect on constitutive neuronal Cox-2.

Glioblastoma cells overexpressing or underexpressing cyclin D1 were then examined by in vitro growth assays, apoptosis assays, cell cycle analysis, and invasion assays. Cyclin D1 knockdown in SHG-44 cells inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and attenuated migration across Matrigel, a model of invasive capacity.

Herein, we assessed new strategies to optimize Flt3L/TK therapeutic efficacy in a refractory RG2 orthotopic glioblastoma model. Specifically, we aimed to optimize the therapeutic efficacy of Flt3L/TK treatment in the RG2 model by overexpressing the following genes within the brain tumor microenvironment: 1) a TK mutant with enhanced cytotoxicity (SR39 mutant TK), 2) Flt3L-IgG fusion protein that has a longer half-life, 3) CD40L to stimulate DC maturation, 4) T helper cell type 1 polarizing dendritic cell cytokines interleukin-12 or C-X-C motif ligand 10 chemokine (CXCL)-10, 5) C-C motif ligand 2 chemokine (CCL2) or C-C motif ligand 3 chemokine (CCL3) to enhance dendritic cell recruitment into the tumor microenvironment, 6) T helper cell type 1 cytokines interferon-γ or interleukin-2 to enhance effector T-cell functions, and 7) IκBα or p65RHD (nuclear factor kappa-B [NF-κB] inhibitors) to suppress the function of Foxp3+ Tregs and enhanced effector T-cell functions. Anti-tumor immunity and tumor specific effector T-cell functions were assessed by cytotoxic T lymphocyte assay and intracellular IFN-γ staining. Our data showed that overexpression of interferon-γ or interleukin-2, or inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa-B within the tumor microenvironment, enhanced cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated immune responses and successfully extended the median survival of rats bearing intracranial RG2 when combined with Flt3L/TK. These findings indicate that enhancement of T-cell functions constitutes a critical therapeutic target to overcome immune evasion and enhance therapeutic efficacy for brain cancer. In addition, our study provides novel targets to be used in combination with immune-therapeutic strategies for glioblastoma, which are currently being tested in the clinic.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Medulloblastoma is a highly malignant pediatric brain tumor that requires surgery, whole brain and spine irradiation, and intense chemotherapy for treatment. A more sophisticated understanding of the pathophysiology of medulloblastoma is needed to successfully reduce the intensity of treatment and improve outcomes. Nuclear factor kappa-B (NFκB) is a signaling pathway that controls transcriptional activation of genes important for tight regulation of many cellular processes and is aberrantly expressed in many types of cancer.;To test the importance of NFκB to medulloblastoma cell growth, the effects of multiple drugs that inhibit NFκB, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, diethyldithiocarbamate, sulfasalazine, curcumin and bortezomib, were studied in medulloblastoma cell lines compared to a malignant glioma cell line and normal neurons. Expression of endogenous NFκB was investigated in cultured cells, xenograft flank tumors, and primary human tumor samples. A dominant negative construct for the endogenous inhibitor of NFκB, IκB, was prepared from medulloblastoma cell lines and flank tumors were established to allow specific pathway inhibition.;We report high constitutive activity of the canonical NFκB pathway, as seen by Western analysis of the NFκB subunit p65, in medulloblastoma tumors compared to normal brain. The p65 subunit of NFκB is extremely highly expressed in xenograft tumors from human medulloblastoma cell lines; though, conversely, the same cells in culture have minimal expression without specific stimulation. We demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of NFκB in cell lines halts proliferation and leads to apoptosis. We show by immunohistochemical stain that phosphorylated p65 is found in the majority of primary tumor cells examined. Finally, expression of a dominant negative form of the endogenous inhibitor of NFκB, dnIκB, resulted in poor xenograft tumor growth, with average tumor volumes 40% smaller than controls.;These data collectively demonstrate that NFκB signaling is important for medulloblastoma tumor growth, and that inhibition can reduce tumor size and viability in vivo. We discuss the implications of NFκB signaling on the approach to managing patients with medulloblastoma in order to improve clinical outcomes.",

Conventional image analysis systems are relatively expensive. We therefore compared the performance of a professional image analysis system with an inexpensive setup by evaluating tumor size in an orthotopic glioma mouse model. The maximum cross-sectional tumor area of H&E stained brain-slides of two groups of mice (treatment and control group) was measured by two independent investigators using a professional image analysis system (Leica DM IRB microscope) with the Leica Quantimet 500c software, and a low-cost-system (Intel QX3 microscope) with a non-commercial image analysis software. Mean tumor volumes were calculated and the results from each of the image analysis systems, investigators, and treatment effects were compared. The tumor volumes as measured with the low-cost and the professional system differed between -3.7 and +7.5% (P = 0.69-0.99). Measurements made by investigator A and B differed between -7.0 and +3.9% (P = 0.69-0.88). Treatment in all cases significantly reduced the tumor volume between 58.4 and 62.7% (P = 0.0002 or 0.0003), regardless of the investigator or the used image analysis system. We therefore conclude that the QX3 low-cost microscope in combination with a non-commercial image-analysis software represents an inexpensive solution to reliably analyze the size of regions of interest, if they provide a sufficient contrast. However, the low-cost setup due to its low resolution definitely limits a detailed analysis of histologic features.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Intraoperative detection of residual tumor remains an important challenge in surgery to treat gliomas. New developments in optical techniques offer non-invasive high-resolution imaging that may integrate well into the workflow of neurosurgical operations. Using an intracranial glioma model, we have recently shown that time domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) allows discrimination of normal brain, diffusely invaded brain tissue, and solid tumor. OCT imaging allowed acquisition of 2D and 3D data arrays for multiplanar analysis of the tumor to brain interface. In this study we have analyzed biopsy specimens of human brain tumors and we present the first feasibility study of intraoperative OCT and post-image acquisition processing for non-invasive imaging of the brain and brain tumor.;We used a Sirius 713 Tomograph with a superluminescence diode emitting light at a near infrared central wavelength of 1,310 nm and a coherence length of 15 microm. The light is passed through an optical mono mode fiber to a modified OCT adapter containing a lens system with a working distance of 10 cm and an integrated pilot laser. Navigation-registered tumor biopsies were imaged ex vivo and the intraoperative site of optical tissue analysis was registered by marker acquisition using a neuronavigation system.;Optical coherence tomography non-contact measurements of brain and brain tumor tissue produced B-scan images of 4 mm in width and 1.5-2.0 mm in depth at an axial and lateral optical resolution of 15 microm. OCT imaging demonstrated a different microstructure and characteristic signal attenuation profiles of tumor versus normal brain. Post-image acquisition processing and automated detection of the tissue to air interface was used to realign A-scans to compensate for image distortions caused by pulse- and respiration-induced movements of the target volume. Realigned images allowed monitoring of intensity changes within the scan line and facilitated selection of areas for the averaging of A-scans and the calculation of attenuation coefficients for specific regions of interest.;This feasibility study has demonstrated that OCT analysis of the tissue microstructure and light attenuation characteristics discriminate normal brain, areas of tumor infiltrated brain, solid tumor, and necrosis. The working distance of the OCT adapter and the A-scan acquisition rate conceptually allows integration of the OCT applicator into the optical path of the operating microscopes. This would allow a continuous analysis of the resection plain, providing optical tomography, thereby adding a third dimension to the microscopic view and information on the light attenuation characteristics of the tissue.",

        "Doc_abstract":"A synthetic analog of a hemoregulatory peptide associated with mature human granulocytes (HP5b) has been investigated for inhibitory effects on various cell types in culture as compared to inhibitory action on mouse and human myelopoietic colonies (CFU-gm), which occurs from 1 X 10(-13) to 1 X 10(-6) M in vitro. This includes colony formation by lymphoid T and B cells in capillary cultures, as well as mitogen activation of T, B and NK cells. At higher concentrations, i.e., above 1 X 10(-7) M, an inhibitory effect was found on colony formation. Neither the production of interleukin (IL) 3 by mitogen-activated T cells, nor the proliferation of the IL-3-dependent L/B cell line were affected by the peptide up to 1 X 10(-5) M. A slight inhibitory effect was found above 1 X 10(-9) M on mouse 3T3 fibroblasts. A series of malignant cell lines was also tested. No effect was seen between 1 X 10(-11) and 1 X 10(-7) M on human mammary carcinoma cells in culture. On Ehrlich ascites mouse mammary carcinoma cells a 30% inhibition was seen at 10(-6) M. On a human glioblastoma cell line (GaMg) no effect was seen, and on a rat glioma cell line (BT5C) an inhibitory effect was seen at 1 X 10(-7) M and above. No significant inhibition of cell growth was seen on SC1 mouse lymphoma cells from 1 X 10(-9) to 1 X 10(-5) M during 7 days of culture. The investigated normal and malignant cell types in culture were thus not inhibited in very low concentrations which act on CFU-gm. However, a variable inhibitory effect was found at higher concentrations where the inhibition of myelopoiesis was maximal and at concentrations where the inhibition is released. The hemoregulatory peptide thus seems to be a concentration-dependent selective inhibitor of myelopoiesis. The finding that various malignant cells do not respond at lower concentrations supports the possibility of using the peptide as a protector of normal cells during cancer chemotherapy.",

Predicting the ligand selectivity of the cannabinoid CB(1) and CB(2) receptors in the absence of generally accepted models for their structures requires a ligand-based approach, which makes such studies ideally suited for quantum-chemical treatments. We present a QSAR model for ligand-receptor interactions based on quantum-chemical descriptors (an eQSAR) obtained from PM3 semi-empirical calculations for a series of phenyl-substituted cannabinoids based on a ligand with known in vivo activity against glioma [Duntsch, C.; Divi, M.

A good model for CB(2) inhibition (R(2)=0.78) has been developed requiring only four explanatory variables derived from semi-empirical results. The role of the ligand dipole moment is discussed and we propose that the CB(2) binding pocket likely possesses a significant electric field.

Previous reports have depicted morphological variations in the nature of stimulated neurites resulting from different neuritogenic agents, and a recent study by this laboratory demonstrated that such stimulants could be divided into two categories: those which induce axon-like neurites (group I) as opposed to those that stimulate dendrite-like outgrowths (group II). The former includes KCl, ionomycin, neuraminidase, and cholera toxin B subunit (all agents which elevate intracellular Ca2+), while the latter group is comprised of retinoic acid, dibutyryl cAMP, exogenous GM1, and low serum treatment. The present study was undertaken to determine whether differences in neuritic phenotype could be correlated with upregulation of nuclear GM1. The neuroblastoma x glioma NG108-15 cell line was employed because of its ability to respond robustly to a variety of neuritogenic stimuli. It was found that although both groups of stimulants are capable of inducing stable neurites (terminal differentiation) in this cell line, nuclear GM1 is elevated only in the presence of group I stimulants. Thus, a correlation is indicated between axonogenesis and upregulation of GM1 in the nuclear envelope. Additionally, these two events appear to coincide with elevation of intracellular Ca2+. Conversion of cells to the differentiated phenotype, with or without nuclear GM1 elevation, was found to depend in some cases on concentration of stimulant and duration of treatment.",

Chemotherapy has been observed to prolong overall survival rate and temozolomide (TMZ), a promising chemotherapeutic agent for treating glioblastoma (GBM), possesses the most effective clinical activity at present, although drug resistance limits its clinical outcome. Growing evidence supports the concept that initial and recurrent GBM may derive from glioblastoma stem cells, which may be responsible for drug resistance. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this resistance remain to be elucidated. In the present study, a TMZ‑resistant GBM cell line, U251R, was developed and subsequently divided into two subpopulations according to the CD133 immunophenotype. No significant difference was identified in the expression of O6‑methylguanine‑DNA‑methyltransferase (MGMT) between CD133+ U251R cells and CD133‑ U251R cells, whereas the CD133+ cell population was more resistant to TMZ‑induced growth inhibition and cell death. TMZ achieves its cytotoxic effect by inducing DNA lesions and p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) is an essential mediator of DNA damage‑induced apoptosis independently of p53 status. Therefore, whether PUMA effectively enhances growth suppression and induces apoptosis when combined with TMZ was investigated. Consequently, it was found that adenoviruses expressing wild‑type‑PUMA not only lead to the apoptosis of CD133+ U251R cells alone, but also significantly increase their sensitivity toward TMZ by elevating the Bcl‑2‑associated X protein/B‑cell lymphoma‑2 ratio without alterations in MGMT expression. Therefore, PUMA may be a suitable target for intervention to improve the therapeutic efﬁcacy of TMZ. ",

The present work focuses on the understanding of nimustine interaction with DNA to delineate its mechanism at molecular level. Attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) has been used to determine the binding sites of nimustine on DNA. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy has been used to confirm conformational variations in DNA molecule upon nimustine-DNA interaction. Thermodynamic parameters of nimustine-DNA reaction have been calculated by isothermal titration calorimetry. Results of the present study demonstrate that nimustine is not a simple alkylating agent rather it causes major grove-directed-alkylation. Spectroscopic data suggest binding of nimustine with nitrogenous bases guanine (C6 = O6) and thymine (C4 = O4) in DNA major groove. CD spectra of nimustine-DNA complexes point toward the perturbation of native B-conformation of DNA and its partial transition into C-form. Thermodynamically, nimustine-DNA interaction is an entropy driven endothermic reaction, which suggests hydrophobic interaction of nimustine in DNA-major groove pocket. Spectral results suggest base binding and local conformational changes in DNA upon nimustine interaction. Investigation of drug-DNA interaction is an essential part of rational drug designing that also provides information about the drug's action at molecular level. Results, demonstrated here, may contribute in the development of new nitrosourea therapeutics with better efficacy and fewer side effects.",

N5-2OH is an excellent substrate of thymidine kinase 1 and its favorable biodistribution profile in rodents led to successful preclinical NCT of rats bearing intracerebral RG2 glioma. The present study explored cellular influx and efflux mechanisms of N5-2OH, as well as its intracellular anabolism beyond the monophosphate level. N5-2OH entered cultured human CCRF-CEM cells via passive diffusion, whereas the multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 appeared to be a major mediator of N5-2OH monophosphate efflux. N5-2OH was effectively monophosphorylated in cultured murine L929 [thymidine kinase 1 (TK1(+))] cells whereas formation of N5-2OH monophosphate was markedly lower in L929 (TK1(-)) cell variants. Further metabolism to the di- and triphosphate forms was not observed in any of the cell lines. Regardless of monophosphorylation, parental N5-2OH was the major intracellular component in both TK1(+) and TK1(-) cells. Phosphate transfer experiments with enzyme preparations showed that N5-2OH monophosphate, as well as the monophosphate of a second 3-carboranyl thymidine analog [3-[5-(o-carboran-1-yl)pentan-1-yl]thymidine (N5)], were not substrates of thymidine monophosphate kinase. Surprisingly, N5-diphosphate was phosphorylated by nucleoside diphosphate kinase although N5-triphosphate apparently was not a substrate of DNA polymerase. Our results provide valuable information on the cellular metabolism and pharmacokinetic profile of 3-carboranyl thymidine analogs. ",

The Codon Adaptation Index (CAI), representing the number of codons effective for human expression, was much improved (0.79 for hNIS, 0.97 for opt-hNIS). Both wild-type (hNIS) and optimized human NIS (opt-hNIS) were cloned into pcDNA3.1 and pMSCV vectors for transfection. Various cancer cell lines such as thyroid (TPC-1, FRO, B-CPAP), breast (MDA-MB-231), liver (Hep3B), cervical (HeLa), and glioma (U87MG) were transfected with pcDNA3.1/hNIS or pcDNA3.1/opt-hNIS. 125I uptake by opt-hNIS-expressing cells was 1.6~2.1 times higher than uptake by wild-type hNIS-expressing cells. Stable cell lines were also established by retroviral transduction using pMSCV/hNIS or pMSCV/opt-hNIS, revealing higher NIS protein levels and 125I uptake in opt-hNIS-expressing cells than in hNIS-expressing cells. Moreover, scintigraphic images from cell plates and mouse xenografts showed stronger signals from opt-hNIS-expressing cells than hNIS-expressing cells, and radioactivity uptake by opt-hNIS-expressing tumors was 2.3-fold greater than that by hNIS-expressing tumors. To test the efficacy of radioiodine therapy, mouse xenograft models were established with cancer cells expressing hNIS or opt-hNIS. 131I treatment reduced tumor sizes of hNIS- and opt-hNIS-expressing tumors to 0.57- and 0.27- fold, respectively, compared to their sizes before therapy, suggesting an improved therapeutic effect of opt-hNIS. In summary, this study shows that codon optimization strongly increases hNIS protein levels and radioiodine uptake, thus supporting opt-hNIS as a more sensitive reporter and efficient therapeutic gene.",

Herein, we show that extracellular HSP90α favors cell migration of glioblastoma U87 cells. More specifically, externally applied HSP90α rapidly induced endocytosis of EGFR. This response was accompanied by a transient increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) appearing after 1-3 min of treatment. In the presence of EGF, U87 cells showed HSP90α-induced Ca(2+) oscillations, which were reduced by the ATP/ADPase, apyrase, and inhibited by the purinergic P(2) inhibitor, suramin, suggesting that ATP release is requested. Disruption of lipid rafts with methyl β-cyclodextrin impaired the Ca(2+) rise induced by extracellular HSP90α combined with EGF. Specific inhibition of TLR4 expression by blocking antibodies suppressed extracellular HSP90α-induced Ca(2+) signaling and the associated cell migration. HSPs are known to bind lipopolysaccharides (LPSs). Preincubating cells with Polymyxin B, a potent LPS inhibitor, partially abrogated the effects of HSP90α without affecting Ca(2+) oscillations observed with EGF. Extracellular HSP90α induced EGFR phosphorylation at Tyr-1068, and this event was prevented by both the protein kinase Cδ inhibitor, rottlerin, and the c-Src inhibitor, PP2. Altogether, our results suggest that extracellular HSP90α transactivates EGFR/ErbB1 through TLR4 and a PKCδ/c-Src pathway, which induces ATP release and cytosolic Ca(2+) increase and finally favors cell migration. This mechanism could account for the deleterious effects of HSPs on high grade glioma when released into the tumor cell microenvironment.",

Fibrogenic cells activate in response to a variety of cytokines, growth factors, and inflammatory mediators. The involvement of members of the epidermal growth factor family in this process has been suggested. Amphiregulin is an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligand specifically induced upon liver injury. We investigated the effects of quercetin on the amphiregulin/EGFR signal and on the activation of downstream pathways leading to cell growth. Rats were divided into 4 groups (8 rats/group): rats subjected to common bile duct ligation (CBDL), Sham (rats subjected to simulated CBDL), quercetin-treated sham, and quercetin-treated CBDL (CBDL-Q). Quercetin (50 mg/kg i.p. injection) was administered daily for 2 wk starting on d 14 after surgery. Overexpression of amphiregulin, EGFR, TNFα, IL-6, TGFβ, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), extracellular regulated kinase, protein kinase B (Akt), cycloxygenase (COX)-2, and glioma-associated oncogenes (GLI)-1 and-2 were observed in liver of CBDL rats after 4 wk of bile duct ligation. CBDL-Q rats had a significantly diminished expression of amphiregulin and EGFR compared with untreated CBDL rats. Furthermore, mRNA levels of TNFα, IL-6, TGFβ, and PDGF and the protein content of COX-2, GLI-1, and GLI-2 were significantly lower in CBDL-Q rats than in untreated CBDL rats. The findings indicate that quercetin ameliorated activation of survival pathways and downregulated the expression of genes related to inflammation and precancerous conditions. Suppression of amphiregulin/EGFR signals may contribute to this effect.",

However, the optimal timing and the precise mechanisms responsible are not known. The effect of different time intervals between glucose load and thermochemotherapy with ACNU in the treatment of BT4An tumors, therefore, was investigated. Changes of serum glucose (Se-glucose), hemoglobin, systemic circulation parameters, tumor pH, and tumor temperature, induced by intraperitoneal glucose and/or hyperthermia, were measured to assess their effect on tumor growth.;(a): Inbred BD IX rats with BT4An tumors on the hind leg were treated with ACNU 7 mg/kg intravenously just before waterbath hyperthermia, and intraperitoneal hypertonic glucose (6 g/kg) at different time intervals before (240-0 min) or immediately after thermochemotherapy. (b): Intratumoral pH and temperature were measured at different intervals after intraperitoneal glucose, and during hyperthermia with or without previous glucose. (c): Hemoglobin, hematocrit, and Se-glucose were measured at different times after intraperitoneal glucose. (d): Mean arterial pressure, pulse pressure, and heart rate were measured for 120 min after intraperitoneal glucose.;(a): The number of tumor controls and the growth delay was greatest with glucose 45 min before thermochemotherapy, and least with a time interval of 240 min. Glucose after thermochemotherapy delayed tumor growth. (b): After intraperitoneal glucose alone, intratumoral pH decreased gradually from 6.76 to 5.86 after 240 min. Hyperthermia 120 min after glucose induced a rapid further pH drop, while hyperthermia alone had no significant influence on pH. Intratumoral temperature was higher during hyperthermia in animals given glucose. (c): A substantial rise of Se-glucose and hemoglobin developed. The hemoconcentration was maintained also after reduction of Se-glucose towards normal values. (d): An initial tachycardia, and a reduction of the mean arterial pressure of about 10% 5-45 min after was measured.;The data indicate that a complex interaction between gradually reduced tumor pH, hyperglycemia, hemoconcentration, and reduced tumor blood flow, and not a breakdown of systemic circulation, is responsible for the effect of intraperitoneal glucose on thermochemotherapy with ACNU.

SpringGene analysis was carried out of differential expression followed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), to understand the underlying consequence in developing disease and disorders. We identified 1,102 known genes differentially expressed to a significant degree (p<0.001) changed between the treatment. Within this gene set, 20 genes were significantly changed between treated cells and the control cells with cutoff fold change of more than 1.5. These genes are RNA-binding motif, single-stranded interacting protein 1 (RBMS1), ribosomal protein L29 (RPL29), glutathione S-transferase mu 2 (GSTM2), C15orf32, Akt3, B cell translocation gene 1 (BTG1), C6orf62, C7orf60, kinesin-associated protein 3 (KIFAP3), FBXO11, AT-rich interactive domain 4A (ARID4A), COPS2, TBPL1|SLC2A12, TMEM59, SNORD46, glioma tumor suppressor candidate region gene 2 (GLTSCR2), and LRRFIP.

A grade III human astrocytoma-derived cell line was used to study the role of PKC in PR phosphorylation, transcriptional activity, and degradation. Treatment with PKC activator [tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA)] increased PR phosphorylation in Ser400 after 5 minutes, which in turn induced PR transcriptional activity and its subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome 3-5 hours after treatment. Silencing or inhibition of PKCα and PKCδ blocked PR phosphorylation and degradation induced by TPA. Both PR isoforms were associated with PKCα and reached the maximum association after 5 minutes of TPA addition. These data correlated with immunnofluorescence assays in which nuclear colocalization of PKCα with PR increased after TPA treatment.

By 12 h of IL-4 treatment, both cdk4 and cdk2 kinase activities against the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) were reduced and nuclear entry of pRb was prohibited. Twelve-hour cdk complexes contained elevated p21(waf1/cip1) but not p27(kip1), p15(ink4B) or p16(ink4A).

Gopalakrishna and W. B. Anderson, Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 285, 382-387, 1991). Since retinoids previously have been shown to antagonize the actions of tumor promoters, studies were carried out to determine if retinoids can inhibit the oxidative modification of PKC induced by tumor promoters. Prior treatment of B16 melanoma cells or C6 glioma cells with all-trans-retinoic acid (0.1 microM) for a short time period (15 to 60 min) followed by subsequent treatment with oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide resulted in a 30 to 70% decrease in the oxidative modification of PKC. This resulted in a decrease in oxidant-induced conversion of PKC from a Ca2+/lipid-dependent form (peak A) to a Ca2+/lipid-independent form (peak B). This retinoid-mediated protection also was observed with the reversible oxidative modification of PKC induced by m-periodate treatment of intact cells. To understand whether this protection offered by retinoids was caused by a direct influence of retinoids on PKC, experiments were carried out using the purified enzyme. The results of experiments using isolated PKC suggested that retinoids can act directly to protect the regulatory domain of PKC from oxidative modification induced by oxidants. However, high (1-10 microM) concentrations of retinoids are necessary to elicit this protection of isolated PKC. In contrast, in experiments with intact cells, only low (submicromolar) concentrations of retinoids are required to protect PKC from oxidation. The differences noted in the retinoid concentrations required to protect PKC from oxidant modification in the test tube versus in the intact cell may be due to increased retention of retinoids in the cell membrane by partitioning, or to other indirect actions of retinoids in the intact cells to decrease cellular oxidations. These results suggest that some of the anti-tumor promoter actions of retinoids may be mediated, in part, by inhibiting the oxidative modification of protein kinase C induced by oxidant tumor promoters.",

After appropriate selection, we performed epilepsy surgery in 12 patients (9 males and 3 females). The mean age at operation was 21.4 years (range 4-44 years). All patients were receiving high therapeutic doses of antiepileptic therapy. Abnormal findings in Magnetic Resonance were observed in all cases. Pre and post resection electrocorticogram were recorded and graded according to Jay Scale. Pathological findings showed, neoplasic lesion in 2 cases (16%); one ganglioglioma and a low grade astrocytoma) and 10 patients (84%) showed non-neoplasic lesions. Three patients (25%) had cortical dysplasia, another 3 (25%) had mesotemporal sclerosis, three more (25%) gliosis and one (8%) an arachnoid cyst. Post resection ECoG showed (84%) type A, (8%) type B, and (8%) type C. The present study has shown that intraoperative ECoG has an important role in the prediction of medically intractable epilepsy. Outcome of temporal lobe epilepsy surgery in our series was comparable to results reported by other authors despite of the absence of sophisticated functional tests.",

Housekeeping genes that are absolutely reliable are essential for these studies to normalize gene expression. An incorrect choice of housekeeping genes leads to interpretation errors of experimental results including evaluation and quantification of pathological gene expression. Here, we examined (a) the degree of regulation of GAPDH expression in human glioblastoma cells under hypoxic conditions in vitro in comparison to other housekeeping genes like beta-actin, serving as experimental loading controls, (b) the potential use of GAPDH as a target for tumor therapeutic approaches and (c) differences in GAPDH expression between low-grade astrocytomas and glioblastomas, for which modest and severe hypoxia, respectively, have been previously demonstrated. GAPDH and beta-actin expression was comparatively examined in vivo in human low-grade astrocytoma and glioblastoma on both protein and mRNA level, by Western blot and semiquantitative RT-PCR, respectively. Furthermore, the same proteins were determined in vitro in U373, U251 and GaMG human glioblastoma cells using the same methods. HIF-1alpha protein regulation under hypoxia was also determined on mRNA level in vitro in GaMG and on protein level in U251, U373 and GaMG cells.;We observed no hypoxia-induced regulatory effect on GAPDH expression in the three glioblastoma cell lines studied in vitro. In addition, GAPDH expression was similar in patient tumor samples of low-grade astrocytoma and glioblastoma, suggesting a lack of hypoxic regulation in vivo.;GAPDH represents an optimal choice of a housekeeping gene and/or loading control to determine the expression of hypoxia induced genes at least in glioblastoma. Because of the lack of GAPDH regulation under hypoxia, this gene is not an attractive target for tumor therapeutic approaches in human glioblastoma.",

Recently, we have introduced novel ceramide analogs of the beta-hydroxy alkyl amide type, which trigger pro-apoptotic signaling pathways without prior elevation of endogenous ceramide. They induce apoptosis specifically in rapidly dividing neuroblastoma cells, but not in resting or differentiated cells. We characterize new ceramide mimics that have been derived from N-acylation of serinol (S), diethanolamine (B), propanolamine (P), and tris(hydroxy-methyl)methylamine (T) with myristic (14), palmitic (16), or oleic (18) acid. The water solubility of these compounds exceeds that of ceramide by more than 100-fold (up to 5 mM). Apoptosis of human neuroblastoma, glioma, medulloblastoma, and adenocarcinoma cells is induced by N-(2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl)ethyl)-palmitoylamide, C16-serinol (S16), N-(2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl)ethyl)-oleoylamide, C18-serinol (S18), N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-myristoyl-amide (B16), and N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-oleoylamide (T18) within 60 min of incubation, and is completed even after removal of the compound from the medium. This is most likely due to a rapid uptake of the analogs followed by their slow release from the cells. Alteration of the acyl chain length to less than 14 methylene units, removal of the amino group, or reducing the number of hydroxyalkyl residues to less than two significantly lowers or eliminates the pro-apoptotic potential of these compounds. The target specificity of novel ceramide analogs for tumor cells, their water solubility, and fast pro-apoptotic mechanism indicates a high therapeutic potential for cancer treatment.",

Screening differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in brain tumor samples and normal brain samples is of importance for identifying GBM and to design specific-targeting drugs. The transcriptional profile of GSE30563, containing three genechips of brain tumor samples and three genechips of normal brain samples, was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus to identify the DEGs. The differences in the expression of the DEGs in the two different samples were compared through hierarchical biclustering. The co-expression coefficient of the DEGs was calculated using the information from COXPRESdb, the network of the DEGs was constructed and functional enrichment and pathway analysis were performed. Finally, the transcription factors of important DEGs were predicted. A total of 1,006 DEGs, including 368 upregulated and 638 downregulated DEGs, were identified. A close correlation was demonstrated between six important genes, associated with immune response, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DPA1, HLA-B, HLA-DMA and HLA-DRA, and the immune response. Allograft rejection was selected as the most significant pathway. A total of 17 transcription factors, including nuclear factor (NF)-κB and NF-κB1, and their binding sites containing these six DEGs, were also identified. The DEGs, including major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, DQβ1, MHC class II, DRβ1, MHC class IB, MHC class II, DMα, MHC class II, DPα1, MHC class II, DRα, may provide novel targets for the diagnosis and treatment of GBM.

The aim of this study was to establish a simple and accurate method for intracranial injection of cells or other materials into mice.;The authors performed micro CT scans and skull dissection to assess the anatomical characteristics of the mouse postglenoid foramen. They then used xenograft and genetically engineered mouse models to evaluate a novel technique of percutaneous intracranial injection via the postglenoid foramen. They injected green fluorescent protein-labeled U87MG cells or virus-producing cells into adult mouse brains via the postglenoid foramen and identified the location of the created tumors by using bioluminescence imaging and histological analysis.;The postglenoid foramen was found to be a well-conserved anatomical structure that allows percutaneous injection into the cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem, and basal cistern in mice. The mean (± SD) time for the postglenoid foramen injection technique was 88 ± 15 seconds. The incidence of in-target tumor formation in the xenograft model ranged from 80% to 100%, depending on the target site. High-grade gliomas were successfully developed by postglenoid foramen injection in the adult genetically engineered mouse using virus-mediated platelet-derived growth factor B gene transfer. There were no procedure-related complications.;The postglenoid foramen can be used as a needle entry site into the brain of the adult mouse. Postglenoid foramen injection is a less invasive, safe, precise, and rapid method of implanting cells into the adult mouse brain. This method can be applied to both orthotopic xenograft and genetically engineered mouse models and may have further applications in mice for the development of therapies for human brain tumors.",

Bioluminescence imaging (BLI), 18F-FET MicroPET and T2-weighted (T2w)-MRI were used to follow tumour development.

Incubation of NG108-15 cells with conduritol-B-epoxide, a covalent inhibitor of glucosylceramidase, raised the intracellular concentration of glucosylceramide (GC) by more than fourfold, indicating a glycolipid composition equivalent to that of Gaucher's cells. The level of GC was decreased, and the cells were depleted of gangliosides by postincubation with d,l-PDMP or NB-DNJ. Treatment with d,l-PDMP, but not with NB-DNJ, resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of the growth rate and eventually caused cell death in NG108-15 cells on reaching confluency. An in situ detection assay using terminal nucleotidyltransferase indicated that cell degeneration was accompanied by apoptosis. Lipid analysis by high-performance TLC revealed that on incubation with d,l-PDMP, but not with NB-DNJ, the concentration of endogenous ceramide was elevated by threefold. Ceramide elevation and apoptosis were also observed when NG108-15 cells were incubated with daunorubicin, which was previously reported to induce programmed cell death by stimulation of ceramide synthesis. Structural characterization by HPLC and subsequent laser desorption mass spectrometry revealed that the endogenous ceramide contained fatty acids with chain lengths ranging from C14:0 to C24:0. The results indicate that elevation of levels of these ceramide species by incubation with d,l-PDMP or daunorubicin induces programmed cell death in NG108-15 cells. Because ceramide accumulation and cell death were not observed on incubation with NB-DNJ, its use is suggested to be less toxic than that of d,l-PDMP for treatment of Gaucher's disease and other sphingolipid storage disorders.",

Astrocytes, the major glial cell type in the central nervous system, are a source of brain tumors. In this study, we examined MuD expression and function in human astroglioma cells. Stimulation of U251-MG cells with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) resulted in a 40% decrease in cell viability and a 33% decrease in MuD protein levels, although not in MuD mRNA levels. To study the functional relevance of MuD expression, stable transfectants expressing high levels of MuD were generated. Stimulation of these transfectants with TRAIL resulted in enhanced cell survival (77% for stable and 46% for control transfectants). Depletion of MuD led to a marked reduction upon TRAIL stimulation in cell viability (22% in MuD-depleted cells and 54% in control cells). In addition, we observed that MuD depletion increased the susceptibility of the cells to TRAIL by enhancing the cleavage of caspase-3/-9 and BH3-interacting domain death agonist (Bid). A unique 25-kDa fragment of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) lacking BH4 was observed 60-180 min post TRAIL treatment in MuD-depleted cells, suggesting that Bcl-2 is converted from its anti-apoptotic form to the truncated pro-apoptotic form. Importantly, the TRAIL-mediated decrease in cell viability in MuD-depleted cells was abrogated upon Bid depletion, indicating that the role of MuD in apoptotic signaling takes place at the Bid and Bcl-2 junction. MuD localizes predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum and partly in the mitochondria and its amounts are reduced 6 h post TRAIL stimulation, presumably via caspase-3-mediated MuD cleavage. Collectively, these results suggest that MuD, a novel signaling protein, not only possesses an anti-apoptotic function but may also constitute an important target for the design of ideal candidates for combinatorial treatment strategies for glioma cells.

BMG-1 human glioma cells were induced to undergo programmed cell death by treating with a large dose (100 microM) of etoposide, and comets were prepared after different durations (1-24 h) of treatment.;In contrast to results of previously published studies, comets with different shapes reflecting progressive stages of DNA fragmentation were observed. Of these, six distinct shapes were identified and divided into three different categories based on the extent of fragmentation. Type A comets had a large head separated by a narrow \"neck\" region from an oval bulging tail that indicated initiation of fragmentation. Type B and C comets had a constantly diminishing head associated with a corresponding expansion of the tail and reflected intermediate and late stages of fragmentation, respectively. Type A and B comets appeared at a high frequency during early time points (1-6 h), whereas type C comets that indicated late stages of fragmentation were observed only after extended treatment (24 h). As a result, an elaborate kinetics of the progression of DNA fragmentation could be obtained.;The present single-cell gel electrophoresis assay offers a significant improvement in monitoring the kinetics of DNA fragmentation induced during programmed cell death. Coupled with its simplicity and the ability to detect responses of small cell subpopulations, this method can be used for a reliable and sensitive analysis of the progression of cell death in different cell types and treatment conditions.",

Functional methods such as PET and SPECT imaging are now used more frequently. We have studied pre-operatively 15 adult epileptic patients (8 female, 7 male) using a rotational scintillation camera interfaced to a dedicated computer. The tomographic images were obtained 15 minutes after intravenous injection of 99mTc-HMPAO. All had MRI scanning and intensive EEG monitoring which generally included seizure recording. Five patients had progressive lesions (3 meningiomas, 2 astrocytomas). In 10 patients, neuroradiological studies did not show the presence of progressive lesions (2 normal scans and 8 cases with inactive lesions). Two patients with meningioma showed hypoperfusion at the lesion site while the third patient had a marked hyperperfusion which might correlate with the clinical diagnosis of epilepsia partialis continua. In the astrocytoma patients SPECT scans showed hypoperfusion at the lesion site. Data obtained from the 10 patients without progressive CNS lesions showed: (a) in 4, SPECT findings correlated well with the anatomical findings; (b) in 5 instances, SPECT was able to disclose additional functional deficits; (c) in one case, there was no SPECT correlate of a discrete anatomical lesion. In 5 of these cases with no progressive lesions (n = 10) SPECT findings were useful as a complementary tool in determining the clinical or surgical management of these patients. Despite the small number and heterogenicity of the present sample, SPECT seems to be an useful tool as part of the clinical workup of epileptic patients who are candidates for epilepsy surgery.",

The protein L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase (PIMT) is an enzyme that recognizes and repairs the abnormal L-isoaspartyl residues in proteins. Recently, we reported that PIMT expression was stimulated by the anti-epileptic drug valproic acid and that this was mediated through the glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3)/beta-catenin pathway. In this study, to gain further insights into which of the signaling pathways activated by valproic acid regulate PIMT abundance, astrocytoma U-87 MG and neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were treated with this drug to investigate the possible involvement of the extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway in PIMT induction. Valproic acid increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation on Thr202/Tyr204 and Thr185/Tyr187, respectively. Pharmacological inhibitors against the kinases Src, c-Raf, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 abolished the ERK1/2 phosphorylation stimulated by valproic acid, thus preventing PIMT induction by the drug. Furthermore, MEK1/2 inhibition with U0126 blocked the higher phosphorylation of RSK-1 on Thr359/Ser363 and of GSK-3beta on Ser9 as well as the increased expression of RSK-1, beta-catenin and PIMT upon treatment with valproic acid. RSK-1 knockdown by interfering RNA abrogated the increased expression of RSK-1, beta-catenin and PIMT as well as the induced phosphorylation of RSK-1 and GSK-3beta due to valproic acid. Thus, our findings demonstrated that PIMT up-regulation by valproic acid required the activation of the ERK signaling pathway including RSK-1 the latter being responsible for inactivating GSK-3 and subsequently leading to beta-catenin stabilization.",

Neuroimaging is essential to characterise these lesions, to determine the exact location of the lesion and most importantly to exclude a possible intracranial extension or connection. Our objective was to evaluate CT and MRI in the diagnosis of developmental nasal midline masses. Eleven patients (mean age 4.5 years) with nasal midline masses were examined by CT and MRI. Neuroimaging was evaluated for (a) lesion location/size, (b) indirect (bifid or deformed crista galli, widened foramen caecum, defect of the cribriform plate) and direct (identification of intracranially located lesion components or signal alterations) imaging signs of intracranial extension, (c) secondary complications and (d) associated malformations. Surgical and histological findings served as gold standard. Nasal dermoid sinus cysts were diagnosed in 9 patients. One patient was diagnosed with an meningocele and another patient with a nasal glioma. Indirect CT and MRI signs correlated with the surgical results in 10 of 11 patients. Direct CT findings correlated with surgery in all patients, whereas the direct MRI signs correlated in 9 of 11 patients. In 2 patients MRI showed an intracranial signal alteration not seen on CT. Neuroimaging corrected the clinical diagnosis in 1 patient. One child presented with a meningitis. In none of the patients was an associated malformation diagnosed. Intracranial extension is equally well detected by CT and MRI using indirect imaging signs. Evaluating the direct imaging signs, MRI suspected intracranial components in 2 patients without a correlate on CT. This could represent an isolated intracranial component that got undetected on CT and surgery. In 9 patients CT and MRI matched the surgical findings. The MRI did not show any false-negative results. These results in combination with the multiplanar MRI capabilities, the different image contrasts that can be generated by MRI and the lack of radiation favour the use of MRI as primary imaging tool in these young patients in which the region of imaging is usually centred on the radiosensitive eye lenses.",

Convincing data exist defining transcriptionally distinct posterior fossa (PF) sub-groups A and B at diagnosis.

Genome and transcriptome microarray profiles and clinical variables of matched primary and first recurrent PF EPN pairs were used to identify biologically distinct patterns of progression between EPN sub-groups at recurrence. Key findings were validated by histology and immune function assays. Transcriptomic profiles were partially conserved at recurrence. However, 4 of 14 paired samples changed sub-groups at recurrence, and significant sub-group-specific transcriptomic changes between primary and recurrent tumors were identified, which were predominantly immune-related. Further examination revealed that Group A primary tumors harbor an immune gene signature and cellular functionality consistent with an immunosuppressive phenotype associated with tissue remodeling and wound healing. Conversely, Group B tumors develop an adaptive, antigen-specific immune response signature and increased T-cell infiltration at recurrence. Clinical distinctions between sub-groups become more apparent after first recurrence. Group A tumors were more often sub-totally resected and had a significantly shorter time to subsequent progression and worse overall survival. Minimal tumor-specific genomic changes were observed for either PF Groups A or B at recurrence. Molecular sub-groups of PF EPN convey distinct immunobiologic signatures at diagnosis and recurrence, providing potential biologic rationale to their disparate clinical outcomes.

Octa-anionic 5,10,15,20-tetra[3,5-(nido-carboranylmethyl)phenyl] porphyrin (H₂OCP) is a boronated porphyrin having eight boron clusters linked to the porphyrin ring. To evaluate H₂OCP's applicability to both PDT and BNCT, we performed an in vitro and ex vivo study using F98 rat glioma cells.;We examined the time-dependent cellular uptake of H₂OCP by measuring the boron concentration over time, and compared the cellular uptake/clearance of boron after exposure to H₂OCP in conjunction with boronophenylalanine (BPA) and sodium borocaptate (BSH), both of which are currently used in clinical BNCT studies. We evaluated the cytotoxicity of H₂OCP-mediated PDT using a colony-forming assay and assessed the tumorigenicity of the implantation of pre-treated cells using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Fluorescence microscopy was also performed to evaluate the cellular uptake of H₂OCP.;H₂OCP accumulated within cells to a greater extent than BPA/BSH, and H₂OCP was retained inside the cells to approximately the same extent as BSH. The cell-surviving fraction following laser irradiation (8 J/cm², 18 hours after exposure to 10 µg B/ml H₂OCP) was <0.05. The median survival times of the pre-treated cell-implanted rats were longer than those of the untreated group (P < 0.05). The fluorescence of H₂OCP was clearly demonstrated within the tumor cells by fluorescence microscopy.;H₂OCP has been proven to be a promising photosensitizer for PDT. H₂OCP has also been proposed as a potentially effective replacement of BPA or BSH, or as a replacement of both BPA/BSH. Our study provides more evidence that H₂OCP could be an effective novel dual sensitizing agent for use in both PDT and BNCT.",

Dysregulation of this fundamental process may affect many other important cellular processes such as tumor growth, inflammatory response, cell cycle, and apoptosis. It is known that XPO1 (Exportin-1/Chromosome Region Maintenance 1/CRM1) is the main mediator of nuclear export in many cell types. Nuclear proteins exported to the cytoplasm by XPO1 include the drug targets topoisomerase IIα (topo IIα) and BCR-ABL and tumor suppressor proteins such as Rb, APC, p53, p21, and p27. XPO1 can mediate cell proliferation through several pathways: (i) the sub-cellular localization of NES-containing oncogenes and tumor suppressor proteins, (ii) the control of the mitotic apparatus and chromosome segregation, and (iii) the maintenance of nuclear and chromosomal structures. The XPO1 protein is elevated in ovarian carcinoma, glioma, osteosarcoma, pancreatic and cervical cancer. There is a growing body of research indicating that XPO1 may have an important role as a prognostic marker in solid tumors. Because of this, nuclear export inhibition through XPO1 is a potential target for therapeutic intervention in many cancers. The best understood XPO1 inhibitors are the small molecule nuclear export inhibitors (NEIs; Leptomycin B and derivatives, ratjadones, PKF050-638, valtrate, ACA, CBS9106, selinexor/KPT-330, and verdinexor/KPT-335). Selinexor and verdinexor are orally bioavailable, highly potent, small molecules that are classified as Selective Inhibitors of Nuclear Export (SINE). KPT-330 is the only NEI currently in Phase I/II human clinical trials in hematological and solid cancers. Of all the potential targets in nuclear cytoplasmic transport, the nuclear export receptor XPO1 remains the best understood and most advanced therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Nuclear medicine is engaged with the detection of pathological processes with the help of radionuclides. An interesting approach is to target antigens, symporters, or receptors with diagnostic and therapeutic radionuclides. Different peptide receptors like somatostatin, bombesin/GRP or VIP are (over)expressed on cancer cells, and are therefore an ideal target for the diagnosis and therapy in nuclear medicine with radiolabeled peptides. The somatostatin analogue OctreoScan [octreotide coupled with diethylene-triamine-pentaacetate (DTPA)] can be labeled with In-111 and is widely used in nuclear oncology for the staging of different tumors (e.g., carcinoids). Other peptides like neurotensin, bombesin/GRP, and VIP are under (pre)clinical investigations. The staging of metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) with the conventional radiological procedures is sometimes difficult. The high sensitivity of the pentagastrin stimulation test in detecting primary or metastatic MTC indicates the presence of tumor, but its localization is often not possible. This reaction of the tumor cells to the pentagastrin stimulation test suggests a widespread expression of the corresponding receptor type on human MTC. Indeed, autoradiographic studies demonstrated cholecystokinin (CCK)-B/gastrin receptors not only in over 90% of MTCs, but in a high percentage of small cell lung cancers, stromal ovarian, and potentially a variety of other tumors, including gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas, neuroendocrine tumors, and malignant glioma. The aim of our recent work was to develop and systematically optimize suitable radioligands for targeting CCK-B receptors in vivo and to investigate their role in the staging and therapy of MTC and other CCK-B receptor expressing malignancies. For this purpose, a variety of CCK/gastrin-related peptides, all having in common the C-terminal CCK receptor binding tetrapeptide sequence -Trp-Met-Asp-PheNH(2) or derivatives thereof, were investigated. They were members of the gastrin- or cholecystokinin families, or possessed characteristics of both, which differ by the intramolecular position of a tyrosyl moiety. Their stability and affinity were studied and optimized in vitro and in vivo; their biodistribution and therapeutic efficacy were tested in preclinical models. Best tumor uptake and tumor-to-nontumor ratios were obtained with members of the gastrin family, due to their superior selectivity and affinity for the CCK-B receptor subtype. Radiometal-labeled derivatives of minigastrin showed excellent targeting of CCK-B receptor expressing tissues in animals and healthy human volunteers. Preclinical therapy experiments in MTC-bearing animals showed significant antitumor efficacy. In a subsequent clinical study, 75 MTC patients with metastatic MTC were investigated; 43 suffered of known, 32 of occult disease. CCK-B receptor scintigraphy was performed with (111)In-DTPA-D-Glu(1)-minigastrin. The normal organ uptake was essentially confined to the stomach (and to a lower extent, to the gallbladder and, in premenopausal women, to normal breast tissue) as a result of CCK-B receptor specific binding, and to the kidneys as excretory organs. All tumor manifestations known from conventional imaging were visualized as early as 1 h p.i., with increasing tumor-to-background ratios over time; at least one lesion was detected in 29/32 patients with occult disease (patient-based sensitivity 91%). Among them were local recurrences, lymph node, pulmonary, hepatic, splenic, and bone (marrow) metastases. Eight patients with advanced metastatic disease were injected in a dose-escalation study with potentially therapeutic activities of a (90)Y-labeled minigastrin derivative at 4-6-weekly intervals (30-50 mCi/m(2) per injection for a maximum of four injections). Hematologic and renal were identified as the dose-limiting toxicities at the 40 and 50 mCi/m(2) levels. Two patients experienced partial remissions, 4 stabilization of their previously rapidly progressing disease. These data suggest that CCK-B receptor ligands may be a useful new class of receptor binding peptides for diagnosis and therapy of a variety of (CCK-B receptor expressing) tumor types. They allow for a sensitive and reliable staging of patients with metastatic MTC. Initial therapeutic results are promising, but nephrotoxicity is a major concern to be solved."},

        "Doc_abstract":"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary human brain tumor. About 7000 new cases are diagnosed yearly in the USA. Despite current neurosurgical and postoperative radiotherapeutic tumor cytoreduction methods, in most cases occult foci of tumor cells infiltrate surrounding edematous brain tissues and cause recurrent disease within one year. GBM is almost invariably fatal within a few years after it is diagnosed. Our goal is to achieve long-term control of GBM by combining immunoprophylaxis with a radiation-based technique, such as boron neutron-capture therapy (BNCT), potentially capable of specifically targeting the infiltrating tumor cells while sparing the surrounding normal brain tissue. It has long been known that the subcutaneous (sc) injection of irradiated cells or untreated cultured cells (and the removal of the resulting tumors) derived from the well characterized, highly immunogenic 9L gliosarcoma (9LGS) rat model into young isogenic rats can prevent tumor growth after subsequent sc or intracranial (ic) injection of untreated, otherwise lethal 9LGS cells. In this study we have confirmed, quantified and extended those findings to study the efficacy of such immunological memory in normal aging rats and in aging rats previously treated for ic 9LGS tumors by BNCT. (1) The sc injection of 5,000,000 untreated 9LGS cells and the surgical removal of the resulting tumors (method A) protected 80% of normal young rats from an ic challenge with 10,000 untreated 9LGS cells, and a single sc injection of 5,000,000 lethally X-irradiated 9LGS cells (method B) protected 66% of them, but multiple sc injections with a crude particulate fraction prepared from 9LGS cells were not protective. Protection is long-lasting since contralateral ic rechallenge of six-month survivors with an injection of 10,000 viable 9LGS cells resulted in 100% survival. (2) Normal one-year-old rats were only slightly less protected than were normal young rats, approximately 70% rather than approximately 80% (method A) and approximately 60% rather than approximately 66% (method B). (3) BNCT treatment alone resulted in partial immunological protection, as 30% of one-year post-BNCT survivors of ic 9LGS tumors prevailed after contralateral ic rechallenge with 10,000 viable 9LGS cells. Moreover a single sc immunization with 5,000,000 untreated 9LGS cells prior to ic rechallenge boosted survival from 30% to 100%. The relevance of these observations to strategies of preclinical experimentation for immunoprophylaxis of malignant gliomas is discussed.",

Western blot revealed the tyrosine⁴¹⁵ phosphorylation of tyrosine kinase c-Src under hypoxia. Treatment of the cells with tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP1 abolished hypoxia-induced increase in BNP expression and release.

        "Doc_abstract":"Sodium valproate (VPA) has been used clinically for treatment of not only epilepsy but also mood disorder. Although VPA is effective for treatment of epilepsy via inhibition of gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase, it remains unknown why VPA is effective for the treatment of mood disorder. The authors examined the effect of VPA at therapeutic concentrations (300 and 600 microM) on the elevation of intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) induced by carbachol, a muscarinic receptor agonist, in 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells. Treatment of the cells with 300 and 600 microM VPA for 2 min did not change the carbachol-induced [Ca(2+)](i) elevation. Treatment with 300 and 600 microM VPA for 48 h, however, reduced the elevation. Since we have shown that Li(+) reduced carbachol-induced [Ca(2+)](i) elevation in protein kinase C (PKC)-downregulated 1321N1 cells [Kurita, M., Mashiko, H., Rai, M., Kumasaka, T., Kouno, S., Niwa, S., Nakahata, N., 2002. Lithium chloride at a therapeutic concentration reduces Ca(2+)response in protein kinase C down-regulated human astrocytoma cells, Eur. J. Pharmacol. 442, 17-22.], the activity of PKC was examined. Treatment with VPA at the same concentrations for 24 or 48 h weakly reduced protein kinase C activity in membrane and cytosol fractions from the cells. On the other hand, the treatment of the cells with 600 microM VPA for 24 or 48 h slightly increased the B(max) value, but not the K(d) value, in the binding of [(3)H]quinuclidinyl benzylate, a muscarinic receptor ligand, to the membranes, suggesting that the number or affinity of muscarinic receptor did not decrease after VPA treatment. These results indicate that VPA at therapeutic concentrations slightly decreases the PKC activity and inhibits muscarinic receptor-mediated [Ca(2+)](i) elevation probably through change in the intracellular signaling pathway. VPA-induced reduction of PKC activity and [Ca(2+)](i) elevation may play a role in the treatment of mood disorder.",

Flow cytometry (FCM) characterization of fine-needle aspiration cytology and core needle biopsies are increasingly utilized to diagnose lymphomas however, no biological data have been published on FCM characterization of fresh single cell suspension from PCNSL SB. The aim of this study was to establish the feasibility and utility of FCM for the diagnosis and characterization of brain lymphomas from a tissue samples obtained by a single SB disaggregation.;Twenty-nine patients with a magnetic resonance suggestive for PCNSL entered the study. A median of 6 SB were performed for each patient. A cell suspension generated from manual tissue disaggregation of a single, unfixed, brain SB, was characterized by FCM. The FCM versus standard approach was prospectively compared.;FCM and IHC showed an high degree of agreement (89 %) in brain lymphoma identification. By FCM, 16 out of 18 PCNSL were identified within 2 h from biopsy. All were of B cell type, with a heterogeneous CD20 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), CD10 positive in 3 cases (19 %) with surface Ig light chain restriction documented in 11 cases (69 %). No false positive lymphomas cases were observed. Up to 38 % of the brain leukocyte population consisted of CD8 reactive T cells, in contrast with the CD4 positive lymphocytes of the peripheral blood samples (P < 0.001). By histopathology, 18 B-PCNSL, only one CD10 positive (5 %), 1 primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) and 10 gliomas were diagnosed. A median of 6 days was required for IHC diagnosis.;Complementary to histopathology FCM can contribute to a better characterization of PCNSL, although necrosis and previous steroid treatment can represent a pitfall of this approach. A single brain SB is a valid source for accurate FCM characterization of both lymphoma and reactive lymphocyte population, routinely applicable for antigen intensity quantification and consistently documenting an active mechanism of reactive CD8 T-lymphocytes migration in brain lymphomas. Moreover, FCM confirmed to be more sensitive than IHC for the identification of selected markers.",

The extent of reduction differed for different types of subunits: the levels of Go alpha and G beta 1 were reduced by 40-50%, whereas those of G alpha common immunoreactivity and Gi2 alpha were only reduced by 10-20% following treatment with 10 micrograms/ml cholera toxin. This effect of the toxin could not be mimicked by incubation with the resolved B oligomer of cholera toxin, nor by exposure of cells to agents able to raise the intracellular levels of cAMP. Basal adenylate cyclase was stimulated in a biphasic manner by cholera toxin, being stimulated at low concentrations (0.01-10 ng/ml) and then decreased at high (0.1-10 micrograms/ml) concentrations. Thus, the down regulation of G-protein subunits produced by cholera toxin requires its (ADP-ribosyl)transferase activity but does not result from a cAMP-mediated mechanism. The toxin-mediated decrease of Go alpha in the membrane was correlated with a diminution of opioid-receptor-mediated stimulation of high-affinity GTPase activity, suggesting that opioid receptors interact with Go in native membranes of NG108-15 cells. Northern-blot analysis of cytoplasmic RNA prepared from cells treated with cholera toxin showed that the levels of mRNA coding for G beta 1 did not change. Thus, the cholera-toxin-induced decrease of G-protein subunits may not result from an alteration in mRNA levels, but may involve a direct effect of the toxin on the process of insertion and/or clearance of G proteins into and/or from the membrane. These data indicate that cholera toxin, besides catalyzing the ADP-ribosylation of Gs and Gi/Go types of G proteins, can also reduce the steady state levels of Go alpha and G beta 1 subunits in the membrane and thus alter by an additional mechanism the function of inhibitory receptor systems.",

Thirty-seven patients had an anaplastic astrocytoma and 51 had a glioblastoma. Thirty-seven patients treated from 1982 to 1988 did not have pre-operative evaluation by MR imaging (Group A), 26 patients treated from 1989 to 1995 had preoperative MR imaging evaluation (Group B), and 25 patients treated after 1996 underwent preoperative MR imaging with functional brain mapping and intra-operative navigation system monitoring (Group C).;The median survival time was 8.8 months in Group A, 12.7 months in Group B, and 17.6 months in Group C.

Better preoperative performance status, more thorough surgical resection, and better performance status after the initial treatment was obtained after the introduction of MR imaging, and patients with the optimal indicators showed significantly longer survival time compared with the patients without these factors.;Pre-operative MR imaging may contribute to longer survival time by providing an earlier diagnosis in patients with better performance status, by allowing more thorough surgical resection, and resulting in better performance status after the treatment.",

To better understand the biology of this phenotype and aid therapeutic development, transcriptomic data from Group A and B EPN patient tumor samples, and additional malignant and normal brain data, were analyzed to identify the mechanism underlying EPN Group A inflammation. Enrichment of IL6 and STAT3 pathway genes were found to distinguish Group A EPN from Group B EPN and other brain tumors, implicating an IL6 activation of STAT3 mechanism. EPN tumor cell growth was shown to be dependent on STAT3 activity, as demonstrated using shRNA knockdown and pharmacologic inhibition of STAT3 that blocked proliferation and induced apoptosis. The inflammatory factors secreted by EPN tumor cells were shown to reprogram myeloid cells, and this paracrine effect was characterized by a significant increase in pSTAT3 and IL8 secretion. Myeloid polarization was shown to be dependent on tumor secretion of IL6, and these effects could be reversed using IL6-neutralizing antibody or IL6 receptor-targeted therapeutic antibody tocilizumab. Polarized myeloid cell production of IL8 drove unpolarized myeloid cells to upregulate CD163 and to produce a number of proinflammatory cytokines. Collectively, these findings indicate that constitutive IL6/STAT3 pathway activation is important in driving tumor growth and inflammatory cross-talk with myeloid cells within the Group A EPN microenvironment. Effective design of Group A-targeted therapy for children with EPN may require reversal of this potentially immunosuppressive and protumor pathway.",

RECK suppresses tumor invasion by negatively regulating at least three members of the matrix metalloproteinase family: MMP-9, MMP-2, and MT1-MMP. A positive correlation has been observed between the abundance of RECK expression in tumor samples and a more favorable prognosis for patients with several types of tumors. In the present study, novel alternatively spliced variants of the RECK gene: RECK-B and RECK-I were isolated by RT-PCR and sequenced. The expression levels and profiles of these alternative RECK transcripts, as well as canonical RECK were determined in tissue samples of malignant astrocytomas of different grades and in a normal tissue RNA panel by qRT-PCR. Our results show that higher canonical RECK expression, accompanied by a higher canonical to alternative transcript expression ratio, positively correlates with higher overall survival rate after chemotherapeutic treatment of GBM patients. U87MG and T98G cells over-expressing the RECK-B alternative variant display higher anchorage-independent clonal growth and do not display modulation of, respectively, MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression. Our findings suggest that RECK transcript variants might have opposite roles in GBM biology and the ratio of their expression levels may be informative for the prognostic outcome of GBM patients. ",

The solubilized synthetase was partially purified approximately 230-fold by gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography. The solubilized enzyme displayed similar properties to membrane-bound enzyme: (a) it synthesized high molecular weight hyaluronate which eluted in the void volume of a Sepharose CL-2B column; (b) the apparent Km values obtained for UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc were 50 and 100 microM, respectively; and (c) treatment of intact cells with hyaluronidase prior to extraction with digitonin resulted in a 3-fold increase in solubilized synthetase activity. Furthermore, gel filtration chromatography of the solubilized hyaluronidase-treated synthetase complex showed that it was smaller than the solubilized untreated synthetase complex, due to shorter nascent-bound hyaluronate. The solubilized synthetase was shown to be associated with hyaluronate in the form of a complex. Both hyaluronidase-treated and -untreated synthetase-hyaluronate complexes after solubilization were adsorbed by an affinity matrix using the hyaluronate binding domain of rat chondrosarcoma proteoglycan as ligand.

Indeed, autoradiographic studies have demonstrated cholecystokinin (CCK)-B/gastrin receptors not only in more than 90% of MTCs but also in a high percentage of small cell lung cancers, some ovarian cancers, astrocytomas and potentially a variety of adenocarcinomas. The aim of this study was to systematically screen and optimize, in a preclinical model and a pilot clinical study, suitable radioligands for targeting CCK-B receptors in vivo.;A variety of CCK/gastrin-related peptides, all bearing the C-terminal CCK receptor-binding tetrapeptide sequence Trp-Met-Asp-PheNH2 or derivatives thereof, were studied. They were radioiodinated by the lodogen or Bolton-Hunter procedures. The peptides were members of the gastrin or CCK families, which differ by the intramolecular position of a tyrosyl moiety. Their stability and affinity were studied in vitro and in vivo; their biodistribution and therapeutic efficacy were tested in nude mice bearing subcutaneous human MTC xenografts. Diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) derivatives of suitable peptides were synthesized successfully, and their preclinical and initial clinical evaluations were performed, labeled with 111In.;All members of the CCK or gastrin families were stable in serum (with half-lives of several hours at 37 degrees C); nevertheless, the stability of those peptides bearing N-terminal pGlu residues or D-amino acids was significantly higher. In accordance with their comparably low affinity, nonsulfated members of the CCK family showed fairly low uptake in the tumor and other CCK-B receptor-expressing tissues. Sulfated CCK derivatives performed significantly better but also displayed a comparably high uptake in normal CCK-A receptor-expressing tissues. This effect was probably due to their similar affinity for both CCK-A and CCK-B receptors. Best tumor uptake and tumor-to-nontumor ratios were obtained with members of the gastrin family because of their selectivity and affinity for the CCK-B receptor subtype. Pilot therapy experiments in MTC-bearing animals showed significant antitumor efficacy compared with untreated controls. DTPA derivatives of minigastrin were successfully developed. In a pilot clinical study, radioiodinated and 111In-labeled derivatives showed excellent targeting of physiological CCK-B receptor-expressing organs, as well as all known tumor sites.;CCK/gastrin analogs may be a useful new class of receptor-binding peptides for diagnosis and therapy of CCK-B receptor-expressing tumors, such as MTC or small cell lung cancer. Nonsulfated gastrin derivatives may be preferable because of their CCK-B receptor selectivity, hence lower accretion in normal CCK-A receptor-expressing organs.",

Here we present evidence that ceramide recruits the tumor suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10) into membrane microdomains (rafts), where it could act to reduce the levels of polyphosphoinositides necessary for the activation of Akt. A PTEN construct with a red-fluorescent protein (RFP) tag was overexpressed in both a human cell line derived from oligodendroglioma (HOG) and a rat pheochromocytoma cell line (PC12) by means of an inducible promoter system (Tet-Off). Induction of PTEN by removal of doxycycline enhanced both capsase-3 and cell death with staurosporine, wortmannin, or C2-ceramide, whereas antisense PTEN had the reverse effect. Overexpression of PTEN also increased acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) activity. PTEN normally has a generalized (cytosolic/membrane) distribution, but treatment with C2-ceramide translocated a fraction of the PTEN to the plasma membrane, showing a plasma membrane distribution similar to that observed for a prenylated green-fluorescent (GFP) construct. PTEN was then shown to translocate to the detergent-resistant membrane microdomain fraction (raft) of the plasma membrane. The colocalization of sphingomyelinases, ceramide, polyphosphoinositides, and PTEN in the raft fraction further suggests that the association of these lipids is critical for regulating cell death.",

A high percentage of antibody-producing B cells was detected, but antibody reactivity was generally lost during culture expansion. Two cultures, however, remained stable for antibody productivity and one was used to develop a stable hybrid line with mouse myeloma. The monoclonal antibody (designated 3-207) derived from patient VS has dual specificity for GM2 and GD2, despite the fact that only GM2 antibody could be detected in the patient's serum. Monoclonal antibody 3-207 shows high-titered reactivity with a range of melanoma, astrocytoma, neuroblastoma, and leukemia cell lines, cells with prominent cell surface expression of GM2 and GD2. The cell surface reactivity of monoclonal antibody 3-207 was not abolished by treatment of target cells with neuraminidase, as the enzyme converted GD2 to GM2, which was still detected by monoclonal antibody 3-207.",

Glutathione coated poly-(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA-b-PEG) nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared and tested in two different cell culture models of AD expressing microtubule associated protein tau (tau). The NPs showed a particle size averaging 136.5±4.4nm, which is suitable for the blood brain barrier (BBB) permeation. The in vitro release profile of the NPs exhibited no initial burst release and showed sustained drug release for up to 144 hours. Interestingly, treatment of newly formulated MB-NPs showed a potent reduction in both endogenous and over expressed tau protein levels in human neuroblastoma SHSY-5Y cells expressing endogenous tau and transfected HeLa cells over-expressing tau protein, respectively. Furthermore, in vitro BBB Transwell™ study showed significantly higher permeation of MB-NP compared to the MB solution through the co culture of rat brain endothelial 4 (RBE4) and C6 astrocytoma cells (p<0.05).

MPP(+) causes a selective dopaminergic neurodegeneration, the pathophysiologic hallmark of Parkinson disease. However, the toxic effect of MPP(+) on astrocytes remains unclear. Here, we examined the effect of MPP(+) on human astrocytoma U373MG cells, with particular attention to the temporal interaction of glutathione (GSH) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (H2O2 and O). MPP(+) induced astrocyte apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner 48 hr after treatment. Distinctive early (<6 hr) and late (24-48 hr) responses were observed. ROS production and the oxidized GSH (GSSG)/GSH ratio, indicators of oxidative stress, rose dramatically after 24 hr of MPP(+) exposure, whereas the H2O2 level transiently decreased at 6 hr. ROS overproduction and GSH dysfunction were concomitantly associated with caspase-3 activation and finally led to cell apoptosis. Moreover, GSH depletion by diethyl maleate, but not buthionine sulfoximine, caused cells to die quickly and potentiated the cytotoxicity of MPP(+). Co-treatment with melatonin, a known antioxidant secreted by the pineal gland, significantly prevented cell apoptosis by inhibiting oxidative stress and caspase-3 activation, but it did not affect that the early changes due to MPP(+) treatment. Our results demonstrate that in astrocytes, GSH is involved in the early decrease and late increase in ROS levels induced by MPP(+) treatment. Melatonin remedies the dysfunction of GSH system to block caspase-3 activation and cell apoptosis induced by oxidative stress during the long-term exposure of MPP(+).",

Previous studies have shown that tenidap is able to inhibit the production and action of cytokines such as interleukin-1, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor alpha. However, the mechanisms by which tenidap inhibits cytokine synthesis are not yet known. We investigated in the human astrocytoma cell line U373 whether tenidap inhibits IL-6 synthesis by inhibition of certain signal transduction processes leading to IL-6 synthesis. Cells were stimulated with different substances which have previously been shown to activate protein kinase A or C, reactive oxygen intermediates as well as transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappa B and AP-1 and which all result in IL-6 synthesis. Tenidap was a very potent inhibitor of IL-6 synthesis independent of the stimuli used, suggesting an inhibitory mechanism other than inhibition of a certain signal transduction pathway. Since IL-6 has been shown to be involved in the etiopathology of Alzheimer's disease and since the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs appears to be of therapeutical benefit, it is concluded that tenidap should be tested in clinical trials in order to determine whether it may be useful for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",

However, the mechanisms regulating MMP-9 expression by BK in rat brain astrocytes-1 (RBA-1) remain unclear. Here we report that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and NF-kappaB pathways participate in the induction of MMP-9 expression induced by BK in RBA cells. Zymographic, Western blotting, and RT-PCR analyses showed that BK increased expression of MMP-9 mRNA and protein in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. BK-induced MMP-9 mRNA and protein expression was inhibited by MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059, PI3-K inhibitor LY294002, and NF-kappaB inhibitor helenalin. In accordance with these findings, BK-induced phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK and Akt and activation of NF-kappaB was attenuated by prior treatment with PD98059, LY294002, and helenalin, respectively. The effects of BK on MMP-9 expression and p42/p44 MAPK and Akt phosphorylation were inhibited by B(2) receptor antagonist Hoe 140, indicating the involvement of B(2) receptors revealed by [(3)H]-BK binding assay. Furthermore, BK-stimulated translocation of NF-kappaB into the nucleus was revealed by Western blotting and immnofluorescence staining and blocked by Hoe140, PD98059, LY294002, and helenalin. Taken together, these results suggest that in RBA cells, activation of p42/p44 MAPK and Akt cascades mediated through NF-kappaB pathway are essential for BK-induced MMP-9 gene expression. This study may provide insights into the regulation of MMP-9 production in CNS, which may occur in vivo in pathological situations such as CNS inflammation and brain astrocytoma.",

PTEN mutation leads to constitutive activation of protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt with phosphorylation at the PKB/Akt sites Thr-308 and Ser-473. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) has been shown to regulate PKB/Akt activity with the loss of PTEN in prostate cancer. We now demonstrate that ILK activity regulates PKB/Akt activity in glioblastoma cells. The activity of ILK is constitutively elevated in a serum-independent manner in PTEN mutant cells, and transfection of wild-type PTEN under the control of an inducible promoter into mutant PTEN cells inhibits ILK activity. Transfection of ILK antisense (ILKAS) or exposure to a small-molecule ILK inhibitor suppresses the constitutive phosphorylation of PKB/Akt on Ser-473 in PTEN-mutant glioblastoma cell lines. In addition, the delivery of ILKAS to PTEN-negative glioblastoma cells resulted in apoptosis. Rag-2M mice bearing established ( approximately 100 mg) human U87MG glioblastoma tumors, treated QD x 5 for 3 consecutive weeks with ILKAS (i.p. 5 mg/kg), exhibited stable disease with < or =7% increase in tumor volume over the 3-week course of treatment. In contrast, animals treated with an oligonucleotide control or saline exhibited a >100% increase in tumor volume over the same time period. Our initial results indicate that therapeutic strategies targeting ILK may be beneficial in the treatment of glioblastomas.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Glioblastoma is a very aggressive form of brain tumor with limited therapeutic options. Usually, glioblastoma is treated with ionizing radiation (IR) and chemotherapy after surgical removal. However, radiotherapy is frequently unsuccessful, among others owing to resistance mechanisms the tumor cells have developed. Antiapoptotic B-cell leukemia (Bcl)-2 family members can contribute to radioresistance by interfering with apoptosis induction in response to IR. Bcl-2 and the closely related Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 are often overexpressed in glioblastoma cells. In contrast to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 is a short-lived protein whose stability is closely regulated by ubiquitylation-dependent proteasomal degradation. Although ubiquitin ligases facilitate degradation, the deubiquitylating enzyme ubiquitin-specific protease 9x (USP9x) interferes with degradation by removing polyubiquitin chains from Mcl-1, thereby stabilizing this protein. Thus, an inability to downregulate Mcl-1 by enhanced USP9x activity might contribute to radioresistance. Here we analyzed the impact of USP9x on Mcl-1 levels and radiosensitivity in glioblastoma cells. Correlating Mcl-1 and USP9x expressions were significantly higher in human glioblastoma than in astrocytoma. Downregulation of Mcl-1 correlated with apoptosis induction in established glioblastoma cell lines. Although Mcl-1 knockdown by siRNA increased apoptosis induction after irradiation in all glioblastoma cell lines, USP9x knockdown significantly improved radiation-induced apoptosis in one of four cell lines and slightly increased apoptosis in another cell line. In the latter two cell lines, USP9x knockdown also increased radiation-induced clonogenic death. The massive downregulation of Mcl-1 and apoptosis induction in A172 cells transfected with USP9x siRNA shows that the deubiquitinase regulates cell survival by regulating Mcl-1 levels. In contrast, USP9x regulated radiosensitivity in Ln229 cells without affecting Mcl-1 levels. We conclude that USP9x can control survival and radiosensitivity in glioblastoma cells by Mcl-1-dependent and Mcl-1-independent mechanisms. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Previously, we reported that activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) in 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells elicits a rapid release of ATP that is partially dependent on a G(q)/phophospholipase C (PLC)/Ca(2+) mobilization signaling cascade. In this study we assessed the role of Rho-family GTPase signaling as an additional pathway for the regulation of ATP release in response to activation of protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1), lysophosphatidic acid receptor (LPAR), and M3-muscarinic (M3R) GPCRs. Thrombin (or other PAR1 peptide agonists), LPA, and carbachol triggered quantitatively similar Ca(2+) mobilization responses, but only thrombin and LPA caused rapid accumulation of active GTP-bound Rho. The ability to elicit Rho activation correlated with the markedly higher efficacy of thrombin and LPA, relative to carbachol, as ATP secretagogues. Clostridium difficile toxin B and Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme, which inhibit Rho-GTPases, attenuated the thrombin- and LPA-stimulated ATP release but did not decrease carbachol-stimulated release. Thus the ability of certain G(q)-coupled receptors to additionally stimulate Rho-GTPases acts to strongly potentiate a Ca(2+)-activated ATP release pathway. However, pharmacological inhibition of Rho kinase I/II or myosin light chain kinase did not attenuate ATP release. PAR1-induced ATP release was also reduced twofold by brefeldin treatment suggesting the possible mobilization of Golgi-derived, ATP-containing secretory vesicles. ATP release was also markedly repressed by the gap junction channel inhibitor carbenoxolone in the absence of any obvious thrombin-induced change in membrane permeability indicative of hemichannel gating.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) can lead to tumor regression when injected locally or when used in an isolated limb perfusion, and it can enhance the tumoricidal effect of various therapies. TNF-alpha can also up-regulate adhesion molecules, and thus, facilitate the binding of leukocytes to normal vessels. The present study was designed to investigate the extent to which the host leukocytes roll and adhere to vessels of different tumors (MCaIV, a murine mammary adenocarcinoma; HGL21, a human malignant astrocytoma) at a given site or to the same tumor at different sites (dorsal skin and cranium), in different mouse strains [C3H and severe combined immunodeficient (SCID)], both with and without TNF-alpha-activation. There was no significant difference in hemodynamic parameters such as RBC velocity, diameter, or shear rate between PBS-treated control groups and corresponding TNF-alpha-treated groups. Under PBS control conditions, the leukocyte rolling count in MCaIV tumor vessels in the dorsal chamber in C3H and SCID mice and in the cranial window in C3H mice was significantly lower than that in normal vessels (P < 0.05), but stable cell adhesion was similar between normal and tumor vessels. TNF-alpha led to an increase (P < 0.05) in leukocyte-endothelial interaction in vessels in the following cases: normal tissue regardless of sites and strains, MCaIV tumor in the cranial window in C3H mice, and HGL21 tumor in the cranial window in SCID mice. However, the increase in rolling and adhesion in the MCaIV tumor in response to TNF-alpha was significantly lower than in the corresponding normal vessels (P < 0.05) in the dorsal chamber in C3H and SCID mice and in the cranial window in C3H mice. The HGL21 tumor in the cranial window in SCID mice showed leukocyte rolling and adhesion comparable to that in normal pial vessels. These findings suggest that (a) in general, basal leukocyte rolling is lower in tumor vessels than in normal vessels; (b) leukocyte rolling and adhesion in tumors can be enhanced by TNF-alpha-mediated activation; and (c) the TNF-alpha response is dependent on tumor type, transplantation site, and host strain. These results have significant implications in the gene therapy of cancer using TNF-alpha-gene-transfected cancer cells or lymphocytes.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's disease (LP-HD), particularly that with a nodular pattern has been suggested to constitute a distinct disorder within the spectrum of Hodgkin's disease, this issue being based on clinical, morphological and immunological observations. Furthermore, the nodular LP-HD (N-LP-HD) has been considered to differ from the diffuse subtype (D-LP-HD), although the data are conflicting. The question addressed in this study was whether the clinical course of N-LP-HD differs from that of the D-LP-HD as well as the other subtypes of Hodgkin's disease.;90 cases diagnosed as LP-HD at St. Bartholomew's Hospital (SBH) were reviewed. The histopathological classification was based on the original Lukes and Butler criteria for classical N-LP-HD. Clinical data were retrieved from case notes and a computer database. Stage was determined by the Ann Arbor criteria. Survival and remission duration analyses were performed for the group of patients with N-LP-HD and compared with an histological control group of patients with the other subtypes of Hodgkin's disease and the cases of LP-HD that have been reclassified.;1. 50/90 cases (56%) originally diagnosed as N-LP-HD qualified as N-LP-HD. No case with the diffuse subtype, could be identified. Twenty-three percent of the cases were reclassified as Mixed Cellularity and 11% as Nodular Sclerosis HD, whilst 10% as non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. 2. The majority of cases (78%) presented with early stage (I + II). Bone marrow and liver involvement were rare. 3. 92% of cases achieved complete remission. Recurrence developed in only 6/46 patients within 5-12 years. A second complete remission was achieved in 5/6 (83%) cases. Further recurrences have not yet occurred. 4. The overall survival of the 50 cases with N-LP-HD was 92% at 4 years and did not differ significantly from the 40 cases that have been reclassified. Remission duration however, was significantly better for the group of N-LP-HD being 81% at 12 years. 5. Second malignancies were common and developed in 6/50 cases (12%) with N-LP-HD within 10-15 years. These included: ALL (1 case), high grade B-NHL (2 cases), squamous cell carcinoma (1 case), glioma (1 case), lung carcinoma (1 case). 6. 12/50 patients died within a period of follow-up, up to 21 years. 1/3 of the deaths was attributed to the development of second malignancy.;The diffuse variant of LP-HD is rare, having not been seen at St. Bartholomew's Hospital during this time period. The 50 cases with N-LP-HD showed a favourable course with presentation at an early stage, good response to treatment, late recurrences and remission duration other than the other subtypes of HD. The latter could be attributable to the early stage at presentation of N-LP-HD, since the remission duration on a matching on stage analysis was superficially better in favour of N-LP-HD (p = 0.06). The indolent course of the disease in combination with the risk of second malignancy cases raises the question whether histology should be taken into consideration in the development of new protocols for HD.",
