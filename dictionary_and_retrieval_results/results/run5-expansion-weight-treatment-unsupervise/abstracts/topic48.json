Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) inhibits several protein-tyrosine kinases, including c-kit. We therefore hypothesized that Imatinib may be an effective drug in patients with locally advanced or metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma and conducted a phase 2 trial in order to study this. Patients with locally advanced or metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma and c-kit positive tumours were eligible. Fourteen patients were screened and 10 patients (71%) with c-kit positive tumours entered the study. Treatment was begun at a dose of Imatinib of 400mg/day. Dose escalation was allowed in the absence of toxicity. The dose was increased to 600mg/d in three patients and 800mg/d in one patient. Three patients required dose reduction to 300mg/d, due to grade 3 toxicity. No grade 4 toxicity was seen. No objective responses were seen. Two patients (20%) exhibited stable disease for 11 and 14 months, respectively. All other patients stopped treatment after 2-14 (median 6) months due to progressive disease.

Thus, a novel effective therapy is needed against metastatic ACC. A majority of ACCs (up to 94%) express c-kit. Imatinib is monoclonal antibody with specific activity against c-kit but has not been found to be effective in treating patients with ACC in which c-kit is overexpressed and activated. The NF-κB and mTOR pathways have been shown that ubiquitously and concurrently activated, indicating that the inhibition of these pathways may represent a novel treatment approach for patients with ACC. Curcumin has been shown to inhibit NF-κB and NF-κB-related pathways. 43-year-old patient was diagnosed ACC from submandibular salivary gland. After complete resection of tumor adjuvant radiotherapy was initiated. Seven years later multiple lung metastases were detected and ACC was confirmed by re-biopsy. First-line chemotherapy failed. NF-κB and c-kit were overexpressed in the metastatic specimens. Therefore, we treated the patient with metastatic chemoresistant ACC with imatinib 400mg/day and intravenous curcumin 225mg/m(2) twice a week plus oral bioavailable curcumin Arantal(®) 2×84mg/day. At 24 months, we observed near complete anatomic and complete metabolic response.

        "Doc_abstract":"Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is an aggressive malignant neoplasm of the salivary glands in which c-Kit is overexpressed and activated, although the mechanism for this is as yet unclear. We analyzed 27 sporadic ACC tumor specimens to examine the biologic and clinical significance of c-Kit activation. Mutational analysis revealed expression of wild-type c-Kit in all, eliminating gene mutation as a cause of activation. Because stem cell factor (SCF) is c-Kit's sole ligand, we analyzed its expression in the tumor cells and their environment. Immunohistochemistry revealed its presence in c-Kit-positive tumor cells, suggesting an activation of autocrine signaling. We observed a significant induction of ERK1/2 in the cells. SCF staining was also found in other types of non-cancerous cells adjacent to tumors within salivary glands, including stromal fibroblasts, neutrophils, peripheral nerve, skeletal muscle, vascular endothelial cells, mucous acinar cells, and intercalated ducts. Quantitative PCR showed that the top quartile of c-Kit mRNA expression distinguished ACCs from normal salivary tissues and was cross-correlated with short-term poor prognosis. Expression levels of SCF and c-Kit were highly correlated in the cases with perineural invasion. These observations suggest that c-Kit is potentially activated by receptor dimerization upon stimulation by SCF in ACC, and that the highest quartile of c-Kit mRNA expression could be a predictor of poor prognosis. Our findings may support an avenue for c-Kit-targeted therapy to improve disease control in ACC patients harboring the top quartile of c-Kit mRNA expression. ",

This study reports an opposite finding: we have found strong evidence that the MAPK pathway is inhibited in a subset of adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACCs) of the salivary glands. ACC tumors consistently overexpress the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) c-Kit, which has been considered a therapeutic target. We performed mutational analysis of the c-Kit gene (KIT in 17 cases of ACC and found that 2 cases of ACC had distinct missense mutations in KIT at both the genomic DNA and messenger RNA levels. These mutations caused G664R and R796G amino acid substitutions in the kinase domains. Surprisingly, the mutations were functionally inactive in cultured cells. We observed a significant reduction of MAPK (ERK1/2) activity in tumor cells, as assessed by immunohistochemistry. We performed further mutational analysis of the downstream effectors in the c-Kit pathway in the genes HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, and PTEN. This analysis revealed that two ACC tumors without KIT mutations had missense mutations in either KRAS or BRAF, causing S17N K-Ras and V590I B-Raf mutants, respectively. Our functional analysis showed that proteins with these mutations were also inactive in cultured cells. This is the first time that MAPK activity from the RTK signaling has been shown to be inhibited by gene mutations during tumor development. Because ACC seems to proliferate despite inactivation of the c-Kit signaling pathway, we suggest that selective inhibition of c-Kit is probably not a suitable treatment strategy for ACC.",

According to this new biological classification, the objectives of our study were to assess the clinical, morphologic and immunophenotypic characteristics of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast in order to classify this subtype of breast carcinoma. A total of 18 cases of adenoid cystic carcinoma were identified from the Institut Curie files. Clinical information was available for 16 patients with a median follow-up of 6.5 years. Morphologically, all tumors were graded according to the system defined by Kleer and Oberman (histologic and nuclear grade). Immunophenotype was assessed with anti-ER, PR, HER-2, KIT, basal (CK5/6) and luminal cytokeratins (CK8/18) and p63 antibodies. One out of 18 tumors was nuclear grade 1 (16%), nine were nuclear grade 2 (50%) and eight were nuclear grade 3 (44%). All cases were estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER-2 negative. Epithelial cells were strongly positive around glandular lumina with one or both cytokeratins, identifying the coexistence of CK5/6+ cells, CK5/6 and CK8/18+ cells, CK8/18+ cells and p63+ cells. All cases (100%) were also KIT positive. In all, 15 patients were treated by surgery. Nine of them received adjuvant radiotherapy. Follow-up was available for 16 patients. In all, 14 patients were alive. Two of them, initially treated by surgery only, presented a local recurrence. Two patients died (one of them treated by radiation therapy only died from her disease). Our study shows that adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast is a special, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER-2 negative and highly KIT-positive, basal-like breast carcinoma, associated with an excellent prognosis. This highly specific immunophenotype could be useful to differentiate adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast from other subtypes of breast carcinoma such as cribriform carcinoma.",

Unfortunately, there are other rare histologic types of head and neck cancer such as adenocarcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma. The latter has traditionally been considered to be chemotherapy resistant and surgical resection with or without adjuvant radiation therapy has been the rule as far as treatment is concerned. The course of adenoid cystic carcinoma ranges from indolent to aggressive; however, most patients succumb to the disease as a result of distant metastases. This clinical scenario poses a challenge to oncologists. Several conventional chemotherapy regimens and novel targeted agents have been tried in this rare histologic subtype without success.;In this case report, we present a 59-year-old Caucasian female with refractory adenoid cystic carcinoma of the maxilla metastatic to the lung that responded to sorafenib, a novel multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which targets angiogenesis, Raf kinase pathway, platelet-derived growth factor Ret, and c-Kit.;This case illustrates the possibility that this chemoresistant tumor may need the inhibition or blocking of several oncogenic pathways.

Oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization has been applied for cataloging genomic copy number alterations (CNAs) in 17 frozen salivary or bronchial tumors. Only four whole chromosome CNAs were found, and most cases had 2-4 segmental CNAs. No high level amplification was observed. There were recurrent gains at 7p15.2, 17q21-25, and 22q11-13, and recurrent losses at 1p35, 6q22-25, 8q12-13, 9p21, 12q12-13, and 17p11-13. The minimal region of gain at 7p15.2 contained the HOXA cluster. The minimal common regions of deletions contained the CDKN2A/CDKN2B, TP53, and LIMA1 tumor suppressor genes. The recurrent deletion at 8q12.3-13.1 contained no straightforward tumor suppressor gene, but the MIRN124A2 microRNA gene, whose product regulates MMP2 and CDK6. Among unique CNAs, gains harbored CCND1, KIT/PDGFRA/KDR, MDM2, and JAK2. The CNAs involving CCND1, MDM2, KIT, CDKN2A/2B, and TP53 were validated by FISH and/or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Although most tumors overexpressed cyclin D1 compared with surrounding glands, the only case to overexpress MDM2 had the corresponding CNA. In conclusion, our report suggests that ACC is characterized by a relatively low level of structural complexity. Array CGH and immunohistochemical data implicate MDM2 as the oncogene targeted at 12q15. The gain at 4q12 warrants further exploration as it contains a cluster of receptor kinase genes (KIT/PDGFRA/KDR), whose products can be responsive to specific therapies.",

We conducted a phase II study to determine the antitumor activity of dasatinib in ACC and non-ACC MSGT.;In a two-stage design, patients with progressive, recurrent/metastatic ACC (+cKIT) and non-ACC MSGT (separate cohort) were treated with dasatinib 70 mg p.o. b.i.d. Response was assessed every 8 weeks using RECIST.;Of 54 patients: 40 ACC, 14 non-ACC (1, ineligible excluded); M:F = 28 : 26, median age 56 years (range 20-82 years), ECOG performance status 0 : 1 : 2 = 24 : 28 : 2, prior radiation: 44, prior chemotherapy: 21. The most frequent adverse events (AEs) (as % of patients, worst grade 2 or higher) were: fatigue (28%), nausea (19%), headache (15%), lymphopenia (7%), dyspnea (11%), alanine aminotransferase increased (7%), anorexia (7%), vomiting (7%), alkaline phosphatase increased (6%), diarrhea (6%), neutropenia (6%), and noncardiac chest pain (6%). No grade 4 AE occurred, 15 patients experienced a grade 3 AE, primarily dyspnea (5) and fatigue (4), and cardiac toxicity (1 prolonged QTc). Among ACC patients, best response to dasatinib: 1 patient (2.5%) had partial response, 20 patients (50%) had stable disease (SD) (3-14 months), 12 patients (30%) had PD, 2 withdrew, 3 discontinued therapy due to AE, and 2 died before cycle 2. Median progression-free survival was 4.8 months. Median overall survival was 14.5 months. For 14 assessable non-ACC patients, none had objective response, triggering early stopping rule. Seven had SD (range 1-7 months), 4 PD, 2 discontinued therapy due to AE, and 1 died before cycle 2.;Although there was only one objective response, dasatinib is well tolerated, with tumor stabilization achieved by 50% of ACC patients.

The amplification status of HER-2/neu was also investigated by means of fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis on fixed material. The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-deregulated profile of the SDCs was characterized by the overexpression of activated TRK-A in the presence of its ligand, and the overexpression of HER-2/neu sustained by gene amplification. The RTK signature of the ACCs was represented by the overexpression of activated KIT and TRK-A and their cognate ligands, and the overexpression of activated HER-2/neu, in the absence of gene amplification, possibly sustained by epidermal growth factor receptor heterodimerization. In conclusion, SDCs and ACCs, although sharing TRK-A autocrine loop activation, have different pathologically activated RTK-deregulated profiles that may be potential targets for pharmacological RTK inhibitors.",

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) express KIT and respond favorably to imatinib therapy. To determine other tumors in which such a molecular targeted therapy might be indicated, we investigated KIT expression in different human tumor types. Because recent studies in GISTs suggest that KIT-activating mutations predict response to imatinib therapy, we also sequenced a subset of positive tumors.;More than 3,000 tumors from more than 120 different tumor categories were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in a tissue microarray format. Seven commercially available anti-KIT antibodies were initially evaluated. The antibody A4502 (DAKO) was selected for analysis because of a high frequency of positivity in GIST and low staining background in other tissues. To determine the frequency of KIT mutations in various tumor types, the exons 2, 8, 9, 11, 13, and 17 (where mutations previously were reported) were sequenced in 36 tumors with strong KIT expression.;KIT positivity was detected in 28 of 28 GISTs (100%), 42 of 50 seminomas (84%), 34 of 52 adenoid-cystic carcinomas (65%), 14 of 39 malignant melanomas (35%), and eight of 47 large-cell carcinomas of the lung (17%), as well as in 47 additional tumor types.

Eighty-six cases of STACC included 45 females and 41 males, aged 12-91 years (mean 54.4 years). Patients presented most frequently with obstructive symptoms (n = 54), followed by epistaxis (n = 23), auditory symptoms (n = 12), nerve symptoms (n = 11), nasal discharge (n = 11), and/or visual symptoms (n = 10), present for a mean of 18.2 months. The tumors involved the nasal cavity alone (n = 25), nasopharynx alone (n = 13), maxillary sinus alone (n = 4), or a combination of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses (n = 44), with a mean size of 3.7 cm. Patients presented equally between low and high stage disease: stage I and II (n = 42) or stage III and IV (n = 44) disease. Histologically, the tumors were invasive (bone: n = 66; neural: n = 47; lymphovascular: n = 33), composed of a variety of growth patterns, including cribriform (n = 33), tubular (n = 16), and solid (n = 9), although frequently a combination of these patterns was seen within a single tumor. Pleomorphism was mild with an intermediate N:C ratio in cells containing hyperchromatic nuclei. Reduplicated basement membrane and glycosaminoglycan material was commonly seen. Necrosis (n = 16) and atypical mitotic figures (n = 11) were infrequently present. Pleomorphic adenoma was present in 9 cases; de-differentiation was seen in two patients. Immunohistochemical studies showed positive reactions for pan-cytokeratin, CK7, CK5/6, CAM5.2, and EMA, with myoepithelial reactivity with SMA, p63, calponin, S100 protein and SMMHC. CD117, CEA, GFAP and p16 were variably present. CK20 and HR HPV were negative. STACC needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of most sinonasal malignancies, particularly poorly differentiated carcinoma, olfactory neuroblastoma and pleomorphic adenoma. Surgery (n = 82), often accompanied by radiation therapy (n = 36), was generally employed. A majority of patients developed a recurrence (n = 52) 2-144 months after initial presentation. Overall mean follow-up was 19.4 years (range 0.4-37.5 years): 46 patients died with disease (mean 6.4 years); 5 were alive with disease (mean 5.4 years), and 35 patients were either alive or had died of unrelated causes (mean 16.3 years). ACC of the SNT is uncommon. Recurrences are common. The following parameters, when present, suggest an increased incidence of either recurrence or dying with disease: mixed site of involvement, high stage disease (stage IV), skull base involvement, tumor recurrence, a solid histology, perineural invasion, bone invasion, and lymphovascular invasion.",

Compared to BCA without capsular invasion, the BCACs and BCAs with capsular invasion were more likely to be larger and have solid or cribriform patterns. Most BCACs and BCAs exhibited nuclear β-catenin expression. In all basal cell neoplasm cases, the clinical course after surgery with or without radiotherapy was indolent. β-catenin, CK5/6, CD117, and S100P protein were helpful for differentiating basal cell neoplasms from ACC.;BCAs with capsular invasion shared several pathological features with BCACs, including a large size and frequent cribriform patterns but the malignant potential of these tumors seems highly limited and should be reexamined. β-catenin immunostaining may aid the differential diagnosis between basal cell neoplasms and ACCs.;The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/9637819101988153.",

We evaluated the expression of ERBB2, KIT, androgen receptor, PTEN, EGFR, ERG, and p53 via immunohistochemistry. We also examined EGFR amplification and TMPRSS2-ERG gene rearrangement by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The mean clinical follow-up was 44 months. We found that basal cell carcinoma behaved aggressively with almost one-half of the cases displaying high-risk pathologic features or local recurrence (44%). One patient died as a result of metastatic disease. The most consistent abnormalities included a loss of PTEN expression (56% of cases) and EGFR overexpression (67% of cases). EGFR overexpression occurred in the absence of gene amplification. The TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement was not detected in any of the tumors studied, nor was ERG protein positivity identified by immunostaining. In addition, ERBB2, KIT, p53, and androgen receptor expressions were either absent or showed only weak, limited reactivity. Our results suggest that there is a high morbidity associated with this tumor, and more intense follow-up and additional treatment may be indicated. Furthermore, targeted therapies directed against the EGFR and PTEN proteins or their constitutive pathways may be promising for future clinical management. ",

We categorized recipients with acute persistent rejection if they had 2 consecutive biopsy specimens at >/=Grade A2 despite anti-rejection treatment. We performed cytokine genotyping using the polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific primers technique, with a commercially available kit.;We analyzed the IL-10 genotype in 116 patients. For the increased IL-10 production genotype, 7 of 20 patients (35%) were persistent rejecters. In comparison, 57 of 96 patients (59%) with intermediate or decreased IL-10 production genotype had acute persistent rejection (p = 0.046). For IL-10 haplotypes associated with intermediate IL-10 production, 30 of 45 patients with GCC/ACC haplotype (67%) had acute persistent rejection compared with 10 of 22 patients with GCC/ATA (45%).

The intermediate IL-10 production genotype in lung transplant recipients can be differentiated into 2 haplotype responses, with the GCC/ACC haplotype associated more with acute persistent rejection. In lung transplant recipients, the immunomodulatory effects of IL-6 are differentiated in the G/C and G/G alleles in conjunction with IL-10 haplotypes, with G/C being associated with more acute persistent rejection in conjunction with the IL-10 GCC/ACC haplotype.

In this study, we examined BDNF as a peripheral and NAA as a central biomarker over the time course of antidepressant treatment to specify both of their roles in the response to the medication and clinical outcome.;We examined serum BDNF (ELISA kit) in a sample of 76 (47 female and 29 male) depressed patients in a naturalistic setting. BDNF was assessed before medication and subsequently after two, four and six weeks of antidepressant treatment. Additionally, in fifteen patients, N-acetylaspartate (NAA) was measured in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Over a time course of six weeks BDNF and NAA were also examined in a group of 41 healthy controls.;We found significant lower serum BDNF concentrations in depressed patients compared to the sample of healthy volunteers before and after medication. BDNF and clinical symptoms decreased significantly in the patients over the time course of antidepressant treatment. Serum BDNF levels at baseline predicted the symptom outcome after eight weeks. Specifically, responders and remitters had lower serum BDNF at baseline than the nonresponders and nonremitters. NAA was slightly decreased but not significantly lower in depressed patients when compared with healthy controls. During treatment period, NAA showed a tendency to increase.;A relative high drop-out rate and possibly, a suboptimal observation period for BDNF.;Our data confirm serum BDNF as a biomarker of depression with a possible role in response prediction. However, our findings argue against serum BDNF increase being a prerequisite to depressive symptom reduction.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disease that is strongly associated with obesity and dysregulation of insulin in the liver. However, currently no pharmacological agents have been established for the treatment of NAFLD. In this regard, we sought to evaluate the anti-NAFLD effects of Aralia elata (Miq) Seem (AE) extract and its ability to inhibit hepatic lipid accumulation and modulate cellular signaling in a high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mouse model.;A model of hepatic steatosis in the HepG2 cells was induced by oleic acid. Intracellular lipid droplets were detected by Oil-Red-O staining, and the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1(SREBP-1), Fatty acid synthase (FAS), Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) 1 and 2, Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-α (PPARα), and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1(CPT-1) was analyzed by real time reverse transcription-Polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). And glucose consumption was measured with commercial kit. Furthermore, Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed with HFD to induce NAFLD. Groups of mice were given plant extracts orally at 100 and 300 mg/kg at daily for 4 weeks. After 3 weeks of AE extract treatment, we performed oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Liver tissue was procured for histological examination, Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) activity.;In the present study, AE extract was shown to reduce hepatic lipid accumulation and significantly downregulate the level of lipogenic genes and upregulate the expression of lipolysis genes in HepG2 cells. And also, AE extract significantly increased the glucose consumption, indicating that AE extract improved insulin resistance. Subsequently, we confirmed the inhibitory activity of AE extract on NAFLD, in vivo. Treatment with AE extract significantly decreased body weight and the fasting glucose level, alleviated hyperinsulinism and hyperlipidemia, and reduced glucose levels, as determined by OGTT. Additionally, AE extract decreased PI3K and Akt activity.;Our results suggest that treatment with AE extract ameliorated NAFLD by inhibiting insulin resistance through activation of the Akt/GLUT4 pathway.",
