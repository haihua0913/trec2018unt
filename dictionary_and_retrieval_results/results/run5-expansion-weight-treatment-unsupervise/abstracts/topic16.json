        "Doc_abstract":"Activated ALK and ROS1 tyrosine kinases, resulting from chromosomal rearrangements, occur in a subset of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) as well as other tumor types and their oncogenic relevance as actionable targets has been demonstrated by the efficacy of selective kinase inhibitors such as crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib. More recently, low-frequency rearrangements of TRK kinases have been described in NSCLC, colorectal carcinoma, glioblastoma, and Spitzoid melanoma. Entrectinib, whose discovery and preclinical characterization are reported herein, is a novel, potent inhibitor of ALK, ROS1, and, importantly, of TRK family kinases, which shows promise for therapy of tumors bearing oncogenic forms of these proteins. Proliferation profiling against over 200 human tumor cell lines revealed that entrectinib is exquisitely potent in vitro against lines that are dependent on the drug's pharmacologic targets. Oral administration of entrectinib to tumor-bearing mice induced regression in relevant human xenograft tumors, including the TRKA-dependent colorectal carcinoma KM12, ROS1-driven tumors, and several ALK-dependent models of different tissue origins, including a model of brain-localized lung cancer metastasis. Entrectinib is currently showing great promise in phase I/II clinical trials, including the first documented objective responses to a TRK inhibitor in colorectal carcinoma and in NSCLC. The drug is, thus, potentially suited to the therapy of several molecularly defined cancer settings, especially that of TRK-dependent tumors, for which no approved drugs are currently available.

        "Doc_abstract":"Melanoma is a highly aggressive skin tumor that originates in the epidermis from melanocytes. As melanocytes share with the nervous system a common neuroectodermal origin and express all neurotrophins (NTs), we evaluated the expression and function of NTs and their receptors in melanoma. We report that primary and metastatic melanoma cell lines synthesize and secrete all NTs. Moreover, melanoma cells express the low-affinity (p75NTR) and the high-affinity tyrosine kinase NT receptors (Trk). The inhibition of Trk receptors by either K252a or Trk/Fc chimeras prevents proliferation, indicating that autocrine NTs are responsible for this effect. NT-3, NT-4, and nerve growth factor (NGF) induce cell migration, with a stronger effect on metastatic cell lines. Transfection with p75NTR small interfering RNA (p75NTRsiRNA) or treatment with K252a inhibits NT-induced melanoma cell migration, indicating that both the low- and high-affinity NT receptors mediate this effect. All melanoma cell lines express the p75NTR coreceptor sortilin by which proNGF stimulates migration in melanoma cells, but not in cells transfected with p75NTRsiRNA. These results indicate that NTs, through their receptors, play a critical role in the progression of melanoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Histopathological evaluation of melanocytic tumours usually allows reliable distinction of benign melanocytic naevi from melanoma. More difficult is the histopathological classification of Spitz tumours, a heterogeneous group of tumours composed of large epithelioid or spindle-shaped melanocytes. Spitz tumours are biologically distinct from conventional melanocytic naevi and melanoma, as exemplified by their distinct patterns of genetic aberrations. Whereas common acquired naevi and melanoma often harbour BRAF mutations, NRAS mutations, or inactivation of NF1, Spitz tumours show HRAS mutations, inactivation of BAP1 (often combined with BRAF mutations), or genomic rearrangements involving the kinases ALK, ROS1, NTRK1, BRAF, RET, and MET. In Spitz naevi, which lack significant histological atypia, all of these mitogenic driver aberrations trigger rapid cell proliferation, but after an initial growth phase, various tumour suppressive mechanisms stably block further growth. In some tumours, additional genomic aberrations may abrogate various tumour suppressive mechanisms, such as cell-cycle arrest, telomere shortening, or DNA damage response. The melanocytes then start to grow in a less organised fashion and may spread to regional lymph nodes, and are termed atypical Spitz tumours. Upon acquisition of even more aberrations, which often activate additional oncogenic pathways or alter cell differentiation, the neoplastic cells become entirely malignant and may colonise and take over distant organs (spitzoid melanoma). The sequential acquisition of genomic aberrations suggests that Spitz tumours represent a continuous biological spectrum, rather than a dichotomy of benign versus malignant, and that tumours with ambiguous histological features (atypical Spitz tumours) might be best classified as low-grade melanocytic tumours. The number of genetic aberrations usually correlates with the degree of histological atypia and explains why existing ancillary genetic techniques, such as array comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) or fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), are usually capable of accurately classifying histologically benign and malignant Spitz tumours, but are not very helpful in the diagnosis of ambiguous melanocytic lesions. Nevertheless, we expect that progress in our understanding of tumour progression will refine the classification of spitzoid melanocytic tumours in the near future. By integrating clinical, pathological, and genetic criteria, distinct tumour subsets will be defined within the heterogeneous group of Spitz tumours, which will eventually lead to improvements in diagnosis, prognosis and therapy.

We have previously reported that NT treatment of murine and human brain-metastatic melanoma cells affects their invasive capacities and increases the production of extracellular-matrix degradative enzymes. These cells express aberrant levels of functional p75(NTR) and TrkC, the putative high-affinity receptor for the neurotrophin NT-3. Here we demonstrate that, by using sensitive immune-complex kinase assays in human brain-metastatic (70W) melanoma cells, TrkC receptors associate with a kinase activity exhibiting a dose-dependent susceptibility to inhibition by the purine-analogs 6-thioguanine and 2-aminopurine. The activity of this purine-analog-sensitive kinase (PASK) was induced by NT-3 in a time-dependent fashion, phosphorylating exogenous myelin basic protein (MBP) but not denatured enolase. It is similar to the one reported to relate with p75(NTR) and TrkA receptors and stimulated by the prototypic NT, nerve growth factor. Thus, PASKs may represent unique signaling components common to NT receptors that could engage joint downstream signaling effectors in brain-metastatic melanoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Although chemotherapeutic drugs could theoretically target all metastatic sites, current treatments do not provide complementary therapeutics. Therefore, the development of an alternative approach replacing the traditional therapy is urgently needed. To assess the killing efficiency of the functionally identified apoptosis-related protein (APR)-1 in melanoma cells, we established a system for the regulated expression of APR-1. The induction of APR-1 expression caused apoptosis of melanoma cells via the interaction with the juxtamembrane region of p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), and possible also via the competition with tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF6) and the catalytic receptor of neurotrophin (Trk) for the same p75NTR interacting site. The accumulation of APR-1 in melanoma cells may block the physical association of p75NRT with TRAF6 and/or Trk, leading to the disruption of both NF-ÎºB and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways. Also, accumulation of APR-1 protein enhanced the activity of both c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 pathways. However, the analysis of APR-1-modulated pathways demonstrated the involvement of apoptosis-regulating kinase 1-JNK/p38 pathway in the induction of Bax expression leading to both mitochondrial dysregulation [as demonstrated by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, the release of both cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor into cytoplasm, and cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)] and endoplasmic reticulum stress as demonstrated by the increase of intracellular Ca(2+)  release. Thus, besides the analysis of its pro-apoptotic function, our data provide insight into the molecular mechanism of APR-1-induced apoptosis of melanoma cells.",

Each type of tumor investigated had specific pattern of analyzed genetic alterations. The most prominent genetic changes were mutual alterations in PTEN and p53 tumor suppressors present in breast cancer and two melanomas. These co-alterations could be crucial for promoting development of multiple malignancies. Moreover the insertion in 4(th) codon of HRAS gene was common for all tumor types investigated.
