Although many FLT3 inhibitors have been subjected to clinical trials, their clinical efficacies for AML seem unimpressive, and several problems regarding adverse effects and resistant mechanism are apparent.

When the FLT3 inhibitor is used prior to chemotherapy, antagonism is displayed, while if FLT3 inhibition is instituted after to exposure to chemotherapy, synergistic cytotoxicity is seen.

Although FLT3 inhibitors have shown considerable promise for the treatment of AML, they ultimately fail to achieve long-term remissions as monotherapy. To identify genetic targets that can sensitize AML cells to killing by FLT3 inhibitors, we performed a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi)-based screen that identified ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) as being synthetic lethal with FLT3 inhibitor therapy. We found that inactivating ATM or its downstream effector glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) sensitizes AML cells to FLT3 inhibitor induced apoptosis. Examination of the cellular metabolome showed that FLT3 inhibition by itself causes profound alterations in central carbon metabolism, resulting in impaired production of the antioxidant factor glutathione, which was further impaired by ATM or G6PD inactivation. Moreover, FLT3 inhibition elicited severe mitochondrial oxidative stress that is causative in apoptosis and is exacerbated by ATM/G6PD inhibition. The use of an agent that intensifies mitochondrial oxidative stress in combination with a FLT3 inhibitor augmented elimination of AML cells in vitro and in vivo, revealing a therapeutic strategy for the improved treatment of FLT3 mutated AML.",

These observations raise the question about how best to treat patients with AML who have FLT3 mutations.

Oral administration of G-749 yielded complete tumor regression and increased life span in animal models. Thus, G-749 appears to be a promising next-generation drug candidate for the treatment of relapsed and refractory AML patients with various FLT3-ITD/FLT3-TKD mutants and further shows the ability to overcome drug resistance.

Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of the wild-type (wt) Flt3 receptor tyrosine kinase collaborates with NUP98-HOX fusions (NUP98-HOXA10 and NUP98-HOXD13) to induce aggressive acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We used a mouse transplantation model to show their synergism in cotransduced bone marrow cells as well as in a cellular model of leukemic progression. Furthermore, our data support the finding that Meis1 overexpression leads to marked elevation in Flt3 transcription and extend it to the context of NUP98-HOX-induced leukemia. Together, these results support a multistep model where the synergism between NUP98-HOX and wt-Flt3 is the result of the ability of Flt3 to increase proliferation of myeloid progenitors blocked in differentiation by NUP98-HOX fusions and reveal a direct role for wt-Flt3 in the pathobiology of AML. Given the similarities in the leukemogenic role of native HOX and NUP98-fused HOX genes, our results underscore the clinical significance of the recurrent co-overexpression of wt-FLT3 and HOX in human leukemia and suggest that specific FLT3 inhibitors could be useful in treatment of HOX-induced AML or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).",

N-benzoyl staurosporine (PKC412), a highly effective inhibitor of mutated FLT3 receptors, has significant antileukemic efficacy in patients with FLT3-mutated AML. Mutation screening of FLT3 exon 20 in AML patients (n = 110) revealed 2 patients with a novel mutation (Y842C) within the highly conserved activation loop of FLT3. FLT3-Y842C-transfected 32D cells showed constitutive FLT3 tyrosine phosphorylation and interleukin 3 (IL-3)-independent growth. Treatment with PKC412 led to inhibition of proliferation and apoptotic cell death. Primary AML blasts bearing FLT3-Y842C mutations showed constitutive FLT3 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT-5) tyrosine phosphorylation. Ex vivo PKC412 treatment of primary blasts resulted in suppression of constitutive FLT3 and STAT-5 activation and apoptotic cell death. Inspection of the FLT3 structure revealed that Y842 is the key residue in regulating the switch from the closed to the open (= active) conformation of the FLT3 activation loop. Overall, our data suggest that mutations at Y842 represent a significant new activating mutation in AML blasts. Since FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as PKC412 are currently being investigated in clinical trials in AML, extended sequence analysis of FLT3 may be helpful in defining the spectrum of TKI-sensitive FLT3 mutations in AML.",

FLT3 is a promising candidate for targeted therapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), because activating mutations occur in up to 30% of patients. We conducted an innovative single-dose clinical study with a primary objective to demonstrate inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation by SU11248 in AML.;Twenty-nine AML patients each received a single dose of SU11248, escalated from 50 to 350 mg, in increments of 50 mg and cohorts of three to six patients. FLT3 phosphorylation and plasma pharmacokinetics were evaluated at seven time points over 48 h after SU11248 administration, and FLT3 genotype was determined.

We searched for mechanisms of resistance in 6 patients with AML who had relapses upon PKC412 treatment. In an index AML patient, an algorithm of analyses was applied using clinical material. In vivo and in vitro investigation of primary blasts at relapse revealed persistent TK phosphorylation of FLT3 despite sufficient PKC412 serum levels. Through additional molecular analyses, we identified a single amino acid substitution at position 676 (N676K) within the FLT3 kinase domain as the sole cause of resistance to PKC412 in this patient. Reconstitution experiments expressing the N676K mutant in 32D cells demonstrated that FLT3-ITD-N676K was sufficient to confer an intermediate level of resistance to PKC412 in vitro.

In MV4;11 cells, pharmacological inhibition of either FLT3 or MEK1 leads to granulocytic differentiation. Differentiation of MV4;11 cells was also observed when C/EBPalpha mutated at serine 21 to alanine (S21A) was stably expressed. In contrast, there was no effect when serine 21 was mutated to aspartate (S21D), which mimics phosphorylation of C/EBPalpha. Thus, our results suggest that therapies targeting the MEK/ERK cascade or development of protein therapies based on transduction of constitutively active C/EBPalpha may prove effective in treatment of FLT3 mutant leukemias resistant to the FLT3 inhibitor therapies.",

A number of small molecule inhibitors of FLT3 and/or CDK4/6 are currently under development. A more complete and quantitative understanding of the mechanisms of action of FLT3 and CDK4/6 inhibitors may better inform the development of current and future compounds that act on one or both of the molecular targets, and thus may lead to improved treatments for AML. In this study, we investigated in both subcutaneous and orthotopic AML mouse models, the mechanisms of action of three FLT3 and/or CDK4/6 inhibitors: AMG925 (Amgen), sorafenib (Bayer and Onyx), and quizartinib (Ambit Biosciences). A composite model was developed to integrate the plasma pharmacokinetics of these three compounds on their respective molecular targets, the coupling between the target pathways, as well as the resulting effects on tumor burden reduction in the subcutaneous xenograft model. A sequential modeling approach was used, wherein model structures and estimated parameters from upstream processes (e.g. PK, cellular signaling) were fixed for modeling subsequent downstream processes (cellular signaling, tumor burden). Pooled data analysis was employed for the plasma PK and cellular signaling modeling, while population modeling was applied to the tumor burden modeling. The resulting model allows the decomposition of the relative contributions of FLT3(ITD) and CDK4/6 inhibition on downstream signaling and tumor burden. In addition, the action of AMG925 on cellular signaling and tumor burden was further studied in an orthotopic tumor mouse model more closely representing the physiologically relevant environment for AML.

Abrogation of Axl activation by soluble Axl chimeric protein (Axl-Fc) or small interfering RNA (siRNA) diminishes constitutive FLT3 phosphorylation in FLT3-ITD(+) AML. In addition, inhibition of Axl activation by Axl-Fc interferes with the physical interaction between Axl and FLT3. We found that Axl-Fc, a pharmacologic Axl inhibitor, or siRNA targeting Axl inhibits cell growth, induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis, and relieves a block in myeloid differentiation of FLT3-ITD(+) AML in vitro. Axl-Fc also suppresses the growth of human FLT3-ITD(+) AML in vivo.

Eight were NPM1 mutation positive only, 4 were both NPM1 mutation and FLT3-ITD positive and 4 were FLT3-ITD positive only. A novel point mutation Y572C (c.1715A>G) in exon 14 of FLT3 was also detected. In the group with de novo NK-AML, 40% (12/29) were NPM1 mutation positive whereas NPM1 mutations were observed in 20% (3/15) of secondary NK-AML cases. Sequencing was performed and demonstrated 100% concordance with the HRM results.;HRM is a rapid and efficient method of screening NK-AML samples for both novel and known NPM1 and FLT3 mutations. NPM1 mutations can be observed in both primary and secondary NK-AML cases.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Recently it was shown that, analogous to normal hematopoietic cells, the level of CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR-4) expression on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells correlates with stromal cell derived factor-1 alpha (SDF-1)-induced chemotaxis. As we speculated that an anomalous organ distribution of AML cells could affect cell survival and thus result in an altered fraction surviving chemotherapy, we examined a possible correlation between patient prognosis and CXCR-4 expression in AML patients. We found that patients with a high CXCR-4 expression in the CD34(+) subset had a significantly reduced survival and a higher probability of relapse, resulting in a median relapse-free survival (RFS) of only 8.3 months. CXCR-4 expression was significantly higher in fetal liver tyrosine kinase-3 (Flt3)/internal tandem duplication (ITD) AML than in Flt3/wild-type (wt) AML. Covariate analysis indicated that the prognostic significance of Flt3/ITDs with respect to RFS was no more apparent when analyzed in conjunction with the expression of CXCR-4 in the CD34(+) subset, suggesting that the poor prognosis of Flt3/ITD AML might be subordinate to the increased CXCR-4 expression. Using a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSF-R)-expressing 32D cell line, we observed that SDF-1/CXCR-4 interaction is required for the survival of myeloid differentiating cells, and it also induces a block in G-CSF-induced myeloid differentiation. These data suggest that the SDF-1/CXCR-4 axis may influence therapy responsiveness and defines unfavorable prognosis in AML.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The FLT3 gene is mutated by an internal tandem duplication (ITD) in 20-25% of adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We studied 82 adults <60 years of age with primary AML and normal cytogenetics, who received uniform high-dose therapy and found FLT3 ITD in 23 (28%) patients. When the 23 FLT3 ITD+ cases were compared with the 59 cases with wild-type (WT) FLT3, disease-free survival (DFS) was inferior (P = 0.03), yet overall survival (OS) was not different (P = 0.14). However, 8 (35%) of 23 FLT3 ITD/+ cases also lacked a FLT3 WT allele (FLT3(ITD-R)) as determined by PCR and loss of heterozygosity. Thus, three genotypic groups were identified: normal FLT3(WT/WT), heterozygous FLT3(ITD/WT), and hemizygous FLT3(ITD/-). DFS and OS were significantly inferior for patients with FLT3(ITD/-) (P = 0.0017 and P = 0.0014, respectively). Although DFS and OS for FLT3(WT/WT) and FLT3(ITD/WT) groups did not differ (P = 0.32 and P = 0.98, respectively), OS of the FLT3(ITD/-) group was worse than the FLT3(WT/WT) (P = 0.0005) and FLT3(ITD/WT) (P = 0.008) groups. We propose a model in which FLT3(ITD/-) represents a dominant positive, gain-of-function mutation providing AML cells with a greater growth advantage compared with cells having the FLT3(WT/WT) or FLT3(ITD/WT) genotypes. In conclusion, we have identified the FLT3(ITD/-) genotype as an adverse prognostic factor in de novo AML with normal cytogenetics. A poor prognosis of the relatively young FLT3(ITD/-) adults (median age, 37 years), despite treatment with current dose-intensive regimens, suggests that new treatment modalities, such as therapy with a FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, are clearly needed for this group of patients.",

All FLT3-TKD(+) patients and 85% of FLT3-WT patients achieved a complete remission (P = .13).

In a multivariable analysis, FLT3-TKD was associated with worse DFS (P = .02) independent of NPM1 status and percentage of bone marrow blasts. To gain further biologic insights, a gene-expression signature differentiating FLT3-TKD(+) from FLT3-WT patients was identified. The signature (333 probe sets) included overexpression of VNN1, C3AR1, PTPN6, and multiple other genes involved in monocarboxylate transport activity, and underexpression of genes involved in signal transduction regulation. These associations with outcome, other prognostic markers, and the elucidated expression signature enhance our understanding of FLT3-TKD-associated biology and may lead to development of novel therapies that improve clinical outcome of CN-AML patients with FLT3-TKD.",

Here, we performed extensive analysis of AML engraftment in adult NSG mice using tail vein injection. Of the 35 AML samples analyzed, 66% showed bone marrow engraftment over 0.1%.

Secondary and tertiary recipients showed consistent engraftment, with most showing further AML cell expansion. Engraftment did not correlate with French-American-British subtype or cytogenetic abnormalities. However, samples with FLT3 mutations showed a higher probability of engraftment than FLT3 wild type.

We investigated the interaction of FLT3 and p53 pathways after their simultaneous blockade using the selective FLT3 inhibitor FI-700 and the MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3 in AML. We found that FI-700 immediately reduced antiapoptotic Mcl-1 levels and enhanced Nutlin-induced p53-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis in FLT3/internal tandem duplication cells through the Mcl-1/Noxa axis. FI-700 induced proteasome-mediated degradation of Mcl-1, resulting in the reduced ability of Mcl-1 to sequester proapoptotic Bim. Nutlin-3 induced Noxa, which displaced Bim from Mcl-1. The FI-700/Nutlin-3 combination profoundly activated Bax and induced apoptosis.

Three newer nucleoside analogs, clofarabine, troxacitabine and sapacitabine have been recently investigated in patients with AML. Two methylation inhibitors, 5-azacyticline and decitabine are pyrimidine nucleoside analogs of cytidine which can be incorporated into RNA and/or DNA. Lower doses of these agents are active in AML and have been extensively investigated, especially in secondary AML and AML in elderly patients. Tipifarnib and lonafarnib are orally available farnesyltransferase inhibitors with in vitro and in vivo activity against AML. In recent years, FLT3 inhibitors, lestaurinib, tandutinib and PKC 412 have been developed and tested in AML. The preclinical observations and clinical studies indicate that FLT3 inhibitors are promising agents in the treatment of FLT3 mutated AML patients, especially when used in combinations with chemotherapy.

The complete remission (CR) rate in FLT3-ITD positive patients was 47.6%, which was significantly lower than that in FLT3-wt patients (88.1%, p<0.05). There was no statistical difference in CR rate between FLT3-ITD positive and negative patients in 20 cases of M3; the CR rate in FLT3-ITD positive patients with non M(3) was 37.5 (6/16) which was obviously lower than that in FLT3-wt patients with non M3 (90.6%, 48/53) (p<0.05). 3 FLT3-ITD positive patients with CR relapsed after CR for 14 (2-20) months with relapse rate 50% (3/6) which was higher than that in FLT3-wt patients (29.2%, 14/48). It is concluded that FLT3 mutation is common in AML patients, while FLT3-ITD mutation is more frequent than FLT3-TKD mutation. The AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutation have a poor prognosis, while FLT3-TKD point mutation does not significantly influences prognosis of the patients. Therefore early detection of FLT3 mutation may be important for targeting therapy and evaluating clinical prognosis of AML patients.",

Subjects were 18 patients with de novo AML, in which expression of P-gp, TERT, STAT3, STAT5, and FLT3 was observed in 11, 14, 16, 18, and 14 of patients, respectively. Phosphorylation of STAT3, STAT5, and FLT3 in patients with de novo AML was observed in 10 out of 14, 14 out of 18, and 10 out of 14 patients, respectively. Phosphorylation of STAT5 was associated with expression of both P-gp and TERT, suggesting that STAT5 is one of the transcription factors for these genes. On the other hand, P-gp, TERT, STAT3, STAT5, and FLT3 were expressed in 3, 1, 1, 6, and 1 of the 7 patients with MDS-OL, respectively. While phosphorylation of STAT5 was observed in 4 out of 7 patients, phosphorylation of STAT3 or FLT3 was not detected in all cases examined. Telomere length varied from 2.7 kb to 6.0 kb in de novo AML, accompanied by an increased level of telomerase activity in 4 of 5 patients with de novo AML. In contrast, all MDS-OL cases showed a similar telomere length of 4-5 kb. These results indicate that consideration should be given to the differences of molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of de novo AML and MDS-OL for the treatment strategy of AML.",

Those patients harboring mutations in the FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase have a particularly poor prognosis; however, significant excitement has been generated by the emergence of a variety of targeted inhibitors capable of suppressing FLT3 signaling in vivo. Here we will review results from preclinical studies and early clinical trials evaluating both first- and second-generation FLT3 inhibitors. Early FLT3 inhibitors (including sunitinib, midostaurin, and lestaurtinib) demonstrated significant promise in preclinical models of FLT3 mutant AML. Unfortunately, many of these compounds failed to achieve robust and sustained FLT3 inhibition in early clinical trials, at best resulting in only transient decreases in peripheral blast counts. These results have prompted the development of second-generation FLT3 inhibitors, epitomized by the novel agent quizartinib. These second-generation inhibitors have demonstrated enhanced FLT3 specificity and have been generally well tolerated in early clinical trials. Several FLT3 inhibitors have reached phase III clinical trials, and a variety of phase I/II trials exploring a role for these novel compounds in conjunction with conventional chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are ongoing. Finally, molecular insights provided by FLT3 inhibitors have shed light upon the variety of mechanisms underlying the acquisition of resistance and have provided a rationale supporting the use of combinatorial regimens with other emerging targeted therapies.

Patients were also studied for NPM1, FLT3, MLL, and CEBPA mutations.

Unbiased clustering and correlation showed that homoharringtonine (HHT), also known as omacetaxine mepesuccinate, exhibited preferential antileukemia effect against AML carrying internal tandem duplication of fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3-ITD). It worked synergistically with FLT3 inhibitors to suppress leukemia growth in vitro and in xenograft mouse models. Mechanistically, the effect was mediated by protein synthesis inhibition and reduction of short-lived proteins, including total and phosphorylated forms of FLT3 and its downstream signaling proteins. A phase 2 clinical trial of sorafenib and HHT combination treatment in FLT3-ITD AML patients resulted in complete remission (true or with insufficient hematological recovery) in 20 of 24 patients (83.3%), reduction of ITD allelic burden, and median leukemia-free and overall survivals of 12 and 33 weeks. The regimen has successfully bridged five patients to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and was well tolerated in patients unfit for conventional chemotherapy, including elderly and heavily pretreated patients.

Since mutant FLT3 has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target, there are several FLT3 inhibitors currently undergoing evaluation in different phases of clinical trials. However, although many aspects of the intracellular signaling mediated by oncogenic FLT3 have been revealed, what is the best strategy to inhibit FLT3 and how FLT3 inhibitors should be developed for AML treatment is poorly defined. Despite promising in vitro studies, where most FLT3 inhibitors show potent efficacy at nanomolar concentrations, clinical responses in AML patients are moderate and temporary. Furthermore, under prolonged therapy, FLT3 mutation-positive leukemic cells rapidly develop resistance to FLT3 inhibitors when used as monotherapy. Considering that there is no uniform mechanism of resistance triggered by FLT3 inhibitors, it will be necessary to develop new agents that target FLT3, and that can be used consecutively or in combination with conventional cytotoxic therapeutics. On the other hand, given that overexpression of FLT3 ligand (FL), occurring after myelosuppressive therapy, reduces the efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors, targeting both FL and FLT3 kinase, might be more effective approach in AML treatment.

The classifier consisted of 75 probe sets, representing the top 15 discriminating probe sets for MLL-rearranged, t(8;21)(q22;q22), inv(16)(p13q22), t(15;17)(q21;q22) and t(7;12)(q36;p13)-positive acute myeloid leukemia.;These cytogenetic subtypes represent approximately 40% of cases of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia and were predicted with 92% and 99% accuracy in the discovery and independent validation cohort, respectively. However, for NPM1, CEBPA, MLL(-PTD), FLT3(-ITD), KIT, PTPN11 and N/K-RAS gene expression signatures had limited predictive value. This may be caused by a limited frequency of these mutations and by underlying cytogenetics. This latter is exemplified by the fact that different gene expression signatures were discovered for FLT3-ITD in patients with normal cytogenetics and in those with t(15;17)(q21;q22)-positive acute myeloid leukemia, which pointed to HOXB-upregulation being specific for FLT3-ITD(+) cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia.;In conclusion, gene expression profiling correctly predicted the most prevalent cytogenetic subtypes of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia with high accuracy. In clinical practice, this gene expression signature may replace multiple diagnostic tests for approximately 40% of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia cases whereas only for the remaining cases (predicted as 'acute myeloid leukemia-other') are additional tests indicated.

Sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor, can inhibit FLT3 and improve clinical outcome of FLT3 mutated leukemia. Our current studies have shown that, the antidiabetic drug metformin also exerts anti-leukemic effect by activating p-AMPK and synergistically sensitizes FLT3 mutated AML to sorafenib. Both agents suppress cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and induce apoptosis via cell cycle arrest, but does not obviously modulate autophagy marker, light chain 3 (LC3). Mechanistically, in the presence of metformin, the anticancer potential of sorafenib, accompanying with increased LC3 levels, is found to be synergistically enhanced with the remarkably reduced protein expression of the mTOR/p70S6K/4EBP1 pathway, while not appreciably altering cell cycle. Overall, these results show metformin in aid of sorafenib may represent a promising and attractive strategy for the treatment of FLT3-ITD mutated AML. ",

The C-28 methyl ester of the oleane triterpenoid (CDDO-Me) is a multifunctional molecule that induces apoptosis of human myeloid leukemia cells. Here, we report that CDDO-Me blocks targeting of NFkappaB to the nucleus by inhibiting IkappaB kinase beta-mediated phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha. Moreover, CDDO-Me blocked constitutive activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3. We report the potent and selective antiproliferative effects of CDDO-Me on FLT3/ITD-positive myeloid leukemia cell lines and primary AML cells. The present studies show that CDDO-Me treatment results in caspase-3-mediated induction of apoptosis of FLT3/ITD-expressing cells and its antiproliferative effects are synergistic with PKC412, a FLT3-tyrosine kinase inhibitor currently in clinical trials. Taken together, our studies indicate that CDDO-Me greatly enhanced the efficacy of the FLT3 inhibitor PKC412, suggesting that combining two separate pathway inhibitors might be a viable therapeutic strategy for AML associated with a FLT3/ITD mutation.",

Activation of signal transduction in AML may occur through a variety of genetic alterations affecting different signaling molecules, such as the FLT3 and KIT receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and members of the RAS family of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins. These mutant signaling proteins are attractive therapeutic targets; however, developing targeted therapies for each genotypic variant and determining the relationships between different genotypes and critical functional dependencies of the leukemic cells remain major challenges. As the large number of mutant signaling proteins that have been identified in AML are likely to reflect activation of a more limited number of downstream effector pathways, such as the RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT cascades, targeting these unifying pathways may represent a more broadly applicable therapeutic strategy. Furthermore, integrative genomic studies combining DNA sequencing, DNA copy number analysis, transcriptional profiling, and functional genetic approaches hold great promise for identifying additional signaling abnormalities in AML that are relevant to leukemogenesis and can be exploited therapeutically. Eventually, it may become possible to use pathogenesis-oriented combinations of signal transduction inhibitors to improve the cure rate in AML patients.",

To explore the efficacy of combining a FLT3 inhibitor with standard AML chemotherapy drugs, we tested the effect of combining the FLT3 inhibitor SU11248 with cytarabine or daunorubicin on the proliferation and survival of cell lines expressing either mutant (FLT3 ITD or FLT3 D835V) or wild-type (WT) FLT3.

The synergistic interaction of SU11248 and the traditional antileukemic agents was more pronounced for induction of apoptosis. SU11248 inhibited the proliferation of primary AML myeloblasts expressing mutant FLT3 ITD but not WT FLT3 protein. Combining SU11248 and cytarabine synergistically inhibited the proliferation of primary AML myeloblasts expressing FLT3 ITD but not WT FLT3 protein.

ITD- and D835-mutations are essentially found in AML and their frequencies are approximately 20 and 6% of adults with AML, respectively. Thus, mutation of the FLT3 gene is so far the most frequent genetic alteration reported to be involved in AML. Several large-scale studies in well-documented patients published to date have demonstrated that ITD-mutation is strongly associated with leukocytosis and a poor prognosis.

As a consequence, prognostic factors in AML are more useful for the prediction of relapse, rather than for the stratification of induction therapy. Most relevant studies, based on large multicenter trials have definitively demonstrated that age and cytogenetics at diagnosis are the most important prognostic determinants for patients with AML. Early blast clearance after induction chemotherapy represents a further important factor of potential utility into clinical practice.

It is mutated in about 1/3 of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, either by internal tandem duplications (ITD) of the juxtamembrane domain or by point mutations usually involving the kinase domain (KD). Both types of mutation constitutively activate FLT3. Many studies have shown that AML patients with FLT3/ITD mutations have poor cure rates due to relapse. This has led to the development of a number of small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) with activity against FLT3. Many of these are still in preclinical development, but several have entered clinical phase I and II trials as monotherapy in patients with relapsed AML. Patients with FLT3 mutations in these trials have shown clinical responses, most often a clearing of peripheral blasts, but rarely major reductions of bone marrow blasts. Several studies have shown that FLT3 was successfully inhibited in most patients. However, complete remissions have rarely been achieved in these trials. The difference in responses of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients to BCR-ABL inhibitors compared to FLT3 mutant AML patients to FLT3 inhibitors may be reflective of treating a single gene disease in CML versus multiply altered gene disease in AML. This has led to clinical testing of FLT3 TKI in combination with conventional chemotherapy, with trial designs based on preclinical testing showing synergistic effects between these agents in inducing cytotoxic responses.

We investigated the hypothesis that previously observed Bcl-2 family member overexpression suppresses wild-type p53 activity in AML. We demonstrate that wild-type p53 protein is expressed in primary leukemic blasts from patients with de novo AML using 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and phospho-specific flow cytometry. We found that p53 was heterogeneously expressed and phosphorylated in AML patient samples and could accumulate following DNA damage. Overexpression of antiapoptosis protein Bcl-2 in AML cells was directly correlated with p53 expression and phosphorylation on serine residues 15, 46, and 392. Within those patients with the highest levels of Bcl-2 expression, we identified a mutation in FLT3 that duplicated phosphorylation site Y591. The presence of this mutation correlated with greater than normal Bcl-2 expression and with previously observed profiles of potentiated STAT and MAPK signaling. These results support the hypothesis that Flt3-mediated signaling in AML enables accumulation of Bcl-2 and maintains a downstream block to p53 pathway apoptosis. Bcl-2 inhibition might therefore improve the efficacy of existing AML therapies by inactivating this suppression of wild-type p53 activity.",

This is the first study of FLT3 mutations in pediatric non-promyelocytic AML patients that received the same treatment scheme in single institute. FLT3 internal tandem duplication of the juxtamembrane domain (FLT3/ITD) and a point mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3/TKD) were analyzed in 61 patients by PCR of genomic DNA. The incidence of FLT/ITD and FLT/TKD were 6.6% (4/61) and 3.3% (2/61), respectively. Patients with FLT3/TKD remain alive after autologous stem cell transplantation. The disease-free survival (DFS) of patients with FLT3/ITD (0%) was significantly lower than that of the others (52%). FLT3/ITD was the sole adverse prognostic factor for DFS by multivariate analysis (RR=5.6). Patients with FLT3/ITD relapsed early after complete remission even after receiving bone marrow transplantation from a matched related donor with little BuCy conditioning. New therapeutic scheme such as stem cell transplantation with more intensive conditioning just after complete remission could be applied in pediatric non-promyelocytic AML patients with the FLT3/ITD mutation.",

At diagnosis, seven patients were identified to contain FLT3-ITD mutations and one patient to harbor the D835 mutation. Five patients remained FLT3-ITD positive throughout the disease course (+/+). Three patients lost the FLT3 gene mutation at first (one FLT3-ITD, one D835 mutation), or second relapse (one FLT3-ITD) (+/-). One additional patient lost a small FLT3-ITD positive clone at relapse and at the same time gained an apparently unrelated FLT3-ITD positive clone. One patient without FLT3 mutation at diagnosis relapsed with an FLT3-ITD mutation (-/+). A shorter median duration of first remission (6 months versus 11.5 months) and a higher relapse rate after salvage therapy (e.g. allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation) resulted in a lower leukemia-free survival in the FLT3 mutated group (11% versus 31%).

Here we show that T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK), a mitotic kinase highly expressed in and correlated with more aggressive phenotype in several types of cancer, is expressed in AML but not in normal CD34+ cells and that TOPK knockdown decreased cell viability and induced apoptosis. Treatment of AML cells with TOPK inhibitor (OTS514) resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability with lower IC50 in FLT3-mutated cells, including blasts obtained from patients relapsed after FLT3-inhibitor treatment. Using a MV4-11-engrafted mouse model, we found that mice treated with 7.5 mg/kg IV daily for 3 weeks survived significantly longer than vehicle treated mice (median survival 46 vs 29 days, P < 0.001). Importantly, we identified TOPK as a FLT3-ITD and CEBPA regulated kinase, and that modulating TOPK expression or activity resulted in significant decrease of FLT3 expression and CEBPA phosphorylation. Thus, targeting TOPK in FLT3-ITD AML represents a novel therapeutic approach for this adverse risk subset of AML. ",

The juxtamembrane mutation of FLT3 is the strongest independent marker for disease relapse and is associated with elevated Bcl-2 protein and p53 hyper-phosphorylation in AML. DNA damage forms the basic mechanism of cancer cell eradication in current therapy of AML. Hdm2 and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 members are among the most intensely induced genes immediately after chemotherapy and Hdm2 is proposed a role in receptor tyrosine kinase regulation. Thus we examined the DNA damage related modulation of these proteins in relation to FLT3 mutational status and induction of apoptosis.;Within one hour after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), the AML cells (NB4, MV4-11, HL-60, primary AML cells) showed an increase in Flt3 protein independent of mRNA levels, while the Hdm2 protein decreased. The FLT3 mutant MV4-11 cells were resistant to IR accompanied by presence of both Mcl-1 and Hdm2 protein three hours after IR. In contrast, the FLT3 wild type NB4 cells responded to IR with apoptosis and pre-apoptotic Mcl-1 down regulation. Daunorubicin (DNR) induced continuing down regulation of Hdm2 and Mcl-1 in both cell lines followed by apoptosis.;Both IR and DNR treatment resulted in concerted protein modulations of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3. Cell death induction was associated with persistent attenuation of Mcl-1 and Hdm2.

This conformation is similar to that observed for the uncomplexed intracellular domain of FLT3 as well as for related receptor tyrosine kinases, except for a localized induced fit in the activation loop. The co-crystal structure reveals the interactions between quizartinib and the active site of FLT3 that are key for achieving its high potency against both wild-type FLT3 as well as a FLT3 variant observed in many AML patients.

In multivariate analysis, the presence of FLT3/ITD mutations was the most significant prognostic factor for both OS and CR rate (p = 0.0287; relative risk = 1.73; 95% CI = 1.06-2.82). However, in the group of patients with the intermediate-risk karyotype, the mere presence of FLT3/ITD was not associated with inferior clinical outcome. FLT3/D835 point mutation was found in four patients (3.5%) only. Follow-up of the FLT3/ITD-positive patients revealed stability of this mutation during the course of the disease. However, changes in the pattern of FLT3/D835 mutations in initial and relapsed AML were observed. Our results indicate an association of FLT3/ITD with the adverse outcome in AML patients treated with standard induction chemotherapy. Because FLT3/ITD mutation is a target for specific therapeutic inhibition, its early detection could be helpful in clinical practice.",

In 190 patients without the M3 French-American-British (FAB) subtype who were treated with the protocol of the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group, multivariate analyses showed that the NPM1 mutation was a favorable factor for achieving complete remission but was associated with a high relapse rate. Sequential analysis using 39 paired samples obtained at diagnosis and relapse showed that NPM1 mutations were lost at relapse in 2 of the 17 patients who had NPM1 mutations at diagnosis.

In humans, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) express MCL-1 at the highest level in response to FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) signaling. We here show that this FLT3-dependent stem cell maintenance system also plays a critical role in survival of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The CD34(+)CD38(-) LSC fraction expresses high levels of FLT3 as well as MCL-1, even compared with normal HSCs. Treatment with FLT3 ligand induced further MCL-1 up-regulation in LSCs in all AML cases tested. Interestingly, the group of samples expressing the highest levels of MCL-1 constituted AML with FLT3-internal tandem duplications (ITD). In FLT3-ITD AML cell lines, cells expressed a high level of MCL-1, and an inhibition of MCL-1 induced their apoptotic cell death. A tyrosine kinase inhibitor suppressed MCL-1 expression, and induced apoptosis that was reversed by the enforced MCL-1 expression. Finally, transduction of FLT3-ITD into HSCs strongly activated MCL-1 expression through its signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5)-docking domains. This effect was completely abrogated when STAT5 activation was blocked. Thus, the acquisition of FLT3-ITD ensures LSC survival by up-regulating MCL-1 via constitutive STAT5 activation that is independent of wild-type FLT3 signaling.",

However, none of the previous studies investigated which FAB subtype is associated with higher percentage of FLT3/ITD, thus the reason for undertaking the current study.;The prevalence and the potential prognostic impact of FLT3 mutations in 39 acute myeloid leukemia patients were analyzed by genomic polymerase chain reaction. Twelve samples with FLT3/ITDs and 27 acute myeloid leukemia samples without the mutations were compared with respect to clinical prognosis and FAB subtype. Results were correlated with cytogenetic data and the clinical response.;FLT3/ITD mutations were found in 31% of patients. FLT3/ITD was associated with similar clinical characteristics and was more prevalent in patients with normal karyotype (83%). Interestingly, half of the FLT3/ITD aberrations were found in patients with FAB M1 (50%), and fewer were found in patients with FAB M2 (8%), M4 (8%), and M5 (8%). Although less frequent in patients with cytogenetic aberrations, FLT3/ITDs were found in 17% of patients with t(15;17). Although the study was powered to 80%, patients with FLT3/ITD mutation did not show shorter complete remission duration or a higher relapse rate.;The data confirm that FLT3/ITD mutations represent a common alteration in adult acute myeloid leukemia, mainly with normal karyotype (83%) and de novo acute myeloid leukemia (75%), as compared to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (25%) (p<0.001).

However, although the WHO defines important biologically and clinically relevant entities, the prognostic value of some of the well-defined cytogenetic subgroups is partially masked in the WHO classification. Moreover, in the recent past a number of novel molecular aberrations with marked prognostic value, which are not yet incorporated in the WHO classifications have been identified. These molecular abnormalities include mutations (e.g., in FLT3, c-KIT, and NPM1), partial duplications (e.g., of MLL and FLT3), and abnormal expression of pathogenetic genes (e.g., EVI1, WT1, BCL2, MDR1, BAALC, and ERG). In addition, novel molecular approaches in genomics, like monitoring the expression levels of thousands of genes in parallel using DNA microarray technology, open possibilities for further refinement of prognostication of AML. Gene expression profiling in AML is already well established and has proven to be valuable to recognize various cytogenetic subtypes, discover novel AML subclasses, and predict clinical outcome.

We demonstrate that statins can impair FLT3 glycosylation, thus leading to loss of surface expression and induction of cell death, as well as mitigation of TKI resistance. Immunofluorescence microscopy confirms a reduction in surface localization and an increase in intracellular FLT3/internal tandem duplication (ITD) accumulation. This aberrant localization was associated with increased STAT5 activation but inhibition of both MAPK and AKT phosphorylation. Growth inhibition studies indicate that FLT3/ITD-expressing cells were killed with an IC(50) within a range of 0.2-2μM fluvastatin. Several mechanisms of resistance could be circumvented by fluvastatin treatment. An increase in the IC(50) for inhibition of phosphorylated FLT3/ITD by lestaurtinib caused by exogenous FLT3 ligand, resistance to sorafenib caused by the D835Y or FLT3/ITD N676K mutations, and activation of the IL-3 compensatory pathway were all negated by fluvastatin treatment. Finally, fluvastatin treatment in vivo reduced engraftment of BaF3 FLT3/ITD cells in Balb/c mice.

Peripheral blood samples of 60 newly diagnosed AML patients were collected and the STK1 levels were determined by enhanced chemiluminescent dot-blot method before and at two weeks after start of inductive treatment and in consolidatory treatment. Using non-parametric test, the differences between groups were analyzed. Then the correlation between STK1 level and clinical characteristics was explored by a way of chi-square test. The results indicated that the serum TK1 level in complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) AML patients decreased in varying degree as compared to pretreatment (P < 0.05), while there was no significant difference of TK1 level in non-remission (NR) ones (P > 0.05). The serum TK1 level in CR patients remained low level but increased noticeably after relapse into progressive disease (P < 0.05). A significant correlation was found between STK1 level and chromosomal abnormalities, serum LDH level as well as whether had fever in de novo AML patients (P < 0.05). It is concluded that the serum TK1 level change may be applied for reflecting the aggressiveness of disease, monitoring the clinical response to chemotherapy, evaluating the prognosis and predicating the relapse risk. The decrease of TK1 level suggests effective treatment and tumor burden reduction, while its increase indicate poor prognosis and relapse risk.",

In profiling of the in vitro tumor cell lines, it shows good selectivity against AML cells harboring FLT3-ITD mutations over other leukemia and solid tumor cell lines. The mechanism of action study illustrates that pteridin-7(8H)-one derivatives suppress the phosphorylation of FLT3 and its downstream pathways, thereby inducing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in AML cells. In in vivo studies, 31 significantly suppresses the tumor growth in MV4-11 xenograft model.

These mutations occur in the juxtamembrane (FLT3 length mutations; FLT3-LMs) and the second tyrosine kinase domain of FLT3-TKD and confer interleukin 3 (IL-3)-independent growth to Ba/F3 cells. In the mouse bone marrow transplantation model, FLT3-LMs induce a myeloproliferative syndrome stressing their transforming activity in vivo. In this study, we analyzed the pro-proliferative and antiapoptotic potential of FLT3 in FLT3-LM/TKD-mutation-transformed Ba/F3 cells and AML-derived cell lines. The PTK inhibitor SU5614 has inhibitory activity for FLT3 and selectively induces growth arrest, apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest in Ba/F3 and AML cell lines expressing a constitutively activated FLT3. In addition, the compound reverts the antiapoptotic and pro-proliferative activity of FLT3 ligand (FL) in FL-dependent cells. No cytotoxic activity of SU5614 was found in leukemic cell lines that express a nonactivated FLT3 or no FLT3 protein. At the biochemical level, SU5614 down-regulated the activity of the hyperphosphorylated FLT3 receptor and its downstream targets, signal transducer and activator of (STAT) 3, STAT5, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and the STAT5 target genes BCL-X(L) and p21. Our results show that SU5614 is a PTK inhibitor of FLT3 and has antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity in AML-derived cell lines that endogenously express an activated FLT3 receptor. The selective and potent cytotoxicity of FLT3 PTK inhibitors support a clinical strategy of targeting FLT3 as a new molecular treatment option for patients with FLT3-LM/TKD-mutation(+) AML.",

Activation of proteins by phosphorylation of tyrosine residues is a common mechanism in leukemia development. Therefore, specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have been developed for AML therapy and are currently under investigation. The staurosporine derivate PKC412 (Midostaurin) was found to be an effective inhibitor of the FLT3-RTK and is currently undergoing clinical trials for FLT3-mutated AML patients. Since resistance towards TKIs has been observed in vitro and in clinical trials, we have generated a PKC412-resistant clone (MV4-11r) of the human myelomonoblastic cell line MV4-11, which carries a homozygous FLT3-ITD mutation. MV4-11r displayed higher vitality after addition of PKC412 compared with MV4-11 with a pronounced reduction of apoptotic cells. Cytogenetic characterization revealed the acquisition of additional aberrations in the resistant cell line such as clonal alterations at chromosome 13q with additional FLT3 signals. Microarray analysis revealed significant expression changes in several genes prior to and after incubation with PKC412. The expression status of candidate genes being regulated by FLT-ITD like JAG1, p53, MCL-1, C-KIT, and FLT3/-L was confirmed by real-time PCR. In summary, resistance against PKC412 appears to be mediated by up-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes and down-regulation of proapoptotic signals as well as genes that are involved in normal and malignant hematopoiesis.",

A patient age of less than 60 years (P=0.023), achievement of complete remission after induction therapy (P<0.001), and no CXCR4 expression (P=0.010) were all associated with better progression-free survival (PFS). Among mutations of NPM1, CEBPA, FLT3 ITD, and FLT3 D835 and expression of CXCR4, only CXCR4 expression was associated with PFS (P=0.010; by log-rank test). By multivariate analysis, CXCR4 expression was an independent prognostic factor (P=0.001 for PFS and P=0.001 for overall survival). CXCR4 expression in patients with a normal karyotype was detected in 15 of 22 patients (68.2%, relative ratio 4.46, P=0.035).

Long-term inhibition of FLT3 activity in these patients has been elusive. To provide a more complete understanding of FLT3 biology, a mass spectroscopy-based screen was performed to search for FLT3-interacting proteins. The screen identified dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (DOCK2), which is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho GTPases, and its expression is limited to hematolymphoid cells. We show that DOCK2 is expressed in leukemia cell lines and primary AML samples, and DOCK2 co-immunoprecipitates with wild-type FLT3 and FLT3/ITD. Knockdown (KD) of DOCK2 by shRNA selectively reduced cell proliferation and colony formation in leukemia cell lines with increased FLT3 activity, and greatly sensitized these cells to cytarabine treatment, alone and in combination with FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors. DOCK2 KD in an FLT3/ITD-positive leukemia cell line also significantly prolonged survival in a mouse xenograft model. These findings suggest that DOCK2 is a potential therapeutic target for novel AML treatments, as this protein regulates the survival of leukemia cells with elevated FLT3 activity and sensitizes FLT3/ITD leukemic cells to conventional antileukemic agents.Leukemia advance online publication, 4 November 2016; doi:10.1038/leu.2016.284.",

Despite several promising leads in preclinical models, no agent has yet been approved for clinical use. Here we will review the development of novel therapies for AML with FLT3 mutations.;Initial clinical development focused on broad kinase inhibitors which were found to have limited clinical activity due to insufficient kinase inhibitory activity and high toxicity. Subsequent development has brought forth narrow-spectrum inhibitors with potent in-vivo activity and reasonable clinical tolerance, but many patients still progress with prolonged use.;The optimal role for targeting FLT3 may depend on multimodality therapy and will likely require hematopoietic transplant. The incorporation of ABL kinase inhibitors into acute lymphoblastic leukemia management should serve as a model for incorporation of FLT3-targeted agents into clinical care. Strategies incorporating FLT3-targeted agents into AML therapy are ongoing, but challenges in trial design, clinical heterogeneity and need for long-term follow-up make these investigations complicated in design and implementation.",

Using quantitative measurement of FLT3 inhibition over time in these patients, we confirmed that FLT3 was inhibited, but only transiently to less than 20% of baseline.

The FLT3 gene encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor that plays a key role in controlling survival, proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. Mutations in this gene are critical in causing a deregulation of the delicate balance between cell proliferation and differentiation. In this review, we provide an update on the structure, synthesis and activation of the FLT3 receptor and the subsequent activation of multiple downstream signaling pathways. We also review activating FLT3 mutations that are frequently identified in acute myeloid leukemia, cause activation of more complex downstream signaling pathways and promote leukemogenesis.

AKN-032 was identified among 150 selected hits from three different high throughput kinase screens. Further characterization showed inhibitory activity on FLT3 enzyme with an IC(50) of 70 nM. Western blot analysis revealed reduced autophosphorylation of the FLT3-receptor in AML cell line MV4-11 cells after exposure to AKN-032. Flow cytometry disclosed cytotoxic activity against MV4-11, but not against non-malignant 3T3-L1 fibroblast cells. Using a fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay, AKN-032 was tested against 15 cell lines and displayed a potent cytotoxic activity in AML cell lines MV4-11 (IC(50)=0.4 μM) and Kasumi-1 (IC(50)=2.3 μM). AKN-032 was also highly cytotoxic in tumor cells from AML patients in vitro. Furthermore, AKN-032 demonstrated significant antileukemic effect in a relatively resistant in vivo hollow fiber mouse model. No major toxicity was observed in the animals. In conclusion, AKN-032 is a promising new kinase inhibitor with significant in vivo and in vitro activity in AML. Results from the hollow fiber mouse assay suggest a favorable toxicity profile.

Treatment of AML cells with SGI-1776 results in a concentration-dependent induction of apoptosis and we investigated its effect on Pim kinase functions. Phosphorylation of traditional Pim kinase targets, c-Myc(Ser62) and 4E-BP1 (Thr36/Thr47), were both decreased in actively cycling AML cell lines MV-4-11, MOLM-13 and OCI-AML-3.

A FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation, found in approximately a quarter of patients with de novo AML, imparts a particularly poor prognosis. Patients with FLT3-ITD AML often present with more aggressive disease and have a significantly higher propensity for relapse after remission. The therapeutic approach for these patients has traditionally included intensive induction chemotherapy, followed by consolidative chemotherapy or hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). In recent years, multiple small molecule inhibitors of the FLT3 tyrosine kinase have been studied preclinically and in clinical trials. The earlier generation of these agents, often non-specific and impacting a variety of tyrosine kinases, produced at best transient peripheral blood responses in early clinical trials. Additionally, the combination of FLT3 inhibitors with cytotoxic regimens has not, as of yet, demonstrated an improvement in overall survival. Nevertheless, multiple current trials, including those with sorafenib, lestaurtinib, and midostaurin, continue to study the combination of FLT3 inhibitors with standard chemotherapy. Factors such as sustained FLT3 inhibition, protein binding, pharmacokinetics, and the presence of elevated FLT3-ligand levels appear to significantly impact the potency of these agents in vivo. In recent years, the development of more specific and potent agents has generated hope that FLT3 inhibitors may play a more prominent role in the treatment of FLT3-ITD AML in the near future. Nevertheless, questions remain regarding the optimal timing and schedule for incorporation of FLT3 inhibitors. The suitability, type, and timing of allogeneic HCT in the therapeutic approach for these patients are also issues which require further study and definition. Recent retrospective data appears to support the efficacy of allogeneic HCT in first complete remission, possibly due to a graft versus leukemia effect. However, larger prospective studies are necessary to further elucidate the role of HCT and its potential combination with FLT3 inhibitor therapy. We are hopeful that current clinical investigation will lead to an optimization and improvement of outcomes for these patients.",

It is unclear whether AML lacking FLT3-ITD responds to sorafenib. Using AML cell lines, we have shown that a low concentration of sorafenib induces opposing effects depending on the oncogenic background. In FLT3-ITD positive cells sorafenib blocks Erk activity and cell proliferation, and triggers apoptosis. However, in cells lacking FLT3-ITD, sorafenib paradoxically activates Erk2, and stimulates cellular proliferation and metabolic activity. Thus, depending on the genetic context, sorafenib is a beneficial inhibitor or paradoxical activator of mitogenic signaling pathways in AML. These results harbor important consequences in planning clinical trials in AML. ",

However, responses are not durable and resistance develops within months. In this study, we outline a two-step model of resistance whereby extrinsic microenvironmental proteins FLT3 ligand (FL) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) protect FLT3-ITD+ MOLM14 cells from AC220, providing time for subsequent accumulation of ligand-independent resistance mechanisms. FL directly attenuated AC220 inhibition of FLT3, consistent with previous reports. Conversely, FGF2 promoted resistance through activation of FGFR1 and downstream MAPK effectors; these resistant cells responded synergistically to combinatorial inhibition of FGFR1 and FLT3. Removing FL or FGF2 from ligand-dependent resistant cultures transiently restored sensitivity to AC220, but accelerated acquisition of secondary resistance via reactivation of FLT3 and RAS/MAPK signaling. FLT3-ITD AML patients treated with AC220 developed increased FGF2 expression in marrow stromal cells, which peaked prior to overt clinical relapse and detection of resistance mutations. Overall, these results support a strategy of early combination therapy to target early survival signals from the bone marrow microenvironment, in particular FGF2, to improve the depth of response in FLT3-ITD AML.

We studied 176 patients, all enrolled on prospective treatment trials, for secondary chromosomal aberrations and mutations in N-/KRAS, KIT, FLT3, and JAK2 (V617F) genes. Most frequent chromosomal aberrations were trisomy 22 (18%) and trisomy 8 (16%). Overall, 84% of patients harbored at least 1 gene mutation, with RAS being affected in 53% (45% NRAS; 13% KRAS) of the cases, followed by KIT (37%) and FLT3 (17%; FLT3-TKD [14%], FLT3-ITD [5%]). None of the secondary genetic lesions influenced achievement of complete remission. In multivariable analyses, KIT mutation (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.67; P = .04], log(10)(WBC) (HR = 1.33; P = .02), and trisomy 22 (HR = 0.54; P = .08) were relevant factors for relapse-free survival; for overall survival, FLT3 mutation (HR = 2.56; P = .006), trisomy 22 (HR = 0.45; P = .07), trisomy 8 (HR = 2.26; P = .02), age (difference of 10 years, HR = 1.46; P = .01), and therapy-related AML (HR = 2.13; P = .14) revealed as prognostic factors. The adverse effects of KIT and FLT3 mutations were mainly attributed to exon 8 and tyrosine kinase domain mutations, respectively.

The development of drug resistance, however, is a growing concern for mutant FLT3 inhibitors, such as PKC412. Potential therapeutic benefit can arise from the combination of two structurally diverse inhibitors that target-but bind differently to-the same protein or from two inhibitors with completely different mechanisms of action. Thus, there is a need for identification and development of novel FLT3 inhibitors that have the ability to positively combine with PKC412 or standard chemotherapeutic agents used to treat AML as a way to suppress the development of drug resistance and consequently prolong disease remission. Here, we report the effects of the novel type II ATP-competitive inhibitors, HG-7-85-01 and HG-7-86-01, which potently and selectively target mutant FLT3 protein kinase activity and inhibit the proliferation of cells harboring FLT3-ITD or FLT3 kinase domain point mutants via induction of apoptosis and cell cycle inhibition. Antileukemic activity of HG-7-85-01 was shown in vivo to be comparable with that observed with PKC412 in a bioluminescence assay using NCr nude mice harboring Ba/F3-FLT3-ITD-luc+ cells. HG-7-85-01 was also observed to override PKC412 resistance. Finally, HG-7-85-01 and HG-7-86-01 synergized with PKC412 and standard chemotherapeutic agents against mutant PKC412-sensitive and some PKC412-resistant, FLT3-positive cells. Thus, we present a structurally novel class of FLT3 inhibitors that warrants consideration for clinical testing against drug-resistant disease in AML patients.",

We observed a strict relationship between unfavorable karyotype and BAALC >1000 (p = 0.0001). Multivariate analysis of 81 patients with intermediate karyotype revealed that younger age (p = 0.00009), NPM gene mutation (p = 0.002), and WT1 >75th percentile (>2365) (p = 0.003) were independent, positive factors for complete remission (CR).

Our analysis revealed that there are distinct subtypes of t-AML that have a characteristic gene expression pattern. Common to each of the subgroups are gene expression patterns typical of arrested differentiation in early progenitor cells. Leukemias with a -5/del(5q) have a higher expression of genes involved in cell cycle control (CCNA2, CCNE2, CDC2), checkpoints (BUB1), or growth (MYC), and loss of expression of the gene encoding IFN consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP). A second subgroup of t-AML is characterized by down-regulation of transcription factors involved in early hematopoiesis (TAL1, GATA1, and EKLF) and overexpression of proteins involved in signaling pathways in myeloid cells (FLT3) and cell survival (BCL2). Establishing the molecular pathways involved in t-AML may facilitate the identification of selectively expressed genes that can be exploited for the development of urgently needed targeted therapies.",

Thirteen relapsed or chemo-refractory FLT3-ITD(+) AML patients were treated with sorafenib (200-400 mg twice daily). Twelve patients showed clearance or near clearance of bone marrow myeloblasts after 27 (range 21-84) days with evidence of differentiation of leukemia cells. The sorafenib response was lost in most patients after 72 (range 54-287) days but the FLT3 and downstream effectors remained suppressed. Gene expression profiling showed that leukemia cells that have become sorafenib resistant expressed several genes including ALDH1A1, JAK3, and MMP15, whose functions were unknown in AML. Nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice transplanted with leukemia cells from patients before and during sorafenib resistance recapitulated the clinical results. Both ITD and tyrosine kinase domain mutations at D835 were identified in leukemia initiating cells (LICs) from samples before sorafenib treatment. LICs bearing the D835 mutant have expanded during sorafenib treatment and dominated during the subsequent clinical resistance. These results suggest that sorafenib have selected more aggressive sorafenib-resistant subclones carrying both FLT3-ITD and D835 mutations, and might provide important leads to further improvement of treatment outcome with FLT3 inhibitors.",

In case of imminent or frank relapse following allogeneic SCT, treatment with FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) constitutes a promising clinical approach to induce hematologic remission without conventional chemotherapy.;We retrospectively analyzed the response to induction chemotherapy and the outcome of 76 patients with FLT3-ITD-positive AML including 50 patients who underwent allogeneic SCT. Furthermore, efficacy of TKI treatment was evaluated in 18 patients (median age 54 years, range 21-74) with relapsed or refractory FLT3-ITD-positive AML.;Response to induction chemotherapy in 76 FLT3-ITD-positive AML patients was characterized by a complete remission (CR) rate of 68%. In total, 50 of 76 patients (66%) underwent allogeneic SCT including 40 patients (80%) in CR. Relapse of AML was observed in 21 of 47 patients (45%) after allogeneic SCT with a median relapse-free survival (RFS) of 13 months (range 3-224) for patients with CR prior to or at day +30 after SCT. Myeloablative conditioning resulted in an improved median RFS of 29 months (4-217) as compared to a reduced intensity conditioning protocol prior to allogeneic SCT with a RFS of 8 months (1-197, P = 0.048), respectively. Median OS of FLT3-ITD-positive AML was 17 months (5-225) for patients who received an allogeneic SCT as compared to 9 months (1-184) for patients who did not undergo SCT. Response of FLT3-ITD-positive AML to sorafenib was characterized by only 3 of 18 patients achieving a bone marrow response (17%), while there was no response to second-line treatment with ponatinib.;This \"real-life\" data reflect the continuing challenge of FLT3-ITD-positive AML and confirm the poor outcome even after allogeneic SCT.

PATIENTS AND METHODS In the phase I part of the study, 10 patients with relapsed AML were treated with escalating doses of sorafenib with chemotherapy to establish the feasibility of the combination. We then treated 51 patients (median age, 53 years; range, 18 to 65 years) who had previously untreated AML with cytarabine at 1.5 g/m(2) by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion daily for 4 days (3 days if > 60 years of age), idarubicin at 12 mg/m(2) IV daily for 3 days, and sorafenib at 400 mg orally twice daily for 7 days. RESULTS Overall, 38 (75%) patients have achieved a complete remission (CR), including 14 (93%) of 15 patients with mutated FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3; the 15th patient had complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery [CRp]) and 24 (66%) of 36 patients with FLT3 wild-type (WT) disease (three additional FLT3-WT patients had CRp). FLT3-mutated patients were more likely to achieve a CR than FLT3-WT patients (P = .033). With a median follow-up of 54 weeks (range, 8 to 87 weeks), the probability of survival at 1 year is 74%. Among the FLT3-mutated patients, 10 have relapsed and five remain in CR with a median follow-up of 62 weeks (range, 10 to 76 weeks).

RT-PCR was used to determine the expressions of FIT3-ITD and mdr1 gene in bone marrow samples from 81 new diagnosed pediatric patients with AML, the cytogenetics and immunophenotypes of bone marrow cells were routinely examined. The results indicated that the FLT3-ITDs were detected in 8 out of 81 pediatric patients (9.88%) and all mutations detected were hybrid, while less frequently this mutation was detected in adult patients. Although they were irrelevant with sex and immunophenotypes, the mutations seemed predominant in older pediatric patients. The leukocyte counts and bone marrow blast cell counts in pediatric patients with FLT3-ITD at diagnosis were higher than those in pediatric patients without FLT3-ITD (p = 0.001 and p = 0.041 respectively), but the normal chromosomes were found in most pediatric patients with FLT-ITD. The patients with FLT3-ITD had lower induction remission rate (only 25%), but the patients without FLT3-ITD had higher remission rate (76.1%). According results detected by RT-PCR, the mdr1 gene was found in 27 pediatric patients, but only 3 out of 8 pediatric patients with FLT3-ITD were detected to express both FLT3-ITD and mdr1, which suggests unrelation between FLT3-ITD occurrence and mdr1 expression. It is concluded that the FLT3-ITD is frequent mutation in pediatric patients with AML, the prognosis is worse and the induction remission rate is lower in these patients, but the FLT3-ITD not relates with the mdr1, which suggests that the common MDR modulators may be un effective for therapy of the patients with FLT3-ITD.",

FLT3 mutations indicated that non-responders (5/7 patients, 8 versus 49 months survival) are characterized by a unique gene response profile before and at 4 h. At 18-24 h after chemotherapy, the gene expression of p53 target genes was attenuated, while genes involved in chemoresistance, cytarabine detoxification, chemokine networks and T cell receptor were prominent. No signs of apoptosis were observed in the collected cells, suggesting the treated patients as a physiological source of pre-apoptotic cells.;Pre-apoptotic gene expression can be monitored within hours after start of chemotherapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, and may be useful in future determination of therapy responders. The low number of patients and the heterogeneity of acute myeloid leukemia limited the identification of gene expression predictive of therapy response. Therapy-induced gene expression reflects the complex biological processes involved in clinical cancer cell eradication and should be explored for future enhancement of therapy.",

On the basis of chromosome aberrations patients can be stratified in groups reflecting either good or poor prognosis. However, the majority of patients fall in an 'intermediate risk' group. Internal tandem duplications in the hematopoietic growth factor receptor Flt3 have been shown to separate a subset of high risk patients from intermediate or low risk cases. In an attempt to further characterize the heterogeneity of prognosis among the cytogenetic intermediate risk group of AML, we investigated the overall survival, failure-free survival, initial therapy response and relapse rates of 103 patients with de novo AML in relation to autonomous proliferation and the proliferative response to a panel of 10 cytokines in a short-term thymidine incorporation assay. To exclude perturbation of the responses by other (known) risk factors our final intermediate risk population was comprised of patients with intermediate risk cytogenetics, having an age of 60 years of younger and not showing tandem duplications in the Flt3 gene. Among this intermediate risk group, only the responses to M-CSF and IL-1alpha were found to be predictive for therapy outcome. Results obtained by a 7-day culture with these cytokines revealed two subpopulations characterized by a good and a poor prognosis, respectively. The complete remission rates in these subpopulations were similar, but the relapse rates, failure-free survival and overall survival differed. If further study extends and supports our data, it should be considered to include these patients in the poor risk arms of treatment protocols and offer them intensified treatment or bone marrow transplantation.",

Single cell network profiling (SCNP) is a multiparametric flow cytometry based assay that simultaneously measures, in a quantitative fashion and at the single cell level, both extracellular surface marker levels and changes in intracellular signaling proteins in response to extracellular modulators. We previously reported an initial characterization of FLT3 ITD-mediated signaling using SCNP. Herein SCNP was applied sequentially to two separate cohorts of samples collected from elderly AML patients at diagnosis. In the first (training) study, AML samples carrying unmutated, wild-type FLT3 (FLT3 WT) displayed a wide range of induced signaling, with a fraction having signaling profiles comparable to FLT3 ITD AML samples. Conversely, the FLT3 ITD AML samples displayed more homogeneous induced signaling, with the exception of patients with low (<40%) mutational load, which had profiles comparable to FLT3 WT AML samples. This observation was then confirmed in an independent (verification) cohort. Data from the second cohort were also used to assess the association between SCNP data and disease-free survival (DFS) in the context of FLT3 and nucleophosmin (NPM1) mutational status among patients who achieved complete remission (CR) to induction chemotherapy. The combination of SCNP read outs together with FLT3 and NPM1 molecular status improved the DFS prediction accuracy of the latter. Taken together, these results emphasize the value of comprehensive functional assessment of biologically relevant signaling pathways in AML as a basis for the development of highly predictive tests for guidance of post-remission therapy.",

Therefore, the current study attempted to investigate the frequency of FLT3 gene mutations and their prognostic implications for AML in terms of treatment response, survival, and relapse.;Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to detect D835 and ITD mutations in 84 newly diagnosed AML patients from February 2001 to October 2004.

The results were examined based on a comparison with previously known prognostic factors, and the treatment outcomes analyzed according to the existence of the mutations in relation to the event free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), and complete remission (CR) rates.;D835 and IDT mutations were detected in 4.7% (4/84) and 19.0% (16/84), respectively, of the AML patients. The FLT3 gene mutations were not found to be associated with previously known prognostic factors, such as the WBC count, age, and cytogenetic risk group, but were associated with the lactate dehydrogenase levels. The EFS and OS rates were also significantly lower in the FLT3 gene mutation group, especially in AML with normal karyotypes.;FLT3 gene mutations were observed in 23.8% of AML patients and appeared to have a prognostic implication on patient survival.

Five acquired gene mutations were detected at relapse. Of the 45 gene mutations at diagnosis, 11 of them were lost at relapse. The acquired mutations at relapse were all class I mutations as Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) and rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (RAS) mutations. The disappeared mutations at relapse were 3 of 11 internal tandem duplications of FLT3 (FLT3-ITD) (27.3%), 3 of 3 FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3-TKD) (100%), 3 of 13 Nucleophosmin 1 (23.1%) and 2 of 5 CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α (40%) mutations. However, epigenetics-modifying gene (DNMT3a, TET2 and IDH1/2) mutations had no change between diagnosis and relapse samples, and may become minimal residual disease marker. The frequency of FLT3-ITD at relapse in patients with DNMT3a mutation at diagnosis is significantly higher than those in patients without them (P=0.001). Moreover, the high frequency of FLT3-ITD at relapse is also seen in AML cases that initially present with any epigenetics-modifying gene mutations (P<0.001).

Here we describe the clinical application of MiSeq, a next-generation sequencing platform to screen mutational hotspots in 54 cancer-related genes including genes relevant in acute myeloid leukemia (NRAS, KRAS, FLT3, NPM1, DNMT3A, IDH1/2, JAK2, KIT and EZH2). We sequenced 63 samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome using MiSeq and compared the results with those obtained using another next-generation sequencing platform, Ion-Torrent Personal Genome Machine and other conventional testing platforms. MiSeq detected a total of 100 single nucleotide variants and 23 NPM1 insertions that were confirmed by Ion Torrent or conventional platforms, indicating complete concordance. FLT3-internal tandem duplications (n=10) were not detected; however, re-analysis of the MiSeq output by Pindel, an indel detection algorithm, did detect them. Dilution studies of cancer cell-line DNA showed that the quantitative accuracy of mutation detection was up to an allelic frequency of 1.5% with a high level of inter- and intra-run assay reproducibility, suggesting potential utility for monitoring response to therapy, clonal heterogeneity and evolution. Examples demonstrating the advantages of MiSeq over conventional platforms for disease monitoring are provided.

Here, we show that the NAD-dependent SIRT1 deacetylase is selectively overexpressed in primary human FLT3-ITD AML LSCs. This SIRT1 overexpression is related to enhanced expression of the USP22 deubiquitinase induced by c-MYC, leading to reduced SIRT1 ubiquitination and enhanced stability. Inhibition of SIRT1 expression or activity reduced the growth of FLT3-ITD AML LSCs and significantly enhanced TKI-mediated killing of the cells.

However, whereas the wild-type cells undergo rapid S-phase arrest, the S-phase checkpoint fails in mutant cells. Cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage in S phase is effected via loss of the transcriptional regulator cdc25A. This loss is reduced or absent in clofarabine-treated FLT3 mutant cells. Furthermore, cdc25A message levels are maintained by the FLT3-ITD, such that message is reduced by 87.5% on exposure to FLT3 small interfering RNA. Primary FLT3-ITD samples from untreated patients also display impaired cell cycle arrest and show enhanced sensitivity on prolonged treatment with clofarabine compared with wild-type samples.;There is a reversal of phenotype in mutant FLT3 cells dependent on the length of exposure to clofarabine. Efficient DNA repair may render the cells resistant to a short pulse of the drug, but a failure of cell cycle checkpoint(s) in S phase renders the cells sensitive to prolonged exposure.",

Hence, this pathway is an attractive target for the development of novel anticancer strategies. Recent studies showed that PI3K/Akt signaling is frequently activated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient blasts and strongly contributes to proliferation, survival and drug resistance of these cells. Upregulation of the PI3K/Akt network in AML may be due to several reasons, including FLT3, Ras or c-Kit mutations. Small molecules designed to selectively target key components of this signal transduction cascade induce apoptosis and/or markedly increase conventional drug sensitivity of AML blasts in vitro. Thus, inhibitory molecules are currently being developed for clinical use either as single agents or in combination with conventional therapies. However, the PI3K/Akt pathway is important for many physiological cellular functions and, in particular, for insulin signaling, so that its blockade in vivo might cause severe systemic side effects. In this review, we summarize the existing knowledge about PI3K/Akt signaling in AML cells and we examine the rationale for targeting this fundamental signal transduction network by means of selective pharmacological inhibitors.",

Tracking mutant alleles to determine clonality from diagnosis to relapse or from primary site to metastases in a sensitive and quantitative manner is most often performed using next-generation sequencing. Such methods determine clonal frequencies by extrapolation of allele frequencies in sequencing data of DNA from the metagenome of bulk tumor samples using a set of assumptions. The computational framework that is usually used assumes specific patterns in the order of acquisition of unique mutational events and heterozygosity of mutations in single cells. However, these assumptions are not accurate for all mutant loci in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples. To assess whether current models of clonal diversity within individual AML samples are appropriate for common mutations, we developed protocols to directly genotype AML single cells. Single-cell analysis demonstrates that mutations of FLT3 and NPM1 occur in both homozygous and heterozygous states, distributed among at least nine distinct clonal populations in all samples analyzed. There appears to be convergent evolution and differential evolutionary trajectories for cells containing mutations at different loci. This work suggests an underlying tumor heterogeneity beyond what is currently understood in AML, which may be important in the development of therapeutic approaches to eliminate leukemic cell burden and control clonal evolution-induced relapse.

The small molecule inhibitor, PKC412, targets mutant FLT3 and is currently in late-stage clinical trials. However, the identification of PKC412-resistant leukemic blast cells in the bone marrow of AML patients has propelled the development of novel and structurally distinct FLT3 inhibitors that have the potential to override drug resistance and more efficiently prevent disease progression or recurrence. Here, we present the novel first-generation \"type II\" FLT3 inhibitors, AFG206, AFG210, and AHL196, and the second-generation \"type II\" derivatives and AST487 analogs, AUZ454 and ATH686. All agents potently and selectively target mutant FLT3 protein kinase activity and inhibit the proliferation of cells harboring FLT3 mutants via induction of apoptosis and cell cycle inhibition. Cross-resistance between \"type I\" inhibitors, PKC412 and AAE871, was demonstrated. While cross-resistance was also observed between \"type I\" and first-generation \"type II\" FLT3 inhibitors, the high potency of the second-generation \"type II\" inhibitors was sufficient to potently kill \"type I\" inhibitor-resistant mutant FLT3-expressing cells. The increased potency observed for the second-generation \"type II\" inhibitors was observed to be due to an improved interaction with the ATP pocket of FLT3, specifically associated with introduction of a piperazine moiety and placement of an amino group in position 2 of the pyrimidine ring. Thus, we present 2 structurally novel classes of FLT3 inhibitors characterized by high selectivity and potency toward mutant FLT3 as a molecular target. In addition, presentation of the antileukemic effects of \"type II\" inhibitors, such as AUZ454 and ATH686, highlights a new class of highly potent FLT3 inhibitors able to override drug resistance that less potent \"type I\" inhibitors and \"type II\" first-generation FLT3 inhibitors cannot.",

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) has been used in several clinical trials for the treatment of nonpromyelocytic AML with limited clinical activity observed. FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) used as monotherapy also achieve limited clinical responses and are thus far unable to affect cure rates in AML patients. We explored the efficacy of combining ATRA and FLT3 TKIs to eliminate FLT3/internal tandem duplication (ITD)(+) LSCs. Our studies reveal highly synergistic drug activity, preferentially inducing apoptosis in FLT3/ITD(+) cell lines and patient samples. Colony-forming unit assays further demonstrate decreased clonogenicity of FLT3/ITD(+) cells upon treatment with ATRA and TKI. Most importantly, the drug combination depletes FLT3/ITD(+) LSCs in a genetic mouse model of AML, and prolongs survival of leukemic mice. Furthermore, engraftment of primary FLT3/ITD(+) patient samples is reduced in mice following treatment with FLT3 TKI and ATRA in combination, with evidence of cellular differentiation occurring in vivo. Mechanistically, we provide evidence that the synergism of ATRA and FLT3 TKIs is at least in part due to the observation that FLT3 TKI treatment upregulates the antiapoptotic protein Bcl6, limiting the drug's apoptotic effect. However, cotreatment with ATRA reduces Bcl6 expression to baseline levels through suppression of interleukin-6 receptor signaling. These studies provide evidence of the potential of this drug combination to eliminate FLT3/ITD(+) LSCs and reduce the rate of relapse in AML patients with FLT3 mutations. ",

Imatinib has been used successfully to treat patients with chronic eosinophilic disorders with the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion kinase; limited clinical data indicate that dasatinib could be active in imatinib-resistant disease.

Thirty-five RAS mutations were found in 32 cases (13%) predominantly classified as M1/M2 (53%) followed by M4/M5 subtype (38%). Ten cases were positive for N-RAS codon 12, 11 cases for N-RAS codon 61, 13 cases for N-RAS codon 13, and one case for K-RAS codon 13. No mutation was found in K-RAS exon 2 or H-RAS. The most common base substitution was the G to A transition at codon 13. Most M1/M2 cases had mutations at codon 12 or 13, whereas M4/M5 cases preferentially affected codon 61. Half of the patients with RAS mutations had abnormal karyotypes with the majority involving chromosomes 21, 11 and 7. Four patients had core-binding factor leukemia and four additional patients had coexisting FLT3 or AML1 mutation. One patient had RAS, FLT3 and t(8;21) and the other had RAS, AML1 point mutation and del(9q). In conclusion, mutation of RAS gene was not as common in the Thais as in the western population.

FLT3 is constitutively activated either by an internal tandem duplication (ITD) or by a point mutation (PM) in 17% to 24% of pediatric AML cases. Autocrine stimulation of wild-type (WT) FLT3 by coexpressed FLT3 ligand (FL) occurs in many other cases. FLT3/ITD mutations confer a particularly poor prognosis in pediatric AML patients. Inhibitors of FLT3 are being tested in adult AML patients, with promising preliminary results. In this study, cytotoxicity and apoptosis assays were performed on 44 diagnostic pediatric AML blast samples (14 FLT3/WT, 15 FLT3/ITD, 15 FLT3/PM) using CEP-701, a potent and selective FLT3 inhibitor. Pronounced cytotoxicity and induction of apoptosis were observed in a higher percentage of FLT3/ITD samples (93%) than FLT3/PM (27%) or FLT3/WT (29%). The cytotoxicity was greatest in samples with a high FLT3/ITD mutant-to-wild-type allelic ratio. The addition of FL enhanced the survival and augmented the sensitivity to FLT3 inhibition for the CEP-701-responsive subset of FLT3/WT and FLT3/PM samples.

This is the largest cohort of pediatric AML patients reported thus far screened for all four mutations. Of the children with AML, 40% had a mutation in KIT (11.3%), RAS (18%) or FLT3/ITD (11.1%), and 70% of cases of core-binding factor (CBF) leukemia were associated with a mutation of KIT or RAS. Mutations in RAS or FLT3/ITD were frequently found in association with a normal karyotype. Patients with a FLT3/ITD mutation had a significantly worse clinical outcome. However, the presence of a KIT or RAS mutation did not significantly influence clinical outcome. We demonstrate that KIT exon 8 mutations result in constitutive ligand-independent kinase activation that can be inhibited by clinically relevant concentrations of imatinib.

Cytogenetics-based stratification improves survival. Patients with AML and normal cytogenetics, the largest single subgroup, have had a very heterogeneous outcome with standard chemotherapy in multiple clinical trials. Hence it is difficult to recommend a \"one size fits all\" kind of treatment for this heterogeneous population of AML patients. New emerging data from preclinical, retrospective, and large, randomized controlled studies indicate that in addition to cytogenetic abnormalities, many other molecular aberrations are operative in the response to treatment as well as in the risk of relapse. Such molecular markers are being tested for developing targeted therapies and may help in improved stratification of patients in the selection of post-remission therapy. Emerging evidence reveals that at the submicroscopic level, AML with normal cytogenetics may carry poor prognostic genetic lesions or \"molecular signatures\" as is the case with FLT3 mutations and overexpression of BAALC, ERG or MN1, or may have aberrations that predict better risk as is the case with isolated NPM1 or CEBPA mutations. Later studies have tried to explore the interaction of various prognostically important genes in this group of AML patients. The utility of the evolving data for bedside management of such patients is expected to improve with the wider application of modern tools, using the proposed clinical outcome models, and probably by development of a risk-scoring system based on the relative risk associated with each molecular aberration. The goals include identifying those patients most likely to benefit from upfront allogeneic HSCT and sparing good-prognosis patients from unnecessary transplant-related morbidity. The following is an outline of the most common molecular changes, their impact on the outcome of AML patients with normal cytogenetics and challenges in their wide scale application in risk stratification.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The prognosis for younger adults (< or = 55-60 years) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has improved during the last four decades. However, there has been little progress in the treatment of older adults. This disappointing observation is important because the median age of patients with AML is about 70 years. Approximately 60%-80% of younger adults with AML achieve complete remission (CR) with the cytotoxic agents cytarabine and an anthracycline such as daunorubicin or idarubicin or the anthracenedione mitoxantrone. However, only 30%-40% of such patients are alive and disease-free at 5 years. Among older adults, CR is achieved in 40%-55%, but there are very few long-term survivors. Many studies have evaluated the impact of alternative doses and schedules, as well as additional cytotoxic drugs, on the prognosis for this group of patients. The outcome has not improved substantially beyond that achieved with conventional doses of an anthracycline and cytarabine followed by high-dose cytarabine consolidation.Several factors identified at diagnosis can predict outcome. The most important of these is the karyotype of the leukemic cells. Another critical factor is the presence of transmembrane transporter proteins, which confer multidrug resistance and mutations in or overexpression of specific genes such as WT1, C/EBPalpha, BAX, and BCL-2/BAX ratio, BAALC, EVI1, KIT and FLT3. The development of specific agents directed at gene mutations, signal transduction pathways and unique cell surface antigens provide the foundation for new therapeutic strategies. Such agents include the immunoconjugate gemtuzumab ozogamicin, multidrug resistance inhibitors, farnesyltransferase inhibitors, histone deacetylase and proteosome inhibitors, antiangiogenesis agents, FLT3 inhibitors, apoptosis inhibitors, and nucleoside analogs. All of these agents can potentially address the heterogeneous abnormalities in AML and significantly improve the outcome for patients.",

In this study, we identified GTP-14564 as a specific kinase inhibitor for ITD-FLT3 and investigated the molecular basis of its specificity. GTP-14564 inhibited the growth of interleukin-3-independent Ba/F3 expressing ITD-FLT3 at 1 microM, whereas a 30-fold higher concentration of GTP-14564 was required to inhibit FLT3 ligand-dependent growth of Ba/F3 expressing wild type FLT3 (wt-FLT3). However, this inhibitor suppressed the kinase activities of wt-FLT3 and ITD-FLT3 equally, suggesting that the signaling pathways for proliferation differ between wt-FLT3 and ITD-FLT3. Analysis of downstream targets of FLT3 using GTP-14564 revealed STAT5 activation to be essential for growth signaling of ITD-FLT3. In contrast, wt-FLT3 appeared to mainly use the MAPK pathway rather than the STAT5 pathway to transmit a proliferative signal. Further analysis demonstrated that the first two tyrosines in an ITD were critical for STAT5 activation and growth induction but that all of the tyrosines in the juxtamembrane region were dispensable in terms of the proliferation signals of wt-FLT3. These results indicate that an ITD mutation in FLT3 elicits an aberrant STAT5 activation that results in increased sensitivity to GTP-14564. Thus, FLT3-targeted inhibition is an attractive approach, with the potential for selective cytotoxicity, to the treatment of ITD-FLT3-positive acute myeloid leukemia.",

Associations were analyzed in the context of other molecular markers, such as CEBPA, DNMT3A, NMP1, FLT3, IDH1/2, RAS, and WT1. To investigate the order of appearance of TET2 and concomitant mutations, targeted deep resequencing was performed in six patients. At least one sequence variation with impact on TET2 protein sequence was found in 13 of the 215 CN-AML patients (6%). Patients with TET2 mutations tended to be older (P = 0.078) and had higher platelet counts (P = 0.041). TET2-mutated patients were more likely to have concomitant NPM1 (11 of 13; P = 0.047) and DNMT3A (10 of 13; P = 0.001) mutations but were mutually exclusive to partial tandem duplication of the MLL gene (MLL-PTD) and IDH1/2 mutations. TET2 mutations were identified as subclones in four of the six investigated patients by deep sequencing.

In summary, t-MDS/AML shows a mutation profile different from their de novo counterparts. TP53 mutations are highly and similarly prevalent in t-MDS and t-AML but mutations in genes other than TP53 were more frequent in t-AML than t-MDS.

Sorafenib was administered either as prophylaxis in patients considered at very high risk for relapse (n = 6) or at the time of disease recurrence (n = 9).;Sorafenib was initiated at a median of 100 days post HSCT. Overall, 11/15 (73%) of patients experienced medically significant toxicities.

In this study, we examined the effect of stromal niche cells on CD34(+) progenitors from patients with FLT3-ITD(+) or wild-type FLT3 (FLT3-WT) AML treated with the TKIs SU5614 or sorafenib. TKIs effectively and specifically inhibited FLT3 and increased the fraction of undivided progenitors in both FLT3-ITD(+) and FLT3-WT samples. Treatment with SU5614 and sorafenib also reduced the number of mature leukemic progenitors, whereas contact with stroma protected against this cell loss. In contrast, primitive long-term progenitors from both FLT3-ITD(+) and FLT3-WT AML were resistant to TKIs. Additional contact with niche cells significantly expanded long-term FLT3-ITD(+) but not FLT3-WT progenitors in the presence of SU5614 but not that of sorafenib. Thus, TKIs with first-generation inhibitors fail to eradicate early leukemic stem/progenitor cells in FLT3-ITD(+) AML. Further, we defined a specific interaction between FLT3-ITD(+) progenitors and niche cells that enables the maintenance of leukemic progenitors in the presence of TKI. Collectively, our findings suggest that molecular therapy may have unpredicted effects on leukemic progenitors, underscoring the necessity of developing strategies to selectively eliminate the malignant stem cell clone.",

Overexpression of HOXB2 or HOXB3 in mouse pro-B cells resulted in decreased FLT3-ITD-dependent cell proliferation as well as colony formation and increased apoptosis.

These two regions can be connected by different spacers and almost all the molecules contain a component resembling the ATP purine structure.

MRD levels were monitored prospectively. Gene mutations were screened at diagnosis. Despite a more rapid MRD decrease after reinforced induction, induction arm did not influence relapse-free survival (RFS) (64% in both arms; P = .91). Higher WBC, KIT, and/or FLT3-ITD/TKD gene mutations, and a less than 3-log MRD reduction after first consolidation, were associated with a higher specific hazard of relapse, but MRD remained the sole prognostic factor in multivariate analysis. At 36 months, cumulative incidence of relapse and RFS were 22% vs 54% (P < .001) and 73% vs 44% (P < .001) in patients who achieved 3-log MRD reduction vs the others. These results suggest that MRD, rather than gene mutations, should be used for future treatment stratifications in CBF-AML patients.

To study resistance to TKIs targeting FLT3, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is frequently mutated in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), we developed resistant human cell lines through prolonged coculture with FLT3 TKIs. FLT3 TKI-resistant cell lines and primary samples still exhibit inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation on FLT3 TKI treatment. However, FLT3 TKI-resistant cell lines and primary samples often show continued activation of downstream PI3K/Akt and/or Ras/MEK/MAPK signaling pathways as well as continued expression of genes involved in FLT3-mediated cellular transformation. Inhibition of these signaling pathways restores partial sensitivity to FLT3 TKIs. Mutational screening of FLT3 TKI-resistant cell lines revealed activating N-Ras mutations in 2 cell lines that were not present in the parental FLT3 TKI-sensitive cell line. Taken together, these data indicate that FLT3 TKI-resistant cells most frequently become FLT3 independent because of activation of parallel signaling pathways that provide compensatory survival/proliferation signals when FLT3 is inhibited. Anti-FLT3 mAb treatment was still cytotoxic to FLT3 TKI-resistant clones.

In the context of cancer, detailed signaling studies have resulted in the development of some of the most frequently used means of therapy, with several well established examples such as the small molecule inhibitors imatinib and dasatinib in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. Impaired function of receptor tyrosine kinases is implicated in various types of tumors, and much effort is put into mapping the many interactions and downstream pathways. Here we discuss the hematopoietic growth factor receptors c-Kit and Flt3 and their downstream signaling in normal as well as malignant cells. Both receptors are members of the same family of tyrosine kinases and crucial mediators of stem-and progenitor-cell proliferation and survival in response to ligand stimuli from the surrounding microenvironment. Gain-of-function mutations/alterations render the receptors constitutively and ligand-independently activated, resulting in aberrant signaling which is a crucial driving force in tumorigenesis. Frequently found mutations in c-Kit and Flt3 are point mutations of aspartic acid 816 and 835 respectively, in the activation loop of the kinase domains. Several other point mutations have been identified, but in the case of Flt3, the most common alterations are internal tandem duplications (ITDs) in the juxtamembrane region, reported in approximately 30% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). During the last couple of years, the increasing understanding of c-Kit and Flt3 signaling has also revealed the complexity of these receptor systems. The impact of gain-of-function mutations of c-Kit and Flt3 in different malignancies is well established and shown to be of clinical relevance in both prognosis and therapy. Many inhibitors of both c-Kit or Flt3 or of their downstream substrates are in clinical trials with encouraging results, and targeted therapy using a combination of such inhibitors is considered a promising approach for future treatments.",

Multiple submicroscopic genetic alterations with prognostic significance have been discovered, including internal tandem duplication of the FLT3 gene, mutations in the NPM1 gene, partial tandem duplication of the MLL gene, high expression of the BAALC gene, and mutations in the CEBPA gene. Application of gene-expression profiling has also identified a gene-expression signature that appears to separate cytogenetically normal AML patients into prognostic subgroups, although gene-expression signature-based classifiers predicting outcome for individual patients with greater accuracy are needed. These and similar future findings are likely to have a major impact on the clinical management of cytogenetically normal AML not only in prognostication but also in selection of appropriate treatment, since many of the identified genetic alterations already constitute or will potentially become targets for specific therapeutic intervention.

MLN518 (formerly CT53518) is a small molecule inhibitor of the FLT3, KIT, and platelet-derived growth-factor receptor (PDGFR) tyrosine kinases with significant activity in murine models of FLT3 ITD-positive leukemia. Given the importance of FLT3 and KIT for normal hematopoietic progenitor cells, we analyzed the effect of MLN518 on murine hematopoiesis under steady-state conditions, after chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression, and during bone marrow transplantation. In these assays, we show that MLN518 has mild toxicity toward normal hematopoiesis at concentrations that are effective in treating FLT3 ITD-positive leukemia in mice. We also demonstrate that MLN518 preferentially inhibits the growth of blast colonies from FLT3 ITD-positive compared with ITD-negative patients with AML, at concentrations that do not significantly affect colony formation by normal human progenitor cells. In analogy to imatinib mesylate in BCR-ABL-positive acute leukemia, MLN518-induced remissions may not be durable.

Two C-RAF germ-line mutations, S427G and I448V, were identified in patients with therapy-related AML in the absence of alterations in RAS and FLT3. Both exchanges were located within the kinase domain of C-RAF. In vitro and in vivo kinase assays revealed significantly increased activity for (S427G)C-RAF but not for (I448V)C-RAF. The involvement of the S427G C-RAF mutation in constitutive activation of ERK was further confirmed through demonstration of activating phosphorylations on C-RAF, MEK, and ERK in neoplastic cells, but not in nonneoplastic cells. Transformation and survival assays showed oncogenic and antiapoptotic properties for both mutations. Screening healthy individuals revealed a <1/400 frequency of these mutations and, in the case of I448V, inheritance was observed over three generations with another mutation carrier suffering from cancer.

PKC412 showed synergistic effects with all agents studied except methotrexate for FLT3-mutated cell lines in isobologram analysis. In contrast, PKC412 was rather antagonistic to most drugs, except for 4-hydroperoxy-cyclophosphamide and vincristine, in leukemia cell lines without FLT3 mutations. Cell-cycle analysis revealed that PKC412 induced G1 arrest in leukemia cell lines carrying FLT3 mutations, whereas it arrested cells in G2/M phase in the absence of FLT3 mutations, which may underlie the divergent cytotoxic interactions. These results suggest that the simultaneous administration of PKC412 and other agents except methotrexate is clinically effective against FLT3 mutation-positive leukemias, whereas it would be of little benefit for FLT3 mutation-negative leukemias.

We report here the development and characterization of a fully human anti-FLT3 neutralizing antibody (IMC-EB10) isolated from a human Fab phage display library. IMCEB10 (immunoglobulin G1 [IgG1], kappa) binds with high affinity (KD=158 pM) to soluble FLT3 in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and to FLT3 receptor expressed on the surfaces of human leukemia cell lines. IMC-EB10 blocks the binding of FLT3 ligand (FL) to soluble FLT3 in ELISA and competes with FL for binding to cell-surface FLT3 receptor. IMC-EB10 treatment inhibits FL-induced phosphorylation of FLT3 in EOL-1 and EM3 leukemia cells and FL-independent constitutive activation of ITD-mutant FLT3 in BaF3-ITD and MV4;11 cells. Activation of the downstream signaling proteins mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and AKT is also inhibited in these cell lines by antibody treatment. The antibody inhibits FL-stimulated proliferation of EOL-1 cells and ligand-independent proliferation of BaF3-ITD cells. In both EOL-1 xenograft and BaF3-ITD leukemia models, treatment with IMC-EB10 significantly prolongs the survival of leukemia-bearing mice. No overt toxicity is observed with IMC-EB10 treatment.

        "Doc_abstract":"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by a block in differentiation and uncontrolled proliferation. FLT3 is a commonly mutated gene found in AML patients. In clinical trials, the presence of a FLT3-ITD mutation significantly correlates with an increased risk of relapse and dismal overall survival. Therefore, activated FLT3 is a promising molecular target for AML therapies. In this study, we have shown that green tea polyphenols including (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), and (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG) suppress the proliferation of AML cells. Interestingly, EGCG, EGC and ECG showed the inhibition of FLT3 expression in cell lines harboring FLT3 mutations. In the THP-1 cells harboring FLT3 wild-type, EGCG showed the suppression of cell proliferation but did not suppress the expression of FLT3 even at the concentration that suppress 100% cell proliferation. Moreover, EGCG-, EGC-and ECG-treated cells showed the suppression of MAPK, AKT and STAT5 phosphorylation. Altogether, we suggest that green tea polyphenols could serve as reagents for treatment or prevention of leukemia harboring FLT3 mutations. ",

Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting FLT3 have developed as attractive treatment options. Because relapses occur after initial responses, identification of FLT3-ITD-mediated signaling events are important to facilitate novel therapeutic interventions. Here, we have determined the growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic mechanisms of 2 small molecule inhibitors of FLT3, AG1295 or PKC412, in hematopoietic progenitor cells, human leukemic cell lines, and primary AML cells expressing FLT3-ITD. Inactivation of the PI3-kinase pathway, but not of Ras-mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling, was essential to elicit cytotoxic responses. Both compounds induced up-regulation of proapoptotic BH3-only proteins Bim and Puma, and subsequent cell death. However, only silencing of Bim, or its direct transcriptional activator FOXO3a, abrogated apoptosis efficiently. Similar findings were made in bone marrow cells from gene-targeted mice lacking Bim and/or Puma infected with FLT3-ITD and treated with inhibitor, where loss of Puma only provided transient protection from apoptosis, but loss of Bim preserved clonal survival upon FLT3-ITD inhibition.",

Despite high remission rates with chemotherapy standard-of-care treatment, the disease eventually relapses in a major proportion of patients. Activating Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutations are found in approximately 30% of patients with AML. Targeting FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase has shown encouraging results in treating FLT3-mutated AML. Responses, however, are not sustained and acquired resistance has been a clinical challenge. Treatment options to overcome resistance are currently the focus of research. We report here the preclinical evaluation of AMG 925, a potent, selective, and bioavailable FLT3/cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) dual kinase inhibitor. AMG 925 inhibited AML xenograft tumor growth by 96% to 99% without significant body weight loss. The antitumor activity of AMG 925 correlated with the inhibition of STAT5 and RB phosphorylation, the pharmacodynamic markers for inhibition of FLT3 and CDK4, respectively. In addition, AMG 925 was also found to inhibit FLT3 mutants (e.g., D835Y) that are resistant to the current FLT3 inhibitors (e.g., AC220 and sorafenib). CDK4 is a cyclin D-dependent kinase that plays an essential central role in regulating cell proliferation in response to external growth signals. A critical role of the CDK4-RB pathway in cancer development has been well established. CDK4-specific inhibitors are being developed for treating RB-positive cancer. AMG 925, which combines inhibition of two kinases essential for proliferation and survival of FLT3-mutated AML cells, may improve and prolong clinical responses.",

Although there has been some success in identifying tyrosine kinase inhibitors that block the function of FLT3 ITD, there remains a continued need for effective treatment of this disease. We have identified the psychotropic drug pimozide as an effective inhibitor of STAT5 function. Pimozide inhibits the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5, leading to the death of AML cells through the induction of apoptosis. Pimozide shows a combinatorial effect with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors midostaurin (PKC412) and sunitinib in the inhibition of STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation and the induction of apoptosis. Significantly, pimozide reduces the tumor burden in a mouse model of FLT3-driven AML.

Recent researches reveal a role of FLT3 in monocyte differentiation in hematopoiesis. We analyzed the clinical impact of FLT3 alterations in adult AML patients excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) who received induction chemotherapy according to morphologic classification. Retrospective review of medical records from three centers in Korea between 1997 and 2007 was performed. Polymerase chain reaction was performed on genomic DNA derived from blood samples of patients before induction chemotherapy for FLT3-ITD detection. We assessed overall survival (OS), first disease-free survival (1-DFS), and response to induction chemotherapy. One hundred eighty-four patients (median age 49.1 years, range 16.0-76.5) with AML excluding APL received induction chemotherapy from three centers. FLT3-ITD was detected in 22 patients. One hundred forty-one patients were below age 60. One hundred seventy-nine patients received induction chemotherapy with cytarabine and idarubicin (AId) regimen. One hundred nineteen patients achieved complete remission (CR) after first induction chemotherapy. FLT3-ITD was not related to achievement of CR. 1-DFS was longer in patients without FLT3-ITD (median 1-DFS 16.5 vs. 8.5 months, p = 0.025). 1-DFS was not different according to FLT3-ITD status in nonmonocyte lineage leukemia (p = 0.355), while 1-DFS was shorter in monocyte lineage leukemia for FLT3-ITD positive patients (20.9 vs. 2.4 months, p < 0.001). FLT3-ITD had no impact on OS except for monocyte lineage, where OS was significantly shorter in FLT3-ITD positive group (39.4 vs. 6.0 months, p = 0.026). Moreover FLT3-ITD was stronger prognostic factors in monocyte lineage AML than risk stratification based on cytogenetics. Status of FLT3-ITD should be analyzed differently in AML patients according to morphologic profile. FLT3-ITD is a predictive and prognostic marker only in monocyte lineage patients.

Dose-dependent down modulation of receptor phosphorylation and downstream signaling [signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase] in MV4;11 cells with CHIR-258 confirmed the molecular mechanism of action. Target modulation of phospho-FLT3, phospho-STAT5, and phospho-ERK in MV4;11 tumors was achieved at biologically active doses of CHIR-258. Tumor regressions and eradication of AML cells from the bone marrow were shown in s.c. and bone marrow engraftment leukemic xenograft models. Tumor responses were characterized by decreased cellular proliferation and positive immunohistochemical staining for active caspase-3 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, suggesting cell death was mediated in part via apoptosis.;Our data indicate that CHIR-258 may be an effective therapy in FLT3-associated AML and warrants clinical trials.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Tumor-suppressor genes are inactivated by methylation in several cancers including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Src homology-2 (SH2)-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) is a negative regulator of the JAK/STAT pathway. Transcriptional silencing of SHP-1 plays a critical role in the development and progression of cancers through STAT3 activation. 5-Azacytidine (5-Aza) is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor that causes DNA demethylation resulting in re-expression of silenced SHP-1. Lestaurtinib (CEP-701) is a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that potently inhibits FLT3 tyrosine kinase and induces hematological remission in AML patients harboring the internal tandem duplication of the FLT3 gene (FLT3-ITD). However, the majority of patients in clinical trials developed resistance to CEP-701. Therefore, the aim of this study, was to assess the effect of re-expression of SHP-1 on sensitivity to CEP-701 in resistant AML cells.;Resistant cells harboring the FLT3-ITD were developed by overexposure of MV4-11 to CEP-701, and the effects of 5-Aza treatment were investigated. Apoptosis and cytotoxicity of CEP-701 were determined using Annexin V and MTS assays, respectively. Gene expression was performed by quantitative real-time PCR. STATs activity was examined by western blotting and the methylation profile of SHP-1 was studied using MS-PCR and pyrosequencing analysis. Repeated-measures ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for statistical analysis.;The cytotoxic dose of CEP-701 on resistant cells was significantly higher in comparison with parental and MV4-11R-cep + 5-Aza cells (p = 0.004). The resistant cells showed a significant higher viability and lower apoptosis compared with other cells (p < 0.001). Expression of SHP-1 was 7-fold higher in MV4-11R-cep + 5-Aza cells compared to parental and resistant cells (p = 0.011). STAT3 was activated in resistant cells. Methylation of SHP-1 was significantly decreased in MV4-11R-cep + 5-Aza cells (p = 0.002).;The restoration of SHP-1 expression induces sensitivity towards CEP-701 and could serve as a target in the treatment of AML. Our findings support the hypothesis that, the tumor-suppressor effect of SHP-1 is lost due to epigenetic silencing and its re-expression might play an important role in re-inducing sensitivity to TKIs. Thus, SHP-1 is a plausible candidate for a role in the development of CEP-701 resistance in FLT3-ITD+ AML patients.",

There is no evidence for a standard salvage regimen and most centers use a combination of an anthracycline and cytarabine (AraC). The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of two age-adjusted regimens containing AraC and cyclophosphamide applied for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML.;We retrospectively analyzed 60 patients (24 male, 36 female; median age 56 years) with relapsed or refractory AML who were treated with a combination of AraC and cyclophosphamide monocentrically between October 2000 and January 2013. Two different protocols containing either high-dose (hAC) or intermediate-dose cytarabin (iAC) have been applied dependent on age and performance status.;We demonstrate an overall response rate (CR + PR) induced by hAC and iAC of 56.7 %. Importantly, a complete remission rate (CR + CRp) of 52.2 % was found in patients who received the hAC regimen while only 8.8 % of patients achieved a CR following the iAC protocol (p < 0.001). The rate of refractory disease was 26.1 and 47.1 %, respectively. High-risk cytogenetics, i.e., a complex aberrant or monosomal karyotype had no effect on achievement of CR after hAC. In addition, there was no impact of activating FLT3 mutations on response to treatment according to the hAC regimen. In the cohort of patients treated with the iAC protocol, treatment-related mortality of 11.8 % within 60 days was observed but none of the patients who received the hAC regimen died within the first 2 months following chemotherapy. The toxicity profile was acceptable at both cytarabine dose levels. Importantly, 19 patients (82.6 %) of the hAC cohort underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as consecutive treatment.;The hAC regimen represents a promising therapeutic approach to induce a second CR in younger patients with relapsed or refractory AML prior to HSCT without using anthracyclines.",

We determined whether baseline and/or early changes in the methylation of long interspersed element (LINE)-1 or CDH13 correlate with bone marrow blast clearance, hematological response, or survival in patients with AML treated with azacitidine.;An open label, phase I/II trial was performed in 40 AML patients (median bone marrow blast count was 42%) unfit for intensive chemotherapy treated with azacitidine 75 mg/m(2)/day subcutaneously for 5 days every 4 weeks. Bone marrow mononuclear cell samples were taken on day 0 (pretreatment) and day 15 during the first treatment cycle; LINE-1 and CDH13 methylation levels were quantified by methylation-specific, semiquantitative, real-time polymerase chain reaction.;Treatment with azacitidine significantly reduced LINE-1 but not CDH13 methylation levels over the first cycle (P < 0.0001). Absolute LINE-1 methylation levels tended to be lower on day 0 (P = 0.06) and day 15 of cycle 1 (P = 0.03) in patients who went on to achieve subsequent complete remission, partial remission or hematological improvement versus patients with stable disease. However, the decrease in LINE-1 methylation over the first treatment cycle did not correlate with subsequent response (P = 0.31). Baseline methylation levels of LINE-1 or CDH13 did not correlate with disease-related prognostic factors, including cytogenetic risk, relapsed/refractory AML, or presence of NPM1 or FLT3 mutations.

Thus, it will be crucial to carefully characterize the activity of every single compound against different activating and resistance FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations. Here we tested the efficacy of sunitinib and sorafenib to inhibit primary FLT3 activating mutations (ITD and D835Y) and of secondary resistance mutations.;Ba/F3 cell lines stably expressing oncogenic FLT3 mutations were used to calculate cellular IC(50) values for sunitinib and sorafenib using cell proliferation assays. Differential IC(50) values for sorafenib toward FLT3-ITD and FLT3-D835Y were confirmed by Western blotting. Cell death was measured by propidium-iodide staining and flow cytometry.;Sorafenib inhibits FLT3-ITD more potent than FLT3-D835Y, while sunitinib is equally effective against both mutant forms of FLT3. Importantly, sensitivity toward sorafenib and sunitinib varies between the different secondary FLT3-ITD resistance mutations.;These results establish sensitivity profiles for the FLT3 inhibitors sunitinib and sorafenib.

CXCR4 expression is associated with poor prognosis in AML patients with and without the mutated FLT3 gene.CXCL12 which is constrictively secreted from the BM stroma and AML cells is critical for the survival and retention of AML cells within the BM. In vitro, CXCR4 antagonists were shown to inhibit the migration of AML cells in response to CXCL12. In addition, such antagonists were shown to inhibit the survival and colony forming potential of AML cells and abrogate the protective effects of stromal cells on chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in AML cells. In vivo, using immune deficient mouse models, CXCR4 antagonists were found to induce the mobilization of AML cells and progenitor cells into the circulation and enhance anti leukemic effects of chemotherapy. The hypothesis that CXCL12/CXCR4 interactions contribute to the resistance of AML cells to signal transduction inhibitor- and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis is currently being tested in a series of Phase I/II studies in humans.",

In this study, we show that PKC412 exerts differential cell cycle effects on AML cells depending on the presence of FLT3 mutations. PKC412 elicits massive apoptosis without markedly affecting cell cycle patterns in AML cell lines with FLT3 mutations (MV4-11 and MOLM13), whereas it induces G2 arrest but not apoptosis in AML cell lines without FLT3 mutations (THP-1 and U937). In MV4-11 and MOLM13 cells, PKC412 inactivates Myt-1 and activates CDC25c, leading to the activation of CDC2. Activated CDC2 phosphorylates Bad at serine-128 and facilitates its translocation to the mitochondria, where Bad triggers apoptosis. In contrast, PKC412 inactivates CDC2 by inducing serine-216 phosphorylation and subsequent cytoplasmic sequestration of CDC25c in THP-1 and U937 cells. As a result, cells are arrested in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, but do not undergo apoptosis because Bad is not activated. The FLT3 mutation-dependent differential cell cycle effect of PKC412 is considered an important factor when PKC412 is combined with cell cycle-specific anticancer drugs in the treatment of cancer and leukemia.",

        "Doc_abstract":"FLT3 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is expressed on early hematopoietic progenitor cells and plays an important role in stem cell survival and differentiation. Two different types of functionally important FLT3 mutations have been identified. Internal tandem duplication mutations arise from duplications of the juxtamembrane portion of the gene and result in constitutive activation of the FLT3 protein. This alteration has been identified in approximately 20% to 30% of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and appears to be associated with a worse prognosis. The second type of FLT3 mutation, missense mutations at aspartic acid residue 835, occurs in approximately 7.0% of acute myelogenous leukemia cases. These mutations also appear to be activating and to portend a worse prognosis. Identification of FLT3 mutations is important because it provides prognostic information and may play a pivotal role in determining appropriate treatment options. We have developed an assay to identify both internal tandem duplication and D835 FLT3 mutations in a single multiplex polymerase chain reaction. After amplification, the polymerase chain reaction products are analyzed by capillary electrophoresis for length mutations and resistance to EcoRV digestion. Here we describe the performance characteristics of the assay, assay validation, and our clinical experience using this assay to analyze 147 clinical specimens.",

Crenolanib is also an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha and beta and is in clinical trials in both gastrointestinal stromal tumors and gliomas. Methods We tested crenolanib interactions with the multidrug resistance-associated ATP-binding cassette proteins ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), ABCG2 (breast cancer resistance protein) and ABCC1 (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1), which are expressed on AML cells and other cancer cells and are important components of the blood-brain barrier. Results We found that crenolanib is a substrate of ABCB1, as evidenced by approximate five-fold resistance of ABCB1-overexpressing cells to crenolanib, reversal of this resistance by the ABCB1-specific inhibitor PSC-833 and stimulation of ABCB1 ATPase activity by crenolanib. In contrast, crenolanib was not a substrate of ABCG2 or ABCC1. Additionally, it did not inhibit substrate transport by ABCB1, ABCG2 or ABCC1, at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. Finally, incubation of the FLT3-ITD AML cell lines MV4-11 and MOLM-14 with crenolanib at a pharmacologically relevant concentration of 500 nM did not induce upregulation of ABCB1 cell surface expression. Conclusions Thus ABCB1 expression confers resistance to crenolanib and likely limits crenolanib penetration of the central nervous system, but crenolanib at therapeutic concentrations should not alter cellular exposure to ABC protein substrate chemotherapy drugs.

A number of chromosomal abnormalities are used to predict outcome and stratify therapeutic risk groups in children with AML. Recently, alterations in receptor tyrosine kinases, tyrosine phosphatases and in oncogenes such as RAS have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AML. This article aims to review the recent development in diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of AML. Better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of AML has led to the development of target-specific therapies. Some of the new classes of drugs include monoclonal antibody directed against the CD33 antigen, farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTI), and FMSlike tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitors. The role of allogenic SCT, particularly whether it should be done during first CR or reserved for second remission, remains the most controversial issue in pediatric AML.

The role of consolidation chemotherapy consisting of middle-dosage Ara-C (MD-Ara-C) on long term survival was evaluated.;Of 143 patients, 112 (78.3%) achieved CR after the first course of HAD/HAI induction treatment, and early death occurred in only one case. Notably, the CR rate of patients with an initial WBC count ≥100×10(9)/L was not significantly different from those with an initial WBC count<100× 10(9)/L (70.4% vs 80.2%, P=0.266). The CR rate for the patients with favorable, intermediate and unfavorable integrated genetics risk factors was 93.7%, 71.4% and 61.3%, respectively, the difference between groups was statistically significant (P=0.001).

We then observed increasingly better survival with more intense first-line therapy, in some high-risk patients including autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In multivariate analysis, age, severe thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels, and failure to achieve CR after induction independently predicted longer OS, whereas complex karyotype predicted shorter OS only in univariate analysis.

Ponatinib has demonstrated early clinical efficacy in chemotherapy-resistant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in FLT3. We assessed the in vitro activity of ponatinib against clinically relevant FLT3-ITD mutant isoforms that confer resistance to AC220 or sorafenib. Substitution of the FLT3 \"gatekeeper\" phenylalanine with leucine (F691L) conferred mild resistance to ponatinib, but substitutions at the FLT3 activation loop (AL) residue D835 conferred a high degree of resistance. Saturation mutagenesis of FLT3-ITD exclusively identified FLT3 AL mutations at positions D835, D839, and Y842. The switch control inhibitor DCC-2036 was similarly inactive against FLT3 AL mutations.

Current treatment strategies for acute myeloid leukemia are based on both patient-related parameters such as age and performance status as well as the intrinsic characteristics of particular disease subtypes. Subtyping of acute myeloid leukemia requires an integration of information from the patient's clinical history (such as any prior preleukemic myeloid neoplasm or cytotoxic potentially leukemogenic therapy), the leukemia morphology, cytogenetic findings, and the mutation status of particular genes (NPM1, FLT3, and CEBPA). In recent years, a barrage of information has become available regarding gene mutations that occur in acute myeloid leukemia and their influence on prognosis. Future therapies for acute myeloid leukemia will increasingly rely on the genetic signatures of individual leukemias and will adjust therapy to the predicted disease aggressiveness as well as employ therapies targeted against particular deregulated genetic pathways. This article reviews current standards for diagnosing and classifying acute myeloid leukemia according to the 2008 WHO Classification. Data that have subsequently accumulated regarding newly characterized gene mutations are also presented. It is anticipated that future leukemia classifications will employ a combination of karyotypic features and the gene mutation pattern to stratify patients to increasingly tailored treatment plans.",

To explore the in vivo consequences of an activating FLT3 internal tandem duplication mutation (FLT3-ITD), we created a transgenic mouse model in which FLT3-ITD was expressed under the control of the vav hematopoietic promoter. Five independent lines of vav-FLT3-ITD transgenic mice developed a myeloproliferative disease with high penetrance and a disease latency of 6-12 months. The phenotype was characterized by splenomegaly, megakaryocytic hyperplasia, and marked thrombocythemia, but without leukocytosis, polycythemia, or marrow fibrosis, displaying features reminiscent of the human disease essential thrombocythemia (ET). Clonal immature B- or T-lymphoid disease was observed in two additional founder mice, respectively, that could be secondarily transplanted to recipient mice that rapidly developed lymphoid disease. Treatment of these mice with the FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PKC412, resulted in suppression of disease and a statistically significant prolongation of survival. These results demonstrate that FLT3-ITD is capable of inducing myeloproliferative as well as lymphoid disease, and indicate that small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be an effective treatment for lymphoid malignancies in humans that are associated with activating mutations in FLT3.",

Further, among elderly patients, aggressive therapy options are often limited due to other medical conditions and decreased tolerance of these patients to conventional chemotherapy. Internal tandem duplications (ITD) of the FLT3 juxtamembrane domain occur in 20-30% of AML patients and predict poor outcome. First clinical data with the FLT3 inhibitor tandutinib demonstrated antileukemic activity in approximately half of the patients--predominantly with FLT3 ITD positive AML. But the data also show that optimal use of tandutinib will require combination therapy with cytotoxic agents. Notably, single agent tandutinib has not been associated with myelosuppression, mucositis or cardiac toxicity--the dose limiting toxicities of AML chemotherapy. We determined the feasibility of combining tandutinib with the standard \"3 + 7\" induction regimen in AML and show that, in contrast to other structurally unrelated FLT3 inhibitors recently evaluated in clinical trials, the use of tandutinib displayed application sequence independent synergistic antileukemic effects in combination with cytarabine and daunorubicin. Strong synergistic antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects were thereby predominantly seen on FLT3 ITD positive blasts. Further we demonstrate, that addition of tandutinib may allow dose reduction of chemotherapy without loss of overall antileukemic activity--resulting in a potential decrease of side effects. This approach might be an interesting novel strategy especially in the treatment of elderly/comorbid patients. Our data provide a rationale for combining tandutinib with induction chemotherapy in intensified as well as in dose reduction protocols for FLT3 ITD positive AML.",

Here we identified that the nuclear factor of activated T cells, NFATc1, is frequently overexpressed in FLT3-ITD-positive (FLT3-ITD+) AML. NFATc1 knockdown using inducible short hairpin RNA or pharmacological NFAT inhibition with cyclosporine A (CsA) or VIVIT significantly augmented sorafenib-induced apoptosis of FLT3-ITD+ cells.

        "Doc_abstract":"FLT3 (fms-related tyrosine kinase/Flk2/Stk-2) is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) primarily expressed on hematopoietic cells. In blasts from acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients, 2 classes of FLT3 activating mutations have been identified: internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in the juxtamembrane domain (25%-30% of patients) and point mutations in the kinase domain activation loop (7%-8% of patients). FLT3-ITD mutations are the most common molecular defect identified in AML and have been shown to be an independent prognostic factor for decreased survival. FLT3-ITD is therefore an attractive molecular target for therapy. SU11248 is a recently described selective inhibitor with selectivity for split kinase domain RTKs, including platelet-derived growth factor receptors, vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, and KIT. We show that SU11248 also has potent activity against wild-type FLT3 (FLT3-WT), FLT3-ITD, and FLT3 activation loop (FLT3-Asp835) mutants in phosphorylation assays. SU11248 inhibits FLT3-driven phosphorylation and induces apoptosis in vitro. In addition, SU11248 inhibits FLT3-induced VEGF production. The in vivo efficacy of SU11248 was investigated in 2 FLT3-ITD models: a subcutaneous tumor xenograft model and a bone marrow engraftment model. We show that SU11248 (20 mg/kg/d) dramatically regresses FLT3-ITD tumors in the subcutaneous tumor xenograft model and prolongs survival in the bone marrow engraftment model. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis in subcutaneous tumors showed that a single administration of an efficacious drug dose potently inhibits FLT3-ITD phosphorylation for up to 16 hours following a single dose. These results suggest that further exploration of SU11248 activity in AML patients is warranted.",

This model has significant implications for the development of novel therapies, but its clinical relevance has yet to be determined.;To identify an LSC gene expression signature and test its association with clinical outcomes in AML.;Retrospective study of global gene expression (microarray) profiles of LSC-enriched subpopulations from primary AML and normal patient samples, which were obtained at a US medical center between April 2005 and July 2007, and validation data sets of global transcriptional profiles of AML tumors from 4 independent cohorts (n = 1047).;Identification of genes discriminating LSC-enriched populations from other subpopulations in AML tumors; and association of LSC-specific genes with overall, event-free, and relapse-free survival and with therapeutic response.;Expression levels of 52 genes distinguished LSC-enriched populations from other subpopulations in cell-sorted AML samples. An LSC score summarizing expression of these genes in bulk primary AML tumor samples was associated with clinical outcomes in the 4 independent patient cohorts. High LSC scores were associated with worse overall, event-free, and relapse-free survival among patients with either normal karyotypes or chromosomal abnormalities. For the largest cohort of patients with normal karyotypes (n = 163), the LSC score was significantly associated with overall survival as a continuous variable (hazard ratio [HR], 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.22; log-likelihood P <.001). The absolute risk of death by 3 years was 57% (95% CI, 43%-67%) for the low LSC score group compared with 78% (95% CI, 66%-86%) for the high LSC score group (HR, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.3-2.7]; log-rank P = .002). In another cohort with available data on event-free survival for 70 patients with normal karyotypes, the risk of an event by 3 years was 48% (95% CI, 27%-63%) in the low LSC score group vs 81% (95% CI, 60%-91%) in the high LSC score group (HR, 2.4 [95% CI, 1.3-4.5]; log-rank P = .006).

To a major part this is attributed to drug resistance of FLT3-ITD-positive leukemic cells. Against this background, we have devised an antibody array approach to identify proteins, which are differentially expressed by hematopoietic cells in relation to activated FLT3 signaling. Selective upregulation of antiapoptotic myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) was found in FLT3-ITD-positive cell lines and primary mononuclear cells from AML patients as compared with FLT3-wild-type controls. Upregulation of MCL-1 was dependent on FLT3 signaling as confirmed by its reversion upon pharmacological inhibition of FLT3 activity by the kinase inhibitor PKC412 as well as siRNA-mediated suppression of FLT3. Heterologously expressed MCL-1 substituted for FLT3 signaling by conferring resistance of hematopoietic cells to antileukemia drugs such as cytarabine and daunorubicin, and to the proapoptotic BH3 mimetic ABT-737. Conversely, suppression of endogenous MCL-1 by siRNA or by flavopiridol treatment sensitized FLT3-ITD-expressing hematopoietic cells to cytotoxic and targeted therapeutics. In conclusion, MCL-1 is an essential effector of FLT3-ITD-mediated drug resistance. Therapeutic targeting of MCL-1 is a promising strategy to overcome drug resistance in FLT3-ITD-positive AML.",

Here, we provide an overview of FLT3 inhibitors under preclinical and clinical investigation, and we discuss mechanisms whereby AML cells develop resistance to FLT3 inhibitors, and the ways in which combination therapy could potentially be utilized to override drug resistance. We discuss how the cross-talk between major downstream signaling pathways, such as PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR, RAS/Raf/MEK/ERK, and Jak/STAT, can be exploited for therapeutic purposes by targeting key signaling molecules with selective inhibitors, such as mTOR inhibitors, HSP90 inhibitors, or farnesyltransferase inhibitors, and identifying those agents with the ability to positively combine with inhibitors of FLT3, such as PKC412 and sunitinib.

Nonetheless, constitutively active mutant FLT3 (FLT3-ITD) causally contributes to transformation and is associated with poor prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) can counteract deregulated gene expression profiles and decrease oncoprotein stability, which renders them candidate drugs for AML treatment. However, these drugs have pleiotropic effects and it is often unclear how they correct oncogenic transcriptomes and proteomes. We report here that treatment of AML cells with the HDACi LBH589 induces the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBCH8 and degradation of FLT3-ITD. Gain- and loss-of-function approaches show that UBCH8 and the ubiquitin-ligase SIAH1 physically interact with and target FLT3-ITD for proteasomal degradation. These ubiquitinylating enzymes though have a significantly lesser effect on wild-type FLT3. Furthermore, physiological and pharmacological stimulation of FLT3 phosphorylation, inhibition of FLT3-ITD autophosphorylation and analysis of kinase-inactive FLT3-ITD revealed that tyrosine phosphorylation determines degradation of FLT3 and FLT3-ITD by the proteasome. These results provide novel insights into antileukemic activities of HDACi and position UBCH8, which have been implicated primarily in processes in the nucleus, as a previously unrecognized important modulator of FLT3-ITD stability and leukemic cell survival.",

In this study, we found that AZD6244 (ARRY-142886), a novel inhibitor of MEK1/2 kinases, effectively inhibited the proliferation of acute biphenotypic leukemia MV4-11 and acute monocytic leukemia MOLM13 cells. The concentrations that inhibited 50% growth were approximately 0.3 and 1.2 microM, respectively, as measured by thymidine uptake on day 2 of culture. AZD6244 potently down-regulated the levels of phospho-ERK1/2 and its downstream effector, p-p70S6K, in the MV4-11 and MOLM13 cells as measured by Western blot analysis. Interestingly, when AZD6244 was combined with sunitinib, a FLT3 kinase inhibitor, growth inhibition and apoptosis of both MV4-11 and MOLM13 cells were synergistically enhanced in association with further down-regulation of phospho-ERK1/2 and p-p70S6K in these cells.

Moreover, INK128 co-administered with the Bcl-2/xL antagonist ABT-737 sharply induced cell death in multiple acute myeloid leukemia cell lines, including TKI-resistant FLT3-ITD mutants and primary acute myeloid leukemia blasts carrying various genetic aberrations e.g., FLT3, IDH2, NPM1, and Kras, while exerting minimal toxicity toward normal hematopoietic CD34(+) cells. Combined treatment was particularly active against CD34(+)/CD38(-)/CD123(+) primitive leukemic progenitor cells. The INK128/ABT-737 regimen was also effective in the presence of a protective stromal microenvironment. Notably, INK128 was more potent than the TORC1 inhibitor rapamycin in down-regulating Mcl-1, diminishing AKT and 4EBP1 phosphorylation, and potentiating ABT-737 activity. Mcl-1 ectopic expression dramatically attenuated INK128/ABT-737 lethality, indicating an important functional role for Mcl-1 down-regulation in INK128/ABT-737 actions. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that combined treatment markedly diminished Bax, Bak, and Bim binding to all major anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 members (Bcl-2/Bcl-xL/Mcl-1), while Bax/Bak knockdown reduced cell death. Finally, INK128/ABT-737 co-administration sharply attenuated leukemia growth and significantly prolonged survival in a systemic acute myeloid leukemia xenograft model. Analysis of subcutaneous acute myeloid leukemia-derived tumors revealed significant decrease in 4EBP1 phosphorylation and Mcl-1 protein level, consistent with results obtained in vitro.

Examining the anti- and proapoptotic proteins in constitutively activated FLT3 signalling in BaF3/ITD and MV4-11 cells, we found that the level of Bcl-2 antagonist of cell death (BAD) phosphorylation was greatly decreased in response to FLT3 inhibition. Both Ser-112 and Ser-136 of BAD are rapidly dephosphorylated after treatment with the FLT3 inhibitor CEP-701 in BaF3/ITD and MV4-11 cells. In confirmation of the cell line data, BAD was highly phosphorylated in both constitutively activated wild-type and mutant FLT3 primary AML samples, and rapidly dephosphorylated after treatment of the primary samples with CEP-701. Upstream proteins known to phosphorylate BAD include Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (Erk/ MAPK), Pim-1 and Pim-2. We and other groups have shown that constitutively activated FLT3 induces multiple signalling pathways, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, Erk/MAPK and Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (Jak/STAT). Thus, BAD may be a nexus point upon which these multiple signalling pathways converge in FLT3-mediated cell survival. In support of this, siRNA knockdown of BAD expression in MV4-11 cells conferred resistance to CEP-701-mediated apoptosis. Our data suggests that Pim-1 is one of the principal kinases mediating the anti-apoptotic function of FLT3/ITD signalling via the phosphorylation of BAD.",

We previously reported that bone marrow-derived stromal cells inhibit chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

Further, CXCR4 inhibition partially abrogated the protective effects of stromal cells on chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in AML cells. Fetal liver tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) gene mutations activate CXCR4 signaling, and coculture with stromal cells significantly diminished antileukemia effects of FLT3 inhibitors in cells with mutated FLT3. Notably, CXCR4 inhibition increased the sensitivity of FLT3-mutated leukemic cells to the apoptogenic effects of the FLT3 inhibitor sorafenib. In vivo studies demonstrated that AMD3465, alone or in combination with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, induced mobilization of AML cells and progenitor cells into circulation and enhanced antileukemic effects of chemotherapy and sorafenib, resulting in markedly reduced leukemia burden and prolonged survival of the animals. These findings indicate that SDF-1alpha/CXCR4 interactions contribute to the resistance of leukemic cells to signal transduction inhibitor- and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in systems mimicking the physiologic microenvironment.

Towards this, we selected a naïve antibody phage display library on both recombinant FLT3 receptor protein and FLT3-expressing leukemia cells using a tailored selection scheme that was designed to isolate antagonistic phage antibodies that not only interfere with receptor/ligand binding but also trigger receptor internalization upon cell surface binding. Phage antibodies were screened first for their ability to bind to cell surface receptor and induce receptor internalization, followed by their activity in blocking ligand-receptor interaction and neutralizing ligand-stimulated receptor activation and cell proliferation. We identified three fully human antibodies, EB10, A2IN, and D4-3, which bound specifically to both soluble and cell surface-expressed FLT3. All three antibodies were shown to be internalized upon binding to cell surface-expressed receptor in a time-dependent fashion. EB10 and D4-3 blocked ligand binding to the receptor with IC(50)s of 14 and 7 nM, respectively. Further, EB10 and D4-3 inhibited FLT3 ligand-induced receptor phosphorylation and cell proliferation in EOL-1 leukemia cells.

Patients with AML who have internal tandem duplication mutations in the tyrosine kinase receptor FLT3 (FLT3-ITD) face particularly poor outcomes, even after allo-HSCT, which appears to only partially mitigate the poor prognosis associated with this mutation. Experimental treatments to reduce the likelihood of relapse and improve survival following allo-HSCT include maintenance with FLT3-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), several of which are currently being evaluated in clinical studies. Preliminary data and case reports suggest that FLT3 TKIs can be effective in the post-transplantation setting, particularly for patients with FLT3-ITD mutations.

        "Doc_abstract":"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease with respect to presentation and clinical outcome. The prognostic value of recently identified somatic mutations has not been systematically evaluated in a phase 3 trial of treatment for AML.;We performed a mutational analysis of 18 genes in 398 patients younger than 60 years of age who had AML and who were randomly assigned to receive induction therapy with high-dose or standard-dose daunorubicin. We validated our prognostic findings in an independent set of 104 patients.;We identified at least one somatic alteration in 97.3% of the patients. We found that internal tandem duplication in FLT3 (FLT3-ITD), partial tandem duplication in MLL (MLL-PTD), and mutations in ASXL1 and PHF6 were associated with reduced overall survival (P=0.001 for FLT3-ITD, P=0.009 for MLL-PTD, P=0.05 for ASXL1, and P=0.006 for PHF6); CEBPA and IDH2 mutations were associated with improved overall survival (P=0.05 for CEBPA and P=0.01 for IDH2). The favorable effect of NPM1 mutations was restricted to patients with co-occurring NPM1 and IDH1 or IDH2 mutations. We identified genetic predictors of outcome that improved risk stratification among patients with AML, independently of age, white-cell count, induction dose, and post-remission therapy, and validated the significance of these predictors in an independent cohort. High-dose daunorubicin, as compared with standard-dose daunorubicin, improved the rate of survival among patients with DNMT3A or NPM1 mutations or MLL translocations (P=0.001) but not among patients with wild-type DNMT3A, NPM1, and MLL (P=0.67).;We found that DNMT3A and NPM1 mutations and MLL translocations predicted an improved outcome with high-dose induction chemotherapy in patients with AML. These findings suggest that mutational profiling could potentially be used for risk stratification and to inform prognostic and therapeutic decisions regarding patients with AML.

We have investigated DNA repair in FLT3-ITD and wild-type (WT) cells. Using the comet assay, we have demonstrated that the FLT3 inhibitor PKC412 significantly inhibits repair of DNA damage in the MV4-11-FLT3-ITD cell line and FLT3-ITD patient samples but not in the HL-60-FLT3-WT cell line or FLT3-WT patient samples. Following the discovery that transcript levels of the DNA repair gene RAD51 are significantly correlated with FLT3 transcript levels in FLT3-ITD patients, we further investigated the role of RAD51 in FLT3-ITD-AML. The reduction in DNA repair in PKC412-treated FLT3-ITD cells was shown to be associated with downregulation of RAD51 mRNA and protein expression and correlates with the maintenance of phosphorylated H2AX levels, implying that PKC412 inhibits the homologous recombination double-strand break repair pathway in FLT3-ITD cells. Using FLT3-short interfering RNA (siRNA), we also demonstrated that genetic silencing of FLT3 results in RAD51 downregulation in FLT3-ITD cells but not in FLT3-WT cells. This work suggests that the use of FLT3 inhibitors such as PKC412 may reverse the drug-resistant phenotype of FLT3-ITD-AML cells by inhibiting repair of chemotherapy-induced genotoxic damage and thereby reduce the risk of disease relapse.",

We therefore studied the effect of cytarabine and the FLT3 inhibitor lestaurtinib, either alone or in combination, on in vitro survival of blast cells from 36 cases of AML (14 FLT3/WT, 11 FLT3/ITD+ and 11 FLT3/TKD+). All three groups showed similar sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of cytarabine but FLT3/ITD mutant level was inversely correlated with cytarabine cytotoxicity (P = 0.04) whereas FLT3/TKD mutant level had no impact. FLT3/TKD+ cells showed a similar response to lestaurtinib as FLT3/WT cells, whereas FLT3/ITD+ cells were more sensitive (P = 0.004). There was no correlation between mutant level and lestaurtinib sensitivity for either FLT3/ITD+ or FLT3/TKD+ cells.

A single-gene sensitive mutational screening approach may be helpful for better clarifying the exact timing of mutation occurrence, especially when FLT3 ITD appears to occur late, at disease progression. We developed an amplicon-based ultra-deep-sequencing (UDS) approach for FLT3 mutational screening. We exploited this highly sensitive technology for the retrospective screening of diagnosis, relapse and follow-up samples of 5 out of 256 cytogenetically normal (CN-) AML who were FLT3 wild-type at presentation, but tested ITD+ at relapse or disease progression. Our study revealed that all patients carried a small ITD+ clone at diagnosis, which was undetectable by routine analysis (0,2-2% abundance). The dynamics of ITD+ clones from diagnosis to disease progression, assessed by UDS, reflected clonal evolution under treatment pressure. UDS appears as a valuable tool for FLT3 mutational screening and for the assessment of minimal residual disease (MRD) during follow-up, by detecting small ITD+ clones that may survive chemotherapy, evolve over time and definitely worsen the prognosis of CN-AML patients.

Sorafenib is effective in clearing leukemic blasts in chemorefractory FLT3-ITD(+) AML, but leukemia progression invariably occurs. Mechanisms of drug resistance are not completely understood. We hypothesized that a gene encoding tescalcin (TESC), known to be upregulated at leukemia progression during continuous sorafenib treatment and activate an Na(+)/H(+) exchanger type-1 (NHE1), may underlie tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance. TESC was highly expressed in FLT3-ITD(+) AML lines MOLM-13 and MV4-11, and its knockdown by small-interfering RNA lowered intracellular pH (pHi) and induced apoptosis. The results were recapitulated by treatment with an NHE1 inhibitor, 5-(N,N-hexamethylene) amiloride (HMA). Induction of sorafenib resistance in the MOLM-13 cell line (M13-RE) significantly increased its sensitivity to HMA. The later also enhanced suppression of FLT3 signaling by sorafenib in otherwise resistant cell lines. HMA treatment of MOLM-13 and MV4-11 as well as primary FLT3-ITD(+) AML cells significantly reduced leukemia initiation in anti-CD122-primed NOD/SCID mouse xenotransplantation. These observations provided novel information about the pathogenetic role of a TESC-NHE1-pHi axis in mediating sorafenib resistance in AML. ",

Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of FLT3/ITD kinase activity by a FLT3 selective inhibitor named FI-700 decreases affinity of α4β1 integrin to soluble VCAM-1. α4β1 integrin deactivation by FI-700 is independent of Rap1, which is the critical regulator of integrin inside-out signalling. In addition, selective inhibition of FLT3/ITD induces Pyk2 dephosphorylation together with the inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. Both wild-type and ITD-FLT3 proteins co-immunoprecipitated with β1 integrin and Pyk2 indicating the signal crosstalk between FLT3, β1 integrin and Pyk2.

Circulating blasts are cleared from the peripheral blood, while bone marrow blasts are either unaffected or are cleared from the marrow at a much slower rate. We used an in vitro model of FLT3-ITD AML blasts co-cultured with normal human bone marrow stromal cells to investigate the basis for this dichotomous response pattern to FLT3 inhibitors. We have found that in blasts on stroma, potent FLT3 inhibition predominantly results in cell cycle arrest rather than apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic effect is mediated through a combination of direct cell-cell contact and soluble factors. The addition of exogenous FLT3 ligand (FL) augments the protection, primarily by shifting the 50% inhibitory concentration for FLT3 inhibition upwards. Cytokine-activated extracellular regulated kinase (ERK), rather than STAT5, appears to be the most important downstream signalling protein mediating the protective effect, and inhibition of MEK significantly abrogates stromal-mediated resistance. These findings explain the phenomenon of peripheral blood versus bone marrow blast responses and suggest that the combination of potent FLT3 inhibition and MEK inhibition is a promising strategy for the treatment of FLT3-ITD AML.

Two critical features necessary for maximizing TKI tolerability and response duration are kinase selectivity and invulnerability to resistance-conferring kinase domain (KD) mutations in the intended target. No prior TKI has demonstrated both of these properties. Aiming to maximize selectivity, medicinal chemists have largely sought to create TKIs that bind to an inactive (type II) kinase conformation. Here we demonstrate that the investigational type I TKI crenolanib is a potent inhibitor of Fms tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) internal tandem duplication, a validated therapeutic target in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as well as all secondary KD mutants previously shown to confer resistance to the first highly active FLT3 TKI quizartinib. Moreover, crenolanib is highly selective for FLT3 relative to the closely related protein tyrosine kinase KIT, demonstrating that simultaneous FLT3/KIT inhibition, a prominent feature of other clinically active FLT3 TKIs, is not required for AML cell cytotoxicity in vitro and may contribute to undesirable toxicity in patients. A saturation mutagenesis screen of FLT3-internal tandem duplication failed to recover any resistant colonies in the presence of a crenolanib concentration well below what has been safely achieved in humans, suggesting that crenolanib has the potential to suppress KD mutation-mediated clinical resistance. Crenolanib represents the first TKI to exhibit both kinase selectivity and invulnerability to resistance-conferring KD mutations, which is unexpected of a type I inhibitor. Crenolanib has significant promise for achieving deep and durable responses in FLT3-mutant AML, and may have a profound impact upon future medicinal chemistry efforts in oncology. ",

Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is characterized commonly by a fusion between the PML gene and the RARA gene, genes targetable by arsenic (ATO) and retinoic acid (ATRA), respectively. A mutation in GATA1, common in AML of Down syndrome (ML-DS), renders cells more susceptible to cytarabine and anthracyclines, thus permitting targeted dose reductions to preserve high survival rates while reducing toxicity. In all other patients, Ras pathway mutations, KMT2A and other methyltransferase mutations, FLT3 mutations, and KIT mutations are all relatively common in childhood AML and all are potentially \"druggable\". The focus of this review is on those therapies likely to be clinically available in the near future. The preclinical and clinical data providing a rationale for testing in children of specific agents in children is discussed. Whether the expression of a potential target is sufficient to predict response to a targeted therapy is an open question in childhood AML. Development of clinical trials to evaluate targeted therapies in small molecularly defined subsets of AML will be the next great challenge for all cooperative groups in North America and Europe. ",

Subcutaneous injection of the transformed 32D cells caused leukemia in addition to subcutaneous tumors in C3H/HeJ mice. To develop a FLT3-targeted therapy, we examined tyrosine kinase inhibitors for in vitro growth suppression of the transformed 32D cells. A tyrosine kinase inhibitor, herbimycin A, remarkably inhibited the growth of the transformed 32D cells at 0.1 microM, at which concentration it was ineffective in parental 32D cells. Herbimycin A suppressed the constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of the mutant FLT3 but not the phosphorylation of the ligand-stimulated wild-type FLT3. In mice transplanted with the transformed 32D cells, the administration of herbimycin A prolonged the latency of disease or completely prevented leukemia, depending on the number of cells inoculated and schedule of drug administration.

So far, especially NPM1 mutations have not yet been evaluated exclusively in older patients.;We retrospectively analysed the prevalence of NPM1 and Flt3-ITD mutations and its association with complete remission (CR), and survival in 99 elderly patients (median age 71 yr, range 60-85 yr) newly diagnosed for AML. Primary treatment approach was curative in 54, and palliative in 38 patients, while seven patients received best supportive care only.

We can demonstrate a significant higher rate of CR comparing wildtype vs. NPM1 positive patients (40.5% for group 1 vs. 80.0% for group 2, P = 0.03) for patients receiving curative therapy. Interestingly, there is no significant difference in overall survival between group 1 and group 2 (Log-rank test P = 0.22, median 440 d vs. 1125 d). In contrast, patients carrying a Flt3-ITD mutation had a significant worse overall survival compared to wildtype patients (P = 0.03, median 210 d for group 3 + 4 vs. 634 d for group 1 + 2) while no difference of CR rate could be observed (42.8% vs. 48.9%, P = 0.91).;As elderly but medically fit patients with AML carrying a NPM1 mutation have a high CR rate, age itself should not be a barrier for induction treatment.

To assess the prognostic relevance of activating mutations of Flt3, pretreatment samples of 100 not-M3 AML patients, all of them subjected to an intensive chemotherapy regimen, were analyzed for Flt3/ITD; 25/100 patients had one or more Flt3-ITD.

Flt3/ITD had no impact on CR achievement while karyotype remained the most powerful prognostic factor (HR 2.8 95% CI 1.2 6.3).

Many genetic defects underlying MDS and AML have been identified thereby allowing the development of new molecular-targeted therapies. Several new classes of drugs have shown promise in early clinical trials and may probably alter the standard of care of these patients in the near future. Among these new drugs are farnesyltransferase inhibitors and receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors including FLT3 and VEGF inhibitors. These agents have been tested in patients with solid tumors and hematologic malignancies such as AML and MDS. Most of the studies in MDS are still in early stages of development. The DNA hypomethylating compounds azacytidine and decitabine may reduce hypermethylation and induce re-expression of key tumor suppressor genes in MDS.

Here we extended this material, enabling subgroup analysis based on FLT3 and NPM1 status, to further elucidate the influence of ABCB1 SNPs. De novo NK-AML patients (n = 201) were analysed for 1199G>A, 1236C>T, 2677G>T/A and 3435C>T, and correlations to outcome were investigated. FLT3 wild-type 1236C/C patients have significantly shorter OS compared to patients carrying the variant allele; medians 20 vs. 49 months, respectively, P = 0·017. There was also an inferior outcome in FLT3 wild-type 2677G/G patients compared to patients carrying the variant allele, median OS 20 vs. 35 months, respectively, P = 0·039. This was confirmed in Cox regression analysis. Our results indicate that ABCB1 1236C>T and 2677G>T may be used as prognostic markers to distinguish relatively high risk patients in the intermediate risk FLT3 wild-type group, which may contribute to future individualizing of treatment strategies.

Increasing the cell dose, using more permissive recipients, and alternative tissue sources did not cause AML engraftment in most previously nonengrafting AML samples. Homing of AML cells to the marrow was the same between engrafters and nonengrafters. FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) and nucleophosmin mutations occurred at a similar frequency in engrafters and nonengrafters. The only variable that was related to engraftment ability was the karyotypically defined risk stratification of individual AML cases. Of interest, follow-up of younger patients with intermediate-risk AML revealed a significant difference in overall survival between NOD/SCID engrafting and nonengrafting AMLs. Hence, the ability of AML to engraft in the NOD/SCID assay seems to be an inherent property of AML cells, independent of homing, conditioning, or cell frequency/source, which is directly related to prognosis.

CCND1 and c-Mos were the most significantly inhibited targets on both transcriptional and translational levels. Treatment with short hairpin RNAs targeting either CCND1 or c-Mos further sensitized MV4-11 cells to ABT-869.

In addition to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, therapeutic strategies that modulate the expression of FLT3-ITD are also promising. We show that AML samples bearing FLT3-ITD mutations are more sensitive to proteasome inhibitors than wild-type samples and this sensitivity is strongly correlated with a higher FLT3-ITD allelic burden. Using pharmacologic inhibitors of autophagy, specific downregulation of key autophagy proteins including Vps34, autophagy gene (Atg)5, Atg12, Atg13, biochemical, and microscopy studies, we demonstrated that proteasome inhibitors induced cytotoxic autophagy in AML cells. FLT3-ITD molecules were detectable within autophagosomes after bortezomib treatment indicating that autophagy induction was responsible for the early degradation of FLT3-ITD, which preceded the inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), PI3K/AKT, and STAT5 pathways, and subsequent activation of cell death. Moreover, proteasome inhibitors overcome resistance to quizartinib induced by mutations in the kinase domain of FLT3, suggesting that these compounds may prevent the emergence of mutant clones arising from tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatments. In xenograft mice models, bortezomib stimulated the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, indicating induction of autophagy in vivo, downregulated FLT3-ITD protein expression and improved overall survival. Therefore, selecting patients according to FLT3-ITD mutations could be a new way to detect a significant clinical activity of proteasome inhibitors in AML patients. ",

The models and patient cells were subjected to genomic and transcriptomic profiling and high-throughput testing with 250 emerging and clinical oncology compounds. Genomic profiling uncovered deletion of the deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) gene in both MOLM-13- and SHI-1-derived cytarabine-resistant variants and in an AML patient sample. Cytarabine-resistant SHI-1 variants and a subset of chemorefractory AML patient samples showed increased sensitivity to glucocorticoids that are often used in treatment of lymphoid leukemia but not AML. Paired samples taken from AML patients before treatment and at relapse also showed acquisition of glucocorticoid sensitivity. Enhanced glucocorticoid sensitivity was only seen in AML patient samples that were negative for the FLT3 mutation (P=0.0006).

In order to elucidate the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the Ara-C resistance induced by FLT3-ITD, we performed a microarray gene expression analysis of the human leukemic cell line K562 transduced with FLT3-ITD (K562/FLT3-ITD) and identified RUNX3 as a downstream target of FLT3-ITD. The transcriptional induction of the RUNX3 expression by FLT3-ITD was noted on a Luciferase assay. The knockdown of the RUNX3 expression in the K562/FLT3-ITD cells increased the sensitivity to Ara-C, and the exogenous expression of RUNX3 per se resulted in the enhancement of Ara-C resistance in the K562 cells. A relationship between the FLT3-ITD-induced RUNX3 expression and Ara-C resistance was also observed in AML cells with an endogenous FLT3-ITD expression. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that RUNX3 is a prerequisite for Ara-C resistance via FLT3-ITD signaling. ",

Secondary mutations in target kinases can cause clinical resistance to therapeutic kinase inhibition. We have previously shown that sensitivity toward tyrosine kinase inhibitors varies between different activating FLT3 mutations. We therefore intended to determine whether different FLT3 inhibitors would produce distinct profiles of secondary, FLT3 resistance mutations. Using a cell-based screening approach, we generated FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD)-expressing cell lines resistant to the FLT3 inhibitors SU5614, PKC412, and sorafenib. Interestingly, the profile of resistance mutations emerging with SU5614 was limited to exchanges in the second part of the kinase domain (TK2) with exchanges of D835 predominating. In contrast, PKC412 exclusively produced mutations within tyrosine kinase domain 1 (TK1) at position N676. A mutation at N676 recently has been reported in a case of PKC412-resistant AML. TK1 mutations exhibited a differential response to SU5614, sorafenib, and sunitinib but strongly impaired response to PKC412. TK2 exchanges identified with SU5614 were sensitive to PKC412, sunitinib, or sorafenib, with the exception of Y842D, which caused a strong resistance to sorafenib. Of note, sorafenib also produced a highly distinct profile of resistance mutations with no overlap to SU5614 or PKC412, including F691L in TK1 and exchanges at position Y842 of TK2. Thus, different FLT3 kinase inhibitors generate distinct, nonoverlapping resistance profiles. This is in contrast to Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors such as imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib, which display overlapping resistance profiles. Therefore, combinations of FLT3 inhibitors may be useful to prevent FLT3 resistance mutations in the setting of FLT3-ITD-positive AML.",

These aim to suppress the production or activity of proteins, such as FLT3 and BCL2, among others, and thus disrupt related signaling cascades essential for leukemogenesis and proliferation. In addition, other agents like flavopiridol appear to target the myeloid blast by various mechanisms including suppression of cyclin-dependent kinases and interference with nucleotide synthesis. Another class of novel therapies includes inhibitors of histone deacetylase, which cause growth arrest and apoptosis through histone acetylation and resultant conformational changes.

We conducted a retrospective, multi-institutional study of patients with AEL and compared them with patients with MDS or AML-MRC with erythroid hyperplasia (> or = 50% erythroid cells). Among a total of 124 patients with AEL, 32% had a history of MDS or chronic cytopenia, 32% had therapy-related disease, and 35% had de novo disease. Sixty-four percent of patients had unfavorable AML risk-group karyotypes. FLT3 and RAS mutations were infrequent, occurring in 6% and 2%, respectively. The median overall survival (OS) of all AEL patients was 8 months, comparable with that of patients with MDS or AML-MRC with erythroid hyperplasia. The OS was related to cytogenetic risk group, but not blast count or morphologic dysplasia. Our findings suggest that AEL is in the continuum of MDS and AML with erythroid hyperplasia, where karyotype rather than an arbitrary blast cutoff represents the most important prognostic factor.",

Traditionally, AML classification and risk stratification relied on cytogenetic studies; however, molecular detection of gene mutations is playing an increasingly important role in classification, risk stratification, and management of AML. Molecular testing does not take the place of cytogenetic testing results, but plays a complementary role to help refine prognosis, especially within specific AML subgroups. With the exception of acute promyelocytic leukemia, AML therapy is not targeted but the intensity of therapy is driven by the prognostic subgroup. Many prognostic scoring systems classify patients into favorable, poor, or intermediate prognostic subgroups based on clinical and genetic features. Current standard of care combines cytogenetic results with targeted testing for mutations in FLT3, NPM1, CEBPA, and KIT to determine the prognostic subgroup. Other gene mutations have also been demonstrated to predict prognosis and may play a role in future risk stratification, although some of these have not been confirmed in multiple studies or established as standard of care. This paper will review the contribution of cytogenetic results to prognosis in AML and then will focus on molecular mutations that have a prognostic or possible therapeutic impact. ",

FLT3-ITD-expressing murine and human myeloid cell lines, HF6/FLT3-ITD and K562/FLT3-ITD cells, respectively, were developed in order to clarify whether FLT3-ITD is involved in the resistance to cytotoxic agents in AML. Both of these cell lines were specifically resistant to the pyrimidine analogue cytosine arabinoside (ara-C), an essential agent for AML, accompanied by the downregulation of equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1), a transporter responsible for the cellular uptake of ara-C. The ENT1 promoter activity and the cellular uptake of ara-C were reduced in K562/FLT3-ITD cells, and rescued by pretreating the cells with PKC412, a FLT3 inhibitor. In addition, the expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha subunit (HIF1A) transcripts was upregulated in K562/FLT3-ITD cells, and the induction of HIF-1alpha reduced the promoter activity of ENT1 gene in K562 cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that FLT3-ITD specifically induces ara-C resistance in leukemic cells by the repression of ENT1 expression, possibly through the upregulation of HIF-1alpha, while also partially accounting for the poor prognosis of AML with FLT3-ITD due to resistance to the standard chemotherapy protocols which include ara-C.",

Of the 200 patients transplanted, 79 patients (40%) had normal cytogenetics; of these, 17 (22%) had the FLT3-ITD mutation, 35 were WT (44%), and 27 (34%) did not have FLT3 testing performed.

Rearrangements of the genes encoding two nucleoporins, NUP98 and NUP214, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several types of hematologic malignancies, particularly acute myeloid leukemia. NUP98 rearrangements result in fusion of an N-terminal portion of NUP98 to one of numerous proteins. These rearrangements often follow treatment with topoisomerase II inhibitors and tend to occur in younger patients. They have been shown to induce leukemia in mice and to enhance proliferation and disrupt differentiation in primary human hematopoietic precursors. NUP214 has only a few fusion partners. DEK-NUP214 is the most common NUP214 fusion in AML; it tends to occur in younger patients and is usually associated with FLT3 internal tandem duplications. The leukemogenic activity of NUP214 fusions is less well characterized.

Despite remarkable improvement in the treatment outcomes of these diseases over the past several decades, the prognosis for certain high-risk groups of leukemia and for relapsed disease remains poor. However, recent insights into different types of 'driver' lesions of leukemogenesis, such as the aberrant activation of signaling pathways and various epigenetic modifications, have led to the discovery of novel agents that specifically target the mechanism of transformation. In parallel, emerging approaches in cancer immunotherapy have led to newer therapies that can exploit and harness cytotoxic immunity directed against malignant cells. This review details the rationale and implementation of recent and specifically targeted therapies in acute pediatric leukemia. Topics covered include the inhibition of critical cell signaling pathways [BCR-ABL, FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and Janus-associated kinase (JAK)], proteasome inhibition, inhibition of epigenetic regulators of gene expression [DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, and disruptor of telomeric signaling-1 (DOT1L) inhibitors], monoclonal antibodies and immunoconjugated toxins, bispecific T-cell engaging (BiTE) antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor-modified (CAR) T cells.

To determine relevance of established AML type I/II mutations that may serve as therapeutic targets, we assessed frequencies of these mutations and their persistence during disease progression in a large group (n = 69) of paired diagnosis and relapse pediatric AML specimens. In 26 of 42 patients (61%) harboring mutations at either stage of the disease, mutation status changed between diagnosis and relapse, particularly in FLT3, WT1, and RAS genes. Presence or gain of type I/II mutations at relapse was associated with a shorter time to relapse (TTR), whereas absence or loss correlated with longer TTR. Moreover, an adverse outcome was found for patients with activating mutations at relapse, which was statistically significant for FLT3/ITD and WT1 mutations. These findings suggest that mutational shifts affect disease progression. We hence propose that risk stratification, malignant cell detection, and selection of personalized treatment should be based on status of type I/II mutations both at initial diagnosis and during follow-up.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of suppression of FLT3 induced by small hairpin interfering RNA (shRNA) on myeloproliferation and apoptosis in an acute monocytic leukemia (AMOL) cell line THP-1.;FLT3-targeted small hairpin interfering RNA (FLT3-shRNA) was designed and synthesized by transcription system in vitro was transfected into THP-1 cells. Firstly FLT3 mRNA level was detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and FLT3 protein level was detected by flow cytometry (FCM) to verify the efficacy on FLT3-shRNA interference at 48 h after transfection. Cell growth viability was measured at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h after treatment with CCK-8. The distribution of cell cycle was assayed by FCM, and apoptosis was analyzed by DNA Ladder and Annexin V-FITC Staining at 48 h.;FLT3 targeted shRNAs was synthesized successfully and the concentration of 15 nmol/L for 48 h could obtain desirable downregulation of FLT3 expression, the inhibitory percentages of FLT3 mRNA and protein were (72.95 +/- 2.07)% and (65.39 +/- 5.57)%, respectively. The suppression of FLT3 induced by FLT3-shRNA resulted in marked inhibition of cell growth and the inhibitory percentages were (36.66 +/- 3.67)% at 48 h, (35.56 +/- 0.73)% at 72 h. FLT3-shRNA induced the inhibition of cell cycle from G(0)/G(1) phase to S phase, the percentage of sub-G(0)/G(1) phase (65.71 +/- 4.47)% was higher than those in the PBS-control group (52.23 +/- 2.98)%, NC-shRNA control group (51.81 +/- 1.44)%, P < 0.01; the percentage of S phase (25.11 +/- 2.70)% was lower than those in the PBS-control group (34.41 +/- 4.07)% and NC-shRNA control group (32.50 +/- 1.46)%, P < 0.05. Furthermore treatment with FLT3-shRNA for 48 h resulted in clear apoptosis ladder, the percentage of early apoptosis detected by Annexin V-FITC was (18.59 +/- 2.07)% which was significantly higher than that in the PBS-control group (4.00 +/- 0.50)% and the NC-shRNA control group (6.06 +/- 0.70)%, P < 0.001.;The suppression of FLT3 induced by the shRNA can effectively inhibit cell proliferation, and apoptosis induction on THP-1 cells, which indicates that this approach may bear the therapeutic potential on childhood AMOL.",

Iodinin showed selective toxicity to AML and acute promyelocytic (APL) leukemia cells, with EC50 values for cell death up to  40 times lower for leukemia cells when compared with normal cells. Iodinin also successfully induced cell death in patient-derived leukemia cells or cell lines with  features associated with poor prognostic such as FLT3 internal tandem duplications or mutated/deficient p53. The cell death had typical apoptotic morphology, and activation of apoptotic signaling proteins like caspase-3. Molecular modeling suggested that iodinin could intercalate between bases in the DNA in a way similar to the anti-cancer drug daunorubicin (DNR), causing DNA-strand breaks. Iodinin induced apoptosis in several therapy-resistant AML-patient blasts, but to a low degree in peripheral blood leukocytes, and in contrast to DNR, not in rat cardiomyoblasts.

Of these, FLT3-ITD has the most important prognostic implication. Insights into the molecular pathogenesis of AML have led to the development of more specific targeted agents. Currently, a number of agents have been explored in AML, including immunoconjugate of anti-CD33 antibody and cytotoxic agent (gemtuzumab ozogamicin: GO), tyrosine kinase inhibitors and farnesyl transferase inhibitor. These agents have shown promise in small studies. Large phase III studies will reveal whether these are effective in inducing complete remission and prolonging survival. Combining targeted agents with each other or with chemotherapy may improve the response rates. GO is the most promising drug, which has been evaluated in randomized trials by several major cooperative groups to determine whether the addition of GO improves the complete remission rate and overall survival.

However, some patients rapidly succumb to disease despite chemotherapy. We studied 56 patients with acute myeloid leukemia associated with t(8;21) and correlated clinicopathologic, cytogenetic and molecular findings with outcome to identify markers of prognosis. In a subset of patients, we also assessed the status of the c-KIT, FLT3 and RAS genes. There were 31 men and 25 women, with a median age of 38 years (range 4-76). The follow-up period ranged from 17 to 104 months (median 52). At the last follow-up, 29 patients had died, 25 patients were in complete remission and two patients were alive with disease. The median survial was 38 months. The 5-year overall survival rate of newly diagnosed patients was 56%. Most patients (39/56, 70%) had chromosomal aberrations in addition to t(8;21), with loss of a sex chromosome (39%) being most common followed by del(9q)(q21-22) (11%) and trisomy 8 (7%). These aberrations, however, did not predict survival. C-KIT (D816V or D816Y), FLT3 (ITD or D835) and RAS mutations were detected in 26, 10 and 7%, respectively, of cases assessed. The 5-year overall survival rate of patients with mutated leukemia was 20%. No mutations were observed in three patients who died within 7 months of diagnosis. Leukocytosis or CD56 expression did not correlate with a poor survival nor did the levels of CD19 expression predict c-KIT mutation status. We conclude that acute myeloid leukemia associated with t(8;21) is a heterogeneous disease with poor survival in a subset of patients unrelated to common secondary cytogenetic aberrations.",

Conventional prognostication relies on clinicopathological parameters supplemented by cytogenetic information. However, recent studies have shown that genetic aberrations also have critical impacts on treatment outcome. Moreover, these genetic alterations may themselves be a target for treatment. The mutation landscape in MDS is shaped by gene aberrations involved in DNA methylation (TET2, DNMT3A, IDH1/2), histone modification (ASXL1, EZH2), the RNA splicing machinery (SF3B1, SRSF2, ZRSR2, U2AF1/2), transcription (RUNX1, TP53, BCOR, PHF6, NCOR, CEBPA, GATA2), tyrosine kinase receptor signaling (JAK2, MPL, FLT3, GNAS, KIT), RAS pathways (KRAS, NRAS, CBL, NF1, PTPN11), DNA repair (ATM, BRCC3, DLRE1C, FANCL), and cohesion complexes (STAG2, CTCF, SMC1A, RAD21).

It would therefore be useful to identify therapeutic agents that target leukaemic stem cells. We devised a flow cytometric chemosensitivity assay allowing 48 h culture of leukaemic blasts in a defined microenvironment followed by enumeration of viable CD34+CD38-CD123+ leukaemic stem and progenitor cells (LSPC). The assay was used to investigate the LSPC response to cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) and to the FLT3 inhibitor AG1296. There was a 3.6-fold increase in Ara-C-treated LSPC survival under defined 'niche-like' conditions compared to culture without microenvironmental support. Nine AML samples with internal tandem duplications of FLT3 (FLT3/ITDs) were treated with AG1296. Three samples were very sensitive (>50% kill) and 4 were moderately sensitive (10-50% kill) in bulk suspension culture without microenvironmental support. However, under defined 'niche-like' conditions, the survival of LSPC was enhanced rather than inhibited by AG1296 treatment. We conclude that an interaction between LSPC and a defined in vitro microenvironment models a chemoresistant niche.

The prognosis of AML in older adults is generally poor; however, AML is a heterogeneous disease regardless of age, and prognosis depends on cytogenetic changes, genetic mutations, and patient characteristics. Several lines of evidence support offering treatment to the vast majority of older patients, and the survival benefit associated with this approach generally outweighs the risk of toxicity. Response and long-term survival using intensive induction regimens are significantly lower in older patients, although a small proportion of patients can achieve durable remissions. Selection of patients for intensive induction therapy requires comprehensive assessment of disease characteristics, performance status, and comorbidities. In unfit patients, options for treatment include hypomethylating agents, low-dose ara-C, or consideration of a clinical trial if available. The incorporation of novel therapies into treatment, such as FLT3 inhibitors and antibody-drug conjugates, offers significant promise in older patients, although, thus far, increased responses using novel agents have often not translated to improved survival outcomes. The development of reduced-intensity conditioning regimens and improvements in supportive care has increased the use of allogeneic stem cell transplant (ASCT) in older patients. Selection of patients for ASCT requires an estimation of the trade-off between toxicity and risk of relapse. ",

To clarify the biologic implication of activation loop mutations of the KIT gene, 1940 randomly selected AML patients were analyzed. In total, 33 (1.7%) of 1940 patients were positive for D816 mutations. Of these 33 patients, 8 (24.2%) had a t(8;21), which was significantly higher compared with the subgroup without D816 mutations. Analyses of genetic subgroups showed that KIT-D816 mutations were associated with t(8;21)/AML1-ETO and other rare AML1 translocations. In contrast, other activating mutations like FLT3 and NRAS mutations were very rarely detected in AML1-rearranged leukemia. KIT mutations had an independent negative impact on overall (median 304 vs 1836 days; P = .006) and event-free survival (median 244 vs 744 days; P = .003) in patients with t(8;21) but not in patients with a normal karyotype. The KIT-D816V receptor expressed in Ba/F3 cells was resistant to growth inhibition by the selective PTK inhibitors imatinib and SU5614 but fully sensitive to PKC412. Our findings clearly indicate that activating mutations of receptor tyrosine kinases are associated with distinct genetic subtypes in AML. The KIT-D816 mutations confer a poor prognosis to AML1-ETO-positive AML and should therefore be included in the diagnostic workup.

The patients were dichotomized at BAALC and ERG mean expression into low and high expression based on the median expression as cutoff.

Acute leukemia has poor prognosis, mainly due to relapse. Standard FLT3-ITD diagnostic techniques are based on genomic polymerase chain reaction and have recently incorporated GeneScan (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) to identify variations of the FLT3 gene. As this is an average-based assay utilized in a heterogeneous leukemic cell population, we hypothesized that cells of acute leukemia, considered FLT3-ITD-negative by standard methods, could possess a fraction of FLT3-ITD-positive cells. The present study employed single cell mutation analysis to evaluate the FLT3-ITD status in newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (n = 5) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (n = 3) patients. A total of 541 single leukemic cells and 36 mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers were analyzed. Seven patients, considered FLT3-ITD-negative according to bulk DNA analysis, appeared to possess a small fraction of FLT3-ITD-positive cells based on single cell analysis. Moreover, this approach revealed the heterogeneity of the tumor as evident by different FLT3-ITD mutations present in the same patient. The presence of a minor clone carrying FLT3-ITD in almost all patients tested provides evidence that this lesion is a common late event in leukemogenesis. Additionally, 3 relapsed patients demonstrated loss of heterozygosity of the normal allele, affecting 25%-100% of the cells found to be FLT3-ITD-positive. Though further clinical testing is warranted, these findings may have implications on the prognostic significance of FLT3-ITD and the use of targeted therapy.",

In older patients, diseases requiring cytotoxic treatment are more difficult and less successful to manage because comorbid conditions and poor performance status are more prevalent, decreasing the tolerance to therapy and increasing the frequency of side effects. This age effect is highlighted by the dramatically less favorable outcome in older than younger patients with acute myeloid leukemia with similar \"favorable\" cytogenetic changes. In addition, in acute and subacute myeloid leukemia in older patients, the disease is intrinsically more resistant to therapy. Overexpression of drug resistance genes and unfavorable genetic mutations are more prevalent in older patients and provide evidence that acute myeloid leukemia is often qualitatively different in these patients. The gradient of age effects is continuous; the frequency of poor outcome increasing by decade (or less). The decline in survival becomes especially steep as quinquagenarians (50-year-olds) age to nonagenarians (90-year-olds). Although improved drug schedules have led to significant improvements in event-free survival in younger patients, these improvements have been far less evident in older patients.

        "Doc_abstract":"Length mutations within the FLT3 gene (FLT3-LM) can be found in 23% of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and thus are the most frequent mutations in AML. FLT3-LM are highly correlated with AML with normal karyotype and other cytogenetic aberrations of the prognostically intermediate group. This group is supposed to be a mixed group of AML with differences in the underlying pathogenesis. For more individualized treatment options it would be helpful to better characterize this large AML group not only by molecular mutations but also use these markers for the definition of minimal residual disease (MRD). However, so far the cytogenetically intermediate AML has been lacking suitable markers for PCR-based MRD detection like the fusion genes in the prognostically favourable subgroups. The suitability of the FLT3-LM as a target for PCR-based MRD was discussed controversially as it seemed to be a rather unstable marker. Thus, we aimed at the evaluation of FLT3-LM as a marker for residual disease in a large cohort of AML. Paired samples of 97 patients with AML at diagnosis and at relapse were analyzed. It could be shown that in only four cases a loss of the length mutation was detected. This is in the range of other well-characterized AML relapsing with a different geno- and/or phenotype. In contrast, a change in the ratio of the mutated allele in comparison to the wild-type allele was frequently observed. In detail, the FLT3-LM showed a tendency to accumulate during disease progression and was found more frequently at relapse than at diagnosis. In addition, 45 patients were analyzed at different time points during and after therapy. Using conventional PCR it clearly could be shown that for most of the patients positive at presentation FLT3-LM is a reliable PCR marker for monitoring treatment response. Even an early detection of relapse was possible in some cases.",

Flt3-activating mutations have been associated with poor prognosis and decreased overall survival of AML patients, thus Flt3 constitutes an ideal target for drug treatment of such disease. Unfortunately, the monotherapy with small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors in clinical trials shows that remission is not permanent, presumably by resistance of Flt3 mutants to inhibitors. An alternative approach for treatment is based on the cooperation between Flt3 and additional intracellular pathways for AML transformation in some patients. Thus, the inhibition of both Flt3 and such pathways may be exploited for successful treatment of the disease. We investigated the importance of Flt3-activating mutations for the constitutive activation of intracellular pathways in primary AML cells, and their effect on cell survival. We found that the main compounds involved in the differentiation, proliferation and survival of AML (MAPK/AKT/STAT) were constitutively activated. However, only four samples showed internal tandem duplications (ITDs) for Flt3. Surprisingly, contrary to previous reports, we found that inhibition of ITD/Flt3 activity did not prevent the phosphorylation of ERK, STAT5 or Akt in some primary AML cells. In parallel, we found that in these cells, Flt3 and ERK or Akt cooperate to regulate cell survival. Our results support the hypothesis that the optimal therapeutic treatment of AML may require not only the oncogenic tyrosine kinase, but also the appropriate combination of different specific inhibitors, thus providing a more effective approach to reverse leukaemogenesis. Thus, we propose that each AML patient should have an individually tailored combination treatment.",

Aberrant expression of the FLT3 gene has been documented in both adult and childhood leukemias including AML, ALL and CML. In addition, 17-27% of pediatric and adult patients with AML have small internal tandem duplication mutations in FLT3. Patients expressing the mutant form of the receptor have been shown to have a decreased chance for cure. Our previous study, using a constitutively activated FLT3, demonstrated transformation of Ba/F3 cells and leukemic development in an animal model. Thus, there is accumulating evidence for a role for FLT3 in human leukemias. This has prompted us to search for inhibitors of FLT3 as a possible therapeutic approach in these patients. AG1296 is a compound of the tyrphostin class that is known to selectively inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of the PDGF and KIT receptors. Since FLT3 is a close relative of KIT, we wanted to test the possible inhibitory activity of AG1296 on FLT3. In transfected Ba/F3 cells, AG1296 selectively and potently inhibited autophosphorylation of FL-stimulated wild-type and constitutively activated FLT3. Treatment by AG1296 abolished IL-3-independent proliferation of Ba/F3 cells expressing the constitutively activated FLT3 and thus, reversed the transformation mediated by activated FLT3. Inhibition of FLT3 activity by AG1296 in cells transformed by activated FLT3 resulted in apoptotic cell death, with no deleterious effect on their parental counterparts. Addition of IL-3 rescued the growth of cells expressing activated FLT3 in the presence of AG1296. This demonstrates that the inhibition is specific to the FLT3 pathway in that it leaves the kinases of the IL-3 pathway and other kinases further downstream involved in proliferation intact. Several proteins phosphorylated by the activated FLT3 signaling pathway, including STAT 5A, STAT 5B and CBL, were no longer phosphorylated when these cells were treated with AG1296. The activity against FLT3 suggests a potential therapeutic application for AG1296 or similar drugs in the treatment of leukemias involving deregulated FLT3 tyrosine kinase activity and as a tool for studying the biology of FLT3.",

The drug had anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects on primary AML cells and human leukaemic cell lines expressing mutated FLT3. In several AML patient samples, a blast cell population expressing FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) was eradicated by canertinib. Canertinib inhibited receptor autophosphorylation and kinase activity of both mutated and FLT3 ligand stimulated wildtype FLT3, leading to inhibition of the PI3-kinase and MAP kinase pathways. Apoptotic induction was dependent on pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein BCL2L11/BIM because siRNA silencing attenuated apoptosis. Moreover, the drug induced regression of cells expressing FLT3-ITD in a murine in vivo-transplantation model at previously described tolerated doses.

Molecular analysis showed evidence of an NPM1 mutation (subtype A) and internal tandem duplications of the FLT3 gene (FLT3-ITD). Eight months after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, the patient developed a palpable mass in the left breast initially suspected as breast carcinoma. Core needle biopsy of the lesion resulted in diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma. Molecular analysis of formalin-fixed specimens of the breast tumour confirmed the known FLT3 and NPM1 gene mutations. Immunohistochemically, an aberrant cytoplasmic staining pattern for NPM1 and overexpression of FLT3 were demonstrated. The myeloid sarcoma showed complete transient resolution following treatment with the kinase inhibitor sorafenib. However, the patient developed bone marrow relapse and died in fatal cerebral haemorrhage 1 year after initial diagnosis of AML. In summary, combined molecular and immunohistochemical examination of NPM1 and FLT3 is helpful in the diagnosis of extramedullary manifestations of AML in core needle biopsies.",

Inhibitors of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), JAK2 and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have been tested in clinical studies, but showed only moderate single-agent activity. High efficacy of the HDACi pracinostat treating AML and synergy with the JAK2/FLT3 inhibitor pacritinib is demonstrated. Both compounds inhibit JAK-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling in AML cells with JAK2(V617F) mutations, but also diminish FLT3 signaling, particularly in FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplication) cell lines. In vitro, this combination led to decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. The synergy translated in vivo in two different AML models, the SET-2 megakaryoblastic AML mouse model carrying a JAK2(V617F) mutation, and the MOLM-13 model of FLT3-ITD-driven AML. Pracinostat and pacritinib in combination showed synergy on tumor growth, reduction of metastases and synergistically decreased JAK2 or FLT signaling, depending on the cellular context. In addition, several plasma cytokines/growth factors/chemokines triggered by the tumor growth were normalized, providing a rationale for combination therapy with an HDACi and a JAK2/FLT3 inhibitor for the treatment of AML patients, particularly those with FLT3 or JAK2 mutations.",

All cytokine receptors examined were expressed at varying levels, whereas the levels of IL-3Rα, GM-CSFRα, IL-2Rα, γc, c-kit, and G-CSFR exhibited a wide spectrum of ≥10,000 sites/cell. In terms of their French-American-British classification types, GM-CSFRα and c-fms were preferentially expressed in M4/M5 patients, G-CSF in M3 patients, and IL-2Rα in non-M3 patients. Elevated levels of IL-3Rα, GM-CSFRα, and IL-2Rα correlated with leukocytosis. In patients ≤60 years old, higher levels of these 3 receptors correlated with poor responses to conventional chemotherapy, but only IL-2Rα was associated with a shorter overall survival. By incorporating IL-2Rα status into cytogenetic risk stratification, we could sort out a significantly adverse-risk cohort from the cytogenetically intermediate-risk group. Analyses with various phenotypical risk markers revealed the expression of IL-2Rα as an independent prognostic indicator in patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics. These findings were not observed in patients >60 years old. Our results indicate that several cytokine receptors were associated with certain cellular and clinical features, but IL-2Rα alone had prognostic value that provides an additional marker to improve current risk evaluation in AML patients ≤60 years old.

The development of FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) is a promising strategy, but resistance that arises during the course of treatment caused by secondary mutations within the mutated gene itself poses a significant challenge. In an effort to predict FLT3 resistance mutations that might develop in patients, we used saturation mutagenesis of FLT3/ITD followed by selection of transfected cells in FLT3 TKI. We identified F621L, A627P, F691L and Y842C mutations in FLT3/ITD that confer varying levels of resistance to FLT3 TKI. Western blotting confirmed that some FLT3 TKI were ineffective at inhibiting FLT3 autophosphorylation and signaling through MAP kinase, STAT5 and AKT in some mutants. Balb/c mice transplanted with the FLT3/ITD Y842C mutation confirmed resistance to sorafenib in vivo but not to lestaurtinib. These results indicate a growing number of FLT3 mutations that are likely to be encountered in patients.

Bone marrow neoangiogenesis is mediated by several growth factors, such as VEGF-A, VEGF-C, angiopoietin-1 and -2, FGF, HGF, TGF-β and others secreted by leukemic cells. The prognostic relevance of microvessel density, and expression of VEGF-A and -C has been demonstrated especially in acute myeloid leukemia. In the last years, several classes of angiogenesis inhibitors have been developed blocking several angiogenic pathways. These include drugs that inhibit the VEGF (with or without blockade of FLT3) and the mTor signalling cascade. Besides, thalidomide and lenalidomide although possessing a pleiotrophic mode of action including antiangiogenic properities have been evaluated in the treatment of human leukemias. In the current review we analyze the results of clinical trials employing these antiangiogenic drugs. Since the clinical efficacy of these compounds used as monotherapy is often limited, confined to certain subgroups of patients and frequently short lived, several trials combining standard chemotherapy with these agents have been initiated in order to demonstrate an additional benefit to standard therapy. Furthermore the introduction of new antiangiogenic drugs such as inhibitors of the angiopoietin and HGF/cMET pathway is on the horizon. Utilizing cocktails of inhibitors of several angiogenic pathways may represent a new possibility to augment the efficacy of antiangiogenic therapy in the future.",

The physiologic functions of the TAM receptors in innate immune control, natural killer (NK) cell differentiation, efferocytosis, clearance of apoptotic debris, and hemostasis have previously been described and more recent data implicate TAM kinases as important regulators of erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. The TAM receptors are aberrantly or ectopically expressed in many hematologic malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia, B- and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and multiple myeloma. TAM receptors contribute to leukemic phenotypes through activation of pro-survival signaling pathways and interplay with other oncogenic proteins such as FLT3, LYN, and FGFR3. The TAM receptors also contribute to resistance to both cytotoxic chemotherapeutics and targeted agents, making them attractive therapeutic targets. A number of translational strategies for TAM inhibition are in development, including small molecule inhibitors, ligand traps, and monoclonal antibodies. Emerging areas of research include modulation of TAM receptors to enhance anti-tumor immunity, potential roles for TYRO-3 in leukemogenesis, and the function of the bone marrow microenvironment in mediating resistance to TAM inhibition.",

Perifosine is a synthetic alkylphospholipid, a new class of antitumor agents, which target plasma membrane and inhibit signal transduction networks. Perifosine was tested on THP-1 and MV 4-11 cell lines, as well as primary leukemia cells. Perifosine treatment induced cell death by apoptosis in AML cell lines. Perifosine caused Akt and ERK 1/2 dephosphorylation as well as caspase activation. In THP-1 cells, the proapoptotic effect of perifosine was partly dependent on the Fas/FasL system and c-jun-N-kinase activation. In MV 4-11 cells, perifosine downregulated phosphorylated Akt, but not phosphorylated FLT3. Moreover, perifosine reduced the clonogenic activity of AML, but not normal, CD34(+) cells, and markedly increased blast cell sensitivity to etoposide.

FLT3 is expressed at high levels in 70-100% of cases of AML and in virtually all cases of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia. FLT3 is regarded as a molecular target in the development of novel therapies for acute leukemia patients. Currently, many small-molecule FLT3 inhibitors have been developed, but clinical trials have resulted in limited antileukemia effects because of off-target toxicities and drug resistance. The development of anti-FLT3 Abs might overcome these difficulties and enhance the antileukemia efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors. In the present study, we demonstrate the isolation of novel human mAbs against FLT3 with antagonistic or agonistic activities. An antagonistic Ab, designated A2, continuously inhibits FLT3 ligand (FL)-induced phosphorylation of FLT3 and MAPK. A2 cooperatively induces apoptosis with daunorubicin, even in the presence of FL. An agonistic Ab, designated 3E6, surprisingly induces the phosphorylation of FLT3 and MAPK, and supports the growth of a factor-dependent cell line independently of FL addition. In addition, A2 showed complement-dependent cytotoxicity activity, but was devoid of Ab-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. Finally, we evaluated Ab internalization in a cell line. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry analyses revealed that A2 is efficiently internalized. Collectively, these data demonstrate that A2 is a potent human Ab that might be capable of delivering cytotoxic reagents and that has antagonistic effects on FLT3 signaling. In addition, 3E6 might be a potential scaffold for novel dendritic cell-based immunotherapies.",

However, knowledge of the co-occurrence of such lesions and the relative influence of different types of genomic alterations on clinical outcomes in AML is still evolving.;We performed SNP 6.0 array-based genomic profiling of aCNA/copy neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (cnLOH) along with sequence analysis of 13 commonly mutated genes on purified leukemic blast DNA from 156 prospectively enrolled non-FAB-M3 AML patients across the clinical spectrum of de novo, secondary, and therapy-related AML.;TP53 and RUNX1 mutations are strongly associated with the presence of SNP-A-based aCNA/cnLOH, while FLT3 and NPM1 mutations are strongly associated with the absence of aCNA/cnLOH. The presence of mutations in RUNX1, ASXL1, and TP53, elevated SNP-A-based genomic complexity, and specific recurrent aCNAs predicted failure to achieve a complete response to induction chemotherapy. The presence of ≥1 aCNA/cnLOH and higher thresholds predicted for poor long-term survival irrespective of TP53 status, and the presence of ≥1 aCNA/cnLOH added negative prognostic information to knowledge of mutations in TET2, IDH1, NPM1, DNMT3A, and RUNX1. Results of multivariate analyses support a dominant role for TP53 mutations and a role for elevated genomic complexity as predictors of short survival in AML.;Integrated genomic profiling of a clinically relevant adult AML cohort identified genomic aberrations most associated with SNP-A-based genomic complexity, resistance to intensive induction therapies, and shortened overall survival. Identifying SNP-A-based lesions adds prognostic value to the status of several recurrently mutated genes.",

SEPT9 is a very rare but recurrent fusion partner of MLL, and has recently been implicated in the oncogenesis of various malignancies. Herein, we report a case of de novo acute monocytic leukemia (M5b) with t(11;17)(q23;q25). MLL involvement was revealed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, and an MLL/SEP9 fusion transcript was detected by RT-PCR. Sequencing analysis further showed that, in contrast to originally reported cases, MLL exon 8 was fused not with SEPT9 exon 3 but with exon 2, which codes for the unique N-terminal region of the SEPT9_v1 isoform, the region implicated in the regulation of gene expression and cell proliferation. We did not detect any mutation of FLT3, which was expressed at a relatively low level in the leukemic cells. Relapsing after a very short complete remission, the leukemia progressed rapidly and became fatal in spite of intensive therapies including hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. It is thus suggested that, in common with the original MLL/SEPT9 cases, monocytic differentiation and a poor prognosis may also be associated with acute myeloid leukemia with the variant MLL/SEPT9 fusion transcript.",

Nevertheless, the role and safety of this antibody target-therapy in first-line chemotherapy in patients younger than 65 years has not yet been defined.;The primary goal of this prospective phase II pilot study was to evaluate the efficacy and the safety profile of FLAI plus GO as induction regimen. Thirty consecutive AML patients were included. All patients were younger than 65 with a median age of 53 years and CD33 expression exceeded 20% in all cases. The M/F ratio was 16/14 and 21/30 (70%) of patients were poor-risk at diagnosis. The induction regimen (FLAI-GO) included fludarabine (30mg/m(2)) and Ara-C (2g/m(2)) on days 1-5, idarubicin (10mg/m(2)) on days 1, 3, and 5 and GO (3mg/m(2)) on day 6. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) was planned for all high risk AML patients in first complete remission (CR) after consolidation with intermediate doses of Ara-C and idarubicin (IDAC-IDA). Cytogenetic, multidrug-resistance phenotype, FLT3 mutation status, and WT1 quantitative expression analyses were performed at diagnosis in all patients. WT1 expression and cytogenetic (in positive cases) analyses were performed after induction to detect and follow minimal residual disease.;Patients were evaluated for response rate, treatment-related adverse events, overall survival and relapse free survival. After induction with FLAI-GO, CR rate was 90% (26 of 29 evaluable pts); one patient achieved partial remission and two were resistant. There was only one case of death during induction (DDI). After FLAI-GO, the mean value of WT1 dropped from 4200+/-2777 copies/10(4)ABL to 192+/-399 copies/10(4)ABL. The toxicity of FLAI-GO was acceptable; 57% of patients experienced transient and reversible GO infusion-related adverse events (especially fever and chills), but no cases of veno-occlusive disease occurred during CHT or after HSCT. After a median follow-up of 16 months (range 2-25), 24/30 (80%) patients are alive (24/24 in CR). The probability of 1-year OS and RFS was 90 and 85%, respectively. Allogeneic and autologus HSCT was performed in 19 (63%) and 4 (13%) patients, respectively.;These preliminary results suggest that FLAI-GO is an effective and well tolerated induction regimen for CD33 positive AML patients younger than 65 years, with a high complete response rate, favourable safety profile, low DDI. These results encourage the testing of this regimen in a multicenter prospective trial.",

In this study, we detected typical NPM1 mutations (types A, B, D) in untreated Chinese AML patients using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) followed by sequence analysis. The detection rate of NPM1 mutations in 220 AML patients was 16.4%, including 107 (14.2%) with the French-American-British (FAB) subtype M2, 43 (2.3%) with M3, and 52 (30.8%) with M4/M5. Only one case each with an NPM1 mutation was detected in four M0, seven M1, five M6, and two M7 cases. Eight patients were followed up after treatment, and five patients in hematologic remission continued to test negative for NPM1 mutations within 2-14 months of follow-up. Sequence analysis revealed that all the 36 positive cases were heterozygous for the mutation with 4-bp insertions at nt 959; the 36 cases included 29 (80.6%) cases with type A, four (11.1%) cases with type B, and one rare DD-3 mutation. We also detected two new mutations, namely, CTCG and CAAG insertions, named BJ-01 and BJ-02, respectively. Further, 38.9% (14/36) patients with NPM1 mutations simultaneously exhibited internal tandem duplications in the FLT3 gene, and 66.7% (22/33) patients did not express CD34. The results demonstrated that RQ-PCR was a reliable and sensitive method for detecting NPM1 mutations, for screening AML, and for the quantitative analysis of minimal residual diseases.",

The three major candidates accounting for the development of MDR in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) are multi drug resistance gene (MDR1), multi drug resistance-related protein gene (MRP1) and lung resistance protein gene (LRP). So far, the differential impact of resistance gene expression on treatment outcome in AML is not clear. Therefore, we examined MDR1, MRP1 and LRP gene expression at diagnosis in 331 adult AML patients in the context of other known prognostic factors, such as age, disease status, cytogenetics and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-internal tandem duplication mutational status. Median observation time was longer than 5 years [64.1 months (40.0-87.6)]. MDR1 expression proved to be an independent prognostic factor for outcome of induction therapy (P <0.001) and overall survival (P=0.02), whereas MRP1 expression was an independent predictor for disease-free survival (P=0.01) in the multivariate analysis. This prognostic impact of both resistance genes was also found in patients with intermediate risk cytogenetics. LRP expression, however, had no impact on treatment outcome in AML. Our study shows that resistance gene expression should be considered together with age, cytogenetics and FLT3 mutational status for risk-adapted treatment strategies in AML in the future.",

However, age-specific molecular alterations are becoming more evident and may signify the need to age-stratify treatment regimens. The NCI/COG TARGET-AML initiative used whole exome capture sequencing (WXS) to interrogate the genomic landscape of matched trios representing specimens collected upon diagnosis, remission, and relapse from 20 cases of de novo childhood AML. One hundred forty-five somatic variants at diagnosis (median 6 mutations/patient) and 149 variants at relapse (median 6.5 mutations) were identified and verified by orthogonal methodologies. Recurrent somatic variants [in (greater than or equal to) 2 patients] were identified for 10 genes (FLT3, NRAS, PTPN11, WT1, TET2, DHX15, DHX30, KIT, ETV6, KRAS), with variable persistence at relapse. The variant allele fraction (VAF), used to measure the prevalence of somatic mutations, varied widely at diagnosis. Mutations that persisted from diagnosis to relapse had a significantly higher diagnostic VAF compared with those that resolved at relapse (median VAF 0.43 vs. 0.24, P < 0.001). Further analysis revealed that 90% of the diagnostic variants with VAF >0.4 persisted to relapse compared with 28% with VAF <0.2 (P < 0.001). This study demonstrates significant variability in the mutational profile and clonal evolution of pediatric AML from diagnosis to relapse. Furthermore, mutations with high VAF at diagnosis, representing variants shared across a leukemic clonal structure, may constrain the genomic landscape at relapse and help to define key pathways for therapeutic targeting.

Univariate analysis revealed that the most important determinants of prognosis were presence of balanced translocations, age, white blood cell count and extramedullary disease, in order of statistical significance. In a multivariate analysis, balanced translocations retained their prognostic significance and FLT3 ITD as well as high gene expression of MDR1 were negative prognostic factors.

CD34+ AML cells from patients with FLT3 mutation positive AML were cultured on murine stroma. In expansion cultures, non-cycling cells were found to retain CD34+ expression in contrast to dividing cells. Leukaemic gene rearrangements could be detected in non-cycling cells, indicating their leukaemic origin. Significantly, the FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation was found in the non-cycling fraction of four out of five cases. Exposure to the FLT3-directed inhibitor TKI258 clearly inhibited the growth of AML CD34+ cells in short-term cultures and colony-forming unit assays. Crucially, non-cycling cells were not eradicated, with the exception of one case, which exhibited exquisite sensitivity to the compound. Moreover, in longer-term cultures, TKI258-treated non-cycling cells showed no growth impairment compared to treatment-naive non-cycling cells.

Understanding of the genetic basis of the disease has greatly benefited from the use of DNA sequencing to identify novel disease alleles. Chromosomal aberrations are known to drive AML and are the mainstay of risk classification. Mutations in FLT3, NPM1, and CEBPA provide prognostic information and have been integrated into clinical diagnostics and clinical practice. Comprehensive next-generation sequencing studies have given insight into AML pathogenesis. These insights are leading to refined prognostic stratification and suggest differentially tailored treatment based on integrated genetic profiles.

Identifying novel agents that have the potential to target these LSPC in their niche microenvironment will aid in the characterization of candidate agents for post-remission chemotherapy. Using an in vitro model, we found that 48-h culture with gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg) resulted in a 34% reduction in CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(+) LSPC number, whereas normal CD34(+)CD38(-) haemapoietic stem cells were insensitive to this agent. As there was considerable heterogeneity in LSPC response to Mylotarg treatment, various factors potentially underpinning the differential response were assessed. LSPC that overexpressed CD33 (P=0.01), which were P-glycoprotein-negative (P=0.008) and with internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the FLT3 gene (FLT3/ITD) status (P=0.006) responded better to Mylotarg treatment. LSPC from patient samples that have these combined characteristics as well as low LSPC burden showed significantly more chemosensitivity to Mylotarg compared with all other cases (P=0.002). In multivariate analysis, LSPC burden and FLT3 status were found to be predictors of LSPC chemosensitivity to Mylotarg treatment (P<0.0001). In conclusion, we have shown heterogeneity in the LSPC compartment of AML patients underpinning differential in vitro sensitivity to Mylotarg.",

We demonstrate here how our network-based deconvolution approach, named target addiction score (TAS), provides insights into the functional importance of druggable protein targets in cell-based drug sensitivity testing experiments. Using cancer cell line profiling data sets, we constructed a functional classification across 107 cancer cell models, based on their common and unique target addiction signatures. The pan-cancer addiction correlations could not be explained by the tissue of origin, and only correlated in part with molecular and genomic signatures of the heterogeneous cancer cells. The TAS-based cancer cell classification was also shown to be robust to drug response data resampling, as well as predictive of the transcriptomic patterns in an independent set of cancer cells that shared similar addiction signatures with the 107 cancers. The critical protein targets identified by the integrated approach were also shown to have clinically relevant mutation frequencies in patients with various cancer subtypes, including not only well-established pan-cancer genes, such as PTEN tumor suppressor, but also a number of targets that are less frequently mutated in specific cancer types, including ABL1 oncoprotein in acute myeloid leukemia. An application to leukemia patient primary cell models demonstrated how the target deconvolution approach offers functional insights into patient-specific addiction patterns, such as those indicative of their receptor-type tyrosine-protein kinase FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) status and co-addiction partners, which may lead to clinically actionable, personalized drug treatment developments. To promote its application to the future drug testing studies, we have made available an open-source implementation of the TAS calculation in the form of a stand-alone R package. ",

However, development of resistance to FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), such as PKC412A, has been described recently. This observation may have an increasing impact on the duration of response and relapse rates in upcoming clinical trials employing FLT3-TKI. Herein we investigated two representatives of a novel class of FLT3-TKI: Bis(1H-indol-2-yl)methanones. Both compounds effectively induced apoptosis in FLT3-internal tandem duplicate (ITD)-transfected murine myeloid cells and in primary FLT3-ITD positive blasts. Combination of both compounds with chemotherapy revealed synergistic effects in apoptosis assays. The compounds did not show significant toxicity in human bone marrow cells derived from healthy donors. Compound102 overcame resistance to PKC412 within a non-myelotoxic dose-range. Western Blotting experiments of 32D-FLT3-ITD cells showed dose-dependent dephosphorylation of FLT3-ITD and of its downstream targets STAT5, AKT and ERK upon incubation with either compound. In conclusion, bis(1H-indol-2-yl)methanones overcome resistance mediated by FLT3-ITD mutations at position N676 and show strong efficacy in FLT3-ITD-positive cells alone as well as in combination with chemotherapy. We propose that further development of methanone compounds overcoming resistance to currently established FLT3-TKIs is an important step forward to an anticipated need within our future therapeutic algorithm in FLT3-ITD-positive AML.",

In the last decade, following the introduction of this methodology in leukaemia research, various studies have demonstrated that classification of the majority of known genetic subclasses in AML can be performed with high accuracy by GEP. Further, GEP allowed for detecting new biologically and prognostically relevant subclasses within the defined subgroups, mainly in the normal karyotype AML. These new classifiers cross the borders of traditionally defined prognostic parameters, and some of these gene expression signatures were independently validated by different study groups. The development of treatment-specific sensitivity assays being able to predict the individual patient's response to targeted therapy is another interesting perspective. With respect to molecular mutations in genes such as FLT3 or NPM1, future studies must outline the definite position of GEP.

Using peptide-based CXCR4 inhibitors derived from the chemokine viral macrophage inflammatory protein II, we tested the hypothesis that the inhibition of CXCR4 increases sensitivity to chemotherapy by interfering with stromal/leukemia cell interactions. First, leukemic cells expressing varying amounts of surface CXCR4 were examined for their chemotactic response to SDF-1alpha or stromal cells, alone or in the presence of different CXCR4 inhibitors. Results showed that the polypeptide RCP168 had the strongest antagonistic effect on the SDF-1alpha- or stromal cell-induced chemotaxis of leukemic cells. Furthermore, RCP168 blocked the binding of anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody 12G5 to surface CXCR4 in a concentration-dependent manner and inhibited SDF-1alpha-induced AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation. Finally, RCP168 significantly enhanced chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in stroma-cocultured Jurkat, primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and in a subset of acute myelogenous leukemia cells harboring Flt3 mutation. Equivalent results were obtained with the small-molecule CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3465. Our data therefore suggest that the SDF-1alpha/CXCR4 interaction contributes to the resistance of leukemia cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Disruption of these interactions by the peptide CXCR4 inhibitor RCP168 represents a novel strategy for targeting leukemic cells within the bone marrow microenvironment.",

Tandem duplication was found in 6/30(20%) AML cases: 2/8 M1, 1/8 M2, 2/6 M3, 1/6 M4 with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in two cases. Four of the cases with duplication were males and the other two cases were females. Complete remission was achieved in 16.6% of cases with duplication vs. 45.8% in cases without duplication. Failure to achieve induction remission was noted in 50% of cases with duplication vs. 29.1% in cases without duplication. FLt3/ITD was not found in ALL cases. Lineage restriction analysis revealed that Flt3/ITD was not present in lymphocytes, suggesting a lack of stem cell involvement for this mutation. Flt3/ITD was the most significant prognostic factor as declared by multivariate analysis.

In contrast to the oncogenic role of miR-22 reported in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and breast cancer, here we show that miR-22 is an essential anti-tumour gatekeeper in de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) where it is significantly downregulated. Forced expression of miR-22 significantly suppresses leukaemic cell viability and growth in vitro, and substantially inhibits leukaemia development and maintenance in vivo. Mechanistically, miR-22 targets multiple oncogenes, including CRTC1, FLT3 and MYCBP, and thus represses the CREB and MYC pathways. The downregulation of miR-22 in AML is caused by TET1/GFI1/EZH2/SIN3A-mediated epigenetic repression and/or DNA copy-number loss. Furthermore, nanoparticles carrying miR-22 oligos significantly inhibit leukaemia progression in vivo. Together, our study uncovers a TET1/GFI1/EZH2/SIN3A/miR-22/CREB-MYC signalling circuit and thereby provides insights into epigenetic/genetic mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AML, and also highlights the clinical potential of miR-22-based AML therapy.

MR22388 is highly cytotoxic (within the nanomolar range) against numerous cancer cell lines and studies of its cytotoxicity mechanisms show that it is a weak inhibitor of the polymerization of tubulin and that it induces apoptosis via the MAP kinase pathways. Further MR22388 is a very strong inhibitor of several kinases including the tyrosine kinase FLT3-ITD. FLT3-ITD is a mutated form of the tyrosine kinase receptor (RTK) FLT3, resulting in the constitutive activation of the kinase, occurring in about 25% of normal karyotypes' Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and is linked to a bad prognosis. Consecutively, MR22388 appears as a novel promising anticancer lead agent especially for AML therapy.",

However, approximately 50% of adult AMLs have normal cytogenetics (NC-AMLs), and represent a heterogeneous and poorly understood group. We analysed gene expression in 55 AML samples including 53 cases from adult patients with NC-AML (n = 36), trisomy 8, t(15;17), t(8;21), t(11;19), 7q deletion, and two cell lines using 9000-gene DNA microarrays. Global hierarchical clustering showed that NC-AMLs are a heterogeneous group. Supervised analysis distinguished two subgroups of NC-AML: one subgroup constituted a homogeneous NC cluster ('pure NC-AML'), and the other NC-AMLs were close to the AML cases with translocations ('translocation like'). Gene expression signatures were also derived for patients with trisomy 8, as well as FLT3 and MLL gene duplications. Importantly, samples from 24 NC-AML patients who could be evaluated for clinical outcome were analysed. In all, 43 genes that discriminated two classes of patients with significantly different prognosis were identified. The poor prognosis class contained a majority of 'pure NC-AMLs', whereas the 'translocation-like' AMLs were in the good prognosis class. Discriminator genes included genes involved in drug resistance (TOP2B), protein transport (MTX2, SLC35A2), and cell signalling (MAPK1, PRKAB2). Our results demonstrate the transcriptional heterogeneity of NC-AMLs, and suggest the existence of 'translocation-like' NC-AMLs and of a gene expression signature that may predict response to chemotherapy.",

Intervening in aberrant signaling pathway provides a rational approach for in vivo targeting of AML cells. Constitutive NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity was observed in 16 of 22 (73%) investigated AML cases and was, in general, associated with resistance to spontaneous apoptosis. Indeed, inhibition of NF-kappaB activity by the NF-kappaB inhibitor SN-50 peptide resulted in enhanced chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. In the majority of cases, constitutive NF-kappaB activity was mediated by a Ras/PI3 kinase (PI3-K)/protein kinase B (PKB)-mediated pathway. The PI3-K inhibitor Ly294002 and the Ras inhibitor L-744832 both inhibited PKB phosphorylation and NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity. The constitutive activation of Ras GTP-ase was caused by mutations in the gene encoding for N-Ras in 29% of the cases. The constitutive NF-kappaB activity could so far not be ascribed to the autocrine production of growth factors or to mutations in the Flt3 receptor, since anti-GM-CSF, -IL-1, -IL6, -TNFalpha or the tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1296 did not affect the NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity. The present study demonstrates that Ras activation is an important pathway for triggering the NF-kappaB pathway in AML cells.",

Here, we investigated the ability of the novel HDM2 inhibitor CGM097 to potently and selectively kill WT p53-expressing AML cells. The antileukemic effects of CGM097 were studied using cell-based proliferation assays (human AML cell lines, primary AML patient cells, and normal bone marrow samples), apoptosis, and cell-cycle assays, ELISA, immunoblotting, and an AML patient-derived in vivo mouse model. CGM097 potently and selectively inhibited the proliferation of human AML cell lines and the majority of primary AML cells expressing WT p53, but not mutant p53, in a target-specific manner. Several patient samples that harbored mutant p53 were comparatively unresponsive to CGM097. Synergy was observed when CGM097 was combined with FLT3 inhibition against oncogenic FLT3-expressing cells cultured both in the absence as well as the presence of cytoprotective stromal-secreted cytokines, as well as when combined with MEK inhibition in cells with activated MAPK signaling. Finally, CGM097 was effective in reducing leukemia burden in vivo.

Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are relatively resistant to current chemotherapy and likely contribute to disease relapse and progression. Consequently, the identification of drugs that can efficiently eradicate LSCs is an important priority. In the present study, we investigated the antileukemia activity of the compound TDZD-8. Analysis of primary AML, blast crisis CML (bcCML), ALL, and chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL) specimens showed rapid induction of cell death upon treatment with TDZD-8. In addition, for myeloid leukemias, cytotoxicity was observed for phenotypically primitive cells, in vitro colony-forming progenitors, and LSCs as defined by xenotransplantation assays. In contrast, no significant toxicity was observed for normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Notably, cell death was frequently evident within 2 hours or less of TDZD-8 exposure. Cellular and molecular studies indicate that the mechanism by which TDZD-8 induces cell death involves rapid loss of membrane integrity, depletion of free thiols, and inhibition of both the PKC and FLT3 signaling pathways.

        "Doc_abstract":"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been genetically characterized extensively and can now be subdivided into 9 to 11 pathogenetically different subtypes according to their profile of driver mutations. In clinical practice karyotyping and molecular analysis of NPM1, cEBPa and FLT3-ITD are required for treatment stratification and potentially genotype specific treatment. Some markers such as NPM1 not only offer prognostic information but can also serve as markers of minimal residual disease and thus have the potential to guide therapy in the future.The basis of curative treatment is intensive combination chemotherapy comprizing cytarabine and an anthracycline (\"7 + 3\" regimen). The prolonged duration of aplasia can be reduced significantly by accelerated therapy (\"S-HAM\" regimen). Following achievement of a complete remission patients with a low risk of relapse - based on genetic and clinical features - receive chemotherapy based consolidation therapy whereas high risk patients - and potentially also those with an intermediate risk - receive an allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Whereas adding the rather unspecific tyrosinekinase inhibitor sorafenib to standard treatment in unselected AML patients has not improved overall survival (OS), the addition of midostaurin to standard therapy in the selected group FLT3 mutated patients has resulted in a moderate but significant OS benefit.Real world data show that in patients below 50 years a cure rate of ca. 50 % can be achieved. However less than 10 % of patients above the age of 70 will be alive after five years even after intensive treatment. Therefore when curative and intensive treatment is deemed impossible the therapeutic standard in elderly and unfit patients used to be low-dose cytarabine with an average OS of 4 months. This has now been replaced by a new standard of care of hypomethylating agents - azacytidine and decitabine - which both achieve higher remission rates and show strong trends towards a prolonged OS of between 8 and 10 months.The paradigm for genotype-specific therapy is acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL - or AML M3 in the former FAB classification). This entity used to be a problematic AML subgroup because of its frequent coagulation disturbances and potentially fatal bleeding problems. Today patients with APL can be treated with a chemotherapy free combination of ATRA - a differentiating agent - and Arsenic Trioxide - an apoptosis inducing agent. In patients with a leukocyte count < 10 000 / µl a cure rate of > 90 % can now be achieved.",

It may still be possible to improve remission induction treatment eg by intensifying the Ara-C dose although may this only be detectable in an improved disease free survival. The is to reduce relapse. The risk main challenge is pre-determined by a number of powerful risk factors. In the experience of the MRC age, cytogenetics and clearance of blasts from the bone marrow after course 1. Using the later two in combination good risk patients (FAB M3, t(8;21) t(15;17) inv(16)) have a relapse risk of 32%. Poor risk (blasts >15% after course 1 or abnormalities of Chs 5 or 7, 3q- and complex changes have a relapse risk of 82%. All other cases are standard risk and ve a relapse risk of 56%. FLT3 mutations have been detected in about 25% of cases and provide additional negative predictive value overall and within each risk group. The assessment of the most effective consolidation treatment must be made taking into account the heterogeneity of the relapse risk. The MRC investigated the role of allo and autoBMT in addition to intensive chemotherapy. The data was analysis on an intent-to-treat or donor vs no donor basis. Although both types of transplant were able to reduce relapse overall and in all risk groups, there was an overall survival advantage only in standard risk patients. Since chemotherapy has improved since this study, there remains uncertainty about the benefit of transplant in all risk groups. Overall this experience has demonstrated that relapse can be reduced with more therapy. It is probable that the limits of conventional chemotherapy have been reached. The new AML15 trial will assess the value of adding the immunoconjugate (Mylotarg) to induction and/or chemotherapy. Improvements in older patients have been less detectable. MRC trials over the last 20 years show an improvement in remission rate (now 65%) but persistent poor survival (12% at 5 years). In the MRC AML11 Trial three induction schedules were compared (DAT vs ADE vs MAC) with DAT being superior. A comparison of a total of 3 vs 6 courses of treatment or the addition of interferon maintenance did not improve results.

Currently, less than half of the AML patients have a specific marker detectable by RT-PCR techniques. The major specific molecular markers are involvement of the MLL gene with up to 50 different partners and partial tandem duplications, the core binding factor leukemias with AML1/ETO and CBFbeta/MYH11 rearrangements, PML/RARalpha in acute promyelocytic leukemia, internal tandem duplications and mutations of FLT3 and some other rare translocations. In addition, several other genes show abnormal expression levels in AML, including the Wilms tumor gene, the PRAME gene and Ig/TCR rearrangements. Most of these genetic abnormalities can be detected by qualitative but more importantly by quantitative RT-PCR. The kinetics of disappearance of molecular markers in AML differs between the various types of leukemias, although at least a 2 log reduction of transcript after induction chemotherapy is necessary for long-term remission in all types. Conversely, the change of PCR from negativity to positivity is highly predictive of relapse. Whereas in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, multiparametric flow cytometry is an established method for MRD detection, this is less so in AML. The reason is the absence of well-characterized leukemia-specific antigens and the existence of phenotypic changes at relapse. On the other hand, this method is convenient due to its simplicity and universal applicability. In conclusion, several methods can be used for MRD detection in AML patients; each has its pros and cons. Several issues still remain to be settled including the choice of the best method and the timing for MRD monitoring and above all the practical clinical implications of MRD in the various types of AML.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Molecular targeting therapies for hematological malignant diseases such as monoclonal antibodies and small molecules have been reviewed. Imatinib mesylate (STI571) targets the tyrosine kinase activity of the BCR-ABL fusion protein in CML, and was superior to IFN-alpha plus low-dose cytarabine in newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML in a phase III randomized study. Imatinib induced apoptosis in BCR-ABL-positive cells in vitro, and activates several signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt, STAT5 and Ras/MAPK. Combination therapies with imatinib and new strategies for downregulation of intracellular BCR-ABL protein levels have also been investigated from the phenomenon of resistance to imatinib. Anti-CD20 (rituximab) became the first monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of a relapsed/refractory follicular/low-grade NHL and promising results were obtained from a phase III randomized study. Although antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-mediated cytotoxicity are likely to be the major effectors of B-cell depletion in vivo, direct cytotoxicity by CD20 monoclonal antibody on B-cell lines in vitro has been reported. Anti-CD33 (Mylotarg) and FLT3 inhibitors for AML have also been used in clinical trials and signaling pathways induced by these agents are under intensive investigation. Arsenic trioxide, like all-TRANS-retinoic acid (ATRA), downregulates promyelocytic leukemia protein/retinoic acid receptor-alpha (PML/RARalpha) fusion protein and induced apoptosis in APL cells, and promising results were obtained from ATRA-resistant APL patients. Finally we show our promising in vitro and in vivo data of R-etodolac (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug lacking cyclooxygenase inhibitor activity) against chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Knowledge of the molecular events that govern human thyroid tumorigenesis has grown considerably in the past ten years. Key genetic alterations and new oncogenic pathways have been identified. Molecular genetic aberrations in thyroid carcinomas bear noteworthy resemblance to those in acute myelogenous leukemias. Thyroid carcinomas and myeloid leukemias both possess transcription factor gene rearrangements-PPARgamma-related translocations in thyroid carcinoma and RARalpha-related and CBF-related translocations (amongst others) in myeloid leukemia. PPARgamma and RARalpha are closely related members ofthe same nuclear receptor subfamily, and the PML-RARalpha and PAX8-PPARgamma fusion proteins both function as dominant negative inhibitors of their wild-type parent proteins. Thyroid carcinomas and myeloid leukemias also both harbor NRAS mutations (15-25% of both cancers) and receptor tyrosine kinase mutations--RET mutations in thyroid carcinomas and FLT3 mutations in myeloid leukemias. The NRAS and tyrosine receptor kinase mutations are not observed in the same thyroid carcinoma or leukemia patients, suggesting that multiple initiating pathways exist in both. Lastly, thyroid carcinomas and myeloid leukemias possess p53 mutations at relatively low frequency (10-15%) in patients who tend to be older and have more aggressive, therapy resistant disease. Such parallels are unlikely to occur by chance alone and argue that common mechanisms underlie these diverse epithelial and hematologic cancers. The comparison of thyroid carcinomas and myeloid leukemias may highlight areas of thyroid cancer investigation worthy of further focus. For example, few collaborating mutations have been defined in thyroid carcinomas even though they play a clear role in myeloid leukemias, as exemplified by RARalpha rearrangements and FLT3 mutations that together dictate the promyleocytic leukemia phenotype. Functional interactions between collaborating mutations are possible at multiple levels, and it is tempting to speculate that some thyroid carcinomas might develop through an unique combination or co-activation of RET and RAS and/or RET and PPARgamma (and/or other) signaling systems. In fact, the ELE1-RET (PTC3) fusion protein contains the ELE1 nuclear receptor co-activator domain and it appears to physically associate with and inhibit wild-type PPARgamma in some papillary carcinomas. The similarities of the fusion proteins in thyroid carcinoma and myeloid leukemia suggest that a more directed search for fusion genes in non-thyroid carcinomas is warranted. In fact, novel fusion genes have been identified recently in aggressive midline, secretory breast, and renal cell carcinomas, although the epithelial nature of the latter is not well-documented. Interestingly, these cancers all tend to present more frequently in adolescence and young adulthood in a manner similar to thyroid and myeloid malignancies that have fusion genes. The analyses of cancers that present earlier in life may enhance fusion gene recognition in other carcinoma types. Definition and biologic characterization of the precursor cells that give rise to thyroid carcinoma will also be important. Myeloid leukemias are thought to arise from stem/progenitor cells that acquire disturbed self-renewal and differentiation capacities but retain characteristics of the myeloid lineages. Although the presence of comparable stem/progenitor cells in the thyroid are not defined, distinct thyroid cancer lineages and patterns of differentiation exist and candidate stem/progenitor cells such as the p63-immunoreactive solid cell nests are apparent. A last important area is development of molecular-based therapies for thyroid carcinoma patients resistant to standard radio-iodine treatment. Treatments for such cancers are limited and pathways defined by thyroid cancer mutations are prime targets for pharmacologic interventions with molecular inhibitors. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors and nuclear receptor ligands have proven dramatically effective in some myeloid leukemia patients. Various molecular inhibitors are being investigated now in thyroid cancer models. Such developments predict that the thyroid cancer model will continue to provide biologic insights into human carcinoma biology and that improved pathologic diagnosis and treatment for thyroid cancer patients sit on the not too distant horizon."}]
