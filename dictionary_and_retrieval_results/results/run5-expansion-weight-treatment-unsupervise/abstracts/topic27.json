RET oncogenes arise through sporadic and inherited gene mutations and are involved in the etiopathogenesis of medullary thyroid carcinoma, a cancer that responds poorly to conventional chemotherapy. Medullary thyroid carcinoma is a component of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 or MEN2 syndromes.;We investigated the cellular effects of RPI-1, a novel 2-indolinone Ret tyrosine kinase inhibitor on cells that express RET C634 oncogenic mutants common in the MEN2A syndrome: NIH3T3 fibroblasts transfected with RET(C634R) and human medullary thyroid carcinoma TT cells that express endogenous RET(C634W). RPI-1 antiproliferative activity was determined by cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth assays. Expression and phosphorylation of Ret and of proteins involved in downstream signaling pathways were examined by immunoblotting. Antitumor activity of oral RPI-1 treatment was tested by using two dosing levels in nude mice bearing subcutaneous TT xenograft tumors. All statistical tests were two-sided.;The RPI-1 IC50 value for cell proliferation was 3.6 microM (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.8 to 5.4 microM) in NIH3T3 cells expressing the Ret mutant compared with 16 microM (95% CI = 12.3 to 19.7 microM) in non-transfected NIH3T3 cells, and that for colony formation in soft agar was 2.4 microM (95% CI = 0.8 to 4.0 microM) and 26 microM (95% CI = 17 to 35 microM) in RET mutant-transfected and H-RAS-transfected NIH3T3 cells, respectively. In NIH3T3 cells expressing the Ret mutant, Ret protein and tyrosine phosphorylation were undetectable after 24 hours of RPI-1 treatment. In TT cells, RPI-1 inhibited proliferation, Ret tyrosine phosphorylation, Ret protein expression, and the activation of PLCgamma, ERKs and AKT. In mice, oral daily RPI-1 treatment inhibited the tumor growth of TT xenografts by 81% (P<.001 versus control mice) and reduced the plasma levels of the specific biomarker calcitonin (P =.01 versus control mice). Twenty-five percent of RPI-1-treated mice were tumor-free.;Ret oncoproteins represent exploitable targets for therapeutic intervention in MEN2A-associated medullary thyroid carcinoma. The antitumor efficacy and oral bioavailability of RPI-1 support its therapeutic potential.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2 syndromes are rare but important endocrine diseases that are increasingly managed by pediatric providers. MTC is generally associated with a favorable prognosis when diagnosed during childhood, where it frequently occurs secondary to activating mutations in the RET proto-oncogene and arises from pre-existing C-cell hyperplasia. MEN2A accounts for 90-95% of childhood MTC cases and is most commonly due to mutations in codon 634 of RET. MEN2B is associated with the most aggressive clinical presentation of MTC and is almost always due to the Met918Thr mutation of RET. Surgery is the primary treatment and only chance of cure, although the advent of targeted therapies seems to be improving progression-free survival in advanced cases. Since the discovery of the role of RET in MEN2A, considerable advances in the management of this syndrome have occurred, and most of the children with MEN2A who have undergone early thyroidectomy will now lead full, productive lives. Strong genotype-phenotype correlations have facilitated the development of guidelines for interventions. Contemporary approaches for deciding the appropriate age at which surgery should take place incorporate data from ultrasonography and calcitonin measurements in addition to the results of genotyping. To optimize care and to facilitate ongoing research, children with MTC and the MEN2 syndromes are optimally treated at tertiary centers with multidisciplinary expertise.",

ZD6474 (vandetanib) is an ATP-competitive inhibitor of RET, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptors kinases. In this study, we have studied ZD6474 mechanism of action in TT and MZ-CRC-1 human MTC cell lines, carrying cysteine 634 to tryptophan (C634W) and methionine 918 to threonine (M918T) RET mutation respectively. ZD6474 blunted MTC cell proliferation and RET, Shc and p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation. Single receptor knockdown by RNA interference showed that MTC cells depended on RET for proliferation. Adoptive expression of the ZD6474-resistant V804M RET mutant rescued proliferation of TT cells under ZD6474 treatment, showing that RET is a key ZD6474 target in these MTC cells. Upon RET inhibition, adoptive stimulation of EGFR partially rescued TT cell proliferation, MAPK signaling, and expression of cell-cycle-related genes. This suggests that simultaneous inhibition of RET and EGFR by ZD6474 may overcome the risk of MTC cells to escape from RET blockade through compensatory over-activation of EGFR.",

Using a proteomic-multiplexed analysis of the phosphotyrosine signaling together with antibody-based validation techniques, we identified several candidate molecules for RET (rearranged during transfection) tyrosine kinase receptor carrying mutations responsible for the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A and 2B (MEN2A and MEN2B) syndromes in two human medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) cell lines, TT and MZ-CRC-1, which express the RET-MEN2A and RET-MEN2B oncoproteins, respectively. Signaling elements downstream of these oncoproteins were identified after treating cells with the indolinone tyrosine kinase inhibitor RPI-1 to knock down RET phosphorylation activity. We detected 23 and 18 affinity-purified phosphotyrosine proteins in untreated TT and MZ-CRC-1 cells, respectively, most of which were shared and sensitive to RPI-1 treatment. However, our data clearly point to specific signaling features of the RET-MEN2A and RET-MEN2B oncogenic pathways. Moreover, the detection of high-level expression of minimally phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in both TT and MZ-CRC-1 cells, together with our data on the effects of EGF stimulation on the proteomic profiles and the response to Gefitinib treatment, suggest the relevance of EGFR signaling in these cell lines, especially since analysis of 14 archival MTC specimens revealed EGFR mRNA expression in all samples. Together, our data suggest that RET/EGFR multi-target inhibitors might be beneficial for therapy of MTC.",

Ligand-induced activation induces dimerization and tyrosine phosphorylation of the RET receptor with downstream activation of several signal transduction pathways. Activating germline RET mutations play a central role in the development of the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes MEN2A, MEN2B, and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) and also in the development of the congenital abnormality Hirschsprung's disease. Approximately 50% of patients with sporadic MTC have somatic RET mutations, and a significant portion of papillary thyroid carcinomas result from chromosomal inversions or translocations, which activate RET (RET/PTC oncogenes). The RET protooncogene has a significant place in cancer prevention and treatment. Timely thyroidectomy in kindred members who have inherited a mutated RET allele, characteristic of MEN2A, MEN2B, or FMTC, can prevent MTC, the most common cause of death in these syndromes.

We have established a transplantable MTC in nude mice from a sporadic human MTC carrying a RET C634R mutation. Transplanted tumors had an exponential growth rate with an approximate doubling time of about 3 weeks, and expressed a neuroendocrine phenotype characteristic of MTC, e.g., expression of calcitonin, chromogranin A (CgA), synaptophysin, synaptic vesicle protein 2 (SV2), vesicular monoamine transporter-1 and -2, carcinoembryonic antigen, cytokeratin 8/18, epithelial cadherin, and neural cell adhesion molecule.

In this exploratory study, we investigated the expression of eight key TKI target proteins (EGFR, KIT, MET, PDGFRB, VEGF (VEGFA), VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4)) by immunohistochemistry in 103 molecularly characterized MTC samples and identified the associated clinical and molecular features. A number of MTC samples exhibited a high expression of VEGFR2 and VEGFR3, which were overexpressed in 57 and 43% of the MTC samples respectively. VEGFR1, PDGFRB, VEGF, KIT, and MET were present in 34-20% of the cases, while EGFR was highly expressed in only 10% of the MTC samples. Some proteins exhibited large differences in expression between sporadic and familial cases, suggesting that different RET mutations may be associated with the immunohistochemical profiles. MTC samples with the C634 RET mutation exhibited a higher expression of VEGFR3 and KIT than the M918T RET-mutated and non-mutated RET tumor samples (P=0.005 and P=0.007 respectively) and a lower expression of VEGFR1 (P=0.04). Non-mutated RET MTC cases exhibited a lower expression of PDGFRB (P=0.04).

Prophylactic total thyroidectomy was performed in every RET mutation gene carriers.;In all families the index case were patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma presenting at a mean age of 37.25 years (range 23-42). The RET oncogen mutation was in codon 634 in exon 11 (multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A) in all these patients. Fourteen gene carriers were identified with a mean age of 20 years (range 7-37), eleven of whom had medullary thyroid carcinoma at the time of surgery. Five of the gene carriers were children, with a mean age of 11 years (range 7-16), four of whom had microcarcinoma and one had metastatic carcinoma at the time of surgery. After surgery no hypoparathyroidism or recurrent nerve paralysis were documented. No pediatric patient has presented with phaeochromocytoma or hypoparathyroidism to date Four of the five children have normal calcitonin levels (< 2 pg/ml) and they are free of disease. The one who presented metastatic carcinoma has recurrent disease and is awaiting surgical treatment.;Genetic studies of family members related to patients with familiar medullary thyroid carcinoma and RET mutations is indispensable. The RET mutation in codon 634 exon 11 was found to be the most frequent association. Prophylactic thyroidectomy is the only curative treatment and has minimal complications when performed by expert surgeons.

        "Doc_abstract":"Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a malignancy of the thyroid C-cells that comprises 5-10% of all thyroid cancers. MTC occurs in both sporadic and familial forms, the latter making up 25% of all MTCs and being comprised of three distinct syndromes--multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN 2A), multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN 2B), and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). To date, screening for MTC has been performed using the pentagastrin stimulation test, which is a provocative test for calcitonin release. Germline mutations in the RET protooncogene have been identified in families manifesting these syndromes and genetic screening of individuals at risk of one of these syndromes has become integral to their clinical management. The majority of the mutations associated with MEN 2A and FMTC are tightly clustered in a cysteine-rich region of the RET receptor. A single mutation associated with MEN 2B is in the the tyrosine kinase domain of the RET receptor. Somatic mutations have been identified in the tumor tissue of individuals with sporadic MTC and may prove to be helpful markers in discerning the hereditary or sporadic nature of the MTC. There is general agreement that the primary operation for MTC should include total thyroidectomy and central neck lymph node clearance. The role of microdissection for recurrent disease awaits longitudinal evaluation. External radiotherapy, radionuclide therapy, and chemotherapy may have a role in palliation, but have not been proven to have a curative value. Prognostic factors are discussed.",

RET oncogenes that have been implicated in the development of thyroid carcinomas are emerging as potential therapeutic targets. In the present study, we investigated the efficacy and the cellular bases of antitumor activity of the indolinone Ret tyrosine kinase inhibitor RPI-1 against large established s.c. TT tumor xenograft, a human medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) harboring oncogenic MEN-2A-type RET mutation. Oral treatment with RPI-1 caused growth arrest or regression in 81% treated tumors. Following treatment suspension, tumor inhibition was maintained (51%, P<0.05, 100 days) and cures were achieved in 2/11 mice. In treated tumors, Ret was tyrosine dephosphorylated. Moreover, compared to control tumors, a significant increase in apoptotic cells (210%, P<0.0001), loss of cellularity (47%, P<0.0001) and reduction of microvessel density (36%, P<0.0005) were detected. In vivo effects of RPI-1 were reflected in activation of BAD, cleavage of caspases, apoptotic DNA fragmentation and inhibition of VEGF production observed in in vitro RPI-1-treated TT cells. These findings thus indicate that RPI-1 antitumor effect on the MTC was characterized by apoptosis induction and angiogenesis inhibition. The results, consistent with a dependence on RET oncogene activation for maintenance and survival of MEN2A-type MTC, provide further preclinical rationale for a pharmacological RET-targeted intervention in thyroid cancer.",

MTC is mainly sporadic in nature, but an hereditary pattern [multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2)] is present in 20-30% of cases, transmitted as an autosomal-dominant trait due to germline mutations of the RET proto-oncogene. About 98% of patients with MEN 2 have germline mutations in exons 5, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 or 16 of the RET gene. The primary treatment of both hereditary and sporadic forms of MTC is total thyroidectomy and removal of all neoplastic tissue present in the neck. The therapeutic option for lymph node surgery should be dictated by the results of presurgical evaluation. After total thyroidectomy, measurements of serum calcitonin (CT) and carcinoembryonic antigen are of paramount importance in the postsurgical follow-up of patients with MTC as they reflect the presence of persistent or recurrent disease. Complete remission is demonstrated by undetectable and stimulated serum CT measurement. On the contrary, if serum CT is detectable under basal conditions or becomes detectable after stimulation, the patient is probably not cured, but imaging techniques will not demonstrate any disease until serum CT approaches levels >150 pg/ml. The tumour metastasises early to both paratracheal and lateral cervical lymph nodes. Metastases outside the neck may occur in the liver, lungs, bones and, less frequently, brain and skin. Surgery is the main treatment for local and distant metastases whenever feasible. Systemic chemotherapy with dacarbazine, 5-fluorouracil and doxorubicin (alone or in combination) has shown very limited efficacy, achieving only partial responses in the range of 10-20% and of short duration. Several kinase inhibitors are currently under evaluation and preliminary results are promising. Familial cases must be identified by searching for RET proto-oncogene mutations in the proband and in family members. Carriers of the RET gene are candidates for prophylactic thyroidectomy at different ages depending on the risk associated with the specific RET mutations.",

Approximately 40 percent of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) typically have either intrachromosomal or extrachromosomal rearrangements that join the promoter and NH(2)-terminal domains of unrelated genes to the COOH-terminal fragment of RET. The RET point mutations associated with MEN2A, MEN2B, or FMTC, or the chromosomal breakpoints and translocations associated with PTC, typically activate the RET receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). RET kinase inhibitors are likely to be beneficial for patients with hereditary MTC, where currently there is no effective chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Recently, the low molecular weight tyrosine kinase inhibitor ZD6474 was found to block the enzymatic activity of RET-derived oncoproteins in cultured cell lines. We have developed a Drosophila model for MEN2A and MEN2B diseases by targeting oncogenic forms of RET to the developing Drosophila eye. Here we show that, when fed orally, ZD6474 suppressed RET-mediated phenotypes within the context of this in vivo model. Importantly, ZD6474 showed high efficacy and very low toxicity. This compound failed to significantly suppress an activated form of another RTK, the Drosophila epidermal growth factor receptor, nor did it suppress the activity of downstream components of the RET/Ras pathway.

We correlated mutation status with calcitonin and pathologic studies to determine genotype-phenotype correlations.;We identified a mutation in codon 804 in exon 14 (GTG-->ATG; V804M) in both families. An 86-year-old person who was a gene carrier and other individuals over age 70 who were suspected by pedigree analysis to be gene carriers had no overt clinical evidence of MTC. Four of 21 patients who underwent a thyroidectomy also had papillary thyroid cancer. One individual in each family had metastatic MTC at age 30 and 32 years, and all 26 people having thyroidectomies had either MTC or C-cell hyperplasia, leading us to continue to recommend prophylactic thyroidectomy for all identified patients who were gene carriers.;Because of active MTC in younger members of these families, including metastases, we have continued to advocate thyroid surgery in mutation-positive individuals. While DNA diagnosis of gene carriers and subsequent genetic counseling was relatively straightforward, the acceptance of surgical recommendations was more difficult for some individuals. These families demonstrate that the search for RET mutations should include exons 13, 14, 15, and 16 in patients whose studies in exons 10 and 11 are negative.",

The clinical course of this disease varies from extremely indolent tumors that can go unchanged for years to an extremely aggressive variant that is associated with a high mortality rate. As many as 75% of all medullary thyroid carcinomas are sporadic, with an average age at presentation reported as 60 years, and the remaining 25% are hereditary with an earlier age of presentation, ranging from 20 to 40 years. Germline RET proto-oncogene mutations are the genetic causes of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 and a strong genotype-phenotype correlation exists, particularly between a specific RET codon mutation and the (a) age-related onset and (b) thyroid tumor progression, from C-cell hyperplasia to medullary thyroid carcinoma and, ultimately, to nodal metastases. RET mutations predispose an individual to the development of medullary thyroid carcinomas and can also influence the individual response to RET protein receptor-targeted therapies. RET codon 609 point mutations are rare genetic events belonging to the intermediate risk category for the onset of medullary thyroid carcinoma. A large genealogy resulting in a less aggressive form of medullary thyroid carcinoma is associated with the high penetrance of pheochromocytoma and has been reported in the literature. In this short review article, we comment on our previous report of a large multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A kindred with the same Cys609Ser germline RET mutation in which, conversely, the syndrome was characterized by a slightly aggressive, highly penetrant form of medullary thyroid carcinoma that was associated with low penetrance of pheochromocytoma and primary hyperparathyroidism.",

Currently therapy is restricted to surgical removal of all neoplastic tissue lacking alternative forms of treatment such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Therefore MTC is a particularly attractive target for gene therapeutic approaches. Many promising gene therapy strategies have been used in various animal models of MTC, showing enhanced antitumoral efficacy, and these will hopefully extend our current standard of care in the future. These approaches can tentatively be subdivided into four groups: (a) Inhibition of oncogenic RET signaling, (b) suicide gene therapy, (c) immunotherapy, and (d) combination of immunotherapy and suicide approaches. To block oncogenic signal transduction dominant-negative RET mutants were delivered into tumor cells and found to possess strong antineoplastic activity, including tumor growth suppression and increased animal survival. Suicide gene therapeutic approaches applied to MTC treatment featured either gene transfer of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase with concomitant application of ganciclovir or delivery of nitric oxide synthase II. Here antitumor effects were attributed to the occurrence of substantial bystander activities. Immunotherapy approaches comprised stimulation of immune response by delivery of interleukin 2 or 12. Finally, treatment with herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase/ganciclovir in combination with interleukin 2 was found to be superior over either treatment alone. This review discusses the various gene therapeutic approaches applied to MTC treatment in detail, gives an overview on the diverse vector systems used to achieve efficient transduction of thyroid cancer cells, and points out the strategies employed to accomplish target cell selective gene expression thereby contributing to enhanced safety of gene therapy for MTC",

The treatment of choice is surgery. Early diagnosis and an adeguate initial operation provide the best chance of cure. Hence, the diagnosis should be made preoperatively. Genetic testing can identify almost all affected individuals with hereditary disease and permits prophylactic/early thyroidectomy in gene carriers. Total thyroidectomy and lymphadenectomy of the cervicocentral compartment is mandatory in all patients. In addition, bilateral dissection of the cervicolateral compartment should be done in all cases with more than microscopic disease. Plasma calcitonin is an excellent marker for postoperative follow-up. Treatment of persistent/recurrent disease is primarily surgical. Hence, a reoperative cervical lymphadenectomy should be considered in patients with persistently elevated calcitonin levels and no signs of distant metastases. Chemotherapy and external radiotherapy have little impact on the course of avanced disease; more promising is metabolic radiotherapy with Y90-DOTATOC in patients with somatostatin receptor-positive tumours.",

Here, we report that, consistent with its effects in vitro, locally or systemically administered recombinant LIF effectively suppressed growth of TT and MZ-CRC-1 xenografts in mice. Further, as predicted from its effects in TT and MZ-CRC-1 cell cultures in vitro, recombinant LIF activated the JAK/STAT pathway and downregulated RET and E2F1 expression in tumors in mice.

Often, this is not possible for sporadic MTC; however, genetic testing for hereditary MTC makes this possible if genetic carriers have surgery before C cells undergo malignant transformation. All patients who have MTC should be tested for RET mutations, including putative sporadic cases. The leukocytes of suspected carriers and sporadic MTC cases should be tested for MEN2-associated germ-line mutations by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the appropriate RET gene exons, including 10, 11,13, 14, 15, and 16 (see Table I). When a RET mutation is found, all first-degree relatives must be screened to determine which individuals carry the gene. If these exons are negative, the other 15 should be sequenced because a small risk of hereditary MTC remains if no germ-line mutation is found. The probability that a first-degree relative will inherit an autosomal dominant gene for MTC from an individual who has sporadic MTC in whom no germ-line mutation is found is 0.18% . Patients who have MEN2B or RET codon 883 or 918 mutation should have a total thyroidectomy within the first 6 months of life, preferably within the first month of life. Patients who have 634 mutations, which account for approximately 70% of all MTC mutations, should undergo thyroidectomy by age 5 years. The recommendations for the timing of prophylactic thyroidectomy are not consistent for the less common mutations (see Table 2). There is a balance between performing prophylactic thyroidectomy earlier than at the youngest age at with MTC has been reported to occur for a specific RET mutation (see Fig. 3 and Table 2) and the complications of thyroidectomy, including permanent hypoparathyroidism and laryngeal nerve damage. Preoperative measurement of plasma free metanephrine and neck ultrasonography always should be done if the diagnosis of MTC is known preoperatively. Initial treatment of MTC is total thyroidectomy, regardless of its genetic type or putative sporadic nature, because surgery offers the only chance for a cure. Treatment with 1311 has no place in the management of MTC. Plasma CT measurements provide an accurate estimate of tumor burden and are especially useful in identifying patients who have residual tumor. Pentagastrin- or calcium-stimulated plasma CT testing is useful in identifying CCH or early MTC in carriers of RET mutations that are associated with late onset MTC. Pheochromocytoma may occur before or after MTC and is an important cause of mortality, even in young patients. HPT is an important aspect of MEN2A and requires surgery according to current guidelines for the management of primary HPT. Early thyroidectomy and appropriate management of pheochromocytoma clearly have modified the course of this disease, but more research is necessary in kindreds who have rare MTC mutations. Moreover, new treatments for widespread MTC are necessary because current chemotherapy agents offer little benefit. New drugs that lock the action of tyrosine kinase offer some hope.",

Not all patients with progressive MTC respond to current therapy inhibiting RET, demanding additional therapeutic strategies. We recently demonstrated that disrupting mitochondrial metabolism using a mitochondria-targeted agent or by depleting a mitochondrial chaperone effectively suppressed human MTC cells in culture and in mouse xenografts by inducing apoptosis and RET downregulation. These observations led us to hypothesize that mitochondria are potential therapeutic targets for MTC. This study further tests this hypothesis using1-ethyl-2-[[3-ethyl-5-(3-methylbenzothiazolin-2-yliden)]-4-oxothiazolidin-2-ylidenemethyl] pyridinium chloride (MKT-077), a water-soluble rhodocyanine dye analogue, which can selectively accumulate in mitochondria.;The effects of MKT-077 on cell proliferation, survival, expression of RET and tumor protein 53 (TP53), and mitochondrial activity were determined in the human MTC lines in culture and in mouse xenografts.;MKT-077 induced cell cycle arrest in TT and MZ-CRC-1. Intriguingly, MKT-077 also induced RET downregulation and strong cell death responses in TT cells, but not in MZ-CRC-1 cells. This discrepancy was mainly due to the difference between the capacities of these cell lines to retain MKT-077 in mitochondria. The cytotoxicity of MKT-077 in TT cells was mainly attributed to oxidative stress while being independent of TP53. MKT-077 also effectively suppressed tumor growth of TT xenografts.;MKT-077 can suppress cell survival of certain MTC subtypes by accumulating in mitochondria and interfering with mitochondrial activity although it can also suppress cell proliferation via other mechanisms. These results consistently support the hypothesis that mitochondrial targeting has therapeutic potential for MTC.",

Each variant of MEN2 results from a different RET gene mutation, with a good genotype-phenotype correlation with regard to aggressiveness of MTC, time of onset of MTC and the presence or absence of other endocrine tumours. Recommendations on the timing of prophylactic thyroidectomy and extent of surgery are based on a classification of RET mutations into three risk levels using the genotype-phenotype correlations. MEN2 provides a unique model for early prevention and cure of cancer and for stratified roles of mutation-based diagnosis of carriers.",

The diagnosis is made by fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) and by measuring calcitonin levels in the blood. Primary treatment consists of surgical resection including a total thyroidectomy, central neck nodal dissection and functional lateral neck nodal dissections. Most patients with a palpable primary tumour have nodal disease at the time of operation, and nodal involvement is often bilateral.;adequate resection of the primary tumour and cervical lymph nodes is important to optimize outcome and minimize the risk of recurrent disease. Following primary surgical resection, more than 50% of the patients will have recurrent disease with persistent elevation of calcitonin levels. Currently, there is no adequate systemic therapy for recurrent disease. Surgical reoperation or conservative observation are the best available options.",

The RET receptor plays a crucial role in regulating cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival through embryogenesis.

Germline point mutations are found in the cancer syndromes multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2, including MEN 2A and 2B, and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. These syndromes are autosomal dominantly inherited. The identification of mutations associated with these syndromes has led to genetic testing to identify patients at risk for MEN 2 and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma and subsequent implementation of prophylactic thyroidectomy in mutation carriers. In addition, more than 10 somatic rearrangements of RET have been identified from papillary thyroid carcinomas. These mutations, as those found in MEN 2, induce oncogenic activation of the RET tyrosine kinase domain via different mechanisms, making RET an excellent candidate for the design of molecular targeted therapy. Recently, various kinds of therapeutic approaches, such as tyrosine kinase inhibition, gene therapy with dominant negative RET mutants, monoclonal antibodies against oncogene products, and nuclease-resistant aptamers that recognize and inhibit RET have been developed.

One year postoperatively, development of a metastatic lesion in her right ovary necessitated a second oophorectomy.;MTC usually manifests as a solitary thyroid nodule but should be considered in patients with metastatic lesions characterized by neuroendocrine features. This unusual case highlights the biologic and clinical variability of this often aggressive thyroid cancer, which necessitates an attentive work-up, a rigorous operative strategy, and a periodic postoperative surveillance program.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The hereditary form of medullary thyroid carcinoma may occur isolated as a familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) or as part of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia 2A (MEN2A) and 2B (MEN2B). MEN2B is a rare syndrome, its phenotype may usually, but not always, be noted by the physician. In the infant none of the MEN2B characteristics are present, except by early gastrointestinal dysfunction caused by intestinal neuromas. When available, genetic analysis confirms the diagnosis and guides pre-operative evaluation and extent of surgery. Here we report four cases of MEN2B in which the late diagnosis had a significant impact in clinical evolution and, potentially, in overall survival.;We report four cases, 2 men and 2 women, with differences in their phenotypes and with a late diagnosis. The first case has a history of severe gastrointestinal obstruction requiring a surgery intervention two days after his birth. The second told had nodules in the oral mucosa and constipation since childhood. The third case referred a history of constipation from birth until 5 months of life. The fourth has had a history of chronic constipation since childhood.;New concepts have emerged since the RET oncogene was identified in 1993 as the responsible gene for hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma. The majority of MEN2B individuals have M918T mutation in the exon 16 of RET, with a few cases having a mutation A883F or the association of V804M with E805K, Y806C or S904C mutations. The consensus classifies the RET mutation in codon 918 as of highest risk and recommends total thyroidectomy and central lymph node dissection until 6 months after birth. A fast and precise diagnosis is essential to reach these goals. The identification of early manifestations such as intestinal ganglioneuromatosis and oral mucosal neuromas should prompt the physician to initiate an investigation for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B.;The diagnosis of MEN2B is very important to allow appropriate investigation of associated diseases and to allow counseling and appropriate screening of relatives for a RET mutation. Even patients with MEN2B, which often have typical physical features, may not be properly recognized and be followed as a sporadic case. Based on this, all suspicious cases of multiple endocrine neoplasia should undergo a molecular genetic test.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Since medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) was first recognized as a distinct tumor in 1959, it became clear that MTC is more difficult to cure than papillary thyroid cancer and has higher rates of recurrence and mortality. MTC represents 5-8% of thyroid cancers. It derives from parafollicular cells of the ultimobranchial body derived from the neural crest. MTC secretes calcitonin and other hormonal peptides and is considered part of the amine precursor uptake and decarboxilation system. MTC may occur either as a hereditary or nonhereditary entity. Hereditary MTC can occur either alone as the familial MTC or as the thyroid manifestation of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2 syndromes (MEN 2A MEN 2B). Activating point mutations of the RET proto-oncogene have demonstrated to be causative of the familial form of medullary thyroid cancer, both isolated familial MTC and associated with MEN 2A and 2B. In the last 10 years, major improvements and new technologies have been proposed and applied in thyroid surgery; among these are molecular diagnosis with genetic screening and mini-invasive video-assisted thyroidectomy. The history of thyroid surgery starts with Billroth, Kocher and Halsted, who developed the technique for thyroidectomy between 1873 and 1910. Prophylactic surgery for patients carrying a positive RET proto-oncogene has proven to be highly effective in curing those likely to experience the development of MTC. Video-assisted procedures with central compartment dissection have proved feasible for patients carrying a positive RET proto-oncogene. This paper reviews relevant medical literature published in the English language on surgery of MTC in well-controlled trials. We discuss the particular ethical and legal issues that thyroid prophylactic surgery raises. Searches were last updated in February 2007.",

On the other hand, the presence of the mutation does not seem to influence the biological behavior of the tumor or its response to conventional treatment modalities. In the setting of medullary thyroid cancer, germline RET point-mutations are implicated in the pathogenesis of virtually all hereditary forms and somatic point-mutations in nearly half of the sporadic forms. The clinical impact of this finding is that family members at-risk of hereditary MTC may be screened by genetic analysis, to distinguish those carrying or not-carrying the mutation. The last can be reassured on their status and relieved from further follow-up. Those with the mutation may be treated at a pre-clinical stage of the disease or even before the disease is started.

Activation of RET is a mechanism of oncogenesis in medullary thyroid carcinomas where both germline and sporadic activating somatic mutations are prevalent. At present, there are no known specific RET inhibitors in clinical development, although many potent inhibitors of RET have been opportunistically identified through selectivity profiling of compounds initially designed to target other tyrosine kinases. Vandetanib and cabozantinib, both multi-kinase inhibitors with RET activity, are approved for use in medullary thyroid carcinoma, but additional pharmacological activities, most notably inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor - VEGFR2 (KDR), lead to dose-limiting toxicity. The recent identification of RET fusions present in ~1% of lung adenocarcinoma patients has renewed interest in the identification and development of more selective RET inhibitors lacking the toxicities associated with the current treatments. In an earlier publication [Newton et al, 2016; 1] we reported the discovery of a series of 2-substituted phenol quinazolines as potent and selective RET kinase inhibitors. Here we describe the development of the robust screening cascade which allowed the identification and advancement of this chemical series.  Furthermore we have profiled a panel of RET-active clinical compounds both to validate the cascade and to confirm that none display a RET-selective target profile.

These rearrangements generate chimeric RET/PTC oncogenes. In the germline, point mutations of RET are responsible for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2A and 2B) and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). Both MEN 2 mutations and PTC gene rearrangements potentiate the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of RET and, ultimately, activate the RET downstream targets. Loss-of-function mutations of RET cause Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) or colonic aganglionosis.

We investigated the clinical outcomes of MTC patients in our department.;A series of 118 patients with MTC who underwent initial surgery between 1975 and 2005 were enrolled in this study. The RET gene mutations were analyzed for all patients and 46 had germline RET gene mutations. Of those 46 patients, 26 were diagnosed as MEN 2A and 2 were diagnosed as MEN 2B. Postoperative follow-up periods averaged 141 months.;Of 115 patients who did not have distant metastasis at surgery and who underwent locally curative surgery, 78 (67.8%) were biochemically cured. All patients without pathological lymph node metastasis were biochemically cured, and 44.8% of patients with node metastasis were also biochemically cured.

Lymph node metastasis, tumor size>4 cm, extrathyroid and extranodal tumor extensions significantly affected cause-specific survival of patients.;Clinical outcomes of MTC patients in our series were better than those in Western countries, a result that might have resulted in part because of our routine MND regardless of whether clinically apparent node metastasis was detected.",

Targeting RET, therefore, might be useful in tailoring surveillance of MTC patients. Here we showed that theaflavins, the bioactive components of black tea, successfully induced apoptosis in human MTC cell line, TT, by inversely modulating two molecular pathways: (i) stalling PI3K/Akt/Bad pathway that resulted in mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTP) loss, cytochrome-c release and activation of the executioner caspases-9 and -3, and (ii) upholding p38MAPK/caspase-8/caspase-3 pathway via inhibition of Ras/Raf/ERK. Over-expression of either constitutively active myristoylated-Akt-cDNA (Myr-Akt-cDNA) or dominant-negative-caspase-8-cDNA (Dn-caspase-8-cDNA) partially blocked theaflavin-induced apoptosis, while co-transfection of Myr-Akt-cDNA and Dn-caspase-8-cDNA completely eradicated the effect of theaflavins thereby negating the possibility of existence of other pathways. A search for the upstream signaling revealed that theaflavin-induced disruption of lipid raft caused interference in anchorage of RET in lipid raft that in turn stalled phosphorylation of Ras and PI3Kinase. In such anti-survival cellular micro-environment, pro-apoptotic signals were triggered to culminate into programmed death of MTC cell. These findings not only unveil a hitherto unexplained mechanism underlying theaflavin-induced MTC death, but also validate RET as a promising and potential target for MTC therapy.",

When only accounting for germline negative patients, these rates were not significantly different (5.6% and 17%, respectively). Among them, when disease was unifocal in the ipsilateral lobe and isthmus, bilateral disease was present in 6/212 (2.8%) cases. When disease was multifocal in the ipsilateral lobe or isthmus, then bilateral disease was present in 8/37 (21.6%) cases (p < 0.001). No geographic differences in focality were identified.;The 5.6% prevalence of bilateral foci in sMTC suggests that total thyroidectomy should remain the standard of care for initial surgery, as less complete thyroid surgery may fail to address fully the primary site of disease. Whether ipsilateral tumor focality should be an independent factor determining the need for completion thyroidectomy when sMTC is diagnosed after hemithyroidectomy remains to be determined.",

MTC was present in 263 registrants, pheochromocytoma in 54, and hyperparathyroidism in 8 subjects. Of the patients with MTC, 53% were detected when asymptomatic, and among those with pheochromocytoma, 54%. Penetrance for MTC was 4% by age 10, 25% by 25, and 80% by 50. Codon-associated penetrance by age 50 ranged from 60% (codon 611) to 86% (620).

In these cancers, RET activates the ERK/MAPK, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and the JAK/STAT3 pathways. Here, we tested the efficacy of a JAK1/2- inhibitor, AZD1480, in the in vitro and in vivo growth of thyroid cancer cell lines expressing oncogenic RET. Thyroid cancer cell lines harboring RET/PTC1 (TPC-1), RET M918T (MZ-CRC1) and RET C634W (TT) alterations, as well as TPC-1 xenografts, were treated with JAK inhibitor, AZD1480. This inhibitor led to growth inhibition and/or apoptosis of the thyroid cancer cell lines in vitro, as well as to tumor regression of TPC-1 xenografts, where it efficiently blocked STAT3 activation in tumor and stromal cells. This inhibition was associated with decreased proliferation, decreased blood vessel density, coupled with increased necrosis. However, AZD1480 repressed the growth of STAT3- deficient TPC-1 cells in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating that its effects in this cell line were independent of STAT3 in the tumor cells. In all cell lines, the JAK inhibitor reduced phospho-Y1062 RET levels, and mTOR effector phospho-S6, while JAK1/2 downregulation by siRNA did not affect cell growth nor RET and S6 activation. In conclusion, AZD1480 effectively blocks proliferation and tumor growth of activated RET- thyroid cancer cell lines, likely through direct RET inhibition in cancer cells as well as by modulation of the microenvironment (e.g. via JAK/phospho-STAT3 inhibition in endothelial cells). Thus, AZD1480 should be considered as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of RET- activated thyroid cancers.",

In the majority of patients with MEN 2A/FMTC missense mutations at exon 10 or exon 11 are identifiable. Cysteine to arginine exchange at codon 634 is the mutation most frequently found. In MEN 2B approximately 95% of patients present with a mutation at codon 918 (exon 16). Additionally, less frequent mutations in other codons have been found in both syndromes. The DNA-based genotype analysis enables the identification of gene carriers at risk of developing MTC and offer them prophylactic thyroidectomy prior to development of any thyroid pathologies. Prophylactic surgery is generally recommended for MEN 2A/FMTC gene carriers at the age of 4-6 years. Due to the aggressiveness of the MEN 2B syndrome gene carriers should be operated by the age of 1 year.

Treatment of the RET mutant cell lines TT, TPC-1, and MZ-CRC-1 with AST487, a RET kinase inhibitor, suppressed growth and showed profound and sustained inhibition of mTOR signaling, which was recapitulated by siRNA-mediated RET knockdown. Inhibition of mTOR with INK128, a dual mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinase inhibitor, also resulted in marked growth suppression to levels similar to those seen with RET blockade. Moreover, combined treatment with AST487 and INK128 at low concentrations suppressed growth and induced apoptosis.

The objective of this study was to assess the function of three germ line RET variants Arg886Trp, Ser649Leu, and Glu511Lys of undetermined pathogenic significance, which were found in three kindreds of isolated AS-MTC. For this purpose, we employed vectors expressing each of the RET variants and measured the number of NIH3T3 transformation foci and soft agar colonies, the degree of activation of known RET intracellular signaling targets (ERK1/2, STAT1, STAT3, and TCF4), and the extent of ERK1/2 inhibition on sorafenib treatment. We found that RET variants Arg886Trp and Glu511Lys have shown increased in vitro transforming potential in a glial-derived neurotrophic factor-dependent manner. In contrast, the Ser649Leu variant did not significantly increased the number of foci and agar colonies relative to wild-type RET (RET-WT). The variants Glu511Lys and Arg886Trp showed 10- and 12.5-fold ERK1/2 activation respectively, that was significantly higher than that observed for RET-WT (fivefold). Increased levels of STAT1 and TCF4 activation were only observed for RET Arg886Trp (2.5- and 3-fold versus 1.2- and 2-fold in RET-WT respectively).

A questionnaire was sent to all surgical departments in Germany and Austria. All of the patients who fulfilled the following criteria were enrolled: (1) preoperatively proved RET mutation; (2) age </= 20 years, (3) clinically asymptomatic thyroid C cell disease; and (4) TNM classification pT0-1/pNX/pN0-1/M0. Seventy-five patients were identified, and fifteen mutations were detected in six codons. Two adolescents had unilateral pheochromocytomas as part of the multiple endocrine neoplasia II (MEN-II) syndrome. No hyperparathyroidism was noted. All patients underwent total thyroidectomy, and 57 patients went on to have lymph node dissection. Parathyroid glands were removed in 34 patients and autografted in 11. Histopathology revealed MTC in 46 patients (61%, youngest 4 years); C cell hyperplasia (CCH) only was detected in the other 29 patients. Three patients had lymph node metastases (LNMs) the youngest being age 14 years. Calcitonin levels were not useful for differentiating between CCH and MTC, but in all patients with LNMs at least the stimulated calcitonin levels were assayed. After surgery, five patients (6.7%) sustained permanent hypoparathyroidism, and one patient (1.3%) had a permanent unilateral recurrent nerve palsy. All but three patients (96%) were biochemically cured. In conclusion, prophylactic total thyroidectomy can be performed safely in experienced centers. We recommend prophylactic total thyroidectomy at age 6. Cervicocentral lymph node dissection should be included when calcitonin levels are elevated or if patients are older than 10 years. Bilateral lymph node dissection should be performed if LNMs are suspected or when patients with elevated calcitonin are older than 15 years.",

All individuals with apparently sporadic MTC, but in whom there is some suspicion of familial disease, should also have RET genetic analysis. A negative DNA result practically excludes the possibility of hereditary MTC in families where an index case has been investigated and obviates the need for further biochemical evaluation. Disease gene carriers may be divided into three distinct risk groups depending on the specific RET gene mutation in the family. The age at which presymptomatic surgery has to be performed depends on the risk group to which the patient belongs. Compared with the results of DNA analysis, the results of CT stimulation tests have become less important in the assessment of timing of surgery. During follow-up of patients who underwent surgery, measurement of plasma basal CT is still useful. The high sensitivity of measuring stimulated CT levels does not outweigh the burden of life-long periodic stimulation tests and the limited clinical consequences of slightly elevated levels.

RET protein comprises an extracellular portion with four cadherine-like domains and a cysteine- rich region important for intermolecular interactions; a hydrophobic transmembrane domain; an intracellular part comprising the juxtamembrane domain with regulatory function and the catalytic domain that phosphorylates the tyrosine residues of substrates. RET is involved in the development of enteric nervous system and renal organogenesis during embryonic life. Mutations of RET are associated to a subset of colorectal cancer and are commonly found in hereditary and sporadic thyroid cancer. Activating point mutations in the cystein-rich or the kinase domain of RET cause multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), a group of familial cancer syndromes characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, parathyroid hyperplasia and ganglioneuromatosis of the gastroenteric mucosa. Rearranged forms of RET (termed RET/PTC) are detected in the majority of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC). At present, the therapeutic treatment available for these pathologies is the total or partial surgical removal of thyroid, associated with radio-iodine therapy or chemotherapy: despite widespread use of multimodality treatment, survival rates have not improved much in the past few decades, which suggests that new treatment options should be explored.

It is clinically characterized by the presence of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), bilateral pheochromocytoma and primary hyperparathyroidism (MEN2A) within a single patient. Three distinct clinical forms have been described depending on the phenotype: the classical MEN 2A, MEN 2B, an association of MTC, pheochromocytoma and mucosal neuroma, (FMTC) familial MTC with a low incidence of other endocrinopathies. Each variant of MEN2 results from different RET gene mutation, with a good genotype phenotype correlation. Genetic testing detects nearly 100% of mutation carriers and is considered the standard of care for all first degree relatives of patients with newly diagnosed MTC. Recommendations on the timing of prophylactic thyroidectomy and extent of surgery are based on a classification into four risk levels utilizing the genotype-phenotype correlations. MEN 2 gives a unique model for early prevention and cure of cancer and for stratified roles of mutation-based diagnosis of carriers.",

Presently, early total thyroidectomy provides real cure of MTC for cases in which molecular diagnosis has been performed at early ages. After RET mutation identification, family members should be screened for this mutation by using methods as DGGE, SSCP, restriction enzyme, genetic sequencing or mini-sequencing. In this paper, we briefly review our experience with the direct RET gene sequencing and DGGE approaches. In 50 typical MEN-2 patients analyzed using both methods, we found no false results suggesting that DGGE is a reliable screening method for RET proto-oncogene mutation analysis.",

The course of MTC is indolent, and survival rates depend on the tumor stage at diagnosis. The present article describes clinical evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of MTC.;The aim of the consensus described herein, which was elaborated by Brazilian experts and sponsored by the Thyroid Department of the Brazilian Society of Endocrinology and Metabolism, was to discuss the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of individuals with MTC in accordance with the latest evidence reported in the literature.;After clinical questions were elaborated, the available literature was initially surveyed for evidence in the MedLine-PubMed database, followed by the Embase and Scientific Electronic Library Online/Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Literature (SciELO/Lilacs) databases. The strength of evidence was assessed according to the Oxford classification of evidence levels, which is based on study design, and the best evidence available for each question was selected.;Eleven questions corresponded to MTC diagnosis, 8 corresponded to its surgical treatment, and 13 corresponded to follow-up, for a total of 32 recommendations. The present article discusses the clinical and molecular diagnosis, initial surgical treatment, and postoperative management of MTC, as well as the therapeutic options for metastatic disease.;MTC should be suspected in individuals who present with thyroid nodules and family histories of MTC, associations with pheochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism, and/or typical phenotypic characteristics such as ganglioneuromatosis and Marfanoid habitus. Fine-needle nodule aspiration, serum calcitonin measurements, and anatomical-pathological examinations are useful for diagnostic confirmation. Surgery represents the only curative therapeutic strategy. The therapeutic options for metastatic disease remain limited and are restricted to disease control. Judicious postoperative assessments that focus on the identification of residual or recurrent disease are of paramount importance when defining the follow-up and later therapeutic management strategies.",

The follow-up ranged from 2 to 18 yr.;GC operated on for elevated stimulated CT included 27 GC with a positive peak CT at the screening and four cases who became positive after 4 yr. All of them had intrathyroidal MTC and no node metastases; all were cured after a mean follow-up of 7.5 yr. Among those operated on for detectable basal CT, intrathyroidal tumors were found when CT was below 60 pg/ml, whereas either node metastases or larger tumors were observed when CT was above 60 pg/ml. No correlation among serum CT, age, and type of RET mutation was observed. Thirty GC were still biochemically negative at the annual control.;The time of thyroidectomy in GC with negative CT could be personalized and safely planned when stimulated CT becomes positive, independent of the type of RET mutation and patient's age. In this series, a basal CT below 60 pg/ml was always associated to an intrathyroidal localization of MTC.",

Here we present a comprehensive genetic and clinical analysis of MEN2 among Chinese families followed from 1975 to 2011. Our series comprises 36 index cases and 134 relatives from 11 independent families.;Genetic diagnosis was performed in all participants by direct sequencing all relevant RET exons. Thyroidectomy was performed in 50 patients with varying cervical neck dissection procedures. Patients with pheochromocytoma (PHEO) underwent specific surgery. Demographic, clinical profiles, mutation types, tumor histopathologic features, and follow-up records were systematically analyzed.;The RET mutations p.C634Y (n=34), p.C634R (n=6), p.C618S (n=13), p.V292M/R67H/R982C (n=7), p.L790F (n=2), and p.C634Y/V292M/R67H/R982C (n=1) were confirmed in 31 index cases and then identified in 32 at-risk relatives (mutation carriers), with MEN2A as the most common clinical subtype. The overall penetrance of PHEO in patients with MEN2A was 46.7%. A total of 50 patients underwent thyroidectomy, and there was a significant lowering of their mean age at thyroidectomy and the tumor diameter of the mutation carriers that were detected and operated on compared with the index cases (age at first surgery: 29.3 vs. 39.3 years, p<0.05; maximum size: 1.1 vs. 3.3 cm, p<0.001). There was also a decrease in the TNM staging and the proportion of patients who underwent inappropriate initial thyroid surgery (pN1: 31.6% vs. 100%, p<0.001; inappropriate surgery: 0% vs. 29%). Meanwhile, disease-free survival (DFS) increased (DFS: 100% vs. 58.1%, p<0.05). Both medullary thyroid carcinoma-specific (n=1) and PHEO-specific (n=5) deaths were reported during the study period.;Our results further substantiate that gene scanning of all relevant RET exons is a powerful tool in the management of MEN2 patients, especially in asymptomatic carriers, and has led to earlier diagnosis and more complete initial treatment of patients with MEN2 in China.",

The mTOR inhibitor everolimus has shown encouraging results in neuroendocrine tumors. As part of a prospective phase II study, we analyzed the safety and efficacy of everolimus in advanced MTC. Methods. Seven patients with per RECIST 1.1 documented advanced MTC were included and received everolimus 10 mg daily. The primary objective was determining treatment efficacy. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), toxicity, and pharmacokinetics (PK). Results. Median follow-up duration was 28 weeks (17-147). Five patients (71%) showed SD, of which 4 (57%) showed SD >24 weeks. Median PFS and OS were 33 (95%CI: 8-56) and 30 (95%CI: 15-45) weeks, respectively. Toxicity was predominantly grade 1/2 and included mucositis (43%), fatigue (43%), and hypertriglyceridemia (43%). Four MTCs harbored the somatic RET mutation c.2753T>C, p.Met918Thr. The best clinical response was seen in a MEN2A patient. PK characteristics were consistent with phase I data. One patient exhibited extensive toxicity accompanying elevated everolimus plasma concentrations. Conclusions. This study suggests that everolimus exerts clinically relevant antitumor activity in patients with advanced MTC. Given the high level of clinical benefit and the relatively low toxicity profile, further investigation of everolimus in these patients is warranted. ",

The MTC tumor cells secrete the polypeptide hormone calcitonin, which serves as an excellent tumor marker, useful for defining the presence of disease, preoperatively or following thyroidectomy. The discovery that mutations in the RET proto-oncogene are associated with MEN-II syndromes was highly significant in that it demonstrated a clear correlation between genotype and phenotype; and most importantly it provided a mechanism whereby family members at risk could be identified by direct DNA analysis. Virtually all patients with MEN-IIA, MEN-IIB, and FMTC develop MTC; therefore there is a clear rationale for performing thyroidectomy as soon as a RET mutation has been identified. Because MTC appears to be much more aggressive in patients with MEN-IIB, thyroidectomy is performed during the first year of life in this setting, whereas in patients with MEN-IIA, where the tumor appears to be more indolent, the procedure can be safety delayed until age 5 years. Reoperative neck exploration in patients with evidence of persistent or recurrent MTC has been effective in a significant number of patients, although the success of the operation requires careful patient selection and preoperative assessment. MTC, as expressed in the MEN-II syndromes, is an excellent model to evaluate the usefulness of interventional therapy in patients demonstrated to have a genetic predisposition for cancer.",

Multiple endocrine neoplasia IIa and IIb and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma are inherited conditions with autosomal dominance and incomplete penetrance. Traditionally, diagnosis and screening for these conditions have been done using pentagastrin stimulation tests and plasma calcitonin determinations. Recent genetic mapping, however, has assigned the genes responsible for these tumors to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 10. Available data suggest that mutations in exon 10, 11, or 16 of the RET proto-oncogene are responsible for MEN IIa and IIb and familial non-MEN medullary thyroid carcinoma. Thus, genetic testing can identify affected members of a kindred and will probably lead to early thyroidectomy and possible cure for gene carriers.;Early studies confirm the usefulness of DNA analysis in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with familial forms of medullary thyroid carcinoma.

        "Doc_abstract":"Four types of thyroid cancer comprise more than 98% of all thyroid malignancies. Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) may have a very benign course while undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma (UTC) belongs to the most aggressive human malignancies. A variety of genes have been identified to be involved in the pathogenesis of thyroid carcinoma. Somatic Ras mutations seem to be an early event and are frequently found in follicular thyroid carcinomas. Somatic rearrangements of RET and TRK are almost exclusively found in PTC and may be found in early stages. Germline RET missense mutations lead to hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). In contrast, the significance of somatic RET mutations in sporadic MTC is unknown. p53 seems to play a crucial role in the dedifferentiation process of thyroid carcinoma. The precise role of PTEN remains to be elucidated. The only clearly identified exogenous factor that may lead to thyroid carcinoma (mainly PTC) is radiation. Of interest, radiation is capable to induce RET rearrangements. In general, early diagnosis is mandatory to enable the chance of cure. Surgery is the treatment of choice. Depending on the tumour type, surgery in combination with either radioiodine, external radiation or chemotherapy often enables the control of local tumour burden. In MTC and UTC, once thyroid cancer is spread to distant organs, efficacious therapeutic agents are almost non-existing. However, our growing knowledge of genes involved in thyroidal oncogenesis may contribute to the development of more effective treatment modalities. Some preliminary data on gene therapy are quite promising.",

MEN2 has been reported in approximately 500 to 1000 families worldwide and the prevalence has been estimated at approximately 1:30,000. Two different forms, sporadic and familial, have been described for MEN2. Sporadic form is represented by a case with two of the principal MEN2-related endocrine tumors. The familial form, which is more frequent and with an autosomal pattern of inheritance, consists of a MEN2 case with at least one first degree relative showing one of the characteristic endocrine tumors. Familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) is a subtype of MEN2 in which the affected individuals develop only medullary thyroid carcinoma, without other clinical manifestations of MEN2. Predisposition to MEN2 is caused by germline activating mutations of the c-RET proto-oncogene on chromosome 10q11.2. The RET gene encodes a single-pass transmembrane tyrosine kinase that is the receptor for glial-derived neurotrophic growth factors. The combination of clinical and genetic investigations, together with the improved understanding of the molecular and clinical genetics of the syndrome, helps the diagnosis and treatment of patients. Currently, DNA testing makes possible the early detection of asymptomatic gene carriers, allowing to identify and treat the neoplastic lesions at an earlier stage. In particular, the identification of a strong genotype-phenotype correlation in MEN2 syndrome may enable a more individualized treatment for the patients, improving their quality of life. At present, surgical treatment offers the only chance of cure and therefore, early clinical and genetic detection and prophylactic surgery in subjects at risk are the main therapeutic goal.",

The age-related risk of MTC is associated with the type of RET mutation. Our aim was to identify prognostic factors associated with recurrent MTC in MEN 2 patients. METHODS In a nationwide case-control study, all patients who underwent total thyroidectomy in the Netherlands under the age of 20 years were classified into standard (1), high (2), or very high risk (3) for MTC based on RET-mutation type. Disease-free patients were compared with those with recurrent disease. RESULTS A total of 93 patients were included in the study. Sixty-six percent had MTC on histology, the youngest being 1 year old. Codon 634 was most affected. Sixteen (18%) patients had persistent or recurrent disease, one of whom died. Significantly associated determinants of outcome in univariate analysis were higher age at surgery, no age-appropriate prophylactic surgery according to risk level, elevated preoperative calcitonin levels, affected codon, and the presence of lymph node metastases at surgery. On multivariate analysis only age of surgery was the single independent factor associated with persistent disease. CONCLUSIONS Prophylactic thyroidectomy beyond the recommended age is associated with persistent/recurrent disease. In addition, codon 634 mutation is associated with a high risk of recurrence requiring early surgery for all these patients.",

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN-2) is an autosomal dominant syndrome caused by germline activating mutations of the RET proto-oncogene and has been categorized into three distinct clinical forms. MEN-2A is associated with MTC, bilateral pheochromocytoma, and primary hyperparathyroidism. MEN-2B is associated with MTC, bilateral pheochromocytoma, and mucosal neuromas. The rarest clinical form of MEN-2 is familial MTC (FMTC), which is also associated with MTC, but other endocrinopathies are characteristically not present. Each clinical form of MEN-2 results from a specific RET gene mutation, with a strong correlation of phenotype expression with regard to the onset and course of MTC and the presence of other endocrine tumors and a corresponding genotype. Recommendations for screening of RET mutations are necessary as their presence or absence will influence interventional strategies such as the timing of a prophylactic thyroidectomy and extent of surgery. Timing of screenings and development of interventional strategies are extremely important in caring for patients with certain RET mutations as evidence of metastatic MTC has been documented as early as 6 years of age. Interventional strategies should consider the risks of complications of these interventions based on certain characteristics of each individual case such as age of the patient, course of disease in affected family members, and the invasiveness of any proposed surgical procedure.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The RET kinase has emerged as a promising target for the therapy of medullary thyroid cancers (MTC) and of a subset of papillary thyroid cancers. NVP-AST487, a N,N'-diphenyl urea with an IC(50) of 0.88 mumol/L on RET kinase, inhibited RET autophosphorylation and activation of downstream effectors, and potently inhibited the growth of human thyroid cancer cell lines with activating mutations of RET but not of lines without RET mutations. NVP-AST487 induced a dose-dependent growth inhibition of xenografts of NIH3T3 cells expressing oncogenic RET, and of the MTC cell line TT in nude mice. MTCs secrete calcitonin, a useful indicator of tumor burden. Human plasma calcitonin levels derived from the TT cell xenografts were inhibited shortly after treatment, when tumor volume was still unchanged, indicating that the effects of RET kinase inhibition on calcitonin secretion were temporally dissociated from its tumor-inhibitory properties. Accordingly, NVP-AST487 inhibited calcitonin gene expression in vitro in TT cells, in part, through decreased gene transcription. These data point to a previously unknown physiologic role of RET signaling on calcitonin gene expression. Indeed, the RET ligands persephin and GDNF robustly stimulated calcitonin mRNA, which was blocked by pretreatment with NVP-AST487. Antagonists of RET kinase activity in patients with MTC may result in effects on plasma calcitonin that are either disproportionate or dissociated from the effects on tumor burden, because RET kinase mediates a physiologic pathway controlling calcitonin secretion. The role of traditional tumor biomarkers may need to be reassessed as targeted therapies designed against oncoproteins with key roles in pathogenesis are implemented.",

As a delayed diagnosis and an inadequate initial treatment may severely affect the prognosis of this thyroid malignancy, the appropriate use and the correct interpretation of the available diagnostic tools for MTC are of crucial importance. The purpose of the present article is to provide an easy-to-use guide reviewing the main issues of MTC diagnosis: (1) basal serum calcitonin; (2) stimulated serum calcitonin; (3) additional serum markers for MTC; (4) ultrasound and other imaging techniques; (5) fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology; (6) calcitonin measurement on FNA washout; (7) rearranged during transfection (RET) mutations; and (8) scope of the problem.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The thyroid parafollicular cell, or commonly named \"C-cell,\" functions in serum calcium homeostasis. Elevations in serum calcium trigger release of calcitonin from the C-cell, which in turn functions to inhibit absorption of calcium by the intestine, resorption of bone by the osteoclast, and reabsorption of calcium by renal tubular cells. Oncogenic transformation of the thyroid C-cell is thought to progress through a hyperplastic process prior to malignancy with increasing levels of serum calcitonin serving as a biomarker for tumor burden. The discovery that multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 is caused by activating mutations of the RET gene serves to highlight the RET-RAS-MAPK signaling pathway in both initiation and progression of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Thyroid C-cells are known to express RET at high levels relative to most cell types; therefore, aberrant activation of this receptor is targeted primarily to the C-cell, providing one possible cause of tissue-specific oncogenesis. The role of RET signaling in normal C-cell function is unknown though calcitonin gene transcription appears to be sensitive to RET activation. Beyond RET, the modeling of oncogenesis in animals and screening of human tumors for candidate gene mutations have uncovered mutation of RAS family members and inactivation of Rb1 regulatory pathway as potential mediators of C-cell transformation. A growing understanding of how RET interacts with these pathways, both in normal C-cell function and during oncogenic transformation, will help in the development of novel molecular-targeted therapies.

The heat shock protein (HSP) 90 chaperone is required for folding and stability of RET mutants. HSP90 is a molecular target for the HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir (NFV).;We hypothesized that treatment with NFV may lead to the inhibition of RET signaling and induction of apoptosis in MTC cells.;Two human MTC cell lines, TT and MZ-CRC-1, which harbor endogenous C634W or M918T RET mutations, respectively, were exposed to clinically achievable concentrations of NFV. JC-1 staining and caspase-3 cleavage assays were performed to measure mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis. Activation of RET signaling was examined by Western blot. Autophagy was monitored by the detection of the light-chain 3BII. Expression of HSP90 and LC3B were examined in 36 human MTCs.;At a therapeutic serum concentration (10 μM), NFV inhibited the viability of TT and MZ-CRC-1 cells by 55% and 10%, respectively. In a dose-dependent manner, NFV inhibited cyclin D1 and caused caspase-3 cleavage. NFV decreased the level of RET protein and blocked the activation of RET downstream targets (phosphorylated ERK, phosphorylated AKT, and p70S6K/pS6). NFV induced metabolic stress, activated AMP-activated protein kinase and increased autophagic flux. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy (chloroquine) augmented NFV-inducible cytotoxicity, suggesting that autophagy was protective in NFV-treated cells. NFV led to mitochondrial membrane depolarization and induced both oxidative stress and DNA damage. An antioxidant (n-acetylcysteine) attenuated DNA damage and prevented NFV-inducible apoptosis. HSP90 overexpression was found in 17 of 36 human MTCs and correlated with metastases and RET mutations. LC3B was detected in 20 of 36 human MTCs.;NFV has a wide spectrum of activity against MTC cells, and its cytotoxicity can be augmented by inhibiting autophagy. Expression of NFV molecular targets in metastatic MTC suggests that NFV has a potential to become a thyroid cancer therapeutic agent.",

In the last decade, small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have been introduced in the field of thyroid cancer, after having been shown effective in a wide variety of other tumors. This review focuses on vandetanib (ZD6474, Zactima™; AstraZeneca) and its role in the treatment of MTC. Vandetanib is an oral TKI that targets VEGF receptors 2 and 3, RET, and at higher concentrations, the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. This drug has been tested in two important phase II studies which demonstrated that both the 100 and 300 mg/day dosage of vandetanib have antitumor activity on advanced MTC. A phase III trial (ZETA trial) evaluating vandetanib in 331 patients with locally advanced or metastatic MTC showed a significant prolongation of PFS for patients receiving vandetanib compared with placebo. Toxicity surveillance in all studies reported high rates of adverse effects with diarrhea, rash, fatigue and nausea being the most commonly experienced by patients. Vandetanib is currently approved in the United States for unresectable locally advanced or metastatic MTC and has become a new standard of care in this rare and indolent pathology.",

A small percentage of such patients, however, do not undergo remission and need new therapeutic approaches. Both anaplastic and medullary thyroid carcinomas exhibit aggressive behavior and are usually resistant to current therapeutic modalities. Thyroid carcinoma represents a fascinating model and a particularly promising paradigm for targeted therapy because some of the key oncogenic events are activating mutations of genes coding for tyrosine kinases, and these occur early in cancer development. A prototype is the RET proto-oncogene, a receptor tyrosine kinase, which is a key regulator of development and a 'hotspot' for oncogenic mutations. Mutations in the RET proto-oncogene have been identified as causative for papillary carcinoma and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma, making it an attractive target for selective inhibition in these subtypes. ZD 6474 has shown promising activity in preclinical models against RET kinase, and its contemporary inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor and epidermal growth factor pathways renders it a very attractive drug for clinical trials in thyroid cancer. Activating point mutation of B-RAF can occur early in the development of papillary carcinoma. Moreover, papillary carcinomas with these mutations have more aggressive properties and are diagnosed more often at an advanced stage. Clinical evaluation of B-RAF-targeting drugs is undergoing and trials in thyroid cancer are planned. Agents that restore radioiodine uptake, such as histone deacetylase inhibitors and retinoids, represent another exciting field in new drug development in thyroid cancer.",

However, germline mutations may very occasionally occur in other exons, including exon 14 of the RET gene. Interestingly, an increased frequency of a rare germline sequence variant of the RET exon 14, S836S, has been detected in patients with sporadic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), and this variant has been proposed to play a role in the genesis of MTC and, perhaps, FMTC. In this study we report the segregation of a germline V804L mutation and a germline sequence variant S836S in exon 14 of the RET gene in an extended Hungarian FMTC kindred comprising 80 individuals of four generations. Molecular analysis of the RET gene was performed by direct DNA sequencing in 23 family members, of whom 12 had the V804L mutation, three had the V804L mutation and S836S polymorphism in separate alleles, and six had the S836S polymorphism, all in heterozygous forms. Two of the family members had neither mutation nor polymorphism of the RET gene. Three of the family members who had the V804L mutation and one member who could not be tested for mutation were operated for non-metastatic MTC, while one member with MTC who had the V804L mutation refused surgery. In all patients affected with MTC, the disease developed relatively late in life and never caused death. None of the other family members carrying the V804L mutation and/or the S836S polymorphism had clinical or biochemical evidence of MTC. These observations suggest that the co-existence of the V804L mutation and S836S polymorphism in separate alleles does not seem to aggravate the relatively low-risk disease phenotype characteristic in most patients with codon 804 mutations of the RET exon 14.",

This approach is often successful in early disease; however, treatment options for advanced endocrine malignancies remain unsatisfactory and prognosis is poor. In particular, cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation therapy often show only limited and transient efficacy and are associated with significant toxicity. Thus, new treatment options are urgently needed. Advances in the understanding of the molecular pathology of endocrine malignancies has recently led to identification of key events in endocrine oncogenesis (e.g. oncogenic RET mutations in medullary thyroid carcinoma or RET/PTC rearrangements in papillary thyroid carcinoma). These new insights are increasingly matched by new compounds (e.g. tyrosine kinase inhibitors) targeting signaling pathways essential for tumor cell survival, proliferation and metastases. Accordingly, a rapidly growing number of preclinical investigations and early clinical trials in endocrine malignancies have been initiated. First results of \"targeted therapies\" in medullary and differentiated thyroid carcinoma are impressive: phase II trials targeting RET or VEGF receptor kinases led to objective tumor response in up to 50% of patients.

The pathologic findings were: MTC in four (metastasized in one); CCH in three and parathyroid hyperplasia in one.;Phenotypic penetration of RET mutation was 100% for MTC/CCH, but only 57% of the gene carriers had Pheo. Genetic screening allowed early prophylactic treatment in four out of seven patients; pathologic findings revealed several evolutionary stages of the disease. Patients not yet showing Pheo are under close clinical and laboratory surveillance.",

Most are caused by mutations in tumor suppressor genes. In HCS, a single copy of the mutated tumor suppressor gene is inherited, and mutation of the second wild type allele of the gene is required for tumorigenesis. Patients with HCS have a higher than normal risk of a second malignancy. Management strategies to address increased cancer risk in HCS include genetic counseling and testing, targeted surveillance, chemoprevention, and prophylactic surgery. Genetic testing for high-risk family members is strongly recommended. Available data indicate surgical prophylaxis is more successful than surveillance in reducing cancer risk in carriers of BRCA, CDH1, APC, and RET mutation.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) is characterized by the occurrence of tumors involving two or more endocrine glands within a single patient. Four major forms of MEN, which are autosomal dominant disorders, are recognized and referred to as: MEN type 1 (MEN1), due to menin mutations; MEN2 (previously MEN2A) due to mutations of a tyrosine kinase receptor encoded by the rearranged during transfection (RET) protoncogene; MEN3 (previously MEN2B) due to RET mutations; and MEN4 due to cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDNK1B) mutations. Each MEN type is associated with the occurrence of specific tumors. Thus, MEN1 is characterized by the occurrence of parathyroid, pancreatic islet and anterior pituitary tumors; MEN2 is characterized by the occurrence of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) in association with phaeochromocytoma and parathyroid tumors; MEN3 is characterized by the occurrence of MTC and phaeochromocytoma in association with a marfanoid habitus, mucosal neuromas, medullated corneal fibers and intestinal autonomic ganglion dysfunction, leading to megacolon; and MEN4, which is also referred to as MENX, is characterized by the occurrence of parathyroid and anterior pituitary tumors in possible association with tumors of the adrenals, kidneys, and reproductive organs. This review will focus on the clinical and molecular details of the MEN1 and MEN4 syndromes. The gene causing MEN1 is located on chromosome 11q13, and encodes a 610 amino-acid protein, menin, which has functions in cell division, genome stability, and transcription regulation. Menin, which acts as scaffold protein, may increase or decrease gene expression by epigenetic regulation of gene expression via histone methylation. Thus, menin by forming a subunit of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) complexes that trimethylate histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4), facilitates activation of transcriptional activity in target genes such as cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors; and by interacting with the suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog family protein (SUV39H1) to mediate H3K methylation, thereby silencing transcriptional activity of target genes. MEN1-associated tumors harbor germline and somatic mutations, consistent with Knudson's two-hit hypothesis. Genetic diagnosis to identify individuals with germline MEN1 mutations has facilitated appropriate targeting of clinical, biochemical and radiological screening for this high risk group of patients for whom earlier implementation of treatments can then be considered. MEN4 is caused by heterozygous mutations of CDNK1B which encodes the 196 amino-acid CDK1 p27Kip1, which is activated by H3K4 methylation. ",

Subtypes of MEN 2 include MEN 2A, MEN 2B and familial MTC (FMTC) which differ in pattern of additional lesions or--in FMTC--lack of pheochromocytoma. In 2009, after extensive review of the literature, the guidelines of the American Thyroid Association made several recommendations regarding clinical and genetic diagnostic testing and treatment options. In this article, the recently published literature is reviewed and concerns regarding future perspectives are added. In particular, a critical handling of rare DNA variants and double mutations is necessary. Up to now, mutation-specific risk profiles and mutation-associated treatment recommendations are unavailable. We emphasise the need for approved centres for treatment of patients affected by MEN 2, not only adults but young children as well. As a high level of skill is required for endoscopic adrenal-sparing surgery, surgeons should declare their expertise before operating such patients.

The evaluation and management of MEN2-related tumours is often different from that of sporadic counterparts. This review article provides an overview of clinical manifestations, diagnosis and surgical management of MEN2 patients. This review also presents applications of the most up-to-date imaging modalities to MEN2 patients that are tightly linked to the clinical management and aims to guide physicians towards a rationale for the use of imaging prior to prophylactic thyroidectomy, initial surgery and reoperations for persistent/recurrent disease. This review also concludes that, in the near future, it is expected that these patients will indeed benefit from newly developed positron emission tomography approaches which will target peptide receptors and protein kinases. Identification of MEN2-specific radiopharmaceuticals will also soon arise from molecular profiling studies. Furthermore, subtotal (cortical-sparing) adrenalectomy, which is a valid option in MEN2 for avoiding long-term steroid replacement, will benefit from an accurate estimation through imaging of differential adrenocortical function.

Ultrasonography (US) and US-guided biopsy remain cornerstones in the initial workup of thyroid cancer. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment, with radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy reserved for differentiated subtypes. Posttreatment surveillance of thyroid cancer is done with US of the thyroid bed as well as monitoring of tumor markers such as serum thyroglobulin and serum calcitonin. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, and fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT are used in the follow-up of patients with negative iodine 131 imaging and elevated tumor markers. Certain mutations, such as mutations of BRAF in papillary thyroid carcinoma and mutations in RET codons 883, 918, and 928, are associated with an aggressive course in medullary thyroid carcinoma, and affected patients need close surveillance. Treatment options for metastatic RAI-refractory thyroid cancer are limited. Currently, Food and Drug Administration-approved molecularly targeted therapies for metastatic RAI-refractory thyroid cancer, including sorafenib, lenvatinib, vandetanib, and cabozantinib, target the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and RET kinases. Imaging plays an important role in assessment of response to these therapies, which can be atypical owing to antiangiogenic effects. A wide spectrum of toxic effects is associated with the molecularly targeted therapies used in thyroid cancer and can be detected at restaging scans. (©)RSNA, 2016. ",

Prophylactic thyroidectomy is the treatment of choice for patients with RET gene mutations. The age at which patients undergo prophylactic thyroidectomy may vary depending on the position of the RET gene codon. In cases of MEN 2B, when the mutation is carried in codons 883, 918 or 922, prophylactic thyroidectomy is performed prior to 6 months of age, due to the increased aggressiveness of these heterozygosities, which are capable of determining the onset of medullary cancer during the first months of life. We present two heterozygous twin patients with MEN 2B syndrome who were born 32 weeks premature, and who underwent prophylactic thyroidectomy at 7 months of age. The patients were carriers of the mutation at codon 918. We suggested the early surgery at 7 months as, due to their prematurity, the patients were required to gain weight to improve their condition prior to surgery. The two patients had medullary thyroid carcinoma without lymph node involvement. In conclusion, for a truly prophylactic thyroidectomy, such patients should undergo surgery within the first month of life, particularly if these patients are carriers of the mutation in codons 883, 918 or 922.",

This review discusses promising recent clinical trials data for multikinase inhibitors including motesanib, vandetanib, sunitinib, sorafenib, and cabozantinib/XL184. Across multiple studies reported to date, RET mutations, although prevalent in these subjects, have not proven so far to predict whether patients will respond to multikinase inhibitors.

Cytologic evaluation facilitates the diagnosis of thyroid lesions (TLs), but in 10-40% of cases the interpretation is indeterminate. Patients with indeterminate diagnoses are often treated with hemithyroidectomy followed by completion thyroidectomy, if cancer is found in the initial specimen. Exposing patients to multiple surgeries increases costs and morbidity. The American Thyroid Association states that a combination of molecular markers is likely to optimize the management of patients with indeterminate cytology. However, few studies have addressed the molecular alterations present in pediatric TL. Twenty-seven thyroid carcinomas from patients 10 to 19 years of age were tested for alterations common in adult TL, including BRAF V600E mutation, RET fusions, and TERT promoter mutations. Mutation-negative cases were subsequently analyzed with a next-generation sequencing (NGS) mutation panel to search for additional targets. Histologic diagnoses included 12 classic papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs), 13 follicular variant PTCs, 1 medullary thyroid carcinoma, and 1 follicular carcinoma. Fourteen cases showed lymph node involvement, and 13 cases demonstrated lymphovascular invasion. The BRAF V600E mutation was detected in 10/27 cases, and RET fusions were detected in 6/27 cases. No TERT promoter mutations were identified in any of the cases. The NGS panel revealed additional RET and CTNNB1 pathogenic missense mutations. Our results demonstrate that molecular abnormalities are common in pediatric TLs and suggest that incorporation of molecular testing will be helpful in optimizing patient management. ",

The shift toward earlier thyroidectomy has resulted in significantly less medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC)-related morbidity and mortality. However, very young pediatric patients might have a higher morbidity rate compared with older patients. Hardly any literature exists on complications in the very young. A retrospective single-center analysis was performed on the outcomes of MEN2 patients undergoing a prophylactic total thyroidectomy at the age of 17 or younger. Forty-one MEN2A and 3 MEN2B patients with thyroidectomy after January 1993 and at least 6 months of follow-up were included, subdivided in 9 patients younger than 3 years, 15 patients 3 to 6 years, and 20 patients older than 6 years. Postoperative hypocalcemia and other complications were registered. Twelve (27%) patients developed transient hypocalcemia and 9 (20%) patients suffered from permanent hypocalcemia, with a nonsignificant trend toward higher incidence with decreasing age. Three (7%) patients had other complications, of whom 2 were younger than 3 years. For patients younger than 3 years, the average length of stay (LOS) was 6.7 days, versus 1.7 and 3.5 days, respectively, for the older patient groups (P < 0.05). Patients with complications had a longer LOS compared with patients without (5.0 vs 2.0, P < 0.01). None of the patients had clinical signs of recurrent MTC after a mean follow-up of 10.5 years. Prophylactic thyroidectomy in very young children is associated with a higher rate of complications, causing a significant increased LOS. Irrespective age of surgery, MTC did not recur in any patient. In planning optimal timing of surgery, clinicians should take the risk of complications into account. We advise not to perform total thyroidectomy before the age of 3 for patients defined high risk by the American Thyroid Association guideline.",

One case of persistent left recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis was observed (1.1%) despite intraoperative recurrent laryngeal nerve monitoring. Eight cases of immediate postoperative hypocalcaemia were observed (23.5% of the 34 total thyroidectomies) and permanent hypocalcaemia was observed in 5 cases (14.7%) with a significantly lower immediate postoperative serum calcium than in the case of transient hypocalcaemia (P=0.035).

Many possible causes of multiple malignancies have been reported such as genetic alterations, exposure to anti-cancer chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunosuppressive therapy and reduced immunologic response. We report a female patient with multiple sclerosis and quadruple cancers of different embryological origin. Patient was diagnosed with stage III (T3, N1a, MO) medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), multicentric micropapillary thyroid carcinoma, scapular and lumbar melanomas (Clark II, Breslow II), and lobular invasive breast carcinoma (T1a, NO, MO). All tumors present in our patient except micropapillary thyroid carcinomas were investigated for gene alterations known to have a key role in cancer promotion and progression. Tumor samples were screened for the p16 alterations (loss of heterozygosity and homozygous deletions), loss of heterozygosity of PTEN, p53 alterations (mutational status and loss of heterozygosity) and mutational status of RET, HRAS and KRAS. Each type of tumor investigated had specific pattern of analyzed genetic alterations. The most prominent genetic changes were mutual alterations in PTEN and p53 tumor suppressors present in breast cancer and two melanomas. These co-alterations could be crucial for promoting development of multiple malignancies. Moreover the insertion in 4(th) codon of HRAS gene was common for all tumor types investigated. It represents frameshift mutation introducing stop codon at position 5 which prevents synthesis of a full-length protein. Since the inactivated RAS enhances sensitivity to tamoxifen and radiotherapy this genetic alteration could be considered as a good prognostic factor for this patient. ",

Although this disorder is classified as a rare disease, the patients affected have a low life quality and a very expensive and continuous treatment. At present, MEN2A is diagnosed by gene sequencing after birth, thus trying to start an early treatment and by reduction of morbidity and mortality. We first evaluated the presence of MEN2A mutation (C634Y) in serum of 25 patients, previously diagnosed by sequencing in peripheral blood leucocytes, using HRM genotyping analysis. In a second step, we used a COLD-PCR approach followed by HRM genotyping analysis for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of a pregnant woman carrying a fetus with a C634Y mutation. HRM analysis revealed differences in melting curve shapes that correlated with patients diagnosed for MEN2A by gene sequencing analysis with 100% accuracy. Moreover, the pregnant woman carrying the fetus with the C634Y mutation revealed a melting curve shape in agreement with the positive controls in the COLD-PCR study. The mutation was confirmed by sequencing of the COLD-PCR amplification product. In conclusion, we have established a HRM analysis in serum samples as a new primary diagnosis method suitable for the detection of C634Y mutations in MEN2A patients. Simultaneously, we have applied the increase of sensitivity of COLD-PCR assay approach combined with HRM analysis for the non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of C634Y fetal mutations using pregnant women serum.",

While such tyrosine kinase inhibitors, particularly those affecting RET activity such as vandetanib, sorafenib and sunitinib, are promising, the low rate of partial responses and absence of complete responses in all of the various trials of monotherapy emphasize the need for new and more effective single agents or combinations of therapeutic agents with acceptable toxicity.",

MEN-2A, MEN-2B, and familial medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) comprise the MEN-2 syndrome. A germline mutation in the RET proto-oncogene is responsible for the MEN-2 syndrome. Recent data indicate that in 99% of MEN-2 cases, a germline RET mutation can be identified by genetic testing. The phenotypic variation of MEN-2 is diverse and partly related to the codon and specific point mutation in the RET proto-oncogene. There are increasing data on the genotype-phenotype correlations in patients with MEN-2 and this information should be used for screening at-risk patients and treatment of RET mutation carriers. All patients (especially if young) with MTC or bilateral pheochromocytoma should have a careful family history taken and genetic screening for RET germline mutations. Patients who are RET germline mutation carriers but without clinical or biochemical evidence of MTC should have a prophylactic total thyroidectomy. The optimal age of thyroidectomy should be based on the RET genotype (eg, high-risk mutations within the first year of life, intermediate-risk mutations by 5 years of age, and low-risk mutations by 10 years of age). Patients who are diagnosed with clinical or biochemical evidence of MTC should have a total or a near total thyroidectomy and at least a central neck lymph node dissection. Patients who have pheochromocytoma and a unilateral adrenal tumor on a localizing study should have a unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy after preoperative alpha-blockade. However, patients with bilateral adrenal tumors on localizing studies should have bilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy. A cortical-sparing (subtotal) adrenalectomy may be considered, if technically feasible, to avoid long-term steroid dependence and to reduce the risk of Addisonian crisis. Patients with biochemical evidence of primary hyperparathyroidism should have a bilateral neck exploration and total parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation (30-60 mg of the most normal parathyroid tissue) to the nondominant forearm if asymmetric parathyroid hyperplasia is present. Rarely, patients may have only single-gland disease and excision may be performed if the other parathyroid glands are not found with biopsy to be hyperplastic. All unresected parathyroid glands should be marked with a clip because patients with MEN-2A have a high risk of persistent and recurrent primary hyperparathyroidism. Patients with familial MTC may have not manifested the other features of MEN-2A, thus these patients should have continued follow-up for pheochromocytoma and primary hyperparathyroidism.",

The use of these multikinase inhibitors are supported by the observed overactivation of the RET oncoprotein in a large subpopulation of MTCs.

Hence, there is still a need for comprehensive molecular characterization of MTC utilizing whole-genome and transcriptome-sequencing methodologies with the aim of identifying targetable mutations.

The clinical course is notable for an inability to localize the source of hemorrhage during an initial damage control laparotomy that stabilized the patient sufficiently to allow emergent transfer to our facility, re-exploration for continued hemorrhage and abdominal compartment syndrome, and ultimately angiographic embolization of the left adrenal artery for control of the bleeding. Following recovery from his critical illness and appropriate medical management for pheochromocytoma, he returned for interval bilateral adrenal gland resection, from which his recovery was unremarkable. Our review of the literature highlights the high mortality associated with the undertaking of an operative intervention in the face of an unrecognized functional pheochromocytoma.

        "Doc_abstract":"Surgery has been the treatment of choice for many disorders of the thyroid gland, both benign and malignant, for many decades. However, surgery has not been invariable but has continued to change in accordance with research results. In benign cases, surgery has generally evolved to be as organ preserving as possible. In several instances, however, a more radical extent of resection seems justified in order to ensure that the risk of recurrence is as low as possible. For instance, total thyroidectomy may be beneficial in patients with endemic multinodular goitre or young patients with Graves' disease and accompanying cold nodules or high levels of autoantibodies. Several tools, e.g. magnifying glasses, bipolar coagulation forceps and neuromonitoring, are available to identify and preserve the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the parathyroid glands, hence keeping the morbidity at a low level. Most recently, minimally invasive surgery has been successfully used in treating both benign and malignant disorders of the thyroid gland. In the case of malignant disorders, minimally invasive surgery may become an attractive alternative to open surgery if a limited surgical extent is justified, e.g. in patients with micro-PTC (papillary thyroid carcinoma, diameter less than 1 cm). Whether a limited surgical approach is also justified in other cases, e.g. in any patient with intrathyroidal PTC or patients with micro-FTC (follicular thyroid carcinoma), remains to be shown and is the subject of ongoing investigations. One of the most intriguing recent discoveries is the identification of genotype-phenotype correlations in patients with hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma. In these patients, the timing and extent of surgery may depend not only on the patient's age and serum levels of the tumour marker calcitonin but also on the specific germline RET proto-oncogene mutation. Surgery will certainly continue to play an important role in the treatment of thyroid diseases and may be increasingly based on individual findings instead of general recommendations.",

Complete total thyroidectomy is the treatment of choice for PTC, FTC, and MTC. Radioiodine is routinely recommended in high-risk patients and considered in intermediate risk DTC patients. DTC cancer cells, during tumor progression, may lose the iodide uptake ability, becoming resistant to radioiodine, with a significant worsening of the prognosis. The lack of specific and effective drugs for aggressive and metastatic DTC and MTC leads to additional efforts toward the development of new drugs. Several genetic alterations in different molecular pathways in TC have been shown in the past few decades, associated with TC development and progression. Rearranged during transfection (RET)/PTC gene rearrangements, RET mutations, BRAF mutations, RAS mutations, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 angiogenesis pathways are some of the known pathways determinant in the development of TC. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are small organic compounds inhibiting tyrosine kinases auto-phosphorylation and activation, most of them are multikinase inhibitors. TKIs act on the aforementioned molecular pathways involved in growth, angiogenesis, local, and distant spread of TC. TKIs are emerging as new therapies of aggressive TC, including DTC, MTC, and anaplastic thyroid cancer, being capable of inducing clinical responses and stabilization of disease. Vandetanib and cabozantinib have been approved for the treatment of MTC, while sorafenib and lenvatinib for DTC refractory to radioiodine. These drugs prolong median progression-free survival, but until now no significant increase has been observed on overall survival; side effects are common.

When no mutation is observed, a linkage analysis study may be proposed. (2) In the subjects at risk, early screening for the various types of endocrine lesions may then start in childhood and be performed using specific biological markers of MTC, pheochromocytoma and primary hyperparathyroidism, and particularly, basal and pentagastrin-stimulated calcitonin measurement, which is known to be the most sensitive marker for the monitoring of MTC.

Recent advances in better understanding the pathogenesis and altered signaling pathways-especially in medullary and differentiated thyroid cancers (MTCs and DTCs)-have begun to change this situation substantially. Vandetanib, an orally bioavailable inhibitor of the RET kinase that is constitutively activated in MTC, has now been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in progressive and symptomatic metastatic MTC; it has been shown to delay time to progression relative to placebo in a randomized phase III trial. Further, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGF-R) inhibitory agents including sorafenib, sunitinib, pazopanib, and axitinib that are already approved in the United States for use in advanced renal cell carcinoma have shown high response rates in treating advanced DTCs in multiple phase II trials, and have become commonly used in progressive radioiodine-refractory metastatic DTC. Yet additional agents are now in development, with several including XL184 (cabozantinib) also showing promise in DTC and MTC. In anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), progress has been slower, with the greatest apparent gains resulting more from the application of systemic therapies earlier in the disease course, especially when used in conjunction with initial surgical and radiation therapies.

This was confirmed in a surgical series of 58 patients (34 with preoperatively normal and 24 with elevated serum calcitonin) where no calcitonin-positive cells were demonstrable immunohistochemically within separately investigated isthmi. Consequently, isthmus-preserving total bilateral lobectomy (IPTB) may be regarded as an adequate surgical procedure for C-cell hyperplasia (CCH).;IPTB was performed from October 2001 to December 2004 in 64 patients, 59 patients with nodular goiter and slightly to moderately elevated serum calcitonin (stimulated under 500 pg/ml) (group A, apparently sporadic cases) and in 5 patients undergoing prophylactic surgery for hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) with intermediate- or low-risk RET mutations (non-634) (group B). The surgical procedure focused on meticulous total extracapsular resection of both thyroid lobes, preservation of an isthmus remnant of about 3 ml (smaller in children), and histologic workup of the border zones of resection in addition to that of the completely removed lobes. When malignancy could be proven intraoperatively (7 patients) or when the isthmus turned out to contain nodular lesions (4 patients), completion total thyroidectomy (plus lymphadenectomy) was performed as a one-stage procedure. Second-stage total thyroidectomy was performed in 3 cases. Thus, IPTB was the definitive surgical procedure in 50 patients (45 of group A and all 5 of group B).;In all of the 50 definite IPTB cases, postoperative serum calcitonin was below the measurable limit (2 pg/ml); stimulated calcitonin was below the measurable limit in 47 (including all of group B) and was measurable in 3 sporadic cases in a lower-normal range between 2.4 and 3.5 pg/ml. Genetic screening of the apparently sporadic cases with CCH was positive in one (codon 791). The risk of recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis seems not to be elevated (0% permanent); permanent hypocalcemia occurred in 1 patient (2%). Follow-up data of 37 patients, median 18 (6-36) months, showed continuously nonmeasurable serum calcitonin with one exception, where it was in the normal range after 18 months. All IPTB patients are still under substitution therapy with L-thyroxine (median 125 mug/day) with decreasing tendency in all 3 children after prophylactic operation, the latter also showing an increasing volume of well-vascularized isthmi (from 1.5 to 2.5 ml).;IPTB reliably removes all C cells. There may not be need for total thyroidectomy (TTx) in cases with CCH. When necessary, completion TTx can be performed easily without additional risk. IPTB leaves a functionally relevant remnant, corresponding to that of a subtotal resection. This might be of importance especially for prophylactic surgery in children where the isthmus can compensate for the loss of thyroid function with time.",

We evaluated mutation-based risk levels in combination with 2009 ATA guidelines for resection.;Overall, 54 patients underwent PrThy between 1972 and 2009. The median age at PrThy was 11.5 years (range, 2-68). Only 4 patients (8%) underwent PrThy prior to age 5 years. Most patients with MTC (16/22, 73%) had a level C mutation, and the youngest age of MTC in a level C mutation carrier was 5 years. The youngest age of MTC in level A or B carriers was 15 years. The single factor that predicted an overall decreased risk of MTC at the time of PrThy was meeting all ATA mutation-based postponement guidelines for surgical intervention (P = .04).;ATA guidelines that includes risk assessment of RET mutation are important in predicting the presence of MTC in patients who are candidates for prophylactic thyroidectomy and in determining the timing of operative resection.",

We studied the sensitivity of an MTC cell line and xenograft to irinotecan, alone and in combination with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, CEP-751.;In TT cell culture and xenografts, irinotecan treatment was highly effective. This effect was augmented by treatment with CEP-751. Treatment of TT cell xenografts resulted in durable complete remission in 100% of the mice, with median time to recurrence of 70 d for irinotecan alone and more than 130 d for irinotecan plus CEP-751. Although irinotecan induced an S phase checkpoint arrest in TT cells, CEP-751 in combination with irinotecan resulted in a loss of this arrest. CEP-751 induced a loss in the induction of the DNA repair program marked by phospho-H2AX and the checkpoint pathway marked by the activated Chk1 pathway.;Irinotecan treatment was highly effective in a preclinical model of human MTC, resulting in complete remission in 100% of the xenografts treated.

Patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics were recorded, and variables predictive of CSM were identified by univariable analyses. A multivariable competing risk model was then built to predict the 10-year cancer specific mortality of MTC. All predictors of interest were added in the starting full model before selection, including age, gender, pre- and postoperative serum calcitonin, pre- and postoperative CEA, RET mutation status, perivascular invasion, margin status, pathologic T status, pathologic N status, and M status.

To explore genetic profiles of MTCs, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues from MTC patients were assayed on the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel v2. Eighty-four sporadic MTC samples and 36 paired normal thyroid tissues were successfully sequenced. We discovered 101 hotspot mutations in 18 genes in the 84 MTC tissue samples. The most common mutation was in the ret proto-oncogene, which occurred in 47 cases followed by mutations in genes encoding Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (N = 14), serine/threonine kinase 11 (N = 11), v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (N = 6), mutL homolog 1 (N = 4), Kiesten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (N = 3) and MET proto-oncogene (N = 3). We also evaluated anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement by immunohistochemistry and break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Two of 98 screened cases were positive for ALK FISH. To identify the genomic breakpoint and 5' fusion partner of ALK, customized targeted cancer panel sequencing was performed using DNA from tumor samples of the two patients. Glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 (GFPT1)-ALK and echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK fusions were identified. Additional PCR analysis, followed by Sanger sequencing, confirmed the GFPT1-ALK fusion, indicating that the fusion is a result of intra-chromosomal translocation or deletion. Notably, a metastatic MTC case harboring the EML4-ALK fusion showed a dramatic response to an ALK inhibitor, crizotinib. In conclusion, we found several genetic mutations in MTC and are the first to identify ALK fusions in MTC. Our results suggest that the EML4-ALK fusion in MTC may be a potential driver mutation and a valid target of ALK inhibitors. Furthermore, the GFPT1-ALK fusion may be a potential candidate for molecular target therapy. ",

Serious morbidity and mortality rates associated with these tumors are related to the potent effects of catecholamines on various organs, especially those of the cardiovascular system. Before any surgical procedure is done, preoperative blockade is necessary to protect the patient against significant release of catecholamines due to anesthesia and surgical manipulation of the tumor. Treatment options vary with the extent of the disease, with laparoscopic surgery being the preferred treatment for removal of primary tumors. Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a malignancy of the thyroid C cells or parafollicular cells. Thyroid C cells elaborate a number of peptides and hormones, such as calcitonin, carcinoembryonic antigen, and chromogranin A. Some or all of these markers are elevated in patients with MTC and can be used to confirm the diagnosis as well as to follow patients longitudinally for recurrence. Medullary thyroid cancer consists of a spectrum of diseases that ranges from extremely indolent tumors that are stable for many years to aggressive types associated with a high mortality rate. Genetic testing for RET mutations has allowed identification of familial cases and prophylactic thyroidectomy for cure. The only curative treatment is complete surgical resection.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Thyroid cancers are largely divided into medullary (MTC) and non-medullary (NMTC) cancers , depending on the cell type of origin. Familial non-medullary thyroid cancer (FNMTC) comprises about 5-15% of NMTC and is a heterogeneous group of diseases, including both non-syndromic and syndromic forms. Non-syndromic FNMTC tends to manifest papillary thyroid carcinoma , usually multifocal and bilateral . Several high-penetrance genes for FNMTC have been identified, but they are often confined to a few or single families, and other susceptibility loci appear to play a small part, conferring only small increments in risk. Familial susceptibility is likely to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental influences. The current focus of research in FNMTC is to characterise the susceptibility genes and their role in carcinogenesis. FNMTC can also occur as a part of multitumour genetic syndromes such as familial adenomatous polyposis , Cowden's disease , Werner's syndrome and Carney complex . These tend to present at an early age and are multicentric and bilateral with distinct pathology. The clinical evaluation of these patients is similar to that for most patients with a thyroid nodule. Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) arises from the parafollicular cells of the thyroid which release calcitonin. The familial form of MTC accounts for 20-25% of cases and presents as a part of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) syndromes or as a pure familial MTC (FMTC). They are caused by germline point mutations in the RET oncogene on chromosome 10q11.2. There is a clear genotype-phenotype correlation, and the aggressiveness of FMTC depends on the specific genetic mutation, which should determine the timing of surgery.",

The predominant BRAF V600E mutation has not been detected in benign thyroid tissue so far, so consequently, this assumedly pathognomonic alteration is qualified to improve the preoperative diagnosis of PTC.;Two hundred ninety preoperatively harvested fine-needle aspiration biopsies (FNABs) underwent routine cytologic assessment. BRAF V600E mutation analysis was performed by mutation-specific PCR using the same cell material; a hybrid-specific RT-PCR assay was used for detection of RET/PTC1 rearrangements. Detected genetic alterations were verified by direct sequencing. Definitive histopathology was obtained in 93/290 lesions following surgery of the respective thyroid nodule.;While cytology alone diagnosed 13/30 malignancies (22 PTCs, 4 FTCs, 1 MTC, 1 UTC, 2 metastases), five additional malignancies were identified by supplementary mutation analysis. Cytology classified eight FNABs as benign, while postoperative histology demonstrated a thyroid malignancy (6 PTCs, 1 FTC, 1 metastasis). In four of these eight cases, the genetic analysis detected a BRAF V600E mutation or a RET/PTC1 rearrangement. Classifying both suspicious and malignant FNAB results as positive cytology results, supplementary genetic testing increased the overall sensitivity of FNAB from 70.4 to 85.7%, the positive predictive value (PPV) from 59.4 to 64.9%, and the negative predictive value (NPV) from 84.0 to 91.3%.;Supplementary mutation analysis of RET and especially of the BRAF V600E mutation in FNABs is a fast and probably cost-effective assay in routine diagnostic setting. Mutation analyses of PTC-specific genetic alterations improve the preoperative identification and prognostic assessment of thyroid malignancies and therefore enable an optimized surgical strategy.",

Germline mutations were found in all 9 of the affected individuals and in 6 of the 27 individuals of unknown status.

A 32-year-old man and a 15-year-old boy, with elevated calcitonin levels detected by the C-cell-stimulation test, but no evident thyroid tumor, underwent total thyroidectomy. Histopathological diagnosis revealed multiple micro MTCs. A 7-year-old girl without evidence of a thyroid tumor or an elevated calcitonin level is being followed up. The remaining two subjects with an evident thyroid tumor and elevated calcitonin levels refused surgery. These results suggest that genetic screening for MEN type 2 afflicted family members can facilitate the presymptomatic detection of gene carriers.

We correlated the clinico-pathological features of MEN2-associated PCC (MEN-PCC) with RET mutations and compared them with non-MEN adrenal-PCCs.;In this retrospective single institution study on a large PCC database (n = 208, 1997-2014) 24 MEN-PCC patients with known RET mutations were reviewed. Excluding 7 with incomplete data, the study cohort of 17 MEN-PCC patients from 11 kindreds (M:F::7:10) was identified. Clinical, biochemical, pathological attributes, and outcomes in the MEN-PCC group were correlated with the genotype, and further compared with non-MEN, apparently sporadic adrenal-PCCs (n = 132, excluding 37 extra-adrenal and 15 VHL/NF1/SDH-associated PCC).;Components of MEN2 encountered included MTC in 13(76.5%), Marfanoid habitus in 2, and PHPT, cutaneous lichen amyloidosis and mucosal neuromas in 1 patient each. In 11(64.7%), PCC was the first detected MEN2 component (Symptomatic:8, Incidentaloma:3). Four (23.5%) were normotensive; 8(47.1%) had bilateral PCC (7 synchronous, 1 metachronous). Surgery for PCC included laparoscopic adrenalectomy in 12; and cortical-sparing adrenalectomy in 2 of 8 bilateral PCC patients. Mean MEN-PCC tumor size was 6.9 ± 3.9 cm, and 6(35%) had additional adrenal medullary hyperplasia. Four different genotypes were encountered, commonest involving codon 634, others being 804 and 918. Mean age in MEN-PCC (27.7 ± 12.2 years) was lower than non-MEN PCC (39.4 ± 15.7, p = 0.018). Proportion of pediatric patients (35.3% in MEN-PCC vs. 12.9% in non-MEN-PCC, p = 0.007), bilateral tumors (47.1% in MEN-PCC, 4.5% in non-MEN-PCC, p < 0.001), and adrenal medullary hyperplasia (35.2% in MEN-PCC, 0.7% in non-MEN-PCC, p < 0.001) were different. Median 24-hour urinary metanephrines was significantly higher in index MEN-PCC patients, than non-MEN-PCC (634 vs. 214 mcg/24 h, p value = 0.006), but was non-significantly higher in non-index MEN-PCC patients. Mean tumor sizes were comparable in the two groups. None of MEN-PCC patients had malignant PCC, compared to 7(5.3%) in non-MEN-PCC.;In this cohort of MEN-PCC from India, the commonest causative RET mutations for MEN-PCC involved codon 634.

Because no more than 10 % of HSCR cases have a late presentation with classical chronic constipation and megacolon, the clinician has to make a difficult, early diagnosis, which is the crux of the clinical problem. The aim of this review paper is to present all tools currently available to make a clear HSCR diagnosis and to discuss the problems facing the clinician and the pediatric surgeon in the correct identification of HSCR and of other intestinal dysganglionoses.;Based on the current state of knowledge and 24 years' personal experience in clinical practice and basic research in this field, I describe an algorithmic approach that enables clinicians and surgeons to rationalize and maximize the clarity of diagnosis through a complementary set of procedures and enzyme-histochemical reactions.;Two innovative techniques, added to the protocol in the last four years, are described: the lyophilized HSCR diagnostic kit, and the one-trocar transumbilical laparoscopic intestinal full-thickness biopsy technique (OTTLB).;The rational, algorithmic diagnostic pathway proposed in this review paper aims to optimize every diagnosis by the stepwise application of a complementary set of procedures and enzyme-histochemical reactions as they become appropriate. In the interests of simplifying genetic molecular diagnosis, I suggest the following guidelines: 1) only in cases of total colonic aganglionosis (TCA) is it advisable to carry out full RET mutation screening (the mutation rate is up to 70 %); and 2) all HSCR patients should be tested only for standard MEN2A and MTC mutations. If these are present, the patients should be followed up carefully with proper surveillance and biochemical testing of other susceptible family members as they are at risk of developing neuroendocrine tumors.",

However, the same is not true for a resource-poor country, where clinicians are still struggling to diagnose and adequately manage this relatively uncommon thyroid malignancy. We hereby present our experience of managing MTC at a tertiary care referral center in North India.;This was a retrospective study conducted between January 1990 and July 2009. Demographics, clinical profiles, details of surgical procedures, and follow-up records were reviewed.;A total of 71 patients with MTC were identified. Mean age of this group was 39.9±14.1 years, and men outnumbered women 1.7:1. Some 84.5% of patients had seemingly sporadic MTC, and 15.5% had familial MTC (MEN2a=14.1%, MEN 2b=1.4%). All patients had a thyroid nodule at the time of presentation. Mean tumor diameter was 4.9 cm. Cervical lymphadenopathy, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, extrathyroidal invasion, and distant metastases were present in 59%, 7.2%, 10%, and 4.2% of patients, respectively. Staging showed that 4.8% of patients were stage I, 17.5% stage II, 14.3% stage III, and 63.6% stage IV. Treatment was as follows: 92.6% of patients had total thyroidectomy (primary or secondary); 67.6% central compartment lymph node dissection, 62.3% lateral cervical lymph node dissection, and 7.2% trans-sternal mediastinal lymph node dissection performed. Some 66.7% of patients suffered from persistent hypercalcitoninemia, and 11.4% of those underwent reoperation. The 5-year and 10-year overall survival (OS) was 74.6% and 58%, respectively.;The majority of the patients with MTC presented at stage IVa, contributing to the high rate of persistent hypercalcitoninemia. Despite a policy of observation and intervening only in overtly symptomatic patients with persistent hypercalcitoninemia, overall survival (OS) in our study was comparable to other series, reinforcing the belief that persistent hypercalcitoninemia has an indolent course in most patients.",

The drug is currently in phase I/II/III clinical trials for a number of other solid tumours and haematological malignancies. The adverse event (AE) profile is similar to that of other newer angiogenesis inhibitors. Hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) is an important dose-limiting dermatological adverse event of this class of drugs.;To ascertain the incidence and risk of HFSR in patients with cancer during treatment with cabozantinib.;Electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology Meeting Library were queried from inception to July 2014. Only phase II/III studies investigating cabozantinib for the treatment of cancer were shortlisted. The incidence, relative risk (RR) and 95% CI were calculated using random- or fixed-effects models, depending on the heterogeneity of the included studies.;We included 831 patients treated with cabozantinib for various solid malignancies in the analysis. The overall incidence was 35.3% (95% CI 27.9-43.6%) for all-grade and 9.5% (95% CI 7.6-11.7%) for high-grade HFSR.

The aim of this study is to present our experience with this unusual disease, looking for answers to some of these questions.;Of 169 patients belonging to 19 MEN 2A families, 54 (32%) presented with pheochromocytoma. The following variables have been studied: (1) clinical and diagnostic data [age, mutation, clinical features, results of catecholamines and catabolites in a 24-h urine sample, computerized tomography (CT) scan and iodine-131 meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy results, and the means of diagnostic, clinical, or genetic screening]; (2) surgical treatment; and (3) follow-up and recurrence. The mean follow-up time was 92.5 months (range: 12-120 months).;The mean age of the 54 patients was 37.9 years (range: 14-71 years); 33 were women. Most (96.3%) mutations were found in exon 11. The most frequent mutations were Cys634Tyr (in 33 cases [61.1%]) and Cys634Arg (in 14 [25.9%]). The diagnosis of pheocromocytoma was made after the diagnosis of MTC in 26 cases (48.2%), simultaneously in 21 (38.9%), and prior in the 7 remaining cases (12.9%). At the time of diagnosis 28 patients (51.8%) were asymptomatic and 26 (48.2%) had clinical features related to pheochromocytoma. In 6 patients (11.1%), the values of catecholamines and catabolites in urine were normal. In the cases with high values, the most useful isolated determination was that of metanephrines (82%), followed by adrenaline (76%). The CT scan did not provide a correct diagnosis in 6 patients with bilateral lesions, and one patient with a bilateral tumor was not diagnosed by MIBG. The combination of CT scan and MIBG diagnosed 100% of cases. The pheochromocytoma was bilateral in 27 cases, with a total number of 81 pathological glands detected. A laparascopic approach was used in 30 cases and a laparotomy in 24. The mean tumor size was 4.5 cm (range: 1-18 cm). Five patients with unilateral resection relapsed (18.5%), and the mean relapse time was 43.2 months (range: 12-120 months). There was a greater frequency of pheochromocytoma in those subjects who had the Cys634Arg mutation (p < 0.03). In addition, the Cys634Arg mutation is more frequent in bilateral cases. There are no prognostic factors for recurrence.;Pheochromocytoma in MEN 2A is related to the type of mutation, which can be early onset and is frequently asymptomatic. Its diagnosis requires catecholamines determinations as well as a CT scan. Correct diagnosis of bilaterality is established by CT and MIBG. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is the treatment of choice.",
