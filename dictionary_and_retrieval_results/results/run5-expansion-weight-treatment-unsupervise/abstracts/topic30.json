RET and ROS1 fusion-positive tumors are mainly observed in young, female, and/or never smoking patients. Studies based on in vitro and in vivo (i.e., mouse) models and studies of several fusion-positive patients indicate that inhibiting the kinase activity of the RET and ROS1 fusion proteins is a promising therapeutic strategy. Accordingly, there are several ongoing clinical trials aimed at examining the efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) against RET and ROS1 proteins in patients with fusion-positive lung cancer. Other gene fusions (NTRK1, NRG1, and FGFR1/2/3) that are targetable by existing TKIs have also been identified in NSCLCs. Options for personalized lung cancer therapy will be increased with the help of multiplex diagnosis systems able to detect multiple druggable gene fusions. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"The targeting of oncogenic 'driver' kinases with small molecule inhibitors has proven to be a highly effective therapeutic strategy in selected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, acquired resistance to targeted therapies invariably arises and is a major limitation to patient care. ROS1 fusion proteins are a recently described class of oncogenic driver, and NSCLC patients that express these fusions generally respond well to ROS1-targeted therapy. In this study, we sought to determine mechanisms of acquired resistance to ROS1 inhibition. To accomplish this, we analyzed tumor samples from a patient who initially responded to the ROS1 inhibitor crizotinib but eventually developed acquired resistance. In addition, we generated a ROS1 inhibition-resistant derivative of the initially sensitive NSCLC cell line HCC78. Previously described mechanisms of acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors including target kinase-domain mutation, target copy number gain, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and conversion to small cell lung cancer histology were found to not underlie resistance in the patient sample or resistant cell line. However, we did observe a switch in the control of growth and survival signaling pathways from ROS1 to EGFR in the resistant cell line. As a result of this switch, ROS1 inhibition-resistant HCC78 cells became sensitive to EGFR inhibition, an effect that was enhanced by co-treatment with a ROS1 inhibitor. Our results suggest that co-inhibition of ROS1 and EGFR may be an effective strategy to combat resistance to targeted therapy in some ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC patients. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"The recent discovery and characterization of an oncogenic ROS1 gene fusion in a subset of lung cancers has raised significant clinical interest because small molecule inhibitors may be effective to these tumors. As lung cancers with ROS1 rearrangements comprise only 1-3% of lung adenocarcinomas, patients with such tumors must be identified to gain optimal benefit from molecular therapy. Recently, immunohistochemical analyses using a novel anti-ROS1 rabbit monoclonal antibody (D4D6) have shown promise for accurate identification of ROS1-rearranged cancers. To validate this finding, we compared the immunostaining results of tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing 17 ROS1-rearranged and 253 ROS1-non-rearranged lung carcinomas. All 17 ROS1-rearranged cancers showed ROS1 immunoreactivity mostly in a diffuse and moderate-to-strong manner with an H-score range of 5-300 (median, 260). In contrast, 69% of ROS1-non-rearranged cancers lacked detectable immunoreactivity, whereas the remaining 31% showed reactivity mainly in a weak or focal manner. The H-score for the entire ROS1-non-rearranged group ranged from 0 to 240 (median, 0). The difference in H-score between the two cohorts was statistically significant, and the H-score cutoff (≥150) allowed optimal discrimination (94% sensitivity and 98% specificity). Similar but slightly less-specific performance was achieved using the extent of diffuse (≥75%) staining or ≥2+ staining intensity as cutoffs. CD74-ROS1 and EZR-ROS1 fusions were significantly associated with at least focal globular immunoreactivity and plasma membranous accentuation, respectively, and these patterns were specific to ROS1-rearranged cases. Although full-length ROS1 is expressed in some ROS1-non-rearranged cases, we showed that establishment of an optimal set of interpretative criteria makes ROS1 immunohistochemistry a valuable method to rapidly and accurately screen lung cancer patients for appropriate molecular therapy.

In pemetrexed-treated cohorts, ROS1-positive patients with low TS expression had a statistically significant longer PFS than those with high TS expression (184 vs. 110 days, P = 0.0105).;We retrospectively identified patients with NSCLC who were screened for ROS1 fusion using multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from October 2013 to February 2016. The thymidylate synthase (TS) mRNA levels were tested using quantitative real-time RT-PCR.;Crizotinib was also highly active at treating Chinese NSCLC patients with ROS1 rearrangement.

While the clinicopathologic characteristics of ROS1-rearranged glioblastoma and cholangiocarcinoma patients remain to be defined, the clinicopathologic characteristics of ROS1-rearranged NSCLC patients have recently been described. Although ROS1 shares only 49% amino acid sequence homology with ALK in the kinase domains, several ALK inhibitors have demonstrated in vitro inhibitory activity against ROS1. With the recent US approval of crizotinib, a multi-targeted ALK/MET kinase inhibitor, for the treatment of ALK-rearranged NSCLC, attention has turned to ROS1-rearranged tumors, especially NSCLC.

The approval was based on a clinically meaningful, durable objective response rate (ORR) in a multicenter, single-arm clinical trial (ROS1 cohort of Trial PROFILE 1001) in patients with ROS1-positive mNSCLC. The trial enrolled 50 patients (age range: 25-77 years) whose tumors were prospectively determined to have a ROS1 gene rearrangement by break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (96%) or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (4%) clinical trial assays. Crizotinib demonstrated an ORR of 66% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 51%-79%) with a median duration of response of 18.3 months by independent radiology review and 72% (95% CI: 58%-84%) by investigator review. Patients received crizotinib 250 mg twice daily and had a median duration of exposure of 34.4 months. The toxicity profile in ROS1-positive patients was generally consistent with the randomized safety data in the U.S. Product Insert from two ALK-positive mNSCLC trials. The most common (≥25%) adverse reactions and laboratory test abnormalities included vision disorders, elevation of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels, nausea, hypophosphatemia, diarrhea, edema, vomiting, constipation, neutropenia, and fatigue. There were no treatment-related deaths. A favorable benefit-to-risk evaluation led to the traditional approval of crizotinib for this new supplemental indication.;Given the results from the ROS1 cohort of the clinical trial PROFILE 1001, crizotinib represents a new treatment option and the first approved therapy for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors are ROS1 positive.

Recently we have shown that the broad-range kinase inhibitor staurosporine (STS) reactivates the apoptotic machinery in U1810 NSCLC cells [Joseph et al., Oncogene 21 (2002) 65]. Lately, several STS analogs that are more specific in kinase inhibition have been suggested for tumor treatment. In this study the apoptosis-inducing ability of the STS analogs PKC 412 and Ro 31-8220 used alone or in combination with DNA-damaging agents in U1810 cells was investigated. In these cells Ro 31-8220 neither induced apoptosis when used alone, nor sensitized cells to etoposide treatment. PKC 412 as a single agent induced death of a small number of U1810 cells, whereas it efficiently triggered a dose- and time-dependent apoptosis in U1285 small cell lung carcinoma cells. In both cell types PKC 412 triggered release of mitochondrial proteins followed by caspase activation. However, concomitant activation of a caspase-independent pathway was essential to kill NSCLC cells. Importantly, PKC 412 was able to sensitize etoposide- and radiation-induced death of U1810 cells. The best sensitization was achieved when PKC 412 was administered 24 h after treatments. In U1810 cells, Ro 31-8220 decreased PMA-induced ERK phosphorylation as efficiently as PKC 412, indicating that the failure of Ro 31-8220 to induce apoptosis was not due to weaker inhibition of conventional and novel PKC isoforms. However, Ro 31-8220 increased the basal level of ERK and Akt phosphorylation in both cell lines, whereas Akt phosphorylation was suppressed in the U1810 cells, which might influence apoptosis. These results suggest that PKC 412 could be a useful tool in increasing the efficiency of therapy of NSCLC.",

Firstly, it is confirmed that matrine induces apoptosis of human NSCLC cells with anti-apoptotic factors inhibited and dependent on caspase activity. In addition, we found that matrine increases the phosphorylation of p38 but not its total protein, and inhibition of the p38 pathway with SB202190 partially prevents matrine-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, matrine generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a dose- and time-dependent manner, which is reversed by pretreatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). Additionally, inhibition of cell proliferation and increase of phosphorylation of p38 was also partially reversed by NAC. Collectively, matrine activates p38 pathway leading to a caspase-dependent apoptosis by inducing generation of ROS in NSCLC cells and may be a potential chemical for NSCLC. ",

The cell death induced by PPARgamma activation presented apoptotic features of oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation in A549 human non-small-cell lung cancer cell line. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was accompanied by increased expression of proline oxidase (POX), a redox enzyme expressed in mitochondria, upon incubation with the agonists. POX RNA interference treatment blocked PPARgamma-induced ROS formation and cytotoxicity, suggesting that POX plays a functional role in apoptosis through ROS formation. The apoptotic effects by the agonists were antagonized by bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, a PPARgamma antagonist, and by knockdown of PPARgamma expression, indicating the involvement of PPARgamma in these actions. The results of the present study suggest that PPARgamma activation induces apoptotic cell death in non-small-cell lung carcinoma mainly through ROS formation via POX induction.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Crizotinib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has shown tremendous promise in the treatment of lung adenocarcinomas harboring either ALK or ROS1 rearrangements. Recently, small studies of colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) have suggested an incidence of EML4-ALK translocations of 0.4% to 2.4% and FIG-ROS1 translocations of 0.8%. In lung cancer, screening immunohistochemical staining for ALK and ROS1 has been validated as highly sensitive for these translocations, but this has not been investigated in CRC. We therefore sought to investigate the incidence of ALK and ROS1 overexpression as detected by immunohistochemical staining in a large cohort of CRCs. Of the 1889 CRCs, only 1 case (0.05%) demonstrated diffuse strong positive staining for ALK, whereas 14 (0.7%) showed weak nonspecific staining; the remainder were negative. The 1 positive case was confirmed to harbor an ALK rearrangement by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), whereas the 14 tumors with weak staining were FISH-negative. The ALK positive case demonstrated positive expression in all dysplastic and malignant cells indicating that the translocation was an early clonal event. No cases were positive for ROS1 by immunohistochemical staining, although 2 cases did show some nonspecific staining and were shown to be negative for ROS1 translocation by FISH. We conclude that although diffuse strong positive staining for ALK is likely to be highly specific for ALK rearrangement in CRC, both ALK and ROS1 immunohistochemical staining are very low-yield tests and difficult to justify in the routine clinical setting.

More recently, low-frequency rearrangements of TRK kinases have been described in NSCLC, colorectal carcinoma, glioblastoma, and Spitzoid melanoma. Entrectinib, whose discovery and preclinical characterization are reported herein, is a novel, potent inhibitor of ALK, ROS1, and, importantly, of TRK family kinases, which shows promise for therapy of tumors bearing oncogenic forms of these proteins. Proliferation profiling against over 200 human tumor cell lines revealed that entrectinib is exquisitely potent in vitro against lines that are dependent on the drug's pharmacologic targets. Oral administration of entrectinib to tumor-bearing mice induced regression in relevant human xenograft tumors, including the TRKA-dependent colorectal carcinoma KM12, ROS1-driven tumors, and several ALK-dependent models of different tissue origins, including a model of brain-localized lung cancer metastasis. Entrectinib is currently showing great promise in phase I/II clinical trials, including the first documented objective responses to a TRK inhibitor in colorectal carcinoma and in NSCLC. The drug is, thus, potentially suited to the therapy of several molecularly defined cancer settings, especially that of TRK-dependent tumors, for which no approved drugs are currently available.

We found that some lung cancer cell lines and tumor samples are characterized by increased levels of lipidated LC3. Inhibition of autophagy sensitized non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis; however, such response was attenuated in cells treated with etoposide. Inhibition of autophagy stimulated ROS formation and treatment with cisplatin had a synergistic effect on ROS accumulation. Using genetically encoded hydrogen peroxide probes directed to intracellular compartments we found that autophagy inhibition facilitated formation of hydrogen peroxide in the cytosol and mitochondria of cisplatin-treated cells. The enhancement of cell death under conditions of inhibited autophagy was partially dependent on caspases, however, antioxidant NAC or hydroxyl radical scavengers, but not the scavengers of superoxide or a MnSOD mimetic, reduced the release of cytochrome c and abolished the sensitization of the cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Such inhibition of ROS prevented the processing and release of AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor) and HTRA2 from mitochondria. Furthermore, suppression of autophagy in NSCLC cells with active basal autophagy reduced their proliferation without significant effect on the cell-cycle distribution. Inhibition of cell proliferation delayed accumulation of cells in the S phase upon treatment with etoposide that could attenuate the execution stage of etoposide-induced apoptosis. These findings suggest that autophagy suppression leads to inhibition of NSCLC cell proliferation and sensitizes them to cisplatin-induced caspase-dependent and -independent apoptosis by stimulation of ROS formation.",

In recent decades only histomorphology was used to classify lung cancer as either small (SCLC) or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), although NSCLC was further subdivided in different entities; however, as no specific therapy options were available classification of specific subtypes was not clinically meaningful. This fundamentally changed with the discovery of specific molecular alterations in adenocarcinoma (ADC), e.g. mutations in KRAS, EGFR and BRAF or translocations of the ALK and ROS1 gene loci, which now form the basis of targeted therapies and have led to a significantly improved patient outcome. The diagnostic, prognostic and predictive value of imaging, morphological, immunohistochemical and molecular characteristics as well as their interaction were systematically assessed in a large cohort with available clinical data including patient survival. Specific and sensitive diagnostic markers and marker panels were defined and diagnostic test algorithms for predictive biomarker assessment were optimized. It was demonstrated that the semi-quantitative assessment of ADC growth patterns is a stage-independent predictor of survival and is reproducibly applicable in the routine setting. Specific histomorphological characteristics correlated with computed tomography (CT) imaging features and thus allowed an improved interdisciplinary classification, especially in the preoperative or palliative setting. Moreover, specific molecular characteristics, for example BRAF mutations and the proliferation index (Ki-67) were identified as clinically relevant prognosticators. Comprehensive clinical, morphological, immunohistochemical and molecular assessment of NSCLCs allow an optimized patient stratification.

However, radioresistance is a major obstacle to the success of radiation therapy and contributes significantly to tumor recurrence and treatment failure, highlighting the need for the development of novel radiosensitizers that can be used to overcome tumor radioresistance and, thus, improve the efficacy of radiotherapy. Previous studies indicated that resveratrol (RV) may sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapy and ionizing radiation (IR). However, the mechanisms by which RV increases the radiation sensitivity of cancer cells have not been well characterized. Here, we show that RV treatment enhances IR-induced cell killing in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells through an apoptosis-independent mechanism. Further studies revealed that the percentage of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal)-positive senescent cells was markedly higher in cells treated with IR in combination with RV compared with cells treated either with IR or RV alone, suggesting that RV treatment enhances IR-induced premature senescence in lung cancer cells. Comet assays demonstrate that RV and IR combined treatment causes more DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) than IR or RV treatment alone. DCF-DA staining and flow cytometric analyses demonstrate that RV and IR combined treatment leads to a significant increase in ROS production in irradiated NSCLC cells. Furthermore, our investigation show that inhibition of ROS production by N-acetyl-cysteine attenuates RV-induced radiosensitization in lung cancer cells. Collectively, these results demonstrate that RV-induced radiosensitization is associated with significant increase of ROS production, DNA-DSBs and senescence induction in irradiated NSCLC cells, suggesting that RV treatment may sensitize lung cancer cells to radiotherapy via enhancing IR-induced premature senescence.",

In this study, we investigated the antitumor activity of NPS-1034, a newly developed drug that targets both MET and AXL, in NSCLC cells with acquired resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib (HCC827/GR and HCC827/ER, respectively). Characterization of H820 cells and evaluation of NPS-1034 efficacy in these cells were also performed. The resistance of HCC827/GR was mediated by MET activation, whereas AXL activation led to resistance in HCC827/ER. The combination of gefitinib or erlotinib with NPS-1034 synergistically inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell death in both resistant cell lines. Accordingly, suppression of Akt was noted only in the presence of treatment with both drugs. NPS-1034 was also effective in xenograft mouse models of HCC827/GR. Although the H820 cell line was reported previously to have T790M and MET amplification, we discovered that AXL was also activated in this cell line. There were no antitumor effects of siRNA or inhibitors specific for EGFR or MET, whereas combined treatment with AXL siRNA or NPS-1034 and EGFR-TKIs controlled H820 cells, suggesting that AXL is the main signal responsible for resistance. In addition, NPS-1034 inhibited cell proliferation as well as ROS1 activity in HCC78 cells with ROS1 rearrangement.

In this review, we will highlight the key driver oncogenic gene mutations and fusions identified in lung cancer. The review will summarize and report the available demographic and clinicopathological data as well as molecular details behind various lung cancer gene alterations in the context of race. We hope to shed some light into the disparities in the incidence of various genetic mutations among lung cancer patients of different racial backgrounds. As molecularly targeted therapy continues to advance in lung cancer, racial differences in specific genetic/genomic alterations can have an important impact in the choices of therapeutics and in our understanding of the drug sensitivity/resistance profile. The most relevant genes in lung cancer described in this review include the following: EGFR, KRAS, MET, LKB1, BRAF, PIK3CA, ALK, RET, and ROS1. Commonly identified genetic/genomic alterations such as missense or nonsense mutations, small insertions or deletions, alternative splicing, and chromosomal fusion rearrangements were discussed. Relevance in current targeted therapeutic drugs was mentioned when appropriate. We also highlighted various targeted therapeutics that are currently under clinical development, such as the MET inhibitors and antibodies. With the advent of next-generation sequencing, the landscape of genomic alterations in lung cancer is expected to be much transformed and detailed in upcoming years.

        "Doc_abstract":"Human cancers usually evolve through multistep processes. These processes are driven by the accumulation of abundant genetic and epigenetic abnormalities. However, some lung cancers depend on a single activated oncogene by somatic mutation, termed 'driver oncogenic mutations', for their proliferation and survival. EGFR(epidermal growth factor receptor) mutations and ALK(anaplastic lymphoma kinase) rearrangement are typical examples of such driver oncogenic mutations found in lung adenocarcinomas. EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) or ALK-TKIs significantly improved treatment outcomes compared with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with lung cancers harboring EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangement, respectively. Therefore, treatment strategies for lung cancers have dramatically changed from a 'general and empiric' to a 'personalized and evidence-based' approach according to the driver oncogenic mutation. Several novel driver oncogenic mutations, which are candidates as novel targets, such as ERBB2, BRAF, ROS1, and RET, have been discovered. Despite these successes, several limitations have arisen. One example is that some lung cancers do not respond to treatments targeting driver oncogenic mutations, as exemplified in KRAS-mutated lung cancers. Another is resistance to molecular-targeted drugs. Such resistance includes de novo resistance and acquired resistance. A number of molecular mechanisms underlying such resistance have been reported. These mechanisms can be roughly divided into three categories: alteration of the targeted oncogenes themselves by secondary mutations or amplification, activation of an alternative oncogenic signaling track, and conversion of cellular characteristics. Overcoming resistance is a current area of urgent clinical research.",

However, many chemoresistant cancer cells often develop a relatively higher threshold for inducing apoptosis, causing a limited efficacy of anti-cancer drugs. Likewise, lung cancer cells acquire chemoresistance against CPT analogs, such as irinotecan and topotecan, finally resulting in an unsatisfied outcome and poor prognosis of lung cancer patients. TFPP is a quinone-containing compound as a candidate for CPT-based combination chemotherapy. In this study, we examined the effect of TFPP and CPT cotreatment on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Cell proliferation and flow cytometry-based Annexin-V/PI staining assays demonstrated the synergistic effect of TFPP on CPT-induced apoptosis in both NSCLC A549 and H1299 cells. The results of CPT and TFPP cotreatment cause the regulation of the ERK-Bim axis and the activation of mitochondrial-mediated caspase cascade, including caspase-9 and caspase-3. Besides, TFPP significantly enhanced CPT-induced endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the two NSCLC cells. In contrast, the treatment of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), an ROS scavenger, rescues the apoptosis of NSCLC cells induced by TFPP and CPT cotreatment, suggesting that the synergistic effect of TFPP on CPT-induced anti-NSCLC cells is through upregulating ROS production. Consequently, our results suggest that TFPP sensitizes NSCLC towards CPT-based chemotherapy may act through decreasing the apoptosis-initiating threshold. Therefore, TFPP may be a promising chemosensitizer for lung cancer treatment, and the underlying mechanism warrants further.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Lung cancers are characterised by abundant genetic diversity with relatively few recurrent mutations occurring at high frequency. However, the genetic alterations often affect a common group of oncogenic signalling pathways. There have been vast improvements in our understanding of the molecular biology that underpins lung cancer in recent years and this has led to a revolution in the diagnosis and treatment of lung adenocarcinomas (ADC) based on the genotype of an individual's tumour. New technologies are identifying key and potentially targetable genetic aberrations not only in adenocarcinoma but also in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung. Lung cancer mutations have been identified in v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), BRAF and the parallel phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway oncogenes and more recently in MEK and HER2 while structural rearrangements in ALK, ROS1 and possibly rearranged during transfection (RET) provide new therapeutic targets. Amplification is another mechanism of activation of oncogenes such as MET in adenocarcinoma, fibroblastgrowth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) in SCC. Intriguingly, many of these genetic alternations are associated with smoking status and with particular racial and gender differences, which may provide insight into the mechanisms of carcinogenesis and role of host factors in lung cancer development and progression. The role of tumour suppressor genes is increasingly recognised with aberrations reported in TP53, PTEN, RB1, LKB11 and p16/CDKN2A. Identification of biologically significant genetic alterations in lung cancer that lead to activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumour suppressor genes has the potential to provide further therapeutic opportunities. It is hoped that these discoveries may make a major contribution to improving outcome for patients with this poor prognosis disease. ",

A strategy to target NSCLC is to identify agents that are effective against NSCLC cells while sparing normal cells. We show that tigecycline, an FDA-approved antibiotic drug, preferentially targets NSCLC cells. Tigecycline is effective in inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of multiple cell lines derived from two common NSCLC subtypes: adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Tigecycline also dose-dependently inhibits colony formation of NSCLC subpopulation of cells with highly proliferative and invasive properties. Compared to NSCLC cells, tigecycline affects proliferation and survival of normal fibroblast cells significantly to a less extent. More importantly, tigecycline significantly inhibits NSCLC tumor growth through decreasing proliferation and increasing apoptosis of tumor cells in vivo. Tigecycline significantly inhibits mitochondrial respiration, mitochondrial membrane potential, and ATP levels and increases reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting that tigecycline impairs mitochondrial functions. Our study suggests that tigecycline may be a useful therapeutic agent, and inhibiting mitochondrial functions may represent a new targeted therapy for NSCLC. ",

Here, we found that fentanyl reduces the sensitivity of cisplatin in human lung cancer cells and induces autophagy. Fentanyl induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and JNK activation. N-acetyl‑L‑cysteine is a ROS scavenger and antioxidant, and the inhibition of JNK with SP600125 prevented fentanyl‑induced autophagy. We also found that 3-methyladenine (3-MA; an autophagy inhibitor) increased the sensitivity of DDP and weakened the inhibition of fentanyl.

Despite major advances in targeted therapy in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas, the overall 5-year survival rate for lung cancer worldwide has not significantly changed for the last few decades. DNA repair deficiency is known to contribute to lung cancer development. In fact, human polymorphisms in DNA repair genes such as xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC) are highly associated with lung cancer incidence. However, the direct genetic evidence for the role of XPC for lung cancer development is still lacking. Mutations of the Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (Kras) or its downstream effector genes occur in almost all lung cancer cells, and there are a number of mouse models for lung cancer with these mutations. Using activated Kras, Kras(LA1), as a driver for lung cancer development in mice, we showed for the first time that mice with Kras(LA1) and Xpc knockout had worst outcomes in lung cancer development, and this phenotype was associated with accumulated DNA damage. Using cultured cells, we demonstrated that induced expression of oncogenic KRAS(G12V) led to increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as DNA damage, and both can be suppressed by anti-oxidants. Our results suggest that XPC may help repair DNA damage caused by KRAS-mediated production of ROS. ",

We evaluated the effects of the two potential antitumor agents of the lamellarin class on a highly apoptosis-resistant NSCLC cell line. Both the marine alkaloid lamellarin-D and its synthetic amino derivative PM031379 induced the activation of Bax, the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), as well as the activation of caspase-3. However, only PM031379 triggered cell death and sign of nuclear apoptosis coupled to the nuclear translocation of AIF. Depletion of AIF with small interfering RNA or microinjection of a neutralizing anti-AIF antibody largely prevented PM031379-induced cytotoxicity, underscoring the essential contribution of AIF to NSCLC killing. Using NSCLC cells lacking mitochondrial DNA, we showed that the generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) was crucial for the PM031379-induced translocation of AIF to the nucleus and subsequently cell death. Pretreatment of NSCLC cells with menadione, a mitochondrial ROS generator, was able to restore the deficient chemotherapy-induced apoptosis of NSCLC cells. Altogether, these data suggest that mitochondrial ROS generation is crucial for overriding the chemoresistance of NSCLC cells.

To characterize the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK)/ERK dependence of lung cancers harboring BRAF kinase domain mutations, we screened a large panel of human lung cancer cell lines (n = 87) and tumors (n = 916) for BRAF mutations. We found that non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) cells with both V600E and non-V600E BRAF mutations were selectively sensitive to MEK inhibition compared with those harboring mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), KRAS, or ALK and ROS kinase fusions. Supporting its classification as a \"driver\" mutation in the cells in which it is expressed, MEK inhibition in (V600E)BRAF NSCLC cells led to substantial induction of apoptosis, comparable with that seen with EGFR kinase inhibition in EGFR mutant NSCLC models. Despite high basal ERK phosphorylation, EGFR mutant cells were uniformly resistant to MEK inhibition. Conversely, BRAF mutant cell lines were resistant to EGFR inhibition. These data, together with the nonoverlapping pattern of EGFR and BRAF mutations in human lung cancer, suggest that these lesions define distinct clinical entities whose treatment should be guided by prospective real-time genotyping. To facilitate such an effort, we developed a mass spectrometry-based genotyping method for the detection of hotspot mutations in BRAF, KRAS, and EGFR. Using this assay, we confirmed that BRAF mutations can be identified in a minority of NSCLC tumors and that patients whose tumors harbor BRAF mutations have a distinct clinical profile compared with those whose tumors harbor kinase domain mutations in EGFR.",

HGF stimulation of c-Met-overexpressing H69 SCLC cells (40 ng/ml, 15 min) resulted in an increase of ROS, measured with fluorescent probe 2'-7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) or dihydroethidine (DHE) but not in c-Met-null H446 cells.

SCLC responds to first-line chemotherapy with platinum-based drugs/etoposide, but relapses early with topotecan remaining as the single approved therapeutic agent. Fascaplysin was found to show high cytotoxicity against SCLC cells and to induce cell cycle arrest in G1/0 at lower and S-phase at higher concentrations, respectively.

The Poly(ADP-ribose)-Polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor BYK 204165 antagonized the cytotoxic activity of fascaplysin, pointing to the involvement of DNA repair in response to the anticancer activity of the drug.

The Hh signaling pathway has been one of the most intensely investigated targets for cancer therapy, and a number of compounds inhibiting Hh signaling are being tested clinically for treating many cancers. Lung cancer causes more deaths than the next three most common cancers (colon, breast, and prostate) combined. Cyclopamine was the first compound found to inhibit Hh signaling and has been invaluable for understanding the function of Hh signaling in development and cancer. To find novel strategies for combating lung cancer, we decided to characterize the effect of cyclopamine tartrate (CycT), an improved analogue of cyclopamine, on lung cancer cells and its mechanism of action.;The effect of CycT on oxygen consumption and proliferation of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines was quantified by using an Oxygraph system and live cell counting, respectively. Apoptosis was detected by using Annexin V and Propidium Iodide staining. CycT's impact on ROS generation, mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial morphology in NSCLC cells was monitored by using fluorometry and fluorescent microscopy. Western blotting and fluorescent microscopy were used to detect the levels and localization of Hh signaling targets, mitochondrial fission protein Drp1, and heme-related proteins in various NSCLC cells.;Our findings identified a novel function of CycT, as well as another Hh inhibitor SANT1, to disrupt mitochondrial function and aerobic respiration. Our results showed that CycT, like glutamine depletion, caused a substantial decrease in oxygen consumption in a number of NSCLC cell lines, suppressed NSCLC cell proliferation, and induced apoptosis. Further, we found that CycT increased ROS generation, mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization, and mitochondrial fragmentation, thereby disrupting mitochondrial function in NSCLC cells.;Together, our work demonstrates that CycT, and likely other Hh signaling inhibitors, can interrupt NSCLC cell function by promoting mitochondrial fission and fragmentation, mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization, and ROS generation, thereby diminishing mitochondrial respiration, suppressing cell proliferation, and causing apoptosis. Our work provides novel mechanistic insights into the action of Hh inhibitors in cancer cells.",

About 32% (16 of 50) of these cell lines were highly susceptible to this compound, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀) of < 1 μM. In mechanistic studies, the increased numbers of apoptotic cells as well as increased PARP cleavage showed that cytotoxic effects correlate with apoptosis induction. Treatment with NSC-743380 inhibited transcription factor STAT3 activation and induced ROS production in sensitive human lung cancer cell lines but not in resistant cells. Blocking ROS generation with the antioxidant NDGA dramatically abolished NSC-743380-induced growth suppression and apoptosis, but had minimal effect on NSC-743380-induced STAT3 inhibition, suggesting that STAT3 inhibition is not caused by ROS production. Interestingly, knockdown of STAT3 with use of shSTAT3 induced ROS generation and suppressed tumor cell growth. Moreover, scavenging ROS induced by STAT3 inhibition also diminished antitumor activity of STAT3 inhibition. In vivo administration of NSC-743380 suppressed tumor growth and p-STAT3 in lung tumors.

        "Doc_abstract":"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for ~15% of all lung cancer cases, and chemotherapy has dramatically improved the survival rate of SCLC patients. Yet, the long-term survival rate of this cancer has not improved since multi-drug resistance (MDR) may emerge after chemotherapy. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation-related biological processes, such as energy metabolism and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, have been considered to be associated with tumorigenesis and drug resistance. It was hypothesized and demonstrated, in the present study, that mitochondrial dysfunction is the reason for the occurrence and progression of SCLC. mtDNA from drug sensitive and drug insensitive cell lines (H446 and H446/CDDP) was sequenced and compared with the revised Cambridge reference sequence (rCRS). The results revealed that there was no difference in the mtDNA sequence from H446 and H446/CDDP cells, but several spot mutations were observed according to that of rCRs. Further evaluation on mitochondrial function revealed that H446 cells synthesized and secreted more lactic acid and ROS compared with that of H446/CDDP cells when challenged by the same dose of cisplatin (P>0.05). In addition, examination of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway indicated that more Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-9 were expressed in H446 cells compared with that of H446/CDDP cells when stimulated by the same dose of cisplatin (P>0.05). In conclusion, the results of the present study revealed that mtDNA mutations were responsible for the tumorigenesis of SLCL, but not associated with the drug sensitivity of SCLC cell lines. On the other hand, varied mitochondrium content‑related mitochondrial dysfunction participated in the MDR of SCLC possibly by affecting the ROS-mediated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.",

The relative mtDNA copy number and the oxidative mtDNA damage (formation of 8-OHdG in mtDNA) of each cancer tissue were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Seven female and 22 male lung cancer patients, with a mean age of 63.5 years were evaluated.

Low mtDNA copy number (P=0.089) and low degree of oxidative mtDNA damage (P=0.036) were found to associate with tumor progression. Moreover, mtDNA copy number was significantly related to the degree of oxidative mtDNA damage (P=0.031). The mtDNA copy number and oxidative mtDNA damage were lower in advanced NSCLC after chemotherapy.

Multivariate analyses were performed using the Cox proportional hazards model.;MET data were available for analysis in 158 advanced NSCLC patients. Of these, based on the MET H-score criteria, the IHC-positive rate was 48.1% (76/158). There were more patients with adenocarcinoma in the MET-positive group compared with the MET-negative group (P=0.01). Nine patients with lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma had no MET expression.

We performed a biopsy of a resistant tumor and identified an acquired mutation leading to a glycine-to-arginine substitution at codon 2032 in the ROS1 kinase domain. Although this mutation does not lie at the gatekeeper residue, it confers resistance to ROS1 kinase inhibition through steric interference with drug binding.

However, radiation as a lung cancer treatment remains far from satisfactory due to problems associated with radiation resistance in cancer cells and severe cytotoxicity to non-cancer cells, which arise at doses typically administered to patients. We have recently identified a promising novel inhibitor of β-catenin/Tcf4 interaction, named BC-23 (C21H14ClN3O4S), which acts as a potent cell death enhancer when used in combination with radiation. Sequential exposure of human p53-null non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) H1299 cells to low doses of x-ray radiation, followed 1 hour later by administration of minimally cytotoxic concentrations of BC-23, resulted in a highly synergistic induction of clonogenic cell death (combination index <1.0). Co-treatment with BC-23 at low concentrations effectively inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling and down-regulates c-Myc and cyclin D1 expression. S phase arrest and ROS generation are also involved in the enhancement of radiation effectiveness mediated by BC-23. BC-23 therefore represents a promising new class of radiation enhancer. ",

Metformin (Met), on the other hand, has been reported to improve pathological response to chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. In this study, we propose that combination therapy of 2-dDG with Met will demonstrate enhanced cytotoxicity than either compound alone. Our results indicated that inhibition concentration 25 (IC25) for combined treatment of Met and 2-dDG showed more toxicity as compared to individual agents on a NSCLC cell line, A549. This augmented toxicity is associated with increased lipid peroxidation and decreased glutathione level as well as decreased super oxide dismutase and catalase activities. Combination of Met and 2-dDG also demonstrated enhanced DNA damage, DNA adduct formation, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, and mitochondrial membrane potential alteration, as well as increased apoptosis, caspase-3 activity, P-p38 and P-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) level. It was also shown that inhibition of caspase-3 and p38 kinase partially (75%-87%) reversed Met and 2-dDG induced cell death, without affecting the ROS levels. On the other hand, pre-treatment of cells with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) reversed Met and 2-dDG induced cell death to >90%. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrated that combination of Met and 2-dDG showed better toxicity than individual compounds and cell death is ROS, P-p38 and caspase-3 mediated, thereby providing a proof of concept for the combination of Met and 2-dDG as a potential treatment protocol for NSCLC.",

Application of palliative targeted therapies with oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in advanced/metastatic lung ACs harboring abnormalities in EGFR (gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib) and ALK/ROS1/MET (crizotinib) has consistently led to more favorable outcomes compared with traditional cytotoxic agents. In addition, mutations leading to resistance to first-line EGFR and ALK TKIs can now be successfully inhibited by soon to be approved third-generation EGFR TKIs (osimertinib, rociletinib) and second-generation ALK TKIs (ceritinib, alectinib). Notably, increasing feasibility, accessibility, and application of molecular profiling technologies has permitted dynamic growth in the identification of actionable driver oncogenes. Emerging genomic aberrations for which TKIs have shown impressive results in clinical trials and expansion of drug labels for approved agents are awaited include ROS1 rearrangements (1-2% of tumors, drug: crizotinib) and BRAF-V600E mutations (1-3% of tumors, drugs: vemurafenib, dafrafenib + trametinib).

Here, we synthesized phospho-ibuprofen amide (PIA), a metabolically stable analog of phospho-ibuprofen, formulated it in nanocarriers, and evaluated its pharmacokinetics and anticancer efficacy in pre-clinical models of human lung cancer. PIA was 10-fold more potent than ibuprofen in suppressing the growth of human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, an effect mediated by favorably altering cytokinetics and inducing oxidative stress. Pharmacokinetic studies in rats revealed that liposome-encapsulated PIA exhibited remarkable resistance to hydrolysis by carboxylesterases, remaining largely intact in the systemic circulation, and demonstrated selective distribution to the lungs. The antitumor activity of liposomal PIA was evaluated in a metastatic model of human NSCLC in mice. Liposomal PIA strongly inhibited lung tumorigenesis (>95%) and was significantly (p<0.05) more efficacious than ibuprofen. We observed a significant induction of urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin F2αin vivo, which indicates that ROS stress probably plays an important role in mediating the antitumor efficacy of PIA.

Treatment with drugs that target EGFR typically results in dramatic tumour response compared with conventional chemotherapy in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. Subsequently, newer driver oncogenes such as ALK, ROS1 and RET have been discovered. Nevertheless, surgery has become safer and less invasive in the past 10-15 years. In the era of personalized medicine, thoracic surgeons have to think about their evolving roles. In this article, we discuss four topics relevant to this issue. Firstly, the value of surgical specimens as opposed to biopsy specimens for further understanding tumour biology is discussed. Secondly, extended indication of surgery in the era of targeted therapy is considered. Thirdly, in clinical trials that examine neoadjuvant therapy in patients selected by appropriate biomarkers, the important role of surgeons is highlighted. Finally, the possibility of personalizing the surgical procedure itself according to lung cancer subtypes defined by biomarkers is reviewed.",

The radon-derived ionizing radiation and some components of cigarette smoke induce oxidative stress by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). Respiratory lung cells are subject to the ROS that causes DNA breaks, which subsequently bring about DNA mutagenesis and are intimately linked with carcinogenesis. The damaged cells by oxidative stress are often destroyed through the active apoptotic pathway. However, the ROS also perform critical signaling functions in stress responses, cell survival, and cell proliferation. Some molecules enhance radiation-induced tumor cell killing via the reduction in DNA repair levels. Hence the DNA repair levels may be a novel therapeutic modality in overcoming drug resistance in lung cancer. Either survival or apoptosis, which is determined by the balance between DNA damage and DNA repair levels, may lender the major problems in cancer therapy. The purpose of this paper is to take a closer look at risk factor and at therapy modulation factor in lung cancer relevant to the ROS. ",

Patients treated with current chemotherapies for non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) have a survival rate of approximately 15% after 5 years. Novel approaches are needed to treat this disease. We show elevated NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) levels in tumors from NSCLC patients. beta-Lapachone, an effective chemotherapeutic and radiosensitizing agent, selectively killed NSCLC cells that expressed high levels of NQO1. Isogenic H596 NSCLC cells that lacked or expressed NQO1 along with A549 NSCLC cells treated with or without dicoumarol, were used to elucidate the mechanism of action and optimal therapeutic window of beta-lapachone. NSCLC cells were killed in an NQO1-dependent manner by beta-lapachone (LD50, approximately 4 microM) with a minimum 2-h exposure. Kinetically, beta-lapachone-induced cell death was characterized by the following: (i) dramatic reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, eliciting extensive DNA damage; (ii) hyperactivation of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 (PARP-1); (iii) depletion of NAD+/ATP levels; and (iv) proteolytic cleavage of p53/PARP-1, indicating mu-calpain activation and apoptosis. Beta-lapachone-induced PARP-1 hyperactivation, nucleotide depletion, and apoptosis were blocked by 3-aminobenzamide, a PARP-1 inhibitor, and 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM), a Ca2+ chelator. NQO1- cells (H596, IMR-90) or dicoumarol-exposed NQO1+ A549 cells were resistant (LD50, >40 microM) to ROS formation and all cytotoxic effects of beta-lapachone. Our data indicate that the most efficacious strategy using beta-lapachone in chemotherapy was to deliver the drug in short pulses, greatly reducing cytotoxicity to NQO1- \"normal\" cells. beta-Lapachone killed cells in a tumorselective manner and is indicated for use against NQO1+ NSCLC cancers.",

Specific major or frequent side effects of crizotinib are discussed: visual disturbances, cardiac effects, elevated transaminases, and hypogonadism. In the routine practice, patients should be advised about visual disturbances, especially with regard to driving in low brightness. Digestive disorders related to crizotinib are exceptionally persistent or severe. Dietary measures and symptomatic treatments usually control these disorders. It is recommended to perform an electrocardiogram before introduction of crizotinib, to identify prolonged QT interval. Torsades de pointes may produce dizziness or syncope. Hypogonadism should be considered in case of fatigue, decreased libido, and even depression, taking into account that these symptoms may be related to cancer; testosterone serum level should be measured to identify patients that may be eligible to receive a supplementation. Monitoring of liver function tests, including transaminases and bilirubin, is necessary. To conclude, these practical elements are helpful to optimize treatment with crizotinib in patients with ALK-rearranged lung cancer; in the future, academic initiatives should be taken to study these aspects, based on the monitoring of large cohorts of patients treated with crizotinib.

Dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (DDH1) and thioredoxin knockdowns were prepared by standard techniques.;Cisplatin treatment of a cervical cancer cell line resulted in ROS production with mitochondrial membrane depolarization and phosphorylation of JNK and p38.

Similar results were observed with an ovarian cell line.

Increased sub-G1 phase cells and enhanced PARP cleavage demonstrated that the sequence of CDDP-GA treatment markedly increased apoptosis in comparison with other treatments. Furthermore, the sequential combination could enhance the activation of caspase-3, -8, and 9, increase the expression of Fas and Bax, and decrease the expression of Bcl-2, survivin and X-inhibitor of apoptosis protein (X-IAP) in A549 and NCI-H460 cell lines. In addition, increased apoptosis was correlated with enhanced reactive oxygen species generation. Importantly, it was found that, followed by CDDP treatment, GA could inhibit NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) signalling pathways, which have been validated to reduce ROS release and confer CDDP resistance. The roles of NF-κB and MAPK pathways were further confirmed by using specific inhibitors, which significantly increased ROS release and apoptosis induced by the sequential combination of CDDP and GA. Moreover, our results indicated that the combination of CDDP and GA exerted increased antitumour effects on A549 xenograft models through inhibiting NF-κB, HO-1, and subsequently inducing apoptosis.;Gambogic acid sensitises lung cancer cells to CDDP in vitro and in vivo in NSCLC through inactivation of NF-κB and MAPK/HO-1 signalling pathways, providing a rationale for the combined use of CDDP and GA in lung cancer chemotherapy.",

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is one of the most critical tumor-promoting cytokines in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In our recent study, we confirmed that NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), an important source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in NSCLC cells, promotes malignant progression of NSCLC. However, whether the crosstalk of NOX4 and IL-6 signalings exists in NSCLC remains undentified. In this study, we show that NOX4 expression is positively correlated with IL-6 expression in NSCLC tissues. Exogenous IL-6 treatment significantly enhances NOX4/ROS/Akt signaling in NSCLC cells. NOX4 also enhances IL-6 production and activates IL-6/STAT3 signaling in NSCLC cells. Specifically, NOX4 is confirmed to functionally interplay with IL-6 to promote NSCLC cell proliferation and survival. The in vivo results were similar to those obtained in vitro. These data indicate a novel NOX4-dependent link among IL-6 in the NSCLC microenvironment, oxidative stress in NSCLC cells and autocrined IL-6 in NSCLC cells. NOX4/Akt and IL-6/STAT3 signalings can reciprocally and positively regulate each other, leading to enhanced NSCLC cell proliferation and survival. Therefore, NOX4 may serve as a promising target against NSCLC alone with IL-6 signaling. ",

Combination treatments induced dramatically higher ROS levels compared to treatment with AA and 3-PO alone in NSCLC cells and combination-induced cell death was inhibited by addition of catalase to the medium. Analyses of DNA fragmentation, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, annexin V-binding, and caspase activity demonstrated that AA-induced cell death is caused via the activation of apoptosis and that the combination treatments caused a synergistic induction of apoptosis. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of AA against NSCLC cells and that combinations of AA with 3-PO synergistically induce apoptosis via a ROS-dependent mechanism. These results support further evaluation of pharmacologic concentrations of AA as an adjuvant treatment for NSCLC and that combination of AA with glycolysis inhibitors may be a promising therapy for the treatment of NSCLC.",

In this study, we investigate the effect of GPX on cell proliferation and apoptosis on human Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells in vitro and determine the mechanisms of its action. GPX inhibited the growth of H520 cells in dose- and time-dependent manners, with IC50 values of 3.03 ± 0.21 μM at 48 h. The morphologic characteristics of apoptosis and apoptotic bodies were observed by fluorescence microscope and transmission electron microscope. In addition, Annexin V/PI double staining assay revealed that cells in early stage of apoptosis were significantly increased upon GPX treatment dose-dependently. Rh123 staining assay indicated that GPX reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential. DCFH-DA staining revealed that intracellular ROS increased with GPX treatment. Moreover, GPX cleaved and activated caspase-3. In summary, this study showed that GPX inhibited H520 cell proliferation in dose- and time-dependent manner. Further mechanistic study indicated that GPX induced cell apoptosis through mitochondrial apoptotic pathway accompanying with ROS production. Our results demonstrate the potential application of GPX as an anti-non-small cell lung cancer agent. ",

Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors used primarily for hyperlidpidemia, have been studied for their antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects. However, the effects of simvastatin on pemetrexed-induced apoptosis have not been investigated. In this study, we investigated whether combination treatment with pemetrexed and simvastatin potentiates the apoptotic activity above that is seen with either drug alone in malignant mesothelioma and NSCLC cells. We found that the combination of pemetrexed and simvastatin induced more extensive caspase-dependent apoptosis than either drug alone in malignant mesothelioma cells (MSTO-211) or NSCLC cells (A549). In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in cells treated with both pemetrexed and simvastatin was markedly increased compared to cells treated with either pemetrexed or simvastatin alone. Combination treatment also increased the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, increased cytosolic release of cytochrome c, and altered expression of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP) and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) families of apoptosis related proteins. On the other hand, pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) prevented apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction by pemetrexed and simvastatin. In addition, Bim siRNA conferred protection against apoptosis induced by pemetrexed and simvastatin. These results suggest that combination of pemetrexed and simvastatin potentiates their apoptotic activity beyond that of either drug alone in malignant mesothelioma and lung cancer cells. This activity is mediated through ROS-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction and Bim induction. ",

We found that paclitaxel activated Stat3 in the human lung cancer cell lines PC14PE6AS2 (AS2) and H157, whereas it reduced Stat3 activation in A549 and H460 cells. Pretreatment of AS2 and H157 cells with rotenone, an inhibitor of mitochondrially produced reactive oxygen species (ROS), or carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)-phenylhydrazone (FCCP), a mitochondrial uncoupler, suppressed the paclitaxel-induced activation of Stat3. Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP-2), located in the inner membrane of the mitochondria, can reduce ROS production in conditions of oxidative stress. UCP-2 protein expression in the four cancer cell lines was higher than that in normal lung epithelial cells (NL-20), but its expression was lower in AS2 and H157 cells relative to A549 and H460 cells. Silencing high UCP-2 expression with small interfering RNA (siRNA) in A549 and H460 cells restored paclitaxel-induced Stat3 activation. In addition, paclitaxel-induced Stat3 activation led to the upregulation of survivin and Mcl-1, which in turn facilitated cell survival. Moreover, the CL1-5 subline had lower UCP-2 expression relative to the parental CL1-0 cells. Treatment with paclitaxel activated Stat3 in CL1-5 but not in CL1-0 cells, whereas in CL1-5 cells, the overexpression of UCP-2 with complementary DNA (cDNA) blocked Stat3 activation. In lung cancer patients, low UCP-2 expression in cancer cells was a predictor of a poor response to chemotherapy. Therefore, UCP-2 modulates the ROS/Stat3 signaling pathway and response to chemotherapy treatment in lung cancer cells. Targeting UCP-2, ROS and Stat3 pathways may improve anticancer therapies.",

This study was done to investigate the anticancer effects of zerumbone on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and explored the involvement of p53 signaling. Cell viability was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium assay. Apoptosis was confirmed by annexin-V/propidium iodide staining and caspase activity assay. Mitochondrial membrane potential (Δφm) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were measured by flow cytometry. Depletion of p53 was achieved by transfection of specific small interfering RNA. Gene expression changes were determined by Western blot analysis. Zerumbone treatment caused a dose-dependent inhibition of A549 and H460 NSCLC cell viability. Zerumbone-induced mitochondrial apoptosis of NSCLC cells, evidenced loss of Δφm, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, and activation of caspase-9 and -3. There was increased p53 and Bax expression and ROS production in zerumbone-treated cells. Downregulation of p53 or scavenging ROS interfered with the pro-apoptotic action of zerumbone. Combinational treatment with zerumbone and cisplatin significantly accelerated apoptosis and promoted p53 expression and ROS production in NSCLC cells, compared with each alone. These findings demonstrate that zerumbone induces mitochondrial apoptosis and enhances the susceptibility to cisplatin in NSCLC cells, which are, at least partially, mediated through activation of p53 signaling and promotion of ROS generation. This study may provide a rationale for the potential clinical application of zerumbone as a chemotherapeutic agent against NSCLC. ",

PKD activation induced by PDB in these SCLC cell lines was completely abrogated by treatment of the cells with the PKC inhibitor GF 109203X (GF I) at concentrations (0.5-2.5 microM) that did not inhibit PKD activity when added directly to the in vitro kinase assays. Treatment with the biologically active phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or with membrane-permeable diacylglycerols also stimulated PKD activation, which was also completely prevented by prior exposure of the cells to GF I. The PKC inhibitors Ro 31-8220 and Go 7874 also blocked PKD activation in response to PDB. Addition of the autocrine growth factor bombesin to cultures of H 345 cells induced significant PKD activation that also was prevented by GF I.

Cell killing by ionizing radiation is mediated primarily through the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ROS-driven oxidative stress. Prx1, a peroxiredoxin family member, was shown to be frequently elevated in lung cancer cells and tissues. Although the antioxidant function of Prx1 is expected to affect the radiotherapy response of lung cancer, the physiologic significance of its peroxidase activity in irradiated cells is unclear because the catalytic Cys52 is easily inactivated by ROS due to its overoxidation to sulfinic or sulfonic acid. In this study, we investigated the role of Prx1 in radiation sensitivity of human lung cancer cells, with special emphasis on the redox status of the catalytic Cys52. We found that overexpression of Prx1 enhances the clonogenic survival of irradiated cells and suppresses ionizing radiation-induced c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activation and apoptosis. The peroxidase activity of Prx1, however, is not essential for inhibiting JNK activation. The latter effect is mediated through its association with the glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTpi)-JNK complex, thereby preventing JNK release from the complex. Reduced JNK activation is observed when the peroxidase activity of Prx1 is compromised by Cys52 overoxidation or in the presence of the Cys52 to Ser52 mutant (Prx1C52S) lacking peroxidase activity. We show that both Prx1 and Prx1C52S interact with the GSTpi-JNK complex and suppress the release of JNK from the complex. Our study provides new insight into the antiapoptotic function of Prx1 in modulating radiosensitivity and provides the impetus to monitor the influence of Prx1 levels in the management of lung cancer.",

However, little is known regarding the effect of moscatilin on cancer cell migration and invasion. The present study demonstrates that nontoxic concentrations of moscatilin were able to inhibit human nonsmall cell lung cancer H23 cell migration and invasion. The inhibitory effect of moscatilin was associated with an attenuation of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS), in which hydroxyl radical (OH(∙)) was identified as a dominant species in the suppression of filopodia formation. Western blot analysis also revealed that moscatilin downregulated activated focal adhesion kinase (phosphorylated FAK, Tyr 397) and activated ATP-dependent tyrosine kinase (phosphorylated Akt, Ser 473), whereas their parental counterparts were not detectable changed.

Apoptosis was detected by annexin V/propidium iodide double-labeled flow cytometry and TUNEL assay. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by flow cytometry. Activity of NF-κB was examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and luciferase reporter assay. Western blotting was used to assess the expression of both NF-κB regulated apoptotic-related gene and activation of p65 and IκBκ.;Plumbagin dose-dependently inhibited proliferation of the lung cancer cells. The IC50 values of plumbagin in A549, H292, and H460 cells were 10.3 μmol/L, 7.3 μmol/L, and 6.1 μmol/L for 12 hours, respectively. The compound concentration-dependently induced apoptosis of the three cell lines. Treatment with plumbagin increased the intracellular level of ROS, and inhibited the activation of NK-κB. In addition to inhibition of NF-κB/p65 nuclear translocation, the compound also suppressed the degradation of IκBκ. ROS scavenger NAC highly reversed the effect of plumbagin on apoptosis and inactivation of NK-κB in H460 cell line.

Numerous studies have shown that CTD induced cytotoxic effects on cancer cells. However, there is no report to demonstrate that CTD induced apoptosis in human lung cancer cells. Herein, we investigated the effect of CTD on the cell death via the induction of apoptosis in H460 human lung cancer cells. Flow cytometry assay was used for examining the percentage of cell viability, sub-G1 phase of the cell cycle, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca²⁺ productions and the levels of mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψm). Annexin V/PI staining and DNA gel electrophoresis were also used for examining cell apoptosis. Western blot analysis was used to examine the changes of apoptosis associated protein expression and confocal microscopy for examining the translocation apoptosis associated protein. Results indicated that CTD significantly induced cell morphological changes and decreased the percentage of viable H460 cells. CTD induced apoptosis based on the occurrence of sub-G1 phase and DNA fragmentation. We found that CTD increased gene expression (mRNA) of caspase-3 and -8. Moreover, CTD increased ROS and Ca2+ production and decreased the levels of ∆Ψm. Western blot analysis results showed that CTD increased the expression of cleavage caspase-3 and -8, cytochrome c, Bax and AIF but inhibited the levels of Bcl-xL. CTD promoted ER stress associated protein expression such as GRP78, IRE1α, IRE1β, ATF6α and caspase-4 and it also promoted the expression of calpain 2 and XBP-1, but inhibited calpain 1 that is associated with apoptosis pathways. Based on those observations, we suggest that CTD may be used as a novel anticancer agent for the treatment of lung cancer in the future.",

The results demonstrated enhanced cell death following combination treatment of SWNT/GO and Tx indicating a synergistic effect. In addition, synergism was abrogated in the presence of an anti-oxidant, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), and was therefore shown to be reactive oxygen species (ROS) dependent. It was further demonstrated using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay that treatment with CNs was associated with enhanced mitogen associated protein kinase (MAPK) activation that was ROS mediated.

Although antagonist G blocks SCLC cell growth (IC50 = 24.5 +/- 1.5 and 38.5 +/- 1.5 microM for the H69 and H510 cell lines respectively), its exact mechanism of action is unclear. This study shows that antagonist G stimulates apoptosis as assessed by morphology (EC50 = 5.9 +/- 0.1 and 15.2 +/- 2.7 microM for the H69 and H510 cell lines respectively) and stimulates c-jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity in SCLC cells (EC50 = 3.2 +/- 0.1 and 15.2 +/- 2.7 microM). This activity is neuropeptide-independent, but dependent on the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and is inhibited by the free radical scavenger n-acetyl cysteine. Furthermore, antagonist G itself induces inflammation (59% increase in oedema volume compared to control) and potentiates (by 35-40%) bradykinin-induced oedema formation in vivo. In view of these results we show that, as well as acting as a 'broad-spectrum' neuropeptide antagonist, antagonist G stimulates basal G-protein activity in SCLC cell membranes (81 +/- 12% stimulation at 10 microM), thereby displaying a unique ability to stimulate certain signal transduction pathways by activating G-proteins.

Diazeniumdiolate-based nitric oxide (NO)-releasing prodrugs are a growing class of promising NO-based therapeutics. Here, we show that O(2)-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-1-[(4-ethoxycarbonyl)piperazin-1-yl]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (JS-K) is a potent cytotoxic agent against a subset of human non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines both in vitro and as xenografts in mice. JS-K treatment led to 75% reduction in the growth of H1703 lung adenocarcinoma cells in vivo. Differences in sensitivity to JS-K in different lung cancer cell lines seem to be related to their endogenous levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS)/reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Other related factors, levels of peroxiredoxin 1 (PRX1) and 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine glycosylase (OGG1), also correlated with drug sensitivity. Treatment of the lung adenocarcinoma cells with JS-K resulted in oxidative/nitrosative stress in cells with high basal levels of ROS/RNS, which, combined with the arylating properties of the compound, was reflected in glutathione depletion and alteration in cellular redox potential, mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, and cytochrome c release. Inactivation of manganese superoxide dismutase by nitration was associated with increased superoxide and significant DNA damage. Apoptosis followed these events. Taken together, the data suggest that diazeniumdiolate-based NO-releasing prodrugs may have application as a personalized therapy for lung cancers characterized by high levels of ROS/RNS.

Several lung adenocarcinoma (LAD) cell lines were screened to characterize epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression and mutation profile. To circumvent intrinsic variations between cell lines with respect to response to drug treatments, we generated gefitinib-resistant H1650 clone by long-term, chronic culture under gefitinib selection of parental cell line. Isogenic cells were analyzed by microarray, Western blot, flow cytometry, and confocal and transmission electron microscope. We observed that although chronic gefitinib treatment provided effective action against its primary target (aberrant EGFR activity), secondary effects resulted in increased cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Gefitinib-mediated ROS correlated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition, as well as striking perturbation of mitochondrial morphology and function. However, gefitinib treatment in the presence of ROS scavenger provided a partial rescue of mitochondrial aberrations. Furthermore, withdrawal of gefitinib from previously resistant clones correlated with normalized expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition genes.

Subsequent studies revealed that activity of AKT and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) were downregulated during autophagy. Furthermore, SPC failed to promote autophagy in p53 deleted cells. Thus SPC induced autophagy in non-small cell lung cancer cells was through AKT/mTORC1 and P53 signal pathway. Besides, SPC reduced both the mitochondria membrane potential and ROS level in A549 cells.

We have shown that cisplatin-resistant tumors have higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and can be exploited for targeted therapy. Here, we show that increased secretion of the antioxidant thioredoxin-1 (TRX1) resulted in lowered intracellular TRX1 and contributed to higher ROS in cisplatin-resistant tumors in vivo and in vitro. By reconstituting TRX1 protein in cisplatin-resistant cells, we increased sensitivity to cisplatin but decreased sensitivity to elesclomol (ROS inducer). Conversely, decreased TRX1 protein in parental cells reduced the sensitivity to cisplatin but increased sensitivity to elesclomol. Cisplatin-resistant cells had increased endogenous oxygen consumption and mitochondrial activity but decreased lactic acid production. They also exhibited higher levels of argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) and fumarase mRNA, which contributed to oxidative metabolism (OXMET) when compared with parental cells. Restoring intracellular TRX1 protein in cisplatin-resistant cells resulted in lowering ASS and fumarase mRNAs, which in turn sensitized them to arginine deprivation. Interestingly, cisplatin-resistant cells also had significantly higher basal levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS). Overexpressing TRX1 lowered ACC and FAS proteins expressions in cisplatin-resistant cells. Chemical inhibition and short interfering RNA of ACC resulted in significant cell death in cisplatin-resistant compared with parental cells. Conversely, TRX1 overexpressed cisplatin-resistant cells resisted 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid (TOFA)-induced death. Collectively, lowering TRX1 expression through increased secretion leads cisplatin-resistant cells to higher ROS production and increased dependency on OXMET. These changes raise an intriguing therapeutic potential for future therapy in cisplatin-resistant lung cancer.",

Accumulating evidence indicates that inhibition of LDH-A induces apoptosis mediated by oxidative stress in cancer cells. To date, it's still unclear that whether autophagy can be induced by LDH-A inhibition. Here, we investigated the effects of oxamate, one classic inhibitor of LDH-A in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells as well as normal lung epithelial cells. The results showed that oxamate significantly suppressed the proliferation of NSCLC cells, while it exerted a much lower toxicity in normal cells. As previous studies reported, LDH-A inhibition resulted in ATP reduction and ROS (reactive oxygen species) burst in cancer cells, which lead to apoptosis and G2/M arrest in H1395 cells. However, when being exposed to oxamate, A549 cells underwent autophagy as a protective mechanism against apoptosis. Furthermore, we found evidence that LDH-A inhibition induced G0/G1 arrest dependent on the activation of GSK-3β in A549 cells. Taken together, our results provide useful clues for targeting LDH-A in NSCLC treatment and shed light on the discovery of molecular predictors for the sensitivity of LDH-A inhibitors. ",

Erlotinib, a small-molecule epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase (EGFR-TK) inhibitor, has been approved for the management of advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether erlotinib exerts potent antitumour activities through the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway in the human non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549. 2. The 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2 thiazoyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and Hoechst 33342 staining showed that erlotinib produced a decline in cell viability of A549 cells and induced cell apoptosis, coupled with quick accumulation of ROS. In addition, erlotinib increased the respiratory control ratio, NADPH oxidase catalytic subunit gp91(phox) expression and superoxide anion (O2(-)) generation, suggesting that erlotinib induced ROS production in A549 cells from both mitochondrial and NADPH oxidase sources. 3. Fluorescence microscopy with the JC-1 probe and western blot analysis indicated that erlotinib induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, the release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and activation of JNK. 4. The results of the present study suggest that erlotinib has potent antitumour activity in A549 cells by activating ROS-dependent, JNK-driven cell apoptosis. These findings provide a novel insight into the mechanism of action of erlotinib in the treatment of human non-small cell lung cancer in addition to its effects in inhibiting EGFR-TK.",

The mechanism of drug resistance to cisplatin is complex and historically has been difficult to overcome. We report here that cisplatin resistant lung cancer cell lines possess high basal levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) when compared to normal cells and their parental cell counterparts. These resistant cells also have low thioredoxin (TRX) levels which may be one of the contributory factors to high ROS. N'(1),N'(3)-dimethyl-N'(1),N'(3)-bis(phenylcarbonothioyl) propanedihydrazide (elesclomol), an agent known to increase ROS is selectively toxic to cisplatin-resistant cells, while sparing normal cells and the parental counterpart. The cytotoxic effect of elesclomol in resistant cells is accompanied by further decreases in TRX and glutathione (GSH) antioxidant systems, while opposite results were found in parental cells. The ID(50) of elesclomol in cisplatin-resistant cells ranged from 5-10 nM, which is well within clinically achievable ranges. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), which is known to neutralize ROS, can abolish the cytotoxic effect of elesclomol, suggesting that the cytotoxic effect results from increased ROS. Overall, our data suggest that elesclomol selectively kills cisplatin-resistant tumor cells through increased ROS. This agent may hold potential to overcome cisplatin resistance and should be further explored to treat patients who have failed cisplatin therapy.",

Recently (Hemström et al., Exp Cell Res 2005;305:200-13) we showed that apoptosis of U1810 NSCLC cells induced by the staurosporine analog PKC 412 correlated with inhibition of Akt and ERK1/2, suggesting the involvement of these kinases in cell survival. Here we investigated the contribution of the PI3-kinase/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways to survival of NSCLC cells. The two signaling pathways were studied by using different combinations of the PI3-kinase inhibitors LY-294002 and wortmannin, the Akt activator Ro 31-8220, the MEK inhibitor PD 98059 and PKC 412. PI3-kinase inhibitors induced apoptosis-like death in U1810 cells. H157 cells in general were relatively resistant to PI3 kinase/Akt inhibitors yet these compounds sensitized cells to the DNA-damaging drug VP-16, while Ro 31-8220 could not. PD 98059 only had a sensitizing effect on H157 cells when combined with PI3-kinase inhibition and VP-16. Morphological data indicated that LY-294002 and PKC 412 induced cell death at anaphase and metaphase, respectively, suggesting death by mitotic catastrophe. Analyzes of cells blocked in G2/M-phase by nocodazol revealed that LY-294002 increased, while PKC 412 decreased histone H3 phosphorylation, suggesting that LY-294002 allowed, while PKC 412 inhibited cells to leave M-phase. Flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle distribution demonstrated that LY-294002 allowed cells to leave G2/M phase, while PKC 412 inhibited cytokinesis, resulting in formation of multinucleated cells. These results indicate that sensitization of NSCLC cells by PI3-kinase inhibition involves interplay between cell cycle regulation, mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis.",

Cell apoptosis was evaluated using flow cytometry and TUNEL assay. Cell necrosis was evaluated with LDH assay. The expression of apoptosis- or autophagy-associated proteins was measured using Western blotting. The formation of acidic compartments was detected using AO staining, neutral red staining and Lysotracker-Red staining. LC3 punctae were analyzed with fluorescence microscopy.;Treatment with 3,4,4'-THS (10-80 μmol/L) concentration-dependently inhibited the cell viability. It did not cause cell necrosis, but induced apoptosis accompanied by up-regulation of cleavaged PARP, caspase3/9 and Bax, and by down-regulation of Bcl-2 and surviving. It also increased the formation of acidic compartments, LC3-II accumulation and GFP-LC3 labeled autophagosomes in the cells. It inhibited the mTOR-dependent pathway, but did not impair autophagic flux. 3,4,4'-THS-induced cell death was enhanced by the autophagy inhibitors 3-MA (5 mmol/L) or Wortmannin (2 μmol/L). Moreover, 3,4,4'-THS treatment elevated the ROS levels in the cells, and co-treatment with 3-MA further elevated the ROS levels. 3,4,4'-THS-induced apoptosis and autophagy in the cells was attenuated by NAC (10 mmol/L)Conclusion:3,4,4'-THS induces both apoptosis and autophagy in NSCLC A549 cells in vitro.

        "Doc_abstract":"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been postulated to render cancer cells resistant to apoptosis based on the Warburg hypothesis. However, few studies have investigated the prognostic value of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content and G10398A polymorphism in NSCLC patients. mtDNA copy number and G10398A polymorphism in 128 NSCLC tissue samples were assessed by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and PCR-RFLP respectively, and their relationship to prognosis were analyzed by survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards model. In vitro, an mtDNA deletion A549 ρ(0) cell model was utilized to assess the function of mtDNA on radiosensitivity. Cell cycle distribution and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were analyzed to elucidate the potential mechanisms. For the whole group, the median follow-up time and overall survival time were 22.5 and 23.4 months, respectively. Patients with high mtDNA content had a marginally longer survival time than patients with low mtDNA content (P=0.053). Moreover, patients with high mtDNA content plus 10398G had a significantly longer overall survival time compared with those having low mtDNA content plus 10398A (47 vs. 27 months, P<0.05). In addition, multivariate analysis showed that stage and low mtDNA content plus 10398A were the two most independent prognostic factors. In vitro, the A549 ρ(0) cells showed more resistance to radiation than ρ(+) cells. Following radiation, ρ(0) cells showed delayed G2 arrest and lower ROS level as compared to ρ(+) cells. In conclusion, the present study suggests that in patients with NSCLC, low mtDNA content plus 10398A could be a marker of poor prognosis which is associated with resistance to anticancer treatment caused by low mtDNA content plus 10398A polymorphism resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction.",

As a control group, 202 patients with adenocarcinomas (ADCs) and 122 patients with squamous cell carcinomas (SQCCs) were also analyzed. All the tumors were stained with antibodies for 10 RTKs: c-Kit, EGFR, IGF1R, KDR, ERBB2, FGFR1, c-Met, ALK, RET, and ROS1.;The LCNEC and SCLC patients exhibited similar clinicopathological characteristics. The IHC scores for each RTK were almost equivalent between the LCNEC and SCLC groups, but they were significantly different from those of the ADC or SQCC groups. In particular, c-Kit was the only RTK that was remarkably expressed in both LCNECs and SCLCs. On the other hand, about 20 % of the HGNEC tumors exhibited strongly positive RTK expression, and this rate was similar to those for the ADC and SQCC tumors. Intriguingly, strongly positive RTKs were almost mutually exclusive in individual tumors.;Compared with ADC or SQCC, LCNEC and SCLC had similar expression profiles for the major RTKs. The exclusive c-Kit positivity observed among HGNECs suggests that c-Kit might be a distinctive RTK in HGNEC.",

In this study, we aim to investigate the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in TKI resistance as well as the molecular and biological effects of EGFR(T790M) after redox manipulation.;The basal ROS levels in EGFR(T790M)-containing TKI-resistant NSCLC cell lines were substantially high. Sixty-three human lung tumors showed higher NADPH oxidase isoform 2 (NOX2) expression than normal lung tissues, which may contribute to high basal ROS in cancer and poor survival. Interestingly, only NOX3 was upregulated by sanguinarine, a pharmacological agent to elevate ROS, and resulted in EGFR overoxidation, degradation, and apoptosis. By contrast, such responses were lacking in EGFR(WT) cells. Selective EGFR(T790M) degradation was manipulated by redox imbalance between NOX3 and methionine reductase A (MsrA). Furthermore, the in vivo tumor suppression effect of sanguinarine, NOX3 upregulation, and EGFR degradation were confirmed.;We have found a new treatment strategy to overcome TKI resistance by selectively inducing EGFR(T790M) degradation via specific stimulation of methionine 790 (M790) oxidation. It can be achieved via manipulating redox imbalance between NOX3 and MsrA.;Targeting EGFR by elevating ROS and redox imbalance is a potential new strategy to develop a new EGFR inhibitor for TKI-resistant patients with a wide therapeutic window between EGFR(T790M) and EGFR(WT).",

In the present study, we evaluated the effects of SBHA on the growth and death of A549 lung cancer cells. SBHA inhibited the growth of A549 cells with an IC(50) of approximately 50 μM at 72 h in a dose-dependent manner. DNA flow cytometric analysis indicated that SBHA induced a G2/M phase arrest of the cell cycle. This agent also induced apoptosis, as evidenced by sub-G1 cells and annexin V-FITC staining cells. SBHA-induced apoptosis was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP; ΔΨ(m)), Bcl-2 decrease, Bax increase, and the activation of caspase-3. All of the tested caspase inhibitors significantly rescued some cells from SBHA-induced A549 cell death. However, none of the caspase inhibitors prevented the loss of MMP (ΔΨ(m)) induced by SBHA. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels including O(2)(•-) were increased in 50 μM SBHA-treated A549 cells. None of the caspase inhibitors attenuated ROS levels in these cells. SBHA also elevated the number of glutathione (GSH)-depleted cells in A549 cells, which was reduced by treatment with caspase inhibitors. In conclusion, this is the first report that SBHA inhibited the growth of A549 lung cancer cells via caspase-dependent apoptosis, which was related to GSH depletion rather than changes in ROS level.",

The aim of this study was to investigate any connection between ERRalpha activity and cell population growth.;XCT-790, an ERRa specific inverse agonist, was employed to suppress ERRa activity in human non-small cell lung cancer cells (NSCLC) A549. Gene expressions were detected using quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. Mitochondrial mass, membrane potential and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were measured by staining with Mitotracker green, JC-1 and CM-H(2)DCFDA dyes respectively. Rate of progression through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle was analysed by measuring activities of citrate synthase and succinate dehydrogenase. Cell cycle analysis was performed by using flow cytometry.;We found that XCT-790 treatment reduced mitochondrial mass but enhanced mitochondrial ROS production by increasing rate through the TCA cycle, elevating mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) and down-regulating expression of superoxide dismutase. It was further demonstrated that XCT-790-induced ROS modulated p53 and Rb signalling pathways and suppressed cell replication.;ERRalpha affects cell cycle mechanisms through modulating mitochondrial mass and function. Dysregulation of this essential pathway leads to elevation in mitochondrial ROS production, which in turn modulates activities of tumour suppressors, resulting in cell cycle arrest.",

Combination index (CI) values were calculated based on Chou-Talalay median-effect analyses. Dose reduction index (DRI) values were applied to calculate dose reduction of selenite. Contents of free thiols and GSH were determined by DTNB assay and intracellular ROS levels by DCFH-DA fluorescence labeling.;Compared with BBSKE or selenite single treatment, the combined application of ethaselen and a low fixed dose of selenite shortened the onset time of sodium selenite, reduced IC50 values, and increased the maximum inhibition rates, suggesting a possible molecular mechanism of the synergism. Obvious synergistic effects were observed after different times of combination treatment, especially after 24 h. Compared with selenite single treatment, dosage of selenite could be remarkably reduced in combination therapy to gain the same inhibitory effect on cell proliferation. Compared with BBSKE single treatment, the content of free thiols and GSH were significantly reduced and ROS levels greatly elevated in the combination group. For the combination treatment, cell viability increased as greater concentrations of GSH were added.;All these results indicate that the combination treatment of BBSKE and selenite showed synergism to inhibit A549 cell proliferation in vitro, and also reduced the selenite dosage to mitigate its toxicity which is very meaningful for combination chemotherapy of lung cancer. The synergism was probably caused by the accelerated exhaustion of intracellular reductive substances, such as free thiols and GSH, which ultimately leads to enhanced oxidative stress and apoptosis.",

Cabozantinib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, targets MET, VEGFR, RET, ROS1, and AXL, which are implicated in lung cancer tumorigenesis. We compared the efficacy of cabozantinib alone or in combination with erlotinib versus erlotinib alone in patients with EGFR wild-type NSCLC.;This three group, randomised, controlled, open-label, multicentre, phase 2 trial was done in 37 academic and community oncology practices in the USA. Patients were eligible if they had received one or two previous treatments for advanced non-squamous, EGFR wild-type, NSCLC. Patients were stratified by performance status and line of therapy, and randomly assigned using permuted blocks within strata to receive open-label oral daily dosing of erlotinib (150 mg), cabozantinib (60 mg), or erlotinib (150 mg) and cabozantinib (40 mg). Imaging was done every 8 weeks. At the time of radiographic progression, there was optional crossover for patients in either single-drug group to receive combination treatment. The primary endpoint was to compare progression-free survival in patients given erlotinib alone versus cabozantinib alone, and in patients given erlotinib alone versus the combination of erlotinib plus cabozantinib. We assessed the primary endpoint in the per-protocol population, which was defined as all patients who were eligible, randomly assigned, and received at least one dose of treatment.

In the present study, we investigated whether the PKCα/Nox-2/ATF-2/MMP-9 signaling pathway is involved in the invasive behavior of lung cancer and whether curcumin could inhibit invasion by modulating this pathway. The cytotoxic effect of curcumin was evaluated by MTT assay and the capacity of invasion was assessed by Transwell assay. siRNA and plasmid transfection techniques were used to study the function of targeted genes. Real-time PCR and western blot analysis were used to evaluate the expression levels of PKCα, Nox-2, MMP-9 and the phosphorylation of ATF-2. The results showed that curcumin inhibited the proliferation and invasion of A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Overexpression of MMP-9 enhanced the invasion of A549 cells. However, inhibition of MMP-9 by siRNA or curcumin suppressed cell invasion. Moreover, we also demonstrated the catalytic role of PKCα in expression of MMP-9 and cellular invasion in A549 cells, which was dependent on the expression of Nox-2 and phosphorylation of ATF-2. Finally, we also showed that curcumin dose-dependently reduced the expression of PKCα, P47phox, Nox-2 and phosphorylated ATF-2, as well as intracellular ROS generation, suggesting the inhibitory effect of curcumin on the activation of the PKCα/Nox-2/ROS/ATF-2 pathway.

The cytotoxicity of Tan-IIA in H146 cells was measured using the MTT assay. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca2+ in H146 cells were detected by flow cytometry, and the protein expression of Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, NF-κBp65, GADD153 and β-actin in H146 cells was measured by Western blotting. H146 cells were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. The protein expression of GADD153 and Caspase-3 was increased, but the proto-oncogene bcl-2 was notably decreased in H146 cells treated with Tan-IIA (5 µg/ml) for 24 h. FACS showed that Tan-IIA may increase the production of ROS and Ca2+, but decreases MMP. The results indicate that Tan-IIA is capable of inhibiting the proliferation of H146 cells. One of the molecular mechanisms behind this effect may be the induction of ROS release and the decrease in MMP caused by an increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Another may involve endoplasmic reticulum stress caused by the release of Ca2+ and an increase in GADD153 expression followed by a decrease in Bcl-2 expression, which induces a higher ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, in turn causing a decrease in MMP and leading to an increase in Caspase-3 expression and the inhibition of H146 cells. Thus, Tan-IIA may be a promising novel chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of human small cell lung cancer H146 cells.",

The combined PPARγ ligand/γ-radiation treatment triggered caspase-8 activation, and this initiator caspase played an important role in the combination-induced apoptosis. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ ligands may enhance the γ-radiation-induced DNA damage response, possibly by increasing γ-H2AX expression. Moreover, the combination treatment significantly increased ROS generation, and the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine inhibited the combined treatment-induced ROS generation and apoptotic cell death.;Taken together, these results indicated that the combined treatment of PPARγ ligands and γ-radiation synergistically induced DNA damage and apoptosis, which was regulated by ROS.",

Fifty percent inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 3',4',5',7'‑tetrahydroxyflavone (luteolin) against NCI‑H460 and ‑H1299 non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells were determined using 3‑(4,5‑dimethylthiazol‑2‑yl)‑2,5‑diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. Radiosensitizing activity was assessed in vitro by treating cells with luteolin prior to irradiation of γ‑ionizing radiation (IR), and performing cell count and clonogenic assays. Cell signaling pathways involved in the radiosensitizing effects of luteolin were examined using propidium iodide (PI) uptake, reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection and immunoblot assays, with or without specific chemical inhibitors. Apoptotic cell death was confirmed by PI uptake and immunoblot assays. In vivo radiosensitizing activity was tested using an NCI‑H460 cell xenograft model in nude mice. Tumor size was measured and apoptosis was determined with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay in animals in four treatment groups: mock‑treated control, luteolin only, IR only, and luteolin plus IR. Treatment with luteolin or IR induced NSCLC cell death in vitro, but the combination of luteolin pre‑treatment and IR was more effective than either agent alone, yielding dose enhancement ratios (DERs) of 1.22 and 1.35 for NCI‑H460 and ‑H1299 cells, respectively. Combined treatment with luteolin and IR enhanced apoptotic cell death in association with downregulation of B‑cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2) and activation of caspase‑3, ‑8, and ‑9; it also induced phosphorylation of p38 mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK) and ROS accumulation. Inhibition of p38 MAPK decreased ROS production, and inhibition of either p38 MAPK or ROS production attenuated apoptotic cell death and activation of caspase‑8 and ‑9. In a xenograft model, tumor growth was delayed by 21.8 days in the luteolin/IR combination group compared with controls, and apoptotic cell death was increased. The enhancement factor of the luteolin and IR combination was 1.83. Collectively, these findings indicate that luteolin acts as a radiosensitizer by enhancing apoptotic cell death through activation of a p38/ROS/caspase cascade.",

Treatment with MG132 inhibited the growth of A549 cells with an IC(50) of approximately 20 microM at 24 hours. DNA flow cytometric analysis indicated that 0.5 approximately 30 microM MG132 induced a G1 phase arrest of the cell cycle in A549 cells. Treatment with 10 or 30 microM MG132 also induced apoptosis, as evidenced by sub-G1 cells and annexin V staining cells. This was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP; Delta psi m). The intracellular ROS levels including O(2) (*-) were strongly increased in 10 or 30 microM MG132-treated A549 cells but were down-regulated in 0.1, 0.5 or 1 microM MG132-treated cells.

Examples of such aberrations are EGFR mutation and ALK fusion. Lung adenocarcinoma harboring such mutations can be treated with anticancer drugs that target the aberrant gene products. Additional oncogene aberrations, including RET, ROS1, and NRG1 fusions, skipping of exon 14 of MET, and mutations in BRAF, HER2, NF1, and MEK1, were recently added to the list of such \"druggable\" driver oncogene aberrations, and their responses to targeted therapies are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. However, approximately 30% and 50% of LADCs in patients in Japan and Europe/USA, respectively, lack the driver oncogene aberrations listed above. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies, such as those that exploit the vulnerabilities of cancer cells with non-oncogene aberrations, are urgently required.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of essential element zinc on EMT characteristics in lung cancer cells.;The effect of zinc on EMT was evaluated by determining the EMT behaviors using migration, invasion and colony formation assay. EMT markers were examined by western blot analysis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by specific fluorescence dyes and flow cytometry. All results were analyzed by ANOVA, followed by individual comparisons with post hoc test.;The present study has revealed for the first time that the zinc could induce EMT and related metastatic behaviors in lung cancer cells. Results showed that treatment of the cells with zinc resulted in the significant increase of EMT markers N-cadherin, vimentin, snail and slug and decrease of E-cadherin proteins. Zinc-treated cells exhibited the mesenchymal-like morphology and increased cancer cell motility with significant increase of activated FAK, Rac1, and RhoA. Also, tumorigenic abilities of lung cancer cells could be enhanced by zinc. Importantly, the underlying mechanism was found to be caused by the ability of zinc to generate intracellular superoxide anion. Zinc was shown to induce cellular superoxide anion generation and the up-regulation of EMT markers and the induced cell migration and invasion in zinc-treated cells could be attenuated by the treatment of MnTBAP, a specific superoxide anion inhibitor.;Knowledge gains from this study may highlight the roles of this important element in the regulation of EMT and cancer metastasis and fulfill the understanding in the area of cancer cell biology.",

More recently, several oncogenes have been shown to activate Nrf2 signaling as the main prosurvival pathway mediating ROS detoxification, senescence evasion, and neoplastic transformation. Thus, it is important to determine if there is any risk of enhanced lung tumorigenesis associated with prolonged administration of SFN using mouse models of cancer.;We evaluated the effect of prolonged SFN treatment on oncogenic K-ras (K-ras(LSL-G12D))-driven lung tumorigenesis. One week post mutant-K-ras expression, mice were treated with SFN (0.5 mg, 5 d/wk) for 3 months by means of a nebulizer. Fourteen weeks after mutant K-ras expression (K-ras(LSL-G12D)), mice were sacrificed, and lung sections were screened for neoplastic foci. Expression of Nrf2-dependent genes was measured using real time RT-PCR. We also determined the effect of prolonged SFN treatment on the growth of preclinical xenograft models using human A549 (with mutant K-ras and Keap1 allele) and H1975 [with mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) allele] nonsmall cell lung cancer cells.;Systemic SFN administration did not promote the growth of K-ras(LSL-G12D)-induced lung tumors and had no significant effect on the growth of A549 and H1975 established tumor xenografts in nude mice.

Atorvastatin administration could significantly inhibit VEGF expression both in vitro and in vivo via inhibition of ROS production.

Specifically, atorvastatin could upregulate the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase, which are responsible for elimination of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) in the mitochondria and peroxisomes, respectively. Thus, inhibition of ROS production by concomitant suppression of Rac1/NADPH oxidase activity and upregulation of the activity of GPx and catalase contributes critically to atorvastatin-reduced VEGF expression in NSCLCs.

In this study, 10 RTs, 1 RO, and 1 RD performed a manual tumor alignment and correction of the planning GTV to a treatment CBCT to generate an isocenter correction distance for 15 patient data sets. Participants also contoured the GTV on the same data sets. The isocenter correction distance and the contoured GTVs from the RTs were compared with the RD and RO.

Different concentrations of curcumin were used for different durations in NCI-H460 cells and the subsequent changes in the cell morphology, viability, cell cycle, mRNA and protein expressions were determined. Curcumin induced apoptotic morphologic changes in NCI-H460 cells in a dose-dependent manner. After curcumin treatment, BAX and BAD were up-regulated, BCL-2, BCL-X(L) and XIAP were down-regulated. In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS), intracellular Ca(2+) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress were increased in NCI-H460 cells after exposure to curcumin. These signals led to a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psi(m)) and culminated in caspase-3 activation. Curcumin-induced apoptosis was also stimulated through the FAS/caspase-8 (extrinsic) pathway and ER stress proteins, growth arrest- and DNA damage-inducible gene 153 (GADD153) and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) were activated in the NCI-H460 cells.

Recent advances in multiplex genotyping based on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) provide a strong and non-invasive alternative for detection of the resistance mechanism.;Here we report a multiple metastatic NSCLC patient who was detected to have pure EGFR 19 exon deletion (negative for EML4-ALK and ROS1 in both IHC-based and sequencing assay) in the primary lesion and responded to first-line and second-line EGFR-TKI treatments (erlotinib then HY-15772). At 8 months, most lesions remained well controlled except for the liver metastases which presented dramatic progression. Considering the high risk of bleeding in rebiopsy of hepatic lesions, we conducted a multiplex genomic profiling with ctDNA. Results reported coexistence of EGFR mutation and EML4-ALK gene translocation in plasma which heavily indicated that ALK was the primary reason for progression of the liver lesions. This deduction was supported by the repeated response to ALK inhibitors (crizotinib then AP26113) of the hepatic metastases.;This is the first report of the existence of ALK rearrangement in metastatic lesions in an EGFR mutated patient. It highlighted the feasibility and advantages of using ctDNA multiplex genotyping in identifying the heterogeneity across lesions and the resistance mechanism of targeted treatments.",

The main biochemical and molecular alterations that are responsible for the syndrome are prematurely present in the progress of the disease and the identification of the early stages of cachexia can be useful in targetting patients who will benefit from early treatment. The aim of the present study was to delineate the bio-humoral profile of a group of lung cancer patients either non-cachectic or cachectic by evaluating serum pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress/antioxidant parameters (both recognized to be involved in cachexia pathogenesis) and pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression in PBMC (Peripheral blood mononuclear cells) of cancer patients. All serum pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress/antioxidant parameters significantly increased in neoplastic patients, but only TNF-alpha, ROS, GSH and vitamin E showed a significantly greater increase in cachectic patients. Pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression mirrored serum level behaviour except for IL-6 that was increased in serum but not as gene expression, suggesting its provenience from tumour tissue. Our data support that the simultaneous determination of ROS, GSH, vitamin E, together with TNF-alpha allows the identification of a lung cancer patient developing cancer-related cachexia. This bio-humoral profile should be used for the early diagnosis and follow-up of the syndrome. Moreover, the evaluation of gene expression in patient PBMC was helpful in differentiating tumour vs host factors, therefore being useful in the study of pathogenetic mechanisms in neoplastic cachectic patients.",

Exogenous miR-21 regulation was achieved through inhibitor or mimic transfection.;Compared with relative sham-radiation-conditioned medium, radiation-conditioned medium (RCM) from irradiated cells 1 h post radiation (1-h RCM) caused an increase in ROS levels and DNA damage in bystander cells, while 18-h RCM induced cell cycle delay and proliferation inhibition. All these effects were eliminated by TGF-βR1 inhibition. One-hour RCM upregulated miR-21 expression in bystander cells, and miR-21 inhibitor abolished bystander oxidative stress and DNA damage. Eighteen-hour RCM downregulated miR-21 of bystander cells, and miR-21 mimic eliminated bystander proliferation inhibition.

A decision board outlining the various advantages and disadvantages apparent in the Medical Research Council study of Fx schedules (17 Gy in two fractions vs 39 Gy in 13 fractions) was discussed with patients who met Medical Research Council eligibility criteria. Patients were then asked to indicate their preferred Fx schedules, reasons and their level of satisfaction with being involved in the decision-making process. Radiation oncologists (RO) could prescribe radiotherapy schedules irrespective of patients' preferences. Of 92 patients enrolled, 55% chose the longer schedule. English-speaking patients were significantly more likely to choose the longer schedule (P = 0.02, 95% confidence interval: 1.2-7.6). Longer Fx was chosen because of longer survival (90%) and better local control (12%). Shorter Fx was chosen for shorter overall treatment duration (80%), cost (61%) and better symptom control (20%). In all, 56% of patients choosing the shorter schedule had their treatment altered by the treating RO, whereas only 4% of patients choosing longer Fx had their treatment altered (P < 0.001). Despite this, all (100%) patients were satisfied with being involved in the decision-making process. The decision board was useful in aiding decision-making, with both Fx schedules being acceptable to patients. Interestingly, despite the longer average survival associated with longer Fx, nearly half of the patients believed that this was not as important as a shorter duration of treatment and lower cost. Despite patients' preferences, there were significant alterations of preferred schedules because of RO's own biases.",

CTS triggered autophagy as confirmed by monodansylcadaverine staining, transmission electron microscopy analysis, as well as western blot detection of microtubule-associated protein light-chain 3 (LC3). CTS induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, which was reversed by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), catalase, diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), pyrrolinodimethylthiocarbamate (PDTC), and dicumarol. Furthermore, CTS-induced autophagy was inhibited by NAC, JNK siRNA and SP600125. NAC reversed CTS-induced JNK phosphorylation. NAC, 3-methyladenine (3-MA), and SP600125 partly reversed CTS-induced cell death. In addition, CTS (10 mg/kg) dramatically inhibited tumor growth by 48.3% in A549 xenograft nude mice, which was completely reversed by NAC (50 mg/kg) co-treatment.

In addition, a decrease in catalase activity or accumulation of hydrogen peroxide correlates with cancer metastasis. Recent studies indicate that cathepsin activation and expression can be modulated via H2O2 treatment. However, the actual relationship between catalase and cathepsins is not yet fully understood. In the present study, we found that catalase expression (or activity) was higher, while intracellular and extracellular Cat S, Cat L, and Cat K activities were lower in the non-invasive CL1-0 cells compared to the highly invasive CL1-5 cells. After CL1-0 cells were transfected with catalase-shRNA, the corresponding ROS (H2O2) level and Cat S, Cat L, or Cat K expression (or activity) was up-regulated, accompanied by an increase in cell migration and invasion. On the other hand, ROS (H2O2) level, cathepsin S, L, and K activities, cell migration and invasion were decreased in catalase-overexpressed CL1-5 cells. It is suggested that catalase may regulate cathepsin activity by controlling the production of ROS (H2O2), leading to variation in migration and invasion ability of lung cancer cells. ",

To overcome lung cancer by regulating the ROS level, we investigated the antitumor effect and mechanism of Rg3 and its antioxidative property on Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells.;Inhibition of ROS was suppressed in LLC cells by Rg3 treatment, and these cells were used to investigate the antioxidant, antiproliferative, and antitumor effects in LLC cells.;ROS production was increased in cells grown in serum-containing media (conditioned media) compared to those grown in serum-free media. The high level of ROS induced LLC cell proliferation, but treatment with Rg3 (200 ng/ml) resulted in reduction of ROS, leading to inhibition of cell proliferation. Treatment with Rg3 significantly reduced cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase expression in LLC cells. Additionally, Rg3 treatment significantly suppressed activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and induced LLC cell apoptosis through activation of pro-apoptotic proteins and suppression of anti-apoptotic proteins.;Taken together, these findings demonstrate the role of Rg3 in reduction of the intracellular ROS level, attenuation of proliferation via augmentation of cell cycle- and cell proliferation-associated proteins, and activation of apoptosis through regulation of apoptosis-associated proteins in LLC.

P-glycoprotein (P-gp) activity governs multi-drug resistance (MDR) development in different cancer cell types. Identification of anti-cancer agents with the potential to kill cancer cells and at the same time inhibit MDR is important to intensify the search for novel therapeutic approaches. We examined the effects of sulfinosine (SF), a quite unexplored purine nucleoside analog, in MDR (P-gp over-expressing) non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and glioblastoma cell lines (NCI-H460/R and U87-TxR, respectively). SF showed the same efficacy against MDR cancer cell lines and their sensitive counterparts. However, it was non-toxic for normal human keratinocytes (HaCaT). SF induced caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death and autophagy in MDR cancer cells. After SF application, reactive oxygen species (ROS) were generated and glutathione (GSH) concentration was decreased. The expression of key enzyme for GSH synthesis, gamma Glutamyl-cysteine-synthetase (γGCS) was decreased as well as the expression of gst-π mRNA. Consequently, SF significantly decreased the expression of hif-1α, mdr1 and vegf mRNAs even in hypoxic conditions. SF caused the inhibition of P-gp (coded by mdr1) expression and activity. The accumulation of standard chemotherapeutic agent--doxorubicin (DOX) was induced by SF in concentration- and time-dependent manner. The best effect of SF was obtained after 72 h when it attained the effect of known P-gp inhibitors (Dex-verapamil and tariquidar). Accordingly, SF sensitized the resistant cancer cells to DOX in subsequent treatment. Furthermore, SF decreased the experssion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on mRNA and protein level and modulated its secretion. In conclusion, the effects on P-gp (implicated in pharmacokinetics and MDR), GSH (implicated in detoxification) and VEGF (implicated in tumor-angiogenesis and progression) qualify SF as multi-potent anti-cancer agent, which use must be considered, in particular for resistant malignancies.",

We isolated 2-ethoxycarbonyl-2-β-hydroxy-A-nor-cholest-5-ene-4one (ECHC) from butanol extracts of scleractinian coral Acropora formosa and reported its potential antioxidant and antimicrobial activity as well as less toxicity against zebrafish Danio rerio. In the present study, we intend to explore p53-mediated apoptosis pathway enhanced by ECHC in A549 human non-small cell lung cancer cell lines. This report shows that ECHC increases ROS generation and sensitizes mitochondrial membrane that leads to the release of cytochrome C (Cyto C) into cytosol. Further, ECHC decreases the expression of antiapoptotic genes such as TNF-α, IL-8, Bcl2, MMP2, and MMP9 which are actively involved in cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis etc. It also increases the expression of apoptotic genes Cyto C, Bax, and p21, which are responsible for cell cycle arrest and cell death. The tumor suppressor p53 was also observed to be upregulated during ECHC treatment in untransformed cells and was more likely to result in cell cycle arrest, senescence, and apoptosis. Finally, ECHC also down regulates the expression of caspase-9 and caspase-3 which are the death stage of intrinsic apoptosis. Our findings suggested that ECHC enhances ROS generation and mitochondrial sensitization determines the threshold for irreversible p53-mediated intrinsic apoptosis pathway. ",

In cancer therapy, YPFS is being combined with chemotherapy drugs to achieve improved efficacy; however, scientific evidence to illustrate this combination effect is lacking. The present study aims to demonstrate the anti-drug resistance of YPFS in cisplatin (DDP)-resistant non-small cell lung cancer cells (A549/DDP). The application of YPFS exhibited a synergistic enhancement of DDP-induced cytotoxicity as well as of the apoptotic signalling molecules. DDP-induced expression of the multi-drug-resistance efflux transporters was markedly reduced in the presence of YPFS, resulting in a higher intracellular concentration of DDP. In addition, the application of YPFS increased DDP-induced ROS accumulation and MMP depletion, decreased p62/TRAF6 signalling in DDP-treated A549/DDP cells. The co-treatment of DDP and YPFS in tumour-bearing mice reduced the tumour size robustly (by more than 80%), which was much better than the effect of DDP alone. These results indicate that YPFS can notably improve the DDP-suppressed cancer effect, which may be a consequence of the elevation of intracellular DDP via the drug transporters as well as the down regulation of p62/TRAF6 signalling.

Apart from the successful targeting of HER2 over-expression in gastric cancer (GC) with trastuzumab, other targeted therapies in GC have fallen short or still in early clinical development. While HER2 over-expression accounts for up to 20% of GC, other potential actionable driver mutations occur at a much lower frequency in GC. In this review we describe some of the more interesting genetic aberrations including driver mutations in gastric cancer that have very potent inhibitors against them already in clinical development. Part I of this review will concentrate on the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) gene amplification (HER2, FGFR2, MET, EGFR). Part II will concentrate on gene mutations (HER2, KRAS, PIK3CA, BRAF) and gene rearrangement (ROS1, BRAF, HER2). Because of the low frequency of these potential driver mutations, perseverance in screening for these mutations will be needed in order to enroll enough of each uniquely molecularly defined subset of GC in order to demonstrate significant clinical benefit in a unique molecularly targeted therapy trial. This approach has been successfully employed in the clinical approval of crizotinib for the treatment of ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer. Finally, we discuss a paradigm shift in the personalized treatment of GC patients where multiplex comprehensive screening of all GC patients for all these potential driver mutations simultaneously is performed to achieve efficiencies and timeliness in diagnosis and allowing enrollment into different molecularly targeted therapy trials and the prospective discovery of novel yet unknown actionable driver mutations.

In this study, we investigated the cytotoxic responses of PM10 and SO2, singly and in binary mixtures, using human non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells, followed by clarifying the possible mechanisms for their interaction. The results indicated that the concomitant treatment of PM10 and SO2 at low concentrations led to synergistic injury in terms of cell survival and apoptosis occurrence, while PM10 and SO2 alone at the same concentrations did not cause damage to the cells. Also, radical oxygen species (ROS) production followed by nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation was involved in the above synergistic cytotoxicity, which was confirmed by the repression of the actions by an ROS inhibitor (NAC). This implies that assessment of health risk should consider the interactions between ambient PM and gaseous copollutants. ",

POL initiated apoptosis through inhibiting Akt-NF-κB pathway, while POL triggered autophagy via suppressing Akt-mTOR pathway, suggesting the molecular switch role of Akt in regulating between POL-induced apoptosis and autophagy. Moreover, ROS was involved in POL-induced inhibition of Akt expression, and might therefore mediate both apoptosis and autophagy in A549 cells. In addition, POL displayed no significant cytotoxicity toward normal human embryonic lung fibroblast HELF cells.

The sequence of events leading to apoptosis following proteasome inhibition by bortezomib is unclear. Bortezomib effects on components of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway were examined: generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), alteration in the mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi m), and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. With human H460 lung cancer cells, bortezomib exposure at 0.1 microM showed induction of apoptotic cell death starting at 24 h, with increasing effects after 48-72 h of treatment. After 3-6 h, an elevation in ROS generation, an increase in Delta psi m, and the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, were observed in a time-dependent manner. Co-incubation with rotenone and antimycin A, inhibitors of mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I and III, or with cyclosporine A, an inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition pore, resulted in inhibition of bortezomib-induced ROS generation, increase in Delta psi m, and cytochrome c release. Tiron, an antioxidant agent, blocked the bortezomib-induced ROS production, Delta psi m increase, and cytochrome c release. Tiron treatment also protected against the bortezomib-induced PARP protein cleavage and cell death. Benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone, an inhibitor of pan-caspase, did not alter the bortezomib-induced ROS generation and increase in Delta psi m, although it prevented bortezomib-induced poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and apoptotic death. In PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells (with overexpression of Bcl-2), a reduction of bortezomib-induced ROS generation, Delta psi m increase was correlated with cellular resistance to bortezomib and the attenuation of drug-induced apoptosis. The transient transfection of wild type p53 in p53 null H358 cells caused stimulation of the bortezomib-induced apoptosis but failed to enhance ROS generation and Delta psi m increase. Thus ROS generation plays a critical role in the initiation of the bortezomib-induced apoptotic cascade by mediation of the disruption of Delta psi m and the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria.",

Recently, the notion of using novel combinations of 'old' drugs for new indications has garnered significant interest. The potential of using phenothiazines as chemosensitizers has been suggested earlier but so far our understanding of their molecular targets remains scant. The current study was designed to better define phenothiazine-sensitive cellular processes in relation to chemosensitivity. We found that phenothiazines shared the ability to delay γH2AX resolution in DNA-damaged human lung cancer cells. Accordingly, cells co-treated with chemotherapy and phenothiazines underwent protracted cell-cycle arrest followed by checkpoint escape that led to abnormal mitoses, secondary arrest and/or a form of apoptosis associated with increased endogenous oxidative stress and intense vacuolation. We provide evidence implicating lysosomal dysfunction as a key component of cell death in phenothiazine co-treated cells, which also exhibited more typical hallmarks of apoptosis including the activation of both caspase-dependent and -independent pathways. Finally, we demonstrated that vacuolation in phenothiazine co-treated cells could be reduced by ROS scavengers or the vacuolar ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin, leading to increased cell viability. Our data highlight the potential benefit of using phenothiazines as chemosensitizers in tumors that acquire molecular alterations rendering them insensitive to caspase-mediated apoptosis.",

We report here that Cav-1 plays a key role as a negative regulator of anoikis through a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent mechanism in human lung carcinoma H460 cells. During cell detachment, Cav-1 is downregulated, whereas ROS generation is upregulated. Hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical are two key ROS produced by cells during detachment. Treatment of the cells with hydrogen peroxide scavengers, catalase and N-acetylcysteine, promoted Cav-1 downregulation and anoikis during cell detachment, indicating that produced hydrogen peroxide plays a primary role in preventing anoikis by stabilizing Cav-1 protein. Catalase and N-acetylcysteine promoted ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Cav-1, which is a major pathway of its downregulation during cell anoikis. Furthermore, addition of hydrogen peroxide exogenously to the cells inhibited Cav-1 downregulation by preventing the formation of Cav-1-ubiquitin complex, supporting the inhibitory role of endogenous hydrogen peroxide in Cav-1 degradation during cell detachment. Together, these results indicate a novel role of hydrogen peroxide as an endogenous suppressor of cell anoikis through its stabilizing effect on Cav-1.",

It generates lead compound for drug development and brings focus on molecules for mechanistic investigations on many otherwise intangible biological processes. In this study, using non-small cell lung cancer cell A549 to screen against a structurally novel and diverse synthetic small molecule library of 2,400 compounds, we identified a molecule named rosline that has strong anti-proliferation activity on A549 cells with a 50% cell growth inhibitory concentration (IC50 ) of 2.87 ± 0.39 µM. We showed that rosline treatment increased the number of Annexin V-positive staining cell, as well as G2/M arrest in their cell cycle progression. Further, we have demonstrated that rosline induces a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δφm ) and an increase of caspases 3/7 and 9 activities in A549 cells, although having no effect on the activity of caspase 8. Moreover, we found that rosline could induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibit the phosphorylation of signaling molecule Akt in A549 cells. Alternatively, an antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) significantly attenuated rosline's effects on the mitochondrial membrane potential, caspases 3/7 and 9 activities, cell viabilities and the phosphorylation of Akt. Our results demonstrated that ROS played an important role in the apoptosis of A549 cells induced by rosline. ",

However, recent evidence has shown that irradiation can promote the invasion and metastasis of several types of cancer, and the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism by which radiation enhances the invasiveness of NSCLC cells. We found that after irradiation, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) was increased and translocated into the nucleus, where it bound to the hypoxia response element (HRE) in the CXCR4 promoter and promoted the transcription of CXCR4. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species (ROS) also plays a role in the radiation-induced expression of CXCR4. Our results revealed that 2 Gy X-ray irradiation promoted the metastasis and invasiveness of H1299, A549 and H460 cells, which were significantly enhanced by SDF-1α treatment. Blocking the SDF-1α/CXCR4 interaction could suppress the radiation-induced invasiveness of NSCLC cells. The PI3K/pAkt and MAPK/pERK1/2 pathways were found to be involved in radiation-induced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression. In vivo, irradiation promoted the colonization of H1299 cells in the liver and lung, which was mediated by CXCR4. Altogether, our findings have elucidated the underlying mechanisms of the irradiation-enhanced invasiveness of NSCLC cells. ",

We have previously shown that a combination of ionizing radiation (IR) and the staurosporine analog PKC 412, but not Ro 31-8220, increases cell death in NSCLC cells. To identify genes involved in the enhancement of cell death, a total gene profiling in response to co-administration of (i) PKC 412 with IR, or (ii) Ro 31-8220 with IR was implemented. These combined treatments caused upregulation of 140 and 179 genes and downregulation of 253 and 425 genes, respectively. Certain genes were selected and verified by real-time quantitative PCR and, of these genes, robust suppression of Ephrin B3 expression was suggested as a possible cell death-inducing mechanism of combined treatment with IR and PKC 412. Indeed, silencing of Ephrin B3 using siRNA in NSCLC cells resulted in a major alteration of their morphology with an elongated phenotype, decreased proliferation and increased cell death signaling. Moreover, silencing of Ephrin B3 in combination with IR caused a decrease in IR-mediated G(2)-arrest, induced cellular senescence, inhibited MAPK ERK and p38 phosphorylation, and caused an upregulation of p27(kip1) expression. Finally, silencing of Ephrin B3 in combination with IR sensitized U-1810 cells to IR-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, we identify and describe Ephrin B3 as a putative signaling molecule involved in the response of NSCLC cells to combined treatment with PKC 412 and ionizing radiation.",

RH-1 action is associated with;quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) which reduces this diaziridinylbenzoquinone into DNA-alkylating hydroquinone and is overexpressed in many tumors. Another suggested mechanism of RH-1 toxicity is the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) arising from its redox cycling. In order to improve anticancer action of this and similar antitumor quinones, we investigated the involvement of different signaling molecules in cytotoxicity induced by RH-1 by using wild-type tumor suppressor p53 bearing nonsmall cell lung carcinoma A549 cells as a model. Gradual and prolonged increase of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) ERK, P38, and JNK phosphorylation was observed during 24-h RH-1 treatment. In parallel, activation of DNA damage-sensing ATM kinase, upregulation, and phosphorylation of TP53 (human p53) took place. Inhibition studies revealed that RH-1-induced A549 apoptosis involved the NQO1-ATM-p53 signaling pathway and ROS generation. TP53 participated in ROS- and DNA damage-induced cell death differently. Moreover, MAP kinase JNK was another TP53 activator and death inducer in A549 cells. At the same time, rapid and prolonged activation of AKT kinase during RH-1 treatment was found, and it proved to be antiapoptotic kinase in our model system. Therefore, we identified that different and opposite cell death regulating signaling pathways, which may counteract one another, are induced in cancer cells during chemotherapeutic RH-1 treatment.",

Preclinical studies have shown that proteasome inhibitors enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells, but the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated the enhancement of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in human alveolar epithelial cells by proteasome inhibitors that up-regulate DR5 expression. This effect was blocked by DR5-neutralizing Ab. Using reporter assay, we demonstrated that the p53 and NF-kappaB elements on the DR5 first intron region were involved in proteasome inhibitor-induced DR5 expression. Both p53 small interfering RNA and NF-kappaB inhibitor suppressed DR5 expression, strengthening the significance of p53 and NF-kappaB in DR5 transcription. The protein stability, Ser(392) phosphorylation and Lys(373)/Lys(382) acetylation of p53 were enhanced by MG132. In addition to p53, IkappaBalpha degradation and NF-kappaB translocation was also observed. Moreover, the binding of p53 and p65 to the first intron of DR5 was demonstrated by DNA affinity protein-binding and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation after MG132 treatment contributed to p53, but not p65 nuclear translocation and DNA-binding activity. ROS scavenger dramatically inhibited the apoptosis induced by proteasome inhibitors plus TRAIL. The p53-null H1299 cells were resistant to proteasome inhibitor-induced DR5 up-regulation and enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. These findings reveal that proteasome inhibitor-mediated NF-kappaB and ROS-dependent p53 activation are contributed to intronic regulation of DR5 transcription, and resulted in the subsequent enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human lung cancer cells.",

Thus, ErbB2 is an important target for cancer therapies. Increased ErbB2 expression has been associated with drug resistance in cancer cells. Herceptin is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the extracellular domain of ErbB2. In this study, we aimed to block ErbB2 signaling with Herceptin and assess cytotoxicity and effects on apoptosis, oxidative stress, nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB), and Survivin expression in Calu-3 cell line. 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay were used to assess cell viability as a marker of proliferation. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining and caspase 3/7 activity were measured as the markers of apoptosis. The relative expressions of NF-kB-p50 and Survivin mRNAs were evaluated. Activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and the levels of glutathione (GSH) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Our results show that Herceptin treatment inhibits cell proliferation and activates apoptosis but without effects on Survivin and NF-kB expression in Calu-3 cell line. Intracellular glutathione levels and SOD and CAT activities were decreased in a time- and dose-dependent manner associated with oxidative stress. Also, ROS were increased at 24 h.

The cell line that exhibited highest inhibition was selected and used in the following experiments. A range of Psorinum 6× doses was used to explore treatment effects on cell cycle arrest, cell death (apoptosis), generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and change in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) using flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy, respectively. Expression of several signal proteins related to apoptosis and cell survival were quantified with Western blotting and confocal microscopy. Further, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was used to determine possible drug-DNA interactions, as well as the induction of conformational changes.;Treatment of cancer cell lines with Psorinum showed greater anticancer effects in A549 cells than in others. In A549 cells Psorinum treatment inhibited cell proliferation at 24 h after treatment, and arrested cell cycle at sub-G1 stage. It also induced ROS generation, MMP depolarization, morphological changes and DNA damage, as well as externalization of phosphatidyl serine. Further, increases in p53 expression, Bax expression, cytochrome c release, along with reduction of Bcl-2 level and caspase-3 activation were observed after Psorinum 6× treatment, which eventually drove A549 cells towards the mitochondria-mediated caspase-3-dependent pathway.

Recently, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Cav-1 proteins have been demonstrated to be highly associated with tumor metastasis and apoptosis resistance. Curcumin, a major active component of turmeric, Curcuma longa, has been shown to inhibit neoplastic evolution and tumor progression; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of curcumin on cell anoikis as a possible mechanism of anti-tumorigenic action of curcumin, and evaluated the potential role of Bcl-2 and Cav-1 in this process. Our results showed that ectopic expression of either Bcl-2 or Cav-1 induced anoikis resistance of lung carcinoma H460 cells. Curcumin downregulated Bcl-2 protein during anoikis and sensitized the cells to detachment-induced apoptosis, whereas it had no significant effect on Cav-1 protein expression. Bcl-2 down-regulation as well as anoikis enhancement by curcumin were inhibited by superoxide anion scavenger, Mn(III)tetrakis(4-benzoic acid) porphyrin chloride, but were unaffected by other ROS scavengers including catalase and deferoxamine, suggesting that superoxide anion is a key player in the downregulation of Bcl-2 by curcumin. Furthermore, we provided evidence that curcumin decreased Bcl-2 level through ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation which sensitized cells to detachment-induced apoptosis. These findings indicate a novel pathway for curcumin regulation of Bcl-2 and provide a key mechanism of anoikis regulation that may be exploited for metastatic cancer treatment.",

Applying ATP synthase inhibitor citreoviridin induced cell cycle arrest and inhibited proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of lung cancer cells. Analysis of protein expression profiles after citreoviridin treatment suggested this compound induced the unfolded protein response (UPR) associated with phosphorylation the translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), triggering cell growth inhibition. Citreoviridin-enhanced eIF2α phosphorylation could be reversed by siRNA-mediated attenuation of the UPR kinase PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) combined with treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, establishing that reactive oxygen species (ROS) boost UPR after citreoviridin treatment. Thus, a coordinate elevation of UPR and ROS initiates a positive feedback loop that convergently blocks cell proliferation.

In vitro studies with various cancer cell lines have shown an increase in ROS and intracellular free zinc in cells treated with MGd. MGd increases cytotoxicity of ionizing radiation and various chemotherapy agents and may be directly cytotoxic to tumor cells under certain conditions.

In controlled, randomized clinical trials, combining MGd treatment with ionizing radiation improves time to neurologic progression in lung cancer patients with brain metastases.

This study is the first to investigate a different, however, effective antitumor drug candidate Wentilactone A (WA) for its development as a novel agent. In NCI-H460 and NCI-H446 cell lines, WA triggered G2/M phase arrest and mitochondrial-related apoptosis, accompanying the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). It also induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and p53 and increased expression of p21. When we pre-treated cells with ERK, JNK, p38, p53 inhibitor or NAC followed by WA treatment, only ERK and p53 inhibitors blocked WA-induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest. We further observed Ras (HRas, KRas and NRas) and Raf activation, and found that WA treatment increased HRas-Raf activation. Knockdown of HRas by using small interfering RNA (siRNA) abolished WA-induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest. HRas siRNA also halted Raf, ERK, p53 activation and p21 accumulation. Molecular docking analysis suggested that WA could bind to HRas-GTP, causing accumulation of Ras-GTP and excessive activation of Raf/ERK/p53-p21. The direct binding affinity was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). In vivo, WA suppressed tumor growth without adverse toxicity and presented the same mechanism as that in vitro.

We show here that the long form of NOX5 (NOX5-L) also promotes cell death, and thus determines the balance of proliferation and death, in skin, breast and lung cancer cells. Moderate expression of NOX5-L induced cell proliferation accompanied by AKT and ERK phosphorylation, whereas an increase in NOX5-L above a certain threshold promoted cancer cell death accompanied by caspase-3 activation. Notably, cisplatin treatment increased NOX5-L levels through CREB activation and enhanced NOX5-L activity through augmentation of Ca2+ release and c-Abl expression, ultimately triggering ROS-mediated cancer cell death-a distinct pathway absent in normal cells. These results indicate that NOX5-L determines cellular responses in a concentration- and context-dependent manner. ",

Although various mechanisms for the effects of LLLT have been proposed, and intracellular ROS were indicated as the one of the key factors, direct measurement of intracellular ROS of several types of cells after different wavelength lasers irradiation has not been reported.;Various types of cells were used in this study: mouse preadipocytes (3T3-L1), prechondrocytes (ATDC5), myoblasts (C2C12), mesenchymal stromal cells (KUSA-A1), lung cancer cells (LLC), insulinoma cells (MIN6), fibroblasts (NIH-3T3), human cervix adenocarcinoma cells (HeLa), macrophages differentiated from lymphocytes (THP-1) after treatment with phorbol ester, and rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3). Cells were irradiated with a blue laser (wavelength: 405 nm), a red laser (wavelength: 664 nm) or a near infrared laser (wavelength: 808 nm) at 100 mW/cm(2) for 60 or 120 sec. Intracellular ROS levels were measured by fluorometric assay using the intracellular ROS probe, CM-H2DCFDA in a flow cytometer.;After a blue laser irradiation, intracellular ROS levels were increased in all types of cells. In contrast, intracellular ROS generation was not observed after irradiation with a red laser or near-infrared laser.;Potential sources of intracellular ROS were excited by blue laser irradiation, resulting in ROS production within cells. Although the low-level intracellular ROS should be generated after a red or a near-infrared laser irradiation, the only high level intracellular ROS were detected by the ROS probe used in this study. As ROS are considered to be key secondary messengers, the specific functional regulation of cells by laser irradiation will be studied in a future study.",

In probing the possible non-genotoxic molecular targets of cadmium-induced nasal toxicity, we performed an mRNA differential display analysis for cadmium-treated human nasal septum carcinoma RPMI-2650 cells. Cadmium (≥ 0.5 μM) inhibited the cell proliferation. The intracellular ROS levels were induced by cadmium treatment. In addition, cadmium elicited the AKR1C3 expression. The cadmium-induced increase in AKR1C3 protein levels was suppressed by N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and, to a lesser extent, PI3K inhibitor (Ly294002). Cells pretreated with Ly294002 were more resistant to cadmium toxicity than control. The increase in AKR1C3 protein level was accompanied by an increase in the nuclear transcription factor Nrf2. Overall, our data suggest that cadmium-induced ROS cause up-regulation of AKR1C3 expression, at least partially via the activation of PI3K-related intracellular signaling pathways, and Nrf2 activation, thereby contributing to an adaptive intracellular response to cadmium toxicity.",

Here we show that, in addition, p53 protects the genome from oxidation by reactive oxygen species (ROS), a major cause of DNA damage and genetic instability. In the absence of severe stresses, relatively low levels of p53 are sufficient for upregulation of several genes with antioxidant products, which is associated with a decrease in intracellular ROS. Downregulation of p53 results in excessive oxidation of DNA, increased mutation rate and karyotype instability, which are prevented by incubation with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Dietary supplementation with NAC prevented frequent lymphomas characteristic of Trp53-knockout mice, and slowed the growth of lung cancer xenografts deficient in p53. Our results provide a new paradigm for a nonrestrictive tumor suppressor function of p53 and highlight the potential importance of antioxidants in the prophylaxis and treatment of cancer.",

These environmental toxicants are known to cause bronchitis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer. Recent studies have demonstrated that AhR activation upregulates the expression of mucin 5AC, oligomeric mucus/gel-forming (MUC5AC) in the airway epithelial cell line. However, the mechanism for the production of mucin has not been clarified. In this study, we investigated the role and pathway of AhR in airway epithelial cells by using selective agonists and antagonists. After stimulation with or without benzopyrene (B[a]P), an AhR agonist, MUC5AC expression was measured by real-time RT-PCR. The mechanism of AhR-induced MUC5AC expression in airway epithelial cells was studied in terms of the production of cytokine and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Treatment with B[a]P increased ROS generation in NCI-H₂₉₂ cells. Furthermore, B[a]P-induced MUC5AC upregulation and mucin production were inhibited by AhR siRNA or the use of an antioxidative agent. These results suggest that the AhR-induced increase of mucin production is partially mediated by ROS generation.

Phx-3 suppressed the viability of human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 and induced cellular apoptosis 6 h after treatment. Prior to these events, intracellular pH (pHi) was rapidly decreased from pH 7.65 to 7.10 within 30 min when A549 cells were treated with 7 microM Phx-3. This intracellular acidification continued for 3 h in the cells. Augmented production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was obseved 1 h after treatment of A549 cells with 7 microM Phx-3, and cell cycle arrest at G1 was indicated 3 h after treatment. The translocation of NF-kappaB from the cytosol to the nucleus was clearly indicated 1 h after the administration of Phx-3 to A549 cells, while it was significantly suppressed when Nac, a scavenger of ROS, was added to the cells with Phx-3. The Phx-3-induced apoptosis in A549 cells was significantly suppressed when Nac was administered to the cells. These results suggest that a decrease of pHi, caused by depolarization of the mitochondria, may trigger the dysfunction of mitochondria causing ROS production; therefore, both the translocation of NF-kappaB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and apoptosis induction were promoted in A549 cells. Microscopic examination of the cellular localization of Phx-3 in A549 cells revealed that Phx-3 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm and the mitochondria, but not in the nucleus. The present results indicate that Phx-3 might be a strong anticancer drug against lung cancer, which is intractable to chemotherapy, by causing various early events, including the decrease of pHi and ROS production, and finally inducing cellular apoptosis.",

While the oncoprotein Mucin-1 (MUC1) performs multiple roles in the development of diverse human tumors, whether MUC1 is involved in acquired chemoresistance has not been determined. Using an acquired chemoresistance lung cancer cell model, we show that MUC1 expression was substantially increased in cells with acquired apoptosis resistance (AR). Knockdown of MUC1 expression effectively increased the sensitivity of these cells to the apoptotic cytotoxicity of anticancer therapeutics, suggesting that MUC1 contributes to acquired chemoresistance. Decreased catalase expression and increased cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation were found to be associated with MUC1 overexpression. Scavenging ROS with butylated hydroxyanisole or supplying exogenous catalase dramatically suppressed MUC1 expression through destabilizing MUC1 protein, suggesting that reduced catalase expression mediated ROS accumulation is accounted for MUC1 overexpression. Further, we found that increased miR-551b expression in the AR cells inhibited the expression of catalase and potentiated ROS accumulation and MUC1 expression. Finally, by manipulating MUC1 expression, we found that MUC1 promotes EGFR-mediated activation of the cell survival cascade involving Akt/c-FLIP/COX-2 in order to protect cancer cells from responding to anticancer agents. Thus, our results establish a pathway consisting of miR-551b/catalase/ROS that results in MUC1 overexpression, and intervention against this pathway could be exploited to overcome acquired chemoresistance.

Although either Gem or DHA induced a significant increase in ROS generation, the combination treatment did not further enhance ROS level. Compared with single drugs, the combination treatment significantly potentiated Bak activation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase-9 and -3 activation, indicating the important role of the Bak-mediated intrinsic apoptosis pathway in the synergistic action, which was further verified by the significant prevention of the cytotoxicity of the combination treatment by inhibiting one of caspase-9, -3 and Bcl-xL or silencing Bak.

E3330, an inhibitor of APE1 redox activity, also augmented the ROS levels and cytotoxicity in Pb-treated cells. Intriguingly, the capability of Pb to activate ERK was abolished under siAPE1 or E3330 co-treatments; conversely, forced expression of APE1 up-regulated the ERK activation by Pb or serum in both Cys65-redox activity dependent and independent manners. Moreover, APE1 formed complex with ERK2, and its redox activity could rescue ERK oxidative inactivation.

Treatment with ATO inhibited the growth of the Calu-6 cells at 72 hours. ATO induced apoptosis, which was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP; DeltaPsi(m)).

Urinary samples for metabonomic study, serum samples for biochemical assay, and heart samples for histopathology test were collected. As a result, the metabonomics-based findings such as PLS-DA plotting showed minimal metabolic alterations in L-THP as compared to F-THP, and correlated with the changes of serum biochemical assay and cardiac histopathology as measurements of damage to heart tissue. Our results confirm that when encapsulated into liposomes, the cumulative cardiotoxicity of THP can be greatly ameliorated. Lipophilic aglycone metabolites of THP associated with redox cycling are cardiotoxic for the possibility of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Also, metabonomic analysis shows that the successive doses of THP will lead to severe metabolic pathways disturbances in the cell energy production.

Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to determine intracellular SAHA level.;SAHA treatment markedly inhibits LNCaP cell growth, when the cells are at a low ROS level. SAHA is, however, inactive against the same cell line, when the cells are at a high ROS level. A significant decrease in SAHA level was observed in LNCaP cells with high ROS after 24- and 72-h treatment when compared to cells with low ROS. Vitamin E pretreatment that reduces cellular ROS, synergistically sensitizes oxidatively stressed LNCaP, PC-3, HT-29, HCT-115 and MDA-MB231 cells, but not the A-549 and NCI-H460 cells with low ROS to SAHA. NAC treatment also sensitized androgen-treated LNCaP cells to the growth inhibitory effects of SAHA.;Response to SAHA could be improved by combining anti-oxidants such as Vitamin E with SAHA for the treatment of oxidatively stressed human malignancies that are otherwise resistant to SAHA.",

Yet, it is well established that most anticancer therapies depend on ROS production for efficient tumor eradication. Using several non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines, we have dissected how the site of ROS production and accumulation in various cell compartments affect cell fate. We demonstrate that high levels of exogenously generated H2O2 induce extensive DNA damage, ATP depletion, and severe cytotoxicity. Although these effects were independent of caspase activity, they could-at least in part-be prevented by RIP1 kinase inhibition. In contrast, low levels of exogenously produced H2O2 triggered a modest drop in ATP level, delayed toxicity, G2/M arrest, and cell senescence. Mitochondrially produced H2O2 induced a reversible ATP drop without affecting cell viability. Instead, the cells accumulated in the G1/S phase of the cell cycle and became senescent. Concomitant inhibition of glycolysis was found to markedly sensitize cells to death in the presence of otherwise nontoxic concentrations of H2O2, presumably by the inhibition of ATP-restoring mechanisms. Combined, our data provide evidence that ROS might dictate different cellular consequences depending on their overall concentration at steady-state levels and on their site of generation.",

Continuous administration of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), a ROS inhibitor, before or after NNK treatment significantly blocked tumor development, although less effectively when BHA is administered after NNK treatment. Strikingly, BHA abolished the occurrence of F4/80+ macrophages with similar efficiency no matter whether it was administered before or after NNK treatment. Detection of cells from bronchioalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) confirmed that BHA markedly inhibited the accumulation of macrophages while slightly reducing the number of lymphocytes that were induced by NNK. Immunohistological staining showed that BHA specifically abolished the occurrence of CD206+ TAMs when it was administered before or after NNK treatment. Western blot analysis of TAMs markers, arginase I and Ym-1, showed that BHA blocked NNK-induced TAMs accumulation.

We investigated sources of, and the cellular response to, superoxide radical anion (O2 (·-)) generated in human A549 lung cancer cells after treatment with selenite. A temporal delay was observed between selenite treatment and increases in O2 (·-) production and biomarkers of apoptosis/necrosis, indicating that the reduction of selenite by the glutathione reductase/NADPH system (yielding O2 (·-)) is a minor contributor to ROS production under these conditions. By contrast, mitochondrial and NADPH oxidase O2 (·-) generation were the major contributors. Treatment with a ROS scavenger [poly(ethylene glycol)-conjugated superoxide dismutase (SOD) or sodium 4,5-dihydroxybenzene-1,3-disulfonate] 20 h after the initial selenite treatment inhibited both ROS generation and apoptosis determined at 24 h. In addition, SOD1 was selectively upregulated and its perinuclear cytoplasmic distribution was colocalised with the cellular distribution of selenium. Interestingly, messenger RNA for manganese superoxide dismutase, catalase, inducible haem oxygenase 1 and glutathione peroxidase either remained unchanged or showed a delayed response to selenite treatment. Colocalisation of Cu and Se in these cells (Weekley et al. in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 133:18272-18279, 2011) potentially results from the formation of a Cu-Se species, as indicated by Cu K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectra. Overall, SOD1 is upregulated in response to selenite-mediated ROS generation, and this likely leads to an accumulation of toxic hydrogen peroxide that is temporally related to decreased cancer cell viability. Increased expression of SOD1 gene/protein coupled with formation of a Cu-Se species may explain the colocalisation of Cu and Se observed in these cells.",

We report herein the development of a novel nanoscale drug delivery system (nDDS) based nanotherapeutic that combines chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT) into one single platform to achieve synergistic anticancer capacity to conquer cisplatin resistance. Mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSNs) was used as the drug delivery vector to conjugate cisplatin prodrug and to load photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) to afford the dual drug loaded delivery system MSNs/Ce6/Pt. The hybrid nanoparticles have an average diameter of about 100 nm and slightly positive surface charge of about 18.2 mV. The MSNs/Ce6/Pt nanoparticles can be efficiently internalized by cells through endocytosis, thereby achieving much higher cellular Pt uptake than cisplatin in cisplatin-resistant A549R lung cancer cells. After 660 nm light irradiation (10 mW/cm(2)), the cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in MSNs/Ce6/Pt treated cells was elevated dramatically. As a result of these properties, MSNs/Ce6/Pt exhibited very potent anticancer activity against A549R cells, giving a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value for the combination therapy of 0.53 μM, much lower than that of cisplatin (25.1 μM). This study suggests the great potential of nDDS-based nanotherapeutic for combined chemo-photodynamic therapy to circumvent cisplatin resistance. ",

In this study, we investigated whether TIGAR might exert dual impacts on cancer cell survival based on its ability to inhibit both apoptosis and autophagy. In liver or lung cancer cells treated with the anticancer drug epirubicin, TIGAR levels increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner. TIGAR silencing enhanced epirubicin-induced elevations in ROS levels and apoptosis rates, in a manner that was blocked by ectopic addition of NADPH or N-acetyl cysteine. These findings were correlated with reduced tumorigenicity and increased chemosensitivity in mouse xenograft tumor assays. In parallel, TIGAR silencing also enhanced the epirubicin-induced activation of autophagy, in a manner that was also blocked by ectopic addition of NADPH. Notably, TIGAR silencing also licensed epirubicin-mediated inactivation of the mTOR pathway, suggesting TIGAR also exerted a negative impact on autophagy. However, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of autophagy increased epirubicin-induced apoptosis in TIGAR-silenced cells. Overall, our results revealed that TIGAR inhibits both apoptosis and autophagy, resulting in a dual impact on tumor cell survival in response to tumor chemotherapy.

Thus, in the present study, we investigated the effects of MAPK inhibitors on MG132-treated human pulmonary fibroblast (HPF) cells in relation to cell growth inhibition, cell death, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH). Treatment with 15 μM MG132 increased ROS levels including mitochondrial O(2•)(-) and GSH depleted cell numbers in HPF cells at 24 hours. MAP kinase or ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor did not significantly affect cell growth inhibition, cell death, the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP; ΔΨ(m)), ROS level and GSH depletion in MG132-treated HPF cells. c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor attenuated the growth inhibition and death by MG132. This inhibitor also significantly decreased O(2•)(-) level in MG132-treated HPF cells. Although p38 inhibitor slightly enhanced HPF cell growth inhibition by MG132, this inhibitor and siRNA prevented HPF cell death induced by MG132. p38 inhibitor also attenuated d O(2•)(-) level and GSH depletion. Moreover, extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK), JNK or p38 siRNA did not strongly affect ROS levels in MG132-treated HPF cells.

Because immunotherapy can not only reduce the toxicity of chemotherapeutics but also enhance antitumor effects in vivo, combining these two therapies is a trend that continues to gain more attention in clinic.

In the present study, the synergistic effect between SEP and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a traditional cytotoxic drug, in vitro and in vivo was investigated. The results obtained indicated that SEP alone stimulated NK-92 cytotoxicity and coordinated with 5-FU to augment the cytotoxicity of NK-92 cells against HepG-2 or A549 cells in vitro. SEP promoted NK-92 activity by stimulating NKG2D and its downstream DAP10/PI3K/Erk signaling pathway. Additionally, 5-FU could increase MICA expression on HepG-2 or A549 cells and prevent membrane MICA from shedding as soluble MICA, which were abrogated in the tumor cells transfected with ADAM 10 overexpression plasmid. Moreover, in H22- or Lewis lung cancer (LLC)-bearing mouse models, SEP reversed 5-FU-induced atrophy and apoptosis in both the spleen and bone marrow in vivo by suppressing ROS generation and caspase-3 activation.

The treatment was administered for 1 year except when progression of disease occurred. The primary study endpoints were to define clinical outcome, i.e. duration of response, survival (overall survival, OS and progression-free survival, PFS), the toxicity profile, and the evaluation of quality of life (QL). As secondary endpoints, we measured the changes of lymphocyte count, serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines, IL-2, C-reactive protein (CRP) and leptin, blood levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant enzymes (glutathione peroxidase, GPx and superoxide dismertase, SOD). From July 1998 to June 2003, 42 patients were enrolled in the study (M/F ratio, 39/3; mean age, 62.5 years). Twenty (47.6%) patients were elderly (> 65 years). The majority of patients had either head and neck cancer or lung cancer, 88% had locally advanced or metastatic disease at diagnosis, and 76% had ECOG 0. Forty patients were previously treated with chemotherapy (27 also with radiotherapy), two with IL-2 and interfiron (IFN), one with endocrine therapy and one with only surgery. We obtained an objective response to maintenance treatment of 50%. Median duration of response was 19 months and median PFS was 33 months. Median duration of maintenance treatment was 12 months, median follow-up duration from diagnosis to June 2003 was 40 months, and median follow-up duration from study entry to June 2003 was 17 months. The median overall survival has not been reached. Toxicity was negligible. As for QL, a significant improvement of cognitive functions was observed, whereas all other functioning and symptom scales did not change significantly. As for laboratory parameters, absolute lymphocyte count increased significantly, IL-6, IL-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, CRP, and fibrinogen decreased significantly whereas IL-2 and leptin increased significantly after treatment.

However, whether wogonin enhances TRAIL's antitumor activity in vivo has never been studied. In this study, the effect of combination of TRAIL and wogonin was tested in a non-small-cell lung cancer xenografted tumor model in nude mice. Consistent with the in vitro study showing that wogonin sensitized A549 cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, wogonin greatly enhanced TRAIL-induced suppression of tumor growth, accompanied with increased apoptosis in tumor tissues as determined by TUNEL assay. The expression levels of antiapoptotic proteins including long form of cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein (cFLIPL), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 and 2 (cIAP-1 and cIAP-2) were markedly reduced in both cultured cells and xenografted tumor tissues after co-treatment with wogonin and TRAIL.

        "Doc_abstract":"Developing anticancer agents by a prooxidant strategy has attracted increasing attention in recent years, although it is not conventional in medicinal chemistry and is completely opposite to antioxidant therapy. In this work, a panel of diarylpentanoids as the curcumin mono-carbonyl analogs were designed and synthesized, and their cytotoxic and proapoptotic mechanisms against human lung cancer A549 cells were investigated at the frontiers of chemistry and biology. It was found that compared with curcumin, the compounds (A1, B1, and C1) bearing two ortho substituents on the aromatic rings, especially A1, exhibit significantly increased cytotoxic and proapoptotic activities through a Michael acceptor unit-dependent prooxidant-mediated mechanism. The prooxidative ability is governed not only by their electrophilicity but also by their geometry, cellular uptake and metabolic stability, and TrxR-inhibitory activity. Mechanistic investigation reveals that the compound A1 could effectively and irreversibly modify the TrxR by virtue of the above optimal biochemical parameters, and convert this antioxidant enzyme into a reactive oxygen species (ROS) promoter, resulting in a burst of the intracellular ROS including H2O2 and O2(-)•. The ROS generation is associated with falling apart in the redox buffering system, and subsequently induces increases in Ca(2+) influx and oxidative stress, collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, ultimately leading to cell apoptosis. This work highlights the feasibility in designing curcumin-inspired anticancer agents by a prooxidant strategy, and gives us useful information on how to design them. ",

Recent studies have suggested its anti-cancer effect in synovial sarcoma, lung cancer and hepatic cancer. However, the underlying molecular mechanism for its anti-cancer effect still remains unclear. This study investigated the anti-tumor activity of sinomenine hydrochloride (SH), a hydrochloride form of sinomenine, in human breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. We found that SH potently inhibited cell viability of a broad panel of breast cancer cell lines. Two representative breast cancer cell lines, namely ER(-)/PR(-) MDA-MB-231 and ER(+)/PR(+) MCF-7, were used for further investigation. The results showed that SH induced G1/S cell cycle arrest, caused apoptosis and induced ATM/Chk2- and ATR/Chk1-mediated DNA-damage response in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7. The anti-cancer effect of SH was regulated by increased expression levels of p-ERK, p-JNK and p-38 MAPK. Further studies showed that SH resulted in an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibition of ROS by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) almost blocked SH-induced DNA damage but only mitigated SH-induced MAPK expression changes, suggesting that both ROS-dependent and -independent pathways were involved in MAPK-mediated SH-induced breast cancer cell death. The in vivo study demonstrated that SH effectively inhibited tumor growth without showing significant toxicity. In conclusion, SH induced breast cancer cell death through ROS-dependent and -independent pathways with an upregulation of MAPKs, indicating that SH may be a potential anti-tumor drug for breast cancer treatment.

Numerous studies indicate that formaldehyde can induce various genotoxic effects in vitro and in vivo. A recent study indicated that formaldehyde impaired antioxidant cellular defences and enhanced lipid peroxidation. Selenium is an important antioxidant. We hypothesized that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation are involved in formaldehyde-induced genotoxicity in human lung cancer cell line, A549 cell line. To test the hypothesis, we investigated the effects of selenium on formaldehyde-induced genotoxicity in A549 cell lines. The results indicated that exposure to formaldehyde showed the induction of DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs). Formaldehyde significantly increased the malondialdehyde levels and decreased the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. In addition, the activations of necrosis factor-κB (NF-κB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) were induced by the formaldehyde treatment. The pretreatment with selenium counteracted the formaldehyde-induced oxidative stress, ameliorated DPCs and attenuated the activation of NF-κB and AP-1 in A549 cell lines.

The 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) assay was performed to evaluate the antioxidant properties. Resveratrol had substantially high antioxidant capacity (trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity value) compared to trolox and vitamin E since the concentration of resveratrol was more than 50 μM. Nanoparticles prepared from β-lactoglobulin (β-lg) were successfully developed. The β-lg nanoparticle showed 60 to 146 nm diameter in size with negatively charged surface. Non-cytotoxicity was observed in Caco-2 cells treated with β-lg nanoparticles. Fluorescein isothiocynate-conjugated β-lg nanoparticles were identified into the cell membrane of Caco-2 cells, indicating that nanoparticles can be used as a delivery system. Hydrogen peroxide caused accumulation of ROS in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Resveratrol-loaded nanoparticles restored H2O2-induced ROS levels by induction of cellular uptake of resveratrol in A549 cells. Furthermore, resveratrol activated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2-Kelch ECH associating protein 1 (Nrf2-Keap1) signaling in A549 cells, thereby accumulation of Nrf2 abundance, as demonstrated by western blotting approach.

The human lung carcinoma cell line, NCI-H1299, shows resistance to conventional cancer treatments, such as ionizing radiation (IR) and cisplatin, while the lung carcinoma cell line, NCI-H460, is sensitive to treatment with these agents. However, when treated with a chalcone compound [toluenesulfonylamido-chalcone, 4'-(p-toluene sulfonyl amino)-3,4-dihydroxy chalcone (TSHDC)], cell death was dramatically induced in NCI-H1299 cells as compared to NCI-H460 cells. TSHDC-mediated cytotoxicity was not dependent on the status of p53 and p21. However, TSHDC exerted increased c-Myc-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in NCI-H1299 cells in which c-Myc is overexpressed, while increased ROS production did not occur in A549 or NCI-H460 cells with a low c-Myc level. Several colon and brain cancer cells also showed a correlation between c-Myc expression and TSHDC-mediated increased cell death. Tumor regression by TSHDC was more dramatic in NCI-H1299 cells than NCI-H460 cells, when these cells were grafted to nude mice. However, in the case of IR and cisplatin, NCI-H460 cells were more sensitive than NCI-H1299 cells.

Although only 2 years have passed many new facts and stimulating developments have happened in diagnostic molecular pathology rendering it worthwhile to present an up-date on this topic. A major technical improvement is certainly given by the introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS; amplicon, whole exome, whole genome) and its application to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue in routine diagnostics. Based on this 'revolution' the analyses of numerous genetic alterations in parallel has become a routine approach opening the chance to characterize patients' malignant tumors much more deeply without increasing turn-around time and costs. In the near future this will open new strategies to apply 'off-label' targeted therapies, e.g. for rare tumors, otherwise resistant tumors etc. The clinically relevant genetic aberrations described in this review include mutation analyses of RAS (KRAS and NRAS), BRAF and PI3K in colorectal cancer, KIT or PDGFR alpha as well as BRAF, NRAS and KIT in malignant melanoma. Moreover, we present several recent advances in the molecular characterization of malignant lymphoma. Beside the well-known mutations in NSCLC (EGFR, ALK) a number of chromosomal aberrations (KRAS, ROS1, MET) have become relevant. Only very recently has the clinical need for analysis of BRCA1/2 come up and proven as a true challenge for routine diagnostics because of the genes' special structure and hot-spot-free mutational distribution. The genetic alterations are discussed in connection with their increasingly important role in companion diagnostics to apply targeted drugs as efficient as possible. As another aspect of the increasing number of druggable mutations, we discuss the challenges personalized therapies pose for the design of clinical studies to prove optimal efficacy particularly with respect to combination therapies of multiple targeted drugs and conventional chemotherapy. Such combinations would lead to an extremely high complexity that would hardly be manageable by applying conventional study designs for approval, e.g. by the FDA or EMA. Up-coming challenges such as the application of methylation assays and proteomic analyses on FFPE tissue will also be discussed briefly to open the door towards the ultimate goal of reading a patients' tissue as 'deeply' as possible. Although it is yet to be shown, which levels of biological information are most informative for predictive pathology, an integrated molecular characterization of tumors will likely offer the most comprehensive view for individualized therapy approaches. To optimize cancer treatment we need to understand tumor biology in much more detail on morphological, genetic, proteomic as well as epigenetic grounds. Finally, the complex challenges on the level of drug design, molecular diagnostics, and clinical trials make necessary a close collaboration among academic institutions, regulatory authorities and pharmaceutical companies.

It is a naphthoquinone compound with anti-atherosclerosis, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, contraceptive, cardiotonic, immunosuppressive, and neuroprotective activities. However, the mechanisms of plumbagin's activities are largely unknown. In this study, we examined the effect of plumbagin on HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells as well as LLC lung cancer cells, SiHa cervical carcinoma cells. Plumbagin significantly decreased HepG2 cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, treatment with plumbagin significantly increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3/7 activity. Using the similarity ensemble approach (SEA)-a state-of-the-art cheminformatic technique-we identified two previously unknown cellular targets of plumbagin: thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and glutathione reductase (GR). This was then confirmed using protein- and cell-based assays. We found that plumbagin was directly reduced by TrxR, and that this reduction was inhibited by the TrxR inhibitor, sodium aurothiomalate (ATM). Plumbagin also decreased the activity of GR. Plumbagin, and the GR inhibitor sodium arsenite all increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and this increase was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) in HepG2 cells. Plumbagin increased TrxR-1 and heme oxygenase (HO)-1 expression and pretreatment with NAC significantly attenuated the plumbagin-induced increase of TrxR-1 and HO-1 expression in HepG2 cells, LLC cells and SiHa cells. Pretreatment with NAC significantly prevented the plumbagin-induced decrease in cell viability in these cell types. In conclusion, plumbagin exerted its anticancer effect by directly interacting with TrxR and GR, and thus increasing intracellular ROS levels. ",

This study investigated whether SAMC prevented the carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) from inducing precancerous activity in human lung cells (A549 cell line). A549 cells were either pre-treated (PreTM) or concurrently treated (CoTM) with 1μM B(a)P and either 10 or 50 μM SAMC. The 50 μM PreTM group inhibited B(a)P-induced cell proliferation by approximately 100%. The 50 μM SAMC PreTM and CoTM inhibited the B(a)P-induced G2/M phase shift by 100% and 97%, respectively. Furthermore, the PreTM and CoTM groups exhibited the potential to reduce the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) relative to the B(a)P group by at least 78%. The SAMC PreTM elevated superoxide dismutase (SOD) by approximately 100%. In this study, we revealed the mechanisms involved in SAMC inhibition of B(a)P-induced carcinogenesis, including suppression of cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation, attenuation of ROS formation, inhibition of DNA damage, increase of SOD activity and inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activity.

To date, however, very few studies have been conducted to investigate the combined effects of anticancer drugs and radiotherapy. In this study, to evaluate the role of mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the radiation-induced cell death of tumor cells, we have examined the effect of 3-methyl pyruvate (MP). MP is a membrane-permeable pyruvate derivative that is capable of activating mitochondrial energy metabolism in human lung carcinoma A549 cells and murine squamous carcinoma SCCVII cells. Pretreatment with MP significantly enhanced radiation-induced cell death in both cell lines, and also led to increases in the mitochondrial membrane potential, intracellular adenosine triphosphate content, and mitochondria-derived ROS production following the exposure of the cells to X-rays. In A549 cells, MP-induced radiosensitization was completely abolished by vitamin C. In contrast, it was partially abolished in SCCVII cells. These results therefore suggest that the treatment of the cells with MP induced radiosensitization via the production of excess mitochondria-derived ROS in tumor cells. ",

Recent studies have shown that the let-7 microRNA and K-ras play an important role in the development of various cancers. However, the exact role between let-7 and K-ras in radon induced lung damage has not been explored so far. In the present study, wistar rats and human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells were long-term exposed to radon, and then alterations in histological pathology of rat lung tissue, ROS, antioxidant enzymes activities and clonogenic formation in HBE cells, as well as changes in let-7 and K-ras expression were determined to observe the adverse effects induced by radon. The results showed that long-term exposure to radon produced severe lung damage in rats, significantly increased ROS production and clonogenic formation ratios and decreased SOD activities in HBE cells. In addition, an obvious down-regulation of let-7 and up-regulation of K-ras were also revealed both in mRNA and in protein level in lung tissue of rats and HBE cells exposed to radon. Furthermore, a significant down-regulation of K-ras was then confirmed in both let-7b-3p and let-7a-2-3p transfected HBE cells. Taken together, the present results propose an involvement of let-7 microRNA and K-ras in radon induced lung damage both in vivo and in vitro, which may thus be of potential value in early diagnosis and therapy of radon-induced lung tumorgenesis.

Additionally, the quinone methide moiety of CE was shown to be essential for CE-mediated radiosensitization; in contrast, dihydrocelastrol (DHCE), does not contain this moiety. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by IR was augmented in combination with CE, which was responsible for CE-mediated radiosensitization. CE induced the thiol reactivity and inhibited the activities of antioxidant molecules, such as thioredoxin reductase and glutathione. In vivo, nude mouse xenografting data also revealed that tumor growth delay was greater in mice treated with CE plus IR, compared with those treated with CE or IR alone. When DHCE, instead of CE, was combined with IR, tumor growth delay was similar to that in IR alone-treated mice.

Augmented reactive oxygen species (ROS) and high glycolytic flux are common characteristics of malignant cells. We thus evaluated the effect of resveratrol on cancer cell glucose metabolism and investigated the role of ROS in the response.;Cancer cells were measured for cell content and (18)F-FDG uptake. Assays were performed for lactate production; hexokinase activity and intracellular ROS; and immunoblotting for hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin, and glucose transporter type 1 (Glut-1). Animal studies were performed with small-animal PET imaging of Lewis lung carcinoma tumor-bearing mice.;Resveratrol mildly decreased cell content and more pronouncedly suppressed (18)F-FDG uptake in Lewis lung carcinoma, HT-29 colon, and T47D breast cancer cells. Hence, (18)F-FDG uptake normalized to cell content was reduced to less than half of controls by 24-h exposure to resveratrol. This reduction was attributed to reduced glycolytic flux and Glut-1 expression. Resveratrol also decreased intracellular ROS in patterns that closely paralleled (18)F-FDG uptake. Scavenging of ROS with N-acetyl cysteine, but not inhibition of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase, was sufficient to suppress (18)F-FDG uptake. Conversely, ROS inducers effectively reversed the metabolic response of resveratrol. HIF-1α protein was markedly reduced by resveratrol, and inhibiting HIF-1α expression with cycloheximide or specific small interfering RNAs suppressed (18)F-FDG uptake. The proteosomal inhibitor MG132 partly restored HIF-1α level and (18)F-FDG uptake in resveratrol-treated cells. Resveratrol also inhibited Akt activation; in addition, inhibitors and small interfering RNAs against phosphoinositide 3-kinase decreased (18)F-FDG uptake. Finally, small-animal PET results showed resveratrol treatment to suppress tumor (18)F-FDG uptake in vivo.;Resveratrol suppresses cancer cell (18)F-FDG uptake and glycolytic metabolism in a manner that depends on the capacity of resveratrol to inhibit intracellular ROS, which downregulates HIF-1α accumulation.",

The present study investigates reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by PbCrO4 particles and cellular responses using RAW 264.7 cells. A mixture containing PbCrO4 and RAW 264.7 cells generated hydroxyl radical ((.)OH), using cellularly generated H2O2 as a precursor, as measured by electron spin resonance (ESR) spin trapping in combination with H2O2 and (.)OH scavengers, catalase and sodium formate. The effect of ascorbic acid on (.)OH radicals was also measured using ESR. Confocal microscopy showed that particles could become either bound to the cell surface or engulfed over a 120 min time period. H2O2 generation and O2 consumption were also increased after treatment of the cells with PbCrO4. Both NF-kappaB and AP-1 were activated after exposure to PbCrO4 particles as measured by the NF-kappaB or AP-1 luciferase reporter plasmid assay. Our investigation thus demonstrated that the RAW 264.7 cells phagocytized the PbCrO4 particles leading to accumulation of the particles within vacuoles in the cytoplasm.

Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is an active anti-oxidative component obtained from propolis, and has been shown to have beneficial effects on several respiratory disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer. However, the impact of CAPE on asthma is not well understood. Therefore, this study investigated the advantages of using CAPE to treat asthma and demonstrated the roles of CAPE in the regulation of airway microenvironments. In ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized mice, CAPE treatments notably reduced airway hyperresponsiveness, attenuated extensive inflammatory cell infiltration and inhibited goblet cell hyperplasia and collagen deposition and fibrosis. In addition, CAPE improved the airway microenvironment in a dose-dependent manner by inhibiting OVA-induced increases in immunoglobulin E, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 and suppressing matrix metalloproteinase-9 and alpha-smooth muscle actin expression as well as malondialdehyde production. To determine the underlying mechanisms responsible for these effects, we used TNF-α-stimulated BECs and TGF-β1-challenged human ASMCs to explore the impacts of CAPE on pro-inflammatory proteins and ASMC proliferation. The results indicated that CAPE significantly limited the secretion of eotaxin-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, IL-8 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and dramatically inhibited the proliferation of ASMCs. These effects were shown to be associated with decreased reactive oxidant species (ROS) levels. The phosphorylation of Akt and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) caused by increased ROS was significantly decreased by CAPE, which implied a contribution of ROS-MAPK/Akt signaling to the attenuation of asthma. Our findings indicated for the first time that CAPE alleviates airway inflammation and remodeling in chronic asthma by balancing the airway microenvironment, which highlights a novel profile of CAPE as a potent agent for asthma management.",

However, the way in which beta-HIVS induces apoptosis remains to be clarified. In this study, we performed cDNA array analysis and found that beta-HIVS suppressed the expression of the gene for tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1), which is a member of the heat-shock family of proteins. When human leukemia HL60 cells and human lung cancer DMS114 cells were treated with beta-HIVS, the amount of TRAP1 in mitochondria decreased in a time-dependent manner during apoptosis. A similar reduction in the level of TRAP1 was also observed upon exposure of cells to VP16. Treatment of DMS114 cells with TRAP1-specific siRNA sensitized the cells to beta-HIVS-induced apoptosis. Moreover, the reduction in the level of expression of TRAP1 by TRAP1-specific siRNA enhanced the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria when DMS114 cells were treated with either beta-HIVS or VP16. The suppression of the level of TRAP1 by either beta-HIVS or VP16 was blocked by N-acetyl-cysteine, indicating the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the regulation of the expression of TRAP1.

The characterization of ρ- cells indicated the presence of dysfunctional mitochondria and might thus serve a reliable model to investigate the role of mitochondria. In a gas inhalation chamber, ρ- and ρ+ cells were exposed to radon gas produced by a radium source. Results showed that apoptosis was significantly increased both in ρ- and ρ+ cells irradiated by radon. Moreover, apoptosis in ρ- cells showed a lower level than in ρ+ cells. Radon was further found to depress mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) of HBE cells with knockdown mtDNA. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was markedly elevated both in ρ- and ρ+ cells exposed to radon. The distribution of phases of cell cycle was different in ρ- compared to ρ+ cells. Radon irradiation induced a rise in G2/M and decrease in S phase in ρ+ cells. In ρ- cells, G1, G2/M, and S populations remained similar to cells exposed to radon. In conclusion, radon-induced changes in ROS generation, MMP and cell cycle are all attributed to reduction of apoptosis, which may trigger and promote cell transformation, leading to carcinogenesis.

We present data suggesting that resistance of fibroblasts to asbestos-induced carcinogenesis is likely to be connected with their lower ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to asbestos exposure and stricter control of proliferation of cells bearing asbestos/ROS-induced injuries. In fact, chrysotile (Mg6Si4O10(OH)8) asbestos exposure (5-10 microg/cm2) increased intracellular ROS and 8-oxo-guanine contents in rat pleural mesothelial cells, but not in lung fibroblasts. Simultaneously, moderate dosages of chrysotile and other agents increasing ROS levels (hydrogen peroxide, H2O2 and ethyl-methanesulfonate, EMS) inhibited cell cycle progression, in particular G1-to-S transition, in fibroblasts, but not in mesothelial cells. The arrested fibroblasts underwent cell death, while the majority of chrysotile-treated mesothelial cells survived. The differences in cell cycle response to asbestos/ROS-induced injuries correlated with distinct activity of p53-p21Cip1/Waf1 pathway in the two cell types. Chrysotile, H2O2 and EMS caused p53 upregulation in both cell types, but mesothelial cells, unlike fibroblasts, showed no accumulation of p21Cip1/Waf1. Of note, treatment with doxorubicin caused similar p53-dependent p21Cip1/Waf1 upregulation and cell cycle arrest in both cell types. This suggests differential response of fibroblasts and mesothelial cells specifically to asbestos/ROS exposure rather than to all DNA-damaging insults.",

In cells lacking p53, DNA damage does not trigger an effective cell-cycle arrest and in this setting promotes gene amplification. This is also increased in cells harboring oncogenic Ras, in which cell-cycle arrest is perturbed and ROS levels that cause DNA single strand breaks are elevated. This study focused on the effects of v-K-ras and p53 on Methotrexate (MTX)-mediated DHFR amplification. Rat lung epithelial cells expressing v-K-ras or murine lung cancer LKR cells harboring active K-ras continued cell-cycle progression when treated with MTX. However, upon loss of p53, amplification of DHFR and formation of MTX-resistant colonies occurred. Expression levels of cyclin A, Geminin, and Cdt1 were increased in v-K-ras transfectants. Geminin was sufficient to prevent the occurrence of multiple replications via interaction with Cdt1 after MTX treatment, and DHFR amplification proceeded in v-K-ras transfectants that possess a functional p53 in the absence of geminin. Taken together, our findings indicate that p53 not only regulates cell-cycle progression, but also functions through geminin to prevent DHFR amplification and protect genomic integrity.",

Inhibition of Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis by a dietary antioxidant is a novel approach. Quercetin is one of the most abundant dietary flavonoids widely present in many fruits and vegetables, possesses potent antioxidant and anticancer properties. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is a key oncomiR significantly elevated in the majority of human cancers that exerts its oncogenic activity by targeting the tumor suppressor gene programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4). The present study examined the effect of quercetin on the inhibition of Cr(VI)-induced malignant cell transformation and the role of miR-21-PDCD4 signaling involved. Our results showed that quercetin decreased ROS generation induced by Cr(VI) exposure in BEAS-2B cells. Chronic Cr(VI) exposure induced malignant cell transformation, increased miR-21 expression and caused inhibition of PDCD4, which were significantly inhibited by the treatment of quercetin in a dose dependent manner. Nude mice injected with BEAS-2B cells chronically exposed to Cr(VI) in the presence of quercetin showed reduced tumor incidence compared to Cr(VI) alone treated group. Stable knockdown of miR-21 and overexpression of PDCD4 or catalase in BEAS-2B cells suppressed Cr(VI)-induced malignant transformation and tumorigenesis.

In addition, the effect of P.g AgNPs on cell migration, apoptosis and the determination of the mechanism involve was determinate by the use of A549 lung cancer cell line. It was found that P.g AgNPs treatment inhibited cell viability and induced oxidative stress in A549, MCF7 and HepG2 cancer cell lines. Likewise, P.g AgNPs treatment inhibited the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-enhanced migration, as well as decreased the mRNA levels and phosphorylation of EGF receptors in A549 cells. Moreover, P.g AgNPs modified the morphology of the cell nucleus and increase apoptosis percentage; this effect was linked to the stimulation of p38 MAPK/p53 pathway. Taken together, our results showed that P.g AgNPs exhibited anti-cancer activity in A549 and the regulation of EGFR/p38 MAPK/p53 pathway might be the possible mechanism of its anti-activity.

Chronic inflammation has been linked to several human diseases and also to initiation and promotion of cancer. Generation of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), secretion of cytokines, chemokines and pro-angiogenic factors are believed to play a role. Interleukin IL-1beta, encoded by the IL1B gene, is a key cytokine produced and secreted by many cell types after activation by biological or chemical agents. Several polymorphisms in the IL1B gene have been identified, and some are associated with increased risk for lung cancer. Especially, the IL1B -31T/C polymorphism has received attention. We have investigated the effect of the lung carcinogens cigarette-smoke condensate (CSC) and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) on the promoters of the IL1B gene varying only at the site of the -31T/C polymorphism. The promoter fragments containing either C or T were cloned in luciferase reporter vectors and transfected into human lung epithelial NCI-H2009 cells. The results show that treatment of the transfected cells with CSC or B[a]P induced the promoter significantly above the control level.

It has been shown that NQO1 is also essential for the TNF-induced activation of NF-kappaB and that beta-lap suppresses the TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation. We investigated whether or not NQO1 is involved and beta-lap suppresses the radiation-induced NF-kappaB activation using A549 human lung cancer cells and NQO1-knock down A549 cells (shNQO1 A549 cells). Irradiation with 4 Gy markedly increased the DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB in A549 cells, but not in the shNQO1 A549 cells, thus demonstrating that NQO1 plays a pivotal role in irradiation-induced NF-kappaB activation. Treatment with 10 micronM beta-lap for 4 h almost completely abrogated the radiation-induced increase in NF-kappaB activation and the transcription of NF-kappaB target genes such as bcl2, gadd45beta and cyclinD1. Moreover, beta-lap markedly suppressed the activation of IkappaB kinase gamma (IKKgamma) and the subsequent phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha, thereby inhibiting NF-kappaB activation. It is concluded that beta-lap suppresses the radiation-induced activation of NF-kappaB by interrupting the involvement of NQO1 in the activation of NF-kappaB, thereby inhibiting the transcription of survival signals. The radiosensitization caused by beta-lap may, in part, be attributed to beta-lap-induced suppression of NF-kappaB activation.",

With its chaperone and PPIase activities, CypA contributes to the maintenance of correct conformation of nascent or denatured proteins and also provides protection against environmental insults. Also, its expression is induced in response to a wide variety of stressors including cancer. Upregulation of CypA in small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma has been reported. In some cancers a correlation between CypA overexpression and malignant transformation has been established. While molecular partners of CypA that promote cancer development are yet to be discovered, various mechanisms have been proposed to account for the cytoprotective functions of CypA during cancer development. CypA may promote the survival of cells under the stressful condition of cancer. CypA may well be essential for maintaining the conformation of oncogenic proteins, signalling proteins for cell proliferation, antiapoptotic components, transcription factors, or cell motility regulatory proteins. Antioxidant effects of CypA, which have been suggested by some researchers, may also become critical to reactive oxygen species (ROS) creating an oncogenetic environment. Developing new CypA inhibitors for therapeutics has been surmised from the cytoprotective functions of CypA and its overexpression in many cancer types.

Other less frequent causes are associated with indirect cigarette smoke, air pollutants, biomass fuels, and genetic mutations. COPD is often associated with heart disease, lung cancer, osteoporosis and conditions can worsen in patients with sudden falls. COPD also affects both innate and adaptive immune processes. Cigarette smoke increases the expression of matrix metalloproteases and proinflammatory chemokines and increases lung titers of natural killer cells and neutrophils. Yet, neutrophil reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated by the phagocytic respiratory burst and phagocytosis is impaired by nicotine. In contrast to innate immunity in COPD, dendritic cells represent leukocytes recruited to the lung that link the innate immune responses to adaptive immune responses by activating naïve T cells through antigen presentation. The autoimmune process that is also a significant part of inflammation associated with COPD. Moreover, coupled with restricted FEV1 values, are the prevalence of patients with single or multiple infections by bacteria, viruses and fungi. Finally, we focus on one of the more problematic infectious agents, the Gram-negative opportunistic pathogenic bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Specifically, we delve into the development of highly problematic biofilm infections that are highly refractory to conventional antibiotic therapies in COPD.

Cell death rates were determined 72 h after irradiation. Hypoxic cells exposed to the proton beam underwent a typical apoptotic program, showing condensed nuclei, fragmented DNA ladders, and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis revealed a significant increase in Annexin-V-positive cells. Cells treated with the proton beam and hypoxia displayed increased expression of p53, p21 and Bax, but decreased levels of phospho-Rb, Bcl-2 and XIAP, as well as activated caspase-9 and -3. The proton beam with hypoxia induced cell death in wild-type HCT116 cells, but not in a p53 knockout cell line, demonstrating a requirement for p53.

P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were activated by the treatment, and their respective DN mutants restored the cell death induced by either proton therapy alone or with hypoxia.

Both doxorubicin (DOX) and daunorubicin (DNR) were accumulated to a lesser extent and effluxed at a higher rate by MDR cells than by their drug-sensitive counterparts. In contrast, the 9-alkyl substituted compound, aclacinomycin A (ACL), was accumulated and effluxed from parent and MDR cells at an identical rate. In experiments designed to examine energy-dependent efflux, DOX and DNR were shown to be efficiently effluxed against the concentration gradient in the presence of glucose. However, in the same experiments the analogues ACL and Ro 31-3294 (9-alkyl and morpholinyl substituted), which have previously been shown to retain activity against MDR cell lines, were accumulated and effluxed at identical rates in parent and MDR EMT6 cells. Hence, 9-alkyl and morpholinyl substituted compounds appear to behave less favourably as substrates for energy-driven drug efflux by Pgp-positive MDR cells than do DOX or DNR. Resistance modifiers verapamil and cyclosporin A appeared to abolish energy-dependent efflux for DOX and DNR in both the EMT6 and H69 MDR lines whereas they had no effect on the cellular efflux of ACL.

Moore, a perennial plant distributed in the southeastern part of China, has been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine for thousands of years for its antitumor, antibacterial and immunoregulatory effects. In order to investigate the active components and the mechanism of the anti-tumor effects of Thalictrum fortunei, the growth inhibitory effects of eight triterpenoids isolated from the aerial parts of the plant on tumor cell lines were examined by 3-(4,5)-dimethylthiazoy1-3,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The MTT-assay results showed that the inhibitory activity of 3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-β-D-fucopyranosyl(22S,24Z)-cycloart-24-en-3β,22,26-triol 26-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (1) was stronger than that of the other seven tested triterpenoids on human hepatoma Bel-7402 cell line (Bel-7402), human colon lovo cells (LoVo), human non-small cells lung cancer NCIH-460 cells (NCIH-460) and human gastric carcinoma SGC-7901 cells (SGC-7901) after 48 h treatment in vitro, with the IC(50) values of 66.4, 84.8, 73.5, 89.6 μM, respectively. Moreover, the antitumor mechanism of compound 1 on Bel-7402 cell was explored through nucleus dyeing, fluorescence assay, flow cytometry and western blot. The flow cytometric analysis results revealed that compound 1 caused apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) loss in Bel-7402 cells. A fluorescence assay indicated that intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were markedly provoked by compound 1 treatment compared to control cells. Immunoblot results showed that compound 1 significantly increased the expression levels of cleaved caspase-3, P53 and Bax protein, and decreased the expression level of Bcl-2 protein. These findings indicate that compound 1 inhibits the growth activity of tumor cells, probably through the P53 protein-induced apoptosis pathway.",

        "Doc_abstract":"alpha-Hederin, a pentacyclic triterpene saponin isolated from the seeds of Nigella sativa, was recently reported to have potent in vivo antitumor activity against LL/2 (Lewis Lung carcinoma) in BDF1 mice. In this study we observed that alpha-hederin caused a dose- and time-dependent increase in apoptosis of murine leukemia P388 cells. In order to evaluate the possible mechanisms for apoptosis, the effects of alpha-hederin on intracellular thiol concentration, including reduced glutathione (GSH), and protein thiols, and the effects of pretreatment with N-acetlycysteine (NAC), a precursor of intracellular GSH synthesis, or buthionine sulfoxime (BSO), a specific inhibitor of intracellular GSH synthesis, on alpha-hederin-induced apoptosis were investigated. It was found that alpha-hederin rapidly depleted intracellular GSH and protein thiols prior to the occurrence of apoptosis. NAC significantly alleviated alpha-hederin-induced apoptosis, while BSO augmented alpha-hederin-induced apoptosis significantly. The depletion of cellular thiols observed after alpha-hederin treatment caused disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (deltapsi(m)) and subsequently increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in P388 cells at an early time point. Bongkrekic acid (BA), a ligand of the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator, and cyclosporin (CsA) attenuated the alpha-hederin-induced loss of deltapsi(m), and ROS production. Thus, oxidative stress after alpha-hederin treatment is an important event in alpha-hederin-induced apoptosis. As observed in this study, permeability transition of mitochondrial membrane occurs after depletion of GSH and precedes a state of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Further, we observed that alpha-hederin caused the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to cytosol, leading to caspase-3 activation. Our findings thus demonstrate that changes in intracellular thiols and redox status leading to perturbance of mitochondrial functions are important components in the mechanism of alpha-hederin-induced cell death.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The hypoxic areas of solid cancers represent a negative prognostic factor irrespective of which treatment modality is chosen for the patient. Still, after almost 80 years of focus on the problems created by hypoxia in solid tumours, we still largely lack methods to deal efficiently with these treatment-resistant cells. The consequences of this lack may be serious for many patients: Not only is there a negative correlation between the hypoxic fraction in tumours and the outcome of radiotherapy as well as many types of chemotherapy, a correlation has been shown between the hypoxic fraction in tumours and cancer metastasis. Thus, on a fundamental basis the great variety of problems related to hypoxia in cancer treatment has to do with the broad range of functions oxygen (and lack of oxygen) have in cells and tissues. Therefore, activation-deactivation of oxygen-regulated cascades related to metabolism or external signalling are important areas for the identification of mechanisms as potential targets for hypoxia-specific treatment. Also the chemistry related to reactive oxygen radicals (ROS) and the biological handling of ROS are part of the problem complex. The problem is further complicated by the great variety in oxygen concentrations found in tissues. For tumour hypoxia to be used as a marker for individualisation of treatment there is a need for non-invasive methods to measure oxygen routinely in patient tumours. A large-scale collaborative EU-financed project 2009-2014 denoted METOXIA has studied all the mentioned aspects of hypoxia with the aim of selecting potential targets for new hypoxia-specific therapy and develop the first stage of tests for this therapy. A new non-invasive PET-imaging method based on the 2-nitroimidazole [(18)F]-HX4 was found to be promising in a clinical trial on NSCLC patients. New preclinical models for testing of the metastatic potential of cells were developed, both in vitro (2D as well as 3D models) and in mice (orthotopic grafting). Low density quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based assays were developed measuring multiple hypoxia-responsive markers in parallel to identify tumour hypoxia-related patterns of gene expression. As possible targets for new therapy two main regulatory cascades were prioritised: The hypoxia-inducible-factor (HIF)-regulated cascades operating at moderate to weak hypoxia (<1% O(2)), and the unfolded protein response (UPR) activated by endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) stress and operating at more severe hypoxia (<0.2%). The prioritised targets were the HIF-regulated proteins carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), the lactate transporter MCT4 and the PERK/eIF2α/ATF4-arm of the UPR. The METOXIA project has developed patented compounds targeting CAIX with a preclinical documented effect. Since hypoxia-specific treatments alone are not curative they will have to be combined with traditional anti-cancer therapy to eradicate the aerobic cancer cell population as well.",

Jurkat and MCF-7 cells overexpressing Bcl2, and L929 and MCF-7 over-expressing a dominant-negative mutant of a pro-apoptotic BNIP3 (DeltaTM-BNIP3) were largely resistant towards Brevinin-2R treatment. The decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim), or total cellular ATP levels, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, but not caspase activation or the release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) or endonuclease G (Endo G), were early indicators of Brevinin-2R-triggered death.

Four of the smoke induced genes are aldo-keto reductases (AKR), enzymes that metabolically activate PAH to PAH o-quinones. Alternatively, PAHs are metabolized to (±)-anti-diol epoxides, such as (±)-anti-benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide ((±)-anti-BPDE)), by the combined action of P4501A1/1B1 and epoxide hydrolase. (±)-anti-BPDE forms DNA adducts directly, while PAH o-quinones cause DNA damage by oxidative stress through a futile redox cycle. To address the role of AKRs in PAH cytotoxicity, we compared the cytotoxicity of PAH metabolites and the effects of overexpressing AKR1A1 in lung cells. (±)-anti-BPDE and B[a]P-7,8-trans-dihydrodiol, an intermediate in (±)-anti-BPDE metabolism, are toxic to A549 cells at concentrations with an IC(50) of ∼2 μM. In contrast, the PAH o-quinone B[a]P-7,8-dione was about 10-fold less toxic to A549 cells with an IC(50) > 20 μM. Similar differences in cytoxicity were observed with two other PAH o-quinones (benz[a]anthracene-3,4-dione and 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-3,4-dione) compared with their respective diol-epoxide counterparts (BA-3,4-diol-1,2-epoxide and DMBA-3,4-diol-1,2-epoxide). In addition, both anti-BPDE and B[a]P-7,8-trans-dihydrodiol induced p53 expression ∼6 h post-treatment at concentrations as low as 1 μM consistent with extensive DNA damage. B[a]P-7,8-dione treatment did not induce p53 but generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in A549 cells and induced the expression of oxidative response genes in H358 cells. We also observed that overexpression of AKR1A1 in H358 cells, which otherwise have low levels of AKR expression, protected cells 2-10-fold from the toxic effects of B[a]P-7,8-trans-dihydrodiol. These data suggest that overexpression of AKRs may protect lung cancer cells from the acute toxic effects of PAH.",

Therefore, targeting the AOS response proteins that are exploited by cancer cells is an attractive therapeutic strategy. In order to identify the AOS genes that are suspected to support cancer progression and resistance, we analyzed the expression patterns of 285 genes annotated for being involved in oxidative stress in 994 tumors and 353 normal tissues. Thereby we identified a signature of 116 genes that are highly overexpressed in multiple carcinomas while being only minimally expressed in normal tissues. To establish which of these genes are more likely to functionally drive cancer resistance and progression, we further identified those whose overexpression correlates with negative patient outcome in breast and lung carcinoma. Gene-set enrichment, GO, network, and pathway analyses revealed that members of the thioredoxin and glutathione pathways are prominent components of this oncogenic signature and that activation of these pathways is common feature of many cancer entities. Interestingly, a large fraction of these AOS genes are downstream targets of the transcription factors NRF2, NF-kappaB and FOXM1, and relay on NADPH for their enzymatic activities highlighting promising drug targets. We discuss these findings and propose therapeutic strategies that may be applied to overcome cancer resistance. ",
