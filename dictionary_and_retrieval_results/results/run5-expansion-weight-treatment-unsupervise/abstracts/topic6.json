        "Doc_abstract":"The determination of NRAS and BRAF mutation status is a major requirement in the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma. Mutation specific antibodies against NRAS(Q61R) and BRAF(V600E) proteins could offer additional data on tumor heterogeneity. The specificity and sensitivity of NRAS(Q61R) immunohistochemistry have recently been reported excellent. We aimed to determine the utility of immunohistochemistry using SP174 anti-NRAS(Q61R) and VE1 anti-BRAF(V600E) antibodies in the theranostic mutation screening of melanomas.;142 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded melanoma samples from 79 patients were analyzed using pyrosequencing and immunohistochemistry.;23 and 26 patients were concluded to have a NRAS-mutated or a BRAF-mutated melanoma respectively. The 23 NRAS (Q61R) and 23 BRAF (V600E) -mutant samples with pyrosequencing were all positive in immunohistochemistry with SP174 antibody and VE1 antibody respectively, without any false negative. Proportions and intensities of staining were varied. Other NRAS (Q61L) , NRAS (Q61K) , BRAF (V600K) and BRAF (V600R) mutants were negative in immunohistochemistry. 6 single cases were immunostained but identified as wild-type using pyrosequencing (1 with SP174 and 5 with VE1). 4/38 patients with multiple samples presented molecular discordant data. Technical limitations are discussed to explain those discrepancies. Anyway we could not rule out real tumor heterogeneity.;In our study, we showed that combining immunohistochemistry analysis targeting NRAS(Q61R) and BRAF(V600E) proteins with molecular analysis was a reliable theranostic tool to face challenging samples of melanoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"BRAF and NRAS mutations are frequently found in melanoma tumours, and recently developed BRAF-targeted therapies demonstrate significant clinical benefit.;We sought to investigate the clinical significance of BRAF and NRAS mutations in a clinic-based metastatic melanoma cohort.;In total, 237 tumours, mostly metastatic lesions, from 203 patients were screened for mutations in exon 15 of BRAF and exon 2 of NRAS using Sanger sequencing. BRAF and NRAS mutation status was analysed in relation to clinical and histopathological characteristics, and outcome.;Mutation in BRAF and NRAS was present in 43% (88% V600E, 10% V600K) and 30% (48% Q61K, 40% Q61R) of metastatic melanomas, respectively. We found consistent BRAF and NRAS mutation status in all but one of 27 patients with multiple metastases. BRAF mutation was associated with younger age at primary diagnosis (P = 0.02). Among patients with distant metastatic melanoma, patients with BRAF-mutant tumours without BRAF inhibitor treatment had inferior survival compared with patients with BRAF inhibitor treatment [hazard ratio (HR) 2.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10-5.01, P = 0.03]. We also observed a trend towards better prognosis for patients with wild-type and NRAS-mutant tumours compared with BRAF V600E-mutant tumours (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.39-1.04, P = 0.07; and HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.48-1.21, P = 0.25, respectively).;We were able to confirm the effect of BRAF inhibitor treatment in a single clinical institution. The results suggest further that BRAF mutation is a weak prognostic factor but a strong predictive factor and that BRAF-mutant melanoma might constitute one or more distinct subtypes of the disease with certain aetiology and clinical outcome.",
