        "Doc_abstract":"The PI3K-PTEN-AKT signaling pathway is involved in various cellular activities, including proliferation, migration, cell growth, cell survival and differentiation during adult homeostasis as well as in tumorigenesis. It has been suggested that the constitutive activation of PI3K/AKT signaling with concurrent loss of function of the tumor suppressor molecule PTEN contributes to cancer formation. Members of the PI3K-PTEN-AKT pathway, including these proteins and mTOR, are altered in melanoma tumors and cell lines. A hallmark of activation of the pathway is the loss of function of PTEN. Indeed, loss of heterozygosity of PTEN has been observed in approximately 30% of human melanomas, implicating this signaling pathway in this cancer. PI3K signaling activation, via loss of PTEN function, can inhibit proapoptotic genes such as the FoxO family of transcription factors, while inducing cell growth- and cell survival-related elements such as p70S6K and AKT. Determining how the PI3K-PTEN-AKT signaling pathway, alone or in cooperation with other pathways, orchestrates the induction of target genes involved in a diverse range of activities is a major challenge in research into melanoma initiation and progression. Moreover, the acquisition of basic knowledge will help patient management with appropriate therapies that are already, or will shortly be, on the market.",

Therapy targeting a signaling pathway critical to the cancer's growth can provide dramatic benefit in several other malignancies and may be a valuable strategy for advanced melanoma, if drugs with a favorable therapeutic index are effective against essential molecular pathways. One such target is the V600E \"gain-of-function\" BRAF mutation found in 60% of melanomas; other mutations or molecular alterations cooperate with V600E BRAF, particularly those that cause loss of function of PTEN, upstream of Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin.

In the present study, we used mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics to determine how BRAF inhibition remodeled the signaling network of melanoma cell lines that were BRAF mutant and PTEN null. Short-term BRAF inhibition was associated with marked changes in fibronectin-based adhesion signaling that were PTEN dependent. These effects were recapitulated through BRAF siRNA knockdown and following treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs. Increased fibronectin expression was also observed in mouse xenograft models as well as specimens from melanoma patients undergoing BRAF inhibitor treatment. Analysis of a melanoma tissue microarray showed loss of PTEN expression to predict for a lower overall survival, with a trend for even lower survival being seen when loss of fibronectin was included in the analysis. Mechanistically, the induction of fibronectin limited the responses of these PTEN-null melanoma cell lines to vemurafenib, with enhanced cytotoxicity observed following the knockdown of either fibronectin or its receptor α5β1 integrin. This in turn abrogated the cytotoxic response to BRAF inhibition via increased AKT signaling, which prevented the induction of cell death by maintaining the expression of the pro-survival protein Mcl-1. The protection conveyed by the induction of FN expression could be overcome through combined treatment with a BRAF and PI3K inhibitor. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"The conserved serine/threonine kinase mTOR (the mammalian target of rapamycin), a downstream effector of the PI3K/AKT pathway, forms two distinct multiprotein complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 is sensitive to rapamycin, activates S6K1 and 4EBP1, which are involved in mRNA translation. It is activated by diverse stimuli, such as growth factors, nutrients, energy and stress signals, and essential signalling pathways, such as PI3K, MAPK and AMPK, in order to control cell growth, proliferation and survival. mTORC2 is considered resistant to rapamycin and is generally insensitive to nutrients and energy signals. It activates PKC-α and AKT and regulates the actin cytoskeleton. Deregulation of multiple elements of the mTOR pathway (PI3K amplification/mutation, PTEN loss of function, AKT overexpression, and S6K1, 4EBP1 and eIF4E overexpression) has been reported in many types of cancers, particularly in melanoma, where alterations in major components of the mTOR pathway were reported to have significant effects on tumour progression. Therefore, mTOR is an appealing therapeutic target and mTOR inhibitors, including the rapamycin analogues deforolimus, everolimus and temsirolimus, are submitted to clinical trials for treating multiple cancers, alone or in combination with inhibitors of other pathways. Importantly, temsirolimus and everolimus were recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma, PNET and giant cell astrocytoma. Small molecules that inhibit mTOR kinase activity and dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitors are also being developed. In this review, we aim to survey relevant research, the molecular mechanisms of signalling, including upstream activation and downstream effectors, and the role of mTOR in cancer, mainly in melanoma.",

Both incidence and mortality rates continue to rise each year, with no effective long-term treatment on the horizon. In part, this reflects lack of identification of critical genes involved and specific therapies targeted to correct these defects. We report that selective activation of the Akt3 protein promotes cell survival and tumor development in 43 to 60% of nonfamilial melanomas. The predominant Akt isoform active in melanomas was identified by showing that small interfering RNA (siRNA) against only Akt3, and not Akt1 or Akt2, lowered the amount of phosphorylated (active) Akt in melanoma cells. The amount of active Akt3 increased progressively during melanoma tumor progression with highest levels present in advanced-stage metastatic melanomas. Mechanisms of Akt3 deregulation occurred through a combination of overexpression of Akt3 accompanying copy number increases of the gene and decreased PTEN protein function occurring through loss or haploinsufficiency of the PTEN gene. Targeted reduction of Akt3 activity with siRNA or by expressing active PTEN protein stimulated apoptotic signaling, which reduced cell survival by increasing apoptosis rates thereby inhibiting melanoma tumor development. Identifying Akt3 as a selective target in melanoma cells provides new therapeutic opportunities for patients in the advanced stages of this disease.",

The BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib significantly improved overall survival. However, brain metastases still limit the effectiveness of this therapy. In a series of patients, we observed that treatment with vemurafenib resulted in substantial regression of extracerebral metastases, but brain metastases developed. This study aimed to identify factors that contribute to treatment resistance in brain metastases. Matched brain and extracerebral metastases from melanoma patients had identical ERK, p-ERK, and AKT immunohistochemistry staining patterns, but there was hyperactivation of AKT (p-AKT) and loss of PTEN expression in the brain metastases. Mutation analysis revealed no differences in BRAF, NRAS, or KIT mutation status in matched brain and extracerebral metastases. In contrast, AKT, p-AKT, and PTEN expression was identical in monolayer cultures derived from melanoma brain and extracerebral metastases. Furthermore, melanoma cells stimulated by astrocyte-conditioned medium showed higher AKT activation and invasiveness than melanoma cells stimulated by fibroblast-conditioned medium. Inhibition of PI3K-AKT signaling resensitized melanoma cells isolated from a vemurafenib-resistant brain metastasis to vemurafenib. Brain-derived factors appear to induce hyperactivation of the AKT survival pathway and to promote the survival and drug resistance of melanoma cells in the brain. Thus, inhibition of PI3K-AKT signaling shows potential for enhancing and/or prolonging the antitumor effect of BRAF inhibitors or other anticancer agents in melanoma brain metastases.",

Sustained PI3'-lipid production commonly occurs via silencing of the PI3'-lipid phosphatase PTEN or, less commonly, through mutational activation of PIK3CA, encoding the 110-kDa catalytic subunit of PI3'-kinase-α (PI3Kα). To define the PI3K catalytic isoform dependency of BRAF-mutated melanoma, we used pharmacologic, isoform-selective PI3K inhibitors in conjunction with melanoma-derived cell lines and genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models. Although BRAF(V600E)/PIK3CA(H1047R) melanomas were sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of selective PI3Kα blockade, inhibition of BRAF(V600E)/PTEN(Null) melanoma proliferation required combined blockade of PI3Kα, PI3Kδ, and PI3Kγ, and was insensitive to PI3Kβ blockade. In GEM models, isoform-selective PI3K inhibition elicited cytostatic effects, but significantly potentiated melanoma regression in response to BRAF(V600E) pathway-targeted inhibition. Interestingly, PI3K inhibition forestalled the onset of MEK inhibitor resistance in two independent GEM models of BRAF(V600E)-driven melanoma. These results suggest that combination therapy with PI3K inhibitors may be a useful strategy to extend the duration of clinical response of patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma to BRAF(V600E) pathway-targeted therapies.;Although BRAF(V600E) pathway-targeted therapies elicit melanoma regression, the onset of drug resistance limits the durability of response.

Cotreatment of BRAF-mutated melanoma cell lines with phenformin and PLX4720 resulted in synergistic inhibition of cell viability, compared with the effects of the single agent alone. Moreover, treatment with phenformin significantly delayed the development of resistance to PLX4720 in cultured melanoma cells. Biochemical analyses showed that phenformin and PLX4720 exerted cooperative effects on inhibiting mTOR signaling and inducing apoptosis. Noticeably, phenformin selectively targeted subpopulations of cells expressing JARID1B, a marker for slow cycling melanoma cells, whereas PLX4720 selectively targeted JARID1B-negative cells. Finally, in contrast to their use as single agents, the combination of phenformin and PLX4720 induced tumor regression in both nude mice bearing melanoma xenografts and in a genetically engineered BRAF(V600E)/PTEN(null)-driven mouse model of melanoma.

One key is to better understand the cross-talk between epidermal keratinocytes and pigment-producing melanocytes. Here, using a bigenic mouse model system combining mutant oncogenic NRAS(Q61K) (constitutively active RAS) or mutant activated CDK4(R24C/R24C) (prevents binding of CDK4 by kinase inhibitor p16(INK4A)) with an epidermis-specific knockout of the nuclear retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα(ep-/-)) results in increased melanoma formation after chronic ultraviolet-B (UVB) irradiation compared with control mice with functional RXRα. Melanomas from both groups of bigenic RXRα(ep-/-) mice are larger in size with higher proliferative capacity, and exhibit enhanced angiogenic properties and increased expression of malignant melanoma markers. Analysis of tumor adjacent normal skin from these mice revealed altered expression of several biomarkers indicative of enhanced melanoma susceptibility, including reduced expression of tumor suppressor p53 and loss of PTEN, with concomitant increase in activated AKT. Loss of epidermal RXRα in combination with UVB significantly enhances invasion of melanocytic cells to draining lymph nodes in bigenic mice expressing oncogenic NRAS(Q61K) compared with controls with functional RXRα. These results suggest a crucial role of keratinocytic RXRα to suppress formation of UVB-induced melanomas and their progression to malignant cancers in the context of driver mutations such as activated CDK4(R24C/R24C) or oncogenic NRAS(Q61K).;These findings suggest that RXRα may serve as a clinical diagnostic marker and therapeutic target in melanoma progression and metastasis.",

We applied microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization, gene expression and CpG island methylation analysis of primary tumors and multiple metastases from five melanoma patients with the aim of analyzing the molecular patterns of melanoma progression. Epigenetic profiling showed that the multiple metastases after a single primary melanoma share similar methylation patterns for many genes, although differences in methylation between the lesions were evident for several genes, example, PTEN, TFAP2C, and RARB. In addition, DNA copy number and global gene expression profiles of tumors from individual patients were highly similar, confirming common origin of metastases. Some of the identified genomic aberrations, for example, gain of chromosome 6p and loss of chromosomes 6q and 10, persisted during progression, indicating early changes highly important for melanoma development. Homozygous deletions at 3p26.1 and 6q23.2-q23.3 appeared in two consecutive metastases originating from the same primary tumor, respectively, in a mutually exclusive manner that provides evidence for two genetically different subclones. However, in another case, the similarity of the copy number aberrations in subsequent metastatic lesions suggests sequential metastatic development through the clonal evolution. These data are further corroborated by a switch in CDH1 and CDH2 expression between metastases from the same patient. In conclusion, our results provide evidence for different models of metastatic progression in melanoma.",

In keeping with previous reports, we found frequent LOH on chromosome arms 9p (72%), 10p (55%), 10q (55%), 9q (49%), 6q (43%), 11q (43%), and 17p (41%). Tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) can be identified through homozygous deletion (HD). We detected 174 HDs, the most common of which targeted CDKN2A (n = 33). The second highest frequency of HD occurred in PTEN (n = 8), another well known melanoma TSG. HDs were also common for PTPRD (n = 7) and HDAC4 (n = 3), TSGs recently found to be mutated or deleted in other cancer types. Analysis of other HDs and regions of LOH that we have identified might lead to the characterization of further melanoma TSGs. We noted 197 regional amplifications, including some centered on the melanoma oncogenes MITF (n = 9), NRAS (n = 3), BRAF (n = 3), and CCND1 (n = 3). Other amplifications potentially target novel oncogenes important in the development of a subset of melanomas.

It is thus important to have a better understanding of the molecular resistance mechanisms to improve patient survival benefit from these agents. Here we show that BRAFV600E is a negative regulator of the AKT pathway. Expression of BRAFV600E in NIH3T3 cells significantly suppresses MEK inhibitor (RG7167) or mTORC1 inhibitor (rapamycin) induced AKT phosphorylation (pAKT) and downstream signal activation. Treatment-induced pAKT elevation is found in BRAF wild type melanoma cells but not in a subset of melanoma cell lines harboring BRAFV600E. Knock-down of BRAFV600E in these melanoma cells elevates basal pAKT and downstream signals, whereas knock-down of CRAF, MEK1/2 or ERK1/2 or treatment with a BRAF inhibitor have no impact on pAKT. Mechanistically, we show that BRAFV600E interacts with rictor complex (mTORC2) and regulates pAKT through mTORC2. BRAFV600E is identified in mTORC2 after immunoprecipitation of rictor. Knock-down of rictor abrogates BRAFV600E depletion induced pAKT. Knock-down of BRAFV600E enhances cellular enzyme activity of mTORC2. Aberrant activation of AKT pathway by PTEN loss appears to override the negative impact of BRAFV600E on pAKT. Taken together, our findings suggest that in a subset of BRAFV600E melanoma cells, BRAFV600E negatively regulates AKT pathway in a rictor-dependent, MEK/ERK and BRAF kinase-independent manner.

Nevertheless, drug resistance develops in treated patients, and strategies to overcome primary and acquired resistance are required. To explore the molecular mechanisms involved in primary resistance to PLX4032, we investigated its effects on cell proliferation and signaling in a panel of 27 genetically characterized patient-derived melanoma cell lines. Cell sensitivity to PLX4032 was dependent on BRAF(V600E) and independent from other gene alterations that commonly occur in melanoma such as PTEN loss, BRAF, and MITF gene amplification. Two cell lines lacking sensitivity to PLX4032 and harboring a different set of genetic alterations were studied as models of primary resistance. Treatment with the MEK inhibitor UO126 but not with PLX4032 inhibited cell growth and ERK activation. Resistance to PLX4032 was maintained after CRAF down-regulation by siRNA indicating alternative activation of MEK-ERK signaling. Genetic characterization by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and analysis of phosphotyrosine signaling by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis revealed the activation of MET and SRC signaling, associated with the amplification of MET and of CTNNB1 and CCND1 genes, respectively. The combination of PLX4032 with drugs or siRNA targeting MET was effective in inhibiting cell growth and reducing cell invasion and migration in melanoma cells with MET amplification; similar effects were observed after targeting SRC in the other cell line, indicating a role for MET and SRC signaling in primary resistance to PLX4032.

Mutations or deletions of PTEN have been observed in up to 60% of melanoma cell lines, resulting in PI3K/Akt activation. The Forkhead family of transcription factors induce apoptosis in their unphosphorylated forms and were recently reported to be a substrate of Akt kinase. In the present study, an adenovirus expressing a triple mutant (TM) of FKHRL1, which cannot be phosphorylated by Akt, was assessed for its ability to induce apoptosis in melanoma cells. Marked overexpression of FKHRL1/TM was evident in the SK-MEL-2 cell line 24 hours after infection with Ad-FKHRL1/TM by Western blot analysis. The expression of FKHRL1/ TM was moderately delayed in SK-MEL-28 cells. Overexpression of FKHRL1/TM can efficiently inhibit melanoma cell growth and result in rapid loss of cell viability. Cell cycle analysis showed overexpression of FKHRL1/TM in both melanoma cell lines resulted in development of a Sub-G1 population, indicating apoptosis by Ad-FKHRL1/TM infection. Apoptosis was confirmed by morphologic inspection, poly-ADP-ribosepolymerase (PARP) cleavage assay, and annexin V-PE analysis. After Ad-FKHRL1/TM infection, the expression of Bax and Bak did not differ markedly, whereas Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L) levels decreased markedly. Involvement of caspase 3 and 6 in FKHRL1/TM-mediated apoptosis was demonstrated by cleavage of caspase 3/CPP32 and PARP as well as fragmentation of the caspase 6 substrate lamin B in SK-MEL-2 cells as early as 24 hours after Ad-FKHRL1/ TM infection, but those events were delayed 72 hours in SK-MEL-28. In addition, we found that p27(kip1) was cleaved in SK-MEL-2 cells at 24 hours after treatment with Ad-FKHRL1/TM. This cleavage was observed in SK-MEL-28 cells until 72 hours after infection with Ad-FKHRL1/TM.

A number of proteins including cell cycle regulators (cyclin dependent kinase 1, cyclin dependent kinase 2, and cyclin dependent kinase 3), MAPK pathway components (Extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 and Extracellular signal regulated kinase 2), interferon regulators (tyrosine kinase-2), GTPase regulators (Ras-Rasb interactor 1), and controllers of protein tyrosine phosphorylation (dual specificity tyrosine (Y) phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A and protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type A) were common to all genotypes. Treatment of a BRAF-mutant/phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) null melanoma cell line with vemurafenib led to decreased phosphorylation of ERK, phospholipase C1, and β-catenin with increases in receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation, signal transduction and activator of signaling 3, and glycogen synthase kinase 3α noted. In NRAS-mutant melanoma, MEK inhibition led to increased phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway components, Src family kinases, and protein kinase Cδ with decreased phosphorylation seen in STAT3 and ERK1/2.

Characteristic chromosomal abnormalities are common and include 6p gain, associated with a good prognosis, as well as 1p loss, 3 loss, and 8q gain, which correlate with high mortality. These are identified by techniques such as fluorescence in situ hybridisation, comparative genomic hybridisation, microsatellite analysis, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. UM can also be categorised by their gene expression profiles as class 1 or class 2, the latter correlating with poor survival, as do BRCA1-associated protein-1 (BAP1) inactivating mutations.

GDC-0980 potently inhibits signal transduction downstream of both PI3K and mTOR, as measured by pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers, thereby acting upon two key pathway nodes to produce the strongest attainable inhibition of signaling in the pathway. Correspondingly, GDC-0980 was potent across a broad panel of cancer cell lines, with the greatest potency in breast, prostate, and lung cancers and less activity in melanoma and pancreatic cancers, consistent with KRAS and BRAF acting as resistance markers. Treatment of cancer cell lines with GDC-0980 resulted in G1 cell-cycle arrest, and in contrast to mTOR inhibitors, GDC-0980 induced apoptosis in certain cancer cell lines, including those with direct pathway activation via PI3K and PTEN. Low doses of GDC-0980 potently inhibited tumor growth in xenograft models including those with activated PI3K, loss of LKB1 or PTEN, and elicited an exposure-related decrease in PD biomarkers.

The molecular determinants of immune resistance are poorly understood. We show that loss of PTEN in tumor cells in preclinical models of melanoma inhibits T cell-mediated tumor killing and decreases T-cell trafficking into tumors. In patients, PTEN loss correlates with decreased T-cell infiltration at tumor sites, reduced likelihood of successful T-cell expansion from resected tumors, and inferior outcomes with PD-1 inhibitor therapy. PTEN loss in tumor cells increased the expression of immunosuppressive cytokines, resulting in decreased T-cell infiltration in tumors, and inhibited autophagy, which decreased T cell-mediated cell death. Treatment with a selective PI3Kβ inhibitor improved the efficacy of both anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies in murine models. Together, these findings demonstrate that PTEN loss promotes immune resistance and support the rationale to explore combinations of immunotherapies and PI3K-AKT pathway inhibitors.;This study adds to the growing evidence that oncogenic pathways in tumors can promote resistance to the antitumor immune response.

Each type of tumor investigated had specific pattern of analyzed genetic alterations. The most prominent genetic changes were mutual alterations in PTEN and p53 tumor suppressors present in breast cancer and two melanomas. These co-alterations could be crucial for promoting development of multiple malignancies. Moreover the insertion in 4(th) codon of HRAS gene was common for all tumor types investigated.

Additional studies targeting the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in this disease are warranted.",
