        "Doc_abstract":"BRAF mutations promote melanoma cell proliferation and survival primarily through activation of MEK. The purpose of this study was to determine the response rate (RR) for the selective, allosteric MEK1/MEK2 inhibitor trametinib (GSK1120212), in patients with metastatic BRAF-mutant melanoma.;This was an open-label, two-stage, phase II study with two cohorts. Patients with metastatic BRAF-mutant melanoma previously treated with a BRAF inhibitor (cohort A) or treated with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy (BRAF-inhibitor naive; cohort B) were enrolled. Patients received 2 mg of trametinib orally once daily.;In cohort A (n = 40), there were no confirmed objective responses and 11 patients (28%) with stable disease (SD); the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 1.8 months. In cohort B (n = 57), there was one (2%) complete response, 13 (23%) partial responses (PRs), and 29 patients (51%) with SD (confirmed RR, 25%); the median PFS was 4.0 months. One patient each with BRAF K601E and BRAF V600R had prolonged PR. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events for all patients were skin-related toxicity, nausea, peripheral edema, diarrhea, pruritis, and fatigue. No cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma was observed.;Trametinib was well tolerated. Significant clinical activity was observed in BRAF-inhibitor-naive patients previously treated with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy. Minimal clinical activity was observed as sequential therapy in patients previously treated with a BRAF inhibitor. Together, these data suggest that BRAF-inhibitor resistance mechanisms likely confer resistance to MEK-inhibitor monotherapy. These data support further evaluation of trametinib in BRAF-inhibitor-naive BRAF-mutant melanoma, including rarer forms of BRAF-mutant melanoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Inhibitors targeting active protein kinases, such as EGFR or ALK, have demonstrated significant efficacy in the treatment of lung cancer. Activating mutations in the MAPK pathway, which includes the enzymes RAS, RAF, MEK, and ERK, result in constitutive signalling, leading to oncogenic cell proliferation and escape from apoptosis; therefore this pathway is a focus of crucial interest for the development of cancer drugs. In melanoma, the most commonly mutated gene is BRAF, with mutations usually occurring in about 50% of all tumours. The BRAF Val600Glu (V600E) mutation constitutes more than 90% of mutations in melanoma. V600E BRAF mutation shows a great dependency on MEK activity, and offers a rational therapeutic strategy for this genetically defined tumour subtype. The use of vemurafenib and dabrafenib, agents that block MAPK signaling in patients with melanoma and the BRAF V600E mutation, has been associated with prolonged survival and progression-free survival. The frequency of V600E BRAF mutation in lung adenocarcinoma is 1.5% to 2.8%. Treatment of V600E BRAF-mutant lung adenocarcinomas with dabrafenib is under evaluation in a phase 2 trial, and could represent another milestone in individualized therapy for lung cancer patients. The next step will be a combination therapy of BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and MEK inhibitor trametinib. ",
