        "Doc_abstract":"Colon carcinoma and melanoma cells containing either a deletion of the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor protein (APC) or mutation of the site in beta-catenin phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) display elevated levels of detergent-soluble beta-catenin due to insensitivity of the cytosolic protein to proteasome-dependent degradation. In this study, we have examined the effect of beta-catenin mutation (S37F) or APC loss on the proteasome sensitivity of additional subcellular beta-catenin pools in melanoma cells. In contrast to detergent-soluble beta-catenin, the detergent-insoluble protein remains proteasome-sensitive irrespective of S37F mutation or APC status. This insoluble component appears associated primarily with nuclear cytoskeletal elements. In addition, DNase I treatment solubilized a portion of detergent-insoluble beta-catenin, suggesting that this fraction also contains chromatin-associated protein, and correlating with a proteasome-sensitive elevation in beta-catenin-stimulated reporter activity. Since the detergent-insoluble nuclear component of beta-catenin displays GSK-3beta- and APC-independent proteasome sensitivity, distinct from the soluble nuclear and cytosolic pools of this protein, regulation of beta-catenin proteasome sensitivity and the contribution of this process to beta-catenin function may be more complex than previously appreciated.",

The mean survival after diagnosis is 15-25 months. At the time of diagnosis, 61% of patients have local regional lymph node metastases, and 21% have distant metastases. The lungs are a common site for metastasis for all tumors including melanoma. However endobronchial metastasis is a rare phenomenon. Endotracheal metastases are even rarer, occurring in only 5% of patients with extrapulmonary endobronchial metastases. It is most commonly seen in breast, colorectal, and kidney cancers. It is extremely rare for cutaneous melanoma. The mean survival after diagnosis is only 15 months and treatment options are limited.;We report the case of a 64 year-old gentleman with newly diagnosed metastatic anorectal melanoma. A 3 cm by 3 cm bluish-black, oval-shaped, exophytic mass protruding from his anus was found on physical exam. Endobronchial and endotracheal metastasis to the trachea were discovered on computed tomography and he was subsequently taken to the operating room for argon plasma coagulation laser recanalization of his trachea via rigid bronchoscopy, and resection of his anal mass.;We have presented the first known case of anorectal melanoma with endobronchial metastasis. Palliative APC laser recanalization was used to prevent asphyxiation from the endotracheal mass. Endobronchial metastasis is uncommon and can be easily mistaken for primary bronchogenic carcinoma. It should always be considered when evaluating patients with new lung masses.",
