        "Doc_abstract":"Molecular genetic aberrations and the related phenotypes were investigated in 191 papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) from patients exposed at young age to radioiodine released from the Chernobyl reactor. A high prevalence of RET gene rearrangements (62.3%) with a significant predominance of ELE1/RET (PTC3) over H4/RET (PTC1) rearrangements was found in PTCs of the first post-Chernobyl decade. NTRK1 rearrangements were rare (3.3%). In 3.3%, we observed novel types of RET rearrangements: GOLGA5/ RET (PTC5), HTIF/RET (PTC6), RFG7/RET (PTC7), and an as yet undefined RFGX/RET.RET rearrangements, preferentially ELE1/RET, are related to rapid tumor development. At longer intervals after exposure to ionizing radiation, the prevalence of RET rearrangements declines with a shift from ELE1/RET to H4/RET, most significantly in female patients. The prevalence of specific types of rearrangements is independent of age at irradiation. A significantly higher prevalence of ELE1/RET was observed in the most heavily contaminated Oblasts, Gomel and Brest, suggesting a preferential formation of this type of rearrangement after high thyroid doses. RET rearrangement is related to aggressive growth: Rearrangement-positive PTCs were in a more advanced pT category and more frequently in the pN1 category at presentation than rearrangement-negative PTCs. ELE1/RET is related to the solid variant of PTC, H4/RET more frequently to typical papillary structures. The genotype/phenotype evaluation of post-Chernobyl PTCs reveals a characteristic spectrum of gene rearrangements that lead to typical phenotypes with important biological and clinical implications.",

We report a case of synchronous MTC and PTC in a patient with germline RET mutation, and investigate the molecular pathogenesis of these two tumors. A 48-year-old man presented with cervical lymphadenopathy and was found to have metastatic MTC involving cervical and mediastinal lymph nodes. He underwent thyroidectomy and debulking of metastatic disease. The resected thyroid showed bilateral MTC and a 1-cm PTC. His lymph node metastases were predominantly MTC along with a small focus of metastatic PTC. Molecular testing using peripheral blood revealed a germline RET point mutation (Val804Met). Both tumors were analyzed for the BRAF (Val600Glu) mutation and the RET/PTC1 translocation. The PTC was positive for the BRAF mutation but negative for RET/PTC1. The MTC was negative for both abnormalities. We conclude that the MTC was caused by the germline RET mutation, while the PTC was caused by a somatic BRAF mutation.

Indeed, about 40% of PTCs harbor mutations in BRAF gene, whereas RET rearrangements (RET/PTC oncogenes) are present in about 20% of cases. Finally, RAS mutations and TRK rearrangements account for about 5% each of these malignancies. We used RNA-Sequencing to identify fusion transcripts and mutations in cancer driver genes in a cohort of 18 PTC patients. Furthermore, we used targeted DNA sequencing to validate identified mutations. We extended the screening to 50 PTC patients and 30 healthy individuals. Using this approach we identified new missense mutations in CBL, NOTCH1, PIK3R4 and SMARCA4 genes. We found somatic mutations in DICER1, MET and VHL genes, previously found mutated in other tumors, but not described in PTC. We identified a new chimeric transcript generated by the fusion of WNK1 and B4GALNT3 genes, correlated with B4GALNT3 overexpression. Our data confirmed PTC genetic heterogeneity, revealing that gene expression correlates more with the mutation pattern than with tumor staging. Overall, this study provides new data about mutational landscape of this neoplasia, suggesting potential pharmacological adjuvant therapies against Notch signaling and chromatin remodeling enzymes.

Serum calcitonin (CT) was determined preoperatively in all patients using polyclonal antibodies. Among the subjects, 25 patients showed elevated serum calcitonin levels preoperatively. Pathological diagnoses of 18 patients were confirmed as medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) postoperatively. Eight patients were diagnosed as papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) in the final pathological diagnosis without evidence of minimal foci of MTC or C cell hyperplasia, and they showed elevated CT levels preoperatively. Hypercalcitoninemia in 8 patients with PTC continued through out the 24 follow-up months with normal CEA levels. Extrathyroidal CT-producing diseases were all neglected, and precise pathological examination showed negative evidence of minute MTC or C cell hyperplasia in these 8 patients. Serum CT levels were simultaneously determined by a different CT assay kit using the same blood samples in 7 of 8 patients. Serum CT levels were all within normal values in another CT kit applying a different polyclonal antibody, although elevated CT values continued in the routine CT kit. The recognition of polymeric or fragmented CT by polyclonal antibody was thought to be the causative factor for the hypercalcitoninemia after total thyroidectomy in the patients with PTC.

Approximately 40 percent of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) typically have either intrachromosomal or extrachromosomal rearrangements that join the promoter and NH(2)-terminal domains of unrelated genes to the COOH-terminal fragment of RET. The RET point mutations associated with MEN2A, MEN2B, or FMTC, or the chromosomal breakpoints and translocations associated with PTC, typically activate the RET receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). RET kinase inhibitors are likely to be beneficial for patients with hereditary MTC, where currently there is no effective chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Recently, the low molecular weight tyrosine kinase inhibitor ZD6474 was found to block the enzymatic activity of RET-derived oncoproteins in cultured cell lines. We have developed a Drosophila model for MEN2A and MEN2B diseases by targeting oncogenic forms of RET to the developing Drosophila eye. Here we show that, when fed orally, ZD6474 suppressed RET-mediated phenotypes within the context of this in vivo model. Importantly, ZD6474 showed high efficacy and very low toxicity. This compound failed to significantly suppress an activated form of another RTK, the Drosophila epidermal growth factor receptor, nor did it suppress the activity of downstream components of the RET/Ras pathway. Our results support the view that targeting chemical kinase inhibitors such as ZD6474 to tissues with oncogenic forms of RET is a useful treatment strategy for RET-dependent carcinomas.",

BRAF V600E mutation analysis was performed by mutation-specific PCR using the same cell material; a hybrid-specific RT-PCR assay was used for detection of RET/PTC1 rearrangements.

Cytology classified eight FNABs as benign, while postoperative histology demonstrated a thyroid malignancy (6 PTCs, 1 FTC, 1 metastasis). In four of these eight cases, the genetic analysis detected a BRAF V600E mutation or a RET/PTC1 rearrangement. Classifying both suspicious and malignant FNAB results as positive cytology results, supplementary genetic testing increased the overall sensitivity of FNAB from 70.4 to 85.7%, the positive predictive value (PPV) from 59.4 to 64.9%, and the negative predictive value (NPV) from 84.0 to 91.3%.;Supplementary mutation analysis of RET and especially of the BRAF V600E mutation in FNABs is a fast and probably cost-effective assay in routine diagnostic setting.

Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) may have a very benign course while undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma (UTC) belongs to the most aggressive human malignancies. A variety of genes have been identified to be involved in the pathogenesis of thyroid carcinoma. Somatic Ras mutations seem to be an early event and are frequently found in follicular thyroid carcinomas. Somatic rearrangements of RET and TRK are almost exclusively found in PTC and may be found in early stages. Germline RET missense mutations lead to hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). In contrast, the significance of somatic RET mutations in sporadic MTC is unknown. p53 seems to play a crucial role in the dedifferentiation process of thyroid carcinoma. The precise role of PTEN remains to be elucidated. The only clearly identified exogenous factor that may lead to thyroid carcinoma (mainly PTC) is radiation. Of interest, radiation is capable to induce RET rearrangements. In general, early diagnosis is mandatory to enable the chance of cure. Surgery is the treatment of choice. Depending on the tumour type, surgery in combination with either radioiodine, external radiation or chemotherapy often enables the control of local tumour burden. In MTC and UTC, once thyroid cancer is spread to distant organs, efficacious therapeutic agents are almost non-existing. However, our growing knowledge of genes involved in thyroidal oncogenesis may contribute to the development of more effective treatment modalities.

Effects on cell proliferation and RET and ERK expression and activation were determined.;XL184 and vandetanib most effectively inhibited cell proliferation, RET autophosphorylation in combination with a reduction of RET expression, and ERK phosphorylation in MTC-TT and MZ-CRC-1, respectively. TPC-1 cells showed a decrease in RET autophosphorylation after treatment with XL184, but no effect was observed on ERK activation.;There is indeed specificity for different RET mutations, with XL184 being the most potent inhibitor in MEN2A and PTC and vandetanib the most effective in MEN2B in vitro.

However, HT occurring in association with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is rarely documented. We report here an interesting case. A 34-year-old female with a solitary thyroid nodule underwent fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) that was interpreted as \"MTC with admixed reactive lymphoid cells, derived possibly from a pretracheal lymph node.\" Total thyroidectomy specimen showed \"MTC with coexisting HT.\" At a later stage, a follow-up FNAC from the recurrent thyroid swelling showed features consistent with HT. As an academic exercise, the initial smears on which a diagnosis of MTC was offered were reviewed to look for evidence of coexisting HT that showed scanty and patchy aggregates of reactive lymphoid cells without Hürthle cells. Our case highlights an unusual instance of MTC in concurrence with HT that can create a tricky situation for cytopathologists. ",

Complete total thyroidectomy is the treatment of choice for PTC, FTC, and MTC. Radioiodine is routinely recommended in high-risk patients and considered in intermediate risk DTC patients. DTC cancer cells, during tumor progression, may lose the iodide uptake ability, becoming resistant to radioiodine, with a significant worsening of the prognosis. The lack of specific and effective drugs for aggressive and metastatic DTC and MTC leads to additional efforts toward the development of new drugs. Several genetic alterations in different molecular pathways in TC have been shown in the past few decades, associated with TC development and progression. Rearranged during transfection (RET)/PTC gene rearrangements, RET mutations, BRAF mutations, RAS mutations, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 angiogenesis pathways are some of the known pathways determinant in the development of TC. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are small organic compounds inhibiting tyrosine kinases auto-phosphorylation and activation, most of them are multikinase inhibitors. TKIs act on the aforementioned molecular pathways involved in growth, angiogenesis, local, and distant spread of TC. TKIs are emerging as new therapies of aggressive TC, including DTC, MTC, and anaplastic thyroid cancer, being capable of inducing clinical responses and stabilization of disease. Vandetanib and cabozantinib have been approved for the treatment of MTC, while sorafenib and lenvatinib for DTC refractory to radioiodine. These drugs prolong median progression-free survival, but until now no significant increase has been observed on overall survival; side effects are common. New efforts are made to find new more effective and safe compounds and to personalize the therapy in each TC patient. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"In recent years, significant progress has been made in elucidating the genetic bases promoting tumorigenesis in various human neoplasms. Constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is a major event in the carcinogenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), the most prevalent endocrine malignancy. Affected elements include RET/PTC rearrangements and point mutations of the Ras and BRAF genes. Mutations in these genes are found in over 70% of PTC. Chromosomal RET rearrangements, called RET/PTC, result in constitutive ligand-independent activation of RET kinase, which was the first genetic anomaly detected in PTC and is found in 5-70% of tumoral samples. Although less frequent, the activation of other tyrosine kinase receptors, such as NTRK1, c-Met or EGFR, has also been reported in PTC. The BRAF mutation represents the most common genetic alteration found in PTC. More than 90% of BRAF mutations lead to a change of a valine to a glutamic acid at position 600 (V600E). Finally, Ras is the least affected molecule in the pathway. A relationship between clinical behavior and these genetic alterations has been proposed. Thus, the BRAF mutation is associated with a more aggressive PTC phenotype and is correlated with poorer outcomes. However, no clear association has been found between RET/PTC and clinical features. The discovery of these alterations opens the way to new therapeutic strategies, especially to treat those patients in whom conventional therapy is not effective. Several new drugs are being tested, such as small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Some of these recently developed agents have begun to be used with promising results.",

However, most of the patients did not receive ablation with radioactive iodine. Therefore, whether the Tg in these patients was derived from persistent disease or residual thyroid tissue could not be concluded. To resolve this question, we measured serum Tg levels in patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) who underwent total thyroidectomy using similar surgical techniques for the treatment of PTC.;Twenty-seven consecutive patients with MTC who underwent total thyroidectomy were selected. Of them, five patients with antibodies to Tg were excluded from the study. In the remaining 22 patients, serum Tg levels were measured before and after surgery. None of the patients received radioactive iodine ablation. They were prescribed levothyroxine as a replacement for the lost thyroid function.;Serum Tg levels were detectable preoperatively, while postoperative serum Tg levels were lower than the detectable level, 0.5 ng/mL, in all 22 patients.;The results indicate that most of the patients with detectable Tg levels and negative Tg-DT values after total thyroidectomy for PTC in our previous study had persistent disease, and that their serum Tg was not from residual thyroid tissue, suggesting that up to 50% of patients with persistent PTC have a decrease in serum Tg levels in response to thyroid-stimulating hormone-suppressive therapy.",

As part of a cell-surface complex, RET binds glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) ligands in conjunction with GDNF-family alpha co-receptors (GFRalpha). Ligand-induced activation induces dimerization and tyrosine phosphorylation of the RET receptor with downstream activation of several signal transduction pathways. Activating germline RET mutations play a central role in the development of the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes MEN2A, MEN2B, and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) and also in the development of the congenital abnormality Hirschsprung's disease. Approximately 50% of patients with sporadic MTC have somatic RET mutations, and a significant portion of papillary thyroid carcinomas result from chromosomal inversions or translocations, which activate RET (RET/PTC oncogenes). The RET protooncogene has a significant place in cancer prevention and treatment. Timely thyroidectomy in kindred members who have inherited a mutated RET allele, characteristic of MEN2A, MEN2B, or FMTC, can prevent MTC, the most common cause of death in these syndromes.

We describe three cases of primary MASC of the thyroid gland and provide a detailed clinical and pathological characterization of the tumor morphology, immunoprofile, and genetic background. Immunohistochemistry for PAX8, TTF-1, thyroglobulin, mammaglobin, GCDFP-15, S-100 protein, and p63 was used to define the tumor immunophenotype. Fluorescence in situ hybridization for ETV6 rearrangement was performed in three, and the next-generation sequencing assay MSK-IMPACT™ (Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets) was performed in two cases. Primary MASC of the thyroid occurred in two women and one man, age 47-72 years. All patients presented with high T stage, infiltrative, locally aggressive tumors with extrathyroidal extension. Two cases were associated with well-differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma. Histologically, they appeared as low-grade tumors, resembling MASC of the salivary glands and labeled positive for mammaglobin, GCDFP-15, S-100 protein, p63, weakly positive for PAX8, and negative for TTF-1 and thyroglobulin. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed ETV6 rearrangement in all cases. In two tested cases MSK-IMPACT™ confirmed the presence of ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusion. Two patients had at least two local recurrences, one was alive with disease, and one was alive and free of disease after 14 and 17 years, respectively. The third patient was alive and free of disease after 2 years. MASC of the thyroid is histologically, immunophenotypically, and genetically similar to its salivary gland counterpart. Thyroid MASC can be associated with a well-differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma component, supporting follicular cell origin. Clinically, these carcinomas may show frequent recurrences but are associated with long-term survival. Patients with MASC of the thyroid may potentially benefit from Trk molecular-targeted therapy.

Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) with the two subtypes, papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and follicular thyroid cancer (FTC), is the most frequent subtype of thyroid cancer; more rare subtypes are medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC). The incidence of DTC has increased rapidly in recent years due to the more frequent use of imaging methods such as ultrasound of the neck and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of thyroid nodules. After total thyroidectomy and radioiodine treatment, DTC remains an indolent and curable disease in most patients, whereas the cure rate in MTC is lower and depends on early diagnosis. Most ATCs are incurable. In recent years, there has been great progress in identifying genetic changes in thyroid cancer, and genetic testing of FNA samples or blood samples provides useful information for clinical decision making. Tumor staging, either postoperatively or by imaging, and measuring the tumor markers thyroglobulin for DTC and calcitonin for MTC, allow for dynamic risk-adapted stratification for follow-up procedures. In advanced metastatic thyroid cancer, molecular targeted therapy using tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors, including sorafenib, lenvantinib, vandetanib, and cabozantinib, helps control tumor progression and prolongs progression-free survival. Using a dynamic risk-stratified approach to manage thyroid cancer, the outcomes for most thyroid cancer patients are excellent compared with those for other cancers. The major challenge in the future is to identify high-risk patients and to treat and monitor them appropriately.

In nine thyroid cancer cell lines, the RASSF1A promoter CpG island was methylated completely, and expression was absent. Treatment of these cell lines with the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine reactivated the transcription of RASSF1A. The methylation status of the RASSF1A promoter was analyzed in 38 primary thyroid tumors, including 1 poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma, 5 medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), 10 follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC), 9 undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma (UTC), and 13 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). In 71% of thyroid carcinomas, the RASSF1A CpG island was hypermethylated. Methylation frequency was higher in the aggressive forms of thyroid carcinoma and was found in 80% of MTC, in 78% of UTC, and in 70% of FTC, compared with 62% in the more benign PTC. RASSF1A inactivation was detected in all stages of thyroid carcinoma scored by Tumor-Node-Metastasis classification. Additionally, we analyzed the methylation frequency of the CpG island of cell cycle inhibitor p16(INK4a) in the same thyroid tumors. The p16 gene was inactivated in 56 and 25% of cell lines and primary tumors, respectively. p16 methylation was detected in 56% of UTC, 10% of FTC, and 25% of PTC but not in MTC. In UTC, which belongs to the most aggressive carcinomas in humans, the most common combined inactivation of RASSF1A and p16 was detected. In general, 90% of tumors with p16 inactivation were also silenced for RASSF1A expression. However, RASSF1A hypermethylation was detected three times more frequently in thyroid cancers. Thus, RASSF1A inactivation may play a crucial role in the malignancy of thyroid carcinoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The histology and clinical behavior of thyroid cancer are highly diverse. Although most are indolent tumors with a very favorable outcome with the current standard of care therapy, a small subset of tumors may be among the most lethal malignancies known to man. While surgery and radioactive iodine are the standard of care for differentiated thyroid cancers (DTC) and are effective in curing a majority of such patients, those with iodine-resistant cancers pose a great challenge for clinicians, as these patients have limited treatment options and poor prognoses. Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) has no effective systemic therapy despite the genetic and signaling defects that have been well characterized for the last two decades. Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is one of the most aggressive solid tumors that remains fatal despite conventional multimodality therapy. Increased understanding of the pathogenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma, the most common type of DTC, as well as ATC, has led to the development of targeted therapies aimed at signaling pathways and angiogenesis that are critical to the development and/or progression of such tumors. Development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting known pathogenetic defects in MTC has led to testing of such agents in the clinic. Numerous clinical trials have been conducted over the last 5 years to examine the effects of these targeted molecular therapies on the outcomes of patients with iodine-refractory DTC, MTC and ATC. Conduction of such trials in the last few years represents a major breakthrough in the field of thyroid cancer. Several trials testing targeted therapies offer promise for setting new standards for the future of patients with progressive thyroid cancer. The purpose of this paper is to outline the recent advances in understanding of the pathogenesis of thyroid cancer and to summarize the results of the clinical trials with these targeted therapies.",

Clinical biological characteristic of the histological variants was investigated. Sixty cases of PTC were selected. As the important parts of micro ecosystems, ECM, MMPs, CAMs and cytokine were investigated in use of tissue chip and method of immunohistochemistry. In addition, a group of cases of thyroid carcinoma including PTC was analyzed, follicular thyroid carcinoma and medulla thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and their reports of PET-CT as the initiation.;The variants could be divided into three groups in terms of the rate of cervical lymph node metastasis. The high-metastases group included diffuse sclerosing variant, tall cell variant, column cell variant and diffuse follicular variant. The low-metastases group included macrofollicular variant and papillary microcarcinomas. Others are included in the moderate-metastases group. The rate of cervical lymph node metastasis of each group were 83.0% , 55.5% and 34.1% (P < 0. 05), respectively. The 10-year-survival were 75.3% , 95.8% and 100.0% , respectively.

The positive rate of LN, FN, MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-2, CD, Integrinbeta-1, ICAM-1, EGFR, TGFR-beta, VEGF-C and E-Cad in metastasis ranged from 51.6% (Integrinbeta-1) to 98.3% (CD), and that in primartumor ranged from 46.7% (FN) to 98.3% (ICAM-1). The expression of E-cad in primartumor was lower than that in normal tissues (P < 0.05). The sensitivity of PET-CT was 100% and the specificity was 85.7%.;The characteristic has significant difference among the variants. Individual treatment should be performed in terms of different variants. Furthermore, some molecules play an important role in the lymph node metastasis of PTC and may be considered as the focus of future study.

Familial non-medullary thyroid cancer (FNMTC) comprises about 5-15% of NMTC and is a heterogeneous group of diseases, including both non-syndromic and syndromic forms. Non-syndromic FNMTC tends to manifest papillary thyroid carcinoma , usually multifocal and bilateral . Several high-penetrance genes for FNMTC have been identified, but they are often confined to a few or single families, and other susceptibility loci appear to play a small part, conferring only small increments in risk. Familial susceptibility is likely to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental influences. The current focus of research in FNMTC is to characterise the susceptibility genes and their role in carcinogenesis. FNMTC can also occur as a part of multitumour genetic syndromes such as familial adenomatous polyposis , Cowden's disease , Werner's syndrome and Carney complex . These tend to present at an early age and are multicentric and bilateral with distinct pathology. The clinical evaluation of these patients is similar to that for most patients with a thyroid nodule. Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) arises from the parafollicular cells of the thyroid which release calcitonin. The familial form of MTC accounts for 20-25% of cases and presents as a part of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) syndromes or as a pure familial MTC (FMTC). They are caused by germline point mutations in the RET oncogene on chromosome 10q11.2. There is a clear genotype-phenotype correlation, and the aggressiveness of FMTC depends on the specific genetic mutation, which should determine the timing of surgery.",

In these cancers, RET activates the ERK/MAPK, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and the JAK/STAT3 pathways. Here, we tested the efficacy of a JAK1/2- inhibitor, AZD1480, in the in vitro and in vivo growth of thyroid cancer cell lines expressing oncogenic RET. Thyroid cancer cell lines harboring RET/PTC1 (TPC-1), RET M918T (MZ-CRC1) and RET C634W (TT) alterations, as well as TPC-1 xenografts, were treated with JAK inhibitor, AZD1480. This inhibitor led to growth inhibition and/or apoptosis of the thyroid cancer cell lines in vitro, as well as to tumor regression of TPC-1 xenografts, where it efficiently blocked STAT3 activation in tumor and stromal cells. This inhibition was associated with decreased proliferation, decreased blood vessel density, coupled with increased necrosis. However, AZD1480 repressed the growth of STAT3- deficient TPC-1 cells in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating that its effects in this cell line were independent of STAT3 in the tumor cells. In all cell lines, the JAK inhibitor reduced phospho-Y1062 RET levels, and mTOR effector phospho-S6, while JAK1/2 downregulation by siRNA did not affect cell growth nor RET and S6 activation. In conclusion, AZD1480 effectively blocks proliferation and tumor growth of activated RET- thyroid cancer cell lines, likely through direct RET inhibition in cancer cells as well as by modulation of the microenvironment (e.g. via JAK/phospho-STAT3 inhibition in endothelial cells). Thus, AZD1480 should be considered as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of RET- activated thyroid cancers.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Since medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) was first recognized as a distinct tumor in 1959, it became clear that MTC is more difficult to cure than papillary thyroid cancer and has higher rates of recurrence and mortality. MTC represents 5-8% of thyroid cancers. It derives from parafollicular cells of the ultimobranchial body derived from the neural crest. MTC secretes calcitonin and other hormonal peptides and is considered part of the amine precursor uptake and decarboxilation system. MTC may occur either as a hereditary or nonhereditary entity. Hereditary MTC can occur either alone as the familial MTC or as the thyroid manifestation of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2 syndromes (MEN 2A MEN 2B). Activating point mutations of the RET proto-oncogene have demonstrated to be causative of the familial form of medullary thyroid cancer, both isolated familial MTC and associated with MEN 2A and 2B. In the last 10 years, major improvements and new technologies have been proposed and applied in thyroid surgery; among these are molecular diagnosis with genetic screening and mini-invasive video-assisted thyroidectomy. The history of thyroid surgery starts with Billroth, Kocher and Halsted, who developed the technique for thyroidectomy between 1873 and 1910. Prophylactic surgery for patients carrying a positive RET proto-oncogene has proven to be highly effective in curing those likely to experience the development of MTC. Video-assisted procedures with central compartment dissection have proved feasible for patients carrying a positive RET proto-oncogene. This paper reviews relevant medical literature published in the English language on surgery of MTC in well-controlled trials. We discuss the particular ethical and legal issues that thyroid prophylactic surgery raises. Searches were last updated in February 2007.",

Three cases of MTC, Hürthle cell adenoma and papillary thyroid cancer are reported with preoperative scintigraphy, T/B ratios and Northern analyses of the surgical biopsies. Visualization of tumors was possible in the absence of sstr2 (the high affinity receptor for octreotide) with the exception of microscopic tumor growth. T/B values in the patient with Hürthle cell adenoma were similar to those found in the contralateral thyroid lobe with goitre. The relatively high uptake of 111In in benign thyroid conditions probably limits the use of octreotide scintigraphy in the diagnosis of primary tumors. The technique has certain advantages over radioiodine scintigraphy after the surgical treatment of thyroid tumors: no need for withdrawal of thyroxin substitution; a possibility to diagnose metastases of tumors that do not concentrate radioiodine (MTC, Hürthle cell cancer); and complementary information about metastatic sites of non-medullary thyroid cancer (papillary and follicular tumors).",

Knowledge of these features is the basis of the surgical concept of one or two-stage thyroidectomy, the exceptions and the concept of locoregional lymph node dissection. Lymph node surgery plays an important role in those cancers exhibiting mainly lymph node metastases (PTC, MTC) not only due to frequent recurrences but also due to its potential curative intent. Differentiated carcinomas may have an acceptable prognosis despite local invasion of the cervical aerodigestive system, thus resections are justified when technical prerequisites are given.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The RET kinase has emerged as a promising target for the therapy of medullary thyroid cancers (MTC) and of a subset of papillary thyroid cancers. NVP-AST487, a N,N'-diphenyl urea with an IC(50) of 0.88 mumol/L on RET kinase, inhibited RET autophosphorylation and activation of downstream effectors, and potently inhibited the growth of human thyroid cancer cell lines with activating mutations of RET but not of lines without RET mutations. NVP-AST487 induced a dose-dependent growth inhibition of xenografts of NIH3T3 cells expressing oncogenic RET, and of the MTC cell line TT in nude mice. MTCs secrete calcitonin, a useful indicator of tumor burden. Human plasma calcitonin levels derived from the TT cell xenografts were inhibited shortly after treatment, when tumor volume was still unchanged, indicating that the effects of RET kinase inhibition on calcitonin secretion were temporally dissociated from its tumor-inhibitory properties. Accordingly, NVP-AST487 inhibited calcitonin gene expression in vitro in TT cells, in part, through decreased gene transcription. These data point to a previously unknown physiologic role of RET signaling on calcitonin gene expression. Indeed, the RET ligands persephin and GDNF robustly stimulated calcitonin mRNA, which was blocked by pretreatment with NVP-AST487. Antagonists of RET kinase activity in patients with MTC may result in effects on plasma calcitonin that are either disproportionate or dissociated from the effects on tumor burden, because RET kinase mediates a physiologic pathway controlling calcitonin secretion. The role of traditional tumor biomarkers may need to be reassessed as targeted therapies designed against oncoproteins with key roles in pathogenesis are implemented.",

        "Doc_abstract":"OBJECTIVE Postoperative shoulder imbalance (PSI) is a critical consideration after corrective surgery for a double thoracic curve (Lenke Type 2); however, the radiographic factors related to PSI remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to identify the radiographic factors related to PSI after corrective surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) in patients with a double thoracic curve. METHODS This study included 80 patients with Lenke Type 2 AIS who underwent corrective surgery. Patients were grouped according to the presence [PSI(+)] or absence [PSI(-)] of shoulder imbalance at the final follow-up examination (differences of 20, 15, and 10 mm were used). Various radiographic parameters, including the Cobb angle of the proximal and middle thoracic curves (PTC and MTC), radiographic shoulder height (RSH), clavicle angle, T-1 tilt, trunk shift, and proximal and distal wedge angles (PWA and DWA), were assessed before and after surgery and compared between groups. RESULTS Overall, postoperative RSH decreased with time in the PSI(-) group but not in the PSI(+) group. Statistical analyses revealed that the preoperative Risser grade (p = 0.048), postoperative PWA (p = 0.028), and postoperative PTC/MTC ratio (p = 0.011) correlated with PSI. Presence of the adding-on phenomenon was also correlated with PSI, although this result was not statistically significant (p = 0.089). CONCLUSIONS Postoperative shoulder imbalance is common after corrective surgery for Lenke Type 2 AIS and correlates with a higher Risser grade, a larger postoperative PWA, and a higher postoperative PTC/MTC ratio. Presence of the distal adding-on phenomenon is associated with an increased PSI trend, although this result was not statistically significant. However, preoperative factors other than the Risser grade that affect the development of PSI were not identified by the study. Additional studies are required to reveal the risk factors for the development of PSI.",

The influence, exerted by exogenous IGF-I on the expression of these genes, was also investigated.;Thyroid tissue specimens were obtained from 65 patients during subtotal or total thyroidectomies. After approximately 2-3 weeks of culture, thyroid cells were incubated for 24 hours with IGF-I in concentrations of: 0, 1, 10 and 100 ng/ml. The total mRNA was isolated according to the method described by Chomczyński and Sacchi with our own modifications. Afterwards, mRNA encoding IGF-I, IGFBP-1-IGFBP-4 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), were amplified, using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); GAPDH gene served as a control gene. PCR products were electrophoresed and then submitted to densitometric analysis.;Our study has shown that in carcinoma cells (ATC, PTC, MTC), IGF-I reveals a stimulatory influence on the expression of its own gene, that effect being most distinctive in ATC cells.

        "Doc_abstract":"The study of thyroid tumor genetics has great relevance to surgeons and facilitates understanding tumor pathogenesis, prediction of tumor behavior, and management decisions. The genes implicated can be broadly categorized as oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes. The RET oncogene has well established roles in the development of both papillary (PTC) and medullary (MTC) thyroid carcinoma. Genetic screening for germline RET mutations in members of multiple endocrine neoplasia type II (MEN-II) families is now widely performed, and prophylactic thyroidectomy in gene carriers is advisable at an early age. Patients with apparently sporadic MTC can also be screened to rule out familial disease. The demonstration of a RET rearrangement in a patient's PTC may have prognostic significance, but as yet there are no management implications. The thyrotropin receptor (TSH-R) and Gsalpha become oncogenic through point mutation and are associated with the development of toxic thyroid adenomas. The ras oncogene is implicated in the early stages of development of several thyroid tumor types. Tumor-suppressor genes also have a role in thyroid tumor formation. The p53 gene appears to be involved in the process of transformation to the anaplastic phenotype and the PTEN gene in the development of follicular adenomas but not carcinomas. There is still limited evidence for the so called adenoma-carcinoma sequence of the thyroid follicular cell. Loss of heterozygosity studies have enabled identification of tumor-suppressor genes, and their findings suggests differences in the pathogenesis of PTCs compared with follicular cancers. Surgical decision-making will benefit from these basic molecular advances, which rapidly translates into improved patient management.",
