        "Doc_abstract":"Cancers of origin in the gallbladder and bile ducts are rarely curable with current modalities of cancer treatment. Our clinical application of broad-based mutational profiling for patients diagnosed with a gastrointestinal malignancy has led to the novel discovery of mutations in the gene encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) in tumors from a subset of patients with cholangiocarcinoma. A total of 287 tumors from gastrointestinal cancer patients (biliary tract, colorectal, gastroesophageal, liver, pancreatic, and small intestine carcinoma) were tested during routine clinical evaluation for 130 site-specific mutations within 15 cancer genes. Mutations were identified within a number of genes, including KRAS (35%), TP53 (22%), PIK3CA (10%), BRAF (7%), APC (6%), NRAS (3%), AKT1 (1%), CTNNB1 (1%), and PTEN (1%). Although mutations in the metabolic enzyme IDH1 were rare in the other common gastrointestinal malignancies in this series (2%), they were found in three tumors (25%) of an initial series of 12 biliary tract carcinomas. To better define IDH1 and IDH2 mutational status, an additional 75 gallbladder and bile duct cancers were examined. Combining these cohorts of biliary cancers, mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 were found only in cholangiocarcinomas of intrahepatic origin (nine of 40, 23%) and in none of the 22 extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas and none of the 25 gallbladder carcinomas. In an analysis of frozen tissue specimens, IDH1 mutation was associated with highly elevated tissue levels of the enzymatic product 2-hydroxyglutarate. Thus, IDH1 mutation is a molecular feature of cholangiocarcinomas of intrahepatic origin. These findings define a specific metabolic abnormality in this largely incurable type of gastrointestinal cancer and present a potentially new target for therapy.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is an aggressive malignancy with very poor prognosis. Genome-wide, high-throughput technologies have made major advances in understanding the molecular basis of this disease, although important mechanisms are still unclear. Recent data have revealed specific genetic mutations (for example, KRAS, IDH1 and IDH2), epigenetic silencing, aberrant signaling pathway activation (for example, interleukin (IL)-6/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), tyrosine kinase receptor-related pathways) and molecular subclasses with unique alterations (for example, proliferation and inflammation subclasses). In addition, some ICCs share common genomic traits with hepatocellular carcinoma. All this information provides the basis to explore novel targeted therapies. Currently, surgery at early stage is the only effective therapy. At more advanced stages, chemotherapy regimens are emerging (that is, cisplatin plus gemcitabine), along with molecular targeted agents tested in several ongoing clinical trials. Nonetheless, a first-line conclusive treatment remains an unmet need. Similarly, there are no studies assessing tumor response related with genetic alterations. This review explores the recent advancements in the knowledge of the molecular alterations underlying ICC and the future prospects in terms of therapeutic strategies leading towards a more personalized treatment of this neoplasm.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is one of the representative cancers refractory to any therapeutic approach. The incidence of CCA is highest in the northeastern part of Thailand, where chronic inflammation caused by liver fluke (Opisthorchis viverrini: Ov) infection is a major etiologic factor. The incidence of CCA is also increasing in other countries, including Japan. Here, we overview the genetic and transcriptional alterations of CCA with and without association with Ov infection. CCA with Ov shows enhanced expression of the genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism and chronic inflammatory responses, including cytokine signaling, whereas CCA without Ov shows enhanced expression of growth factor signaling, such as HER2. Exome and the following prevalence sequencing identified mutations of the BAP1, ARID1A, IDH1 and IDH2 genes in CCA, in addition to the high incidence of known mutations in the TP53, KRAS2 SMAD4, and CDKN2A genes, suggesting the role of chromatin modulators in CCA pathogenesis. CCA with Ov shows significantly higher incidence of the TP53 gene mutation, whereas CCA without Ov showed significantly more frequent mutations of the BAP1, IDH1 and IDH2 genes. However, CCAs with Ov and without Ov share a similar mutation spectrum dominated by C : G > T : A transitions mainly at CpG dinucleotides, suggesting that CCA shares etiologic factors with pancreatic ductal carcinoma but not with hepatocellular carcinoma. Comprehensive analyses of the genetic and transcriptional alterations of CCA with and without Ov infection would provide useful information for the prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment of CCA.

Currently, there are no curative medical therapies for CCA. Recent advances have enhanced our understanding of the genetic basis of this disease, and elucidated therapeutically relevant targets. Therapeutic efforts in development are directed at several key pathways due to genetic aberrations including receptor tyrosine kinase pathways, mutant IDH enzymes, the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, and chromatin remodeling networks. A highly desmoplastic, hypovascular stroma is characteristic of CCAs and recent work has highlighted the importance of targeting this pathway via stromal myofibroblast depletion. Future efforts should concentrate on combination therapies with action against the cancer cell and the surrounding tumor stroma. As the mutational landscape of CCA is being illuminated, molecular profiling of patient tumors will enable identification of specific mutations and the opportunity to offer directed, personalized treatment options.

        "Doc_abstract":"Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is an aggressive cancer associated with the bile ducts within the liver. These tumors are characterized by frequent gain-of-function mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2) genes-that are also common in subsets of neural, haematopoietic and bone tumors, but rare or absent in the other types of gastrointestinal malignancy. Mutant IDH acts through a novel mechanism of oncogenesis, producing high levels of the metabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, which interferes with the function of α-ketoglutarate-dependent enzymes that regulate diverse cellular processes including histone demethylation and DNA modification. Recently, we used in vitro stem cell systems and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) to demonstrate that mutant IDH promotes ICC formation by blocking hepatocyte differentiation and increasing pools of hepatic progenitors that are susceptible to additional oncogenic hits leading to ICC. We found that silencing of HNF4A-encoding a master transcriptional regulator of hepatocyte identity and quiescence-was critical to mutant IDH-mediated inhibition of liver differentiation. In line with these findings, human ICC with IDH mutations are characterized by a hepatic progenitor cell transcriptional signature suggesting that they are a distinct ICC subtype as compared to IDH wild type tumors. The role of mutant IDH in controlling hepatic differentiation state suggests the potential of newly developed inhibitors of the mutant enzyme as a form of differentiation therapy in a solid tumor. ",

As the inhibition for those tumor-associated mutant IDH proteins may induce differentiation of those cancer cells, these tumor-associated mutant IDH proteins can be treated as a drug target proteins for a differentiation therapy against cancers. In this study, we aim to identify the potent TCM compounds from the TCM Database@Taiwan as lead compounds of IDH2 R140Q mutant inhibitor. Comparing to the IDH2 R140Q mutant protein inhibitor, AGI-6780, the top two TCM compounds, precatorine and abrine, have higher binding affinities with target protein in docking simulation. After MD simulation, the top two TCM compounds remain as the same docking poses under dynamic conditions. In addition, precatorine is extracted from Abrus precatorius L., which represents the cytotoxic and proapoptotic effects for breast cancer and several tumor lines. Hence, we propose the TCM compounds, precatorine and abrine, as potential candidates as lead compounds for further study in drug development process with the IDH2 R140Q mutant protein against cancer.

Clinical presentation is often late, precluding curative surgical resection in most cases. For advanced disease, therapeutic options are limited to systemic chemotherapy, with suboptimal outcomes. An understanding of the molecular characteristics of biliary tract cancers may allow the clinical development of therapies targeting actionable alterations with the ultimate goal of improving clinical outcomes. We present a comprehensive review of biliary tract cancer genomics and their clinical implications. Alterations in genes in the EGFR-MAPK-PI3K pathway are seen most often. KRAS alterations are highly prevalent; BRAF alterations are mutually exclusive from RAS alterations and much less frequent. PIK3CA alterations are seen mostly in extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancers whereas HER2 amplification is most common in gallbladder cancers. Various tumor suppressor genes, such as TP53 and p16 are also altered often in biliary tract cancers; however, agents to \"activate\" silenced genes are currently lacking. FGF and IDH pathway alterations are potential targets for therapeutic agents. FGF alterations are typically fusions with other genes, resulting in altered proteins, and are seen most often in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. IDH pathway alterations affect cellular enzymatic processes and are most common in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
