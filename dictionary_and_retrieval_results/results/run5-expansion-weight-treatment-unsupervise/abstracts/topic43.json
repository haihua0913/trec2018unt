The aim of this study was to compare the proteomic profile of cultured fibroblast and fibroblast conditioned culture media of PTCH1+ and nonmutated fibroblasts.;Proteomic analysis was performed using Surface-Enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight mass spectrometry in PTCH1+ fibroblast conditioned media isolated from not affected sun-protected skin areas of Gorlin patients and from healthy subjects. 12 protein cluster peaks, >5 kDa, had significant differences in their peak intensities between PTCH1+ and PTCH1- subject groups. We detected a strongly MMP1 overexpression in PTCH1+ fibroblasts obtained from NBCCS patients with respect to healthy donors.;Protein profiles in the fibroblast conditioned media revealed statistically significant differences between two different types (missense versus nonsense) of PTCH1 mutations. These differences could be useful as signatures to identify PTCH1 gene carriers at high risk for the development of NBCCS-associated malignancies and to develop novel experimental molecular tailored therapies based on these druggable targets.",

Mutations of the patched 1 gene (PTCH1) lead to basal cell carcinoma predisposition in Gorlin syndrome. PTCH1 is part of the hedgehog signalling pathway, and derangements within this pathway are now known to be important in the carcinogenesis of many different cancers including sporadic basal cell carcinoma. The molecular biology of the hedgehog pathway is discussed, and mouse models of basal cell carcinoma based on this pathway are explored. New developments in non-surgical treatment of basal cell carcinoma are based on this knowledge. Other genes of importance to basal cell carcinoma development include the tumour suppressor gene P53 and the melanocortin-1 receptor gene. In addition, we discuss molecules of possible importance such as the glutathione-S-transferases, DNA repair genes, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A, Brahma and connexins.

Factors in OTRs conferring increased susceptibility to BCC include ultraviolet radiation exposure, immunosuppression, viral infections such as human papillomavirus, phototype and genetic predisposition. The PTCH1 gene is a negative regulator of the hedgehog pathway, that provides mitogenic signals to basal cells in skin. PTCH1 gene mutations cause naevoid BCC syndrome, and contribute to the development of sporadic BCC and other types of cancers. Associations have been reported between PTCH1 polymorphisms and BCC susceptibility in nontransplanted individuals.;To search for novel common polymorphisms in the proximal 5' regulatory region upstream of PTCH1 gene exon 1B, and to investigate the possible association of PTCH1 polymorphisms and haplotypes with BCC risk after organ transplantation.;Three PTCH1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs2297086, rs2066836 and rs357564) were analysed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in 161 northern Italian OTRs (56 BCC cases and 105 controls). Two regions of the PTCH1 gene promoter were screened by heteroduplex analysis in 30 cases and 30 controls.;Single locus analysis showed no significant association. Haplotype T(1686)-T(3944) appeared to confer a significantly higher risk for BCC development (odds ratio 2.98, 95% confidence interval 2.55-3.48; P = 0.001). Two novel rare polymorphisms were identified at positions 176 and 179 of the 5'UTR. Two novel alleles of the -4 (CGG)(n) microsatellite were identified. No association of this microsatellite with BCC was observed.;Haplotypes containing T(1686)-T(3944) alleles were shown to be associated with an increased BCC risk in our study population. These data appear to be of great interest for further investigations in a larger group of transplant individuals. Our results do not support the hypothesis that common polymorphisms in the proximal 5' regulatory region of the PTCH1 gene could represent an important risk factor for BCC after organ transplantation.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS), also known as Gorlin syndrome, is a hereditary condition characterized by a wide range of developmental abnormalities and a predisposition to neoplasms. The estimated prevalence varies from 1/57,000 to 1/256,000, with a male-to-female ratio of 1:1. Main clinical manifestations include multiple basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), odontogenic keratocysts of the jaws, hyperkeratosis of palms and soles, skeletal abnormalities, intracranial ectopic calcifications, and facial dysmorphism (macrocephaly, cleft lip/palate and severe eye anomalies). Intellectual deficit is present in up to 5% of cases. BCCs (varying clinically from flesh-colored papules to ulcerating plaques and in diameter from 1 to 10 mm) are most commonly located on the face, back and chest. The number of BBCs varies from a few to several thousand. Recurrent jaw cysts occur in 90% of patients. Skeletal abnormalities (affecting the shape of the ribs, vertebral column bones, and the skull) are frequent. Ocular, genitourinary and cardiovascular disorders may occur. About 5-10% of NBCCS patients develop the brain malignancy medulloblastoma, which may be a potential cause of early death. NBCCS is caused by mutations in the PTCH1 gene and is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with complete penetrance and variable expressivity. Clinical diagnosis relies on specific criteria. Gene mutation analysis confirms the diagnosis. Genetic counseling is mandatory. Antenatal diagnosis is feasible by means of ultrasound scans and analysis of DNA extracted from fetal cells (obtained by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling). Main differential diagnoses include Bazex syndrome, trichoepithelioma papulosum multiplex and Torre's syndrome (Muir-Torre's syndrome). Management requires a multidisciplinary approach. Keratocysts are treated by surgical removal. Surgery for BBCs is indicated when the number of lesions is limited; other treatments include laser ablation, photodynamic therapy and topical chemotherapy. Radiotherapy should be avoided. Vitamin A analogs may play a preventive role against development of new BCCs. Life expectancy in NBCCS is not significantly altered but morbidity from complications can be substantial. Regular follow-up by a multi-specialist team (dermatologist, neurologist and odontologist) should be offered. Patients with NBCCS should strictly avoid an excessive sun exposure.",

Many of these mutations, including mutations in the C-terminus of the large intracellular loop (ICL) of ptch1 (p.C727VfsX745 and p.S733IfsX736), result in the premature truncation of the protein. The ptch1‑C727VfsX745 and ptch1-S733IfsX736 mutations have been identified in patients with NBCCS‑associated keratocystic odontogenic tumors (KCOTs). In the present study, we found that the molecular mechanisms regulated by the non-canonical Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway through cyclin B1 are involved in the pathogenesis of NBCCS-associated KCOTs. In contrast to wild-type ptch1, ptch1-C727VfsX745 and ptch1‑S733IfsX736 clearly exhibited reduced binding to cyclin B1. Moreover, the cells expressing these two mutations demonstrated an increase in cell cycle progression and these two mutation constructs failed to inhibit cell proliferation. In addition, the mutants enhanced the activity of glioma-associated oncogene family zinc finger 1 (GLI1), a downstream reporter of Hh signaling. Thus, our data suggest that the non-canonical Hh pathway mediated through ptch1 and cyclin B1 is involved in the pathogenesis of NBCCS-associated KCOTs. The C-terminus of ICL in ptch1 may also be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of this disease.",

Mice in which one copy of Ptch1 is inactivated show increased susceptibility to spontaneous tumor development and hypersensitivity to radiation-induced tumorigenesis, providing an ideal in vivo model to study the typical pathologies associated with basal cell nevus syndrome. We therefore examined BCC development in control and irradiated Ptch1(neo67/+) mice. We show that unirradiated mice develop putative BCC precursor lesions, i.e., basaloid hyperproliferation areas arising from both follicular and interfollicular epithelium, and that these lesions progress to nodular and infiltrative BCCs only in irradiated mice. Data of BCC incidence, multiplicity, and latency support the notion of epidermal hyperproliferations, nodular and infiltrative BCC-like tumors representing different stages of tumor development. This is additionally supported by the pattern of p53 protein expression observed in BCC subtypes and by the finding of retention of the normal remaining Ptch1 allele in all nodular, circumscribed BCCs analyzed compared with its constant loss in infiltrative BCCs. Our data suggest chronological tumor progression from basaloid hyperproliferations to nodular and then infiltrative BCC occurring in a stepwise fashion through the accumulation of sequential genetic alterations.",

Mortality rates due to BCC are low, but its increasing incidence and prolonged morbidity means the disease is costly to treat. Early recognition and effective treatment are therefore important, to reduce the incidence of BCC and lighten the economic burden of its management. This paper reviews current treatments for BCC, including excision and curettage, electrodessication, surgery, cryosurgery, radiotherapy, and treatment with 5-fluorouracil and intralesional/perilesional cytokines.

PTCH1 normally functions by repressing the activity of the Smoothened (SMO) receptor. Inactivating PTCH1 mutations result in constitutive Hedgehog pathway activity through uncontrolled SMO signaling. Targeting this pathway with vismodegib, a novel SMO inhibitor, results in impressive tumor regression in patients harboring genetic defects in this pathway. However, a secondary mutation in SMO has been reported in medulloblastoma patients following relapse on vismodegib to date. This mutation preserves pathway activity, but appears to confer resistance by interfering with drug binding. Here we report for the first time on the molecular mechanisms of resistance to vismodegib in two BCC cases. The first case, showing progression after 2 months of continuous vismodegib (primary resistance), exhibited the new SMO G497W mutation. The second case, showing a complete clinical response after 5 months of treatment and a subsequent progression after 11 months on vismodegib (secondary resistance), exhibited a PTCH1 nonsense mutation in both the pre- and the post-treatment specimens, and the SMO D473Y mutation in the post-treatment specimens only. In silico analysis demonstrated that SMO(G497W) undergoes a conformational rearrangement resulting in a partial obstruction of the protein drug entry site, whereas the SMO D473Y mutation induces a direct effect on the binding site geometry leading to a total disruption of a stabilizing hydrogen bond network. Thus, the G497W and D473Y SMO mutations may represent two different mechanisms leading to primary and secondary resistance to vismodegib, respectively.",

The propositus was diagnosed with medulloblastoma at the age of 2 years and underwent surgery, chemotherapy, and craniospinal irradiation. At the age of 6 years, he was diagnosed with NBCCS following his presentation with a large odontogenic keratocyst of the mandible, pits of the palms and soles and numerous BCCs in the area of the back and neck that had been irradiated previously for medulloblastoma. Examination of other relatives showed that the propositus' mother also had NBCCS but was more mildly affected; in particular, she had no BCCs. This case illustrates complex gene-environment interaction, in that increased skin pigmentation in African-Americans is presumably protective against ultraviolet, but not ionizing, radiation. This case and other similar cases in the literature show the importance of considering NBCCS in the differential diagnosis of any patient who presents with a medulloblastoma, especially before the age of 5 years, and of examining other close relatives for signs of NBCCS to determine the patient's at-risk status. Finally, for individuals who are radiosensitive, protocols that utilize chemotherapy in lieu of radiotherapy should be considered.",

Mutations in some of these genes have been shown to cause cancer. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of the skin is the most common cancer in humans. More than 750000 new cases are diagnosed annually, and the incidence is rising. BCCs are slow-growing, locally invasive tumors that rarely metastasize but can result in extensive morbidity through local recurrence and tissue destruction. Epidemiologic studies suggest that sunlight (particularly UVB radiation) is a strong risk factor for BCC formation, although other factors are also involved. The nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS), a rare genetic disorder, is characterized by predisposition to BCCs and other tumors as well as to a wide range of developmental defects. NBCCS maps to chromosome 9q22.3, and loss of heterozygosity at this site in both sporadic and hereditary BCCs suggests that it functions as a tumor suppressor. The gene for NBCCS was recently cloned and is the human homologue of the Drosophila gene \"patched.\" Genetic studies in Drosophila show that patched is part of the hedgehog signaling pathway, which is important in determining embryonic patterning and cell fate in multiple structures of the developing embryo. Human patched is mutated in both hereditary and sporadic BCCs, and inactivation of this gene is probably a necessary, if not sufficient, step for BCC formation. Delineation of the biochemical pathway in which patched functions may lead to rational medical therapy for BCCs and possibly for other tumors associated with NBCCS.",

The maximum thickness of the BCC was measured by 20MHz pulsed ultrasound prior to treatment and again 4-6 weeks and 12 months following treatment. The response of Gorlin syndrome lesions was compared to those in the overall sporadic population and then to a subpopulation matched as closely as possible for age, lesion thickness and site.;For both populations, the average pre-treatment BCC thickness by US was 1.5mm (overall range 0.3-5.3), and the average thickness at 4-6 weeks post-treatment was 0.5mm (overall range 0-4.3). Those BCC less than 1.5mm thick prior to treatment were significantly more likely to have no US evidence of disease at 4-6 weeks than and were more likely to be controlled at 12 months.;The average response to ALA PDT of Gorlin syndrome-related BCC closely resembles that for the sporadic population, with the same wide range of responses for a given dose.

Therefore ODC is a potentially important target for chemoprevention of basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), the majority of which have mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene known as patched (PTCH). To assess this possibility, we first overexpressed ODC in the skin of Ptch1+/- mice using a keratin 6 (K6) promoter that directs constitutive ODC expression in the outer root sheath of the hair follicle. UVB irradiation of these mice accelerated induction of BCCs as compared with their Ptch1+/- littermates. To further verify the role of ODC in BCC tumorigenesis, we used an antizyme (AZ) approach to inhibit ODC activity in the Ptch1+/- mice. Ptch1+/- mice with AZ overexpression driven by the K6 promoter were resistant to the induction of BCCs by UVB. Furthermore, oral administration of the suicidal ODC inhibitor alpha-difluoromethylornithine reduced UVB-induced BCCs in Ptch1+/- mice. These results demonstrate the crucial importance of ODC for the induction of BCCs and indicate that chemopreventive strategies directed at inhibiting this enzyme may be useful in reducing BCCs in human populations.",

NBCCS is an autosomal dominantly inherited disease with an estimated prevalence of 1:150,000 and diagnosis of this syndrome is often an accidental finding of radiological investigations. The purpose of this study was to report the varied radiological and dermatological manifestations of our patients affected with NBCCS and to present this rare syndrome as a differential diagnosis of skeletal anomalies.;Between 1994 and 2005 the demographic, clinical, radiological and histological data of 8 patients with NBCCS were retrospectively analyzed. Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome was diagnosed in the event of two major or one major and two minor criteria. The major criteria are more than 2 basal cell carcinoma, odontogenic keratocysts, three or more palmar pits, and calcification of the falx cerebri.;Between 1994 and 2005 8 patients (3 females and 5 males) with NBCCS were treated in our departments. The average age at the time of diagnosis of NBCCS was 49.9 years. All patients had a minimum of two major criteria. The major criteria with the most frequency were the basal cell carcinoma (6 patients) and the odontogenic keratocysts (5 patients), followed by the calcification of the falx cerebri and palmoplantar pits (4 patients). There was no gender-related or age-related predilection and only one patient was affected with pain in his fingers which radiologically correlated to small cystic bone lesions (\"flame-shaped lucencies\").;Due to limitations in identification of mutations in the PTCH1 gene, clinical and radiological examination still remains a very important factor in the treatment of patients suffering from NBCCS. The knowledge of the varied skeletal manifestations and constellations is therefore essential and correlates with therapeutic consequences. Often chest, rib, spine, skull, and jaw X-rays show the way. Due to the risk of the development of an associated medulloblastoma, neurological surveillance in 6-month intervals in addition to an annual MRI of the cerebrum up to an age of 7 is strongly recommended.",

Seven of the 10 treated lesions were completely free of basaloid cells when biopsied and two partially regressed. Two of the 7 exhibited seborrheic keratosis in the absence of basaloid cells. One of the 10 treated lesions recurred by week 10 and histologically had the appearance of a squamous cell carcinoma. No scars were visible at the healed sites of any of the successfully ablated lesions. One hundred pulses were sufficient for complete ablation of BCCs with a single, 1-min nanoelectroablation treatment. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is one of the most common cancers. Surgical extirpation is currently the standard of care for BCC, which is associated with several advantages and disadvantages. Procedures such as surgical excision used to treat superficial BCC (sBCC) and nodular BCC (nBCC) may have high 5-year recurrence rates if tumors are not completely excised. Curettage with electrodesiccation is a common method for treating primary BCC. However, multiple cycles are recommended and the procedure can have unsatisfactory cosmetic results (e.g. scarring and hypopigmentation). Mohs micrographic surgery has a low rate of disease recurrence but is a specialized procedure usually limited to specific indications (e.g. high-risk tumors). Cryosurgery and photodynamic therapy require multiple cycles and are associated with variable cosmetic outcomes and recurrence rates. As with any procedure, potential risks and patient quality-of-life issues need to be considered. In addition, substantial patient and healthcare provider inconvenience limit the practical utility of some modalities. Pharmacologic interventions provide another treatment option as adjunctive or monotherapy. Investigations of imiquimod, a novel immune response modifier, have indicated that this topical, noninvasive agent is safe and well tolerated and may be efficacious in the treatment of BCC. This review will highlight the role of standard treatment modalities and introduce new advances in the treatment of BCC.",

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1) is a nuclear enzyme that plays a multifunctional role in DNA damage signaling and repair. In healthy and fertile PARP-1-null mice, radiation exposure reveals an extreme sensitivity and a high genomic instability. To test for interactions between PARP-1 and sonic hedgehog signaling, PARP-1-null mice were crossed to Ptc1 heterozygous mice. PARP-1 deletion further accelerated medulloblastoma development in irradiated Ptc1(+/-) mice, showing that PARP-1 inactivation sensitizes cerebellar cells to radiation tumorigenic effects. In addition to increased formation and slowed down kinetics of disappearance of gamma-H2AX foci, we observed increased apoptosis in PARP-1-deficient granule cell progenitors after irradiation. Double-mutant mice were also strikingly more susceptible to BCC, with >50% of animals developing multiple, large, infiltrative tumors within 30 weeks of age.

BCC, the most common type of human cancer, is driven by the aberrant activation of hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Ptch, a tumor suppressor gene of Hh signaling pathway, and Smoothened play a key role in the development of radiation-induced BCCs in animal models. Epidemiological studies provide evidence that humans exposed to radiation as observed among the long-term, large scale cohorts of atomic bomb survivors, bone marrow transplant recipients, patients with tinea capitis and radiologic workers enhances risk of BCCs. Overall, this risk is higher in Caucasians than other races. People who were exposed early in life develop more BCCs. The enhanced IR correlation with BCC and not other common cutaneous malignancies is intriguing. The mechanism underlying these observations remains undefined. Understanding interactions between radiation-induced signaling pathways and those which drive BCC development may be important in unraveling the mechanism associated with this enhanced risk. Recent studies showed that Vismodegib, a Smoothened inhibitor, is effective in treating radiation-induced BCCs in humans, suggesting that common strategies are required for the intervention of BCCs development irrespective of their etiology.

        "Doc_abstract":"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common human cancer. Patients with basal cell nevus syndrome (Gorlin syndrome) are highly susceptible to developing many BCCs as a result of a constitutive inactivating mutation in one allele of PATCHED 1, which encodes a tumor suppressor that is a major inhibitor of Hedgehog signaling. Dysregulated Hedgehog signaling is a common feature of both hereditary and sporadic BCCs. Recently, we showed remarkable anti-BCC chemopreventive efficacy of tazarotene, a retinoid with retinoic acid receptor (RAR) beta/gamma specificity, in Ptch1+/- mice when treatment was commenced before carcinogenic insults. In this study, we assessed whether the effect of tazarotene against BCC carcinogenesis is sustained after its withdrawal and whether tazarotene is effective against preexisting microscopic BCC lesions. We found that BCCs did not reappear for at least 5 months after topical drug treatment was stopped and that already developed, microscopic BCCs were susceptible to tazarotene inhibition. In vitro, tazarotene inhibited a murine BCC keratinocyte cell line, ASZ001, suggesting that its effect in vivo is by direct action on the actual tumor cells. Down-regulation of Gli1, a target gene of Hedgehog signaling and up-regulation of CRABPII, a target gene of retinoid signaling, were observed with tazarotene treatment. Finally, we investigated the effects of topical applications of other retinoid-related compounds on BCC tumorigenesis in vivo. Tazarotene was the most effective of the preparations studied, and its effect most likely was mediated by RARgamma activation. Furthermore, inhibition of basal RAR signaling in the skin promoted BCC carcinogenesis, suggesting that endogenous RAR signaling restrains BCC growth.",

Our results show that Ptc1(neo67/+) mouse skin irradiated in early anagen is highly susceptible to tumor induction, as a 3.2-fold incidence of visible BCC-like tumors was observed in anagen-irradiated compared with telogen-irradiated mice. Microscopic nodular BCC-like tumors were also enhanced by irradiation during active hair-follicle growth phases. Interestingly, histologic examination of the tumors revealed a qualitative difference in BCC tumorigenesis depending on hair growth phase at the time of exposure. In fact, in addition to typical BCC-like tumors, we observed development of a distinct basal cell tumor subtype characterized by anti-cytokeratin 14 and anti-smooth muscle actin reactivity. These tumors showed relatively short latency and rapid growth and were strictly dependent on age at irradiation, as they occurred only in mice irradiated in early anagen phase. Examination of anatomic and immunohistochemical relationships revealed a close relation of these tumors with the follicular outer root sheath of anagen skin. In contrast, there are strong indications for the derivation of typical, smooth muscle actin-negative BCC-like tumors from cell progenitors of interfollicular epidermis. These results underscore the role of follicular bulge stem cells and their progeny with high self-renewal capacity in the formation of basal cell tumors and contribute to clarify the relationship between target cell and tumor phenotype in BCC tumorigenesis induced by radiation.",

The authors have therefore cultured skin fibroblasts from 5 NBCCS patients and measured their radiosensitivity in terms of clonogenic survival. Our results showed that, compared with 6 normal controls, the NBCCS cells were hypersensitive to X-rays. The average D0 (the inverse of the slope of the survival curve) for the NBCCS cells was 98 rads, compared with 142 rads for the normal controls and 44 rads for an ataxia telangiectasia (AT) strain. The average D10 values (the dose required to reduce survival to 10%) were 258, 351, and 123 rads for the NBCCS, normal, and AT strains, respectively. Unscheduled DNA synthesis measurements showed that NBCCS cells were not defective in excision repair of X-ray-damaged DNA. Pulse labeling index measurements showed that NBCCS cells were abnormally inhibited in the initiation of DNA synthesis following X-irradiation. The mechanisms underlying the radiosensitivity of NBCCS differ in several respects from those of AT.

BCC is generally a disorder of white individuals, especially those with fair skin. UV radiation is the most important risk factor in the development of BCC. Short-wavelength UVB radiation (290-320 nm, sunburn rays) is believed to play a greater role in BCC formation than long-wavelength UVA radiation (320-400 nm, tanning rays). A latency period of 20-50 years is typical between the time of UV damage and the clinical onset of BCC. Therefore, in most cases BCC develops on chronically sun-exposed skin in elderly people, most commonly in the area of head and neck. UVB radiation damages DNA and its repair system and alters the immune system resulting in a progressive genetic alterations and formation of neoplasm. UV-induced mutations in the TP53 tumor-suppressor gene have been found in about 50% of BCC cases. The mutations that activate the Hedgehog intercellular signaling pathway genes, including PTCH, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Smoothened (Smo) play a significant role in cutaneous carcinogenesis. Epidemiologic studies demonstrate the higher incidence of the BCC in more equatorial latitudes than in polar latitudes. Other risk factors for the development of BCC include sun bed use, family history of skin cancers, skin type 1 and 2, immunosuppression, previous radiotherapy, and chronic exposure to toxic substances such as inorganic arsenic. Although rarely metastatic, its malignant nature is sometimes emphasized by the local tissue destruction, disfigurement, and even death if left untreated.

Ptch1 heterozygous mice mimic the predisposition to BCC and MB development of patients affected by nevoid BCC syndrome that inherit a mutant Patched (Ptch1) allele. To examine the impact of genetic background on development of BCCs and other tumors we used two outbred mouse lines characterized by extremely high, carcinogenesis-susceptible (Car-S), and low, carcinogenesis-resistant (Car-R), susceptibility to skin carcinogenesis. Crosses between Ptch1(neo67/+) mice and Car-S (F1S) or Car-R mice (F1R) were exposed to ionizing radiation. F1SPtch1(neo67/+) mice were highly susceptible to radiation-induced BCCs, whereas F1RPtch1(neo67/+) mice were completely resistant, indicating that tumor penetrance can be modulated by genetic background. Development of microscopic and macroscopic BCC lesions was influenced by Car-S and Car-R genotypes, suggesting a genetic-background effect on both initiation and progression of BCC. Susceptibility was additionally increased in N2 backcross mice (Car-S x F1SPtch1(neo67/+)), showing a contribution from recessive-acting Car-S modifiers. The modifying effects of Car-S-derived susceptibility alleles were tissue specific. In fact, despite higher susceptibility to BCC induction, Car-S-derived lines had lower MB incidence compared with CD1Ptch1(neo67/+) mice. BCC-associated somatic events were not influenced by genetic background, as shown by similar rate of wild-type Ptch1 loss in BCCs from F1SPtch1(neo67/+) (93%) and CD1Ptch1(neo67/+) mice (100%). Finally, microsatellite analysis of BCCs showed Ptch1 loss through interstitial deletion. These results are relevant to humans, in which BCC is the commonest malignancy, because this model system may be used to study genes modifying BCC development.",

Inhibitors of this pathway that are currently in clinical trials inhibit Smo. However, mutations in Smo can result in resistance to these inhibitors. To target most BCCs and avoid acquired resistance because of Smo mutations, inhibiting the Shh-pathway downstream of Smo is critical. Attractive downstream targets would be at the level of Gli proteins, the transcriptional activators of this pathway in BCCs. Previously it has been shown that Gli1 and Gli2, when phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA), are targeted for proteosomal degradation. Here we show that PKA activation via the cAMP agonist forskolin is sufficient to completely abolish oncogenic Smo activity in vitro. In an inducible BCC mouse model due to a Smo mutation that confers resistance to current Smo inhibitors, topical forskolin treatment significantly reduced Gli1 mRNA levels and resulted in strongly suppressed BCC tumor growth. Our data show that forskolin inhibits the growth of even those BCCs that are resistant to Smo inhibitors and provide a proof-of-principle framework for the development of topically applied human skin-permeable novel pharmacologic inhibitors of oncogenic Shh-signaling through PKA activation.",

Analogously, skin carcinogenesis-susceptible (Car-S) mice are elective for studies of papilloma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) induction. We previously reported a striking effect of gender on BCC induction in Ptch1(+/-) mice, with total resistance of females; likewise, Car-S females show increased skin tumor resistance relative to males. Here, we investigated the protective role of endogenous estrogen in skin keratinocyte tumorigenesis. Control (CN) and ovariectomized Ptch1(+/-) or Car-S females were irradiated for BCC induction or topically treated with chemical carcinogens for SCC induction. Susceptibility to BCC or SCC was dramatically increased in ovariectomized Ptch1(+/-) and Car-S females and restored to levels observed in males. Remarkably, progression of initially benign papillomas to malignant SCC occurred only in ovariectomized Car-S females. We explored the mechanisms underlying tumor progression and report overexpression of estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha, downregulation of ERbeta and upregulation of cyclin D1 in papillomas from ovariectomized Car-S relative to papillomas from CN females. Thus, an imbalanced ERalpha/ERbeta expression may be associated with estrogen-mediated modulation of non-melanoma skin carcinogenesis, with a key role played by cyclin D1.

Gorlin syndrome is the main consideration and the gene most commonly mutated is PTCH1, a key regulator of the Hedgehog developmental pathway. Recently, loss of function of another gene in the same pathway, SUFU, has been found to explain a subset of families. Understanding the pathogenesis of familial BCCs has advanced the understanding of the biology of sporadic tumours and led to targeted therapy trials. The management of familial BCCs remains a challenge due to significant unmet needs for non-surgical treatments and a high burden of disease for the individual. Together with the prospect of advances in gene discovery and translation, these challenges highlight the need for ongoing review of at-risk and affected individuals by a multidisciplinary team. ",

Interferon (IFN)-based therapy is quite effective in BCC treatment, but the molecular basis is not well understood. Here we report a novel mechanism by which IFNalpha mediates apoptosis in BCCs. In the presence of IFNalpha, we observed increased apoptosis in a BCC cell line ASZ001, in which PTC is null, and therefore with constitutive activation of the sonic hedgehog pathway. We demonstrate that SMO agonist Ag-1.4 mediates activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) phosphorylation, which is abrogated by IFNalpha in sonic hedgehog responsive C3H10T1/2 cells. In transient transfection experiments, we demonstrate that IFNalpha inhibits Erk phosphorylation and serum response element activation induced by expression of SMO, Gli1, PDGFRalpha and activated Raf, but not activated mitogen-activated Erk-regulating kinase (Mek), suggesting that IFNalpha targets mainly on Mek function. We further show that IFNalpha induces expression of Fas in BCC cells through interfering with Mek function. The role of the Fas-L/Fas signaling axis in IFNalpha-mediated apoptosis is demonstrated by the fact that addition of Fas-L neutralizing antibodies, just as caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK, effectively prevents IFNalpha-mediated apoptosis. Thus, our data indicate that IFNalpha-based BCC therapy induces Fas expression and apoptosis through interfering with Mek function.",

Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PATCHED 1 (PTCH1) have been described in both familial and sporadic cases and inactivation of one Patched 1 (Ptch1) allele in mice promotes development of MB. In order to determine candidate genes involved in tumorigenesis of MB, we have screened tumors of heterozygous Ptch1 mice for differentially expressed genes by means of cDNA microarray technology. Our data show that genes involved in cell cycle, signal transduction and metastasis are transcriptionally up-regulated in MB compared to normal cerebellum. Gene ontology analysis reveals cell cycle regulators to be the predominant functional gene class altered in MB of Ptch1 mutants, including D-type cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinase 4. We furthermore describe that overexpression of the growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible gene Gadd45a is common in Ptch1-associated tumors and Ptch1 null embryos. These results suggest that cDNA microarray technology is a useful tool to discover genes involved in the development of MB that arise in response to a persistent activation of sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling.

Specific signal transduction pathways that regulate cell cycling, differentiation and apoptosis are found to be corrupted in skin cancers, e.g., the epidermal growth-stimulating Hedgehog pathway in basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). Mutations in genes coding for proteins in these pathways lead to persistent disturbances that are passed along to daughter cells, e.g., mutations in the gene for the Patched (PTCH) protein in the Hedgehog pathway. Thus far only the point mutations in the P53 gene from squamous cell carcinomas and BCCs, and in PTCH gene from BCC of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) patients appear to be unambiguously attributable to solar UV radiation. Solar UVB radiation is most effective in causing these point mutations.

Additionally GLI1 mRNA was downregulated in lesional skin (1.7 fold; P<0.05). No significant changes were observed between lesional and uninvolved skin for the Hh ligands or Smoothened. Quantitative PCR confirmed these findings. In situ hybridization for GLI1 and PTCH1 was positive in basal cell carcinoma tumor cells, but was negligible in uninvolved or lesional psoriatic skin.

Gradually decreasing dosage levels were employed. During the initial courses of therapy, high doses (2.0-3.0 mg/kg/day) were intended as chemotherapy. In these patients only 6 of 40 (15%) lesions underwent complete clinical regression. In subsequent courses aimed at chemoprevention, the dose was progressively reduced from 1.5 to 0.25 mg/kg/day. During therapy, no new lesions were observed in the patient with the arsenical exposure.

Treatment was discontinued and the patient with the arsenic exposure developed his first new tumor 17 months afterwards; in contrast, the NBCCS patient developed 29 tumors within 13 months. These findings suggest that long-term therapy with isotretinoin is needed for the continuation of the cancer chemopreventive effect. However, the need for continuous rather than intermittent maintenance therapy, and the determination of the optimal dose for this purpose may depend on the etiology of the multiple carcinomas and on the tolerability of the lowest effective dose by the individual patient.

By whole transcriptome sequencing and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, we identified the activation of the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) and of the WNT signaling pathway in two different regions of the primary tumor and of one inoculation metastasis compared to normal brain. We validated the activation of the SHH and of the WNT pathway by qRT-PCR analysis of GLI1 and AXIN2 respectively. GLI1 and AXIN2 were upregulated in the primary tumor and in two inoculation metastases compared to normal brain. Mutational analysis of SMO, PTCH1 and SUFU, three key components of the SHH pathway, revealed a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) in PTCH1 (rs357564). We tested the effect of the GLI-inhibitor arsenic trioxide (ATO) on a short-term cell culture isolated from the metastasis.

Melanin is a natural skin protective factor against UV radiation. Skin cancers associated with long-term exposure to UV radiation are: basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM). The high risk of BCC development is related to acute and repeated exposure to UV causing sunburn. Molecular studies of BBC demonstrated disorders in sonic hedgehog (SHH) cell signaling regulation pathway, associated with the suppressor protein patched homolog 1 gene (PTCH1) mutations. The risk of the BCC development is related to the polymorphism of melanokortin-1 receptor gene (MC1R). Tumor P53 gene mutations observed in BCC cells has been classified as secondary genetic changes. In SCC cells UV-induced mutations were mostly related to P53 gene. Increased expression of cyclooxigenase- 2 gene (COX-2) plays a significant role in the development of SCC. Other pathogenetic factors include intensification of the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-1 α (IL-1α), IL-1β and IL-6). Currently, the role of UVB has been recognized in the pathogenesis of CMM. In CMM cells the following gene mutations were noted: cyclindependent kinase inhibitor 2A INK4A (p16INK4A), cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), Ras, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and proto-oncogene B-Raf (BRAF). The BRAF gene mutations were observed in ~50% of CMM cases. Mutations of P53 gene are not characteristic of CMM cells.

Do powierzchni Ziemi dociera ok. 95% promieniowania ultrafioletowego A (UVA) (320–400 nm) i ok. 5% UVB (280–320 nm). Naturalnym czynnikiem ochronnym skóry przed UV jest melanina. Do raków skóry, których rozwój jest związany z długotrwałym narażeniem na promieniowanie UV, zalicza się niebarwnikowe raki skóry (non-melanoma skin cancers – NMSC) – raka podstawnokomórkowego (basal cell carcinoma – BCC) i raka kolczystokomórkowego (squamous cell carcinoma – SCC) oraz czerniaka złośliwego skóry (cutaneous malignant melanoma – CMM). Wysokie ryzyko rozwoju BCC związane jest z ostrą i wielokrotną ekspozycją na UV, powodującą oparzenia słoneczne. Badania molekularne BCC wykazały zaburzenia na szlaku regulacji sygnalizacji komórkowej sonic hedgehog (SHH), które były związane z mutacjami genu supresorowego PTCH1 (protein patched homolog 1). Ryzyko rozwoju BCC jest również związane z polimorfizmem genu receptora melanokortyny-1 (MC1R). Obserwowane w komórkach BCC mutacje genu P53 klasyfikowano jako wtórne zmiany genetyczne. W komórkach SCC mutacje indukowane UV najczęściej dotyczyły genu P53. W rozwoju SCC istotne znaczenie ma zwiększona ekspresja genu enzymu cyklooksygenazy-2 (COX-2). Innym czynnikiem patogenetycznym SCC jest nasilenie syntezy cytokin prozapalnych (czynnika martwicy nowotworu α (tumor necrosis factor α – TNF-α), interleukiny-1 α (IL-1α), IL-1β i IL-6).

The results obtained were very encouraging: 1. In patients with XP the actinic keratosis rapidly regressed, and the dryness of the skin was markedly reduced during the 5 years under etretinate. During the period without etretinate skin dryness and multiple actinic keratosis soon reappeared, as did, in one case, numerous basal cell carcinomas (BCC). However, etretinate did not prevent the occurrence of a malignant melanoma and of a few lesions of lentigo and naevus. 2.

        "Doc_abstract":"The canonical hedgehog (HH) pathway is a multicomponent signaling cascade (HH, protein patched homolog 1 (PTCH1), smoothened (SMO)) that plays a pivotal role during embryonic development through activation of downstream effector molecules, namely glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1), GLI2 and GLI3. Activation of GLIs must be tightly regulated as they modulate target genes which control tissue patterning, stem cell maintenance, and differentiation during development. However, dysregulation or mutations in HH signaling leads to genomic instability (GI) and various cancers, for example, germline mutation in PTCH1 lead to Gorlin syndrome, a condition where patients develop numerous basal cell carcinomas and rarely rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). Activating mutations in SMO have also been recognized in sporadic cases of medulloblastoma and SMO is overexpressed in many other cancers. Recently, studies in several human cancers have shown that GLI1 expression is independent from HH ligand and canonical intracellular signaling through PTCH and SMO. In fact, this aberrantly regulated GLI1 has been linked to several non-canonical oncogenic growth signals such as Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), avian myelocytomatosis virus oncogene cellular homolog (C-MYC), transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), wingless-type MMTV integration site family (WNT) and β-catenin. Recent studies from our lab and other independent studies demonstrate that aberrantly expressed GLI1 influences the integrity of several DNA damage response and repair signals, and if altered, these networks can contribute to GI and impact tumor response to chemo- and radiation therapies. Furthermore, the ineffectiveness of SMO inhibitors in clinical studies argues for the development of GLI1-specific inhibitors in order to develop effective therapeutic modalities to treat these tumors. In this review, we focus on summarizing current understanding of the molecular, biochemical and cellular basis for aberrant GLI1 expression and discuss GLI1-mediated HH signaling on DNA damage responses, carcinogenesis and chemoresistance.

        "Doc_abstract":"Epidemiological studies suggest that UV exposure from sunlight is the major etiology for skin cancers, both melanocytic and non-melanocytic. However, the radiation-related risk for skin cancer among atomic bomb survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is primarily derived from the excess risk of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), with no demonstrable excess in squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma. The BCCs in this cohort are therefore unusual in being potentially attributable to two types of radiation-UV and ionizing (IR). BCCs have been associated with PTCH and/or p53 tumor suppressor gene alterations. To investigate the roles of these genes in relation to IR and UV exposures, we analyzed both genes in BCC samples from atomic bomb survivors. We examined 47 tumors, of which 70% had non-silent base-substitution p53 mutations independent of IR or UV exposure. However, the distribution of mutation type depends on UV and/or IR exposure. For example, C-to-T transitions at CpG sites adjacent to pyrimidine-pyrimidine (PyPy) sequences were more prevalent in tumors from UV-exposed than UV-shielded body areas and CpG-mutations at non-PyPy sequences were more prevalent in tumors from UV-shielded body areas with high-IR (>or=1 Gy) than low-IR (<0.2 Gy) exposure. And notably, although p53 deletion-frequencies demonstrated no IR-dose associations, deletions at the PTCH locus were more frequent (79% versus 44%) in tumors with high-IR than low-IR exposure. Moreover, 60% of high-IR tumors harbored both p53 and PTCH abnormalities compared with 23% of low-IR tumors. Therefore, alteration of both genes is likely to play a role in radiation-induced basal cell carcinogenesis.",

We summarize clinical features and recent progress in understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of two selected tumor syndromes, namely nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (Gorlin syndrome) and Cowden syndrome. Both are autosomal dominantly inherited disorders. Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome is characterized by the early onset of multiple basal cell carcinomas as as well as developmental defects and a predisposition for other benign and malignant tumors. The syndrome is caused by germline mutations in the PTCH tumor suppressor gene. Cowden syndrome is associated with pathognomonic mucocutaneous lesions, such as facial trichilemmomas, acral keratoses, and mucocutaneous papillomatosis. In addition, Cowden patients are predisposed to carcinomas of the thyroid, breast and endometrium. Cowden syndrome is caused by germline mutations in the PTEN tumor suppressor gene. Identification of the genes causing hereditary tumor syndromes as well as generation of genetically engineered mouse models have greatly advanced our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of these diseases. Furthermore, novel pathogenesis-based pharmacological strategies are being developed that promise to improve prevention and therapy.",

He had previously been diagnosed with basal cell naevus syndrome but had withdrawn from follow-up. His foot showed a deep ulcerating defect accompanied by profound necrosis extending to the metatarsophalangeal joints. There was a nodular skin defect over the first metatarsophalangeal joint, which was shown by histopathology to be a basal cell carcinoma, and the ulcer was bordered by a raised wall. Further physical examination revealed more than 200 dermal lesions which were identified by the dermatologist who was called in for consultation as basal cell carcinomas; multiple depressions due to abnormal local keratinisation were also seen on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. These findings led to a diagnosis of 'basal cell naevus syndrome'. The patient was treated by amputation of the lower leg followed by excision and curettage of the remaining basal cell carcinomas. At the time of the last follow-up, the patient was being checked periodically in the dermatology outpatient clinic. Basal cell naevus syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant hereditary disease. The prevalence is estimated to be between 1 in 57,000 and 1 in 164,000. Basal cell naevus syndrome is generally caused by a mutation in the 'patched homolog' (PTCH)-I gene, located on chromosome 9q22.3. Although the syndrome affects multiple organ systems, the most characteristic of this disorder is the appearance of multiple basal cell carcinomas.",

Yet, fundamental differences in the development of the two different entities have been and are currently unveiled.

Although other signaling pathways are also affected, small hedgehog inhibitory molecules evolve as the most promising basal cell carcinoma treatment options systemically as well as topically in current clinical trials.

        "Doc_abstract":"Exposition of the skin with solar ultraviolet radiation (UV) is the main cause of skin cancer development. The consistently increasing incidences of melanocytic and nonmelanocytic skin tumors are believed to be at least in part associated with recreational sun exposure. Epidemiological data indicate that excessive or cumulative sunlight exposition takes place years and decades before the resulting malignancies arise. The most important defense mechanisms that protect human skin against UV radiation involve melanin synthesis and active repair mechanisms. DNA is the major target of direct or indirect UV-induced cellular damage. Low pigmentation capacity in white Caucasians and rare congenital defects in DNA repair are mainly responsible for protection failures. The important function of nucleotide excision DNA repair (NER) to protect against skin cancer becomes obvious by the rare genetic disease xeroderma pigmentosum, in which diverse NER genes are mutated. In animal models, it has been demonstrated that UVB is more effective to induce skin cancer than UVA. UV-induced DNA photoproducts are able to cause specific mutations (UV-signature) in susceptible genes for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). In SCC development, UV-signature mutations in the p513 tumor suppressor gene are the most common event, as precancerous lesions reveal approximately 80% and SCCs > 90% UV-specific p53 mutations. Mutations in Hedgehog pathway related genes, especially PTCH1, are well known to represent the most significant pathogenic event in BCC. However, specific UV-induced mutations can be found only in approximately 50% of sporadic BCCs. Thus, cumulative UVB radiation can not be considered to be the single etiologic risk factor for BCC development. During the last decades, experimental animal models, including genetically engineered mice, the Xiphophorus hybrid fish, the south american oppossum and human skin xenografts, have further elucidated the important role of the DNA repair system in the multi-step process of UV-induced melanomagenesis. An increasing body of evidence now indicates that nucleotide excision repair is not the only DNA repair pathway that is involved in UV-induced tumorigenesis of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer. An interesting new perspective in DNA damage and repair research lies in the participation of mammalian mismatch repair (MMR) in UV damage correction. As MMR enzyme hMSH2 displays a p53 target gene, is induced by UVB radiation and is involved in NER pathways, studies have now been initiated to elucidate the physiological and pathophysiological role of MMR in malignant melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer development.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Medulloblastoma, an embryonal neuroectodermal tumor of the cerebellum, is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. There are approximately 15 cases diagnosed in the Czech Republic each year. The recent World Health Organization classification recognizes several histopathological subtypes of medulloblastoma: classical, desmoplastic/ nodular with its extensive-nodularity variant, and anaplastic/ large-cell variant. Further molecular analysis identified four basic subgroups of medulloblastoma: WNT, SHH, Group 3, and Group 4. The subgroup of SHH meduloblastoma is associated with somatic mutations of SHH, PTCH1, SUFU, SMO and TP53, while the most common mutations found in infants up to three years of age were PTCH1 and SUFU. The majority of medulloblastomas are sporadic diseases, whereas only about 5- 10% of all cases occur in connection with hereditary genetic syndromes.;We present a case of a 21-months old girl diagnosed with a localized posterior fossa tumor. The histopathological examination revealed a desmoplastic/ nodular medulloblastoma. The treatment comprised a radical exstirpation of the tumor followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. With the use of array-CGH, a partial biallelic deletion of the SUFU gene (locus 10q24.32) was detected in the tumor DNA, whereas a monoallelic deletion was found in the peripheral lymphocyte DNA of the patient. These findings were confirmed by an independent qPCR method. Monoallelic germline deletion of SUFU was also identified in the patients mother, who was a healthy carrier. Pedigree of the family suggested a transition of the germline deletion of SUFU, since another brain tumors (including one case diagnosed before the age of three years) were identified in previous generations.;Germline mutations in SUFU gene are believed to predispose to infant desmoplastic/ nodular medulloblastomas, basal cell carcinomas and meningiomas. The susceptibility gene shows autosomal dominant inheritance with an incomplete penetrance. There is no evidence-based surveillance strategy suggested for the carriers of germline SUFU mutations/ deletions so far. Our recommendation is based both on a family history of our patient and similar cases described in the literature. Since the germinal mutations in SUFU are responsible for up to 50% of all desmoplastic medulloblastomas in children under three years of age, genetic testing of SUFU should be encouraged in this population of patients.",

We interrogated 705 epithelial cancer cell lines for growth             response to the Smo inhibitor cyclopamine and for expressed HH pathway-regulated             species in a linked genetic database. Ptch and Smo mutations that respectively             conferred Smo inhibitor response or resistance were undetected. Previous studies             revealed HH pathway activation in lung cancers. Therefore, findings were validated             using lung cancer cell lines, transgenic and transplantable murine lung cancer             models, and human normal-malignant lung tissue arrays in addition to testing other             Smo inhibitors. Cyclopamine sensitivity most significantly correlated with high             cyclin E (P=0.000009) and low insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6 (IGFBP6)             (P=0.000004) levels.

Newer Smo inhibitors             exhibited a pattern of sensitivity similar to cyclopamine. Gain of cyclin E or             loss of IGFBP6 in lung cancer cells significantly increased Smo inhibitor response.             Cyclin E-driven transgenic lung cancers expressed a gene profile implicating HH             pathway activation.

Activating germline or somatic mutations of genes encoding Hh pathway components are found in Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) and Medulloblastoma (MB). Ligand-dependent Hedgehog hyperactivation, due to autocrine or paracrine mechanisms, is also observed in a large number of malignancies of the breast, colon, skin, bladder, pancreas and other tissues. The key tumorigenic role of Hedgehog has prompted effort aimed at identifying inhibitors of this signaling. To date, only the antagonists of the membrane transducer Smo have been approved for therapy or are under clinical trials in patients with BCC and MB linked to Ptch or Smo mutations. Despite the good initial response, patients treated with Smo antagonists have eventually developed resistance due to the occurrence of compensating mechanisms. Furthermore, Smo antagonists are not effective in tumors where the Hedgehog hyperactivation is due to mutations of pathway components downstream of Smo, or in case of non-canonical, Smo-independent activation of the Gli transcription factors. For all these reasons, the research of Hh inhibitors acting downstream of Smo is becoming an area of intensive investigation. In this review we illustrate the progresses made in the identification of effective Hedgehog inhibitors and their application in cancer, with a special emphasis on the newly identified downstream inhibitors. We describe in detail the Gli inhibitors and illustrate their mode of action and applications in experimental and/or clinical settings. ",

In particular, the PTCH gene is important both for embryonic structuring and cellular cycle, therefore, its mutation represents a key event for the development of the disease. From a clinical point of view, the syndrome requires a multidisciplinary approach meaning that a successful treatment needs the simultaneous co-operation of different specialists. Thus, a correct treatment entails the following steps: an early detection of the disease, an extended family history and a careful evaluation of symptoms. The aim of this article was to highlight the main pathologic and genetic features of Gorlin-Goltz Syndrome, its outbreak frequency and the main characteristics of the population clusters it is more likely to hit.

Abnormal activities of Shh signaling pathway have been implicated in tumorigenesis such as basal cell carcinomas and medulloblastomas. Here we show that Shh signaling negatively regulates prostatic epithelial ductal morphogenesis. In organotypic cultures of developing rat prostates, Shh inhibited cell proliferation and promoted differentiation of luminal epithelial cells. The expression pattern of Shh and its receptors suggests a paracrine mechanism of action. The Shh receptors Ptc1 (Patched1) and Ptc2 were found to be expressed in prostatic stromal cells adjacent to the epithelium, where Shh itself was produced. This paracrine model was confirmed by co-culturing the developing prostate in the presence of stromal cells transfected with a vector expressing a constitutively active form of Smoothened, the real effector of the Shh signaling pathway. Furthermore, expression of activin A and TGF-beta1 that were shown previously to inhibit prostatic epithelial branching was up-regulated following Shh treatment in the organotypic cultures. Taken together, these results suggest that Shh negatively regulates prostatic ductal branching indirectly by acting on the surrounding stromal cells, at least partly via up-regulating expression of activin A and TGF-beta1.",

Redesignation of the OKC as the KCOT by the World Health Organization (WHO) is based on the well-known aggressive behaviour of this lesion, its histology and new information regarding its genetics. Abnormal function of PTCH, a tumour suppressor gene, is noted to be involved in both nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome and sporadic KCOTs. Normally, PTCH forms a receptor complex with the oncogene SMO for the SHH ligand. PTCH binding to SMO inhibits growth-signal transduction. SHH binding to PTCH releases inhibition of the signal transduction pathway. If normal functioning of PTCH is lost, the proliferation-stimulating effects of SMO are permitted to predominate. A review of the literature was conducted and results were tabulated to determine whether treatment modality is related to recurrence rate. More aggressive treatment - resection or enucleation supplemented with Carnoy\"s solution with or without peripheral ostectomy - results in a lower recurrence rate than enucleation alone or marsupialization. Notably, the recurrence rate after marsupialization followed by enucleation is not significantly higher than that following the so-called aggressive modalities. Our case series consists of 21 patients treated for KCOTs. Results were organized to demonstrate recurrence as it relates to size of lesion and time since treatment and incidence as it relates to patient age and location in the jaws. In our series, the average KCOT surface area measured radiographically was 14 cm<sup>2</sup>. Most lesions were within the 0-15 cm<sup>2</sup> range and lesions in this range resulted in the greatest number and proportion of recurrences. The recurrence rate of 29% in our case series was consistent with previously established data; all recurrences occurred within 2 years post-intervention. The incidence of primary lesions was highest in the age group 70-79 years; most lesions occurred in the posterior mandible. WHO\"s reclassification of the OKC as the KCOT based on behaviour, histology and genetics underscores the aggressive nature of the lesion and should motivate clinicians to manage the disease in a correspondingly aggressive manner. The most effective interventions for the KCOT are either enucleation with Carnoy\"s solution, or marsupialization with later cystectomy. Future treatment may involve molecular-based modalities, which may reduce or eliminate the need for aggressive surgical management.",

Treatment of Daoy cells with Sonic HH or Smoothened agonist induced expression of GLI1 protein and simultaneously prevented the processing of GLI3 to its repressor form. To study interactions between HH- and EGF-induced signaling in greater detail, time-resolved measurements were carried out and analyzed at the transcriptomic and proteomic levels. The Daoy cells responded to the HH/EGF co-treatment by downregulating GLI1, PTCH, and HHIP at the transcript level; this was also observed when Amphiregulin (AREG) was used instead of EGF. We identified a novel crosstalk mechanism whereby EGFR signaling silences proteins acting as negative regulators of HH signaling, as AKT- and ERK-signaling independent process. EGFR/HH signaling maintained high GLI1 protein levels which contrasted the GLI1 downregulation on the transcript level. Conversely, a high-level synergism was also observed, due to a strong and significant upregulation of numerous canonical EGF-targets with putative tumor-promoting properties such as MMP7, VEGFA, and IL-8. In conclusion, synergistic effects between EGFR and HH signaling can selectively induce a switch from a canonical HH/GLI profile to a modulated specific target gene profile. This suggests that there are more wide-spread, yet context-dependent interactions, between HH/GLI and growth factor receptor signaling in human malignancies.",
