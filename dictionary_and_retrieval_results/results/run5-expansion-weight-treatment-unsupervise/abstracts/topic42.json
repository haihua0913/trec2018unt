        "Doc_abstract":"Deregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is implicated in tumor progression. We attempt to identify the tumor suppressive miRNA not only down-regulated in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) but also potent to inhibit the oncogene EZH2, and then investigate the biological function and pathophysiologic role of the candidate miRNA in GBM. In this study, we show that miRNA-138 is reduced in both GBM clinical specimens and cell lines, and is effective to inhibit EZH2 expression. Moreover, high levels of miR-138 are associated with long overall and progression-free survival of GBM patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset (TCGA) data portal. Ectopic expression of miRNA-138 effectively inhibits GBM cell proliferation in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo through inducing cell cycles G1/S arrest. Mechanism investigation reveals that miRNA-138 acquires tumor inhibition through directly targeting EZH2, CDK6, E2F2 and E2F3. Moreover, an EZH2-mediated signal loop, EZH2-CDK4/6-pRb-E2F1, is probably involved in GBM tumorigenicity, and this loop can be blocked by miRNA-138. Additionally, miRNA-138 negatively correlates to mRNA levels of EZH2 and CDK6 among GBM clinical samples from both TCGA and our small amount datasets. In conclusion, our data demonstrate a tumor suppressive role of miRNA-138 in GBM tumorigenicity, suggesting a potential application in GBM therapy.",

In this study, we analyzed relevant molecular and clinical variables in 194 primary GBMs and tested them for survival analysis. Although most of the tumors showed a mutually exclusive pattern, concurrent alterations of EGFR and p53 were detected. Survival analysis of CDK4 amplification revealed a highly significant association with a worse clinical outcome (P = .01), whereas MDM2, CDK6, PTEN, and p21 were not associated with patient survival. Multivariate analysis including the significant clinical and molecular variables revealed CDK4 amplification, age, and radiotherapy to be markers with independent prognostic value. In addition, the primary GBM tumors showing simultaneous EGFR and p53 alterations were significantly associated with worse survival (P < .01).

Targeting the CDK4/CDK6-cyclin D1-Rb-p16/ink4a pathway using a potent CDK4 and CDK6 kinase inhibitor has potential for treating primary central nervous system tumors such as glioblastoma and some peripheral tumors with high incidence of brain metastases. We compared central nervous system exposures of two orally bioavailable CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors: abemaciclib, which is currently in advanced clinical development, and palbociclib (IBRANCE; Pfizer), which was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Abemaciclib antitumor activity was assessed in subcutaneous and orthotopic glioma models alone and in combination with standard of care temozolomide (TMZ). Both inhibitors were substrates for xenobiotic efflux transporters P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistant protein expressed at the blood-brain barrier. Brain Kp,uu values were less than 0.2 after an equimolar intravenous dose indicative of active efflux but were approximately 10-fold greater for abemaciclib than palbociclib. Kp,uu increased 2.8- and 21-fold, respectively, when similarly dosed in P-gp-deficient mice. Abemaciclib had brain area under the curve (0-24 hours) Kp,uu values of 0.03 in mice and 0.11 in rats after a 30 mg/kg p.o. dose. Orally dosed abemaciclib significantly increased survival in a rat orthotopic U87MG xenograft model compared with vehicle-treated animals, and efficacy coincided with a dose-dependent increase in unbound plasma and brain exposures in excess of the CDK4 and CDK6 Ki values. Abemaciclib increased survival time of intracranial U87MG tumor-bearing rats similar to TMZ, and the combination of abemaciclib and TMZ was additive or greater than additive. These data show that abemaciclib crosses the blood-brain barrier and confirm that both CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors reach unbound brain levels in rodents that are expected to produce enzyme inhibition; however, abemaciclib brain levels are reached more efficiently at presumably lower doses than palbociclib and are potentially on target for a longer period of time.

In this study, we profiled DNA copy number and mRNA expression in 21 independent GBM tumor lines maintained as subcutaneous xenografts (GBMX), and compared GBMX molecular signatures to those observed in GBM clinical specimens derived from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The predominant copy number signature in both tumor groups was defined by chromosome-7 gain/chromosome-10 loss, a poor-prognosis genetic signature. We also observed, at frequencies similar to that detected in TCGA GBM tumors, genomic amplification and overexpression of known GBM oncogenes, such as EGFR, MDM2, CDK6, and MYCN, and novel genes, including NUP107, SLC35E3, MMP1, MMP13, and DDX1. The transcriptional signature of GBMX tumors, which was stable over multiple subcutaneous passages, was defined by overexpression of genes involved in M phase, DNA replication, and chromosome organization (MRC) and was highly similar to the poor-prognosis mitosis and cell-cycle module (MCM) in GBM. Assessment of gene expression in TCGA-derived GBMs revealed overexpression of MRC cancer genes AURKB, BIRC5, CCNB1, CCNB2, CDC2, CDK2, and FOXM1, which form a transcriptional network important for G2/M progression and/or checkpoint activation. Our study supports propagation of GBM tumors as subcutaneous xenografts as a useful approach for sustaining key molecular characteristics of patient tumors, and highlights therapeutic opportunities conferred by this GBMX tumor panel for testing targeted therapeutic strategies for GBM treatment.",

The impact of miR-129-1 downregulation on GBM pathogenesis has yet to be elucidated.;MiR-129-1 was overexpressed in GBM cells, and its effect on proliferation was investigated by cell cycle assay. MiR-129-1 predicted targets (CDK6, IGF1, HDAC2, IGF2BP3 and MAPK1) were also evaluated by western blot and luciferase assay.;Restoration of miR-129-1 reduced cell proliferation and induced G1 accumulation, significantly. Several functional assays confirmed IGF2BP3, MAPK1 and CDK6 as targets of miR-129-1. Despite the fact that IGF1 expression can be suppressed by miR-129-1, through 3'-untranslated region complementary sequence, we could not find any association between IGF1 expression and GBM.

        "Doc_abstract":"MicroRNA (miRNA) holds promise as a novel therapeutic tool for cancer treatment. However, the transfection efficiency of current delivery systems represents a bottleneck for clinical applications. Here, we demonstrate that gap junctions mediate an augmentative effect on the antiproliferation mediated by miR-124-3p in U87 and C6 glioblastoma cells. The functional inhibition of gap junctions using either siRNA or pharmacological inhibition eliminated the miR-124-3p-mediated antiproliferation, whereas the enhancement of gap junctions with retinoic acid treatment augmented this miR-124-3p-mediated antiproliferation. A similar effect was observed in glioblastoma xenograft models. More importantly, patch clamp and co-culture assays demonstrated the transmission of miR-124-3p through gap junction channels into adjacent cells. In further exploring the impact of gap junction-mediated transport of miR-124-3p on miR-124-3p target pathways, we found that miR-124-3p inhibited glioblastoma cell growth in part by decreasing the protein expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 6, leading to cell cycle arrest at the G0 /G1 phase; moreover, pharmacological regulation of gap junctions affected this cell cycle arrest. In conclusion, our results indicate that the \"bystander\" effects of functional gap junctions composed of connexin 43 enhance the antitumor effect of miR-124-3p in glioblastoma cells by transferring miR-124-3p to adjacent cells, thereby enhancing G0 /G1 cell cycle arrest.

        "Doc_abstract":"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a fatal primary brain tumor harboring myriad genetic and epigenetic alterations. The recent multidimensional analysis of the GBM genome has provided a more complete view of the landscape of such alterations and their linked pathways. This effort has demonstrated that certain pathways are universally altered, but that the specific genetic events altered within each pathway can vary for each particular patient's tumor. With this atlas of genetic and epigenetic events, it now becomes feasible to assess how the patterns of mutations in a pathway influence response to drugs that are targeting such pathways. This issue is particularly important for GBM because, in contrast to other tumor types, molecularly targeted therapies have failed to alter overall survival substantially. Here, we combined functional genetic screens and comprehensive genomic analyses to identify CDK6 as a GBM oncogene that is required for proliferation and viability in a subset of GBM cell lines and tumors. Using an available small molecule targeting cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4 and 6, we sought to determine if the specific pattern of retinoblastoma pathway inactivation dictated the response to CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy. We showed that codeletion of CDKN2A and CDKN2C serves as a strong predictor of sensitivity to a selective inhibitor of CDK4/6. Thus, genome-informed drug sensitivity studies identify a subset of GBMs likely to respond to CDK4/6 inhibition. More generally, these observations demonstrate that the integration of genomic, functional and pharmacologic data can be exploited to inform the development of targeted therapy directed against specific cancer pathways.",

We then overexpressed miR-29c in the SNB19 glioblastoma cell line and found that it markedly downregulated the expression level of CDK6, and accordingly increased the percentage of the tumor cells in the G1 phase from 44.5 to 69.1% and decreased the colony formation efficiency from 81.1 to 51.5%. miR-29c overexpression also increased the percentage of apoptotic cells from 27.2 to 54.8%, and led to a more than 50% decrease in the migratory and invasive abilities of the tumor cells. Our study shows that miR-29c can effectively block the proliferation of glioblastoma cells by inducing G1 arrest, promote their apoptosis, and inhibit their migration and invasion.
