Patients develop benign tumours from several types of cells including neural crest-derived cells. NF1 somatic mutations also occur in 15% of sporadic melanoma, a cancer originating from melanocytes. Evidence now suggests the involvement of NF1 mutations in melanoma resistance to targeted therapies. Although NF1 is ubiquitously expressed, genetic links between NF1 and genes involved in melanocyte biology have been described, implying the lineage-specific mechanisms. In this review, we summarize and discuss the latest advances related to the roles of NF1 in melanocyte biology and in cutaneous melanoma. ",

However, some patients do not respond to this regimen, and nearly all progress to therapeutic resistance. We used a pooled RNA interference screen targeting more than 16,500 genes to discover loss-of-function events that could drive resistance to RAF inhibition. The highest ranking gene was NF1, which encodes neurofibromin, a tumor suppressor that inhibits RAS activity. NF1 loss mediates resistance to RAF and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors through sustained MAPK pathway activation. However, cells lacking NF1 retained sensitivity to the irreversible RAF inhibitor AZ628 and an ERK inhibitor. NF1 mutations were observed in BRAF-mutant tumor cells that are intrinsically resistant to RAF inhibition and in melanoma tumors obtained from patients exhibiting resistance to vemurafenib, thus showing the clinical potential for NF1-driven resistance to RAF/MEK-targeted therapies.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The treatment of melanoma has been revolutionized over the past decade with the development of effective molecular and immune targeted therapies. The great majority of patients with melanoma have mutations in oncogenes that predominantly drive signaling through the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Analytic tools have been developed that can effectively stratify patients into molecular subsets based on the identification of mutations in oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes that drive the MAPK pathway. At the same time, potent and selective inhibitors of mediators of the MAPK pathway such as RAF, MEK, and ERK have become available. The most dramatic example is the development of single-agent inhibitors of BRAF (vemurafenib, dabrafenib, encorafenib) and MEK (trametinib, cobimetinib, binimetinib) for patients with metastatic BRAFV600-mutant melanoma, a subset that represents 40% to 50% of patients with metastatic melanoma. More recently, the elucidation of mechanisms underlying resistance to single-agent BRAF inhibitor therapy led to a second generation of trials that demonstrated the superiority of BRAF inhibitor/MEK inhibitor combinations (dabrafenib/trametinib; vemurafenib/cobimetinib) compared to single-agent BRAF inhibitors. Moving beyond BRAFV600 targeting, a number of other molecular subsets--such as mutations in MEK, NRAS, and non-V600 BRAF and loss of function of the tumor suppressor neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1)--are predicted to respond to MAPK pathway targeting by single-agent pan-RAF, MEK, or ERK inhibitors. As these strategies are being tested in clinical trials, preclinical and early clinical trial data are now emerging about which combinatorial approaches might be best for these patients.",

To date, limited genetic analyses confirmed KIT mutations as a recurrent genetic event similar to other mucosal melanomas, occurring in up to 30% of anorectal melanomas. Importantly, a subset of tumors harboring activating KIT mutations have been found to respond to c-Kit inhibitor-based therapy, with improved patient survival at advanced tumor stages. We performed comprehensive targeted exon sequencing analysis of 467 cancer-related genes in a larger series of 15 anorectal melanomas, focusing on potentially actionable variants based on gain- and loss-of-function mutations. We report the identification of oncogenic driver events in the majority (93%) of anorectal melanomas. These included variants in canonical MAPK pathway effectors rarely observed in cutaneous melanomas (including an HRAS mutation, as well as a BRAF mutation resulting in duplication of threonine 599), and recurrent mutations in the tumor suppressor NF1 in 20% of cases, which represented the second-most frequently mutated gene after KIT in our series. Furthermore, we identify SF3B1 mutations as a recurrent genetic event in mucosal melanomas. Our findings provide an insight into the genetic diversity of anorectal melanomas, and suggest significant potential for alternative targeted therapeutics in addition to c-Kit inhibitors for this melanoma subtype.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 14 October 2016; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2016.179.",

Many studies therefore focus on killing resistant subpopulations, such as Melanoma Initiating Cells (MICs) to prevent relapse. Here we examined whether combining a GSI (γ-Secretase Inhibitor) with ABT-737 (a small molecule BCL-2/BCL-XL/BCL-W inhibitor) can kill both the non-MICs (bulk of melanoma) and MICs. To address the limitations of melanoma therapies, we included multiple tumor samples of patients relapsed from current treatments, with a diverse genetic background (with or without the common BRAF, NRAS or NF1 mutations) in these studies. Excitingly, the combination treatment reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis of the non-MICs; disrupted primary spheres, decreased the ALDH+ cells, and inhibited the self-renewability of the MICs in multiple melanoma cell lines and relapsed patient samples. Using a low-cell-number mouse xenograft model, we demonstrated that the combination significantly reduced the tumor initiating ability of MIC-enriched cultures from relapsed patient samples. Mechanistic studies also indicate that cell death is NOXA-dependent. In summary, this combination may be a promising strategy to address treatment relapse and for triple wild-type patients who do not respond to immunotherapy.",

We evaluated the cytotoxic effects of interferon-β (IFNβ) gene lipofection on tumor cell lines derived from three human cutaneous and four canine mucosal melanomas. The cytotoxicity of human IFNβ gene lipofection resulted higher or equivalent to that of the corresponding addition of the recombinant protein (rhIFNβ) to human cells. IFNβ gene lipofection was not cytotoxic for only one canine melanoma cell line. When cultured as monolayers, three human and three canine IFNβ-lipofected melanoma cell lines displayed a remarkable bystander effect. As spheroids, the same six cell lines were sensitive to IFNβ gene transfer, two displaying a significant multicell resistance phenotype. The effects of conditioned IFNβ-lipofected canine melanoma cell culture media suggested the release of at least one soluble thermolabile cytotoxic factor that could not be detected in human melanoma cells. By using a secretion signal-free truncated human IFNβ, we showed that its intracellular expression was enough to induce cytotoxicity in two human melanoma cell lines. The lower cytoplasmatic levels of reactive oxygen species detected after intracellular IFNβ expression could be related to the resistance displayed by one human melanoma cell line. As IFNβ gene transfer was effective against most of the assayed melanomas in a way not limited by relatively low lipofection efficiencies, the clinical potential of this approach is strongly supported.

Forced expression of full-length or truncated (Delta1-195 amino acids) forms of ATF2 in LU1205, a late-stage human melanoma cell line, elevated the levels of UVC-induced apoptosis. At the same time, either truncated or full-length forms of ATF2 reduced UVC-induced activation of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) promoter and decreased expression of TNFalpha. Forced expression of c-Jun in ATF2-expressing melanoma cells restored TNFalpha expression, suggesting that both forms of ATF2 sequestered transcription factors that positively regulate TNFalpha expression in response to UV irradiation. Antagonistic antibodies to Fas, but not to TNFR1, efficiently suppressed UVC-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the Fas pathway mediates the primary apoptotic signal in melanoma cells whereas the TNFR1 pathway elicits a survival signal. Indeed, treatment of melanoma cells with TNFalpha before UVC irradiation partially suppressed UVC-induced apoptosis, further supporting the protective role of TNFalpha in UVC-treated melanoma cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that ATF2 contributes to UVC-induced apoptosis through transcriptional silencing of TNFalpha, which balances Fas-mediated cell death in melanoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Histopathological evaluation of melanocytic tumours usually allows reliable distinction of benign melanocytic naevi from melanoma. More difficult is the histopathological classification of Spitz tumours, a heterogeneous group of tumours composed of large epithelioid or spindle-shaped melanocytes. Spitz tumours are biologically distinct from conventional melanocytic naevi and melanoma, as exemplified by their distinct patterns of genetic aberrations. Whereas common acquired naevi and melanoma often harbour BRAF mutations, NRAS mutations, or inactivation of NF1, Spitz tumours show HRAS mutations, inactivation of BAP1 (often combined with BRAF mutations), or genomic rearrangements involving the kinases ALK, ROS1, NTRK1, BRAF, RET, and MET. In Spitz naevi, which lack significant histological atypia, all of these mitogenic driver aberrations trigger rapid cell proliferation, but after an initial growth phase, various tumour suppressive mechanisms stably block further growth. In some tumours, additional genomic aberrations may abrogate various tumour suppressive mechanisms, such as cell-cycle arrest, telomere shortening, or DNA damage response. The melanocytes then start to grow in a less organised fashion and may spread to regional lymph nodes, and are termed atypical Spitz tumours. Upon acquisition of even more aberrations, which often activate additional oncogenic pathways or alter cell differentiation, the neoplastic cells become entirely malignant and may colonise and take over distant organs (spitzoid melanoma). The sequential acquisition of genomic aberrations suggests that Spitz tumours represent a continuous biological spectrum, rather than a dichotomy of benign versus malignant, and that tumours with ambiguous histological features (atypical Spitz tumours) might be best classified as low-grade melanocytic tumours. The number of genetic aberrations usually correlates with the degree of histological atypia and explains why existing ancillary genetic techniques, such as array comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) or fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), are usually capable of accurately classifying histologically benign and malignant Spitz tumours, but are not very helpful in the diagnosis of ambiguous melanocytic lesions. Nevertheless, we expect that progress in our understanding of tumour progression will refine the classification of spitzoid melanocytic tumours in the near future. By integrating clinical, pathological, and genetic criteria, distinct tumour subsets will be defined within the heterogeneous group of Spitz tumours, which will eventually lead to improvements in diagnosis, prognosis and therapy.

We isolated a GPNMB-specific scFv clone, G49, from a human synthetic phage-display library. To obtain mutant single-chain variable-fragment antibodies (scFvs) with improved affinity and immunotoxins with increased activity, we subjected G49 to in vitro affinity maturation by a complementarity-determining-region (CDR) random-mutagenesis technique. Using light-chain CDR3 mutagenesis, cell-based panning by phage display, subsequent heavy-chain CDR1 mutagenesis, and flow-cytometric selection by yeast-surface display, we generated the mutant scFv clone 902V, with an overall 11-fold increase in affinity for GPNMB. Clone 902V was further randomized throughout the whole scFv by error-prone PCR, and one mutant, F6V, was selected by yeast-surface display. F6V scFv, differing from 902V by one amino-acid change in the light-chain CDR2, exhibited an affinity for GPNMB of 0.30 nM. The F6V mutant scFv clone was fused with a truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin A to form the immunotoxin F6V-PE38. F6V-PE38 demonstrated significant protein-synthesis-inhibition activity on GPNMB-expressing glioma and malignant melanoma cells (IC(50) = 0.5 ng/ml [8 pM]), a 60-fold improvement over G49 activity, but no cytotoxicity on GPNMB-negative cells. Furthermore, F6V-PE38 exhibited significant antitumor activity against subcutaneous malignant glioma xenografts in two nude-mouse models and a melanoma neoplastic meningitis model in athymic rats. These GPNMB-specific scFv antibodies and immunotoxins hold promise as reagents in targeted therapy for HGGs and other GPNMB-expressing malignancies.",

Inoculation of syngeneic mice with B16alpha vaccine cells triggers immunity to the parental B16 tumor that is mediated by host macrophages, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. Lymph node cells from mice inoculated with irradiated B16alpha vaccine cells, but not with irradiated parental cells, proliferate when cultured in vitro, suggesting long-term in vivo activation of lymphoid cells. Long-term IFN-alpha treatment of B16alpha vaccine cells induced both interleukin-15 (IL-15) mRNA and IL-15 protein. The bulk of the induced IL-15 remained cell associated, either cytoplasmic or associated with the cell membrane. Immunofluorescence microscopy studies showed that the cell-associated IL-15 was broadly distributed throughout the cytoplasm. These observations suggest that long-term IFN-alpha treatment may induce primarily the truncated isoform of IL-15. Vaccination with irradiated B16alpha vaccine cells may promote tumor immunity by releasing high levels of cell-associated IL-15 when spontaneously lysed or directly killed by innate immune cells. The release of accumulated cell-associated IL-15 may then trigger a host T cell response to tumor antigens and cause host development of immunity to the B16 tumor cells.",

One of the late sequelae in STT survivors is the development of a second malignancy. The present study aimed at quantifying risks for second malignancies in patients with STTs, and risks for second STTs after other primary malignancies. Adjusted standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), calculated from the Swedish Family-Cancer Database, were used as a measure of risk. Among 6,671 primary STT patients, a total of 650 second malignancies occurred. Besides second STTs, other cancer sites with an increased SIR were the nervous system, endocrine glands, skin (melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma) and prostate; the risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) was also increased. The overall risk of second malignancies decreased in the following order: fibrosarocma (1.63) > myxosarcoma (1.48) > leiomyosarcoma (1.44) > liposarcoma (1.21). An increased risk of second STTs after primary cancers of the bone, ovary, nervous system, cervix, thyroid gland, skin, endometrium, breast, upper aerodigestive tract, and after Hodgkin disease, NHL and leukemia was also noted. This study showed that the incidence of second primary malignancies in patients with STTs was increased, but the SIRs varied among specific cancer sites. Besides therapeutic effects, the associations between STTs and bone and nervous system tumors suggested that cancer syndromes, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 and Li-Fraumeni syndrome, may partly explain the excesses. The associations of STTs with cancers of the skin (squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma) and with NHL may be related to immunodeficiency.",

We hypothesized that tyrosinase expression in transfected nonmelanotic cells can be used in a gene therapy paradigm of prodrug activation. To verify our hypothesis, we used the following tyrosinase variants: (a) a full-length human tyrosinase clone (T); (b) a mutant lacking the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain (TdeltaC); (c) a mutant lacking the COOH-terminal transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (TdeltaTC); and (d) a fusion with the eight COOH-terminal amino acids of lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 (TL). Expression of mutant and wild-type tyrosinases was induced by transfection in nontumorigenic human cells of epithelial origin (293HEK, MCF-10A adenoma, and NHDF-Ad human dermal fibroblasts) as well as in tumor cells (9L gliosarcoma, MCF7 adenocarcinoma, and HT-1080 fibrosarcoma). When compared with the wild-type tyrosinase transfectants, truncated mutant expression resulted in higher mRNA levels that paralleled higher enzyme activity of the truncated mutants. Two model tyrosinase prodrugs, hydroxyphenyl-propanol (HPP) and N-acetyl-4-S-cysteaminylphenol (NAcSCAP) inhibited proliferation and caused cell death of transfected cells in a dose-dependent manner. Effects of prodrug treatment were compared for tumorigenic cells and their nontumorigenic counterparts. Two truncated mutants (TdeltaC and TdeltaTC) showed low endogenous cytotoxicity and efficiently suppressed proliferation and induced cytotoxicity in transfected tumor cells in the presence of NAcSCAP.

In solid tumors, NO is generally acknowledged to mediate angiogenic responses to several growth factors. This contrasts with conflicting evidence that NO can acutely increase tumor perfusion through local vasodilation or diminish perfusion by preferential relaxation of peripheral vascular beds outside the tumor. Because thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) is an important physiological antagonist of NO in vascular cells, we examined whether, in addition to inhibiting tumor angiogenesis, TSP1 can acutely regulate tumor blood flow. We assessed this activity of TSP1 in the context of perfusion responses to NO as a vasodilator and epinephrine as a vasoconstrictor. Nitric oxide treatment of wild type and TSP1 null mice decreased perfusion of a syngeneic melanoma, whereas epinephrine transiently increased tumor perfusion. Acute vasoactive responses were also independent of the level of tumor-expressed TSP1 in a melanoma xenograft, but recovery of basal perfusion was modulated by TSP1 expression. In contrast, overexpression of truncated TSP1 lacking part of its CD47 binding domain lacked this modulating activity. These data indicate that TSP1 primarily regulates long-term vascular responses in tumors, in part, because the tumor vasculature has a limited capacity to acutely respond to vasoactive agents.",

However, the 50 kDa N-terminal fragment of P-cadherin did not show any influence on cell proliferation in 2D and 3D cell culture.

With respect to an equally important role for amino-truncated p73 splice forms (DeltaTAp73) and DeltaNp73 (summarized as DNp73) in the tumorigenic process, we designed locked nucleic acid (LNA) antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) gapmers against individual species that were complementary to DeltaEx2 and DeltaEx2/3 splice junctions and a region in exon 3B unique for DeltaN' and DeltaN.;Treatment of cancer cells with these ASOs resulted in a strong and specific reduction of tumorigenic p73 transcripts and proteins, importantly, without abolishing the wild-type p73 tumor suppressor form as observed with p73-shRNA. The specific antisense oligonucleotides rescued cells from apoptosis inhibition due to overexpression of their corresponding amino-truncated p73 isoform and decreased tumor cell proliferation. Furthermore, ASO-116 against DeltaEx2/3 coupled to magnetic nanobead polyethyleneimine (MNB/PEI) carriers significantly inhibited malignant melanoma growth, which correlated with a shift in the balance between endogenous TAp73 and DeltaEx2/3 towards apoptotic full-length p73.;Our study demonstrates the successful development of LNA-ASOs that selectively differentiate between the closely related p73 oncoproteins, and provide new tools to further delineate their biological properties in different human malignancies and for therapeutic cancer targeting.",

To this end, a fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain of tissue factor [truncated tissue factor (tTF)] was fused to the peptide GRGDSP selectively targeting alpha(v)-integrins on tumor endothelial cells. tTF-RGD retained its thrombogenic and integrin-binding activity in vitro. In vivo studies in mice bearing human adenocarcinomas (CCL185), melanoma (M21), and fibrosarcoma (HT1080) revealed that i.v. administration of tTF-RGD induced thrombotic occlusion of tumor vessels resulting in tumor growth retardation or regression in all three types of solid tumors. No apparent side effects, such as thrombosis, in other organs or other treatment-related toxicities were observed. Reduced tumor blood flow in tTF-RGD-treated animals as determined by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging underlines the proposed mechanism. In conclusion, we consider RGD peptide-directed delivery of tTF as alternative to previously used antibody fusion proteins. Small peptide-directed delivery of coaguligands does not cause immunologic side effects and those caused by accumulation in the reticuloendothelial system. This is the first report to describe the induction of selective thrombosis in tumor vessels by RGD peptide-directed delivery of tTF, which may be a promising strategy for the treatment of cancer.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Metastasis is a major cause of mortality in cancer patients. However, the mechanisms governing the metastatic process remain elusive, and few accurate biomarkers exist for predicting whether metastasis will occur, something that would be invaluable for guiding therapy. We report here that the carboxypeptidase E gene (CPE) is alternatively spliced in human tumors to yield an N-terminal truncated protein (CPE-ΔN) that drives metastasis. mRNA encoding CPE-ΔN was found to be elevated in human metastatic colon, breast, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines. In HCC cells, cytosolic CPE-ΔN was translocated to the nucleus and interacted with histone deacetylase 1/2 to upregulate expression of the gene encoding neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally downregulated gene 9 (Nedd9)--which has been shown to promote melanoma metastasis. Nedd9 upregulation resulted in enhanced in vitro proliferation and invasion. Quantification of mRNA encoding CPE-ΔN in HCC patient samples predicted intrahepatic metastasis with high sensitivity and specificity, independent of cancer stage. Similarly, high CPE-ΔN mRNA copy numbers in resected pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas (PHEOs/PGLs), rare neuroendocrine tumors, accurately predicted future metastasis or recurrence. Thus, CPE-ΔN induces tumor metastasis and should be investigated as a potentially powerful biomarker for predicting future metastasis and recurrence in HCC and PHEO/PGL patients.",

        "Doc_abstract":"We have identified a new gene, gbp-5, with high homology to the guanylate binding proteins (GBP) belonging to the GTPase superfamily including the ras gene. gbp-5 is transcribed at least into three splicing variants (gbp-5a, -5b, and -5ta) leading to two different proteins (GBP-5a/b, GBP-5ta). GBP-5ta is C-terminally truncated by 97aa and has therefore lost its isoprenylation site. Although RT-PCR results indicated expression of GBP-5 members in selected normal tissues, western blotting using two newly generated antibodies revealed that expression of both proteins is restricted to peripheral blood monocytes with GBP-5ta at lower levels. In contrast, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) tumor tissues (seven of seven) were positive solely for GBP-5ta, and four of four CTCL cell lines expressed both proteins. Eight of nine melanoma cell lines expressed GBP-5a/b and four of nine additionally low levels of GBP-5ta. SEREX retesting using CTCL sera indicated a higher immunogenicity for GBP-5ta (nine of 16) than for GBP-5a/b (two of 11). Treatment of CTCL cell lines with interferon-gamma did not alter protein expression of GBP-5ta or GBP-5a/b. The restricted expression pattern of both GBP-5ta and GBP-5a/b and the pivotal role of many known members of the GTP-binding proteins in proliferation and differentiation suggest possible cancer-related functions of gbp-5.",

The antibody was subcloned as a single chain Fv (scFv) fragment and genetically linked to a truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin A fragment containing the catalytic domains II and III but lacking the receptor binding domain I. Domain I was replaced by the scFv, thus conferring restricted specificity for CD7-positive cells. The bacterially expressed and purified toxin retained binding specificity for CD7-positive cells. It promoted apoptosis in two CD7-positive cell lines derived from T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias, CEM and Jurkat, but not in the CD7-negative B-lymphoid lines REH, Nalm-6, and SEM. Maximum killing in excess of 95% was reached after 96 h in CEM and Jurkat cells with a single dose of 100 ng/ml. Cells treated with a similarly constructed scFv-exotoxin A immunotoxin against melanoma-associated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, an antigen absent from leukemic T cells, remained unaffected. Lysis of target cells occurred via apoptosis as evidenced by staining with Annexin V and specific cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Approximately 20% of leukemic cells from a patient with CD7-positive acute T-cell leukemia kept in long-term primary culture for 30 cell generations were killed within 96 h after treatment with the toxin.

Herein, we applied a multimodality reporter vector to monitor caspase-3 activation indirectly in live cells and tumors of living animals undergoing apoptosis.;A fusion protein (MTF) was constructed by combining three different reporter proteins, red fluorescent protein (mRFP1), firefly luciferase (FL), and HSV1-sr39 truncated thymidine kinase (TK), linked through a caspase-3 recognizable polypeptide linker. After cleavage by caspase-3, a significant gain in mRFP1, FL, and TK activity are observed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and enzyme-based assays. A melanoma cell line (B16F10-mtf-hrl) stably expressing mtf (to measure caspase-3 activation) and hrl-IRES-gfp (to determine the decrease in a number of viable cells) vectors was generated to measure two independent molecular events upon treatment.;Upon induction with 8 mumol/L staurosporine, the fusion protein showed a 2.8-fold increase in FL (P = 0.03), a 1.5-fold increase in TK (P = not significant), and a 2-fold increase in mRFP1 (P = 0.05) activity in 293T cells. Bioluminescence and micropositron emission tomography imaging of the apoptotic B16F10-mtf-hrl tumors showed a 2-fold higher FL activity (897 versus 416) and a 2-fold higher TK activity (10.3 versus 3.87) than control tumors when normalized with RL activity. Using a similar normalization approach, the time kinetics of caspase-3 activation by two protein kinase-C inhibitors was noninvasively monitored in living mice.;This multimodality caspase sensor vector could effectively and noninvasively monitor caspase-3 activation from single live cells to a multicellular tumor environment and, thus, would be a valuable tool for drug screening in preclinical models and future patient cell based therapy.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Tumor progression depends on the support of cells in the microenvironment, and is driven in part by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS can damage DNA, and the repair of damaged DNA is a well-known process involved in tumor initiation and promotion, but the role of DNA repair in tumor progression is not fully understood. In this regard the X-ray cross complementing 1 (XRCC1) protein is known to orchestrate the assembly of repair complexes at sites of DNA single strand breaks either directly or indirectly through repair of damaged bases, largely as the result of ROS-induced damage. XRCC1 polymorphisms have been shown to be associated with increased cancer. It was therefore of interest to investigate the effect of XRCC1 gene mutations on cancer progression. In an attempt to make XRCC1 point mutant mice, we generated a truncated protein (XRCC1tp) by the insertion of a neomycin cassette in intron12 of the XRCC1 gene. This unique finding allowed us to investigate cellular and tumor progression phenotypes in mice associated with expression and function of an altered XRCC1 protein on one allele. XRCC1tp cells showed increased toxicity to MMS, enhanced MMS-induced depletion of NADH suggesting increased PARP activity, and normal functional repair of MMS-induced DNA damage. Six months following treatment with the alkylating carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM) at 10 mg/kg once a week for 6 weeks, XRCC1tp mice had a decrease in average colon tumor volume of 14±3 mm(3) compared to 34±4 mm(3) in WT littermates (p ≤ 0.03, N= 20/genotype). XRCC1tp mice had a 72 per cent decrease in B16 melanoma tumor burden compared to wt littermates. Average tumor volume in transgenic PyMT metastatic breast cancer mice expressing XRCC1tp was 359 cubic mm in PyMT mice expressing XRCC1tp compared to 730 cubic mm in PyMT mice expressing XRCC1wt (p ≤ 0.001, N= 20/genotype). These data suggest that the presence of an XRCC1 truncated protein alters XRCC1 function independent of DNA repair, and is associated with anti-tumor activity.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Virion glycoproteins gB, gD, and gH/gL play essential roles for herpes simplex virus (HSV) entry. The function of gD is to interact with a cognate receptor, and soluble forms of gD block HSV entry by tying up cell surface receptors. Both gB and the nonessential gC interact with cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), promoting viral attachment. However, cells deficient in proteoglycan synthesis can still be infected by HSV. This suggests another function for gB. We found that a soluble truncated form of gB bound saturably to the surface of Vero, A431, HeLa, and BSC-1 cells, L-cells, and a mouse melanoma cell line expressing the gD receptor nectin-1. The HSPG analog heparin completely blocked attachment of the gC ectodomain to Vero cells. In contrast, heparin only partially blocked attachment of soluble gB, leaving 20% of the input gB still bound even at high concentrations of inhibitor. Moreover, heparin treatment removed soluble gC but not gB from the cell surface. These data suggest that a portion of gB binds to cells independently of HSPG. In addition, gB bound to two HSPG-deficient cell lines derived from L-cells. Gro2C cells are deficient in HSPG, and Sog9 cells are deficient in HSPG, as well as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG). To identify particular gB epitopes responsible for HSPG-independent binding, we used a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to gB to block gB binding. Only those gB MAbs that neutralized virus blocked binding of soluble gB to the cells. HSV entry into Gro2C and Sog9 cells was reduced but still detectable relative to the parental L-cells, as previously reported. Importantly, entry into Gro2C cells was blocked by purified forms of either the gD or gB ectodomain. On a molar basis, the extent of inhibition by gB was similar to that seen with gD. Together, these results suggest that soluble gB binds specifically to the surface of different cell types independently of HSPG and CSPG and that by doing so, the protein inhibits entry. The results provide evidence for the existence of a cellular entry receptor for gB.",
