ALCLs comprise approximately 15% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) in children and adolescents and commonly present with advanced systemic disease. Dissimilar from ALCL in adults, ALCL in children is nearly universally anaplastic large cell lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive. Despite the relative rarity of the disease, a great deal of insight into the pathogenesis of ALCL has been learned by researching the essential oncogenic role of ALK. Many different treatment strategies have been utilized with similar event free survival (EFS) rates of 65-75%. This review will provide an overview of the pathology, clinical features, prognostics factors, and treatment for children and adolescents with ALK positive ALCL. ",

No particular risk factor has been clearly identified for ALCL. ALK+ ALCL shows a broad morphologic spectrum, but all cases contain a variable proportion of cells with eccentric, horseshoe- or kidney-shaped nuclei often with an eosinophilic region near the nucleus (hallmark cells). Five morphologic patterns can be recognized. ALK+ ALCL occurs in young subjects (median age ∼35 years), with male predominance, and frequently presents at an advanced stage, with systemic symptoms and extranodal involvement. Near 40% of patients are low risk according to the International Prognostic Index (IPI). Overall, the prognosis of ALK+ ALCL is remarkably better than other T-cell lymphomas. The IPI and the PIT scores in general predict survival in patients with ALK+ ALCL. Standard first-line treatment for ALK+ ALCL consists of doxorubicin-containing polychemotherapy, which is associated with an overall response rate of ∼90%, a 5-year relapse-free survival of ∼60%, and a 5-year overall survival of 70%. Excellent results have been reported with a variety of anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens including CHOP, CHOEP or MACOP-B. Consolidative high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDC/ASCT) has also been evaluated in patients in first remission with favourable results, however, superiority to standard chemotherapy is unproven and this approach remains investigational. Following universally accepted guidelines for the treatment of failed aggressive lymphomas, HDC/ASCT can effectively salvage a proportion of patients with relapsed or refractory ALK+ ALCL. Recently, the development of novel therapies targeting CD30 and ALK appear promising.",

Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma cells express the surface antigen CD30, and more than half express the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) protein. These 2 proteins provide unique therapeutic targets in ALCL. Remission rates in ALCL with combination chemotherapy are approximately 80%, but relapse after first-line therapy is common. Brentuximab vedotin is a US Food and Drug Administration-approved, antibody-drug conjugate that combines an anti-CD30 antibody with monomethylauristatin E, a potent antimicrotubule agent. Response rates to brentuximab vedotin in patients with relapsed/refractory ALK and ALK ALCL have exceeded 80% with frequent complete responses and a median duration of response greater than 1 year. Brentuximab vedotin in combination with chemotherapy is being explored as a first-line therapy in ALCL. Crizotinib is an inhibitor of ALK tyrosine kinase that has been approved for the treatment of ALK non-small cell lung cancer. Successful treatment of ALK ALCL with crizotinib has been reported in pediatric patients and small case series leading to ongoing trials in relapsed/refractory ALCL.

We performed immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization on 73 ALK-negative ALCLs and 32 ALK-positive ALCLs and evaluated the associations among pathology, genetics, and clinical outcome. Chromosomal rearrangements of DUSP22 and TP63 were identified in 30% and 8% of ALK-negative ALCLs, respectively. These rearrangements were mutually exclusive and were absent in ALK-positive ALCLs. Five-year overall survival rates were 85% for ALK-positive ALCLs, 90% for DUSP22-rearranged ALCLs, 17% for TP63-rearranged ALCLs, and 42% for cases lacking all 3 genetic markers (P < .0001).

Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a paradigm for the identification of a disease entity based on morphological observations and immunophenotype, which paved the way for the subsequent discovery of the characteristic cytogenetic abnormality the translocation t(2;5)(p23;q35). In 1994, the t(2;5) was cloned and the NPM-ALK fusion gene generated by this rearrangement was identified. The year 2014 marked the 20th anniversary of this seminal publication by Steve Morris et al. The discovery of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) has allowed the definition of a distinct entity within the clinically and pathologically heterogeneous group of CD30+ lymphomas. The diagnosis of ALK-positive ALCL has become straightforward due to the generation of the reliable monoclonal antibody ALK-1 that also has led to the recognition of the histologic spectrum of the disease. ALK-positive ALCL has evolved in the last 20 years to an exciting model for signal transduction studies and targeted therapy.",

Risk stratification of children with ALCL was, until now, based on clinical parameters. More recently, pathological and biological risk factors have been described in trials applying BFM-type chemotherapy. Histological subtypes containing small-cell or lymphohistiocytic components indicate a high risk of failure. Minimal disseminated disease (MDD) detected by qualitative RT-PCR for NPM-ALK in bone marrow or blood is associated with a relapse risk of 50%. Quantification of MDD and persistent minimal residual disease (MRD) characterize very high risk patients. Serum ALK-autoantibody titres inversely correlate with relapse risk. The combination of MDD and ALK-antibody titre separates both low and very high risk patients from those with standard risk. In relapse, the time of relapse/progression, central nervous system and bone marrow involvement are major risk factors. In conclusion, MDD, MRD, ALK-antibody titres and histological subtype are strong biological risk factors in childhood ALCL. The combination of MDD and ALK-antibody titre may serve for patient stratification in upcoming clinical trials. ",

In human ALCL cells lentiviral-mediated ALK knock-down leads to G(1) cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro and tumor growth inhibition and regression in vivo.

Studies support young age as a strong component of the favorable prognosis of ALK+ ALCL. Until recently, no recurrent translocations were identified in ALK- ALCL. However, emerging data now highlight that ALK- ALCL is genetically and clinically heterogeneous with a subset having either a DUSP22 translocation and a survival rate similar to ALK+ ALCL or a less common P63 translocation, the latter associated with an aggressive course. Anthracycline-based regimens such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) remain the standard first-line treatment choice for systemic ALCL, but in many patients with ALK- ALCL, it is ineffective, and thus it is often followed by consolidative autologous stem cell transplantation.

We previously demonstrated that Jak3 potentiates the activity of NPM-ALK. Jak3 activation is restricted to interleukins that recruit the common gamma chain (gammac) receptor, including IL-9. NPM-ALK was previously shown to promote widespread lymphomas in IL-9 transgenic mice by unknown mechanisms. We hypothesized that IL-9 plays an important role in ALK+ ALCL via Jak3 activation. Our studies demonstrate the expression of IL-9Ralpha and IL-9 in 3 ALK+ ALCL-cell lines and 75% and 83% of primary tumors, respectively. IL-9 was detected in serum-free culture medium harvested from ALK+ ALCL-cell lines, supporting autocrine release of IL-9. Treatment of these cells with an anti-IL-9-neutralizing antibody decreased pJak3 and its kinase activity, along with pStat3 and ALK kinase activity. These effects were associated with decreased cell proliferation and colony formation in soft agar and cell-cycle arrest. Evidence suggests that cell-cycle arrest can be attributed to up-regulation of p21 and down-regulation of Pim-1. Our results illustrate that IL-9/Jak3 signaling plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of ALK+ ALCL and that it represents a potential therapeutic target for treating patients with ALK+ ALCL.",

Their treatment, based on aggressive chemotherapy, is not optimal since ALCL patients can still expect a 30% 2-year relapse rate. Tumor relapses are very aggressive and their underlying mechanisms are unknown. Crizotinib is the most advanced ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor and is already used in clinics to treat ALK-associated cancers. However, crizotinib escape mechanisms have emerged, thus preventing its use in frontline ALCL therapy. The process of autophagy has been proposed as the next target for elimination of the resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In this study, we investigated whether autophagy is activated in ALCL cells submitted to ALK inactivation (using crizotinib or ALK-targeting siRNA). Classical autophagy read-outs such as autophagosome visualization/quantification by electron microscopy and LC3-B marker turn-over assays were used to demonstrate autophagy induction and flux activation upon ALK inactivation. This was demonstrated to have a cytoprotective role on cell viability and clonogenic assays following combined ALK and autophagy inhibition. Altogether, our results suggest that co-treatment with crizotinib and chloroquine (two drugs already used in clinics) could be beneficial for ALK-positive ALCL patients. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Our previous oligonucleotide array studies revealed that ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK(+)ALCL) express high levels of the disheveled proteins (Dvls), a family of proteins that is integral to the Wnt signaling pathways. In this study, we assessed whether the Dvls are important in the pathogenesis of ALK(+)ALCL. By Western blotting, Dvl-2 and Dvl-3 were found to be highly expressed in ALK(+)ALCL cell lines and patient samples. The higher molecular weight forms, consistent with phosphorylated/active Dvl proteins, were observed in these lysates. siRNA knock-down of Dvls did not affect the Wnt canonical pathway, as assessed by the β-catenin protein levels and nuclear localization. In contrast, the same treatment led to changes in the transcriptional activity of NFAT and the phosphorylation status of Src, both of which are known to be regulated by the Wnt non-canonical signaling pathways in other cell types. Coupled with these biochemical changes, there was a significant decrease in cell growth and soft agar colony formation. NPM-ALK, the oncogenic tyrosine kinase characteristic of ALK(+)ALCL, was found to bind to the Dvls and enhance their tyrosine phosphorylation. In conclusion, our data suggest that the Dvls contribute to the pathogenesis of ALK(+)ALCL via signaling in the Wnt non-canonical pathways. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating a physical and functional interaction between the Dvls and an oncogenic tyrosine kinase.",

In children, systemic anaplastic large cell lymphomas often present at advanced clinical stage and harbor translocations involving the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene leading to the expression of chimeric anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-fusion proteins. Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma is regarded as an ALK-negative variant confined to the skin and is part of the spectrum of primary cutaneous CD30-positive T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. Thirty-three of 487 pediatric patients registered within the Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma-99 trial (1999 to 2006) presented with a skin limited CD30-positive lympho-proliferative disorder. In 23 of the 33 patients, material for international histopathological review was available, and the cases were studied for histopathological, immunophenotypical and clinical features as well as for breaks within the ALK gene. Five of 23 cases and one additional case (identified after closure of the trial) expressed ALK-protein. Complete staging excluded any other organ involvement in all children. Expression of ALK proteins was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in all cases and the presence of breaks of the ALK gene was genetically confirmed in 5 evaluable cases. The histopathological and clinical picture of these skin-restricted ALK-positive lymphomas was indistinguishable from that of cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Five children presented with a single skin lesion that was completely resected in 4 and incompletely resected in one. Three of these patients received no further therapy, 2 additional local radiotherapy, and one chemotherapy. All children remain in complete remission with a median follow up of seven years (range 1-8 years). We present 6 pediatric cases of ALK-positive primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphomas.

This included 30 cases of anaplastic lymphoma kinase+ (ALK+), ALCL and 20 cases of anaplastic lymphoma kinase- (ALK-), ALCL. The hospital protocol for treatment of these patients included CHOP chemotherapy regimen in >15 years of age and MCP842 protocol with vinblastine for 1 year in <15 years of age. Event free survival was noted. These outcomes were correlated with ALK status, International Prognostic Index (IPI) score, and stage at presentation.;At a median follow-up of 36 months (range: 6-72 months) ALK- ALCL had a poor outcome. The 3 year event free survival in pediatric ALCL was 66.7%. In adults, this was 60% ALK+ ALCL was 60% and 20% in ALK- ALCL.;Systemic ALCL is an aggressive disease. CD3 + positivity is commonly seen in ALK- ALCL and ALK+, epithelial membrane antigen + positivity is seen in ALK+ ALCL. ALK- ALCL, advanced stage III, IV and high IPI score were associated with poor prognosis. The demographic profile and outcome in our study was similar to the world literature.

Previous studies have reported differences in apoptotic rate and expression levels of apoptosis regulatory proteins between ALK+ and ALK- ALCL. In this study, we assessed for expression of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway proteins cytochrome c, apoptosis protease-activating factor 1, and procaspase 9 in 2 ALK+ ALCL cell lines and 42 ALCL tumors (17 ALK+, 25 ALK-). We used the Karpas 299 and SU-DHL-1 cell lines, and the inhibitors Z-LEHD-FMK (specific for caspase 9) and Boc-D-FMK (general caspase inhibitor) to investigate the role of caspase 9 activation in chemotherapy-induced apoptotic cell death. Caspase 9 activity was significantly increased in Karpas-299 and SU-DHL-1 cells after chemotherapy treatment, but remained as low as control levels with addition of either caspase inhibitor. Both caspase inhibitors rescued a substantial fraction of Karpas 299 and SU-DHL-1 cells from drug-induced cell death. In ALCL tumors, expression of cytochrome c, apoptosis protease-activating factor 1, and procaspase 9 was also assessed and correlated with apoptotic rate and activated caspase 3 levels. Cytochrome c was expressed in all 13 (100%) ALK+ and 18 (95%) of 19 ALK- ALCL tumors. Apoptosis protease-activating factor 1 was detected in 14 (88%) of 16 ALK+ and 19 (79%) of 24 ALK- ALCL tumors. Procaspase 9 was expressed in 5 (30%) of 17 ALK+ and 2 (8%) of 25 ALK- ALCL tumors (P = .09). In the entire study group (ALK+ and ALK- ALCL), procaspase 9 expression levels significantly correlated with apoptotic rate (P = .02) and activated caspase 3 levels (P = .05). This correlation could not be shown in the ALK+ or ALK- ALCL subgroups, presumably because of the small sample size. In conclusion, chemotherapy-induced cell death in ALK+ ALCL cells involves the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, and apoptosome function may be an important determinant of apoptosis in ALCL tumors.",

However, recent studies suggest that crizotinib-resistance mutations may emerge in ALCL patients. In the present study, we analyzed ALK kinase domain mutational status of 36 paediatric ALCL patients at diagnosis to identify point mutations and gene aberrations that could impact on NPM-ALK gene expression, activity and sensitivity to small-molecule inhibitors. Amplicon ultra-deep sequencing of ALK kinase domain detected 2 single point mutations, R335Q and R291Q, in 2 cases, 2 common deletions of exon 23 and 25 in all the patients, and 7 splicing-related INDELs in a variable number of them. The functional impact of missense mutations and INDELs was evaluated. Point mutations were shown to affect protein kinase activity, signalling output and drug sensitivity. INDELs, instead, generated kinase-dead variants with dominant negative effect on NPM-ALK kinase, in virtue of their capacity of forming non-functional heterocomplexes. Consistently, when co-expressed, INDELs increased crizotinib inhibitory activity on NPM-ALK signal processing, as demonstrated by the significant reduction of STAT3 phosphorylation. Functional changes in ALK kinase activity induced by both point mutations and structural rearrangements were resolved by molecular modelling and dynamic simulation analysis, providing novel insights into ALK kinase domain folding and regulation. Therefore, these data suggest that NPM-ALK pre-therapeutic mutations may be found at low frequency in ALCL patients. These mutations occur randomly within the ALK kinase domain and affect protein activity, while preserving responsiveness to crizotinib. ",

In this study, we investigated the effect of the cdk inhibitor flavopiridol in anaplastic large cell lymphomas, in which unrestrained proliferation depends on NPM-ALK tyrosine kinase activity.;Effects of flavopiridol were examined in ALK-positive and -negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma cells by means of immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analyses to assess cdk expression and activity, quantitative real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to measure drug-induced changes in transcription, and FACS analyses to monitor changes in proliferation and survival.;Treatment with flavopiridol resulted in growth inhibition of anaplastic large cell lymphoma cells, along with accumulation of subG(1) cells and disappearance of S phase without cell cycle arrest. Consistent with flavopiridol activity, phosphorylation at cdk2, cdk4, cdk9 sites on RB and RNA polymerase II was inhibited. This correlated with induction of cell death through rapid mitochondrial damage, inhibition of DNA synthesis, and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins and transcripts. Notably, flavopiridol was less active in ALK-positive cells, as apoptosis was observed at higher concentrations and later time points, and resistance to treatment was observed in cells maintaining NPM-ALK signaling. NPM-ALK inhibition affected proliferation but not survival of anaplastic large cell lym-phoma cells, whereas it resulted in a dramatic increase in apoptosis when combined with flavopiridol.;This work provides the first demonstration that targeting cdk is effective against anaplastic large cell lymphoma cells, and proves the critical role of NPM-ALK in the regulation of responsiveness of tumor cells with cdk dysregulation.",

Among 70% to 80% of ALK(+) anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL) are caused by the aberrant oncogenic fusion protein NPM-ALK. Crizotinib was the first clinically relevant ALK inhibitor, now approved for the treatment of late-stage and metastatic cases of lung cancer. However, patients frequently develop drug resistance to Crizotinib, mainly due to the appearance of point mutations located in the ALK kinase domain. Fortunately, other inhibitors are available and in clinical trial, suggesting the potential for second-line therapies to overcome Crizotinib resistance. This study focuses on the ongoing phase I/II trial small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) AP26113, by Ariad Pharmaceuticals, which targets both ALK and EGFR. Two NPM-ALK(+) human cell lines, KARPAS-299 and SUP-M2, were grown in the presence of increasing concentrations of AP26113, and eight lines were selected that demonstrated resistance. All lines show IC50 values higher (130 to 1,000-fold) than the parental line. Mechanistically, KARPAS-299 populations resistant to AP26113 show NPM-ALK overexpression, whereas SUP-M2-resistant cells harbor several point mutations spanning the entire ALK kinase domain. In particular, amino acid substitutions: L1196M, S1206C, the double F1174V+L1198F and L1122V+L1196M mutations were identified. The knowledge of the possible appearance of new clinically relevant mechanisms of drug resistance is a useful tool for the management of new TKI-resistant cases.;This work defines reliable ALCL model systems of AP26113 resistance and provides a valuable tool in the management of all cases of relapse upon NPM-ALK-targeted therapy.",

Given that survivin is a target of the STAT3 signaling pathway and STAT3 is activated in ALCL, survivin expression was also correlated with STAT3 activation.;Survivin was expressed in 34 tumors (55%) and did not correlate with ALK. A significant association between survivin expression and STAT3 activation was observed (P =.007, Fisher's exact test). For the ALK-positive group, the 5-year failure-free survival (FFS) was 34% for patients with survivin-positive ALCL compared with 100% for patients with survivin-negative ALCL (P =.009, log-rank test). For the ALK-negative group, the 5-year FFS was 46% for patients with survivin-positive tumors compared with 89% for patients with survivin-negative tumors (P =.03, log-rank test). Overall survival was similarly worse for patients with survivin-positive tumors in both the ALK-positive and ALK-negative groups. Furthermore, multivariate analysis confirmed the independent prognostic value of survivin expression, along with age older than 60 years and Ann Arbor stage III or IV.;Survivin is expressed in approximately half of ALCL tumors and independently predicts unfavorable clinical outcome. Modulation of survivin expression or function may provide a novel target for experimental therapy in patients with ALCL.",

Here we demonstrate that HSP90 is overexpressed in primary and cultured ALK-positive and ALK-negative ALCL cells, and we evaluate the potential role of the small molecule inhibitor of HSP90, 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) in treating ALCL.;The antiproliferative effect of 17-AAG-cultured cells was determined by MTS assay.

Expression of HSP90 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, and molecular changes were determined by Western blot.;Treatment of cultured ALCL cells with 17-AAG induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis, irrespective of ALK expression. At the molecular level, 17-AAG induced degradation of ALK and Akt proteins, dephosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and degraded the cell-cycle regulatory protein cyclin D1 and its cyclin-dependent kinases, CDK4 and CDK6, but had a differential effect on p27 and p53 proteins.

To study the function of ALK, an inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA) system was stably introduced into cultured human ALCL cells. Inducing shRNA expression in the generated cells resulted in cellular ALK gene silencing and led to inactivation of multiple signaling pathways and growth arrest. Interestingly, a combination of ALK gene silencing with U0126, a kinase inhibitor specific for the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 pathway, resulted in an augmented reduction in cellular JunB expression. Functional studies indicated that combining ALK gene silencing with U0126 treatment provided a synergistic growth inhibition, which occurred faster and was more profound than with either treatment alone. This synergistic effect was also observed when measuring cell proliferation, apoptosis, and in vitro cell colony formation. Importantly, the combination of ALK gene silencing and U0126 had a prolonged inhibitory effect, preventing recovery of ALCL cell growth even after treatments were removed. Moreover, this synergistic inhibitory effect was confirmed in vivo using a mouse model with xenografted ALCL tumors.

Here we investigated the therapeutic potential of a novel bromodomain inhibitor, OTX015/MK-8628 in ALK-positive ALCLs.The effects of OTX015 on a panel of ALK+ ALCL cell lines was evaluated in terms of proliferation, cell cycle and downstream signaling, including gene expression profiling analyses. Synergy was tested with combination targeted therapies.Bromodomain inhibition with OTX015 led primarily to ALCL cell cycle arrest in a dose-dependent manner, along with downregulation of MYC and its downstream regulated genes. MYC overexpression did not compensate this OTX015-mediated phenotype. Transcriptomic analysis of OTX015-treated ALCL cells identified a gene signature common to various hematologic malignancies treated with bromodomain inhibitors, notably large cell lymphoma. OTX015-modulated genes included transcription factors (E2F2, NFKBIZ, FOS, JUNB, ID1, HOXA5 and HOXC6), members of multiple signaling pathways (ITK, PRKCH, and MKNK2), and histones (clusters 1-3). Combination of OTX015 with the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib led to cell cycle arrest then cell death, and combination with suboptimal doses of the ALK inhibitor CEP28122 caused cell cycle arrest. When OTX015 was associated with GANT61, a selective GLI1/2 inhibitor, C1156Y-resistant ALK ALCL growth was impaired.These findings support OTX015 clinical trials in refractory ALCL in combination with inhibitors of interleukin-2-inducible kinase or SHH/GLI1.",

Here we show that ALCLs of both subtypes are addicted to IRF4 signaling, as knockdown of IRF4 by RNA interference was toxic to ALCL cell lines in vitro and in ALCL xenograft mouse models in vivo. Gene expression profiling after IRF4 knockdown demonstrated a significant downregulation of a variety of known MYC target genes. Furthermore, our analyses revealed that MYC is a primary target of IRF4, identifying a novel regulatory mechanism of MYC expression and its target gene network in ALCL. MYC, itself, is essential for ALCL survival, as both knockdown of MYC and pharmacologic inhibition of MYC signaling were toxic to ALCL cell lines. Collectively, our results demonstrate that ALCLs are dependent on IRF4 and MYC signaling and that MYC may represent a promising target for future therapies. ",

We report here a case of anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive endobronchial ALCL, that was initially thought to be primary lung cancer. A 68-year-old woman presented with hemoptysis, dyspnea, and upper respiratory symptoms persisting since 1 month. The hemoptysis and and bronchial obstruction lead to respiratory failure, prompting emergency radiotherapy and steroid treatment based on the probable diagnosis of lung cancer, although a biopsy did not confirm malignancy. Following treatment, her symptoms resolved completely. Chest computed tomography scan performed 8 months later showed increased and enlarged intra-abdominal lymph nodes, suggesting lymphoma. At that time, a lymph node biopsy was recommended, but the patient refused and was lost to follow up. Sixteen months later, the patient revisited the emergency department, complaining of persistent abdominal pain since several months. A laparoscopic intra-abdominal lymph node biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of ALCL. ",

In our study, we retrospectively analyzed 92 patients with S-ALCL from the Peking University Lymphoma Center for clinical and molecular prognostic factors to make clear the role of ALK and other prognostic factors in Han Chinese S-ALCL.;The majority of Chinese S-ALCL patients were young male patients (median age 26, male/female ratio 1.7) and the median age was younger than previous reports regardless of ALK expression status. The only statistically significant different clinical characteristic in S-ALCL between ALK positive (ALK+) and ALK negative (ALK-) was age, with a younger median age of 22 for ALK+ compared with 30 for ALK-. However, when pediatric patients (≤ 18) were excluded, there was no age difference between ALK+ and ALK-. The groups did not differ in the proportion of males, those with clinical stage III/IV (49 vs 51%) or those with extranodal disease (53 vs 59%). Of 73 evaluable patients, the 3-year and 5-year survival rates were 60% and 47%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that three factors: advanced stage III/IV, lack of expression of ALK, and high Ki-67 expression, were associated with treatment failure in patients with S-ALCL. However, ALK expression correlated with improved survival only in patients younger than 14 years, while not in adult patients. In multivariate analysis, only clinical stage was an independent prognostic factor for survival. Expressions of Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) and B-cell lymphoma 2 protein (BCL-2) correlated with the expression of ALK, but they did not have prognostic significance. High Ki-67 expression was also a poor prognostic factor.;Our results show that ALK expression alone is not sufficient to determine the outcome of ALCL and other prognostic factors must be considered.

Essential defining features comprise of a proliferation of large lymphoid cells with strong expression of the cytokine receptor CD30 and a characteristic growth pattern. Using molecular and clinical criteria three entities of ALC-lymphoma have been identified: primary systemic anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive ALC-lymphoma, primary systemic ALK-negative ALC-lymphoma and primary cutaneous ALC-lymphoma. The ALK expression in the primary systemic ALC-lymphoma entity is caused by chromosomal translocations, most commonly t(2;5), and can nowadays be reliably detected by immuno-histology. ALK-positive ALC-lymphoma predominantly affects young male patients and if treated with chemotherapy has a favourable prognosis. They show a broad morphological spectrum, with the \"common type\", the small cell variant and the lymphohistiocytic variant being most commonly observed. The knowledge of the existence of these variants is essential in establishing the correct diagnosis. ALK-negative ALC-lymphomas occur in older patients, equally affecting both genders and have an unfavorable prognosis. The morphology and the immuno-phenotype of primary cutaneous ALC-lymphoma shows an overlap with that of lymphomatoid papulosis. Both diseases have an excellent prognosis and secondary systemic dissemination is only rarely observed. The ALC-lymphomas described above derive from T cells and are generally accepted as biological entities. In contrast, large B-cell-lymphomas with anaplastic morphology are now believed not to represent an own entity but a morphologic variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Malignant lymphomas with morphological features of both Hodgkin- and ALC-lymphoma have formerly been classified as ALCL Hodgkin-like. Recent immuno-histological analysis of these cases however suggests that ALCL Hodgkin-like does not represent an own lymphoma entity. Most of these cases are likely to be examples of tumor cell rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma, while a minority of these cases appear to fall either into the category of ALK-positive or ALK-negative ALC-lymphoma.",

The large tumor cells expressed ALK immunoreactivity with a cytoplasmic and nuclear pattern, whereas some of the small cells showed only a nuclear-restricted pattern of staining.

A comprehensive review of the 71 reported cases of breast implant associated ALCL (iALCL) is presented indicating the apparent risk factors and main characteristics of this rare cancer. The average patient is 50 years of age and most cases present in the capsule surrounding the implant as part of the periprosthetic fluid or the capsule itself on average at 10 years post-surgery suggesting that iALCL is a late complication. The absolute risk is low ranging from 1:500,000 to 1:3,000,000 patients with breast implants per year. The majority of cases are ALK-negative, yet are associated with silicone-coated implants suggestive of the mechanism of tumorigenesis which is discussed in relation to chronic inflammation, immunogenicity of the implants and sub-clinical infection. In particular, capsulotomy alone seems to be sufficient for the treatment of many cases suggesting the implants provide the biological stimulus whereas others require further treatment including chemo- and radiotherapy although reported cases remain too low to recommend a therapeutic approach.

In this study, we investigated the cellular, biologic, and proteomic changes occurring in ALK-positive ALCL cells in response to GA treatment.

However, there is no general consensus on the optimal therapy for relapsed or refractory ALCL.

Following two treatment cycles in 21-day intervals, the lymphoma showed considerable regression based on imaging diagnostics and no evidence of vital lymphoma in a subsequent biopsy. We did not observe any increase in toxicity; in particular, polyneuropathy and febrile neutropenia were not observed. In summary, we report that the antibody-drug conjugate brentuximab vedotin and a classical regimen used for aggressive lymphoma, DHAP, could be combined as salvage therapy in a case of refractory ALK-positive ALCL.

This translocation leads to the expression of a hybrid protein consisting of the N-terminal portion of nucleophosmin (NPM) and the intracellular domain of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). NPM-ALK possesses a constitutive tyrosine kinase activity responsible for its oncogenic property through activation of downstream effectors such as phospholipase C gamma (PLC-gamma) and the type IA phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Here, we show that the Src-kinases, particularly pp60(c-src), associate with and are activated by NPM-ALK expression in various cells, and in cell lines established from patients with ALCL. The kinase activity and the tyrosine 418 of NPM-ALK are required for its association with Src-kinases. Y418F mutation of NPM-ALK impaired its association with Src-kinases and strongly reduced the proliferation rate of Ba/F3 cells. In agreement, Src-kinase inhibitors or pp60(c-src) siRNA significantly decreased the proliferation rate of NPM-ALK-positive ALCL cell lines. Moreover, using active or inactive forms of pp60(c-src) and NPM-ALK, we provide evidence that NPM-ALK is a potential substrate of pp60(c-src).

However, the course in patients with breast implants seems to be unusually benign compared with other systemic ALCL. The purpose of this study was to identify and analyze recently published cases of breast implant-associated ALCL, with an emphasis on diagnosis, staging, treatment, and outcomes.;The authors conducted a systematic literature review of reported cases of ALCL in patients with breast implants. Publications were identified with a search algorithm and forward searches. Case-based data were abstracted independently and reconciled by multiple investigators.;Of 248 identified articles, only 102 were relevant to breast implant-associated ALCL, and 27 were included in this study. Fifty-four cases of ALCL in patients with breast implants were identified. Detailed clinical information was lacking in many cases. Most presented with a seroma (76 percent), and approximately half were associated with the capsule (48 percent). Most presented as stage IE (61 percent). All but one case were ALK-negative. Most received chemotherapy (57 percent) and radiation therapy (48 percent), and 11 percent received stem cell transplants. Approximately one-quarter recurred, and 9 percent died.;Since the publication of guidance related to breast implant-associated ALCL in 2010, a number of cases have been reported. Despite the typically benign course, many of the cases have been treated with radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. Increasing awareness of this disease entity among clinicians would be helpful, along with standardizing an approach to diagnosis, staging, and treatment.;Risk, V.",

NPM-ALK activates the antiapoptotic phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathway, which plays a critical role in cell survival and apoptosis. Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway has been considered as a therapeutic target for cancer where PI3K/Akt activation is a causative factor. Genistein, a natural isoflavonoid found in soy products, has been shown to inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in a wide variety of cell lines. Here, we demonstrated that treatment of two t(2;5) ALCL cell lines, SUDHL-1 and Karpas299, with genistein induced apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Concurrently, these cells exhibited a decrease in Akt protein levels and subsequent downregulation of Akt activity (Akt phosphorylation). Furthermore, genistein treatment induced mitochondrial membrane potential change, caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage. From these results, we conclude that inhibition of the Akt signaling pathway and induction of apoptosis by genistein could be used as a new treatment modality for the prevention and/or treatment of t(2;5) ALCL and other hematopoietic malignancies.",

        "Doc_abstract":"In vitro studies suggest that resistance to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis might explain poor response to therapy in fatal cases. Actual execution of apoptosis depends on proper functioning of effector caspases, particularly caspase 3, and on the expression levels of apoptosis-regulating proteins, including Bcl-2 and the recently identified granzyme B- specific protease inhibitor 9 (PI9). Thus, high levels of caspase 3 activation should reflect proper functioning of the apoptosis pathways, resulting in chemotherapy-sensitive neoplastic cells and a favorable prognosis. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying numbers of tumor cells positive for active caspase 3, Bcl-2, and PI9, respectively, in pretreatment biopsies of systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) patients and by comparing these numbers with clinical outcome. Activation of caspase 3 in more than 5% of the tumor cells was strongly correlated with a highly favorable outcome. High numbers of Bcl-2- and PI9-positive tumor cells were found to predict unfavorable prognosis. This prognostic effect was strongly related to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) status: ALK-positive ALCL had significantly higher levels of active caspase 3, while high expression of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and PI9 was almost completely restricted to ALK-negative cases. In conclusion, high numbers of active caspase 3-positive tumor cells predict a highly favorable prognosis in systemic ALCL patients. Poor prognosis is strongly related to high numbers of Bcl-2- and PI9-positive neoplastic cells. These data support the notion that a favorable response to chemotherapy depends on an intact apoptosis cascade. Moreover, these data indicate that differences in prognosis between ALK-positive and ALK-negative ALCL might be explained by differences in expression of apoptosis-inhibiting proteins.",

Among PTCL, ALK-negative ALCL was the most frequent and all of them were associated with breast implants.;Since 2010, all i-ALCL cases were collected from different institutions through Lymphopath. Immuno-morphologic features, molecular data and clinical outcome of 19 i-ALCLs have been retrospectively analyzed.;The median age of the patients was 61 years and the median length between breast implant and i-ALCL was 9 years. Most implants were silicone-filled and textured. Implant removal was performed in 17 out of 19 patients with additional treatment based on mostly CHOP or CHOP-like chemotherapy regimens (n = 10/19) or irradiation (n = 1/19). CHOP alone or ABVD following radiation without implant removal have been given in two patients. The two clinical presentations, i.e. effusion and less frequently tumor mass correlated with distinct histopathologic features: in situ i-ALCL (anaplastic cell proliferation confined to the fibrous capsule) and infiltrative i-ALCL (pleomorphic cells massively infiltrating adjacent tissue with eosinophils and sometimes Reed-Sternberg-like cells mimicking Hodgkin lymphoma). Malignant cells were CD30-positive, showed a variable staining for EMA and were ALK negative. Most cases had a cytotoxic T-cell immunophenotype with variable T-cell antigen loss and pSTAT3 nuclear expression. T-cell receptor genes were clonally rearranged in 13 out of 13 tested cases. After 18 months of median follow-up, the 2-year overall survival for in situ and infiltrative i-ALCL was 100% and 52.5%, respectively.;In situ i-ALCLs have an indolent clinical course and generally remain free of disease after implant removal. However, infiltrative i-ALCLs could have a more aggressive clinical course that might require additional therapy to implant removal.",

To minimize potential cytotoxicity, the individual components of the nanocomplexes were used at sub-cytotoxic concentrations. Dynamic light scattering showed that formed nanocomplexes were ~140 nm in diameter and remained stable for more than 24 hours in culture medium. Cell binding assays revealed that CD30 aptamer probes selectively targeted nanocomplexes to ALCL cells, and confocal fluorescence microscopy confirmed intracellular delivery of the nanocomplex. Cell transfection analysis showed that nanocomplexes silenced genes in an ALCL cell type-selective fashion. Moreover, exposure of ALCL cells to nanocomplexes carrying both ALK siRNAs and CD30 RNA aptamers specifically silenced ALK gene expression, leading to growth arrest and apoptosis.;Taken together, our findings indicate that this functional RNA nanocomplex is both tumor cell type-selective and cancer gene-specific for ALCL cells.",

Because aberrant CD30 expression was also observed in the T-cell lymphoma derived from lineage-specific NPM-ALK transgenic mice, we tested the hypothesis that there might be a functional relationship between the two neoplastic-related proteins: NPM-ALK and CD30. In this study, we used the RNA interference method to modulate NPM-ALK protein expression in ALCL-derived, t(2;5)-positive Karpas 299 cells. We observed decreased CD30 expression when NPM-ALK was repressed. Further analysis suggested that JunB functioned as the mediator of NPM-ALK-derived CD30 transcriptional regulation. The NPM-ALK-repressed cells, which had low CD30 expression, were characterized with lower cell proliferation compared with cells in the control group, suggesting that altered CD30 expression may correlate to NPM-ALK-mediated tumor cell growth inhibition.

The clinical features, imaging, pathological findings, treatment outcomes, and prognosis, are described. Successful treatment outcomes were achieved after 6 cycles of CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) chemotherapy followed by involved field radiotherapy of 54 Gy/27f. The patient was disease-free after follow-up for 65 months.;Our study found that chemotherapy (such as CHOP) is recognized as the first-line regimen for primary ALCL of the lung. For patients with dyspnea caused by a mass blocking the main bronchus, chemo-radiotherapy may be a reasonable therapeutic option. The prognosis is better for patients with positive ALK staining. CD56(+), age older than 60 years, Ann Arbor stage III or IV, survivin expression, PS>2, and high serum LDH level and IPI scores are the poor prognostic factors of ALCL.",

Information on clinical findings and treatment outcome of ALK+ lymphoma is still limited, and no data are available concerning the value of the International Prognostic Index when applied to this homogeneous disease entity. To clarify these issues, a recently developed monoclonal antibody ALKc (directed against the cytoplasmic portion of ALK) was used to detect expression of the ALK protein in paraffin-embedded biopsies from 96 primary, systemic T/null anaplastic large-cell lymphomas, and the ALK staining pattern was correlated with morphological features, clinical findings, risk factors (as defined by the International Prognostic Index), and outcome in 78 patients (53 ALK+ and 25 ALK-). Strong cytoplasmic and/or nuclear ALK positivity was detected in 58 of 96 ALCL cases (60.4%), and it was associated with a morphological spectrum (common type, 82.7%; giant cell, 3.5%; lymphohistiocytic, 8. 6%; and small cell, 5.2%) that reflected the ratio of large anaplastic elements (usually showing cytoplasmic and nuclear ALK positivity) to small neoplastic cells (usually characterized by nucleus-restricted ALK expression). Clinically, ALK+ lymphoma mostly occurred in children and young adults (mean age, 22.01 +/- 10.87 years) with a male predominance (male/female [M/F] ratio, 3.0) that was particularly striking in the second-third decades of life (M/F ratio, 6.5) and usually presented as an aggressive, stage III-IV disease, frequently associated with systemic symptoms (75%) and extranodal involvement (60%), especially skin (21%), bone (17%), and soft tissues (17%). As compared with ALK+ lymphoma, ALK- cases occurred in older individuals (mean age, 43.33 +/- 16.15 years) and showed a lower M/F ratio (0.9) as well as lower incidence of stage III-IV disease and extranodal involvement at presentation. Overall survival of ALK+ lymphoma was far better than that of ALK- anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (71% +/- 6% v 15% +/- 11%, respectively). However, within the good prognostic category of ALK+ lymphoma, survival was 94% +/- 5% for the low/low intermediate risk group (age-adjusted International Prognostic Index, 0 to 1) and 41% +/- 12% for the high/high intermediate risk group (age-adjusted International Prognostic Index, >/=2). Multivariate analysis identified ALK expression and the International Prognostic Index as independent variables that were able to predict survival among T/null primary, systemic anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. Thus, we suggest that such parameters should be taken into consideration for the design of future clinical trials.",

PF-2341066 was recently identified as a p.o. bioavailable, small-molecule inhibitor of the catalytic activity of c-Met kinase and the NPM-ALK fusion protein. PF-2341066 also potently inhibited NPM-ALK phosphorylation in Karpas299 or SU-DHL-1 ALCL cells (mean IC(50) value, 24 nmol/L). In biochemical and cellular screens, PF-2341066 was shown to be selective for c-Met and ALK at pharmacologically relevant concentrations across a panel of >120 diverse kinases. PF-2341066 potently inhibited cell proliferation, which was associated with G(1)-S-phase cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis in ALK-positive ALCL cells (IC(50) values, approximately 30 nmol/L) but not ALK-negative lymphoma cells. The induction of apoptosis was confirmed using terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase-mediated nick-end labeling and Annexin V staining (IC(50) values, 25-50 nmol/L). P.o. administration of PF-2341066 to severe combined immunodeficient-Beige mice bearing Karpas299 ALCL tumor xenografts resulted in dose-dependent antitumor efficacy with complete regression of all tumors at the 100 mg/kg/d dose within 15 days of initial compound administration. A strong correlation was observed between antitumor response and inhibition of NPM-ALK phosphorylation and induction of apoptosis in tumor tissue. In addition, inhibition of key NPM-ALK signaling mediators, including phospholipase C-gamma, signal transducers and activators of transcription 3, extracellular signal-regulated kinases, and Akt by PF-2341066 were observed at concentrations or dose levels, which correlated with inhibition of NPM-ALK phosphorylation and function.

Here, we focused our attention on the anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), where the oncogenic fusion protein NPM-ALK, responsible for 70% to 80% of cases, represents an ideal crizotinib target. We selected and characterized 2 human NPM-ALK+ ALCL cell lines, KARPAS-299 and SUP-M2, able to survive and proliferate at different crizotinib concentrations. Sequencing of ALK kinase domain revealed that a single mutation became predominant at high crizotinib doses in each cell line, namely L1196Q and I1171N in Karpas-299 and SUP-M2 cells, respectively. These mutations also conferred resistance to crizotinib in Ba/F3 cells expressing human NPM-ALK. The resistant cell populations, as well as mutated Ba/F3 cells, were characterized for sensitivity to two additional ALK inhibitors: the dual ALK/EGFR inhibitor AP26113 and NVP-TAE684. While L1196Q-positive cell lines were sensitive to both inhibitors, cells carrying I1171N substitution showed cross-resistance to all ALK inhibitors tested.

The patient was referred to the Dental Clinic of PUCPR complaining of a lobulated nodule on the gingiva of his upper central incisors. The presence of advanced chronic periodontitis and dental plaque raised suspicion for a benignancy. An excisional biopsy was performed, and large pleomorphic cells with an abundant cytoplasm, sometimes containing prominent nucleoli and \"Hallmark\" cells, were observed through hematoxylin and eosin staining. The tumor cells showed strong CD30 expression, EMA, Ki-67, and LCA, and negative stain for p80(NPM/ALK), CKAE1/AE3, CD20, CD3, CD56, and CD15. The final diagnosis was ALCL (ALK-negative). Further laboratory tests revealed positivity for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The patient was submitted to chemotherapy, but four months after diagnosis, the patient died due to pneumonia and respiratory failure. Oral anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a rare disorder. Only 5 cases involving the gingiva have been reported, and to our knowledge, this is the first case reported of the ALCL, which mimicked a hyperplastic benignancy as the first clinical manifestation of AIDS.

Among 267 patients included in the French paediatric ALCL database between 1989 and 2012, nine (3%) were described as having cytologically detectable circulating tumour cells. Clinical features combined fever (8/9), nodal and extra-nodal disease (9/9), including hepato-splenic (9/9) and lung involvement (7/9). The level of hyperleucocytosis ranged from 30 to 120 × 10(9) /l, with 12-90% of tumour cells. Diagnosis relied on a lymph node biopsy, with a positive ALK+ antibody immunostain in all nine cases, a T-cell immunophenotype in 7/9 cases and CD3 positivity in 5/9 cases. A small cell component was present in 6/9 cases. Only four patients achieved a complete remission with first-line therapy and 3/4 relapsed. Four patients are alive with a median follow-up of 31 months, two of them after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and five patients died, two of them of disease. In conclusion, ALCL with leukaemic presentation is very unusual and should be considered as high-risk lymphoma requiring new therapeutic strategies. The respective role of new agents and allogeneic HSCT in first complete remission still has to be assessed. ",

In such cancers, the oncogenic activity of ALK stimulates signaling pathways that induce cell transformation and promote tumor growth. In search for common pathways activated by oncogenic ALK across different tumors types, we found that hypoxia pathways were significantly enriched in ALK-rearranged ALCL and NSCLC, as compared with other types of T-cell lymphoma or EGFR- and K-RAS-mutated NSCLC, respectively. Consistently, in both ALCL and NSCLC, we found that under hypoxic conditions, ALK directly regulated the abundance of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF), which are key players of the hypoxia response in normal tissues and cancers. In ALCL, the upregulation of HIF1α and HIF2α in hypoxic conditions required ALK activity and its downstream signaling proteins STAT3 and C/EBPβ. In vivo, ALK regulated VEGFA production and tumor angiogenesis in ALCL and NSCLC, and the treatment with the anti-VEGFA antibody bevacizumab strongly impaired ALCL growth in mouse xenografts. Finally, HIF2α, but not HIF1α, was required for ALCL growth in vivo whereas the growth and metastasis potential of ALK-rearranged NSCLC required both HIF1α and HIF2α. In conclusion, we uncovered an ALK-specific regulation of the hypoxia response across different ALK(+) tumor types and propose HIFs as a powerful specific therapeutic target in ALK-rearranged ALCL and NSCLC.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Abnormal expression of constitutively active anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) chimeric proteins in the pathogenesis of anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) is well established. Recent studies with small molecule kinase inhibitors have provided solid proof-of-concept validation that inhibition of ALK is sufficient to attenuate the growth and proliferation of ALK (+) ALCL cells. In this study, several missense mutants of ALK in the phosphate anchor and gatekeeper regions were generated and their kinase activity was measured. NPM-ALK L182M, L182V, and L256M mutants displayed kinase activity in cells comparable to or higher than that of NPM-ALK wild type (WT) and rendered BaF3 cells into IL-3-independent growth, while NPM-ALK L182R, L256R, L256V, L256P, and L256Q displayed much weaker or little kinase activity in cells. Similar kinase activities were obtained with corresponding GST-ALK mutants with in vitro kinase assays. With regard to inhibitor response, NPM-ALK L182M and L182V exhibited sensitivity to a fused pyrrolocarbazole (FP)-derived ALK inhibitor comparable to that of NPM-ALK WT but were dramatically less sensitive to a diaminopyrimidine (DAP)-derived ALK inhibitor. On the other hand, NPM-ALK L256M exhibited >30-fold lower sensitivity to both FP-derived and DAP-derived ALK inhibitors. The growth inhibition and cytotoxicity of BaF3/NPM-ALK mutant cells induced by ALK inhibitors were consistent with inhibition of cellular NPM-ALK autophosphorylation. In a mouse survival model, treatment with the orally bioavailable DAP-ALK inhibitor substantially extended the survival of the mice inoculated with BaF3/NPM-ALK WT cells but not those inoculated with BaF3/NPM-ALK L256M cells. Binding of ALK inhibitors to ALK WT and mutants was analyzed using ALK homology models. In summary, several potential active ALK mutants were identified, and our data indicate that some of these mutants are resistant to select small molecule ALK inhibitors. Further characterization of these mutants may help to identify and develop potent ALK inhibitors active against both WT and resistant mutants of ALK.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL) are characterized by the expression of a chimeric protein, NPM-ALK, which originates from fusion of the nucleophosmin (NPM) and the membrane receptor anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) genes. The NPM-ALK kinase, on dimerization, shows phosphotransferase activity and, through its interaction with various ALK-adapter proteins, induces cell transformation and increases cell proliferation in vitro. The chaperones heat shock proteins 90 (Hsp90) and 70 (Hsp70) play a critical role in the folding and maturation of several oncogenic protein kinases, and perturbation of Hsp90 structure affects the stability and degradation of Hsp90- and Hsp70-bound substrates. This process is triggered by benzoquinone ansamycin antibiotics, Hsp90-binding small molecules. We have studied the effect of 17-allylamino,17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), a benzoquinone ansamycin, on NPM-ALK steady-state level in ALCL cells. Treatment with 17-AAG decreased NPM-ALK expression and phosphorylation, thus impairing its association with phospholipase C-gamma, Src homology 2 domain-containing protein (Shc), growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). We also observed that NPM-ALK associates with Hsp90, and incubation with 17-AAG disrupts this complex without affecting Hsp90 expression. As shown previously for other Hsp90 client proteins, destabilization of the Hsp90/NPM-ALK complex induced by 17-AAG resulted in increased binding of the chimeric protein to Hsp70, which is known to affect protein degradation. Hsp/NPM-ALK complex formation appears to be independent of NPM sequences, because we were unable to coimmunoprecipitate NPM with either Hsp90 or Hsp70. Similar to NPM-ALK, the exogenously expressed variant fusion protein TPR-ALK showed decreased expression and phosphorylation after 17-AAG treatment, suggesting that the effect of 17-AAG on ALK chimeric proteins depends on the ALK portion and not on the partner protein moiety. Our data demonstrate that NPM-ALK cell content is determined by its interaction with Hsp90 and Hsp70, and suggest that the alteration of such associations can interfere with NPM-ALK function in ALCL cells.",

Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a rare T-cell lymphoma typically seen in children and young adults with the breast being one of the least common locations. There are a total of eleven cases of primary ALCL of the breast described in the literature. Eight of these cases occurred in proximity to breast implants, four in relation to silicone breast implant and three in relation to saline filled breast implant with three out of the eight implant related cases having previous history of breast cancer treated surgically. Adjuvant postoperative chemotherapy is given in only one case. Secondary hematological malignancies after breast cancer chemotherapy have been reported in literature. However in contrast to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the association between lymphoma and administration of chemotherapy has never been clearly demonstrated.;In this report we present a case of primary ALCL of the breast arising in reconstruction mammoplasty capsule of saline filled breast implant after radical mastectomy for infiltrating ductal carcinoma followed by postoperative chemotherapy twelve years ago.;Primary ALK negative ALCL arising at the site of saline filled breast implant is rare.

NPM-ALK transgenic (Tg) mice were born with the expected mendelian distribution, normal lymphoid organs, and a normal number and proportion of helper and suppressor T cells. However, after a short period of latency, all NPM-ALK Tg mice developed malignant lymphoproliferative disorders (mean survival, 18 weeks). NPM-ALK Tg thymic lymphomas displayed a T-cell phenotype characteristic of immature thymocytes and frequently coexpressed surface CD30. A subset of the NPM-ALK Tg mice also developed clonal B-cell plasma cell neoplasms. These tumors arose in peripheral lymphoid organs (plasmacytomas) or within the bone marrow and often led to peripheral neuropathies and limb paralysis.

Despite constitutive activation of the kinase through gene alterations, such as chromosomal translocation, gene amplification or mutation, treatments with kinase inhibitors invariably lead to the development of resistance. Aiming to develop new tools for ALK targeting, we took advantage of our previous demonstration identifying ALK as a dependence receptor, implying that in the absence of ligand the kinase-inactive ALK triggers or enhances apoptosis. Here, we synthesized peptides mimicking the proapoptotic domain of ALK and investigated their biological effects on tumor cells. We found that an ALK-derived peptide of 36 amino acids (P36) was cytotoxic for ALK-positive anaplastic large-cell lymphoma and neuroblastoma cell lines. In contrast, ALK-negative tumor cells and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells were insensitive to P36. The cytotoxic effect was due to caspase-dependent apoptosis and required N-myristoylation of the peptide. Two P36-derived shorter peptides as well as a cyclic peptide also induced apoptosis. Surface plasmon resonance and mass spectrometry analysis of P36-interacting proteins from two responsive cell lines, Cost lymphoma and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma, uncovered partners that could involve p53-dependent signaling and pre-mRNA splicing. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown of p53 rescued these cells from P36-induced apoptosis. Finally, we observed that a treatment combining P36 with the ALK-specific inhibitor crizotinib resulted in additive cytotoxicity. Therefore, ALK-derived peptides could represent a novel targeted therapy for ALK-positive tumors. ",

ATIC phosphorylation was documented in cell lines and primary tumors carrying ALK proteins and other tyrosine kinases, including TPR-Met and wild type c-Met. Functional analyses revealed that ALK-mediated ATIC phosphorylation enhanced its enzymatic activity, dampening the methotrexate-mediated transformylase activity inhibition. These findings demonstrate that proteomic approaches in well-controlled experimental settings allow the definition of informative proteomic profiles and the discovery of novel ALK downstream players that contribute to the maintenance of the neoplastic phenotype.

Crizotinib is a first-in-class ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor with significant activity in ALK-positive NSCLC that received accelerated US Food and Drug Administration approval for treatment of ALK-positive NSCLC in 2011, just 4 years after identification of ALK rearrangements in this setting. Subsequently, two phase III trials have shown crizotinib to have a tolerable toxicity profile and to be superior to standard chemotherapy for the first- or second-line treatment of advanced ALK-positive lung cancer and numerous countries have approved its use. Despite initial responses, acquired resistance to crizotinib invariably leads to disease progression. Mechanisms of resistance have been described to include ALK tyrosine kinase mutations, activation of bypass signalling pathways and pharmacokinetic failure of crizotinib.

        "Doc_abstract":"The Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) is an orphan receptor tyrosine kinase, which undergoes post-translational N-linked glycosylation. The catalytic domain of ALK was originally identified in the t(2;5) translocation that produces the unglycosylated oncogenic protein NPM-ALK, which occurs in Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL). Recently, both germline and somatic activating missense mutations of ALK have been identified in neuroblastoma (NB), a pediatric cancer arising from neural crest cells. Moreover, we previously reported that ALK expression is significantly upregulated in advanced/metastatic NB. We hypothesized that ALK function may depend on N-linked glycosylation and that disruption of this post-translational modification would impair ALK activation, regardless the presence of either gene mutations or overexpression.;We employed tunicamycin to inhibit N-linked glycosylation. The following ALK-positive NB cell lines were used: SH-SY5Y and KELLY (ALK mutation F1174L), UKF-NB3 (ALK mutation R1275Q) and NB1 (ALK amplification). As a control, we used the NB cell lines LA1-5S and NB5 (no ALK expression), and the ALCL cell line SU-DHL1 (NPM-ALK).;Tunicamycin treatment of ALK-positive NB cells resulted in a hypoglycosylated ALK band and in decreased amounts of mature full size receptor. Concomitantly, we observed a marked reduction of mature ALK phosphorylation. On the contrary, tunicamycin had no effects on NPM-ALK phosphorylation in SU-DHL1 cells. Moreover, phosphorylation levels of ALK downstream effectors (AKT, ERK1/2, STAT3) were clearly impaired only in ALK mutated/amplified NB cell lines, whereas no significant reduction was observed in both ALK-negative and NPM-ALK-positive cell lines. Furthermore, inhibition of N-linked glycosylation considerably impaired cell viability only of ALK mutated/amplified NB cells. Finally, the cleavage of the Poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase (PARP) suggested that apoptotic pathways may be involved in cell death.;In this study we showed that inhibition of N-linked glycosylation affects ALK phosphorylation and disrupts downstream pro-survival signaling, indicating that inhibition of this post-translational modification may be a promising therapeutic approach. However, as tunicamycin is not a likely candidate for clinical use other approaches to alter N-linked glycosylation need to be explored. Future studies will assess whether the efficacy in inhibiting ALK activity might be enhanced by the combination of ALK specific small molecule and N-linked glycosylation inhibitors.",

        "Doc_abstract":"ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase, initially discovered as part of the NPM-ALK fusion protein, resulting from a chromosomal rearrangement frequently associated with anaplastic large cell lymphomas. The native ALK protein is normally expressed in the developing and, at a weaker level, adult nervous system. We recently demonstrated that ALK is a novel dependence receptor. As such, in the absence of ligand, the ALK receptor is kinase inactive and its expression results in enhanced apoptosis, whereas kinase activation, due to a ligand or constitutive as in NPM-ALK, decreases apoptosis. Unligated/kinase unactivated ALK receptor facilitates apoptosis via its own cleavage by caspases, a phenomenon allowing the exposure of a proapoptotic juxta-membrane intra-cellular domain. This review summarizes the biological significance of the ALK receptor in cancer and development, in perspective with its dependence receptor function. The dual function of ALK in the physiology of development is illustrated in the visual system of Drosophila. In this part of the nervous system, ALK in the presence of ligand appears essential for axonal guidance, whereas in the absence of ligand, ALK expression can lead to developmental neuronal apoptosis. ALK is also found expressed in neural crest-derived tumors such as human neuroblastomas or glioblastomas but its role is not fully elucidated. However, an excessive or constitutive ALK tyrosine kinase activation can lead to deregulation of cell proliferation and survival, therefore to human cancers such as lymphomas and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors. Our observations could have important implications in the therapy of ALK-positive tumors harboring the chimeric or wild type ALK protein.",

In addition, we showed that this model could be used to precisely assess tumor growth inhibition upon ALK chemical inactivation. As proof of principle, we used the general tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A to inhibit ALK oncoprotein activity. As expected, herbimycin A treatment reduced tumor growth as assessed both by tumor volume measurement and bioluminescent imaging.

Lymphomas develop in two transgenic lines in which the Vav promoter regulates NPM-ALK expression. The transgenic line with higher copy number displays an early-onset phenotype in which all mice succumb to aggressive lymph node tumours with intestinal involvement, whereas the second line displays late-onset tumour development in the spleen and/or liver. Lymphomas from both lines are phenotypically distinct and display B-lineage characteristics with aberrant coexpression of myeloid markers.

The aim was to determine if subsets recognized by the REAL/WHO classification have different prognoses. Outcome was compared to 86 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) transplanted during 1986-2000. The 3-year overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) were 69% and 50%. Patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) had a better 3-year OS compared to those with non-ALCL histology (86% vs. 47%, P=0.0122). Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)- positive ALCL patients had a superior EFS compared to ALK-negative ALCL (100% vs. 0; P=0.0228). Patients with cutaneous ALCL (ALK-negative) relapsed, but had an indolent course after SCT. Low International Prognostic Index score at relapse predicted for a better 3-year OS (85% vs. 34%, P=0.0238). When compared to DLBCL, patients with ALCL had a superior OS (86% vs. 36%, P=0.0034) and patients with non-ALCL had a comparable OS. ALCL histology confers better survival compared to non-ALCL and DLBCL histologies. ALK-positive ALCL is associated with the best EFS after relapse with HDC and SCT.

Historically, the two molecular alterations have been viewed as mutually exclusive, but recent identified cases suggest otherwise. In this report, we describe cases of lung cancer with concurrent EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement and identify their clinical characteristics. Non-small cell lung cancer patients with multiple molecular alterations were retrospectively analyzed from an academic referral center from 2011-2013. An additional review was conducted of reported cases with dual alterations. Four cases of NSCLC with alterations in both EGFR and ALK were identified and evaluated with 16 published cases for a total of 20 cases. The age of patients ranged from 37 to 77 years. Nine patients were never smokers. The disease control rates in patients treated with EGFR inhibitors and ALK inhibitors were 46% (6/13) and 71% (5/7), respectively. This series highlights the importance of comprehensive molecular profiling of newly diagnosed lung cancer, as NSCLC may be driven by concurrent molecular alterations. EGFR- and ALK-targeted therapies appear to have modest activity in patients with tumors possessing both alterations. Dual-altered NSCLC patients may have distinct clinical characteristics warranting further study. Combination targeted therapy or novel multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors may prove important in these patients, though necessary studies remain ongoing. ",

The huge variety of currently evolving targeted treatment approaches would benefit from tools for early prediction of response or resistance. We used various ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) cell lines to evaluate two inhibitors, the HSP90 inhibitor NVP-AUY922, and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, both of which have shown to interfere with ALK-dependent oncogenic signal transduction. Their therapeutic effect was determined in vitro by MTT assay, [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)- and [(18)F]fluorothymidine (FLT)-uptake, and by biochemical analysis of ALK-induced signaling. Micro-FDG- and FLT-positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies in immunodeficient mice bearing ALCL xenotransplants were carried out with the cell lines SUDHL-1 and Karpas299 to assess early treatment response to NVP-AUY922 or everolimus in vivo. SUDHL-1 cells showed sensitivity to both inhibitors in vitro. Importantly, we detected a significant reduction of FLT-uptake in SUDHL-1 bearing animals using both inhibitors compared with baseline as early as 5 days after initiation of targeted therapy. Immunostaining showed a decrease in Ki-67 and an increase in cleaved caspase-3 staining. In contrast, FDG-uptake did not significantly decrease at early time points. Karpas299 xenotransplants, which are resistant to NVP-AUY922 and sensitive to everolimus treatment, showed an increase of mean FLT-uptake on day 2 after administration of NVP-AUY299, but a significant reduction in FLT-uptake upon everolimus treatment.

Upon ligand binding to the extracellular domain, the receptor undergoes dimerization and subsequent autophosphorylation of the intracellular kinase domain. In recent years, ALK inhibitors have been developed for cancer treatment. These inhibitors target ALK activity and show effectiveness in ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer.

We evaluated ALK status in NSCLC with a novel ALK mRNA test based on the break-apart FISH concept, which we called break-apart transcript (BAT) test. ALK5' and ALK3' transcript patterns were established with qPCR for ALK-expressing controls including fusion-negative neuroblastomas, as well as fusion-positive anaplastic large cell lymphomas and NSCLC. The BAT test was evaluated on 271 RNA samples from routinely processed paraffin NSCLC tissues. Test results were compared with ALK FISH (n=121), immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis (n=86), and automated quantitative analysis (AQUA, n=83). On the basis of the nonoverlapping ALK BAT patterns in ALK-expressing controls (P<0.0001), 8/174 adenocarcinomas (4.6%) among 259 informative NSCLC were predicted as fusion positive. Overall concordance for paired method results was high (94.1% to 98.8%) but mainly concerned negative prediction because of the limited availability of positive-matched cases. Tumors with 100% cytoplasmic IHC staining of any intensity (n=3) were positive for AQUA, FISH, and BAT test; tumors with lower IHC positivity and different staining patterns were AQUA-negative. Upon multiple reevaluations, ALK gene status was considered as originally misinterpreted by FISH in 3/121 cases (2.5%). Tumors with >4 ALK gene copies were associated with longer overall survival upon first-line chemotherapy. In conclusion, application of the ALK BAT test on routinely processed NSCLC tissues yields the same fusion partner independent information as ALK break-apart FISH but is more robust and cost-effective. The BAT concept may be considered for the development of further drug-predictive translocation tests. ",

We report nine cases of large cell hematopoietic neoplasms in which the neoplastic cells co-expressed CD30 and CD15, and had immunophenotypic and morphologic features of T-cell lymphoproliferative process. The average age of the CD15-positive group was 61.9 years; 6 cases occurred in men and 3 in women. The tumors were located in lymph nodes in 8 cases, and in liver in 1 case. Two cases expressed ALK protein. There were no statistically significant differences in phenotypic parameters between the CD15-positive and CD15-negative neoplasms (p>0.05). However, the CD15-positive group appeared to show a minor trend toward less positivity for EMA (44% versus 72%), ALK protein (22% versus 51%), and CD45RO (33.3% versus 83.3%, p=0.07), when compared to the typical CD15-negative neoplasms. In summary, although the co-expression of CD30 and CD15 is typical for classical HL, it may be also present in a subset of peripheral T-cell neoplasms including ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Combined and sensible use of morphology and a broad immunophenotypic panel in cases with limited material and/or those with overlapping histologic patterns will best discriminate between HL and ALCL.

        "Doc_abstract":"The anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK) is a gene on chromosome 2p23 that has expression restricted to the brain, testis and small intestine but is not expressed in normal lymphoid tissue. It has similarity to the insulin receptor subfamily of kinases and is emerging as having increased pathologic and potential therapeutic importance in malignant disease. This gene was originally established as being implicated in the pathogenesis of rare diseases including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour (IMT) and ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma, which is a subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Recently the number of diseases in which ALK is implicated in their pathogenesis has increased. In 2007, an inversion of chromosome 2 involving ALK and a fusion partner gene in a subset of non-small cell lung cancer was discovered. In 2008, publications emerged implicating ALK in familial and sporadic cases of neuroblastoma, a childhood cancer of the sympatho-adrenal system. Chromosomal abnormalities involving ALK are translocations, amplifications or mutations. Chromosomal translocations are the longest recognised ALK genetic abnormality. When translocations occur a fusion gene is created between ALK and a gene partner. This has been described in ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma in which ALK is fused to NPM (nucleolar protein gene) and in non-small cell lung cancer where ALK is fused to EML4 (Echinoderm microtubule-associated protein 4). The most frequently described partner genes in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour are tropomyosin 3/4 (TMP3/4), however in IMTs a diversity of ALK fusion partners have been found, with the ability to homodimerise a common characteristic. Point mutations and amplification of the ALK gene occur in the childhood cancer neuroblastoma. Therapeutic targeting of ALK fusion genes using tyrosine kinase inhibition, vaccination using an ALK specific antigen and treatment using viral vectors for RNAi are emerging potential therapeutic possibilities.",

A few small-molecule inhibitors of ALK kinase activity have been described in the recent years, some of which are currently undergoing clinical evaluation.;Literature was searched for all ALK inhibitors that have entered clinical investigation, including published research articles and meeting abstracts. Data on pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of crizotinib, as well as preliminary clinical data for second-generation compounds, are reviewed. The issue of drug resistance is discussed.;Understanding the specific genetic aberration that causes cancer development and progression allows major advances in cancer therapy. Along the same way shown by imatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia, compounds that selectively target ALK are bringing a revolution in the treatment of ALK-positive tumors.

The cell lines were assessed using multiple methods (RT-PCR, flow cytometry, and Western blot). c-Kit expression was also immunohistochemically assessed in 168 CD30+ lymphomas including 87 classical Hodgkin's disease, 63 anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, and 15 cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. We also studied 18 cases of lymphomatoid papulosis, a CD30+ lesion closely related to cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. Neither c-kit mRNA nor protein was detected in any of the cell lines assessed. Furthermore, treatment with imatinib did not inhibit proliferation of cell lines in vitro. Using immunohistochemistry, only one of 183 (0.5%) lesions was positive for c-kit, the positive case being an ALK-negative anaplastic large-cell lymphoma.

Problems with PTCL include their rarity, representing usually 10-15% of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in the Western Hemisphere, morphologic heterogeneity, and lack of immunophenotypic markers for clonality. Additionally, their clinical behavior is variable and may not correlate with morphology. Dr. Kinney gives a general overview of the diagnosis of PTCL and NK cell neoplasms. Emphasis will be placed on extranodal T cell and natural killer (NK) cell lymphomas such as hepatosplenic lymphoma, subcutaneous panniculitis-like lymphoma and nasal/nasal type T/NK-cell lymphoma. The use of ALK gene regulation in the classification of anaplastic large cell lymphoma is also reviewed. Dr. Loughran describes current understanding of the pathogenesis of large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia. The discussion focuses on LGL leukemia as an instructive model of dysregulated apoptosis causing both malignant and autoimmune disease. Current management options and mechanisms of therapeutic response are also described. Dr. Greer addresses whether PTCL should be treated differently from the more common diffuse large B cell lymphomas. He discusses the therapeutic options for anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), from a conservative approach for primary cutaneous ALCL to combination chemotherapy for the highly chemosensitive ALCL expressing anaplastic lymphoma kinase. He reviews therapy options for the extranodal subtypes of PTCL by drawing from series in adults, pediatrics, dermatology, and the Far East.",

Historically, PTCL was treated like aggressive B-cell lymphomas, and to date cyclophosphamide, prednisone, vincristine, and doxorubicin (CHOP) remains the most commonly used regimen, despite disappointing results. Given the poor outcomes of PTCL patients, a number of studies have investigated the role of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDT/ASCT) in the upfront setting, with different results. However, there are no prospective randomized trials, and the clinical benefit appears to be restricted to patients who achieve an objective response after induction chemotherapy. Nevertheless, with the exception of low-risk ALK+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma, in light of the available data, HDT/ASCT for consolidation should be recommended for patients deemed eligible. The results of phase II trials showed that allogeneic stem cell transplantation can cure some relapsed/refractory patients, and few studies have evaluated this strategy in the frontline setting. With the availability of recently approved new drugs as well as new targeted agents under investigation, a number of ongoing studies are testing novel combinations aiming to improve rate and durability of responses to induction chemotherapy.",

Targeting hsp90 by the ansamycins geldanamycin and 17-allyl-amino-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) promotes degradation of several proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, including oncogenic Raf, v-Src, erbB2, and BCR-ABL. We have previously shown that 17-AAG prevents hsp90/NPM-ALK complex formation and fosters NPM-ALK turnover, perhaps through its association with the hsp70 chaperone. Here, we show that inhibition of the proteasome activity by the potent and specific compound pyrazylcarbonyl-Phe-Leu-boronate (PS-341) blocks 17-AAG-induced down-regulation of NPM-ALK, which becomes detergent-insoluble and relocates into ubiquitin-rich perinuclear vesicles that represent aggregated polyubiquitinated forms of the protein. Kinase activity was not mandatory for proteasomal degradation of NPM-ALK, because kinase-defective NPM-ALK was even more rapidly degraded upon 17-AAG treatment. Prolonged exposure to the proteasome inhibitor was shown to trigger caspase-3-mediated apoptosis in proliferating ALCL cells at nanomolar concentrations. However, we verified that the accumulation of detergent-insoluble NPM-ALK in ALCL cells was not a spurious consequence of PS341-committed apoptosis, because caspase inhibitors prevented poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage whereas they did not affect partitioning of aggregated NPM-ALK. In line with these observations, the carboxyl hsp70-interacting ubiquitin ligase (CHIP), was shown to increase basal ubiquitination and turnover of NPM-ALK kinase, supporting a mechanism whereby NPM-ALK proceeds rapidly toward hsp70-assisted ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation, when chaperoning activity of hsp90 is prohibited by 17-AAG.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are a rare and heterogeneous group of disorders that, for the most part, are associated with a very poor prognosis. The standard therapy for PTCLs is CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) or a comparable CHOP-like regimen that incorporates anthracyclines. With the exception of anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK(+) ALCL), the cure rate for PTCLs with CHOP is low, and limited evidence suggests that anthracyclines do not improve the prognosis. However, there is no compelling evidence that any other regimen or approach is superior. It remains challenging to compare alternative therapies or treatment strategies with CHOP because the majority of data are retrospective and include diverse patient populations. Recently, prospective studies have been initiated exclusively for PTCL, and in some, select histologic subtypes are evaluated in an effort to remove heterogeneity. Encouragingly, there have been several new therapies emerging with activity in PTCLs and exciting novel combinations under consideration that will hopefully move the field forward and improve outcome in this challenging group of diseases.",

In addition, cases of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) were divided into classical, small cell, and primary cutaneous subtypes, and immunostaining for the anaplastic large-cell kinase (ALK) protein was performed on all cases of ALCL. Clinical features, response to therapy and survival were abstracted. Ninety-two cases of PTCL with adequate clinical information were retrieved.

These disorders comprise a spectrum of clinically benign lymphomatoidpapulosis (LyP) and primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL). The peak incidence of LyP is in the 5th decade of life, and the incidence of primary cutaneous ALCL peaks in the 6th decade, but children are also affected. Both LyP and primary cutaneous ALCL have an excellent prognosis. However, LyP is associated with development of malignant lymphoma (mycosis fungoides, Hodgkin lymphoma, or ALCL) in 20% of cases, and also with an increased risk of non-lymphoid cancers. The diagnosis of LyP is difficult and often delayed. Primary cutaneous ALCL must be distinguished from secondary skin lesions in systemic ALCL, which confer a poor prognosis. Correlation of clinical findings with histopathology and immunopathology (stains for ALK kinase, epithelial membrane antigen, and cutaneous lymphocyte antigen) are important to achieve a correct diagnosis. When a diagnosis of CD30+ PCLPD is established, minimal clinical staging is required. Low-dose methotrexate (10-25 mg weekly) is the most effective therapy for PCLPD but is usually reserved for aggressive cases of LyP and multifocal lesions of cutaneous ALCL Many patients with LyP can be followed expectantly, with special attention to changes in character of the skin lesions or development of lymphadenopathy.

In general, the ALK catalytic domain is rearranged and fused to a dimerization domain encoded by an unrelated gene. Less frequently, full-length ALK is activated by point mutations. The common theme is unregulated firing of ALK downstream signalling, leading to uncontrolled cell division and increased cell survival. ALK-driven tumors can be treated with Crizotinib, an orally available dual ALK/MET inhibitor, currently approved for advanced ALK-positive NSCLCs. Crizotinib-treated patients achieve high response rates, with an excellent toxicity profile. However, drug-resistant disease often develops, particularly in NSCLC patients. The processes leading to drug resistance include both ALK-dependent (point mutations or gene amplification), as well as ALK-independent mechanisms, which are here briefly discussed. Recently, Ceritinib has been approved for Crizotinib-refractory NSCLC, further extending patients' survival, but resistance again emerged. Novel ALK kinase inhibitors are currently under clinical development, showing great promise for improved efficacy in drug-resistance disease. It is opinion of the author that drug-resistance is likely to arise under any treatment, due to intrinsic heterogeneity and adaptability of cancer. To prevent or delay this phenomenon, we need to treat less advanced disease, with drugs that are rapidly effective in order not to allow enough time for tumor evolution, and we want to have more and more drugs with non-overlapping resistance profiles, for subsequent lines of targeted therapy. Finally, the use of drug combinations may exponentially decrease the chances of resistance. ",

CD30 signaling activates NF-kappaB in cell lines derived from cutaneous ALCL but not anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive systemic ALCL in which growth arrest occurs through cell cycle inhibitor p21WAF1/Cip1. Other likely biomarkers of disease progression include differential expression of Bcl-2, fascin, cutaneous lymphocyte antigen, and T-cell receptor clonality. These may lead to improved classification, diagnoses, and therapeutic targets.;The current clinicopathologic classification of CD30+ cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders is insufficient. Incorporating genetic and molecular criteria would better define the borders between benign/ malignant and aggressive/nonaggressive disorders.",

Serious complications at presentation due to tumor lysis syndrome or local tumor effects are commonly observed. Thus, a rapid diagnosis with the least invasive procedure enabling the initiation of early and specific therapy is necessary to diminish early fatality or persistent impairment. In 56 centrally registered patients with NHL, cytomorphologic analyses (FAB criteria) of May-Grünwald-Giemsa-stained touch imprints or malignant effusions and flow cytometric immunophenotyping (EGIL criteria) of fresh cell suspensions with a standardized panel of monoclonal antibodies were performed. The authors identified 23 patients with Burkitt lymphoma by the combination of FAB L3 morphology and a mature B-cell phenotype and 22 patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma by FAB L1/L2 morphology and a T-/B-cell precursor phenotype. They also found 11 patients with large cell lymphomas, 3 of them with anaplastic large cell lymphoma (T-cell phenotype; NPM/ALK-positive). In the remaining 8 patients diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was suspected by the combined use of cytologic and immunophenotypic findings (mature B-cell phenotype). In all cases with available solid tumor material (n = 42/56) the preliminary diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology. Burkitt lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma, and, in a few cases, some large cell lymphomas could be classified reliably by cytomorphology and immunophenotyping of freshly obtained tumor cell material, enabling an early start of specific lymphoma treatment.",

A dose escalation of lenalidomide (days 1-21, q28) was planned using a 3 + 3 design.

Here we discuss our general approach to the treatment of the most common PTCLs. Based on the best data currently available, which include retrospective analyses and phase 2 prospective studies, our approach has involved cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone-based therapy followed by consolidation in first remission with autologous stem cell transplant. This treatment strategy likely improves the outcome for patients compared with historical series; however, progression-free survival rates remain disappointing, ranging from 40% to 50%. This is currently an exciting time in the treatment of PTCL due to the advent of recently approved drugs as well as new targeted agents currently under investigation. In addition, gene expression profiling is allowing for a better understanding of underlying disease biology, improved diagnostic accuracy, and prognostication in PTCL. As a result, over the next few years, we expect a significant shift in our management of these diseases with a move toward more individualized therapy leading to improved outcomes.",

This article aims to evaluate ALK, EBV, and HHV-8 expression in children with IMT and to correlate our findings with clinical features.;Sixteen children (range, 1-15 years) who had surgery for IMT between 1978 and 2003 were evaluated retrospectively. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissues were stained for HHV-8 and ALK with immunohistochemistry.

Five children were treated with steroids and/or antibiotics before surgery, with no substantial result. IMT was excised totally in all but 2 cases. Four patients presented aggressive IMT with recurrence or metastasis requiring new surgery. ALK was positive in 3 (18.8%) cases and EBV in 1 pulmonary and 1 bladder tumor, all of them without recurrence or metastasis. None of the cases were positive for HHV-8.

We conducted a retrospective analysis of PTCL patients treated at the University of Pennsylvania between 1/1/2007 and 12/31/2014. Patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma, concurrent B cell lymphomas, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK-positive ALCL) were excluded from the study. We compared progression-free survival for patients who underwent ASCT in CR1 following CHOP-like induction regimens and patients who underwent active observation during CR1. 48 patients met all inclusion and exclusion criteria and underwent either active observation (28 patients) or consolidative ASCT (20 patients) in CR1. The 1-year cumulative incidence of relapse in the observation and ASCT groups was 50% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 30-67%) and 46% (95% CI: 23-67%), respectively (P = 0.55).

AGL is associated with high risk for lymphoma, especially PTCL. Autoimmunity likely contributes to this risk. Lymphoma developed with or without metreleptin, suggesting metreleptin does not directly cause lymphoma development; a theoretical role of metreleptin in lymphoma progression remains possible.

Newer-generation inhibitors may help overcome resistance mutations, and inhibitor combinations can target parallel pathways, but durable benefit to patients remains elusive in most clinical scenarios. Now, recent studies suggest a third approach may be available in some cases-exploitation of oncogene overexpression that may arise to promote resistance. Here, we discuss the importance of maintaining oncogenic signaling at \"just-right\" levels in cells, with too much signaling, or oncogene overdose, being potentially as detrimental as too little. This is highlighted in particular by recent studies of mutant-BRAF in melanoma and the fusion kinase nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK) in anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Oncogene overdose may be exploitable to prolong tumor control through intermittent dosing in some cases, and studies of acute lymphoid leukemias suggest that it may be specifically pharmacologically inducible.

The discovery of activating kinase domain mutations of the full-length ALK receptor as the major cause of hereditary neuroblastoma, and that somatically acquired mutations and amplification events often drive the malignant process in a subset of sporadic tumors, has established ALK as a tractable molecular target across histologically diverse tumors in which ALK is a critical mediator of oncogenesis. We are now uncovering the reexpression of this developmentally regulated protein in a broader subset of pediatric cancers, providing therapeutic targeting opportunities for diseases with shared molecular etiology.

In situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) RNA (EBER 1) was strongly positive in the periportal infiltrating lymphocytes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies revealed female (XX) cells in the tumor cells and male (XY) in the surrounding hepatic parenchymal cells. The patient developed severe lactic acidosis, oliguric renal failure and expired on day+44. Both donor and patient had positive IgG serologies for EBV VCA and EBNA pretransplant. The donor also had a positive IgM titer for EBV VCA in the pretransplant specimen. The LPD may have been related to the intense immunosuppression of the preparative therapy and the presence of recent EBV infection in the donor.",

Microscopically, the lesion was composed of numerous centroblasts infiltrating both the dermis and the subcutaneous tissue. Phenotypic investigations showed expression of CD20, CD79a, and bcl-2 protein by neoplastic cells. In addition, these cells were CD5 positive. No expression of anaplastic large cell lymphoma kinase (ALK), CD10, CD23, CD30, CD43, bcl-6, cyclin D1, p53 or p16INK4a could be seen.

No rearrangement of the genes coding for the Ig heavy chain, t(14;18) or t(11;14) chromosome translocations, or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genomic sequences could be found. The tumor was classified as stage IE and was first cured by complete surgical excision. Nineteen months later, a recurrence was noted in the right elbow area.

Compared to B-cell lymphomas, PTCL more frequently involve extranodal sites and have a worse prognosis. Because of their usually indolent course, primary cutaneous T/NK-cell lymphomas should be distinguished from the other PTCL. Staging of PTCL is done according to the Ann Arbor staging system. The International Prognostic Index, established for aggressive B-cell lymphomas, has also proved relevant for PTCL. Standard therapy for PTCL has not been defined, yet. First line anthracycline-based chemotherapy brings about long-term remissions in 15 to 42% of patients. Apart from (ALK-positive) anaplastic large cell lymphoma it thus gives poorer results than those obtained in patients with aggressive B-cell lymphomas. Data for high-dosage therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation (autoSCT) for relapsing and refractory PTCL are similar to those reported for aggressive B-cell lymphomas. Thus this treatment seems to constitute a sensible salvage strategy. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation following reduced conditioning regimens has also given promising results in patients with relapse. However, the impact of high-dosage strategies and the implementation of newer agents, such as alemtuzumab, in first-line treatment are still uncertain.

Efforts have been made to combine novel techniques with cytology and immunochemistry in order to more precisely define these entities.

Regarding anaplastic large cell lymphoma, low expression T-cell receptor signalling and high STAT3 target signatures have been associated with the ALK-positive subgroup. Gene expression profiling differentiates angioblastic T-cell lymphoma from other T-cell malignancies, suggests that the normal counterpart of lymphoma cells are follicular helper T cells, and supports the involvement of vascular endothelial growth factor deregulation in its physiopathology. In peripheral T-cell lymphoma unspecified, gene profiling suggests the normal counterpart of tumour cells are activated CD4(+) or CD8(+) T-lymphocytes, delineates prognostic groups depending on the proliferative signature, and suggests therapeutic options aimed at regulating nuclear factor-kappaB and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha phosphorylation. Gene expression profiling of primary cutaneous T cell lymphomas highlighted the importance of abnormal methylation patterns, suggested a pivotal role for JUNB/AP-1, and defined a predictive model for response to interferon-alpha.

Disease relapse post auto-HCT is best managed on a clinical trial. In the absence of an investigational protocol, the choice of salvage therapies should take into account patient performance status, eligibility for an allo-HCT, and surface CD30 expression. CD30-directed therapies or aggressive salvage regimens can be used as a bridge to allo-HCT in medically fit patients. In the elderly or more infirm patients, single-agent therapies could be offered, aiming at palliation. Similarly, relapse after an allo-HCT is not uncommon and is a real challenge. Reduction in ongoing immune suppression or donor lymphocyte infusion are often considered in this setting to augment graft-versus-lymphoma (GVL) effects and can occasionally provide durable disease control. Clinical trials designed to investigate novel therapeutic agents with immunomodulatory properties to augment GVL effects (eg, histone deacetylase [HDAC] inhibitors, proteasome inhibitor, lenalidomide) or targeted therapies (eg, aurora A kinase inhibitors, anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK] inhibitors) are sorely needed to improve the dismal outcomes of T-cell NHL relapsing after an allo-HCT.",
