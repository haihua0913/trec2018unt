These genetic alterations include gene amplification and overexpression of oncogenes such as myc, erbB-2, EGFR and cyclinD1 and mutations, deletions and hypermethylation leading to p16 and TP53 tumor suppressor gene inactivation. In addition, loss of heterozygosity in several chromosomal regions is frequently observed, suggesting that other tumor suppressor genes not yet identified could be involved in the tumorigenic process of head and neck cancers. The exact temporal sequence of the genetic alterations during head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) development and progression has not yet been defined and their diagnostic or prognostic significance is controversial. Advances in the understanding of the molecular basis of head and neck cancer should help in the identification of new markers that could be used for the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of the disease.",

CTP has been shown to distinguish which locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinomas will respond to induction chemotherapy or chemoradiation. Our purpose was to determine whether a relationship exists between CTP measures and the expression of these laboratory biomarkers, because both appear to separate head and neck squamous cell carcinoma tumors into similar groups.;We conducted an institutional review board-approved, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant retrospective review of head and neck CTP in 25 patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who had signed informed consent. Eight women and 17 men, 41-80 years of age, constituted a pretreatment group of 18 patients and a palliative group of 7 patients. Tumor biopsy samples were analyzed for overexpression of hrHPV, p16, and EGFR. The hrHPV, p16, and EGFR status of the tumors was correlated with CTP parameters (MTT, BV, BF, CP) by using the Wilcoxon evaluation and Fischer exact test.;There were significantly lower CP values in pretreatment tumors overexpressing EGFR (P = .04). CP values ≤17.23 were significantly correlated with EGFR overexpression (P = .015). A trend toward higher CP values was present in hrHPV-positive and p16-overexpressing pretreatment tumors (P = .14).;A significant correlation exists between CTP measures and EGFR overexpression in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, suggesting an association between certain imaging findings and molecular biomarkers.

Genetic alterations in HNSCC cell lines reflect the tumor in vivo and can serve as valuable tools to study the development and progression of HNSCC. Identification of key molecular events may be useful for more accurate distinction of prognostic groups for selection and targeting of therapy.;Individual gene loci were analyzed for genetic alterations using a novel genomewide strategy.;Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma primary (A) and recurrent or metastatic (B) cell lines UMSCC-11A/11B, UMSCC-17A/17B (previously karyotyped), and UMSCC-81A/81B are described.;At the genome level, loss and gain of genetic loci concurred with tumor karyotypes. Several abnormal gene loci not apparent by cytogenetics were also identified. All except 11B indicated loss of CDKN2A (encodes p14 and p16), with concomitant loss of CDKN2B (encodes p15) in 11A, 17B, and 81A. All 6 cell lines showed gain of PIK3CA (encodes a PI3 kinase) located at 3q26.3.;We provide evidence for the role of 3 critical pathways in the development and progression of HNSCC. The CDKN2A/B genes encode various components of the Rb and p53 pathways, and the PIK3CA gene makes a catalytic subunit of the protein phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K), which is known to be involved in the PI3K/ATK signaling pathways. Molecular events may ultimately serve to achieve genomic alterations that set off an interplay among key gene loci along discrete genetic pathways used by tumor cells in HNSCC.",

Several genetic and epigenetic alterations are associated with HNSCC tumorigenesis, including inactivation of CDKN2A, which encodes the p16 tumor suppressor, in cell lines and primary tumors by DNA methylation. Reactivation of tumor suppressor genes by DNA-demethylating agents and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors shows therapeutic promise for other cancers. Therefore, we investigated the ability of these agents to reactivate p16 in Tu159 HNSCC cells. Treatment of cells with 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) increases CDKN2A expression and slightly increases histone H3 acetylation at this gene. No reactivation of CDKN2A is observed upon treatment with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), but synergistic reactivation of CDKN2A is observed upon sequential treatment of Tu159 cells with both 5-aza-dC and TSA. Silencing of CDKN2A in Tu159 cells is correlated with increased methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 and decreased methylation at lysine 4 relative to the upstream p15 gene promoter. Interestingly, global levels of H3-K9 methylation are decreased upon treatment with 5-aza-dC. Together these data indicate that DNA methylation is a dominant epigenetic mark for silencing of CDKN2A in Tu159 tumor cells. Moreover, changes in DNA methylation can reset the histone code by impacting multiple H3 modifications.",

Complex interactions between a set of molecules, cell cycle proteins, tumour suppressor genes, oncogenes and the telomerase, occur in the multiple step process of carcinogenesis. The 2 main ways of control of the cell cycle rely on 2 tumour suppressor genes: the P53 gene and the retinoblastoma gene or RB gene. One of the regulation pathways or the 2 regulation pathways are disabled during the development of oral and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Most of the time, the inactivation of the P53 pathway results from a loss of function of the p53 protein, secondary to mutation and/or deletion of the P53 gene; It may also result of the amplification of the MDM2 gene and of the inactivation of the arf protein. The RB pathway leads to cell proliferation by loss of the p16 protein, by amplification of the cyclin D1 gene and less frequently by mutation of the RB gene or loss of the retinoblastoma protein. In India and South-East Asia, the activation of RAS and MYC oncogenes appears to be related with the presence of specific carcinogens in snuff and tobacco.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 has also been suggested to play a role in etiology of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). p16 expression is now being used as a surrogate marker of HPV infection in squamous cell carcinoma and provides important prognostic information and future therapy planning.;In this prospective study, total of 75 cases of HNSCC were taken. Tumor grade was determined according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. p16 expression was determined by immunohistochemical staining. The obtained results were analyzed and evaluated using Chi-square test (Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20), value of P <0.05 was taken significant.;Out of 75 cases, 78.7% cases were positive for p16 (inclusive of all grades), while 21.3% cases were negative. Expression of p16 was higher in nonsmokers and nonalcohol consumers and significantly associated with paan chewing habit. No significant correlation was seen with history of abnormal sexual habits, but p16 expression was significantly correlated in cases with multiple sexual partners (P = 0.003), with increasing histological grade (P = 0.045) and in cases with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.03).;As HPV integration with transcription of viral oncoprotein induces overexpression of p16, immunohistochemical expression of p16 can be used as a surrogate marker of HPV. This approach can be implemented in diagnostic laboratories and can provide support for vaccination program in high risk group.",

Their correlations with clinical factors, including location of primary sites, T stage, N stage, M stage, HPV status, primary treatment success/failure, recurrences, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival, were analyzed. HIF-1α, HPS70, HPS90, VEGF, and IGF-1R were positive in 33 of 89 (37.1 %), 62 of 87 (71.3 %), 83 of 89 (93.3 %), 41 of 87 (47.1 %), and 50 of 56 (89.3 %) cases, respectively. Expression levels of some of these markers were correlated. High HIF-1α or HSP 70 correlated with poor DFS, and expression of HSP70 correlated with LN metastasis. HPV-related carcinomas showed high HSP 70 and IGF-1R expression. Hypoxia-associated proteins were highly expressed and associated with aggressive clinical features in HNSCC.

The ansamycin-based Hsp90 inhibitor 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) is currently in phase I/II clinical testing. However, 17-AAG is difficult to formulate and displays weak activity against some tumors. A novel dimeric ansamycin, EC5, was evaluated for antitumor activity in eight head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines. Both 17-AAG and EC5 inhibited tumor cell proliferation effectively, but EC5 was more potent, with IC(50) below 200 nmol/L in most cell lines tested, including several lines that were resistant to 17-AAG. The inability of 17-AAG to kill JHU12 cells was linked to a defect in retinoblastoma signaling and could be rescued by ectopic expression of p16(INK4a). EC5 induced G(1) growth arrest of tumor cells and apoptosis, with the degradation of client proteins including epidermal growth factor receptor, c-Raf-1, Akt, and Cdk4 and inhibition of Akt phosphorylation. In vivo, EC5 dramatically reduced the growth rate of established HNSCC xenografts in nude mice and decreased expression of epidermal growth factor receptor and Akt within the xenografts. These results suggest that this novel ansamycin-based Hsp90 inhibitor affects multiple pathways involved in tumor development and progression and may represent a new strategy for the treatment of HNSCC patients.",

From a cohort of 153 OTSCC patients, 131 formalin fixed paraffin embedded blocks of pre-treatment primary tumours were suitable for further molecular analysis. We assessed CDKN2A (p16) levels by immunohistochemistry (IHC), promoter methylation status by methylation-sensitive high resolution melting, mutation status by Sanger sequencing, gene copy number variation by fluorescence in situ hybridisation, and correlated these with patient outcome. We found that the majority of OTSCC did not overexpress p16 (110/116, 95%), assessed by IHC. The frequency of CDKN2A mutations was 20% (21/103), homozygous loss was 7% (7/97), hemizygous loss 31% (30/97), and promoter methylation was 18% (20/113).

        "Doc_abstract":"As with other solid tumor types, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has been identified as an epigenetic, as well as genetic, disease. Consequently, promoter hypermethylation, being the most important aberrant epigenetic characteristic, has been intensively investigated for its biomarker potential in this cancer type. As many of these evaluations are obscured by a heterogeneity of treatments, the current study aimed to evaluate the incidence and prognostic value of the promoter hypermethylation of TIMP3, CDH1, DAPK, RASSF1A, p16INK4A and MGMT in HNSCC treated solely by radiotherapy. In 46 patients with advanced HNSCC treated with a hybrid accelerated fractionation radiotherapy schedule, DNA extracted from pretreatment paraffin-embedded tumor biopsies was used to determine the methylation status of the genes of interest by methylation-specific PCR (MSP). The detected epigenetic silencing was related with outcome in terms of locoregional control (LRC), and overall (OS), disease-free (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). Tumor biopsies revealed the epigenetic silencing of MGMT in 42.5% (17 of 40) of patients and of TIMP3 in 40.5% (17 of 42) of cases. For the remaining investigated genes, a lower methylation percentage was detected: 13.2% (5 of 38) for CDH1, 11.4% (4 of 44) for DAPK, 4.8% (2 of 42) for p16INK4A and 2.4% (1 of 41) for RASSF1A. The promoter hypermethylation of TIMP3 and CDH1 was significantly related with better LRC (p=0.009 and p=0.02, respectively), OS (p=0.005 and p=0.002, respectively), DFS (p=0.02 and p=0.004, respectively) and DSS (p=0.12 and p=0.007, respectively). In conclusion, in this representative group of 46 patients with advanced HNSCC treated by radiotherapy only, the epigenetic silencing of TIMP3 and CDH1 predicted a better outcome.",

However, the relevance of high-grade acute organ toxicity (HGAOT), which has also been correlated with improved prognosis, has attracted scant attention in HPV-positive HNSCC patients. Hence we tested the hypothesis that both parameters, HPV and HGAOT, are positive prognostic factors in patients with HNSCC treated with definite radiotherapy (RT) or radiochemotherapy (RCT).;Pretreatment tumor tissue and clinical records were available from 233 patients receiving definite RT (62 patients) or RCT (171 patients). HPV infection was analysed by means of HPV DNA detection or p16(INK4A) expression; HGAOT was defined as the occurrence of acute organ toxicity >grade 2 according to the Common Toxicity Criteria. Both variables were correlated with overall survival (OS) using Cox proportional hazards regression.;Positivity for HPV DNA (44 samples, 18.9 %) and p16(INK4A) expression (102 samples, 43.8 %) were significantly correlated (p < 0.01), and HGAOT occurred in 77 (33 %) patients. Overall, the 5-year OS was 23 %; stratified for p16(INK4A) expression and HGAOT, OS rates were 47 %, 42 %, 20 % and 10 % for patients with p16(INK4A) expression and HGAOT, patients with HGAOT only, patients with p16(INK4A) expression only, and patients without p16(INK4A) expression or HGAOT, respectively. After multivariate testing p16(INK4A) expression (p = 0.003) and HGAOT (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with OS.;P16(INK4A) expression and HGAOT are independent prognostic factors for OS of patients with HNSCC, whereas p16(INK4A) expression is particularly important for patients without HGAOT.",

Tobacco use and heavy alcohol consumption are known risk factors for HNSCC but in other cases human papillomavirus (HPV) is linked to carcinogenesis. HPV proteins E6 and E7 promote oncogenesis by blocking the action of p53 and pRB, respectively. An absence of p53 mutations in addition to expression of p16 are part of the distinct molecular profile identified in the subset of HNSCCs because of HPV. Various methods are available for HPV detection but polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization techniques are commonly used. Both methods are amenable for testing formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue that is a sample type readily available to the pathologist. HPV is detectable in approximately a quarter of all HNSCCs, and is particularly prevalent in the oropharynx in which the positivity rates approach 40%. A vast majority of HPV-related HNSCCs are owing to HPV type 16 with types 18, 31, and 33 accounting for almost all of the remaining cases. HPV-related HNSCCs are associated with better prognosis for both recurrence and survival. This group of tumors has also been shown to respond well to radiation treatment. As the clinical relevance of HPV in HNSCCs continues to emerge, anatomic pathologists are likely to receive increasing requests for testing.

Despite considerable efforts, the 5-year survival rate for HNSCC has not changed significantly. To improve this situation, it is necessary to understand the fundamental biological processes leading to the disease and its progression. In addition to known genetic changes in HNSCC, molecular cytogenetic investigations have identified chromosomal regions of gains and losses, but many of the responsible candidate genes have yet to be identified. Furthermore, recent results indicate the importance of epigenetic modifications in HNSCC, such as DNA methylation. Several genes, including the tumor suppressor CDKN2A and other candidates such as DAPK1, MGMT, TIMP3, TCF21, and C/EBPalpha, have been found to harbor hypermethylated regulatory sequences that lead to reduced expression or gene silencing. Hypermethylation in such genes could be used not only as biomarkers for the early detection of HNSCC but also to improve prevention strategies and therapy outcomes.",

We and others found that p16INK4a overexpression is associated with improved therapy response and survival of patients with HNSCC treated with radiotherapy. However, the functional role of p16INK4a in HNSCC remains unexplored. Our results implicate p16INK4a in regulation of homologous recombination-mediated DNA damage response independently from its role in control of the cell cycle. We found that expression of p16INK4a dramatically affects radiation sensitivity of HNSCC cells. p16INK4a overexpression impairs the recruitment of RAD51 to the site of DNA damage in HPV-positive cells by downregulating of cyclin D1 protein expression. Consistent with the in vitro findings, immunostaining of HNSCC patient samples revealed that high levels p16INK4a expression significantly correlated with decreased cyclin D1 expression. In summary, these findings reveal an unexpected function of p16INK4a in homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair response and imply p16INK4a status as an independent marker to predict response of patients with HNSCC to radiotherapy.",

The opioid growth factor (OGF; [Met(5)]-enkephalin) and the OGF receptor (OGFr) form an endogenous growth regulating system; the OGF-OGFr axis influences the G(0)-G(1) phase of the cell cycle in HNSCC. Cells treated with small interfering RNA (siRNA) for OGFr no longer responded to the growth inhibitory effects of OGF or the growth stimulatory effects of naltrexone, indicating that these activities are entirely mediated by OGFr. In this investigation, we examined the precise target of OGF in the cell cycle. Using SCC-1 cells, OGF decreased the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein. This change was correlated with reduced Cdk4, but not Cdk2, kinase activity. OGF treatment increased cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16 protein expression. Importantly, p16 complexed with Cdk4 was increased by OGF treatment at all time points, consistent with the hypothesis that OGF mediated growth inhibition through p16. Blockade of OGF-OGFr interactions with naloxone abolished the increased expression of p16 protein by OGF. Inhibition of p16 (INK4a) activation by p16-specific siRNA blocked OGF's repressive action on proliferation of SCC-1, CAL-27, and SCC-4 HNSCC cells. These data are the first to reveal that the target of cell proliferative inhibitory action of OGF in human HNSCC is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitory pathway, and this may be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of HNSCC.",

This study analyzed the presence and genotype of high risk HPVs, viral DNA load and transcription of the E6/E7 mRNAs, in 231 consecutive HNSCC. Twelve out of 30 HPV16 DNA-positive tumors displayed high E6/E7 mRNAs levels and were localized in the oropharyngeal region. While HPV-free and non-transcriptionally active HPV-related patients showed similar 5-years survival rates, E6/E7 expression was associated with a better prognosis. This emphasizes the importance of considering the transcriptional status of HPV-positive tumors for patient stratification. A gene expression profiling analysis of these different types of tumors was carried out. The most significant differentially expressed gene was CDKN2A, a known biomarker for HPV-related cancer. Assessing both the expression level of the E6/E7 mRNAs and of CDKN2A in HNSCC is required to detect active HPV infection. Chromosomic alterations were investigated by Comparative Genomic Hybridation (CGH) analysis of tumors with transcriptionally active HPV and HPV-negative tumors. The loss of the chromosomal region 16q was found to be a major genetic event in HPV-positive lesions. A cluster of genes located in 16q21-24 displayed decreased expression levels, notably APP-BP1 that is involved in the modulation of the transcriptional activity of p53. In conclusion, this study highlights important criteria required to predict clinically active HPV infection, identifies new biological pathways implicated in HPV tumorigenesis and increases the understanding of HPV-HNSCC physiopathology that is required to develop new targets for therapy.",

These metastases are often cystic with a predominantly non-keratinizing, basaloid morphology. Knowledge of the HPV status of metastatic HNSCC has significant treatment and prognostic implications as HPV-associated tumors have a more favorable prognosis than conventional HNSCC. Accordingly, HPV testing should be performed on any squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary identified in neck lymph nodes. HPV detection may be performed using a variety of methods including p16 as a surrogate immunohistochemical marker, in situ hybridization and/or polymerase chain reaction detection of viral DNA or RNA. Further investigation is needed to determine the optimal method for HPV detection in fine-needle aspiration specimens. Cytology screening for HPV-associated HNSCC does not appear to be effective.

By analyzing 78 HNSCC we sought to validate the accuracy of p16(INK4A) as a reliable marker of active HPV infections in HNSCC. To this end we determined HPV DNA (HPVD) and E6*I mRNA (HPVR) expression status and correlated these results with p16(INK4A) staining. In tonsillar SCC 12/20 were HPVD+ and 12/12 of these showed active HPV infections whereas in non-tonsillar SCC 10/58 were HPVD+ and 5/10 showed active HPV infections. Thus, we prove about 8% of non-tonsillar SCC to be also correlated with HPV-associated carcinogenesis. Strikingly, 3/14 (21.4%) of tonsillar and non-tonsillar HPVD+/HPVR+ cases did not show p16(INK4A) overexpression and these cases would have been missed when applying initial p16(INK4A) staining only. However, in 13 cases negative for HPV, DNA p16(INK4A) was overexpressed. In conclusion, our data confirm tonsillar SCC to be predominantly but not only associated with active HPV infections. Furthermore, our data show that p16(INK4A) overexpression is not evident in a subgroup of HNSCC with active HPV infection. Definitive HPV data should therefore be utilized in diagnostics and treatment modalities of HPV positive and HPV negative HNSCC patients, resulting in a paradigm shift regarding these obviously different tumor entities.",

The prescribed radiotherapy (RT) dose was 66-68 Gy in 2 Gy fractions, 6 F/W. The hypoxic radiosensitiser nimorazole was given orally at a dose of 1200 mg/m(2) before each fraction. Concomitant cisplatin (40 mg/m(2)) i.v. was given once a week for a maximum of six cycles. Outcome data were evaluated in terms of loco-regional tumour control (LRC), event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). Morbidity data were evaluated based on the DAHANCA routine registration. Human papillomavirus (HPV)-status was estimated by immunohistochemical staining of p16.;Included were 178 (78%) men and 49 (22%) women with a median age of 57 years. All except five patients received RT as prescribed. At least five series of cisplatin was given to 164 (72%) of the patients, and 149 patients (66%) received the full dose of nimorazole. The five-year actuarial LRC, EFS and OS rates were 80%, 67% and 72%, respectively. The LRC rates according to site were: oropharynx: 88%, larynx: 77%, hypopharynx 72% and oral cavity 49%, respectively. HPV/p16 staining was obtained in 141 of the 150 oropharyngeal cancers. Of these, 112 (79%) were p16 pos and 29 (21%) were p16 neg. LRC for the p16 neg oropharyngeal cancers was poorer than for the p16 pos (74% vs. 91%; p = 0.02). Tube feeding during treatment was necessary for 146 (64%) patients. At 12 months this number was reduced to 6%.;The treatment was tolerable in this cohort of locally advanced HNSCC patients. Acute and late toxicity was comparable to similar studies of chemoradiotherapy, and the outcome superior to the data reported in the literature. This strongly indicates that RT of advanced head and neck cancer must include as well hypoxic modification, accelerated fractionation as chemoradiotherapy to yield optimal outcome.",

Therefore, predictive biomarkers for this disease would be valuable to provide more effective and individualized therapeutic approaches for these patients. While prognostic biomarkers such as p16 expression correlate with outcome; to date, no predictive biomarkers have been clinically validated for HNSCC. We generated xenografts in immunocompromised mice from six established HNSCC cell lines and evaluated response to cisplatin, cetuximab, and radiation. Tissue microarrays were constructed from pre- and posttreatment tumor samples derived from each xenograft experiment. Quantitative immunohistochemistry was performed using a semiautomated imaging and analysis platform to determine the relative expression of five potential predictive biomarkers: epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), phospho-EGFR, phospho-Akt, phospho-ERK, and excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1). Biomarker levels were compared between xenografts that were sensitive versus resistant to a specific therapy utilizing a two-sample t-test with equal standard deviations. Indeed the xenografts displayed heterogeneous responses to each treatment, and we linked a number of baseline biomarker levels to response. This included low ERCC1 being associated with cisplatin sensitivity, low phospho-Akt correlated with cetuximab sensitivity, and high total EGFR was related to radiation resistance. Overall, we developed a systematic approach to identifying predictive biomarkers and demonstrated several connections between biomarker levels and treatment response. Despite these promising initial results, this work requires additional preclinical validation, likely involving the use of patient-derived xenografts, prior to moving into the clinical realm for confirmation among patients with HNSCC.

Furthermore, recent studies in cancer have suggested the importance of identifying transcriptionally altered loci as biomarkers for improved prognosis and therapy. While many statistical methods have been proposed for identifying novel transcriptional events with RNA-seq, nearly all rely on contrasting known classes of samples, such as tumor and normal. Few tools exist for the unsupervised discovery of such events without class labels. In this paper, we present SigFuge for identifying genomic loci exhibiting differential transcription patterns across many RNA-seq samples. SigFuge combines clustering with hypothesis testing to identify genes exhibiting alternative splicing, or differences in isoform expression. We apply SigFuge to RNA-seq cohorts of 177 lung and 279 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas, and identify several cases of differential isoform usage including CDKN2A, a tumor suppressor gene known to be inactivated in a majority of lung squamous cell tumors. By not restricting attention to known sample stratifications, SigFuge offers a novel approach to unsupervised screening of genetic loci across RNA-seq cohorts. SigFuge is available as an R package through Bioconductor. ",

Distant spread is uncommon, and brain involvement is rare. Over the past decade there has been a rising incidence of HPV-related HNSCC, but it is not known if this escalation has had any impact on trends relating to brain involvement. Cases of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) to the brain were identified from a computerized search of the surgical pathology files of The Johns Hopkins Hospital between 1985 and 2012. The medical records were reviewed to document primary site of tumor origin, treatment, and patient outcome. P16 immunohistochemistry and HPV in situ hybridization were performed on those metastases arising from the head and neck. Of the 38 metastatic SCCs, 7 (18 %) originated in the head and neck. HPV-16 was detected in 4 (57 %) of the metastatic HNSCCs. All 4 HPV-positive metastases were from oropharyngeal primaries. The time from treatment of the primary to development of the brain metastasis ranged from 19 to 57 months (mean, 45). Following aggressive treatment (surgery and radiation), two patients died of disease progression (7 and 34 months), and two are alive with recurrent brain metastases (4 and 10 months). Although HPV positivity is regarded as a favorable prognostic indicator, it does not safeguard from spread to the brain. In our experience, just over half of the HNSCCs that metastasized to the brain were HPV-related. The potential for developing a brain metastasis long after curative therapy argues for extended patient follow-up. The development of a brain metastasis is an ominous finding signaling rapid clinical deterioration.",

T4 tumors had a nearly 9 times greater rate of mortality compared with T1 tumors (HR, 8.52 [95% CI, 2.60-18.40; P < .001); N3 disease was associated with 7.18 times greater mortality (HR, 7.18 [95% CI, 1.99-12.26]; P < .001) compared with N1 disease; and M1 disease was associated with 6.0 times greater mortality (HR, 5.99 [95% CI, 2.59-13.81]; P < .001). There were 42 total deaths during follow-up, 25 in the HPV-negative group and 17 in the HPV-positive group, with a nonsignificantly higher overall survival among HPV-positive patients independent of alcohol or tobacco use history (P = .09).;Previous studies have found that the proportion of HPV-positive HNSCC in the general population ranges between 20% and 75%. Although the incidence of HPV-positive HNSCC in the Veterans Affairs population is comparable, these patients have unique risk factors and demographic characteristics that may suggest different prognostic factors for HPV-positive HNSCC in this population. Nonetheless, HPV-positive tumors still seem to portend a better overall prognosis regardless of alcohol or tobacco history among the Veterans Affairs population.",

The objective of this study was to determine the prognostic significance of tumour HPV status, p16 and p53 expression, and mutations in TP53 in patients with SCCAC receiving (chemo)radiotherapy.;Human papillomavirus DNA was determined using an INNO-LiPA-based assay in tumour tissue of 107 patients with locally advanced SCCAC. Patients were treated with radiotherapy, with or without concurrent chemotherapy consisting of a fluoropyrimidine and mitomycin C. Expression of p16 and p53 was determined using immunohistochemistry. Exons 2-11 of TP53 in tumour tissue were sequenced.;DNA of high-risk HPV types was detected in 93 out of 107 tumours (87%), all of which overexpressed p16 (HPV+/p16+). Of 14 HPV-negative (HPV-) tumours (13%), 10 (9%) were p16-negative (HPV-/p16-) and 4 (4%) overexpressed p16 (HPV-/p16+). Patients with HPV-/p16- disease had inferior 3-year locoregional control (LRC) (15%) compared with patients with HPV+/p16+ tumours (82%, P<0.001) and HPV-/p16+ tumours (75%, P=0.078). Similarly, 3-year overall survival (OS) was 35% (HPV-/p16-) vs 87% (HPV+/p16+, P<0.001) and 75% (HPV-/p16+, P=0.219). Disruptive mutations in TP53 were found in 80% of HPV-/p16- tumours vs 6% of HPV+/p16+ tumours (P<0.001). In multivariate analysis, HPV-/p16- status was an independent predictor of inferior LRC and OS.;HPV- tumours are frequently TP53 mutated. HPV-/p16- status is a strong predictor for reduced LRC and OS, and alternative treatment strategies for patients with HPV-/p16- disease need to be explored.",

It is the most common neoplasm appearing in the upper aerodigestive tract and the sixth most common cancer worldwide. The five-year survival rate remains poor despite advances in surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Furthermore, the incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal cancer is rising. Thus, innovative therapy approaches are imperative in order to improve the situation. Everolimus, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and sorafenib and sunitinib, multityrosine kinase inhibitors, have been notably effective in the therapy of different tumor entities. The modest side-effects and oral application of the drugs might improve patient compliance. Expression levels of mTOR and Amphiregulin (AREG) in p16-positive and -negative SCC (squamous cell carcinoma) and the effect of everolimus, sorafenib or sunitinib on the expression levels of these target proteins were assessed. As far as we are aware of, this is one of the first in vitro studies to evaluate the effect of these small-molecule drugs with regard to the p16 status of SCC cells.;p16-negative HNSCC 11A and 14C cells and p16-positive CERV196 cells were exposed to different concentrations of everolimus, sorafenib and sunitinib for 2-8 days. Expression levels of mTOR and AREG were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and compared against a chemonaïve control.;AREG and mTOR were expressed in all tested cell lines. CERV196 displayed a remarkable increase of mTOR expression compared to p16-negative HNSCC. On the contrary, AREG levels were reduced by 50% in CERV196. Everolimus, sorafenib and sunitinib significantly reduced mTOR expression. Everolimus significantly decreased AREG expression independently of the HPV status. Sunitinib and sorafenib increased AREG expression in HNSCC 11A and 14C but not in CERV196.;The applied drugs showed remarkable suppression of mTOR expression, which might delay tumor progression. Interestingly, sorafenib and sunitinib increased AREG in HNSCC 11A and 14C, which could be a possible evasive mechanism following incubation with these drugs. On the contrary, p16-positive CERV196 showed increased susceptibility to sorafenib and sunitinib concerning suppression of AREG expression. Further studies are required to evaluate the HPV-dependent differences of therapy response and the possible consequences for treatment options.",

Association of HPV in oral cancers has not been explored in north-east India.;Thirty-one patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) on treatment from October 2010 to January 2013 were included in the study. Patients who received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy were excluded. HPV 16/18 DNA was evaluated using Chromogenic in-situ Hybridization (CISH). Presence of nuclear signals was taken as positive HPV expression. p16 was evaluated using immunohistochemistry and was considered positive if ≥ 80% of the tumour cells showed strong and diffuse nuclear/cytoplasmic immunostaining. The results were analysed using Fisher exact test and confidence interval was calculated where required.;The study group age ranged from 30 to 80 years (median age- 54.2 years). The most common site was gum, with well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma being the most common histology. HPV 16/18 DNA was positive in 29% (95% CI: 13.03% - 44.97%) cases and had a clear tendency towards statistical significance with non-smoker cases (p=0.05), lymph node metastasis (p=0.05) and a significant correlation with p16 overexpression (p=0.04). There was no significant correlation with other clinico-pathological parameters.;HPV 16/18 is associated with OSCC, commonly seen among non-smokers and may be related to nodal metastasis. So, HPV may be used as a prognostic factor in OSCC and p16 may be considered as a surrogate marker for HPV.",

The prognostic significance of these molecular events at different sites within the head and neck, however, remains controversial. Thus, we sought to determine the relationship between cyclin D1 and/or p16INK4A expression and disease outcome in squamous cell carcinoma of the anterior tongue. Immunohistochemical detection of nuclear proteins cyclin D1, p53, and p16INK4A, and the Ki-67 labeling index was undertaken in tissue sections from 148 tongue cancers treated by surgical resection. Nuclear antigen status was analyzed in relation to pathological variables, tumor recurrence, and patient survival. Statistical significance was assessed using chi2 analysis for pathological variables and the Kaplan-Meier method, log rank test, and the Cox proportional hazards model for survival parameters. Overexpression of cyclin D1 occurred in 68% of tumors (100 of 147) and was associated with increased lymph node stage (P = 0.014), increased tumor grade (P = 0.003), and reduced disease-free (P = 0.006) and overall (P = 0.01) survival. Loss of p16INK4A expression was demonstrated in 55% of tumors (78 of 143) and was associated with reduced disease-free (P = 0.007) and overall (P = 0.014) survival. Multivariate analysis confirmed that in addition to pathological stage and regional lymph node status, cyclin D1 overexpression and loss of p16INK4A expression are independent predictors of death from tongue cancer. Loss of p16INK4A in the presence of cyclin D1 overexpression conferred a significantly worse disease-free (P = 0.011) and overall (P = 0.002) survival at 5 years. p53 nuclear accumulation and the Ki-67 labeling index were not prognostic. These data indicate that cyclin D1 overexpression and loss of p16INK4A expression predict early relapse and reduced survival in squamous cell carcinoma of the anterior tongue. Simultaneous assessment of cyclin D1 and p16INK4A protein levels define subgroups of patients at increased risk of relapse and may be of clinical utility in optimizing therapy.",

The expression and subcellular localization of β-catenin and EGFR activation were also studied in HPV-positive and HPV-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines with western blot analysis. HPV16 E6 small interfering RNA was used to elucidate the effect of the HPV oncoprotein on β-catenin translocation. The involvement of EGFR in β-catenin translocation was confirmed by treatment with erlotinib. Moreover, the invasive capacity was evaluated after HPV16 E6/E7 repression.;The results showed that the membrane weighted index of β-catenin was inversely correlated with p16 positivity (P < .001) and lymph node metastasis (P = .026), whereas nuclear staining of β-catenin was associated with p16-positive OPSCC (P < .001). A low level of membrane β-catenin expression was significantly associated with disease-free and overall survival (P < .0001 in both cases). Furthermore, the membrane weighted index of EGFR was inversely correlated with p16 positivity (P < .001) and positively correlated with membrane β-catenin (P < .001). The in vitro study showed that HPV16 E6 repression led to reductions of phospho-EGFR and nuclear β-catenin, which were also observed after erlotinib treatment, and inhibition of invasion.;The findings suggest that HPV16 E6 mediates the translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus, which may be regulated by activated EGFR.",

Whereas HPV16 accounts for the majority of HPV DNA-positive oropharyngeal SCC, infections with other mucosal high-risk HPV types are quite rare and biological data demonstrating their causal involvement are insufficient. Here we present the first case of an oropharyngeal SCC driven by HPV type 58. A 69-year-old Caucasian woman presented with an enlarged and firm left tonsil. A computed tomography scan showed a left tonsillar mass, extending to the soft palate and the glossotonsillar sulcus. The patient underwent extended radical tonsillectomy and ipsilateral selective neck dissection. Pathology confirmed an infiltrating, poorly differentiated SCC of the left tonsil with node metastasis (pT2N1). Adjuvant external beam radiation therapy (60 Grays (Gy)) was administered. After 1 year of follow-up, the patient is well with no evidence of cancer recurrence. HPV analyses of the tumor tissue by BSGP5+/6+ -PCR/MPG, targeting 51 mucosal HPV types, showed single positivity for HPV type 58. Presence of HPV58 E6*I RNA demonstrated biological activity of the virus in the tumor tissue, and presence of serum antibodies to HPV58 oncoproteins E6 and E7 indicated presence of an HPV58-driven cancer. Overexpression of cellular protein p16INK4a and reduced expression of pRb, two cellular markers for HPV-induced cell transformation, were observed. Exons 4-10 of TP53 showed no mutations or polymorphisms. The presence of HPV58 as single HPV infection in combination with a broad variety of direct and indirect markers of HPV transformation provides comprehensive evidence that this oropharyngeal SCC was driven by HPV58.

HPV-positive HNSCC preferentially affect the oropharynx and tonsils. Localized HPV-positive HNSCCs have a favorable prognosis and treatment outcome. However, the impact of HPV in advanced or metastatic HNSCC remains to be defined. In particular, it is unclear whether HPV modulates the response to cetuximab, an antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is a mainstay of treatment of advanced HNSCC. To this end, we have examined the sensitivity of HPV-positive and -negative HNSCC models to cetuximab and cytotoxic drugs in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we have stably expressed the HPV oncogenes E6 and E7 in cetuximab-sensitive cancer cell lines to specifically investigate their role in the antibody response. The endogenous HPV status or the expression of HPV oncogenes had no significant impact on cetuximab-mediated suppression of EGFR signaling and proliferation in vitro. Cetuximab effectively inhibited the growth of E6- and E7-expressing tumors grafted in NOD/SCID mice. In support, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples from cetuximab-treated patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC were probed for p16(INK4a) expression, an established biomarker of HPV infection. Response rates (45.5% versus 45.5%) and median progression-free survival (97 versus 92 days) following cetuximab-based therapy were similar in patients with p16(INK4A)-positive and p16(INK4A)-negative tumors. In conclusion, HPV oncogenes do not modulate the anti-EGFR antibody response in HSNCC. Cetuximab treatment should be administered independently of HPV status. ",

Approximately 70% of global oesophageal cancer cases occur in China, with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) being the histopathological form in the vast majority of cases (>90%). Currently, there are limited clinical approaches for the early diagnosis and treatment of ESCC, resulting in a 10% five-year survival rate for patients. However, the full repertoire of genomic events leading to the pathogenesis of ESCC remains unclear. Here we describe a comprehensive genomic analysis of 158 ESCC cases, as part of the International Cancer Genome Consortium research project. We conducted whole-genome sequencing in 17 ESCC cases and whole-exome sequencing in 71 cases, of which 53 cases, plus an additional 70 ESCC cases not used in the whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing, were subjected to array comparative genomic hybridization analysis. We identified eight significantly mutated genes, of which six are well known tumour-associated genes (TP53, RB1, CDKN2A, PIK3CA, NOTCH1, NFE2L2), and two have not previously been described in ESCC (ADAM29 and FAM135B). Notably, FAM135B is identified as a novel cancer-implicated gene as assayed for its ability to promote malignancy of ESCC cells. Additionally, MIR548K, a microRNA encoded in the amplified 11q13.3-13.4 region, is characterized as a novel oncogene, and functional assays demonstrate that MIR548K enhances malignant phenotypes of ESCC cells. Moreover, we have found that several important histone regulator genes (MLL2 (also called KMT2D), ASH1L, MLL3 (KMT2C), SETD1B, CREBBP and EP300) are frequently altered in ESCC. Pathway assessment reveals that somatic aberrations are mainly involved in the Wnt, cell cycle and Notch pathways. Genomic analyses suggest that ESCC and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma share some common pathogenic mechanisms, and ESCC development is associated with alcohol drinking. This study has explored novel biological markers and tumorigenic pathways that would greatly improve therapeutic strategies for ESCC. ",

The prognostic value of ECS was evaluated for patients with oropharyngeal SCC (OPC; with known p16/human papillomavirus [HPV] status) and for patients with SCC of the oral cavity (OCC).;Disease-specific survival (DSS) was assessed among SCC patients with cervical lymph node metastases (n = 347, including 133 patients with OPC and 214 patients with OCC). All patients were treated surgically between 1983 and 2009. ECS status was determined by pathologists at the time of initial pathologic evaluation and confirmed for this study. HPV status of patients with OPC was determined via immunohistochemistry for p16 and in situ hybridization.;Among OCC patients, ECS was a significant, independent factor influencing DSS. For OCC patients with ECS, 3-year DSS was 45% (95% confidence interval [CI], 36%-56%); for those without ECS, 3-year DSS was 71% (95% CI, 62%-81%; P = .0018). The effect of ECS was independent of the number of positive lymph nodes as well as other clinical, pathologic, and treatment variables. Of the 133 OPC patients, 76 (57%) were p16-positive and 57 (43%) were p16-negative. ECS status did not correlate with DSS among p16-positive or p16-negative OPC patients.;ECS was not associated with worse DSS in p16-positive or p16-negative OPC patients.

        "Doc_abstract":"Recent emerging evidences identify Human Papillomavirus (HPV) related Head and Neck squamous cell carcinomas (HN-SCCs) as a separate subgroup among Head and Neck Cancers with different epidemiology, histopathological characteristics, therapeutic response to chemo-radiation treatment and clinical outcome. However, there is not a worldwide consensus on the methods to be used in clinical practice. The endpoint of this study was to demonstrate the reliability of a triple method which combines evaluation of: 1. p16 protein expression by immunohistochemistry (p16-IHC); 2. HPV-DNA genotyping by consensus HPV-DNA PCR methods (Consensus PCR); and 3 viral integration into the host by in situ hybridization method (ISH). This triple method has been applied to HN-SCC originated from oral cavity (OSCC) and oropharynx (OPSCC), the two anatomical sites in which high risk (HR) HPVs have been clearly implicated as etiologic factors. Methylation-Specific PCR (MSP) was performed to study inactivation of p16-CDKN2a locus by epigenetic events. Reliability of multiple methods was measured by Kappa statistics.;All the HN-SCCs confirmed HPV positive by PCR and/or ISH were also p16 positive by IHC, with the latter showing a very high level of sensitivity as single test (100% in both OSCC and OPSCC) but lower specificity level (74% in OSCC and 93% in OPSCC).Concordance analysis between ISH and Consensus PCR showed a faint agreement in OPSCC (κ = 0.38) and a moderate agreement in OSCC (κ = 0.44). Furthermore, the addition of double positive score (ISHpositive and Consensus PCR positive) increased significantly the specificity of HR-HPV detection on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples (100% in OSCC and 78.5% in OPSCC), but reduced the sensitivity (33% in OSCC and 60% in OPSCC). The significant reduction of sensitivity by the double method was compensated by a very high sensitivity of p16-IHC detection in the triple approach.;Although HR-HPVs detection is of utmost importance in clinical settings for the Head and Neck Cancer patients, there is no consensus on which to consider the 'golden standard' among the numerous detection methods available either as single test or combinations. Until recently, quantitative E6 RNA PCR has been considered the 'golden standard' since it was demonstrated to have very high accuracy level and very high statistical significance associated with prognostic parameters. In contrast, quantitative E6 DNA PCR has proven to have very high level of accuracy but lesser prognostic association with clinical outcome than the HPV E6 oncoprotein RNA PCR. However, although it is theoretically possible to perform quantitative PCR detection methods also on FFPE samples, they reach the maximum of accuracy on fresh frozen tissue. Furthermore, worldwide diagnostic laboratories have not all the same ability to analyze simultaneously both FFPE and fresh tissues with these quantitative molecular detection methods. Therefore, in the current clinical practice a p16-IHC test is considered as sufficient for HPV diagnostic in accordance with the recently published Head and Neck Cancer international guidelines. Although p16-IHC may serve as a good prognostic indicator, our study clearly demonstrated that it is not satisfactory when used exclusively as the only HPV detecting method. Adding ISH, although known as less sensitive than PCR-based detection methods, has the advantage to preserve the morphological context of HPV-DNA signals in FFPE samples and, thus increase the overall specificity of p16/Consensus PCR combination tests.",

Genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) demonstrates molecular alterations to EGFR, MAPK, and PI3K pathways in previously untreated tumors. Therefore, this study uses bioinformatics algorithms to delineate interactions resulting from EGFR inhibitor use in cancer cells with these genetic alterations. We modify the HaCaT keratinocyte cell line model to simulate cancer cells with constitutive activation of EGFR, HRAS, and PI3K in a controlled genetic background. We then measure gene expression after treating modified HaCaT cells with gefitinib, afatinib, and cetuximab. The CoGAPS algorithm distinguishes a gene expression signature associated with the anticipated silencing of the EGFR network. It also infers a feedback signature with EGFR gene expression itself increasing in cells that are responsive to EGFR inhibitors. This feedback signature has increased expression of several growth factor receptors regulated by the AP-2 family of transcription factors. The gene expression signatures for AP-2alpha are further correlated with sensitivity to cetuximab treatment in HNSCC cell lines and changes in EGFR expression in HNSCC tumors with low CDKN2A gene expression. In addition, the AP-2alpha gene expression signatures are also associated with inhibition of MEK, PI3K, and mTOR pathways in the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) data. These results suggest that AP-2 transcription factors are activated as feedback from EGFR network inhibition and may mediate EGFR inhibitor resistance.",

There is upregulation of cellular proliferation pathways such as the Akt pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and the Wnt pathway. Cell adhesion is compromised due to abnormal E-cadherin and beta-catenin function. Aberrations in cell cycle are due to dysregulation of factors such as p16, cyclin D1, and cyclin E. Anti-apoptotic mechanisms are also upregulated. There are multiple abnormalities unique to NPC that are potential targets for novel treatments.",

In particular, patients with advanced HNSCC have the poorest prognosis. To understand more about the contribution of cell cycle alterations to HNSCC development and their possible value in predicting prognosis and response to chemotherapy, we evaluated the levels of proteins involved in cell cycle control in patients diagnosed with advanced HNSCC.;A tissue microarray was made with 122 HNSCC specimens obtained from biopsy material. Protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and correlated with clinical and pathological characteristics.;Multiple alterations at various checkpoints of cell cycle progression were observed. Loss of P16 protein was less common in oropharyngeal tumors than at other HNSCC locations (P = 0.02). Evaluation of the simultaneous expression of different proteins highlighted direct correlations (P < 0.05) such as that of the cyclin-dependent kinases with their cyclin-partners, and the Ki-67 protein with cyclin-dependent kinases 1, cyclin A (CA) and cyclin B1. Median overall survival and time-to-progression were longer in patients with CA-expressing tumors (not reached versus 34.4 months, P = 0.02) and (47.3 versus 14.6 months, P = 0.006), respectively. Moreover, expression of CA in tumors predicted a better response to chemotherapy. Positive expression of cyclin E in tumors was also associated with an increased median time-to-progression (14.6 versus 25.8 months, P = 0.04). Finally, patients with cyclin D1-expressing tumors had shorter median overall survival (29.6 months versus not reached, P = 0.05) and shorter median time-to-progression (21.5 months versus not reached, P = 0.06). However, in a multivariate analysis a CA-negative-expressing tumor was the only independent poor prognostic factor in the entire cohort of HNSCC patients [odds ratio, 2.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.2-4.5; P = 0.01].;Our results provide detailed information on the molecular profile of cell cycle components in HNSCCs and identify CA-negative-expressing tumors as an independent marker of tumor progression and poor response to chemotherapy in patients diagnosed with advanced HNSCC.",

This study aimed to determine the effect of radical therapy on HPV-specific T cells and other immune parameters in 20 OPC patients, as a prelude to future immunotherapy studies. HPV DNA could be detected in 9/12 available tissue samples (8/9 HPV(+) samples were also p16(+)). HPV-specific T cell responses against HPV16 E6 and E7 peptides were detected by enzyme-linked immunoSPOT in 10/13 and 8/13 evaluable patients, respectively, but did not appear to correlate with HPV status. Post-treatment, both HPV E6 and E7 T cell responses were decreased (4/13 and 2/13 patients, respectively). These reductions in T cell response could not be explained by a concurrent decrease in memory T cells whose absolute numbers were relatively unaffected by radical therapy (27,975 vs. 25,661/10(5) PBMC) despite a significant decrease in overall lymphocyte counts (1.74 vs. 0.69 × 10(9)/L). Instead, there were significant increases in regulatory T cells (3.7 vs. 6.8 %) and a population of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (CD14(-)HLA-DR(-)CD15(hi), 12.38 vs. 21.92 %). This suggests that immunosuppression may contribute to the reduction in HPV-specific T cell responses post-treatment, although study of larger patient cohorts will be required to test whether this affects clinical outcome. Overall these findings suggest that HPV-targeted immunotherapy in post-therapy OPC patients will require multiple strategies to boost T cell immunity and to overcome the influence of immunosuppressive cells.",

Some of these tumors may originate as human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), with better clinical outcome than head neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) in general, and could potentially do well with less treatment. Here, we therefore investigated whether HPV status and p53-expression correlated to clinical outcome in patients with CUP in the head neck region. Fifty metastases were analyzed for presence of HPV DNA, and expression of p16(INK4A) and p53 and the data were correlated to clinical outcome. Patients with HPV DNA-positive (HPVDNA+) metastases had significantly better 5-year overall survival (OS) compared to those with HPVDNA- metastases (80.0% vs. 36.7%, respectively; P = 0.004), with a similar tendency for disease-free survival (DFS). These survival rates showed excellent concordance with those of HPVDNA+ and HPVDNA- OSCC in Sweden during the same time period, strengthening the hypothesis that HPVDNA+ head and neck CUP may originate from HPVDNA+ OSCC. In addition, having absent/intermediary-low as compared to high expression of p53 correlated to a better prognosis with a 69% as compared to 14% 5-year OS, respectively (P < 0.001), and for DFS the tendency was analogous. In conclusion, both HPV status and p53 expression are valuable prognostic factors in patients with CUP in the head and neck region and should be further explored for clinical use.",

In addition, if supported by currently on-going clinical trials, attribution of a HNC to HPV may allow better and less toxic treatments. Here we focused on studies in which the prevalence of molecular and serological HPV markers was similarly assessed in oropharyngeal and non-oropharyngeal HNC. Large data on HPV DNA detection by PCR and p16 expression in HNC biopsies suggests that the probability of a cancer of the oral cavity, larynx, and hypopharynx being attributable to HPV is at least 5-fold lower than that for oropharyngeal cancer. Seropositivity for HPV16 E6 or E7 shows larger differences across sites, but findings vary between studies. Because HPV DNA and p16 detection lack specificity, and E6 and E7 antibody detection lacks sensitivity, these tests are not totally satisfactory. Limited data on in situ hybridization or HPV E6/E7 mRNA, mainly from the United States, suggests that HPV-attributable HNC is rare in the oral cavity (∼3%), larynx (∼7%), and hypopharynx (∼0%). Data on HPV in other rarer HNCs are extremely limited and essentially negative. Available data do not allow the establishment of the way HPV infection and tobacco may interact in non-oropharyngeal HNC. The exclusion of oropharynx as a site of tumor origin and the identification of robust fingerprints of HPV-driven carcinogenesis are the priorities to improve the estimate of HPV-attributable non-oropharyngeal HNC.

Although patients with HNSCCs are often treated with radiotherapy, preclinical models are limited by the ability to deliver precise radiation to orthotopic tumors and to monitor treatment responses accordingly. To better model this clinical scenario, we developed a novel autochthonous HPV-positive oral tumor model to track responses to small molecules and image-guided radiation. We used a tamoxifen-regulated Cre recombinase system to conditionally express the HPV oncogenes E6 and E7 as well as a luciferase reporter (iHPV-Luc) in the epithelial cells of transgenic mice. In the presence of activated Cre recombinase, luciferase activity, and by proxy, HPV oncogenes were induced to 11-fold higher levels. In triple transgenic mice containing the iHPV-Luc, K14-CreER(tam), and LSL-Kras transgenes, tamoxifen treatment resulted in oral tumor development with increased bioluminescent activity within 6 days that reached a maximum of 74.8-fold higher bioluminescence compared with uninduced mice. Oral tumors expressed p16 and MCM7, two biomarkers associated with HPV-positive tumors. After treatment with rapamycin or image-guided radiotherapy, tumors regressed and possessed decreased bioluminescence. Thus, this novel system enables us to rapidly visualize HPV-positive tumor growth to model existing and new interventions using clinically relevant drugs and radiotherapy techniques.",

Many challenges have to be addressed in order to integrate HPV status in the routine decision-making in patients with oropharyngeal cancer. The present review discusses the standardization of detection methods suitable for clinical use and the differences in predictive parameters between patients with HPV-positive and HPV-negative tumors.;The gold standard for the identification of patients with oropharyngeal tumors etiologically linked to HPV infection is undoubtedly the detection of HPV 16 E6/E7 mRNA. The detection of a surrogate marker of active viral infection, p16ink4a, has a low sensitivity when used alone and must therefore be combined with the detection of HPV DNA or HPV-specific antibodies. The detailed knowledge of the importance of specific prognostic parameters is crucial in the choice of treatment. Nodal staging is probably much less important in HPV-positive cancers.;It is of great importance to implement standardized testing for the identification of patients with HPV-induced oropharyngeal tumors. The treatment decision models in HPV-positive tumors have to take into account the probably different prognostic value of nodal parameters.

The results from general linear mixed models further supported the nonsignificant treatment effects until 5 years after treatment (P=.95, .90, and .84 for PSS-HN Diet, Eating, and Speech, respectively). Before treatment and after 1 year after treatment, p16-positive oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) patients had better QOL than did p16-negative patients (P ranged from .0283 to <.0001 for all questionnaires). However, QOL/PS decreased more significantly from pretreatment to the last 2 weeks of treatment in the p16-positive group than in the p16-negative group (P ranged from .0002 to <.0001). Pretreatment QOL/PS was a significant independent predictor of overall survival, progression-free survival, and local-regional failure but not of distant metastasis (P ranged from .0063 to <.0001).;The results indicated that patients in both arms may have experienced similar QOL/PS. p16-positive patients had better QOL/PS at baseline and after 1 year of follow-up. Patients presenting with better baseline QOL/PS scores had better survival.",

Patient demographics, disease characteristics, treatment details and outcomes, including recurrence rates and survival were collected. Data was collected on new and recurrent cases of HNC. This data was compared between the two types of HNC using chi-square tests for dichotomous categorical variables or Fishers exact test where appropriate. Wald test was used to compare categorical variables with 3 categories. Continuous variables were compared using the non-parametric Wilcoxon test.;318 charts were included in the analysis. 122 (38%) were oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCCs). In terms of disease characteristics, OPSCCs were more likely to be poorly differentiated/undifferentiated (n = 267, 49(40%) vs 42(21%), p < 0.001), non-keratinizing (n = 169, 25(20%) vs 17(9%), p < 0.001), greater than 2 cm (n = 253, 72(59%) vs 78(40%), p = 0.0061), stage 4 (n = 313, 55(45%) vs 64(33%), p = 0.0315) and have had locoregional nodal spread (n = 315, 103(84%) vs 55(28%), p < 0.001). In the subset of 57 patients that had p16 testing, OPSCCs were more likely to be p16(+) (37(30%) vs 1(1%), p < .001). There were no significant differences in terms of Charlson probability of 10 year survival, smoking or alcohol consumption although OPSCC patients were significantly less likely to have COPD as a co-morbidity (n = 318, 19(16%) vs 53(27%), p = 0.0175). Finally, OPSCCs had less chance for relapse than non-OPSCCs in both univariate (2.119 times less, p=0.0034) and multivariate (1.899 times less, p=0.0505) analyses along with a 1.822 times less overall mortality in a multivariae analysis (p=0.0408).;This analysis suggests that Nova Scotian OPSCCs should be considered distinct from other HNC lesions, most notably in terms of disease characteristics and prognosis. Specifically, despite a higher association with disease factors traditionally considered to be linked to poor prognosis, outcomes were actually superior in terms of relapse and overall mortality.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Perhaps one of the most important developments in head and neck oncology of the past decade is the demonstration that patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-mediated oropharyngeal cancers have significantly improved outcomes, compared to HPV-negative counterpart patients. This has become the basis for clinical trials investigating the impact on \"treatment deintensification\" for patients with HPV-mediated oropharyngeal cancers. Unfortunately, the significance of HPV in non-oropharyngeal head and neck cancers is much less certain. Our goal is to systematically review the published data regarding the role HPV in carcinomas of the oral cavity, larynx, sinonasal tract and nasopharynx with respect to HPV detection frequency, viral activity, and association with outcome. We also present preliminary data on HPV16/18 transcriptional status in oral cavity carcinomas, as well as salivary gland neoplasia, as determined by nested reverse transcription PCR for HPV E6/E7 RNA. The weighted prevalence (WP) of HPV DNA detection in 4,195 oral cavity cancer patients is 20.2 %, (95 % CI 16.0 %, 25.2 %). HPV16 is the most common type detected. Importantly, no data currently demonstrates a significant association between the presence of HPV DNA and improved outcome. The WP of HPV DNA in 1,712 laryngeal cancer patients is 23.6 %, (95 % CI 18.7 %, 29.3 %). Similarly, no association has yet been demonstrated between HPV DNA status and outcome. The WP of HPV DNA detection in 120 sinonasal cancer patients is 29.6 % (95 % CI 17.8 %, 44.9 %), and in 154 nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients is 31.1 %, (95 % CI 20.3 %, 44.5 %). Recent preliminary data also suggests an association between HPV and certain salivary gland neoplasms. The clinical significance of these findings is unclear. The published data strongly support the need for studies on patients with oral and laryngeal carcinomas that will be powered to find any differences in clinical outcome with respect to HR-HPV and p16 overexpression.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Human papillomavirus (HPV) was recently identified as a risk factor for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) independent of tobacco and alcohol use. The prognosis of patients with HPV-related oropharyngeal carcinomas is better than that for patients with non-HPV-related cancers. Researchers and clinicians can test for HPV infection in cancer by (1) testing directly for HPV DNA and (2) testing for overexpression of the downstream p16 protein; there is currently no consensus regarding which is the better test. The chances of developing a reliable oropharyngeal HPV screening test for high-risk populations are promising. Such a test would allow for secondary prevention by identifying individuals with precursor or early-stage cancerous lesions that are more amenable to treatment. HPV testing has particular significance in SCC of an unknown primary site in head and neck cancer. Successful HPV testing of nodal metastasis can localize cancer specifically to the oropharynx. The optimal evaluation for SCC of an unknown primary in the head and neck has yet to be determined. Some studies have shown that the tonsillar fossa is the most probable primary site, followed closely by the base of the tongue. Biopsies often miss tonsillar carcinoma in the deep crypts of the lymph tissue, as well as in those rare cases in which the primary tumor is located contralateral to the metastatic lymph node. Recently, there has been an increase in the number of reports of diagnosed synchronous bilateral HPV-related tonsillar carcinomas. This increase has profound implications for the surgical approach of SCC of an unknown primary site in the head and neck and in tonsillar carcinoma, and it supports the need for bilateral tonsillectomy. We present 2 cases of incidentally discovered synchronous bilateral tonsillar carcinoma, and we review the literature. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx is a well-defined entity mostly affecting young to middle-aged male non-smokers. It is generally associated with a favourable outcome, and for this reason a less intensive therapeutic approach has been proposed for this subset of patients. The incidence of HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancers is rapidly increasing in most Western countries, but detailed epidemiological data are not available for the Italian population. Furthermore, among other head and neck regions, a smaller proportion of oral high-grade dysplasia and cancers seems to depend on HPV infection, whereas its role in laryngeal cancer is recognised as less relevant. HPV-dependent neoplastic transformation depends on the expression of viral oncogenes in the infected host cell that can only be directly documented through viral oncogene mRNA identification. The consensus on how to classify these patients from clinical and laboratory diagnostic points of view is still limited, with different approaches based on one or more diagnostic techniques including p16 immunostaining, in situ hybridisation and polymerase chain reation (PCR) amplification of viral DNA. The possibility of early diagnosis relying on the identification of HPV infection in oral and oropharyngeal exfoliated cells has so far provided unsatisfactory results, although viral persistence after treatment has been associated with risk of recurrence. Presently, sufficient data are not available to document the natural history and progression from tonsillar HPV infection to oropharyngeal cancer development, and to clearly define the modality of transmission and risk exposure, among which sexual behaviours appear to play a relevant role. The diffusion of HPV vaccination and its administration to both genders will undoubtedly dramatically modify the epidemiology of HPV-related head and neck cancers in the coming years.",

This study was performed to quantify the dose-dependent impact on RR and overall survival (OS) in a prospectively collected cohort of OPC from the ARTSCAN study with emphasis on elective treatment.;ARTSCAN is a previously published prospective, randomized, multicentre study of altered radiotherapy (RT) fractionation in head and neck cancer. In ARTSCAN the elective treatment volume for node positive OPC varied significantly between centres due to local treatment principles. All patients with OPC in complete response after primary treatment were eligible for the present case-control study. Cases were patients with RR during five years follow-up. Patients with no recurrence were eligible as controls. Four controls per case were matched according to T- and N-stage. Mean (D mean) and median (D 50%) dose for the lymph node level (LNL) of RR in the cases and the corresponding LNL in the controls were analysed with conditional logistic regression. OS was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method and evaluated by multivariate Cox regression analysis.;There was a dose-dependent risk reduction for D 50% in the interval that represented elective treatment (40-50 Gy) (OR = 0.18, p < 0.05) and a trend in the same dose interval for D mean (OR = 0.19, p = 0.07). OS rates at five years were 0.39 (0.24-0.65) for cases and 0.70 (0.62-0.81) for controls (p < 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier and the Cox regression analysis for cases categorised by delivered dose showed an inverse relationship between dose and survival. The cases with RR in a LNL outside planning target volume (PTV) (D mean < 40 Gy) had an OS rate comparable to that of all patients, and those with RR in a LNL in PTVelective (D mean 40-60 Gy) or PTVtumour (D mean >60 Gy) did significantly worse (p < 0.05). The same inverse relationship was also shown for a small subset of patient with known HPV-status, defined by over expression of p16 (p < 0.05).;There was a significant risk reduction for RR of elective treatment. However the OS for patients with RR outside target volumes was not affected, with similar results for patients with HPV-positive OPC. This could be an argument for a prospective randomized study on limited elective target volumes in OPC.",
