We report the development of new allosteric inhibitors of mutant IDH1. Crystallographic and biochemical results demonstrated that compounds of this chemical series bind to an allosteric site and lock the enzyme in a catalytically inactive conformation, thereby enabling inhibition of different clinically relevant IDH1 mutants. Treatment of IDH1 mutant primary AML cells uniformly led to a decrease in intracellular 2-HG, abrogation of the myeloid differentiation block and induction of granulocytic differentiation at the level of leukemic blasts and more immature stem-like cells, in vitro and in vivo. Molecularly, treatment with the inhibitors led to a reversal of the DNA cytosine hypermethylation patterns caused by mutant IDH1 in the cells of individuals with AML. Our study provides proof of concept for the molecular and biological activity of novel allosteric inhibitors for targeting different mutant forms of IDH1 in leukemia. ",

Patients were also studied for NPM1, FLT3, MLL, and CEBPA mutations. The median follow-up for survival was 6.3 years.;IDH mutations were found in 129 patients (16.0%) -IDH1 in 61 patients (7.6%), and IDH2 in 70 patients (8.7%). Two patients had both IDH1 and IDH2 mutations. All but one IDH1 mutation caused substitutions of residue R132; IDH2 mutations caused changes of R140 (n = 48) or R172 (n = 22). IDH mutations were associated with older age (P < .001; effect conferred by IDH2 only); lower WBC (P = .04); higher platelets (P < .001); cytogenetically normal (CN) -AML (P< .001); and NPM1 mutations, in particular with the genotype of mutated NPM1 without FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD; P < .001). In patients with CN-AML with the latter genotype, IDH mutations adversely impacted relapse-free survival (RFS; P = .02) and overall survival (P = .03), whereas outcome was not affected in patients with CN-AML who lacked this genotype. In CN-AML, multivariable analyses revealed a significant interaction between IDH mutation and the genotype of mutated NPM1 without FLT3-ITD (ie, the adverse impact of IDH mutation [RFS]; P = .046 was restricted to this patient subset).;IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are recurring genetic changes in AML.

However, the effect of R-2HG released by IDH-mutated AML cells on the bone marrow microenvironment is unclear. Here, we report that R-2HG induces IκB kinase-independent activation of NF-κB in bone marrow stromal cells. R-2HG acts via a reactive oxygen species/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent pathway to phosphorylate NF-κB on the Thr254 residue. This phosphorylation enhances the interaction of NF-κB and the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase PIN1 and increases the protein stability and transcriptional activity of NF-κB. As a consequence, R-2HG enhances NF-κB-dependent expression of cytokines including IL-6, IL-8 and complement 5a to stimulate proliferation of AML cells. In addition, R-2HG also upregulates vascular endothelial adhesion molecule 1 and CXCR4 in stromal cells to enhance the contact between AML and stromal cells and attenuates chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. More importantly, we validated the R-2HG-activated gene signature in the primary bone marrow stromal cells isolated from IDH-mutated AML patients. Collectively, our results suggest that AML cell-derived R-2HG may be helpful for the establishment of a supportive bone marrow stromal niche to promote AML progression via paracrine stimulation. ",

While wild-type IDHs mediate exchanges between isocitrate and α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), mutant IDHs convert α-KG to oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which causes dysregulation of a set of α-KG-dependent dioxygenases such as TET, histone demethylase and others. Because mutant IDH has no necessary functions in normal cells, inhibitors directed against mutant IDH are not expected to have the side effects as anti-cancer agents. To determine whether mutant IDH enzymes are valid targets for cancer therapy, we created a mouse model of mutant IDH2-dependent AML. By using a combination of AML model mice with cre-loxp, we conditionally deleted mutant IDH2 from AML mice, which resulted in the loss of leukemia stem cells and significantly delayed the progression of AML. These results indicate that mutant IDHs are promising targets for anticancer therapy. ",

Of the 21 patients with IDH mutations, 4 (19%) were found to have single nucleotide variants in both IDH1 and IDH2. An additional patient included in the study was found to have two different IDH2 mutations. The mutations were typically present at different variant allelic frequencies, with one predominating over the other, consistent with the presence of multiple subclones in a single patient. In one case, the variant allelic frequencies in both IDH1 and IDH2 were equally low in the setting of a high percentage of blasts, suggesting that the IDH mutations were unlikely to be present in the founding clone. Given these data, we conclude that dual IDH1/2 mutations likely were previously underestimated, a finding that may carry important treatment implications. ",

Herein we investigated the functional role of miR-199b in AML and its prognostic implications.;Major approaches include transduction of hematopoietic stem cells and bone marrow transplantation, analyses of blood lineages, histone deacetylases (HDAC) inhibitors, and molecular and clinical data analyses of AML patients using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).;We first examined the relative miR-199b expression in steady state hematopoiesis and showed CD33(+) myeloid progenitors had the highest miR-199b expression. Further, silencing of miR-199b in CD34(+) cells resulted in significant increases in CFU-GM colonies. Via TCGA we analyzed the molecular and clinical characteristics of 166 AML cases to investigate a prognostic role for miR-199b. The Kaplan-Meier curves for high and low expression values of miR-199b and the observed distribution of miRNA expression revealed the highly expressed group had significantly better survival outcomes (p < 0.016, log rank test). Additionally, there was significant difference between miR-199b expression across the AML subtypes with particularly low expression found in the FAB-M5 subtype. Furthermore, FAB-M5 subtype showed a poor prognosis with a 1-year survival rate of only 25 %, compared with 51 % survival in the overall sample (p < 0.024). Furthermore, significant inverse correlation of HoxA7 and HoxB6 expression with miR-199b was observed in FAB-M5 AML patients. Molecular mutations were analyzed among miR-199b high and low AML cases. Significant correlations in terms of association and survival outcomes were observed for NPMc and IDH1 mutations. Treatment of THP-1 cells (represents M5-subtype) with HDAC inhibitors AR-42, Panobinostat, or Decitabine showed miR-199b expression was significantly elevated upon AR-42 and Panobinostat treatment. To further understand the hematopathological consequences of decreased miR-199b, we employed a bone-marrow transduce/transplant (BMT) mouse model. Interestingly, in vivo miR-199b silencing per-se in HSCs did not result in profound perturbations.;Loss of miR-199b can lead to myeloproliferation while HDAC inhibitors restore miR-199b expression and promote apoptosis.

The subsequent accumulation of 2-HG results in epigenetic dysregulation via inhibition of αKG-dependent histone and DNA demethylases, and a block in cellular differentiation. There is growing preclinical and clinical evidence suggesting that IDHmutations are involved in neoplasia. Furthermore, preclinical studies assessing small molecule inhibitors of mutant IDH1/2 enzymes have provided proof of concept that this approach decreases intracellular 2-HG levels, reverses epigenetic dysregulation and induces cellular differentiation. Phase I studies of mutant IDH inhibitors are currently ongoing in patients with IDH-mutant hematologic and solid tumors, with early data in hematologic tumors suggesting a manageable safety profile as well as clinical benefit, with a mechanism of action based on differentiation of malignant cells. Inhibition of mutant IDH shows promise as a treatment approach in hematologic malignancies, with further development ongoing in solid tumors and glioma. The mutant IDH inhibitors may have clinical utility both as single agents and in combination strategies that target additional oncogenic pathways.",

Mutations of IDH1 and IDH2 have been identified in patients with glioma, leukemia, and other cancers. However, the incidence of IDH mutations in acute myeloid leukemia in Taiwan is much lower than that reported in Western countries. The reason for the difference is unknown and its clinical implications remain unclear. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a heterogenous hematopoietic malignancy. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) results from chronic carcinogen exposures and is highly prevalent in trucking workers, especially in southern Taiwan. Subtypes of both diseases require specific treatments, and molecular markers for developing tailored treatments are limited. High-resolution melting (HRM) analysis is now a widely used methodology for rapid, accurate, and low-cost mutation scanning. In this study, 90 adults with OSC and 31 children with ALL were scanned by HRM analysis for IDH1 and IDH2 mutation hot spots. In ALL, the allele frequency was 3.23% in both IDH1 and IDH2. In OSCC, the allele frequency was 2.22% in IDH2. A synonymous mutation over pG313 (c.939A > G) of IDH2 was found in both pediatric ALL and adult OSCC. Therefore, we concluded that mutations of IDH are uncommon in ALL and OSCC and are apparently not a major consideration when selecting treatment modalities.",

The prognostic value of recently identified somatic mutations has not been systematically evaluated in a phase 3 trial of treatment for AML.;We performed a mutational analysis of 18 genes in 398 patients younger than 60 years of age who had AML and who were randomly assigned to receive induction therapy with high-dose or standard-dose daunorubicin. We validated our prognostic findings in an independent set of 104 patients.;We identified at least one somatic alteration in 97.3% of the patients. We found that internal tandem duplication in FLT3 (FLT3-ITD), partial tandem duplication in MLL (MLL-PTD), and mutations in ASXL1 and PHF6 were associated with reduced overall survival (P=0.001 for FLT3-ITD, P=0.009 for MLL-PTD, P=0.05 for ASXL1, and P=0.006 for PHF6); CEBPA and IDH2 mutations were associated with improved overall survival (P=0.05 for CEBPA and P=0.01 for IDH2). The favorable effect of NPM1 mutations was restricted to patients with co-occurring NPM1 and IDH1 or IDH2 mutations. We identified genetic predictors of outcome that improved risk stratification among patients with AML, independently of age, white-cell count, induction dose, and post-remission therapy, and validated the significance of these predictors in an independent cohort. High-dose daunorubicin, as compared with standard-dose daunorubicin, improved the rate of survival among patients with DNMT3A or NPM1 mutations or MLL translocations (P=0.001) but not among patients with wild-type DNMT3A, NPM1, and MLL (P=0.67).;We found that DNMT3A and NPM1 mutations and MLL translocations predicted an improved outcome with high-dose induction chemotherapy in patients with AML.

The primary objective of this study was to define the natural history and prognosis of patients with AML and IDH1 or IDH2 mutations and provide historical survival expectations. A total of 826 patients treated from 2010 to 2014 at a single institution were evaluated, including 167 patients (20%) with AML and IDH1 or IDH2 mutations. Median age was 62 years (range 18-92). There were 59 IDH1-R132, 83 IDH2-R140, and 23 IDH2-R172 mutations. Clinicopathologic characteristics associated with IDH-mutations included older age, less frequent therapy-related status, and increased incidence of intermediate-risk cytogenetics, FLT3-ITD mutations, and NPM1 mutations. Remission rates (CR/CRi) by AML treatment status were: induction, 68%; Salvage-1 (S1), 42%; and Salvage-2 and beyond (S2+), 27%. No difference in response was identified by IDH mutation status. Similarly, overall survival (OS) was not dependent on IDH status within any cohort. The median OS was 15.4 months in induction, 8.7 months in S1, and 4.8 months in S2+. This analysis defines the clinical outcome associated with IDH-mutations in both the front-line and salvage AML treatment settings, and confirms that response rate and OS for both IDH-mutated and IDH wild-type AML patients is comparable. This provides contemporary data to be used for comparison with results of novel investigational (e.g., selective IDH inhibitor) strategies.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Alterations to genes involved in cellular metabolism and epigenetic regulation are implicated in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies. Recurring mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes are detected in approximately 20% of adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 5% of adults with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). IDH proteins are homodimeric enzymes involved in diverse cellular processes, including adaptation to hypoxia, histone demethylation and DNA modification. The IDH2 protein is localized in the mitochondria and is a critical component of the tricarboxylic acid (also called the 'citric acid' or Krebs) cycle. Both IDH2 and IDH1 (localized in the cytoplasm) proteins catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). Mutant IDH enzymes have neomorphic activity and catalyze reduction of α-KG to the (R) enantiomer of 2-hydroxyglutarate, which is associated with DNA and histone hypermethylation, altered gene expression and blocked differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. The prognostic significance of mutant IDH (mIDH) is controversial but appears to be influenced by co-mutational status and the specific location of the mutation (IDH1-R132, IDH2-R140, IDH2-R172). Treatments specifically or indirectly targeted to mIDH are currently under clinical investigation; these therapies have been generally well tolerated and, when used as single agents, have shown promise for inducing responses in some mIDH patients when used as first-line treatment or in relapsed or refractory AML or MDS. Use of mIDH inhibitors in combination with drugs with non-overlapping mechanisms of action is especially promising, as such regimens may address the clonal heterogeneity and the multifactorial pathogenic processes involved in mIDH myeloid malignancies. Advances in mutational analysis have made testing more rapid and convenient, and less expensive; such testing should become part of routine diagnostic workup and repeated at relapse to identify patients who may benefit from treatments that target mIDH.Leukemia advance online publication, 11 November 2016; doi:10.1038/leu.2016.275.",

Zaprinast, a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor, was identified as an efficacious modulator of 2HG production and confirmed to lower 2HG levels in vivo. The mechanism of action was not due to cGMP stabilization, but rather, profiling of metabolites upstream of mutant IDH1 pointed to targeted inhibition of the enzyme glutaminase (GLS). Zaprinast treatment reversed histone hypermethylation and soft-agar growth of IDH1-mutant cells, and treatment of glutamine-addicted pancreatic cancer cells reduced growth and sensitized cells to oxidative damage. Thus, Zaprinast is efficacious against glutamine metabolism and further establishes the therapeutic linkages between GLS and 2HG-mediated oncogenesis.;Gain-of-function IDH mutations are common events in glioma, acute myelogenous leukemia, and other cancer types, which lead to the accumulation of the oncometabolite 2HG.

The prognostic impact of ASXL1 mutation and expression levels was evaluated in the context of other clinical and molecular prognostic markers.;Mutations in ASXL1 occurred with a frequency of 20.7% in MDS (n = 40 of 193) with 70% (n = 28) of mutations being frameshift mutations and 30% (n = 12) being heterozygous point mutations leading to translational changes. ASXL1 mutations were correlated with an intermediate-risk karyotype (P = .002) but not with other clinical parameters. The presence of ASXL1 mutations was associated with a shorter overall survival for frameshift and point mutations combined (hazard ratio [HR], 1.744; 95% CI, 1.08 to 2.82; P = .024) and for frameshift mutations only (HR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.21 to 3.50; P = .008). ASXL1 frameshift mutations were associated with a reduced time to progression of acute myeloid leukemia (AML; HR 2.35; 95% CI, 1.17 to 4.74; P = .017). In multivariate analysis, when considering karyotype, transfusion dependence, and IDH1 mutation status, ASXL1 frameshift mutations remained an independent prognostic marker in MDS (overall survival: HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.03 to 3.34; P = .040; time to AML progression: HR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.12 to 5.09; P = .024).;These results suggest that ASXL1 mutations are frequent molecular aberrations in MDS that predict an adverse prognostic outcome. Screening of patients for ASXL1 mutations might be useful for clinical risk stratification and treatment decisions in the future.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Recurrent gene mutations, chromosomal translocations, and acquired genomic copy number aberrations (aCNA) have been variously associated with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patient outcome. However, knowledge of the co-occurrence of such lesions and the relative influence of different types of genomic alterations on clinical outcomes in AML is still evolving.;We performed SNP 6.0 array-based genomic profiling of aCNA/copy neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (cnLOH) along with sequence analysis of 13 commonly mutated genes on purified leukemic blast DNA from 156 prospectively enrolled non-FAB-M3 AML patients across the clinical spectrum of de novo, secondary, and therapy-related AML.;TP53 and RUNX1 mutations are strongly associated with the presence of SNP-A-based aCNA/cnLOH, while FLT3 and NPM1 mutations are strongly associated with the absence of aCNA/cnLOH. The presence of mutations in RUNX1, ASXL1, and TP53, elevated SNP-A-based genomic complexity, and specific recurrent aCNAs predicted failure to achieve a complete response to induction chemotherapy. The presence of ≥1 aCNA/cnLOH and higher thresholds predicted for poor long-term survival irrespective of TP53 status, and the presence of ≥1 aCNA/cnLOH added negative prognostic information to knowledge of mutations in TET2, IDH1, NPM1, DNMT3A, and RUNX1. Results of multivariate analyses support a dominant role for TP53 mutations and a role for elevated genomic complexity as predictors of short survival in AML.;Integrated genomic profiling of a clinically relevant adult AML cohort identified genomic aberrations most associated with SNP-A-based genomic complexity, resistance to intensive induction therapies, and shortened overall survival. Identifying SNP-A-based lesions adds prognostic value to the status of several recurrently mutated genes.",

The effects of mutations in IDH2 on cellular metabolism, the epigenetic state of mutated cells, and cellular differentiation have been elucidated in vitro and in vivo. Mutations in IDH2 lead to an enzymatic gain of function that catalyzes the conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to beta-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Supranormal levels of 2-HG lead to hypermethylation of epigenetic targets and a subsequent block in cellular differentiation. AG-221, a small-molecule inhibitor of mutant IDH2, is being explored in a phase I clinical trial for the treatment of AML, other myeloid malignancies, solid tumors, and gliomas.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Aberrant DNA methylation is frequent in the myeloid malignancies, particularly myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Promoter CpG methylation is correlated with silencing of tumor-suppressor genes (TSGs) in specific pathways that are also targets of mutation or other mechanisms of inactivation, and is thought to contribute to disease progression and poor prognosis. Epigenetic contributions to myeloid pathogenesis are more complex. Examples include TSG inactivation and oncogenic activation associated with formation of altered chromatin separate from CpG methylation. Epigenetic dysregulation occurs at multiple disease stages and at non-CpG island genomic sites, and also includes genomic hypomethylation and small RNA mechanisms of epigenetic regulation. Identification of recurrent mutations in potential epigenetic regulators, including TET2, IDH1, IDH2, DNMT3A, UTX, and ASXL1, were recently described. Accordingly, therapeutics directed towards epigenetic mechanisms including methylation inhibitors and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have had some clinical success when applied to MDS and AML. However, identification of the underlying mechanisms associated with clinical responses and drug resistance remain enigmatic. Remarkably, in spite of significant molecular and translational progress, there are currently no epigenetic biomarkers in widespread clinical use. In this review, we explore the potential applications of epigenetic biomarker discovery, including epigenetic profiling for myeloid malignancy pathogenesis understanding, diagnostic classification, and development of effective treatment paradigms for these generally considered poor prognosis disorders.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDSs) are clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis that often develop into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). MDSs are predominant in the elderly with an incidence of 20/100000 at 70 years of age. To date, the only curative treatment is allogeneic stem cell transplantation; however, a majority of patients are not eligible for this therapy. Azacitidine (AZA), a hypomethylating agent, remains the primary treatment for MDS patients, which leads to a significant increase in overall survival (OS), although it is not curative. Although it is well known that the impairment of apoptosis and differentiation are important features of this complex disease, the implication of autophagy in the pathogenesis of MDS is an emerging concept. Another significant advance in MDS pathogenesis research is the recent identification of mutations in genes encoding transcription factors implicated in hematopoiesis and proteins involved in splicing (SF3B1), methylation (DNMT3A), regulation of methylation (TET2 and IDH), DNA conformation (EZH2 and ASXL1) and differentiation (N- and K-RAS). Additionally, BCL2 family member expression and regulation may also affect the physiopathology of this disease. We have recently reported that targeting autophagy may be an interesting option for the treatment of AZA-resistant patients. Thus, targeting the products of the above-mentioned genes or the signaling pathways affected by the corresponding proteins may be of great interest for the development of a new arsenal of molecules to fight MDS. In this review, we discuss the new aspects of MDS physiopathology and how recent advances in MDS pathogenesis research may impact future treatments to improve the outcome of MDS patients. ",
