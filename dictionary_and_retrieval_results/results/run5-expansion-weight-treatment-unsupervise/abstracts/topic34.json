The measurement of the MDM2 amplification can aid in classification and may provide a predictive value for recently formulated therapies targeting MDM2. We have developed and validated an automated bright field dual-color in situ hybridization application to detect MDM2 gene amplification.;A repeat-depleted MDM2 probe was constructed to target the MDM2 gene region at 12q15. A chromosome 12-specific probe (CHR12) was generated from a pα12H8 plasmid. The in situ hybridization assay was developed by using a dinitrophenyl-labeled MDM2 probe and a digoxigenin-labeled CHR12 probe on the Ventana Medical Systems' automated slide-staining platforms. The specificity of the MDM2 and CHR12 probes was shown on metaphase spreads and further validated against controls, including normal human tonsil and known MDM2-amplified samples. The assay performance was evaluated on a cohort of 100 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens by using a conventional bright field microscope.;Simultaneous hybridization and signal detection for MDM2 and CHR12 showed that both DNA targets were present in the same cells. One hundred soft tissue specimens were stained for MDM2 and CHR12. Although 26 of 29 lipomas were nonamplified and eusomic, MDM2 amplification was noted in 78% of atypical lipomatous tumors or well-differentiated liposarcomas. Five of 6 dedifferentiated liposarcoma cases were amplified for MDM2. MDM2 amplification was observed in 1 of 8 osteosarcomas; 3 showed CHR12 aneusomy. MDM2 amplification was present in 1 of 4 chondrosarcomas. Nine of 10 synovial sarcomas displayed no evidence of MDM2 amplification in most tumor cells. In pleomorphic sarcoma, not otherwise specified (pleomorphic malignant fibrous histiocytoma), MDM2 was amplified in 38% of cases, whereas 92% were aneusomic for CHR12. One alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and 2 embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas displayed low-level aneusomy of CHR12 without net MDM2 amplifications.;These results show that the use of the ISH MDM2 and CHR12 assay allows simultaneous analyses of the 2 DNA targets within the context of tissue morphology. This method combines the advantages of a fully automated protocol with bright field microscopy and has the potential for routine application in surgical pathology.",

Four types of genetic disorders can be distinguished: translocations, gene amplifications, mutations and complex genetic imbalances. Detection of these disorders may help in diagnosis and in determining prognosis. Detection of specific translocation is recommended in synovial sarcoma, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma or PNET diagnosis because of therapeutic consequences; in case of rarer histologic type (low grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, clear cell sarcoma, infantile fibrosarcoma...), it may confirm the diagnosis. In some cases, some translocations have a prognostic value (alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma) whereas it is discussed in others (synovial sarcoma). The techniques used to detect these translocations are very sensitive so it may be used to detect microscopical metastasis (bone marrow metastasis of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma for example). Detection of MDM2 and CDK4 genes amplifications (FISH or quantitative PCR) may be sometimes useful in well differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcomas diagnosis. Mutation detection of KIT or PDGFRA may help in GIST diagnosis and type of mutation is predictive of response to treatment. Study of complex genomic imbalances in sarcomas is not used in routine practice but remains useful in research.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The individual rarity of the many subtypes of soft tissue sarcomas has historically mandated an empiric approach to systemic therapy. Doxorubicin, first reported to have activity in sarcomas 40 years ago, remains the generalizable first-line treatment of choice for many subtypes, with no other drug or combination having shown an overall-survival advantage. Other cytotoxic agents, such as paclitaxel for angiosarcoma or gemcitabine with docetaxel for leiomyosarcoma, are commonly used for certain histologic subtypes based on relatively small studies. Trabectedin, particularly active against leiomyosarcoma and myxoid liposarcoma, is approved in many countries worldwide but not yet in the United States or Australia. Newer cytotoxic agents, including ifosfamide derivatives, are in current phase III testing. Although advances is systemic therapy of soft-tissue sarcomas have been hampered by their biologic heterogeneity, this diversity also serves as fertile ground for discovery and validation of targetable molecular drivers. The most notable success in this regard has been the development of small molecule therapies for gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Other targets of recent interest include mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) in dedifferentiated liposarcoma and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. Molecular therapies that have shown activity in diverse sarcoma populations include mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-R) inhibitors. Among the latter, pazopanib demonstrated a progression-free survival over placebo in prior-treated patients with advanced sarcoma, and is now approved for use in the sarcomas in many countries. Efforts to understand the key molecular aberrations in any particular tumor continue towards a goal of individualized sarcoma therapy. ",

Six high-grade miscellaneous sarcomas were also examined.;The dedifferentiated liposarcoma had complex karyotypes and MDM2 amplification by FISH, and of these, 5 tumors with myxoid changes also had complex signals for DDIT3. All but 4 myxoid liposarcomas had complex karyotypes, in addition to the characteristic translocation. FISH analysis displayed DD1T3 rearrangement. All synovial sarcomas except 1 recurrence had a t(X;18) translocation by karyotyping and FISH. The EWSR1 rearrangement was present in all extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas, angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma, atypical Ewing sarcoma, and a clear-cell sarcoma, all of which had characteristic karyotypes. Seven high-grade sarcomas had no specific karyotype or rearrangements for DDIT3, SS18, and EWSR1 by FISH.;There is good correlation between karyotyping and FISH. Complex FISH signals found in dedifferentiated liposarcomas may be related to an increased chromosome 12 copy number and ploidy. Karyotyping is an important baseline standard for the quality assurance of newly developed FISH probes. It also provides a global view of chromosomal changes and the opportunity to investigate the role of other genetic alterations and potential therapeutic targets.",

Both MDM2 and MDM4 were also amplified in a subtype-specific manner, which was frequently seen as a coamplification event. We have also analyzed the risk allele frequencies for MDM2 SNP309, and show that the G allele was strongly associated with both liposarcomas and MDM2 amplification.;Our data emphasize the critical role of p53 inactivation in sarcomagenesis, whereby different pathway alterations may be related to the heterogeneity of the disease. Moreover, we observed a strong association of malignancy with TP53 mutation, or MDM2 amplification and the presence of a G allele in SNP309, especially in lipoma versus liposarcoma.

The median tumor size was 10.9 cm (range: 3 to 30 cm). Six cases were low-grade DDL, 28 were high-grade DDL, and in 8 cases both coexisted.

While targeted therapy based on tyrosine kinase inhibition such as imatinib and second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors plays an important role in the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), some progress was also achieved in non-GIST sarcomas. Targeting the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway has been shown to be clinically promising in a diversity of different sarcoma subtypes, and inhibition of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor pathway is of special interest in vascular sarcoma subtypes.

Some effect of Nutlin was also observed on cell lines without amplified MDM2 but with wt TP53, but no apoptosis was induced.

Especially malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) reveals a reduced ifosfamide (IF) chemosensitivity when compared to other sarcoma entities. This is the first study to analyze MFH cells for the effects of IF on the expression of the pathways P16-CDK4-Rb and P14ARF-MDM2-P73 regulating cell cycle. The aim was to identify candidate genes possibly involved in the anti-apoptotic response of p53-deficient MFH cells during chemotherapy. PCR, real-time RT-PCR and confocal laser scanning microscopy were applied on primary cultures of MFH cells containing defective p53 genes. The cultures were treated with different concentrations of IF. A non-treated MFH culture served as negative control. A threshold concentration of IF (100 microM) was determined sparing the majority of the cells (99%), whereas higher IF quantities caused complete apoptosis. Data collected over a period of 48 h showed that the MFH cells surviving 100 microM IF overexpressed the kinase gene CDK4 and oncogene MDM2 by a factor of 63. A similar strong increase was observed at the protein level for both proteins. In contrast, the other proteins analyzed were not detectable. Additionally, the MFH cells induced complex patterns of MDM2 mRNA splicing and an abnormal mRNA transcript carrying a novel MDM2 missense mutation. These effects were neither observed in the non-treated culture nor in cultures completely inducing spontaneous apoptosis. Therefore, we speculate that the induction of the gene CDK4, and especially of MDM2, is involved in anti-apoptotic mechanisms of p53-negative MFH cells tolerating IF in vitro. Further experiments are necessary to test whether the novel candidate genes favor development of chemoresistance and whether MDM2 mRNA splicing variants contribute to this process in vivo.",

However, the majority of human sarcomas have normal level of MDM2 and the therapeutic potential of MDM2 antagonists in this group is still unclear. We have investigated if Nutlin-3a could be employed to augment the response to traditional therapy and/or reduce the genotoxic burden of chemotherapy.;A panel of sarcoma cell lines with different TP53 and MDM2 status were treated with Nutlin-3a combined with Doxorubicin, Methotrexate or Cisplatin, and their combination index determined.;Clear synergism was observed when Doxorubicin and Nutlin-3a were combined in cell lines with wild-type TP53 and amplified MDM2, or with Methotrexate in both MDM2 normal and amplified sarcoma cell lines, allowing for up to tenfold reduction of cytotoxic drug dose. Interestingly, Nutlin-3a seemed to potentiate the effect of classical drugs as Doxorubicin and Cisplatin in cell lines with mutated TP53, but inhibited the effect of Methotrexate.;The use of Nutlin in combination with classical sarcoma chemotherapy shows promising preclinical potential, but since clear biomarkers are still lacking, clinical trials should be followed up with detailed tumour profiling.",

Histological diagnosis is often difficult because of the numerous types and subtypes reported and morphological similarities with benign lesions in certain cases. Molecular analyses performed in an appropriate clinical and histological context improve the patients' management in the case of sarcomas with simple genomic profile: the identification of a specific and objective molecular abnormality can confirm a diagnosis, rule out another one, provide prognostic information, and guide the selection of targeted therapy About 15% of sarcomas bear a specific translocation that can be identified by FISH or RT-PCR. The search for a MDM2 amplification, reflecting the presence of an amplicon in the 12q region, is a sensitive and specific tool for the diagnosis of atypical lipomatous tumors/well-differentiated liposarcomas and dedifferentiated iposarcomas.

Liposarcoma, a type of soft tissue sarcoma in adults, account for approximately 20% of all adult soft tissue sarcomas. There are no effective chemotherapies for majority of these tumors. Efforts made to define the molecular basis of liposarcomas lead to the finding that besides the amplifications of CDK4 and MDM2, Aurora Kinase A, also was shown to be overexpressed. Based on these as well as mathematic modeling, we have carried out a successful preclinical study using CDK4 and IGF1R inhibitors in liposarcoma. MLN8237 has been shown to be a potent and selective inhibitor of Aurora A. MLN-8237, as per our results, induces a differential inhibition of Aurora A and B in a dose dependent manner. At a low nanomolar dose, cellular effects such as induction of phospho-Histone H3 (Ser10) mimicked as that of the inhibition of Aurora kinase A followed by apoptosis. However, micromolar dose of MLN-8237 induced polyploidy, a hallmark effect of Aurora B inhibition. The dose dependent selectivity of inhibition was further confirmed by using siRNA specific inhibition of Aurora A and B. This was further tested by time lapse microscopy of GFP-H2B labelled cells treated with MLN-8237. LS141 xenograft model at a dose of 30 mg/kg also showed efficient growth suppression by selective inhibition of Aurora Kinase A. Based on our data, a dose that can target only Aurora A will be more beneficial in tumor suppression. ",

In this study, we examined the molecular mechanisms underlying the sensitivity of sarcomas to Nutlin-3a. In an ex vivo tissue explant system, we found that TP53 pathway alterations (TP53 status, MDM2/MDM4 genomic amplification/mRNA overexpression, MDM2 SNP309, and TP53 SNP72) did not confer apoptotic or cytostatic responses in sarcoma tissue biopsies (n = 24). Unexpectedly, MDM2 status did not predict Nutlin-3a sensitivity. RNA sequencing revealed that the global transcriptomic profiles of these sarcomas provided a more robust prediction of apoptotic responses to Nutlin-3a. Expression profiling revealed a subset of TP53 target genes that were transactivated specifically in sarcomas that were highly sensitive to Nutlin-3a. Of these target genes, the GADD45A promoter region was shown to be hypermethylated in 82% of wild-type TP53 sarcomas that did not respond to Nutlin-3a, thereby providing mechanistic insight into the innate ability of sarcomas to resist apoptotic death following Nutlin-3a treatment. Collectively, our findings argue that the existing benchmark biomarker for MDM2 antagonist efficacy (MDM2 amplification) should not be used to predict outcome but rather global gene expression profiles and epigenetic status of sarcomas dictate their sensitivity to p53/MDM2 antagonists.",

Histologically, liposarcomas themselves are heterogeneous and fall into four distinct subtypes: well-differentiated/atypical lipomatous tumor, dedifferentiated liposarcoma, myxoid (round cell) liposarcoma, and pleomorphic liposarcoma. Surgical resection with negative margins remains the mainstay for definitive treatment for operable disease. For unresectable disease, retrospective studies have identified myxoid (round cell) and pleomorphic sarcomas to be relatively responsive to chemotherapy. Recent studies have identified distinct genetic aberrations that not only aid in the diagnosis of particular liposarcoma subtypes, but represent actionable targets as they are considered central to disease pathogenesis. Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and murine double minute 2 (MDM2) are overexpressed in well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcomas and offer tantalizing opportunities that are being pursued in clinical trials. Myxoid (round cell) liposarcomas appear to be sensitive to trabectedin, which is currently under U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review.

Overexpression of the MDM2 protein is associated with a poorer prognosis for STS patients. An MDM2 antisense approach to reduce MDM2 protein levels has been successfully applied on several carcinomas in vitro and used on a few in vivo cases. However, antisense treatment not only resulted in an MDM2 protein reduction but also in a wild-type P53 gene (wt-P53) mediated tumor growth suppression due to its genetic wt-P53 status. In this study, we used a clinically relevant xenotransplanted STS model with a mutated P53 gene (mt-P53) in order to exclude the influence of wt-P53. The human STSs were surgically implanted and one week later osmotic pumps were implanted intraperitoneally into nude rats releasing MDM2-antisense ODNs (AS ODNs) continuously for one week. As controls MDM2-sense ODN (SE ODN) or a 0.9% NaCl solution (saline solution) were administered. After one week animals treated with MDM2-AS ODN (100 or 200 microg) showed a reduction in tumor mass in comparison to animals treated with MDM2-SE ODN. The reduction in tumor mass was significant in animals treated with MDM2-AS ODNs in comparison to the saline solution treated ones (p=0.018 or p=0.007). Furthermore, a significant reduction in macroscopically visible tumor number with MDM2-AS ODN treatments (100 or 200 microg) in comparison to MDM2-SE ODN or saline solution treatment (both p=0.009) was observed for the first time. As expected a reduction in MDM2 protein expression in the MDM2-AS ODN treated tumors when compared to the MDM2-SE ODN or saline solution treated tumors was detected in Western blot analyses and immunohistochemically. In addition, an unexpected reduction in mt-P53 protein expression after AS ODN therapy was also observed. In short, we have demonstrated in vivo for the first time that MDM2-AS ODN treatment of xenotransplanted STS (mt-P53) reduces tumor mass, tumor number, MDM2 protein and mt-P53 protein expression. Our findings support the hypothesis that MDM2-AS ODN treatment may exert a tumor inhibiting effect on all MDM2 expressing tumors regardless of the P53-status, this in turn may be of general importance in gene therapy of cancer.",

There are no current therapies effective against the aggressive, KSHV-induced PEL. Here we demonstrate that activation of the p53 pathway using murine double minute 2 (MDM2) inhibitor Nutlin-3a conveyed specific and highly potent activation of PEL cell killing. Our results demonstrated that the KSHV latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) bound to both p53 and MDM2 and that the MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3a disrupted the p53-MDM2-LANA complex and selectively induced massive apoptosis in PEL cells. Together with our results indicating that KSHV-infection activated DNA damage signaling, these findings contribute to the specificity of the cytotoxic effects of Nutlin-3a in KSHV-infected cells. Moreover, we showed that Nutlin-3a had striking antitumor activity in vivo in a mouse xenograft model.

Transcriptome sequencing techniques have brought forward new diagnostic tools for identifying fusions and/or characterizing unclassified entities. Next-generation sequencing and advanced molecular techniques were also applied to identify potential targets for directed and epigenetic therapy, where preclinical studies reported results for agents active within the receptor tyrosine kinase, mTOR, Notch, Wnt, Hedgehog, Hsp90, and MDM2 signaling networks. At the level of clinical practice, modest developments were seen for some sarcoma subtypes in conventional chemotherapy and in therapies targeting the pathways activated by various receptor tyrosine kinases. In the burgeoning field of immune therapy, sarcoma work is in its infancy; however, elaborate protocols for immune stimulation are being explored, and checkpoint blockade agents advance from preclinical models to clinical studies.",

        "Doc_abstract":"A peculiar feature of several types of childhood cancer is that loss-of-function mutations of the TP53 (p53) tumor suppressor gene are uncommon, in contrast to many adult tumors. As p53 needs to be inactivated in order for tumor cells to survive and thrive, pediatric tumors typically make use of other mechanisms to keep p53 in check. One of the critical negative regulators of p53 is the MDM2 oncoprotein. Many anticancer drug development efforts in the past decade have therefore been devoted to the discovery and optimization of small molecules that selectively disrupt the interaction between MDM2 and p53, which could provide, in principle, a potent means to restore p53 function in tumor cells with wild-type p53. The nutlins are the class of selective inhibitors of the p53-MDM2 interaction that are currently most advanced in their clinical development. We review here the preclinical data that support the potential therapeutic use of nutlin drugs in the treatment of various pediatric tumors, including neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, medulloblastoma, and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",

They share simple karyotypes with supernumerary ring chromosomes or giant marker chromosomes containing amplified 12q sequences including MDM2 and CDK4 genes, with subsequent overexpression of MDM2 and CDK4 proteins. We present the case of a parosteal osteoliposarcoma made of closely intermingled components of a low-grade osteosarcoma and a WDLPS.;In a 34 year-old woman with a slowly growing mass of the arm, imaging revealed a large well-defined heterogeneous parosteal mass of the upper humerus, with two main components: bone at the base and fat at the periphery.

Given the low cell content of this tumor type, we utilized flow cytometry to isolate the diploid normal and aneuploid tumor populations from a well-differentiated liposarcoma prior to array comparative genomic hybridization and whole genome sequencing. This work revealed massive highly focal amplifications throughout the aneuploid tumor genome including MDM2, a gene that has previously been found to be amplified in well-differentiated liposarcoma. Structural analysis revealed massive rearrangement of chromosome 12 and 11 gene fusions, some of which may be part of double minute chromosomes commonly present in well-differentiated liposarcoma. We identified a hotspot of genomic instability localized to a region of chromosome 12 that includes a highly conserved, putative L1 retrotransposon element, LOC100507498 which resides within a gene cluster (NAV3, SYT1, PAWR) where 6 of the 11 fusion events occurred. Interestingly, a potential gene fusion was also identified in amplified DDR2, which is a potential therapeutic target of kinase inhibitors such as dastinib, that are not routinely used in the treatment of patients with liposarcoma. Furthermore, 7 somatic, damaging single nucleotide variants have also been identified, including D125N in the PTPRQ protein.

Four resected lungs, one endarterectomy specimen and three biopsies from eight patients (four males and four females; median age 41 years) suffering from intimal sarcomas of the pulmonary artery using conventional stains, immunohistochemistry, and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) were analyzed. The predominant clinical presentation was dyspnea (all eight patients) and febrile pulmonary disease (six of eight). Signs of embolic lung disease were present in all patients. One patient died postoperatively, six patients died of disease 8-35 months after presentation, and one patient was alive 6 months after surgery. Histopathological examination of the submitted material showed spindle cell, partially myxoid and pleomorphic sarcomas. Metastases were histologically confirmed in three patients (lung, pleura, and skull). Immunohistochemically, vimentin was strongly expressed in all tumors. Focal positivity was observed for alpha smooth muscle actin, CD117, CD68, p53, and bcl2. No reaction could be obtained for endothelial markers. The proliferation index Ki-67 was between 5% and 80%. Six examined tumors were positive for mdm2. In the CGH analysis, gains and amplifications in the 12q13-14 region were found in six of eight tumors (75%). Other, less consistent alterations, were losses on 3p, 3q, 4q, 9p, 11q, 13q, Xp, and Xq, gains on 7p, 17p, and 17q, and amplifications on 4q, 5p, 6p, and 11q. Intimal sarcomas of the pulmonary artery are tumors with an unfavorable prognosis and poorly differentiated morphology. A majority of tumors show a consistent genetic alteration (gains and amplifications in the 12q13-14 region) and overexpression of mdm2, implicating the mdm2/p53 pathway as a possible mechanism in the tumor pathogenesis.",

Although there are some conflicting data about the effects of MDM2 expression in individual cancers, the overall evidence is convincing, indicating that increased MDM2 expression is related to a worse clinical prognosis. There is an increased likelihood of distant metastases, as well as a decreased response to therapeutic intervention in MDM2-positive cancers. MDM2 may also serve as a diagnostic marker, not only for cancer stage, but to differentiate between similar cancers. MDM2 may also be associated with drug resistance in cancer chemotherapy.

The p53-MDM2 interaction pathway has been suggested as a novel target for cancer therapy. To that end, several strategies have been explored, including the use of small polypeptides targeted to the MDM2-p53 binding domain, anti-MDM2 antisense oligonucleotides, and natural agents. Different generations of anti-human-MDM2 oligonucleotides have been tested in in vitro and in vivo human cancer models, revealing specific inhibition of MDM2 expression and significant antitumor activity. Use of antisense oligos potentiated the effects of growth inhibition, p53 activation and p21 induction by several chemotherapeutic agents. Increased therapeutic effectiveness of chemotherapeutic drugs in human cancer cell lines carrying p53 mutations or deletions have shown the ability of MDM2 inhibitors to act as chemosensitizers in various types of tumors through both p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms. Inhibiting MDM2 appears to also have a role in radiation therapy for human cancer, regardless of p53 status, providing a rationale for the development of a new class of radiosensitizers. Moreover, MDM2 antisense oligonucleotides potentiate the effect of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors by affecting in vitro and in vivo proliferation, apoptosis and protein expression in hormone-refractory and hormone-dependent human prostate cancer cells. These data support the development, among other MDM2 inhibitors, of anti-MDM2 antisense oligonucleotides as a novel class of anticancer agents, and suggest a potentially relevant role for the oligonucleotides when integrated with conventional treatments and/or other signaling inhibitors in novel therapeutic strategies.",

These results define for the first time the specific cellular pathways involved in AIDS-related tumorigenesis and suggest specific novel targets for the treatment. Furthermore, we found that MAP30 downregulates the expression of egr-1, ATF-2, hsp27, hsp90, IkappaB, mdm2, and Skp1, while it upregulates the pro-apoptotic-related genes Bax, CRADD, and caspase-3. Thus, MAP30 modulates the expression of both viral and cellular genes involved in KS pathogenesis. These results provide valuable insight into the molecular mechanisms of MAP30 anti-KS action and suggest its utility as a therapeutic agent against AIDS-related tumors.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Rhabdomyosarcomas are a heterogeneous group of malignant tumors and are the most common soft-tissue sarcoma of childhood. Rhabdomyosarcomas resemble developing skeletal muscle, notably in their expression of the MRF family of transcription factors and the PAX3 and PAX7 genes. These PAX genes are also involved through specific translocations, t(2;13)(q35;q14) and variant t(1;13)(p36;q14) in the alveolar subtype, which result in PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR fusion genes, respectively. The fusion genes are thought critically to affect downstream targets of PAX3 and PAX7 or possibly have novel targets. Similar downstream changes may also be involved in embryonal and fusion gene negative cases. Genomic amplification of such genes as MYCN, MDM2, CDK4, and PAX7-FKHR is a feature mainly of the alveolar subtype, while specific chromosomal gains, including chromosomes 2, 8, 12, and 13, are associated with the embryonal subtype. Loss of alleles and imprinting at 11p15.5 and disruption of genes such as IGF2, ATR, PTC, P16, and TP53 have also been implicated in rhabdomyosarcoma development. Whereas there is now a realistic possibility of cure in the majority of cases, there remains a subset that is resistant to multimodality therapy, including high-dose chemotherapy. Characterization of the defining molecular features of tumors that are likely to behave aggressively represents a particular challenge. Current research is leading toward a better understanding of rhabdomyosarcoma tumorigenesis, which may ultimately result in novel therapeutic strategies that increase the overall cure.

        "Doc_abstract":"The MDM2 oncogene is amplified or overexpressed in human cancers. It has also been suggested that MDM2 levels are associated with poor prognosis of several human cancers. The MDM2 oncoprotein binds to the p53 tumor suppressor protein and serves as a negative regulator of p53. The p53 tumor suppressor also has an important role in cancer therapy, with p53-mediated apoptosis being a major mechanism of action for many clinically used cancer chemotherapeutic agents and radiation therapy. Therefore, the negative regulation of p53 by MDM2 may limit the magnitude of p53 activation by DNA damaging agents, thereby limiting their therapeutic effectiveness. The investigators hypothesize that, by inhibiting MDM2 expression, the MDM2 oncoprotein level will be reduced and the MDM2 negative feedback inhibition of p53 will be diminished, resulting in a significant increase of functional p53 levels that will modulate p53-mediated therapeutic effects. The overall objective of the present study was to investigate the functions of MDM2 oncogene in tumor growth and the potential value of MDM2 as a drug target for cancer therapy. The role of MDM2 in tumor growth is determined by inhibiting MDM2 expression in in vivo models of human cancers. The in vivo synergistically therapeutic effects of MDM2 inhibition and DNA damaging agents were also evaluated. Significant in vitro antitumor activities were found in cell lines, human osteosarcoma SJSA and choriocarcinoma JAR, in a time-, concentration-, and sequence-dependent manner. Following i.p. administration of anti-MDM2 antisense oligonucleotides, in vivo antitumor activity was observed in nude mice bearing SJSA and JAR xenografts in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, in vivo synergistically therapeutic effects of MDM2 inhibition and DNA damaging agents adriamycin and 10-hydroxycamptothecin were observed. This study should provide the basis for future development of anti-MDM2 antisense oligonucleotides as cancer therapeutic agents used alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapeutics.",

DDL is defined as nonlipogenic sarcoma that is juxtaposed to WDL, occurs as a recurrence of WDL or which can arise de novo, and typically has the appearance of undifferentiated pleomorphic or spindle cell sarcoma.

However, not all tumors respond favorably to these drugs. CDK4 activity is critical for progression through G1 phase and into the mitotic cell cycle. Inhibiting this kinase induces Rb-positive cells to exit the cell cycle into either a quiescent or senescent state. In this report, using well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma (WD/DDLS) cell lines, we show that the proteolytic turnover of MDM2 is required for CDK4i-induced senescence. Failure to reduce MDM2 does not prevent CDK4i-induced withdrawal from the cell cycle but the cells remain in a reversible quiescent state. Reducing MDM2 in these cells drives them into the more stable senescent state. CDK4i-induced senescence associated with loss of MDM2 is also observed in some breast cancer, lung cancer and glioma cell lines indicating that this is not limited to WD/DDLS cells in which MDM2 is overexpressed or in cells that contain wild type p53. MDM2 turnover depends on its E3 ligase activity and expression of ATRX. Interestingly, in seven patients the changes in MDM2 expression were correlated with outcome. These insights identify MDM2 and ATRX as new regulators controlling geroconversion, the process by which quiescent cells become senescent, and this insight may be exploited to improve the activity of CDK4i in cancer therapy.",

We analyzed LPS genomic landscape using SNP arrays, whole exome sequencing and targeted exome sequencing to uncover the genomic information for development of specific anti-cancer targets. SNP array analysis indicated known amplified genes (MDM2, CDK4, HMGA2) and important novel genes (UAP1, MIR557, LAMA4, CPM, IGF2, ERBB3, IGF1R). Carboxypeptidase M (CPM), recurrently amplified gene in well-differentiated/de-differentiated LPS was noted as a putative oncogene involved in the EGFR pathway. Notable deletions were found at chromosome 1p (RUNX3, ARID1A), chromosome 11q (ATM, CHEK1) and chromosome 13q14.2 (MIR15A, MIR16-1).

Further, in vitro and in vivo functional studies provided evidence for the tumor suppressor role for Neurofibromin 1 (NF1) gene in different subtypes of LPS. Pathway analysis of recurrent mutations demonstrated signaling through MAPK, JAK-STAT, Wnt, ErbB, axon guidance, apoptosis, DNA damage repair and cell cycle pathways were involved in liposarcomagenesis. Interestingly, we also found mutational and copy number heterogeneity within a primary LPS tumor signifying the importance of multi-region sequencing for cancer-genome guided therapy. In summary, these findings provide insight into the genomic complexity of LPS and highlight potential druggable pathways for targeted therapeutic approach. ",

This convergent evolution reflects the common need of these viruses to inactivate these two important regulators of cell cycle progression and cell survival. Polyomavirus, a close relative of SV40, is different. Its large T protein complexes only with RB, not with p53. We have examined whether this is compensated by the frequent appearance of p53 mutations in polyomavirus-induced tumours. We tested the p53 status of 15 polyomavirus-induced sarcomas. Two sarcomas were p53-negative while six carried mutant p53. Another six sarcomas expressed low levels of wild-type p53. One tumour expressed high levels of wild-type p53 protein as shown by DNA sequencing and immunofluorescence staining. MDM2 amplification was not detected in any of the tumours, but Northern blotting showed that MDM2 was overexpressed in at least two tumours that expressed wild-type p53 and in one tumour that expressed both wild-type and mutant p53. Treatment with the DNA-damaging agent mitomycin C caused p53 protein accumulation followed by induction of MDM2 and WAF1/p21 mRNA in four of the tumours expressing wild-type p53, indicating that p53-mediated transcriptional activation was unaltered in these tumours. However, p53-mediated transactivation of WAF1/p21 was impaired in the wild-type p53-expressing tumours that expressed elevated levels of MDM2.

This analysis reveals a bilateral belt-type interaction that results in inhibition of HAUSP. The vif1 peptide binds the HAUSP TRAF domain, competitively blocking substrate binding, whereas the vif2 peptide binds both the HAUSP TRAF and catalytic domains, robustly suppressing its deubiquitination activity. Peptide treatments comprehensively blocked HAUSP, leading to p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in culture and to tumor regression in xenograft mouse model. Thus, the virus has developed a unique strategy to target the HAUSP-MDM2-p53 pathway, and these virus-derived short peptides represent biologically active HAUSP antagonists.",

Consequently, there is nothing to offer patients with inoperable tumours and metastatic disease. The aim of this study is to investigate genes involved in cell cycle control: CDK4, CDKN2A/p16, cyclin D1, p21, p53, MDM2 and c-MYC, which may point towards new therapeutic strategies. The pRb pathway was targeted using CDKN2A/p16 overexpressing vectors and shRNA against CDK4 in chondrosarcoma cell lines OUMS27, SW1353, and CH2879. Cell survival and proliferation were assessed. CDK4, MDM2 and c-MYC expression levels were investigated by qPCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 34 fresh frozen and 90 FFPE samples of enchondroma and chondrosarcoma patients. On a subset of 29 high-grade chondrosarcomas IHC for cyclin D1, p21 and p53 was performed. The overexpression of CDKN2A/p16 and knockdown of CDK4 by shRNA in OUMS27, SW1353 and CH2879 resulted in a significant decrease in cell viability and proliferation and a decreased ability to form colonies in vitro. Expression of CDK4 and MDM2 was associated with high-grade chondrosarcoma both at the mRNA and protein level. Combining these results with the expression of cyclin D1 and the previously shown loss of CDKN2A/p16 expression show that the majority (96%; 28/29) of high-grade chondrosarcomas contain alterations in the pRb pathway. This suggests a role for the use of CDK4 inhibitors as a treatment of metastatic or inoperable high-grade chondrosarcoma.",

We have previously shown that E2F-1 overexpression induces apoptosis of MDM2-overexpressing sarcoma cells, which is related to the inhibition of MDM2 expression. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the in vitro and in vivo effect of combined treatment of adenovirus-mediated E2F-1 and topoisomerase II inhibitors on the growth inhibition and apoptosis in human sarcoma cells. Two human sarcoma cell lines, OsACL and U2OS, were treated with topoisomerase II inhibitors (Etoposide and Adriamycin), alone or in combination with adenoviral vectors expressing beta-galactosidase (Ad-LacZ) or E2F-1 (Ad-E2F-1). E2F-1 expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Ad-E2F-1 gene transfer at a low dose (multiplicity of infection, 2) markedly increased the sensitivity of human sarcoma cells to topoisomerase II inhibitor treatment. This cooperative effect of E2F-1 and topoisomerase II inhibitors was less marked in SAOS-2 cells (p53 and pRb null). Topoisomerase II inhibitors also cooperated with E2F-1 overexpression to enhance tumor cell killing in an in vivo model using xenografts in nude mice. When combined with Adriamycin or Etoposide, E2F-1 adenovirus therapy resulted in approximately 95% and 85% decrease in tumor size, respectively, compared to controls (P<.05). These results suggest a new chemosensitization strategy that is effective in MDM2-overexpressing tumors and may have clinical utility.",

Introduction of wild type p53 resulted in re expression of the osteocalcin gene. Using gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a putative p53 binding site within the rat OC promoter region and observed an increase in OC promoter activity when p53 accumulates using a CAT assay. The p53 inducible gene Mdm2 is a well-known downstream regulator of p53 levels. Our results showed a synergistic increase in the OC promoter activity when both p53 and MDM2 were transiently overexpressed. We further demonstrate that p53 is not degraded during overexpression of MDM2 protein. Increased OC expression was observed with concomitantly increased p53, VDR, and MDM2 levels in ROS17/2.8 cells during treatment with differentiation promoting (DP) media, but was significantly decreased when co-treated with DP media and the small molecule inhibitor of MDM2-p53 interaction, Nutlin-3. We have also observed a dramatic increase of the OC promoter activity in the presence of p53 and Mdm2 with inclusion of Cbfa-1 and p300 factors.

Targeted disruption of the p53-MDM2 interaction by Nutlin-3a stabilizes p53 and selectively activates the p53 pathway only in OS cells with wild-type p53, resulting in a pronounced anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effect due to G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. p53 dependence of these alternative outcomes of Nutlin-3a treatment was shown by the abrogation of these effects when p53 was knocked-down by small interfering RNA.

Unfavourable prognosis is indicated by less than 90% estimated necrosis of the tumor. Neither genetic testing nor molecular biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis have been described for osteosarcomas. We used the novel nanoString mRNA digital expression analysis system to analyse gene expression in 32 patients with sporadic paediatric osteosarcoma. This system used specific molecular barcodes to quantify expression of a set of 17 genes associated with osteosarcoma tumorigenesis. Five genes, from this panel, which encoded the bone differentiation regulator RUNX2, the cell cycle regulator CDC5L, the TP53 transcriptional inactivator MDM2, the DNA helicase RECQL4, and the cyclin-dependent kinase gene CDK4, were differentially expressed in tumors that responded poorly to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Analysis of the signalling relationships of these genes, as well as other expression markers of osteosarcoma, indicated that gene networks linked to RB1, TP53, PI3K, PTEN/Akt, myc and RECQL4 are associated with osteosarcoma. The discovery of these networks provides a basis for further experimental studies of role of the five genes (RUNX2, CDC5L, MDM2, RECQL4, and CDK4) in differential response to chemotherapy. ",

Here, we explore the importance of MDM2 amplification and p53 mutation in LPS independently, to determine whether HDACi are therapeutically useful in LPS. We demonstrated that simultaneous knockdown of MDM2 and p53 in p53-mutant LPS lines resulted in increased apoptosis, anti-proliferative effects, and cell cycle arrest, as compared to either intervention alone. HDACi treatment resulted in the dephosphorylation and depletion of MDM2 and p53 without affecting CDK4 and JUN expression, irrespective of p53 mutational status in MDM2-amplified LPS. In control mesothelioma cell lines, HDACi treatment resulted in down-regulation of p53 in the p53 mutant cell line JMN1B, but resulted in no changes of MDM2 and p53 in two mesothelioma lines with normal MDM2 and wild-type p53. HDACi treatment substantially decreased LPS and mesothelioma proliferation and survival, and was associated with upregulation of PTEN and p21, and inactivation of AKT. Our findings indicate that wild-type p53 depletion by HDACi is MDM2 amplification-dependent. These findings underscore the importance of targeting both MDM2 and p53 in LPS and other cancers harboring p53 mutations.

Rarely, however, primary retroperitoneal liposarcoma is classified as myxoid/round cell liposarcoma, based on the presence of myxoid areas and vascular crow's feet pattern, which has resulted in a debate on the classification of liposarcoma in the retroperitoneum. Genetically, myxoid/round cell liposarcoma and well-/dedifferentiated liposarcoma are different diseases. Myxoid/round cell liposarcoma is characterized by a translocation causing FUS-CHOP or EWSR1-CHOP fusion, whereas well-/dedifferentiated liposarcoma is characterized by an amplification of the 12q13-15 region, including MDM2 and CDK4 genes. As myxoid/round cell liposarcoma is highly radio- and chemosensitive, differentiation between subtypes is important to optimize treatment. We studied whether primary retroperitoneal liposarcomas diagnosed as myxoid/round cell liposarcoma represent molecularly true myxoid/round cell liposarcoma or are histopathological mimics and represent well-/dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Primary retroperitoneal myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (n=16) were compared to primary extremity myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (n=20). Histopathological and immunohistochemical features were studied. Amplification status of the 12q13-15 region was studied using a multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis, and FUS-CHOP or EWS-CHOP translocations were studied using RT-PCR. In primary retroperitoneal myxoid/round cell liposarcoma, MDM2 and CDK4 staining was both positive in 12 of 15 cases. In primary extremity myxoid/round cell liposarcoma, MDM2 was negative in 18/20 and CDK4 was negative in all cases. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification showed the amplification of 12q13-15 region in 16/16 primary retroperitoneal myxoid/round cell liposarcomas and in 1/20 primary extremity myxoid/round cell liposarcomas. Translocation was present in all (18/18) primary extremity myxoid/round cell liposarcomas, but absent in all primary retroperitoneal myxoid/round cell liposarcomas. On the basis of immunohistochemical and molecular characteristics, apparent primary retroperitoneal myxoid/round cell liposarcoma can be recognized as well-/dedifferentiated liposarcoma with morphological features mimicking myxoid/round cell liposarcoma. In these cases, treatment should probably be specifically designed as for well-/dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Moreover, finding of myxoid/round cell liposarcoma translocations in a retroperitoneal localization is highly suggestive of metastasis and should prompt search for a primary localization outside the retroperitoneum.",

Both MDM2 and MDMX function as powerful oncogenes and are commonly over-expressed in some cancers, including sarcoma (~20%) and breast cancer (~15%). In contrast to tumors that are p53 mutant, whereby the current therapeutic strategy restores the normal active conformation of p53, MDM2 and MDMX represent logical therapeutic targets in cancer for increasing wild-type (WT) p53 expression and activities. Recent preclinical studies suggest that there may also be situations that MDM2/X inhibitors could be used in p53 mutant tumors. Since the discovery of nutlin-3a, the first in a class of small molecule MDM2 inhibitors that binds to the hydrophobic cleft in the N-terminus of MDM2, preventing its association with p53, there is now an extensive list of related compounds. In addition, a new class of stapled peptides that can target both MDM2 and MDMX have also been developed. Importantly, preclinical modeling, which has demonstrated effective in vitro and in vivo killing of WT p53 cancer cells, has now been translated into early clinical trials allowing better assessment of their biological effects and toxicities in patients. In this overview, we will review the current MDM2- and MDMX-targeted therapies in development, focusing particularly on compounds that have entered into early phase clinical trials.

In the present study, we investigated the functions of MDM2 oncogene in the growth of breast cancer and the potential value of MDM2 as a drug target for cancer therapy by inhibiting MDM2 expression with a specific antisense antihuman-MDM2 oligonucleotide (oligo). The selected antisense mixed-backbone oligo was evaluated for its in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity in human breast cancer models: MCF-7 cell line containing wild-type p53 and MDA-MB-468 cell line containing mutant p53. In MCF-7 cells, p53 and p21 levels were elevated, resulting from specific inhibition of MDM2 expression by the antisense oligo (AS). In MDA-MB-468 cells, after inhibition of MDM2 expression, p21 levels were elevated, although p53 levels remained unchanged. After i.p. administration of the antisense anti-MDM2 oligo, in vivo antitumor activity occurred in a dose-dependent manner in nude mice bearing MCF-7 or MDA-MB-468 xenografts. In both models, in vivo synergistically or additive therapeutic effects of MDM2 inhibition and the clinically used cancer chemotherapeutic agents irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil, and paclitaxel (Taxol) were observed. These results suggest that MDM2 have a role in tumor growth through both p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms. We speculate that MDM2 inhibitors, such as ASs, have a broad spectrum of antitumor activities in human breast cancers, regardless of p53 status. This study should provide a basis for future development of anti-MDM2 ASs as cancer therapeutic agents used alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapeutics.",

In this study we demonstrate the potential of combining personal genomic characterization of patient tumors to identify targetable mutations with in vitro testing of specific drugs in patient-derived cell lines. We have analyzed three metastases from a patient with high-grade metastatic dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS) by exome and transcriptome sequencing as well as DNA copy number analysis. Genomic aberrations of several potentially targetable genes, including amplification of KITLG and FRS2, in addition to amplification of CDK4 and MDM2, characteristic of this disease, were identified. We evaluated the efficacy of drugs targeting these aberrations or the corresponding signaling pathways in a cell line derived from the patient. Interestingly, the pan-FGFR inhibitor NVP-BGJ398, which targets FGFR upstream of FRS2, strongly inhibited cell proliferation in vitro and induced an accumulation of cells into the G0 phase of the cell cycle.

We herein describe 9 cases of well-differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma with distinct areas of fibroosseous tissue histologically indistinguishable from low-grade osteosarcomas, that is, parosteal osteosarcoma or low-grade central osteosarcoma. The tumors affected middle-aged to elderly patients, and occurred in the retroperitoneum and deep soft tissue of the extremities without connection to the skeletal system. Grossly, all the tumors showed biphasic appearance with lipogenic and osteogenic area, the latter representing 5% to 50% of the total tumor volume. Histologically, the lipogenic component exhibited typical histology of well-differentiated liposarcoma, whereas the osteogenic area consisted of fibroosseous tissue with numerous mature neoplastic bone trabeculae largely lacking osteoblastic rimming, with intervening fascicles of spindle cell proliferation showing low nuclear grade. All samples were positive for MDM2 and/or CDK4 on immunohistochemical analysis; the antibodies stained many osteocytes, indicating that the bone is neoplastic rather than reactive. Three cases showed high-grade osteosarcomatous transformation juxtaposed to the low-grade osteosarcomatous component, reminiscent of the \"dedifferentiation\" phenomenon of skeletal low-grade osteosarcoma. Follow-up revealed local recurrence in 4 cases, but no distant metastases were documented. Recognition of this earlier underappreciated subtype of well-differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma is important, because the fibroosseous component may seem so bland that it may be confused with benign metaplasia such as myositis ossificans, or conversely, the lipomatous component may be inconspicuous that it may be dismissed as normal fat, and such misinterpretation may potentially result in suboptimal treatment.",

In this study, we evaluated whether nutlin-3, a recently developed small-molecule antagonist of MDM2, has an effect on p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cultured human RMS cell lines.;Five RMS cell lines with different p53 statuses and MDM2 expression levels were treated with nutlin-3. Gene expression patterns, cell viability, cell cycle, and apoptosis after nutlin-3 treatment, and antitumor activity of combination treatment with vincristine or actinomycin D were assessed.;Significant p53 activation was observed in wild-type p53 cell lines after nutlin-3 treatment. p53 activation led to cell cycle arrest in parallel with increased p21 expression. Furthermore, these cell lines underwent p53-dependent apoptosis, concomitant with elevation of proapoptotic genes and activation of caspase-3. The effect of nutlin-3 was almost the same in terms of half maximal inhibitory concentration and apoptosis whether or not MDM2 was overexpressed. Nutlin-3 did not induce either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in p53 mutant cell lines. A combination of vincristine or actinomycin D with nutlin-3 enhanced the antitumor activity in RMS cell lines with wild-type p53.;Nutlin-3 effectively restored p53 function in both normal MDM2 expression and MDM2 overexpression RMS cell lines with wild-type p53. p53 restoration therapy is a potential therapeutic strategy for refractory RMS with wild-type p53.",

Therefore, the rare occurrence of cases with combined patterns of well-differentiated liposarcoma and myxoid liposarcoma designated as mixed-type liposarcoma pose a conceptual problem. Moreover, this feature may have consequences for treatment choice and prognosis. Here, we have dissected the molecular relation of tumor components in cases of mixed-type liposarcoma. On the basis of heterogeneous preoperative magnetic resonance image (MRI) features, eight cases of mixed-type liposarcoma were selected. Preoperative biopsy samples and resection specimens were analyzed including molecular and immunohistochemical analysis on all components. As controls, cases with homogeneous MRI features and uniform aspects of myxoid liposarcoma (n = 5), round cell liposarcoma (n = 5) and well-differentiated liposarcoma (n = 5) were studied. All patients with heterogeneous MRI features showed morphological components of myxoid liposarcoma and well-differentiated liposarcoma. Real-time polymerase chain reaction showed FUS-DDIT3 fusion in both components in five of eight cases in the absence (zero of five) of MDM2 and CDK4 amplification. In three of eight patients, MDM2 and/or CDK4 were overexpressed, and amplification was shown by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) in the absence of myxoid liposarcoma translocations. All control patients showed a molecular pattern consistent with their morphological features. Therefore, mixed-type liposarcomas should not be regarded as collision tumors, but as an extreme variant of the morphological spectrum within a single biological entity, explaining the biological contradiction of mixed-type liposarcoma. For treatment stratification, detailed classification including molecular support should be performed in tumors with heterogeneous MRI features.",

Cytogenetic and CGH studies have identified frequent gross chromosomal aberrations but the target genes of these changes are unknown. To determine whether known oncogenes take part in genomic rearrangements and to investigate the potential clinical significance of their amplifications, nine known oncogenes (CMYC, MDM2, GLI1, CDK4, HER2, EGFR1, CCND1, FGF3, EMS) were analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) on a tissue microarray (TMA) containing 94 primary GIST. Clinical follow-up information was available for 57 of these patients. Amplification was found for CMYC in three of 90 (3.3%), for MDM2 in five of 94 (5.3%), for EGFR1 in five of 94 (5.3%), and for CCND1 in seven of 79 (8.9%) evaluable cases. No amplifications were seen for HER2, GLI1, CDK4, FGF3, and EMS. Amplifications of MDM2 and CCND1 were associated with clinical and histological malignancy. In conclusion, our data show that gene amplification does occur in a subset of GIST.

They represent the second malignant primary bone tumor of adults after osteosarcoma, but in contrast to osteosarcoma they are resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, surgical excision remaining the only therapeutic option. Few cell lines and animal models are available, and the mechanisms behind their chemoresistance remain largely unknown. Our goal was to establish new cell lines and animal cancer models from human chondrosarcoma biopsies to study their chemoresistance. Between 2007 and 2012, 10 chondrosarcoma biopsies were collected and used for cell culture and transplantation into nude mice. Only one transplanted biopsy and one injected cell line has engrafted successfully leading to conventional central high-grade chondrosarcoma similar to the original biopsies. In culture, two new stable cell lines were obtained, one from a dedifferentiated and one from a grade III conventional central chondrosarcoma biopsy. Their genetic characterization revealed triploid karyotypes, mutations in IDH1, IDH2, and TP53, deletion in CDKN2A and/or MDM2 amplification. These cell lines expressed mesenchymal membrane markers (CD44, 73, 90, 105) and were able to produce a hyaline cartilaginous matrix when cultured in chondrogenic three-dimensional (3D) pellets. Using a high-throughput quantitative RT-PCR approach, we observed that cell lines cultured in monolayer had lost expression of several genes implicated in cartilage development (COL2A1, COMP, ACAN) but restored their expression in 3D cultures. Chondrosarcoma cells in monolayer were sensitive to several conventional chemotherapeutic agents but became resistant to low doses of mafosfamide or doxorubicin when cultured in 3D pellets, in parallel with an altered nucleic accumulation of the drug. Our results indicate that the cartilaginous matrix produced by chondrosarcoma cells may impair diffusion of several drugs and thus contribute to chemoresistance. Therefore, 3D chondrogenic cell pellets constitute a more relevant model to study chondrosarcoma chemoresistance and may be a valuable alternative to animal experimentations. ",

We applied CGH in order to obtain a global view of DNA-sequence losses and gains in osteosarcoma. CGH was performed on 20 high-grade medullary osteosarcomas (13 primary tumors prior to chemotherapy, 5 tumors after chemotherapy, 2 established cell lines [MB63, HOS58]) using genomic DNA of snap-frozen tumor specimens. CGH revealed DNA copy number aberrations, mostly gains, in all the tumors studied with an average of 18.5 aberrations/tumor (range 8-32). High-level amplifications were observed in all cases (average 4.1 amplifications/tumor [range 1-10]). Amplicons affecting at least five tumors were mapped to 1p21-31 (9/20 cases), 3q25-qter (6/20), 6p12-21 (6/20), 8q12-qter (10/20), 12p11-12 (9/20), 12q12-15 (enclosing MDM2 and SAS loci, 7/20). Losses were most frequently seen at 3p, 10q, 11p and 13 (all 10/20). In conclusion, our CGH data indicated that genomic amplification plays an important role in the biology of osteosarcoma.

We also examined the expression of p53, MDM2, and p21WAF1 protein immunohistochemically and assessed the proliferative activities using the monoclonal antibody MIB-1. p53 immunoreactivity was recognized in 5 of 23 OS cases (22%), whereas p53 gene mutations were also detected in 5 of 23 OS cases (22%; osteoblastic [4/15; 27%] and MFH-like [1/8; 18%] types) and in 4 of 18 cases of MFH of bone (22%). There was a statistically significant correlation between p53 immunoreactivity and p53 mutation status in OS (P =.0482). All those cases of osteoblastic OS and MFH of bone that had p53 mutations, with the exception of one case of MFH of bone that had a silent mutation, showed aggressive biologic behavior (dead of disease within 12 mo), in contrast to the MFH-like OS cases (alive without disease at 22 mo). Three cases of OS (13%) and three cases of MFH of bone (17%) showed immunoreactivity for MDM2. As for gene alteration, three cases of OS (13%) and 3 cases of MFH of bone (17%) demonstrated MDM2 amplification. MDM2 amplification showed a significant correlation with the expression of MDM2 protein in OS (P =.0344). p21WAF1 expression was detected in three cases of OS (13%) and in six cases of MFH of bone (33%). MDM2 alteration and p21WAF1 expression were not observed in any of the cases of MFH-like OS. MIB-1-LI showed a statistically significant correlation with p53 immunoreactivity and MDM2 immunoreactivity in OS (P =.0307 and P =.0358, respectively). H-ras mutation at Codons 12 and 13 was not recognized in any of the cases of OS or MFH of bone. In conclusion, although treatment differences during the time of study make it difficult to compare survival analysis, in the current study, p53 mutation in osteoblastic OS and MFH of bone in elderly patients seemed to be closely associated with the progression of the tumor, which was not the case in MFH-like OS. Furthermore, MDM2 alteration and p21WAF1 expression were demonstrated only in osteoblastic OS and MFH of bone, whereas they were not recognized in MFH-like OS. Although the number of patients in this analysis was small, it would appear that MFH-like OS may have some characteristic biologic aspects when compared with osteoblastic OS and MFH of bone in elderly patients.",

Nutlin-3a also increased the cytotoxicity of both carboplatin and doxorubicin in a series of p53-mutant human tumor cell lines. In the human dedifferentiated liposarcoma cell line (LS141) and the p53 wild-type HCT116 cells, Nutlin-3a induced downregulation of E2F1 and this effect appeared to be proteasome dependent. In contrast, in MPNST and HCTp53-/- cells, Nutlin-3a inhibited the binding of E2F1 to MDM2 and induced transcriptional activation of free E2F1 in the presence of Cis-induced DNA damage. Downregulation of E2F1 by small interfering RNA significantly decreased the level of apoptosis induced by Cis and Nutlin-3a treatment. Moreover, expression of a dominant-negative form of E2F1 rescued cells from apoptosis, whereas cells overexpressing wild-type E2F1 showed an increase in cell death. This correlated with the induction of the proapoptotic proteins p73alpha and Noxa, which are both regulated by E2F1. These results indicate that antagonism of MDM2 by Nutlin-3a in cells with mutant p53 enhances chemosensitivity in an E2F1-dependent manner. Nutlin-3a therefore may provide a therapeutic benefit in tumors with mutant p53 provided it is combined with chemotherapy.",

Cytogenetically, WDLS is characterized by the presence of ring or giant rod chromosomes containing several amplified genes, including MDM2, TSPAN31, CDK4, and others mainly derived from chromosome bands 12q13-15. However, the 12q13-15 amplicon is large and discontinuous. The focus of this study was to identify novel critical genes that are consistently amplified in primary (nonrecurrent) WDLS and with potential relevance for future targeted therapy. Using a high-resolution (5.0 kb) \"single nucleotide polymorphism\"/copy number variation microarray to screen the whole genome in a series of primary WDLS, two consistently amplified areas were found on chromosome 12: one region containing the MDM2 and CPM genes, and another region containing the FRS2 gene. Based on these findings, we further validated FRS2 amplification in both WDLS and DDLS. Fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed FRS2 amplification in all WDLS and DDLS tested (n = 57). Real time PCR showed FRS2 mRNA transcriptional upregulation in WDLS (n = 19) and DDLS (n = 13) but not in lipoma (n = 5) and normal fat (n = 9). Immunoblotting revealed high expression levels of phospho-FRS2 at Y436 and slightly overexpression of total FRS2 protein in liposarcoma but not in normal fat or preadipocytes. Considering the critical role of FRS2 in mediating fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling, our findings indicate that FRS2 signaling should be further investigated as a potential therapeutic target for liposarcoma.",

In this series, there were 36 men and 21 women aged from 22 to 87 years (median: 59). Tumors were mainly located in the lower limbs (27 cases), trunk wall (15 cases), and upper limbs (10 cases). Most tumors were deeply located (51/54) with a size from 1 to 30 cm (median: 8 cm). Cases were classified in 3 histologic categories: spindle cell RMS (25 cases), pleomorphic RMS (16 cases), and mixed type (16 cases). Forty-one tumors were grade 3 and 16 grade 2. Immunohistochemistry showed that every case was positive for desmin and myogenin. Alpha smooth muscle actin was positive in 21%, pankeratin AE1/AE3 in 20%, and CD34 in 13.2%. Treatment modalities and follow-up were available in 46 cases. Median follow-up was 60.9 months. Eight patients developed a local recurrence and 16 a distant metastasis with a 5-year overall survival rate of 52.6% and a 5-year metastasis-free survival of 62.9%.

We aimed to study the incidence of local recurrence of 90 cases of atypical lipomatous tumours and an additional 18 cases of de novo dedifferentiated liposarcoma. All tumours were diagnosed on the basis of MDM2 amplification: all patients had their first treatment in the same specialist sarcoma unit and were followed for a minimum of 60 months. The tumours were diagnosed between 1997 and 2009 and followed until the end of 2014. Seventy cases (78%) of atypical lipomatous tumours were located in the thigh (mean size 195 mm on presentation). Eight atypical lipomatous tumours (8.9%) recurred locally, of which 50% recurred after 60 months. The only two tumours with intralesional excisions recurred. Seven of the eight recurrent tumours were detected by the patient by self-examination. One case recurred a second time as a dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Seventeen per cent of the de novo dedifferentiated liposarcomas recurred within 60 months of presentation. Extending the study period revealed that atypical lipomatous tumour could recur up to 40 years after the first surgery. Furthermore, of 26 tumours that recurred in the extended study, 27% recurred more than once, and three of the seven that recurred more than once transformed into a dedifferentiated liposarcoma. We recommend that, following post-operative wound care, patients with atypical lipomatous tumour are referred back to their general practitioner for follow up, but that in the event of a suspected recurrence they have rapid access back to the specialist unit using a 'supported discharge' scheme. In the event of an intralesional excision and if a lesion recurs, patients are followed in a specialist unit at regular intervals: whether MRI scanning is a valuable means of monitoring such patients is unclear and requires an evidence base.

As a result, nuclear expression of the cytoplasmic transcription factor STAT6 is found in solitary fibrous tumor and serves as a useful diagnostic marker. STAT6 is located in 12q13, a region containing well-characterized oncogenes that are commonly amplified in dedifferentiated liposarcoma; we have previously reported that STAT6 is expressed in a subset of dedifferentiated liposarcoma. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of STAT6 expression in dedifferentiated liposarcoma and the underlying genetic mechanism. STAT6 protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in a well-characterized series of 35 previously unpublished cases of dedifferentiated liposarcoma, all with nuclear MDM2 and/or CDK4 expression by immunohistochemistry and/or cytogenetic features of dedifferentiated liposarcoma. FISH for STAT6 was performed in all cases with STAT6 expression, and a subset of control cases without STAT6 expression. In total 4/35 cases (11%) showed STAT6 expression (three with multifocal staining of moderate to strong intensity and one with weak focal staining). FISH demonstrated amplification of STAT6 in all cases positive for STAT6 by immunohistochemistry; in contrast, FISH performed on four STAT6-negative dedifferentiated liposarcomas demonstrated no STAT6 amplification (P=0.0286). Of the four STAT6 amplified cases, three patients were male and one was female, ranging in age from 51 to 76 years. Tumors were located in the mediastinum (n=2), paratesticular soft tissue (n=1), and perirenal soft tissue (n=1). Three patients received pre-operative chemotherapy +/- radiation therapy. In conclusion, STAT6 is amplified in a subset of dedifferentiated liposarcoma, resulting in STAT6 protein expression that can be detected by immunohistochemistry and may be a potential pitfall in the differential diagnosis of dedifferentiated liposarcoma and solitary fibrous tumor. These findings suggest a role for STAT6-mediated transcriptional activity in some cases of dedifferentiated liposarcoma and highlight the genomic complexity and heterogeneity of dedifferentiated liposarcoma.

We first show that low expression of miR-579-3p is a negative prognostic factor correlating with poor survival. Expression levels of miR-579-3p decrease from nevi to stage III/IV melanoma samples and even further in cell lines resistant to BRAF/MEK inhibitors. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that miR-579-3p acts as an oncosuppressor by targeting the 3'UTR of two oncoproteins: BRAF and an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, MDM2. Moreover miR-579-3p ectopic expression impairs the establishment of drug resistance in human melanoma cells. Finally, miR-579-3p is strongly down-regulated in matched tumor samples from patients before and after the development of resistance to targeted therapies. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Osteosarcoma is the most common malignant primary bone tumor in children and adolescents. The clinical outcome for osteosarcoma remains discouraging despite aggressive surgery and intensive radiotherapy and chemotherapy regimens. Thus, novel therapeutic approaches are needed. Previously, we have shown that inorganic phosphate (Pi) inhibits proliferation and aggressiveness of human osteosarcoma U2OS cells identifying adenylate cyclase, beta3 integrin, Rap1, ERK1/2 as proteins whose expression and function are relevantly affected in response to Pi. In this study, we investigated whether Pi could affect chemosensitivity of osteosarcoma cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Here, we report that Pi inhibits proliferation of p53-wild type U2OS cells (and not of p53-null Saos and p53-mutant MG63 cells) by slowing-down cell cycle progression, without apoptosis occurrence. Interestingly, we found that Pi strongly enhances doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity in U2OS, and not in Saos and MG63 cells, by apoptosis induction, as revealed by a marked increase of sub-G1 population, Bcl-2 downregulation, caspase-3 activation, and PARP cleavage. Remarkably, Pi/doxorubicin combination-induced cytotoxicity was accompanied by an increase of p53 protein levels and of p53 target genes mdm2, p21 and Bax, and was significantly reduced by the p53 inhibitor pifithrine-alpha. Moreover, the doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity was associated with ERK1/2 pathway inhibition in response to Pi. Altogether, our data enforce the evidence of Pi as a novel signaling molecule capable of inhibiting ERK pathway and inducing sensitization to doxorubicin of osteosarcoma cells by p53-dependent apoptosis, implying that targeting Pi levels might represent a rational strategy for improving osteosarcoma therapy.",

All consecutive patients affected by primary well-differentiated (WD)/dedifferentiated (DD) retroperitoneal liposarcoma, surgically treated at our institution between January 2002 and December 2011, were retrospectively evaluated. Tumors were stained for mdm2 and 5 myogenic markers (smooth muscle actin-α, h-caldesmon, calponin, desmin, myogenin). The French National Federation of the Centers for the Fight Against Cancer (FNCLCC) grading system was applied. Overall survival, crude cumulative incidence of local recurrence, and distant metastases were calculated. Multivariable analyses were carried out. A total of 144 patients were identified. Median follow-up was 68 months (interquartile range: 46 to 104 mo). Fifty-two patients were affected by WD/G1 and 92 by DD liposarcoma. Among the latter, 60 were grade G2 and 32 G3. Myogenic differentiation was present in 54 cases (8/52 WD/G1, 27/60 DD/G2, 18/32 DD/G3). Seven cases had a rhabdomyoblastic DD component (1/60 DD/G2 and 6/32 DD/G3). Five-year overall survival rates were 93%, 57%, and 21% for WD/G1 liposarcoma, G2 DD, and G3 DD liposarcoma, respectively, and 75%, 42%, and 29% for liposarcoma without myogenic differentiation, with myogenic differentiation, with rhabdomyoblastic differentiation, respectively (P<0.001). Of note, 5/6 patients affected by G3 DD liposarcoma with a rhabdomyoblastic component died within 8 months. FNCLCC grade and myogenic differentiation significantly predicted the outcome of retroperitoneal liposarcoma. These should be factored into treatment decision-making and possibly used to stratify patients in clinical trials. ",

IM exhibits strong antiproliferative effects but fails to induce sufficient levels of apoptosis resulting in low pathologic complete remission rates and a high rate of secondary progression in the metastatic setting. Upregulation of p53 by MDM2 inhibitors has been shown to induce apoptosis in p53 wildtype tumors. Analyzing a series of 62 mostly untreated, localized and metastatic GIST we detected a low rate (3%) of inactivating p53 mutations, thus providing a rationale for further exploration of p53-directed therapeutic strategies. To this end, we studied nutlin-3, an inhibitor of the p53 antagonist MDM2, and RITA, a putative p53 activator, in GIST cell lines. Nutlin-3 effectively induced p53 at therapeutically relevant levels, which resulted in moderate antiproliferative effects and cell cycle arrest in p53 wildtype GIST cell lines GIST430, GIST48 and GIST48B. P53 reactivation substantially improved the apoptotic response after effective KIT inhibition with sunitinib and 17-AAG in IM-resistant cell lines. The commonly used imatinib-sensitive cell lines GIST882 and GIST-T1 were shown to harbor defective p53 and therefore failed to respond to nutlin-3 treatment. RITA induced p53 in GIST48B, followed by antiproliferative effects and a strong induction of apoptosis. Surprisingly, GIST-T1 was also highly sensitive to RITA despite lacking functional p53. This suggested a more complex, p53-independent mechanism of action for the latter compound. No antagonistic effects from p53-activating drugs were seen with any drug combination. Our data provide first evidence that modulation of the MDM2/p53 pathway may be therapeutically useful to improve the apoptotic response of KIT-inhibitory drugs in the treatment of naïve GIST, with p53 mutation status being a predictive factor of response.",

We studied the frequency of amplification of these genes in a series of 48 dedifferentiated liposarcomas and 68 atypical lipomatous tumors/well-differentiated liposarcomas. We correlated their amplification status with clinicopathological features and outcomes. Histologically, both CDK4 (P=0.007) and JUN (P=0.005) amplifications were associated with dedifferentiated liposarcoma, whereas amplification of the proximal parts of HMGA2 (5'-untranslated region (UTR) and exons 1-3) was associated with atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma (P=0.01). CDK4 amplification was associated with axial tumors. Amplification of 5'-UTR and exons 1-3 of HMGA2 was associated with primary status and grade 1. Shorter overall survival was correlated with: age >64 years (P=0.03), chemotherapy used in first intent (P<0.001), no surgery (P=0.003), grade 3 (P<0.001), distant metastasis (P<0.001), node involvement (P=0.006), and CDK4 amplification (P=0.07). In multivariate analysis, distant metastasis (HR=8.8) and grade 3 (HR=18.2) were associated with shorter overall survival. A shorter recurrence-free survival was associated with dedifferentiated liposarcoma (P<0.001), grade 3 (P<0.001), node involvement (P<0.001), distant metastasis (P=0.02), recurrent status (P=0.009), axial location (P=0.001), and with molecular features such as CDK4 (P=0.05) and JUN amplification (P=0.07). Amplification of 5'-UTR and exons 1-3 (P=0.08) and 3'-UTR (P=0.01) of HMGA2 were associated with longer recurrence-free survival. Distant metastasis was associated with shorter recurrence-free survival (HR=5.8) in multivariate analysis. Dedifferentiated liposarcoma type was associated with axial location, grade 3 and recurrent status. In conclusion, we showed that the amplification of HMGA2 was associated with the atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma histological type and a good prognosis, whereas CDK4 and JUN amplifications were associated with dedifferentiated liposarcoma histology and a bad prognosis. In addition, we also provided the first description of the molecular evolution of a well-differentiated liposarcoma into four successive dedifferentiated liposarcoma relapses, which was consistent with our general observations.

No evidence of drug-induced apoptosis was observed in any case. Nutlin-induced senescence was strictly dependent on the presence of functional p53 as revealed by the fact that cells lacking p53 were completely insensitive to the drug, whereas cells lacking the tumor suppressor alternative reading frame product of the CDKN2A locus underwent irreversible cell cycle arrest. Interestingly, irreversibility was achieved in neoplastic cells faster than in their corresponding parental primary cells, suggesting that nutlin-3a and oncogenic signaling cooperate in activating p53.

Our results reveal that extrachromosomal amplicons are unstable, and frequently lost by micronucleation. This loss correlates with hypermethylation of eliminated sequences and changes of their replication time. Treatment of cells with demethylating agents during early S-phase significantly decreases the rate of micronuclei positive for CDK4. We also demonstrate that, in our model, micronuclei are generated during anaphase as a consequence of anaphase abnormalities (chromosome lagging and anaphase bridges). Finally, a dramatic increase of adipocytic differentiation was noted in cells that have eliminated copies of CDK4 gene in micronuclei.

But the mechanism of IFNalpha in regulating chemosensitivity has not been fully understood. To study whether IFNalpha affected chemosensitivity of osteosarcoma cells, we treated p53-wild U2OS cells and p53-mutant MG63 cells with IFNalpha and etoposide, alone or in combination, and then examined growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. IFNalpha enhanced etoposide-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in p53-wild U2OS cells but not p53-mutant MG63 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Etoposide-induced G2/M phase arrest was also enhanced by IFNalpha. The enhanced apoptosis was associated with the accumulation of transcriptionally active p53 accompanied with increased Bax and Mdm2, as well as decreased Bcl-2. IFNalpha also activated caspases-3, -8 and -9 protein kinases and PARP cleavage in response to etoposide in U2OS cells. Moreover, the combination-induced cytotoxicity and PARP cleavage were significantly reduced by caspase pan inhibitor and p53 siRNA. Thus we conclude that IFNalpha enhances etoposide-induced apoptosis in human osteosarcoma U2OS cells by a p53-dependent and caspase-activation pathway. The proper combination of IFNalpha and conventional chemotherapeutic agents may be a rational strategy for the treatment of human osteosarcoma with functional p53.",

However, the tumor may sometimes undergo significant inflammatory changes leading to a difficult differential diagnosis with well-differentiated liposarcoma. Authors report the case of a 51-year-old man, presenting with epigastralgia of recent onset. Physical exam was unremarkable. Endoscopy revealed a large, ulcerated, submucosal, and antral tumor. CT scan showed an antral mass with fat attenuation. The patient underwent a total gastrectomy. Macroscopic examination identified in the antral wall a 9-cm, well-circumscribed, nodular lesion, with a greasy cut surface. On histological examination, the tumor was composed of a mature adipocytes proliferation, showing significant variation in cell size, associated to some lipoblasts. Nuclei were sometimes large, irregular, neither with hyperchromasia nor mitosis. Diagnosis of a well-differentiated liposarcoma was suspected and molecular cytogenetic analyses showed neither MDM2 nor CDK4 gene amplification on fluorescent in situ hybridization. The diagnosis of lipoma was made. Twelve months after surgery, the patient is doing well. In conclusion, Differentiating benign from malignant fatty tumors is sometimes difficult in morphologic features. In these cases, cytogenetic procedures are the only means for an accurate diagnosis.

Nutlin-3 is a MDM2 inhibitor under preclinical investigation as nongenotoxic activator of the p53 pathway for cancer therapy. Here, nutlin-3 was evaluated for its activity alone or in combination with established chemotherapeutic drugs for antitumor action in chemosensitive and chemoresistant neuroblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines. Effects of nutlin-3 single treatment were much more pronounced in p53 wild-type cell lines (IC(50)s <3 micromol/L) than in p53-mutated cell lines (IC(50)s >17 micromol/L). In sharp contrast to the expectations, nutlin-3 concentrations that did not affect viability of p53-mutated cell lines strongly increased the efficacy of vincristine in p53-mutated, P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-overexpressing cell lines (decrease in IC(50)s 92- to 3,434-fold). Similar results were obtained for other P-gp substrates. Moreover, nutlin-3 reduced efflux of rhodamine 123 and other fluorescence dyes that are effluxed by P-gp. Investigation of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) II cells stably transfected with plasmids encoding for P-gp (MDCKII MDR1) or multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP-1, MDCKII MRP1) revealed that nutlin-3 not only interferes with P-gp but also affects MRP-1-mediated efflux. Kinetic studies and investigation of P-gp-ATPase activity showed that nutlin-3 is likely to act as a P-gp transport substrate. Examination of the nutlin-3 enantiomers nutlin-3a and nutlin-3b revealed that, in contrast to MDM2-inhibitory activity that is limited to nutlin-3a, both enantiomers similarly interfere with P-gp-mediated drug efflux. In conclusion, nutlin-3-induced inhibition of P-gp and MRP-1 was discovered as a novel anticancer mechanism of the substance in this report.",

In addition, other genetic events are believed to be involved in GIST tumorigenesis. Cytogenetic aberrations associated with these tumors thus far described include loss of 1p, 13q, 14q, or 15q, loss of heterozygosity of 22q, numeric chromosomal imbalances, and nuclear/mitochondrial microsatellite instability. Molecular genetic aberrations include loss of heterozygosity of p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF), methylation of p15(INK4B), homozygous loss of the Hox11L1 gene, and amplification of C-MYC, MDM2, EGFR1, and CCND1. GISTs in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 appear to lack the KIT and PDGFRA mutations characteristic of GISTs and may have a different pathogenetic mechanism. Gene mutations of KIT or PDGFRA are critical in GISTs, because the aberrant versions not only are correlated with the specific cell morphology, histologic phenotype, metastasis, and prognosis, but also are the targets of therapy with imatinib and other agents. Furthermore, specific mutations in KIT and PDGFR appear to lead to differential drug sensitivity and may in the future guide selection of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Activation of the receptor tyrosine kinases involves a signal transduction pathway whose components (mitogen-activated protein kinase, AKT, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin, and RAS) are also possible targets of inhibition.

Our previous studies showed that an MDM2-inhibiting motif (residues 15-29) in the p53 transactivation domain (p53TAD) mediates the interaction with anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. In this study, we provided structural models of the complexes between the MDM2-inhibiting p53TAD peptide and Mcl-1, Bcl-w, and Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) Bcl-2 using NMR chemical shift perturbation data. The binding mode of the MDM2-inhibiting p53TAD peptide is highly conserved among the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins despite their distinct specificities for pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. We also identified the binding of a phage-display-derived MDM2-inhibiting peptide 12-1 to anti-apoptotic Bcl-XL protein by using NMR spectroscopy. The structural model of the Bcl-XL/12-1 peptide complex revealed that the conserved residues Phe4, Trp8, and Leu11 in the MDM2-inhibiting peptide fit into a hydrophobic cleft of Bcl-XL in a manner similar to that of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) peptides.

However, because high levels of ionizing radiation (IR) are toxic to normal cells, RT cannot be applied repeatedly to cancer patients. Therefore, novel chemicals that enhance the efficacy of chemoradiotherapy (CRT) would be valuable. Here, we report that ELAS1, a peptide corresponding to the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) association domain of cyclin G1 (CycG1), can enhance the efficacy of CRT. ELAS1 interacts with the PP2A B'γ-subunit and competitively inhibits association with CycG1, thereby preventing the PP2A holoenzyme from dephosphorylating target proteins, Mdm2 (pT218) and p53 (pS46), following DNA double-strand break (DSB) insults. Doxycycline (Dox)-induced overexpression of Myc-ELAS1 caused γ-irradiation to induce apoptosis in human osteosarcoma (U2OS) cells, at 1/10th the effective dosage of γ-irradiation required for apoptosis in Myc-vector-expressing cells; ELAS1 peptide incorporation into U2OS cells also showed similar apoptotic effects. Moreover, administration of DSB-inducing chemicals, camptothecin (CPT) or irinotecan, to Myc-ELAS1-expressing U2OS cells also induced efficient apoptosis with only 1/100th (CPT) or 1/5th (irinotecan) of the amounts of drugs required for this effect in Myc-vector-expressing cells. Taken together, ELAS1 may be important for the design of ELAS1-mimetic compounds to improve CRT efficacy. ",

Many protein-coding genes in the region, such as MDM2 and , have been studied as potential therapeutic targets for LPS treatment, with minimal success. In the amplified region near the MDM2 gene, our single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis of 75 LPS samples identified frequent amplification of miR-26a-2. Besides being in the amplicon, miR-26a-2 was overexpressed significantly in WDLPS/DDLPS (P<0.001), as well as in myxoid/round cell LPS (MRC) (P<0.05). Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that overexpression of miR-26a-2 significantly correlated with poor patient survival in both types of LPS (P<0.05 for WDLPS/DDLPS; P<0.001 for MRC). Based on these findings, we hypothesized that miR-26a-2 has an important role in LPS tumorigenesis, regardless of LPS subtypes. Overexpression of miR-26a-2 in three LPS cell lines (SW872, LPS141 and LP6) enhanced the growth and survival of these cells, including faster cell proliferation and migration, enhanced clonogenicity, suppressed adipocyte differentiation and/or resistance to apoptosis. Inhibition of miR-26a-2 in LPS cells using anti-miR-26a-2 resulted in the opposite responses. To explain further the effect of miR-26a-2 overexpression in LPS cells, we performed in silico analysis and identified 93 candidate targets of miR-26a-2. Among these genes, RCBTB1 (regulator of chromosome condensation and BTB domain-containing protein 1) is located at 13q12.3-q14.3, a region of recurrent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in LPS. Indeed, either overexpression or inhibition of RCBTB1 made LPS cells more susceptible or resistant to apoptosis, respectively. In conclusion, our study for the first time reveals the contribution of miR-26a-2 to LPS tumorigenesis, partly through inhibiting RCBTB1, suggesting that miR-26a-2 is a novel therapeutic target for human LPS.",

Immunohistochemistry for CDK4 and p16 showed strong and diffuse nuclear expression in the hibernoma-like areas, and fluorescence in situ hybridization showed MDM2 gene amplification, all in keeping with WDL.

In contrast, the p53 tumor suppressor negatively controls cell growth and is activated by a wide range of insults to the cell. The mTOR and p53 signaling pathways are connected by a number of different mechanisms. Chemotherapeutics that inhibit ribosome biogenesis often induce nucleolar stress and activation of p53. Here we have investigated how the p53 response to nucleolar stress is affected by simultaneous mTOR inhibition in osteosarcoma and glioma cell lines. We found that inhibitors of the mTOR pathway including rapamycin, wortmannin, and caffeine blunted the p53 response to nucleolar stress induced by actinomycin D. Synthetic inhibitors of mTOR (temsirolimus, LY294.002 and PP242) also impaired actinomycin D triggered p53 stabilization and induction of p21. Ribosomal protein (RPL11) is known to be required for p53 protein stabilization following nucleolar stress. Treatment of cells with mTOR inhibitors may lead to reduced synthesis of RPL11 and thereby destabilize p53. We found that rapamycin mimicked the effect of RPL11 depletion in terms of blunting the p53 response to nucleolar stress. However, the extent to which the levels of p53 and RPL11 were reduced by rapamycin varied between cell lines. Additional mechanisms whereby rapamycin blunts the p53 response to nucleolar stress are likely to be involved. Indeed, rapamycin increased the levels of endogenous MDM2 despite inhibition of its phosphorylation at Ser-166. Our findings may have implications for the design of combinatorial cancer treatments with mTOR pathway inhibitors. ",

We have used spectral karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization with whole chromosome painting and locus-specific probes, and array-comparative genomic hybridization to identify the chromosomal and molecular alterations of a novel cell line established from a recurring sclerosing WDLPS. The karyotype was hypertriploid and showed multiple structural anomalies.

Ten chimeric 2'-O-methoxyethyl (MoE)-modified hemimers were synthesized that targeted various regions from the 5'- to the 3'-end of Hdm2 mRNA. The IC50 of the most potent ASO, NCH-4401, was subsequently determined and compared to the IC50 of a 2'-MoE-modified ASO, with a complete phosphorothioate backbone (NCH-4668), and to a 3 bp mismatched ASO (NCH4529). NCH4401 inhibited Hdm2 expression in SJSA-1 cells with an IC50 of 120 nm, whereas NCH-4668 was less potent with an IC50 of 180 nm. The mismatched control ASO was completely inactive, indicating a sequence-dependent mechanism of action of NCH-4401. NCH4401 was subsequently used to study the consequences of inhibiting Hdm2 expression in human osteosarcoma cells. NCH-4401 completely inhibited Hdm2 protein expression in SJSA-1 cells at a concentration of 300 nm, already 4 h after start of ASO treatment. At an ASO concentration of 300 nM, p53 protein was induced 12.5-fold and p21 was induced 8-fold over background levels, 24 h after start of ASO treatment. The dramatic induction of p53 in SJSA-1 cells prompted us to investigate whether the accumulation of p53 in these cells was followed by induction of apoptosis. However, no signs for apoptosis were detected in SJSA-1 cells, following induction of wild-type p53 using the Yopro method and the induction of caspase-3 activity. SJSA-1 cells were subsequently treated with NCH-4401 at different concentrations in combination with two well-known DNA-damaging agents, i.e. carboplatin and mitomycin C. Apoptosis induction following treatment of cells with DNA-damaging agents and NCH4401 was determined in parallel by measuring caspase-3 activation and uptake of the DNA dye Yopro. Carboplatin and mitomycin C together only slightly induced apoptosis in SJSA-1 cells to a factor of approximately 2-fold, as measured by the induction of caspase-3 activity.

Adp14ARF infection of U2OS osteosarcoma cells which has wild type p53 and mutant p14ARF revealed high levels of p14 (ARF) expression within 24h. In addition, Adp14ARF-mediated expressing of p14 (ARF) was associated with increased levels of p53, p21, and mdm2 protein. Growth inhibition assays following Adp14ARF infection demonstrated that the growth of U2OS cells was inhibited relative to infection with control virus. Furthermore, TUNEL analysis as well as PARP cleavage assays demonstrated that Adp14ARF infection was associated with increased apoptosis in U2OS cell line and that it was associated with Adp14ARF induced overexpression of Fas and Fas-L. Addition of Fas-L neutralizing antibody NOK-1 decreased Adp14-mediated cell death, indicating that p14 (ARF) induction of the Fas pathway is associated with increased apoptosis. The finding that Adp14ARF infection did not induce Fas expression in U2OS/E6 and MCF/E6 cells suggests that wild type p53 expression may be necessary for Adp14ARF-mediated induction of Fas. The observation that overexpression of p53 by Adp53 infection in MCF-7 does not induce increased Fas protein levels nor apoptotic cell death suggests that p53 overexpression is required but not sufficient enough for apoptosis. These studies suggest there are other mechanisms other than induction of p53 in ARF-mediated apoptosis and gene therapy using Adp14ARF may be a promising treatment option for human cancers containing wild type p53 and mutant or deleted p14 expression.",
