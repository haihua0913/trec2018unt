A relevant issue is the identification of independent prognostic factors to select high-risk patients; such features can be used as predictive factors for tailored therapies. In this study we have investigated the role of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression as a prognostic marker for predicting cancer behavior and clinical outcome in gastric cancer patients undergoing potentially curative surgery.;Epidermal growth factor receptor determination using a commercially available immunohistochemistry (IHC) kit was performed in tissues from 82 gastric cancer patients receiving primary surgical treatment and in 25 normal gastric mucosa specimens from noncancer patients. The EGFR positivity was correlated with disease recurrence and survival in univariate and multivariate analyses.;Forty-four percent (36 cases) of gastric cancers were EGFR positive. In 66 curatively treated patients, EGFR expression correlated with disease recurrence and poorer survival in both univariate and multivariate analyses. In a multivariate model for predicting recurrence and survival, advanced tumor extension (T(3) or T(4)), nodal metastases, and EGFR expression were the only independent covariates. In particular, EGFR expression was shown to be a significant predictor of poor prognosis among gastric cancer patients having the same stage according to the current TNM staging system.;These findings suggest that EGFR expression may be useful in identifying high-risk gastric cancer patients undergoing potentially curative surgery.

Combination treatment regimens with EGFR-targeting agents and cytotoxic agents are considered to be a potential therapeutic option for EGFR-overexpressing GC. Herein, we have investigated the effects of combination treatment with the oral fluoropyrimidine S-1 and the EGFR-targeting agent cetuximab in GC cells with or without EGFR overexpression. EGFR expression was determined by FACS and quantitative PCR in GC cells. Experimental 5-fluorouracil (5FU) was used instead of S-1 for in vitro experiments. The efficacy of 5FU or cetuximab monotherapy or combination 5FU/cetuximab therapy was examined in vitro and in vivo. Clinical specimens were examined for EGFR by immunohistochemistry (IHC). EGFR expression score was defined as strong membrane and cytoplasmic staining in at least 50-75% of cells. The combination of 5FU and cetuximab synergistically inhibited cell proliferation and exhibited an enhanced proapoptotic effect in GC cells with EGFR overexpression. Cetuximab also induced down-regulation of phosphorylation of EGFR and AKT, leading to diminished signaling. The antitumor effect of the combination of S-1 and cetuximab in vivo was also greater than that of either drug alone. Our preclinical findings thus indicate that the combination of S-1 and EGFR-targeting therapy is a promising treatment option for GC with EGFR overexpression.",

We examined whether the expression of STAT3, mTOR and EGFR correlates with clinicopathological features and patient outcome in gastric cancer. Tumor samples were obtained from 126 patients with gastric adenocarcinomas who underwent a radical gastrectomy between 1999 and 2002. The expression of phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3), p-mTOR and EGFR was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining. The relations of these to clinicopathological factors and outcomes were assessed. The expression of p-STAT3 p-mTOR and EGFR positively correlated with the following variables related to tumor progression: the depth of tumor invasion (T1 vs. T2-4; p<0.001, p=0.036 and p<0.001, respectively), lymph node involvement (p=0.008, p=0.027 and p=0.007) and tumor stage (I vs. II-IV; p<0.001, p=0.041 and p<0.001).

Somatic MEK1 gene mutations have been reported as oncogenic activating mutations in gastric cancer, and MEK inhibitors can be effective against such gastric cancers. In the present study, however, activated EGFR and HER2 signals after treatment with a MEK inhibitor (trametinib) were found in a MEK1-mutated gastric cancer cell line (OCUM-1 cell line) using a phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase array. The phosphorylation of EGFR and HER2 reactivated ERK1/2, which had been inhibited by trametinib, and EGF stimulation led to resistance to trametinib in this cell line. Lapatinib, an EGFR and an HER2 inhibitor, reversed the activation of ERK1/2 by inhibiting the phosphorylation of EGFR and HER2 and cancelled the resistance. The combination of trametinib and lapatinib synergistically inhibited the cell growth of the OCUM-1 cell line and strongly induced apoptosis by inhibiting the activated EGFR and HER2 signals. These results suggest that the EGFR and HER2 signals play a salvage role and are related to resistance to MEK inhibitors in MEK1‑mutated gastric cancer. Moreover, combination therapy with trametinib and lapatinib can exhibit a synergistic effect and may contribute to overcoming the resistance to MEK inhibitors. ",

We obtained paired samples from the tumor and the adjacent normal tissue from the same patient undergoing surgery for gastric cancer. Using RT-qPCR, we quantified the mRNA expression of the four receptors including the HER4 splicing isoforms and all the ligands activating these receptors. Using immunohistochemistry, the protein expression of HER4 was also quantified. We found that HER2 mRNA expression was upregulated in the tumor tissue compared to the matched normal tissue (p = 0.0520). All ligands with affinity for EGFR were upregulated, whereas the expression of EGFR was unchanged. Interestingly, we found the mRNA expression of HER4 (p = 0.0002) and its ligand NRG4 (p = 0.0009) to be downregulated in the tumor tissue compared to the matched normal tissue.

Unfortunately, Combination of cetuximab does not provide enough benefit to chemotherapy alone in phase 3 trials. Studies have demonstrated that berberine can suppress the activation of EGFR in tumors. In this study, we evaluated whether berberine could enhance the effects of EGFR-TKIs in GC cell lines and xenograft models. Our data suggest that berberine could effectively enhance the activity of erlotinib and cetuximab in vitro and in vivo. Berberine was found to inhibit growth in GC cell lines and to induce apoptosis. These effects were linked to inhibition of EGFR signaling activation, including the phosphorylation of STAT3. The expressions of Bcl-xL and Cyclind1 proteins were decreased, whereas the levels of cleavage of poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) were considerably increased in the cell lines in response to berberine treatment. These results suggest a potential role for berberine in the treatment of GC, particularly in combination with EGFR-TKIs therapy. Berberine may be a competent therapeutic agent in GC where it can enhance the effects of EGFR inhibitors.",

However, whether Cbl-b could affect 5-FU sensitivity remains unclear. The present study showed that Cbl-b knockdown caused higher proliferation concomitant with the decrease of apoptosis induced by 5-FU treatment in gastric cancer cell. Further mechanism investigation demonstrated that Cbl-b knockdown caused significant increase of phosphorylation of EGFR, ERK and Akt, decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential, and increase of expression ratio of Bcl-2/Bax.

Of the 217 patients with complete treatment and follow-up data, 178 were operated and treated for early disease (group 1), while 39 for advanced disease (group 2). The frequency of positive EGFR, HER2, HER3 and HER4 protein expression in all patients was 17.5%, 11.8%, 14.8% and 32.9%, respectively. There were no differences in protein expression of any of the markers between the two groups. There were, however, statistically significant associations between HER4 and all other HER family members, as well as between HER2 and HER3 expression. Of note, EGFR-positive membranous protein expression was significantly associated with the presence of lymphovascular invasion (p=0.027) and HER3 and HER4 negative cytoplasmic protein expression with well/moderately-differentiated tumors (p=0.030 and p=0.014, respectively). None of the HER family members were of prognostic value for OS in univariate analysis.;The present study confirmed the known protein expression frequencies of HER family members in gastric cancer in a Greek population.

Tumor specimens from patients with stage III gastric cancer with high or low ND (n = 4 for both) were compared at the mRNA level using Affymetrix microarray (harboring 54,675 genes). The expression data were prioritized, and genes that correlated with ND were selected. Ultimately, the EGFR was validated as such a candidate molecule in patients with primary advanced gastric cancer who underwent standard treatment (n = 167). Expression data of the microarray were prioritized based on gene expression ratio and frequency of gene expression. The first priority genes to be selected were genes that are known to be amplified in cancer, which included NKX2.1, CHST9, CTNND2, SLC25A27, FGFR2, EGFR, and PTGER1. Of these genes, the EGFR gene was of particular interest. EGFR expression in primary gastric cancer was examined using immunohistochemistry (IHC). The Student's t-test elucidated a significant difference in EGFR expression between IHC 2+/3+ and IHC 1+ according to ND (P = 0.0035). The Chi-square test also indicated a significant difference between high and low levels of EGFR immunohistochemical staining (IHC2+/3+ and IHC1+, respectively) and ND status (P = 0.0023). According to the least squares method, as ND increased, the risk that EGFR staining levels changed from IHC 1+ to IHC 2+ also increased.

Although some genetic changes, including the KRAS mutation, have been shown to confer resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, novel strategies for the treatment of cancer patients with tumors harboring EGFR WT alleles have yet to be thoroughly delineated. The principal objective of this study was to improve our current understanding of drug interactions between EGFR and MAP/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitors in an effort to gain insight into a novel therapeutic strategy against EGFR WT tumors. Using a panel of human EGFR WT gastric cancer cell lines, we showed that gastric cancer cells harboring the KRAS mutation were selectively sensitive to MEK inhibition as compared with those cells harboring KRAS and PI3K mutations and KRAS WT alleles. However, all cell lines were found to be resistant to EGFR inhibition. The results from Western blots and phosphoprotein arrays showed that, in MEK inhibitor resistant cell lines, AKT was activated through the EGFR/HER3/PI3K pathway following AZD6244 (ARRY-142886) treatment. Blockade of this feedback mechanism through the targeting of MEK and EGFR resulted in detectable synergistic effects in some cell lines in vitro and in vivo.

Surgery remains the only curative therapy, while perioperative and adjuvant chemotherapy, as well as chemoradiation, can improve outcome of resectable gastric cancer with extended lymph node dissection. More than half of radically resected gastric cancer patients relapse locally or with distant metastases, or receive the diagnosis of gastric cancer when tumor is disseminated; therefore, median survival rarely exceeds 12 mo, and 5-years survival is less than 10%. Cisplatin and fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy, with addition of trastuzumab in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive patients, is the widely used treatment in stage IV patients fit for chemotherapy. Recent evidence supports the use of second-line chemotherapy after progression in patients with good performance status. ",

Reliable biomarkers for the identification of patients who             are likely to benefit from this treatment are not available. In this study, we             assessed the activity of cetuximab in five gastric cancer cell lines (AGS, AZ521,             Hs746T, LMSU and MKN1). The viability of two of these cell lines, AZ521 and MKN1,             was significantly reduced by cetuximab treatment. High expression and secretion             levels of the EGFR-binding ligand, amphiregulin (AREG), were associated with cetuximab             responsiveness. MET activation and mutations in Kirsten-Ras gene (KRAS) were associated             with cetuximab resistance. By introducing a hierarchy between these markers, we             established a model that facilitated the correct classification of all five gastric             cancer cell lines as cetuximab responsive or non-responsive.

However, the mechanisms by which H. pylori causes cancer are currently unknown. Binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to its receptor (EGFR) may be important in the development of gastric cancer. This interaction accelerates cell proliferation and migration, and triggers epithelial cell signaling. In this study, we investigated the effects of H. pylori on EGFR- and AP-1-mediated signal transduction pathways in the AGS gastric epithelial cell line and gastric tissue from humans.;Cells were treated with H. pylori and cell death was examined at a variety of time points using cell viability and trypan blue exclusion dye assay. To investigate the effects on EGFR regulation, AGS cells were transfected with a full-length and truncated EGFR luciferase (luc) reporter. Tissue microarray containing 44 samples of gastric biopsies from H. pylori-positive patients was analyzed for protein expression level of EGFR by immunohistochemistry.;EGFR promoter activity was increased (twofold) 3 h after treatment with H. pylori commenced. Using a series of EGFR promoter deletion mutants, we identified a region that was crucial for transactivation of the EGFR by H. pylori. To determine whether AP-1 binding was altered, we transfected AGS cells with an AP-1 luciferase construct and then treated them with H. pylori for up to 6 h. We found that AP-1 activity was induced by H. pylori in gastric cells, while electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that binding of AP-1 to the EGFR promoter site was increased following H. pylori treatment. Binding of c-Jun and c-Fos to the EGFR promoter region -1,062/-900 was induced eight- and six fold, respectively, using ChIP assay. Active EGFR staining was markedly increased in gastric mucosa from infected persons, compared to uninfected controls.;We conclude that exposure of gastric cells to H. pylori induces increased production of EGFR through various signal transduction pathways, including those mediated by the EGFR and AP-1. Distinct effects on EGFR activation may specify the subset of AP-1 target genes that are selected, including those involved in proliferation and apoptosis. This is consistent with EGFR activation that was found in the gastric mucosa of humans infected with H. pylori. Hence, the balance between apoptosis and proliferation in these cells may be altered in response to injury caused by H. pylori infection, leading to an increased risk of cancer.",

Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), is the first approved molecularly targeted agent for HER2-overexpressing gastric cancer, which was found to prolong the OS and the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients. However, HER2 overexpression is present only in a minority of patients with gastric cancer. Hence, other targeted agents are urgently needed. Ramucirumab, a novel human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that selectively targets the extracellular domain of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), is regarded as a new standard second-line treatment for patients with advanced gastric cancer. The combination of two or more targeted agents directed against two different molecular targets may improve the survival of patients with advanced gastric cancer. Although great efforts have been made, the effect of targeted therapy for gastric cancer is limited. One key reason is that participants in clinical trials for new targeted agents were not selected by detection of the targeted molecule.

Lapatinib, a dual HER2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has shown promising in vitro results in treating HER2(+) cancer cells. However, several studies have shown that activation of alternative receptor tyrosine kinases can mediate resistance to HER-targeted therapy. Here, we investigated whether activated MET can confer resistance to lapatinib inhibition of gastric cancer cells. A panel of gastric cancer cell lines was treated with lapatinib, and we observed that cell proliferation was reduced by 70% and that the degree of HER2 amplification corresponds to sensitivity to lapatinib. Immunoblotting analysis indicated that phosphorylation of HER2, EGFR, MET, AKT, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase was inhibited by lapatinib and presumably led to cell-cycle arrest as observed with flow cytometry. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) activation of MET receptors rescued cells from lapatinib-induced growth inhibition by restimulating the downstream pathways and restoring normal cell-cycle progression. This rescue effect could be abrogated by inhibiting MET with PHA-665752 (a highly specific MET inhibitor) or downregulating MET expression with short interfering RNA. No synergy in growth inhibition was observed when cells were treated with a combination of lapatinib and PHA-665752. Repeat studies using insulin-like growth factor 1 and fibroblast growth factor 3 could not uniformly rescue the lapatinib-treated gastric cancer cells. In conclusion, HGF/MET-mediated resistance to lapatinib is a novel mechanism of resistance to HER2-targeted agents in gastric cancer cells. Development of inhibitors targeting multiple receptors or common downstream signaling proteins merits further investigation.",

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a rate-limiting enzyme for prostanoid biosynthesis, including prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), and plays a key role in both inflammation and cancer. It has been demonstrated that inhibition of COX-2 and PGE(2) receptor signaling results in the suppression of tumor development in a variety of animal models. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying COX-2/PGE(2)-associated inflammation in carcinogenesis have not yet been fully elucidated. In order to study the role of PGE(2)-associated inflammatory responses in tumorigenesis, it is important to use in vivo mouse models that recapitulate human cancer development from molecular mechanisms with construction of tumor microenvironment. We have developed a gastritis model (K19-C2mE mice) in which an inflammatory microenvironment is constructed in the stomach via induction of the COX-2/PGE(2) pathway. We also developed a gastric cancer mouse model (Gan mice) in which the mice develop inflammation-associated gastric tumors via activation of both the COX-2/PGE(2) pathway and Wnt signaling. Expression analyses using these in vivo models have revealed novel mechanisms of the inflammatory responses underlying gastric cancer development. PGE(2)-associated inflammatory responses activate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling through the induction of EGFR ligands and ADAMs that release EGFR ligands from the cell membrane. In Gan mice, a combination treatment with EGFR and COX-2 inhibitors significantly suppresses gastric tumorigenesis. Moreover, PGE(2)-associated inflammation downregulates tumor suppressor microRNA, miR-7, in gastric cancer cells, which suppresses epithelial differentiation. These results indicate that PGE(2)-associated inflammatory responses promote in vivo gastric tumorigenesis via several different molecular mechanisms.",

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the possibility of molecular therapy targeting HER2 overexpression in gastric cancer liver metastasis. We developed three new HER2-overexpressing gastric cancer cell lines (GLM-1, GLM-2, GLM-4) without epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations derived from such liver metastasis, two of which had HER2 gene amplifications. All these GLM series of cell lines were highly sensitive to gefitinib in vitro, a specific inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase (Iressa) rather than anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin), whereas most of the HER2 low-expressing counterparts were not. In these HER2-overexpressing GLM series, protein kinase B (Akt), but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), was constitutively phosphorylated, and gefitinib efficiently inhibited this Akt phosphorylation, induced strong apoptosis in vitro and exhibited antitumour activity in tumour xenografts in nude mice. This gefitinib-mediated antitumour effect in xenograft was significantly potentiated by trastuzumab treatment. On the other hand, gefitinib-resistant cells (GLM-1R) exhibited increased EGFR expression, followed by constitutive activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. These results suggest that the antitumour effect of gefitinib is due to the effective inhibition of HER2-driven constitutive activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, and that the acquired resistance to gefitinib is due to the constitutive activation of Ras/MAPK pathway in compensation for PI3K/Akt pathway. Gastric cancer liver metastasis with HER2 overexpression would be a potential molecular target for gefitinib and trastuzumab.",

Nonetheless, improving therapeutic efficacy and patient survival is important, particularly in patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer.

The two antibodies bind to sub-domain IV of the receptor, but have non-overlapping epitopes, allowing them to simultaneously bind HER2. Treatment with 1E11 alone induced apoptosis in HER2-positive cancer cells, and this effect was enhanced by combination treatment with trastuzumab. Combination treatment with 1E11 and trastuzumab reduced the levels of total HER2 protein and those of aberrant HER2 signaling molecules including phosphorylated HER3 and EGFR.

As gastric cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, systemic chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for these patients. However, no standard palliative chemotherapy regimen has been accepted for patients with metastatic gastric cancer. Palliative chemotherapy including fluoropyrimidine, platin compounds, docetaxel and epirubicin prolongs survival, and improves a high quality of life to a greater extent than best supportive care. The number of clinical investigations associated with targeted agents has recently increased. Agents targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor 1 and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) have been widely tested. Trastuzumab was the first target drug developed, and pivotal phase III trials showed improved survival when trastuzumab was integrated into cisplatin/fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy in patients with metastatic gastric cancer. Trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy was thus approved to be a new standard of care for patients with HER2-positive advanced esophagogastric adenocarcinoma. Thus, the evaluation of HER2 status in all patients with metastatic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma should be considered. Other agents targeting vascular endothelial growth factor, mammalian target of rapamycin, and other biological pathways have also been investigated in clinical trials, but showed little impact on the survival of patients.

Here, we analyzed the relationship between PAR1 activation, proliferation, invasion, and the signaling pathways downstream of PAR1 activation in gastric cancer.;We established a PAR1 stably transfected MKN45 human gastric cancer cell line (MKN45/PAR1) and performed cell proliferation and invasion assays employing this cell line and MKN28 cell line exposed to PAR1 agonists (alpha-thrombin and TFLLR-NH2). We also quantified NF-kappaB activation by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and the level of Tenascin-C (TN-C) expression in conditioned medium by ELISA of MKN45/PAR1 following administration of alpha-thrombin. A high molecular weight concentrate was derived from the resultant conditioned medium and subsequent cultures of MKN45/PAR1 and MKN28 were exposed to the resultant concentrate either in the presence or absence of TN-C-neutralizing antibody. Lysates of these subsequent cells were probed to quantify levels of phospholyrated Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR).;PAR1 in both PAR1/MKN45 and MKN28 was activated by PAR1 agonists, resulting in cell proliferation and matrigel invasion. We have shown that activation of NF-kappaB and EGFR phosphorylation initially were triggered by the activation of PAR1 with alpha-thrombin. Quantitative PCR and Western blot assay revealed up-regulation of mRNA and protein expression of NF-kappaB target genes, especially TN-C, a potential EGFR activator. The suppressed level of phosphorylated EGFR, observed in cells exposed to concentrate of conditioned medium in the presence of TN-C-neutralizing antibody, identifies TN-C as a putative autocrine stimulatory factor of EGFR possibly involved in the sustained PAR1 activation responses observed.;Our data indicate that in gastric carcinoma cells, PAR1 activation can trigger an array of responses that would promote tumor cell growth and invasion. Over expression of NF-kappaB, EGFR, and TN-C, are among the effects of PAR1 activation and TN-C induces EGFR activation in an autocrine manner.

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors were studied by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies to cyclooxygenase-2, epidermal growth factor receptor, and CD34. The immunohistochemical results were correlated with clinicopathological features and survival. In our study population, we found a male/female ratio of 72:43, a median age of 59 years, stage III and IV incidence of 66.9%, and a median follow-up of 96 months. Positive expression rates of cyclooxygenase-2 and epidermal growth factor receptor were 89.6 and 23.5%, respectively. The median microvascular density value was 52.5. When this value was determined as the cut-off point, 50% of patients were found to have high microvascular density. Epidermal growth factor receptor over-expression correlated with high microvascular density values, advanced lymph node involvement (N3), and TNM stage presentation (III and IV). Similarly, lymph node involvement was associated with cyclooxygenase-2 over-expression and high microvascular density. Univariate analysis showed that epidermal growth factor receptor over-expression, pathological T3 and T4 disease, and overall stage III and IV disease were adverse prognostic factors. On multivariate analysis using a Cox regression model, expression of epidermal growth factor receptor, and advanced TNM stage were significant adverse prognostic factors for overall survival.

Regenerating islet-derived family, member 4 (REG4) is believed to promote peritoneal metastasis, however, its mechanism is still a moot point at present. In the present study, we show that high expression of REG4 correlates with advanced stage and poor survival prognosis for gastric cancer patients. REG4 overexpression significantly enhances peritoneal metastasis by increasing adhesion ability. Moreover, SP1 is proved to be a transcription factor of REG4 and induce REG4 expression upon TGF-alpha stimulation. Also, G protein-coupled receptor 37 (GPR37) is identified to be in the same complex of REG4, which mediates REG4's signal transduction and promotes peritoneal metastasis of gastric cancer cell. Interestingly, we also discover a positive feedback loop triggered by REG4, amplifying itself through EGFR transactivation, consisting of GPR37, ADAM17, TGF-alpha, EGFR, SP1 and REG4. In conclusion, REG4 promotes peritoneal metastasis of gastric cancer through GPR37 and triggers a positive feedback loop. ",

Recently, heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) has been identified as a critical regulator of oncogenic protein stability, including EGFR, HER-2, and HIF-1alpha. We hypothesized that inhibition of Hsp90 impairs EGF- and hypoxia-mediated angiogenic signaling in gastric cancer cells and consequently inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth. In vitro, the geldanamycin derivate 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) led to marked reduction in constitutive and inducible activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, Akt, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and decreased nuclear HIF-1alpha protein. In addition, EGFR and HER-2 were down-regulated after Hsp90 inhibition. With respect to regulation of angiogenic molecules, 17-AAG significantly reduced EGF-mediated VEGF secretion. Phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and paxillin were both abrogated by 17-AAG, which resulted in significant impairment of cancer cell motility. Interestingly, cytotoxic effects of 17-AAG in vitro were higher on cancer cells and gastric fibroblasts than on pericytes. In vivo, the water-soluble compound 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG; 25 mg/kg, thrice per week) significantly reduced s.c. xenografted tumor growth. By immunohistochemistry, 17-DMAG significantly reduced vessel area and numbers of proliferating tumor cells in sections. Furthermore, similar significant growth-inhibitory effects of 17-DMAG were achieved when administered as low-dose therapy (5 mg/kg, thrice per week). In conclusion, blocking Hsp90 disrupts multiple proangiogenic signaling pathways in gastric cancer cells and inhibits xenografted tumor growth in vivo. Hence, gastric cancer harbors attractive molecular targets for therapy with Hsp90 inhibitors, which could lead to improved efficacy of antineoplastic therapy regimens.",

Coactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) plays a critical role in tumor response to targeted therapeutics. We examined concomitant overexpression of EGFR and MET in patients with HER2(+) and HER2(-) gastric cancers (GCs). Tissue microarray samples obtained from 1,589 GC patients who received R0 gastrectomy with extensive node dissection and adjuvant chemoradiationtherapy were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization. HER2(+) was observed in 169 patients (11%). Out of 169 HER2(+) patients, 15 (9%) were EGFR(+) and MET(+) , 29 (17%) were EGFR(+) , 37 (22%) were MET(+) and the remaining 88 patients (52%) were HER2(+) only, without concomitant EGFR or MET overexpression. Greater number of overexpressed RTKs correlated with younger age (p < 0.001), larger tumor size (p = 0.027), intestinal histology (p < 0.001) and shorter overall survival (p = 0.002). The mean overall survival was 113 months for HER2(-) /EGFR(-) /MET(-) and 63 months for HER2(+) /EGFR(+) /MET(+) subgroups. Patients with HER2(+) /EGFR(+) /MET(+) GCs had a substantial risk of death with a hazard ratio of 3.01 (95% CI: 1.54-5.90), compared with HER2(-) /EGFR(-) /MET(-) GC patients. Using patient-derived tumor cell models isolated from pericardial effusion of HER2(+) and MET(+) GC cases, we demonstrated that the combination of HER2-inhibitor (lapatinib) and MET-inhibitor offered a more profound inhibition in the ERK/AKT pathway and cell proliferation than lapatinib alone. Co-overexpression of RTKs was demonstrated in small subsets of GC associated with aggressive behavior and in these cases, combination therapy may be considered as potential treatment options. ",

Our previous study has shown that MYO5B is epigenetically silenced and associated with c-Met signaling in human gastric cancer. However, little is known of the function of Rab11-FIP2 in gastric cancer. In this study, we investigated Rab11-FIP2 expression by immunohistochemistry in 86 patients with gastric cancer. We found that the expression level of Rab11-FIP2 was significantly increased in gastric cancer tissues and high expression of Rab11-FIP2 was closely correlated with nodal metastasis in gastric cancer patients. Rab11-FIP2 overexpression promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in a manner associated with gastric cancer metastasis in vitro and in vivo. We also found that hypoxia could enhance the expression of Rab11-FIP2 through HIF-1α. Inactivation of Rab11-FIP2 dramatically decreased hypoxia-induced migration of gastric cancer cells. Suppression of the internalization of EGFR, at least in part, plays an important role in EMT induced by overexpression of Rab11-FIP2 in gastric cancer cells. Finally, we demonstrated that Rab11-FIP2 could regulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics. In conclusion, our findings reveal a novel mechanism underlying the role of Rab11-FIP2 in gastric cancer dissemination, suggesting that Rab11-FIP2 may be a promising candidate target for gastric cancer treatment.

Patients with advanced disease (locally advanced or metastatic) have a somber prognosis, with a median overall survival of 10-12 mo, and palliative chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment. In recent years, novel approaches using inhibition of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) have demonstrated significant improvements in progression-free and overall survival, compared with chemotherapy alone, in first-line treatment of patients with overexpression of HER2. In addition, both second-line chemotherapy and treatment with the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-inhibitor ramucirumab demonstrated significant benefits in terms of overall survival, compared with best supportive care, in randomized studies. Moreover, ramucirumab in combination with chemotherapy demonstrated further significant benefits in terms of progression-free and overall survival, compared with chemotherapy alone, in second-line treatment for patients with metastatic gastric cancer. A recently published molecular classification of gastric cancer is expected to improve patient stratification and selection for clinical trials and provide a roadmap for future drug development. Nevertheless, despite these developments the prognosis of patients with advanced gastric cancer remains poor. In this review we discuss current standards of care and outline major topics of drug development in gastric cancer. ",

Expression of EREG affects sensitivity to cetuximab a chimeric monoclonal antibody that inhibits the EGFR signaling pathway. The mechanism through which EREG is regulated is largely unknown, but a methyl-array study previously performed by our group revealed that EREG is methylated in gastric cancer cells. In this study, we found that EREG gene expression was low in 7 out of 11 gastric cancer cells and this downregulation was mediated by aberrant CpG methylation of the EREG promoter. Treatment with 5-aza-CdR restored EREG expression and demethylated CpG sites in the EREG promoter. Compared with DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), knock-down of DNA methyltransferase 3b (DNMT3b) significantly increased the expression of EREG and led to the demethylation of specific CpG sites in the EREG promoter, suggesting that DNMT3b primarily regulates CpG methylation and silencing of the EREG gene. EREG methylation was observed in 30% (4/13) of human primary gastric tumor tissues we evaluated. In addition to DNA methylation, results from a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that transcriptional levels of EREG were associated with the enrichment of active histone marks (H3K4me3 and AcH3) and of a repressive mark (H3K27me2). Treatment with 5-aza-CdR dynamically increased the low occupancy of H3K4me3 and AcH3, while decreasing the high enrichment of H3K27me2, indicating that dynamic histone modifications contribute to EREG regulation in addition to DNA methylation. Finally, the combination of 5-aza-CdR and cetuximab exerted a synergistic anti-proliferative effect on gastric cancer cells. Taken together, the results of our study showed for the first time that EREG is epigenetically silenced in gastric cancer cells by aberrant DNA methylation and histone modification.",

In this study, we have characterized the effect of four E-cadherin germline missense mutations (T340A, A634V, P799R and V832M) in the interaction with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We challenged the hypothesis that E-cadherin mutations perturb its ability to bind to EGFR, leading to constitutional activation of the EGFR, triggering activation of downstream effectors. We verified that missense mutations localized in the extracellular domain of the protein (T340A and A634V) exhibited reduced stability of the EGFR/E-cadherin heterodimers in contrast to germline mutations localized at the cytoplasmatic domain of the protein (P799R and V832M). We observed that cells expressing E-cadherin extracellular mutants displayed increased levels of phosphorylated EGFR upon ligand stimulation, when compared with cells expressing wild-type E-cadherin or intracellular mutants. We showed that upon treatment of E-cadherin extracellular mutant cells with the EGFR inhibitor, the increase of RhoA activation is abrogated and accompanied by decreased migratory behaviour, supporting the idea that Rho-like proteins are EGFR downstream effectors. Our results bring new insights into the understanding of the distinct in vitro behaviours observed for E-cadherin missense mutations localized in different domains of the protein. Furthermore, we demonstrate that E-cadherin-dependent EGFR activation contributes to enhanced cell motility, in a mechanism involving RhoA activation.",

We aimed to reveal the genetic mechanisms underlying GC syndrome differentiation (ZHENG) in a population of 387 GC patients. Twenty-nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in EGF, TGFA, and EGFR were investigated. Two SNPs, rs11466285 in TGFA and rs884225 in EGFR, were significantly associated with the distribution of ZHENG (P < 0.05). The rs11466285 TT genotype increased the risk of damp heat with toxin (DHT) and deficiency of both Qi and yin (DQY) compared with obstruction of blood stasis (OBS). The rs884225 AA genotype could increase the risk of DQY and deficiency of both Qi and blood (DQB) compared with yin deficiency due to stomach heat (YDSH). Parallel comparison among the SNPs and syndrome types revealed that DQB was distinct from YDSH, disharmony between the liver and stomach, stagnation of phlegm muddiness (SPM), OBS, and other syndromes at several SNP loci (P < 0.05). The rs11466285 TT and rs884225 AA genotypes exhibit increased risk of DQB compared with OBS and SPM (P < 0.05), respectively.

High expression of receptor type tyrosine kinases (RTKs) has repeatedly represented poor prognosis for cancers. However it has not been demonstrated whether RTKs have prognostic relevance for stage II/III gastric cancer with standard treatment. Tumor tissues were obtained from 167 stage II/III advanced gastric cancer patients who underwent curative surgery and received postoperative S-1 chemotherapy from 2000 to 2010. Expression of the RTKs including EGFR, HER2, HER3, IGF-1R, and EphA2 was analyzed using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Analysis using a multivariate proportional hazard model identified the most significant RTKs that represented independent prognostic relevance. When tumor HER3 expression was classified into IHC 1+/2+ (n = 98) and IHC 0 (n = 69), the cumulative 5-year Relapse Free Survival (5y-RFS) was 56.5 and 82.9%, respectively (P = 0.0034). Significant prognostic relevance was similarly confirmed for IGF-1R (P = 0.014), and EGFR (P = 0.030), but not for EphA2 or HER2 expression. Intriguingly, HER3 expression was closely correlated with IGF-1R (P < 0.0001, R = 0.41), and EphA2 (P < 0.0001, R = 0.34) expression.

Of the 53 patients who recurred, 40 patients (75.5%) were HER3-positive. Thus, of the RTKs studied, HER3 was the only RTK identified as an independent prognostic indicator of stage II/III advanced gastric cancer with standard treatment. ",

Surgical treatment is the only therapeutic modality that has a potentially curative effect. According to certain criteria, early gastric cancer limited to the mucosa or submucosa is indicated for endoscopic mucosal resection. In advanced gastric cancer with surgical approach, the questions of type of resection, extent of lymph node dissection and indication for splenectomy do arise. R0 resection represented with macroscopic- and microscopic-free resection margins is the ultimate goal for a surgeon. Chemotherapy is the treatment of choice in stage IV for unresectable disease. According to numerous randomized controlled trials, adjuvant chemotherapy versus chemoradiotherapy have been accepted for stages Ib-IIIb of this disease. Combination chemotherapy seems to be more effective than monotherapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is administered with the aim to downstage a locally advanced tumor prior to attempting curative resection. New therapeutic possibilities include agents like angiogenesis inhibitors, human epidermal growth factor receptor family inhibitors and inhibitors of small molecules (tyrosine kinase inhibitors).

However, 54% of patients appeared to have had suboptimal surgery. The fact that adjuvant therapy reduced locoregional (and not distant) relapse suggests that its benefit may lie in compensating for inadequate dissection. Combined modality therapy was associated with moderate toxicity, but a high requirement for changes in radiation planning. Therefore, the role and feasibility of adjuvant radiotherapy needs to be confirmed in patients operated on in Western Europe. Several approaches to the development of early systemic therapy in gastric cancer are being pursued. These include the evaluation of cisplatin-based adjuvant regimens, the use of neoadjuvant treatment, the incorporation into adjuvant and neoadjuvant regimens of newer cytotoxics such as docetaxel and irinotecan, and the assessment of novel, molecularly targeted agents such as the epidermal growth factor receptor and angiogenesis inhibitors.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is a novel class of therapeutics for cancer target therapy. This study assessed antitumor activity of ADC with an antimitotic agent, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) and a humanized monoclonal anti-HER2 antibody, hertuzumab, in gastric cancer. The efficacy of hertuzumab-MC-Val-Cit-PAB-MMAE (hertuzumab-vcMMAE) on human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive human gastric cancer cells, NCI-N87, was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The cytotoxicity of hertuzumab was significantly enhanced after conjugation with MMAE. Compared to trastuzumab, hertuzumab had a higher affinity to HER2 and had more potent antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity in vitro. After conjugation with MMAE, the binding specificity for HER2 was not affected. Furthermore, the internalization of hertuzumab-vcMMAE in HER2 positive gastric cancer cells was verified. Although the conjugation of hertuzumab and MMAE decreased the ADCC effect, the overall cytotoxicity was dramatically increased in HER2 positive gastric cancer cells. In vitro data on this hertuzumab-vcMMAE has exerted much stronger antitumor activity compared to trastuzumab-DM1 in HER2 positive gastric cancer cells. A single administration of hertuzumab-vcMMAE at 5 or 10 mg/kg showed high potency and a sustained tumor inhibitory effect on NCI-N87 xenografts in mice. In conclusion, hertuzumab-vcMMAE conjugate is a highly effective anti-HER2 targeted therapy for HER2-positive gastric cancer. ",

Fluoropyrimidines include 5-fluorouracil(5-FU), S-1, and capecitabine. There has been an accumulation of data showing the non-inferiority of oxaliplatin to cisplatin. Moreover, the importance of salvage chemotherapy has also been proven in prospective studies. However, retrospective analyses still indicate that the 5-year survival rates associated with metastatic gastric cancer are only a few percent with chemotherapy. To improve survival, newer triplet regimens, such as a combination of docetaxel, cisplatin, and S-1(DCS)and modified folinic acid, 5-FU, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan(modified FOLFOXIRI), are now under clinical investigation. Despite the limitations of retrospective data, surgical resection for gastric cancer liver metastases appears to be beneficial in carefully selected patients.

Conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy has limited efficacy for metastatic gastric cancer, with an overall survival of approximately ten months. Recent advances in high-throughput technologies have enabled the implementation of personalized cancer therapy for high-risk patients. The use of such high-throughput technologies, including microarray and next generation sequencing, have promoted the discovery of novel targets that offer new treatment strategies for patients lacking other therapeutic options. Many molecular pathways are currently under investigation as therapeutic targets in gastric cancer, including those related to the epidermal growth factor receptor family, the mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor axis, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin factors. Advances in molecular diagnostic tools further support the discovery of new molecular targets. Limitations exist, however; not all patients can be tested for biomarkers, and numerous challenges hamper implementation of targeted therapy in clinical settings. Indeed, the scale of tumor genomic profiling is rapidly outpacing our ability to appropriately synthesize all the information in order to optimally refine patient care. Therefore, clinicians must continue to educate themselves regarding new tools and frameworks, and to utilize multidisciplinary team science, comprised of oncologists, geneticists, pathologists, biologists and bioinformaticians, to successfully implement this genomic approach therapeutically.

ABT-869 and chemotherapeutic agents exhibited a strong synergy to inhibit the viability of several gastric cancer cell lines, with combination index values ranging from 0.017 to 0.589. Additionally, the combination of ABT-869 and chemotherapeutic agents led to remarkable suppression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, in a preclinical gastric cancer xenograft mouse model, drug co-treatments led to increased mouse survival as well as a synergistic reduction in tumor size and the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. Mechanistic studies further revealed that all of the co-treatments containing ABT-869 resulted in decreased activation of the VEGF receptor, the epidermal growth factor receptor and the insulin growth factor receptor. Inhibition of these receptor tyrosine kinases consequently attenuated the activation of the downstream AKT/mTOR signaling pathway both in cultured gastric cancer cells and in gastric cancer xenografts. Collectively, our findings suggest that the addition of ABT-869 to traditional chemotherapies may be a promising strategy for the treatment of human gastric cancer. ",

One tissue block for each of 88 primary tumors and 60 paired primary tumors and metastases was examined for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status by immunohistochemistry using 3 different antibodies (HercepTest, CB11, and 4B5) and by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Two additional tissue blocks of the primary tumor were tested by immunohistochemistry if the results were negative on the first tissue block.

Clinical trials using lapatinib in HER2-positive gastric cancer are also currently underway. As with other molecularly targeted agents, the emergence of acquired resistance to HER2-directed treatment is an imminent therapeutic problem for HER2-positive gastric cancer. In order to investigate the mechanisms of acquired resistance to HER2-directed treatment in gastric cancer, we generated lapatinib-resistant gastric cancer cell lines (SNU216 LR) in vitro by chronic exposure of a HER2-positive gastric cancer cell line (SNU216) to lapatinib. The resultant SNU216 LR cells were also resistant to gefitinib, cetuximab, trastuzumab, afatinib and dacomitinib. Interestingly, SNU216 LR cells displayed an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype and maintained the activation of MET, HER3, Stat3, Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in the presence of lapatinib. Using gene expression arrays, we identified the upregulation of a variety of EMT-related genes and extracellular matrix molecules, such as Testican-1, in SNU216 LR cells. We showed that the inhibition of Testican-1 by small interfering RNA decreased Testican-1-induced, MET-dependent, downstream signaling, and restored sensitivity to lapatinib in these cells. Furthermore, treatment with XAV939 selectively inhibited β-catenin-mediated transcription and Testican-1-induced EMT signaling, leading to G1 arrest. Taken together, these data support the potential role of EMT in acquired resistance to HER2-directed treatment in HER2-positive gastric cancer, and provide insights into strategies for preventing and/or overcoming this resistance in patients.

In this study, we aimed to determine the frequency of gene mutations in members of these pathways--Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA and MLK3 in a series of 63 gastric carcinomas with high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI).;Gene mutation analysis was performed by PCR amplification followed by direct sequencing. In selected tumour cases, EGFR expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Association studies between molecular data and clinicopathologic characteristics were performed.;Mutations in EGFR (3'-untranslated region [UTR] polyA repeat), KRAS, PIK3CA and MLK3 genes occurred in 30 (47.6%), 11 (17.5%), 9 (14.3%) and 2 (3.2%) of the MSI gastric cancer (GC) cases, respectively. No BRAF or EGFR hotspot mutations were identified. Overall, mutations in at least one of these genes were found in 55.6% (35/63) of gastric carcinomas. From those mutant cases 40.0% (14/35) of them had concomitant gene mutations, always involving EGFR polyA deletions. Interestingly, we observed significant associations between oncogenic mutations and female gender (p = 0.046) old age of diagnosis (p = 0.001) and intestinal subtype (p = 0.043).;Our results show that MSI gastric carcinoma frequently shows activation of EGFR-MAPK and PI3K pathways. Within all alterations found, deletions of the A13 repeats of EGFR were common, suggesting this molecular event as an important biomarker for stratification of GC patients for treatment with EGFR inhibitors.",

Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either NCS or CS. The treatment consisted of 3-week cycles of twice-daily S-1 40 mg/m² (on days 1-14) and intravenous cisplatin 30 mg/m² (on days 1, 2), with or without weekly nimotuzumab (200 mg/m²). The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). The second endpoint included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), safety and association between efficacy and tumor epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression. Between October, 2009, and February, 2012, we enrolled 62 patients in Cancer Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS). The ORR for 31 patients allocated NCS was 54.8% compared with 58.1% for 31 patients who were allocated to receive CS alone (P = 0.798). Median PFS for patients in CS arm was significantly improved than that in NCS arm [7.2 months vs. 4.8 months HR = 2.136 (95% CI 1.193-3.826), P = 0.011].

Many molecular-targeted therapies inhibiting signaling pathways of various tyrosine kinase receptors have been developed, and monoclonal antibodies targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 or vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 have become standard therapy for GC. Hepatocyte growth factor and its receptor, c-MET (MET), play key roles in tumor growth through activated signaling pathways from receptor in GC cells. Genomic amplification of MET leads to the aberrant activation found in GC tumors and is related to survival in patients with GC. This review discusses the clinical significance of MET in GC and examines MET as a potential therapeutic target in patients with GC. Preclinical studies in animal models have shown that MET antibodies or small-molecule MET inhibitors suppress tumor-cell proliferation and tumor progression in MET-amplified GC cells.

Several MET inhibitors have recently entered clinical trials; however, as with other molecularly targeted agents, resistance is likely to develop. Therefore, elucidating possible mechanisms of resistance is of clinical interest. We hypothesized that collateral growth factor receptor pathway activation can overcome the effects of MET inhibition in MET-amplified cancer cells by reactivating key survival pathways. Treatment of MET-amplified GTL-16 and MKN-45 gastric cancer cells with the highly selective MET inhibitor PHA-665752 abrogated MEK/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling, resulting in cyclin D1 loss and G(1) arrest. PHA-665752 also inhibited baseline phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER-3, which are transactivated via MET-driven receptor cross-talk in these cells. However, MET-independent HER kinase activation using EGF (which binds to and activates EGFR) or heregulin-beta1 (which binds to and activates HER-3) was able to overcome the growth-inhibitory effects of MET inhibition by restimulating MEK/MAPK and/or PI3K/AKT signaling, suggesting a possible escape mechanism. Importantly, dual inhibition of MET and HER kinase signaling using PHA-665752 in combination with the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib or in combination with inhibitors of MEK and AKT prevented the above rescue effects. Our results illustrate that highly targeted MET tyrosine kinase inhibition leaves MET oncogene-\"addicted\" cancer cells vulnerable to HER kinase-mediated reactivation of the MEK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways, providing a rationale for combined inhibition of MET and HER kinase signaling in MET-amplified tumors that coexpress EGFR and/or HER-3.",

Since the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status of her gastric cancer specimen was strongly positive, docetaxel plus trastuzumab was administered for three cycles. However, the lymph node metastasis appeared to enlarge and abdominal pain worsened. Therefore, combination chemotherapy with lapatinib and weekly trastuzumab was initiated. A computed tomographic scan after 3 months of treatment showed stable disease. Although dose reduction of lapatinib was necessary due to Grade 3 diarrhea, the patient has continued this treatment on an outpatient basis without signs of disease progression for 8 months after initiation. In this case, trastuzumab plus lapatinib resulted in durable stable disease, despite the appearance of progression during prior chemotherapy with trastuzumab.",

Combination therapies with HER2-targeting agents and cytotoxic agents are considered a potential therapeutic option for gastric cancer with HER2 amplification. We have now investigated the effects of combination treatment with the oral fluoropyrimidine S-1 and the HER2-targeting agents lapatinib or trastuzumab in gastric cancer cells with or without HER2 amplification. We used 5-fluorouracil (5FU) instead of S-1 for in vitro experiments, given that tegafur, a component of S-1, is metabolized to 5FU in the liver. The combination of 5FU and HER2-targeting agents synergistically inhibited cell proliferation and exhibited an enhanced proapoptotic effect in gastric cancer cells with HER2 amplification, but not in those without it. Lapatinib or trastuzumab also induced downregulation of thymidylate synthase (TS) expression and activity only in cells with HER2 amplification. The combination of 5FU and TS depletion by RNA interference also exhibited an enhanced proapoptotic effect in cells with HER2 amplification. These observations thus suggest that lapatinib-induced or trastuzumab-induced downregulation of TS is responsible, at least in part, for the synergistic antitumor effect of combined treatment with 5FU and HER2-targeting agents. The antitumor effect of the combination of S-1 and HER2-targeting agents in vivo was also greater than that of either drug alone. Our preclinical findings thus indicate that the combination of S-1 and HER2-targeting agents is a promising treatment option for gastric cancer with HER2 amplification.",

The aim of this study is to identify the responsible receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) potentially conferring lapatinib unresponsiveness in HER2+ gastric cancer and elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying this RTKs-induced resistance.;A functional RNAi screen targeting human RTKs and related growth factors was used to identify candidate RTKs conferring lapatinib unresponsiveness in HER2+ gastric cancer cells. Independent siRNAs transfection and corresponding ligands supplement were performed to validate the effects of candidate RTKs on lapatinib sensitivity. Cross-talks of pathways involved were analyzed via Western blot analysis. Cell apoptosis and cell motility were detected using FACS system and Transwell assay. Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze protein expression in clinical samples.;MET, HER3, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1R, and INSR were identified to mediate lapatinib unresponsiveness in HER2+ gastric cancer cells. Activation of these bypass RTKs attenuated lapatinib-induced apoptosis and suppression of cell motility, mechanistically because of restimulating the shared downstream AKT or ERK signaling, as well as restimulating WNT signaling and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like process. Patients' specimens revealed that these unresponsiveness-conferring RTKs were particularly enriched in the majority of patients with HER2+ gastric cancer.;MET, HER3, IGF1R, and INSR pathways activation represent novel mechanism underlying lapatinib unresponsiveness in HER2+ gastric cancer.

After the discovery of targeted therapies, research has focused on the new treatment options for AGC. In the last two decades, many targeted molecules were developed against AGC. Currently, two targeted therapy molecules have been approved for patients with AGC. In 2010, trastuzumab was the first molecule shown to improve survival in patients with HER2-positive AGC as part of a first-line combination regimen. In 2014, ramucirumab was the second targeted molecule to improve survival rates and was suggested as treatment for patients with AGC who had progressed after first-line platinum plus fluoropyrimidine with or without anthracycline chemotherapy. Ramucirumab was the first targeted therapy acting as a single agent in patients with advanced gastroesophageal cancers. Although these two molecules were introduced into clinical use, many other promising molecules have been tested in phase I-II trials. It is obvious that in the near future many different targeted therapies will be in use for treatment of AGC. In this review, the current status of targeted therapies in the treatment of AGC and gastroesophageal junction tumors, including HER (2-3) inhibitors, epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, antiangiogenic agents, c-MET inhibitors, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, agents against other molecular pathways fibroblast growth factor, Claudins, insulin-like growth factor, heat shock proteins, and immunotherapy, will be discussed.",

The median overall survival (OS) is less than one year for advanced GC patients; thus, there is an urgent unmet need to develop novel therapy for GC.

It is the first single agent approved for previously treated GC and the second biologic agent after trastuzumab. Even with limited success, targeted therapy may be improved by developing new biomarkers.

Our and others studies showed that the inhibition of EGFR pathway activation could increase the sensitivity of TRAIL in cancer cells. But the detailed mechanism is not fully understood. In the present study, compared with TRAIL or cetuximab (an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody) alone, treatment with the TRAIL/cetuximab combination significantly promoted death receptor 4 (DR4) clustering as well as the translocation of both DR4 and Fas-associated death domain-containing protein (FADD) into lipid rafts. This in turn resulted in caspase-8 cleavage and the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) in these lipid rafts. Cholesterol-depletion with methyl-β-cyclodextrin partially prevented DR4 clustering and DISC formation, and thus partially reversed apoptosis induced by the TRAIL/cetuximab dual treatment. These results indicate that cetuximab increases TRAIL-induced gastric cancer cell apoptosis at least partially through the promotion of DISC formation in lipid rafts. ",

Cell transfection and selection of stable cell lines and the gene and protein levels of HER2 and MMP-9 were examined to determine the molecular relationship between them in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer. We demonstrated that vector-based shRNA significantly knocked down the expression of HER2 and considerably inhibited both the migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells. HER2 knockdown resulted in the downregulation of the expression of MMP-9, whereas HER2 overexpression improved the transcription of MMP-9 through the activation of an MMP-9 promoter. The promoter region of MMP-9 between -2500 and -2000 bp was found to be crucial for the upregulation of HER2-mediated transcription. Furthermore, a truncated promoter (-70 to +63) did not display any transcriptional activity. Cell invasion activity was almost completely inhibited when MMP-9 was knocked down. Conversely, the overexpression of MMP-9 partly rescued the invasion ability of cell strains with knockdown HER2. These findings help further understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which HER2 promotes malignancy, and suggest that targeting both HER2 and MMP-9 may be required to effectively block HER2 signaling in gastric cancer therapy.

Since the successful targeting of amplified ERBB2 with a humanized monoclonal antibody, the amplified genes of other receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR, FGFR2, and MET, as well as those of other cell regulator genes, are being considered as candidate targets of molecular therapy. The aim of the present study was to determine the amplification status of 26 genes, which are frequently amplified in solid cancers, in advanced gastric cancers. A total of 93 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded advanced gastric cancer tissues were examined by multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification, and 32 cases with 'gain' or 'amplified' status of 16 genes were further examined for the respective gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and for the respective protein overexpression by immunohistochemistry. The frequencies of gene amplifications in advanced gastric cancers were as follows: ERBB2 (13 cases, 14%), FGFR2 (7 cases, 8%), MYC (7 cases, 8%), TOP2A (7 cases, 8%), MET (4 cases, 4%), MDM2 (4 cases, 4%), CCND1 (3 cases, 3%), FGF10 (2 cases, 3%), and EGFR (1 case, 1%). Amplification of the receptor tyrosine kinases genes occurred in a mutually exclusive manner except for one tumor in which ERBB2 and FGFR2 were both amplified but in different cancer cells. Co-amplification of ERBB2 and MYC, and EGFR and CCND1, in single nuclei but on different amplicons, was confirmed in one case each. Attempts at correlating the FISH status with the immunohistochemical staining pattern showed variable results from complete concordance to no correlation. In conclusion, combination of multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification and FISH analysis is a feasible approach for obtaining the semi-comprehensive genetic information that is necessary for personalized molecular targeted therapy.

In this study, we investigated the effect of combining T-DM1 and pertuzumab on xenografted gastric tumors. T-DM1 as a single agent showed significant antitumor activity in all the three HER2-high expression tumor models tested (NCI-N87, SCH and 4-1ST) but was ineffective against two HER2-low expression tumors (SNU-16 and MKN-28). Using the T-DM1-sensitive NCI-N87 model, the combination efficacy of T-DM1 and pertuzumab was elucidated. The combination induced significant tumor regression, whereas T-DM1 or pertuzumab alone did not. In cultured NCI-N87 cells stimulated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) or heregulin-α, concomitant treatment of T-DM1 and pertuzumab significantly inhibited proliferation and increased caspase 3/7 activity compared to either agent alone. Only the combination significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of EGFR or HER3, and its downstream factor AKT.

As a result, proposed TNrM system may predict survival more accurately than the present TNM staging system for patients undergoing limited lymph node analysis. It could adjust stage migration when the lymph node number was used as staging factor. Although correlation of the number of metastatic lymph nodes and lymph node ratio is obvious, biological characteristics other than that could also have been reflected on. It may indicate how successful the operation of lymph node dissection was, or it may be revealing the potential of the patient's lymph node immune-reaction. Recently, high lymph node ratio is closely associated with EGFR expression in advanced gastric cancer. When efficiency of applying lymph node ratio as a biomarker is verified and confirmed in an expansive research, and when cancer causing molecules are identified, as well as the competence as a treatment target is studied, the new biomarker, namely, lymph node ratio, could find itself in a limelight in gastric cancer treatment in the future.

The aim of our study was to analyze whether the over-expression of HER2/neu significantly predicts poor outcomes of pN0 EGC.;Sixty-seven patients who underwent operative resection for pN0 EGC was enrolled. The HER2/neu status was examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).;The HER2/neu-positive rate was 16.4%.

With TPT, DT-13 promoted EGFR ubiquitin--mediated degradation through myosin IIA-induced and Src/ caveolin-1 (Cav-1)-induced endocytosis of EGFR; inhibited EGFR downstream signalling and then increased the pro-apoptotic effects. Moreover, the synergistic pro-apoptotic efficacy of DT-13 and TPT in GCs with high EGFR expression was eliminated by both the NM II inhibitor (-)-blebbistatin and MYH-9 shRNA. The combination therapy of DT-13 with TPT showed stronger anti-tumour effects in vivo compared with their individual effects.

Recent evidence that HER3 is responsible for tumor resistance to therapeutic agents targeting EGFR or HER2/neu, along with the new findings that HER3 is involved in the process of dedifferentiation of gastric cancer (GC) have highlighted the critical role of HER3 in cancer research. HER3 is becoming a new targeted molecule in cancer treatment. Here, we comparatively investigated the expression of HER2/neu and HER3 in gastric cancer of two pathologic types (intestinal type and diffuse type) using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and analyzed the correlation between overexpression of HER2 and HER3 and clinicopathologic parameters.;An IHC study for HER2 and HER3 was performed on 102 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens of GC-60 intestinal and 42 diffuse types. The correlation between overexpression of HER2 and HER3 and clinicopathologic parameters was statistically analyzed.;In the GC group, overexpression of HER2 and HER3 was detected in 19 (18.6%) and 14 (13.7%) of 102 GC patients, respectively. In a nontumorous group of 102 specimens, 5 were HER2-positive (4.9%) (18.6% vs. 4.9%, p < 0.01), and 2 were HER3-positive (2.0%) (13.7% vs. 2.0%, p < 0.01). No co-overexpression of HER2 and HER3 was observed. The intestinal type of GC exhibited a higher rate of HER2 overexpression than did the diffuse type (26.7% vs. 7.1%, p < 0.05), whereas the diffuse type of GC exhibited a significantly higher rate of HER3 overexpression than did the intestinal type (26.2% vs. 5.0%, p < 0.01).

Thus: the ability to modulate the functional activity of these receptors is an attractive target for diagnostic intervention. In this study we examined the effect of a well characterised tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RG13022) on the cellular proliferation and EGF activated tyrosine kinase signalling pathway of two primary gastric cell lines: MKN45 and N87. RG13022 has a dose dependent, antiproliferative effect on both gastric cell lines when grown either in serum-free conditions or in the presence of FCS. Western blotting revealed RG13022 caused an inhibition of EGF stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFr in A431 cells and both EGFr and c-erbB-2 in MKN45 cells. No clear modulation of EGFr or c-erbB-2 phosphorylation was observed in N87 cells. In both A431 cells and N87 cells (which overexpress EGFr and c-erbB-2 respectively) exposed to EGF, MAP2 kinase immunoblot analysis resulted in the detection of a second protein band with reduced migration in SDS-PAGE. In N87 cells, this protein appeared to co-mi,orate with a strongly tyrosine phosphorylated protein, which suggests that it is a hyper-phosphorylated form of MAP2 kinase. However, treatment with RG13022, whilst inhibiting phosphorylation of this protein, did not prevent a shift in gel mobility (suggestive of activation) of MAP2 kinase in response to EGF. These findings demonstrate that the tyrphostin RG13022 inhibits cell proliferation of two primary gastric cancer cell lines. Investigation of intracellular signalling pathways suggests that alterations in intracellular signalling are responsible for the actions of RG 13022 in these cells. The biochemical analysis revealed that in N87 and A431, cells which overexpress c-erbB-2 and EGFr respectively, the tyrphostin affects the MAP2 kinase immunoreactivity and migration on SDS gels but fails to affect this protein in the MKN45 cell line. This data questions the usefulness of MAP2 kinase gel shift assays as markers of activation but supports the further development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors as potential inhibitors of gastric tumour proliferation.",

In addition, adjuvant therapy with capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) improved the survival of patients who received curative D2 gastrectomy (CLASSIC trial). However, the efficacy of the combination of trastuzumab with XELOX for patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer remains unknown. The aim of this study, was to investigate the efficacy of the combination of trastuzumab with XELOX in a HER2-positive human gastric cancer xenograft model. Combination treatment with these three agents (trastuzumab 20 mg/kg, capecitabine 359 mg/kg and oxaliplatin 10 mg/kg), was found to exhibit a significantly stronger antitumor activity in NCI-N87 xenografts compared with either trastuzumab or XELOX alone. In this model, treatment with trastuzumab alone or trastuzumab plus oxaliplatin enhanced the expression of thymidine phosphorylase (TP), a key enzyme in the generation of 5-FU from capecitabine in tumor tissues.

        "Doc_abstract":"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) pathway plays a pivotal role in the progression of human gastric cancer. The angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been shown to be induced by EGF in various cancer cell lines. Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) acts as a coreceptor for VEGF-165 and increases its affinity for VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) in endothelial cells. Furthermore, NRP-1 has been found to be expressed by tumour cells and has been shown to enhance tumour angiogenesis and growth in preclinical models. We examined the expression of NRP-1 mRNA and EGF-R protein in seven human gastric cancer cell lines. NRP-1 expression was expressed in five of seven cell lines, and EGF-R expression closely mirrored NRP-1 expression. Moreover, in EGF-R-positive NCI-N87 and ST-2 cells, EGF induced both NRP-1 and VEGF mRNA expression. C225, a monoclonal antibody to EGF-R, blocked EGF-induced NRP-1 and VEGF expression in NCI-N87 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The treatment of NCI-N87 cells with EGF resulted in increases in phosphorylation of Erk1/2, Akt, and P38. Blockade of the Erk, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt, or P38 pathways in this cell line prevented EGF induction of NRP-1 and VEGF. These results suggest that regulation of NRP-1 expression in human gastric cancer is intimately associated with the EGF/EGF-R system. Activation of EGF-R might contribute to gastric cancer angiogenesis by a mechanism that involves upregulation of VEGF and NRP-1 expression via multiple signalling pathways.",

The prognostic value of HER2 in gastric cancer remains controversial. Intestinal type gastric cancer has better prognosis and higher HER2 positive proportion. What is the interaction between these two factors? We hypothesized that a combination of Lauren-classification and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status (L-H status) might be more meaningful than either factor alone.;We collected 838 gastric cancer patients at all stages who had received treatment in our cancer center. This study was registered in the website of ClinicalTrials.Gov, with the number NCT01927146. We divided the patients into six groups according to their L-H status: Group A, HER2 negative and intestinal type; Group B, HER2 positive and intestinal type; Group C, HER2 negative and diffuse type; Group D, HER2 positive and diffuse type; Group E, HER2 negative and mixed type; and Group F, HER2 positive and mixed type.;Diffuse type and intestinal type accounted for 51.0% and 33.9%, respectively. The proportion of HER2 positive patients was 11.2%, 25.4%, 2.1% and 10.2% in the whole patient group, intestinal, diffuse and mixed type, respectively. Median overall survival was 34.0 months, 25.3 months, 27.6 months, 19.2 months, 25.9 months and 26.4 months in the six groups patients, P = 0.053. There was a significant difference in survival among the first four groups (P < 0.001). HER2 was an independent prognostic factor in the intestinal type and in stage I + II patients, but not in the diffuse type or stage III + IV patients. L-H status was an independent prognostic factor in patients at all stages. For the diffuse and intestinal types, the multivariate analysis showed that HER2 was not an independent prognostic factor, while Lauren classification and L-H status were. Moreover, L-H status was a better prognostic factor than the Lauren classification.;L-H status is a prognostic factor in diffuse and intestinal type patients, but not in the mixed type.

HER2 gene amplification and protein expression were examined using fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded gastric cancer samples from all patients. For scoring, Hofmann's HER2 gastric cancer scoring system was adopted. All cases showing IHC3+ or FISH positivity were defined as HER2 positive. Patient clinicopathological data and survival information were collected. Finally, χ² statistical analysis was performed to analyze the HER2 positivity rate amongst the subgroups with different clinicopathological characteristics including; gender, age, tumor location, Lauren classification, differentiation, TNM staging, depth of invasion, lymph node metastases and distant metastasis. The probability of survival for different subgroups with different clinicopathological characteristics was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and survival curves plotted using log rank inspection.;According to Hofmann's HER2 gastric cancer scoring criteria, 31 cases (15.74%) were identified as HER2 gene amplified and 19 cases (9.64%) were scored as strongly positive for HER2 membrane staining (3+), 25 cases (12.69%) were moderately positive (2+) and 153 cases (77.66%) were HER2 negative (0/1+). The concordance rate between IHC and FISH analyses was 88.83% (175/197). Thirty-six cases were defined as positive for HER2 gene amplification and/or protein expression, with 24 of these cases being eligible for Herceptin treatment according to United States recommendations, and 29 of these cases eligible according to EU recommendations. Highly consistent results were detected between IHC3+, IHC0/1 and FISH (73.68% and 95.42%), but low consistency was observed between IHC2+ and FISH (40.00%). The positivity rates in intestinal type and well-differentiated gastric cancer were higher than those in diffuse/mixed type and poorly-differentiated gastric cancer respectively (28.57% vs 13.43%, P = 0.0103; 37.25% vs 11.64%, P < 0.0001), but were not correlated with gender, age, tumor location or TNM stage, depth of invasion, lymph node metastases and distant metastasis. In poorly-differentiated gastric cancer patients, those without lymph node metastasis showed a higher HER2 positivity rate than those with lymph node metastasis (26.47% vs 7.14%, P = 0.0021). This association was not present in those patients with well-differentiated gastric cancer (28.57% vs 43.33%, P = 0.2832). Within our patient cohort, 26 cases were lost to follow-up. The median survival time for the remaining 171 patients was 18 mo. The median survival times of the HER2 positive and negative groups were 17 and 18.5 mo respectively. Overall survival was not significantly different between HER2-positive and negative groups (χ(2) = 0.9157, P = 0.3386), but in patients presenting well-differentiated tumors, the overall survival of the HER2-positive group was significantly worse than that of the HER2-negative group (P = 0.0123). In contrast, patients with poorly differentiated and diffuse/mixed subtype gastric cancers showed no significant differences in overall survival associated with HER2. Furthermore, the median survival time of the HER2 positive group did not show any statistically significant differences when compared to the subgroups of gender, age, tumor location, TNM classification, lymph node metastases and distant metastasis.;Patients with intestinal type gastric cancer (GC), well-differentiated GC and poorly-differentiated GC without lymph node metastasis, may all represent suitable candidates for targeted therapy using Herceptin.",

The goal of the present study was to evaluate the effects of metformin on human gastric cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo and to study microRNAs (miRNA) associated with antitumor effect of metformin. We used MKN1, MKN45, and MKN74 human gastric cancer cell lines to study the effects of metformin on human gastric cancer cells. Athymic nude mice bearing xenograft tumors were treated with or without metformin. Tumor growth was recorded after 4 weeks, and the expression of cell-cycle-related proteins was determined. In addition, we used miRNA array tips to explore the differences among miRNAs in MKN74 cells bearing xenograft tumors treated with or without metformin in vitro and in vivo. Metformin inhibited the proliferation of MKN1, MKN45, and MKN74 in vitro. Metformin blocked the cell cycle in G(0)-G(1)in vitro and in vivo. This blockade was accompanied by a strong decrease of G(1) cyclins, especially in cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) 4, Cdk6 and by a decrease in retinoblastoma protein (Rb) phosphorylation. In addition, metformin reduced the phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor in vitro and in vivo. The miRNA expression was markedly altered with the treatment of metformin in vitro and in vivo. Various miRNAs altered by metformin also may contribute to tumor growth in vitro and in vivo.",

Genome-wide association study (GWAS) is powerful for examining single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their relationships with drug response variations. However, no significant SNP has been identified using GWAS due to multiple testing problems. Therefore, we propose a combination method consisting of knowledge-based algorithm, two stages of screening, and permutation test for identifying SNPs in the present study. We applied this method to a genome-wide pharmacogenomics study for which 109,365 SNPs had been genotyped using Illumina Human-1 BeadChip for 119 gastric cancer patients treated with fluoropyrimidine. We identified rs2293347 in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is as a candidate SNP related to chemotherapeutic response. The p value for the rs2293347 was 2.19 × 10(-5) for Fisher's exact test, and the p value was 0.00360 for the permutation test (multiple testing problems are corrected). Additionally, rs2293347 was clearly superior to clinical parameters and showed a sensitivity value of 55.0% and specificity value of 94.4% in the evaluation by using multiple regression models. Recent studies have shown that combination chemotherapy of fluoropyrimidine and EGFR-targeting agents is effective for gastric cancer patients highly expressing EGFR. These results suggest that rs2293347 is a potential predictive factor for selecting chemotherapies, such as fluoropyrimidine alone or combination chemotherapies.",

Its clinical activity is currently limited by both intrinsic (natural) and acquired drug resistance. A better understanding of the underlying resistance mechanisms is needed to develop novel therapeutic strategies. Exposure of tumor cells to irinotecan or its active metabolite SN-38 is accompanied by EGFR activation, either by stimulation of EGFR autophosphorylation or by Src-mediated phosphorylation. Accordingly, combinations of irinotecan and EGFR inhibitors have been associated with supra-additive activity. We now show that acquired resistance to SN-38 is accompanied by increased expression of EGFR, HER2, HER3 and Src proteins in two colorectal cancer cell models as well as by Src activation. One SN-38 resistant model (HT-29) showed increased sensitivity to erlotinib, an EGFR inhibitor, and afatinib, a dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitor, while the other SN-38 resistant model (HCT-116) showed increased resistance to erlotinib but unchanged or increased sensitivity to afatinib. Unexpectedly, both models showed increased or unaltered resistance to the Src inhibitor dasatinib. Therefore, tyrosine kinase upregulation is not necessarily accompanied by increased sensitivity to targeted agents. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that prolonged exposure to topoisomerase I inhibitors is accompanied by upregulation of different signal transduction pathways which can alter tumor sensitivity to molecular targeted agents. These results suggest that chemotherapy exposure may lead to creation of novel targets which could be exploited therapeutically.",

DSS coamplification was more frequent than RTK coamplification in primGC and LNmets. Moreover, 70 (30%) GC showed a disconcordant RTK and/or DSS gene copy number status between primGC and LNmet, most common was negative conversion for DSS genes (n=40 GC). The presence of RTK amplification in primGC was related to poorer survival in univariate analysis (P=0.04).;This is the first and most comprehensive study in gastric cancer investigating the concordance between gene copy number status of targetable RTKs and downstream signaling oncogenes in primGC and LNmets. Future studies need to establish whether the relative high frequency of RTK and DSS coamplification and/or the relative high rate of negative conversion in LNmet can potentially explain recent failures of RTK targeted therapy in gastric cancer patients.",

However, intrinsic or acquired drug resistance has emerged as a major challenge to their clinical use. In this study, we demonstrated that several receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), including EGFR, HER3 and MET, activations contributed to AZD4547 (a selective FGFR2 inhibitor) hyposensitivity in FGFR2 amplified GC cells. The rescue effect was abrogated by inhibiting these RTKs with their targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). In addition, synergy in growth inhibition was observed when the GC cells were treated with a combination of AZD4547 and cetuximab (an EGFR monoclonal antibody) both in vitro and in vivo. More importantly, tissue microarray analysis revealed that these resistance-conferring RTKs were highly expressed in FGFR2 positive GC patients. Taken together, these observations demonstrated RTKs including EGFR, HER3 and MET activations as novel mechanisms of hyposensitivity to AZD4547. It will be clinically valuable to investigate the involvement of RTK-mediated signaling in intrinsicor acquired resistance to FGFR2 TKIs in GC. A combination targeted therapeutic strategy may be recommended for treating FGFR2 amplified GC patients with these RTK activations. ",

Apart from the successful targeting of HER2 over-expression in gastric cancer (GC) with trastuzumab, other targeted therapies in GC have fallen short or still in early clinical development. While HER2 over-expression accounts for up to 20% of GC, other potential actionable driver mutations occur at a much lower frequency in GC. In this review we describe some of the more interesting genetic aberrations including driver mutations in gastric cancer that have very potent inhibitors against them already in clinical development. Part I of this review will concentrate on the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) gene amplification (HER2, FGFR2, MET, EGFR). Part II will concentrate on gene mutations (HER2, KRAS, PIK3CA, BRAF) and gene rearrangement (ROS1, BRAF, HER2). Because of the low frequency of these potential driver mutations, perseverance in screening for these mutations will be needed in order to enroll enough of each uniquely molecularly defined subset of GC in order to demonstrate significant clinical benefit in a unique molecularly targeted therapy trial. This approach has been successfully employed in the clinical approval of crizotinib for the treatment of ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer. Finally, we discuss a paradigm shift in the personalized treatment of GC patients where multiplex comprehensive screening of all GC patients for all these potential driver mutations simultaneously is performed to achieve efficiencies and timeliness in diagnosis and allowing enrollment into different molecularly targeted therapy trials and the prospective discovery of novel yet unknown actionable driver mutations.

A combination of cell viability assay, immunoblotting, and RNA interference revealed that PS-101 induced EGFR-dependent inhibition selectivity. Further studies showed that PS-101 caused cell cycle arrest at G1 phase, changed cell size, induced apoptosis and led to cell death by increasing the proportion of sub-G1 cells. Molecular mechanism studies suggested that blocking the EGFR-driven antiapoptotic pathway is essential for PS-101-induced apoptosis. The contribution of blocking the EGFR-driven antiapoptotic pathway was verified through examines abundance of likely candidate proteins and RNA interference. The root cause for increase in BAD and decrease in Bcl-2 which altogether initiated caspase-dependent apoptosis were predominantly due to down-regulation the expression of EGFR after PS-101 treatment. PS-101 strongly down-regulated the EGFR expression to trigger proapototic protein BAD increase and antiproapototic protein Bcl-2 decrease, which altogether actived effector caspase-3/9 to initiate cell apoptisis. Taken together, these results suggest that PS-101 may be a potential candidate for cancer therapy against human lung cancer. ",

Benefit was demonstrated for antiangiogenic agents in terms of overall survival (HR 0.759; 95%CI 0.655-0.880; p < 0.001). Conversely no benefit was found for EGFR pathway (HR 1.077; 95%CI 0.847-1.370; p = 0.543). Meta-analysis of HER-2 pathway confirmed improvement in terms of survival outcome, already known for this class of drugs (HR 0.823; 95%CI 0.722-0.939; p = 0.004). Pooled analysis demonstrated a significant survival benefit (OS: HR 0.823; PFS: HR 0.762) with acceptable tolerability profile for targeted-based therapies as compared to conventional treatments. This finding conflicts with the outcome of most individual studies, probably due to poor trial design or patients selection.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether CT texture features of HER2-positive gastric cancer were related to the survival rate after trastuzumab treatment.;Patients diagnosed with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer from February 2007 to August 2014 were retrospectively selected. Using in-house built software, histogram features (kurtosis and skewness) and gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) features (angular second moment [ASM], contrast, entropy, variance, and correlation) were derived from the CT images of HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer in 26 patients. All the patients were followed up for more than 6 months, with no confirmed deaths. The patients were dichotomized into a good and poor survival group based on cutoff points of overall survival of 12 months. A receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was performed to test the ability of each texture parameter to identify the good survival group. Kaplan-Meier curves for patients above and below each threshold were constructed. Using a threshold of >265.8480 for contrast, >488.3150 for variance, and ≤0.1319×10-3. for correlation, all of the area under the ROC curves showed fair accuracy (>0.7). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed statistically significant survival difference between two groups according to optimal cutoff values of contrast, variance, correlation and ASM. However, as this study had a small number of patients, a further study with a larger population will be needed to validate the results.;Heterogeneous texture features on CT images were associated with better survival in patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer who received trastuzumab-based treatment.

In addition to cytomorphological analysis, gene expression of tumor associated genes (Cytokeratin-18, Cytokeratin-19, Cytokeratin-20, Cytokeratin-7, EPCAM, MUC1, HER2, EGFR) and of leukocyte markers (e.g. CD45, CD68) was tested in enriched CTC fractions. CTCs were detected in 59 % of the patients studied (n = 13/22). CTCs were detected in seven patients of the resection group (7/10, 70 %) and six of the non-resectable group (6/12, 50 %). Enrichment of the viable CTCs allowed subsequent successful cultivation in vitro. The cytomorphological characterization of the CTCs was a prerequisite of random gene expression testing in CTC-positive samples. In CTC-positive samples gene expression of cytokeratin 18 and 19 was elevated in comparison to the whole blood gene expression analysis. CTCs were found to be present in both resectable and non-resectable gastric cancer patients. The size-based separation platform for CTCs may be used for in vitro cultivation, as well as in subsequent molecular analysis if desired. The sensitivity of CTC-detection could be enhanced by the combination of cytomorphological and molecular analysis. ",

The aim of the present study was to determine whether PKG II inhibited EGF-induced phosphorylation/activation of EGFR and MAPK/ERK in cell lines derived from different cancer tissues. SW480, HepG2, OS-RC-2, A549, MCF-7 and U251 cells were transfected with adenoviral constructs encoding PKG II cDNA (Ad-PKG II) to upregulate the expression of PKG II, and then treated with 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-pCPT-cGMP) in order to activate the kinase. Western blot analysis was performed to investigate the phosphorylation of EGFR and MAPK/ERK. The results demonstrated that treatment with 100 ng/ml EGF for 5 min increased the tyrosine (Tyr)1068 phosphorylation of EGFR and the threonine 202/Tyr204 phosphorylation of MAPK/ERK. Transfecting the cells with Ad-PKG II, and stimulating the kinases with 8-pCPT-cGMP efficiently inhibited the EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR and MAPK/ERK.

Since Stephen Paget first introduced the \"seed and soil hypothesis\" a century ago, growing evidence recognizes that numerous essential secreted factors and signaling pathway effectors participate in the pre-metastatic niche formation and distant organ metastasis. The cross-talk between GC cells and surrounding microenvironment may consist of a series of interrelated steps, including epithelial mesenchymal transition, intravasation into blood vessels, circulating tumor cell translocation, and secondary organ metastasis. Secreted factors including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinases and cancer-derived extracellular vesicles, especially exosomes, are essential in formation of premetastatic niche. Circulating tumor cells and microRNAs represent as ''metastatic intermediates'' between primary tumors and sites of dissemination. Many biomarkers have been identified as novel metastatic markers and prognostic effectors. In addition, molecular therapy has been designed to target biomarkers such as growth factors (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, VEGF) and chemokines, although they have not clearly proven to be effective in inhibiting GC metastasis in clinical trials. In this review, we will systematically discuss the emerging molecules and their microenvironment in hematogenous metastasis of GC, which may help us to find new therapeutic strategies in the future.

Many relatively healthy patients after second-line therapy have limited and generally ineffective options. The recent The Cancer Genome Atlas analysis has uncovered four genotypes of GC; however, it is not sufficient to change our treatment strategies and more work needs to be done. The popular front-line regimen containing a platinum compound and a fluoropyrimidine is widely used for drug development and has worked well globally. Thus, this combination appears suitable for adding a biologic agent. The search for new classes of cytotoxics has almost stopped, but it is clear that cytotoxic therapy continues to contribute and it is here to stay. Biologic agents that modulate the immune system of the host appear promising along with many other biologics that can potentially inhibit signaling pathways that are often employed by GC cells. We will briefly describe the efforts that have targeted EGFR, mTOR, angiogenesis and MET pathways. ",

Helicobacter pylori infection, dietary factors, lifestyle influences and various genetic aberrations have been shown to contribute to the development and progression of gastric cancer. Recent studies on the genomic landscape of gastric adenocarcinoma have identified several key signaling molecules, including epidermal growth factor receptor family (ErbB) members, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor family (VEGFR) members and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway components, that have been implicated in the molecular pathogenesis of gastric cancers. However, clinical trials with compounds that target these molecules have failed to show a significant improvement in overall survival rates when supplemented with conventional therapies. Therefore, it is essential to identify effective prognostic and/or diagnostic biomarkers and develop molecular targeted therapies. The JAK/STAT cascade is a principal signal transduction pathway in cytokine and growth factor signaling, regulating various cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and survival. Numerous in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that dysregulated JAK/STAT signaling is a driving force in the pathogenesis of various solid cancers as well as hematopoietic malignancies. Hence, a large number of preclinical and clinical studies of drugs targeting this pathway are currently underway. Notably, aberrant JAK/STAT signaling has also been implicated in gastric cancers. In this review, we focus on the ongoing research on the JAK/STAT cascade in gastric carcinoma and discuss the therapeutic potential of targeting JAK/STAT signaling for the treatment of gastric cancer.",

The subjects comprised 37 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma who underwent tissue biopsy or surgical resection of the primary sites and 49 paired synchronous or metachronous metastatic sites (excluding lymph nodes) at the Fukuoka University Hospital between January, 1998 and September, 2012. All the samples were evaluated for HER2 status at the invasive front by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The HER2 positivity rate of the primary sites was ~16% and the concordance ratio of the IHC results between primary and paired metastatic sites was ~97%. No discordant cases regarding HER2 status were found among metachronous interventions for metastatic lesions. Only one patient exhibited conversion from a HER2-negative status in all the portions of the primary site to a positive status in a metastatic site. In conclusion, a high concordance ratio for HER2 status was observed between primary and paired metastatic lesions.

The aim of this study was to explore risk factors that predict the presence of LNM in early gastric cancer (EGC). A total of 230 patients with EGC who underwent curative gastrectomy with lymph adenectomy at Xinhua Hospital from January 2006 to July 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. We studied the relationship between clinicopathological factors, biological markers (p53, ki67, nm23, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), E-cadherin (E-cad), beta-catenin (b-catenin), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and topoisomerase II (Topo II)), and LNM of EGC patients by chi-square test and logistic regression analysis. Meta-analyses were further conducted to review the effects of the proteins (P53, ki67, E-cad, and b-catenin) on LNM in ECG patients. LNM was detected in 42 (18.3 %) of 230 patients. Incidences of LNM was distinct in different tumor size (p = 0.044), depth of submucosal invasion (p < 0.0001), and P53 overexpression (p = 0.004). Multivariate analysis further indentified that large tumor size (≥20 mm, odds ratio (OR) = 2.168, p = 0.041), submucosa (OR = 4.000, p = 0.0005), and P53 overexpression (OR = 3.010, p = 0.022) were independent risk factors of LNM in EGC patients. The meta-analysis revealed a significantly statistical association of P53, ki67, and b-catenin with an increased risk of LNM in EGC patients (P53, OR = 1.81, p = 0.017; ki67, OR = 2.53, p = 0.0003; b-catenin, OR = 0.53, p = 0.01). Tumor size (≥20 mm), the depth of invasion (submucosa), and P53 overexpression may be helpful predictors of LNM in EGC patients. Furthermore, the results of meta-analysis revealed that P53, ki67 overexpression, and abnormal expression of b-catenin may be associated with LNM in EGC.

The clinico-pathological features that are presently used to assess patient prognosis are not sufficient to define gastric tumor behavior. Therefore, an accurate analysis of different biological characteristics of gastric cancer cells could allow the course of disease to be predicted and may help to improve treatment strategies.;The prognostic values of DNA ploidy, proliferative activity and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) expression were studied in gastric tumors from a series of 63 patients. DNA ploidy and proliferative activity, evaluated in terms of DNA index (DI) and proliferative index (PI), respectively, were determined by flow cytometry on paraffin-embedded tumor tissues. EGF-R expression was detected by immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded tumor sections of the same specimens. The clinico-pathological and the biological parameters were then correlated, and the patients overall survival was calculated using a chi-square test and the Kaplan-Meier method.;DNA ploidy abnormal cell clones were found in 44% of cases (median DI = 1.4, range 1.04-2.5). Aneuploid tumors showed high PI more frequently than diploids (71% versus 36%, p = 0.01). The analysis of the expression of EGF-R revealed that 88% of aneuploid tumors were positive for receptor expression. On the contrary, diploid tumors showed the presence of EGF-R only in 56% of cases (p = 0.01). DI, PI, and EGF-R expression were not related to histological grade. Conversely, the three biological parameters were significantly correlated to clinical stage and tumor invasion. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed a 73% 5-year survival rate in patients with diploid tumors whereas only 33% of patients with aneuploid lesions had a good prognosis (p = 0.001).;We demonstrate that DNA ploidy, PI, and EGF-R expression are closely related to some pathological and clinical characteristics in gastric cancer. The close relationship between aneuploidy, EGF-R positive expression, node involvement, and tumor invasion suggests that these parameters may be indicators of high malignancy. Finally, the results also show that aneuploidy and EGF-R-positive expression are indicative of a worse prognosis in gastric cancer patients. The study of these parameters might allow a more accurate stratification of patients, so that a targeted therapeutic protocol may be defined.",

Addition of a chimeric monoclonal antibody against EGFR (cetuximab) to first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal tumours improved outcomes of patients (stratified for KRAS wild-type cancers), whereas GC patients did not benefit from this approach. In GC, however, stratification based on KRAS mutations was not performed, and the 30 % KRAS mutation frequency in microsatellite instable cancers (MSI), which represents ∼4 % of total GC, was disregarded. Further, intratumoural heterogeneity regarding KRAS mutant subpopulations might also contribute to anti-EGFR therapy failure. We assessed the mutational status of the entire KRAS coding sequence in 19 MSI-GC cases by multiplex PCR/sequencing and used peak height ratio determined from electropherograms from KRAS heterozygous mutants and histopathological evaluation to infer tumour heterogeneity in GC. Using 2 multiplex reactions per sample, we found that 26 % (5/19) of MSI-GC cases harboured KRAS mutations (2 G12D, 2 G13D, 1 G12V). No mutations were found outside the codon 12 and 13 hotspots. Our analysis supported the co-existence of KRAS-positive and KRAS-negative tumour populations in 4/5 MSI-GC cases. In conclusion, the method developed stands as a cost-effective and practical way for mutation screening of the entire KRAS coding sequence. KRAS mutations are frequent in our series of MSI cases and are often found in a subpopulation of the tumour and not in the whole tumour.

Immunohistochemical staining for the aforementioned molecules was performed for the surgically resected specimens of the 210 cases to investigate the correlation between clinicopathological factors and expression of each molecule.;No significant correlation was observed between the immunostaining expression of any of the eight factors and postoperative recurrence.

The number of analyzed cases was therefore limited, since patients that had received preoperative radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or HER2-targeted therapy were excluded. From a large number of considered patients, only 29 could be included for HER2 analysis. Intracellular mutations were not analyzed since they are assumed to have no or minor effect on the extracellular binding of molecules that deliver radionuclides.

To develop effective therapeutic treatments, a dual-targeting hybrid nanoparticle (NP) system was designed and constructed to deliver the SN38 agent specifically to human solid gastric tumors bearing excessive Her2 and CD44. The hybrid NPs consist of a particle core made of the biodegradable polymer PLGA and a lipoid shell prepared by conjugating the AHNP peptides and n-hexadecylamine (HDA) to the carboxyl groups of hyaluronic acid (HA). Upon encapsulation of the SN38 agent in the NPs, the AHNP peptides and HA on the NP surface allow preferential delivery of the drug to gastric cancer cells (e.g., HGC27 cells) by targeting Her2 and CD44. Cellular uptake and in vivo biodistribution experiments verified the active targeting and prolonged in vivo circulation properties of the dual-targeting hybrid NPs, leading to enhanced accumulation of the drug in tumors. Furthermore, the anti-proliferation mechanism studies revealed that the inhibition of the growth and invasive activity of HGC27 cells was not only attributed to the enhanced cellular uptake of dual-targeting NPs, but also benefited from the suppression of CD44 and Her2 expression by HA and AHNP moieties. Finally, intravenous administration of the SN38-loaded dual-targeting hybrid NPs induced significant growth inhibition of HGC27 tumor xenografted in nude mice compared with a clinical antitumor agent, Irinotecan (CPT-11), and the other NP formulations. These results demonstrate that the designed dual-targeting hybrid NPs are promising for targeted anti-cancer drug delivery to treat human gastric tumors over-expressing Her2 and CD44. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"We have reviewed the pivotal presentations rcelated to colorectal cancer (CRC) and other gastrointestinal malignancies from 2008 annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). We have discussed the scientific findings and the impact on practice guidelines and ongoing clinical trials. The report on KRAS status in patients with metastatic CRC receiving epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeted antibody treatment has led to a change in National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline that recommends only patients with wild-type KRAS tumor should receive this treatment. The results of double biologics (bevacizumab and anti-EGFR antibody) plus chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with metastatic CRC has shown a worse outcome than bevacizumab-based regimen. Microsatellite Instability has again been confirmed to be an important predictor in patients with stage II colon cancer receiving adjuvant treatment. Adjuvant gemcitabine therapy for pancreatic cancer was investigated by the CONKO-001 study; this resulted in superior survival as compared with observation and can be regarded as an acceptable option, without the addition of radiotherapy. The addition of bevacizumab to gemcitabine and erlotinib was not supior to gemcitabine and erlotinib for advanced disease. Second-line therapy for advanced pancreatic cancer with 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin resulted in a survival benefit. Irinotecan plus cisplatin and paclitaxel plus cisplatin result in similar survival when combined with radiotherapy for esophageal cancer. The novel fluoropyrimidine S1 appears to be active in gastric cancer, as a single agent or as combination therapy. Adjuvant intraperitoneal mitomycin-C may decrease the incidence of peritoneal recurrence of gastric cancer. Sorafenib is an effective agent in Asian patients with hepatocellular carcinoma secondary to hepatitis B; its utility in child's B cirrhosis remains to be proven. Sunitinib is also an active agent in hepatocellular carcinoma, and may represent an alterative to sorafenib for advanced disease. These and other important presentations from the 2008 ASCO annual meeting are discussed in this article.",

The introduction of new antitarget drugs has introduced a new perspective in cancer treatment in general and gastric cancer in particular. Nevertheless, few studies have been developed with this generation of drugs. The monoclonal antibody antiepidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) cetuximab and the antiangiogenic bevacizumab have been used in phase I and II studies with good results, which need to be confirmed in new phase III studies. The carcinogenesis of this tumor provides information regarding two transcription and signaling pathways of great interest and with therapeutic potential. Infection by Helicobacter pylori is recognized as the cause of gastric cancer development, and there are two elements that play an important role in this process: the CagA gene, whose protein is introduced in the cell by H. pylori initiates the process; and the hedgehog signaling pathway, which regulates the gastric mucosa and is very frequently activated in gastric cancer. Taking action on these agents may be a new and effective method of treating gastric cancer, and therefore must be researched.",

A total of 251 gastric cancer (GC) patients were divided into a cohort using 1 tumor tissue paraffin block (single-block group, n = 132) and a cohort using dual tumor tissue paraffin blocks (dual-block group, n = 119) when evaluating Her2/neu expression status by IHC. In dual-block group, we combined the results from 2 different paraffin blocks and used the higher one as the final score. The number of IHC 1+, 2+, and 3+ specimens in the single-block group was 31 (23.5%), 40 (30.3%), and 19 (14.4%), respectively. The combined final IHC score in the dual-block group of 1+, 2+, and 3+ was 26 (21.8%), 34 (28.6%), and 23 (19.3%), respectively. Inconsistent Her2/neu expression between blocks was found in 36 (30.3%) cases in the dual-block group. The pooled data in the single-block group and the dual-block group indicated that, when using dual blocks, the Her2/neu-positive (3+) rate of GC was higher compared to that in the single-block group. Our results implied that using dual paraffin blocks to assess Her2/neu expression of GC may help identify more patients with Her2/neu-positive GC who could benefit from targeted therapy, by reducing false-negative rate of Her2 status assessment.

The receptor tyrosine kinase MET is constitutively activated in many gastric cancers and its expression is strictly required for survival of some gastric cancer cells. Thus, MET is considered a good candidate for targeted therapeutic intervention in this type of tumor, and MET inhibitors recently entered clinical trials. One of the major problems of therapies targeting tyrosine kinases is that many tumors are not responsive to treatment or eventually develop resistance to the drugs. Perspective studies are thus mandatory to identify the molecular mechanisms that could cause resistance to these therapies.;Our in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that, in MET-addicted gastric cancer cells, the activation of HER (Human Epidermal Receptor) family members induces resistance to MET silencing or inhibition by PHA-665752 (a selective kinase inhibitor). We provide molecular evidences highlighting the role of EGFR, HER3, and downstream signaling pathways common to MET and HER family in resistance to MET inhibitors. Moreover, we show that an in vitro generated gastric cancer cell line resistant to MET-inhibition displays overexpression of HER family members, whose activation contributes to maintenance of resistance.;Our findings predict that gastric cancer tumors bearing constitutive activation of HER family members are poorly responsive to MET inhibition, even if this receptor is constitutively active. Moreover, the appearance of these alterations might also be responsible for the onset of resistance in initially responsive tumors.",

However to date, only a few patient-derived gastric cancer xenograft (PDGCX) models have been reported. In this study, we aimed to establish additional PDGCX models and to evaluate whether these models accurately reflected the histological and genetic diversities of the corresponding patient tumors. By engrafting fresh patient gastric cancer (GC) tissues into immune-compromised mice (SCID and/or nude mice), thirty two PDGCX models were established. Histological features were assessed by a qualified pathologist based on H&E staining. Genomic comparison was performed for several biomarkers including ERBB1, ERBB2, ERBB3, FGFR2, MET and PTEN. These biomarkers were profiled to assess gene copy number by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC). All 32 PDGCX models retained the histological features of the corresponding human tumors. Furthermore, among the 32 models, 78% (25/32) highly expressed ERBB1 (EGFR), 22% (7/32) were ERBB2 (HER2) positive, 78% (25/32) showed ERBB3 (HER3) high expression, 66% (21/32) lost PTEN expression, 3% (1/32) harbored FGFR2 amplification, 41% (13/32) were positive for MET expression and 16% (5/32) were MET gene amplified. Between the PDGCX models and their parental tumors, a high degree of similarity was observed for FGFR2 and MET gene amplification, and also for ERBB2 status (agreement rate = 94~100%; kappa value = 0.81~1). Protein expression of PTEN and MET also showed moderate agreement (agreement rate = 78%; kappa value = 0.46~0.56), while ERBB1 and ERBB3 expression showed slight agreement (agreement rate = 59~75%; kappa value = 0.18~0.19). ERBB2 positivity, FGFR2 or MET gene amplification was all maintained until passage 12 in mice. The stability of the molecular profiles observed across subsequent passages within the individual models provides confidence in the utility and translational significance of these models for in vivo testing of personalized therapies.

The incidence of oesophageal and oesophagogastric junctional tumours is increasing, making these important disease entities to understand and research. Despite improvements in surgical and peri-operative supportive care, 3-year overall survival with surgery alone for resectable disease is still poor. Outcomes in localised oesophageal cancer are improved with pre-operative chemotherapy, and in gastric cancer with peri-operative treatment or post-operative chemoradiotherapy. Oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma can be treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy as an alternative to surgery. While survival in patients presenting with metastatic disease is improved with the addition of systemic chemotherapy, median survival remains <1 year. Patients who are otherwise fit can be offered chemotherapy and this is superior to best supportive care. Regimens including a platinum and an anthracycline agent are favoured by the results of randomised trials. No standard second-line therapy has emerged. New research into taxanes has shown promising anti-cancer activity, and novel areas of investigation include incorporation of agents targeting vascular endothelial growth factor or epidermal growth factor receptor into standard regimens.

Firstly, miRNAs microarray and bioinformatics methods were used to characterize differential expressed miRNAs from primary tumor samples. Following, we used a ROC method to select signature with best sensitivity and specificity. Finally, we validated the signature in GC samples (frozen fresh and blood samples) using quantitative PCR.;We have identified 12 differential miRNAs including 7 up-regulated and 5 down-regulated miRNAs in recurrence group. Using ROC method, we further ascertained hsa-miR-335 as a signature to recognize recurrence and non-recurrence cases in the training samples.

With regard to this testing, overexpression of the HER2 protein seems to possess the best predictive properties. However, HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) is subject to assay and interobserver variability, so standardization and internal and external proficiency testing is an absolute prerequisite, especially as the IHC scoring system in gastric cancer is different from that of breast cancer.

Understanding of the molecular pathways that characterize cell growth, cell cycle, apoptosis, angiogenesis and invasion has provided novel targets in cancer therapy. In this review we describe the current status of targeted therapies in the treatment of EC and GC, including EGFR inhibitors, antiangiogenic agents, cell cycle inhibitors, apoptosis promoters and matrix metalloproteinases inhibitors. The emerging data from the clinical development of these compounds has provided novel opportunities in the treatment of EC and GC that will probably translate into clinical benefit for patients with these common malignancies.",

A total of 94 patients were enrolled in the present study, each of whom underwent a D2 radical surgery in Zhongshan Hospital affiliated with Fudan University (Shanghai, China) between 2000 and 2005. The expression of FAS and HER2 was assessed by immunohistochemistry analysis of tissue microarrays generated from GC and non-tumor tissues. All data were analyzed by GraphPad Prism 5.0 to investigate the association between FAS and HER2 and to detect the potential association with prognosis. FAS (P<0.0001) and membranous HER2 (mHER2; P=0.0021) were overexpressed in the GC tissues, and a bidirectional and strong correlation was demonstrated between FAS and mHER2 in the tumor tissues. The expression of cytoplasmic HER2 (cHER2) was significantly lower in the GC tissues compared with the non-tumor tissues (P=0.0005), and cHER2 was expressed at a higher level in tumors that had better differentiation compared with poorly-differentiated tissues (P=0.0503). Patients with a concordant expression pattern of FAS and mHER2 showed a significantly poorer prognosis than the non-concordant group (P=0.0096; hazards ratio, 3.2801; 95% confidence interval, 1.5781-6.8176).

The patients' age, sex, tumor location, depth of invasion, pathological type, lymph node metastasis, and pathological stage were determined by a review of the medical records. Expression of HER2 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using the HercepTest(TM) kit. Standard criteria for HER2 positivity (0, 1+, 2+, and 3+) were used. Tumors that scored 3+ were considered HER2-positive. Expression of phospho Akt (pAkt) was also analyzed by IHC. Tumors were considered pAkt-positive when the percentage of positive tumor cells was 10% or more. PI3K, catalytic, alpha polypeptide (PIK3CA) mutations in exons 1, 9 and 20 were analyzed by pyrosequencing. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection was analyzed by in situ hybridization targeting EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER) with an EBER-RNA probe. Microsatellite instability (MSI) was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction using the mononucleotide markers BAT25 and BAT26.;HER2 expression levels of 0, 1+, 2+ and 3+ were found in 167 (72%), 32 (14%), 12 (5%) and 20 (8.7%) samples, respectively. HER2 overexpression (IHC 3+) significantly correlated with intestinal histological type (15/20 vs 98 /205, P = 0.05). PIK3CA mutations were present in 20 cases (8.7%) and significantly correlated with MSI (10/20 vs 9/211, P < 0.01). The mutation frequency was high (21%) in T4 cancers and very low (6%) in T2 cancers. Mutations in exons 1, 9 and 20 were detected in 5 (2%), 9 (4%) and 7 (3%) cases, respectively. Two new types of PIK3CA mutation, R88Q and R108H, were found in exon1. All PIK3CA mutations were heterozygous missense single-base substitutions, the most common being H1047R (6/20, 30%) in exon20. Eighteen cancers (8%) were EBV-positive and this positivity significantly correlated with a diffuse histological type (13/18 vs 93/198, P = 0.04). There were 7 cases of lymphoepithelioma-like carcinomas (LELC) and 6 of those cases were EBV-positive (percent/EBV: 6/18, 33%; percent/all LELC: 6/7, 86%). pAkt expression was positive in 119 (53%) cases but showed no correlation with clinicopathological characteristics. pAkt expression was significantly correlated with HER2 overexpression (16/20 vs 103/211, P < 0.01) but not with PIK3CA mutations (12/20 vs 107/211, P = 0.37) or EBV infection (8/18 vs 103/211, P = 0.69). The frequency of pAkt expression was higher in cancers with exon20 mutations (100%) than in those with exon1 (40%) or exon9 (56%) mutations. One case showed both HER2 overexpression and EBV infection and 3 cases showed both PIK3CA mutations and EBV infection. However, no cases showed both PIK3CA mutations and HER2 overexpression. One EBV-positive cancer with PIK3CA mutation (H1047R) was MSI-positive. Three of these 4 cases were positive for pAkt expression. In survival analysis, pAkt expression significantly correlated with a poor prognosis (hazard ratio 1.75; 95%CI: 1.12-2.80, P = 0.02).;HER2 expression, PIK3CA mutations and EBV infection in gastric cancer were characterized. pAkt expression significantly correlates with HER2 expression and with a poor prognosis.",

The HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands (EGF family) are known to play a significant role in gastrointestinal cancer. In particular, the EGF receptor, HER1, is one of the main candidates for the molecular-targeted therapy of colon cancer, and HER2 is a candidate for the treatment of gastric cancer which overexpresses HER2. In contrast, the role of the HER and EGF families in malignant lymphoma has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of the HER and EGF families in lymphoma cell lines and tumor samples. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed that the ligands for HER1 were mainly expressed in gastric cancer and colon cancer cell lines, but not in lymphoma cell lines. On the other hand, the EGF family member, neuregulin (NRG) 4, was highly expressed in lymphoma cell lines. Immunohistochemical analyses of malignant lymphoma clinical samples revealed that NRG4 and HER4 were mainly expressed in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and follicular lymphoma. Immunoprecipitation of Raji and Daudi cell lines revealed that recombinant NRG4 induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of HER4. Additionally, recombinant NRG4 activated the proliferation of lymphoma cell lines.

We selected from a DNA library an aptamer specifically recognizing human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ErbB-2/HER2), a receptor tyrosine kinase, which is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers, including breast and gastric tumors. Treatment of human gastric cancer cells with a trimeric version (42 nucleotides) of the selected aptamer (14 nucleotides) resulted in reduced cell growth in vitro, but a monomeric version was ineffective. Likewise, when treated with the trimeric aptamer, animals bearing tumor xenografts of human gastric origin reflected reduced rates of tumor growth. The antitumor effect of the aptamer was nearly twofold stronger than that of a monoclonal anti-ErbB-2/HER2 antibody. Consistent with aptamer-induced intracellular degradation of ErbB-2/HER2, incubation of gastric cancer cells with the trimeric aptamer promoted translocation of ErbB-2/HER2 from the cell surface to cytoplasmic puncta. This translocation was associated with a lysosomal hydrolase-dependent clearance of the ErbB-2/HER2 protein from cell extracts. We conclude that targeting ErbB-2/HER2 with DNA aptamers might retard the tumorigenic growth of gastric cancer by means of accelerating lysosomal degradation of the oncoprotein. This work exemplifies the potential pharmacological utility of aptamers directed at cell surface proteins, and it highlights an endocytosis-mediated mechanism of tumor inhibition.",

Perioperative combination chemotherapy based on cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) improves the prognosis of patients with stage II and stage III disease. Preoperative initiation of chemotherapy seems to be essential for achieving this result, according to studies performed in the West. On the other hand, Japanese investigators demonstrated that postoperative administration of oral fluoropyrimidine prodrugs can substantially improve the prognosis of patients with curatively resected gastric cancer. The addition of docetaxel to cisplatin and 5-FU has significantly improved response rate, time to progression, and overall survival in patients treated for advanced gastric cancer, as well as prolonging time to definitive worsening of global health status and Karnofsky performance status. Due to increased hematologic toxicity with this regimen, particularly neutropenic infections, careful patient selection and optimal supportive care, including prophylactic granulocyte colonystimulating factor, are required. Alternative schedules are being investigated that could improve the tolerability of docetaxel plus platinum/fluoropyrimidine combination regimens. Further improvements in outcome may be achieved when even more active chemotherapy combinations including docetaxel are systematically implemented into the preoperative treatment of locally advanced gastroesophageal cancers. Initial results with biologic targeted agents in this setting are promising. Pathways currently under investigation include the epidermal growth factor receptors Her-1 and Her-2, vascular endothelial growth factor, and the epithelial cell adhesion molecule EpCAM. It is hoped that targeting these pathways will further increase the efficacy of biochemotherapy of gastroesophageal cancer. Evaluating early response to biochemotherapy using metabolic imaging is a novel approach that may allow for tailoring systemic therapy to individual tumor biology. A deeper understanding of the relevant pathognomonic molecular patterns and signatures in individual tumors may facilitate faster drug development and permit more accurate selection of active therapies in the future.",

Hoechst staining and TUNEL method were used to demonstrate apoptosis. Flow cytometry was used to determine cell cycle and ratio of apoptosis. Caspase activity assay was used to examine the activation of caspase cascade pathways. Western blotting was used to explore the protein levels. Consistently, trifolirhizin inhibited MKN45 xenograft tumor growth in vivo. Trifolirhizin caused a significantly decreased proliferation of MKN45 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 33.27±2.06 µg/ml at 48 h. Western blot assay manifested that trifolirhizin activated the EGFR-MAPK signaling pathways.

To select patients for treatment, HER2 status is evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization. Gastric and GEJ adenocarcinomas demonstrate heterogeneity in HER2 expression. Nonetheless, testing is often performed on biopsies alone, which raises the issue of nonrepresentative sampling. We investigated the correlation of HER2 status between matched biopsy and resection specimens and the role of tumor heterogeneity in contributing to discrepancy. A total of 128 patients with gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma had tissue available from a biopsy and subsequent resection. HER2 IHC was performed and evaluated by the criteria used in the Trastuzumab for Gastric Cancer clinical trial. In situ hybridization was performed if IHC was equivocal (2+) in either the biopsy or resection and in discrepant cases. Tumor heterogeneity was defined as 3+ or 2+ staining in 10% to 60% of tumor cells. Overall, HER2 was overexpressed in 18 tumors (14%), with a biopsy-resection concordance of 96.1%. Five cases were discrepant; 2 were positive on biopsy only, and 3 were positive on resection only. Tumor heterogeneity was seen in 80% of discrepant biopsies and resections, compared with 24% of concordant cases (P = .016). Our study demonstrates strong concordance between biopsy and resection specimens for HER2 overexpression in gastric cancer. Discordance was correlated with tumor heterogeneity. Overall, both biopsy and resection specimens are appropriate for HER2 testing, but generous sampling for biopsy specimens is necessary to ensure accurate assessment. ",

Knowledge of how these markers are segmented in the same cohort of GC patients could improve future clinical trial designs.;Using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and FISH methods, overexpression and amplification of HER2, FGFR2 and MET were profiled in a cohort of Chinese GC samples. The correlations between anti-tumour sensitivity and the molecular segments of HER2, MET and FGFR2 alterations were further tested in a panel of GC cell lines and the patient-derived GC xenograft (PDGCX) model using the targeted inhibitors.;Of 172 GC patients, positivity for HER2, MET and FGFR2 alternations was found in 23 (13.4%), 21 (12.2%) and 9 (5.2%) patients, respectively. Positivity for MET was found in 3 of 23 HER2-positive GC patients. Co-positivity for FGFR2 and MET was found in 1 GC patient, and amplification of the two genes was found in different tumour cells.

For those patients in whom surgical resection is not possible, other therapeutic approaches are necessary. Disordered apoptosis has been linked to cancer development and treatment resistance. Apoptosis occurs via extrinsic or intrinsic signaling each triggered and regulated by many different molecular pathways. In recent years, the selective induction of apoptosis in tumor cells has been increasingly recognized as a promising approach for cancer therapy. A detailed understanding of the molecular pathways involved in the regulation of apoptosis is essential for developing novel effective therapeutic approaches. Apoptosis can be induced by many different approaches including activating cell surface death receptors (for example, Fas, TRAIL and TNF receptors), inhibiting cell survival signaling (such as EGFR, MAPK and PI3K), altering apoptosis threshold by modulating pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, down-regulating anti-apoptosis proteins (such as XIAP, survivin and c-IAP2), and using other pro-apoptotic agents.

High-throughput mutation profile has shown that lung cancer frequently harbors comutation of cancer-related genes. Therefore, given that cancer cells have multiple genetic alterations, combinatorial therapeutic strategy is demanded for effective cancer therapy. To address this, we first characterized MEK dependence in four NSCLC cells. Two cells (H358, A549) carried KRAS mutation only, and the other two (H23, H157) harbored comutation of KRAS/PTEN. H358 cells with KRAS mutation only were sensitive to MEK inhibition. However, the other KRAS mutant A549 cells were resistant to MEK inhibition. Previously, we have shown that dual inhibition of EGFR and MEK signaling shows a synergistic effect on KRAS mutant gastric cancer cells by suppressing compensatory activation of AKT. Here we also observed that this combination was effective in KRAS mutant A549 cells. However, the combination was ineffective in H23 and 157 cells with comutation of KRAS/PTEN. Compared to KRAS mutant/PTEN wild-type cells, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was significantly activated following MEK inhibition in KRAS/PTEN comutant cells. Combined STAT3 inhibition by a JAK2 inhibitor or gene knockdown with MEK inhibition blocked STAT3 activation, synergistically suppressed cell growth, and induced apoptosis in comutant cells. Taken together, our study provides molecular insights that help explain the heterogeneous response to MEK inhibition in KRAS mutant lung cancers, and presents a rationale for the clinical investigation of combination of MEK and EGFR inhibitor or MEK and JAK2 inhibitor depending on PTEN status.",

The peptide hormone, gastrin, stimulates acid secretion but also induces proliferation of the acid-secreting mucosa. Because the relationship between these peptides of overlapping function is not understood, we chose to investigate the regulatory effect of gastrin on TFF2 expression. The expression of mRNA and protein of TFF2 was determined by RT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining, respectively. A series of truncated and mutant murine TFF2 promoter constructs was generated. Promoter activity was assessed using dual luciferase reporter assays. Gastrin-responsive DNA-binding sites in the TFF2 promoter were evaluated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Gastrin significantly increased the level of endogenous mRNA of TFF2 in the gastrin receptor-expressing AGS-E gastric cancer cell line in a time- and dose-dependent manner. TFF2 protein expression in the gastric fundus was elevated in hypergastrinemic (INS-GAS) transgenic mice and reduced in gastrin-deficient mice. Gastrin treatment increased TFF2 promoter activity through cis-acting regions, containing CCAATA- and GC-rich enhancers. Pretreatment with Y-F476, a gastrin/CCK(B) receptor antagonist, abolished gastrin-dependent promoter activity. Inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC), mitogen/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK1), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) reduced gastrin-dependent TFF2 promoter activity, whereas an epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor had no effect. We found that gastrin regulates TFF2 transcription through a GC-rich DNA-binding site and a PKC-, MEK1- and PI 3-kinase-dependent but EGFR-independent pathway.

Interestingly, CH5164840 demonstrated tumor selectivity both in vitro and in vivo, binding to tumor Hsp90 (which forms active multiple chaperone complexes) in vitro, and being distributed effectively to tumors in a mouse model, which, taken together, supports the decreased levels of phosphorylated Akt by CH5164840 that we observed in tumor tissues, but not in normal tissues.

The effects of 8-Cl-cAMP on human gastric carcinoma cell lines were studied. Twenty microM 8-Cl-cAMP clearly inhibited cell growth in six cell lines (TMK-1, KATO-III, MKN-7, -28, -45, and -74) but not in MKN-1. Cell population in the G1 phase was increased in KATO III cells, which were more responsive to 8-Cl-cAMP, while cell cycle progression in TMK-1 and MKN-1 cells was apparently not influenced by 8-Cl-cAMP. The various changes induced by 8-Cl-cAMP were further analyzed in TMK-1 cells. Decrease of type I regulatory subunit (RI) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and translocation of RII from cytosol to nucleus were induced by 8-Cl-cAMP treatment. 8-Cl-cAMP increased the level of cAMP-response element (CRE) binding protein in addition to inducing FOS mRNA, whose promoter contains CRE. 8-Cl-cAMP decreased the expression of mRNA for transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), while the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor was not changed. Expression of HRAS and MYC mRNAs was slightly increased, whereas the amounts of HRAS and MYC proteins remained unchanged. Our results overall suggest that 8-Cl-cAMP might be a useful tool for antitumor therapy of gastric cancers and that cell growth inhibition by 8-Cl-cAMP might account for the decrease of TGF-alpha expression by tumor cells.",

Recurrence is believed to be caused by the increase in micrometases, which were not eradicated by preoperative or postoperative chemotherapy. Therefore, a new therapeutic strategy that can improve treatment efficacy is mandatory for advanced breast cancer. S-1 was shown to be effective and safe in Japanese metastatic breast cancer patients treated with previous chemotherapy, including anthracyclines. Thus, in this study, we evaluated S-1 as adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients after standard primary systemic chemotherapy.;The treatment consisted of 18 courses (a 2-week administration and a 1-week withdrawal; one year) administered at 80-120 mg/body/day. In cases judged to require postoperative radiotherapy, it was concurrently initiated on Day 1 of the study. If the estrogen receptor and/or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 were positive, endocrine therapy and/or trastuzumab were permitted, concurrently.;Of the 45 patients enrolled between September 2007 and September 2009 from 3 institutions, 43 patients were eligible. Thirty-two of the 43 (74.4%) patients received concurrent radiotherapy. Twenty-two of the 43 (51.2%) patients completed the scheduled courses of chemotherapy. The most common reasons for withdrawal of treatment were subjective symptoms, such as nausea, anorexia, or general fatigue during the first 9 courses of treatment in 9/43 (20.9%) patients, recurrence in 7/43 (16.3%) patients, and adverse events in 5/43 (11.6%) patients. The cumulative percentage of administration for 365 days was 66.4% (95% confidence interval: 50.8-79.1%). Although grade 3 neutropenia (9.3%), leukopenia (4.7%), and diarrhea (4.7%) were observed, they were manageable. No grade 4 adverse effects were observed.;The percentage of Japanese breast cancer patients completing the 18-course treatment and the cumulative percentage of administration for 365 days using S-1 after standard primary systemic chemotherapy were similar with the results of another study of adjuvant chemotherapy for the Japanese gastric cancer patients with no severe adverse effects. A phase III trial investigating the usefulness of adjuvant S-1 is now ongoing in Japan, and it is expected that S-1 will have a significant survival benefit in breast cancer patients.

Under physiologic levels of expression, HER2 heterodimerizes with other members of the EGF receptor/HER/ErbB family, and the HER2-HER3 dimer forms one of the most potent oncogenic receptor pairs. Previous structural biology studies have individually crystallized the kinase domains of HER2 and HER3, but the HER2-HER3 kinase domain heterodimer structure has yet to be solved. Using a reconstituted membrane system to form HER2-HER3 kinase domain heterodimers and carboxyl group footprinting mass spectrometry, we observed that HER2 and HER3 kinase domains preferentially form asymmetric heterodimers with HER3 and HER2 monomers occupying the donor and acceptor kinase positions, respectively. Conformational changes in the HER2 activation loop, as measured by changes in carboxyl group labeling, required both dimerization and nucleotide binding but did not require activation loop phosphorylation at Tyr-877. Molecular dynamics simulations on HER2-HER3 kinase dimers identify specific inter- and intramolecular interactions and were in good agreement with MS measurements. Specifically, several intermolecular ionic interactions between HER2 Lys-716-HER3 Glu-909, HER2 Glu-717-HER3 Lys-907, and HER2 Asp-871-HER3 Arg-948 were identified by molecular dynamics. We also evaluated the effect of the cancer-associated mutations HER2 D769H/D769Y, HER3 E909G, and HER3 R948K (also numbered HER3 E928G and R967K) on kinase activity in the context of this new structural model. This study provides valuable insights into the EGF receptor/HER/ErbB kinase structure and interactions, which can guide the design of future therapies. ",

The antibody has been extensively evaluated in patients with advanced head and neck, glioma, lung, esophageal, pancreatic, and gastric cancer. In this single institution experience, 35 patients with anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) or glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) were treated with irradiation and 200 mg doses of nimotuzumab. The first 6 doses were administered weekly, together with radiotherapy, and then treatment continued every 21 days until 1 year. The median number of doses was 12, and the median cumulative dose was thus 2400 mg of nimotuzumab. The most frequent treatment-related toxicities were increase in liver function tests, fever, nausea, anorexia, asthenia, dizziness, and tremors. These adverse reactions were classified as mild and moderate. The median survival time was 12.4 mo or 27.0 mo for patients with GBM or AA patients, respectively, who received curative-intent radiotherapy in combination with the antibody. The survival time of a matched population treated at the same hospital with irradiation alone was decreased (median 8.0 and 12.2 mo for GBM and AA patients, respectively) compared with that of the patients who received nimotuzumab and curative-intent radiotherapy. We have thus confirmed that nimotuzumab is a very well-tolerated drug, lacking cumulative toxicity after maintenance doses.

To determine the influence of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and recombinant human interleukin 3 on human pancreas and gastric cancer cell cells in vitro, a sensitive microculture test system was established that allows precise quantification of proliferation. A more than twofold enhancement of proliferation was observed by interleukin 3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in two of two cell cultures derived from gastric carcinoma cells, while two of nine cultures from pancreas carcinoma cells have shown enhanced cell growth in the presence of recombinant human interleukin 3 or recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. In comparison, recombinant human epidermal growth factor increased cell growth in two of two gastric and in five of nine pancreas carcinoma cultures. In general, 1-10 ng/mL of the growth factors yielded the highest growth rate, but even 1-pg amounts produced increased cell growth.

Additionally, gastrin markedly increased the S-phase cell population, whereas GKN1 significantly inhibited the effect of gastrin by regulating the expression of G1/S cell-cycle regulators. Furthermore, gastrin induced activation of the NF-kB and β-catenin signaling pathways and increased the expression of CCKBR, EGFR, and c-Met in AGS and MKN1 cells. However, GKN1 completely suppressed these effects of gastrin via downregulation of gastrin/CCKBR/growth factor receptor expression. Moreover, GKN1 reduced gastrin and CCKBR mRNA expression in AGS and MKN1 cells, and there was an inverse correlation between GKN1 and gastrin, as well as between GKN1 and CCKBR mRNA expression in noncancerous gastric mucosae.;These data suggest that GKN1 may contribute to the maintenance of gastric epithelial homeostasis and inhibit gastric carcinogenesis by downregulating the gastrin-CCKBR signaling pathway.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Trastuzumab is currently approved for the clinical treatment of breast and gastric cancer patients with HER-2 positive tumors, but not yet for the treatment of esophageal carcinoma patients, whose tumors typically show 5 ~ 35% HER-2 gene amplification and 0 ~ 56% HER-2 protein expression. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of Trastuzumab in patient-derived esophageal squamous cell carcinoma xenograft (PDECX) mouse models.;PDECX models were established by implanting patient esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissues into immunodeficient (SCID/nude) mice. HER-2 gene copy number (GCN) and protein expression were determined in xenograft tissues and corresponding patient EC samples by FISH and IHC analysis. Trastuzumab anti-tumor efficacy was evaluated within these PDECX models (n = 8 animals/group). Furthermore, hotspot mutations of EGFR, K-ras, B-raf and PIK3CA genes were screened for in the PDECX models and their corresponding patient's ESCC tissues. Similarity between the PDECX models and their corresponding patient's ESCC tissue was confirmed by histology, morphology, HER-2 GCN and mutation.;None of the PDECX models (or their corresponding patient's ESCC tissues) harbored HER-2 gene amplification. IHC staining showed HER-2 positivity (IHC 2+) in 2 PDECX models and negativity in 3 PDECX models. Significant tumor regression was observed in the Trastuzumab-treated EC044 HER-2 positive model (IHC 2+). A second HER-2 positive (IHC 2+) model, EC039, harbored a known PIK3CA mutation and showed strong activation of the AKT signaling pathway and was insensitive to Trastuzumab treatment, but could be resensitised using a combination of Trastuzumab and AKT inhibitor AZD5363. In summary, we established 5 PDECX mouse models and demonstrated tumor regression in response to Trastuzumab treatment in a HER-2 IHC 2+ model, but resistance in a HER-2 IHC 2+/PIK3CA mutated model.;This study demonstrates Trastuzumab-induced tumor regressions in HER-2 positive tumors, and highlights PIK3CA mutation as a potential resistance mechanism to Trastuzumab treatment in pre-clinical patient-derived EC xenograft models.",
