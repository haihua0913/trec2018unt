        "Doc_abstract":"Substantial improvement in the understanding of the oncogenic pathways in thyroid cancer has led to identification of specific molecular alterations, including mutations of BRAF and RET in papillary thyroid cancer, mutation of RAS and rearrangement of PPARG in follicular thyroid cancer, mutation of RET in medullary thyroid cancer, and mutations of TP53 and in the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)/AKT1 pathway in anaplastic thyroid cancer. Ultrasonography (US) and US-guided biopsy remain cornerstones in the initial workup of thyroid cancer. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment, with radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy reserved for differentiated subtypes. Posttreatment surveillance of thyroid cancer is done with US of the thyroid bed as well as monitoring of tumor markers such as serum thyroglobulin and serum calcitonin. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, and fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT are used in the follow-up of patients with negative iodine 131 imaging and elevated tumor markers. Certain mutations, such as mutations of BRAF in papillary thyroid carcinoma and mutations in RET codons 883, 918, and 928, are associated with an aggressive course in medullary thyroid carcinoma, and affected patients need close surveillance. Treatment options for metastatic RAI-refractory thyroid cancer are limited. Currently, Food and Drug Administration-approved molecularly targeted therapies for metastatic RAI-refractory thyroid cancer, including sorafenib, lenvatinib, vandetanib, and cabozantinib, target the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and RET kinases. Imaging plays an important role in assessment of response to these therapies, which can be atypical owing to antiangiogenic effects. A wide spectrum of toxic effects is associated with the molecularly targeted therapies used in thyroid cancer and can be detected at restaging scans. (©)RSNA, 2016. ",

Complete total thyroidectomy is the treatment of choice for PTC, FTC, and MTC. Radioiodine is routinely recommended in high-risk patients and considered in intermediate risk DTC patients. DTC cancer cells, during tumor progression, may lose the iodide uptake ability, becoming resistant to radioiodine, with a significant worsening of the prognosis. The lack of specific and effective drugs for aggressive and metastatic DTC and MTC leads to additional efforts toward the development of new drugs. Several genetic alterations in different molecular pathways in TC have been shown in the past few decades, associated with TC development and progression. Rearranged during transfection (RET)/PTC gene rearrangements, RET mutations, BRAF mutations, RAS mutations, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 angiogenesis pathways are some of the known pathways determinant in the development of TC. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are small organic compounds inhibiting tyrosine kinases auto-phosphorylation and activation, most of them are multikinase inhibitors. TKIs act on the aforementioned molecular pathways involved in growth, angiogenesis, local, and distant spread of TC. TKIs are emerging as new therapies of aggressive TC, including DTC, MTC, and anaplastic thyroid cancer, being capable of inducing clinical responses and stabilization of disease. Vandetanib and cabozantinib have been approved for the treatment of MTC, while sorafenib and lenvatinib for DTC refractory to radioiodine. These drugs prolong median progression-free survival, but until now no significant increase has been observed on overall survival; side effects are common. New efforts are made to find new more effective and safe compounds and to personalize the therapy in each TC patient. ",

External beam radiation therapy is reserved for adjuvant treatment of MTC with aggressive features. Targeted therapeutics vandetanib and cabozantinib are approved for the treatment of aggressive and metastatic tumors that are not amenable to surgery. The use of these multikinase inhibitors are supported by the observed overactivation of the RET oncoprotein in a large subpopulation of MTCs. However, not all patients carry oncogenic alterations of this kinase. Hence, there is still a need for comprehensive molecular characterization of MTC utilizing whole-genome and transcriptome-sequencing methodologies with the aim of identifying targetable mutations.

Unlike its high treatment response to selective BRAF inhibitor (PLX4032) in metastatic melanoma, the treatment response in thyroid cancer is reported to be low. The purpose of this study is to investigate the resistance mechanism responsible for this low treatment response to BRAF inhibitor in order to maximize the effect of targeted therapy. We examined the expression of feedback regulation mechanisms and alterations in the upper signal transduction pathway in thyroid cancer cell lines harboring BRAF mutation. Also, we investigated the effect of dual inhibition from combinatorial therapy. Two thyroid cancer cell lines, 8505C (anaplastic thyroid cancer) and BCPAP (papillary thyroid cancer) were selected and treated with PLX4032 and its drug sensitivity were examined and compared. Further investigation on the changes in signals responsible for the different treatment response to PLX4032 was carried out and the same experiment was performed on orthotopic xenograft mouse models. Unlike BCPAP cells, 8505C cells presented drug resistance to PLX4032 treatment and this was mainly due to increased expression of c-Met. Effective inhibitions of c-Met, p-AKT, and p-ERK were achieved after dual treatment with BRAF inhibitor (PLX4032) and c-Met inhibitor (PHA665752). Similar results were confirmed by in vivo study with orthotopic xenograft mouse model. c-Met-mediated reactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and MAPK pathway contributes to the relative insensitivity of BRAF (V600E) mutant anaplastic thyroid cancer cells to PLX4032. Dual inhibition of BRAF and c-Met leads to sustained treatment response. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

We investigated the efficacy of inhibiting the activated RAS/RAF/MEK pathway in ATC cells aiming to clarify the mechanism of effect and resistance. Four human ATC cell lines (ACT-1, OCUT-2, OCUT-4 and OCUT-6) were used. OCUT-4 had a BRAF mutation. OCUT-2 had both BRAF and PI3KCA mutations. ACT-1 and OCUT-6 had wild-type BRAF and NRAS mutations. The effects of dabrafenib, a selective inhibitor of the BRAFV600E kinase, and trametinib, a reversible inhibitor of MEK activity, were investigated. Dabrafenib strongly inhibited the viability in BRAF mutated cells by demonstrating G0/G1-arrest via the downregulation of MEK/ERK phosphorylation. Upregulated phosphorylation of MEK was observed in RAS mutated cells after dabrafenib treatment and caused VEGF upregulation, but was not related to the cellular proliferation. Trametinib inhibited the cellular viability to variable degrees in every cell by downregulating ERK phosphorylation. Dual blockade by both inhibitors demonstrated clear cytostatic effect in all the cells. OCUT-4 showed the weakest sensitivity to trametinib, no additional effect of either inhibitor in combination with the other, and an increase of SNAI1 mRNA expression after treatment with inhibitors, suggesting a mechanism for resistance. Our findings demonstrated the efficacy of a mutation-selective BRAF inhibitor and a MEK inhibitor in human ATC cells in a genetic alteration-specific manner.",

After 2 months of treatment, she showed a clinical and radiologic response. The patient remained on this combination for 9 months until evidence of disease progression.

Mutations leading to constitutive activation of MAP kinase effectors -the tyrosine receptor kinase RET and the intracellular signalling effectors RAS and BRAF- are essential for the pathogenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Similarly, there is increasing evidence demonstrating that mutations leading to activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase (PI3K)/AKT effectors -PTEN and PI3KCa- are essential for the pathogenesis of follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC). Besides this strong relationship between the histological phenotype and the pathway predominantly activated, the nature of the genetic event seems to determine the biological behaviour of the tumour and the ultimate clinical outcome of the patient. In this review we will summarise and discuss the main genetic events related to thyroid cancer initiation, the contribution of genomics and the convenience of using a new molecular classification of thyroid cancer, complementary to the clinicopathological classification.

The possibility of using inhibitors on the BRAF pathway as became an interesting therapeutic approach. In thyroid cancer cells the target molecules, implicated on the cellular effects, mediated by inhibition of BRAF are not well established. In order to fill this lack of knowledge we studied the proliferation and survival pathways and associated molecules induced by BRAF inhibition in thyroid carcinoma cell lines harbouring distinct genetic backgrounds.;Suppression of BRAF pathway in thyroid cancer cell lines (8505C, TPC1 and C643) was achieved using RNA interference (RNAi) for BRAF and the kinase inhibitor, sorafenib. Proliferation analysis was performed by BrdU incorporation and apoptosis was accessed by TUNEL assay. Levels of protein expression were analysed by western-blot.;Both BRAF RNAi and sorafenib inhibited proliferation in all the cell lines independently of the genetic background, mostly in cells with BRAF(V600E) mutation. In BRAF(V600E) mutated cells inhibition of BRAF pathway lead to a decrease in ERK1/2 phosphorylation and cyclin D1 levels and an increase in p27(Kip1). Specific inhibition of BRAF by RNAi in cells with BRAF(V600E) mutation had no effect on apoptosis. In the case of sorafenib treatment, cells harbouring BRAF(V600E) mutation showed increase levels of apoptosis due to a balance of the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-2.;Our results in thyroid cancer cells, namely those harbouring BRAF(V600E) mutation showed that BRAF signalling pathway provides important proliferation signals. We have shown that in thyroid cancer cells sorafenib induces apoptosis by affecting Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 in BRAF(V600E) mutated cells which was independent of BRAF. These results suggest that sorafenib may prove useful in the treatment of thyroid carcinomas, particularly those refractory to conventional treatment and harbouring BRAF mutations.",

As a novel prognostic molecular marker, this mutation has received considerable attention in recent years for its potential utility in the risk stratification and management of PTC. In PTC, BRAF mutation is closely associated with extrathyroidal extension, lymph node metastasis, advanced tumor stages, disease recurrence, and even patient mortality. Many of the responsible molecular derangements promoted by, or associated with, BRAF mutation have been identified, including over-expression of tumor-promoting genes, suppression of tumor-suppressor genes, and silencing of thyroid iodide-handling genes, resulting in impairment or loss of radioiodine avidity and hence the failure of radioiodine treatment of PTC. BRAF mutation can be readily tested on thyroid fine needle aspiration biopsy specimens, with high preoperative predictive probabilities for clinicopathological outcomes of PTC. As such, the knowledge of BRAF mutation status can facilitate more accurate risk stratification and better decision making at various steps in the management of PTC, from preoperative planning of initial surgical scale to postoperative decisions about appropriate radioiodine treatment and thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression, and to selections of appropriate surveillance modalities for PTC recurrence. The greatest utility of BRAF mutation status is in those cases where traditional clinicopathological criteria alone would otherwise be unreliable in the risk stratification and management of PTC. Use of this unique molecular marker, in conjunction with conventional clinicopathological risk factors, to assist the prognostication of PTC is likely to improve the efficiency of contemporary management of thyroid cancer.",

Therefore, we investigated a relationship between BRAF(V600E) mutation and clinicopathologic factors.;From September 2008 to December 2009, we performed routine analysis of the BRAF(V600E) mutation using thyroid cancer tissue from 424 patients who underwent thyroidectomy with cervical lymph node dissection.;The BRAF(V600E) mutation was found in 335 of 424 cases (79%) and was higher in classic papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) (79.7%) than in the follicular variant of PTC (62.5%) (P = .019). On univariate analysis, the BRAF(V600E) mutation was associated with extrathyroidal extension (P = .009) and variants of PTC (P = .019), but a high-risk Metastasis, Patient Age, Completeness of resection, local Invasion and Tumor Size (MACIS) score (≥ 6) (P = .146) and lymph node metastasis (P = .628) were not significantly associated with the BRAF(V600E) mutation.

We retrospectively analyzed the 2-year medical records of patients who underwent surgery for papillary thyroid carcinoma. After screening, the records of 126 patients who met the study requirements were used to assess the characteristics associated with the BRAF V600E gene mutation. The BRAF mutation incidence rate among patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma was 69.0% (87/126). Univariate analysis revealed that the BRAF mutation status was correlated significantly with both tumor size and lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed a significant correlation between lymph node metastasis and BRAF mutation status (P < 0.05). When the tumor diameter was ≤10 mm, the BRAF mutation status had no effect on lymph node metastasis (P > 0.05). When the tumor diameter was >10 mm, the incidence of lymph node metastasis was significantly higher among BRAF mutation-positive patients than among BRAF mutation-negative patients (P < 0.05). BRAF gene mutations independently predicted central lymph node metastasis in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma. For patients preoperatively diagnosed to be BRAF mutation-positive, the importance of central lymph node dissection should be emphasized because the tumor diameter increases; regional lymphatic and adipose tissue dissection should be routinely conducted. However, in mutation-negative patients with tumor diameters of ≤5 mm, the need for central lymph node dissection should be re-examined. ",

In this study, we hypothesized that histone deacetylation at the NIS (SLC5A5) promoter was the mechanism. Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation approach, we examined histone acetylation status on the lysine residues H3K9/14, H3K18, total H4, and H4K16 at the NIS promoter under the influence of BRAF V600E. We found that expression of stably or transiently transfected BRAF V600E inhibited NIS expression while the deacetylase inhibitor SAHA stimulated NIS expression in PCCL3 rat thyroid cells. Although BRAF V600E enhanced global histone acetylation, it caused histone deacetylation at the NIS promoter while SAHA caused acetylation in the cells. In human thyroid cancer BCPAP cells harboring homozygous BRAF V600E mutation, BRAF V600E inhibitor, PLX4032, and MEK inhibitor, AZD6244, increased histone acetylation of the NIS promoter, suggesting that BRAF V600E normally maintained histone in a deacetylated state at the NIS promoter. The regions most commonly affected with deacetylation by BRAF V600E were the transcriptionally active areas upstream of the translation start that contained important transcription factor binding sites, including nucleotides -297/-107 in the rat NIS promoter and -692/-370 in the human NIS promoter. Our findings not only reveal an epigenetic mechanism for BRAF V600E-promoted NIS silencing involving histone deacetylation at critical regulatory regions of the NIS promoter but also provide further support for our previously proposed combination therapy targeting major signaling pathways and histone deacetylase to restore thyroid gene expression for radioiodine treatment of thyroid cancer.

Thyroid carcinomas included PTC, follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC), and follicular variant of PTC (FVPTC).;Thirty-nine samples (29 females) were genotyped. The mean age at diagnosis was 14.7 years (range 7.9-18.4 years), and most were Hispanic (56.4%) or Caucasian (35.9%). The mean follow-up period was 2.9 years. Mutations were noted in 21/39 (53.8%), with both BRAF(V600E) (n = 9), and RET/PTC (n = 6) detected only in PTC. Mutations were detected in 2/5 FTC (PAX8/PPARγ and NRAS) and 3/6 FVPTC cases (PAX8/PPARγ). Of 28 PTC patients, 57.1% had mutations: 32.1% with BRAF(V600E), 21.4% with RET/PTC, and 3.6% with NRAS. Of patients with BRAF(V600E), 77.8% were Hispanic and 88.9% were >15 years, while all RET/PTC-positive patients were ≤15 years (p = 0.003). Tumor size, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis at diagnosis (or soon after (131)I ablation) did not vary significantly based on the mutation.;BRAF(V600E) was the most common mutation, especially in older and Hispanic adolescents. A larger, ethnically diverse pediatric cohort followed long term will enable the genotypic variability, clinical presentation, and response to therapy to be better assessed.",

Previous studies have reported conflicting data regarding the impact of BRAF(V600E) on clinicopathological features of PTC. The study aims to determine whether BRAF(V600E) is useful as a prognostic biomarker in PTC.;A cohort study of patients undergoing surgery for PTC was undertaken. The primary outcome measure was disease-free survival. Secondary outcome measures were tumour size, nodal positivity and radioactive iodine ablation rate. All cases were re-examined to confirm PTC. Immunohistochemistry for BRAF(V600E) was performed on tissue microarrays. A single endocrine pathologist, blinded to clinicopathological data, interpreted staining.;496 patients with PTC were included, and 309 (62 %) were BRAF(V600E) positive. Tumour size was similar for BRAF(V600E)-positive and -negative tumours (21.3 vs. 23.2 mm, p = 0.23). BRAF(V600E)-positive patients were significantly older at first operation (mean age 45 versus 49 years, p = 0.003). BRAF(V600E)-positive PTCs had a higher rate of disease recurrence (12.9 vs. 5.6 %, p = 0.004), lymph node metastasis (44 vs. 29.4 %, p = 0.004) and extra-thyroidal extension (44 vs. 22 %, p < 0.001). Five-year disease-free survival was 89.6 % for BRAF(V600E) positive and 96.3 % for negative tumours, p < 0.001. There was no difference between groups for vascular invasion or multifocality. The mean follow-up was 57 months for both groups.;BRAF(V600E) in PTC predicts an increased risk of lymph node metastasis, extra-thyroidal extension and reduced disease-free survival.

DESIGN/SETTING AND PATIENTS: We examined the expression of key markers of thyrocyte differentiation in 56 PTCs with BRAF mutations (BRAF-mut) and 37 with wild-type BRAF (BRAF-wt). Eight samples of normal thyroid tissue were analyzed as controls. Quantitative PCR was used to measure mRNA levels for the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS), apical iodide transporter (AIT-B), thyroglobulin (Tg), thyroperoxidase (TPO), TSH receptor (TSH-R), the transcription factor PAX8, and glucose transporter type 1 (Glut1). NIS protein expression and localization was also analyzed by immunohistochemistry.;mRNA levels for all thyroid-specific genes were reduced in all PTCs vs. normal thyroid tissues. NIS, AIT-B, Tg, and TPO expression was significantly lower in BRAF-mut tumors than in the BRAF-wt group. Glut-1 transcript levels were increased in all PTCs, and additional increases were noted in BRAF-mut tumors. In both tumor subsets, the NIS protein that was expressed was abnormally retained in the cytoplasm.;BRAF V600E mutation in PTCs is associated with reduced expression of key genes involved in iodine metabolism.

The cases were subclassified according to the PD percentage as (1) <20% PD and (2) 20% to 40% PD, and were studied for CXCR4 expression and BRAF mutation. CXCR4 and molecular testing were distinctly performed on both components of each lesion. The majority of the cases (69%) showed an extrathyroid and metastatic dissemination. Regardless of the 2 categories, we had 8/16 (50%) patients with disease-free status. CXCR4 was negative in all 16 cases, whereas 3 of them (19%) had a mutated BRAF only in the WDC component of the lesion. WDCs with a minor PD pattern, even when <20%, showed more aggressive features than pure WDCs and should be entirely considered as PD carcinoma.

Interestingly, the mitochondrial localization and antiapoptotic activities of BRAF(V600E) were unaffected by sorafenib and U0126 suppression of MAPK kinase (MEK) and ERK activities. Similarly, although the RAF inhibitor sorafenib effectively inhibited MEK/ERK activation, it did not block the mitochondrial localization of BRAF(V600E). In addition, inducible expression of BRAF(V600E) increased the glucose uptake rate and decreased O(2) consumption, suggesting that BRAF(V600E) reduces mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, a signature feature of cancer cells. Again, these metabolic alterations resulted by BRAF(V600E) expression were not affected by the treatment of thyroid cells by sorafenib. Therefore, RAF and MEK inhibitors are unable to block the antiapoptotic activity of BRAF(V600E) or correct the high glucose uptake rate and glycolytic activity and suppressed mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation induced by BRAF(V600E).;The mitochondrial localization observed in oncogenic BRAF mutants might be related to their altered responses to apoptotic stimuli and characteristic metabolic phenotypes found in thyroid cancer. The inability of MEK and RAF inhibitors, U0126 and sorafenib, respectively, to block the mitochondrial localization of BRAF(V600E) has additional therapeutic implications for BRAF(V600E)-positive thyroid cancers.",

While external beam radiation therapy has improved locoregional control, the median survival of approximately 4 months has not changed in more than half a century due to uncontrolled systemic metastases. The objective of this study was to review the literature in order to identify potential new strategies for treating this highly lethal cancer. PubMed searches were the principal source of articles reviewed. The molecular pathogenesis of ATC includes mutations in BRAF, RAS, catenin (cadherin-associated protein), beta 1, PIK3CA, TP53, AXIN1, PTEN, and APC genes, and chromosomal abnormalities are common. Several microarray studies have identified genes and pathways preferentially affected, and dysregulated microRNA profiles differ from differentiated thyroid cancers. Numerous proteins involving transcription factors, signaling pathways, mitosis, proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, adhesion, migration, epigenetics, and protein degradation are affected. A variety of agents have been successful in controlling ATC cell growth both in vitro and in nude mice xenografts. While many of these new compounds are in cancer clinical trials, there are few studies being conducted in ATC. With the recent increased knowledge of the many critical genes and proteins affected in ATC, and the extensive array of targeted therapies being developed for cancer patients, there are new opportunities to design clinical trials based upon tumor molecular profiling and preclinical studies of potentially synergistic combinatorial novel therapies.",

It is relatively indolent, however other types poorly differentiated or anaplastic, are more aggressive and usually associated with poor prognosis. Approximately half of these papillary carcinomas harbor a thymine-to-adenine transversion (T1799A) point mutation, in the gene encoding the serine/threonine-kinase B-type Raf kinase (BRAF), with substitution of valine by glutamate (V600E). Mutated BRAF, generates a constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway, which plays a critical role in transmitting proliferative signals generated by cell surface receptors and cytoplasmic signaling elements, to the nucleus. BRAF mutation is mutually exclusive with other common genetic alterations, supporting its independent oncogenic role in cell proliferation, survival and tumor de-differentiation. The BRAFV600E occurs exclusively in papillary thyroid carcinoma and papillary carcinoma-derived anaplastic cancer, rising as a specific diagnostic marker for this tumor when identified in cytological / histological exams. This mutation has recently emerged, as a potential prognostic marker for papillary thyroid carcinoma, after several studies have found this mutation to be associated with some clinicopathological characteristics, known to predict tumor recurrence and progression, including, for instance, old patient age, extrathyroidal invasion and lymph node metastasis. It is therefore considered a marker of aggressive disease in these tumors, associated with increased cancer recurrence and even loss of radioiodine avidity. Several studies were not able to confirm these associations. It has become clearer that BRAF mutation will likely have significant impact on the clinical management of papillary thyroid carcinoma.",

PTC represents 80-90% of all thyroid cancers and over the past five years, more than 200 manuscripts have been published about the relationship between \"B-Raf(V600E) and thyroid cancer\". B-Raf(V600E) genetically arises from a transversion point mutation (valine-to-glutamate substitution at amino acid residue-600, V600E) and leads to over activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway. The MAPK pathway is essential for transmitting proliferation signals generated by cell surface receptors and cytoplasmic signaling elements to the nucleus. In many cancers, including thyroid cancer, B-Raf(V600E) appears to play a crucial role in cell proliferation, survival and de-differentiation. In thyroid cancer, the V600E mutation occurs with greater frequently in aggressive subtypes of PTC, and in individuals that present at advanced stages of disease with extra-thyroidal extension and/or lymph node metastases. B-Raf(V600E) is considered a marker of aggressive disease in both PTC (>1 cm) and micro-PTC (</=1 cm), and interestingly, is associated with both loss of I-131 avidity and PTC recurrence. Though treatment of patients with thyroid cancer is usually successful and most patients are rendered disease-free, to date there are no effective therapies for patients with invasive, non-radioiodine sensitive tumors or metastatic disease.

We investigated DUSP4 expression at the mRNA level in PTC tissues and adjacent normal tissues using real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).

Initially, we compared PTC tissues with paired normal tissues in DUSP4 expression using Student's t-test, and then analyzed the correlation of DUSP4 with clinicopathological variables and BRAF(V600E) mutation in PTC using Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis, χ (2), and Fisher's exact tests. Human-derived thyroid cell lines were also used to verify our findings. DUSP4 was significantly overexpressed in PTC tissues compared with the adjacent normal tissues (P<0.001). High DUSP4 expression showed a significant association with lymph node metastasis and extrathyroidal extension in both FUSCC and TCGA cohorts, and DUSP4 overexpression was an independent risk factor for lymph node metastasis in multivariate analysis. Additionally, DUSP4 expression was associated with BRAF(V600E) mutation in both the cohorts (FUSCC: P=0.002, TCGA: P<0.001) and PTC cell lines (P=0.023).

        "Doc_abstract":"Constitutive ERK activation is a common finding in human cancer and is often the result of activating mutations of BRAF and RAS. BRAF missense mutations occur in approximately 8% of human tumors, most frequently in melanoma, papillary thyroid cancer and colon cancer. Mutations in BRAF have been found predominantly in tumors in which RAS is commonly mutated but concurrent mutations of both BRAF and RAS are extremely rare. Though over 40 different kinase domain mutations in BRAF have been identified, a single base-pair substitution in exon 15 at codon 600 (V600E) is found in over 80% of cases. These mutations cluster in the glycine-rich loop and activation segments of the kinase and are predicted to induce kinase activation by disrupting the inhibitory glycine-rich loop/activation segment interaction which characterizes the inactive conformation. The majority of mutations identified cause constitutive kinase activation with the V600E mutation demonstrating approximately 500-fold greater kinase activity than wild-type BRAF. Supporting its classification as an oncogene, V600E BRAF stimulates ERK signaling, induces proliferation and is capable in model systems of promoting transformation. However, BRAF mutations are common in nevi and colon polyps suggesting that BRAF mutation alone is insufficient for tumorigenesis and additional mutations are required for cancer development. Though such data suggest that BRAF mutation is likely an early initiating event in tumors such as melanoma and colon cancer, preclinical studies suggest that tumors with V600E BRAF mutation remain dependent upon BRAF for proliferation and survival. Given its frequent occurrence in human cancer and the continued requirement for BRAF activity in tumors with BRAF mutation, efforts are underway to develop targeted inhibitors of BRAF and its downstream effectors. The first generation of RAF inhibitors, including sorafenib, were notable for their lack of specificity and potency for RAF and these agents have shown limited efficacy in tumors with a high incidence of BRAF mutation such as melanoma. Novel inhibitors of the pathway with greater selectivity for BRAF and MEK are now in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials with promising early results. To maximize the likelihood of success with these agents, clinical trials enriched with patients whose tumors possess BRAF and RAS mutations have been proposed.",

Kinase inhibitors are among the most promising new agents as alternative strategies. The BRAF- and multi-kinase inhibitor, sorafenib, has already shown antitumor effects in thyroid carcinoma patients in a phase III clinical trial. In this study we aim to better characterize molecular effects and efficacy of sorafenib against thyroid carcinoma cells with various histological origins and different BRAF mutational status. Analysis of different signaling pathways affected by sorafenib may contribute to assist a more specific therapy choice with fewer side effects. Twelve thyroid carcinoma cell lines derived from anaplastic, follicular and papillary thyroid carcinomas with wildtype or mutationally activated BRAF were treated with sorafenib. Growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest, cell death induction and inhibition of intracellular signaling pathways were then comprehensively analyzed.;Cell viability was analyzed by MTT assay, and the cell cycle was assessed by flow cytometry after propidium iodide staining. Cell death was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase liberation assays, caspase activity assays and subG1 peak determinations. Inhibition of intracellular pathways was analyzed in dot blot and western blot analyses.;Sorafenib inhibited proliferation of all thyroid carcinoma cell lines tested with IC50 values ranging between 1.85 and 4.2 μM. Cells derived from papillary carcinoma harboring the mutant BRAF (V600E) allele were slightly more sensitive to sorafenib than those harboring wildtype BRAF. Cell cycle analyses and caspase assays showed a sorafenib-dependent induction of apoptosis in all cell lines, whereas increased lactate dehydrogenase release suggested cell membrane disruption. Sorafenib treatment caused a rapid inhibition of various MAP kinases in addition to inhibiting AKT and receptor tyrosine kinases.;Sorafenib inhibited multiple intracellular signaling pathways in thyroid carcinoma cells, which resulted in cell cycle arrest and the initiation of apoptosis. Sorafenib was effective against all thyroid carcinoma cell lines regardless of their tumor subtype origin or BRAF status, confirming that sorafenib is therapeutically beneficial for patients with any subtype of dedifferentiated thyroid cancer. Inhibition of single intracellular targets of sorafenib in thyroid carcinoma cells may allow the development of more specific therapeutic intervention with less side effects.",

BRAF is an element of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK (MAPK) pathway, which when constitutively active can lead to increased proliferation rate, enhanced survival, invasion and metastasis. The development of small molecule inhibitors of mutant BRAF kinase has changed the care of patients, especially with melanoma. Despite the success in treating melanoma with inhibitors of mutant BRAF and other elements of RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK (MAPK) pathway, resistance limits the long-term responsiveness to these drugs. The resistance mechanisms to MAPK pathway inhibition are complex, occur at genomic and phenotypic levels, and frequently the same patient can simultaneously develop diverse mechanisms of resistance in different progressive metastases or even in the same lesion. In the current review, we summarize recent research on mutations in BRAF and their importance for the development of tumor. This review will also give an overview on the current knowledge concerning therapies for patients harboring mutation in BRAF and discusses the diverse mechanisms of resistance developed in response to these targeted therapies.

Using gene set enrichment analysis and in vitro and in vivo functional studies, we identified and validated a B-Raf(V600E) gene set signature associated with tumor progression in PTCs. An independent cohort of B-Raf(V600E)-positive PTCs showed significantly higher expression levels of many extracellular matrix genes compared with controls. We performed extensive in vitro and in vivo validations on thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), because it has been previously shown to be important in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis and metastasis and is present in abundance in tumor stroma. Knockdown of B-Raf(V600E) resulted in TSP-1 down-regulation and a reduction of adhesion and migration/invasion of human thyroid cancer cells. Knockdown of TSP-1 resulted in a similar phenotype. B-Raf(V600E) cells in which either B-Raf(V600E) or TSP-1 were knocked down were implanted orthotopically into the thyroids of immunocompromised mice, resulting in significant reduction in tumor size and fewer pulmonary metastases from the primary carcinoma as compared with the control cells. Treatment of orthotopic thyroid tumors, initiated 1 week after tumor cell implantation with PLX4720, an orally available selective inhibitor of B-Raf(V600E), caused a significant tumor growth delay and decreased distant metastases, without evidence of toxicity. In conclusion, B-Raf(V600E) plays an important role in PTC progression through genes (i.e., TSP-1) important in tumor invasion and metastasis. Testing of a patient's thyroid cancer for B-Raf(V600E) will yield important information about potential tumor aggressiveness and also allow for future use of targeted therapies with selective B-Raf(V600E) inhibitors, such as PLX4720.",

U0126 also restored the expression of these genes in V600E BRAF-harboring PTC-derived NPA cells. Knockdown of BRAF by specific small interfering RNA restored expression of some of these genes in NPA cells. Luciferase reporter assay using thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor gene as a model showed that the promoter activity was modulated by the MAP kinase pathway. Promoter methylation in association with DNA methyltransferase expression played a role in gene silencing by MAP kinase pathway in NPA cells.;We showed the restorability of expression of thyroid iodide-metabolizing genes silenced by V600E BRAF, and linked this process to gene methylation in PTC cells. The results provide clinical implications that therapeutic targeting at the BRAF/MEK/MAP kinase pathway may be a good approach in restoring thyroid gene expression for effective radioiodine therapy for BRAF mutation-harboring PTC.",

Multimodality therapy consisting of both radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy is essential in obtaining local/regional control. Although ATC has been relatively chemo resistant, newer agents such like taxotere show promise. The role of surgery in the treatment of ATC continues to evolve, presently it should be reserved for patients who have shown an initial response to multimodality therapy and in patients in whom a complete macroscopic resection can be achieved with minimal morbidity. The successful treatment of TL currently lies in accurately diagnosing the histological subtype. Both large B-cell and mixed lymphomas are best treated with multimodality therapy consisting of CHOP combined with hyper-fractioned RT. MALT lymphomas with there more indolent course may be amenable to single modality RT or total thyroidectomy if diagnosed at an early stage IE.;Although both ATC and TL are rare, it is important for surgeons to be aware of the need for multimodality therapy when treating these patients and to understand the limited role surgery plays in diagnosis and treatment.",

Overall recurrence rate was 6.3% (8/126) in Group A and 7.7% (9/118) in Group B, with a mean follow-up of 47 (Group A) and 64 (Group B) months. In Group A patients, 47% were pN1a and all patients with recurrence had nodal involvement (p = 0.002). Survival rate did not differ in the two groups. Nine patients were lost to follow-up. Group A patients were older and their tumours were larger in size; according to the pT distribution, a higher extra-capsular invasion rate was observed. The two groups were equivalent as far as concerns histological high risk variants and multifocality. Nodal metastases correlated with stage: pT1-2 vs. pT3-T4a, p = 0.0036. A lower risk of nodal metastases was related to thyroiditis (p = 0.0034). In conclusion, central neck metastases were predictive of recurrence without influencing prognosis.

        "Doc_abstract":"Well-differentiated thyroid cancer has in general terms a very good outcome. It has a very slow growth rate and, although it metastasizes at a relatively high frequency, it has very high survival rates. Whereas the prevalence of nodular thyroid disease worldwide is high, malignant conversion from benign thyroid nodules is rare. Treatment of thyroid cancer is usually successful, but we still do not have effective therapies for patients with invasive or metastatic thyroid cancer if the disease does not concentrate radioiodine and it is not surgically resectable. On the other hand, from the same thyroid cell, one of the most aggressive human tumours can arise--undifferentiated or anaplastic thyroid carcinoma--leading to death in a few months. What features of this malignancy account for such paradoxical behaviour? The most common type of thyroid cancer--papillary thyroid carcinoma--stands out among solid tumours because many of the tumour-initiating events have been identified. All of them function in a single pathway--the RTK/RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway--and obey an 'exclusivity principle': one and only one component of the pathway is mutated in a single tumour. This highlights the requirement of this signal transduction pathway for the transformation to thyroid cancer and paves the way to targeted therapies against a tumour with a mutation in a known gene or any gene upstream of the target. However, it is also interesting to underscore the differences among the tumours arising from the different mutations. Studies in vitro and in vivo, including genomic profiling and genetically engineered mouse models, have clearly shown that each oncoprotein exerts its own oncogenic drive, conferring a distinct biological behaviour on thyroid tumours. In this review, we attempt to summarise the most recent advances in thyroid follicular cell-derived cancers research and their potential clinical impact that may change the management of thyroid cancer in the near future.",

Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB have been shown to play an important role in thyroid cancer. In particular, TIMP-1 binds its receptor CD63 on cell surface membrane and activates Akt signaling pathway, which is eventually responsible for its anti-apoptotic activity. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether interplay among these three factors exists and exerts a functional role in PTCs. To this purpose, 56 PTC specimens were analyzed for BRAF(V600E) mutation, TIMP-1 expression, and NF-κB activation. We found that BRAF(V600E) mutation occurs selectively in PTC nodules and is associated with hyperactivation of NF-κB and upregulation of both TIMP-1 and its receptor CD63. To assess the functional relationship among these factors, we first silenced BRAF gene in BCPAP cells, harboring BRAF(V600E) mutation. We found that silencing causes a marked decrease in TIMP-1 expression and NF-κB binding activity, as well as decreased invasiveness. After treatment with specific inhibitors of MAPK pathway, we found that only sorafenib was able to increase IκB-α and reduce both TIMP-1 expression and Akt phosphorylation in BCPAP cells, indicating that BRAF(V600E) activates NF-κB and this pathway is MEK-independent. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that BRAF(V600E) causes upregulation of TIMP-1 via NF-κB. TIMP-1 binds then its surface receptor CD63, leading eventually to Akt activation, which in turn confers antiapoptotic behavior and promotion of cell invasion. The recognition of this functional trilogy provides insight on how BRAF(V600E) determines cancer initiation, progression, and invasiveness in PTC, also identifying new therapeutic targets for the treatment of highly aggressive forms.",

A small percentage of such patients, however, do not undergo remission and need new therapeutic approaches. Both anaplastic and medullary thyroid carcinomas exhibit aggressive behavior and are usually resistant to current therapeutic modalities. Thyroid carcinoma represents a fascinating model and a particularly promising paradigm for targeted therapy because some of the key oncogenic events are activating mutations of genes coding for tyrosine kinases, and these occur early in cancer development. A prototype is the RET proto-oncogene, a receptor tyrosine kinase, which is a key regulator of development and a 'hotspot' for oncogenic mutations. Mutations in the RET proto-oncogene have been identified as causative for papillary carcinoma and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma, making it an attractive target for selective inhibition in these subtypes. ZD 6474 has shown promising activity in preclinical models against RET kinase, and its contemporary inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor and epidermal growth factor pathways renders it a very attractive drug for clinical trials in thyroid cancer. Activating point mutation of B-RAF can occur early in the development of papillary carcinoma. Moreover, papillary carcinomas with these mutations have more aggressive properties and are diagnosed more often at an advanced stage. Clinical evaluation of B-RAF-targeting drugs is undergoing and trials in thyroid cancer are planned.

Novel targeted therapies aimed at the inhibition of the mutated oncoprotein BRAF(V600E) have shown promise in vivo and in vitro but do not result in cellular apoptosis. TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces apoptosis in a tumor-selective manner by activating the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Here, we show that a TRAIL-R2 agonist antibody, lexatumumab, induces apoptosis effectively in some thyroid cancer cell lines (HTh-7, TPC-1 and BCPAP), while more aggressive anaplastic cell lines (8505c and SW1736) show resistance. Treatment of the most resistant cell line, 8505c, using lexatumumab in combination with the BRAF(V600E) inhibitor, PLX4720, and the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, (triple-drug combination) sensitizes the cells by triggering both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways in vitro as well as 8505c orthotopic thyroid tumors in vivo. A decrease in anti-apoptotic proteins, pAkt, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 and c-FLIP, coupled with an increase in the activator proteins, Bax and Bim, results in an increase in the Bax to Bcl-xL ratio that appears to be critical for sensitization and subsequent apoptosis of these resistant cells. Our results suggest that targeting the death receptor pathway in thyroid cancer can be a promising strategy for inducing apoptosis in thyroid cancer cells, although combination with other kinase inhibitors may be needed in some of the more aggressive tumors initially resistant to apoptosis.

They usually carry a favorable prognosis, although patients with invasive or metastatic tumors that no longer trap radioiodine do less well. There is mounting experimental support for a central role of mutations leading to constitutive activation of MAP kinase effectors in the pathogenesis ofthis disease. Thus activating mutations of the tyrosine receptor kinases RET and NTRK, and of the intracellular signaling effectors RAS and BRAF are present in a mutually exclusive fashion in more than 70% of cases. These mutations are believed to arise at early stages of cancer development, and may be important in tumor maintenance. Hence, compounds that inhibit kinase activity of effectors signaling distally along this pathway may prove effective in treating advanced forms of the disease.",

Tumor visualization correlated with rapid tumor growth and large tumor volume as judged from calcitonin levels. The 111In concentration ratio between tumor (T) and blood (B) in surgically excised lymph node metastases of MTC showed a large variation, with low values for microscopic and high values for macroscopic metastases in individual patients. Three cases of MTC, Hürthle cell adenoma and papillary thyroid cancer are reported with preoperative scintigraphy, T/B ratios and Northern analyses of the surgical biopsies. Visualization of tumors was possible in the absence of sstr2 (the high affinity receptor for octreotide) with the exception of microscopic tumor growth. T/B values in the patient with Hürthle cell adenoma were similar to those found in the contralateral thyroid lobe with goitre. The relatively high uptake of 111In in benign thyroid conditions probably limits the use of octreotide scintigraphy in the diagnosis of primary tumors. The technique has certain advantages over radioiodine scintigraphy after the surgical treatment of thyroid tumors: no need for withdrawal of thyroxin substitution; a possibility to diagnose metastases of tumors that do not concentrate radioiodine (MTC, Hürthle cell cancer); and complementary information about metastatic sites of non-medullary thyroid cancer (papillary and follicular tumors).",

When this cutoff was applied in the cross-validation, high Mig-6 expression was associated with longer survival (P = .03) and disease-free survival (P = .07). Furthermore, high Mig-6 expression was independently predictive of greater disease-free survival in BRAF(V600E)-positive PTC.;High Mig-6 expression in PTC is associated with favorable outcomes.

While ionizing radiation is the only one well-known risk factor for thyroid cancer, the significance of some others remains unclear. The aim of our review was to discuss some not completely known pathophysiological mechanisms involved in thyroid oncogenesis as hypothyroidism, mutations of genes regulating cell proliferation, thyroid autoimmunity and pregnancy and to describe pathophysiological background of some ultrasound markers of thyroid cancer (size, echogenicity, vascularization, calcifications and stiffness). Better knowledge in this field is crucial for development of novel diagnostic techniques and therapeutic approaches. For example, the analysis of BRAF, RAS and other mutations in cytological samples may help to distinction between follicular thyroid carcinoma and follicular thyroid adenoma and may significantly decrease the number of unnecessary surgery among patients with thyroid nodules. Alternatively, the different malign cells growth, angiogenesis, destructions of thyroid follicles, reparative changes, growth retardation, fibrosis and increased interstitial fluid pressure implicate the typical ultrasound appearance of papillary thyroid cancer (hypoechogenicity, irregular vascularization, microcalcifications, stiffness) which is essential to catch the suspicious nodules on the basis of their ultrasound appearance among large amount of benign nodules.

Our case emphasizes the critical diagnostic pitfalls due to the use of BRAF (V600E) mutation analysis in thyroid FNA. Notably, BRAF (V600E) mutation is common in melanoma, colorectal carcinoma, lung carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, brain tumors, hairy cell leukemia, multiple myeloma, and histiocytoses. Therefore, in cases of indeterminate FNA with unclassifiable atypical cells BRAF (V600E) mutated, the possibility of a localization of hystiocytosis or a secondary thyroid malignancy should be taken into account.

        "Doc_abstract":"Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is the most frequent thyroid cancer entity, accounting for 88 % of cases. It may metastasize and loose iodine uptake capability, preventing any radioiodine or surgical treatment. The main gene altered in PTC is BRAF, which is found altered in over 50 % of cases. Moreover MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways are greatly implicated in PTC development. Many target therapies for PTC are currently under investigation, unfortunately without the expected results. Aim of this study was to characterized the preclinical effectiveness of novel promising drugs, RAF265, SB590885 and ZSTK474 in 3 thyroid cancer cell lines (BCPAP, K1, 8505C). RAF265 and SB590885 target differentially BRAF, while ZSTK474 acts on PI3K. IC50 demonstrated high drug activities ranging from 0.1 to 6.2 μM, depending on drugs and cell type, while combination index revealed an interesting synergistic effect of combination regimen (RAF265 + ZSTK474 and SB590885 + ZSTK474) in almost all cell lines. Moreover this synergistic effect was particularly evident by Western blot, whereas dual MAPK and PI3K/Akt inhibition was detected. In addition, treating cells with SB590885 induced marked morphological changes, leading to massive vacuolization. This suggests an activation of apoptotic process, as underlined by Annexin V flow cytometry analysis. Also cell cycle was altered in treated cells, without evidence of a common pattern, but rather with a more specific effect relying on single drug or combination regimen used. Since beneficial effects of in vitro combination regimen (RAF265 + ZSTK474 and SB590885 + ZSTK474), it is recommended additional investigation. These data suggest the potential use of combination regimen in in vivo experiment or afterwards in human PTC. ",

Many tumor suppressor genes are aberrantly methylated in thyroid cancer, and some even in benign thyroid tumors, suggesting a role of this epigenetic event in early thyroid tumorigenesis. Methylation of some of these genes tends to occur in certain types of thyroid cancer and is related to specific signaling pathways. For example, methylation of PTEN and RASSF1A genes occurs mostly in follicular thyroid cancer, and its tumorigenic role may be related to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway, whereas methylation of genes for tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3, SLC5A8, and death-associated protein kinase occurs in papillary thyroid cancer and is related to the BRAF/MAPK kinase/MAPK pathway. Methylation of thyroid-specific genes, such as those for sodium/iodide symporter and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor, is also common in thyroid cancer. Although its tumorigenic role is not clear, methylation, and hence silencing, of these thyroid-specific genes is a cause for the failure of clinical radioiodine treatment of thyroid cancer. Unlike gene methylation, histone modifications have been relatively poorly investigated in thyroid tumors. Future studies need to emphasize the mechanistic aspects of these two types of epigenetic alterations to uncover new molecular mechanisms in thyroid tumorigenesis and to provide novel therapeutic targets for thyroid cancer.",

Tissue microarray studies can produce genetic maps and proteomics, patterns of protein expression of TTM derived from preoperative biopsies and specimens. For instance, papillary and medullary thyroid cancers harbor RAS, RET, and BRAF genetic mutations. Follicular thyroid cancers harbor translocations and fusions of certain genes (PAX 8 and PPAR-gamma). Proteomic analysis from various tissue sources can provide useful information regarding the overall state of a thyroid cancer cell. Understanding the molecular events related to these genetic and protein alterations can potentially clarify thyroid cancer pathogenesis and guide appropriate molecular targeted therapies. However, despite the realization that these emerging technologies hold great promise, there are still significant obstacles to the routine use of TTM. These include equivocal thyroid nodule tissue morphologic interpretations, inadequate standardization of methods, and monetary costs. Interpretative shortcomings are frequently due to the relative scarcity of cellular material from fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) specimens. This can be rectified with large needle aspiration biopsy (LNAB) techniques and is exemplified by the favorable performance of galectin-3 determinations on LNAB specimens.",

Both tumors were analyzed for the BRAF (Val600Glu) mutation and the RET/PTC1 translocation. The PTC was positive for the BRAF mutation but negative for RET/PTC1.

We analyzed exon 15 of BRAF spanning the V600 locus by direct sequencing in 1,320 adult and pediatric tumors of the nervous system including various types of glial, embryonal, neuronal and glioneuronal, meningeal, adenohypophyseal/sellar, and peripheral nervous system tumors. A total of 96 BRAF mutations were detected; 93 of the V600E type and 3 cases with a three base pair insertion between codons 599 and 600. The highest frequencies of BRAF (V600E) mutations were found in WHO grade II pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (42/64; 66%) and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas with anaplasia (15/23; 65%), as well as WHO grade I gangliogliomas (14/77; 18%), WHO grade III anaplastic gangliogliomas (3/6) and pilocytic astrocytomas (9/97; 9%). In pilocytic astrocytomas BRAF (V600E) mutation was strongly associated with extra-cerebellar location (p = 0.009) and was most frequent in diencephalic tumors (4/12; 33%). Glioblastomas and other gliomas were characterized by a low frequency or absence of mutations. No mutations were detected in non-glial tumors, including embryonal tumors, meningiomas, nerve sheath tumors and pituitary adenomas. The high mutation frequencies in pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas, gangliogliomas and extra-cerebellar pilocytic astrocytomas implicate BRAF (V600E) mutation as a valuable diagnostic marker for these rare tumor entities.

Their effects in humans are not known.;We conducted a study to determine whether the MAPK kinase (MEK) 1 and MEK2 inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) could reverse refractoriness to radioiodine in patients with metastatic thyroid cancer. After stimulation with thyrotropin alfa, dosimetry with iodine-124 positron-emission tomography (PET) was performed before and 4 weeks after treatment with selumetinib (75 mg twice daily). If the second iodine-124 PET study indicated that a dose of iodine-131 of 2000 cGy or more could be delivered to the metastatic lesion or lesions, therapeutic radioiodine was administered while the patient was receiving selumetinib.;Of 24 patients screened for the study, 20 could be evaluated. The median age was 61 years (range, 44 to 77), and 11 patients were men. Nine patients had tumors with BRAF mutations, and 5 patients had tumors with mutations of NRAS. Selumetinib increased the uptake of iodine-124 in 12 of the 20 patients (4 of 9 patients with BRAF mutations and 5 of 5 patients with NRAS mutations). Eight of these 12 patients reached the dosimetry threshold for radioiodine therapy, including all 5 patients with NRAS mutations.

The in vitro antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of sorafenib on ATC cell lines were examined. To study the in vivo effects of sorafenib on orthotopic ATC tumors in nude mice, sorafenib was given p.o. at 40 or 80 mg/kg daily. Intratumoral effects were studied using immunohistochemical analysis. The effect of sorafenib on survival of the mice was also studied. Sorafenib inhibited the in vitro proliferation of ATC cell lines. Sorafenib also significantly inhibited tumor angiogenesis via the induction of endothelial apoptosis in an orthotopic model of thyroid cancer. As result, the growth of orthotopic ATC xenografts was reduced and the survival of the test animals was improved. Sorafenib exerts significant antitumor activity in an orthotopic xenograft model of ATC via a potent antiangiogenic effect. The antiangiogenic effects of sorafenib suggest that its use in clinical setting may not depend on the BRAF mutational status of thyroid tumors.

Furthermore, the prevalence did not significantly increase in cases demonstrating high-risk biological features such as clinically apparent lymph node metastasis, massive extrathyroid extension, advanced age, distant metastasis at surgery, and advanced Stage. The disease-free survival of patients with BRAF(V600E) mutation did not differ from that of those without BRAF(V600E) mutation.

The goal of this study was to clarify the role of the BRAF mutation as a determinant for the operative extent in conventional PTC.;Histopathology and BRAF mutation status of 3,019 patients with conventional PTC were analyzed. With regard to the extent of surgery in PTC, focus was given to the factors of tumor bilaterality, central lymph node metastasis (CLNM), and lateral lymph node metastasis. In addition, the prognostic impact of BRAF mutation on loco-regional recurrence was investigated.;The BRAF mutation was found to be an independent indicator of tumor bilaterality (odds ratio [OR] 1.484, P = .010); however, it was not an independent indicator of CLNM (OR 1.167, P = .254) or lateral lymph node metastasis (OR 0.647, P = .384). Moreover, it was not an independent indicator of CLNM in either the therapeutic or prophylactic central neck dissection. Finally, BRAF mutation positivity did not increase the risk of loco-regional recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.829, P = .523).;The BRAF mutation is a possible indicator for determining the extent of thyroidectomy required but not for the extent of lymph node dissection and prognosis in patients with conventional PTC.",

In addition to approved therapies (sorafenib and lenvatinib), other multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors that are commercially available have been recognized as viable treatment options for RAI-R DTC. Our preference is to initially use lenvatinib, given the dramatic progression-free survival (PFS) improvement versus placebo, with the caveat that 24 mg daily is not often tolerated and lower doses often used. In patients with BRAF V600E mutation, BRAF inhibitors are now considered for treatment, especially if patients are at high risk from antiangiogenic therapy. Research is continuing to evolve in identifying mechanisms related to radioiodine refractoriness, and trials are evaluating therapeutic molecules to overcome this resistance.

Eighteen (58%) of the adult cases, but only one of the 35 cases aged less than 16 harboured a BRAF T1796A mutation. There was complete agreement between the two methods used, suggesting that the MALDI-TOF assay is a robust alternative to conventional mutation analysis.

Eight of the younger group of patients were born after 1 December 1986 and were therefore not exposed to radioiodine in fallout from Chernobyl. None of the PTCs from these eight patients were positive for BRAF mutation. The frequency of RET rearrangement was 44% in the 27 cases exposed to radiation and 50% in the eight not exposed.

The predominant BRAF V600E mutation has not been detected in benign thyroid tissue so far, so consequently, this assumedly pathognomonic alteration is qualified to improve the preoperative diagnosis of PTC.;Two hundred ninety preoperatively harvested fine-needle aspiration biopsies (FNABs) underwent routine cytologic assessment. BRAF V600E mutation analysis was performed by mutation-specific PCR using the same cell material; a hybrid-specific RT-PCR assay was used for detection of RET/PTC1 rearrangements. Detected genetic alterations were verified by direct sequencing. Definitive histopathology was obtained in 93/290 lesions following surgery of the respective thyroid nodule.;While cytology alone diagnosed 13/30 malignancies (22 PTCs, 4 FTCs, 1 MTC, 1 UTC, 2 metastases), five additional malignancies were identified by supplementary mutation analysis. Cytology classified eight FNABs as benign, while postoperative histology demonstrated a thyroid malignancy (6 PTCs, 1 FTC, 1 metastasis). In four of these eight cases, the genetic analysis detected a BRAF V600E mutation or a RET/PTC1 rearrangement. Classifying both suspicious and malignant FNAB results as positive cytology results, supplementary genetic testing increased the overall sensitivity of FNAB from 70.4 to 85.7%, the positive predictive value (PPV) from 59.4 to 64.9%, and the negative predictive value (NPV) from 84.0 to 91.3%.;Supplementary mutation analysis of RET and especially of the BRAF V600E mutation in FNABs is a fast and probably cost-effective assay in routine diagnostic setting. Mutation analyses of PTC-specific genetic alterations improve the preoperative identification and prognostic assessment of thyroid malignancies and therefore enable an optimized surgical strategy.",

Its mechanism of action involves selective inhibition of the mutated BRAF V600E kinase that leads to reduced signalling through the aberrant mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Its efficacy is restricted to melanomas carrying the BRAF V600E mutation, which is seen in approximately 50% of all melanomas. In a randomized phase III trial, it was superior to dacarbazine in first-line treatment of advanced melanoma, with an overall response rate (ORR) of 48% (95% CI 42, 45), an estimated 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) of 5.3 versus 1.6 months (hazard ratio [HR] 0.26; 95% CI 0.20, 0.33; p < 0.001) and a statistically superior 12-month overall survival (OS) rate of 55% versus 43% (HR 0.62 [95% CI 0.49, 0.77]). Vemurafenib is generally well tolerated, but its use can be associated with development of cutaneous neoplasms such as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and keratoacanthoma (KA). These lesions can be excised safely without the need for withholding the drug or reducing its dose. Mechanisms of resistance to vemurafenib do not involve development of secondary mutations in the BRAF kinase domain, but may be related to BRAF V600E over-amplification, bypassing mechanisms via upregulation and overexpression of other components in the MAPK signalling cascade or activation of alternative pathways with potential to enhance cell growth, proliferation and survival. Clinical trials to test the efficacy of vemurafenib in combination with immunomodulatory agents, such as ipilimumab, and MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitors, such as GDC-0973, in the treatment of advanced melanoma are currently underway. Also under investigation is the use of vemurafenib in other solid tumours with BRAF mutations, such as papillary thyroid cancer.",

Sorafenib became the first drug approved for this indication in more than two decades after a significant improvement in the progression-free survival was demonstrated. Lenvatinib (E-7080), an orally active inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) 1, 2 and 3, proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor Ret and mast/stem cell growth factor receptor Kit, yielded highly promising early clinical data, even when given after progression on first-line therapy.

The authors also provide some insight into the clinical use of sorafenib and look at important considerations for treatment.;Sorafenib significantly improves progression-free survival in metastatic DTC patients who are RAI-refractory. However, the overall survival benefit is still unproven and requires additional follow up.

On the other hand, the MAPK/ERK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway) and PI3K/Akt (lipid kinase phoshoinositid-3-kinase signaling pathway) play an important role in the transmission of cell signals. The genes, coding the signaling cascade proteins (RET, RAS, BRAF, PI3K, PTEN, AKT), are mutated or aberrantly expressed in thyroid cancer derived from follicular thyroid cells. Genetic and epigenetic alternations, concerning MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways, contribute to their activation and interaction as a consequence of malignant follicular cell transformation. The understanding of this molecular mechanism provides access to novel molecular prognostic and therapeutic strategies for inhibiting the oncogenic activity of the signaling pathways. This ability to investigate tumour biology allows for the selection of different drugs. Nowadays the most relevant are treatments directed to tyrosine kinase receptors that bind for a wide variety of ligands and are frequently mutated and induce a constitutive activation such that a chimerical protein expression takes place in follicular cells in the domain of RET, as well as in other receptors. Many molecules such as: motesanib, sorafenib, vandetanib, sunitinib, XL-184, imatinib, axitinib, pazopanib, lenvatinib, combretastatin, gefitinib, cetuximab, bortezomib and thiazoldonedione have been developed. Some of them also can act in receptors of vascular endothelial growth factor and epidermal growth factor receptors. Information obtained through cytological or biopsy samples permits the study of complex metabolic or genetic pathways, thus providing researchers with a high throughput tool for elucidating changes in the global expression patterns seen in tumour cells and allowing for different therapeutic strategies in thyroid cancer which take into account the predominant altered pathways observed in these samples.",

Its prevalence was also the same in subgroups identified according to the level of risk. The BRAF(V600E) mutation correlated with multifocality, aggressive variant, absence, or infiltration of the tumoral capsule. BRAF(V600E)-mutated PTC also required a higher number of radioiodine courses to obtain disease-free status. The BRAF(V600E) mutation was the only prognostic factor predicting the persistence of the disease in these patients after 5 yr of follow-up.;The BRAF(V600E) mutation was demonstrated to be a poor prognostic factor for the persistence of the disease independent from other clinical-pathological features in low-risk intrathyroid PTC patients. It could be useful to search for the BRAF(V600E) mutation in the workup of low-risk PTC patients to distinguish those who require less or more aggressive treatments. In particular, the high negative predictive value of the BRAF(V600E) mutation could be useful to identify, among low-risk PTC patients, those who could avoid 131-I treatment.",

Total thyroidectomy was performed in 143 patients (91.1%); central compartment (CC) node dissection (level VI) in 41 patients; central plus lateral compartment (LC) node dissection (levels II, III, and IV) in 82 patients. Subtotal thyroidectomy was initially performed in 14 cases: 10 of them were re-operated because of persistence of elevated serum calcitonin levels.;After a median post-surgical follow-up of 68 months (range 2-440 months), 42.9% of patients were living disease-free, 39.8% were living with disease, 3.1% were deceased due to causes different from MTC, and 3.2% were deceased due to MTC. The overall 10-year survival rate was 72%. At uni-variate statistical analysis (a) patient's age at initial treatment (>45 years; >/=45 years), (b) sporadic vs. hereditary MTC, (c) disease stage, and (d) the extent of surgical approach resulted as significant variables. Instead, at multivariate statistical analysis, only (a) patient's age at initial diagnosis, (b) disease stage, and (c) the extent of surgery resulted as significant and independent prognostic variables influencing survival.;The presence of lymph node and distant metastases at first diagnosis significantly worsened prognosis and survival rate in our series. Early diagnosis of MTC is very important, allowing complete surgical cure in Stages I and II patients. Due to the relatively bad prognosis of MTC, especially for disease Stages III and IV, it appears reasonable to recommend radical surgery including total thyroidectomy plus CC lymphoadenectomy as the treatment of choice, plus LC lymphoadenectomy in patients with palpable and/or ultrasound enlarged neck lymph nodes.",

The interval between NB treatment completion and PTC is usually more than 5 years. A 4-year-old, female patient with a high risk adrenal NB was found to have a 2.9-cm, right thyroid nodule on surveillance chest computed tomography (CT) 6 months after completion of her NB treatment (induction chemotherapy, tumor resection, autologous stem cell transplantation, external beam radiation to the abdominal tumor site, immunotherapy, and retinoic acid). Posttreatment surveillance included iodine-123-metaiodobenzylguanidine scans and CT scans. Fine-needle aspiration of the thyroid nodule diagnosed a follicular neoplasm, which was negative for BRAF, NRAS, KRAS, HRAS, PAX8/PPARg, and RET/PTC mutations, without evidence of metastatic NB. Nodule histology demonstrated an encapsulated follicular variant of PTC (FVPTC). Next-generation sequence analysis for a 46 cancer-gene profile was performed on both tumors with subsequent peripheral blood DNA testing. A heterozygous missense mutation in STK11 (F354L) was identified in both the NB and FVPTC. This mutation was also detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Two additional heterozygous somatic missense mutations of uncertain significance were identified: KDR/VEGF receptor 2 (Q472H) on chromosome 4 and MET (N375S) on chromosome 7. To our knowledge, this is the shortest reported duration from completion of NB treatment to detection of thyroid cancer. The association of the STK11 gene with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, lung adenocarcinomas, and medullary thyroid cancer leads to a possible association between this genetic variant and our patient's tumors.

The BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib has demonstrated clinical efficacy in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant melanoma brain metastases and in other cancer diseases. Therefore the BRAF V600E mutation is a highly interesting oncological target in brain tumors.;This study assesses the BRAF V600E mutation status in 969 intracranial neoplasms using a tissue microarray method and immunohistochemical staining with the mutation-specific VE-1 antibody, followed by sequencing of positively stained cases.;Out of 784 primary brain tumors seven cases with a BRAF V600E mutation were detected (7/784, 1 %). Six of these cases were neuroepithelial tumors (6/667, 1 %) encompassing 2 astrocytomas WHO grade II (2/42, 5 %), 1 gliosarcoma WHO grade IV (1/75, 1 %) and 3 glioblastomas WHO grade IV (3/312, 1 %). Interestingly, all three mutant glioblastomas showed epithelioid histopathological features. Patients with V600E mutated astrocytic tumors were significantly younger (mean age 15.3 years) than wildtype cases (58.2 years). Among three rhabdoid meningiomas, one case was mutated (1/3) while all other grade I-III meningiomas (1/116, 1 %) and all fifty vestibular schwannomas analyzed were of wildtype status. The vast majority of the BRAF V600E mutations were found in cerebral metastases of malignant melanomas and carcinomas (29/135, 22 %), with false-positive staining found in four breast cancer cases and two non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) samples.;Our data suggest routine screening for BRAF V600E mutations for glioblastomas WHO grade IV below the age of 30, especially in glioblastomas with epithelioid features and in all rhabdoid meningiomas WHO grade III. For colorectal carcinoma, thyroid cancer, malignant melanoma and gliomas BRAF V600E immunostaining is sufficient for screening purposes. We also recommend routine immunohistochemical staining followed by sequencing validation in rare CNS metastases or metastases of unknown primary. Immunohistochemical analysis using mutation-specific antibodies on tissue microarrays is a feasible, time- and cost-efficient approach to high-throughput screening for specific mutations in large tumor series but sequencing validation is necessary in unexpected cases.",

Thyroid cancer frequently exhibits activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. In other types of cancer, paradoxical ERK activation has emerged as a potential resistance mechanism to RAF-inhibiting drugs including MKIs such as sorafenib and pazopanib. We therefore queried whether the MEK inhibitor trametinib, could augment the activity of pazopanib in thyroid cancer cell lines. Trametinib potently inhibited growth in vitro (GI50 1.1-4.8 nM), whereas pazopanib had more limited in vitro activity, as anticipated (GI50 1.4-7.1 µM). We observed progressive upregulation of ERK activity with pazopanib treatment, an effect abrogated by trametinib. For xenografts (bearing either KRASG12R or BRAFV600E mutations), the combination of trametinib and pazopanib led to sustained shrinkage in tumor volume by 50% or more, compared to pre-treatment baseline. Trametinib also was highly effective as a single agent, compared to pazopanib alone. These preclinical findings support the evaluation of trametinib, alone or in combination with pazopanib or other kinase inhibitors, in thyroid cancer clinical trials. We highlight the importance of pharmacodynamic assessment of the ERK pathway for patients enrolled in trials involving MKIs. ",

A19 year-old female had been referred due to thyroid disease that disclosed features characteristic of a RTH. During the follow up it was detected a follicular tumor that led to the recommendation for thyroid surgical ablation, where an incidental papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (mPTC) was found. The increase of thyroglobulin (TG) levels following thyroid removal referred the patient for radioiodine treatment. Post-treatment, it was detected jugular adenopathies and the patient was subjected to cervical lymph node drainage where metastases of the mPTC were found. RTH syndrome was confirmed by the detection of a THRB germline mutation. A BRAF mutation was also found in the mPTC but not detected in the follicular adenoma or normal adjacent tissue. The young age of the patient, the rarity of BRAF mutations in childhood and the high dissemination of the malignancy, lead us to the speculation that increased TSH stimulation in a RTH background and oncogenic activation of BRAF could have served as (co) drivers and might have triggered an advanced stage of the neoplastic disease.

It is indeed now known that BRAF and RAS mutations and RET/PTC and PAX8/PPARγ rearrangements account for the majority of molecular alterations detected in differentiated thyroid cancers. Abnormal regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is also a promising way of research. The diagnostic utility and prognostic value of detecting these molecular events has been analyzed in several recent studies. BRAF mutation analysis improves the performance of fine-needle aspiration diagnosis by increasing specificity in \"indeterminate\" cytologies and sensitivity in false negatives. Testing for a \"panel of mutations\" (BRAF, RAS, RET/PTC and PAX8/PPARγ) improves the performance, detecting papillary carcinomas with non-classic histology. The specificity of these analyzes is excellent but their sensitivity is still insufficient. In the future, specific miRNAs expression profiles in thyroid carcinoma and identification of new mutations might provide interesting information. Several studies have found that BRAF mutations are associated with a more aggressive tumor behavior, a higher risk of recurrence and treatment failure. With regard to the other mutations and rearrangements, current data are conflicting and it seems premature to draw practical conclusions applicable in routine practice. Lastly, targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, based on our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of thyroid oncogenesis, has shown promise in metastatic, progressive, and radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid carcinomas.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Therapy of thyroid cancers is based on the removal of the primary disease by surgery, replacement of the hormonal deficiencies and subsequent therapy of the recurrent and metastatic disease. The metabolic characteristics of many thyroid tumors mean that radionuclide techniques have been used in the identification of sites of tumour and their subsequent therapy. Differentiated thyroid cancers, papillary, follicular and mixed papillary follicular, are treated by surgery--usually a total or subtotal thyroidectomy. Postoperatively, patients have thyroxine as a replacement therapy and to suppress thyroid-stimulating hormone production. Radioiodine therapy is often given to ablate the thyroid remnant. This allows (a) adequate follow-up of patients using thyroglobulin measurements and assessment scans as necessary, and (b) further therapy with radioiodine for metastatic disease. Patients with a short effective half-life of radioiodide may require higher activities or pharmacological methods of prolonging the retention half-times of iodine. The use of chemotherapy in this group of tumors is limited and at best provides palliation. The overall prognosis is good for differentiated thyroid cancer; papillary carcinomas have an 80 to 90% 10-year survival, whereas follicular tumors are associated with a 65 to 75% 10-year survival. Medullary carcinomas may be sporadic or familial, and some of the latter form part of a multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome (MEN). Primary treatment is surgery, and total thyroidectomy is usually recommended since tumours are often multifocal. The use of radiolabelled metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) and 111In octreotide as potential therapeutic agents has been explored and may be potentially useful in palliative care. Chemotherapy is of limited benefit. The 10-year survival for medullary carcinomas is 60 to 70%. Anaplastic tumours of the thyroid are usually aggressive, with a high mortality. Treatment is palliative by surgical debulking; some patients may benefit from local radiotherapy or occasionally chemotherapy. The use of therapeutic doses of radionuclides is well tolerated, although it may be associated with a variety of mostly transient adverse effects, including gastritis, thyroiditis and sialadenitis. Therapy with high activities of radioiodine require radiation protection precautions. Despite retreatment with radioiodine there appear to be no long term effects on the fertility of patients, and healthy children are born to women receiving this treatment. 131I remains perhaps the most specific cancer therapy available today and has few adverse effects.

        "Doc_abstract":"The central role of the BRAF-MEK-ERK pathway in controlling cell fate has made this pathway a primary target for deregulated activation in cancer. BRaf is activated by Ras proteins allowing Ras oncogenes to constitutively activate the pathway. Activating BRaf mutations are also frequent in several cancers, being the most common oncogenic mutation in thyroid carcinoma and melanoma. There are currently two inhibitors, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, approved for treatment of malignant melanoma having activating BRaf mutations. Concurrent administration of BRAF and MAP-ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor (trametinib) is significantly more active in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma than either single agent alone, but progression to resistance ultimately occurs by different mechanisms that increase the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Such adaptive changes in tumor cell signaling networks allow bypass of targeted oncoprotein inhibition. This is true with targeted inhibitors for BRaf and MEK as well as specific inhibitors for AKT, mTOR, and many receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGF receptor (EGFR) and HER2. It is this adaptive response to targeted kinase inhibitors that contributes to the failure of single-agent kinase inhibitors to have durable responses. This failure is seen in virtually all cancers treated with single-agent kinase inhibitors, most of which are not as dependent on a single signaling pathway such as BRaf-MEK-ERK in melanoma. Thus, understanding the breadth of adaptive reprogramming responses to specific targeted kinase inhibition will be critical to develop appropriate combination therapies for durable clinical responses.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The RAS-RAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway is a key signal transduction pathway in the cells. Critically, it remains constitutively active in approximately 30% of human cancers, having key roles in cancer development, maintenance and progression, while being responsible for poorer prognosis and drug resistance. Consequently, the inhibition of this pathway has been the subject of intense research for >25 years. The advent of better patient screening techniques has increasingly shown that upstream regulators like RAS and RAF remain persistently mutated in many cancer types. These gain-of-function mutations, such as KRAS-4B(G12V/G13D/Q61K), NRAS(Q61L/Q61R) or BRAF(V600E), lead to tremendous increase in their activities, resulting in constitutively active extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). They were not efficiently targeted by the first-generation inhibitors such as Lonafarnib or Sorafenib, which were essentially broad spectrum inhibitors targeting pan-RAS and pan-RAF, respectively. This triggered the development of the second-generation inhibitors selective against the mutated proteins. Second generation inhibitors such as Vemurafenib (Zelboraf) and Dabrafenib (Tafinlar) targeting BRAF(V600E), Trametinib (Mekinist) targeting MEK1/2 and the first generation pan-RAF inhibitor Sorafenib (Nexavar) have already been approved for treating renal, hepatocellular, thyroid cancers and BRAF(V600E/K) harboring metastatic melanoma. Others against RAF and MEK1/2 are presently undergoing clinical trials. Their success would depend on the better understanding of the acquired resistance mechanisms to these drugs in the cancer cells and the identification of predictive biomarkers for the proper administration of suitable inhibitor(s).

The usefulness and feasibility of an intraoperative PET probe have been reported for many other cancers; however, a standard, radioguided, operative protocol using a PET probe in thyroid cancer has not been established. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the feasibility of an intraoperative PET probe with respect to precise tumor localization, verification of complete resection, and a decrease in unnecessary reoperations and complications.;This was a prospective, controlled study. Inclusion criteria were thyroid cancer requiring a total thyroidectomy with a modified radical neck dissection (MRND) and recurrent thyroid cancer after thyroid surgery. The types of procedures included total thyroidectomy with MRND, selective neck dissection (SND), and excision of recurrent thyroid masses. The PET probe NodeSeeker(®) is a high-energy gamma probe seeking 511 keV photons. Operative exploration was carried out between 2 and 6 h after injection of (18)F-FDG. The surgeon calculated the target-to-background ratio (T/B ratio) by checking the 10-sec accumulated count using the PET probe. We performed a re-exploration if the T/B ratio was >1.3 in the operative bed.;Twelve patients underwent PET probe-guided operation. SNDs, mass excisions, total thyroidectomy with MRND, and MRND were performed on 7, 4, and 1 patient, respectively. All tumors were localized by the PET probe precisely in real time, and the lesions not observed on preoperative PET were detected by the PET probe in 7 patients. Furthermore, additional lymph nodes that were not identified on preoperative ultrasonography were detected in 1 patient. The mean T/B ratio of thyroid carcinoma was 1.51 ± 0.53 (range, 1.17-4.03) and the postoperative serum thyroglobulin off thyroid hormone was <2.0 ng/ml.;Radioguided surgery using an intraoperative PET probe in thyroid cancer appears to be a useful method for real-time tumor localization, verification of complete excision, and minimization of the possibility of residual cancer. Therefore, an intraoperative PET probe in thyroid cancer may decrease unnecessary reoperations and complications due to persistent disease.",

Secondary neck dissections for delayed metastases were performed in 14 patients who had previously undergone thyroidectomy for confirmed PTC. All 32 patients had positive nodes in at least one level. Our results highlight the high incidence of multilevel cervical metastasis associated with PTC and suggest the importance of including level II-B (submuscular recess) when performing a neck dissection; the upper posterior triangle (level V-A) is less likely to harbor occult tumor.

In the EU and USA, lenvatinib is indicated for the treatment of locally recurrent or metastatic progressive, radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RR-DTC). This approval was based on the results of the randomized, double-blind, multinational, phase 3 SELECT study, in which lenvatinib significantly improved median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate compared with placebo in patients with RR-DTC. The PFS benefit with lenvatinib was seen in all pre-specified subgroups, including patients who had received either one or no prior VEGF-targeted therapy. Moreover, the PFS benefit with lenvatinib was maintained regardless of BRAF or RAS mutation status. The safety and tolerability profile of lenvatinib in SELECT was consistent with that of other VEGF/VEGF receptor-targeted therapies and was mostly manageable. Hypertension was the most common treatment-related adverse event in lenvatinib-treated patients, but only infrequently led to discontinuation of the drug. Although not collected in SELECT, information on quality of life would be useful in assessing the overall impact of therapy on the patient. This notwithstanding, the data which are available indicate that lenvatinib is an effective and generally well-tolerated treatment option for patients with RR-DTC.

        "Doc_abstract":"Papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) are the most common type of thyroid malignancy with one of the two mutations, RET/PTC rearrangement or BRAF mutation. Both mutations are able to activate the MEK/ERK signaling transduction pathway and result in the activation of transcription factors that regulate cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Sorafenib (Nexavar, BAY 43-9006) is a multikinase inhibitor, and in this study, we tested its effects on PTC cells carrying either mutation.;The effects of sorafenib on cell proliferation and signaling were evaluated in vitro on PTC cells using growth curves, cell cycle analysis, and immunoblotting. Using an orthotopic mouse model, we determined the antitumor effects of sorafenib in vivo.;The concentration needed for 50% growth inhibition (GI(50)) by sorafenib was 0.14 mumol/L for the PTC cells with the RET/PTC1 rearrangement, and 2.5 mumol/L for PTC cells with a BRAF mutation, both readily achievable serum concentrations. After 3 weeks of oral administration of sorafenib (80 mg/kg/d) in mice, small (94% reduction compared with controls) or no tumor growth was detected in mice inoculated with PTC cells bearing the RET/PTC1 rearrangement, whereas the tumor volume of the orthotopic tumor implants of PTC cells with a BRAF mutation was reduced 53% to 54% (as compared with controls).;PTC cells carrying the RET/PTC1 rearrangement were more sensitive to sorafenib than PTC cells carrying a BRAF mutation. Because RET/PTC rearrangements are unique to thyroid carcinomas, our findings support the clinical evaluation of sorafenib for patients with PTC and the identification of patients most likely to respond to sorafenib treatment.",

However, until now, rearrangements have only been detected in fresh FNA material and the number of follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTCs) was rather low in previous studies. We aimed at investigating the impact of point mutations and rearrangement detection in a set of routine air-dried FNA smears with a higher percentage of FTCs.;RNA and DNA was extracted from 310 FNAs (164 indeterminate, 57 malignant, 89 benign) and corresponding formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (156 follicular adenomas [FAs], 32 FTCs, 44 papillary thyroid carcinomas [PTCs], 9 follicular variant PTCs, and 69 goiters). PAX8/PPARG and RET/PTC rearrangements were detected by qPCR, BRAF and RAS mutations by high-resolution melting PCR and by pyrosequencing.;Forty-seven mutations were detected in the FNAs: 22 BRAF, 13 NRAS, and 3 HRAS mutations, 8 PAX8/PPARG, and one RET/PTC-rearrangement. While the presence of a BRAF and RET/PTC mutation was associated with cancer in 100% of samples each, the presence of a RAS and PAX8/PPARG mutation was associated with cancer in only 12% and 50% of samples, respectively. In the indeterminate group 4 of 25 carcinomas were identified by molecular FNA screening, which increased the sensitivity from 67% (cytology alone) to 75% (cytology plus molecular screening).;Molecular screening for point mutations and rearrangements is feasible in air-dried FNAs. Although the impact of detecting point mutations and rearrangements in FNAs has most likely been overestimated in previous studies, molecular FNA analyses improve presurgical diagnostics. The detection of BRAF mutations in FNA may improve the choice of surgery and postsurgical treatment. Further data are necessary to elucidate the true impact of detecting RAS and PAX8/PPARG mutations in FNAs. The inclusion of additional rare somatic mutations and miRNA markers might further improve the impact of molecular FNA diagnostics.",

Although BRAF(V600E) inhibitors are available, lack of response has been frequently observed. To study the mechanism underlying intrinsic resistance to the mutant BRAF(V600E) selective inhibitor vemurafenib, we established short-term primary cell cultures of human metastatic/recurrent BRAF(V600E)-PTC, intrathyroidal BRAF(V600E)-PTC, and normal thyroid (NT). We also generated an early intervention model of human BRAF(V600E)-PTC orthotopic mouse. We find that metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cells elicit paracrine-signaling which trigger migration of pericytes, blood endothelial cells and lymphatic endothelial cells as compared to BRAF(WT)-PTC cells, and show a higher rate of invasion. We further show that vemurafenib therapy significantly suppresses these aberrant functions in non-metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cells but lesser in metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cells as compared to vehicle treatment. These results concur with similar folds of down-regulation of tumor microenvironment-associated pro-metastatic molecules, with no effects in BRAF(WT)-PTC and NT cells. Our early intervention preclinical trial shows that vemurafenib delays tumor growth in the orthotopic BRAF(WT/V600E)-PTC mice. Importantly, we identify high copy number gain of MCL1 (chromosome 1q) and loss of CDKN2A (P16, chromosome 9p) in metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cells which are associated with resistance to vemurafenib treatment. Critically, we demonstrate that combined vemurafenib therapy with BCL2/MCL1 inhibitor increases metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cell death and ameliorates response to vemurafenib treatment as compared to single agent treatment. In conclusion, short-term PTC and NT cultures offer a predictive model for evaluating therapeutic response in patients with PTC. Our PTC pre-clinical model suggests that combined targeted therapy might be an important therapeutic strategy for metastatic and refractory BRAF(V600E)-positive PTC.",

Our aim was to assess clinico-pathological and prognostic correlations of these PTC-specific gene alterations, with a particular emphasis on the BRAF mutation, in a group of 266 Serbian PTC patients, for the first time. The reference center-based retrospective cohort included 201 (75.6%) females and 65 (24.4%) males aged 48.0±16.1 years (8-83 years old, range) diagnosed and treated for PTC during 1993-2008. Follow-up period was 53.1±41.6 months (7-187 months, range). BRAF and RAS mutations were determined by direct sequencing of genomic DNA. RET/PTC rearrangements were analyzed by RT-PCR/Southern blotting. Genetic alterations were detected in 150/266 tumors (56.4%). One tumor displayed two genetic alterations. The BRAF(V600E) was found in 84/266 (31.6%) cases, RAS mutations in 11/266 (4.1%) and RET/PTC in 55/266 (20.7%; 42/266 (15.8%) RET/PTC1 and 13/266 (4.9%) RET/PTC3). On multivariate analysis BRAF(V600E) was associated with the classical papillary morphology (P = 0.05), the higher pT category (P = 0.05) and advanced clinical stage (P = 0.03). In a proportional hazard model, BRAF(V600E) did not appear to be an independent risk factor for the faster recurrence (P = 0.784). We conclude that under the extensive thyroid surgery and limited application of radioiodine ablation BRAF(V600E) may not be an indicator of poorer disease-free survival during the short to middle follow-up period.

The use of TKIs as a form of molecular targeted therapy is evolving based on understanding of the pathways involved in DTC. Disrupting tumor vascular supply by targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor signaling is the most commonly used approach to treat advanced/metastatic DTC. Other mechanisms include targeting BRAF, MAPK/ERK kinase, or mammalian target of rapamycin signaling.

Low Mig-6 expression in PTC specimens was associated with low NF-κB activity but high levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ERK phosphorylation. Mig-6 expression inversely correlated with PTC size but had no association with other clinicopathological variables including age, extrathyroidal extension, lymphovascular invasion, or histological subtype. Mig-6 knockdown in thyroid cancer cell lines resulted in EGFR phosphorylation and diminished NF-κB activity, whereas Mig-6 overexpression had the opposite effects. Mig-6 knockdown activated ErbB2, Met, and Src phosphorylation. Furthermore, Mig-6 regulated ERK phosphorylation independent from its effects on EGFR.

BRAF mutations were mandatory for inclusion later in the study because of an absence of activity in patients with wild-type BRAF. We used an accelerated dose titration method, with the first dose cohort receiving 12 mg dabrafenib daily in a 21-day cycle. Once doses had been established, we expanded the cohorts to include up to 20 patients. On the basis of initial data, we chose a recommended phase 2 dose. Efficacy at the recommended phase 2 dose was studied in patients with BRAF-mutant tumours, including those with non-Val600Glu mutations, in three cohorts: metastatic melanoma, melanoma with untreated brain metastases, and non-melanoma solid tumours. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00880321.;We enrolled 184 patients, of whom 156 had metastatic melanoma. The most common treatment-related adverse events of grade 2 or worse were cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma (20 patients, 11%), fatigue (14, 8%), and pyrexia (11, 6%). Dose reductions were necessary in 13 (7%) patients. No deaths or discontinuations resulted from adverse events, and 140 (76%) patients had no treatment-related adverse events worse than grade 2. Doses were increased to 300 mg twice daily, with no maximum tolerated dose recorded. On the basis of safety, pharmacokinetic, and response data, we selected a recommended phase 2 dose of 150 mg twice daily. At the recommended phase 2 dose in 36 patients with Val600 BRAF-mutant melanoma, responses were reported in 25 (69%, 95% CI 51·9-83·7) and confirmed responses in 18 (50%, 32·9-67·1). 21 (78%, 57·7-91·4) of 27 patients with Val600Glu BRAF-mutant melanoma responded and 15 (56%, 35·3-74·5) had a confirmed response. In Val600 BRAF-mutant melanoma, responses were durable, with 17 patients (47%) on treatment for more than 6 months. Responses were recorded in patients with non-Val600Glu BRAF mutations. In patients with melanoma and untreated brain metastases, nine of ten patients had reductions in size of brain lesions. In 28 patients with BRAF-mutant non-melanoma solid tumours, apparent antitumour activity was noted in a gastrointestinal stromal tumour, papillary thyroid cancers, non-small-cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and colorectal cancer.;Dabrafenib is safe in patients with solid tumours, and an active inhibitor of Val600-mutant BRAF with responses noted in patients with melanoma, brain metastases, and other solid tumours.;GlaxoSmithKline.",

From the viewpoint of patient management, the areas where it has made significant impact include the following: (1) the detection of disease focus in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma with elevated Tg levels and negative radioiodine scan. When localized disease is identified with F-18 FDG-PET-CT, surgery or focused radiotherapy could be utilized to eradicate the tumor; (2) the localization of disease in patients of MTC with elevated serum calcitonin levels; (3) the detection of unsuspected focal F-18 FDG uptake in the thyroid in patients undergoing whole body F-18 FDG PET for a different indication. This would prompt a workup to rule out thyroid carcinoma. The use of I-124 is evolving at this time and has been of great promise with regard to (a) its better efficacy of lesion detection and (b) the ability to provide lesion-specific dosimetry. In addition, F-18 FDG PET appears to be of potential value in patients with thyroid lymphoma in making the initial diagnosis, monitoring therapeutic response, and assessing for residual disease and/or recurrence.",

All 2464 patients were offered a thyroidectomy, and DNA was extracted from the atypical cells in the surgical specimens for detection of the BRAF (V600E) mutation. Clinical and pathological characteristics were also investigated.;Four hundred and fifty-two of 1945 (23.2%) patients were diagnosed with HT, and of these, 119 (72.1%) had a BRAF (V600E) mutation. HT was not significantly associated with the BRAF (V600E) mutation (P < 0.001) and extrathyroidal extensions (P = 0.005) but was associated with a low stage (P = 0.011) and female predominance (P < 0.001). In a subgroup analysis for gender, HT was associated with a low probability of BRAF (V600E) mutations in both genders (P < 0.001 for both females and males). Also, recurrence was significantly associated with HT (OR 0.297, CI 0.099-0.890, P = 0.030), lymph node ratio (OR 2.545, CI 1.092-5.931, P = 0.030), and BRAF (V600E) mutation (OR 2.075, CI 1.021-4.217, P = 0.044). However, there was no relationship with clinicopathological factors or with death.;Our results show that HT in patients with PTC is associated with a low probability of BRAF (V600E) mutations.

Although partially effective in most cases, it can render a complete cure only in a limited number of patients. One way to enhance its efficacy would be to combine it with antineoplastic agents. Here we describe an initial in vitro evaluation with 4 thyroid cancer cell lines.;Cells were sparsely seeded in microtiter plates and allowed to grow for 2 days; then they were exposed to sublethal concentrations of cisplatin (CDDP), doxorubicin (Dox), or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), followed by treatment with I-131 for 48 hr. Cell survival was measured with a commercial kit based on the colorimetry of succinate dehydrogenase activity.;Chemotherapeutic drugs exerted similar concentration-dependent cytotoxic effects in all 4 cell lines. The doses necessary to reduce the surviving fraction to half of the control were about 3 microg/ml for CDDP, 0.3 microg/ml for Dox, and 3 microg/ml for 5-FU (when used continuously for 48 hours). On the other hand, sensitivity to I-131 irradiation differed among the lines; same doses (7.4-14.8 MBq/ml) caused the greatest damage in FRO cells, a modest effect in NPA and WRO, and only minimal change in B-CPAP. The combined effect was most demonstrable in wells treated with Dox and radioiodine, whereas the addition of CDDP or 5-FU had marginal or insignificant merit, respectively. In FRO cells, half-lethal doses of the above mentioned CDDP, Dox, and 5-FU, when used together with 14.8 MBq/ml I-131, reduced cell survival to 54.5%, 29.4% and 33.4%, respectively, vs. 60.2% with radioiodine alone.;In vitro, clinical concentrations of Dox can accelerate the killing of thyroid cancer cells by radioiodine.

This case is remarkable in being an unusual report of a follicular Hürthle cell carcinoma harboring the BRAF V600E mutation and occurring in collision with multifocal papillary carcinoma. Documentation of such cases is important as it helps better understand the pathogenesis, clinical behavior, and radiologic findings of such rare lesions and to determine the optimal treatment modalities.

        "Doc_abstract":"Thyroid nodules occur in 1-2% of children, and identifying which nodules are malignant is often challenging. Cytologic evaluation facilitates the diagnosis of thyroid lesions (TLs), but in 10-40% of cases the interpretation is indeterminate. Patients with indeterminate diagnoses are often treated with hemithyroidectomy followed by completion thyroidectomy, if cancer is found in the initial specimen. Exposing patients to multiple surgeries increases costs and morbidity. The American Thyroid Association states that a combination of molecular markers is likely to optimize the management of patients with indeterminate cytology. However, few studies have addressed the molecular alterations present in pediatric TL. Twenty-seven thyroid carcinomas from patients 10 to 19 years of age were tested for alterations common in adult TL, including BRAF V600E mutation, RET fusions, and TERT promoter mutations. Mutation-negative cases were subsequently analyzed with a next-generation sequencing (NGS) mutation panel to search for additional targets. Histologic diagnoses included 12 classic papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs), 13 follicular variant PTCs, 1 medullary thyroid carcinoma, and 1 follicular carcinoma. Fourteen cases showed lymph node involvement, and 13 cases demonstrated lymphovascular invasion. The BRAF V600E mutation was detected in 10/27 cases, and RET fusions were detected in 6/27 cases. No TERT promoter mutations were identified in any of the cases. The NGS panel revealed additional RET and CTNNB1 pathogenic missense mutations. Our results demonstrate that molecular abnormalities are common in pediatric TLs and suggest that incorporation of molecular testing will be helpful in optimizing patient management. ",

The identification of the exact SCN type required the distinction of the cystic and solid pattern; SCNs were usually composed of a mixture of main cells (MCs) and C-cells (CCs). The immunohistochemical calcitonin stain identified CCs easily, both inside SCNs and dispersed in islets at the periphery. For the characterization of MCs, we added the utility of p40 to p63. The use of thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) helped in their identification, as MCs did not react with this marker; the combination of TTF-1 and p40 or p63 IHC stains was useful for the characterization of cystic SCNs of both types 3 and 4. The negativity of mouse monoclonal mesothelioma antibody (HMBE-1) and a very low proliferative index (MIB-1) supported the diagnosis. [Correction added on 23 November 2015, after online publication: MIB-1 was incorrectly defined, the expanded form was deleted.] We discourage the use of galectin-3 (Gal-3) and cytokeratin-19 (CK-19), as they have an important overlap with papillary thyroid carcinoma.

All 7 patients were thyroidectomised and radioiodine ablated and all had detectable [> 1 ng/ml] basal serum thyroglobulin (b-Tg) levels. Thyrogen stimulation resulted in a rise of Tg (s-Tg) in all patients. Five patients had negative whole body scanning (WBS) and no clinical or radiological signs of disease. Two patients with a b-Tg value of 5 ng/ml and 11 ng/ml, respectively showed a s-Tg of 17 ng/ml and 84 ng/ml, respectively, whereas WBS was negative. Both of these patients received 100 mCi (3700 MBq) 131I. Owo patients had a positive Tg and positive WBS with skull, lung and hepatic metastases and received 150 131I after preparation with Thyrogen. Six months later one of these patients was free of disease and the other will be evaluated during the coming months.

Pancreatic metastases from PTC usually remain asymptomatic or manifest as repeated abdominal aches. Associated obstructive jaundice is rare. Prognosis is variable with reported median survival from 16 to 46 months. Case Presentation. Herein we present a 67-year-old Saudi woman, who developed pancreatic metastases seven years after total thyroidectomy and neck dissection followed by radioactive iodine ablation (RAI) for FV-PTC. Metastasectomy was performed by pancreaticoduodenectomy followed by sorafenib as genetic testing revealed a BRAF V600E mutation. She survived 32 months after the pancreatic metastasis diagnosis.

The major inclusion criterion was the presence of a radioiodine-positive LNR after previous total thyroidectomy and at least two ineffective (131)I treatments. The protocol was designed as follows: Day 0--all patients were hospitalized and received 3.7 GBq of (131) I while clinically hypothyroid. Day 3--pre-surgery whole-body scan with a therapeutic (131)I dose (TxWBS) was acquired. Day 5--neck surgery using a gamma probe (Navigator GPS, AutoSuture, Italy), recording the absolute counts and the lesion/background (L/B) counts ratio was performed. Day 7--post-surgery TxWBS was performed using the remaining radioactivity.;This protocol permitted us to identify neoplastic foci with high sensitivity and specificity, enabling us to remove lymph node metastases resistant to radioiodine therapy in a single session.

Targeting RET, therefore, might be useful in tailoring surveillance of MTC patients. Here we showed that theaflavins, the bioactive components of black tea, successfully induced apoptosis in human MTC cell line, TT, by inversely modulating two molecular pathways: (i) stalling PI3K/Akt/Bad pathway that resulted in mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTP) loss, cytochrome-c release and activation of the executioner caspases-9 and -3, and (ii) upholding p38MAPK/caspase-8/caspase-3 pathway via inhibition of Ras/Raf/ERK. Over-expression of either constitutively active myristoylated-Akt-cDNA (Myr-Akt-cDNA) or dominant-negative-caspase-8-cDNA (Dn-caspase-8-cDNA) partially blocked theaflavin-induced apoptosis, while co-transfection of Myr-Akt-cDNA and Dn-caspase-8-cDNA completely eradicated the effect of theaflavins thereby negating the possibility of existence of other pathways. A search for the upstream signaling revealed that theaflavin-induced disruption of lipid raft caused interference in anchorage of RET in lipid raft that in turn stalled phosphorylation of Ras and PI3Kinase. In such anti-survival cellular micro-environment, pro-apoptotic signals were triggered to culminate into programmed death of MTC cell. These findings not only unveil a hitherto unexplained mechanism underlying theaflavin-induced MTC death, but also validate RET as a promising and potential target for MTC therapy.",

Lower CCDC67 expression was significantly associated with aggressive tumor behaviors, such as advanced tumor stages and lymph node metastasis, as well as BRAF mutation. Introduced expression of CCDC67 in TPC-1 cells robustly inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation and migration, induced G1 phase cell cycle arrest, and increased cell apoptosis.;Primary PTC tumors and matched normal thyroid tissues were obtained from 200 unselected patients at the initial surgery for detection of CCDC67 mRNA and protein by RT-PCR and Western blotting analyses, respectively. Genomic DNA sequencing was performed to detect BRAF mutation in PTC tumors. Clinicopathological data were retrospectively reviewed for correlation analyses. PTC cell line TPC-1 with stable transfection of CCDC67 was used to investigate the functions of CCDC67.;This large study demonstrates down-regulation of CCDC67 in PTC, an inverse relationship between CCDC67 expression and PTC aggressiveness and BRAF mutation, and a robust inhibitory effect of CCDC67 on PTC cellular activities.

The BRAFV600E mutation was correlated with older age, classical variant of PTC, advanced stages in patients > 45 years.;BRAFV600E testing could play a role in improving the diagnostic accuracy of FNAB for PTC, representing a useful adjuvant tool in presurgical characterization of thyroid nodes in particular cases. There is an association between the BRAFV600E mutation and some clinico-pathological characteristics of PTC.",

We aimed to describe molecular markers in DTC that correlate with clinical outcome to axitinib. Pretreatment thyroid cancer blocks from 18 patients treated with axitinib were collected and genomic DNA was isolated. The OncoCarta™ Mutation Panel was used to test for 238 oncogenic mutations. Copy number of VEGFR1-3 and PIK3CA was determined using qPCR on enriched tumor samples. Genomic DNA was analyzed for all coding regions of VEGFR1-3 with custom primers. Protein expressions of VEGFR1-3, c-Met, and PIK3CA were evaluated with immunohistochemistry. Clinical response to axitinib, including best response (BR) and progression free survival (PFS), was ascertained from corresponding patients. Fisher's exact test and logistic regression models were used to correlate BR with molecular findings. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to correlate PFS with molecular defects. A total of 22 pathology samples (10 primary, 12 metastatic) were identified. In patients with 2 samples (n = 4), genetic results were concordant and only included once for analysis. Tumors from 4 patients (22%) harbored BRAF V600E mutations, 2 (11%) had KRAS mutations (G12A, G13D) and 2 (11%) had HRAS mutations (Q61R, Q61K). One metastatic sample with mutated KRAS also harbored a PIK3CA (H1047R) mutation. qPCR showed increased copy numbers of PIK3CA in 6 (33%) tumors, VEGFR1 in 0 (0%) tumors, VEGFR2 in 4 (22%) tumors, and VEGFR3 in 6 (33%) tumors. VEGFR sequencing was significant for a possibly damaging non-synonymous SNP in VEGFR2 (G539R) in 2 samples (11%), a possibly damaging SNP in VEGFR3 (E350V) in 1 sample (6%), and a potentially novel mutation in VEGFR2 (T439I) in 2 samples (11%). Immunohistochemistry (VEGFR1, -2, -3; c-MET; PIK3CA) revealed positive staining in the majority of samples. No significant relationship was seen between BR or PFS and the presence of molecular alterations. Molecular evaluation of DTC specimens did not predict clinical response to axitinib but our data were limited by sample size. We did identify molecular changes in VEGFR that should be further explored. While DTC is genetically heterogeneous, primary and metastatic lesions showed identical oncogenic alterations in four cases. ",

Our objective was to analyze ETE at the molecular and histologic levels and assess the effect of its extent on outcome.;All cases of TC with ETE but without nodal metastases at presentation (NMP) were identified over a 20-year period and grouped into gross and METE. Twelve papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) without ETE and NMP were also analyzed. Cases with paraffin tissues were subjected to mass spectrometry genotyping encompassing the most significant oncogenes in TC: 111 mutations in RET, BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, KRAS, PIK3CA, and AKT1, and other related genes were surveyed.;Eighty-one (10%) of 829 patients in the database had ETE and no NMP. There was a much higher frequency of poorly differentiated and anaplastic carcinomas (12/29, 41%) in patients with gross ETE than in those with METE (3/52, 6%) (p < 0.01). There was a higher disease-specific survival (DSS) in patients with METE than in those with gross ETE (p < 0.0001). Except for an anaplastic case, no recurrences were detected in 45 patients with METE, including 23 PTC patients followed up for a median of 10 years without radioactive iodine therapy. Within patients with gross invasion into trachea/esophagus, tumors with high mitotic activity and/or tumor necrosis correlated with worse DSS (p < 0.05). Fifty-six cases with ETE were genotyped as follows: BRAFV600E, 39 (70%); BRAFV600E-AKT1, 1 (1.8%); NRAS, 1 (1.8%); KRAS, 1 (1.8%); RET/PTC, 3 (5%); wild type, 11 (19.6%). Within PTCs, BRAF positivity rate increased the risk of ETE (p = 0.01). If PTC follicular variants are excluded, BRAF positivity does not correlate with ETE status within classical/tall cell PTC.;(i) PTCs with METE without NMP have an extremely low recurrence rate in contrast to tumors with gross ETE. (ii) High mitotic activity and/or tumor necrosis confers worse DSS even in patients stratified for gross ETE in trachea/esophagus. (iii) BRAF positivity correlates with the presence of ETE in PTC, but this relationship is lost within classical/tall cell PTC if follicular variants are excluded from the analysis.",

The present study is the first on genomic copy number alterations (CNAs) of PTCs of the Ukrainian-American cohort (UkrAm) generated by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of CNA profiles revealed a significant enrichment of a subgroup of patients with female gender, long latency (>17 years) and negative lymph node status. Further, we identified single CNAs that were significantly associated with latency, gender, radiation dose and BRAF V600E mutation status. Multivariate analysis revealed no interactions but additive effects of parameters gender, latency and dose on CNAs. The previously identified radiation-associated gain of the chromosomal bands 7q11.22-11.23 was present in 29% of cases. Moreover, comparison of our radiation-associated PTC data set with the TCGA data set on sporadic PTCs revealed altered copy numbers of the tumor driver genes NF2 and CHEK2. Further, we integrated the CNA data with transcriptomic data that were available on a subset of the herein analyzed cohort and did not find statistically significant associations between the two molecular layers. However, applying hierarchical clustering on a 'BRAF-like/RAS-like' transcriptome signature split the cases into four groups, one of which containing all BRAF-positive cases validating the signature in an independent data set.

In this study, we have reviewed the cytological features of metastatic PTC to the liver, tested the BRAF V600E status of these lesions, and discussed potential diagnostic pitfalls. The pathological archives at the Johns Hopkins Hospital were searched for metastatic PTC. A total of 247 cases were identified; four cases were found to have metastases to the liver. Three of these cases were available for molecular testing to determine BRAF V600E status. All patients were female with ages ranging from 39- to 66-years old. Local lymph node involvement was found in all patients at the time of thyroidectomy. The average time of liver metastasis discovery following thyroidectomy was 16 years. The cytomorphology revealed predominantly microacini or two-dimensional clusters. Tumor cells were small-to-intermediate in size with oval nuclei, fine chromatin, nuclear grooves, rare intranuclear pseudoinclusions, and mitoses. In all cases, immunohistochemical stains for thyroglobulin and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) were positive. All these tested cases were negative for the BRAF V600E mutation. The differential diagnosis includes adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine neoplasms. The most important morphologic features for diagnosing PTC are the presence of pale finely granular chromatin, nuclear grooves, and intranuclear pseudoinclusions. A thorough review of the patient's clinical history and the use of appropriate IHC stains are essential in reaching an accurate diagnosis.

        "Doc_abstract":"Improvements in our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer have led to the clinical development of protein kinase inhibitors, which target pivotal molecules involved in intracellular signaling pathways implicated in tumorigenesis and progression. These novel targeted agents have demonstrated activity against a wide range of solid tumors, are generally better tolerated than standard chemotherapeutics, and may revolutionize the management of advanced refractory cancer. The ubiquitous Raf serine/threonine kinases are pivotal molecules within the Raf/mitogen extracellular kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) signaling pathway, which regulates cellular proliferation and survival. Raf kinase isoforms (wild-type Raf-1 or the b-raf V600E oncogene) are overactivated in a variety of solid tumor types, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, and papillary thyroid carcinoma. In this review, the role of Raf in normal cells and in cancer is discussed, and an overview is given of Raf inhibitors currently in development, focusing on sorafenib tosylate (BAY 43-9006 or sorafenib). Sorafenib is the first oral multi-kinase inhibitor to be developed that targets Raf kinases (Raf-1, wild-type B-Raf, and b-raf V600E), in addition to receptor tyrosine kinases associated with angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor [VEGFR]-2/-3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor [PDGFR]-beta) or tumor progression (Flt-3, c-kit).

Serum levels of thyroid stimulating hormone stimulated thyroglobulin (off-Tg) and thyroglobulin-antibody (Tg-Ab), and a post-therapy whole body scan (RxWBS) were evaluated. Completion of remnant ablation was considered when there was no visible uptake on RxWBS and undetectable off-Tg (<1.0 ng/mL). Various factors including age, off-Tg, and histopathology were analyzed to predict ablation success rates. Of 176 patients, 68.8% (n = 121) who achieved successful remnant ablation were classified into Group A, and the remaining 55 were classified into Group B. Group A presented with significantly lower off-Tg at the first radioiodine administration (pre-ablative Tg) than those of Group B (1.2 ± 2.3 ng/mL vs. 6.2 ± 15.2 ng/mL, P = 0.027). Pre-ablative Tg was the only significant factor related with ablation success rates. Diagnostic performances of pre-ablative Tg < 10.0 ng/mL were sensitivity of 99.1%, specificity of 14.0%, positive predictive value of 71.1%, and negative predictive value of 87.5%, respectively. Single administration of low radioiodine activity could be sufficient for remnant thyroid ablation in patients with low to intermediate-risk thyroid cancer.

TRA was obtained in 62/79 (78.5%) in group A (1110 MBq in the hypothyroid state), 183/190 (96.3%) in group B [2220 MBq in the hypothyroid state or after rhTSH administration: 87/90 (97%) and 96/100 (96%) patients, respectively], 199/202 (98.5%) in group C [3700 MBq in hypothyroid state or after rhTSH administration: 98/100 (98%) and 101/102 (99%) patients, respectively].;Our data demonstrate that 2220 and 3700 MBq radioiodine are more effective compared with 1110 MBq in TRA, without significant differences between 2220 and 3700 MBq or between hypothyroidism and euthyroidism. We suggest rhTSH-aided TRA with 2220 MBq iodine-131, as this approach permits efficacious treatment, thereby reducing side effects, absorbed dose to body and hospital stay.",

A trend toward multiple hypermethylation was evident in cancer tissues, with hypermethylation of two or more markers detectable in 25% of hyperplasias, 38% of adenomas, 48% of thyroid cancers, and 100% of cell lines. A rank correlation analysis of marker hypermethylation suggests that a subset of these markers is epigenetically modified in concert, which may reflect an organ-specific regulation process. Furthermore, a positive correlation was found between the BRAF mutation and RAR-beta2, and a negative correlation was found between the BRAF mutation and Rassf1A.;Methylation-induced gene silencing appears to affect multiple genes in thyroid tissue and increases with cancer progression.

B) patients (n 11) previously thyroidectomized and high calcitonin levels with or without radiological evidence of local regional or distant metastases. We performed total thyroidectomy with central compartment lymphadenectomy and ipsilateral modified radical neck dissection in group A patients. Group B patients underwent re-excision of the central neck compartment and bilateral modified radical neck dissection if it had not been previously performed.;Most patients had major reduction in postoperative calcitonin levels. Compartmental dissection of the cervical node significantly improved the results of primary surgery and calcitonin returned to normal levels in approximately 60% of the patients in group A, but only the 30% of the patients in group B.;The extent of the primary surgical resection and the evidence of local or distant metastases significantly influence the outcome of MTC patients. An extensive lymphadenectomy performed early in the treatment and re-operative cervical lymphadenectomy in patients with persistently high calcitonin levels after thyroidectomy significantly improved the outcome, although re-operation rarely results in normalized calcitonin levels and is associated with a higher incidence of complications.",

Simultaneous occurrence of both disease entities is very rare.;A 59-year-old man with known hypothyroidism from Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) was seen for thyroid nodules. A thyroid ultrasound revealed a heterogeneous thyroid gland with two hypoechoic nodules, one in the right aspect of the isthmus measuring 2.0 cm×3.2 cm×1.7 cm and another one in the left lobe measuring 1.4 cm×1.3 cm×1.2 cm. A fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of the right-sided nodule revealed atypical epithelial cells and atypical lymphoid cells in a background of lymphocytic thyroiditis; FNA of the left-sided nodule showed findings of PTC. A total thyroidectomy was performed. Lymph node dissection was not performed. Pathology showed extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of MALT type with extreme plasmacytic differentiation in the right nodule and PTC in the left nodule (pT1b Nx Mx). Postoperatively, he underwent radioactive iodine ablation treatment. There was only minimal neck uptake on the post-treatment scan. Further work-up did not show any evidence of extrathyroidal lymphoma. Seven years after the surgery, the patient had no evidence of recurrence of either malignancy.;PTC is the most prevalent thyroid cancer and has an excellent prognosis. Primary thyroid lymphoma is rare and accounts for <5% of all thyroid cancers. Among the primary thyroid lymphomas, MALT lymphoma tends to have a more indolent course and a better prognosis. PTC and MALT lymphoma have been associated with HT. FNA has been validated in several studies for the diagnosis of MALT lymphoma; however, distinguishing MALT lymphoma from HT remains a challenge due to their histological similarities. The treatment of MALT lymphoma remains controversial; however, surgery is generally accepted in the early-stage MALT lymphoma as was performed in the present case.;Since HT is associated with PTC and MALT lymphoma, patients with HT deserve careful surveillance for both disease entities. In our patient, the management of one malignancy did not affect the management of the other, and the prognosis did not seem to be affected.",

Galectin-3 immunostaining and molecular analyses for BRAF and three RAS genes (NRAS, HRAS, and KRAS) were performed.;FNAC diagnoses of FVPTC included benign (5%), atypia of undetermined significance (19%), follicular neoplasm/suspicious for follicular neoplasm (14%), suspicious for PTC (29%), and PTC (34%). Galectin-3 immunostaining was positive in 50% of FNAC specimens. A BRAF mutation was found only in 14 (24%) tumors with the FNAC diagnosis of PTC or suspicious for PTC: 13 cases with the usual c.1799T>A (p.V600E) mutation and 1 case with a 3 base-pair deletion (c.1799_1801delTGA), resulting in a deletion of lysine at codon 601 and a deletion c.1799_1801delTGA that results in a valine-to-glutamate substitution at codon 600 (p.V600_K601>E) while preserving the reading frame. A BRAF K601E mutation was not found. RAS mutations were observed in 18 (33%) tumors (NRAS, 22%; HRAS, 6%; KRAS, 6%). Mutations of the three RAS genes were detected in codon 61 but not in codons 12 and 13. There was a decreasing trend of RAS mutation rates associated with an increasing risk of malignancy in the FNAC diagnostic categories. The triage efficacy of FNAC to make a recommendation for surgery was 73% for encapsulated tumors and 79% for infiltrative tumors. Addition of galectin-3 or the BRAF test to FNAC showed no significant improvement in the triage efficacy. However, RAS mutations significantly improved the triage efficacy of FNAC. There was no significant difference in the triage efficacy of FNAC, galectin-3 expression, and the prevalence of somatic mutations between encapsulated and infiltrative tumors.;Thyroid FNAC has a low sensitivity for the detection of FVPTC regardless of histologic subtype.

Indeed, autoradiographic studies have demonstrated cholecystokinin (CCK)-B/gastrin receptors not only in more than 90% of MTCs but also in a high percentage of small cell lung cancers, some ovarian cancers, astrocytomas and potentially a variety of adenocarcinomas. The aim of this study was to systematically screen and optimize, in a preclinical model and a pilot clinical study, suitable radioligands for targeting CCK-B receptors in vivo.;A variety of CCK/gastrin-related peptides, all bearing the C-terminal CCK receptor-binding tetrapeptide sequence Trp-Met-Asp-PheNH2 or derivatives thereof, were studied. They were radioiodinated by the lodogen or Bolton-Hunter procedures. The peptides were members of the gastrin or CCK families, which differ by the intramolecular position of a tyrosyl moiety. Their stability and affinity were studied in vitro and in vivo; their biodistribution and therapeutic efficacy were tested in nude mice bearing subcutaneous human MTC xenografts. Diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) derivatives of suitable peptides were synthesized successfully, and their preclinical and initial clinical evaluations were performed, labeled with 111In.;All members of the CCK or gastrin families were stable in serum (with half-lives of several hours at 37 degrees C); nevertheless, the stability of those peptides bearing N-terminal pGlu residues or D-amino acids was significantly higher. In accordance with their comparably low affinity, nonsulfated members of the CCK family showed fairly low uptake in the tumor and other CCK-B receptor-expressing tissues. Sulfated CCK derivatives performed significantly better but also displayed a comparably high uptake in normal CCK-A receptor-expressing tissues. This effect was probably due to their similar affinity for both CCK-A and CCK-B receptors. Best tumor uptake and tumor-to-nontumor ratios were obtained with members of the gastrin family because of their selectivity and affinity for the CCK-B receptor subtype. Pilot therapy experiments in MTC-bearing animals showed significant antitumor efficacy compared with untreated controls. DTPA derivatives of minigastrin were successfully developed. In a pilot clinical study, radioiodinated and 111In-labeled derivatives showed excellent targeting of physiological CCK-B receptor-expressing organs, as well as all known tumor sites.;CCK/gastrin analogs may be a useful new class of receptor-binding peptides for diagnosis and therapy of CCK-B receptor-expressing tumors, such as MTC or small cell lung cancer. Nonsulfated gastrin derivatives may be preferable because of their CCK-B receptor selectivity, hence lower accretion in normal CCK-A receptor-expressing organs.",

As controls, six BRAFV600E mutated PTCs, 13 follicular adenomas (FA), and ten normal thyroid parenchyma were also analyzed.;We performed FISH analysis on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue using a commercially available RET break-apart probe. A cut-off level equivalent to 10.2% of aberrant cells was accepted as significant. To validate FISH results, we analyzed the study cohort by qRT-PCR.;Split RET signals above the cut-off level were observed in 25% (10/40) of PTCs, harboring a percentage of positive cells ranging from 12 to 50%, and in one spontaneous FA (1/13, 7.7%). Overall, the data obtained by FISH matched well with qRT-PCR results. Challenging findings were observed in five cases showing a frequency of rearrangement very close to the cut-off.;FISH approach represents a powerful tool to estimate the ratio between broken and non-broken RET tumor cells. Establishing a precise FISH cut-off may be useful in the interpretation of the presence of RET rearrangement, primarily when this strategy is used for cytological evaluation or for targeted therapy.",

The therapeutic options for this type of thyroid cancer are limited and generally not efficient. Recent studies with retinoic acid (RA) have shown that this drug can induce re-differentiation of the thyrocyte and tumor regression after 131I therapy. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of RA therapy in patients with extensive thyroid tumor involvement, which lost radioiodine uptake ability. A total of 5 patients (1 follicular carcinoma, 3 papillary carcinomas and 1 poorly differentiated carcinoma) were treated with isotretinoin (1.0 to 1.5 mg/kg/day) for 5 weeks and then submitted to radioiodine therapy. Three parameters for assessment of RA effects were established: a) reduction of serum thyroglobulin levels; b) increment of the post-therapeutic dose radioiodine uptake; c) tumor size regression after therapy. All patients completed the treatment and the most frequent side effects were dry skin and lips and hypertriglyceridemia. One patient showed satisfactory response (2 or more of the 3 criteria were reached) and a new cycle of RA was given. In two, just a partial response (1 criterion) was seen and the other patients did not respond. Based on these results, isotretinoin might be an option for de-differentiated thyroid cancer, with low rate of severe side effects, especially when compared with cytotoxic drugs. Aggressive thyroid cancer frequently needs multimodal adjuvant therapy.",

The principal inclusion criterion for I-131 radio-guided surgery in our protocol was the presence of an I-131 positive loco-regional disease relapse after previous total thyroidectomy and at least 2 ineffective conventional I-131 treatments. The protocol we used consisted of the following steps. Day 0: all patients were hospitalized and received a therapeutic 3.7 GBq (100 mCi) dose of I-131 after thyroid hormone therapy withdrawal in condition of overt hypothyroidism (serum TSH levels>30 microUI/ml). Day 3: a whole body scan following the therapeutic I-131 dose (TxWBS) administration was acquired. Day 5: neck surgery was performed through a wide bilateral neck exploration using a 15-mm collimated gamma probe, measuring the absolute intra-operative counts and calculating the lesion to background (L/B) ratio. Day 7: post-surgery TxWBS was performed using the remaining radioactivity to evaluate the completeness of tumoral lesions extirpation. The final histologic examination showed the presence of 184 metastatic foci; among them, 98 (53.2%) were evident by both TxWBS and gamma probe evaluation, 76 (41.3%) were demonstrated only by gamma probe, and 10 (5.4%) were negative by both TxWBS and gamma probe evaluation. During follow-up (8 months to 4.9 years, mean 2.8 years), DxWBS, serum Tg levels off l-T4, and US showed absence of loco-regional disease in 25 patients (80.6%) while 6 patients had persistent disease. In conclusion, this protocol allowed us to identify neoplastic foci with high sensitivity and specificity, enabling us to remove loco-regional I-131 disease recurrences resistant to previous conventional I-131 therapies. Furthermore, the gamma probe allowed detection of some additional tumoral foci in sclerotic areas or located behind vascular structures that were not visualized at the pre-surgery TxWBS evaluation.",

We sought to determine if, in patients with DTC who had been treated with bilateral thyroidectomy and remnant ablation with radioactive iodine, sTg 1 year (sTg1) after initial treatment and repeated sTg measurements, 1-2 years after sTg1, helped predict the long-term outcome with respect to structural recurrence and biochemical remission (BR), which is defined as sTg <1 ng/mL.;We retrospectively assessed the records of patients with DTC who had been treated with bilateral thyroidectomy and remnant ablation with radioactive iodine between 1995 and 2004. The study included 186 patients who had NSED with sTg1 ≥2 ng/mL and subsequent sTg measurements (sTg2) without additional treatment. Patients were classified into three groups based on their sTg1 measurements: Group A, 2-4.9 ng/mL; Group B, 5-19.9 ng/mL; and Group C, ≥20 ng/mL. Patients were also classified into two groups based on whether sTg2, 1-2 years after sTg1, had decreased by ≥50% (Group 1) or had either decreased by <50% or increased (Group 2). sTg was measured every 1-2 years until structural recurrence or BR.;Patients remaining in NSED showed a decrease in serial sTg. Of patients in Groups A, B, and C, 41%, 17%, and 1%, respectively, achieved BR, and there was a significant difference in the BR rate between Groups 1 and 2 (p<0.001).

Nevertheless, not all patients with the progressive MTC respond to these drugs, requiring the development of additional therapeutic modalities that have distinct activity. Previously, we reported that expression of activated Ras or Raf in the human MTC cell lines, TT and MZ-CRC-1, can induce growth arrest and RET downregulation via a leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-mediated autocrine/paracrine loop. In this study, we aimed to evaluate bacterially-produced recombinant human LIF for its efficacy to suppress human MTC xenografts in mice. Here, we report that, consistent with its effects in vitro, locally or systemically administered recombinant LIF effectively suppressed growth of TT and MZ-CRC-1 xenografts in mice. Further, as predicted from its effects in TT and MZ-CRC-1 cell cultures in vitro, recombinant LIF activated the JAK/STAT pathway and downregulated RET and E2F1 expression in tumors in mice.

The levels were designated as such in situ prior to surgical pathology specimen processing. Reports of the preoperative FNA cytopathologic findings, the extent of lateral neck dissection by levels, and the postoperative final histopathologic examination were reviewed.;A total of 53 patients underwent therapeutic lateral neck dissection for FNA-confirmed nodal metastasis of PTC at a minimum of one lateral neck level. All 53 patients had preoperative ultrasonography and FNA confirmation of lateral neck disease: 46 patients had PTC, 5 had the tall cell variant of PTC, and 2 had the follicular variant of PTC on final surgical pathology. Ten patients underwent neck dissection at the time of thyroidectomy, and 43 patients underwent neck dissection for lateral neck recurrence/persistence of PTC following a previous thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine +/- previous neck dissection.

Currently therapy is restricted to surgical removal of all neoplastic tissue lacking alternative forms of treatment such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Therefore MTC is a particularly attractive target for gene therapeutic approaches. Many promising gene therapy strategies have been used in various animal models of MTC, showing enhanced antitumoral efficacy, and these will hopefully extend our current standard of care in the future. These approaches can tentatively be subdivided into four groups: (a) Inhibition of oncogenic RET signaling, (b) suicide gene therapy, (c) immunotherapy, and (d) combination of immunotherapy and suicide approaches. To block oncogenic signal transduction dominant-negative RET mutants were delivered into tumor cells and found to possess strong antineoplastic activity, including tumor growth suppression and increased animal survival. Suicide gene therapeutic approaches applied to MTC treatment featured either gene transfer of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase with concomitant application of ganciclovir or delivery of nitric oxide synthase II. Here antitumor effects were attributed to the occurrence of substantial bystander activities. Immunotherapy approaches comprised stimulation of immune response by delivery of interleukin 2 or 12. Finally, treatment with herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase/ganciclovir in combination with interleukin 2 was found to be superior over either treatment alone. This review discusses the various gene therapeutic approaches applied to MTC treatment in detail, gives an overview on the diverse vector systems used to achieve efficient transduction of thyroid cancer cells, and points out the strategies employed to accomplish target cell selective gene expression thereby contributing to enhanced safety of gene therapy for MTC",

Fifty percent inhibitory concentrations were in the low nanomolar range.;In vitro, [111In-DOTA0]CCK8 showed specific internalization in CCK-B receptor-positive rat pancreatic tumor cells AR42J. Internalization of the analog appeared to be time and temperature dependent and receptor specific. From the data obtained with [111In-DOTA0]CCK8 and (125I)I-gastrin, the latter being a specific ligand for the CCK-B receptor, the rat pancreatic cell line CA20948 also appeared to be CCK-B receptor positive. This provides an in vitro and in vivo rat tumor model because this cell line can be grown to solid tumors in Lewis rats. In vivo biodistribution experiments in CA20948 tumor-bearing Lewis rats showed rapid clearance of [111In-DOTA0]CCK8, and specific uptake was found in the CCK-B receptor-expressing stomach and tumor. Furthermore, comparing [111In-DOTA0]CCK8 with the radioiodinated nonsulfated CCK10 analog (D-Tyr-Gly-Asp-Tyr-Nle-Gly-Trp-Nle-Asp-Phe-NH2), both ligands having high affinity for the CCK-B receptor, tumor-to-blood ratios were significantly higher for [111In-DOTA0]CCK8 than for 125I-CCK10, analogous to the findings with radioiodinated and 111In-labeled octreotide.

The ultrasonography (US) is the best diagnostic method for the detection of cervical metastatic LNs. We use a new technique, B-flow imaging (BFI), recently used for evaluation of thyroid nodules, to estimate the presence of BFI twinkling signs (BFI-TS), within metastatic LNs in patients with PTC. Two hundred and fifty-two patients with known PTC were examined for preoperative evaluation with conventional US and BFI. Only 83 with at least one metastatic LN were included. All patients included underwent surgery; the final diagnosis was based on the results of histology. The following LN characteristics were evaluated: shape, abnormal echogenicity, absent hilum, calcifications, cystic appearance, peripheral vascularization, and BFI-TS. A total of 604 LNs were analyzed. Of these, 298 were metastatic, according to histopathology. The BFI-TS showed high values of specificity (99.7%) and sensitivity (80.9%). The combination of each conventional US sign with the BF-TS increases the specificity. Our findings suggest that BFI can be helpful in the selection of suspicious neck LNs that should be examined at cytologic examination for accurate preoperative staging and individual therapy selection.

Post-operative pathology examination revealed six cases of thyroid cancer (1.1%). All six cases had differentiated thyroid carcinoma (papillary carcinoma in 3 cases, follicular carcinoma in 2 cases and papillo-follicular carcinoma in 1 case). The indication for initial thyroidectomy was a palpable thyroid nodule in 3 cases (50%), failure of medical treatment for Grave's disease in 2 cases (33%), and signs of goiter compression in 1 case (17%). Five patients underwent re-operative total thyroidectomy.;This study shows that while malignancy in Grave's disease is uncommon, the presence of thyroid nodule(s) in patients with Grave's disease may be considered as an indication for radical surgery. The most adequate radical surgery in this situation is to perform a total thyroidectomy.",

We retrospectively reviewed 48 patients with tracheal invasion by papillary thyroid carcinoma, follicular thyroid carcinoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma by means of clinical data ranging from 1993 to 2011. The patients were classified into three groups in terms of the depth and extent of tracheal invasion by the tumors, i.e., group A of 18 patients with localized tracheal invasion; group B of 21 patients with intraluminal tracheal invasion, and group C of nine patients with extensive invasion of the trachea, larynx, esophagus and/or mediastinum. Of these patients, 18 received radical tumorectomy and segmental resection of the outer layer of the tracheal wall; 21 had radical tumorectomy, circumferential sleeve trachea resection or segmental tracheal resection plus tracheal repair, and the remaining nine patients underwent radical tumorectomy, segmental trachea resection and esophagolaryngectomy. 46 patients took I(131) oral solution and/or had external radiotherapy postoperatively. A survival analysis was done using Kaplan-Meier Estimator for cumulative survival probability together with Log-Rank test, and Cox Regression Model was used for multivariate analysis. (1) In group A of 18 patients, 10 took I(131)oral solution and 7 received radiotherapy after surgery. The overall 5 and 10-year survival rates were 88.93 and 77.78 %, respectively; (2) In group B of 21 patients, 15 took I(131) oral solution and 7 received radiotherapy after surgery.

The overall 5 and 10-year survival rates were 77.78 and 22.22 %, respectively. Whether they received postsurgical I(131) treatment or radiotherapy, there was a statistical difference between the 5-year survival rates and the 10-year survival rates in all of these three groups (P value in each group is <0.05). In the treatment of thyroid carcinoma with tracheal invasion, radical tumorectomy plus tracheal repair, segmental tracheal resection or circumferential sleeve trachea resection could lengthen the survival time.

The phosphoinositide 3-kinase-protein kinase B/AKT (PI3K-PKB/AKT) pathway is one of the most critical molecular signaling pathways implicated in key cellular processes. Its continuous activation by several aberrant receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and genetic mutations in its downstream effectors result in high cell proliferation in a broad number of cancers, including thyroid carcinomas. In this review article, the role of different signaling pathways of PI3K/AKT in thyroid cancers, with the emphasis on the PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), PI3K/AKT/forkhead box O (FOXO) and PI3K/AKT/phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) pathways, and various therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways have been summarized. In most of the in vitro studies, agents inhibiting mTOR in monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy for thyroid malignancies have been introduced as promising anticancer therapies. FOXOs and PTEN are two outstanding downstream targets of the PI3K/AKT pathway. At the present time, no study has been undertaken to consider thyroid cancer treatment via FOXOs and PTEN targeting. According to the critical role of these proteins in cell cycle arrest, it seems that a treatment strategy based on the combination of FOXOs or PTEN activity induction with PI3K/AKT downstream mediators (e.g., mTOR) inhibition will be beneficial and promising in thyroid cancer treatment.

In most the complement was similar to that of normal thyroid tissue although all but one of the tumours had no detectable 131I concentration in vivo even with excess TSH stimulation. Elevated serum Tg (patient taking T4 in suppressive dose) was generally associated with tumours which had 131I concentrating function when stimulated by excess TSH. Some patients, however, had high serum Tg concentration but only low or indetectable tumour 131I uptake. We conclude that (a) measurement of tumour TSH receptor complement is unlikely to be useful in clinical management as tumours which do not significantly concentrate 131I in vivo may have a normal TSH receptor complement and (b) the capacity to secrete Tg is usually associated with 131I concentration but quantitatively the relationship varies considerably between tumours.",

Indeed, autoradiographic studies demonstrated cholecystokinin (CCK)-B/gastrin receptors not only in >90% of MTCs but in a high percentage of small cell lung cancers and potentially a variety of gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas. In a pilot study, we have demonstrated the feasibility of radiolabeled gastrin-I to target CCK-B receptor-expressing tissues in vivo in animals and patients (T. M. Behr et al., Eur. J. Nucl. Med., 25: 424-430, 1998). The aim of the present study was to systematically optimize, in a preclinical model, suitable radioligands for targeting CCK-B receptors in vivo. For this purpose, a variety of CCK/gastrin-related peptides, all having in common the COOH-terminal CCK-receptor binding tetrapeptide sequence Trp-Met-Asp-PheNH2 or derivatives thereof, were studied. They were radioiodinated by the Iodogen or Bolton-Hunter procedures. The peptides tested were members of the gastrin- or cholecystokinin families or possessed characteristics of both, which differ by the intramolecular position of a tyrosyl moiety (occurring in native or sulfated form). Their stability and affinity were studied in vitro and in vivo; their biodistribution and therapeutic efficacy were tested in nude mice bearing s.c. human MTC xenografts. Diethylene-triamine-pentaacetate derivatives of suitable peptides were synthesized, evaluated, and labeled with (111)In. All members of the CCK or gastrin family were stable in serum (with t(1/2)s of several hours at 37 degrees C); nevertheless, the stability of those peptides was highest that bore the NH2-terminal pGlu residues (e.g., big gastrin, gastrin-I, caerulein, and others) or D-amino acids. In accordance to their comparably low affinity, nonsulfated members of the CCK family showed fairly low uptake in the tumor and other CCK-B receptor-expressing tissues (e.g., the stomach). Sulfated CCK derivatives performed significantly better but additionally displayed a high uptake in normal, CCK-A receptor-expressing tissues (such as the liver/gallbladder, pancreas, and bowel). Best tumor uptake and tumor:nontumor ratios were obtained with members of the gastrin family, probably because of their selectivity and affinity for the CCK-B receptor subtype. Pilot therapy experiments in MTC bearing animals showed significant antitumor efficacy as compared with untreated controls. (111)In-Labeled diethylene-triamine-pentaacetate derivatives of minigastrin showed excellent targeting of CCK-B receptor-expressing tissues in animals and a normal human volunteer. These data suggest that CCK/gastrin analogues may be a useful new class of receptor binding peptides for diagnosis and therapy of CCK-B receptor-expressing tumors, such as MTC or small cell lung cancer. Nonsulfated gastrin derivatives may be preferable because of their CCK-B receptor selectivity, and hence, lower accretion in normal CCK-A receptor-expressing organs. Further preclinical as well as clinical studies are ongoing.",

Specimens were shipped in a nucleic acid stabilization solution and tested at a centralized clinical laboratory. Seventeen genetic alterations (BRAF, KRAS, HRAS, and NRAS mutations, PAX8-PPARG and RET-PTC rearrangements) were evaluated by multiplex polymerase chain reaction and liquid bead array cytometry in 769 FNAs that met inclusion criteria. Cytology, histology, and clinical care followed local procedures and practices. All results were double-blinded.;Thirty-two specimens (4.2%) failed to yield sufficient nucleic acid to generate molecular data. A single genetic alteration was detected in 80% of cytology malignant cases, 21% of indeterminate, 7.8% of nondiagnostic, and 3.5% of benign cases. Among 109 nodules with surgical histology reference standard, oncogenic mutations were present in 50% of malignant nodules missed by cytology. There were 14 cancers not identified by cytology or molecular tests, including 5 carcinomas with histologic sizes less than 1 cm (3 multifocal) and 8 noninvasive follicular variants of papillary carcinoma (4 encapsulated). No mutations were detected in 89% of the nodules benign by histopathology with 6 false-positive molecular results in 5 adenomas (2-5.5 cm) and 1 cystic nodule with an incidental papillary microcarcinoma (0.15 cm). The posttest probability of thyroid cancer was 100% for nodules positive for BRAF or RET-PTC, 70% for RAS or PAX8-PPARG, and 88% for molecular cytology overall.;Centralized and standardized molecular testing for genetic alterations associated with a high risk of malignancy efficiently complements the local cytopathologic diagnosis of thyroid nodule aspirates in the clinical setting.

In the present study, we have analyzed the impact of a pharmacological blockade of the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling pathways on cell migration, proliferation and cell death in three human thyroid tumor cell lines that represent the main types of malignant thyroid carcinomas (B-CPAP, follicular; Cal-62, anaplastic; FTC-133, papillary thyroid carcinoma cells) and in which these pathways are constitutively activated. In general, pharmacological perturbation of PI3/Akt (application of MK-2206) and MEK/ERK1/2 (application of PD0325901 or U0126) signaling led to a cell line and drug-specific decrease in the proliferation and migration potential of thyroid carcinoma cells, although to a varying extent. However, one exception became apparent: in Cal-62 cells inhibition of the MEK/ERK1/2 module increased the migration rate up to 50%. This effect could be prevented by a simultaneous suppression of the PI3/Akt pathway, but also by application of the multiple kinase inhibitor sorafenib, a treatment that did not change the activation state of Akt. Thus, a pharmacological perturbation of canonical signaling pathways in thyroid carcinoma may induce drug-dependent yin-yang effects that are characterized by a simultaneous suppression of one (i.e., proliferation) and the activation of another (i.e., migration) cellular process. The appearance of such phenomena should be taken into account when therapy plans are established. ",

The clinical course of this disease varies from extremely indolent tumors that can go unchanged for years to an extremely aggressive variant that is associated with a high mortality rate. As many as 75% of all medullary thyroid carcinomas are sporadic, with an average age at presentation reported as 60 years, and the remaining 25% are hereditary with an earlier age of presentation, ranging from 20 to 40 years. Germline RET proto-oncogene mutations are the genetic causes of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 and a strong genotype-phenotype correlation exists, particularly between a specific RET codon mutation and the (a) age-related onset and (b) thyroid tumor progression, from C-cell hyperplasia to medullary thyroid carcinoma and, ultimately, to nodal metastases. RET mutations predispose an individual to the development of medullary thyroid carcinomas and can also influence the individual response to RET protein receptor-targeted therapies. RET codon 609 point mutations are rare genetic events belonging to the intermediate risk category for the onset of medullary thyroid carcinoma. A large genealogy resulting in a less aggressive form of medullary thyroid carcinoma is associated with the high penetrance of pheochromocytoma and has been reported in the literature. In this short review article, we comment on our previous report of a large multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A kindred with the same Cys609Ser germline RET mutation in which, conversely, the syndrome was characterized by a slightly aggressive, highly penetrant form of medullary thyroid carcinoma that was associated with low penetrance of pheochromocytoma and primary hyperparathyroidism.",

Three different patterns of mediastinal uptake were observed in the cases described in the present report. Recognizing the patterns and the clinical settings (where this was to be suspected by the treating physician) was important to obviate unnecessary aggressive treatment, such as, surgery or radioiodine therapy. In a review of the literature, we found that a majority of the cases were reported in the young population (related to the thymus reaching its peak size during adolescence and gradual atrophy in the following decades) and in patients undergoing a six-month follow-up whole body diagnostic scan after thyroid remnant ablation treatment, and also in patients receiving a second course of 131-iodine treatment for a persistently elevated thyroglobulin (Tg) level. The indicators that should raise the suspicion of false-positive radioiodine uptake to the attending physician include: (a) undetectable/low serum thyroglobulin level (although this may not be always the case, depending on the clinical setting), (b) a well-controlled disease with no other abnormal focus in the rest of the body,",

DNA-binding assay, luciferase reporter assay, and Western blot were adopted to determine function and expression changes of NF-κB. Then NF-κB regulated anti-apoptotic factors XIAP, cIAP1, and Bcl-xL were measured. Apoptosis was analyzed by Western blot for caspase 3 and PARP, and by flow cytometry as well. An iodide uptake assay was performed to determine whether NF-κB inhibition could influence radioactive iodide uptake.;The methyl-thiazolyl-tetrazolium assay showed significant decrease of viable cells by combination therapy than by mono-therapies.

Moreover, identification of molecular markers as well as a better understanding of thyroid carcinogenesis will help develop innovative targeted therapies, particularly in patients with metastatic iodo-resistant thyroid carcinoma. To date, four types of somatic genetic alterations are known to hold potential interest for the diagnosis and/or prognosis of follicular cell-derived thyroid carcinomas: BRAF and RAS mutations, and RET/PTC and PAX8/PPARγ rearrangements.

There are two major benefits from this clinical practice: (a) the surgeon is alerted to the need to perform total thyroidectomy and central compartment lymphadenectomy, which is the minimal surgical treatment for MTC; and (b) the outcome of MTC is favourably affected because it is usually identified at a less advanced stage.

Compared with current therapies, treatment schedules with selumetinib did not improve progression free survival (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95%CI 0.70-1.17, P= 0.448), but did identify better clinical benefits (odds ratio, 1.24; 95%CI 0.69- 2.24, P = 0.472) and less disease progression (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95%CI 0.51-1.00, P = 0.052) though its impact was not statistically significant. Sub-group analysis resulted in significantly improved progression free survival (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95%CI 0.49-0.57, P = 0.00), clinical benefits (odds ratio, 3.04; 95%CI 1.60-5.77, P = 0.001) and reduced disease progression (hazard ratio, 0.35; 95%CI 0.18-0.67, P = 0.001) in patients administrated selumetinib. Dermatitis acneiform (risk ratio, 9.775; 95%CI 3.143-30.395, P = 0.00) and peripheral edema (risk ratio, 2.371; 95%CI 1.690-3.327, P = 0.00) are the most frequently observed adverse effects associated with selumetinib.;Compared with current chemotherapy, selumetinib has modest clinical activity as monotherapy in patients with advanced cancer, but combinations of selumetinib with cytotoxic agents in patients with BRAF or KRAS mutations hold great promise for cancer treatment. Dermatitis acneiform and peripheral edema are the most frequently observed adverse effects in patients with selumetinib.",

Ablation outcome was assessed by whole-body scan in hypothyroid state 6-9 months after ablation and finally 18-21 months after the treatment.;The rate of successful ablation was similar in the group of patients who received 24 and 40 mCi (75 and 71.2%, respectively). The higher rate of ablation was achieved in the groups treated with 50 and 120 mCi of radioiodine (87.69 and 90.74%, respectively). The ablation rates at the first follow-up examinations (59.5, 67.2, 73.9, 80.6%) were lower than at second control study (75.0, 71.2, 87.7, 90.7%) in all groups. Time required for thyroid remnant ablation seems to be >or=18 months.;Our study indicates that activity of 50 mCi seems to be optimal to achieve a successful ablation rate (approximately 90%). Low I-131 activities are acceptable for lower risk patients because of satisfactory ablation rate (>70%), lower expense, and minimal radiation burden to patients as well as lower radiation exposure to clinical staff. The ablative use of high activities seems neither justified nor optimized.",

The proper management of such patients has been uncertain, but most investigators have advocated repeat testing and evaluation after an interval of several months. The present study was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic implications of these modest increases in plasma calcitonin. In 25 kindred members at direct risk for familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), basal peripheral plasma calcitonin (CT) levels were less than 240 pg/ml. Following provocative testing with intravenous calcium or pentagastrin or both, calcitonin values remained below 240 pg/ml in eight subjects (Group A), however, they were mildly elevated (260-580 pg/ml) in 12 subjects (Group B) and moderately elevated (700-940 pg/ml) in five subjects (Group C). Following the transfemoral placement of a catheter into the inferior thyroid vein (ITV), provocative testing was repeated, and ITV and peripheral blood samples were collected simultaneously. Basal ITV plasma CT levels were below 240 pg/ml in all patients in Group A, however, they were mildly elevated (500 pg/ml) in one of the 12 patients in Group B and moderately elevated (800 pg/ml, 1400 pg/ml) in two of the five patients in Group C. Following provocation, ITV plasma CT levels became markedly elevated in one patient in Group A and in all of the patients in Groups B(2520+/-635 pg/ml) and C (6322+/-2598 pg/ml). Thyroidectomy was performed in patients whose ITV plasma CT level was elevated following provocative testing. Medullary thyroid carcinoma of C-cell hyperplasia were evident either on microscopic (1/1 patient in Group A;9/12 patients in Group B; and 2/5 patients in Group C), or gross (3/12 patients in Group B;3/5 patients in Group C) examination of thyroidectomy specimens. In only one of 14 patients was metastatic MTC noted on histologic examination of resected cervical lymph nodes. Postoperative peripheral plasma CT levels were unchanged from basal and less than 240 pg/ml following provocative testing in all but one patient. The present study then provides definitive evidence that patients at direct risk for familial MTC who have even minimally abnormal responses in peripheral plasma CT following provocative testing generally harbor some stage of a C-cell proliferative disorder. Identification of such individuals with early disease is important because thyroidectomy offers an extremely high cure rate.",

Changes in cell viability and the extents of necrosis and apoptosis were evaluated both immediately and 2 days after irradiation.;Viability of B-CPAP cells diminished with increasing I activity concentration. No apoptosis was detectable immediately after irradiation. Two days after irradiation significant apoptosis was found. The lowest I activity concentration at which apoptosis was detectable corresponds to about 1 MBq . ml. At higher activity concentrations a larger percentage of cells became apoptotic but the proportion decreased again at activity concentrations >10 MBq . ml. Likewise, necrosis was minimal at low activity concentrations and showed an exponential increase with rising I activity concentrations (>5-10 MBq . ml). Necrosis was already detectable immediately after irradiation and was the predominant form of cell death at high activity concentrations.;The data suggest that the nature of the cytotoxic effect of I and whether it leads to apoptotic or necrotic cell death is dose-dependent. High I doses seem to produce mainly necrotic phenomena, whereas at low I activity concentrations apoptotic phenomena prevail. The predominance of delayed apoptosis could explain why radioiodine therapy at lower doses is often linked to delayed onset and possible continuation of thyroid volume reduction over some months and even up to a year.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The ablation of differentiated thyroid cancer by ingested I-131 depends on the activity absorbed by the remnant. This depends on the function of the thyroid cells and on the rate that radioactivity is excreted from the blood. The reduction of radioiodine is described by the effective half-life (EHL), which is the time taken to half the retained radioactivity. If the tumor recurs, more treatments are prescribed, often with escalating activities. Patients may receive several treatments during the evolution of the disease, and the total radioactivity administered (TRA) is the sum of all such activities. The patients' archived information permitted the calculation of EHL and TRA. The patient cohort processed here comprised 274 females and 101 males treated during 1997 to 2015. The TRA to the patients ranged between 1.1 and 129.5 GBq (average = 7.93 ± 9.9 GBq) and the EHL varied between 5.06 and 43.87 hours (average = 14.13 ± 5.7 hours). The data were processed as follows: (a) the EHL corresponding to the last treatment of each patient was plotted against TRA to patients who were treated once and to those treated several times for comparison and (b) using a small subgroup of 16 patients who were treated at least 5 times, the EHL and TRA corresponding to each treatment of each patient were plotted. A function of the form y = p-k·ln(x) was fitted on the data in all graphs and k was calculated. For patients treated once, EHL was independent of TRA. A decrease was seen in (a) multitreated patients, with the gradient (k) ranging between -0.541 and -13.880 and (b) 13 out of 16 patients, with the gradient (k) ranging between -5.55 and -31.17, both indicating an impairment of the remnant function, perhaps identified as \"stunning.\" Since this is not avoidable, the uptake may be boosted by splitting the prescribed activity into low radioactivity fractions, which will also reduce patient hospitalization.

Activity of commonly used chemotherapy (doxorubicin) is low, thus more active compounds need to be introduced into the therapeutic concept of ATC. Recently, based on preclinical data Ain et al. conducted a clinical phase II study with paclitaxel 96 h infusion in ATC achieving a promising response rate of 53%. To further improve therapeutic options in ATC, we evaluated the activity of topotecan, oxaliplatin, vinorelbine, gemcitabine and paclitaxel in comparision to cisplatin and doxorubicin (1 and 96 h drug exposure) alone or in combination in the ATC cell lines SW1736 and 8505C. IC50 values were determined by the sulforhodamine B assay, potential clinical activity was estimated by relative antitumor activity (RAA) and drug interaction was analyzed using a parametric response surface approach (Greco model) of the Loewe additivity. Duration of drug effect was estimated by regrowth kinetics. We found paclitaxel, vinorelbine and gemcitabine active in ATC with RAA (1 h drug exposure) ranging from 86 to 454, 15 to 17 and 31 to 140, respectively. The activity of doxorubicin and cisplatin was moderate with RAA ranging from 1.4 to 2.2 and 0.2 to 0.3, respectively. Combined drug exposure of gemcitabine/paclitaxel and gemcitabine/vinorelbine was synergistic with a Loewe index > 0. However, these results did not reach statistical significance with p > 0.05. At clinically relevant drug concentrations paclitaxel, gemcitabine and vinorelbine but not oxaliplatin exerted a sustained growth inhibition after cessation of drug exposure for the complete assay time of 15 days. In conclusion, paclitaxel, gemcitabine and vinorelbine but not topotecan or oxaliplatin appeared to be active in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma based on RAA or growth delay at clinically relevant drug concentrations. Combinations of vinorelbine/gemcitabine and paclitaxel/gemcitabine exerted a trend to synergy.

Twenty thyroid cancer patients were entered in the study after total thyroidectomy: ten patients (group A) underwent whole-body scintigraphy with 185 MBq of (131)I and the other ten (group B) received 3700 MBq of (131)I therapy. All patients were in a hypothyroid state at the time of administration of (131)I and started L-thyroxine 150 microg/day 3 days after (131)I administration. Free and bound triiodothyronine and thyroxine, thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroglobulin, thyroglobulin antibodies, thyroid peroxidase/microsomal antibodies, white blood cell, lymphocyte counts and lymphocyte subsets were serially determined at baseline and at days 2, 7, 15, 30 and 60 after (131)I administration. Twenty healthy age- and sex-matched individuals were used as a reference population for lymphocyte subset values. In group A only a reduction in NK cells at days 7 (P=0.043) and 15 (P=0.037) was observed. In group B, patients showed a delayed reduction in the total lymphocyte count at days 15, 30 and 60 (P=0.008, 0.004 and 0. 018, respectively), and a decrease in B cells throughout the study (at days 7, 15, 30 and 60: P=0.006, 0.0017, 0.0017 and 0.0017 respectively). A transient decrease in NK cells was observed at days 15 (P=0.025) and 30 (P=0.008). Among T cells, the helper phenotype (CD4+) was mainly affected, resulting in a reduction in the CD4+/CD8+ ratio at day 60 (P=0.046). Comparing the two groups, the numbers of B lymphocytes at day 30 (P=0.023) and NK cells at days 2 (P=0.037) and 30 (P=0.023) were significantly lower in group B. Neither group showed any clinical sign of immunosuppression during the follow-up period. In patients with thyroid cancer the sensitivity of lymphocytes to the effects of (131)I administered for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes depends upon lymphocyte phenotype and (131)I activity. NK cells are the most radiosensitive cells, being reduced even by low (131)I activity. At higher activity all subtypes show a reduction, which is more marked and prolonged for B lymphocytes and, to a lesser extent, for T-helper lymphocytes. These changes do not result in clinically relevant immunosuppression.",

The diagnosis is made by fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) and by measuring calcitonin levels in the blood. Primary treatment consists of surgical resection including a total thyroidectomy, central neck nodal dissection and functional lateral neck nodal dissections. Most patients with a palpable primary tumour have nodal disease at the time of operation, and nodal involvement is often bilateral.;adequate resection of the primary tumour and cervical lymph nodes is important to optimize outcome and minimize the risk of recurrent disease. Following primary surgical resection, more than 50% of the patients will have recurrent disease with persistent elevation of calcitonin levels.

Radioiodine uptake in metastatic lesions is greater in younger patients than in older ones. Hypothyroidism is often mild or even absent in patients with a large amount of tumor tissue, indicating that thyroid hormones produced by highly differentiated tumors compensate partially or even completely for hypothyroidism following total thyroidectomy. Adequate uptake of 131I has been reported to be associated with significant reduction in the size and number of metastases, and with lower recurrence and higher survival rates. Other favorable factors for longer survival are younger age, well-differentiated histological type, small disease extent, and early discovery of metastases. Older patients with extensive metastases and/or bulky tumor masses in the bone have a poor prognosis. Therefore, it is important to discover metastases as early as possible, when patients are still young. Long-term follow-up with periodic thyroglobulin measurements and imaging studies is strongly recommended. In Japan, 131I treatment for Graves' disease is performed only in selected patients in whom antithyroid drugs cannot be used because of side effects or not effective, considering the high prevalence of permanent hypothyroidism. 89SrCl3 is useful for reducing pain due to bone metastases of malignant tumors. 131I-MIBG therapy is effective for improvement of QOL in some patients with metastatic malignant pheochromocytoma.

Unfortunately, fine-needle aspiration biopsies are indeterminate in 20%-30% of patients, often necessitating thyroid surgery for diagnosis. Numerous DNA microarray studies including a recently commercialized molecular classifier have helped to better distinguish benign from malignant thyroid nodules. Unfortunately, these assays often require probes for >100 genes, are expensive, and only available at a few laboratories. We sought to validate these DNA microarray assays at the protein level and determine whether simple and widely available immunohistochemical biomarkers alone could distinguish benign from malignant thyroid nodules.;A tissue microarray (TMA) composed of 26 follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTCs) and 53 follicular adenomas (FAs) from patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules was stained with 17 immunohistochemical biomarkers selected based on prior DNA microarray studies. Antibodies used included galectin 3, growth and differentiation factor 15, protein convertase 2, cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase 1 (GOT1), trefoil factor 3 (TFF3), Friedreich Ataxia gene (X123), fibroblast growth factor 13 (FGF13), carbonic anhydrase 4 (CA4), crystallin alpha-B (CRYAB), peptidylprolyl isomerase F (PPIF), asparagine synthase (ASNS), sodium channel, non-voltage gated, 1 alpha subunit (SCNN1A), frizzled homolog 1 (FZD1), tyrosine related protein 1 (TYRP1), E cadherin, type 1 (ECAD), and thyroid hormone receptor associated protein 220 (TRAP220). Of note, two of these biomarkers (GOT1 and CD44) are now used in the Afirma classifier assay. We chose to compare specifically FTC versus FA rather than include all histologic categories to create a more uniform immunohistochemical comparison. In addition, we have found that most papillary thyroid carcinoma could often be reasonably distinguished from benign disease by morphological cytology findings alone.;Increased immunoreactivity of CRYAB was associated with thyroid malignancy (c-statistic, 0.644; negative predictive value [NPV], 0.90) and loss of immunoreactivity of CA4 was also associated with malignancy (c-statistic, 0.715; NPV, 0.90) in indeterminate thyroid specimens. The combination of CA4 and CRYAB for discriminating FTC from FA resulted in a better c-statistic of 0.75, sensitivity of 0.76, specificity of 0.59, positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.32, and NPV of 0.91. When comparing widely angioinvasive FTC from FA, the resultant c-statistic improved to 0.84, sensitivity of 0.75, specificity of 0.76, PPV of 0.11, and NPV of 0.99.;Loss of CA4 and increase in CRYAB immunoreactivity distinguish FTC from FA in indeterminate thyroid nodules on a thyroid TMA with an NPV of 91%. Further studies in preoperative patient fine needle aspiration (FNAs) are needed to validate these results.",

The PFS benefit of sorafenib over placebo was evident in all pre-specified clinical and genetic biomarker subgroups, and neither BRAF nor RAS mutation status was predictive of sorafenib benefit for PFS. The objective response rate was significantly higher in patients receiving sorafenib than in those receiving placebo; all objective responses were partial responses. The overall survival benefit of sorafenib is as yet unclear, with no significant benefit observed at the time of primary analysis or at 9 months following the primary analysis. Overall survival was possibly confounded by the crossover of patients in the placebo group to sorafenib upon disease progression. The adverse events associated with sorafenib in the DECISION trial were consistent with the known tolerability profile of the drug, with hand-foot skin reaction, diarrhea, and alopecia reported most commonly. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were grade 1 or 2 in severity and occurred early in treatment. However, a high proportion of patients discontinued sorafenib therapy or required dose reductions or interruptions because of toxicity.

Debate exists in literature about the optimal amount of I-131 that should be given for obtaining an effective ablation and about the role of iodine pool during treatment. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess whether I-131 ablation during rhTSH stimulus can be improved by reducing the circulating iodine pool and by increasing thyroid cell uptake and retention of I-131 obtained by administering furosemide and lithium.;A total of 201 consecutive DTC patients were entered in the study: they were treated by total thyroidectomy and I-131 therapy during rhTSH stimulus to ablate thyroid remnants. Patients were divided into two groups according to the TNM stage: group 1 included patients in stage I-II who were treated with a low 30-mCi I-131 dose, while group 2 included patients in stage III-IV who were treated by a high 100-mCi I-131 dose. Moreover, both groups were further subdivided into three subgroups. Subgroup (a) included 45 patients from group 1 and 22 from group 2: they were treated with I-131 under rhTSH stimulus, following a short 4-day withdrawal of L-thyroxine (LT4). Subgroup (b) included 45 patients from group 1 and 22 from group 2: they were treated with I-131 under rhTSH stimulus, following a short 4-day withdrawal of L-T4, and after furosemide administration (25 mg/day orally) during the 3 days before I-131. Subgroup (c) included 45 patients from group 1 and 22 from group 2: they were treated with I-131 under rhTSH stimulus, following a short 4-day L-T4 withdrawal, and after administration of furosemide (25 mg/day orally) during the 3 days prior I-131 and lithium (450 mg/day orally) during the 3 days following I-131. Another group (group 3) of 20 patients characterized by a very low-risk cancer (unifocal tumor <1.0 cm in diameter, without extra-capsular extension, N0) was treated with a 30-mCi I-131 dose under rhTSH stimulus without performing the short 4-day L-4 withdrawal: this group was taken as the control. Follow-up was performed by neck ultrasonography (US), and Tg measurement and I-131 WBS under rhTSH stimulus.;Among the patients from group 1, those pre-treated with furosemide or with furosemide plus lithium showed a better outcome of ablation both in terms of undetectable Tg values (97.7% and 95.5 % vs. 79.5%, p < 0.05) and of WBS negativity (97.7% vs. 81.8%, p < 0.05) during the rhTSH stimulus. No similar findings were observed in group 2 patients. Moreover, in patients from group 3 (I-131 30 mCi, without L-T4 withdrawal), the outcome of ablation was significantly lower in comparison to patients from group 1 (I-131 30 mCi, with L-T4 withdrawal) in terms of undetectable Tg during the rhTSH stimulus (55.0%, p < 0.001).;rhTSH is highly effective for post-surgical thyroid remnant ablation in low-risk cancer patients using the low 30-mCi dose protocol combined with the short 4-day withdrawal of L-T4. Moreover, in these patients the pre-treatment with furosemide seems to play an important role to further improve the outcome of ablation by reducing the iodine pool.",

Clinical relapse in UMC was not observed in both groups.  No significant difference in disease specific survival or relapse free survival between group A and B was observed.  The lack of clinical relapse in UMC in group B indicates that most of the lymph node metastases in this compartment could be resected by the conventional collar incision or most microscopic lymphatic metastases could remain dormant as with lateral microscopic node metastases.

In most of the studies, planar imaging was performed for comparison using thallium-201 chloride or technetium-99m 2-methoxyisobutylisonitrile ((99m)Tc-MIBI). Furthermore, FDG-PET studies were not always performed in the hypothyroid state with increased levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which are known to increase FDG uptake by DTC. The aim of this study was to compare the ability of FDG-PET to detect metastatic DTC with that of (99m)Tc-MIBI whole-body single-photon emission tomography (SPET) and post-therapeutic iodine-131 scintigraphy, evaluated under TSH stimulation. Nineteen patients (8 men, 11 women; age range, 38-72 years, mean 60 years; 17 thyroidectomised and 2 inoperable patients following (131)I ablation of the remaining thyroid tissue; 16 papillary and 3 follicular carcinomas) with metastatic DTC underwent FDG-PET whole-body scan (WBS) and (99m)Tc-MIBI SPET WBS at an interval of less than 1 week, followed by (131)I therapy. The SPET images were reconstructed using the maximum likelihood expectation maximisation (ML-EM) method. All patients were hypothyroid at the time of each scan. (131)I WBS was performed 3-5 days after oral administration of the therapeutic dose. A total of 32 lesions [10 lymph node (LN), 15 lung, 6 bone, 1 muscle] were diagnosed as metastases, as confirmed by histopathology and/or other imaging modalities (X-ray, US, CT, MRI, bone, (201)Tl and (131)I scans). FDG-PET, (99m)Tc-MIBI SPET and post-therapeutic (131)I scintigraphy respectively revealed a total of 26 (81.3%), 20 (62.5%) and 22 (68.8%) lesions. These techniques respectively demonstrated nine (90.0%), eight (80.0%) and six (60.0%) LN metastases, and eleven (73.3%), seven (46.7%) and ten (66.7%) lung metastases. They each demonstrated five of the six bone metastases (83.3%). FDG-PET and (99m)Tc-MIBI SPET were positive in 17 (78.3%) and 14 (63.6%) of the 22 (131)I-positive lesions, respectively, and also in nine (90.0%) and six (60.0%) of the ten (131)I-negative lesions, respectively. Three of the five (131)I-positive and FDG-PET-negative lesions were miliary type lung metastases with a maximal nodular diameter of less than 10 mm. Comparison of FDG-PET with (99m)Tc-MIBI SPET revealed concordant results in 24 lesions, and discordant results in eight lesions (seven with positive FDG-PET alone and one with positive (99m)Tc-MIBI SPET alone).;(a) even using whole-body SPET, FDG PET is superior to (99m)Tc-MIBI in terms of ability to detect metastases of DTC; (b) the higher sensitivity of FDG-PET compared with the previous studies could partly be due to increased serum TSH.",

The procedure allows pathologic staging of lymph nodes of the central compartment and treatment of the micrometastases. Nevertheless, the morbidity that its routine use adds to the total thyroidectomy must be taken into account. The aim of this study was to characterize the morbidity that CND adds to the total thyroidectomy.;This was a retrospective study of 1087 patients with PTC and clinically negative neck lymph nodes. Patients were divided into three study groups: Group A, total thyroidectomy; Group B, total thyroidectomy and ipsilateral CND; Group C, total thyroidectomy and bilateral CND. Primary endpoints of the study were evaluated by comparing the rates of transient and permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury and hypoparathyroidism in the three study groups.;Analysis of data showed no significant differences in the rate of transient (Group A: 3.6%, Group B: 3.9%, and Group C: 5.5%; p=0.404) and permanent (Group A: 1%, Group B: 0.5%, and Group C: 2.3%; p=0.099) RLN injury between the three study groups. Both ipsilateral CND and bilateral CND were associated with a higher rate of transient hypoparathyroidism (Group: A 27.7%, Group B: 36.1%, and Group C: 51.9%; p=0.014; odds ratio [OR]: 1.477; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.091-2.001; p<0.001; OR: 2.827; 95% CI: 2.065-3.870, respectively).

Prophylactic CND ipsilateral to the tumor associated with total thyroidectomy may represent an effective strategy for reducing the rate of permanent hypoparathyroidism. Concomitant completion contralateral paratracheal lymph node neck dissection should be performed in presence of lymph node metastasis on intraoperative frozen-section pathology. This approach limits the use of bilateral CND to patients with intraoperative pathological findings of lymph node metastases.",

Due to serious public health perception, there was an urgency to evaluate the baseline levels of childhood thyroid status in Fukushima prefecture. Therefore we have commenced a thyroid ultrasound examination (TUE) survey of the approximately 360,000 pediatric inhabitants (0 to 18 years of age) who lived in Fukushima at the time of the accident in October 2011. The subjects were divided into three categories according to the standardized diagnostic criteria of ultrasound findings. Category A contained the subjects whose TUE findings were intact or benign. Category B were recommended a confirmatory TUE. Category C was recommended an immediate confirmatory TUE.;The survey of 40,302 subjects in the first year was completed in March, 2013. There were 40,097 (99.5%), 205 (0.50%) and 0 subjects in categories A, B and C, respectively. Of the 82 category B subjects who underwent fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), 12 were diagnosed with a malignant tumor or were suspected to have malignancy. The 12 subjects received thyroid surgery and 11 thyroid cancers and one benign nodule were confirmed histologically after surgery. This is the first large-scaled TUE survey to employ sophisticated ultrasound screening and aim to evaluate the baseline frequency of childhood thyroid nodules and cysts. The results will become the golden standard of future comparative TUE in Fukushima, Japan.",

The aim of this study was to analyze whether these subgroups are clinically different. A retrospective analysis of clinicopathological data of patients with pT3 PTC, with a minimum follow-up of 2 years, at a referral center was conducted. Outcome was evaluated after primary treatment and after 2 and 5 years of follow-up. Patients were classified as no evidence of disease (NED), biochemical evidence of disease (BED), and structural evidence of disease (SED) either locoregional (SED-L) or at distance (SED-D). The study patients were classified into three groups as follows: Group A (n = 91), Group B (n = 101), and Group C (n = 23). Most patients were female (80.0 %); mean age at diagnosis was 49.9 ± 16.5 years. 214 patients underwent total thyroidectomy; 208 patients were treated with (131)I. Median follow-up was 6.0 years.

Initial therapy was tumor resection for 5 patients, lobectomy for 23 patients, total thyroidectomy with unilateral modified neck dissection for 60 patients, and total thyroidectomy with bilateral modified neck dissection for 7 patients. Clinical stage at diagnosis was as follows. Class I included 28 patients with intrathyroidal disease, class II included 60 patients with positive cervical lymph nodes, and class II included 7 patients with tumor invasion into tissue outside of the thyroid gland. Recurrence of the tumor was evaluated according to lymphocytic infiltration in the thyroid gland. Group A consisted of 36 patients with PTC associated with lymphocytic infiltration, 26 with infiltration surrounding the tumor, 3 with infiltration inside of the tumor, and 7 with both. Group B consisted of the remaining 59 patients with PTC with no lymphocytic infiltration. There were no differences in age, sex, initial tumor size, or initial treatment between groups A and B. Antithyroglobulin antibody and/or antimicrosomal antibody were positive in 16 patients from group A and 4 patients from group B (P < 0.001). Class I included 14 patients from each group, class II included 22 patients from group A and 38 patients from group B, and class III included 7 patients, all from group B. Recurrence of the tumor was found in only 1 group A patient (2.8%), but in 11 patients of group B (18.6%). The percentage of patients free from recurrence over the 10 yr of follow-up in group A was significantly higher than that in group B (by Cox-Mantel test, P < 0.01). The time between initial treatment and recurrence was 2-10 yr. In comparing the clinical stage at the time of initial treatment, recurrence was found in 1 class II patient from group A (4.5%) and in 1 class I (7.1%), 6 class II (15.8%), and 4 class III (57.1%) patients from group B. No patients died during the 10 yr of follow-up. In conclusion, 1) lymphocytic infiltration surrounding the tumor or inside the tumor in PTC might be of use as a means for predicting a favorable prognosis; and 2) class II or class III patients with no lymphocytic infiltration had a high rate of recurrence.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at comparing the short-term LRR between patients who underwent TT with pCND and those who underwent TT alone.;A systematic review of the literature was performed to identify studies comparing LRR between patients with PTC who underwent TT + pCND (group A) and those who underwent TT alone (group B). Inclusion criteria were cN0 patients, with each comparative group containing > 10 patients, and with the number of LRR and mean follow-up duration available. The pooled incidence rate ratio (IRR) was used for calculating the LRR rate between the two groups. Other parameters evaluated included postoperative radioiodine (RAI) ablation, surgically related complications, and overall morbidity. Meta-analysis was performed using a fixed-effects model.;Fourteen studies matched the selection criteria. Of the 3331 patients, 1592 (47.8%) belonged to group A, while 1739 (52.2%) belonged to group B. Relative to group B, group A was significantly more likely to have postoperative RAI ablation (71.7% vs. 53.1%; odds ratio [OR] = 2.60 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.12-3.18]), temporary hypocalcemia (26.0% vs. 10.8%; OR = 2.56 [CI = 2.04-3.21]), and overall morbidity (33.2% vs. 17.7%; OR = 2.12 [CI = 1.75-2.57]). When temporary hypocalcemia was excluded, overall morbidity was similar between the two groups (7.3% vs. 6.8%; OR = 1.07 [CI = 0.78-1.47]).

Temporary hypocalcemia was the major surgical morbidity in pCND and, when excluded, the overall morbidity appeared similar between the two groups. Although our meta-analysis would suggest that those who undergo TT + pCND may have a 35% reduction in risk of LRR than those who undergo TT alone in the short term (< 5 years), it remains unclear how much of this risk reduction is related to increased use of RAI ablation and potential selection bias in some of the studies examined.",

For some 25 years, elevated serum concentrations of Tg therefore have been employed as a post-operative marker for well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma. The aim of serum Tg measurement is to identify patients requiring: A) further testing to confirm the presence and to determine the stage, site and functionality of tumour; and/or B) further treatment. Serum Tg testing has the advantages of superior sensitivity to radioiodine whole-body scanning (WBS), lack of false positive readings, simplicity, speed, low cost, precision and wide availability. However, major limitations of serum Tg testing are interference by serum anti-Tg antibodies and decreased sensitivity during THST. To obviate this last drawback, the use of recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone (rhTSH) has been clinically investigated as a preparative adjunct to serum Tg testing in the diagnostic follow-up of well-differentiated thyroid cancer. A large, multicentre international Phase III study now has confirmed evidence from earlier Phase I/II and Phase III trials and established the safety and efficacy of rhTSH in stimulating Tg release by residual and neoplastic thyroid tissue. This confirmatory study has clearly shown that 1) rhTSH administration significantly increases sensitivity of serum Tg measurement in patients on THST; and 2) by permitting sensitive diagnostic follow-up with serum Tg measurement and/or radioiodine WBS during THST, rhTSH administration improves patient comfort and quality of life compared to THST withdrawal. Thus use of the drug in diagnostic follow-up recently has received regulatory approval in the United States, and such approval is pending in the European Union. With regulatory approval, rhTSH is likely to gain an important role as a preparative adjunct to serum Tg testing in everyday practice.",

Important counter-arguments include: (a) Restoration of iodine sufficiency does not reverse nodular goiter nor can the growth of individual nodules be predicted; (b) To gather the annual case load necessary to achieve improved outcomes, surgeons need to \"super-specialize\", which may not be viable globally; (c) Many incidental cancers are detectable through high-resolution ultrasonography, fine needle aspiration cytology, and frozen section during thyroidectomy; (d) Not all recurrent goiters require reoperations; (e) Thyroid hormone replacement is not available and affordable everywhere.;The higher surgical morbidity associated with total thyroidectomy, notably recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy and hypoparathyroidism, calls for individualizing the extent of resection for endemic goiter as a new standard of care instead of heading for routine total thyroidectomy.",

Survival time after diagnosis of DM may be several months to years. Long-term follow-up is necessary to determine prognostic factors for survival in PTC with DM. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical features and therapeutic outcomes of PTC with DM after 10 years of follow-up. The study population consisted of 70 patients who underwent initial thyroidectomy before 2004 and had DM beyond the locoregional neck area. Of these 70 patients, 40 patients were diagnosed with DM before or within 9 months after initial thyroidectomy in first radioactive iodide (I) whole-body scintigraphy (group A), and 30 patients were diagnosed with DM during the follow-up period (group B). Patients with DM underwent 3.7 to 7.4 GBq I therapy every 6 to 12 months. After a mean follow-up period of 10.1 ± 0.9 years, the disease-specific mortality and remission rates were 70.0% (49/70) and 10% (7/70), respectively. The survival rates for patients in groups A and B were 72.5% and 96.7% at 1 year, 47.5% and 90.0% at 5 years, 40.0% and 70.0% at 10 years, 36.4% and 41.1% at 15 years, and 35.0% and 8.0% at 20 years, respectively. The percentage of male and older patients and patients with larger tumor size was higher in the mortality group than in the survival group, whereas the percentage of patients with I avid metastatic lesions (first DM) was lower in the mortality group. The percentage of patients with secondary primary cancers was higher in group B than in group A. In the multiple regression analysis, age and male gender were independently associated with disease-specific mortality. In conclusion, after a mean follow-up of 10.1 years, the disease-specific mortality rate for PTC with DM was 70.0%. Older patients and male PTC patients with DM need more aggressive treatment. The timing of DM diagnosis did not influence disease-specific mortality.",

We analyzed 541 scans of 216 DTC patients who were divided into 3 groups based on radioactive iodine (I-131) WBS uptake and clinical follow-up: group 1 (completion of ablation), group 2 (abnormal uptake in the cervical region), and group 3 (abnormal uptake with distant metastases). For each group, we calculated the ratio of I-131 WBS hepatic uptake (H) to cranial uptake as background (B); this ratio was defined as H/B. Furthermore, we made a distinction between group 1, as having completed radioactive iodine therapy (RIT) (CR), and group 2 and 3, as requiring subsequent RIT (RR). The average H/B scores were 1.34 (median, 1.36; range 1.00-2.1) for group 1; 1.89 (median, 1.75; range 1.41-4.20) for group 2; and 2.09 (median, 1.90; range 1.50-4.32) for group 3. Bonferroni multiple comparisons revealed significant differences in H/B among these groups. The H/B of group 1 was significantly smaller than that of other 2 groups (P < 0.0001). The precise cutoff value of H/B for therapeutic effect was ≤1.5. Moreover, 159 of 160 scans in the CR and 375 of 381 patients in the RR were correctly diagnosed using this cutoff value in the final outcome of RIT, yielding a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 99.4%, 98.4%, 99.7%, and 96.3%, respectively.

We aimed to identify optimal postoperative serum TSH levels in elderly patients to prevent recurrence and metastasis and minimize complications. This retrospective cohort study collected data of 87 consecutive elderly patients (age >75) who underwent surgery for PTC with postoperative levothyroxine therapy (50-150 μg/d) between January 2006 and June 2008 and were followed until 2013. After 24 patients with TSH fluctuations and incomplete data were excluded, 73 patients were grouped based on postoperative TSH levels: Group A, 0.3-0.5 mIU/mL; Group B, 0.1-0.3 mIU/mL; and Group C <0.1 mIU/mL (n = 24, 25, 24, respectively). Subjects' baseline, preoperative data, postoperative complications and 1-, 3- and 5-year follow-up data were compared between groups. No significant differences in gender, age (median age of 80 years old), surgery type or clinical characteristics were found between groups (all p value >0.05). Postoperatively, all subjects had normal ECG and neck ultrasound, no osteoporosis, and no differences in survival rate or metastasis. Five-year follow-up revealed significant differences in development of arrhythmias, osteoporosis, insomnia and anxiety between Groups B (0.1-0.3 mIU/mL) and C (<0.1 mIU/mL) compared to Group A (0.3-0.5 mIU/mL). Postoperative incidence of PTC recurrence and metastasis remained stable in elderly patients undergoing thyroid surgery and endocrine therapy but complications increased significantly with increasing TSH levels. Controlling TSH to lower limits of normal may help prevent PTC recurrence and metastasis and reduce complications in this high-risk population.",

It has been proposed that age, distant metastases, extent, and size (AMES) are prognostic indicators for WDTC. In this retrospective study, the role of AMES in selection and extent of surgical resection was evaluated. A total of 155 patients with WDTC treated between 1970 and 1990 at this institution were reviewed. The mean follow-up was 9 years. Patients were divided into low risk (Group A), and high risk (Group B) based on AMES. Group A had 141 patients, and Group B had 14 patients. Ninety-eight patients underwent total or subtotal thyroidectomy; 87 of these were in Group A and 11 in Group B. Fifty-seven patients had lesser surgical resection (53 lobectomy and isthmusectomy, three excision of nodule, and one needle biopsy). Five of the 11 in Group B who had more extensive surgery and none of 3 who had lesser surgery have died of their disease. Three patients in Group A have died of WDTC, of which two had total thyroidectomy and one had lobectomy with isthmusectomy. This study suggests that conservative resection is an adequate treatment in low risk patients based on AMES. This treatment may be enough for high risk patients, although the number of patients is small to make definitive recommendations.",

The therapeutic procedure consists of a) thyroid blockade; b) administration of high specific activity 131I-MIBG; c) single doses, varying from 3.7 to 9.5 GBq, given by slow i.v. infusion (2-3 hours); d) monitoring of the patient during the infusion of the tracer. Targeted radiotherapy with 131I-MIBG in malignant pheochromocytomas, paragangliomas, carcinoids and medullary thyroid carcinomas, was shown to be effective with partial reduction of tumoral lesions (mainly in pheochromocytomas with 58% of objective responses) and palliation in metastatic tumors; in a few pheochromocytomas also succeed in eradicating the residual/recurrent tumor. In patients with stage IV NB who failed to respond to or relapsed after conventional chemotherapy, MIBG therapy showed an important palliative role. A significant therapeutic improvement in the outcome of stage III and IV NB patients was obtained by introducing 131I-MIBG as a first line therapy, partial or even complete responses occurring in more than 60% of the cases treated. Experiences combining chemotherapeutic agents and 131I-MIBG are also in progress with encouraging results. MIBG therapy is well tolerated; toxicity is limited to minor hematologic toxicity and patients generally recover spontaneously. The risk of pancytopenia rises in patients with bone and/or bone marrow metastases; in these cases bone marrow harvesting is recommended. An alternative approach to 131I-MIBG therapy in MTC uses radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies. A novel immunotargeting method, which includes a bispecific antibody and 131I as a radiolabel, seems to be very promising.",

Two of these cases also showed papillary carcinoma (one case of Warthin's-like papillary carcinoma and one case of classic type). All patients were females (age range 32-67 yr) and presented with elevated antithyroglobulin antibodies. Two patients presented with a solitary thyroid mass, and from these one had multiple bilateral neck nodes and a paravertebral mass. The third patient presented with a multinodular gland adherent to neck structures. All patients underwent total thyroidectomy. Histologic sections showed extensive replacement of the thyroid parenchyma with dense keloidal fibrosis, intermixed well-developed lymphoid follicles, and scattered lymphocytes and plasma cells. In all cases the fibrotic process extended beyond thyroid capsule with involvement of the perithyroidal soft tissues and skeletal muscle consistent with Riedel's disease. One case showed a classic papillary carcinoma with bilateral lymph node metastases, and the other showed a Warthin's-like papillary carcinoma.

A right lower lobectomy was performed. The diagnosis was malignant lymphoma (marginal zone B-cell lymphoma). Immunohistochemical staining for IgM gave a positive result. Case 2: Multiple nodular shadows were noted in both lungs of a 55-year-old man after a bout of pneumonia. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery was performed, and the diagnosis was malignant lymphoma (marginal zone B-cell lymphoma). Gene analysis revealed rearrangement of a heavy chain gene. Case 3: An abnormal shadow was seen in the chest radiograph of a 60-year-old man. He was treated by right upper and middle lobectomy. The diagnosis was Hodgkin's disease, nodular sclerosing type. Chemotherapy was given after surgery and the patient is now alive without recurrence. As the pulmonary malignant lymphoma was difficult to diagnosepreoperatively, it was necessary to resect the mass for diagnostic purposes. The prognosis of a resected solitary lesion in the lobe was good. Therefore lobectomy was performed as the treatment of choice.

Of 73 patients with SMTC (mean age of 43.78 years at diagnosis), 70 patients were followed up for 12.0-169.0 months (median 90.0). Having given their informed consent, 12 patients underwent total thyroidectomy with bilateral central neck dissection (group A), 40 underwent subtotal thyroidectomy preserving contralateral thyroid tissue on the entrance point of the recurrent laryngeal nerve into the larynx with ipsilateral modified radical neck dissection (group B), and 18 patients underwent subtotal thyroidectomy preserving contralateral thyroid tissue on the entrance point of the recurrent laryngeal nerve into the larynx with bilateral modified radical neck dissection (group C). The diagnosis was confirmed by a pathology examination. The incidences of hypoparathyroidism and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, the cancer recurrence rates and survival time were investigated post-operatively. Significant differences were found between groups A, B and C in the incidence of hypoparathyroidism (χ(2)=40.9, P<0.01), as well as that of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (χ(2)=32.9, P<0.01). The cancer recurrence rates in groups A, B and C were 75.0% (9/12), 2.5% (1/40) and 44.4% (8/18) respectively, (χ(2)=31.1, P<0.01) and the cure rates were 25, 97.5 and 55.6% respectively (χ(2)=31.1, P<0.01). The mean survival times in groups A, B and C were 77.8, 106.1 and 111.0 months respectively, but significant difference was noted (χ(2)=3.2, P>0.05).

This was confirmed in a surgical series of 58 patients (34 with preoperatively normal and 24 with elevated serum calcitonin) where no calcitonin-positive cells were demonstrable immunohistochemically within separately investigated isthmi. Consequently, isthmus-preserving total bilateral lobectomy (IPTB) may be regarded as an adequate surgical procedure for C-cell hyperplasia (CCH).;IPTB was performed from October 2001 to December 2004 in 64 patients, 59 patients with nodular goiter and slightly to moderately elevated serum calcitonin (stimulated under 500 pg/ml) (group A, apparently sporadic cases) and in 5 patients undergoing prophylactic surgery for hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) with intermediate- or low-risk RET mutations (non-634) (group B). The surgical procedure focused on meticulous total extracapsular resection of both thyroid lobes, preservation of an isthmus remnant of about 3 ml (smaller in children), and histologic workup of the border zones of resection in addition to that of the completely removed lobes. When malignancy could be proven intraoperatively (7 patients) or when the isthmus turned out to contain nodular lesions (4 patients), completion total thyroidectomy (plus lymphadenectomy) was performed as a one-stage procedure. Second-stage total thyroidectomy was performed in 3 cases. Thus, IPTB was the definitive surgical procedure in 50 patients (45 of group A and all 5 of group B).;In all of the 50 definite IPTB cases, postoperative serum calcitonin was below the measurable limit (2 pg/ml); stimulated calcitonin was below the measurable limit in 47 (including all of group B) and was measurable in 3 sporadic cases in a lower-normal range between 2.4 and 3.5 pg/ml. Genetic screening of the apparently sporadic cases with CCH was positive in one (codon 791). The risk of recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis seems not to be elevated (0% permanent); permanent hypocalcemia occurred in 1 patient (2%). Follow-up data of 37 patients, median 18 (6-36) months, showed continuously nonmeasurable serum calcitonin with one exception, where it was in the normal range after 18 months. All IPTB patients are still under substitution therapy with L-thyroxine (median 125 mug/day) with decreasing tendency in all 3 children after prophylactic operation, the latter also showing an increasing volume of well-vascularized isthmi (from 1.5 to 2.5 ml).;IPTB reliably removes all C cells. There may not be need for total thyroidectomy (TTx) in cases with CCH. When necessary, completion TTx can be performed easily without additional risk. IPTB leaves a functionally relevant remnant, corresponding to that of a subtotal resection. This might be of importance especially for prophylactic surgery in children where the isthmus can compensate for the loss of thyroid function with time.",

Following cervicotomy and exposition of the thyroid gland, vital blue dye was injected into the malignant thyroid nodule. Subsequently, total thyroidectomy and lymph node dissection were carried out, and the thyroid, the SLN(s) and the other lymph nodes were sent for frozen section and definitive histologic evaluation.;Intraoperative lymphatic mapping located sentinel lymph nodes in 74 cases (67.3%); the SLN was detected in the laterocervical compartment (LC) in 4 cases (5.4%), with the ''sick'' of the CC.

Excess relative risk is important, being 7.7 for 1 Gy delivered to the thyroid gland during childhood. The risk of thyroid tumours is modified by several factors: a) age at exposure: in childhood, the risk decreases with increasing age at exposure and is not significant after 20 years; b) gender: females are two times more likely than males to develop thyroid tumours; c) genetic predisposition due to a defect in DNA repair mechanisms, and dietary and hormonal factors may modify the risk; d) the influence of fractionation and dose rate is not well established. Radioiodine 131 (1311) used for medical purposes has almost no tumourigenic effect on the adult thyroid gland. The consequences of the Chernobyl accident have clearly shown that the risk of thyroid cancer after exposure to 1311 in childhood is important, and that such exposure should be prevented by potassium iodine prophylaxis.

        "Doc_abstract":"Define a specific therapeutic for spinal metastasis from thyroidal origin.;A retrospective series of 37 patients treated between January 1978 and January 1993 was made. The sex ratio was 29 women for 8 men with an average age of 59.5. The prevalent histology has a vesicular type (19 cases which represents 51 per cent). The metastasis are mostly found at the dorsal level (48.6).;The different parameters analysed for this study of 37 patients were: invaded segment of the vertebra (anterior, middle, posterior or total), Tokuhashi score, epiduritis extent, patient age, histological type and iodiosensibility.;Out of 37 patients, 3 were lost for follow-up, 7 metastasis were treated carcinologically (\"en bloc\" resection). 30 were treated palliatively depending on the clinical symptoms: neurological, mechanical, or pain. The osseous metastasis exists in 56 per cent of the cases at the time the primitive neoplasy was discovered, and their presence burdens the final prognostic. 21 patients died with an average survival of 21 months, 13 patients survived with a mean follow-up of 50 months, 50 per cent of the patients had a vertebra totally involved with only 13 patients with neurological signs (4 Frankel A, 3 Frankel B, 4 Frankel C and 2 Frankel D).;The analysis of the results shows that the pejorative criteria in case of vertebral metastasis of thyroidal cancer are the score of Tokuhashi inferior to 7, the whole affected vertebra, the epiduritis on 3 levels, the age of the patient superior to 65 and the idiosensibility of the metastase. The surgery do called carcinological gives very good results with 5 surviving patients out of 7.;When reading this study it seems that, in front of vertebral metastasis from thyroidal origin, we should choose the most radical therapeutic attitude as much as possible. This strategy finds its justification by the fact that the thyroidal cancer spreads out slowly giving a survivorship superior to 12 months in case of metastatic vertebral affection. The importance of the tumoral reduction is connected with the efficiency of the iodiotherapy (for differentiated histological types). This is a considerable adjuvant treatment for this kind of cancer.",

This study compared the efficacies of rhTSH and thyroid hormone withdrawal (THW) to prepare patients at high risk of relapse for RA.;Post-thyroidectomy patients with WDTC and complete tumor resection (n = 275) were studied. They were at high risk of recurrence (tumor size >4 cm and/or extrathyroidal extension [pT3] and/or lymph node metastases), and they did not have antithyroglobulin (Tg) antibodies. Group A (n = 77) received 0.9 mg rhTSH for 2 consecutive days followed by RA on day 3. The remaining 198 patients (group B) were prepared by THW for 4 weeks.

We performed limited resection (Hr0) in 28 patients, subsegmentectomy (HrS) in 25 patients, segmentectomy (Hr1) in 21 patients, and lobectomy or extended lobectomy (Hr2) in 25 patients. The patients were divided into two groups: group A, 86 patients with tumors smaller than 1 kg and no tumor thrombi in the main portal trunk; and group B, 13 patients with a tumor 1 kg or larger, or with macroscopic tumor thrombi in the main portal trunk. In group A, mean blood loss was 838 ml for Hr0, 1948 ml for HrS, 1765 ml for Hr1, and 1325 ml for Hr2. The mean operative time in group A ranged from 3 h 43 min for Hr0 to 4 h 57 min for Hr2. In group B, the mean operative time was 6 h 3 min and mean blood loss was 6053 ml. Our MTC method was associated with an in-hospital mortality rate of 3% and a major complication rate of 13.1%. The 5-year survival and disease-free survival rates were 43.4% and 25.4%, respectively. The 5-year survival rate of patients without portal tumor thrombi (50.9%) was significantly better than that of patients with portal tumor thrombi (11.9%) (P < 0.001). The 5-year survival rate of patients who underwent curative resection (58.1%) was significantly better than that of patients who underwent noncurative resection (22.9%) (P < 0.001). The 5-year survival rates of patients in group A without portal tumor thrombi did not differ between those who had cancer-negative margins (54.0%) and those with cancerpositive margins (49.6%) at resection. Recurrence and local recurrence rates did not differ in patients with cancer-positive margins (63.6% and 7.3%, respectively) and patients with cancer-negative margins (56.5% and 8.7%, respectively). These results suggested that microscopic residual cancer in the resected margin was coagulated by MTC. Blood loss, operative time, and clinical outcome in this series of 99 consecutive hepatectomies were comparable with values in earlier reports in which such hemostatic methods as the Pringle maneuver were used. We conclude that hepatectomy with MTC is useful and safe and produces consistent results.",

We hypothesized that large thyroid nodule size does not contribute to the risk of malignancy or the risk of a false-negative FNA.;All thyroid FNAs performed at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center during September 2001-August 2011 were reviewed. A strict correlation between the biopsy site, location, and size of nodule on ultrasound (US) and pathology report was ensured. FNA results were classified as benign, atypical, follicular neoplasm/suspicious for follicular neoplasm (FN/SFN), suspicious for malignancy (SM), or malignant, and the pathology result was categorized as either benign or malignant. Nodules were analyzed by size: 0.5-0.9 cm (group A), 1.0-3.9 cm (group B), and ≥ 4 cm (group C). Incidental thyroid cancer was not included.;Of 3013 patients undergoing FNA, 667 (22.1%) had surgery. Patients were excluded for nodules <0.5 cm, nondiagnostic FNA, or no preoperative US, leaving 540 patients with 695 nodules. Among patients referred for surgery, FNA results were benign in 417 nodules (60%), atypical in 22 (3.2%), FN/SFN in 122 (17.6%), SM in 77 (11.1%), and malignant in 57 (8.2%). Postoperative malignancy rates by FNA result were 7% if benign, 4.5% if atypical, 23% if FN/SFN, 33.8% if SM, and 78.9% if malignant. FNA accuracy was 60% in group A, 68.5% in group B, and 80.3% in group C (p=0.01). False-negative rates for FNA were 7.0% overall, 15.8% in group A, 6.3% in group B, and 7.1% in group C (p=0.25). Sensitivity and negative predictive value were highest in group B at 81.6% and 93.7%, respectively. The prevalence of malignancy was not different between groups.;Our results show that the thyroid nodule size ≥ 4 cm increases neither the risk of false-negative FNA results, nor the overall risk of malignancy. We also show a tendency toward a higher false-negative rate in subcentimeter nodules. We conclude that a large nodule size should not prompt automatic referral for thyroidectomy. An increased awareness of potential sampling error in subcentimeter nodules is warranted.",

As time advanced, ratio of papillary carcinoma (PTC) to follicular carcinoma (FTC) increased (A:B:C = 1.6: 3.1: 7.2). The mean size of the primary tumour decreased (A:B:C = 3.5 cm: 2.8 cm: 2.5 cm), with a greater percentage of microcarcinoma of 1 cm or less (A:B:C = 5.1%: 16.1%: 21.7%). At presentation, the incidence of lymph-node metastasis decreased (A:B:C = 32.7%: 31.6%: 24.8%) and that of distant metastasis decreased (A:B:C = 9%: 6.1%: 5.3%). Bilateral surgical resection was more commonly used (A:B:C = 62.8%: 89.1%: 94.8%) than lobectomy (A:B:C = 26.3%: 2.8%: 1.8%). Radiation treatment, radioactive iodine (131I; RAI) and external radiotherapy (EXT), was more commonly used (A:B:C = 53.2%: 74.7%: 85.1%). RAI was used in 84.3% (A:B:C = 50%: 71.2%: 84.3%) and EXT in 14.5% of patients in the past decade (A:B:C = 10.9%: 8.7%: 14.5%). The proportion of patients who adopted a bilateral surgery and RAI treatment increased gradually with time (A:B:C = 33%: 68%: 83.8%). The 5-year cause-specific survival (A:B:C = 90.2%: 93.7%: 95.7%), locoregional failure-free survival (A:B:C = 72.6%: 82.9%: 91.6%) and distant metastasis failure-free survival (A:B:C = 84.5%: 89.1%: 92.6%) were improved. However, the period of diagnosis was not found to be an important explanatory variable (i.e. P > 0.05) in Cox regression after adjusting for other factors, indicating that the improvement was probably related to the temporal trend of other factors: presentation at earlier stage, increased ratio of PTC:FTC and more aggressive management by bilateral surgery and radiation therapy.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Traditionally, total thyroidectomy was performed through an open transcervical incision; in cases where there was evident nodal metastasis, the conventional surgical approach was to extend the incision into a large single transverse incision to complete the required neck dissection. However, recent innovation in the surgical technique of thyroidectomy has offered the opportunity to reduce the patient's burden from these prominent surgical scars in the neck. Minimally invasive surgical techniques have been developed and applied by many institutions worldwide, and more recently, various techniques of remote access surgery have been suggested and actively applied.1-6 Since the advent of robotic surgical systems, some have adopted the concept of remote access surgery into developing various robotic thyroidectomy techniques. The more former and widely acknowledged robotic thyroidectomy technique uses a transaxillary (TA) approach, which has been developed by Chung et al. in Korea.7,8 This particular technique has some limitations in the sense that accessing the lymph nodes of the central compartment is troublesome. Terris et al. realized some shortcomings of robotic TA thyroidectomy, especially in their patients in the United States, and developed and reported the feasibility of robotic facelift thyroidectomy.9-13 In cases of thyroid carcinomas with lateral neck node metastases, most abandoned the concept of minimally invasive or remote access surgery and safely adopted conventional open surgical methods to remove the tumor burden. However, Chung et al. have attempted to perform concomitant modified radical neck dissection (MRND) after robotic thyroidectomy through the same TA port.14 This type of robot-assisted neck dissection (RAND) had some inherent limitations, due to fact that lymph nodes of the upper neck were difficult to remove. Over the past few years, we have developed a RAND via modified facelift (MFL) or retroauricular (RA) approach and reported the feasibility and safety of this technique.15, 16 Since then, we have actively applied such RAND techniques in various head and neck cancers. In our country, almost all cases of robotic total thyroidectomy utilize the TA approach. According to the reports made by Terris et al., robotic facelift thyroidectomy technique has been solely applied for ipsilateral hemithyroidectomy. For total thyroidectomy, Terris et al. performed the robotic surgery with bilateral RA incisions. Here, we intend to introduce our novel surgical method after successfully attempting simultaneous robotic total thyroidectomy and RAND via a single RA approach without an axillary incision. To our knowledge, this is the first to report in the medical literature.;We present four cases of our surgical experience since the beginning of 2013. All patients received robotic total thyroidectomy with MRND via single RA port without axillary incision after approval from the institutional review board at Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine. The inclusion criteria for this operation were as follows: (1) patients with malignant carcinomas of the thyroid gland with evident cervical lymph node metastasis on preoperative imaging studies which are indicated for surgery; (2) patients with no previous history of treatment for thyroid carcinoma. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients with recurred thyroid tumors; (2) patients with thyroid carcinomas that showed gross invasion to local structures or extensive extrathyroidal capsular spread; (3) patients with clinically evident neck nodal metastasis with extracapsular spread; (4) patients with past history of neck surgery of any kind. In order to assess the extent of disease, neck ultrasonography with fine needle aspiration, neck CT or MRI and PET-CT were performed as preoperative evaluation. All patients were given full information of the possible treatment options for their thyroid cancer comprising of open transcervical approach and robotic surgery via RA approach, including the advantages and disadvantages of each treatment choice and provided written, informed consents before the surgery. General clinical information of the patients is outlined in Table 1. The skin incision for the operation was designed just like the approach for robotic facelift thyroidectomy by Terris et al. and RAND, which has been first reported by our institution.11 (,) 16 The operation was performed by the following sequence. Initially, the skin-subplatysmal flap was elevated after making the skin incision to create sufficient working space. During this process, the elevated skin flap was retracted and maintained by retractors held by the assistant. After application of the self-retaining retractor (Sangdosa Inc., Seoul), neck dissection of the upper neck levels was performed under gross vision. Next, RAND through the RA incision was conducted followed by ipsilateral thyroidectomy with central compartment neck dissection (CCND) via the same approach. Finally, contralateral thyroidectomy with CCND was performed via the single RA port. During these steps, the operator is aided by the bedside assistant with long-suction tips to manipulate and direct the dissected specimen to maintain optimal surgical view or to suck out the fume created by the thermocoagulation from the Harmonic shears. The da Vinci robotic surgical system (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA) was introduced via the RA port with a facedown 30° dual-channel endoscopic arm placed in the center, and two instrument arms equipped at either side with 5-mm Maryland forceps and Harmonic curved shears. During the step of robotic contralateral thyroidectomy, a ProGrasp forceps was utilized at times, instead of 5-mm Maryland forceps. The rest of the surgery was completed with the robotic system (see Video for demonstration of operation for patient 2).

The total operation time was defined as the time from initial skin incision to removal of the final specimen, which was an average 306.1 ± 11.1 min (Table 2). This included the time for skin flap elevation and neck dissection under gross vision (87 ± 2.8 min), setting up the robotic system for RAND (6.8 ± 2.4 min), console time using the robotic system for RAND (59.3 ± 2.2 min), flap elevation for thyroidectomy (11.3 ± 2.5 min), robotic arms docking for ipsilateral thyroidectomy (6.3 ± 2.5 min), console time for ipsilateral thyroidectomy (61.3 ± 2.1 min), robotic arms docking for contralateral thyroidectomy (6.3 ± 2.5 min), and console time for contralateral thyroidectomy (61.8 ± 2.1 min). The working space created from RA incision was sufficient, and manipulations of the robotic instruments through this approach were technically feasible and safe without any mutual collisions throughout the entire operation. It also allowed for an excellent magnified surgical view enabling visualization of important local anatomical structures. There was no postoperative vocal cord palsy due to recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. However, two patients developed transient hypoparathyroidism, which resolved in the end without the need for calcium or vitamin D supplementation after certain period of medical management (Table 3). Also, there was no incidence of postoperative hemorrhage or hematoma formation, although a single patient developed a postoperative seroma on postoperative day 9, which was managed conservatively without the need for further surgical intervention. On average, the wound catheter was removed 6.8 ± 1 days after surgery and the patient was discharged from the hospital at an average 11 ± 2.8 days from admission (Table 1). Final surgical pathology confirmed the diagnosis of papillary carcinoma for every patient. The total number of cervical nodes retrieved from CCND and MRND was 9.8 ± 4 and 33.1 ± 11 respectively, and the number of positive metastatic nodes was 3 ± 1.4 and 7.3 ± 1.7 respectively (Table 1). In three patients (patients 2, 3, and 4), the presence of one parathyroid gland was each verified in the pathology specimen. All four patients have received high-dose (150 mCi) radioiodine ablation (RAI) therapy after the operation and are being followed up (average 11.3 months, range 9-13 months) on a regular basis with no evidence of recurrence (post-RAI, most recent, nonsuppressed thyroglobulin range 0.1-0.4 ng/ml, antithyroglobulin antibody range 13.7-147.5 IU/ml).

        "Doc_abstract":"Well under 15% of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) is diagnosed at < or =18 years of age. The population is heterogenous and the differences between prepubertal children and pubertals and adolescents are to be considered. Although very little has been reported on children with sporadic DTC under the age of 10 years, juvenile DTC has at least some undeniable differences with adult DTC: (1) larger primary tumor at diagnosis; (2) metastatic pattern and features, namely: (a) greater prevalence of neck lymph node and distant metastases at diagnosis, (b) lungs almost the sole distant metastatic site, (c) pulmonary metastases nearly always functional; (3) closer-to-normal and more frequent sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) expression; and (4) higher recurrence rate but longer overall survival. These differences are especially distinct in prepubertal children. The goals of primary treatment of juvenile DTC are to eradicate disease and extend not only overall, but recurrence-free survival (RFS). Extending RFS is itself a desirable goal in children because it improves quality-of-life, alleviates anxiety during psychologically formative years, reduces medical resource consumption, and may increase overall survival. Primary treatment of DTC generally comprises a combination of surgery, radioiodine ((131)I) ablation, and thyroid hormone therapy applied at varying levels of intensity. Therapeutic decision-making must rely on retrospective adult and/or pediatric outcome studies and on treatment guidelines formulated mostly for adults. Differences between juvenile and adult DTC and physiology dictate distinct treatment strategies for children. We, and many others, advocate a routine intensive approach because of the more advanced disease at diagnosis, propensity for recurrence, and greater radioiodine responsiveness in children, as well as published evidence of significant survival benefits, especially regarding RFS. This intensive approach consists of total thyroidectomy and central lymphadenectomy in all cases, completed by modified lateral lymphadenectomy when necessary and followed by radioiodine administration. However, absence of prospective studies and of universal proof of overall cause-specific survival benefits of this approach have led some to propose more conservative strategies. Most European centers give radioiodine ablation to the vast majority of juvenile DTC patients. Ablation seeks to destroy any residual cancer, including microfoci, as well as healthy thyroid remnant. Large studies have documented the procedure to decrease cause-specific death rates and, in children, to significantly lessen locoregional recurrence rates (by factors of 2-11) independent of the extent of surgery. There is universal agreement on treating inoperable functional metastases with large radioiodine activities. Treatment is especially effective in small tumor foci up to 1 cm in diameter, and should be administered every 6-12 months until complete response, loss of functionality, or attainment of cumulative activities between 18.5-37 GBq (500-1000 mCi). Radioiodine therapy is generally safe. Short-term side effects include nausea and vomiting (more frequent in children than in adults), transient neck pain and edema, sialadenitis (<5% incidence), mild myelosuppression (approximately 25%), transient impairment of gonadal function both in females and males (sperm quality in boys), or nasolacrimal obstruction (approximately 3%), with most cases generally being asymptomatic-moderate, self-limiting, or easily prevented or treated. If pregnancy is ruled out before each (131)I administration, and conception avoided in the year afterward, radioiodine therapy appears not to impair fertility. However, therapeutic (131)I carries a small but definite increase in cancer risk, particularly in the salivary glands, colon, rectum, soft tissue and bone. To better guide primary treatment, different therapeutic combinations should be prospectively compared using RFS as the primary endpoint. Efforts also should be made to identify molecular signatures predicting recurrence, metastasis and mortality."},

Additionally, remnant volume (V) was determined prior to therapy. Group A consisted of 33 patients with supposed successful ablation of DTC. These patients received 370 MBq 131I for diagnostic use and served as controls. 58 patients (group B) with remnants, relapses and metastases received 370 MBq 123I for diagnostics prior to therapy with 1.5-22.2 GBq 131I. Factors influencing individual changes in urinary iodine excretion (deltaUIE) were investigated by using non-parametric tests.;In group A UIE did not change significantly after application of 131I. As well, UIE remained unchanged after diagnostic application of 123I in group B. In contrast, UIE increased significantly already 24 h after therapeutic application of 131I in this group. In patients with small remnants (V < 2.5 ml) a significant but only moderate increase of UIE could be observed (average increase: 47 microg I/g crea). In patients with larger remnants, with relapses or metastases increase of UIE values was significant and more pronounced.;It was confirmed that UIE increased significantly during radioiodine therapy in patients with DTC and radioiodine-accumulating tissue. The increase of UIE after therapeutic administration of radioiodine can be explained by the disintegrated thyroid follicles in thyroid remnants. The radioiodine-induced iodine release may be one reason for thyroid \"stunning\" even after application of diagnostic amounts of 131I.",

The patients were divided into three groups: patients who had undergone TT alone (group A), TT with ipsilateral CND (group B), and TT with bilateral CND (group C).;The respective incidences of transient hypoparathyroidism and unilateral recurrent nerve injury were 12.6% and 1% in group A, 23.3% and 3.3% in B, and 36.7% and 0% in C. Node metastases were observed in 8.7% in group A, 23.3% in B, and 63.3% in C. Locoregional recurrence was observed in 3.9% of patients in group A and in 0% in B and C.;We found no statistically significant differences in the rates of locoregional recurrence between the three groups. Therefore, TT appears to be an adequate treatment for these patients; CND is associated with higher rates of transient hypoparathyroidism and cannot be considered the treatment of choice even if it could help for more appropriate selection of patients for RAI. Ipsilateral CND could be an interesting option considering the lower rate of hypocalcemia to be validated by further studies.",

None of the tumors proved fatal within 6 months, and most responded to radioiodine therapy. Although no differences in survival between the two groups were found, a significantly (p < 0.01) higher percentage of recurrences or distant metastases was observed with Group A tumors.

About 1 in 10 patients experience temporary laryngeal nerve injury after surgery, with longer lasting voice problems in up to 1 in 25. Reduced quality of life after thyroid surgery is multifactorial and may include the need for lifelong medication, thyroid suppression, radioactive scanning/treatment, temporary and permanent hypoparathyroidism, temporary or permanent dysphonia postoperatively, and dysphagia. This clinical practice guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for management of the patient's voice when undergoing thyroid surgery during the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative period.;The purpose of this guideline is to optimize voice outcomes for adult patients aged 18 years or older after thyroid surgery. The target audience is any clinician involved in managing such patients, which includes but may not be limited to otolaryngologists, general surgeons, endocrinologists, internists, speech-language pathologists, family physicians and other primary care providers, anesthesiologists, nurses, and others who manage patients with thyroid/voice issues. The guideline applies to any setting in which clinicians may interact with patients before, during, or after thyroid surgery. Children under age 18 years are specifically excluded from the target population; however, the panel understands that many of the findings may be applicable to this population. Also excluded are patients undergoing concurrent laryngectomy. Although this guideline is limited to thyroidectomy, some of the recommendations may extrapolate to parathyroidectomy as well.;The guideline development group made a strong recommendation that the surgeon should identify the recurrent laryngeal nerve(s) during thyroid surgery. The group made recommendations that the clinician or surgeon should (1) document assessment of the patient's voice once a decision has been made to proceed with thyroid surgery; (2) examine vocal fold mobility, or refer the patient to a clinician who can examine vocal fold mobility, if the patient's voice is impaired and a decision has been made to proceed with thyroid surgery; (3) examine vocal fold mobility, or refer the patient to a clinician who can examine vocal fold mobility, once a decision has been made to proceed with thyroid surgery if the patient's voice is normal and the patient has (a) thyroid cancer with suspected extrathyroidal extension, or (b) prior neck surgery that increases the risk of laryngeal nerve injury (carotid endarterectomy, anterior approach to the cervical spine, cervical esophagectomy, and prior thyroid or parathyroid surgery), or (c) both; (4) educate the patient about the potential impact of thyroid surgery on voice once a decision has been made to proceed with thyroid surgery; (5) inform the anesthesiologist of the results of abnormal preoperative laryngeal assessment in patients who have had laryngoscopy prior to thyroid surgery; (6) take steps to preserve the external branch of the surperior laryngeal nerve(s) when performing thyroid surgery; (7) document whether there has been a change in voice between 2 weeks and 2 months following thyroid surgery; (8) examine vocal fold mobility or refer the patient for examination of vocal fold mobility in patients with a change in voice following thyroid surgery; (9) refer a patient to an otolaryngologist when abnormal vocal fold mobility is identified after thyroid surgery; (10) counsel patients with voice change or abnormal vocal fold mobility after thyroid surgery on options for voice rehabilitation. The group made an option that the surgeon or his or her designee may monitor laryngeal electromyography during thyroid surgery.

        "Doc_abstract":"Primary thyroid lymphoma is a rare disease that continues to produce diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas. There was great difficulty in distinguishing thyroid lymphoma from anaplastic thyroid carcinoma but, because of new immunocytochemical staining techniques and increased cytopathologic knowledge, our ability to diagnose thyroid lymphoma has improved drastically over the past decade. Surgery that was once the mainstay of treatment for this disease, now plays a minimal role. Current treatment regimens for primary thyroid lymphoma consist of chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) and external beam radiation. The overall and distant relapse rates have been shown to be significantly lower in those patients receiving combined modality therapy compared to chemotherapy or radiation alone. Although the role of surgery has changed over time, it continues to play an important role, especially in confirming diagnoses through open biopsies, potentially providing local control in the more indolent subtypes, and may play a role in the palliation of symptoms for large obstructive lymphomas. The evolving classification of extranodal lymphomas has brought about a better understanding of the biologic behavior of these tumors. Most thyroid lymphomas are B-cell origin, with six different histologic subtypes, but there appears to be two distinct clinical and prognostic groupings of these rare tumors. The more indolent lymphomas are the subgroup of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas comprising approximately 6% to 27% of thyroid lymphomas. This subgroup, when localized to the thyroid (stage IE), responds well to total thyroidectomy or radiation with a complete response rate of more than 90%, leading some authors to recommend surgery as primary therapy in the treatment of localized MALT lymphomas. Therefore, surgery as a primary treatment for thyroid lymphomas would only be recommended under ideal conditions, such as MALT subtype stage IE only, and completely resectable with minimal morbidity. Unfortunately, this scenario is rarely the case. The more common subtype, comprising up to 70% of cases, is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. This subtype appears to have the most aggressive clinical course with almost 60% of these tumors diagnosed with disseminated disease. Up to 40% of all diffuse large cell lymphomas appear to have undergone transformation from a MALT lymphoma, but they behave in a similar fashion to diffuse large cell lymphomas. Treatment for these tumors should include chemotherapy and radiation. The overall 5-year survival for this aggressive group is less then 50%. Surgery is rarely beneficial in diffuse large cell lymphoma and the mixed large cell subtypes because the disease is generally disseminated and surgical excision of all disease is not possible or associated with increased morbidity. However, there may be a role for palliative surgical debulking to alleviate obstructive symptoms while the patient is undergoing standard chemotherapy and radiation.",

However, there is a paucity of data that would provide an evidence basis for recommendations to hypothyroid patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the specific neurological and psychological deficits consequent to hypothyroidism and whether they are of sufficient magnitude to impede the safe operation of motor vehicles.;Repeated measurements were obtained in euthyroid, hypothyroid, and euthyroid hormone replaced states of thyroid cancer outpatients, at an academic medical center, who underwent thyroid hormone withdrawal preparation for radioiodine scanning. Study design used a within-subjects longitudinal \"A-B-A\" with each subject tested at three visits in the same sequence: euthyroid, hypothyroid, and euthyroid for a total of 32 subjects. Data on clinical status and cognitive performance were collected using standard instruments, including ThyDQoL and ThySRQ measures, National Adult Reading Test, Boston Naming Test, Mini-Mental State Exam, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Test-Revised, Letter Fluency FAS, and Beck Depression Inventory. Fine-motor function was measured with an automated assessment panel, and driving performance on a commercial driving simulator.;In severe hypothyroidism (median thyrotropin 83.2 mIU/L), fine-motor performance of hands and reaction times in emergency braking tests were slowed, as well as subjective slowing reported on structured clinical scales. Depression was present, typified by vegetative and mood alterations, but lacking reported guilt and lowered self-esteem seen in other types of depression. Cognitive impairment was characterized by declines on speeded executive tests. In contrast, episodic memory performance improved over time regardless of thyroid hormone status. Braking times increased in hypothyroidism by 8.5%, equivalent to reports of effects from a blood alcohol level of 0.082 g/100 mL (above the U.S. legal driving limit).;Transient profound hypothyroidism is characterized by reversible depression, decreased fine-motor performance, slowed reaction times, and decreased processing speed. These data represent new empirical evidence that support the recommendation that complex activities requiring rapid responses, such as operating motor vehicles, should be avoided during hypothyroidism. This has broader implications regarding functional impairments and risk to public health.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Determination of thyrotropin (TSH) by sensitive immunometric assays is currently judged as the most sensitive and also most cost-effective first-line approach to thyroid function testing. Further improvement of assay sensitivity has led to the description of third generation TSH assays with a functional sensitivity in the range of 0.01 to 0.02 mU/l. In the present study, we analyzed interassay precision profiles of a commercially available third generation assay (ACS:180 TSH-3) and documented the critical role of the time span used for the assessment of a method's functional sensitivity. By using a standardized approach with five serum pools measured in 30 different runs across a 6-week period, functional sensitivity was calculated as 0.015 mU/l. The TSH concentrations measured by two different third generation assays (ACS: 180 TSH-3 and Elecsys TSH) in samples from healthy blood donors were highly correlated (r = 0.76, n = 252). In some samples, however, discordant results were obtained. Euthyroid reference intervals were determined as 0.30-3.68 mU/l for the ACS:180 TSH-3 assay and as 0.36-3.64 mU/l for the Elecsys TSH assay. Reevaluation of reference intervals including only TPOAb or TgAb negative samples resulted in almost the same reference ranges. Measuring TSH concentrations in various patient populations, third generation assay turned out to be advantageous in the following clinical situations. (a) In patients with mildly suppressed but well detectable TSH concentrations due to functional thyroid autonomy (0.03-0.3 mU/l), overt hyperthyroidism can be excluded by third generation TSH measurement alone without the need of additional thyroid hormone measurements; (b) in patients receiving long term suppressive T4 treatment after thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid cancer, measurement of basal TSH by third generation assays allow accurate monitoring of hormone therapy without the need for TRH testing; (c) in most patients with severe nonthyroidal illnesses and decreased TSH levels, TSH concentrations measured by third generation assays are only moderately suppressed and can be clearly discriminated from undetectable levels in overt hyperthyroidism. In conclusion, the use of third generation TSH assays is recommended in specialized clinical laboratories frequently analyzing samples taken in one of those clinical situations.",

All patients had previously undergone total thyroidectomy and radioiodine ablation/therapy.

Extrathyroidal spread was an independent risk factor related to FDG-avid recurrence. Tumor size was significantly higher in PET-positive patients than others, 2.25 (1.8) versus 1.5 (1.1) cm, P = 0.02. Significant correlation was observed between PET positivity and high Tg levels (P = 0.0001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated a Tg cutoff of 1.9 ng/mL under thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression, 38.2 ng/mL with thyroid-stimulating hormone stimulation. Among PET-negative patients, no recurrence was detected in patients with undetectable/suppressible Tg in on-therapy state.;PET positivity correlated with extrathyroidal spread, and elevated Tg in recurrent/metastatic DTC. FDG PET/CT in combination with Tg levels was crucial in defining management strategies in patients with DTC with negative 131I WBS. A negative FDG PET/CT scan predicts a favorable prognosis and lack of recurrence on follow-up in patients with \"suppressible Tg\" levels in the on-therapy state despite significant elevation of Tg in the off-therapy state.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The use of recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone (rhTSH) has recently become available as an alternative diagnostic tool to assess the persistence and recurrence of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) in patients on thyroid hormone-suppressive therapy (THST) after near-total or total thyroidectomy and ablative doses of (131)I. We report the results of rhTSH administration in patients who were monitored for DTC.;Thirty-three adult DTC patients (13 men, 20 women; mean age +/- SE, 45.6 +/- 2.31 y; age range, 21-65 y) underwent diagnostic follow-up after rhTSH administration at a dose of 0.9 mg once a day for 2 d. Whole-body scanning and serum thyroglobulin (Tg) measurement were performed after rhTSH administration. Patients were divided into 2 groups depending on serum Tg concentrations on THST: 29 patients had Tg concentrations of <2 ng/mL (group A) and 4 patients had Tg values of >2 ng/mL (group B).;In group A, Tg values remained at <2 ng/mL in 25 patients and increased from 1.1 +/- 0.14 ng/mL to 22.0 +/- 5.75 ng/mL (mean +/- SE) in 4 patients after rhTSH administration. Whole-body scanning did not reveal any uptake of (131)I in the 25 patients without an increase in Tg, whereas (131)I uptake was evident in 2 of the 4 patients with a rise in Tg. In group B, Tg values increased in all 4 patients from 17.3 +/- 6.35 ng/mL to 55.3 +/- 12.75 ng/mL, and (131)I uptake was evident in 3 of the 4 patients. No major adverse effects were reported after rhTSH administration.;Our results show that the measurement of serum Tg concentrations after rhTSH has a higher diagnostic value than whole-body scanning in detecting the persistence of thyroid tissue. Therefore, rhTSH should be administered in TSH-suppressed patients with basal serum Tg concentrations of <2 ng/mL because the increment in serum Tg concentrations may reveal the persistence of thyroid tissue in these patients.",

A review of the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre (KFSH & RC) experience was performed to assess treatment outcome and prognostic factors in this rare extranodal presentation of localized lymphoma. Sixty patients treated at KFSH & RC between 1975 and 1995 were identified, and their records were reviewed retrospectively. Eight patients who had stage III or IV disease, low grade, or did not complete their prescribed treatment were excluded from the study. There were 38 female and 14 male patients with a median age of 59.5 years at the time of diagnosis (range: 10-87 years). Thirty-five of the 52 patients underwent diagnostic partial or total thyroidectomy at other institutions based on a preoperative assumption of thyroid carcinoma. All 52 patients had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of intermediate (94%) or high (6%) grade. Detailed staging was carried out in all patients; 16 patients (31%) had disease confined to the thyroid gland (stage IE), whereas 36 (69%) had associated disease in cervical lymph nodes and/or the mediastinum (stage IIE) disease. All patients were treated with curative intent. A total of 18 patients (35%) were treated with a single-modality treatment--radiotherapy alone in 2, chemotherapy alone in 13, and surgery alone in the remaining 3 patients. The majority of patients (34/52; 65%) were treated with a combined-modality approach. The overall relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) at 5 years were 72% and 88%, respectively. There were no significant differences in outcome between those treated with single-modality and those with combined-modality therapy. A univariate analysis showed that the presence of mediastinal lymph node involvement was the most important prognostic factor affecting both RFS and OS. Patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis and without \"B\" symptoms were found to have a significantly higher RFS without influence on the OS. However, patients who had a good performance status (PS) of 0, 1, and 2 were found to have a significantly higher overall survival in comparison to those with poor performance status. Age, sex, stage, histology, lactic acid dehydrogenase level, tumor bulk, and the treatment modality were not found to correlate with RFS or OS. Mediastinal involvement and PS were found to be the most important independent prognostic factors influencing RFS and OS.",

        "Doc_abstract":"We report a series of B-cell neoplasms with regard to rearrangement of the BCL6 gene on chromosome band 3q27. Southern blot analysis using probes from the major translocation cluster (MTC) region of the BCL6 revealed rearrangement in 21/197 patients (10.7%) with B-cell neoplasms studied at presentation, and 11/25 patients (44%) first studied at relapse. In non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) studied at diagnosis, rearrangements of the BCL6 gene were not closely associated with a specific histopathologic subtype but distributed in subcategories in the Working Formulation. The incidence in follicular lymphoma was 12.1%, with significantly higher frequency in mixed and large cell subtypes, and that in diffuse aggressive lymphoma was 14.1%. Comigration analysis using probes from the immunoglobulin genes revealed association of the BCL6 gene with one of the three immunoglobulin loci in 9/25 cases analysed. A comparative study between NHL associated either with BCL2 or BCL6 rearrangement showed that advanced disease and bone marrow involvement were more frequent in BCL2(+) NHL. In contrast, extranodal involvement was more frequently observed in the BCL6(+) NHL. The survival curve of BCL6(+) NHL was characterized by a rapid decline followed by a plateau. Of the total of 32 BCL6(+) patients, six carried both BCL2 and BCL6 rearrangements; five of these six showed clinicopathological properties characteristic of follicular lymphoma, suggesting that the presence of the two genetic abnormalities does not necessarily have synergistic effects on malignant phenotypes. The high level of BCL6 expression in follicular lymphoma cell lines carrying a BCL2 rearrangement suggests that the deregulated BCL2 gene may have an effect on the development of genetic abnormalities of the BCL6 gene. The present study suggests that BCL6 gene rearrangement is primarily involved in large cell lymphoma irrespective of growth pattern of neoplastic cells, and that BCL6(+)BCL2(-) NHL could be curable with modern intensive chemotherapy.",

The role of MIBG for the location of neuroendocrine tumors. A) The range of tumors in which MIBG scintigraphy is effective (pheochromocytomas, neuroblastoma, chemodectoma and other APUDomas). B) The increasing popularity of 123I as a radiolabel for MIBG (potential advantages in planar and SPECT imaging). C) MIBG as the prototype of a family of radiopharmaceuticals exploiting the biogenic amine uptake and storage mechanisms. (Other radiohalides 124I, 125I, 87Br, 211At, 18F; other PET radiopharmaceuticals such as 11C-epinephrine, 11C-hydroxyephedrine). Theme 2. The role of MIBG as an in vivo scintigraphic probe of the sympathetic nervous system. A) Cardiac sympathetic innervation (in cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, and as a prognostic index for cardiac transplantation). B) Pulmonary MIBG uptake as index of pulmonary endothelial/sympathetic function (MIBG by both the intravenous and inhaled routes of administration). Theme 3. MIBG for the radiopharmaceutical therapy of neuroendocrine tumors. A) Treatment of neuroblastoma early in the natural history of the disease (MIBG therapy as initial management, MIBG therapy combined with other modalities--e.g., chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation). Theme 4. The role of radiolabeled somatostatin analogs for the location of neuroendocrine and other tumors. A) The range of tumors in which somatostatin receptor radiopharmaceutical scintigraphy is effective (pituitary tumors, central nervous system tumors, carcinoids, islet cell tumors, medullary thyroid carcinoma, small cell lung cancer, APUDomas). B) The superiority of 111In over 123I as a radiolabel (the future of potential 99mTc and other labels). C) Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy in autoimmune and other disorders. D) Pentetreotide as the prototype of a wide range of radiolabeled peptides as radiopharmaceuticals for the in vivo depiction of the receptors for peptide hormones, lymphokines, paracrine and other information transmitting molecules (the general concepts include the use of long-acting, slowly degraded analogs and the development of generally applicable labeling techniques. Examples include 123I-ANF, labeled interleukins and other lymphokines). Theme 5. Comparisons of MIBG and pentetreotide scintigraphy for the location of neuroendocrine tumors.

The group consisted of 120 cases of papillary type and 144 cases of follicular type; the mean age of the patients was 38.2 years for papillary and 46.5 for the follicular. The ratio men/women was 1/4 for the papillary and 1/3.2 for the follicular. The prognostic factors evaluated included: a) histologic types according to WHO classification, b) clinical stage, c) age and d) sex. The staging of the disease followed the classification suggested by Smendal, stage I: intraglandular disease; stage II: regional lymph node metastases; stage III: invasion of other tissues in the neck or mediastinum and stage IV: distant metastases. The basic treatment was surgery with the use of 131I and thyroid hormone. The results were statistically analyzed with the conventional life table method or chi square. At 15 years the overall survival was 84 +/- 4% for the papillary type and 66 +/- 9% for the follicular type (p = 0.01) (Fig. 1). The patients treated in stage I had a survival of 90 +/- 5%, significantly higher than those in stage II (53 +/- 8%), p less than 0.03. In stage III and IV the small number of patients made it difficult to interpret the results statistically (Fig. 2). The age of the patients appears to be another prognostic factor. The group under 40 years had 85 +/- 5% of survival compared to 59 +/- 4% over 40 years, p less than 0.01 (Fig. 3).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Since radiation can carry a known risk of mutagenic abnormalities, we decided to study the outcome of pregnancy in females with DTC and evaluate the genetic risks and health status of their offspring. We retrospectively studied the medical records of these patients in our Institute from 1999 to 2004. A total of 1110 women were hospitalized for treatment with high doses of (131)I, at least 3700MBq. During this period, 653 of these women were in their reproductive period. A hundred of them who had at least one pregnancy after (131)I treatment, were studied. These women had a total of 126 pregnancies (1-6 pregnancies each) after treatment and 101 pregnancies before treatment. We also reviewed the (131)I dose administered last, as well as the cumulative dose of (131)I. Our results show that the incidence of abortions before (131)I treatment was 16.83% (all were spontaneous abortions) and increased to 26.19% after (131)I treatment (15.87% induced and 10.3% spontaneous abortions). Spontaneous abortions were decreased. There was no significant difference between the mean last (131)I dose and the cumulative dose in patients with or without a history of abortions. Mean interval between the last dose of (131)I treatment and abortions versus the last dose and live child births showed a significant difference. All children had normal birth weight. Three congenital anomalies: Down's syndrome, cardiac abnormalities and macrocephaly were diagnosed. Three episodes of intrauterine death were also recorded. In conclusion, our findings indicate that in women with DTC, treated with high doses of(131)I: a) There was no evidence of increased spontaneous abortions, b) Increasing the interval between the last dose of (131)I treatment and time to pregnancy might be beneficial for decreasing the entire risk of abortions and c) It appears that (131)I treatment had no obvious adverse effects on the risk of congenital anomalies.",

Owners who did not want their dogs to receive treatment were placed into the control group A (GA; n=10). The remaining dogs were randomly placed into either group B (GB; n=12) and received doxorubicin at a dose of 30 mg/m(2) every three weeks, for six complete cycles or group C (GC; n=15) and treated with RA9-cis at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day for 6 months. The time of the recurrence was significantly shorter in the GA and GB compared to GC (P=0.0007; P=0.0015 respectively), while we did not detect differences between GA and GB. The hazard ratio of recurrence between GA and GB compared to GC were 7.25 and 5.60 times shorter, respectively. We did not detect any differences between the other groups. The risk ratio of recurrence was 2.0 times higher in GA compared to GC and 2.1 times higher in GB compared to GC. The type of carcinoma had an effect on time of survival with follicular carcinomas having an increased mean survival time than follicular-compact carcinomas (P<0.0001) and follicular-compact carcinomas had a longer mean survival time than compact carcinomas. The interaction among treatment and type was significant, but survival time in follicular carcinomas did not differ between treatments. In follicular-compact carcinomas the survival time of GC was greater than GB (P<0.05), but we did not detect a difference between GA and GB. In conclusion, this study shows that the use of surgery in combination with RA9-cis treatment significantly increases survival rate and decreases the time to tumor recurrence when compared to doxorubicin treated or untreated dogs. The histological type of carcinoma interacted with treatment for time to recurrence and survival time, with more undifferentiated carcinomas having a worse prognosis than differentiated carcinomas.
