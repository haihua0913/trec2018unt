        "Doc_abstract":"Systemic targeted molecular therapy, in the form of a selective BRAF inhibitor with or without a MEK inhibitor, is a standard treatment for patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma with unresectable stage III and IV disease. Patients with BRAF mutation-negative primary tumors may manifest BRAF mutation-positive metastatic disease. It is unclear whether all metastatic lesions carry the same BRAF mutation status found in the primary tumor and if discordancy exists, in what frequency it occurs. Primary and matched metastatic lesions in 25 melanoma patients were tested for the BRAF V600E/Ec, V600K, V600D, and V600R mutations using a BRAF RGQ PCR kit (Qiagen). Four patients (16%) had discrepancies between their primary and metastatic melanoma BRAF status. Of these patients, 2 (8%) had BRAF mutation-positive primary melanomas with BRAF mutation-negative metastatic lesions and 2 (8%) patient had BRAF mutation-negative melanoma with a BRAF mutation-positive metastatic lesion. In summary, discordancy of BRAF mutation status is not an infrequent finding between primary and metastatic melanoma. It may be prudent in previously negative patients to determine BRAF mutation status of new metastatic tumors for proper allocation of BRAF inhibitor therapy. Discordant BRAF status may have a role in the varying patterns of response and inevitable resistance seen with BRAF inhibitor therapies. ",

Nevertheless, BRAF oncogene mutation status between different samples from the same patient has been studied with conflicting results. This study investigated the intrapatient homogeneity of BRAF mutation status using pyrosequencing in primary tumors and different metastatic sites of melanoma patients. Paired samples of lymphatic, visceral, and subcutaneous metastases and primary melanoma from 45 metastatic melanoma patients were tested for BRAF mutations using a pyrosequencing assay and by Sanger sequencing. Overall, sequencing for BRAF mutation status was performed in 114 paired samples from 45 patients. Eighteen patients (40%) carried a BRAF mutation, including BRAF V600E (12/18), BRAF V600K (5/18), and BRAF V600R (1/18) mutations. Multiple BRAF mutations (V600E and V600K) were found in one patient. Among the patients with BRAF mutations, a good agreement in BRAF mutation status was found between the first and second tumor samples genotyped (91%; Cohen's κ coefficient: 0.81). Discordance in BRAF mutation status was found only in four patients, involving all three patients in whom sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases were sampled. These SLNs exhibited a wild-type genotype and were discordant with the other BRAF-mutated samples found in the same patient. The intrapatient BRAF status was predominantly homogeneous. However, SLN genotyping using pyrosequencing might be inaccurate in determining the actual mutation status of melanoma. Further studies are required to confirm the lack of reliability of SLN. ",

The purpose of this study was to determine the response rate (RR) for the selective, allosteric MEK1/MEK2 inhibitor trametinib (GSK1120212), in patients with metastatic BRAF-mutant melanoma.;This was an open-label, two-stage, phase II study with two cohorts. Patients with metastatic BRAF-mutant melanoma previously treated with a BRAF inhibitor (cohort A) or treated with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy (BRAF-inhibitor naive; cohort B) were enrolled. Patients received 2 mg of trametinib orally once daily.;In cohort A (n = 40), there were no confirmed objective responses and 11 patients (28%) with stable disease (SD); the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 1.8 months. In cohort B (n = 57), there was one (2%) complete response, 13 (23%) partial responses (PRs), and 29 patients (51%) with SD (confirmed RR, 25%); the median PFS was 4.0 months. One patient each with BRAF K601E and BRAF V600R had prolonged PR. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events for all patients were skin-related toxicity, nausea, peripheral edema, diarrhea, pruritis, and fatigue. No cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma was observed.;Trametinib was well tolerated. Significant clinical activity was observed in BRAF-inhibitor-naive patients previously treated with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy. Minimal clinical activity was observed as sequential therapy in patients previously treated with a BRAF inhibitor. Together, these data suggest that BRAF-inhibitor resistance mechanisms likely confer resistance to MEK-inhibitor monotherapy. These data support further evaluation of trametinib in BRAF-inhibitor-naive BRAF-mutant melanoma, including rarer forms of BRAF-mutant melanoma.",

Mutation specific antibodies against NRAS(Q61R) and BRAF(V600E) proteins could offer additional data on tumor heterogeneity. The specificity and sensitivity of NRAS(Q61R) immunohistochemistry have recently been reported excellent. We aimed to determine the utility of immunohistochemistry using SP174 anti-NRAS(Q61R) and VE1 anti-BRAF(V600E) antibodies in the theranostic mutation screening of melanomas.;142 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded melanoma samples from 79 patients were analyzed using pyrosequencing and immunohistochemistry.;23 and 26 patients were concluded to have a NRAS-mutated or a BRAF-mutated melanoma respectively. The 23 NRAS (Q61R) and 23 BRAF (V600E) -mutant samples with pyrosequencing were all positive in immunohistochemistry with SP174 antibody and VE1 antibody respectively, without any false negative. Proportions and intensities of staining were varied. Other NRAS (Q61L) , NRAS (Q61K) , BRAF (V600K) and BRAF (V600R) mutants were negative in immunohistochemistry. 6 single cases were immunostained but identified as wild-type using pyrosequencing (1 with SP174 and 5 with VE1). 4/38 patients with multiple samples presented molecular discordant data. Technical limitations are discussed to explain those discrepancies.

        "Doc_abstract":"Activating mutations in the BRAF kinase have been reported in a large number of cases of malignant melanoma. This suggests that therapy with specific RAF kinase inhibitors may find use in treating this disease. If the response to RAF kinase inhibition is dependent on the presence of an activated BRAF protein, it will be necessary to evaluate cases of malignant melanoma for the presence or absence of BRAF mutations. High-resolution amplicon melting analysis is able to detect single base-pair changes in DNA isolated from paraffin-embedded tissue sections and obviates the need for direct DNA sequencing. Results can be available within 48 hours. In this report, we used high-resolution amplicon melting analysis to evaluate 90 cases of malignant melanoma for BRAF mutations. Of these 90 cases, 74 were metastatic melanomas, 12 were primary cutaneous melanomas, and 4 were in situ melanomas. BRAF activation mutations were found in 43 cases (48%). Forty-one of these mutations were in exon 15. The mutations in exon 15 included V600E (34 cases), V600K (6 cases), and V600R (1 case). Two activating mutations were found in exon 11, G469V and G469R. The presence or absence of a BRAF mutation in the junctional component of an invasive melanoma was maintained in the invasive component. We also evaluated these 90 cases, as well as an additional 10 cases (total of 100) for the expression of c-kit. The majority of invasive and metastatic malignant melanomas did not express c-kit, although all in situ lesions and the junctional components of invasive lesions were strongly c-kit positive. Surprisingly, 2 cases of metastatic malignant melanoma (2%) showed strong and diffuse c-kit expression and contained a c-kit-activating mutation, L576P, as detected by high-resolution amplicon melting analysis and confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. These 2 c-kit mutation-positive cases did not contain BRAF mutations. The presence of a c-kit-activating mutation in metastatic malignant melanoma suggests that a small number of melanomas may progress by a somatic mutation of the c-kit gene. The presence of BRAF- and c-kit-activating mutations in malignant melanoma suggests new approaches to treating this disease involving specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors may prove worthwhile and that mutation analysis by high-resolution melting analysis might help guide therapy.",

Here, a simple sensitive test to detect mutations of BRAF-V600 was developed using real-time PCR with allele-specific primers and TaqMan probes. Two versions of the test using sense and antisense allele-specific primers were designed and evaluated. The test detected 1% mutant allele V600E/K in 10 ng DNA standard made from wild-type human DNA spiked with BRAF-V600E or the V600K plasmid. The test was validated on clinical formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples of skin melanoma using pyrosequencing as a reference method. In the clinical samples, we detected the common mutation V600E, as well as the rare mutations V600K, V600E2 (codon GAA), V600E2 K601del, V600D-K601del, and V600R. In comparison with pyrosequencing, both versions of the test had 100% specificity with sensitivities of 97 and 86% for sense and antisense allele-specific primers, respectively. Using the PCR test with sense allele-specific primers, mutations in V600 were found in 33 of 51 Russian patients (64.7%) with cutaneous melanoma.
