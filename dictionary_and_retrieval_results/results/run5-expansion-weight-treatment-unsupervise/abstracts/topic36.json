Although Caucasian lung cancer patients have been shown to harbor Braf and erbB2 mutations, only a few reports exist concerning Braf and erbB2 mutations in Japanese lung cancer patients. We investigated the Braf and erbB2 mutation status in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and direct sequencing. The study included 305 surgically removed lung cancer samples from the Nagoya City University Hospital, which were EGFR and Kras wild-type centric. Six Braf mutations were found in the adenocarcinoma cases. Among the adenocarcinoma cases, Braf mutations were more frequently noted in heavy smokers (Brinkman index >400, p=0.0476). We also detected five erbB2 mutations all in the non-smokers. All of these mutations existed exclusively. The erbB2 gene mutations were predominantly found in non-smokers with adenocarcinomas.

In adenocarcinomas, HER-2 and COX-2 overexpression were more common, whereas in squamous cell carcinomas, EGFR overexpression was more common. COX-2 expression correlated with HER-2 expression (p = 0.002), and demonstrated a trend towards a correlation with microvessel density (p = 0.10). None of the markers alone had any impact on survival. However, HER-2+/EGFR- tumours proved to have a poor prognosis.

HDAC inhibitors, such as depsipeptide FR901228 (FK228), induce growth arrest and apoptosis in a variety of human cancer cells by mechanisms that cannot be attributed solely to histone acetylation. This study evaluated the mechanisms by which FK228 mediates apoptosis in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells.;Proliferation and apoptosis were assessed in a panel of NSCLC cell lines that vary in the expression of the growth-regulating proteins p53, pRb, and K-Ras treated with a clinically relevant dose of FK228 (25 ng/mL). Western blot and immunoprecipitation techniques were used to analyze expression of cell-cycle proteins (cyclin A, cyclin E, p53, and p21), signaling-related proteins (ErbB1, ErbB2, and Raf-1), activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), binding of mutant p53 and Raf-1 to heat shock protein (Hsp)90, and acetylation of Hsp90.;FK228 treatment inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in NSCLC cells expressing wild-type or mutant p53. FK228 treatment led to altered expression of cyclin A, cyclin E, and p21, and to reduced expression of mutant, but not wild-type, p53. FK228-treated cells also were depleted of ErbB1, ErbB2, and Raf-1 proteins, and exhibited lower ERK1/2 activity. FK228 treatment also inhibited the binding of mutant p53 and Raf-1 to Hsp90; this inhibition was associated with acetylation of Hsp90.;FK228 depletes the levels of several oncoproteins that are normally stabilized by binding to Hsp90 in cancer cells. The resulting ability of FK228 to diminish signal transduction via pathways involving Raf-1 and ERK may contribute to the potency and specificity of this novel antitumor agent.",

In particular, cancers with specific EGFR-activating mutations seem to be the most sensitive to these agents. However, despite their initial response, such cancers almost invariably develop resistance. In 50% of such cancers, a secondary EGFR mutation, T790M, has been identified that renders gefitinib and erlotinib ineffective inhibitors of EGFR kinase activity. Thus, there is a clinical need to develop novel EGFR inhibitors that can effectively inactivate T790M-containing EGFR proteins.

These mutations may have an impact on the clinical responses achieved with lapatinib in breast cancer and may also have a potential impact on the use of lapatinib in other solid cancers. However, the sensitivity of lapatinib towards clinically observed ERBB2 mutations is not known.;We cloned a panel of 8 clinically observed ERBB2 mutations, established stable cell lines and characterized their sensitivity towards lapatinib and alternative ERBB2 inhibitors. Both lapatinib-sensitive and lapatinib-resistant ERBB2 mutations were observed. Interestingly, we were able to generate lapatinib resistance mutations in wt-ERBB2 cells incubated with lapatinib for prolonged periods of time.

We used receptor TK (RTK) capture arrays to identify receptors active in NSCLC cell lines. As Met and ErbBs were active, we explored the potential therapeutic advantage of combined targeting of Met with ErbB receptor family inhibitors for treatment of NSCLC. We found that Met physically interacts with both EGFR and Her2 in a NSCLC cell line with overexpression/overactivation of Met. Combined use of a dual EGFR/Her2 inhibitor with a Met inhibitor yields maximal growth inhibition compared with the use of EGFR and/or Met inhibitors. This suggests that simultaneous inhibition of multiple RTKs may be needed to effectively abrogate tumour cell growth.

Moreover, drug treatment enhanced E-cadherin expression in H322 and H358 cells, and inhibited secretion of MMP-9 and VEGF secretion by tumor cells. 17AAGA diminished hypoxia-induced upregulation of VEGF expression as well as growth factor-mediated augmentation of MMP-9 secretion, and profoundly inhibited the ability of H322 and H358 cells to migrate through Matrigel in response to chemoattractants.;In addition to its known antiproliferative and chemosensitization effects, 17AAGA inhibits the metastatic phenotype of lung cancer cells. 17AAGA may be a novel pharmacologic agent for specific molecular intervention in lung cancer patients.",

Thus, ErbB2 is an important target for cancer therapies. Increased ErbB2 expression has been associated with drug resistance in cancer cells. Herceptin is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the extracellular domain of ErbB2. In this study, we aimed to block ErbB2 signaling with Herceptin and assess cytotoxicity and effects on apoptosis, oxidative stress, nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB), and Survivin expression in Calu-3 cell line. 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay were used to assess cell viability as a marker of proliferation. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining and caspase 3/7 activity were measured as the markers of apoptosis. The relative expressions of NF-kB-p50 and Survivin mRNAs were evaluated. Activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and the levels of glutathione (GSH) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Our results show that Herceptin treatment inhibits cell proliferation and activates apoptosis but without effects on Survivin and NF-kB expression in Calu-3 cell line. Intracellular glutathione levels and SOD and CAT activities were decreased in a time- and dose-dependent manner associated with oxidative stress. Also, ROS were increased at 24 h.

The present study shows that SM enhances HER2 expression in NSCLC large cell carcinoma H661 and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) H69 cells and may increase the susceptibility of the cells to trastuzumab, the humanized anti-HER2 antibody. The combinational treatment of SM and trastuzumab synergistically augments and inhibits H661 and H69 cell proliferation. After treatment with SM, coexpression of HER2 and topoisomerase IIalpha (TOP2A) H661 and H69 cells is more sensitive to the TOP2 inhibitor, epirubicin. The combinatory use of low concentrations of SM with the low-toxic epirubicin accelerated greater apoptotic cell death than each drug did alone in H661 and H69 cells. Relevant studies have shown that HER2 overexpressing cancer cells are more resistant than HER2 low-expressing cells to the chemotherapeutic agent and tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis. These investigations have indicated that HER2 overexpression does not suffice to induce intrinsic and pleomorphic drug resistance. The data presented herein suggest that the expression of HER2 did not influence the SM-induced apoptosis of different types of lung cancer cells and that the SM up-regulation of HER2 and TOP2A expressions simultaneously augmented trastuzumab and epirubicin-induced deaths of lung cancer H661 and H69 cells.",

This has facilitated the development of potent and specific targeted therapies, based on the genetic and biochemical alterations present in the tumor, especially non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is now clear that heterogeneous cell signaling pathways are disrupted to promote NSCLC, including mutations in critical growth regulatory proteins (K-Ras, EGFR, B-RAF, MEK-1, HER2, MET, EML-4-ALK, KIF5B-RET, and NKX2.1) and inactivation of growth inhibitory pathways (TP53, PTEN, p16, and LKB-1).

For the last several decades, the standard treatment for SCLC has been deadlocked, and new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. HER2 is a member of the HER family and has been reported to be overexpressed in 30% of SCLC cases with poor prognosis. However, the clinical relevance of HER2-targeted therapy for SCLC remains unclear. Here, we first identify that cytotoxic drugs induce significant HER2 overexpression through microRNA-125a (miR-125a) and miR-125b downregulation, which in turn act as a novel therapeutic target for trastuzumab-mediated cellular cytotoxicity in SCLC. In this study, we showed that treatment of the HER2-positive SCLC cells, SBC-3 and SBC-5, with cytotoxic drugs induced a significant upregulation of HER2. Cisplatin (CDDP) treatment of SCLC cells resulted in a significant downregulation of miR-125a and miR-125b. We confirmed that miR-125a and miR-125b bound to the 3'-untranslated regions of HER2 mRNA, and that downregulation of miR-125a and miR-125b resulted in upregulation of HER2 in SCLC cells, suggesting a relationship between cytotoxic drug exposure and miR-125/HER2 dysregulation. Furthermore, using a calcein assay, we demonstrated a significantly enhanced cytotoxic effect of CDDP and trastuzumab that was mediated via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Finally, we clearly demonstrated the enhanced antitumor effect of these agents in an orthotopic lung cancer model in vivo. Our results offer a novel therapeutic strategy for HER2-positive SCLCs by using trastuzumab combined with cytotoxic drugs.",

In this study, we investigated the antitumor effect of afatinib, an irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-HER2 dual inhibitor, in lung cancers harboring HER2 oncogene alterations, including novel HER2 mutations in the transmembrane domain, which we recently identified. Normal bronchial epithelial cells, BEAS-2B, ectopically overexpressing wild-type HER2 or mutants (A775insYVMA, G776VC, G776LC, P780insGSP, V659E, and G660D) showed constitutive autophosphorylation of HER2 and activation of downstream signaling. They were sensitive to afatinib, but insensitive to gefitinib. Furthermore, we examined the antitumor activity of afatinib and gefitinib in several NSCLC cell lines, and investigated the association between their genetic alterations and sensitivity to afatinib treatment. In HER2-altered NSCLC cells (H2170, Calu-3, and H1781), afatinib downregulated the phosphorylation of HER2 and EGFR as well as their downstream signaling, and induced an antiproliferative effect through G1 arrest and apoptotic cell death. In contrast, HER2- or EGFR-non-dependent NSCLC cells were insensitive to afatinib. In addition, these effects were confirmed in vivo by using a xenograft mouse model of HER2-altered lung cancer cells. Our results suggest that afatinib is a therapeutic option as a HER2-targeted therapy for NSCLC harboring HER2 amplification or mutations. ",

HER2 protein is overexpressed in 20% to 66% of resected NSCLC tumors, and has been shown to predict poor patient outcome in multiple series. Experiments with NSCLC cell lines show that HER2 overexpression increases chemoresistance, invasiveness, and metastatic potential of the cells. In mouse xenograft experiments, trastuzumab halts tumor growth and is synergistic with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Ongoing phase II trials are showing that trastuzumab can be added to standard chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC without additional toxicity, and with promising efficacy.

Afatinib is an oral, irreversible ErbB family blocker that covalently binds and blocks signaling from EGFR (ErbB1), HER2 (ErbB2) and ErbB4. The compound inhibits also the transphosphorylation of ErbB3. With this mode of action, afatinib is thought to have a mechanistic advantage over EGFR blockade alone, in that it provides a sustained, covalent inhibition of ErbB homo- and hetero-dimers. In the pivotal LUX-Lung 3 study, afatinib demonstrated a prolonged progression free survival over standard pemetrexed plus cisplatin chemotherapy (11.1 versus 6.9 months; HR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.43-0.78; P = 0.001) in EGFR mutation positive NSCLC patients.

In this review we will focus on the search to improve survival for NSCLC patients deemed to be pan-negative for the common driver alterations susceptible to targeted therapy, above all those with EGFR mutations or ALK, ROS or RET translocations. Other uncommon driver mutations such as HER2 and BRAF mutations should be tested in order to rule out targeted treatment before assigning patients to chemotherapy. Chemotherapy yields short lived response with median survival still less than one year. Customized chemotherapy represents one way to attempt to prolong survival, although to date no prospective randomized customized studies have reported sufficient evidence to support this. In one attempt to demonstrate the role of tailoring chemotherapy, the Spanish Lung Cancer Group (SLCG) phase II customized chemotherapy trial (NCT00883480) showed that RAP80, a component of the BRCA1-A complex, influenced outcome in patients with low BRCA1 expression treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine, and in patients with intermediate/high BRCA1 levels receiving cisplatin/docetaxel or docetaxel alone.

        "Doc_abstract":"Human cancers usually evolve through multistep processes. These processes are driven by the accumulation of abundant genetic and epigenetic abnormalities. However, some lung cancers depend on a single activated oncogene by somatic mutation, termed 'driver oncogenic mutations', for their proliferation and survival. EGFR(epidermal growth factor receptor) mutations and ALK(anaplastic lymphoma kinase) rearrangement are typical examples of such driver oncogenic mutations found in lung adenocarcinomas. EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) or ALK-TKIs significantly improved treatment outcomes compared with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with lung cancers harboring EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangement, respectively. Therefore, treatment strategies for lung cancers have dramatically changed from a 'general and empiric' to a 'personalized and evidence-based' approach according to the driver oncogenic mutation. Several novel driver oncogenic mutations, which are candidates as novel targets, such as ERBB2, BRAF, ROS1, and RET, have been discovered. Despite these successes, several limitations have arisen. One example is that some lung cancers do not respond to treatments targeting driver oncogenic mutations, as exemplified in KRAS-mutated lung cancers. Another is resistance to molecular-targeted drugs. Such resistance includes de novo resistance and acquired resistance. A number of molecular mechanisms underlying such resistance have been reported. These mechanisms can be roughly divided into three categories: alteration of the targeted oncogenes themselves by secondary mutations or amplification, activation of an alternative oncogenic signaling track, and conversion of cellular characteristics. Overcoming resistance is a current area of urgent clinical research.",

Personalized therapy encompasses the strategy of matching these subtypes with effective targeted therapies. EGFR mutations and ALK translocation are the most effectively targeted oncogenes in NSCLC. EGFR mutations and ALK gene rearrangements are successfully being targeted with specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The number of molecular subgroups of NSCLC continues to grow.

It was in the two primaries and the metastatic carcinoma that more than 8-fold amplification of c-erb B-2 was found by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Especially, in the two primary carcinomas, tumor cells had amplified genes with the signals forming one or two clusters, indicating that the amplified gene was present in homogeneously staining regions. Among the 23 tumors, three tumors showed low-level amplification (less than 3-fold), which was differentiated from polysomy 17 found in the other two. In the 30 non-small cell lung carcinomas selected at random from 151 with negative immunostaining, there were five trisomy 17, but no tumors with the gene amplification. This suggests that although c-erb B-2 amplification in pulmonary carcinoma is rare, it occurs in the form of a homogeneously staining region and is thought to control the overexpression of the protein in the cell membrane. New adjuvant therapy using a humanized antibody to the oncoprotein may be beneficial to patients with these tumors.",

Erlotinib and gefitinib, two EGFR-targeted agents, have been shown to be relevant drugs for lung cancer treatment. Recent studies demonstrate that lapatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR and HER-2 receptors, is clinically effective against HER-2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. In this report, we investigated the activity of lapatinib against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).;We selected the lung cancer cell line A549, which harbors genomic amplification of EGFR and HER-2. Proliferation, cell cycle analysis, clonogenic assays, and signaling cascade analyses (by western blot) were performed in vitro. In vivo experiments with A549 cells xenotransplanted into nude mice treated with lapatinib (with or without radiotherapy) were also carried out.;Lapatinib dramatically reduced cell proliferation (P < 0.0001), DNA synthesis (P < 0.006), and colony formation capacity (P < 0.0001) in A549 cells in vitro. Furthermore, lapatinib induced G1 cell cycle arrest (P < 0.0001) and apoptotic cell death (P < 0.0006) and reduced cyclin A and B1 levels, which are regulators of S and G2/M cell cycle stages, respectively. Stimulation of apoptosis in lapatinib-treated A549 cells was correlated with increased cleaved PARP, active caspase-3, and proapoptotic Bak-1 levels, and reduction in the antiapoptotic IAP-2 and Bcl-xL protein levels. We also demonstrate that lapatinib altered EGFR/HER-2 signaling pathways reducing p-EGFR, p-HER-2, p-ERK1/2, p-AKT, c-Myc and PCNA levels. In vivo experiments revealed that A549 tumor-bearing mice treated with lapatinib had significantly less active tumors (as assessed by PET analysis) (P < 0.04) and smaller in size than controls. In addition, tumors from lapatinib-treated mice showed a dramatic reduction in angiogenesis (P < 0.0001).;Overall, these data suggest that lapatinib may be a clinically useful agent for the treatment of lung cancer.",

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression correlates with poor prognosis in extensive disease-SCLC. We have reported previously that HER2 expression is upregulated when HER2-positive SCLC cells acquire chemoresistance, and also demonstrated that trastuzumab exerts significant antitumor activity toward HER2-upregulated chemoresistant SCLC, mainly via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity mechanism. Based on these preclinical data, we treated two patients with HER2-positive SCLC by combination of trastuzumab (6 mg/kg, day 1) and irinotecan (80 mg/m(2), days 1 and 8) every 21 days as the third-line chemotherapy following two prior regimens, first-line carboplatin plus etoposide and second-line amrubicin. One patient achieved partial response after the first cycle and received 6 cycles in total without disease progression for 4.5 months. The other also received 4 cycles and kept stable disease for 3.5 months. This treatment can be continued safely at an outpatient clinic without any severe adverse event. In conclusion, trastuzumab plus irinotecan chemotherapy is promising and feasible against HER2-positive relapsed SCLC.

Co-expression of HER3(V855A) and wild-type HER2 enhances ligand-induced transformation of murine and human cell lines, while HER-targeted inhibitors potently suppress mutant HER3 activity. Consistent with these observations, in silico computational modeling predicts that mutant V855A alters the kinase domain and c-terminal end of the HER3 protein.

Despite improvements in conventional treatment for NSCLC, survival remains poor and improvements in patient outcome are warranted. Over recent years, basic scientific research has dramatically increased our knowledge of the pathogenesis of lung cancer and allowed us to uncover and understand the cellular pathways involved in this process. This has led to the development of therapies to selectively target these pathways. Among these, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase family and related downstream pathways play a critical role in cancer development and over recent years have become a validated target in NSCLC. The development of monoclonal antibodies and first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeted towards EGFR has had a considerable impact on patient outcomes. However, despite dramatic and sustained responses and the discovery of specific patient subgroups that may derive clinical benefit, resistance to first-generation EGFR TKIs inevitably develops. A new generation of agents have been developed to provide superior potency of target inhibition and further individualize the treatment of NSCLC.

Trastuzumab induced differential levels of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) to HER2-positive SCLC cells. Furthermore, as a mechanism of the differential levels of ADCC, we have revealed that coexpression of intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 on SCLC cells is essential to facilitate and accelerate the trastuzumab-mediated ADCC. Although SN-38-resistant SCLC cells lacking ICAM-1 expression were still refractory to trastuzumab, their in vivo growth was significantly suppressed by bevacizumab treatment due to dependence on their distinctive and abundant production of vascular endothelial growth factor. Collectively, stepwise treatment with trastuzumab and bevacizumab is promising for the treatment of chemoresistant SCLC. ",

Less is known about molecular markers that may predict response to gefitinib in HNSCC patients.;We analyzed possible associations of responsiveness to gefitinib with molecular markers of the EGFR/ErbB receptor family signaling pathway using 10 established HNSCC lines in vitro. IC50 of gefitinib sensitivity was determined using clonogenic survival assays. ErbB signaling was assessed by Western and real-time reverse transcription-PCR analyses of EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 expression levels as well as by phosphorylation analysis of pEGFR, pErbB2, pErbB3, pAkt, and pErk. EGFR sequences encoding kinase domain and EGFR gene copy numbers were determined by cDNA sequencing and real-time PCR, respectively. Finally, responsiveness to gefitinib was compared with responsiveness to the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab (Erbitux).;Expression levels of pErbB2 (P = 0.02) and total ErbB3 protein (P = 0.02) associated with resistance to gefitinib. Combining gefitinib with pertuzumab (Omnitarg), an antibody targeting ErbB2 heterodimerization, provided additional growth-inhibitory effect over gefitinib alone on relatively gefitinib-resistant HNSCC cell lines. The same markers did not predict resistance to cetuximab. In contrast, a similar trend suggesting association between EGFR gene copy number and drug sensitivity was observed for both gefitinib (P = 0.0498) and cetuximab (P = 0.053). No activating EGFR mutations were identified.;EGFR amplification may predict sensitivity to gefitinib in HNSCC. However, other EGFR/ErbB receptor family members than EGFR may contribute to resistance to gefitinib.

One hundred forty stage I-IIIA primary NSCLCs and 38 non-neoplastic lung samples were examined. IHC, using an FDA-approved Hercept monoclonal antibody kit, was performed and HER-2/neu gene alteration was assessed by FISH. The association of expression of HER-2/neu with clinicopathologic parameters was analyzed. Ninety-four percent of tumor samples (131/140) were fully interpretable after tissue processing. Twenty-five of them (19%) overexpressed (2+, 3+) HER-2/neu, while 106 (81%) had no or weak expression. All thirty-four interpretable non-neoplastic lung samples were negative for HER-2/neu alteration at protein and gene level. HER-2/neu protein overexpression correlated well with HER-2/neu gene amplification (r =.83, P < 0.001). HER-2/neu overexpression was significantly associated with histologic subtype: 19 adenocarcinomas (19/82, 23%) versus 4 squamous cell carcinomas (4/44, 9%) overexpressed Her-2/neu (P = 0.04). Statistical significance was observed between HER-2/neu expression and tumor differentiation, with strong positive (3+) expression observed more frequently in poorly differentiated tumors (P = 0.01). Patients with HER-2/neu abnormalities, particularly HER-2/neu gene amplification, exhibited a shorter survival (P = 0.043). The statistically significant difference (P < 0.005) between HER-2/neu alteration in tumor samples(25/131, 19%) and in the nonneoplastic tissue (0/34, 0%) implies that HER-2/neu may have a role in the carcinogenesis of NSCLC. The findings provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that the HER-2/neu receptor may represent a useful molecular target in the treatment of NSCLC. The significant association of HER-2/neu expression and gene amplification with poorly differentiated carcinoma compared with well differentiated carcinoma suggests that HER-2/neu may be involved in NSCLC tumor evolution. Patients with HER-2/neu gene amplification and strong positive expression of HER-2/neu protein showed a strong tendency toward shorter survival.",

We were the first to uncover that cancer cells secrete sPLA2‑IIa. sPLA2‑IIa is overexpressed in almost all specimens of human lung cancers examined and is significantly elevated in the plasma of lung cancer patients. High levels of plasma sPLA2-IIa are significantly associated with advanced stage and decreased overall cancer survival. In this study, we further showed that elevated HER/HER2‑PI3K-Akt-NF-κB signaling contributes to sPLA2-IIa overexpression in lung cancer cells. sPLA2-IIa in turn phosphorylates and activates HER2 and HER3 in a time- and dose‑dependent manner in lung cancer cells. The structure and sequence‑based docking analysis revealed that sPLA2-IIa β hairpin shares structural similarity with the corresponding EGF hairpin. sPLA2-IIa forms an extensive interface with EGFR and brings the two lobes of EGFR into an active conformation. sPLA2-IIa also enhances the NF-κB promoter activity. Anti-sPLA2-IIa antibody, but not the small molecule sPLA2-IIa inhibitor LY315920, significantly inhibits sPLA2‑IIa-induced activation of NF-κB promoter. Our findings support the notion that sPLA2-IIa functions as a ligand for the EGFR family of receptors leading to an elevated HER/HER2-elicited signaling. Plasma sPLA2-IIa can potentially serve as lung cancer biomarker and sPLA2‑IIa is a potential therapeutic target against lung cancer.",

Frequencies of genetic alterations were compared with those of 141 SCLCs (50 surgically resected cases and biopsies of 91 advanced cases).;We found a relatively high prevalence of inactivating mutations in TP53 (71%) and RB1 (26%), but the mutation frequency in RB1 was lower than that in SCLCs (40%, P = 0.039). Additionally, genetic alterations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway were detected in 12 (15%) of the tumors: PIK3CA 3%, PTEN 4%, AKT2 4%, RICTOR 5% and mTOR 1%. Other activating alterations were detected in KRAS (6%), FGFR1 (5%), KIT (4%), ERBB2 (4%), HRAS (1%) and EGFR (1%).

        "Doc_abstract":"Lung cancers are characterised by abundant genetic diversity with relatively few recurrent mutations occurring at high frequency. However, the genetic alterations often affect a common group of oncogenic signalling pathways. There have been vast improvements in our understanding of the molecular biology that underpins lung cancer in recent years and this has led to a revolution in the diagnosis and treatment of lung adenocarcinomas (ADC) based on the genotype of an individual's tumour. New technologies are identifying key and potentially targetable genetic aberrations not only in adenocarcinoma but also in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung. Lung cancer mutations have been identified in v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), BRAF and the parallel phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway oncogenes and more recently in MEK and HER2 while structural rearrangements in ALK, ROS1 and possibly rearranged during transfection (RET) provide new therapeutic targets. Amplification is another mechanism of activation of oncogenes such as MET in adenocarcinoma, fibroblastgrowth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) in SCC. Intriguingly, many of these genetic alternations are associated with smoking status and with particular racial and gender differences, which may provide insight into the mechanisms of carcinogenesis and role of host factors in lung cancer development and progression. The role of tumour suppressor genes is increasingly recognised with aberrations reported in TP53, PTEN, RB1, LKB11 and p16/CDKN2A. Identification of biologically significant genetic alterations in lung cancer that lead to activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumour suppressor genes has the potential to provide further therapeutic opportunities. It is hoped that these discoveries may make a major contribution to improving outcome for patients with this poor prognosis disease. ",

Then, pcDNA3.1-HER2 was used to overexpress HER2, while HER2 siRNA and COX-2 siRNA were used to silence HER2 and COX-2 expression. MTT assay and invasion assay were used to detect the effects of HER2 on cell proliferation and invasion. Our study revealed that HER2 and COX-2 expression were upregulated in NSCLC tissues and HER2 exhibited a significant positive correlation with the levels of COX-2 expression. Overexpression of HER2 evidently elevated COX-2 expression, while silencing of HER2 evidently decreased COX-2 expression. Furthermore, overexpressed HER2 induced the ERK phosphorylation, and this was abolished by the treatment with U0126, a pharmacological inhibitor of MEK, an upstream kinase of ERK. HER2-induced expression and promoter activity of COX-2 were also suppressed by U0126, suggesting that the MEK/ERK signaling pathway regulates COX-2 expression. In addition, HER2 induced activation of AKT signaling pathway, which was reversed by pretreatment with U0126 and COX-2 siRNA. MTT and invasion assays revealed that HER2 induced cell proliferation and invasion that were reversed by pretreatment with U0126 and COX-2 siRNA.

Among the 1007 cases with mutation analysis performed, EGFR, KRAS, ALK, and ERBB2 alterations were detected in 22%, 25%, 8.5%, and 2.4% of cases, respectively. EGFR mutations were highly associated with female sex, Asian race, and never-smoking status; and less strongly associated with stage IV disease, presence of bone metastases, and absence of adrenal metastases. ALK rearrangements were strongly associated with never-smoking status and more weakly associated with presence of liver metastases. ERBB2 mutations were strongly associated with Asian race and never-smoking status. Two mutations were seen in 2.7% of samples, all but one of which involved one or more of PIK3CA, ALK, or MET.;Multi-institutional molecular analysis across multiple platforms, sample types, and institutions can yield consistent results and novel clinicopathological observations.",

It was revealed that drug efficacy differs by race (e.g., Caucasians vs. Asians) due to oncogenic driver mutations specific to each race, exemplified by gefitinib / erlotinib. The molecular target drugs for lung cancer with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene translocation (the fusion gene, EML4-ALK) was approved, and those targeting lung cancers addicted ROS1, RET, and HER2 have been under development. Both identification and quantification of gatekeeper mutations need to be performed using lung cancer tissue specimens obtained from patients to improve the treatment for lung cancer patients: (1) identification and quantitation data of targeted mutated proteins, including investigation of mutation heterogeneity within a tissue; (2) exploratory mass spectrometry (MS)-based clinical proteogenomic analysis of mutated proteins; and also importantly (3) analysis of dynamic protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of proteins significantly related to a subgroup of patients with lung cancer not only with good efficacy but also with acquired resistance. MS-based proteogenomics is a promising approach to directly capture mutated and fusion proteins expressed in a clinical sample.

As multimodality treatments are now able to ensure better local control and a lower rate of extracranial metastases, brain relapse has become a major concern in lung cancer. As survival is poor after development of brain metastases (BM) in spite of specific treatment, PCI has been introduced in the 1970's. PCI has been evaluated in randomized trials in both SCLC and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to reduce the incidence of BM and possibly increase survival. PCI reduces significantly the BM rate in both limited disease (LD) and extensive disease (ED) SCLC and in non-metastatic NSCLC. Considering SCLC, PCI significantly improves overall survival in LD (from 15 to 20% at 3 years) and ED (from 13 to 27% at 1 year) in patients who respond to first-line treatment; it should thus be part of the standard treatment in all responders in ED and in good responders in LD. No dose-effect relationship for PCI was demonstrated in LD SCLC patients so that the recommended dose is 25 Gy in 10 fractions. In NSCLC, even if the risk of brain dissemination is lower than in SCLC, it has become a challenging issue. Studies have identified subgroups at higher risk of brain failure. There are more local treatment possibilities for BM related to NSCLC, but most BM will eventually recur so that PCI should be reconsidered. Few randomized trials have been performed. Most of them could demonstrate a decreased incidence of BM in patients with PCI, but they were not able to show an effect on survival as they were underpowered. New trials are needed. Among long-term survivors, neuro-cognitive toxicity may be observed. Several approaches are being evaluated to reduce this possible toxicity. PCI has no place for other solid tumours at risk such as HER2+ breast cancer patients.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Gefitinib (Iressa), an epidermal growth factor receptor targeting drug, has been clinically useful for the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Gefitinib is currently being applied in clinical studies as either a monotherapy, or as part of a combination therapy against prostate, head and neck, gastric, breast, and colorectal tumors. However, success rates vary between different tumor types, and thus it is important to understand which molecular target(s) are responsible for limiting the therapeutic efficacy of the drug. In this study, we ask whether expression of HER2 affects sensitivity to gefitinib in human lung cancer cells. We established two clones, LK2/HER2-32 and LK2/HER2-57, by transfecting HER2 cDNA into LK2, a NSCLC line with a low expression level of HER2. We observed no mutations in exons 18, 19, and 21 of EGFR gene in LK2, LK2/mock- and two HER2-trasfectants when we observed in-frame deletion mutations (E746-A750) adjacent to K745 in a gefitinib-sensitive NSCLC cell line, PC9. These LK2/HER2-32 and LK2/HER2-57 were much more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of gefitinib than the parental LK2 lines. Treatment with 0.5 to 1 micromol/L gefitinib specifically blocked Akt activation in both HER2-transfectant lines, but not in the parental LK2 cells. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 activation, however, was not blocked by gefitinib up to 10 micromol/L in either the parent or transfectant lines. Gefitinib was also shown to induce cell cycle arrest in the G1-S phase, and an accompanying increase of p27Kip1 was observed. LK2/HER2 transfectants showed constitutive formation of HER2/HER3 heterodimer, which were seen to associate with a regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide-3-kinase, p85alpha, when active. Treatment of LK2/HER2 cells with gefitinib markedly decreased the formation of HER2/HER3 heterodimers, HER3 basal phosphorylation, and the association of p85alpha with HER3. This study is the first to show that under basal growth conditions, HER2 sensitizes low-EGFR NSCLC cell lines to growth inhibition by gefitinib.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Over the past 30 years, a relatively simple growth factor and its cognate receptor have provided seminal insights into the understanding of the genetic basis of cancer, as well as growth factor signalling. The epidermal growth factor (EGF), its cognate receptor (EGFR) and related family members have been shown to be important in normal, as well as the malignant growth of many cell types including: glioblastomata, astrocytomas, medulloblastomata, non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and breast cancer. This review summarises the history of the EGFR gene and the v-ErbB oncogene, as well as diverse approaches developed to inhibit EGFR activity. The two most advanced therapies use either small-molecule cell membrane permeable kinase inhibitors or antibodies which prevent receptor activation. Recent clinical trials indicate that certain NSCLC patients have mutations in the EGFR gene which makes them more responsive to kinase inhibitors. These mutations appear to enhance the ability of the ligand to activate EGFR activity and also prolong the binding of the EGFR inhibitor to the kinase domain. Evidence to date suggests that these EGFR mutations in NSCLC occur more frequently in Japan than in the western hemisphere. Although these mutations are correlated with enhanced efficacy to the inhibitors in NSCLC, they can not explain or predict the sensitivity of many other cancer patients to the beneficial effects of the EGFR kinase inhibitors or antibody mediated therapy. As with as other small-molecule kinase inhibitors and susceptible diseases (e.g., imatinib and chronic myeloid leukaemia), resistance to EGFR inhibitors has been reported recently, documenting the requirement for development of multi-pronged therapeutic approaches. EGFR kinase inhibitors are also being evaluated as adjuvants in hormonal therapy of breast cancer - especially those which overexpress EGFR. Genetically engineered antibodies specific for the EGFR family member ErbB2 have been developed which show efficacy in the treatment of primary, and prevent the relapse of, breast cancer. Clearly, the EGF/EGFR signalling cascade has, and continues to play, an important role in the development of novel anticancer targeted therapies.",

ZD1839 and trastuzumab are reported to improve the therapeutic efficacy of treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and breast cancer, respectively, although the effectiveness of either drug alone is not satisfactory. NSCLC cells often express both EGFR and HER2. We therefore investigated whether a combination of ZD1839 and trastuzumab had an additive or synergistic antitumor effect. In culture ZD1839 inhibited the growth of four NSCLC cell lines (A549, NCI-H23, NCI-H727, and NCI-H661) that expressed various levels of EGFR, HER2, HER3, and HER4. A significant cytotoxic effect was observed when ZD1839 was combined with trastuzumab in A549 cells. However, this combination had no apparent effect in NCI-H23 cells. Significant G(1)-phase arrest, increased p27 expression and decreased cyclin E or D1 levels were detected in A549 cells treated with ZD1839 and trastuzumab. No significant effects were detected in NCI-H23 cells examined. The combination treatment significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of EGFR, HER2, retinoblastoma, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2, and protein kinase B/Akt in A549 cells, but not in NCI-H23 cells. Our results indicated that increased levels of constitutive EGFR/HER2 heterodimers were formed in A549 cells in the presence of ZD1839, whereas no heterodimer formation was detected in NCI-H23 cells. We therefore suggest that combination treatment with ZD1839 and trastuzumab might have improved therapeutic efficacy against NSCLC cells expressing both EGFR and HER2.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) has become a well-established target for the treatment of HER2-positive lung cancer. However, a frequently observed in-frame mutation that inserts amino acid quadruplex Tyr776-Val777-Met778-Ala779 at G776 (G776(YVMA)) in HER2 kinase domain can cause drug resistance and sensitivity, largely limiting the application of reversible tyrosine kinase inhibitors in lung cancer therapy. A systematic investigation of the intermolecular interactions between the HER2(YVMA) mutant and clinical small-molecule inhibitors would help to establish a complete picture of drug response to HER2 G776(YVMA) insertion in lung cancer, and to design new tyrosine kinase inhibitors with high potency and selectivity to target the lung cancer-related HER2(YVMA) mutant. Here, we combined homology modeling, ligand grafting, structure minimization, molecular simulation and binding affinity analysis to profile a number of tyrosine kinase inhibitors against the G776(YVMA) insertion in HER2. It is found that the insertion is far away from HER2 active pocket and thus cannot contact inhibitor ligand directly. However, the insertion is expected to induce marked allosteric effect on some regions around the pocket, including A-loop and hinges connecting between the N- and C-lobes of HER2 kinase domain, which may exert indirect influence to inhibitor binding. Most investigated inhibitors exhibit weak binding strength to both wild-type and mutant HER2, which can be attributed to steric hindrance that impairs ligand compatibility with HER2 active pocket. However, the cognate inhibitor lapatinib and the non-cognate inhibitor bosutinib were predicted to have low affinity for wild-type HER2 but high affinity for HER2(YVMA) mutant, which was confirmed by subsequent kinase assay experiments; the inhibitory potencies of bosutinib against wild-type and mutant HER2 were determined to be IC(50) > 1000 and =27 nM, respectively, suggesting that the bosutinib might be exploited as a selective inhibitor for mutant over wild-type HER2. Structural examination revealed that formation of additional non-bonded interactions such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts with HER2 A-loop region due to G776(YVMA) insertion is the primary factor to improve bosutinib affinity upon the mutation.",

Expert consensus has defined minimum requirements for routine testing and identification of epidermal growth factor (EGFR) mutations (15% of tumors harbor EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitutions) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements (5% of tumors) in advanced lung adenocarcinomas (ACs). Application of palliative targeted therapies with oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in advanced/metastatic lung ACs harboring abnormalities in EGFR (gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib) and ALK/ROS1/MET (crizotinib) has consistently led to more favorable outcomes compared with traditional cytotoxic agents. In addition, mutations leading to resistance to first-line EGFR and ALK TKIs can now be successfully inhibited by soon to be approved third-generation EGFR TKIs (osimertinib, rociletinib) and second-generation ALK TKIs (ceritinib, alectinib). Notably, increasing feasibility, accessibility, and application of molecular profiling technologies has permitted dynamic growth in the identification of actionable driver oncogenes. Emerging genomic aberrations for which TKIs have shown impressive results in clinical trials and expansion of drug labels for approved agents are awaited include ROS1 rearrangements (1-2% of tumors, drug: crizotinib) and BRAF-V600E mutations (1-3% of tumors, drugs: vemurafenib, dafrafenib + trametinib). Evolving genomic events in which TKI responses have been reported in smaller series include MET exon 14 skipping mutations (2-4% of tumors, drug: crizotinib); high-level MET amplification (1-2% of tumors, drug: crizotinib); RET rearrangements (1% of tumors, drug: cabozantinib); and ERBB2 mutations (2-3% of tumors, drug: afatinib), among others. Unfortunately, the most common genomic event in NSCLC, KRAS mutations (25-30% of tumors), is not targetable with approved or in development small molecule inhibitors. Here, we review currently approved, emerging, and evolving systemic precision therapies matched with their driver oncogenes for the management of advanced NSCLC. ",

Since heat shock protein-90 (Hsp90) stabilizes various oncoproteins including EGFR and c-Met, the inhibition of Hsp90 activity appears as a rational strategy to develop anticancer drugs. Despite preclinical efficacy of geldanamycin-anasamycin (GA)-derivatives containing benzoquinone moiety as Hsp90 inhibitors, the hepatotoxicity of these GA-derivatives restricts their therapeutic benefit. We have prepared WK-88 series of GA-derivatives, which lack the benzoquinone moiety. In this study, we have examined the anticancer effects of WK88-1 in Met-amplified- and gefitinib-resistant (HCC827GR) NSCLC cells and its parental HCC827 cells. Treatment with WK88-1 reduced the cell viability in both HCC827 and HCC827GR cells, which was associated with marked decrease in the constitutive expression of Hsp90 client proteins, such as EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, Met and Akt. Moreover, WK88-1 attenuated phosphorylation of these Hsp90 client proteins and reduced the anchorage-independent growth of HCC827GR cells. Administration of WK88-1 did not cause hepatotoxicity in animals and significantly reduced the growth of HCC827GR cells xenograft tumors in nude mice. Our study provides evidence that ErbB3 might be a client for Hsp90 in Met-amplified NSCLCs. In conclusion, we demonstrate that inhibition of Hsp90 dampens the activation of EGFR- or c-Met-mediated survival of Met-amplified NSCLCs and that WK88-1 as a Hsp90 inhibitor alleviates gefitinib resistance in HCC827GR cells.

Here, we show that non-small cell lung cancer cell lines harboring differing isoforms of mutant KRAS, can be broadly divided into EGFR/HER dependent and EGFR/HER independent groups. Combined therapeutic targeting of EGFR, HER2 and HER3 in isoforms regulated by extracellular growth signals promotes in vitro and in vivo efficacy.

Although heterotransplants of certain human solid tumors can be successfully grown in nude mice, they have never been appropriately explored for prediction of in vivo chemosensitivity to anticancer agents. We determined the tumor response rate and studied the influence of several biological and molecular tumor parameters on the in vivo sensitivity to paclitaxel in a series of heterotransplanted human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors. One hundred consecutive resected NSCLC tumors were heterotransplanted s.c. in nude mice. The in vivo sensitivity to i.v. paclitaxel (60 mg/kg every 3 weeks) was studied in 34 successfully grown heterotransplants. Treatment started when the tumors reached a size of 5 mm in diameter, and strict standard clinical criteria (>50% shrinkage in tumor weight or cross-sectional surface) were used to define tumor response. Baseline multidrug resistance protein (MRP), Her-2/neu, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression, and pre- and posttherapy bax and bcl-2 expression were determined by Western blot analysis. p53 status was determined by sequencing. The overall take rate was 46% (95% confidence interval, 36-56%) and was significantly higher (P < 0.05) for squamous carcinoma tumors (75%) than for adenocarcinoma tumors (30%) and bronchoalveolar tumors (23%). The heterotransplants were morphologically very similar to the original tumors. The response rate to paclitaxel was 21% (95% confidence interval, 9-38%). Baseline tumor parameters associated with response were no Her-2/neu expression (none of the responding tumors expressed Her-2/neu versus 48% of the nonresponding tumors, P = 0.05) and baseline bcl-2 expression (all responding tumors expressed bcl-2 versus only 43% of the nonresponding tumors, P = 0.02). There was a trend toward a higher response rate in bax-positive tumors, and MRP- and EGFR-negative tumors, but it was not statistically significant. The response was independent of baseline p53 status and baseline mitotic index. Responding tumors had a higher bax/bcl-2 ratio 24 h after therapy, but the difference was only marginally significant (2.8 for responding tumors versus 1.1 for nonresponding tumors, P = 0.07). The extent of mitotic arrest at 24 h after therapy was not associated with response. Human NSCLC heterotransplants are morphologically identical to the original tumors and have a response rate to paclitaxel that is equivalent to that reported in Phase II studies in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with single-agent paclitaxel. NSCLC heterotransplants deserve to be explored to evaluate new agents for lung cancer and to predict clinical response on an individual basis in selected groups of patients.",

The most common EGFR gene mutations occur as either deletions in exon 19 or as substitution L858R in exon 21 and cause a clinically beneficial response to gefinitib or erlotinib treatment. Unfortunately, the majority of patients finally develop resistance to these drugs. Acquired resistance is linked to secondary mutations localised in the EGFR gene, mainly substitution T790M in exon 20. Through intense research a few different mechanisms of resistance to reversible tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been identified: amplification of MET or IGF-1R genes, abnormalities of PTEN and mTOR proteins as well as rare mutations in EGFR and HER2 genes.

Current treatment modalities, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery, provide only limited improvement in the natural course of this disease. Therefore, the development of new therapeutic strategies is highly awaited. This review focuses on recent achievements on a novel class of anticancer drugs targeting the EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor). The EGFR family is a group of four structurally similar growth factor receptors with tyrosine-kinase activity (EGFR, HER2/neu, ErbB-3, ErbB-4), which dimerize upon binding with a number of ligands, including EGF (Epidermal Growth Factor) and TGF (Transforming Growth Factor), allowing downstream transduction of mitogenic signals. Overexpression of EGFR and HER2 is frequently found in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for over 80% of all malignant lung tumors, and has been associated with a worse clinical outcome. New agents developed to inhibit EGFR function include monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule receptor tyrosine-kinase inhibitors. In this review, results of most recent clinical with EGFR inhibitors including monoclonal antibodies, such as Trastuzumab (Herceptin), IMC-C225 (Cetuximab) and others (ABX-EGF, EMD 72000), and tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, such as ZD1839 (Gefitinib, Iressa), OSI-774 (Erlotinib, Tarceva) and others (CI-1033, GW2016), are summarized. In particular, final results of phase II (IDEAL 1 and 2) and III (INTACT 1 and 2) studies of ZD1839 are reported. In IDEAL trials (ZD1839 single agent in patients pre-treated with chemotherapy) there was clear evidence of tumor regression, symptoms improvement and overall clinical benefit, whereas in the two INTACT trials (ZD1839 in combination with standard platinum-based chemotherapy in chemo-naive patients) ZD1839 did not improve either survival or other clinical endpoints. Possible explanations for these contradictory results and future perspectives are discussed.",

Overall remission rate was significantly higher in the HER2 high expression patients than in the HER2 low expression patients (36.8% vs 17.4%, P=0.044). HER2 and HER3 expression levels were not associated with time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS). The patients with HER2/3 single high expression had relatively longer TTP and OS than those with HER2/3 single low expression (6.1 vs 9.1 months, P=0.725; 6.1 vs 9.0 months, P=0.862), while those with concomitant HER2/3 high expression had significant longer TTP and OS.

They received surgery alone (95 cases) or combined therapy with postoperative irradiation (63 cases). Three types of data have been collected: (1) clinical characteristics: age, sex, Karnofsky performance status, weight loss, T stage, and N stage; (2) histopathology studies: histological types, tumor differentiation, status of vascular and lymphatic vessel invasions; (3) laboratory measurements by immunohistochemistry assay: oncoprotein overexpression, including pan-ras, c-myc, neu, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and p53, and tumor cell proliferation by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA).;For the entire group, 5-year actuarial survival, local control and distant metastasis rates were 44, 63 and 40%, respectively. In the univariate analyses, T stage, N stage and lymphatic vessel invasion correlated to survival; T stage and N stage to local control; N stage, lymphatic vessel invasion and pan-ras protein positive stain to distant metastasis. When the index of oncoprotein positive stains was used, the higher index was associated with a higher distant metastasis rate. In the multivariate analyses, T stage, N stage and lymphatic vessel invasion could be independent predictors for survival; T stage for local control; N stage, lymphatic vessel invasion and index of positive oncoprotein stains for distant metastasis.;Late T and N stages, lymphatic vessel invasion and multi-oncoprotein positive stains would predict poor prognoses for NSCLC.",

Emerging evidence indicates that ZD1839 has clinical potential in lung cancer, but very little is known about the molecular characteristics of lung cancers that may determine sensitivity to ZD1839. We examined a panel of 19 lung cancer cell lines to investigate possible association between ZD1839 sensitivity and histological type, expression level and constitutive phosphorylation of EGFR and K-ras gene status. Our results indicate that neither expression level nor constitutive activation status of EGFR seems to predict sensitivity to ZD1839. In addition, ZD1839 sensitivity was not associated with expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2), another member of this tyrosine kinase receptor family nor with co-expression of EGFR and HER-2. Finally, no correlation was found between the presence of activating mutations of the K-ras gene, an important downstream mediator of the EGFR-transduced signals and the relative resistance to ZD1839.

In addition, increased expression of p53 and HER2 may confer relative chemotherapy resistance and shortened survival. The Cancer and Leukemia Group B performed a series of studies involving sequential chemotherapy followed by radiation for patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC. The objectives of this study were to analyze pathological specimens using immunohistochemistry for NE markers, p53 and HER2 to determine if there was a correlation between marker expression and response or survival. Of 160 eligible patients, 28 (18%) were not evaluable because of inadequate material. The percentage of specimens positive for markers was as follows: neuron-specific enolase 38%, Leu-7 2%, chromogranin A 0%, synaptophysin 5%, > or =2+NE markers 3%, p53 61%, and HER2 65%. There was no statistically significant correlation between any individual marker and response to induction chemotherapy or response to combined chemotherapy/radiation except for synaptophysin. Six of 6 (100%) synaptophysin positive tumors responded by the completion of all therapy compared with 69/125 (55%) synaptophysin negative tumors (P=0.04). None of the individual markers had a significant effect on survival in univariate analysis. Neuron-specific enolase was marginally significant in multivariate analysis (P=0.08). In conclusion, this study did not demonstrate that expression of NE markers, p53 and HER2 were predictive of response to chemotherapy, combined chemotherapy/radiation or for survival in this group of patients with stage III NSCLC.

Presentations at this meeting provided the outline of this report, which has also been supplemented with available data from the current literature.;The predictive factors for both the natural history and the therapy outcome of NSCLC are grouped as follows: (1) tumor related factors (anatomic factors); the extent of tumor (tumor stage) is one of most important prognostic factors affecting the therapy outcome. Tumor size (T stage), anatomical structures involved (T4 vs. T3 lesion), and the presence of regional lymph node metastasis have a significant impact on both prognosis and response to appropriate therapy; (2) host-related factors (clinical factors) that are important in therapy response include performance status, weight loss of more than 10% of body weight in the previous 6 months, and associated co-morbidities, i.e. pulmonary and cardiac diseases; (3) technical factors of radiation therapy which play a decisive role in successful outcome. The target volume should be defined accurately using modern imaging studies. The radiation dose fractionation schedule, in terms of the dose intensity and total dose, should be high enough to provide local tumor control in the majority of patients. Three-dimensional (3-D) conformal planning is an essential tool in dose escalation studies to determine the maximum tolerated dose of radiation; (4) biological/radiobiological/metabolic factors. Biologic markers resulting from genetic lesions in lung cancer are grouped as follows: (a) oncogene amplification and overexpression (aberrant gene expression) and mutated tumor suppressor genes -- ras gene, myc gene, HER-2/neu and survivin gene, p53 and mutated beta-tubulin gene; (b) tumor biologic/radiobiologic factors -- tumor cell proliferation kinetics, hypoxia, intrinsic cellular radiosensitivity, gamma factor, and DNA content; (c) enzymes and hormones: neuron-specific enolase, serum lactate dehydrogenase, and enhanced glucose metabolic rate supported by increased glucose transporter protein. The surviving fraction of tumor cells at 2.0 Gy of radiation (SF2) as a measure of intrinsic tumor cell radiosensitivity, potential doubling time (T(Pot)) as a measure of the rate of tumor cell proliferation and gamma factor representing the slope of the survival curve at 50% survival rate are being investigated as potential predictors for therapy response. Enhanced glucose utilization, a hallmark of malignant transformation, is being studied as a potential monitor for therapy response by using PET-FDG.;Current data indicate that there is a dose-response relationship between radiation dose and local tumor control, and also between local tumor control and survival in stage III NSCLC. Therapeutic factors, i.e. total radiation dose, fractionation schedule and dose intensity, and use of 3-D conformal radiation to secure the optimum therapeutic ratio are important for improved local tumor control and survival. Future research should be directed towards radiation dose escalation using 3-D conformal therapy to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of radiation in chemo-radiotherapy, and the use of this MTD for improved local tumor control and survival. Radiobiological, molecular, and metabolic markers may have potential for monitoring tumor response and optimizing radiation therapy.",

However, a review of the studies measuring HER-2/neu gene amplification and protein expression in SCLC reveals discordant results. The aim of the present study was to re-examine HER-2/neu expression in SCLC in relation to gene copy number using the new, highly sensitive, immunofluorescence automated quantitative analysis (AQUA) technology.;Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to measure HER-2/neu gene copy number and amplification status and AQUA was used to measure protein expression in a series of 23 SCLC tumours on a tissue microarray. None of the 17 SCLC specimens assessable by FISH exhibited HER-2/neu gene amplification as defined by a HER-2/neu/chromosome 17 ratio = or > 2. Twelve of 17 (70.1%) SCLC samples were polysomic for chromosome 17 with corresponding increases in HER-2/neu gene copy numbers. Intermediate levels of protein expression corresponding to AQUA scores in the range of 4-24 were detected in all 23 specimens.

By use of monoclonal antibody CK2 to the epithelial cytokeratin component number 18 (CK18), individual disseminated carcinoma cells present in bone marrow of cancer patients can now be identified (G. Schlimok, I. Funke, B. Holzmann, G. Göttlinger, G. Schmidt, H. Häuser, S. Swierkot, H. H. Warnecke, B. Schneider, H. Koprowski, and G. Riethmüller, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 84: 8672-8676, 1987; F. Lindemann, G. Schlimok, P. Dirschedl, J. Witte, and G. Riethmüller, Lancet, 340: 685-689, 1992). In the present study, we applied this approach to patients with operable non-small cell lung cancer. CK18 was expressed on 84 of 88 (95.5%) primary adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. Irrespective of primary tumor histology, single aspirates of iliac bone marrow from 18 of 82 (21.9%) lung cancer patients exhibited between 1 and 531 CK18+ cells/4 x 10(5) nucleated marrow cells. The specificity of our assay is underlined by the small rate of \"false-positive\" cells being observed in only 2 of 117 (1.7%) marrow samples from control patients with no evidence for an epithelial malignancy at the time of aspiration. Comparison with established risk factors demonstrated positive correlations (P < 0.05) between the size and histological grade of the primary carcinoma and cytokeratin positivity in iliac bone marrow. In contrast, the association with the metastatic involvement of regional lymph nodes was only weak (P = 0.09). Following a median observation period of 13 months, patients who displayed cytokeratin-positive cells in iliac bone marrow at the time of primary surgery relapsed more frequently as compared to patients with a negative marrow finding (66.7 versus 36.6%; P < 0.05). This difference was even more pronounced by comparing the rates of manifest skeleton metastasis observed in both groups (26.7 versus 2.4%; P < 0.005). Finally, colabeling of CK18+ cells in marrow with monoclonal antibodies to proliferation-associated markers, such as the nucleolar antigen p120 or the tyrosine kinase receptor erbB2, exemplified the oncogenic capacity of CK18+ micrometastatic cells. In conclusion, CK18+ cells present in the bone marrow of patients with apparently operable non-small cell lung cancer exhibit the potential to form solid metastases. Therefore, the approach presented here may be used to determine the risk of early relapse in operable non-small cell lung cancer with potential consequences for adjuvant therapy.",

Second, the CellSearch system identified 15% of patients (n = 48) as CTC positive whereas a multiplex RT-PCR for PIK3CA, AKT2, TWIST, and ALDH1 following EGFR, HER2 and EpCAM based enrichment detected CTCs in 29% of the patients.

        "Doc_abstract":"Tumor molecular biology is an increasingly important consideration when choosing therapy for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A number of potential biological markers are under active investigation in the hope that it will be possible to identify markers that assist in patient selection for specific therapies. Distinguishing prognostic from predictive makers is crucial to the development of customized drug therapy. Some markers, such as mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), are prognostic; patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC have prolonged survival compared with those with wild-type disease, regardless of the treatment received. Although EGFR mutations are predictive of response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, they do not appear to be predictive of a differential effect on survival. Other EGFR markers, such as protein expression or gene amplification, may be better predictors of a survival benefit from EGFR TKI. HER2 expression status and K-ras mutations provide additional information that may be useful in evaluating a patient for EGFR TKI therapy. Biological markers for chemosensitivity and resistance are also emerging. Patients with an elevated DNA repair capacity, evidenced by increased tumor expression of excision repair cross-complementing 1 or ribonucleotide reductase subunit M1 messenger RNA, may benefit less from cisplatin and gemcitabine, respectively, than from other agents. Increased levels of class III beta-tubulin are associated with taxane-resistance, and K-ras mutations have been associated with a lack of survival benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in early stage NSCLC. It is likely that in the future, clinicians will evaluate a panel of biological markers in order to customize therapy for individual patients with NSCLC.",

The study population included 67 consecutive patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in stage II or III who were operated on at the Institute of Tuberculosis, Warsaw, Poland, between 20 April 2001 and 10 March 2003. All patients received two cycles of chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and vinorelbine prior to the operation. The response to therapy was assessed as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD), on the basis of CT scans performed before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. p53 and HER2/neu protein expression were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using antibodies against p53 (clone PAb 1801, Novocastra) and against HER2/neu (Dako) in paraffin-embedded specimens of tumors. A response to therapy (CR+PR) was observed in 27 patients, while 40 patients (SD+PD) were regarded as resistant to therapy. Resistance was observed significantly more often in tumors above 3 cm in diameter. p53 expression was found in 16 tumors (23.9%) and HER2/neu in 26 tumors (38.8%). We observed a nonsignificant tendency to chemoresistance in tumors with HER-2/neu overexpression and also in tumors with p53 overexpression. If we consider HER-2/neu and p53 together, chemoresistance was observed statistically significantly more often when one or both markers were positive (p<0.05).

Large-scale genomics have recently expanded the lung cancer landscape with FGFR1 amplification found in 10-20% of squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). However, the response rates have been low for biomarker-directed fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor therapy in SCC, which contrasts to the relatively high rates of response seen in EGFR mutant and ALK-translocated lung cancers treated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors and ALK inhibitors, respectively. In order to better understand the low response rates of FGFR1-amplified lung cancers to FGFR inhibitors, relationships between gene copy number, mRNA expression and protein expression of FGFR1 were assessed in cell lines, tumor specimens and data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The importance of these factors for the sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors was determined by analyzing drug screen data and conducting in vitro and in vivo experiments. We report that there was a discrepancy between FGFR1 amplification level and FGFR1 protein expression in a number of these cell lines, and the cancers with unexpectedly low FGFR1 expression were uniformly resistant to the different FGFR inhibitors. Further interrogation of the receptor tyrosine kinase activity in these discordant cell lines revealed co-activation of HER2 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRα) caused by gene amplification or ligand overexpression maintained phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and MEK/ERK signaling even in the presence of FGFR inhibitor. Accordingly, co-inhibition of FGFR1 and HER2 or PDGFRα led to enhanced drug responses. In contrast, FGFR1-amplified high FGFR1 protein-expressing lung cancers are sensitive to FGFR inhibitor monotherapy by downregulating ERK signaling. Addition of a PI3K inhibitor to these high FGFR1 protein-expressing cancers further sensitized them to FGFR inhibitor. These data reveal that biomarker-directed trials for FGFR1-amplified SCC require assessment of FGFR1 protein expression and uncover novel therapeutic strategies for FGFR1-amplified SCC with low FGFR1 protein expression.

        "Doc_abstract":"Selenium has been associated with anticancer activity by affecting multiple cellular processes. We reasoned that the simultaneous modulation of multiple radioresponse regulators by selenium should increase radiosensitivity if selenium is combined with radiation in cancer therapy. Therefore, we explored the possibility of whether we could obtain an enhancement of radiosensitivity by the combination of selenium and ionizing radiation. We used two human lung cancer cell lines, NCI-H460 and H1299, as well as a human diploid lung fibroblast, WI-38, as the normal cell counterpart. The combined treatment of the cancer cell lines with Seleno-methionine and ionizing radiation resulted in increased cell killing as assessed by clonogenic survival assay whereas it had little effect on the normal diploid WI-38 cells. The increased radiosensitivity in the cancer cells was correlated with the attenuation of the key proteins involved in either cell survival signaling [Akt, EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), ErbB2 and Raf1] or DNA damage response (Mre11, Rad50, Nbs1, Ku80, 53BP1 and DNAPK). The attenuation of the proteins by the selenium compound was possibly caused by the effect on transcription and on protein stability since selenium treatment decreased both the RNA transcript and the protein stability of EGFR and DNAPK. By contrast, Seleno-L-methionine had no effect on the protein profile of a normal diploid fibroblast which is consistent with an intact radiosensitivity. These data provide possible clinical applications, as selenium selectively enhanced the radiosensitivity of the tumor cells whereas that of the normal cells was unaffected. Moreover, the selective decrease of cell proliferation signaling in tumor cells but not in normal cells should facilitate the repopulation of normal cells required for healing during radiation therapy. On the whole, the results suggest that the cancer preventive activity of selenium can be combined with ionizing radiation to improve the control of lung cancer.",

Trastuzumab, in vitro, has demonstrated growth-inhibiting synergy with platinating agents, and additivity with paclitaxel. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group therefore launched a phase II study evaluating combination carboplatin, paclitaxel, and trastuzumab in patients with advanced NSCLC.;Eligibility stipulated the following: measurable tumor, HER-2/neu positivity (1+ to 3+ by Herceptest [Dako Corp, Carpinteria, CA], confirmed by central review), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group PS 0 to 1, adequate marrow, hepatic and renal function, and left ventricular ejection fraction >or= 45%. Patients received paclitaxel 225 mg/m(2)/3 hours, and carboplatin (area under the curve, 6) every 3 weeks, and trastuzumab 4 mg/kg intravenously on day 1, then 2 mg/kg weekly for <or= 1 year.;Between August 1999 and May 2000, 139 patients were screened; seven specimens (5%) were indeterminate. Fifty patients (36%) were HER-2/neu negative, 38 (27%) were HER-2/neu 1+, 31 (22%) were 2+, and 13 (9%) were 3+.

The incidence of grade >or= 3 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia was 57% (34%) and 16% (2%), respectively. Asymptomatic grade <or= 2 reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction occurred in 7%. Other nonhematologic toxicities, including nausea, fatigue, arthralgias, and peripheral sensory neuropathy, were mild to moderate and matched those expected with carboplatin and paclitaxel alone.

The positive rate of EGFR, p-EGFR, and HER2 was 97.2%, 44.4%, and 88.6%, respectively, and the overexpression rate was 80.6%, 0.0%, and 27.8%, respectively.

The identification of these oncogenic drivers has led to the design of rationally targeted therapies that have produced superior clinical outcomes in tumours harbouring these mutations. Many patients, however, have de novo or acquired resistance to these therapies. In addition, most NSCLCs are genetically complex tumours harbouring multiple potential activating events. For these patients, disease subsets are likely to be defined by combination strategies involving a number of targeted agents. These targets include FGFR1, PTEN, MET, MEK, PD-1/PD-L1, and NaPi2b.

This led to successful evidence of using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) over the standard platinum doublet based chemotherapy as the first line treatment in the metastatic setting.The rearrangements of fusion protein EML4-ALK in NSCLC lead to the use of crizotinib for this class of tumors. Preclinical and Phase 1 clinical studies show that ceritinib is more effective against both crizotinib sensitive and resistant tumors. Although robust responses to crizotinib are observed in NSCLC harboring ALK mutations, majority of tumors eventually become resistant, posing a major challenge in treatment course. Thus, there is a need for the identification and development of second-generation of ALK inhibitors. Computer aided molecular docking data show Tivozanib and Lapatinib bind EML4-ALK with high score. Tivozanib is in clinical trials for renal cell cancer and Lapatinib is a known dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor effective in breast cancer patients with HER2 over-expression.

We found that the expression of membrane complement regulatory proteins (mCRPs), CD55 and CD59 on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells was closely correlated with histological types, prognosis and preoperational adjutant chemotherapy of the disease. Herceptin-mediated complement cytotoxicity to two human lung carcinoma cell lines exerted stronger killing effect on tumor cells after the neutralization of mCPRs via their antibodies. Furthermore, treatment of herceptin combined with chemo-agents had advantages over chemotherapy alone, while CD55 and CD59 expression levels both declined remarkably in A549 and H157 cell lines after incubation with IC50 cisplatin for 72 h.

Patients in the trastuzumab arm received trastuzumab 4 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.) followed by 2 mg/kg/week i.v. until progression.;Of 619 patients screened, 103 were eligible. Fifty-one patients were treated with trastuzumab plus gemcitabine-cisplatin and 50 with gemcitabine-cisplatin alone.

Response rate (83%) and median PFS (8.5 months) appeared relatively good in the six trastuzumab-treated patients with HER2 3+ or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-positive NSCLC. Addition of trastuzumab to gemcitabine-cisplatin was well tolerated, side-effects were as expected, and trastuzumab did not exacerbate the known toxicity of gemcitabine and cisplatin.

Receptor activation via ligand binding leads to downstream signaling that influence cell proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. Aberrant expression or activity of EGFR and HER2 have been strongly linked to the etiology of several human epithelial cancers including but not limited to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), and breast cancer. With this, intense efforts have been made to inhibit the activity of the EGFR and HER2 by designing antibodies against the ligand binding domains (cetuximab, panitumumab and trastuzumab) or small molecules against the tyrosine kinase domains (erlotinib, gefitinib, and lapatinib). Both approaches have shown considerable clinical promise. However, increasing evidence suggests that the majority of patients do not respond to these therapies, and those who show initial response ultimately become refractory to treatment. While mechanisms of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been extensively studied, resistance to monoclonal antibodies is less well understood, both in the laboratory and in the clinical setting. In this review, we discuss resistance to antibody-based therapies against the EGFR and HER2, similarities between these resistance profiles, and strategies to overcome resistance to HER family targeting monoclonal antibody therapy.",

The effect of ectopic expression of MDGI on EGFR, ErbB2, and integrin function and traffic was investigated in breast and lung cancer cell lines using multiple methods.

Ectopic expression of MDGI rendered breast and lung cancer cells resistant to the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab in vitro and in an orthotopic breast cancer xenograft model in vivo. When expressed in cancer cells, MDGI induces intracellular accumulation of EGFR, but not ErbB2, and the internalized receptor is phosphorylated and not degraded.;MDGI-driven inherent desensitization of cancer cells is a novel molecular mechanism for resistance to the anti-EGFR antibody therapy, and MDGI may be a biomarker for responsiveness to anti-EGFR antibody therapy.",

We retrospectively reviewed a cohort of 110 consecutive NSCLC specimens for which epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation testing was performed between November 2011 and December 2011 using Sanger sequencing. Using the Snapshot assay, mutation statuses were detected for EGFR, Kirsten rate sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), phosphoinositide-3-kinase catalytic alpha polypeptide (PIK3CA), v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF), v-ras neuroblastoma viral oncogene homolog (NRAS), dual specificity mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in patient specimens and cell line DNA.

Several EGFR-targeted agents produce objective responses in a minority of unselected patients, but a majority of those with EGFR-activating mutations; however, all responders eventually develop resistance. The modest activity of agents that target only EGFR may be due, in part, to the complexity and interdependency of HER family signaling. The interdependent signaling that occurs between EGFR and HER2 provides a rationale for the simultaneous inhibition of these receptors with reversible and irreversible inhibitors. Several agents with activity against both EGFR and HER2 are currently under development. Irreversible EGFR/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (e.g., BIBW 2992, HKI-272) and pan-HER TKIs (e.g., PF00299804) comprise a novel class of agents in clinical development that may prevent and overcome inherent and acquired resistance to first-generation reversible EGFR TKIs. Other agents in development include the monoclonal antibody pertuzumab, and XL-647, which inhibits EGFR and HER2, as well as multiple vascular endothelial growth factor receptor family members. Here we briefly review the currently available EGFR-targeted agents, discuss the rationale for extending inhibition to other HER family members, weigh the merits of irreversible HER family inhibition, and summarize preclinical and clinical data with EGFR/HER2 and pan-HER inhibitors under clinical development.",

The combination of EGFR-TKI afatinib and anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab can overcome acquired resistance in mouse models and human patients. Because afatinib is also a potent HER2 inhibitor, we investigated the role of HER2 in EGFR-mutant tumor cells. We show in vitro and in vivo that afatinib plus cetuximab significantly inhibits HER2 phosphorylation. HER2 overexpression or knockdown confers resistance or sensitivity, respectively, in all studied cell line models. FISH analysis revealed that HER2 was amplified in 12% of tumors with acquired resistance versus only 1% of untreated lung adenocarcinomas. Notably, HER2 amplification and EGFR(T790M) were mutually exclusive. Collectively, these results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism of resistance to EGFR-TKIs and provide a rationale to assess the status and possibly target HER2 in EGFR-mutant tumors with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs.",

Afatinib resistant H1975 clones did not exhibit any additional mutations in proto-oncogenes when compared to control clones. Afatinib resistant H1975 tumor clones expressed less PTEN than control clones and in afatinib resistant clones this correlated with increased basal SRC Y416, ERBB3 Y1289, AKT T308 and mTOR S2448 phosphorylation, decreased expression of ERBB1, ERBB2 and ERBB3 and increased total expression of c-MET, c-KIT and PDGFRβ. Afatinib resistant clones were selectively killed by knock down of [ERBB3 + c-MET + c-KIT] but not by the individual or doublet knock down combinations. The combination of the ERBB1/2/4 inhibitor afatinib with the SRC family inhibitor dasatinib killed afatinib resistant H1975 cells in a greater than additive fashion; other drugs used in combination with dasatinib such as sunitinib, crizotinib and amufatinib were less effective. [Afatinib + dasatinib] treatment profoundly inactivated ERBB3, AKT and mTOR in the H1975 afatinib resistant clones and increased ATG13 S318 phosphorylation. Knock down of ATG13, Beclin1 or eIF2α strong suppressed killing by [ERBB3 + c-MET + c-KIT] knock down, but were only modestly protective against [afatinib + dasatinib] lethality. Thus afatinib resistant H1975 NSCLC cells rely on ERBB1- and SRC-dependent hyper-activation of residual ERBB3 and elevated signaling, due to elevated protein expression, from wild type c-MET and c-KIT to remain alive. Inhibition of ERBB3 signaling via both blockade of SRC and ERBB1 results in tumor cell death. ",

For lung cancer, MET gene amplification is reported to occur in a subset of adenocarcinomas. Although somatic mutations of MET in lung adenocarcinomas are rare, all but one of those reported so far entail a splice mutation deleting the juxtamembrane domain for binding the c-Cbl E3-ligase; normally such binding leads to ubiquitination and receptor degradation, and loss of this domain leads to MET activation. The purpose of this study was to clarify in the role of MET activation in lung carcinogenesis.;MET gene copy number was determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 187 of the patients with lung cancer and the MET gene splice mutation deleting the juxtamembrane domain was examined by direct sequencing in 262. The results were correlated with various clinical and pathologic features including mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor, KRAS, and HER2 genes.;All the instances of MET activation occurred in patients with adenocarcinomas. The prevalences of MET gene amplification and splice mutations were 1.4% (2 of 148) and 3.3% (7 of 211), respectively. We identified four different intronic mutations that disrupted a splice consensus sequence in genomic DNA. Activation of MET and mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor, KRAS, and HER2 genes had strict mutual exclusionary relationships.;About 5% of pulmonary adenocarcinomas in this cohort of Japanese patients were driven by activated MET by gene amplification or splice mutations.

There is a growing body of evidence showing that cooperation between them contributes to a more aggressive tumor phenotype and impacts on their response to targeted therapy. We explored immunohistochemical co-expression of HER family receptors (HER1, HER2, HER3, HER4) and its potential role as prognostic factor in resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Expression of HER family receptors was assessed by immunohistochemistry on 125 surgically resected NSCLC. Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and time to recurrence were calculated for clinical variables and HER expression, using the Cox model for multivariate analysis. HER1 and HER3 expression was detected more frequently in squamous cell carcinoma (p = 0.002 and p = <0.001, respectively). HER4 was more often expressed in patients older than 60 years (p = 0.02) and in tumors of low histological grade (p = 0.04). Cases which expressed only HER1 had a worse DFS (p = 0.01) and OS (p = 0.01) compared to cases expressing HER1 and one or more of the other family members and to cases which did not express HER1 but one of the other HERs. By multivariate analysis, stage was an independent prognostic factor for DFS and OS. Furthermore, different patterns of co-expression of HER family receptors showed a statistically significant correlation with a shorter DFS (p = 0.03) and OS (p = 0.02). Our findings suggest that expression of HER1 only is correlated with worse DFS and OS. A better understanding of the functional relationships between these receptors may lead to a useful predictive indicator of response to targeted therapy.",

A missense mutation, L755P, in the HER2 kinase domain has been involved in lung cancer in humans and exhibits reduced response to lapatinib therapy. However, the detailed mechanism of how the HER2 L755P mutation causes drug resistance to lapatinib remains elusive. Here, molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, binding free energy calculations [molecular mechanics and generalized Born/surface area (MM-GBSA)] were performed to reveal the mechanism of drug resistance due to the HER2 L755P mutation. MD simulations revealed that the L755P mutation caused structural changes in the regions of helix αC, the glycine-rich loop, and the activation loop, thereby leading to the loss of interactions between the solubilizing group of lapatinib and HER2. Moreover, MM-GBSA calculations suggested that hydrophobic interactions between lapatinib and HER2 contribute most to the binding affinity, and that the L755P mutation could result in a less energetically favorable HER2/lapatinib complex. This may weaken the binding of lapatinib to the mutated HER2, thereby leading to the emergence of drug resistance. This study offers a structural explanation for the effect of the L755P mutation on the HER2/lapatinib complex. ",

Patients with activating mutations of the EGFR gene show sensitivity to, and clinical benefit from, treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKls). First generation reversible ATP-competitive EGFR-TKls, gefitinib and erlotinib, are effective as first, second-line or maintenance therapy. Despite initial benefit, most patients develop resistance within a year, 50-60% of cases being related to the appearance of a T790M gatekeeper mutation. Newer, irreversible EGFR-TKls - afatinib and dacomitinib - covalently bind to and inhibit multiple receptors in the ErbB family (EGFR, HER2 and HER4). These agents have been mainly evaluated for first-line treatment but also in the setting of acquired resistance to first-generation EGFR-TKls. Afatinib is the first ErbB family blocker approved for patients with NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations; dacomitinib is in late stage clinical development. Mutant-selective EGFR inhibitors (AZD9291, CO-1686, HM61713) that specifically target the T790M resistance mutation are in early development. The EGFR-TKIs differ in their spectrum of target kinases, reversibility of binding to EGFR receptor, pharmacokinetics and potential for drug-drug interactions, as discussed in this review.

Breast cancer metastases showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher activation of the c-ERBB2/IGFR-AKT pathway network compared to NSCLC metastases, whereas NSCLC metastases to the brain exhibited higher relative levels of many members of the EGFR-ERK signaling network.

Blocking HER2-mediated signaling with antibodies or small molecules has been shown to be effective in inhibiting cell growth. After analyzing the crystal structure of the HER2-herceptin complex, several peptidomimetics (HERP5, 6, and 7) were designed to inhibit HER2-mediated signaling for cell growth. We have used an in silico screening method to investigate the chemical diversity of the designed compounds. autodock software was used to dock the different analogs of HERP5 and HERP7 with HER2 protein extracellular domain.

In an effort to guarantee high quality of molecular testing in France, three subsequent external quality assessment rounds were organized at the initiative of the National Cancer Institute between 2012 and 2014. The schemes included clinically relevant biomarkers for metastatic colorectal (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, microsatellite instability) and non-small cell lung cancer (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, ERBB2), and they represent the first multigene/multicancer studies throughout Europe. In total, 56 laboratories coordinated by 28 regional molecular centers participated in the schemes. Laboratories received formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples and were asked to use routine methods for molecular testing to predict patient response to targeted therapies. They were encouraged to return results within 14 calendar days after sample receipt. Both genotyping and reporting were evaluated separately. During the three external quality assessment rounds, mean genotype scores were all above the preset standard of 90% for all biomarkers. Participants were mainly challenged in case of rare insertions or deletions. Assessment of the written reports showed substantial progress between the external quality assessment schemes on multiple criteria. Several essential elements such as the clinical interpretation of test results and the reason for testing still require improvement by continued external quality assessment education.",

HER2 is implicated in disease initiation and progression, associated with poor prognosis, and may also predict the response to chemotherapy and hormonal therapy. Anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been designed to specifically antagonize the function of the HER2 receptor in HER2-positive tumors. Clinical phase II and III trials have demonstrated the efficacy of the humanized anti-HER2 MAb, trastuzumab (Herceptin), both as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy in HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer patients. However, the prevalence of HER2 overexpression/amplification in various tumor types raises the possibility of using anti-HER2 MAbs to antagonize the abnormal function of overexpressed HER2 receptors in HER2-positive tumors other than breast. Preliminary in vitro studies indicate that anti-HER2 MAbs suppress the proliferation of ovarian, gastric and NSCLC cell lines that overexpress the HER2 receptor. These results indicate that anti-HER2 MAbs may have important therapeutic significance in patients presenting with these or other human carcinomas.

Several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including AXL, are involved in the progression of NSCLC. The AXL/MER/SKY subfamily is involved in cell adhesion, motility, angiogenesis, and signal transduction and may play a significant role in the invasiveness of cancer cells. Notably, no specific inhibitors of AXL have been described. A series of CL1 sublines with progressive invasiveness established from a patient with NSCLC has been identified that positively correlates with AXL expression and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. The ectopic overexpression of AXL results in elevated cell invasiveness and drug resistance. Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling activity is associated with AXL expression and may play an important role in the enhancement of invasiveness and doxorubicin resistance, as shown by using the NF-kappaB inhibitor, sulfasalazine, and IkappaB dominant-negative transfectants. In the current study, sulfasalazine exerted a synergistic anticancer effect with doxorubicin and suppressed cancer cell invasiveness in parallel in CL1 sublines and various AXL-expressing cancer cell lines. Phosphorylation of AXL and other RTKs (ErbB2 and epidermal growth factor receptor) was abolished by sulfasalazine within 15 min, suggesting that the inhibition of NF-kappaB and the kinase activity of RTKs are involved in the pharmacologic effects of sulfasalazine. Our study suggests that AXL is involved in NSCLC metastasis and drug resistance and may therefore provide a molecular basis for RTK-targeted therapy using sulfasalazine to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy in NSCLC.",

As a control group, 202 patients with adenocarcinomas (ADCs) and 122 patients with squamous cell carcinomas (SQCCs) were also analyzed. All the tumors were stained with antibodies for 10 RTKs: c-Kit, EGFR, IGF1R, KDR, ERBB2, FGFR1, c-Met, ALK, RET, and ROS1.;The LCNEC and SCLC patients exhibited similar clinicopathological characteristics. The IHC scores for each RTK were almost equivalent between the LCNEC and SCLC groups, but they were significantly different from those of the ADC or SQCC groups. In particular, c-Kit was the only RTK that was remarkably expressed in both LCNECs and SCLCs. On the other hand, about 20 % of the HGNEC tumors exhibited strongly positive RTK expression, and this rate was similar to those for the ADC and SQCC tumors. Intriguingly, strongly positive RTKs were almost mutually exclusive in individual tumors.;Compared with ADC or SQCC, LCNEC and SCLC had similar expression profiles for the major RTKs. The exclusive c-Kit positivity observed among HGNECs suggests that c-Kit might be a distinctive RTK in HGNEC.",

In this study, we evaluated the in vivo efficacy of a therapeutic anti-ErbB3 antibody, MM-121. We found that MM-121 effectively blocked ligand-dependent activation of ErbB3 induced by either EGFR, HER2, or MET. Assessment of several cancer cell lines revealed that MM-121 reduced basal ErbB3 phosphorylation most effectively in cancers possessing ligand-dependent activation of ErbB3. In those cancers, MM-121 treatment led to decreased ErbB3 phosphorylation and, in some instances, decreased ErbB3 expression. The efficacy of single-agent MM-121 was also examined in xenograft models. A machine learning algorithm found that MM-121 was most effective against xenografts with evidence of ligand-dependent activation of ErbB3. We subsequently investigated whether MM-121 treatment could abrogate resistance to anti-EGFR therapies by preventing reactivation of ErbB3. We observed that an EGFR mutant lung cancer cell line (HCC827), made resistant to gefitinib by exogenous heregulin, was resensitized by MM-121. In addition, we found that a de novo lung cancer mouse model induced by EGFR T790M-L858R rapidly became resistant to cetuximab. Resistance was associated with an increase in heregulin expression and ErbB3 activation. However, concomitant cetuximab treatment with MM-121 blocked reactivation of ErbB3 and resulted in a sustained and durable response. Thus, these results suggest that targeting ErbB3 with MM-121 can be an effective therapeutic strategy for cancers with ligand-dependent activation of ErbB3.",

Co-expression of EGFR/MMP-9, MVD and bcl-2 were found to be independent prognostic variables, which allowed prediction of patient outcome independent of surgical stage. Other prognostic factors identified in our series were gender, surgical stage, platelet count, extent of necrosis, the hypoxia marker carbonic anhydrase-9 and beta-catenin. In collaboration with groups in Oxford and Greece, we were also able to establish the angiogenic growth factors vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived endothelial growth factor as prognostic variables. The inter-relationships between these factors are currently being examined in an expanded patient series. Through this work we hope to be able to construct an integrated biological prognostic model which can be tested in prospective studies. This work has identified several potential targets for novel therapeutic agents currently in development.",

Treatment of human cancer cells with JNJ-28871063 inhibited phosphorylation of functionally important tyrosine residues in both EGFR and ErbB2 and blocked downstream signal transduction pathways responsible for proliferation and survival. A single dose of compound reduced phosphorylation of ErbB2 receptors in tumor-bearing mice, demonstrating target suppression in vivo. Tissue distribution studies show that JNJ-28871063 crosses the blood-brain barrier and penetrates into tumors, where it is able to accumulate to higher levels than those found in the plasma. JNJ-28871063 showed oral antitumor activity in human tumor xenograft models that overexpress EGFR and ErbB2. In an intracranial ErbB2-overexpressing tumor model, JNJ-28871063 extended survival relative to untreated animals. The brain is a primary site of metastasis for EGFR-overexpressing lung cancers and ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancers. Therefore, the ability to penetrate into the brain could be an advantage over existing therapies such as trastuzumab (Herceptin) and cetuximab (Erbitux), which are antibodies and do not cross the blood-brain barrier.

In these patients, there is often an initial dramatic response to treatment with the first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) erlotinib or gefitinib. A small number of patients with EGFR mutations have primary resistance to erlotinib and gefitinib, and most patients who initially respond to treatment with erlotinib or gefitinib will develop resistance to first-generation EGFR TKIs. The problems with both primary and acquired resistance to erlotinib and gefitinib support the need for development of additional agents that inhibit EGFR signaling in such patients. This is an overview of three representative second-generation EGFR TKIs. HKI-272, a second-generation irreversible EGFR TKI that also inhibits HER2, has completed accrual of a phase II trial in both untreated patients and patients with acquired resistance to erlotinib or gefitinib. XL647 is a reversible inhibitor of EGFR, HER2, and vascular epidermal growth factor receptor. Preclinical work shows that XL647 can inhibit cell lines bearing mutated forms of EGFR that have been associated with acquired resistance. BIBW2992 is an irreversible EGFR TKI that also inhibits HER2 and vascular epidermal growth factor receptors. In vitro work shows that this compound inhibits wild-type EGFR, EGFR exon 19 deletion, EGFR L858R, and EGFR T790M, the mutation associated with acquired resistance. The preliminary results from phase I and phase II trials for BIBW-2992 and XL647 are discussed.",

In this study, we have demonstrated that treatment of different human breast cancer cell lines with honokiol resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent growth inhibition in both estrogen receptor-positive and -negative breast cancer cell lines, as well as in drug-resistant breast cancer cell lines such as adriamycin-resistant and tamoxifen-resistant cell lines. The inhibition of growth was associated with a G1-phase cell cycle arrest and induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis. The effects of honokiol might be reversely related to the expression level of human epidermal growth receptor 2, (HER-2, also known as erbB2, c-erbB2) since knockdown of her-2 expression by siRNA significantly enhanced the sensitivity of the her-2 over-expressed BT-474 cells to the honokiol-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, inhibition of HER-2 signalling by specific human epidermal growth receptor 1/HER-2 (EGFR/HER-2) kinase inhibitor lapatinib synergistically enhanced the anti-cancer effects of honokiol in her-2 over-expressed breast cancer cells. Finally, we showed that honokiol was able to attenuate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR (Phosphoinositide 3-kinases/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin) signalling by down-regulation of Akt phosphorylation and upregulation of PTEN (Phosphatase and Tensin homolog deleted on chromosome Ten) expression. Combination of honokiol with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin presented synergistic effects on induction of apoptosis of breast cancer cells. In conclusion, honokiol, either alone or in combination with other therapeutics, could serve as a new, promising approach for breast cancer treatment.",

Some recurrent tumors have a common secondary mutation in the EGFR kinase domain, T790M, conferring drug resistance, but in other cases the mechanism underlying acquired resistance is unknown. In studying multiple sites of recurrent NSCLCs, we detected T790M in only a small percentage of tumor cells. To identify additional mechanisms of acquired resistance to gefitinib, we used NSCLC cells harboring an activating EGFR mutation to generate multiple resistant clones in vitro. These drug-resistant cells demonstrate continued dependence on EGFR and ERBB2 signaling for their viability and have not acquired secondary EGFR mutations. However, they display increased internalization of ligand-activated EGFR, consistent with altered receptor trafficking. Although gefitinib-resistant clones are cross-resistant to related anilinoquinazolines, they demonstrate sensitivity to a class of irreversible inhibitors of EGFR. These inhibitors also show effective inhibition of signaling by T790M-mutant EGFR and killing of NSCLC cells with the T790M mutation. Both mechanisms of gefitinib resistance are therefore circumvented by irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Our findings suggest that one of these, HKI-272, may prove highly effective in the treatment of EGFR-mutant NSCLCs, including tumors that have become resistant to gefitinib or erlotinib.",

Mechanistically, CD74-NRG1 leads to extracellular expression of the EGF-like domain of NRG1 III-β3, thereby providing the ligand for ERBB2-ERBB3 receptor complexes. Accordingly, ERBB2 and ERBB3 expression was high in the index case, and expression of phospho-ERBB3 was specifically found in tumors bearing the fusion (P < 0.0001).

Several subtypes of common cancers have been identified based on alterations of individual cancer genes, such as HER2, EGFR, and others. However, cancer is a complex disease driven by the interaction of multiple genes, so the copy number status of individual genes is not sufficient to define cancer subtypes and predict responses to treatments. A classification based on genome-wide copy number patterns would be better suited for this purpose.;To develop a more comprehensive cancer taxonomy based on genome-wide patterns of copy number abnormalities, we designed an unsupervised classification algorithm that identifies genomic subgroups of tumors. This algorithm is based on a modified genomic Non-negative Matrix Factorization (gNMF) algorithm and includes several additional components, namely a pilot hierarchical clustering procedure to determine the number of clusters, a multiple random initiation scheme, a new stop criterion for the core gNMF, as well as a 10-fold cross-validation stability test for quality assessment.;We applied our algorithm to identify genomic subgroups of three major cancer types: non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), and malignant melanoma. High-density SNP array datasets for patient tumors and established cell lines were used to define genomic subclasses of the diseases and identify cell lines representative of each genomic subtype. The algorithm was compared with several traditional clustering methods and showed improved performance. To validate our genomic taxonomy of NSCLC, we correlated the genomic classification with disease outcomes. Overall survival time and time to recurrence were shown to differ significantly between the genomic subtypes.;We developed an algorithm for cancer classification based on genome-wide patterns of copy number aberrations and demonstrated its superiority to existing clustering methods.

It has long been understood that metastasis is a hallmark of malignancy, and conceptual theories on the basis of metastasis from the nineteenth century foretold the existence of a tumour \"seed\" which is capable of establishing discrete tumours in the \"soil\" of distant organs. This prescient \"seed and soil\" hypothesis accurately predicted the existence of CTCs; microscopic tumour fragments in the blood, at least some of which are capable of forming metastases. However, it is only in recent years that reliable, reproducible methods of CTC detection and analysis have been developed. To date, the majority of studies have employed the CellSearch™ system (Veridex LLC), which is an immunomagnetic purification method. Other promising techniques include microfluidic filters, isolation of tumour cells by size using microporous polycarbonate filters and flow cytometry-based approaches. While many challenges still exist, the detection of CTCs in blood is becoming increasingly feasible, giving rise to some tantalizing questions about the use of CTCs as a potential biomarker. CTC enumeration has been used to guide prognosis in patients with metastatic disease, and to act as a surrogate marker for disease response during therapy. Other possible uses for CTC detection include prognostication in early stage patients, identifying patients requiring adjuvant therapy, or in surveillance, for the detection of relapsing disease. Another exciting possible use for CTC detection assays is the molecular and genetic characterization of CTCs to act as a \"liquid biopsy\" representative of the primary tumour. Indeed it has already been demonstrated that it is possible to detect HER2, KRAS and EGFR mutation status in breast, colon and lung cancer CTCs respectively. In the course of this review, we shall discuss the biology of CTCs and their role in metastagenesis, the most commonly used techniques for their detection and the evidence to date of their clinical utility, with particular reference to lung cancer.",

The aim of the present study was to determine the predictive role of IGF-1R expression in the response to EGFR-TKIs of NSCLC patients harboring activating EGFR mutations.;We retrospectively studied 62 NSCLC patients who had activating EGFR mutations and received TKIs. Protein expression of IGF-1R, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) were measured by immunohistochemical staining.

The relationship of progression-free survival (PFS) with IGF-1R expression and the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) were examined.;Of 62 EGFR mutation positive patients, 26 expressed IGF-1R, and 13 had DM. In the multivariate analysis, young age, squamous cell carcinoma, and IGF-1R expression were independently associated with a shorter PFS after treatment with EGFR-TKIs. Patients expressing IGF-1R showed a significantly shorter PFS in response to EGFR-TKIs compared with those lacking IGF-1R expression (9.1 vs. 20.1 months, p=0.005). The 13 patients with DM were more likely to express IGF-1R (p=0.001) and had shorter PFS times when treated with first-line EGFR-TKIs (7.6 vs. 18.6 months, p=0.005), compared with those without DM.;IGF-1R expression was a negative predictive factor for a response to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC patients harboring activating EGFR mutations. Moreover, patients with DM highly expressed IGF-1R in tumor tissues, which was associated with a poor response to first-line TKI therapy.

Downstream cell cycle and signaling events were compared with growth-inhibitory effects.;We determined gefitinib sensitivity by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays, EGFR expression by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and immunohistochemistry, phosphorylated EGFR by Western blotting, EGFR gene copy number by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and EGFR mutation by sequencing. The cellular effects of gefitinib on cell cycle were determined by flow cytometry and the molecular effects of gefitinib EGFR inhibition on downstream signal proteins by Western blotting. Gefitinib in vivo effects were evaluated in athymic nude mice bearing sensitive and resistant NSCLC xenografts.;There was a significant correlation between EGFR gene copy number, EGFR gene mutations, and gefitinib sensitivity. EGFR protein was necessary but not sufficient for predicting sensitivity. Gefitinib-sensitive lines showed a G(1) cell cycle arrest and inactivation of downstream signaling proteins; resistant cell lines had no changes. The in vivo effects mirrored the in vitro effects.;This panel of NSCLC lines characterized for gefitinib response was used to identify predictive molecular markers of response to gefitinib. Several of these have subsequently been shown to identify NSCLC patients likely to benefit from gefitinib therapy.",

We analyzed 27 practicable samples using a tumor genotyping panel to assess 23 hot-spot sites of genetic alterations in nine genes (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, NRAS, MEK1, AKT1, PTEN, and HER2), gene copy number of EGFR, MET, PIK3CA, FGFR1, and FGFR2, and ALK, ROS1, and RET fusions. Additionally, 34 samples were analyzed by commercially available EGFR mutation tests.;Sixty-one patients underwent rebiopsy. Twenty-seven samples were analyzed using our tumor genotyping panel, and 34 samples were analyzed for EGFR mutations only by commercial clinical laboratories. Twenty-one patients (34 %) had EGFR T790M mutation. Using our tumor genotyping panel, MET gene copy number gain was observed in two of 27 (7 %) samples. Twenty patients received continuous treatment with EGFR-TKIs even after disease progression, and 11 of these patients had T790M mutation in rebiopsy samples. In contrast, only 10 of 41 patients who finished EGFR-TKI treatment at disease progression had T790M mutation. The frequency of T790M mutation in patients who received continuous treatment with EGFR-TKIs after disease progression was significantly higher than that in patients who finished EGFR-TKI treatment at disease progression (55 % versus 24 %, p = 0.018).;The frequency of T790M mutation in this study was lower than that in previous reports examining western patients.

This study investigated whether the addition of silibinin to therapy with gefitinib or erlotinib could overcome T790M-mediated drug resistance considering that silibinin has various antitumor effects, including EGFR modulation. Silibinin selectively reduced the activity of the EGFR family (EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3) through the inhibition of receptor dimerization in lung cancer cells with EGFR mutations, but not in those harboring the wild type. In primary and acquired resistant cells with T790M, addition of silibinin enhanced the ability of EGFR-TKIs to downregulate EGFR signals and to inhibit cell growth. Similarly, the combination of silibinin and erlotinib effectively suppressed tumor growth in erlotinib resistance-bearing PC-9 xenografts.

We provided evidences suggesting that differential modulation of ErbB receptors by vorinostat or VPA, also at low doses corresponding to plasma levels easily reached in treated patients, is responsible for the observed synergism. In details, we showed in epithelial cells that both vorinostat and VPA induced time- and dose-dependent down-regulation of all three ErbB receptors and of downstream signaling. On the contrary, in A3-resistant mesenchymal cells, we observed time- and dose-dependent increase of mRNA and protein levels as well as surface expression of ErbB3, paralleled by down-regulation of EGFR and ErbB2.

Four tumors had mutations in genes with experimental molecular-based therapy, including BRAF, NRAS, PIK3CA, and AKT1. Testing for targetable mutations should be considered for patients with pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma, as a subset may benefit from currently approved drugs or clinical trials of novel therapeutic options available for other types of lung cancer.

Nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) overexpresses HER-2 protein in approximately 20% of cases. In the current study, the authors combined trastuzumab with weekly taxanes in an attempt to improve outcomes over standard chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC.;The primary objective was to determine whether docetaxel plus trastuzumab or paclitaxel plus trastuzumab was the superior regimen based on response and toxicity, and to determine whether either regimen was appropriate for further testing in a randomized Phase III trial. After stratification based on the results of HER-2 immunohistochemistry, chemotherapy-naive patients were randomized to receive trastuzumab plus docetaxel or trastuzumab plus paclitaxel. The study was designed so patients with or without HER-2 overexpression would be distributed equally between the study arms.;Immunohistochemistry for HER-2 protein expression was attempted for 182 pathologic samples from 169 patients. Twenty-eight of the 179 evaluable samples (16%) revealed 2+ or 3+ staining. The objective response rate was 23% (7 of 30 patients) in the patients treated with docetaxel plus trastuzumab and 32% (11 of 34 patients) in the patients treated with paclitaxel plus trastuzumab (P=0.76, Wilcoxon test). No difference was noted in the median survival (16 mos vs. 14 mos) or 1-year survival (57% vs. 55%) (P=0.998). Toxicities were mild in both treatment arms. No difference with regard to response rates or survival was noted between HER-2-positive (2+ or 3+) and HER-2-negative (0-1+) patients.;The expression of HER-2 protein in patients with advanced NSCLC in this study was found to be similar to that reported in previous series. The response rates and toxicities for patients treated with docetaxel and trasuzumab or paclitaxel and trasuzumab were not significantly different, though survival in both arms was better than expected. HER-2 expression status did not appear to affect outcomes for this uniform group of patients who were treated in a comparable fashion. Because of the infrequency of HER-2 overexpression, and the absence of improved outcomes in patients with NSCLC who were treated with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in other studies, neither regimen tested will be advanced to a Phase III trial.",

The increasing knowledge of molecular mechanism for survival and proliferation of cancer cells leads to the development of targeted therapies with impressive results for some cancers even if not associated with chemotherapy. These targeted treatments could be monoclonal antibodies or tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Inactivation of only one oncogene can lead to the regression of tumours as well as the inhibition of only one pathway with one or more inhibitors. This result is related to the oncogenic addiction of these tumours. Examples are imatinib in CML and GIST, trastuzumab in HER2 positive breast cancer, gefitinib in mutated EGFR, crizotinib in EML4-ALK positive lung cancer and, also, vemurafenib in BRAF 600E mutated metastatic melanoma. We shall specifically discuss HER2 positive breast cancer, which represent some 15-20% of breast cancers and the recent targeted and bi-targeted therapies. Trastuzumab, an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody has changed the prognosis of the disease improving survival in the metastatic and adjuvant setting. Lapatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR and HER2 is approved with capecitabine in trastuzumab resistant patients and in combination with letrozole in first line. Unfortunately, 20% of patients receiving adjuvant trastuzumab relapse and metastatic patients only transienly respond to trastuzumab or lapatinib combined with chemotherapy. New HER2 targeted drugs are currently in development like pertuzumab, T-DMI or mTOR and PI3K inhibitors. New strategies combining these drugs with or without chemotherapy showed interesting results in metastatic and neoadjuvant trials.

Apart from the successful targeting of HER2 over-expression in gastric cancer (GC) with trastuzumab, other targeted therapies in GC have fallen short or still in early clinical development. While HER2 over-expression accounts for up to 20% of GC, other potential actionable driver mutations occur at a much lower frequency in GC. In this review we describe some of the more interesting genetic aberrations including driver mutations in gastric cancer that have very potent inhibitors against them already in clinical development. Part I of this review will concentrate on the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) gene amplification (HER2, FGFR2, MET, EGFR). Part II will concentrate on gene mutations (HER2, KRAS, PIK3CA, BRAF) and gene rearrangement (ROS1, BRAF, HER2). Because of the low frequency of these potential driver mutations, perseverance in screening for these mutations will be needed in order to enroll enough of each uniquely molecularly defined subset of GC in order to demonstrate significant clinical benefit in a unique molecularly targeted therapy trial. This approach has been successfully employed in the clinical approval of crizotinib for the treatment of ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer. Finally, we discuss a paradigm shift in the personalized treatment of GC patients where multiplex comprehensive screening of all GC patients for all these potential driver mutations simultaneously is performed to achieve efficiencies and timeliness in diagnosis and allowing enrollment into different molecularly targeted therapy trials and the prospective discovery of novel yet unknown actionable driver mutations.

The lung carcinoma cell lines were also analyzed for TPO-R protein expression by Western blot.;MPL mRNA was not detectable in 118 breast tumors and was detectable at only very low levels in 48% of 29 lung tumors studied by microarray analysis. By qRT-PCR, low but detectable levels of MPL mRNA were detectable in some normal (14-43%) and malignant (3-17%) breast, lung, and ovarian tissues. A comparison of MPL to EPOR, ERBB2, and IGF1R mRNA demonstrates that MPL mRNA levels were far lower than those of EPOR and ERBB2 mRNA in the same tissues. IHC analysis showed negligible TPO-R protein expression in tumor tissues, confirming mRNA analysis. Culture of breast, lung, and ovarian carcinoma cell lines showed no increase, and in fact, showed a decrease in proliferation following incubation with eltrombopag.

HER2 protein is an attractive target for tumor-specific drug delivery because of its overexpression in multiple malignancies, including breast, gastric, ovarian, and lung cancers.;In this paper, we developed a new HER2 aptamer (HB5) by using systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment technology (SELEX) and exploited its role as a targeting ligand for delivering doxorubicin (Dox) to breast cancer cells in vitro.;The selected aptamer was an 86-nucleotide DNA molecule that bound to an epitope peptide of HER2 with a Kd of 18.9 nM. The aptamer also bound to the extracellular domain (ECD) of HER2 protein with a Kdof 316 nM, and had minimal cross reactivity to albumin or trypsin. In addition, the aptamer was found to preferentially bind to HER2-positive but not HER2-negative breast cancer cells. An aptamer-doxorubicin complex (Apt-Dox) was formulated by intercalating Dox into the DNA structure of HB5. The Apt-Dox complex could selectively deliver Dox to HER2-positive breast cancer cells while reducing the drug intake by HER2-negative cells in vitro. Moreover, Apt-Dox retained the cytotoxicity of Dox against HER2-positive breast cancer cells, but reduced the cytotoxicity to HER2-negative cells.;The results suggest that the selected HER2 aptamer may have application potentials in targeted therapy against HER2-positive breast cancer cells.",

In this article, the role of immunohistochemistry (IHC) in detecting companion biomarkers is reviewed. The hormone receptor (HR) is a companion bi- omarker for hormonal therapy in breast cancers, and IHC is the standard assay for detecting HR expression. The overexpression/amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is predictive of a favorable response to anti-HER2 agents such as trastuzumab, lapatinib, and pertuzumab. IHC and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) are used to determine the HER2 status. Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations respond to EGFR inhibitors such as gefitinib and erlotinib. Recently, mutated EGFRs have been detected by IHC with mutation-specific antibodies, although it shows a lower sensitivity and specificity than DNA sequencing. In addition, NSCLCs with the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion gene are highly responsive to an ALK inhibitor, crizotinib. Companion diagnostic assays for crizotinib are IHC, FISH, and the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) have KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor a mutations, related to the effectiveness of imatinib. Thus, definite pathologic diagnosis using IHC is necessary for the appropriate treatment of GISTs. Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, improves the treatment outcome for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In the field, confirmation of CD20 expression by IHC is necessary for application of the drug. Finally, the author discusses the possibility of being able to predict the response to cytotoxic agents using IHC of solute carrier transporters.",

We performed ultradeep targeted semiconductor-based MPS (190 amplicons covering hotspot mutations in 46 genes) in a variety of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded diagnostic samples of lung adenocarcinoma tissue with known EGFR mutations (n = 28). The samples reflected the typical spectrum of tissue material for diagnostics, including small biopsies and samples with low tumor-cell content. Using MPS, we successfully sequenced all samples, with a mean read depth of 2947 reads per amplicon. High-quality sequence reads were obtained from samples containing ≥10% tumor material. In all but one sample, variant calling identified the same EGFR mutations as were detected by conventional Sanger sequencing. Moreover, we identified 43 additional mutations in 17 genes and detected amplifications in the EGFR and ERBB2 genes. MPS performance was reliable and independent of the type of material, as well as of the fixation and extraction methods, but was influenced by tumor-cell content and the degree of DNA degradation.

Unlike other members in the family, erbB3 lacks or has impaired kinase activity. To transduce cell signaling, erbB3 has to interact with other RTKs and to be phosphorylated by its interactive partners, of those, erbB2 is the most important one. ErbB3 is frequently co-expressed with other RTKs in cancer cells to activate oncogenic signaling, such as phosphoinositide-3-kinase/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, Janus kinase (Jak)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) pathway, etc. and thereby promote tumorigenesis. Numerous studies have demonstrated that activation of erbB3 signaling plays an important role in the progression of a variety of tumor types, such as erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer, castration-resistant prostate cancer, platinum refractory/resistant ovarian cancer, epidermal growth factor receptor TKI-resistant non-small-cell lung cancer, and others. Basic research on the underlying mechanisms implicated the functions of erbB3 as a major cause of treatment failure in cancer therapy. Thus, concomitant inhibition of erbB3 is thought to be required to overcome the resistance and to effectively treat human cancers.

An exposure index was calculated (h/day x days/year x years), and patients with an index > 2400 h were considered as exposed. HER-2/neu overexpression was assessed by immunohistochemistry using the Hercep test developed by Dako. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS-10.;A total of 193 patients (84 females and 109 males), with a mean age of 68.5 years (range, 42-90 years) were included in the study. Of these, 57 (29.5%) revealed HER-2/neu overexpression by immunohistochemistry. After adjusting for age, smoking, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score, and treatment, HER-2/neu overexpression was associated with a statistically significant diminished survival (P < 0.001; Mann-Whitney U test).

The clinicopathologic analysis and the therapeutic outcomes of tracheobronchial ACC have been reported earlier. However, their biological behavior should differ from other tracheal neoplasms. Thus, DNA flow cytometric analysis and biomarkers of p53, HER-2/neu and COX-2 for tracheobronchial ACC were investigated in order to evaluate their clinicopathological significance.;Between 1985 and 1999, nine patients with tracheobronchial ACC were included for the study. All the patients had pathologically confirmed ACC. Five were male and four were female. Eight patients underwent surgical resections. Seven paraffin embedded tumors from six patients were available for DNA flow cytomeric analysis and immunohistochemical staining of p53, HER-2/neu and COX-2.;Histologically, nine pathologic specimens from eight surgical patients (including one patient received operation twice) showed one grade I, five grade II and three grade III. The mitotic activity, lymphatic invasion and vascular invasion were more frequent in advanced grading tumor. The higher grade tumors seemed to be associated with a higher synthetic phase fraction (SPF). Immunohistochemically, except for one grade II tumor showing positive expression of HER-2/neu, all the seven tumorous samples revealed negative expressions of p53, COX-2 and HER-2/neu. The patient with positive HER-2/neu tumor had distant metastases 4 years after surgery.;Complete surgical resection may provide best survival for tracheobronchial ACC. The DNA ploidy and SPF may correlate with tumor grading or metastasis. The overexpressions of HER-2/neu, p53 and COX-2 may impact the prognosis in patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer, but did not express difference in our patients.",

Clinical toxicities were also compared.;The survival benefit with CAB in advanced prostate cancer appears to be approximately 3 months. The survival benefit with the addition of vinorelbine to cisplatin for the treatment of advanced NSCLC is approximately 2 months, and the survival benefit with the addition of irinotecan to fluorouracil (and leucovorin) for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer is approximately 2 to 3 months.

This manuscript comprehensively reviews the preclinical data on afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family (ErbB) including EGFR, HER2 and ErbB4. Afatinib covalently binds to cysteine 797 of the EGFR and the corresponding cysteines 805 and 803 in HER2 and ErbB4, respectively. Such covalent binding irreversibly inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of these receptors, resulting in reduced auto- and transphosphorylation within the ErbB dimers and inhibition of important steps in the signal transduction of all ErbB receptor family members. Afatinib inhibits cellular growth and induces apoptosis in a wide range of cells representative for non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, head and neck squamous cell cancer and several other cancer types exhibiting abnormalities of the ErbB network. This translates into tumour shrinkage in a variety of in vivo rodent models of such cancers. Afatinib retains inhibitory effects on signal transduction and in vitro and in vivo cancer cell growth in tumours resistant to reversible EGFR inhibitors, such as those exhibiting the T790M mutations. Several combination treatments have been explored to prevent and/or overcome development of resistance to afatinib, the most promising being those with EGFR- or HER2-targeted antibodies, other tyrosine kinase inhibitors or inhibitors of downstream signalling molecules.

There is a better correlation between Her2 amplification and protein overexpression in breast cancer (BC) than in other tumour types. This marker is also considered a powerful prognostic factor in BC, with similar data emerging in other solid tumours such as bladder, ovarian, endometrial, gastro-oesophageal and non-small cell lung cancer. Her2 amplification and/or overexpression are highly predictive of response to HER2-targeted compounds such as trastuzumab and lapatinib but have been inconsistent predictors of response to cytotoxic chemotherapy. There is also evidence that these tumours are relatively resistant to anti-oestrogen therapy (tamoxifen) but not to oestrogen deprivation (e.g. with aromatase inhibitors). T2A aberrations are uncommon events in solid tumours, with an overall prevalence of approximately 10%. T2A amplification has shown inconsistent correlation with T2A protein expression in preclinical and clinical studies, mainly because non-genetic events such as proliferation rate can also affect protein expression. Expression of T2A protein has not been shown to reliably predict response to T2A inhibitors, despite the fact that this enzyme is the direct target for these compounds. In BC, T2A amplification appears to be a good predictor of response to anthracyclines, but these data are still in the process of validation. The significance of T2A deletions is currently under investigation, but contrary to what was previously thought, it may also predict benefit from treatment with T2A inhibitors. The prognostic significance of T2A aberrations is currently unknown.",

While plant-based formulations have been used to treat cancer for centuries, current treatments usually involve poisonous mustard gas, chemotherapy, radiation, and targeted therapies. While traditional plant-derived medicines are safe, what are the active principles in them and how do they mediate their effects against cancer is perhaps best illustrated by curcumin, a derivative of turmeric used for centuries to treat a wide variety of inflammatory conditions. Curcumin is a diferuloylmethane derived from the Indian spice, turmeric (popularly called \"curry powder\") that has been shown to interfere with multiple cell signaling pathways, including cell cycle (cyclin D1 and cyclin E), apoptosis (activation of caspases and down-regulation of antiapoptotic gene products), proliferation (HER-2, EGFR, and AP-1), survival (PI3K/AKT pathway), invasion (MMP-9 and adhesion molecules), angiogenesis (VEGF), metastasis (CXCR-4) and inflammation (NF-kappaB, TNF, IL-6, IL-1, COX-2, and 5-LOX). The activity of curcumin reported against leukemia and lymphoma, gastrointestinal cancers, genitourinary cancers, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, lung cancer, melanoma, neurological cancers, and sarcoma reflects its ability to affect multiple targets.

To identify suitable ligands, we surveyed fluids from ovarian and lung cancer patients and found that amphiregulin (AREG) is the most abundant and generalized ligand secreted by advanced tumors. AREG is a low affinity EGFR ligand, which is upregulated following treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs. Because AREG depletion retarded growth of xenografted ovarian tumors in mice, we generated a neutralizing monoclonal anti-AREG antibody. The antibody inhibited growth of ovarian cancer xenografts and strongly enhanced chemotherapy efficacy.

SCCO patients were more likely to be metastatic (70 %) than SCCO-HT (50 %) or NET-O (33 %) patients, but at a similar rate to SCLC patients (65 %). PD1 expression varied across tumor type with SCCO (100 %), SCCO-HT (60 %), NET-O (33 %) vs SCLC (42 %). PDL1 expression also varied with SCCO (50 %), SCCO-HT (20 %), NET-O (33 %) and SCLC (0 %). No amplifications were identified in cMET, EGFR, or HER2 and only 1 was found in PIK3CA (NET-O). Actionable mutations were rare with 1 patient with SCCO having a BRCA2 mutation and 1 patient with NET-O having a PIK3CA mutation. No other actionable mutations were identified.;No recurrent actionable mutations or rearrangements were identified using this platform in SCCO. IHC patterns may help guide the use of chemotherapy in these rare tumors.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family consists of four members that belong to the ErbB lineage of proteins (ErbB1-4). These receptors consist of an extracellular domain, a single hydrophobic transmembrane segment, and an intracellular portion with a juxtamembrane segment, a protein kinase domain, and a carboxyterminal tail. The ErbB proteins function as homo and heterodimers. Growth factor binding to EGFR induces a large conformational change in the extracellular domain. Two ligand-EGFR complexes unite to form a back-to-back dimer in which the ligands are on opposite sides of the aggregate. Following ligand binding, EGFR intracellular kinase domains form an asymmetric dimer. The carboxyterminal lobe of the activator kinase of the dimer interacts with the amino-terminal lobe of the receiver kinase thereby leading to its allosteric stimulation. Several malignancies are associated with the mutation or increased expression of members of the ErbB family including lung, breast, stomach, colorectal, head and neck, and pancreatic carcinomas. Gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib are orally effective protein-kinase targeted quinazoline derivatives that are used in the treatment of ERBB1-mutant lung cancer and lapatinib is an orally effective quinazoline derivative used in the treatment of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer. Moreover, monoclonal antibodies that target the extracellular domain of ErbB2 are used for the treatment of ErbB2-positive breast cancer and monoclonal antibodies that target ErbB1 and are used for the treatment of colorectal cancer. Cancers treated with these targeted drugs eventually become resistant to them, and a current goal of research is to develop drugs that are effective against drug-resistant tumors. ",

Further improvements of these therapies may be guided by a quantitative, dynamic integrative systems understanding of the complexities of ErbB dimerisation, trafficking and activation, for it is these complexities that render difficult intuiting how perturbations such as drug intervention will affect ErbB signalling activities. Towards this goal, we have developed a computational model implementing commonly accepted principles governing ErbB receptor interaction, trafficking, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Using this model, we are able to investigate several hypotheses regarding the compartmental localisation of dephosphorylation. Model results applied to experimental data on ErbB 1, ErbB2 and ErbB3 phosphorylation in H292 human lung carcinoma cells support a hypothesis that key dephosphorylation activity for these receptors occurs largely in an intracellular, endosomal compartment rather than at the cell surface plasma membrane.

EGFR overexpression is thought to be the principal mechanism of activation in various malignant tumors. Moreover, an increased EGFR copy number is associated with improved survival in non-small cell lung cancer patients, suggesting that increased expression of mutant and/or wild-type EGFR molecules could be molecular determinants of responses to gefitinib. However, as EGFR mutations and/or gene gains are not observed in all patients who respond partially to treatment, alternative mechanisms might confer sensitivity to EGFR-targeting agents. Preclinical studies showed that sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors depends on how closely cell survival and growth signalings are coupled with EGFR, and also with HER2 and HER3, in each cancer.

TP53 mutation was the most common GAs (15%, n=29/190), followed by CDKN2A homozygous loss (5%, n=10/190), KRAS mutation (4%, n=8/190), EGFR mutation (4%, n=8/190) and MDM2 amplification (2%, n=5/190). As per NCCN guidelines, targetable GAs were identified in 16 patients (31%) (BRAF mutation [n=1], EGFR mutation [n=8], ERBB2 mutation [n=4], MET amplification [n=1], KIF5B-RET rearrangement [n=2], CCDC6-RET rearrangement [n=1], CD74-ROS1 rearrangement [n=1], EZR-ROS1 rearrangement [n=5], and SLC34A2-ROS1 rearrangement [n=1]).;Fifty eight percent of patients wild type by standard testing for EGFR/KRAS/ALK have GAs identifiable by CGP that suggest benefit from target therapy. CGP used when standard molecular testing for NSCLC is negative can reveal additional avenues of benefit from targeted therapy.",

Here, we summarize the clinically relevant biomarker tests that should be considered in neurosurgical specimens based on the current recommendations of the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) or the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for the most relevant primary tumor types: lung cancer (EGFR mutations, ALK rearrangement, BRAF mutations), breast cancer (HER2 amplification, steroid receptor overexpression), melanoma (BRAF mutations), and colorectal cancer (RAS mutations). Furthermore, we discuss emerging therapeutic targets including novel oncogenic alterations (ROS1 rearrangements, FGFR1 amplifications, CMET amplifications, and others) and molecular features of the tumor microenvironment (including immune-checkpoint molecules such as CTLA4 and PD-1/PD-L1).

There are currently no effective therapies against metastatic TNBC. Compared with other breast cancer subtypes, EGFR is frequently overexpressed in TNBC and a potential therapeutic target for this disease. There are two types of EGFR inhibitors, small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and monoclonal antibody (mAb), for the treatment of cancers, such as non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. For breast cancer, however, the clinical trials of EGFR inhibitors have failed due to low response rates. Because a small portion of patients do demonstrate response to EGFR inhibitors, it may be necessary to stratify patients to enhance the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors in TNBC and to develop the effective combination therapy for this patient population. In this review, we describe some of the molecular mechanisms underlying EGFR inhibitor sensitivity and further discuss the possible therapeutic strategies to increase the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors in TNBC.

We explored whether all EGFR TKIs similarly select for the T790M mutation using data from early clinical trials and established in vitro models of acquired resistance.;We analyzed the clinical characteristics of eight patients with metastatic EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma who were treated first-line with XL647 and then progressed. XL647 is an ATP-competitive inhibitor of EGFR, HER2, KDR, and EPHB4. Additional molecular preclinical studies were performed to characterize resistance.;Four patients displayed confirmed partial responses (PRs), three patients had unconfirmed PRs, and one patient displayed stable disease. Only one of five patients' tumor samples available for analysis after disease progression harbored the T790M mutation. Eight patients subsequently received erlotinib, with (n = 3) or without (n = 5) chemotherapy. Three of five patients treated with single-agent erlotinib derived additional benefit, staying on drug up to 9 months. EGFR-mutant PC-9 cells with acquired resistance to XL647 did not harbor the T790M mutation, displayed a distinct mRNA profile from PC-9 cells with T790M-mediated resistance, and were moderately sensitive to erlotinib in growth inhibition assays. Crystal structure analyses of XL647/EGFR T790M did not reveal a different binding mode from that of erlotinib.;The findings of this exploratory study suggest that different EGFR TKIs may select for distinct mechanisms of resistance.

Several prognostic factors have been identified for patients with metastatic breast cancer, including tumor volume and location, comorbid conditions, response to prior therapy, and the presence of molecular tumor markers (e.g., estrogen receptors [ER] and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]). Metastatic breast cancer is usually incurable, and the goals of therapy are palliation of symptoms, extending survival, and improving quality of life. Options for the medical management of metastatic breast cancer include endocrine therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and targeted biologic agents. Treatment guidelines developed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network generally recommend endocrine therapy for patients with ER-positive or progesterone receptor (PR)-positive disease, for patients with bone or soft tissue metastasis, or those with asymptomatic visceral disease. Cytotoxic chemotherapy alone is usually recommended for patients with ER-negative/PR-negative disease, who have symptomatic visceral disease, or whose tumors are HER2-negative or rapidly growing. Biologic agents (e.g., trastuzumab and lapatinib) alone or in combination are recommended for patients with HER2-positive disease.;Treatment options for meta-static breast cancer continue to increase as new antitumor medications enter clinical practice and controlled clinical trials evaluate the optimal combinations of established and novel medications.",

It has been recently reported that molecular-targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), are effective in patients with lung carcinoma. In efforts to improve the prognosis of patients with LCNEC, we analyzed gene expression, gene mutations and immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of known molecular targets in LCNECs, and compared the expression to that of lung adenocarcinomas (ACs). Thirteen patients with primary LCNEC and 14 patients with AC were analyzed. We evaluated IHC expression for c-KIT, human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), gene mutations for EGFR, K-ras and c-kit, and gene expression using fluorescence in situ hybridization for EGFR. In cases with LCNEC, the IHC expression of c-KIT, HER2 and VEGF was 76.9, 30.8 and 100%, respectively. There was a significant difference in the IHC expression of c-KIT and HER2 between the LCNEC and AC cases. Two cases of LCNEC had overexpression of HER2, and the frequency of EGFR gene mutations was higher in the the AC group, with only a single EGFR mutation (exon 18) identified in the LCNEC group. Although LCNEC had a higher rate of expression of c-KIT by IHC, no c-kit gene mutations were found. These findings suggest a potential role for anti-VEGF-, anti-c-KIT- and possibly anti-HER2-targeted agents in the treatment of LCNEC.",

Three patented mAbs are currently approved in clinical cancer treatment: Trastuzumab (Herceptin) directed against HER2 and used to treat breast cancer, Cetuximab and Panitumumab which are anti-EGFR antibodies approved for colorectal cancer treatment. Unfortunately, these mAbs are facing cancer resistance mediated by paracrine activation of other ErbB members or compensatory ErbB signalling factors. In parallel, three TKIs have been approved to treat cancer: Gefitinib (Iressa), Erlotinib (Tarceva) inhibiting specifically EGFR and approved to treat non small cell lung cancer and Lapatinib (Tykerb) which has the dual specificity EGFR/HER2 and recently approved to treat metastatic breast cancer.

Studies in PKCδ-/- mice have confirmed a pro-apoptotic role for this kinase in response to DNA damage and a tumor promoter role in some oncogenic contexts. In non-transformed cells, inhibition of PKCδ suppresses the release of cytochrome c and caspase activation, indicating a function upstream of apoptotic pathways. Data from PKCδ-/- mice demonstrate a role for PKCδ in the execution of DNA damage-induced and physiologic apoptosis. This has led to the important finding that inhibitors of PKCδ can be used therapeutically to reduce irradiation and chemotherapy-induced toxicity. By contrast, PKCδ is a tumor promoter in mouse models of mammary gland and lung cancer, and increased PKCδ expression is a negative prognostic indicator in Her2+ and other subtypes of human breast cancer.

Preclinical data suggested that anti-VEGF-A therapy may prevent the formation of nsNSCLC brain metastases. Whether non-brain metastases are also prevented, and whether bevacizumab shows a brain metastases-preventive activity in cancer patients is unknown. Data of one nsNSCLC (stage IIIB/IV, AVAiL) and two breast cancer bevacizumab trials (HER2 negative, AVADO; HER2 positive, AVEREL) were retrospectively analyzed regarding the frequency of the brain versus other organs being the site of first relapse. For animal studies, the outgrowth of PC14-PE6 lung adenocarcinoma cells to brain macrometastases in mice was measured by intravital imaging: under control IgG (25 mg/kg) treatment, or varying doses of bevacizumab (25 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg, 0.25 mg/kg). Brain metastases as site of first relapse were significantly less frequent in the bevacizumab arm of the AVAiL trial (HR = 0.36, P < 0.001). In AVADO and AVEREL, no significant difference was seen. In mice, bevacizumab treatment led to secondary regressions of non-brain macrometastases, but did not reduce their total incidence, and did not improve survival. In a brain-seeking nsNSCLC metastasis model, treatment with bevacizumab inhibited brain metastases formation, which resulted in improved overall survival. In summary, bevacizumab has the potential to prevent brain metastases in nsNSCLC, but no preventive activity could be detected outside the brain.

Signal transduction elements interact through complex biochemically related networks. Aberrations in signal transduction elements can lead to increased proliferative potential, sustained angiogenesis, tissue invasion and metastasis, and apoptosis inhibition. Most human neoplasms have aberrant signal transduction elements. Several compounds that target aberrant signal transduction elements, such as those in the ErbB family of tyrosine kinase receptors and mammalian target of rapamycin, are in development. To date, commercially available signal-transduction-targeting compounds include trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against the ErbB-2 receptor for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer overexpressing the ErbB-2 (HER-2) receptor, and gefitinib, an inhibitor of the ErbB-1 receptor tyrosine kinase that recently received regulatory approval for the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. In contrast to traditional cytotoxic treatments, although signal transduction inhibitors are capable of inducing tumor regression, particularly in malignancies that are principally driven by specific target aberrations, preclinical and early clinical investigations suggest that their predominant beneficial effects are growth inhibitory in nature; therefore, new clinical trial designs and evaluation end points may be required to ultimately assess their value. Prospective profiling of patients and tumors to determine treatment response is also essential to the success of these clinical trials.

More recently, gefitinib (ZD1839, Iressa) and bortezomib (PS-341, Velcade) have been approved for refractory nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and multiple myeloma (MM), respectively. In addition, promising results from randomized studies of bevacizumab (Avastin) and cetuximab (IMC-225, Erbitux) have been reported and shortly may lead to their approval for the treatment of colorectal carcinoma (CRC). To what degree the success or failure of these agents has been due to target, the agent, the dose or the selection of patients is uncertain. Certainly, further evaluation of these factors is required to optimize the therapeutic impact of targeted agents and imaging modalities may play a vital role in this process. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent results from trials of selected targeted agents and to suggest roles imaging may play in the further development of these and other targeted agents.",

This study evaluated the toxicity, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activities of pertuzumab in Japanese patients with solid tumors.;Patients with solid tumors refractory to standard therapy were administered pertuzumab 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 weeks.

The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was a dose at which two out of six patients had Grade 3 toxicities.;Eighteen patients, aged 38-66 (median 57) years, with solid tumors were enrolled and a total of 32 cycles of pertuzumab were administered. Toxicities were generally acceptable. Grade 3 elevation of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase was observed in one patient at 25 mg/kg and was considered to be dose limiting. MTD was not reached up to a dose level of 25 mg/kg. The serum concentration of pertuzumab declined slowly (terminal half-life is approximately 3 weeks). The AUC proportionally increased over the dose range tested. There was limited evidence of activity (stable disease 2; progressive disease 13; and not evaluable 3); however, tumor shrinkage and tumor marker decrease were observed in an ovarian cancer and a non-small-cell lung cancer patient, respectively.;Pertuzumab is well tolerated up to 25 mg/kg.

Molecular diagnosis is a key element to identify oncogenic drivers predicting the efficacy of these agents. In stage IV patients, histopathological diagnosis is often performed on bone metastases biopsy, but routine procedure of decalcification may alter DNA quality for subsequent molecular tests. We set up a procedure to perform molecular analyses on bone metastasis and describe the results of mutational profiling. POUMOS-TEC is a prospective study conducted in stage IV lung adenocarcinomas. Bone metastasis specimens from surgery and CT-scan guided biopsies were sent fresh for immediate formalin-fixation. Decalcification was performed, only when necessary, using EDTA. Controls were processed with acid decalcification. DNA extraction was performed after laser microdissection. Mutational profiling of oncogenic drivers was conducted as recommended by the French National Cancer Institute. Diagnosis efficiency of the computed tomography (CT)-scan guided biopsy process was assessed. Among 177 collected bone metastases specimens, 49 came from lung adenocarcinomas. Specimens processed with no decalcification or EDTA (n=45) provided high-quality DNA. Molecular profiling was performed in 44/45 (98%) of cases. The results of the whole panel of oncogenic drivers (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, HER2 and ALK) were obtained in 41/45 (91%) of cases. A mutation was observed in 50% of cases including 32% of KRAS and 14% of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. CT-scan biopsy efficiency rate was 96%. We demonstrated the feasibility to routinely conduct mutational profiling on bone metastases biopsies. We observed a higher rate of EGFR mutations (+42%) in comparison with the average rate of all stage IV lung adenocarcinomas. This procedure is a new step toward the goal of personalized medicine to treat lung cancers and other osteophilic tumors. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"At present, mammary carcinoma is the second most common type of malignant tumor in adult women after lung cancer, as more than one million women are diagnosed with breast cancer every year. Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment, which have resulted in a decrease in mortality in recent decades, breast cancer remains a major public health problem. One of the most significant unresolved clinical and scientific problems is the occurrence of resistance to clinical treatments and their toxicity (and how to predict, prevent and overcome them). However, the heterogeneity of human breast cancer in terms of genetic features, molecular profiles and clinical behavior represents a constraint obstructing the discovery of a solution to the disease. It is currently considered that the chances of success of therapy may increase if the tumor cells are selectively removed before they can evolve to their mature stages up to metastases production. Therefore, novel and more sensitive diagnostic tools are being developed, with the aim of improving the early and noninvasive detection of rising malignancies and the accuracy of tumor tissue localization. Meanwhile, there is an emerging use of targeted therapies in oncology, depending on the expression of specific proteins or genes present in tumor cells. Among the molecular targets considered for the treatment of breast cancer cells so far, we chose to focus on examples involving overexpression and/or gene amplification of \"Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2\" (HER2) protein. In current studies, various types of nanoparticles conjugated with the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, the so-called \"trastuzumab\", are investigated extensively due to promising results in biological and preclinical applications aimed at improving the treatment of breast cancer. In this paper, we present a critical review of the preparation and use of different kinds of trastuzumab-functionalized nanoparticles, with an emphasis on the therapeutic and diagnostic (theranostic) potential of this generation of hybrid nanoparticles, exploiting the multifaceted mechanisms of action of trastuzumab against malignant cells.",

HER2 is a potent activator of several signaling pathways that support cell survival, proliferation and metabolism. In HER2-positive breast cancer there are most likely unexplored proteins that act directly or indirectly downstream of well established pathways and take part in tumor development and treatment response.;In order to identify novel copy number variations (CNVs) in HER2-positive breast cancer whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays were used. A PCR-based loss of heterozygosis (LOH) assay was conducted to verify presence of deletion in HER2-positive breast cancer cases but also in HER2 negative breast cancers, cervical cancers and lung cancers. Screening for mutations was performed using single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) followed by PCR sequencing. Protein expression was evaluated with immunohistochemistry (IHC).;A common deletion at chromosome Xq24 was found in 80% of the cases. This locus harbors the gene solute carrier (SLC) family 25A member 43 (SLC25A43) encoding for a mitochondrial transport protein. The LOH assay revealed presence of SLC25A43 deletion in HER2-positive (48%), HER2-negative (9%), cervical (42%) and lung (67%) cancers. HER2-positive tumors with negative or low SLC25A43 protein expression had significantly lower S-phase fraction compared to tumors with medium or high expression (P = 0.024).;We have found deletion in the SLC25A43 gene to be a common event in HER2-positive breast cancer as well as in other cancers. In addition, the SLC25A43 protein expression was shown to be related to S-phase fraction in HER2-positive breast cancer. Our results indicate a possible role of SLC25A43 in HER2-positive breast cancer and support the hypothesis of altered mitochondrial function in cancer.",

Integrins play a role in regulating adhesion, growth, motility, and survival, and have been shown to be critical for metastatic growth in the brain in preclinical models. Cilengitide, an αvβ3/αvβ5 integrin inhibitor, has previously been studied as an anti-cancer drug in various tumor types. Previous studies have shown additive effects of cilengitide and radiation in lung cancer and glioblastoma cell lines. The ability of cilengitide to enhance the effects of radiation was examined preclinically in the setting of breast cancer to assess its possible efficacy in the setting of brain metastasis from breast cancer.;Our panel of breast cells was composed of four cell lines: T-47D (ER/PR+, Her2-, luminal A), MCF-7 (ER/PR+, Her2-, luminal A), MDA-MB-231 (TNBC, basal B), MDA-MB-468 (TNBC, basal A). The presence of cilengitide targets, β3 and β5 integrin, was first determined. Cell detachment was determined by cell counting, cell proliferation was determined by MTS proliferation assay, and apoptosis was measured by Annexin V staining and flow cytometry. The efficacy of cilengitide treatment alone was analyzed, followed by assessment of combined cilengitide and radiation treatment. Integrin β3 knockdown was performed, followed by cilengitide and radiation treatment to test for incomplete target inhibition by cilengitide, in high β3 expressing cells.;We observed that all cell lines examined expressed both β3 and β5 integrin and that cilengitide was able to induce cell detachment and reduced proliferation in our panel. Annexin V assays revealed that a portion of these effects was due to cilengitide-induced apoptosis. Combined treatment with cilengitide and radiation served to further reduce proliferation compared to either treatment alone. Following β3 integrin knockdown, radiosensitization in combination with cilengitide was observed in a previously non-responsive cell line (MDA-MB-231). Clonogenic assays suggested little radiosensitization effects of cilengitide.;Cilengitide appears to enhance radiation response in preclinical models of breast cancer. These data suggest that the combination of radiation therapy and cilengitide may prove to be effective where radiation is utilized for the treatment of gross disease in breast cancer, such as in the setting of brain metastasis.",

Although both these classifications are essential for personalized treatment, their integrated clinical effect remains unclear. Therefore, we analyzed 981 lung adenocarcinomas to detect the potential correlation and combined effect of oncogenic mutations and histological subtype on prognosis. Analysis for oncogenic mutations included the direct sequencing of EGFR, KRAS, HER2, BRAF, PIK3CA, ALK, and RET for oncogenic mutations/rearrangements, and a rereview of the IASLC/ATS/ERS classification was undertaken. Eligible tumors included 13 atypical adenomatous hyperplasia/adenocarcinoma in situ, 20 minimally invasive adenocarcinomas, 901 invasive adenocarcinomas, 44 invasive mucinous adenocarcinomas, and three other variants. The invasive mucinous adenocarcinomas had a lower prevalence of EGFR mutations but a higher prevalence of KRAS, ALK, and HER2 mutations than invasive adenocarcinomas. Smoking, a solid predominant pattern, and a mucinous component were independently associated with fewer EGFR mutations. The ALK rearrangements were more frequently observed in tumors with a minor mucinous component, while the KRAS mutations were more prevalent in smokers. In addition, 503 patients with stage I-IIIA tumors were analyzed for overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival. The stage and histological pattern were independent predictors of relapse-free survival, and the pathological stage was the only independent predictor for the OS. Although patients with the EGFR mutations had better OS than those without the mutations, no oncogenic mutation was an independent predictor of survival. Oncogenic mutations were associated with the novel IASLC/ATS/ERS classification, which facilitates a morphology-based mutational analysis strategy. The combination of these two classifications might not increase the prognostic ability, but it provides essential information for personalized treatment. ",

These include but are not limited to the anti-CD20 antibody Rituximab, used in lymphoma treatment, as well as anti-HER-2 antibody for breast cancer therapy. The efficacy of this cancer immunotherapy modality is, however, limited by the large size of the antibody (160 kd) and its relatively nonspecific binding to the reticuloendothelial system. This latter property is particularly problematic if the antibody is used as a vehicle to deliver radionuclides, cytotoxic drugs, or toxins to the tumor site. Peptides, peptidomimetic, or small molecules are thus attractive as alternative cell surface targeting agents for cancer imaging and therapy. Cancer cell surface targeting peptides can be derived from known native peptide hormones such as somatostatin and bombesin, or they can be identified through screening combinatorial peptide libraries against unknown cell surface receptor targets. Phage-display peptide library and one-bead one-compound (OBOC) combinatorial library methods have been successfully used to discover peptides that target cancer cells or tumor blood vessel endothelial cells. The phage-display peptide library method, because of its biological nature, can only display l-amino acid peptides. In contrast, the OBOC combinatorial library method allows for bead-surface display of peptides that contain l-amino acids, d-amino acids, unnatural amino acids, or other organic moieties. We have successfully used the OBOC method to discover and optimize ligands against unique cell surface receptors of prostate cancer, T- and B-cell lymphoma, as well as ovarian and lung cancers, and we have used some of these peptides to image xenografts in nude mice with high specificity. Here, we (i) review the literature on the use of phage-display and OBOC combinatorial library methods to discover cancer and tumor blood vessel targeting ligands, and (ii) report on the use of an ovarian cancer targeting ligand, OA02, as an in vivo PET imaging probe in a xenograft model in nude mice.",

It is known that many patients with non-small-cell lung cancer who respond to the EGFR inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib have tumors with EGFR-activating mutations. This might suggest that patients with head and neck squamous carcinoma, who also have tumors with EGFR-activating mutations, might represent a patient population who could benefit from gefitinib or erlotinib therapy. High-resolution melting amplicon analysis (HRMAA) is a recently described technique which can be used for screening tumor DNA isolated from paraffin blocks for tyrosine kinase-activating mutations. In this report we screened 24 cases of squamous cell carcinoma, either primary in the head and neck or secondarily involving the head and neck area, for activating mutations in EGFR exons 18, 19, 20, 21, and for HER2 exons 19 and 20. All cases were followed up by direct DNA sequencing. Two (8%) of the 24 cases were positive. One case was a maxillary sinus tumor which contained an exon 20-activating mutation (N771YinsG). Surprisingly, the other case was a primary squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which invaded the head and neck area only secondarily. This tumor contained an exon 19-activating mutation (G729E). No HER2-activating mutations were found. The presence of a small number of squamous cell carcinomas in the head and neck area with EGFR-activating mutations suggests the existence of a population of patients who could derive benefit from gefitinib or erlotinib therapy.

Here, we report BAY 80-6946, a highly selective and potent pan-class I PI3K inhibitor with sub-nanomolar IC50s against PI3Kα and PI3Kδ. BAY 80-6946 exhibited preferential inhibition (about 10-fold) of AKT phosphorylation by PI3Kα compared with PI3Kβ in cells. BAY 80-6946 showed superior antitumor activity (>40-fold) in PIK3CA mutant and/or HER2 overexpression as compared with HER2-negative and wild-type PIK3CA breast cancer cell lines. In addition, BAY 80-6946 revealed potent activity to induce apoptosis in a subset of tumor cells with aberrant activation of PI3K as a single agent. In vivo, single intravenous administration of BAY 80-6946 exhibited higher exposure and prolonged inhibition of pAKT levels in tumors versus plasma. BAY 80-6946 is efficacious in tumors with activated PI3K when dosed either continuously or intermittently. Thus, BAY 80-6946 induced 100% complete tumor regression when dosed as a single agent every second day in rats bearing HER2-amplified and PIK3CA-mutated KPL4 breast tumors. In combination with paclitaxel, weekly dosing of BAY 80-6946 is sufficient to reach sustained response in all animals bearing patient-derived non-small cell lung cancer xenografts, despite a short plasma elimination half-life (1 hour) in mice. Thus, BAY 80-6946 is a promising agent with differential pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic properties for the treatment of PI3K-dependent human tumors.",

However, the correlation between the duration and magnitude of Hsp90 inhibition and the downstream effects on client protein degradation and cancer cell growth inhibition has not been thoroughly investigated. To investigate the relationship between Hsp90 inhibition and cellular effects, we developed a method that measures drug occupancy on Hsp90 after treatment with the Hsp90 inhibitor IPI-504 in living cells and in tumor xenografts. In cells, we find the level of Hsp90 occupancy to be directly correlated with cell growth inhibition. At the molecular level, the relationship between Hsp90 occupancy and Hsp90 client protein degradation was examined for different client proteins. For sensitive Hsp90 clients (e.g. HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2), client protein levels directly mirror Hsp90 occupancy at all time points after IPI-504 administration. For insensitive client proteins, we find that protein abundance matches Hsp90 occupancy only after prolonged incubation with drug. Additionally, we investigate the correlation between plasma pharmacokinetics (PK), tumor PK, pharmacodynamics (PD) (client protein degradation), tumor growth inhibition, and Hsp90 occupancy in a xenograft model of human cancer. Our results indicate Hsp90 occupancy to be a better predictor of PD than either plasma PK or tumor PK. In the nonsmall cell lung cancer xenograft model studied, a linear correlation between Hsp90 occupancy and tumor growth inhibition was found. This novel binding assay was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo and could be used as a pharmacodynamic readout in the clinic.",

Our goal was to design a small peptide that possesses similar functions to an antibody drug conjugate with regard to targeting and killing cancer cells, but that overcomes size restrictions.;We designed a novel cancer-specific killer peptide created by fusion of the toxic peptide (KLAKLAK)2 with the cancer recognition peptide LTVSPWY.;This bi-functional peptide showed toxicity to breast cancer, prostate cancer, and neuroblastoma cell lines. Only low toxicity to non-cancer cells, colon cancer, lung cancer, and lymphoma cell lines was observed. In vivo injections of the bi-functional peptide caused tumor growth retardation compared to mice treated with control peptides. The bi-functional peptide caused retardation of MDA-MB-435S tumors in vivo and increased survival to 80% at day 100 after tumor implantation, whereas all control animals died at day 70. Previous reports showed that the recognition moiety LTVSPWY targets the tumor-associated antigen HER2. Here we found that our new peptide TP-Tox also excerts toxic effects on HER2-negative cell lines. Therefore, we searched for the molecular target of the bi-specific peptide using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. Our data suggest a possible interaction with RAS GTPase-activating protein binding protein 1 (G3BP1).;We designed a bi-functional peptide of 23 amino acids and demonstrated its ability to bind and kill several cancer cell lines in vitro and to strongly increase survival in breast cancer bearing mice in vivo.

The clinical course of patients after given diagnosis of prostate cancer is highly variable and the underlying reasons for such variability remain elusive. To better understand the pathophysiology of prostate cancer, there has been a push to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that mediate the development and progression of prostate cancer. Recent literature has pointed that a complex interplay between various cytokines, growth factors, and androgen receptors regulate the growth and functions of the prostate gland. Amongst the currently implicated anomalous pathways involved in prostate oncogenesis, the IGF-IGFBP axis has been demonstrated to play a very important role, although the precise molecular events regulated by IGF remain to be elucidated. The tumor promoting functions of VEGF has been defined in tumor angiogenesis and currently remains the central focus of anti-angiogenesis therapy in prostate cancer. Another key cytokine, TGF-beta has tumor-suppressor functions in normal prostate gland, but its pleiotropic functions in prostate cancer are influenced by the hormonal state of the disease. In partnership with other deregulated growth factor signaling, the TGF-beta cascade has also been implicated in the spread of prostate cancer. Lastly, members of the EGFR family, particularly the HER2 receptor, have also been recognized as crucial elements of aberrant signal transduction pathways, which induce activation of downstream signaling, involved in cellular proliferation, cell survival, and angiogenesis. The abnormal function of a number of growth factors in prostate cancer biology explains the heterogeneity of its histologic grade, mode of presentation and disease prognosis. At the same time, continued research in this field allows for the potential development of drug therapies against a diverse pool of cancer causing targets.",

However, drug delivery into primary brain tumors and metastases is impeded by the blood-brain tumor barrier (BTB), significantly limiting drug use in brain cancer treatment.;We examined the effect of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors in nude mice on drug delivery to intracranially implanted human lung and breast tumors as the most common primary tumors forming brain metastases, and studied underlying mechanisms of drug transport. In vitro assays demonstrated that PDE5 inhibitors enhanced the uptake of [(14)C]dextran and trastuzumab (Herceptin, a humanized monoclonal antibody against HER2/neu) by cultured mouse brain endothelial cells (MBEC). The mechanism of drug delivery was examined using inhibitors for caveolae-mediated endocytosis, macropinocytosis and coated pit/clathrin endocytosis. Inhibitor analysis strongly implicated caveolae and macropinocytosis endocytic pathways involvement in the PDE5 inhibitor-enhanced Herceptin uptake by MBEC. Oral administration of PDE5 inhibitor, vardenafil, to mice with HER2-positive intracranial lung tumors led to an increased tumor permeability to high molecular weight [(14)C]dextran (2.6-fold increase) and to Herceptin (2-fold increase). Survival time of intracranial lung cancer-bearing mice treated with Herceptin in combination with vardenafil was significantly increased as compared to the untreated, vardenafil- or Herceptin-treated mice (p<0.01). Log-rank survival analysis of mice bearing HER2-positive intracranial breast tumor also showed a significant survival increase (p<0.02) in the group treated with Herceptin plus vardenafil as compared to other groups. However, vardenafil did not exert any beneficial effect on survival of mice bearing intracranial breast tumor with low HER2 expression and co-treated with Herceptin (p>0.05).;These findings suggest that PDE5 inhibitors may effectively modulate BTB permeability, and enhance delivery and therapeutic efficacy of monoclonal antibodies in hard-to-treat brain metastases from different primary tumors that had metastasized to the brain.",

However, nothing is currently known about the role of this tumor suppressor in breast cancer. Here, we test the hypothesis that loss of REST function plays a role in breast cancer. To assay breast tumors for REST function, we developed a 24-gene signature composed of direct targets of the transcriptional repressor. Using the 24- gene signature, we identified a previously undefined RESTless breast tumor subtype. Using gene set enrichment analysis, we confirmed the aberrant expression of REST target genes in the REST-less tumors, including neuronal gene targets of REST that are normally not expressed outside the nervous system. Examination of REST mRNA identified a truncated splice variant of REST present in the REST-less tumor population, but not other tumors. Histological analysis of 182 outcome-associated breast tumor tissues also identified a subpopulation of tumors that lack full-length, functional REST and over-express the neuroendocrine marker and REST target gene Chromogranin A. Importantly, patients whose tumors were found to be REST-less using either the 24-gene signature or histology had significantly poorer prognosis and were more than twice as likely to undergo disease recurrence within the first 3 years after diagnosis. We show here that REST function is lost in breast cancer, at least in part via an alternative splicing mechanism. Patients with REST-less breast cancer undergo significantly more early disease recurrence than those with fully functional REST, regardless of estrogen receptor or HER2 status. Importantly, REST status may serve as a predictor of poor prognosis, helping to untangle the heterogeneity inherent in disease course and response to treatment. Additionally, the alternative splicing observed in REST-less breast cancer is an attractive therapeutic target.",

Erlotinib has also prolonged survival in pancreatic cancer patients when added to gemcitabine and regulatory approval in this disease is being sought. Additional promising activity has been seen in other tumor types, such as ovarian cancer or head and neck malignancies, and phase III trials in these malignancies are ongoing or planned. Despite these successes, these agents have exhibited anecdotal or modest activity when used as single agents in unselected patients with various other tumor types. We have learned that the clinical development of these agents is far from simple and we need to better understand biological and clinical criteria for patient selection and how to best use the different available agents. The recent discovery of EGFR mutations and the potential identification of other markers that might predict patient response could help to optimize the use of these agents in the future. Irreversible EGFR inhibitors, dual EGF/HER2 and pan-ErbB receptor inhibitors may have greater antitumor activity although the tolerance of these compounds compared to specific EGFR TKIs needs further characterization. HER2 specific TKIs are also in development. Lapatinib, a dual EGFR/HER2 TK inhibitors, is particularly promising in breast cancer.

Measurement of PD-L1 protein is limited by the lack of standardized immunohistochemical methods and variable performance of antibodies. Our goal was to correlate PD-L1 mRNA expression with clinical variables in primary breast carcinomas.;The fluorescent RNAscope paired-primer assay was used to quantify in situ PD-L1 mRNA levels in 636 stage I-III breast carcinomas on two sets of tissue microarrays [YTMA128 (n = 238) and YTMA201 (n = 398)]. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) were assessed by hematoxylin/eosin stain and quantitative fluorescence.;On YTMA128 and YTMA201, 55.7% and 59.5% of cases showed PD-L1 mRNA expression, respectively. Higher PD-L1 mRNA expression was significantly associated with increased TILs (P = 0.04) but not with other clinical variables. Elevated TILs (scores 2 and 3+) occurred in 16.5% on YTMA128 and 14.8% on YTMA201 and was associated with estrogen receptor-negative status (P = 0.01 on YTMA128 and 0.0001 on YTMA201).

These have been completed in conjunction with internal and external stakeholders, including a Provincial Expert Panel on Pharmacogenomics (PEPP). Within the PEPP, subgroup committees were developed for each disease area. For each technology, an economic analysis was also completed by the Toronto Health Economics and Technology Assessment Collaborative (THETA) and is summarized within the reports.THE FOLLOWING REPORTS CAN BE PUBLICLY ACCESSED AT THE MAS WEBSITE AT: www.health.gov.on.ca/mas or at www.health.gov.on.ca/english/providers/program/mas/mas_about.htmlGENE EXPRESSION PROFILING FOR GUIDING ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY DECISIONS IN WOMEN WITH EARLY BREAST CANCER: An Evidence-Based and Economic AnalysisEpidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutation (EGFR) Testing for Prediction of Response to EGFR-Targeting Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) Drugs in Patients with Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: An Evidence-Based and Ecopnomic AnalysisK-RAS testing in Treatment Decisions for Advanced Colorectal Cancer: an Evidence-Based and Economic Analysis;To review and synthesize the available evidence regarding the laboratory performance, prognostic value, and predictive value of Oncotype-DX for the target population.;CONDITION AND TARGET POPULATION The target population of this review is women with newly diagnosed early stage (stage I-IIIa) invasive breast cancer that is estrogen-receptor (ER) positive and/or progesterone-receptor (PR) positive. Much of this review, however, is relevant for women with early stage (I and II) invasive breast cancer that is specifically ER positive, lymph node (LN) negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2/neu) negative. This refined population represents an estimated incident population of 3,315 new breast cancers in Ontario (according to 2007 data). Currently it is estimated that only 15% of these women will develop a distant metastasis at 10 years; however, a far great proportion currently receive adjuvant chemotherapy, suggesting that more women are being treated with chemotherapy than can benefit. There is therefore a need to develop better prognostic and predictive tools to improve the selection of women that may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.  TECHNOLOGY OF CONCERN: The Oncotype-DX Breast Cancer Assay (Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA) quantifies gene expression for 21 genes in breast cancer tissue by performing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks that are obtained during initial surgery (lumpectomy, mastectomy, or core biopsy) of women with early breast cancer that is newly diagnosed. The panel of 21 genes include genes associated with tumour proliferation and invasion, as well as other genes related to HER-2/neu expression, ER expression, and progesterone receptor (PR) expression.;What is the laboratory performance of Oncotype-DX?How reliable is Oncotype-DX (i.e., how repeatable and reproducible is Oncotype-DX)?How often does Oncotype-DX fail to give a useable result?What is the prognostic value of Oncotype-DX?Is Oncotype-DX recurrence score associated with the risk of distant recurrence or death due to any cause in women with early breast cancer receiving tamoxifen?What is the predictive value of Oncotype-DX?Does Oncoytpe-DX recurrence score predict significant benefit in terms of improvements in 10-year distant recurrence or death due to any cause for women receiving tamoxifen plus chemotherapy in comparison to women receiving tamoxifen alone?How does Oncotype-DX compare to other known predictors of risk such as Adjuvant! Online?How does Oncotype-DX impact patient quality of life and clinical/patient decision-making?;A literature search was performed on March 19(th), 2010 using OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Library, and the International Agency for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA) for studies published from January 1(st), 2006 to March 19(th), 2010. A starting search date of January 1(st), 2006 was because a comprehensive systematic review of Oncotype-DX was identified in preliminary literature searching. This systematic review, by Marchionni et al. (2008), included literature up to January 1(st), 2007. All studies identified in the review by Marchionni et al. as well as those identified in updated literature searching were used to form the evidentiary base of this review. The quality of the overall body of evidence was identified as high, moderate, low or very low according to GRADE methodology.;Any observational trial, controlled clinical trial, randomized controlled trial (RCT), meta-analysis or systematic review that reported on the laboratory performance, prognostic value and/or predictive value of Oncotype-DX testing, or other outcome relevant to the Key Questions, specific to the target population was included.;Studies that did not report original data or original data analysis,Studies published in a language other than English,Studies reported only in abstract or as poster presentations (such publications were not sought nor included in this review since the MAS does not generally consider evidence that is not subject to peer review nor does the MAS consider evidence that lacks detailed description of methodology).;Outcomes of interest varied depending on the Key Question. For the Key Questions of prognostic and predictive value (Key Questions #2 and #3), the prospectively defined primary outcome was risk of 10-year distant recurrence. The prospectively defined secondary outcome was 10-year death due to any cause (i.e., overall survival). All additional outcomes such as risk of locoregional recurrence or disease-free survival (DFS) were not prospectively determined for this review but were reported as presented in included trials; these outcomes are referenced as tertiary outcomes in this review. Outcomes for other Key Questions (i.e., Key Questions #1, #4 and #5) were not prospectively defined due to the variability in endpoints relevant for these questions."}]
