Treatment with a single TKI represents a logical step toward personalized cancer therapy, but intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms limit their long-term benefit. In this study, we deployed RNAi-based functional genomic screens to identify protein kinases controlling the intrinsic sensitivity of FGFR1-dependent lung cancer and head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) cells to ponatinib, a multikinase FGFR-active inhibitor. We identified and validated a synthetic lethal interaction between MTOR and ponatinib in non-small cell lung carcinoma cells. In addition, treatment with MTOR-targeting shRNAs and pharmacologic inhibitors revealed that MTOR is an essential protein kinase in other FGFR1-expressing cancer cells. The combination of FGFR inhibitors and MTOR or AKT inhibitors resulted in synergistic growth suppression in vitro. Notably, tumor xenografts generated from FGFR1-dependent lung cancer cells exhibited only modest sensitivity to monotherapy with the FGFR-specific TKI, AZD4547, but when combined with the MTOR inhibitor, AZD2014, significantly attenuated tumor growth and prolonged survival. Our findings support the existence of a signaling network wherein FGFR1-driven ERK and activated MTOR/AKT represent distinct arms required to induce full transformation. Furthermore, they suggest that clinical efficacy of treatments for FGFR1-driven lung cancers and HNSCC may be achieved by combining MTOR inhibitors and FGFR-specific TKIs.",

To achieve this goal, a close interaction between basic researchers, clinical scientists, molecular pathologists, and pharmaceutical companies is essential. We believe that this approach is worth the effort, since personalized therapy in lung cancer has the potential to substantially improve survival in an increasing number of patients. At the moment, established personalized treatment approaches include treatment of patients with NSCLC and activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations with the EGFR-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib or erlotinib, and treatment of NSCLC patients with genetic aberrations in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) oncogene with the mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET)/ALK inhibitor crizotinib.

We tried to identify the frequency of FGFR1 amplifications among Korean patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Additionally, we examined the clinical significance of FGFR1 amplifications for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) among SCLC patients who received standard chemotherapies.;Tumor tissues from 158 Korean patients diagnosed with SCLC from September 2009 to February 2013 were collected and analyzed using an FGFR1 FISH assay with a probe that hybridized to chromosome region 8p12-8p11.23 (Abbott Molecular, Abbott Park, IL).;FGFR1 amplification was detected in three patients (1.9%) harboring extensive disease (ED). A multivariate analysis showed that among the patients with ED, FGFR1 amplification was associated with shorter disease-free survival to first-line chemotherapy with etoposide plus cisplatin or carboplatin (hazard ratio [HR]=7.1; 95% confidence interval [CI]=2.0-25.4; P=0.003). The median overall survival time of the patients with ED was 8.2 and 10.2 months among patients with and without FGFR1 amplification, respectively (P=0.37). Although FGFR1 amplification is rare in SCLC compared to non-small cell lung cancer or other malignancies with squamous histology, it is associated with poor survival following standard chemotherapy in SCLC. Further studies in large cohorts of patients with SCLC are needed to verify these results. Our results imply that FGFR1 may be a potential therapeutic target in SCLC and it could be confirmed in a clinical trial.",

The FGFR inhibitor nintedanib has recently been approved for treatment of lung adenocarcinoma and is currently evaluated for small cell lung cancer (SCLC). However, tumor recurrence due to development of nintedanib resistance might occur. Hence, we aimed at characterizing the molecular mechanisms underlying acquired nintedanib resistance in FGFR1-driven lung cancer. Chronic nintedanib exposure of the FGFR1-driven SCLC cell line DMS114 (DMS114/NIN) but not of two NSCLC cell lines induced massive overexpression of the multidrug-resistance transporter ABCB1. Indeed, we proved nintedanib to be both substrate and modulator of ABCB1-mediated efflux. Importantly, the oncogenic FGFR1 signaling axis remained active in DMS114/NIN cells while bioinformatic analyses suggested hyperactivation of the endothelin-A receptor (ETAR) signaling axis. Indeed, ETAR inhibition resensitized DMS114/NIN cells against nintedanib by downregulation of ABCB1 expression. PKC and downstream NFκB were identified as major downstream players in ETAR-mediated ABCB1 hyperactivation. Summarizing, ABCB1 needs to be considered as a factor underlying nintedanib resistance. Combination approaches with ETAR antagonists or switching to non-ABCB1 substrate FGFR inhibitors represent innovative strategies to manage nintedanib resistance in lung cancer.",

Mutated genes were correlated with clinical outcomes using Kaplan-Meier methods (PFS, OS) and logistic regression (chemo-response). RB1 protein expression was detected by either western blotting of cultured cell lysates or immunohistochemistry of tumor specimens.;In all, 39 patients had ES-SCLC; 15 patients had either primary refractory/resistant disease and 21 patients had sensitive disease. The two most frequently mutated genes were TP53 (86%) and RB1 (58%); other frequently mutated genes (>10% patients) were involved in epigenetic regulation as well as the mTOR pathway. We identified a number of low-frequency, targetable mutations, including RICTOR, FGFR1, KIT, PTCH1 and RET. Using multivariate analysis, RB1 was the only significant factor (P = 0.038) in predicting response to first-line chemotherapy, with an odds ratio of 5.58 comparing mutant RB1 with wild-type. Patients with mutant RB1 had both better OS (11.7 versus 9.1 months P = 0.04) and PFS (11.2 versus 8.6 months, P = 0.06) compared with patients with wild-type RB1.

In this study, we evaluated fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and ligand expression in primary SCLC samples.;FGFR1 protein expression, messenger RNA (mRNA) levels, and gene copy number were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC), mRNA in situ hybridization, and silver in situ hybridization, respectively, in primary tumors from 90 patients with SCLC. Protein and mRNA expression of the FGF2 and FGF9 ligands were determined by IHC and mRNA in situ hybridization, respectively. In addition, a second cohort of 24 SCLC biopsy samples with known FGFR1 amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization was assessed for FGFR1 protein expression by IHC. Spearman correlation analysis was performed to evaluate associations of FGFR1, FGF2 and FGF9 protein levels, respective mRNA levels, and FGFR1 gene copy number.;FGFR1 protein expression by IHC demonstrated a significant correlation with FGFR1 mRNA levels (p < 0.0001) and FGFR1 gene copy number (p = 0.03).

Although lung adenocarcinomas with EGFR mutations or EML4-ALK fusions respond to treatment by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibition, respectively, squamous cell lung cancer currently lacks therapeutically exploitable genetic alterations. We conducted a systematic search in a set of 232 lung cancer specimens for genetic alterations that were therapeutically amenable and then performed high-resolution gene copy number analyses. We identified frequent and focal fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) amplification in squamous cell lung cancer (n = 155), but not in other lung cancer subtypes, and, by fluorescence in situ hybridization, confirmed the presence of FGFR1 amplifications in an independent cohort of squamous cell lung cancer samples (22% of cases). Using cell-based screening with the FGFR inhibitor PD173074 in a large (n = 83) panel of lung cancer cell lines, we demonstrated that this compound inhibited growth and induced apoptosis specifically in those lung cancer cells carrying amplified FGFR1. We validated the FGFR1 dependence of FGFR1-amplified cell lines by FGFR1 knockdown and by ectopic expression of an FGFR1-resistant allele (FGFR1(V561M)), which rescued FGFR1-amplified cells from PD173074-mediated cytotoxicity. Finally, we showed that inhibition of FGFR1 with a small molecule led to significant tumor shrinkage in vivo. Thus, focal FGFR1 amplification is common in squamous cell lung cancer and associated with tumor growth and survival, suggesting that FGFR inhibitors may be a viable therapeutic option in this cohort of patients.",

Tumor cells coexpressing MYC were more sensitive to FGFR inhibition, suggesting that patients with FGFR1-amplified and MYC-overexpressing tumors may benefit from FGFR inhibitor therapy.

        "Doc_abstract":"Targeted therapies are effective in subsets of lung cancers with EGFR mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocations. Large-scale genomics have recently expanded the lung cancer landscape with FGFR1 amplification found in 10-20% of squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). However, the response rates have been low for biomarker-directed fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor therapy in SCC, which contrasts to the relatively high rates of response seen in EGFR mutant and ALK-translocated lung cancers treated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors and ALK inhibitors, respectively. In order to better understand the low response rates of FGFR1-amplified lung cancers to FGFR inhibitors, relationships between gene copy number, mRNA expression and protein expression of FGFR1 were assessed in cell lines, tumor specimens and data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The importance of these factors for the sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors was determined by analyzing drug screen data and conducting in vitro and in vivo experiments. We report that there was a discrepancy between FGFR1 amplification level and FGFR1 protein expression in a number of these cell lines, and the cancers with unexpectedly low FGFR1 expression were uniformly resistant to the different FGFR inhibitors. Further interrogation of the receptor tyrosine kinase activity in these discordant cell lines revealed co-activation of HER2 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRα) caused by gene amplification or ligand overexpression maintained phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and MEK/ERK signaling even in the presence of FGFR inhibitor. Accordingly, co-inhibition of FGFR1 and HER2 or PDGFRα led to enhanced drug responses. In contrast, FGFR1-amplified high FGFR1 protein-expressing lung cancers are sensitive to FGFR inhibitor monotherapy by downregulating ERK signaling. Addition of a PI3K inhibitor to these high FGFR1 protein-expressing cancers further sensitized them to FGFR inhibitor. These data reveal that biomarker-directed trials for FGFR1-amplified SCC require assessment of FGFR1 protein expression and uncover novel therapeutic strategies for FGFR1-amplified SCC with low FGFR1 protein expression.

However, there are very few reports on the molecular profiles of small cell lung cancers (SCLCs). We therefore conducted the present Shizuoka Lung Cancer Mutation Study to analyze genomic aberrations in patients with thoracic malignancies.;We collected samples of SCLC from a biobank system and analyzed their molecular profiles. We assessed 23 mutations in nine genes (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, NRAS, MEK1, AKT1, PTEN, and HER2) using pyrosequencing plus capillary electrophoresis. We also amplified EGFR, MET, PIK3CA, FGFR1, and FGFR2 using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the fusion genes ALK, ROS1, and RET using reverse transcription PCR.;Between July 2011 and January 2013, 60 SCLC patients were enrolled in the study. Samples included eight surgically resected snap-frozen samples, 50 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, and seven pleural effusion samples. We detected 13 genomic aberrations in nine cases (15%), including an EGFR mutation (n=1, G719A), a KRAS mutation (n=1, G12D), PIK3CA mutations (n=3, E542K, E545K, E545Q), an AKT1 mutation (n=1, E17K), a MET amplification (n=1), and PIK3CA amplifications (n=6). EGFR and KRAS mutations were found in patients with combined SCLC and adenocarcinoma. No significant differences were detected in the characteristics of patients with and without genomic aberrations. However, serum neuron-specific enolase and progastrin-releasing peptide levels were significantly higher in patients without genomic aberrations than in those with aberrations (p=0.01 and 0.04, respectively).;Genomic aberrations were found in 15% SCLC patients, with PIK3CA amplifications most frequently observed. To further our understanding of the molecular profiles of SCLC, comprehensive mutational analyses should be conducted using massive parallel sequencing.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Lung cancers are characterised by abundant genetic diversity with relatively few recurrent mutations occurring at high frequency. However, the genetic alterations often affect a common group of oncogenic signalling pathways. There have been vast improvements in our understanding of the molecular biology that underpins lung cancer in recent years and this has led to a revolution in the diagnosis and treatment of lung adenocarcinomas (ADC) based on the genotype of an individual's tumour. New technologies are identifying key and potentially targetable genetic aberrations not only in adenocarcinoma but also in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung. Lung cancer mutations have been identified in v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), BRAF and the parallel phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway oncogenes and more recently in MEK and HER2 while structural rearrangements in ALK, ROS1 and possibly rearranged during transfection (RET) provide new therapeutic targets. Amplification is another mechanism of activation of oncogenes such as MET in adenocarcinoma, fibroblastgrowth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) in SCC. Intriguingly, many of these genetic alternations are associated with smoking status and with particular racial and gender differences, which may provide insight into the mechanisms of carcinogenesis and role of host factors in lung cancer development and progression. The role of tumour suppressor genes is increasingly recognised with aberrations reported in TP53, PTEN, RB1, LKB11 and p16/CDKN2A. Identification of biologically significant genetic alterations in lung cancer that lead to activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumour suppressor genes has the potential to provide further therapeutic opportunities. It is hoped that these discoveries may make a major contribution to improving outcome for patients with this poor prognosis disease. ",

In this study, we aimed to establish a variety of patient-derived NSCLC models and characterize these for common genetic aberrations to provide more informative models for preclinical drug efficacy testing.;NSCLC tissues from thirty-one patients were collected and implanted into immunodeficient mice. Established xenograft models were characterized for common genetic aberrations, including detection of gene mutations within EGFR and KRAS, and genetic amplification of FGFR1 and cMET.

Genetic aberrations were detected in six of the models, including one model with an EGFR activating mutation (Exon19 Del), one model with KRAS mutation, one model with both KRAS mutation and cMET gene amplification, and three models with FGFR1 amplification. Anti-tumor efficacy studies using gefitinib demonstrated that the EGFR activating mutation model had superior sensitivity and that the KRAS mutation models were resistant to gefitinib. The range of gefitinib responses in the patient-derived NSCLC xenograft models were consistent with the results reported from clinical trials. Furthermore, we observed that patient-derived NSCLC models with FGFR1 gene amplification were insensitive to gefitinib treatment.;Ten patient-derived NSCLC xenograft models were established containing a variety of genetic aberrations including EGFR activating mutation, KRAS mutation, and FGFR1 and cMET amplification.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) detects chromosomal alterations that underlie the development and progression of cancer, and pinpoints targets of new anticancer drugs. Detection of such targets by FISH can be of diagnostic utility in morphologically difficult cases. Multitarget FISH with four different chromosomal probes improves the sensitivity of cytology in the diagnosis of lung cancer and clarifies equivocal cytological findings. FISH is becoming increasingly important in the field of predictive marker analysis. FISH is the gold standard to identify ALK rearrangements for treatment with the ALK inhibitor crizotinib (Xalkori). EGFR mutation analysis is the method of choice for selecting patients for therapy with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), whereas the EGFR gene copy number has not been confirmed as a reliable predictive marker. MET amplification is an important mechanism of secondary resistance to EGFR TKIs and a candidate predictive marker for targeted second-line treatment of TKI-resistant non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. FGFR1 amplification is a promising new marker in squamous cell carcinoma that may predict the response to FGFR1 inhibitors.

PDX characterization was performed by histopathological, immunohistochemical, aCGH and next-generation sequencing approaches. For this model system, the tumor take rate was 35%, with higher rates for squamous carcinoma (60%) than for adenocarcinoma (13%). Patients for whom PDX tumors were obtained had a significantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS) compared to patients for whom no PDX tumors (P = 0.039) were obtained.

In recent years, the treatment for lung adenocarcinoma has made a great progress, targeted therapy has been widely applied in clinic, and benefits amount of patients. However, in squamous cell lung cancer, the incidence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutant and ALK fusion gene are low,and targeted therapy like Tarceva and crizotinib, can hardly work. Since the fibroblast growth factors (fibroblast growth factor, FGF) pathway is considered to be related to tumor cell proliferation, metastasis and angiogenesis, more and more researches proved the amplification of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) in squamous cell lung cancer. Experiments in vivo and in vitro found that blocking FGF pathway could reduce the proliferation of tumor cells and inhibit metastasis. The FGF pathway might be a new target for treatment of squamous cell lung cancer. This article reviews the effect of FGFR in tumorigenesis,as well as the prospect as a therapeutic target in non-small cell lung cancer.;肺癌严重威胁人类的健康，近年来肺腺癌的治疗方式取得了巨大的进展，许多靶向治疗药物已广泛应用于临床并不同程度的使患者受益。而肺鳞癌中表皮生长因子受体（epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFR）基因突变以及ALK融合基因发生率低，使用吉非替尼及克唑替尼等酪氨酸激酶抑制剂治疗有效率低。一直以来成纤维生长因子（fibroblast growth factor, FGF）通路的异常被认为与肿瘤的增殖、血管生成等方面密切相关，近年越来越多的研究发现非小细胞肺癌中存在成纤维生长因子受体1（fibroblast growth factor receptor 1, FGFR1）基因扩增，体外及体内实验发现阻断FGF通路可降低肿瘤细胞的增殖、抑制远处转移、逆转靶向治疗耐药。本文就FGFR在非小细胞肺癌中的表达以及作为治疗靶点的前景作一综述。",

Frequencies of genetic alterations were compared with those of 141 SCLCs (50 surgically resected cases and biopsies of 91 advanced cases).;We found a relatively high prevalence of inactivating mutations in TP53 (71%) and RB1 (26%), but the mutation frequency in RB1 was lower than that in SCLCs (40%, P = 0.039). Additionally, genetic alterations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway were detected in 12 (15%) of the tumors: PIK3CA 3%, PTEN 4%, AKT2 4%, RICTOR 5% and mTOR 1%. Other activating alterations were detected in KRAS (6%), FGFR1 (5%), KIT (4%), ERBB2 (4%), HRAS (1%) and EGFR (1%).

Activating alterations in a variety of potential oncogenic driver genes have also been identified in NSCLC, including ROS1, RET, MET, HER2, and BRAF. Together with EGFR and ALK, these mutations account for ∼20% of NSCLCs. The identification of these oncogenic drivers has led to the design of rationally targeted therapies that have produced superior clinical outcomes in tumours harbouring these mutations. Many patients, however, have de novo or acquired resistance to these therapies. In addition, most NSCLCs are genetically complex tumours harbouring multiple potential activating events. For these patients, disease subsets are likely to be defined by combination strategies involving a number of targeted agents. These targets include FGFR1, PTEN, MET, MEK, PD-1/PD-L1, and NaPi2b. In light of the myriad new biomarkers and targeted agents, multiplex testing strategies will be invaluable in identifying the appropriate patients for each therapy and enabling targeted agents to be channelled to the patients most likely to gain benefit.

However, mechanistic strategies to target tumor cells carrying such mutations are yet to be developed. This study proposes a synthetic-lethality therapy for treating cancers deficient in the SWI/SNF catalytic (ATPase) subunit, BRG1/SMARCA4. The strategy relies upon inhibition of BRM/SMARCA2, another catalytic SWI/SNF subunit with a BRG1-related activity. Immunohistochemical analysis of a cohort of non-small-cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) indicated that 15.5% (16 of 103) of the cohort, corresponding to preferentially undifferentiated tumors, was deficient in BRG1 expression. All BRG1-deficient cases were negative for alterations in known therapeutic target genes, for example, EGFR and DDR2 gene mutations, ALK gene fusions, or FGFR1 gene amplifications. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated silencing of BRM suppressed the growth of BRG1-deficient cancer cells relative to BRG1-proficient cancer cells, inducing senescence via activation of p21/CDKN1A. This growth suppression was reversed by transduction of wild-type but not ATPase-deficient BRG1. In support of these in vitro results, a conditional RNAi study conducted in vivo revealed that BRM depletion suppressed the growth of BRG1-deficient tumor xenografts. Our results offer a rationale to develop BRM-ATPase inhibitors as a strategy to treat BRG1/SMARCA4-deficient cancers, including NSCLCs that lack mutations in presently known therapeutic target genes.",

Aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of FGF/FGFR-mediated signals to the malignant growth of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to assess their potential as targets for therapeutic interventions. Multiple FGFR mRNA splice variants were coexpressed in NSCLC cells (n = 16) with predominance of FGFR1. Accordingly, both expression of a dominant-negative FGFR1 (dnFGFR1) IIIc-green fluorescent protein fusion protein and application of FGFR small-molecule inhibitors (SU5402 and PD166866) significantly reduced growth, survival, clonogenicity, and migratory potential of the majority of NSCLC cell lines. Moreover, dnFGFR1 expression completely blocked or at least significantly attenuated s.c. tumor formation of NSCLC cells in severe combined immunodeficient mice. Xenograft tumors expressing dnFGFR1 exhibited significantly reduced size and mitosis rate, enhanced cell death, and decreased tissue invasion. When FGFR inhibitors were combined with chemotherapy, antagonistic to synergistic in vitro anticancer activities were obtained depending on the application schedule. In contrast, simultaneous blockage of FGFR- and epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated signals exerted synergistic effects. In summary, FGFR-mediated signals in cooperation with those transmitted by epidermal growth factor receptor are involved in growth and survival of human NSCLC cells and should be considered as targets for combined therapeutic approaches.",

Two independent pathologists evaluated FGFR1, FGF2, and PI3K (p110α) expressions in both tumor and stromal tissues from 99 of the patients with sufficient tissue samples, using immunohistochemistry. Considering survival analysis separately for patients with both early and advanced stage diseases, the relationship between the clinical features of the patients and expressions were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses.;FGFR1 expression was found to be low in 59 (60%) patients and high in 40 (40%) patients.

In univariate analysis, overall survival (OS) was significantly associated with stage of the disease and the performance status of the patient (P<0.0001 and P<0.001). There was no significant difference in OS of the patients with either low or high expressions of FGFR1, FGF2, and IP3K. When the patients with early or advanced stage disease were separately taken into consideration, the relationship did not differ, either.

Therefore, in order to be able to develop such a treatment in the future, it is essential to identify the genetic abnormalities that are responsible for the biological behaviors and carcinogenesis of SqCLC. Although we could not show the prognostic and predictive significance of FGFR1, FGF2 and IP3K expressions in SqCLC, we determined the expression rates of FGFR1, FGF2 and IP3K as a reference for Turkish patients.

A biotin-labeled target probe spanning the FGFR1 locus (8p11.22-23) was used to determine the FGFR1 amplification status by fluorescence in situ hybridization.;FGFR1 amplification was detected in 16% (12 of 72) of all primary L-SCCs. In metastatic tumors, 18% (seven of 39) of the lymph node metastases displayed FGFR1 amplification with an exact correlation of FGFR1 amplification status between tumor and metastatic tissue.;FGFR1 amplification is a common genetic event occurring at a frequency of 16% in L-SCCs. Moreover, lymph node metastases derived from FGFR1-amplified L-SCCs also exhibit FGFR1 amplification. Therefore, we suggest that the FGFR1 amplification is a clonal event in tumor progression. Beyond this biologically relevant observation, the findings carry potential therapeutic implications in that small-molecule inhibitors may be applicable to the treatment of a subset of patients with metastatic L-SCC.",

With attention to the direct connection between the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) of tumor cells and the pharmacological effects of specific inhibitors, we systematically assessed the RTK expressions of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the lung [HGNECs, including SCLC and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC)].;Fifty-one LCNEC and 61 SCLC patients who underwent surgical resection were enrolled in this research. As a control group, 202 patients with adenocarcinomas (ADCs) and 122 patients with squamous cell carcinomas (SQCCs) were also analyzed. All the tumors were stained with antibodies for 10 RTKs: c-Kit, EGFR, IGF1R, KDR, ERBB2, FGFR1, c-Met, ALK, RET, and ROS1.;The LCNEC and SCLC patients exhibited similar clinicopathological characteristics. The IHC scores for each RTK were almost equivalent between the LCNEC and SCLC groups, but they were significantly different from those of the ADC or SQCC groups. In particular, c-Kit was the only RTK that was remarkably expressed in both LCNECs and SCLCs. On the other hand, about 20 % of the HGNEC tumors exhibited strongly positive RTK expression, and this rate was similar to those for the ADC and SQCC tumors. Intriguingly, strongly positive RTKs were almost mutually exclusive in individual tumors.;Compared with ADC or SQCC, LCNEC and SCLC had similar expression profiles for the major RTKs. The exclusive c-Kit positivity observed among HGNECs suggests that c-Kit might be a distinctive RTK in HGNEC.",

However, constitutive activation of FGFR1 by gene amplification, translocation or mutation is associated with various malignancies as, for example, breast cancer or myeloproliferative diseases. We have recently reported that FGFR1 amplification occurs in 20% of pulmonary squamous cell carcinomas, and preclinical tests have shown that these alterations are therapeutically tractable. These findings make FGFR1 amplification a potential biomarker for lung cancer treatment. Squamous cell carcinomas of the lung are characterized by an uneven FGFR1 gene copy number distribution. Therefore, fluorescence in situ hybridization assays need to address focality and heterogeneity of FGFR1 in these tumors. Here, we review our proposal for a reading and evaluation strategy. Furthermore, we highlight the emerging landscape of clinical trials with selective and unselective FGFR inhibitors and provide first response data from early clinical trials. ",

Arsenic trioxide (ATO) was previously shown to suppress growth of lung cancer. Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) amplification was recently demonstrated in lung SCC, with specific FGFR inhibitor (e.g. PD173074) developed as a potential targeted therapy. Therefore the combination effects of ATO and PD173074 in SCC was studied.;The combination of ATO/PD173074 was studied in a proof-of-principle model using a lung SCC cell line with FGFR1 overexpression: SK-MES-1. The effects of ATO and/or PD173074 on cell viability and protein expression were studied by MTT assay and Western blot respectively. Cell cycle analysis, phosphatidylserine externalization and mitochondrial membrane depolarization were monitored by flow cytometry. FGFR1 knockdown was performed with siRNAs. Proteasome inhibitor (MG-132) was used to study the degradation mechanism. In vivo effect of ATO and/or PD173074 was investigated using a nude mice xenograft model.;Combined ATO/PD173074 reduced cell viability along with increased sub-G1 population, phosphatidylserine externalization and mitochondrial membrane depolarization more significantly than single treatments. Downregulation of FGFR1, p-Akt, Akt, p-Src, Src, p-c-Raf, c-Raf, Erk and survivin as well as upregulation of p-Erk and cleaved PARP were observed upon ATO and/or PD treatment. MG-132 partially reversed the degradation of Akt, Src, c-Raf and Erk induced by ATO/PD, suggestive of ubiquitin-independent proteasome-dependent degradation. However, the mechanism of FGFR1 downregulation remained unknown. Downregulation of FGFR1, Akt, Src, c-Raf and Erk as well as cleaved PARP elevation induced by ATO and/or PD were confirmed in vivo.;Massive protein degradation (FGFR1, Akt, Src, c-Raf and Erk) was induced by ATO and/or PD173074 treatment mainly mediated by activation of proteasomal degradation in SCC cell line SK-MES-1 in vitro and in vivo.",

However, the biopsy and cytology samples available for molecular testing in advanced metastatic NSCLC tumors are likely to be small specimens, including core needle biopsies and/or fine needle aspiration, which may limit the molecular and genomic analysis with currently available methods and technologies. In this process, the role of the pathologist is becoming increasingly important to adequately integrate both routine histopathologic assessment and molecular testing into the clinical pathology for proper tumor diagnosis and subsequent selection of the most appropriate therapy.

Here, FGF signaling network, cancer genetics/genomics of FGF receptors (FGFRs), and FGFR-targeted therapeutics will be reviewed. FGF signaling to RAS-MAPK branch and canonical WNT signaling cascade mutually regulate transcription programming. FGF signaling to PI3K-AKT branch and Hedgehog, Notch, TGFβ, and noncanonical WNT signaling cascades regulate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion. Gene amplification of FGFR1 occurs in lung cancer and estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, and that of FGFR2 in diffuse-type gastric cancer and triple-negative breast cancer. Chromosomal translocation of FGFR1 occurs in the 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, as with FGFR3 in multiple myeloma and peripheral T-cell lymphoma. FGFR1 and FGFR3 genes are fused to neighboring TACC1 and TACC3 genes, respectively, due to interstitial deletions in glioblastoma multiforme. Missense mutations of FGFR2 are found in endometrial uterine cancer and melanoma, and similar FGFR3 mutations in invasive bladder tumors, and FGFR4 mutations in rhabdomyosarcoma. Dovitinib, Ki23057, ponatinib, and AZD4547 are orally bioavailable FGFR inhibitors, which have demonstrated striking effects in preclinical model experiments. Dovitinib, ponatinib, and AZD4547 are currently in clinical trial as anticancer drugs. Because there are multiple mechanisms of actions for FGFR inhibitors to overcome drug resistance, FGFR-targeted therapy is a promising strategy for the treatment of refractory cancer.
